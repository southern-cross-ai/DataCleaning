<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
<p><small>THERE</small> is one disadvantage in being a
pioneer&mdash;the just appreciation, which is jour due, comes
about one hundred years after your death.</p>
<p>Governor Phillip when he explored the Hawkesbury in 1789 was
moved to designate it "so noble a river", and, in the years to
come, his successors had reason to endorse this opinion, for the
banks of the river were the granary of the infant settlement.</p>
<p>It is with the pioneers who opened the way, and with the men
who followed and built and tended the pleasant town of Windsor on
the noble river's bank that Mr. Steele's book deals. He has
expended much time and labour in gathering his material and in
disinterring from the somewhat dusty chambers of the past the
names and deeds of men who "deserve to live."</p>
<p>For these services Mr. Steele deserves the success which I am
sure this book will command.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p><small>ALL</small> who would know the early history of
Australia must perforce know something of its first granary, the
Green Hills, afterwards known as Windsor.</p>
<p>The substance of this volume ran through the columns of the
<em>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</em> between August, 1914, end
February, 1915.</p>
<p>The Articles have been the subject of considerable
correspondence, both in the local paper and direct to the author.
By this means valuable revisions and additions have been
made.</p>
<p>Errors there may be, but every effort has been made to verify
the data.</p>
<p>The authorities consulted will be found at the end of the
book, but I cannot close my studies of Old Windsor without again
thanking the many correspondents who have assisted me, and
especially Mr. John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., the grand old man of
Windsor, and Mr. Henry Selkirk, of the Lands Department, and for
several years a kindly neighbour in Killara.</p>

<p>"I have read the articles on the 'Early Days of Windsor', by
the Rev. James Steele.</p>
<p>"As a native of Windsor, with a clear recollection of the past
seventy-five years, I may say that the author has spared no pains
to make his statements accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>"His work will supply a felt want, in the literature of
Windsor, and it should prove very acceptable to all lovers of the
Hawkesbury districts.</p>
<p>"As years roll on it will certainly become an invaluable work
of reference on all matters connected with the district."</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER I.</p>
<h3>HAWKESBURY AND GREEN HILLS.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Early Data.</strong></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> history of the Hawkesbury District between
the years 1788 and 1794 consists of the discovery, exploration
and naming of the river and its tributaries, among them the
McDonald and the Colo Rivers, by Governor A. Phillip and Captains
Collins, Johnston, Watkin, and Tench. These and others made
several successive visits to the Hawkesbury River, reaching as
far as Richmond Hill.</p>
<p>In the year 1794 Lieut.-Governor Major Grose placed the first
twenty-two settlers along the banks of the Hawkesbury River and
South Creek, railed then Ruse's Creek, as James Ruse, the man who
first grew wheat at Parramatta, had a grant of land at the
junction of that stream with the Hawkesbury. The following year
many more families were settled, and as the natives were
troublesome, some troops from the N.S.W. Corps were sent up, and
the settlement of Windsor, then called Green Hills, was fairly
launched.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that Lieutenant Grose was the son of
Captain Grose, concerning whose peregrinations through Scotland
the poet Burns wrote:</p>
<p class="poem">A chiel's amang you takin' notes,<br>
And faith he'll print it.</p>
<p>The earliest Hawkesbury Crown grants included those to Samuel
Wilcox, John Brindley, William Bond, John Ruffler, Alexander
Wilson, and Whaelen. These were on the Peninsula. Thomas Westmore
and William Anderson, James Ruse, Ann Blady and Joseph Smallwood,
in 1797. Thomas Riccaby, Robert Braithwaite and Dr. William
Balmain, in the years 1798-99.</p>
<p>The Grants from the year 1800 to 1804 were as
follows&mdash;Thomas Hobby, William Bates, Lydia Austen, Charles
Marsden (900 acres), William Ezzy (130 acres), Henry Cox, and
Andrew Thompson. These may be easily located on the map of the
Parish of St. Matthew, County of Cumberland.</p>
<p>The grants for the same period made near Pitt Town
were:&mdash;Messrs. Stogdell, Palmer, Hobbs, Diggers, Jones,
Benn, Smallwood, Dr. Arndell (600 acres), McDaniel, and
Wilbow.</p>
<p>The present township of Pitt Town stands on portions of these
grants, which had to be resumed for township purposes in
1810.</p>
<p>In 1796 Governor Hunter visited the district, and instructions
were given to construct a road from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury,
and soon after this road was placed under a Trust, Dr. Mileham,
S. Lord, and Andrew Thompson being appointed. A Government store
was established in 1798, and placed in charge of William Baker,
whose name is perpetuated in Baker Street, Windsor and Baker's
Lagoon, near Richmond. This early store was situated somewhere
near the present Thompson Square. Baker afterwards kept an hotel
in Baker Street, known as the Royal Oak.</p>
<p>The old Government House was also built about this time as a
residence for Lieutenant Edward Abbott, commander of the troops
for the N.S.W. Corps.</p>
<p>Regular masters of all the settlers, both free and bond, were
held from time to time, and separate records kept of men, women,
and children belonging to each class&mdash;military, officers,
civil officers, freemen, prisoners and settlers.</p>
<p>On account of distress caused by floods the Governor curtailed
the sale of rum during the year 1798.</p>
<p>About the year 1800 there appeared on the Hawkesbury a settler
named Andrew Thompson, who played a leading part in the
development of the district up to the time of his death in 1810.
His history and numerous occupations are fully dealt with in
another place.</p>
<p>In the year 1802 the Gist bridge (a floating structure) was
built over the South Creek. The same year efforts were made to
grow rice, but with little success. Some good cedar trees were
growing in the district, and settlers were prohibited from
cutting them, as the Government claimed them all.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Arndell and Charles Grimes, Deputy Surveyor, were
appointed resident magistrates in 1802. Mr. Grimes left the
district in 1803, and was succeeded by Surveyor G.W. Evans, who
remained here until 1815.</p>
<p>During the years 1804-5 Governor King proclaimed the following
Commons in the district:&mdash;</p>
<p>Ham Common. Trustees: William Cox, John Bowman, Andrew
Thompson, Edward Tutterill, William Minchin.</p>
<p>Nelson Common. Trustees: Andrew Thompson, Thomas Biggars,
Thomas Tyler.</p>
<p>Richmond Hill Common. Trustees: John Ryan, John Bowman, Andrew
Thompson.</p>
<p>Phillip Common. Trustees: Mathew Lock, Edward Robinson, Henry
Baldwin.</p>
<p>Later Trustees for Ham Common were: Abraham Cornwell, Robert
Fitzgerald, George Bowman.</p>
<p>As will be seen on reference to the articles on "Schools and
Churches" elsewhere, divine service was held at the Hawkesbury by
Rev. S. Marsden, and others, at a very early date. A school was
also established at an early period, situated near South Creek,
just behind the Court House.</p>
<p>A covered waggon began to ply three times a week between
Windsor and Sydney, starting on 9th February, 1805. Fares 5s. to
Parramatta, and 7s. 6d. to Sydney. The time occupied on the
journey was sixteen hours, and William Roberts was the
enterprising coachman.</p>
<p>Ship and boat building was parried on at tins time along the
banks of the Hawkesbury, to which reference is made in Chapter
II.</p>
<p>The residents took an interest in the affairs of the colony in
those early days. An address was presented by them to the Senior
Chaplain, Rev. S. Marsden, on the occasion of his visiting
England in 1807. Another address, signed by eight hundred and
thirty-three residents, was presented to Governor Bligh,
expressive of their confidence in his administration in the year
1808. Governor Bligh, and his son-in-law, Captain Putland, had
farms near Pitt Town, where Bligh's oaks may still be seen.</p>
<p>The first Presbyterian Church was opened at Ebenezer in 1809.
It is still used for Divine service, and is now the oldest church
building in Australasia.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-five or thirty years of the settlement of
New South Wales, the Hawkesbury was looked upon as the granary of
the colony. When floods came the greatest anxiety was caused in
Sydney and Parramatta, and floods were fairly frequent in those
days. It was really the growth of grain, wheat and maize that led
Governor Macquarie to lay out, among others, the town of Windsor,
in order to preserve the produce being lost by inundations after
it had been harvested. We find, therefore, that several large
granaries were built at the Green Hills, at first constructed of
logs, and afterwards brick buildings of two and three stories.
Here the grain was stored under Government supervision. The
largest of these granaries stood on the present site of the
School of Arts, and was used later as a military hospital.
Another object of these grain depots was to better control the
price of grain, as in times of scarcity the local farmers charged
most exorbitant prices, and also tried to prevent
importation.</p>
<p>The first era of the history of Green Hills ends here, and the
second stage in its history as Windsor begins.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Windsor.</strong></p>
<p>Extract from Government and General Order, dated 15th
December, 1810, issued on the return of his Excellency Governor
Macquarie from an extensive tour of inspection through the
various districts where agriculture and the breeding of cattle
have occupied the attention of settlers. This tour occupied the
time from 6th November to 13th December, 1810:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The frequent inundations of the rivers Hawkesbury and Nepean
having been hitherto attended with the most calamitous effects,
with regard to crops growing in their vicinity, and in
consequence of most serious injury to the necessary subsistence
of the colony, the Governor has deemed it expedient (in order to
guard as far as human foresight can extend against the recurrence
of such calamities), to erect certain townships in the most
contiguous and eligible high grounds in the several districts
subjected to those inundations for the purpose of rendering every
possible accommodation and security to the settlers whose farms
are exposed to the floods. In pursuance of this plan, and with a
view to the prosperity of the country, he has already fixed upon
the most eligible situations within the several districts
bordering on these rivers, and marked out on the several Commons
where the townships are to be established, and each settler will
be assigned an allotment of ground for a dwelling house, offices,
garden, corn-yard, and stock yard, proportioned to the extent of
the farm he holds within the influence of the floods; but it is
to be clearly understood that the allotments so given, being
intended as places of security for the produce of the lands on
the banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean, cannot be sold or
alienated in any manner whatever, but with the farms to which
they are from the commencement to be annexed, and they are to be
always considered as forming an inseparable part of the said
farms.</p>
<p>"The Governor has accordingly marked out five separate
townships, namely, one for the district of Green Hills, which he
has called Windsor; one for Richmond Hill District, to be called
Richmond; one for the Nelson District, to be called Pitt Town;
one for Phillip District, to be called Wilberforce; and one for
the Nepean or Evan District, to be called Castlereagh. Directions
are already given to the several constables within those
districts immediately to ascertain and make a return of the names
of all those settlers whose farms are subject to be flooded,
together with the number of their farms and number of their
flocks and herds.</p>
<p>"Said report on return is in the first instance to be made to
Wm. Cox, Esq., principal magistrate of the Hawkesbury."</p>
<p>The year 1810 thus marks the beginning of the town of Windsor,
for in that year Governor Macquarie, having visited all the
settlements along the Hawkesbury, issued the above instructions
to lay out townships on the high ground. The main streets in
Windsor proper were laid out and named. A resident Chaplain, Rev.
R. Cartwright, was appointed. Roads were formed, and a new bridge
built over the South Creek.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson was appointed chief magistrate for the
district, but he died in the same year, and was succeeded by
William Cox. A coroner, Thomas Hobby, was appointed. A burial
ground was approved of, and a military hospital established. All
these and other appointments and improvements were made in the
years 1810-12, and from this date Windsor grew in importance and
wealth as the chief inland town in the colony. As late as the
year 1858 Windsor was considered the fourth town in the colony.
The late Hon. William Walker in that year gave the following list
of populations: Parramatta 15,758, Maitland 15,290, Bathurst
12,005, Windsor 8,431, Goulburn 7,028. The same figures will be
found in Waugh's Almanac for 1859.</p>
<p>During Governor Macquarie's regime (1810-22) Windsor was
really a military settlement. The 73rd Regiment was stationed
here in large barracks built about the year 1820, and still
standing in Bridge Street. At first the soldiers' and prisoners'
barracks were in Thompson Square, near the Windsor wharf. The
Colonial Hospital was built, and also St. Matthew's Church and
Rectory.</p>
<p>The main history of this period will be found elsewhere, in
such articles as "The Hospital", "Churches", "Magistrates",
"Early Schools", "Military", and specially in the separate
articles dealing with the following pioneers:&mdash;Andrew
Thompson, Richard Fitzgerald, Dr. Arndell, Dr. Mileham, Rev.
Henry Fulton, Rev. J. Youl, Rev. R. Cartwright, William Cox,
Captain J. Brabyn, and Lieutenant A. Bell.</p>
<p>The seasons at the period we write of were drier than
formerly, the only floods of any consequence being in 1611 and
1817, until the late fifties, when floods again became
frequent.</p>
<p>About this period lived Margaret Catchpole, a somewhat
mysterious character, who was buried in St. Peter's graveyard,
Richmond. For her history we would refer our readers to numerous
articles in the local papers, especially during the years 1889,
1893, 1896 and 1897. A large collection of newspaper cuttings has
been got together in book form by Mr. J. Padley ("Yeldap"), and
can be found in the Sydney Public Library, catalogue number 994
over 7. An older article runs through the <i>Windsor Magazine</i>
published in 1857. The <i>Evening News</i>, in August and
October, 1897, had a series of articles on Margaret
Catchpole.</p>
<p>In the year 1820, a party of explorers left Windsor to examine
the Hunter River district. They were all local men, judging by
their names: John Howe (leader), and his son-in-law George Loder,
Andrew Howe, William Dargan, Philip Thornley, and Benjamin
Singleton, after whom a northern town is named. They arrived at
Patrick Plains on St. Patrick's Day, hence its name. The party
returned <i>via</i> the present site of Maitland, and several of
the old Windsor residents became pioneers of that northern
district.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice the rapid development of the town
of Windsor and district during the regime of Governor Macquarie.
Roads were made, magistrates and clergymen were appointed,
churches and schools provided, public buildings erected, such as
court house, gaol, military barracks, and hospital. These were
well built, for four, if not five, Macquarie buildings are still
in use&mdash;St. Matthew's Church and rector, and the Court House
being the best examples. The hospital has been remodelled, but
the old main walls remain. The police barracks is another
Macquarie legacy.</p>
<p>A painting of Governor Macquarie was arranged for by the
inhabitants of Windsor during his last visit to the town, and
this was executed on his return to England, at a cost of
&pound;73 10s., and has hung in the Court House for the past
ninety years. Governor Macquarie's reply, granting the citizens'
request, is dated from Government House, Windsor, 4th January,
1822. The painting has been renovated and revarnished several
times. Attempts have been made to have the historic picture hung
in Sydney, but the local magistrates have at all times jealously
guarded it, and turned a deaf ear to even the request for a loan
of it to the big city near by.</p>
<p>At the close of his term of office, Macquarie, in a despatch
to Earl Bathurst, dated July, 1822, gives a list of the public
buildings and works at the Hawkesbury. The list is as follows:
The comments are not, of course, in the original:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Church with spire and space for gallery. This refers to St.
Matthew's, which although opened in 1822, was not then quite
completed.</p>
<p>2. Burial ground, four acres, fenced.</p>
<p>3. Barracks for fifty soldiers, with stockade.</p>
<p>4. Barracks for one hundred convicts, with high brick
wall.</p>
<p>Number three was completed on 28th February, 1820. The high
brick wall was lowered many years ago, and the barracks are those
still seen in Bridge-Street.</p>
<p>5. Gaol. The present gaol was built on the same site in 1859.
The original gaol was, we believe, built before Macquarie's time,
but he had it enlarged about the year 1820.</p>
<p>6. House on left bank of South Creek, bought from A.
Thompson's executors, and made into a hospital and grounds for
fifty patients.</p>
<p>7. Government granary. Two in 1810. One was made into a
temporary chapel in 1810; downstairs a church, upstairs a school,
and residence for the chaplain.</p>
<p>8. Three-storey provision store and granary, bought from
Andrew Thompson's estate.</p>
<p>9. Old granary, new roof and repaired.</p>
<p>We have difficulty in locating the buildings numbered 6, 7, 8,
and 9. A large building stood on the site of the present School
of Arts, known at the time as the old military hospital, and
where soldiers were seen standing on guard. This was originally
built of brick for a granary, one hundred and one feet by
twenty-five feet, and twenty-three feet high, with three floors,
and was completed in August, 1803. This is probably No. 6.
Another three-storey building stood behind the present School of
Arts, and was the church in use until the opening of St.
Matthew's in 1822, part being a school. We can find no trace of
this being used for any other purpose than that of a church and
school, and we hesitate to name it No. 7. The store and granary,
No. 8, stood in Thompson Square. Fifteen hundred pounds was paid
for it to Thompson's trustees in 1812. No. 9 we cannot
locate.</p>
<p>10. Wooden wharf for one-hundred-ton boats, and a ferry punt.
This wharf was on the same spot, close to the present bridge, as
that still used.</p>
<p>11. Court House adjourning gaol. Built in 1820-21. In
Macquarie's time there was no street between the gaol and the
Court House. There had been another Court House previous to 1821,
but it was discarded.</p>
<p>12. New parsonage house and ground for garden.</p>
<p>13. Old Government cottage repaired and improved. Six acres of
land enclosed, partly with a brick wall.</p>
<p>14. New coach house and stables. This was afterwards the
police stables. It is probably the building still standing behind
the police barracks.</p>
<p>15. Streets of Windsor repaired. New streets opened up.</p>
<p>On the arrival of Governor Macquarie's successor, Sir Thomas
Brisbane, he called for a report on the public buildings of the
colony. We have quoted from this report, which was made in 1824,
in the articles dealing with the Hospital, St. Matthew's Church,
and the old Government House.</p>
<p>This is a fitting place to insert some further particulars as
to the expenditure and the condition of certain other Windsor
buildings:&mdash;</p>
<p>Extracts from report of the value of the improvements which
have taken place in the Public Buildings of Sydney, Parramatta,
Windsor, Liverpool, and Campbelltown, from December 25th, 1822,
to December 24th, 1823, and an expose of the present state of
Public Buildings in New South Wales, by order of his Excellency
Sir Thomas Brisbane, made by S.L. Harris, Architect, in
1824:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Commissariat Offices, etc.&mdash;The office is a shed
adjoining the end of the store, about eighty feet long, with two
storeys."</p>
<p>"The School Room, Old Hospital, Store, and Dr. West's House
are on a small scale, and the latter in a very dilapidated
state."</p>
<p>"Court House (with plan).&mdash;The building is so badly
executed that tho' it has not been built two years, strong
settlements are showing themselves in the walls and ceilings, and
the interior accommodations are not at all adapted for the
purpose intended, as the plan will show."</p>
<p>"General Observations.&mdash;The author of this report, etc.,
etc., would advert to the expensive and insufficient plan pursued
in making and repairing bridges&mdash;the one now re-building at
Windsor is a proof of this assertion, for instead of throughing
over a stout truss'd and framed wooden bridge of one arch (which
from the bold situation of the banks might have been done at
little more cost than what is now expended) the same principle is
still followed as that at first introduced into the colon; by
placing piles in the sides and bed of the river, which collect
all the rubbish continually floating down, and in the event of a
flood must unavoidably destroy every bridge so constructed."</p>
<p>With regard to this report we may say that the Court House
stands to-day strong and solid, and in constant use, and likely
to last for many years to come. The same report condemned the
mortar used in St. Matthew's Church, but it seems as strong and
hard to-day as it was ninety years ago. The bridge referred to
was in use until 1838.</p>
<p>On 10th August, 1829, the first Circuit Court was opened in
Windsor by Judge Stephen. Thomas Bayliss was tried for
house-breaking at Mulgrave, and was executed on 31st October,
1829. About this time another prisoner was sentenced to
seventy-five lashes for stealing a few oranges at Belmont. Dr.
West watched the pulse while the flogging was publicly
administered.</p>
<p>Horse racing was carried on in the year 1832, the racecourse
being located at Killarney, of which John Howe was secretary.
There was another course at Wilberforce, to which visitors came
from all parts of the colony.</p>
<p>A local fair was held, regarding which we clip the following
advertisement from the <i>Government Gazette</i>;&mdash;"Windsor
Annual Fair. Gentlemen, Graziers and the public generally are
respectfully informed that the Windsor Fair will be held at the
Market Place, Windsor, on Tuesday, 10th June, 1834, being the
second Tuesday in the month of June, and that no charge is made
by way of fee or toll for stock or articles offered for sale at
the said Fair. John Howe, Clerk of Market, pro tem."</p>
<p>In 1831, the following were the Windsor contractors for the
supply of stores, firewood, and cartage for the local Government
survey parties:&mdash;Jas. Hale, Jas. McGrath, Jas. Thorn, and
Solomon Wiseman. The latter died on 12th January, 1838, aged 61
years.</p>
<p>In 1837 the population of Windsor was 1,145. In 1841 it
numbered 1,440. In 1848 it was 1,679, and in 1891 the figures
were 2,026. Richmond population was 982 in 1837. The population
of Windsor according to the 1911 census was 1,674.</p>
<p>In the thirties a great change came over the street formation
of Windsor. About 1836, Glebe Street, afterwards known as Tebbutt
Street, was surveyed off the Church Green and the allotments
facing the Green sold. The Roman Catholic Church got their grant
from this in 1837. A few years after, what was known as Cope's
Farm was sold. It consisted of portions of the grants to Joseph
Smallwood, and Thomas Riccaby, granted to them in 1797 and 1798.
Thomas Riccaby died on the 15th May, 1818, aged 67 years. This
farm, part of which was formerly known as Catherine Farm,
extended from the eastern boundary of the Presbyterian Church to
a point near Fitzgerald Street, and included New Street,
Catherine Street, Church Street, and Windsor Terrace. The land
was sold by Laban White, on 5th July, 1838.</p>
<p>The Cope family lived in the old cottage next the Presbyterian
Church; the name appears in the <i>Post Office Directory</i> at
1835. The family assisted in the entertainment of Governor
Fitzroy's family during their visit to the district in the
forties. Maria Cope died on 14th May, 1849, aged 57, while her
son, Joseph Cope, died on 26th July, 1662, aged 43 years. Another
son was drowned in the Hawkesbury River in 1836, at the age of
eight years.</p>
<p>A few years later another street was opened, known at first as
Brown Street, but now Suffolk Street.</p>
<p>Up to the forties there was no settlement in the Newtown end
of Windsor, but with the advent of the railway, in 1864, quite a
boom in house building took place in that quarter.</p>
<p>With the forties also came another change. The military were
removed, and Windsor ceased to be looked upon as a military
settlement.</p>
<p>Building, too, went forward, for in 1835 the old Benevolent
Society's Home was built; in 1839 the second Wesleyan Church; in
1840 the Roman Catholic Church; in 1842 the Presbyterian Church
and St. Phillip's Church, Clydesdale; and about the same time St.
Peter's Church of England, Richmond. Besides these, flour-mills,
tanneries, hotels, and other places were built.</p>
<p>In 1843 came the first election, described elsewhere in these
articles.. The same year the first local newspaper was started,
and in order to give additional sensation to that year, the
Windsor to Sydney mail coach was twice "stuck up" by
bushrangers&mdash;on 1st May, and again on 23rd September.</p>
<p>During these "Roaring Forties" we find there were more than
two public houses open in Windsor for every one found to-day.
There are lists given of thirteen, fourteen, and sixteen bars in
Windsor at the time, while the Hon. Wm. Walker says "there were
forty public houses in and around Windsor," but this would
include Richmond and several other townships along the river.</p>
<p>Cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and prize-fighting were favourite
pastimes. Athletic and pedestrian feats were much in evidence,
Windsor supplying several champions, who held their own in Sydney
and Parramatta, as well as locally. Among such names were Eather,
Bushell, Oxley, Judd, Lindsay, Dalton and Beasley.</p>
<p>Those who want further information on these gay times may find
it by looking up <i>Reminiscenses</i>, W. Walker (Windsor), 1890,
pp. 11-12; <i>The Good Old Days</i>, J.C. L. Fitzpatrick
(Windsor), 1900. pp. 45-59; <i>Australian</i>, G.L.A. Davies, 4th
January, 1878; or the files of the <i>Windsor and Richmond
Gazette</i> for August, 2nd September, 1893, and 18th September,
1897.</p>
<p>We now come to the fifties, when things were quiet in Windsor
owing to the rush to the new goldfields. Amongst the citizens who
begin to appear in Windsor public life we might mention William
Walker, who built his home on the terrace, and planted a good old
oak tree near the back door in 1853. The tree may be seen putting
forth its Leaves in this the filet year of its life. Messrs. Faux
and Beard appeared in Windsor in 1853, and established a large
business, afterwards carried on by Greenwell and Co., and now by
M.H. Pulsford and Co.</p>
<p>In the year 1857 there appeared a local magazine run in
connection with the Debating Society, which flourished like a
green bay tree in those days, and led to the establishment of the
School of Arts, as will be seen elsewhere. This paper was called
the <i>Windsor Review</i>, and was edited by Jas. Kennedy, York
Lodge, where he also kept a school for boys. From its pages we
cull a few notes of the doings of 1857, and thereabouts.</p>
<p>The wants of Windsor were then stated not as a railway or a
bridge, but first, a Bank; second, a public well and pump; third,
a public market and commercial exchange; fourth, a fishing
company. Of these we may say the Bank came first. The Bank of New
South Wales was opened in 1858, and the Savings Bank opened a
branch the same year. (See Chapter on Banks.)</p>
<p>In an article on Richmond the leading residents are given as
Messrs. Bowman, Selkirk, Whitaker, Cox, Benson, Dight, and
Faithful. The country between Windsor and Richmond is described
as all scrub.</p>
<p>An inmate of the Windsor Benevolent Society, at the age of
113, having become tired of his surroundings, applied for
permission to go elsewhere to reside.</p>
<p>The following marriage notices appear in this 1857
magazine:&mdash;Henry Moses&mdash;Annie Primrose; John
Overmeyer&mdash;Susan Moses; William Reid&mdash;Mrs. Ann Onus;
Rev. Geo. Banks Smith&mdash;Elizabeth Walker.</p>
<p>The population of Windsor and district was 8,431. An article
on 5th October, 1857, is very optimistic. It rejoices to find
social progress in Windsor, as indicated by a Mechanics'
Institute, Debating Society, Y.M.C.A. and a Horticultural and
Agricultural Society.</p>
<p>This <em>Windsor Magazine</em> for 1857 has also a series of
articles on Margaret Catchpole which, written so long ago, nearly
sixty years, and so much nearer the time of her activities,
should be worth studying by her numerous modern admirers.</p>
<p>The main history of the sixties will be found under the
articles of this series dealing with the School of Arts, built in
1860-61; the Volunteer Movement, started in 1860; the agitation
for the building, and at last the completion, of the railway in
1864; and the Big Flood, 23rd June, 1867, when the river rose to
the extraordinary height of sixty-three feet, and six lives were
lost.</p>
<p>In 1860 another attempt was made to start a local newspaper,
the fifth flutter of the kind since 1843. It was called the
<em>Windsor Advertiser</em>, edited by Wm. Doyle, and ran from
July to December, but the literary tastes of the town had to wait
ten years longer for a permanent Press, for not till 1870 and
1871 did this enterprise become established in the shape of the
<i>Hawkesbury Times</i> and the Australian, as will be seen in
the article on "Newspapers".</p>
<p>An effort to incorporate the town of Windsor in 1860 failed,
notwithstanding the efforts of James Ascough and Thomas Primrose
to get it going.</p>
<p>The Rev. H.T. Stiles, M.A., died in 1867, after a ministry of
thirty-four years in St. Matthew's Church.</p>
<p>The great event of the seventies was the big fire which broke
out in George Street, near the site of the <i>Gazette</i> office,
at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd December, 1874, and spread over the
whole block bounded by George, Fitzgerald, Suffolk and Macquarie
Streets, on both sides. The damage was estimated at
&pound;100,000. A full account of the catastrophe will be found
in the local and Sydney press of the time, so we need not attempt
a full description. The Barraba Hotel, which stood on the corner
opposite the Post Office, the Methodist Church and parsonage (but
strange to say not the school hall, which can be seen in the
accompanying view of this big fire), two tanneries, the
Oddfellows' Hall, and many shops and houses were destroyed. The
Sydney fire brigade was wired for, and arrived by special train
about ten p.m. One life was lost. Relief funds rendered some
urgent relief. The local hon. secretary of the fund was Mr. Wm.
Dean, while Mr. B. Coley acted as hon. treasurer.</p>
<p>A fire brigade was started in 1872. The leading members were
H. Coley and William Gosper, who stuck to the brigade for many
years, also S. Dick, W. Perry, J. Tout, and A.B. Kirk. The
present Fire Brigade building was erected in 1915.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1871 that the first Municipal Council was
elected, with Robert Dick as first mayor. Further particulars are
found in Chapter XXXIII.</p>
<p>In 1874 the following trustees were appointed:&mdash;Pitt Town
Common, Wm. Johnston, C.W. May, Thos. Chaseling.</p>
<p>Wilberforce Common.&mdash;J.H. Fleming, S.J. Dunston, R.
Greentree.</p>
<p>Richmond Hill Common.&mdash;John Gow, Ed. Raper, J.B.
Johnston, C.W. May, J.M. McQuade.</p>
<p>Ham Common.&mdash;Jos. Onus, Jas. Holmes, C.R. Bedwell, W.T.
Price, W. Smith.</p>
<p>In 1872 printed rules for Ham Common were issued by the
trustees, who at that time were: W.I. Crew, Jos. Onus, C.R.
Bedwell, Wm. Gosper, Wm. Smith. In 1880 two of these were
replaced by Benjamin Richards and David Cobcroft.</p>
<p>In 1874 the Rev. Dean Hallinan left Windsor, after a ministry
of twenty-two years in the Roman Catholic Church. He was
presented with a large puree of sovereigns, subscribed by all
denominations.</p>
<p>A big flood in Maitland in 1875 called forth the sympathy of
the Windsor residents, who subscribed one hundred and ten pounds
for the relief fund.</p>
<p>The old denominational school system came to an end by the
erection and opening: of the present Public School in 1870.</p>
<p>Among the shopkeepers in the seventies were: W. Dean, S.T.
Greenwell, W. Beard, Robinson, W. Moses, Dick Bros., D. Holland,
S.E. Dyer, P. O'Hara, J.B. Byram, L. Barnett, J. Lane, W.
Primrose, F.J. Mortley, M. Neilson, John Burton.</p>
<p>A very notable event at this time was the opening of the
Windsor low-level bridge in 1874. It was raised eight feet to its
present height in 1897. Fuller particulars and an illustration
will be found in Chapter XXI. on Bridges.</p>
<p>With the advent of the railway, the formation of the Borough
Council, opening of Banks, regular local newspaper, and the
Public School, the old order of things gradually passed away; and
this was further noticed with the decline of the river trade
which set in during the eighties, owing to the silting-up of the
channel.</p>
<p>We now come to the era of modern times, when, as will be Been
in the article on the Municipality, water was laid on to the
streets in 1890, and the streets were lit with gas in 1887,
streets were attended to, and footpaths kerbed and formed, and
better sanitary laws enforced. Socially, too, things moved on
apace. In 1882, on 22nd February, a great cricket match was
played on the Fairfield ground between an All-England Eleven and
twenty-two players from the Hawkesbury clubs. A special train was
run from Sydney, and one thousand spectators were present.
Hawkesbury made sixty-one runs, W. Read, and W. Hull being top
score with ten runs each. Ail England made one hundred and
thirty-five runs for the loss of five wickets, Barlow fifty (not
out) being top score. Blackham retired hurt. The match was
arranged by the late Henry McQuade.</p>
<p>In 1882 a coursing club met regularly at Fairfield. A tennis
club was formed in 1888, with W.H.H. Becke as President, and J.G.
Neilley, hon. secretary. The ground was in Moses Street, dose to
the rectory.</p>
<p>A large and flourishing school, known as the Windsor Grammar
School, was started by Mr. B. Keenan, and a fine building erected
on the road to Penrith, in 1884. The Salvation Army came along
about the year 1887, barracks being built for them by Alderman T.
Primrose.</p>
<p>Some excitement was caused in the district, especially about
Riverstone, by the advent of "Dr. German Charlie", who is
reported to have made some Wonderful cures, and who was visited
by hundreds of patients at Riverstone. The railway carriages were
regularly disinfected, and numerous coaches and 'buses met the
trains to convey the patients out to consult him at his home near
Marsden Park. This was during the years 1888-89, after which he
moved nearer Parramatta. An article on "German Charlie" will be
found in the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, 18th August,
1888.</p>
<p>In 1889 an agitation was made for a tramway from Mulgrave to
Pitt Town, and from Windsor to Sackville Reach. In 1891 a brass
band started by R.J. Tout, on whose shoulders the mantle of
Samuel Egerton, a former popular bandmaster, had fallen.</p>
<p>On 10th July, 1892, Alexander Bowman, M.L.A., died. He had
represented the district in Parliament for nearly fifteen years,
and was very popular in the electorate.</p>
<p>In 1893 the Labour Farm Settlement was started on the Pitt
Town Common.</p>
<p>Although this was the period of the Bank failures, and of the
great drought in 1895, we find two fine business premises were
erected. Mr. R. A-Pye purchased Boston's Corner, and erected his
large shop and dwelling there in 1893-94; and Mr. George
Robertson about the same time erected his solid stone premises
near the railway station. The artistic carving on the stonework
of this building is unique, and worthy of more than a passing
glance.</p>
<p>In 1896 the Rev. P. Fitzgerald resigned from the local
Presbyterian Church, after a ministry of twenty-four years,
during which time he took an active part in everything pertaining
to the good and welfare of the town.</p>
<p>We have now reached the last decade of the century, and are
getting on to quite too modern ground, for the historian feels
more at home in the hoary past than in the region of current
events, so we will venture on two more items only.</p>
<p>In 1891 the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was started, 3,195
acres of Ham Common being taken for the purpose. The principals
have been: Mr. J.L. Thompson, 1891-97; Mr. George Valder,
1900-1902; Mr. H.W. Potts, 1902-15. The permanent buildings were
erected in 1895; the orchard was planted in 1891; the dairy
established in 1892; poultry and bees 1893; vegetable garden
1898; irrigation farm 1905. An excellent history of the College
has been written by Mr. C.T. Musson, Science Master, to which we
are indebted for these notes.</p>
<p>On 24th August, 1892, the Jersey Butter Factory was opened by
Lord Jersey with a great procession and demonstration such as had
seldom or never before been seen in Windsor. Several Ministers of
the Crown and Members of Parliament, and the Lord Mayor of
Sydney, were present. There was a banquet in the Church of
England Hall, and a big picnic for the children of Windsor and
the surrounding districts. (For particulars, see "Industries" in
these articles.)</p>
<p>It is of interest to recall here the present business signs or
names which have been for the longest period seen in the Windsor
Streets. Several of these have descended from father to son.
There are other shops which have been longer in existence,
perhaps, such as Pulsford's, which goes back to the sixties, but
the name has changed. We find amongst the advertisements in the
old papers in 1878 the following names which are still familiar:
W. Moses, S.E. Dyer, F. Mortley, J.E. Byram; George Robertson,
1882; W. Gosper, 1887; R.A. Pye, 1887; T. Lobb, 1891; Joseph
Ward, 1892; J.T. Orr, 1893.</p>

<h3>PIONEERS.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Andrew Thompson.</strong></p>
<p>A<small>MONGST</small> the pioneers of Windsor, none is so
familiar to local residents as Andrew Thompson. He was born in
Scotland about the year 1773. His parents were of the poorer
class, his father being engaged in a small business. When sixteen
years of age he was transported to New South Wales for setting
fire to a stack of hay, and arrived by the ship <i>Pitt</i>, in
the year 1792, at the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>On arrival he was appointed to the stone gang at Parramatta,
where he probably remained for a few years.</p>
<p>We first hear of him at the Hawkesbury early in the year 1800,
when the population was very small, as a settler and
constable.</p>
<p>At a meeting of settlers held to fix the price of stores and
labour at the Hawkesbury, in the year 1800, Andrew Thompson was
amongst those present, also D. Smallwood, Edward Robinson, and M.
Lock.</p>
<p>On 13th November, 1800, Governor King issued a proclamation
that in order to prevent litigation, all agreements for the
Hawkesbury should be registered with Andrew Thompson, the
registration fee to be 6d. each entry. About this time he was
also appointed superintendent of labour gangs.</p>
<p>On 1st July, 1803, he obtained a grant of one hundred and
twenty acres from Governor King, on the South Creek, opposite the
property now occupied by Mr. John Tebbutt, extending out to
Magrath's Hill. On 11th August, 1804, he also got another grant
of two hundred end seventy acres adjoining Nelson Common,
afterwards known as Killarney, where subsequently the Scarvell
family resided for many years.</p>
<p>In the year 1802 he built the first bridge over the South
Creek. It was a floating bridge, and was situated about one
hundred yards further down the creek than the present bridge,
behind the Court House. Towards the construction of this bridge
be got a Government grant of fifteen pounds, and was also
supplied with Government labour. Permission was given him to
collect toll, and he was guaranteed against opposition. In 1806
this structure was replaced by a log bridge, for which he got a
fourteen years' lease.</p>
<p>He also turned his attention to ship-building, for we find in
returns dated 28th February, 1804, and 27th December, 1805, that
he was the owner of the following vessels trading to Bass Straits
and Sydney: <i>Nancy</i>, twenty tons; <i>Hope</i>, sixteen tons;
and <i>Hawkesbury</i>, eighteen tone. They were registered in
October, 1802, and March, 1804, and carried crews of three to six
men each. From otter sources we learn that these vessels were
built on the Hawkesbury. He also built the <i>Governor Bligh</i>,
in 1807, which traded to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson appears to have had some literary taste, for
in an advertisement in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 9th December,
1804, he asked that those to whom he had loaned certain books
would kindly return them. The bat of missing books is given,
which includes such standard works as Milton, Burns, Sterne,
Thomson, Hervey and others.</p>
<p>A Government order, dated 8th April, 1804, ordered that all
boats trading on the Hawkesbury River should be numbered and
registered by Andrew Thompson, head constable, otherwise they
would be confiscated.</p>
<p>In the year 1804 Governor King appointed trustees for the
several Commons of the Colony. Andrew Thompson being so appointed
for both the Ham and Nelson Commons.</p>
<p>He next appears on the scene as a brewer, receiving permission
on 11th May, 1806, to sell at a shilling a gallon, and small beer
sixpence. His brewery was situated on the bank of the South
Creek. In connection with the brewery he also kept a
public-house.</p>
<p>Another industry he started was the manufacture of salt. This
he carried on at Scotland Island, near Newport, at the mouth of
the Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>It is said that he also had an illicit distillery here.
However, it is known that Governor King gave him forty gallons of
spirits as a reward for some service rendered on May 27th, 1806.
A.T. Biggars got a similar reward at the same time, spirits in
those days, as was well-known, being a medium of exchange. It is
evident that Andrew Thompson did traffic pretty largely in
spirits, for he was fined &pound;100 in 1807 for so doing. The
fine, however, was remitted by Governor Bligh. Again, we find in
1800 a reference to the profits made on the sale of spirits by
Andrew Thompson, the Governor's bailiff. From this it appears
that he obtained four hundred gallons of spirits which he
retailed at a profit of twelve hundred pounds. (See H.R., Vol.
vii., page 225.)</p>
<p>He acquired a number of properties by purchase, including
property in Baker Street and in Bridge Street, Windsor. His town
residence in Sydney was in Macquarie Place. He had a house, known
as the Red House, on his farm near Magrath's Hill (see
illustration). He also had a large house and land in Bridge
Street, Windsor, still known as Thompson's Square.</p>
<p>In his house were held several meetings of, local residents,
one on 20th January, 1807, to petition the Governor aginst the
importation of wheat. We might here mention that wheat was
selling on 19th January, 1806, at nine shillings and threepence
in Windsor, and ten shillings a bushel in Sydney. This petition
was signed by one hundred and fifty-six persons, among whom were
Messrs. T. Arndell, Thomas Hobby, Andrew Thompson, George
Crossley, John Dight, C. and J. Palmer, T.M. Pitt, M. Everingham,
and H. Stockfish. At another meeting to consider local
grievances, John Bowman, Matthew Gibbons, and William Cummins
were also present. Another meeting, probably called by Andrew
Thompson, was held at his house in 1807, when it was decided to
send a petition of sympathy to Governor Bligh. This was signed by
five hundred and forty-six persons. Amongst the signatories were:
Messrs. James Cox, Thomas Hobby, G.W. Evans, William Baker,
Thomas Arndell, Samuel Solomon and Andrew Thompson.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson was appointed auctioneer for the Hawkesbury
district by the Lieutenant-Governor, on the 21st January, 1809.
On 31st March, 1810, he was appointed a trustee and commissioner
of the turnpike road from Sydney to Windsor, along with D'Arcy,
Wentworth, and Simeon Lord, by Governor Macquarie.</p>
<p>Governor Bligh, who took to farming in 1807, bought several
holdings on the river, near Pitt Town, near where the present
punt is located. Some oak trees planted at the time are known
to-day as Bligh's oaks. His son-in-law, Captain Putland, also had
land adjoining.</p>
<p>Captain Putland died in 1808, and was buried first in old St.
Philip's, Sydney, the body being removed in 1856 to Sandhills
(Devonshire Street Cemetery), and in 1901 again removed to La
Perouse, Botany. The inscription on the old tombstone
reads:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sacred. To the memory of John Putland, Esq., Captain of H.M.
Ship <i>Porpoise</i>, Chief Magistrate throughout the Territory,
and Aid de Camp to His Excellency Governor Bligh. Departed this
life January 4th, 1808. Aged 27 years."</p>
<p>Governor Bligh appointed Andrew Thompson as his bailiff or
agent, and left the entire management of his farm in his hands.
In October, 1807, the Governor's stock consisted of forty-nine
cows, and a number of sheep and pigs. The milk returns sent by
Andrew Thompson to him amounted to &pound;60 0s. 10d. for two
months.</p>
<p>During the big floods in 1806 and 1809, he took a very active
part in rescuing people and property in danger. In the
performance of this heroic work his health was seriously
undermined.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson also had a large store-keeping business at the
Green Hills (Windsor), which, according to an advertisement in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, was taken over by Mr. John Howe, in
December, 1809, he having had on sale "Woollens, drapery, and all
sorts of lines."</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie landed in New South Wales 28th December,
1809, and took over the administration of affaire of the colony
1st January, 1810, from Lieutenant Governor Foveaux, and on 12th
January, 1810, less than a fortnight after his arrival, Governor
Macquarie made Andrew Thompson a Justice of the Peace, and
appointed him as Chief Magistrate for the district of the
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie reports that on 30th April, 1810, Andrew
Thompson was received at the Governor's table, in Sydney, along
with Simeon Lord, an opulent Sydney merchant, and Dr. Redfern,
the assistant surgeon, and the officers of the 73rd Regiment.
This proceeding was greatly resented by the more aristocratic
members of the community.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson, however, did not live long to enjoy the
honours which were thus thrust upon him, for he died at his
residence, Green Hills, on 22nd October, 1810, and was buried on
26th October, in a vault, in the new cemetery. His was the first
interment there, the ground not being fenced nor consecrated
until shortly after (11th, May, 1611). His death was specially
notified to the Secretary of State, by Governor Macquarie, on
27th October, 1810.</p>
<p>In his will he named as executors, John Howe, Simeon Lord (he
was the father of the late George W. Lord, M.L.C.), and Captain
H.C. Antill. One-half of his estate was bequeathed to Governor
Macquarie and Simeon Lord in equal parts, the remainder being
left to his relatives in Britain.</p>

<p>The following obituary notice of Andrew Thompson appeared in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 27th October, 1810:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Died at Hawkesbury, Green Hills, on Monday, 22nd instant,
after a lingering and severe illness, aged 37 years, Andrew
Thompson, Esq., Magistrate of that district.</p>
<p>"In retracing the last twenty years of the life of this
exemplary and much lamented character, it will not be held
uncharitable to glance at the lapse from rectitude, which in an
early and inexperienced period of youth destined him to these
shores, since it will stamp a more honourable tribute to his
memory to have it recorded, that from his first arrival in this
country he uniformly conducted himself with that strict regard to
integrity and morality as to obtain and enjoy the countenance and
protection of several succeeding Governors. Active, intelligent,
and industrious of manners, mild and conciliatory, with a heart
generous and humane, Mr. Thompson was enabled to accumulate
considerable property, and what was more valuable to him, to
possess the confidence of some of the most distinguished
characters of this country, the consciousness of which surmounted
the private solicitude of re-visiting his native country, and led
him rather to yield to the wish of passing the evening of his
life where his manhood had been meritoriously exerted, than of
returning to the land which gave him birth. Mr. Thompson's
intrinsic good qualities were appreciated by his Excellency the
present Governor (Macquarie), who soon after his arrival here was
pleased to appoint him a Magistrate, for which situation Mr.
Thompson's natural good sense and a superior knowledge of the
laws of his country peculiarly fitted him.</p>
<p>"Nor can we close this tribute to his memory without recurring
to the important services Mr. Thompson rendered this colony and
many of his fellow creatures during the heavy and public
distresses which the floods at the Hawkesbury produced among the
settlers in that extensive district. Mr. Thompson's exertions on
a late occasion were for two days and two nights unremittingly
directed to the assistance of the sufferers, and we lament to add
that in those offices of humanity he not only exposed himself to
personal danger, but laid the foundation for that illness which
has deprived the world of a valuable life.</p>
<p>"During the unfortunate disturbances (the arrest of Governor
Bligh) which lately distracted this colony, he, whose death we
now lament, held on the 'even tenor of his way,' and acquitted
himself with mildness, moderation, and wisdom, and when the
ruthless hand of death arrested his earthly career, he yielded
with becoming fortitude, and left this world for a better, with
humble and devout resignation, and an exemplary confidence in the
mercies of his God."</p>
<p>The following account of the funeral appeared in the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>, 3rd November, 1810:&mdash;In the mention of the
death of A. Thompson, Esq., in the <i>Gazette</i> of last week,
we should have added an account of the funeral, which took place
on Friday Se'nnight (which means seven night), had we in time
received it. Between twelve and one in the afternoon, the remains
of this much-lamented gentleman were removed from his house on
the Green Hills, which for the hospitality of its owner had been
for many years proverbial, and conveyed to the Chapel on the
Green Kills, whereat the Rev. Mr. Cartwright attended and
delivered a very eloquent and appropriate discourse upon the
occasion to one of the most numerous and respectable
congregations ever assembled there, after which the ashes of this
philanthropist were conveyed to the new burial ground, and these
deposited in a vault in the presence of the multitude, who, it
may be unexceptionally said, felt the most sensible regret in
taking their last farewell of him whose life had been devoted to
the service of his fellow-creatures. In the funeral procession
the Rev. Mr. Cartwright walked foremost, and was followed by
Surgeons Mileham and Redfern, who had attended the deceased
through the long and painful illness that brought to a conclusion
an existence that had been well applied, Next followed the bier,
attended by Captain Antill, A.D.C. to His Excellency the
Governor, as chief mourner. The pall bearers were Mr. Cox, Mr.
James Cox, Mr. Lord, Mr. Williams, Mr. Arndell, and Mr. Blaxland.
A number of gentlemen followed as mourners, and a long train,
composed principally of the inhabitants of the settlement,
followed in succession."</p>
<p>The following is a copy of the entry of his death in the
register of the Parish Church of Hawkesbury:&mdash;"Entry No. 5.
Andrew Thompson, Esq., of this Parish, came to the colony in the
ship <i>Pitt</i>, in the year of our Lord, 1792. Aged 37 years,
and was buried October 25th, 1810.&mdash;Robert Cartwright."</p>
<p>A memo after this entry says: "A. Thompson, Esq. was the first
corpse buried in the new church-yard at Windsor."</p>
<p>The inscription on his tombstone in St. Matthew's church-yard
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">SACRED<br>
<br>
<small>to the MEMORY of</small><br>
<br>
ANDREW THOMPSON, ESQUIRE,</p>
<blockquote>Justice of the Peace and Chief Magistrate of the
District of the Hawkesbury, a Native of Scotland, who at the age
of 17 Years was sent to this Country where from the time of his
arrival he distinguished himself by the most persevering industry
and diligent attention to the commands of his Superiors. By these
means he raised himself to a state of respectability and
affluence which enabled him to indulge the generosity of his
nature In assisting his fellow Creatures in distress more
particularly in the Calamitous Floods of the river Hawkesbury in
the Years 1806 and 1809, and [when] at the immediate risque of
his life and perminant injury of his health he exerted himself
each time during three successive Days and Nights in saving the
lives and Properties of numbers who but for him must have
Perished.<br>
<br>
In consequence of Mr. Thompsons good Conduct, Governor Macquarie
appointed him Justice of the Peace. This act, which restored him
to that rank in Society which he had lost, made so deep an
impression on his grateful heart as to induce him to bequeath to
the Governor one-fourth of his Fortune.<br>
<br>
This most useful and valuable Man closed his Earthly career on
the 22nd Day of October, 1810, at His House at Windsor of which
he was the principal Founder in the 37th year of his age,
with[in] the Hope of [an] Eternal Life.<br>
<br>
From respect and esteem for the Memory of the deceased, this
Monument is erected by</blockquote>
<p align="center">LACHLAN MACQUARIE, GOVERNOR<br>
of<br>
New South Wales<br>
[A.D. 1813].</p>
<p>The above inscription, having become weather-worn, was recut
by Travis, of Richmond, about 1908, the coat having been
collected in Windsor. The words in brackets appear in a copy of
the inscription which was made about 1820, and is now in the
Public Records' Office, London.</p>
<p>Before closing this sketch of Andrew Thompson we must mention
that he had some bitter enemies in Sydney, though none locally,
who painted him in a very different colour. John Macarthur,
referring to his death, says: "It was an interposition of
Providence to save the colony from utter ruin; never was there a
more artful or a greater knave."</p>
<p>In Bigge's report on the colony of New South Wales, made in
1822, he describes him as using his wealth so as to gain an
influence with the small settlers on the Hawkesbury, and also as
a man of loose moral character.</p>
<p>But every fair-minded historian will see that a man who won
the esteem of three successive Governors, as well as of all the
leading residents of the district in which he lived, including
the clergymen, and at whose funeral the whole district followed
"their friend and patron" must agree that to call Andrew Thompson
a bad citizen is a distortion of plain facts.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Fitzgerald Family.</strong></p>
<p>Richard Fitzgerald arrived in the colony in the ship
<i>William and Ann</i>, on the 28th August, 1791, when about
nineteen years old. Governor Macquarie, writing in 1820, mentions
his faithful service during the course of twenty-eight years. We
find from the <i>Historical Records</i> that he had a grant of
land as early as 1794, and in 1801 he had four horses,
ninety-five sheep, forty pigs, and twenty-six acres under
crop.</p>
<p>The next mention of him in the Records is in the year 1802,
when he was Government storekeeper at Toongabbie. His name
appears as Chief Constable at Port Dalrymple on 18th February,
1809, and in March the same year as holding the same office at
the Hawkesbury. The following year he is described as Government
Storekeeper and Superintendent of Labour, Cattle, and Public
Works in this district at a salary of fifty pounds a year. These
offices he appears to have held until the year 1819, when he was
removed to Emu, and placed in charge of the Agricultural
establishment there. He must have soon returned to Windsor, for
all the family interests and the home were here.</p>
<p>He built the cottage, still standing, next the Royal Hotel in
George Street, from bricks which were rejected in building St
Matthew's Church of England, about the yearn 1817-19. This
cottage is, therefore, among the oldest buildings in Windsor.</p>
<p>Richard Fitzgerald appears to have been well liked by all
classes of the community, and was on intimate terms with the
governors, military officers, and magistrates.</p>
<p>He received a grant of land, one thousand three hundred and
fifty acres, from Governor Macquarie, while his son Robert
received a grant of one thousand seven hundred acres. In the 1817
flood he lost five hundred sheep by drowning.</p>
<p>In the year 1830 his name appears as a seat-holder&mdash;pew
No. 20, north side&mdash;in St. Matthew's Church.</p>
<p>As in the case of most of the other pioneers, we find his name
given to a Windsor cross street&mdash;that in which the Post
Office is built.</p>
<p>He lost a son, Richard, at the early age of seventeen years,
by accident, being thrown from his horse on 25th April, 1822.
Another son, John, died 20th April, 1835, at the age of
twenty-three years.</p>
<p>In his will he made provision for the annual payment of fifty
pounds to the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, which was continued
by his son Robert, and also by his grandson, Robert Marsden
Fitzgerald. The latter, in 1875, handed over to the trustees the
sum of one thousand two hundred pounds in Government bonds to
perpetuate his grandfather's bounty.</p>
<p>Richard Fitzgerald died at the age of sixty-eight years, on
25th May, 1840. The Fitzgerald vault will be found to the
north-west of the church in St. Matthew's cemetery, not far from
the well-known vault of Andrew Thompson. Mrs. Richard Fitzgerald
died 12th May, 1833, at the age of fifty-three years.</p>
<p>Robert Fitzgerald, the only son to reach manhood, was born in
Windsor on 1st June, 1807. The family had built, about the
thirties, what in those days was considered a fine mansion in
George Street, the building being now known as the Royal Hotel.
In this building be entertained at times on a lavish scale. The
building contains an artistic cedar circular staircase, such as
is seldom seen outside the old world mansions. The extensive cool
cellar accommodation, with a unique leaden, sloped and drained
table for bacon curing, shows us that the pioneers knew how to
build for comfort and for the protection of their food in summer.
A secret strong room in the thick walls doubtless served as a
hiding place for the family valuables in those pre-banking days.
There is a rose tree in front of the hotel, facing Thompson's
Square, planted by Miss Mary Fitzgerald sixty years ago, and
still growing vigorously. In the dining-room there is a drawing
of the good old ship <i>Lady Kennoway</i>, done in 1827; also a
signed engraving of Governor Fitzroy. These pictures would make a
welcome addition to the Mitchell Library. This building was
occupied as a mess-room for officers of the regiments stationed
in Windsor for some years.</p>
<p>Robert Fitzgerald will long be remembered in connection with
the elections of 1843, when he was defeated by William Bowman, of
Richmond, by the narrow majority of a single vote. He was well
supported in Windsor, Francis Beddek, the well-known solicitor,
being his hon. secretary, and James Hale, of "Fairfield", his
chairman. Both the candidates were appointed the following year
as local magistrates, while Robert Fitzgerald was appointed a
member of the Legislative Council in the year 1849.</p>
<p>He acquired large station properties in Queensland, as well as
"Dabee", near Rylstone, and "Tongay", near Mudgee.</p>
<p>He was a good supporter of the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society,
being president from 1848 to 1853, and a trustee for twenty-four
years, up to the time of his death, when he was succeeded in that
office by his son, Robert Marsden Fitzgerald, of "Dabee",
Rylstone, who also held the office till his death, in 1909.
Father and eon thus held office as trustee for sixty-seven
years.</p>
<p>The Hon. Robert Fitzgerald took an interest in St. Matthew's
Church, There are six tablets on the walls in memory of different
members of the family. One in memory of Captain W.H. Blake, R.N.,
a son-in-law, contains a lengthy historical record of his naval
experiences. This interesting tablet is said to contain upwards
of three thousand five hundred letters. The plain "M.F., 1857"
tablet in the porch is in memory of a daughter, Mary Fitzgerald,
who was thrown from her horse and killed in Sydney, at the age of
fourteen years. Ho gave the sum of one hundred pounds in 1857 for
church improvements.</p>
<p>Robert Fitzgerald married Miss E.H. Rouse, of Rouse Hill. He
died, at the age of fifty-eight years, on 9th May, 1865, and is
buried in the large family vault in St Matthew's church-yard.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Dr. Thomas Arndell.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Arndell came out with Captain Phillip as Assistant
Surgeon with the First Fleet in 1788. He had charge of one
hundred convicts on the ship <i>Friendship</i>. He was given
charge of the hospital at Parramatta from 1790 to 1792 or later,
with a local grant of seventy acres of land.</p>
<p>Having applied in July, 1792, for permission to retire, he did
so on 30th June, 1795, at the age of forty-three years, with a
pension of fifty pounds a year and another grant of sixty acres
of land. He also obtained a further grant from Governor Hunter at
Dundas Place.</p>
<p>In the year 1796 one of Dr. Arndell's sons was sent to Norfolk
Island in the <i>Supply</i> as a medical assistant.</p>
<p>In 1798 Dr. Balmain recommended Dr. Arndell for the position
of apothecary, with a small salary in addition to his
pension.</p>
<p>Dr. Arndell and the Rev. Samuel Marsden were appointed by
Governor Hunter in the year 1798 to enquire into the grievances
of the early settlers, and to report on the same. They were also
called upon to report as to the morals of the community the same
year.</p>
<p>In a return made in 1801, Dr. Arndell appears as owner of two
hundred and thirty-one acres of land, being Crown grants from
Governor Phillip, Lieut.-Gov. Grose, and Governor Hunter, and
three hundred and thirty acres acquired by purchase from
settlers; and also having as stock fifty sheep, twenty bogs, six
cattle, and four horses. In 1805 he had two hundred and
seventy-six sheep.</p>
<p>On June 14th, 1804, Governor King gave him a grant of six
hundred acres of land at the junction of Cattai (there were
various early spellings of this name, see Chapter V.) Creek and
Hawkesbury River, where be made his permanent home, and where
some of his descendants live to the present day.</p>
<p>It is strange to find there is no street called after him in
Windsor, as nearly all the other pioneers, except clergymen, have
streets bearing their names.</p>
<p>As early as 1799 Dr. Arndell had been made a magistrate at
Parramatta, and in 1802 we find him appointed to this office at
the Hawkesbury, to assist the Rev. S. Marsden and Mr. C. Grimes,
the Deputy Surveyor, who also resided in the district.</p>
<p>On 23rd March, 1806, there was a great flood in the
Hawkesbury, which rose ten feet higher than the flood of 1801 and
reached to within eighteen inches of Dr. Am dell's home at
"Catty". The Governor appointed a commission, consisting of Dr.
Arndell, Rev. S. Marsden, and Mr. N. Bailey, to visit and report
concerning the damage done by this flood, and afford relief where
necessary. They reported the loss of wheat, maize, barley, live
stock, and buildings valued at &pound;35,248, in addition to the
loss of seven lives.</p>
<p>In the year 1806 we find that for some reason Dr. Arndell's
pension was stopped, but owing to representations made to the
Home Office, it was restored in 1812, and arrears to the amount
of three hundred pounds were paid. In making tins application,
Governor Macquarie paid a high tribute to the sterling character
and worth as a public citizen of Dr. Arndell.</p>
<p>We find Dr. Arndell's name attached to an address of loyalty
to Governor Bligh on 20th January, 1807, drawn up at the
residence of Andrew Thompson in Windsor&mdash;or Green Hills,
rather. His name also appears as one of the pall-bearers at
Andrew Thompson's funeral on 25th October, 1810.</p>
<p>Dr. Arndell's descendants have been for several generations
closely connected with the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, and
although not closely connected with the public affairs of the
district, yet the family has always been highly esteemed.</p>
<p>His death is thus reported in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 5th
May, 1821:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Died on Wednesday night last (2nd May), at his residence at
Caddie Creek, on the bank of the Hawkesbury River, Thomas
Arndell, Esq., after a painful illness of five weeks. This
gentleman came to these shores with the First Fleet in 1788, as a
surgeon, and for a number of years held the high and responsible
situation of a magistrate in the town of Windsor. He had exceeded
his seventieth year, and has died much lamented."</p>
<p>His executors were Thomas Arndell, "Caddie", and Simeon Lord,
Sydney.</p>
<p>The funeral service was conducted in St. Matthew's Church,
Windsor, by the Rev. S. Marsden, on Sunday, 6th May, 1821. An
unfortunate disturbance was made by a settler from Portland Head,
named Doyle, during this service in the church, for which he got
three months in gaol.</p>
<p>The following is the inscription on the vault containing his
remains, which will be found surrounded by those of other
pioneers in the south-west portion of the graveyard:&mdash;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Dr. Jas. Mileham.</strong></p>
<p>Surgeon James Mileham arrived in the <i>Ganges</i>, 2nd June,
1797, and was employed at Parramatta, Newcastle, and Sydney up
till the year 1811. In the year 1807 he was appointed as third
Assistant Surgeon in the colony.</p>
<p>In the upheaval of 1808 he was one of the anti-Bligh
party.</p>
<p>He came to the Hawkesbury as Government Surgeon about the year
1811, and lived on the river bank near Baker Street.</p>
<p>He received the appointment of Magistrate for Pitt Town on 8th
June, 1811, and for Wilberforce 1815-20, and he also formed one
of the bench of three magistrates who sat weekly in Windsor to
decide cases for all the surrounding districts.</p>
<p>As in the case of other pioneers, a Windsor street is named
after him.</p>
<p>He was present at the laying of the foundation stone of St.
Matthew's Church in 1817, and also at the inauguration of the
Benevolent Society the following year.</p>
<p>Dr. Mileham visited England in 1818-19.</p>
<p>He received a grant of seven hundred acres in Illawarra on
24th January, 1817.</p>
<p>His first wife, Elizabeth Mileham, died in Windsor on 15th
July, 1818, aged fifty-seven years. They had a daughter, Lucy,
who was married in St. John's, Parramatta, to Mr. S. Hassall in
1819. He married a second time, a daughter of Henry Kable, of
Windsor, who came out in the First Fleet, and is buried in St.
Matthew's church-yard.</p>
<p>Dr. Mileham retired on a pension on 1st August, 1821. He died
in Pitt Street, Sydney, in 1824. Mrs. Mileham survived him for
over sixty years.</p>
<p>The following description of his grave is
interesting:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Lieutenant A. Bell.</strong></p>
<p>Ensign A. Bell arrived in New South Wales in the ship
<i>William and Ann</i> with the 103rd Regiment in 1803. He was
promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1807, and was afterwards
attached to the Royal Veteran Company. He took part in the arrest
of Governor Bligh in 1808, and was recalled to England as a
witness in the Bligh-Johnston case, being absent for three and a
half years, returning to New South Wales in 1812.</p>
<p>From an article in the <i>Stock and Station Journal</i>, May,
1895, we learn that Bell had a grant of land fronting the Tank
Stream in Sydney, which he exchanged for land nearer the
Government House, part of which is now the site of Parliament
House, in Macquarie Street. Owing to his absence in England at
the time, his title to this site was not made clear, and
litigation followed. As late as 1870 Bell's heirs received
compensation to the amount of one thousand pounds, but not the
unearned increment of this land.</p>
<p>It appears that Lieut. Bell was appointed a magistrate at the
Hawkesbury in 1807, but he either resigned or refused to hold
office, when Andrew Thompson was appointed in 1810. Governor
Macquarie, in giving reasons why Messrs. Bell and Palmer refused
to hold such office says that "Bell retired to his estate near
Richmond."</p>
<p>Lieut. Bell was appointed a member of the Legislature on 25th
September, 1832.</p>
<p>He acted as Barrack Master in Sydney in 1818, but this must
have been a temporary appointment, for he was in charge of the
military at Windsor from 1813 to 1818. In 1820 he was
re-appointed as a magistrate, and held office until 1834. For the
greater part of this period he acted as Police Magistrate at
Windsor, being the first paid magistrate in the district, and
having associated with him on the Bench Captain J. Brabyn and
William Cox. He was succeeded as Police Magistrate in 1835 by
Samuel North. For a part of this time Lieut. Bell resided in the
old Government House at Windsor, as well as at Belmont. Governor
Macquarie addressed him on 26th January, 1820, as "Lieut. A.
Bell, Magistrate for Cumberland, 'Belmont', District of
Richmond."</p>
<p>Lieut. Bell's name appears as one of the founders of the
Hawkesbury Benevolent Society in 1818.</p>
<p>Some years after Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth discovered
the road to the plains over the Blue Mountains (1813), a son of
Lieut. Bell discovered another road over the Kurrajong Mountain,
known to the present day as Bell's Line, opening out towards
Wallerawang. According to Barron Field, the date of the discovery
of this new road was after 1822.</p>
<p>Mount Bell, and probably Bell on the western railway line,
near Mount Victoria, are named after the family. Bell Street,
Newtown (Windsor), is also a reminder of his early connection
with the town.</p>
<p>Archd. Bell, junior, also discovered a track to Patrick
Plains, in the Hunter River district, and found and relieved
Singleton and his party in that district. Tor these discoveries
Bell received a grant on the Hunter River, which he named
"Corinda".</p>
<p>Although his name does not appear in the list of those present
at the laying of the foundation stone or the opening of St.
Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor, yet we find, in reply to
certain questions asked of leading colonists in 1820, as to the
state of religion in 1810, Lieut. Bell says: "I believe my family
were the only ones laying claim to respectability who attended
Divine service at this place (Windsor). The attendance seldom
exceeded thirty. Now, in 1820," he says, "several churches in the
district are well-filled, and almost every respectable family are
pretty general in attendance."</p>
<p>In 1830 we find Lieut. Bell still a seat-holder, occupying pew
No. 3 on south side of St. Matthew's. His brother officer,
Captain Brabyn, occupied No. 2 pew. He was not a narrow-minded
man, for we find him presiding at a Wesleyan missionary meeting
in 1828.</p>
<p>The fine property known as "Belmont", on the Hawkesbury,
opposite to Richmond, originally consisted of a number of small
holdings, which ware purchased and consolidated by Lieut. A.
Bell. In his time the tide, which now comes up only as far as
Windsor, came right up to Belmont.</p>
<p>Lieut. Bell died about the year 1837, and his grave, with that
of his wife and a granddaughter, may be seen on the Belmont
estate in a clump of old oleander trees, on a hill between the
homestead and the main road. His son, James Thomas Bell,
continued to reside on the Belmont estate, and was a local
magistrate 1839 to 1844. The property afterwards passed into the
hands of Henry Newcomen, who was also a district magistrate from
1867 up to his death, at the age of sixty-one, on 10th October,
1884.</p>
<p>The Belmont property was subsequently purchased by Major
Philip Charley in 1891, and he has made many valuable
improvements, including the erection in 1893 of the fine
residence "Belmont House". A portion of the old original
fortified home occupied by Lieut. Bell may still be seen in one
corner of the ground. When the old house was being demolished in
1892, a letter was found in one of the ceilings, dated 22nd
March, 1831, addressed to Lieut. Bell.</p>
<p>According to a census return taken in 1818, we find that
Lieut. Bell had a family of nine children, as
follow:&mdash;Maria, Francis, and Eliza, who came to the colony
in 1803 with their parents; those born in New South Wales being
Mary Ann, Archibald, Matilda, Sophia Rebecca, and James Thomas.
Two other children, infants, died in 1809 and 1817 respectively.
One daughter married Captain John Fennell, A.D.C. to Governor
Brisbane. He died in Bathurst in July, 1826. Another daughter,
Sophia Hume Bell, married H.P. Dutton, on 17th August, 1833. A
third daughter, Elizabeth, married George Cox, the fourth son of
William Cox, senior.</p>
<p>"To attempt to follow out the ramifications of the Bells and
Coxs in Australia would be a herculean task. William Cox, of
Clarendon, and Archie Bell, of Belmont, were men of intense
physical force. They were strong men physically, and their
progeny is all over Australia. One of the Bells of Pickering said
that he could ride from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Sydney and
hardly sleep one night out of the house of a relative."&mdash;
<i>Memoirs of William Cox</i>, page 137.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Captain John Brabyn.</strong></p>
<p>Among the pioneers of Windsor a place must be found for
Captain John Brabyn, whose name was given at an early date to one
of Windsor's cross streets, near the railway station. He arrived,
an ensign of the 102nd Regiment, on 12th February, 1796, in the
good ship <i>Marquis Cornwallis</i>, after which Cornwallis
flats, on the banks of the Hawkesbury River, were probably
named.</p>
<p>Ensign Brabyn appears to have gone the same year to Norfolk
Island, where he obtained a grant of land, and where he remained
four or five years. His military appointments were as
follows:&mdash;1795, May 6, Ensign 102nd Regiment; 1800, August
15, Lieutenant 102nd Regiment; 1806, Lieutenant New South Wales
Corps; 1808, February 11, Captain New South Wales Corps; 1811,
February 5, Captain New South Wales Royal Veteran Company.</p>
<p>Lieut. Brabyn's name appears in 1801-1806 as stationed at
Parramatta, and also as holding landed estates in 1804 in the
Hawkesbury district. In the year 1808 he took part in the arrest
and trial of Governor Bligh, and the same year he was made a
J.P.</p>
<p>We next find Captain Brabyn, on 26th of December, 1808, in
charge of the settlement at Port Dalrymple, Launceston
(Tasmania), where he remained about two years. He was then
recalled to New South Wales and ordered home to England as a
witness in the Bligh case. He remained there about three and a
half years, returning to New South Wales about the year 1813.</p>
<p>In the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 12th May, 1810, there appears
a notice of the sale of his "York Place" farm, at Windsor,
extending to the Chain of Ponds; also the house "York Lodge".
This, which is one of the historic houses of Windsor appears to
have passed into the hands of Charles Clark in 1810, and is
described as formerly the property of Captain Brabyn and Captain
Moore. In 1821 we find Captain Brabyn's name as a wheat producer
in the Windsor district.</p>
<p>From the proceedings of the Committee of the Clergy and School
Corporation, dated July, 1828, we find that a cottage, formerly
occupied by the Rev. M.D. Meares, was sold to Captain Brabyn for
four hundred and fifty pounds. (See Lot 65 on Plan of Windsor,
1835.) The correspondence (see Chapter VII.) concerning the sale
was carried on by the Rev. William Cowper, Archdeacon T.H. Scott,
and the Rev. Samuel Marsden, and doubtless refers to "York
Lodge", for in the Post Office Directory for 1835 his name
appears as Captain Brabyn, "York Cottage". The old house still
stands in George Street, not far from Brabyn Street. In the
forties a relative, Josiah Allan Betts, lived in the cottage, and
here Mr. E.M. Betts, of Hunter's Hill, was born.</p>
<p>After his return from the Old Country we find Captain Brabyn
first at Parramatta. In the year 1817 he was appointed Magistrate
for Wilberforce, in lieu of the Rev. R. Cartwright, who resigned,
after holding the position for several years. Captain Brabyn held
office at the Wilberforce Court till 1820, and also sat at
Windsor, with Lieut. Bell and William Cox, until the year
1829.</p>
<p>Captain Brabyn took an active part in the foundation of the
Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, being on the committee in 1819.
His name does not appear in connection with the laving of the
foundation stone of St. Matthew's Church in 1817, or the opening
in 1822, but he was a seat-holder, pew No. 2, south side, in the
year 1830.</p>
<p>One of his daughters married Peter Mills, surveyor at Port
Dalrymple, about 1810. Another, Mary Louisa, married J. Gaggin,
Government storekeeper, on 8th October, 1822, and they resided in
the old cottage still standing next the Royal Hotel, in George
Street, Windsor. One John Gaggin had charge of the rapidly
increasing herd of cattle belonging to the Benevolent Society
from 1827 to 1832. A third daughter, Elizabeth Howard Brabyn,
married Charles Simeon Marsden, on 18th June, 1828. He died at
"Mature", South Creek, on 27th September, 1868. A daughter of
this marriage was Mrs. Martha Brabyn Shadlow, who died at
Badgery's Creek, near Penrith, in 1913, aged seventy-seven.</p>
<p>Captain Brabyn died, aged seventy-six, in 1835, and was buried
in the south-east corner of St. Matthew's church-yard, near the
large new Tebbutt vault. The inscription on the vault is still
decipherable, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF</small><br>
<br>
CAP<small><sup>TN</sup></small> JOHN BRABYN<br>

<br>
Aged 76 Years.</small></p>
<blockquote>His late years were principally devoted to the
interests of the poor of the Surrounding Districts, and in whom
they have lost a kind Benefactor and his family an affectionate
Husband, Parent, &amp; Friend.</blockquote>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Rev. John Youl.</strong></p>
<p>Rev. John Youl sailed from England in December, 1798. He was
captured by the French and returned to England <i>via</i> Lisbon,
arriving back on 12th October, 1799. He sailed again for the
South Seas on 5th May, 1800. He arrived in Sydney in the <i>Royal
Admiral</i> in November, 1800. He remained here for some months.
In a letter, dated 28th May, 1801, he complains of the depravity
of Sydney and Parramatta.</p>
<p>He continued his voyage, arriving in Tahiti on 10th July,
1801, where he remained until 1807, when he left for Port
Jackson, and severed his connection with the London Missionary
Society. It should be noticed that he was not one of the "Duff"
party of missionaries that arrived from Tahiti in the
<i>Nautilus</i> on 14th May, 1798, of whom Roland Hassall (who
died 20th August, 1820) was one.</p>
<p>In the year 1809 we find that he was connected with the
Ebenezer Presbyterian Church at Portland Head, and the same year
he applied for the position of schoolmaster at that place,
stating he was about to be married&mdash;that being one of the
conditions necessary for the position. He appears to have
obtained the position, and agreed to permit clergymen of other
denominations to preach in the church when in the district and
available (see Chapter VIII.). He also acted as assistant
chaplain at Windsor, and complained to the Rev. William Cowper
that the church was being used as a court house in 1810. The same
year he urged that something should be done for the aboriginal
population of the district.</p>
<p>In 1810 he took part, along with John Bowman, Richard Ridge,
John Howe, and others, in arranging a public demonstration in
connection with the departure of Governor Bligh, but the public
meeting was not held.</p>
<p>Rev. J. Youl was acting-chaplain at Liverpool in 1816, and
went to Tasmania before or about the year 1817, and built the
first church&mdash;St. John's&mdash;in Launceston. He returned to
New South Wales in 1823, but was back again in Port Dalrymple or
Launceston in 1825, and there he died in March, 1827. His wife,
Jane Youl, died in 1817.</p>
<p>Dr. Youl, who held the office of coroner in Melbourne for many
years, was a son. Sir James Arndell Youl, of Tasmania, was
another son. He married, in 1838, Eliza Cox, born 1817, at
"Hobartville", Richmond. It was he who first introduced salmon
and trout into the Tasmanian rivers, and sent the ova to New
Zealand. He also acted as agent for the Tasmanian Government in
London.</p>
<p>We note that this Tasmanian peer was doubly connected with
Windsor. His name, "Arndell", evidently goes back to the days
when his father was at Ebenezer, and again by his marriage into
the Cox family, of "Hobartville".</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Rev. Henry Fulton.</strong></p>
<p>The Rev. Henry Fulton, of Killahoe, Ireland, arrived in New
South Wales 11th January, 1800, in the ship <i>Minerva</i>, as a
political exile, having agreed to transport himself to Botany Bay
for life owing to being involved in the 1798 uprising in Ireland.
He first visited the Hawkesbury in November, 1800, when,
according to a <i>Gazette</i> notice, he conducted what was
probably his first divine service in the district. An application
for a chaplain for Norfolk Island led Governor King to send him
there in 1801, and here he received a conditional pardon for
exemplary conduct and great propriety, and was directed to
perform divine service. His appointment as chaplain was approved,
at the full salary of ninety-six pounds a year, and confirmed by
Lord Hobart in 1803.</p>
<p>In 1806 he was recalled to Sydney to take the position of
acting-chaplain during the absence of Rev. Samuel Marsden in
England in 1807-9. The same year he was emancipated and pardoned
by Governor King. He arrived back in Sydney with his wife and
three children, on 7th May, 1806, and the next year his name
appears as having land under cultivation in New South Wales.</p>
<p>He was the friend of Governor Bligh, and took his part in the
troubles of 1808. Fulton was suspended (on 26th January, 1808)
from office by Major Johnston, for introducing a prayer for the
Governor into the liturgy. He was also obliged to remove, with
his family, from the barracks into a private house in Sydney. Mr.
Crook, a missionary, was appointed to preach and baptise, while
marriages were to be performed by Mr. G. Grimes, Captain Kemp,
and Ensign A. Bell. Governor Bligh meantime appointed Rev. Henry
Fulton as his private chaplain, on 28th January, 1809. The same
year he wrote several letters to the Secretary of State with
reference to the arrest of Bligh. He was reinstated into his
public chaplaincy on 7th January, 1810, a week after Governor
Macquarie's arrival, and we find him holding such office the same
year, with a salary of two hundred and sixty pounds per
annum.</p>
<p>Rev. Henry Fulton was taken to England by Governor Bligh as a
witness in his case, sailing 10th August, 1810, in the ship
<i>Hindostan</i>.</p>
<p>In 1814 he accepted the office of second chaplain to
Hawkesbury District, and in addition was appointed, from 1815 to
1820, or later, Magistrate at Castlereagh.</p>
<p>His name appears amongst those taking part in the laying of
the foundation stone of St. Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor,
in 1817.</p>
<p>The Hawkesbury parish was divided about this time, and we find
him in charge of the parish of Castlereagh and Penrith during the
years 1825-40. He had a school in Castlereagh in 1826.</p>
<p>He obtained a grant of four hundred acres of land in the Evan
district on 31st August, 1819, in addition to a former grant of
sis hundred acres on 16th October, 1816.</p>
<p>His family in 1816 consisted of three daughters&mdash;Sarah,
Lydia, and Ann&mdash;and two sons&mdash;John and Henry. He died
on 16th November, 1840, in the Penrith district, where several of
his descendants still live.</p>
<p>In a paper read before the Historical Society by Mr. W.
Freame, on 26th November, 1907, on "Historical Burial Places", he
mentioned that Chaplain Fulton was supposed to be buried in the
McHenry vault in the Castlereagh Anglican cemetery, his daughter
having married into that family.</p>
<p>At the recent centenary of the town of Penrith a tablet to the
memory of Rev. Henry Fulton was placed in St. Stephen's Church,
inscribed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>To the glory of God, and in memory
of</small><br>
<br>
REV. HENRY FULTON, B.A.,<br>
<br>
<small>First Incumbent of this Church,<br>
<br>
Who died November 16th, 1840.<br>
<br>
Erected by his descendants on the occasion of the 75th
anniversary of the Church, 1914.</small></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Rev. Robert Cartwright.</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the visit to England of the Senior Chaplain
(Rev. S. Marsden), two clergymen were induced to come out to New
South Wales in the ship <i>Indispensable</i>, which arrived on
the 18th August, 1809; and the Ann, which arrived 27th February,
1810. These were the Rev. William Cowper, and the Rev. Robert
Cartwright. They were therefore among the earliest regular clergy
in New South Wales, following the Rev. R. Johnson and S. Marsden.
The Revs. II. Fulton and J. Youl were also then in the colony,
but were not chaplains.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival, with his wife and six children and two
servants, Rev. R. Cartwright was appointed to Windsor, on 15th
September, 1810, at a salary of two hundred and forty pounds per
annum, where he remained until December, 1819, his next
appointment being to Liverpool, 1820-36, and then to St. James's,
Sydney, to succeed Rev. Richard Hill, where he remained till
1838, finally moving to Collector (Gunning), where he remained
until his death, in 1856. Mrs. Cartwright predeceased him in
1837.</p>
<p>A glance at the period of his residence in Windsor shows that
he can truly be called one of its founders, and the builder of
the Church of England, for he was present at the meeting (1811)
to build the original church in Bridge Street, and also took part
in laying the second foundation stone of the present St.
Matthew's, on 13th October, 1817, and was also at the opening
ceremony on 18th December, 1822. He was, therefore, the first
settled incumbent of that church, and it is of interest to notice
that it was he who officiated at the funeral of Andrew Thompson,
in October, 1810, and also preached his "In Memoriam" sermon.</p>
<p>On 8th June, 1811, Rev. R. Cartwright was appointed a
magistrate for Wilberforce, which position he held till 1817. The
same year he was also appointed, along with Dr. Mileham and
William Cox, to sit in Windsor as one of the weekly bench of
magistrates to hear cases from the whole district.</p>
<p>He was also one of the founders of the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society, in 1818, taking an active interest in it during his
residence in Windsor. His name appears as a life member in every
report from 1841 till the year of his death, in December, 1856,
long after he left the district He was the last survivor of the
originators of the Society.</p>
<p>In a census taken in Windsor in 1818 we notice that Rev. R.
Cartwright had eight children&mdash;Ann, Elizabeth, Richard,
Thomas, John, Mary, Robert and Jane. The younger ones were born
in New South Wales. Another child, William, died aged three
months, on 5th January, 1812, and in a letter dated 1830 he
mentions, in addition to the above, a son, Charles.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Cartwright was married by her father to T. W.
Fulton, a son of the Rev. Henry Fulton, on 2nd December, 1823, at
Liverpool.</p>
<p>From an old letter in the Mitchell Library, dated Liverpool,
20th September, 1830, we find that Mr. Cartwright was of the
opinion that a better site might have been procured for St.
Matthew's Church, and for which a legal title might have been
obtained. Writing of the Glebe land, evidently that at Clarendon,
he says it was part of a common to which he had an equal right
with his neighbours, as he had land adjoining. He complains that
this land was neither fenced nor cleared, and that he should not
be expected to do this work out of his private income, as it was
for the benefit of his successors as much as for himself. As
there was no parsonage house at Glebe available for him, he
mentions that he had to purchase a farm of one hundred acres at
Richmond in 1813, which was his principal establishment till he
left Windsor in 1820. The above letter was addressed to Bishop
Broughton in support of a claim for arrears of money due to the
writer.</p>
<p>He received two grants of five hundred and six hundred acres
respectively in the Evan district, near Castlereagh, on 25th
August, 1812, which he appears to have used to some advantage,
and in connection with which the following correspondence is
interesting:&mdash;</p>
<p>Letter from Rev. Robert Cartwright to Rev. Thomas
Hassall:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Windsor, February 15th, 1815.</i></p>
<p><i>Dear Sir,</i></p>
<p><i>I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken
about the wool, etc., etc. I must request you will likewise tee
the present load weighed and entered in my account with Mr.
Burnie. I have now, according to promise, sent the whole of this
year's produce. I think you will find the present quantity to be
superior to the first. I thought to have been at Sydney before
now, but have been prevented. I shall be much obliged to you if
you will procure for me a bag of sugar, a bar or two of iron, a
small quantity of rope, 4 pieces of Nankeen, 4 pieces of good
com. calico, and 36 panes of window glass 8 x 10. If Mr. Burnie
should not have these things perhaps you may get them at Marr's.
Be good enough to send me an account of them.</i></p>
<p>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right"><em>Sydney, 17th February, 1815.</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>
<p><em>The wool weighed 193lbs. It was a good sample of lamb's
wool. As Mr. B. has not seen it the price cannot be stated. He
does not allow near so much for lamb's as for fleece wool. I have
got some of the things per list enclosed, which I expect to
settle for in the course of the day. There is no iron to be
purchased in Sydney, neither window glass of the size you want.
There are some 7 x 9 at 3s. sterling a pane. As I am coming up on
Saturday next I will, if possible, bring up an account of what
Mr. B. allows for the wool. With best respects to Mrs. C., etc.,
etc.</em></p>
<p align="right"><em>T. HASSALL.</em>   </p>
<p><em>Sent from Marr's.&mdash;</em></p>

<p>The above correspondence is from Rev. J.S. Hassall's book
<i>In Old Australia</i> (1902). He quaintly adds the following
note:&mdash;"It is to be hoped that the price Mr. Cartwright got
for his wool was in due proportion to the price he had to pay for
his sugar."</p>
<p>From the same book we learn that about the year 1860 two of
the Rev. R. Cartwright's boos were settled on a property,
"Windellema", in the Bungonia parish, near Goulburn.</p>
<p>The Rev. E. Cartwright died in 1856, and was buried in St.
Luke's cemetery, Liverpool. The following is the inscription on
his tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following notice of his death is taken from the files of
the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, December, 1856:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Died from the effects of bronchitis in his 86th
year, on Sunday, the 14th instant, at his residence, Goulburn,
the Rev. Robert Cartwright, for forty six years a chaplain of the
Colony. His friends and the clergy of the Church of England are
informed that his remains will be interred in the family vault at
Liverpool on Saturday, the 20th instant."</blockquote>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>William Cox.</strong></p>
<p>William Cox was born at Devizes (Wilts, Eng.), in December,
1764. He joined the British Army, and served in the French wars.
He was appointed an Ensign, in the 68th Durham Regiment on 17th
January, 1796, and Lieutenant of the New South Wales Corps on
28th September, 1797, and Paymaster 28th September, 1798.</p>
<p>The date of his first visit to the colony has been the subject
of some debate, but it appears he came out about the year 1797,
with his regiment in charge of some prisoners, and returned again
with the ship. He subsequently came out in the ship
<i>Minerva</i>, the same voyage as she brought the Irish rebel
party, arriving on 11th January, 1800.</p>
<p>He was appointed a magistrate at Parramatta in 1801, but the
appointment was cancelled the following year by Governor King, as
Cox was engaged in farming, which was not permitted by the
magistracy at that time.</p>
<p>During the year 1801 he had acquired by purchase one thousand
three hundred acres of land, four hundred of which were cleared,
and two hundred and forty-five acres under crop. At the same time
he was the owner of twenty-five horses, twenty cattle, one
thousand sheep, and two hundred pigs, and had twenty convicts
assigned to him as labourers. His property was known as "Brush
Farm", situated near Ryde, a portion of which he had bought from
the Rev. R. Johnson, including some fine orange trees and one
hundred and fifty sheep.</p>
<p>His connection with the Hawkesbury district dates from 1804,
when he became a settler, having purchased the same year some
sheep from Captain Water house, of H.M.S. <i>Reliance</i>. The
same year he was appointed one of the trustees of Ham Common.</p>
<p>During the year 1809-10 he visited England, and whilst there
bought a commission as ensign in the army for his son William. He
was appointed Chief Magistrate for the Hawkesbury in December,
1810, in succession to Andrew Thompson (deceased), and at whose
funeral both he and his son acted as pall-bearers. His
appointment appears to have given great satisfaction to the local
residents, who, in an address of welcome to Governor Macquarie on
his visit to the district, took occasion to specially thank him
for appointing William Cox, Esq., as magistrate, referring to him
as "a gentleman who for many years has resided amongst us,
possessing our esteem and confidence, who from his local
knowledge of this settlement, combined with his many other good
qualities, will, we are convinced, promote your Excellency's
benign intention of distributing justice and happiness to all."
This address was signed by Dr. Arndell, Thomas Hobby, and about
one hundred other leading settlers.</p>
<p>In the year 1811 William Cox was appointed, along with Rev. B.
Cartwright and Dr. James Mileham, to form a special weekly bench
of magistrates to decide cases from the whole district. About
this time he built "Clarendon House" on his estate between
Windsor and Richmond, a portion of which is still standing in
1915.</p>
<p>In the year 1814 Governor Macquarie asked William Cox to
undertake the construction of the newly-surveyed road across the
Blue Mountains, which he did, starting work at Emu Plains on 18th
July, 1814, completing it on the 21st January, 1815. The complete
diary of this work was published many years ago, entitled
<i>Narrative of Proceedings, 1814-15, by William Cox</i>. The
well-known mountain stream, Cox's River, was named after him by
Governor Macquarie on 29th April, 1815.</p>
<p>He was present at the inaugural meeting of the Hawkesbury
Benevolent Society in 1818-19. He was a seat-holder in St.
Matthew's Anglican Church in 1830, occupying pew No. 1, south
side, while his son, William Cox, junior, had pew No. 1, north
side. The Cox servants occupied pew No. 5 on the north side. A
street in Windsor and Newtown, parallel to George Street, is
named Cox Street. This street adjoins the grant of sixty acres to
Henry Cox in 1804.</p>
<p>The Hon. William Walker wrote an account of this old family,
which appeared in the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, 28th
January, 1896. Mr. Alfred Cox also published his Recollections in
1886. See also Burke's <i>Colonial Gentry</i>, vol. II., for full
particulars of the family.</p>
<p>The Cox family are now widely scattered, branches being known
in or associated with Tasmania, Mudgee, Mulgoa, and Muswellbrook.
None of the family reside here now, but at one time there was
quite a number of the Cox family in the Hawkesbury. They occupied
"Hobartville", which passed to Andrew Town in the seventies;
"Fairfield", to James Hale in the forties; "Clarendon", to Arthur
Dight, 1862; "Claremont", to Francis Beddek in the twenties.</p>
<p>The following members of the family were appointed magistrates
in this district:&mdash;William Cox, 1810-36; William Cox,
junior, "Hobartville", 1830-47; George Cox, Mulgoa (married Miss
E. Bell), 1830-52; Edward Cox, "Fern Hill", Mulgoa, 1834-52
(married Miss J.M. Brooke); Henry Cox, "Glenmore", Penrith,
1835-44 (married Miss F. Mackenzie); Alfred Cox, 1851-52; William
Cox, junior, II., "Wybong", Muswellbrook, 1844-52; Sloper Cox,
Richmond, 1865-74. We mid that Sloper Cox was baptised in St.
Matthew's Church of England by Rev. John Cross, on 24th August,
1824. After this registration Mr. Joseph Harpur, the parish
clerk, makes the following entry:&mdash;"Captain Robert Sloper
Piper, Royal Engineers; Captain John Fennell, 48th Regiment; Miss
Fanny Bell and Miss Mary Ann Bell were sponsors for Sloper Cox.
Born at 'Hobart Villa,' 13th December, 1823."</p>
<p>The following members of the family were life members of the
Hawkesbury Benevolent Society in 1841:&mdash;Edward, George,
Henry and William Cox.</p>
<p>William Cox was married first to Miss R. Upjohn, of London, on
1st February, 1789, she died in 1819; family&mdash;William, of
"Hobartville;" James, of Tasmania; Charles, killed in New Zealand
by natives; George Henry, of "Glenmore;" Frederick Edward, of
Mulgoa, afterwards an M.L.C. The second wife was Miss Anna
Blachford (a sister of Mrs. Francis Beddek), to whom Mr. Cox was
married in 1821. Family:&mdash;Edgar, Thomas, Alfred, and Anna
Clarendon.</p>
<p>The subject of this sketch died on 15th March, 1837, at
"Fairfield", Windsor, to which property he had removed from
"Clarendon" in 1833. He was buried in St. Matthew's cemetery, in
the south-east corner, close to several other pioneers. The
inscription on the vault reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>Here lieth entombed the remains
of</small><br>
<br>
MRS. REBECCA COX,<br>
<small>Wife of William Cox, Esq., of Clarendon,<br>
Who departed this life the 3d [? 5th] March, 1819.<br>
<br>
Aged 56 years.<br>
<br>
In testimony of the exalted virtues that adorn her character not
only as a Wife and a Mother but in all the other relative duties
of life this tomb is erected to perpetuate her memory by her
affectionate Husband.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here also lie the Remains of</small><br>
<br>
WILLIAM COX, ESQ<sup><small>r.,</small></sup> J.P.,<br>
<br>
<small>Who departed this life the 15th day of March, 1837, Aged
72 years.</small></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Not by Works of Righteousness

<small>US</small>.<br>
<br>
Reader, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
saved.</p>
<p>There is another and a larger Cox vault in St. Peter's
church-yard, Richmond, where many of the oldest members of the
family are interred.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>John Dight.</strong></p>
<p>Amongst the pioneers of the district we must find a place for
John Dight, who was born in the year 1772, and came to New South
Wales with his wife, Hannah Dight, in 1801, and settled in the
Hawkesbury district. His name appears in December, 1810, in an
address of welcome to Governor Macquarie from this district. He
was appointed coroner for the district by Governor Darling in
1828, and held that office up to the time of his death, at the
age of sixty-five years, in the year 1837. Mrs. Dight died in
1862, at the age of eighty-one. The family were:&mdash;George
(who died in 1851, aged 41); Mary (died 1819); Sarah (died 1832);
Arthur, the youngest son, was born on the 6th June, 1819. He
purchased the Clarendon property from Charles Clarendon Cox in
1862, and made a comfortable home there for many years till the
death of his wife, at the age of forty-seven years, on 25th
September, 1888. Mr. Arthur Dight was interested in the station
properties, "Yendah" and "Windah", in Queensland.</p>
<p>He entered Parliament in 1869 as the representative of
Windsor. The Municipal Council named a new street alongside the
Public School as Dight Street, in his honour. He died at. Darling
Point, Sydney, on 31st July, 1895, leaving a large family. Three
of his sisters survived him&mdash;Mrs. Watson (England), Mrs.
Sharp and Miss Sophie Dight, of Yass; and Mrs. Hamilton Hume, of
Yass, was another sister.</p>
<p>There are several other pioneer families we would like to have
mentioned at length, such as the Bowman, Pitt, Faithfull, Rouse,
Hassall, and other families, but although connected with the
Hawkesbury, they were not in Windsor.</p>

<h3>SOME PIONEER FAMILIES.</h3>
<p>F<small>ROM</small> an old well-preserved Windsor Muster Book,

<h3>ORIGIN OF NAMES OF STREETS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HERE</small> are about thirty streets in Windsor, and
it is of interest to trace, as far as possible, the probable
source from which they derive their names. Many of the streets
are named after the early pioneers, particulars of whom are found
elsewhere in these articles:&mdash;</p>

<h3>OLD GOVERNMENT HOUSE.</h3>
<p>T<small>WO</small> of the first questions asked by visiting
tourists and motorists to Windsor are:&mdash;"Where is the old
Government House?" "When was it built?" We shall therefore give
some account of this very old and historical, and, alas, very
dilapidated building.</p>
<p>There was another Government House earlier still, erected at
the time of the first settlement in the district. This was
reported to have been swept away by flood waters in 1799.</p>
<p>The present old structure is, we believe, the third oldest
existing building in Australasia. Elizabeth Farm House and
Experiment Cottage, near Parramatta, being built in 1793 and 1794
by Captain Macarthur and Surgeon Harris.</p>
<p>The oldest Church in Australia is Ebenezer Church, built and
opened in 1809; but this old house was built at least ten years
earlier than Ebenezer Church, for Governor Hunter, in 1798,
mentions it in a list of public buildings erected since 1796. He
refers to it as "a cottage erected for the commanding officer at
Green Hills."</p>
<p>In <i>Collins' History of N.S.W.</i>, vol. II., page 310, we
find the following: "Built a framed and weatherboard house on the
Green Hills at the Hawkesbury for the residence of the commanding
officer of that district. This house was shingled and furnished
with a cellar, a stalling kitchen and other accommodation, and
surrounded with palings."</p>
<p>It is interesting to Bee this old cellar in the present ruin,
and to note the twelve wine bins with stone shelves, so rarely
found in a modern villa; also to notice that all the fittings,
doors, windows, and weatherboards are cedar.</p>
<p>The building is of wood and plastered inside and partly
outside also. There is a good deal of brickwork in the cellar,
chimneys, steps, foundations, and in paving the back verandahs.
It is curious to note the number of different sizes in these
bricks. They are all smaller than the modern bricks. Two which
were measured go 7&frac34; x 3&frac14; x 2&frac14;, weight when
dry 3&frac34;lbs.; 8&frac12; x 4 x 2&frac12;, weight when dry
5lbs.</p>
<p>A modern brick, it may be said, measures 9&frac12; x 4&frac12;
x 2&frac34;, and weighs 8 lbs.</p>
<p>In 1806 Charles Grimes, surveyor, reported that "the
Government House is decayed and untenantable." This sounds rather
odd, as the house was then only about nine or ten years old, and
it was in tenantable order till within the last ten years.</p>
<p>Another later report mentions that the old Government cottage
had been repaired and improved, and the land, six acres, enclosed
with a fence, part of which was brick. This may refer to the very
old brick wall still seen opposite to Thompson Square, and near
to the approach to the Windsor wharf. There was a dwarf brick
wall along the end of the ground facing Thompson's Square, with a
carriage entrance in the present centre of the street, which led
up to the house.</p>
<p>On 10th November, 1815, Judge Advocate Ellis Bent, after whom
Bent Street, Sydney, is called, while on duty in Windsor, was
taken ill, and died in the old Government House. His remains were
taken to Sydney, and buried first in the old cemetery in George
Street, now the site of the Sydney Town Hall. In Macquarie's time
removed to Garden Island. Finally, in the eighties, the tomb, in
which also rested the remains of his friend, Major Ovens, who
died 1825, was transferred to St. Thomas' cemetery in North
Sydney, where the following inscription may be seen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Underneath are placed the remains of Ellis Bent,
Esq., Judge Advocate of this Territory from the first of January,
1810, to the tenth of November, 1815, when he departed this life
in his 32nd year. His upright and impartial conduct caused him to
be respected by all classes of persons, and in private life no
man possessed more than he did those qualifications which adorn
the gentleman, and by which he endeared himself to all who had
the happiness of his acquaintance."</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1824 a report was made to Governor Sir Thomas
Brisbane regarding the expenditure made on the public buildings
of Windsor and other towns during the previous year, from which
we learn that the sum of one hundred and eighteen pounds,
thirteen shillings and threepence was expended on the "Government
House" and the "Garden House", which was probably some such
adjunct as a green-house.</p>
<p>Amongst the improvements included in the above sum are two
sewers (one of brick), costing five pounds and six pounds five
shillings respectively, and draining the kitchen and lavatory to
the river, also repairs to the "dressing room" five pounds.</p>
<p>The following description accompanies the above
report:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Government Cottage:&mdash;This is on a small scale, situated
on a rising ground commanding a beautiful view from the rear of
the Hawkesbury River, and it is a desirable site for a good
public building were it not so near the town, yet from its
contiguity to the banks of this fine river, with the diversity of
richness of the soil, it might be made an enviable residence
either as a villa or a mansion."</p>
<p>In Governor Macquarie's report of the buildings made by him in
1822 he mentions a new coach house and stables connected with
Government House, Windsor. These improvements are said to have
stood on the site of the large balconied house in Thompson's
Square, near the School of Arts, and were afterwards converted
into police stables and barracks for police and prisoners. They
appear so on the plan of Windsor dated 1835.</p>
<p>The next reference we find to the old residence is that Mr.
Samuel North, the local Police Magistrate from 1829 to 1843,
lived here, and also at "Northfield", Kurrajong Heights.</p>
<p>The historical old Government House was sold at public auction
by the Crown on the 8th March, 1854, the purchaser being John
McCall, junior. The land measured two roods twelve and-a-half
perches, having a frontage of two hundred and twelve links to
George Street, and two hundred and twenty-nine links to the
river.</p>
<p>The old stable and coach house site at the corner was sold the
same date to Mr. J.J. Kettle, except the allotment at the corner
next the Windsor wharf in Thompson Square, which had been granted
for a Manse site to the Presbyterian Church in 1851.</p>
<p>On this corner site, which was originally a portion of Andrew
Thompson's estate, Dr. Dowe built the present large balconied
house, probably in the late fifties. It was afterwards in use as
a school by the Rev. C.F. Garnsey, in the sixties, before his
appointment as Rector of St Matthew's, in 1867. Mrs. C.J. Nealds
had a ladies' school here in the seventies. It was then occupied
as a. school by Mr. B. Keenan until he built the Grammar School
in-1884, on the Penrith road. The place was afterwards occupied
by the Hall family <i>pere et fils</i>.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER VII.</p>
<h3>THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first divine services held at the
Hawkesbury were conducted by the Rev. Samuel Marsden, who arrived
in 1794.</p>
<p>In the year 1805 a two-storied school-church, measuring one
hundred feet by twenty-four feet, was built by the residents on
the north bank of South Creek, near the site of the first bridge,
which stood at the back of the Court House in a line with
Catherine Street. In this building several missionaries preached,
including Messrs. Harris, Crook, and Rowland Hassall; also the
Rev. John Youl and the Senior Chaplain, the Rev. Samuel Marsden,
on his periodical visits to the Green Hills, and the Rev. Henry
Fulton, who took the Rev. Samuel Marsden's place during his visit
to England in 1808-9.</p>
<p>We might here state that although the Rev. S. Marsden did not
reside permanently in Windsor, he was a property owner there. He
had a grant of fifty acres on the South Creek to which he
apparently added by purchase other lands, now portion of the
town. About the year 1817 he presented to the local Wesleyan
Church the site of their property in Macquarie Street, then a
part of his farm. On the occasion of his visit to England in 1807
the inhabitants of the Hawkesbury presented him with a
testimonial. He it was who preached at the opening of St
Matthew's in 1822, and he also preached here in 1833, and
doubtless visited the district very frequently. It was also in
the local rectory whilst on a visit to his friend, the Rev. H.T.
Stiles, M.A., that he died, on 12th May. 1833, at the age of
seventy-three years. The burial took place in the old cemetery of
St. John's, Parramatta, of which he was then the incumbent on
15th May.</p>
<p>This original church building will be seen on an old plan of
Windsor, dated 1827, and marked as Government stables, formerly
school-house, and particulars as to its erection and maintenance
will be found in the <i>Historical Records</i>, vol. V., p.p.
412-13, 425 (see also Chapter XIII.).</p>
<p>Owing perhaps to the big flood in 1806, the church and school,
which had formerly been conducted in the same room, were removed
to an old granary, which was fitted up, one floor as a temporary
church, and another as a school.</p>
<p>The site of this temporary second church was probably that of
the School of Arts in Bridge Street. In the examination of Andrew
Thompson, on January 27th, 1808, in the Bligh case, he mentions
having used a quantity of Government cedar for making pews for
the church at Hawkesbury. Pew No. 1 was built for the Governor,
No. 2 was for Andrew Thompson, while No. 14 was the Magistrate's
pew. (See <i>Historical Records</i>, vol. VI., page 451.) These
pews were evidently placed in this temporary church, and it would
be interesting to know what eventually became of them.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Youl, who was probably chaplain <i>pro tem</i>.,
complained to the Rev. W. Cowper in 1810 that the church was
being used as a court-house, and it was probably this temporary
church he referred to. (See <i>Historical Records</i>, vol. VII.,
p. 285.)</p>
<p>An application was made in 1807 for a resident clergyman or
chaplain, as he was called in those early days. No appointment
was made until about the 12th March, 1810, when the Rev. Robert
Cartwright was appointed at a salary of two hundred and forty
pounds per annum. He arrived in the colony in August, 1809, as
the result of the visit to England of the Rev. S. Marsden. Like
the other early chaplains, he also acted as a magistrate, being
appointed as such for Wilberforce, and holding the office from
1811 to 1817. He lived at Richmond on his own property, as the
Glebe at Clarendon was neither cleared nor fenced. He also had
two large grants of land at Castlereagh of over one thousand
acres. He took part in the founding of the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society in 1818.</p>
<p>The Rev. R. Cartwright left Windsor for Liverpool in 1820. He
died in 1856, at the age of eighty-five years, at Collector, near
Gunning, and was buried in St. Luke's Church-yard, Liverpool,
where Mrs. Cartwright had been buried in 1837. Further
particulars of his life and family will be found in the article
on "Pioneers" (see Chapter II.).</p>
<p>On 18th April, 1811, a meeting was held to take steps for the
erection of a new church and school-house. Doubtless the
complaint of the Rev. J. Youl about the church being used as a
court-house, and the appointment of the Rev. Robert Cartwright,
expedited matters. Among those present at this meeting were: Rev.
S. Marsden, Rev. R. Cartwright, and Messrs. A. Forrest, G.W.
Evans, M. Pitt, J. Griffiths, J. Dight (hon. sec.), and William
Cox (hon. treas.). These, with the exception of the Raw S.
Marsden, formed the building committee. Mr. Cox produced a plan
for a building forty feet by sixteen feet, which, according to a
rough estimate, would cost two hundred pounds, and require forty
thousand bricks, and four thousand feet of timber. Subscriptions
amounting to one hundred and thirteen pounds, nineteen shillings
were received, including twenty-five pounds from Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>The <i>Historical Records</i> are not yet available after
1811, and we are, therefore, not able to give further particulars
of the building.</p>
<p>This third church was, however, we believe, a three-storey
building, and it must have greatly exceeded the original
estimate. It stood behind the present School of Arts. The ground
floor was used as a school, and the first floor was the parish
church up to the opening of the present church of St Matthew, in
1822. The second floor was the teacher's residence (see Chapter
XIII.).</p>
<p>The clergy who officiated in this old church were: The Rev.
Robert Cartwright, from the time it was opened, probably about
1812, till 1819; and the Rev. John Cross, from December, 1819, up
to the opening of St. Matthew's, in 1822.</p>
<p>The site of the present church, which was the fourth Church of
England site and building used in Windsor, was intended at first
for a public burial ground, and was so used as early as 1810. It
was consecrated as such on 14th May, 1811, by the Rev. S.
Marsden.</p>
<p>In 1817, on 4th April, Governor Macquarie reports that he
proposed to at once build a new church at Windsor; also at
Liverpool, and in Sydney (St. James'). The Liverpool Church, St.
Luke's, was completed on 28th February, 1820. At the same time
the new church in Windsor is reported as being in progress. St.
Thomas' Church, Port Macquarie, also dates from this time.</p>
<p>It appears from later correspondence that the Rev. Robert
Cartwright would have preferred a more central site for the
church.</p>
<p>Tenders for building St. Matthew's Church were advertised in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 17th August, 1816, by Captain John
Gill, Acting-engineer, of the 46th Regiment. The first designs
were for a two-storied building on smaller foundations than at
present. This is the building that Governor Macquarie had pulled
down in 1819, and the present church built on more extended
foundations.</p>
<p>The foundation stone was laid by Governor Macquarie on 11th
October, 1817. Some most valuable information about the building
of St. Matthew's is found in the pariah records. These records
were started by the Rev. R. Cartwright in 1810, and have been
continued by the succeeding incumbents up to the present time.
They are at present preserved in the rectory. In the early days
of the church, the chaplain had the assistance of a parish clerk,
and it is to this official, Joseph Harpur, parish clerk and
school-master from 1813 to 1826, that we are indebted for the
interesting data about the building of the church, which he
inserted in the pariah register. A sketch of his life and family
will be found in the articles on schools (see Chapter XIII.).</p>
<p>The Rev. A.R. Blacket, during his incumbency of St Matthew's,
1885-90, copied out the records of this interesting parish clerk.
They were published in the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>,
20th January, 1894, and we take the liberty of repeating them
here:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Among the registers of this Parish are to be found the
records of some events connected with the early history of the
Hawkesbury district, which I feel sure will be read with pleasure
by many of your readers. The incidents described may not be very
remarkable in themselves, but their history has gathered
importance by the lapse of years. It is to the Parish Clerk that
we are evidently indebted for these interesting memoranda, which
are to be found at the end of the book that served for the years
1813 to 1825, as a Parish Register of Births, Marriages and
Burials. The first entry refers to a disastrous flood, and reads
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The rivers Hawkesbury and Nepean, having inundated the
various settlements on their banks three times within nine
months, and swept away great quantities of wheat and stock of all
kinds, as well as totally destroying the growing crop of maize,
which was nearly ripe, a most lamentable scarcity of grain
prevailed, and hundreds in the districts of the Hawkesbury were
reduced to a state of starvation: and to alleviate these
distresses the Magistrates and other gentlemen at Windsor and the
surrounding districts raised the sum of five hundred pounds by
voluntary subscription, on the 28th June, 1817, which was lain
out in the purchase of provisions, chiefly rice, and issued
weekly to upwards of five hundred distressed persons, by Mr.
Harpur, at the Public Schoolhouse at Windsor, until the harvest
commenced, November 23rd, 1817."</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that exactly fifty years after the
disaster recorded in this entry, a similar inundation swept over
the district, still known among old residents as "the great
flood". Drift wood was left on the ridge pole of the Church at
Clydesdale. St. Matthew's, Windsor, was occupied by homeless
families for weeks; and in the midst of the calamity, the
incumbent, Rev. H.T. Stiles, passed away to his reward. The next
memorandum is intensely interesting, and is highly valuable as a
record of the times:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A little after sunset on Saturday, the 11th day of October,
1817, the corner-stone of St. Matthew's Church was laid by
Governor Macquarie, and after depositing the rim of a Spanish
dollar, with the circular bit struck out of its middle (the
currency of the colony), which pass for six shillings and
threepence sterling, His Excellency, in a very impressive tone of
voice, said&mdash;'God prosper St. Matthew's Church,' gently
striking the stone three times with a mason's mallet; the same
ceremony was performed severally by the whole of the gentlemen
which accompanied His Excellency from the Government House to the
spot. Through indisposition, owing, it was said, to the unusual
heat of the weather at this time of the year, the resident
chaplain&mdash;Rev. Robert Cartwright&mdash;was not present."</p>
<p>The good work thus auspiciously begun met with impediments in
its progress, which the pen of the parish clerk has, with
charming simplicity, duly recorded:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The corner-stone having been removed, and the money stolen
early in the evening in which it was deposited by the Governor,
this evening, about the same time, the corner-stone was re-laid
by His Excellency, and a dollar deposited underneath it by the
Rev. Robert Cartwright. Monday, 13th October, 1817. This
transaction was witnessed by His Honour Lieut.-Governor Erskine,
of the 43rd Regiment, Major Antill, D. Allan, Esq.,
Commissary-General, Rev. Henry Fulton, William Cox, Esq., Chief
Magistrate at the Hawkesbury, Mr. Surgeon Mileham, J.P., several
gentlemen, and the most respectable inhabitants of Windsor. His
Excellency addressed the spectators in a very pathetic manner,
passing very high and deserved encomiums on the Resident
Chaplain. returned to compliment the Magistrates and Officers at
the Macquarie Arms Inn, where the whole party (except Mr.
Cartwright) sapped together."</p>
<p>"November, 1817.&mdash;The dollar deposited under the
corner-stone of St. Matthew's Church by the Rev. Mr. Cartwright,
was again stolen a few nights afterwards. This infamous species
of theft could not have been practiced only through the neglect
of the contracting builder not having prepared materials to
immediately work over the stone. It is supposed that the
corner-stone was thrown down each time and the money stolen by
some of the indigent convicts employed at the Public Works in the
town of Windsor.</p>
<p align="right">"(Signed) JOSEPH HARPUR."   </p>
<p>Nearly two years passed away before the Parish Clerk resumed
his entries. Then he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The walls of the church, to which the above memoranda refer,
have been taken down to the very foundation, through some defect
in the building, and another is now in building on its site by
Government, of much larger dimensions, and of the very best
materials; it is, I believe, to retain the name of St. Matthew
given to the first building.</p>
<p align="right">"JOSEPH HARPUR."   </p>
<p>"June 4th, 1819."</p>
<p>With regard to the name of the church, it is worth mentioning
that the vessels belonging to the Communion Service, now used for
private celebrations in this parish, bear the inscription, "St.
Andrew, Windsor." Can this be explained by supposing that the
name of the church was for some time unsettled, that the
Communion Service was procured when there was some idea of
dedicating the new place of worship to St. Andrew, but that
afterwards, as hinted by Mr. Harpur, it was decided to retain the
old name? Another interval of two years occurs, and then we
read:&mdash;</p>
<p>"September, 1821.&mdash;In the beginning of this month, some
sheet lead was blown off the dome of the new church (St.
Matthew's) by a violent gust of wind; a large sheet was lodged on
the scaffolding, and another fell to the ground torn into holes,
the lead having been nailed down only and not soldered.
"J.H."</p>
<p>What a succession of reverses? Robbery, bad workmanship, and
destructive gales! One trouble that church-builders meet with
nowadays was not experienced, however. They never ran short of
money or got into debt. At last the work was completed, and five
years after the first foundation-stone had been laid, the
consecration ceremony took place.</p>
<p>"December 18th, 1822.&mdash;This day the new church of St.
Matthew's was consecrated and opened for Divine worship by the
Rev. Samuel Marsden, Principal Chaplain of the Territory,
assisted by the Rev. Messrs. Cross, Resident Chaplain,
Cartwright, and Hassall. After the sermon the Holy Sacrament was
administered to a goodly company from various parts of the
colony. Scarcely an individual was observed but what appeared
deeply attentive during the whole service, and the church was
nearly filled before the consecration commenced.</p>
<p align="right">"JOSEPH HARPUR."   </p>
<p>"Windsor, Wednesday,<br>
     "18th December, 1822."</p>
<p>This is the last, unfortunately, of the records left by the
Parish Clerk.</p>
<p>With regard to the name of "St. Andrew's", proposed to be
given to the church, instead of St. Matthew's, referred to in the
above notes, we notice in a paper read by Mr. J.P. McGuanne, on
"The Early Schools of New South Wales," and published by the
Australian Historical Society in the records (vol. II., p. 87),
that he refers to "John" (Joseph?) Harpur at the Windsor Chapel,
St. Andrew's. And again in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 25th
December, 1823, there is a Government Proclamation, signed by
Governor T. Brisbane, with reference to the letting of the pews
in the various churches in the territory of New South Wales. In
this Proclamation, issued just twelve months after the
consecration of the local church of England as St. Matthew's, we
read that the following were appointed a committee to attend to
the letting of the pews: "The Rev. John Cross, and William Cox
and John Brabyn, Esquires, for the Church of St. Andrew's,
Windsor."</p>
<p>The church at Castlereagh, built before 1836, was called St.
Andrew's, and it may be on this account that the name St.
Matthew's was chosen for Windsor in 1819. See Wells'
<i>Gazetteer</i>, 1848, p. 394.</p>
<p>With reference to another entry by J.H., dated September 21,
telling about the lead on the tower being blown off, we find
further trouble with this lead only five years later. Thus the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 21st October, 1826:&mdash;"Yesterday
se'nnight, between three and four o'clock, the town of Windsor
was visited by one of the heaviest squalls of wind which has been
remembered for some years. It proceeded from the north-west, and
in the course left nothing removable remaining. Trees were blown
up from the roots, and many of the heavy limbs were broken off.
The Windsor Church had the lead blown from the tower, two heavy
sheets of considerable weight; the saddle boards were actually
blown from the roof to a great distance from the building."</p>
<p>The Rev. G.E.C. Stiles, B.A., son of the Rev. H.T. Stiles,
M.A., who was incumbent of Windsor, 1833-67, informs us that when
St. Matthew's was opened in 1822, King George IV. presented the
tower clock and bell-(the same tone as the tenor bell in St.
James', Sydney), and the communion service, with chalice and
paten, but no flagon.</p>
<p>The building of the rectory was started about the year 1822,
and finished in 1823. It contains some good woodwork, has large
rooms, and is of the Georgian period of architecture. It was
considered a very fine building when erected, and much superior
to the rectories of other parishes even of a much later date.</p>
<p>The <i>Sydney Gazettes</i> of this period give from time to
time the prices paid locally for bricks, lime, shingles, sawing
timber, cartage, and such like items, for the Church at
Windsor.</p>
<p>The church is built of red bricks, in the Norman style of
architecture, with a semi-circular chancel, and a large square
tower about seventy feet high, surrounded with a dome and cross,
the top of the cross being ninety-four feet six inches above the
ground level. The church measures ninety-nine by forty-eight
feet, or, including the tower and the chancel, the entire length
is one hundred and thirty-four feet.</p>
<p>The architect of St. James', Sydney, and St. Luke's,
Liverpool, was Francis Howard Greenway, and we believe he was
also the architect of St. Matthew's, Windsor. His son was
Archdeacon C.C. Greenway, of Grafton.</p>
<p>We take the following advertisement from the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>, 15th January, 1824.</p>
<p>"St. Matthew's Church, Windsor.&mdash;Persons desirous of
renting pews or seats in this church are desired to make
applications to the Chaplain in writing, stating the quantity of
accommodation that may be required and where situated, that the
same may be delivered to the committee for their inspection."</p>
<p>The following report was made in 1824 by S.L. Harris,
architect, under instructions from the Governor, Sir Thomas
Brisbane, regarding the expenditure of &pound;565 4s. 10d. on the
"Windsor Church" during the year 1823&mdash;that is, the year
after the church was opened. The report is accompanied by a plan
showing no porch:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Windsor Church.&mdash;This church is situated a mile from the
town on an eminence, built of brick, and executed in a good and
workmanship manner, but the mortar that has been used is of a
similar description to that so often described in this report,
and therefore its permanency cannot be depended on. The cornices
and plastering (though comparatively well done) are already
showing cracks and sound hollow, and will shortly give way. The
timber used for the pews is cedar, of very good quality, but
miserably executed. The fence in front of the Burial Ground is a
strong pallisading on a base stone coping, well painted, and in
good preservation, but the opposite fence is in a very bad state,
'and requires to be made new. The ornaments on the tower (as will
appear by the plan) have been put up at a great expense, and are
very ill adapted for a place of worship, being much more suitable
for a theatre or fancy dwelling. There is a very good clock in
the tower, and well preserved."</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;Among the repairs specified, or what may have been
additions, were seventeen pews, costing eighty-five pounds, and
one large pew at ten pounds; also circular stairs to descend
pulpit, twelve pounds.</p>
<p>The second incumbent of St. Matthew's, and also the resident
chaplain, was the Rev. John Cross, who arrived in the ship
<i>Barling</i>, about the year 1813, the Rev. II. Hill, of St.
James's, Sydney, being a fellow passenger. He held the office
from December, 1819, to January, 1828, being in charge during the
greater part of the building of St. Matthew's, and he was the
first clergyman to occupy the pulpit. He removed to St. Thomas's
Church, Port Macquarie, in 1828, and was there until his death,
in 1858, at the age of seventy-seven. There is a memorial tablet
in the church to his memory. He had a son, who died in 1894, who
had been a lay reader in the Manning River district for some
thirty-five years.</p>
<p>It is of interest to observe here that in the year 1824 there
were but seven settled parishes in New South Wales&mdash;St.
Phillip's and St. James's, in Sydney; St. John's, Parramatta; St.
Luke's, Liverpool; St. Peter's, Campbelltown; Christ Church,
Newcastle; and St. Matthew's, Windsor. (? Port Macquarie
also.)</p>
<p>The third incumbent of St. Matthew's Church was the Rev.
Elijah Smith, who came in February, 1828, and remained only a
short time, leaving in December of the same year. He was in St.
Mary's in 1842, and incumbent of St. Stephen's, Penrith,
1853-68.</p>
<p>The Rev. Matthew Devenish Meares, M.A., lived in Windsor, in
"York Lodge", which was the property of the trustees of the
clergy and school lands, for some years, and he frequently
assisted in the parish work of St. Matthew's. He was the
incumbent of Pitt Town from 1824 to 1833, and was afterwards
placed at Wollongong (1839), then at Enfield and Burwood
(1859-61). Mr. Meares was a life member of the Hawkesbury
Benevolent Society, and he died about the year 1861.</p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph Docker, who arrived in the colony on 11th
November, 1828, in the ship <i>Adam</i>, took charge of St.
Matthew's on 1st January, 1829, and he resigned in March, 1833,
but continued to live in the district, his name appearing in the
Directory of 1835 as a resident of Windsor. He is said to have
lived at "Clifton", near Clarendon, for some years. He afterwards
lived in Victoria, where he was engaged in pastoral pursuits in
the fifties and sixties.</p>
<p>For some months after his resignation the parish appears to
have been somewhat disorganised. The following clergymen did duty
on Sundays:&mdash;Rev. S. Marsden, Rev. R. Forrest, Rev. W.
Yates, Rev. W. Simpson, and Rev. R. Cartwright, while the general
work of the parish was attended to by Rev. M.D. Meares, M.A., of

<p align="right">JOSEPH DOCKER, Chaplain.   </p>
<p>The following are the particulars of the lands granted to the
Church of England in Windsor. The site of the church and burial
ground, consisting of three acres twenty-three perches, was
appropriated in 1833, but first marked out as a burial ground for
the use of the settlers in 1811 (? 1810):&mdash;</p>
<p>Church of England school site in Bridge Street&mdash;Two roods
thirty-five perches (more or less) appropriated in 1833.
dedicated 16th July, 1863, and sold in 1902. In use from 1809.
Church of England, Glebe&mdash;Eight acres two roods eighteen
perches, fronting Moses Street and Windsor Terrace, and
thirty-one acres one rood thirty-four perches near Clarendon
railway station. Both sites appropriated in 1836, but so used at
a much easier date. The Glebe land at Clarendon now forms portion
of the Hawkesbury Agricultural College lands, from which the
parish derives an income of ten pounds per annum.</p>
<p>The site of the school-hall in New Street is not a grant. It
was purchased about 1878, and contains an area of one rood six
perches, having a frontage of sixty-six feet by a depth of one
hundred and ninety feet.</p>
<p>The following memorandum from the Lands Office relating to the
old historical school site in Bridge Street is of
interest:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In 1831 there was a measurement made of a portion of land of
two roods thirty-two perches for school purposes, upon which were
shown some buildings, then in a ruinous state (partly upon the
school lands). In 1857 the church authorities made application
for a deed of this land, representing it as having been
appropriated in either 1809 or 1819 (evidently the doubt due to
some indistinct writing)."</p>
<p>It was decided to amend the form of allotment, giving the
church approximately the same area, and allowing an allotment on
the west for sale by auction. Also decided to allow the Bishop to
sell the material of the ruinous building, or buildings, and
devote proceeds towards improvement of the school. It was
represented in the application for deed that the "Approved
Trustees" were Rev. H.T. Stiles, Robt. Fitzgerald, Laban White,
and Wm. Kemp. Survey was made by Mr. Licensed Surveyor Whitaker,
in 1858, of the amended allotment (25th January, 1858). Papers
show that at some period Joseph Cope was also a Trustee.</p>
<p>In 1871 John Johnson and Francis Hole were appointed in lien
of Stiles and Cope, deceased (<i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 19th
September, 1871). By <i>Gazette</i>, 22nd September, 1874, Rev.
C.F. Garnsey was appointed Trustee, and the deed was finally
prepared in the name of the three Trustees (above), 1st December,
1874.</p>
<p>On 8th October, 1902, the land was formally transferred by the
Church of England Property Trust to Sarah Ann Boyd, under
authority of an Ordinance of Synod, which gave authority to sell
by public auction or private contract.</p>
<p>A new and long chapter in the history of St. Matthew's begins
with the appointment of the Rev. Henry Tarlton Stiles, M.A., to
the parish. He was born in Bristol, England, on 24th June, 1808.
After completing his studies he was ordained by the Bishop of
London, in 1833, and the same year came out to New South Wales as
one of the Colonial Chaplains, and was appointed to St. Matthew's
on 2nd September, 1833. At that time he was a young man about
twenty-five years of age, and he remained here up to the time of
his death, in 1867, a period of thirty-four years.</p>
<p>Amongst the duties the Rev. Mr. Stiles had to perform as
chaplain was a visit to Norfolk Island to minister to a number of
prisoners who had been condemned to death for mutiny on the
island. The following is a copy of the letter sent him by the
Governor, Sir Richard Bourke, on 21st August, 1834:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>My Dear Sir,</i></p>
<p><i>I know well your disposition to do good whenever an
opportunity offers, and conferring this morning with Mr. Justice
Burton, who is just returned from Norfolk Island, it occurred to
us both that your exertions at that place in preparing some of
the unhappy men for meeting that sentence which Mr. Burton passed
upon them might be productive of the beet effects, both with
regard to those who must suffer capitally and those who will be
witnesses of their fate. The schooner Isabella will be despatched
for the Island early in the next week, and if you have no
insuperable objection, I would propose to Mr. Marsden to request
you to go there. Your passage will be provided and your quarters
on the Island, from which the Isabella will remain to remove you.
As some of the wretched men are Roman Catholic, a priest of that
religion will be sent to Norfolk Island also. . . . .</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>I am, my dear sir,                 <br>
<br>
Very faithfully yours,         <br>
<br>
RICHARD BOURKE.   </i></p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Ullathorne represented the Roman Catholic Church,
and they had a rather rough passage in the Isabella, Their
ministrations were very acceptable to the thirteen condemned men,
whose execution they were also obliged to witness. A full account
of this painful duty will be found in the <i>Church Standard</i>,
3rd April, 1914.</p>
<p>We might here state that the schooner Isabella left Leith, in
Scotland, on 12th December, 1833, and arrived in
Sydney, <i>via</i> Hobart, on 22nd June, 1834. Among the
passengers was the late David Lindsay Waugh (of Kiama), father of
Mrs. Steele. His diary giving an account of the voyage out from
Scotland will be found in the Mitchell Library.</p>
<p>The first confirmation service held in St. Matthew's was
conducted by Bishop Broughton on 11th October, 1836.</p>
<p>Up to the year 1842 Richmond formed part of the Windsor
pariah. It was then erected into a separate parish, St. Peter's
Church having been built in 1841. The first resident clergyman at
Richmond was the Rev. A.W. Wallis, 1842; followed by the Rev.
J.K. Walpole, 1843; Rev. John Elder, 1845; and the Rev. Dr.
Woolls, in 1873.</p>
<p>In the year 1842 a neat brick church was built at Clydesdale
and named St. Phillip's, the parish being from then known as
"Windsor and Clydesdale". Unfortunately, this church was built on
the flood area, the big flood in 1867 leaving drift wood on the
roof. This church is now closed. The site was given by Charles
Thompson.</p>
<p>From the year 1810, when the parish records start, to
December, 1845, there had been fourteen hundred and seventy-nine
burials in the church-yard. For the same period seven hundred and
forty-six marriages are recorded, while the baptisms up to
December, 1841, numbered fourteen hundred and ninety-four. These
average forty-eight baptisms, twenty-one marriages, and forty-two
burials per annum. Later figures are not available, as the method
of numbering was altered at this time.</p>
<p>During the incumbency of the Rev. Mr. Stiles, a pipe organ was
placed in the gallery at the back of the church, which was built
for this purpose in 1840. The organ was built by Messrs. Johnson
and Kimlock, of Princes Street, Sydney, and was the first organ
built in Australia. Five hundred pounds were subscribed for these
improvements, the organ costing three hundred and twenty pounds.
It was opened by Mr. Wm. Johnson, the organist of St. James's
Church, Sydney, on the 8th November, 1840. Prior to this, the
military band, conducted by Captain Edgerton, used to occupy the
three back centre pews, and lead the singing. The marks, and also
portion of the old music stands, may still be seen.</p>
<p>The ball, surmounted by the cross, which is a fac-simile of
that on the dome of St. Paul's, London (but of much smaller
size), was not on the church originally, but was erected by a
builder named Atkinson during the earlier part of Mr. Stiles's
incumbency, in the forties. This cross is a conspicuous object,
and is used as the Government trigonometrical survey mark for the
district.</p>
<p>In the sixties some friction arose between Mr. Stiles and a
considerable number of the parishioners over the introduction
into the praise service of the church of "Chope's Hymnal", on 2nd
October, 1864, in place of the Metrical Psalms of Tate and Brady,
formerly in use. A meeting of the parishioners was held in the
School of Arts on 31st May, 1865, at which it was agreed to
petition Bishop Barker to have the bode withdrawn. This petition
was signed by forty-one male parishioners. After much
correspondence and heart-burning, the book was withdrawn on 24th
December, 1865. Amongst those who took a leading part in this
discussion were Messrs. Jas. Ascough, J.A. Dawson, S. Edgerton,
J.B. Lavarack, Henry Moses, and John Tebbutt, junior.</p>
<p>St. Matthew's Parochial Association was formed in 1856, Mr.
John Tebbutt being the honorary secretary and treasurer for many
years. During the first ten years of its existence the sum of
nine hundred and thirty-five pounds, five shillings and ninepence
was raised and remitted to Sydney for assisting various forms of
church activities. The local committee of this Parochial
Association, which was in connection with the Sydney Church
Society, were Messrs. Richard Dunstan, Samuel Edgerton, John A.
Dawson, Jas. Ascough, and John Tebbutt. Owing to some friction
with the Rector and the Rev. C. F. Garnsey, the Association's
receipts greatly declined during the later sixties.</p>
<p>The architects who designed and carried out most of the
improvements in Mr. Stiles's time were Mr. F.H. Greenway,
Government Architect, and Mr. Edmund T. Blacket.</p>
<p>The present side porch of St. Matthew's was built in the year
1857. It was part of the original design, for the foundations of
the porch were in position, and had been there for thirty years
before it was built. The different courses of bricks can easily
be seen in the old and newer work. The Hon. Robert Fitzgerald
contributed one hundred pounds towards the cost of this and other
improvements made about the same time.</p>
<p>There are two tablets in the porch, one with only the letters
M.F., 1857. This is in memory of Miss Mary Fitzgerald, another
tablet to her memory being included among the group of Fitzgerald
tablets inside the church, behind the pulpit. The other porch
tablet, to Catherine S. Roxburgh, who died in October, 1853, is
in memory of a visitor to the district in search of health. Her
grave will be seen near that of the Rev. H.T. Stiles, in the
church-yard. Miss Roxburgh contributed fifty pounds towards the
erection of the porch before her death.</p>
<p>About the same time that the porch was built, the church got a
loan of four hundred pounds for repairs; the Church Society, of
the Sydney Diocese, paid the interest on this loan. This money
was, we believe, used for re-roofing the church with slates, as
at present, in place of the old shingles, and for substituting
the present wooden ceiling for the original open one; also for
cutting down the quaint old three-decker pulpit, which then stood
near the centre of the church on the north Bide, and removing it
to the south-east corner, where the organ now stands, and for
cutting down the old high-back pews, and removing the doors from
the same. Some of the old binge marks may still be seen on many
of the pews. The pews, at the same time, were re-arranged so as
to face the altered position of the pulpit. The baptismal stone
font, which now occupies a central position in the church.
replaced a wooden one which stood in one of the pews. The rectory
was also re-shingled at the same time.</p>
<p>The year 1857 appears to have been one of progress in church
affairs in the district, for two new churches were then built in
the neighbouring parish&mdash;St. John's, Wilberforce; and St.
James's, Pitt Town.</p>
<p>The clergyman's vestry of St. Matthew's Church originally
stood in the north-east corner, where the pulpit is now placed.
When the old pulpit was moved from the centre of the church to
the south-east corner, and the seats re-arranged, the vestry was
moved to the room from which the stairs to the tower begin.
Finally, in the early eighties, the Rev. F.W. Stretton had the
vestry placed as at present, under the gallery.</p>

<br>
<p>A further idea of the work of the parish will be found in the
following extract from a report on the state of religion and
education in New South Wales, by W.W. Burton, one of the judges
of the Supreme Court, published in 1840:&mdash;</p>
<p>Page 189: "The duties of the Rev. Mr. Stiles extended at the
commencement of the year 1839, not only over the town and hundred
of Windsor, but also over the adjoining town and hundred of
Richmond; the Curryjong, which is in the County of Cook, and the
Cornwallis, which is on the banks of the Hawkesbury, between the
towns of Windsor and Richmond. For neither of these districts was
any separate provision made for the ordinances of religion.</p>
<p>"The Church of St. Matthew at Windsor is capable of containing
about four hundred and fifty persons, and the chapel at Richmond
about one hundred. The number usually attending at the former is
about three hundred and twenty, and at the latter sixty. The
population of the Curryjong, which is in the County of Cook,
consists of about eight hundred persons, comprised in the
population of that county, scattered up and down in the gullies
of the Blue Mountain Range; it is a very wild and mountainous
country. That part called the Cornwallis contains about two
hundred or three hundred inhabitants, who are placed very thickly
on the rich alluvial farms on the banks of the River
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>"The regular duties of the clergyman at Windsor are two full
services, one at each town on Sundays, with a good deal of
occasional duty at each place in the way of marriages,
churchings, baptisms, and burials. This, with visiting the sick
at their own houses, superintending a. Sunday-school at Richmond,
and riding from one place to another (the towns being five miles
apart) is as much as his time and strength will admit.</p>
<p>"His week-day duties are&mdash;a full service at the
schoolhouse, in the Curryjong, fifteen miles from home, every
alternate Wednesday, where he has succeeded in collecting a
little congregation of about thirty adult persons, with the
children attending the school. From this place, as the
headquarters, he makes pastoral visits to the people round, to
facilitate which he used to sleep in the school and proceed on
horseback the next day, but this he has not found it necessary to
continue.</p>
<p>"In Windsor he has a service every fortnight at the Public
Hospital, and another at a like interval in the Town Gaol, in
both of which places he converses with the men individually when
requisite, and distributes books and tracts among them. "The
superintendence of the public schools forms another very
important part of his duties; there are three of these under his
care, namely, at Windsor, Richmond, and Curryjong, where he
regularly visits and examines the children.</p>
<p>"The roads over which the clergyman has to travel in the
performance of his duties are very bad. . . . . There is no
bridge across the Hawkesbury, and though there is a punt, it
scarcely ever is used, so that the river must always be forded,
which is just practicable, though far from agreeable. These
things, together with the scattered character of the mountain
population, make travelling and pastoral visitation by the
minister a work of great fatigue."</p>
<p>The Rev. H.T. Stiles died on the 22nd June, 1867, within two
days of his sixtieth birthday. His death occurred while the big
flood was at about its greatest height, the water having entered
the Presbyterian Church in George Street, where large numbers of
refugees had slept the previous night. The last duty performed by
the dying minister was to order that the church doors of St.
Matthew's be opened in order to let the homeless people find a
shelter from the rising flood.</p>
<p>The Rev. H.T. Stiles left a legacy of two hundred pounds to
the church, which forms part of the present endowment. His family
consisted of four sons&mdash;Henry, George, Charles, and
Clement&mdash;and one daughter, Mary, who married the Rev. C.F.
Garnsey in 1860. The second hob, the Rev. George Edward Carter
Stiles, B.A., was born in St. Matthew's rectory in 1835, and is
at present living in retirement at Lindfield, Sydney. Mrs. Stiles
died at her son's rectory in Sofala about eight months after her
husband's death, and is buried with him in St. Matthew's
cemetery. The grave will be seen close to the chancel at the east
end. Mrs. Stiles was closely related to the Hole family, well
known in connection with the scholastic and banking affairs of
the town.</p>
<p>The following is the inscription on the tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Rev. H.T. Stiles, M.A., was succeeded by the Rev. Charles
F. Garnsey in 1867. He had been teaching a private school in
Windsor for some years, and was a son-in-law of the former
incumbent, being married on the 27th December, 1860, at St.
Matthew's, to Mary Emma, the only daughter of the Rev. H.T.
Stiles. The Rev. C.F. Garnsey assisted in the rescue work during
the big flood of 1867, and also the great fire of 1874. During
his pastorate improvements were made to the organ. He also
arranged a big evangelistic mission, conducted by the Rev. H.A.
Langley, the church being crowded nightly, and additional seats
were brought over from the public school. Mr. Garnsey left in
December, 1876, for St. James's Church, Sydney, as assistant. In
April, 1878, he was appointed incumbent of the important parish
of Christ Church, Sydney. On leaving Windsor he was presented
with a valuable gold watch by the parishioners, who also
presented him with a silver salver on 20th May, 1873. He died on
3rd December, 1894, aged sixty-seven years.</p>
<p>The Rev. Henry A. Langley was the next incumbent, from 1877 to
August, 1878, when he was removed to Prahran, Victoria, and was
afterwards Bishop of Bendigo, Victoria, 1902-1906. It was he who
secured the land and set in motion the scheme for building the
school-hall in New Street.</p>
<p>The Rev. Frederick William Stretton, from Mudgee, followed in
1878. Although he was in rather delicate health, he did much
useful work-in the way of church building and the extension of
the parish. He had a nice brick church built at Riverstone, and
it was in this church he preached his last sermon. He also had
St. John's Church built at Colo, and also the church at Vineyard.
The pulpit in this church is made from a portion of the old
original St. Matthew's pulpit. He also had the school hall
erected in New Street in the year 1880, the debt on which stood
at five hundred pounds in 1882.</p>
<p>During his pastorate, and with the aid of a curate, services
were held at Clydesdale, Riverstone, Vineyard, Wiseman's Terry,
Freeman's Reach, North Rocks (now Forrester), and at three places
along the Colo River.</p>
<p>He died on the 31st July, 1886, at the early age of
thirty-nine years, his wife having predeceased him by only a few
months. Their grave may be seen on the west side of the church,
near the window next the pulpit. The following inscription is on
the tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>About the year 1882 the large marble monument was erected in
the church grounds near the porch, in memory of Ann Amelia
McQuade, who died on the 21st August 1875, aged forty-six years;
and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. James Hale, who died in 1857 and
1866 respectively. This costly monument, of Carrara marble, was
designed for erection under cover, where it would be protected
from wind, dust, and rain. The result of exposure to the weather
is seen in the serious discolouration of the white-veined marble,
and the falling of several of the beautiful finials, while it is
only a matter of time when this thing of beauty will be a ruin.
The cost must have been well over two thousand pounds, and it is
amongst the finest examples of monumental marble carving and
artistic designing to be found in the State. Lovers of the
artistic will observe the symbolic cinerary urns, the upturned
torches and the laurel wreaths; also the rare clustered columns
supporting the large dome stone adorned with some exquisite
carving. This work was executed by Antonio Caniparoli, of
Carrara, Italy, and was erected by Mr. George Robertson, of
Windsor, there being over forty tons of stone put into the
foundations.</p>
<p>There are at present seven beautiful stained-glass windows in
St. Matthew's Church. The two earliest, on the north side, were
put there in 1864, in memory of John Terry, died 1842 ("The call
of Matthew"), and Edwin Rouse, died 1862 ("The Raising of
Lazarus"). The next pair, on the south side, are in memory of
Rev. H.T. Stiles, M.A., died 1867 ("The Preaching of John the
Baptist"), and Thomas Wingate, died 1869 ("Gethsemane"). The
later windows are&mdash;One in memory of Harriet Hordern, died
1872 ("The Stone Rolled Away from the Sepulchre"), and one to
Harriett Elias, died 1874 ("Abraham's Faith Tested"). The latest
window is in memory of L.N. Wood, died 1888 ("Christ and the
Woman of Samaria").</p>
<p>The Rev. A.R. Blacket, B.A., who had been at Bathurst and
Blayney, took charge of the parish in 1885. He remained for about
three years, when he was removed to Prahran, Victoria, in
January, 1890, and went as a missionary to Persia in 1895. During
his incumbency the church at Riverstone was placed in the Castle
Hill parish, one of the conditions being that the clergyman at
Windsor should preach once a month at Riverstone.</p>
<p>In the year 1889 there died a worthy parishioner in the person
of Mr. Richard Coley, a legal practitioner of over forty years
standing in Windsor. In his will he left the sum of four hundred
pounds to St. Matthew's Church. This sum, together with Rev, H.T.
Stile's legacy of two hundred pounds, and the rent from the Glebe
land at Clarendon, produces an annual endowment of about forty
pounds a year to the church.</p>
<p>The Rev. G.A. D'Arcy Irvine, from Parramatta, was settled on
17th February, 1890, remaining until April, 1893, when he removed
to Bowral, and afterwards to Wollongong, and then to Sydney.
During his pastorate the Rev. H.A. Langley conducted a mission in
October, 1892, in St. Matthew's Church.</p>
<p>The out-stations then were:&mdash;St. Phillip's, Clydesdale,
which was cleaned and renovated after a big Hood that entered the
church in 1890, but, owing to a decline in the population, this
old church had to be closed up soon afterwards, and portion of
the congregation united with Riverstone. Services were also held
at Clarendon and Vineyard, with the assistance of lay
readers.</p>
<p>Permission was obtained to sell the old school site in Bridge
Street, and in March, 1892, the St. Matthew's property was valued
for insurance purposes at five thousand pounds, and the parsonage
at one thousand pounds.</p>
<p>A very fine pulpit was designed by Mr. John Sulman, F.R.I.A.,
and constructed of American oak, with some excellent carving, the
cost being about one hundred pounds. It was placed where the
organ now stands, that instrument being then (1892) in the
gallery. This pulpit took the place of a remodelled old pulpit,
which once stood in the centre of the church, opposite the
present side entrance, but when the church was first opened this
structure stood opposite the chancel, where it obstructed the
view of the communion table. A portion of this old pulpit is now
in use in the Vineyard Church. A new roof was put on the
parsonage, and the stabling re-roofed and renovated, and a new
line of fence erected along the eastern boundary. The cupola of
the tower of the church was repaired, and as none of the
church-wardens would venture up to inspect the work, the worthy
clergyman himself had to undertake that precarious duty. It was
during this incumbency that most of the trees which are growing
beside the church were planted.</p>
<p>The Rev. Sydney Glanville Fielding, of Parramatta, was the
next incumbent, taking charge in May, 1893. He remained for ten
years, until 1903, when he removed to Sydney. This term of office
in Windsor was the longest, with the exception of the Rev. H.T.
Stiles, who was incumbent for thirty-four years.</p>
<p>In October, 1893, a piano was purchased for the school-hall,
at a cost of forty-five pounds. Considerable repairs and
improvements were effected to the roof of the chancel and the
tower dome of the church. The interior was also improved and
decorated, and the organ removed from the gallery and greatly
improved, this work being carried out as a memorial of two former
deceased clergymen, whose names appear thus on brass tablets on
the organ:&mdash;"Rev. Charles F. Garnsey, died 3rd December,
1894;" and "Rev. Frederick William Stretton, died 31st July,
1885." The pulpit was at the same time removed to its present
location, and the choir seats re-arranged. The Rev. S.G. Fielding
also had the old bible re-bound. This Bible was presented to St
Matthew's Church in 1822 by the S.P.C.K., of London. The
Cambridge crest on the title page of the Bible is backed with a
view of King's College on the left, and the Senate House on the
right, the publishing date being 1821. Mrs. Eather succeeded Mr.
F.J. Mortley as organist in February, 1895. In 1896 the brass
alms dish was presented by Mr. G.D. Wood.</p>
<p>The Rev. Philip William Dowe, B.A., whose previous parishes
were Blackheath and Holy Trinity (Sydney), took charge in 1904,
and remained until 1906, when he removed to Bulli. The Rev.
Norman Louis James Jenkyn, the present incumbent, came in 1906,
from Bulli.</p>
<p>The later improvements include some new windows, in 1910, and
chancel tiling, 1912, costing about four hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The laymen taking an active interest in St. Matthew's Church,
and holding office for a considerable period as trustees,
wardens, sidesmen, Sunday-School teachers, and in other ways, are
very many, but the earliest records are not available, so that
the list is not as complete as desirable. We give a short list,
with the earliest date of service which extended from five to ten
years on to much longer periods; but our readers will understand
that the list given is only suggestive, and we cannot claim that
it is in any sense complete. In the thirties William Cox and
Captain Brabyn, and later Samuel North. In 1857 the names of
Robert Fitzgerald, Laban White, William Kemp, and Joseph Cope
appear; then R. Dunston, Francis Hole, Richard Coley, Thomas
Tebbutt, John Tebbutt, Jas. Ascough, J.A. Dawson, and S. Edgerton
in the sixties. Thomas Primrose, Charles Hole, 1876; Stephen Gow,
William Primrose, Francis Howard, 1882; Adolphus Tuckerman, 1886;
W.H.B. Piddington, W.H. H. Becke, Joseph W. Ward, 1888; L.
Barnett, 1889; Thomas Lobb, Thomas Wall, 1890; J.J. Paine, 1891;
Francis Simon, Robert A. Pye, Arthur J. Berckelman, 1895; George
C. Kirwan, 1896; and later J.G. Beazley.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<h3>PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first Presbyterian Church built in
Australasia was the Ebenezer Church at Portland Head, on the
Hawkesbury River. It was erected in 1809, is still in use, and is
the oldest church in the Commonwealth of any denomination. It was
built by a number of free immigrants who settled on the banks of
the Hawkesbury, and who were desirous of worshipping according to
the faith of their fathers, although there was then no
Presbyterian clergyman in the colony, Dr. Lang, in 1824, being
the first of such to occupy the pulpit. James Mein, an elder, and
one of themselves, discharged the duty of leader, assisted by
visiting clergymen of other denominations, such as the Rev. S.
Leigh, Wesleyan, in 1815-17, and the Rev. J. Youl, who had charge
of the day-school in the same building. James Mean died on 3rd
July, 1827, at the age of sixty-six years. His grave will be seen
in the lower corner of the grave-yard at Ebenezer. Governor
Bligh, writing in 1807, says: "Jas. Mein's is the only
congregation in New South Wales not under Government
chaplains."</p>
<p>The first settled minister was the Rev. John Cleland, M.A.,
and he lived in Court Street, Windsor, in the thirties, in a
house near the tannery and the gaol. Mr. Cleland died llth March,
1839, and was buried at Ebenezer.</p>
<p>For many years the members of the Presbyterian Church in
Windsor journeyed out to Ebenezer at the sacrament season, as is
indicated by the inscription in the pulpit Bible at Ebenezer,
which was a gift from the Windsor friends at the time of the Rev.
Geo. Macfie, 1843-67.</p>
<p>The Windsor Presbyterian Register is dated 1836, but the first
entries were made on 21st February, 1838, by the Rev. James
Fullerton, the father of Dr. A.Y. Fullerton, late of Windsor. The
first services were held in the court-house, where the Rev, J.
Fullerton, and at times, the Rev. John Cleland, of Ebenezer, used
to hold service. The church attendance in 1839 numbered from
thirty to seventy.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mathew Adam began duty in 1839. The exact date is not
available, but we note that the first entry made by Mr. Adam in
the church register is a marriage on 15th July, 1839. From that
year till his death, on 15th January, 1863, a period of nearly
twenty-four years, he was the minister of this parish. The Rev.
M. Adam came from Glasgow In 1837.</p>
<p>The present church was built in 1842 on a grant of two roods
twenty-four perches appropriated for this purpose in 1833. The
following extract from the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of
September 27, 1842, regarding the building is of
interest:&mdash;</p>
<p>"News from the Interior.&mdash;Windsor&mdash;Scots
Church:&mdash;It is much to be regretted that this neat and
beautiful new building has not yet been opened. The whole of the
edifice is complete, except the pews and other inside work; but
for the want of funds, operations are at a standstill. An appeal
ought, without delay, to be made to the public, and several
individuals make personal application, which frequently have a
greater effect than vague and general announcements. If this were
done there is little doubt but the result would be successful,
and there is no lack of persons who are at all times ready and
willing to come forward in such a cause, and to help their
Christian brethren in so laudable an undertaking."</p>
<p>The church was opened on 8th January, 1843. The following is a
copy of the advertisement relating to the opening services, taken
from the S.M. Herald, January, 1843:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Scotch Church, Windsor.&mdash;This Church will be opened on
Sabbath next, 8th January, 1843. Rev. K.D. Smythe, of Bathurst,
and the Rev. H.R. Gilchrist, of Camp bell town, will officiate.
Services, eleven a.m. and three p.m. Collection to assist in
defraying expenses of the building."</p>
<p>Of those present at these opening services the last survivors
were Mr. Robert Dick, the Hon. W. Walker, Mrs. Neilson, and Mrs.
Adam.</p>
<p>The Rev. M. Adam was married in 1859 to Mrs. Agnes Hutchinson.
He was Moderator of the Synod of Australia in the year 1857. He
took a keen interest in the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, being
a member of the committee for twenty-two years, and was the
vice-president at the time of his death. Mr. Adam also taught a
private school, first in Mileham Street, and afterwards, from
1845, at "Fairfield", where he resided. A mural tablet in the
Windsor Church records the gratitude of those whom he assisted
with their education. It is inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">To the Memory of the<br>
<br>
REV. MATHEW ADAM,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">First Minister of this Church, in
which he laboured as a faithful servant of Christ for twenty [?
23] years.</p>
<blockquote>This Tablet is erected in grateful remembrance of his
merits as a Teacher, a Pastor and a Friend, by a number of young
men who were indebted to him for their education.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">He arrived in the Colony from
Glasgow in 1837, and died 15th January, 1868, aged 52 years.<br>
<br>
<small>Blessed an the dead which die in the Lord.&mdash;Rev.
14-13.</small></p>
<p>The next minister was the Rev. David Moore, B.A., who took
charge on the 31st March, 1863, continuing till 7th September,
1869, when he removed to Pitt Town, remaining there for about
fourteen years. He died 21st February, 1010, aged ninety years,
and was buried in the Pitt Town Presbyterian Church grounds. Mr.
Moore only gave afternoon services to Windsor after his removal,
which did not please the congregation, so they joined with the
Congregational Church for a few years.</p>
<p>In 1871-2, the pulpit was supplied by the Rev. J. Dymock. A
fresh impetus was given to the church by the settlement of the
Rev. Patrick Fitzgerald, who began work in Windsor in August,
1872, and after a time was duly called and settled, remaining for
some twenty-four years, when he retired in 1896, on account of
advancing years. He afterwards went to live with his relatives in
New Zealand, where he died, at the age of seventy-nine years, in
December, 1902. Mrs. Fitzgerald died in June, 1897, at the age of
seventy-five years. She and her husband were greatly beloved.
During his pastorate Mr. Fitzgerald started services, in 1882, at
Riverstone, where he did good work, and laid well the foundation
of that branch of the charge. He helped and encouraged the noble
little band in the building of a church, which gave permanence to
the cause.</p>
<p>Rev. C.A. White, B.A., fresh from St. Andrew's College, was
next called and settled, in 1896, and he worked with great
energy, having the church thoroughly renovated and repaired at
considerable expense in 1897. Mr. White was called to Wollongong
in 1900.</p>
<p>He was followed by the Rev. Alexander Dandie, who retired on
account of advancing years, in 1912, but he only lived a few
months after his retirement, as he died on 17th December, 1912,
aged seventy-two years.</p>
<p>The Rev. James Steele succeeded Mr. Dandie on 16th October,
1912.</p>
<p>Amongst the leading laymen in the church in the past years, we
find:&mdash;Mr. George Walker and his son, the Hon. William
Walker, M.L.C., Mr. Thomas Cadell and his son, Mr. Geo. R.
Cadell, Mr. Robert Dick and his brother, Mr. James A. Dick, Dr.
J. Gibson, Mr. D. Scotland, and Mr. William S. Hall.</p>
<p>A site for a manse was dedicated on 14th March, 1851, in
Thompson Square, near the Windsor Bridge, containing one rood
seven perches. A portion of this (six perches) was resumed for
public road purposes on 25th January, 1899. The rest of the land
was disposed of when the present manse was purchased, in 1902, as
it was not suitable for manse purposes.</p>

<h3>WESLEYAN CHURCH.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> Methodist Church, formerly known as the
Wesley an Church, has a very long and interesting history in
Windsor. The first Wesleyan class-meeting was held in 1812, when
six members were enrolled, and the number soon increased to
nineteen.</p>
<p>A small Wesleyan school was also taught by Edward Eagar (an
emancipist lawyer), who also conducted divine service, and the
same year, 1812, efforts were started to raise funds to build a
chapel. An appeal was made in 1816 to the Missionary Society in
London for assistance to have this building erected.</p>
<p>The Rev. S. Leigh arrived in the colony in the <i>Hebe</i> on
15th August, 1815. Ha was a personal friend of the Rev. Samuel
Marsden, Church of England Senior Chaplain, and they travelled to
and from New Zealand together. Mr. Marsden had a large farm,
portion of which extended right into the town of Windsor, and,
knowing the desire for the erection of a chapel in Windsor, he
presented Mr. Leigh with the site on which the church now stands.
The foundation stone of a brick chapel, thirty-two feet by
sixteen feet, was laid by the Rev. S. Leigh, on 13th September,
1818, the Rev. Walter Lawry, of Parramatta, who arrived in New
South Wales the same year, assisting. This chapel was opened by
the Rev. B. Carvosso in 1820, and a house was bought for him, at
a cost of two hundred and seventy pounds, known as the Mission
House.</p>
<p>The Rev. B. Carvosso arrived in New South Wales in 1820, and
was settled at Windsor the same year. He was in Sydney and
Parramatta about the years 1822-5, and went to Hobart Town in
May, 1825. He returned to England in 1830. A son, William, who
was born in the Mission House, Windsor, died in England, in 1842.
His father wrote a small biography of him, entitled,
<i>Attractive Piety</i>, published in 1847. The Rev. B. Carvosso
died 2nd October, 1854.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Church took a keen interest in missionary
affairs, especially from 1820 to 1830, and some large missionary
meetings were held. At one, on 20th August, 1828, Lieut. A. Bell
presided, and the speakers were Rev. S. Leigh, Rev. W. Horton,
Rev. R. Mansfield, and Messrs. Tebbutt, A. Still, and R. Fitz. In
the year 1826 the members of the Windsor chapel raised the large
sum of three hundred and fifty-six pounds, nineteen shillings for
missionary work.</p>
<p>The leading Wesleyan laymen in these early days
were:&mdash;Messrs. H.C. Stockfish, M. Hughes (who was the
schoolmaster at Richmond, and formerly at Windsor), R. and P.
Martin, W. Price, M. and G. Everingham (a Matthew James
Everingham died on 25th December, 1817, aged forty-eight years,
and was buried in St. John's cemetery, Wilberforce), D.B. Kirwan,
J.J. Walker (the ancestor of many Methodist ministers), J.
Cotton, and Robert Fitz. The latter was the local C.P.S. from
1817 to 1835, and he arrived in the colony in the Pitt on 11th
April, 1806.</p>
<p>So rapid was the church's growth that it was decided to build
a larger church, the foundation stone being laid on 17th October,
1838, by the Rev. W. Schofield, and the church, measuring fifty
by thirty feet, capable of seating one hundred and fifty people,
and costing one thousand and twenty pounds, was opened on 4th
December, 1839, during the pastorate of Rev. S. Wilkinson and
Rev. F. Lewis. This is the church that was burnt down in the big
fire of 1874 (see Chapter I.).</p>
<p>The Rev. F. Lewis was a great temperance enthusiast. He was
also a keen politician, and a Bowmanite in 1843, the result being
that the windows of tho, church were smashed in the election
riots (see Chapter XXVIII.).</p>
<p>The Richmond Church was built in 1841, and in the fifties
there were six chapels and seven preaching places in the Windsor
circuit.</p>
<p>In 1856, the Rev. Peter Turner, who was a missionary in Samoa
from 1831 to 1853, came to reside in Windsor, remaining till his
death on 2nd November, 1873, at the age of seventy-two years. A
tablet in the church commemorates his name and work.</p>
<p>In 1861 the present school-house was built, and opened with a
bazaar on 16-18th July, 1861. Strange to say, it escaped the fire
in 1874, when the church and all the surrounding buildings were
laid low. This hall was built to accommodate the Wesleyan
day-school.</p>
<p>The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 8th
December, 1875. Among those present, as circuit minister for a
second term, was the Rev. S. Wilkinson, who was also present when
the foundation stone of the burnt church was laid, in 1838. The
foundation stones of this church were laid by Rev. J.H. Fletcher
and Messrs. John Dawson and John Ducker. The church, which
measures fifty-two feet by thirty-two feet, and cost two thousand
and eighty pounds, was opened on 30th August, 1876, when a
collection of four hundred pounds was taken, leaving a debt of
six hundred and forty pounds on the building, which had been
reduced to one hundred and sixty-four pounds in the year 1882,
and has long since been cleared off.</p>
<p>The chief laymen during the seventies throughout the whole
circuit were:&mdash;William Dean, J.S. Bushby, W.I. Crew, John
Galloway, William C. Gambrill, John Lane, J. Alderson, J. Dawson,
Robert Smith, W. Paul, G. Yeates, W.F. Linsley, and William
Chandler. It is notable the large number of the above who were
engaged in the leather trade&mdash;in tanning, harness and boot
lines. From thirty to forty years of active service were given by
J.S. Busby and John Lane.</p>
<p>The church was free of debt in 1892. In 1895 the organ and
choir were removed to the front of the church, on the left side
of the pulpit. In 1895 the parsonage was renovated, and a new
roof put on the school-room.</p>
<p>A tablet was placed in the church to the memory of a worth;
citizen, William Dean, who died 3rd December, 1882, aged
fifty-one years. He was the father of Mr. William H. Dean, the
present Mayor of Windsor, and came to Windsor about the year
1861. He was honorary secretary to the Flood Relief Committee in
1864. To him we owe much of the tree-planting and the improvement
of the park. He was a member of the School Board, and honorary
secretary of the Benevolent Society for eight years. He was also
one of the prime movers in the erection of the Methodist Church
and parsonage, in the seventies.</p>
<p>The Methodist Church itinerant system calls for many changes
in the ministry of their various circuits. We venture on a list
of those who have from the earliest time been settled in Windsor,
giving the year of settlement and the dates of the decease as far
as we have been able to glean such. Rev. S. Leigh, who travelled
round the whole of the early settlements from his arrival, in
1815, was the first Wesleyan clergyman to visit Windsor. He died
2nd May, 1852:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first Congregational services held in
Windsor were conducted by Mr. J.D. Brown, in the year 1866, the
meetings being held in the School of Arts until 1867. Services
were also held at Freeman's Reach. Mr. J. D. Brown was afterwards
in charge of the Baptist Church, St. Mary's, for over sixteen
years, resigning in 1897 and settling at Ebenezer, where,
surrounded by his many relatives and friends, he is still able to
conduct services, although in his 89th year.</p>
<p>Mr. F.H. Brown, a student from Camden College, took charge of
the Windsor Congregational Church on 28th October, 1868, and
remained till he was called to Petersham in October, 1871. The
Rev. F.H. Brown afterwards laboured in Queensland, and then in
Richmond (Victoria), where he was greatly esteemed. During his
residence in Windsor the present church was erected. The
foundation stone was laid by Mr. James Tab-fax, of Sydney, on
Good Friday, the 26th of March, 1869, and the church was opened
by the Rev. Thomas Johnson on 24th August, 1869, Mr. F.H. Brown
being ordained at the same time. A special train, bringing two
hundred passengers, was run from Sydney in connection with the
opening services on 29th August, 1869.</p>
<p>About this time the Presbyterian Church was in difficulties,
and without a minister, and the congregation joined with the
Congregationalists, which necessitated the erection of a gallery
in the year 1871. The Rev. P. Fitzgerald, however, re-opened the
Presbyterian Church in 1872, and sounded the recall of the
Scottish clans to the "auld kirk".</p>
<p>On the 26th January, 1872, Rev. J.F. Cullen took charge of the
Congregational Church and remained until 14th July, 1874. The
debt on the church was at this time reduced to fifty-seven
pounds. Mr. Cullen afterwards entered Parliament, and was a
brother of the present Chief Justice of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Webster was the next minister, from 1874 till 1st
September, 1875. He also started a day-school in Windsor, but it
was not long in evidence. He was at Geeveston, Tasmania, in later
years, and went to the Old Country in 1897.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Leach had charge from 4th October, 1876, to 4th July,
1877. He also kept a day-school.</p>
<p>After a vacancy of two years, Mr. F.C.B. Fairey was settled in
November, 1879, remaining until November, 1881. It was during his
term that the minister's residence was built, a very successful
bazaar being held in aid of the same on 24th to 26th November,
1881, netting seventy pounds. Mr. Fairey was an oarsman of
considerable skill, and traversed the Hawkesbury in his Rob Roy
canoe. He visited the Old Land in 1882, and was accustomed to
give lectures on his canoe experiences. The famous canoe was
burnt in Adelaide some years ago.</p>
<p>The next minister was the Rev. W. Mathieson, who came in
December, 1881, remaining for four years, a longer period than
any of his predecessors. He left in 1885, and was for a long time
settled in Croydon.</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan Williams came next, in January, 1886, and remained
till March, 1889. He afterwards visited England, but died shortly
after his return on 21st September, 1891.</p>
<p>The Rev. B. Rhodes was minister of the charge from January,
1890, up to August, 1892. He entered with great zeal into the
work of the church, his special sermons being frequently reported
in the local press. He also took an active part in the School of
Arts, and other local interests. Mr. Rhodes worked up the
Freeman's Reach portion of the charge, raising funds for
enlarging the church. He went from Windsor to Rookwood, then to
New Zealand, and afterwards to Milton, N.S.W. He has retired from
active work, and resides at Mosman.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Moore, an ex-Methodist minister, from
Bundaberg, Queensland, came next, in April, 1893, holding the
record for length of pastorate by remaining till 1898, six years
in all. During his pastorate the church suffered a great loss in
the death of Mr. William Beard, on 27th July, 1897. About this
time the Congregational Union subsidised the local church to the
extent of fifty pounds a year.</p>
<p>After Mr. Moore left there was a prolonged vacancy of some
four years, when Mr. H. Hughes and Mr. J. Henderson kept the flag
flying for two or three years. After another long vacancy of over
six years without a settled pastor, the Rev. F.C.B. Fairey
returned in 1910 to the work of the charge, remaining for about
two years, since when there has been no settled pastor.</p>
<p>The leading laymen in the Congregational Church have been:
Messrs. J.D. Brown and William Beard, who were the first deacons
appointed in 1866; Messrs. G. Bonamey, C. Westall, of Freeman's
Reach, John Mills, U.F. Robinson, all of whom were among the
original members; and later on, Messrs. Faux, William Slaughter,
S.T. Greenwell, and G.S. Greenwell. Among these laymen were some
of the leading business men in Windsor, and men of real sterling
character they were.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XI.</p>
<h3>ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> Rev. Jas. Dixon, who was sent out, in 1800
for taking part in the Irish insurrection, was given permission
to perform Divine Service, and in this capacity he visited the
Hawkesbury in 1803. He, however, left the colony in 1808.</p>
<p>The Rev. J.J. Therry, who arrived in 1820, was the first duly
authorised clergyman of this church to visit the district. His
parish included Sydney, Wollongong, Parramatta, Penrith, and
Liverpool, as well as Windsor. We believe be visited this part of
the parish as early as 1821, but his periodical visits were "like
those of angels, short and far between," for there is left on
record a letter, dated Windsor, 4th August, 1827, from one
Patrick Sulivan to the Rev. J.J. Therry, in which he complained
that the R.C. prisoners were locked up for two hours each Sunday
while the Protestant prisoners went to service.</p>
<p>Next we find that the Rev. C.V. Dowling was appointed a
chaplain in 1835 for the Hawkesbury. Occasional visits were also
made by the Rev. J.J. Therry and Dr. W.B. Ullathorne, and others,
when services were held in private houses and in a temporary
chapel in Macquarie Street&mdash;perhaps on the vacant land near
the cemetery.</p>
<p>The first permanent appointment was the Rev. J.V. Cocoran, in
1835, but unfortunately he was thrown from his vehicle and killed
whilst driving from Windsor to Sydney on 4th August, 1837. He was
followed by Rev. John Brady.</p>
<p>A grant of land, three acres one rood thirty-nine and a half
perches, was appropriated in 1833 for a Roman Catholic Church and
cemetery. The cemetery has been in use since 1822, and probably
earlier. Subsequently one acre one rood thirty-five perches of
this land was set aside for R.C. school purposes.</p>
<p>In 1836 Judge Burton reports that there was a congregation of
two hundred and fifty, and a larger church was being built, and a
day-school with sixty-seven boys and thirty-seven girls in
attendance. This is probably the school taught by James Cassidy,
1836-44.</p>
<p>In the year 1837 an appropriation of two roods one perch at
the corner of Church and Tebbutt Streets was made for a church
and school, and the deeds were finally issued as for a church and
presbytery. We might here mention that as late as the year 1834
the plan of Windsor shows the present Tebbutt and Church Streets
as being part of the Church Green and an adjacent farm known as
"Catherine Farm".</p>
<p>The foundation stone of the present church was laid by Rev.
Dr. Polding on 28th December, 1836. The church, which is of
Gothic design, was opened on 21st October, 1840, by Dr. Polding,
assisted by Rev. Dr. Ullathorne. The band of the 80th Regiment
took part in the opening ceremonies. The pipe organ was presented
by Mr. William McQuade.</p>
<p>In the year 1840 there were three chapels under the care of
the Rev. J. Brady, who remained in the parish for about four
years, when he was succeeded by the Rev. T.F. McCarthy in the
year 1843; Rev. John Grant, 1848; Rev. M.J. Coffey, 1851. The
latter died in Parramatta in 1857. In the year 1852 the Rev. Dean
Hallinan was appointed, and remained for twenty-two years, being
highly esteemed by all classes of the community. On his leaving
in 1874 he was presented with a purse of one hundred and fifteen
pounds, and an address from all the denominations. He went to
Manly, and afterwards to Ryde in 1896, or earlier.</p>
<p>The Rev. S.J.A. Sheehy took charge in 1874, and remained for
twelve years. The presbytery, next the church, was built in his
time, in 1878, the former presbytery standing where the present
convent is.</p>
<p>In 1877 Richmond was made into a separate parish. Other
services were held at Kurrajong, Caddai, and Nelson.</p>
<p>The convent, which had hitherto been in Macquarie Street, near
the hospital, was removed to the present location, extensive
alterations being made to the old presbytery building. The
foundation stone of St. Joseph's Convent Chapel was laid on 20th
August, 1882, by Archbishop Vaughan. The collection taken on the
occasion amounted to one hundred and twenty-nine pounds. The
church was renovated about the same time. St. John's Church, at
Riverstone, was opened on 2nd July, 1882.</p>
<p>The next priest in charge was Rev. John Hayes, who came from
Wollongong in 1886, and was in charge for twelve years, up to the
time of his death in 1897. He appears to have been in very poor
health for the last year or two, and took frequent changes. He
died at the age of fifty-three years, on 3rd December, 1897, and
was buried in the local R.C. cemetery on 6th December, fifty
priests being present from Sydney and the surrounding
parishes.</p>
<p>In 1895 the church was re-roofed and handsomely, decorated
internally.</p>
<p>The present occupant of the parish, the Rev. B. McDonnell took
charge in 1898, and has already been longer in the parish than
any of his predecessors, with the exception of Dean Hallinan.</p>
<p>The clergy in charge of the church in the adjoining town of
Richmond have been: Rev. P. Cassidy, 1877-78; Rev. D.M.
O'Connell, 1878-89; Rev. J. Grace, 1890-92; Rev. E. Hanahan,
1893-96; Rev. M.E. O'Brien, who took charge in 1896, and died
September, 1915.</p>

<h3>CEMETERIES.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> historian finds much of interest amidst the
silence of "God's Acre." In the earliest days of the Hawkesbury
it was usual to inter the dead within the precincts of private
farms and grounds. The land between the Fitzroy Bridge and
Carrington Hotel, we understand, was a cemetery prior to October,
1810. It is so shown on an old plan of Windsor, in the Mitchell
Library, describing a big flood on 2nd June, 1816. The present
site of St. Matthew's Anglican Church was set apart as a public
burying ground, Andrew Thompson being the first person buried
there, in October, 1810, where his tomb may still be seen. This
church yard and burial ground contains three acres twenty-three
perches, and was appropriated in 1833, but was first marked out
for the use of settlers in 1810. The following extract is from
Government and General Order, dated 11th May, 1811, by his
Excellency Governor Macquarie:</p>
<p>"Country Burial Grounds:&mdash;The respective burial grounds
which were sometimes since marked out for the accommodation of
the settlers in the several townships of Liverpool, Windsor,
Richmond, Pitt Town, Castlereagh, and Wilberforce having been
lately consecrated by the Principal Chaplain, his Excellency the
Governor is pleased to give this public notice thereof, and at
the same time directs and commands that in future all settlers
and other residents within those townships, or in their
respective vicinities, shall cease to bury their dead as
heretofore within their several farms, and shall in a decent and
becoming manner inter them in the consecrated grounds now
assigned for that purpose in their respective townships.</p>
<p>"It is further ordered that when a death shall happen, notice
of the event shall be immediately given to the constable of the
district wherein it has occurred; and the constable receiving
such information is hereby directed to communicate the same to
the nearest resident Chaplain in order that he may attend and
perform the funeral service. Any neglect of these orders will be
severely punished. It is a sacred duty incumbent on all to guard
and protect the remains of their deceased friends from every
unnecessary exposure, it hence becomes necessary that the several
consecrated burial grounds should be speedily enclosed in a
decent manner; and his Excellency the Governor trusts and expects
that the settlers themselves will feel the propriety of
immediately entering into a subscription for the enclosure of
them, either by a good wall or strong pallisadoes. In order to
the carrying this measure into the more immediate effect, his
Excellency is pleased to say that he will contribute on the part
of the Government ten pounds sterling towards the enclosure of
each of the aforesaid consecrated burial grounds."</p>
<p>Amongst the more historical and interesting graves in St.
Matthew's churchyard are:</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><strong>The Roman Catholic
Cemetery</strong></p>
<p>was appropriated in 1833, containing three acres one rood,
thirty-nine and a half perches in all. The oldest vault is
apparently that of Patrick Cullen, 1822. Numbers of well-known
public men are buried here, including the McQuades, J.A. Cuneen,
M.L.A., 1889; Rev. Joseph Butler, M.A., 1889; Rev. J. Hayes.
1897; the Eather family, drowned in the 1867 flood; J.J.
Fitzpatrick, 1899; Edward J. Raper, B.A.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>The Presbyterian Cemetery</strong></p>
<p>contains two acres, three roods, twenty-one perches, and was
appropriated in 1833. The earliest decipherable date on a
tombstone is that of Mary Smith, 1838. Amongst the leading
citizens buried here are: Thomas Cadell, 1857; George Walker,
1883; Hon. William Walker, 1908; Rev. Mathew Adam, 1863; Mrs.
Adam, 1911; Robert Dick, 1898; James A. Dick, 1900; and members
of the Neilson family.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>The Methodist and Congregational
Cemetery,</strong></p>
<p>at Magrath's Hill, dates only from about the year 1850. These
churches formerly used the Presbyterian burial ground. Among
other well-known business men buried there are: William Beard,
senior, 1880; John Crew, 1862; William Alderson, 1865; William
Dean, 1882; John Galloway, 1894; William F. Linsley, 1903; and
the Rev. Peter Turner, 1873.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>General Cemetery.</strong></p>
<p>Several efforts have been made from time to time to establish
a general cemetery with a view to closing those now in use in the
town, but so far without success. Three sites have been
suggested, one in Newtown, between Macquarie, George, James, and
Drummond Streets. Another was gazetted, fenced and cleared in
1895, on the Penrith road, opposite the old Grammar School. This
site of nineteen acres, three roods, thirty-nine perches was
dedicated on 2nd December, 1887, but objection was taken to its
proximity to the Grammar School. The latest site is on the south
of the road forming the easterly continuation of Ham Street,
containing eighteen acres, three roods, sixteen perches, and was
dedicated on 24th July, 1897, but it has not been either cleared
or fenced, and no burials have been made.</p>
<p>The following general cemetery trustees were appointed in
1897: Church of England: Messrs. J.J. Paine, T. Lobb, W.H.H.
Becke, J.W. Ward, J. Boss, T. Primrose, and A.J. Berckelman.
Presbyterian Church: Messrs. William Walker, J.A. Dick, J. Dick,
Smith, Brinsley Hall, and George Robertson. Methodist Church:
Messrs. J.S. Busby, John Lane, W.H. Dean, Edgar Board, G.B.
Maisey, and P.T. Douglass. Roman Catholic Church: Messrs. D.
Holland and G. McCauley.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<h3>SCHOOLS&mdash;DENOMINATIONAL AND PUBLIC.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>First School and Church.</strong></p>
<p>A<small>S</small> early as the year 1802 the Hawkesbury
settlers first attempted by subscriptions to raise funds to build
a school.</p>
<p>On 30th October, 1802, Governor King, writing to Lord Hobart,
says: "There are two hundred and sixteen children in the
Hawkesbury district, and the settlers are getting up a
subscription to build a school." (See <i>Historical Records</i>,
vol. 4, page 876.) This effort, however, failed, but two years
later a more successful movement was made with Government
assistance. In his despatches, dated 10th and 14th August, 1804,
Governor King reports that he had caused bricks to be burned, and
a spacious brick building of two stories, and measuring one
hundred feet by twenty-four feet, was then being roofed over, and
would be completed about October. A missionary
named&mdash;Harris, from Otaheite was available as a teacher.</p>
<p>The settlers agreed to pay at the rate of twopence per acre
held by them for a period of fourteen years to maintain a school
teacher who would also perform Divine service. (See <i>Historical
Records</i>, vol. 5, pages 412-13, 425.)</p>
<p>The following extract is from a General Order issued on 10th
August, 1804:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A school-room and chapel has been erected at the Hawkesbury
by the Government for the benefit of settlers in that
district.</p>
<p>"All for whom the benefit is designed are invited 60 become
subscribers for supporting the institution and maintaining the
chaplain and preceptor by the payment of twopence for each acre
of land they possess. All regulations to be determined by sis
subscribers and two magistrates, one of whom is to be the
principal chaplain."</p>
<p>The site of this school building was behind the Courthouse,
which was not then built, and close to the site of Thompson's
original bridge, which was in a line with Catherine Street,
Peninsula, below the tannery, just where the South Creek makes a
sharp bend to the south. The building is marked on two old plans
of Windsor, dated 1827 and 1834, as Government stables, formerly
school-house.</p>
<p>The school was opened in August, 1805, the first teacher being
probably one of the missionaries from Otaheite.</p>
<p>It was only in use as a school and church for a very short
time. Probably the big flood in 1806 drove them on to higher
ground, for in 1810 we find a large three-story granary was in
use as a temporary church and school. This was situated on the
site of the present School of Arts.</p>
<p>On 18th April, 1811, a public meeting was held to lake steps
for the erection of a school and church (see Chapter VII.).</p>
<p>The outcome of this meeting was the erection of a three-story
church and school on a site just behind the present School of
Arts, where a school was conducted by various teachers for about
thirty years.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know more of the early teachers,
but all we can trace is the appointment of Matthew Hughes, who
arrived in the Britannia, and taught first at Kissing Point, near
Sydney (1800 to 1810), then in Windsor from 1810-13. Two
interesting letters from Matthew Hughes appear in the
<i>Historical Records</i>, vol. 7, pages 277, 284. He had a large
family, the eldest daughter being Susanah, born before the year
1818. Some of the younger members of the family are still living
in the district, at an advanced age. Matthew Hughes was
transferred to the Richmond school in 1813, where he remained
till 1833. He died on December 25th, 1845.</p>
<p>The next teacher of this school, which was under the auspices
of and property of the Church of England, was Joseph Harpur, who,
with his wife, Sarah Harpur, arrived in the colony by the ships
<i>Royal Admiral</i> and <i>Alexander</i>. They had a family of
four children. The eldest, Elizabeth Harpur, died at Surry Hills,
Sydney, in October, 1895. Joseph, the second, became a journalist
in the Hunter River district about the forties. Charles was the
well-known Australian poet. He was born in Windsor, 23rd January,
1813. He was baptised in St. Matthew's Church, 23rd May, 1813, by
the Rev. Robt. Cartwright, his name being number one hundred and
sixty-seven in the old Baptism Register. He studied for a lawyer,
but was in the Government service at Araluen in the late fifties.
He died at his farm, near Eurobodalla, on the South Coast, on
10th June, 1868, and was buried on his farm. He married, in 1850,
Mary Doyle, who published a number of his poems after his death.
The youngest of Joseph Harpur's sons was John Mileham, whose
second christian name is that of a well-known medico at Windsor
(1813-23).</p>
<p>Joseph Harpur taught the school, and also held the office of
parish clerk, from 1813 to 1826. He retired on a pension about
the year 1843, and after trying to establish a business in
Windsor, he retired to Sydney.</p>
<p>Other teachers were: Mr. Gregory, 1826-27; William Edney,
1827-29; Charles and Mrs. Sommers, 1829-37; and James Daley,
1840-41.</p>
<p>About the year 1841 another school was built a little to the
south-east, between the former school and church and the police
barracks, on the site of Mr. George Boyd's cottage in Bridge
Street. Mr. Ed. Quaife was the first, teacher. Mr. John Tebbutt,
F.R.A.S., was among the first scholars. Mr. Quaife taught here
for about twenty-five years, 1841-1865.</p>
<p>Later teachers were: William Jordan (1868) and William Henry
Bailey (1869-75). Mr. Bailey afterwards kept a store at Castle
Hill. He died on 6th January, 1896, aged fifty-five years.</p>
<p>The last teacher on this historic site, or sites, was 8.
Russell, who had been in charge of the Wilberforce school for a
couple of years, and removed to Windsor in 1875, and remained
till about 1882, when he retired, and was presented with a gold
watch. The school was then closed up.</p>
<p>Further reference to the history and disposal of the site of
the school will be found under the beading of St. Matthew's
Church in Chapter VII.</p>
<p>There were other Church of England schools in the early days
in the district, besides Windsor and Richmond.</p>
<p>At Wilberforce a school was taught by Mr. P. Thompson
(1815-20), then by William Gow (1822-42). The descendants of the
last-named are well represented in the district to-day. Of his
eons we find that William went to Goulburn, James to St. Mary's,
Thomas died in Penrith in March, 1897, aged sixty-seven years;
while Stephen Gow died in Windsor, 13th May, 1914, aged
ninety-one years.</p>
<p>Later teachers at Wilberforce were: John Wenban, 1844; E.E.
Hinder, 1863-71; J.F. Nash, 1872-74; and S. Russell, 1874-75.</p>
<p>At Pitt Town there was a school taught from 1822-42 by T.D.
Wood; then by G. Baker, 1843-44; J.F. Hughes, 1863-64; G. Hughes,
1865; W. Bass, 1868; W.J. Quick, 1869-70; G. Lambert, 1871-73;
G.W. Webb, 1873-74; and A.M. Wellwood, 1874-75.</p>
<p>There was also a national school at Pitt Town, taught by M.
Willis, 1861-72.</p>
<p>At Sackville Reach the first teacher was J. Cotton,
1827-37.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Presbyterian Schools.</strong></p>
<p>Of other denominational schools in the district, the earliest
was the Presbyterian at Portland Head, or Ebenezer, where a
school was taught in 1809, and for some years later by the Rev.
J. Youl (see Chapter II., Pioneers). This school was taught for
thirty-four years by John Anderson, 1823-58. Mr. Anderson arrived
from Stirling, in Scotland, in 1821, and died on 16th July, 1858,
aged sixty-five years. His tomb in Ebenezer churchyard is visited
by many of his old pupils on each Anniversary Day, during the
annual fete held there.</p>
<p>A later teacher was E. Chatterton, 1863-64. He afterwards
taught the National School at Sackville Beach in 1871-74.</p>
<p>Matthew Long McFetridge taught the school from 1865 to 1875.
He died on 10th September, 1890, aged eighty-two years. His eon,
aged nineteen, was killed by blacks in Queensland, in March,
1876.</p>
<p>In Windsor the first Presbyterian school was taught by George
Walker, the father of the Hon. William Walker, M.L.C., for many
years, from about the year 1837. He died on 22nd September, 1883,
aged eighty-seven years. He had sixty-five scholars in 1839.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonald taught this school in 1864, and Mr. McClelland,
1865-68, in the old Oddfellows' Hall, and Mr. McCord, 1869-70,
when it was merged into the Public School.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Wesleyan Schools.</strong></p>
<p>The Wesleyans probably had a day-school in Windsor away back
in the twenties, but we have no record until 1839, when a girls'
school was established, with fifty names on the roll. Wesleyan
teachers were: A. Ross, 1843-44; Sarah Orton, 1847-48, and Mr.
Travis, 1853-60. The school was at this time held in the old
church vestry. Later teachers were: J.W. Steward, 1860; William
Piddock and Miss Sansom, 1863-65, and Locrin Tiddy, 1868-70, when
the school merged into the Public School. Mr. Tiddy then went to
Manly school. He died 30th August, 1914, aged seventy-eight
years, at Hurstville. Mrs. Tiddy died on 4th July, 1914, aged
seventy-six years.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Roman Catholic Schools.</strong></p>
<p>The first Roman Catholic school in Windsor was conducted by
James and Esther Cassidy, from 1835-44. There were one hundred
and four scholars on the roll in 1838, and the school was
somewhere in George Street, perhaps next the cemetery. Other
teachers were: C.A. McCann, 1847-48; M. Hynes, 1857, and finally
William B. Langton, 1863-82, when he was transferred to
Riverstone as the first Public School teacher located there. He
opened with sixty scholars, on the 15th January, 1883. In Windsor
his school was held in the hall still so used, next the church.
Mr. Langton was in Windsor in 1897 at the funeral of the Rev. J.
Hayes. Several very worthy pupils were turned oat by Mr. Langton
in Windsor. The school was amalgamated with the local Convent
school, and the local public school in 1882.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Public Schools.</strong></p>
<p>In the late sixties a movement was started with the object of
abolishing denominational schools and inaugurating a national
school for the town. All the schools were closed in 1870, with
the exception of the Church of England and Roman Catholic, and
they closed up in 1882. On 12th March, 1869, an acre of ground,
originally reserved for market purposes, was secured. This was
added to in 1872 and 1891, till now the grounds comprise two
acres, one rood, thirty-nine perches. The foundation stone of the
school was laid by Mr. (afterwards Sir Henry) Parkes, on 7th
September, 1869: and on 22nd February, 1870, Mr. Parkes again
visited Windsor to officially open the school. About that period
the Hon. William Walker was Member for Windsor in the New South
Wales Parliament, and he and Mr. William Dean, father of the
present Mayor of Windsor, were the principal members of the
School Board. To build the new school the inhabitants subscribed
one-third of the money required, the Government giving the other
two-thirds of the amount.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles A. Boult was the first head-master of the Windsor
Public School (1870-1). Then came Mr. James Anderson, who was
head-master from 1871 to 1892, a period of twenty-one years. The
parents of many of the children at present attending the school
were taught by Mr. Anderson. His son, Mr. Robert Anderson, B.A.,
was recently assistant teacher at Windsor. In July, 1890, the
Windsor school became a Superior Public School, and in 1892 Mr.
James Anderson was promoted to Waterloo, and then to Blackfriars,
where he finished his time as a teacher. Prior to coming to
Windsor he was head-master at Freeman's Reach Public School
(1869-71), and before that at Castlereagh (1864-9). For nineteen
years Mr. Anderson was an active member of the Volunteer Force,
and a lieutenant of the Windsor Company. In 1892 there were four
hundred and fifty names on the roll of the Windsor Superior
Public School.</p>
<p>Mr. A.H.B. Studdy next took charge of Windsor school, in 1892,
but remained only one year. He was a delicate man, and most of
the work of the head-master was done by Mr. W. Black, the
assistant. Mr. Studdy died in Sydney, in September, 1894, aged
fifty-four years. His son was a doctor at Riverstone, and
afterwards at North Sydney, and a daughter has a private school
at Lindfield.</p>
<p>In September, 1893, Mr. Charles E. Broome came from Dungog to
Windsor as head-master, and remained for seven years. In 1897
there was a big demonstration in Windsor to commemorate the
Record Reign of Queen Victoria. When everything was finished up,
there remained over a sum of fourteen pounds, and it was proposed
to devote the money towards the erection of a pavilion in the
park. When Mr. Broome was headmaster, as many as four hundred
children were at school on one day in June, 1894, while three
hundred and seventy was the average attendance for the month of
August. In 1894 a very sad accident happened in the school
ground. Nina II ay ward was burnt to death through her clothes
catching fire while papers were being burnt in the
playground.</p>
<p>From 1901 to 1904 Mr. T.J. Davis was head-master, then, in
1904, followed by Mr. S.A. Long (five years). Mr. J. Jacobs,
B.A., who succeeded Mr. Long in 1909, will be remembered by most
of the present school children. After being here for four years,
he was promoted to Mudgee District School, in 1913, and was
succeeded by Mr. A. Uren, who came from Gunnedah. The present
teacher, Mr. Wright-Smith, came from Temora in 1915.</p>
<p>Amongst others who were for a long time on the teaching staff
of the Windsor school are: Miss Macintosh, an excellent teacher;
and Mrs. O'Kelly, who, as Miss Collins, had a lot to do with the
training of the parents of many of the children now attending the
school. Miss Le Glaze will still be remembered by many of the
parents of to-day, as well as Miss Fitzgerald, now Mrs. A.
Tuckerman, of Windsor.</p>
<p>It might be well to mention here that there is another public
school site reserved in Newtown, fronting James and Church
Streets, containing one acre, three roods, twenty-eight perches,
as notified on 13th February, 1882, being allotments one to seven
of Section one.</p>

<h3>PRIVATE SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p>W<small>INDSOR</small>, in England, has its famous Eton
College, and our Windsor has also made several brave attempts to
set up famous seats of learning. At times there must have been a
choice of from six to eight different schools offering to
ambitious parents for the education of their boys and girls.</p>
<p>We dealt elsewhere with the four rival denominational schools,
so here we give a list, alas, fragmentary and incomplete, of
other schools, some of which, like Jonah's gourd, flourished for
a very short time, whilst others were long and favourably known
as most excellent educational establishments, which drew students
from other parts of the State, so that to-day many men high up in
the professional and mercantile world look back with pride to
their school days in Windsor. However, with the opening of the
twentieth century, Windsor appears to have come within the sphere
of the tentacles of Sydney and Parramatta, and her more ambitious
youth have been drawn there.</p>
<p>The private schools of which we find a record include the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1827-34, T.W. Fenton had a private school known as the
Hawkesbury School.</p>
<p>In 1836 Mr. and Mrs. John Brown kept a school in "York Lodge",
Captain Brabyn's old home, in George Street, near Brabyn Street.
The cottage is still standing. It is interesting to note its
numerous chimneys. The original entrance was on the east
side.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hadley had a school or academy in the same place in 1836.
She removed her school to Sydney soon after.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lambton had a ladies' school in the Peninsula about the
forties.</p>
<p>In 1842 a school was started on the Convent Bite in Mileham
Street, by the Rev. Mathew Adam, assisted by Mr. Jas Cosgrove.
The school was afterwards removed to "Fairfleld". Amongst the
scholars attending this school were: Mr. John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S.,
Mr. Wm. Walker, M.L.C., Mr. Henry Moses, M.L.C., Rev. R.W. Orton,
Mr. Stephen Brown (solicitor), Mr. S.H. Lambton, Deputy
Post-master, Sydney, Mr. Stanley Lambton, Mr. R. Ridge, J.P., and
Mr. J. Black, a successful land owner. A mural tablet to the
memory of the Rev. Mathew Adam was erected in the local
Presbyterian Church, of which he was the Minister, by a number of
his scholars, a copy of which will be found under the article
dealing with the Presbyterian Church, Chapter VIII.</p>
<p>In 1845 a school was taught in Windsor by Messrs. Cassidy and
McCann in a brick building in Bridge Street, which they rented
from the executors of Wm. Cross for thirty pounds a year.</p>
<p>In 1850 Rev. Hy. Carey kept a school in the present Police
Barracks, after the departure of the military regiments. Some of
the Bowman family were educated there. Mr. Carey afterwards rose
in the legal profession, and became one of the District Court
Judges. Judge Carey died in July, 1870.</p>
<p>Mrs. and Miss Black kept a school in 1849-57 in the building
next to the Royal Hotel in George Street.</p>
<p>Away back in the fifties, a school was taught in Catherine
Street by Mr. James Dawberry Brown, who is still hale and hearty,
living out at Ebenezer. He arrived in N.S.W. in the ship
<i>Clifton</i>, 1850 (see also Chapter X.).</p>
<p>In 1857 Miss Everset had a school opposite the Court House.
Mr. John Kennedy, the editor of the <i>Windsor Review</i>, and
one of the founders of the School of Arts, kept a boys' school in
"York Lodge", known as the "Windsor Commercial School". Among the
pupils in this 1857 school we find the following names:
Tuckerman, Webb, McDonald, Ridge, Laverack, Hoskisson, Mountford,
Stewart, Hobbs, Dargin, Pendergast, Barker, Robinson, Edwards,
and Moses.</p>
<p>In 1860, Mrs. Doyle, whose husband edited the <i>Windsor
Advertiser</i>, kept a school, first in Lilburn Hall, Bridge
Street, and afterwards in Fitzgerald Street. She was assisted by
Mrs. White. It was known as "Albaville Seminary".</p>
<p>In 1860, or earlier, "Everton College" was started by Rev.
C.F. Garnsey, in Bridge Street, Mr. J.P. McGuanne, who is a
member of the Council of the Australian Historical Society, being
one of the masters. When the Rev. C.F. Garnsey became rector of
St. Matthew's, Mr. J. Hole, one of his masters, took over the
school, and it was long known as Hole's Academy. It was carried
on in the large building still standing in Brabyn Street, at the
corner of Church Street. The school was still carried on here in
1874, and some of the members of the present Municipal Council,
we understand, received both education and chastisement in this
school.</p>
<p>In 1860-75, Mr. R.W. Thornton had a school in Bridge
Street.</p>
<p>A large ladies' school, known as St. Katherine's, was
conducted by Mrs. C.J. Nealds in Bridge Street, and afterwards in
Macquarie Street, about the years 1872-1882. Mr. C.J. Nealds was
local telegraph master for a few years in Windsor, in the
seventies. Mrs. Nealds had, in her younger days, been a governess
to the Royal family in England. She met with an accidental death
by being burnt at Coogee, on 24th May, 1896, in her
seventy-eighth year. The same school was taught by Miss
Wilkinson, 1876-8. She was the daughter of the Rev. S. Wilkinson,
Weselyan Minister. The Misses Flett were also in charge of this
school about the year 1882.</p>
<p>From 1874 to 1877 two Congregational Ministers kept a school
in George Street, the Rev. W.J. Webster and the Rev. E.
Leach.</p>
<p>A private school was opened by Mr. Bernard Keenan in the
Oddfellows' Hall about the year 1872, or earlier. After the fire
in 1874 the school was removed to "Lilburn Hall", Thompson
Square. In 1884 the hospital "poor land" at Blacktown Road was
leased for thirty years to Mr. Keenan at ten pounds a year ground
rent, and a large boarding school erected thereon. The school was
widely advertised and good masters were engaged, with the result
that one of the largest and most successful private schools
outside Sydney was carried on here for many years, giving an
impetus to the local tradesmen. Attention was given to drill, a
fine rifle corps being formed in 1891 among the boys. Sports of
all kinds were encouraged, and an asphalt cricket pitch was laid
down in 1896. Entertainments and other social functions were held
in the large dining-room, to which local residents were freely
invited. Mr. B. Keenan took an interest in local affairs. In 1878
he was a subscriber to the local hospital. He was at first an
enthusiastic member of the Church of England, and took part in
the services. He next became a member of the Presbyterian Church
in 1880, and used to preach in the Ebenezer and Pitt Town
churches, where he drew large audiences. His religious ardour
cooled down in later years, and he turned his attention to the
acquisition of local property, and also took an interest in more
public affairs, being made a J.P. in 1897, and the same year he
announced himself as a candidate for Parliamentary honours. After
disposing of his school in 1897, Mr. Keenan removed first to
Manly, and afterwards to Rose Bay, where he died on 1st November,
1912. His will was a rather unique and remarkable document which
gave the lawyers a lot of trouble to execute; and it also showed
that he lived a kind of dual life, for at his death he was
refused burial honours by his Masonic friends as well as by the
Roman Catholic Church, to which it is known he wished to secretly
belong when he left Windsor in 1997. He expressed in his will a
wish to be buried in the local Roman Catholic cemetery, but this
was, under the circumstances, wisely refused, and he was buried
quietly in the Waverley cemetery.</p>
<p>The school was taken over in 1898 by the Rev. Dr. Mantel, and
he passed it on to Mr. W.J. Young, M.A., in 1899, who conducted
it up to the year 1909. It was later taken over by Mr. J. Bennett
Little. This large school building in February, 1915, passed into
the hands of the local Hospital Trustees. The school was closed a
few years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. J.G. Young kept a very good school, known as the "High
School", opposite the Court House, in the Peninsula, about the
years 1888-1892.</p>
<p>Mr. J.T. Fitzgerald, B.A., had a school known as Etham College
in George Street, opposite the Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p>Mr. Eckford Firth had a boys' school in the Methodist school
hall.</p>
<p>There were many small schools taught by various ladies in
different parts during the nineties, among them were: Misses
Hopkins, Olson, Moran, Greenwell, McGilvray, Linsley, and
Busby.</p>
<p>Madame Naegueli had a school for girls, known as the
Pastalozzi School, from 1888-1895. She was followed by Mrs.
Jerdan, who had a girls' high school in the Church of England
Hall.</p>
<p>Another good school was taught by Mrs. Tuckerman, in Mileham
Street.</p>
<p>The only schools at present in Windsor are the Public School
and St. Joseph's Convent High School, and the Roman Catholic
Primary School. The latter took up the work about the time that
the denominational school, so long taught by Mr. Wm. B. Langton,
was closed.</p>

<h3>MAGISTRATES.</h3>
<p>B<small>EFORE</small> the year 1810 the Hawkesbury was
included in the Parramatta Magisterial district. Amongst those
who exercised the Magistrate's office before 1810 in this part
were the Rev. S. Marsden, Dr. Thomas Arndell, Mr. C. Grimes, and
Mr. William Cox. But, when Governor Macquarie laid out the
various Hawkesbury townships in 1810 he appointed the following
as special magistrates for each centre:&mdash;</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson, Windsor; and on his death in October, 1810,
William Cox, of Clarendon, 1810-36.</p>
<p>Dr. Jas. Mileham for Pitt Town, and afterwards for
Castlereagh, 1810-23.</p>
<p>Rev. Robert Cartwright for Wilberforce, 1813-1818.</p>
<p>Rev. Henry Fulton for Castlereagh, 1815-1823.</p>
<p>Captain John Brabyn took the Rev. R. Cartwright's place in
1817, holding office until 1829.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie appointed in 1811 a bench of three of the
above to sit weekly in Windsor, and deal with special cases from
the surrounding districts, namely: Mr. Wm. Cox, Dr. James
Mileham, and Rev. R. Cartwright.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his term Governor Macquarie appointed
Lieut. Archd. Bell as the first paid magistrate at Windsor, and
he had associated with him Capt. Brabyn and Wm. Cox. Lieut. Bell
held office as Police Magistrate until the year 1834.</p>
<p>Short sketches of the lives of the above magistrates are given
under the heading of Pioneers, in Chapter II.</p>
<p>The next Appointment was that of Dr. Wm. Richardson,
1829-36.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel North, 1830-43. Mr. North succeeded Lieut. Bell as
Police Magistrate, and lived in the old Government House. There
is a street in the Peninsula called after him, and he was a life
member of the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society. He took a leading
part in the 1843 election, and was relieved of office the
following year. He died about the year 1863. His fine property,
"Northfield", at Kurrajong, was afterwards secured and greatly
improved by the late Hon. Jas. Comrie, who died at the age of
eighty-six, at "Northfield", on November 2nd, 1902 (see also
Chapter XVI.).</p>
<p>William Cox, junior, of "Hobartville", was appointed in 1830,
holding office until his death, at the age of sixty years, on
20th January, 1850.</p>
<p>Mr. Geo. M.C. Bowen was a magistrate, 1831-39, when he was
removed to Berrima, but came back, and the family seat was "Bowen
Mount" for many years.</p>
<p>Mr. Jas. Thos. Bell, of "Belmont", sat on the magistrate's
bench, 1839-44.</p>
<p>Mr. Josiah A. Betts, of Wilmington, near Riverstone, was a
magistrate, 1843-44. He was hon. secretary of the Benevolent
Society, 1843-49. Mr. Betts was also one of the seven members of
the District Council formed in 1841, but which was only
short-lived, expiring in 1846.</p>
<p>In the year 1843 both candidates for Parliamentary honours
were placed on the list of magistrates, Mr. Robert Fitzgerald,
M.L.C., holding office up to 1860, when he probably ceased to
reside in the district. His death took place 9th May, 1865, at
the age of fifty-eight years. William Macarthur Bowman, M.L.A.,
of Richmond, held office until his death, at the age of
seventy-five, on 11th December, 1874.</p>
<p>After a lapse of some eight years, Mr. Jas. Ascough was raised
to the bench of magistrates. He was one of the original trustees
of the School of Arts. He held office in the Benevolent Society.
He was also chairman of the meeting held in 1860 to inaugurate
the Hawkesbury Volunteers. His residence was the quaint old
cottage next to the Presbyterian Church, the property being still
held by a member of his family, and was built by Joseph Cope, in
the thirties.</p>
<p>Captain John Larking Scarvell, of "Clare House", Killarney,
where he resided as early as 1835, was a magistrate in
1851-61.</p>
<p>Sydney Scarvell also lived there, and was a magistrate from
1859 till his death on 9th December, 1875.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen Tuckerman, of Sackville Beach, was appointed in
1851, being a very old and respected resident of the Hawkesbury
River, where the family has lived ever since the days of Governor
Macquarie. Some of the family went away many years ago to the
Mudgee district. Stephen Tuckerman died at the age of sixty-nine,
on the 1st February, 1875. He was married to Sarah Beasley, on
27th January, 1823, by the Rev. John Cross, in St. Matthew's,
Windsor.</p>
<p>Mr. George Bowman, M.L.C., of Richmond, was a magistrate from
1856 up to the time of his death, on the 26th August, 1878. It
was he who built the Richmond Presbyterian Church, in 1845, and
presented it to that denomination, adding the spire and clock in
1877.</p>
<p>Mr. William McQuade was a magistrate, 1857-59. He died on 3rd
April, 1885, aged fifty-eight.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry Day was also on the bench, 1857-71.</p>
<p>Mr. Jas. Bligh Johnston, who was born at Portland Head in
1809, was a magistrate for thirty-three years up till the time of
his death, at the age of eighty-two, on 16th September, 1891. He
also held the office of coroner for the district for twenty
years, being succeeded by his son, the present occupant of the
office. He was also the Returning Officer for the electorate for
some years in succession to Mr. Robert Dick, and this office was
subsequently filled by his son. He was also for thirty-eight
years connected with the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, for
nearly thirty years occupying the responsible office of
president. Another institution in which this worthy citizen took
on interest was in the Windsor Branch of the Bible Society.</p>
<p>During the sixties and seventies the following Richmond
residents were appointed to the Bench, holding office for varying
periods, and in the undermentioned order: Messrs. Ed. Powell,
G.M. Pitt, Jas. Comrie, Arthur Dight, Sloper Cox, Andrew Town,
Hy. Newcomen, John Ducker, Wm. Lamrock, W.H. Holborow, and
Richard Skuthorpe.</p>
<p>The Windsor Magistrates appointed at this time
were:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. S.H. Terry, 1865-79.</p>
<p>Mr. Hy. Moses, M.L.C., 1868-79.</p>
<p>Mr. J.M. McQuade, appointed in 1868, holding office until his
death, aged sixty-five, on 19th August, 1891.</p>
<p>Mr. J.M. McQuade was for many years the visiting justice at
the local gaol, and figured prominently in things social and
political, editorial and municipal. He was, although last on the
roll of elected candidates, one of the original Municipal Council
in 1871, and was Mayor in 1874; and after him the local park is
sometimes, and sometimes not, called McQuade Park.</p>
<p>During the year 1870 no less than Ave appointments were made
to the bench of magistrates, all good and worthy citizens. They
are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin Richards, who died, at the age of eighty, on 5th
March, 1898. It was he who started and successfully developed the
Riverstone meat industry. He was for some years chairman of the
Hawkesbury Race Club.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Ridge, who died, at the age of seventy-nine, on
27th May, 1892, was a large coach proprietor, running the mails
to and from Sydney in the forties, from his Horse and Jockey
Hotel, on the site at present occupied by the Commercial Banking
Co. of Sydney. He was a trustee, and also for twenty-two years a
vice-president of the Benevolent Society.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Edgerton, who died, at the age of seventy-eight, on
August 16th, 1878. He arrived with H.M. 80th Foot in 1836, as
bandmaster. He did not return with his regiment in 1844, but took
up his residence in Windsor, in the Peninsula, taking an active
part in the Hawkesbury Volunteers, of which he was the first
captain, in 1860. Capt. Edgerton also assisted in the various
efforts to establish a town band, but such efforts in Windsor, as
elsewhere, were generally short-lived (see also Chapter
XVII.).</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Dick was also appointed in 1870, taking a large
share of the work for nearly thirty years, as he was widely
recognised as a "good man, and a just." He died at the age of
seventy-seven, on 18th October, 1898. He was guardian of minors
for the district for over twenty years. For many years during the
seventies he acted as Returning Officer for the electorate. He
was elected in 1871 as one of the original Municipal Council,
being also elected as the first Mayor of the town. Mr. Dick was
one of the founders of the volunteer movement and held office as
lieutenant. He was one of the promoters of the Windsor Gas Co.
The Benevolent Society found in him a generous subscriber, and he
was a trustee for over thirty years. One of the new wards is well
named the "Robert Dick." He was a leading member of the
Presbyterian Church, and an elder for twenty-four years. A tablet
to his memory has been placed on the walls. Mr. Dick visited
Scotland during the years 1872-73, receiving a very cordial
welcome home from the inhabitants of Windsor.</p>
<p>Mr. Wm. S. Hall, 1870-1880. He died, aged seventy-five, on
27th July, 1894, and was the father of Mr. Brinsley Hall, M.L.A.
Mr. W.S. Hall was the third son of Mr. George Smith Hall, senior,
of Sackville Reach, who died in 1879, aged eighty-two, and
grandson of Mr. George Hall, who was one of the pioneers who
built Ebenezer Church in 1809, and who died in 1840, at the age
of seventy-seven. The Hall family is thus one of those fine old
types of families which have done so much to build up the
Hawkesbury district, generation after generation.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Raper, 1874-1880.</p>
<p>Mr. William Hall Johnston, of Sackville Reach, was appointed
in 1876, and met his death, aged sixty-eight, by being thrown
from his horse on 2nd January, 1897.</p>
<p>Mr. William Gosper, 1878-1905. He died, aged eighty, on 12th
July, 1908. Mr. Wm. Gosper was one of the original Municipal
Councillors in 1871, retaining his seat up till 1897, when he
resigned. He was elected Mayor in 1877, and again in 1891. He
also took a keen interest in the local fire brigade.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry Albert McQuade held office, 1880-94. He died, aged
thirty-nine, 12th February, 1898.</p>
<p>Mr. A. Tuckerman and Dr. J. Callaghan were appointed in the
year 1880, and are, therefore, at present, the senior magistrates
of the district.</p>
<p>The other magistrates appointed in the eighties were John
Henry Fleming, 1882-94. He died, aged seventy-eight, on 20th
August, 1894, and was for thirty-two years a church warden in the
Wilberforce Church of England.</p>
<p>S.J. Dunston, 1882-98; G.T. Collins, 1882-86; Thos. Primrose,
1884-1905. He died, aged seventy-eight, on 1st December, 1905. He
was another of the original Municipal Councillors, elected in
1871, and was Mayor in 1879, and again in 1883 and in 1886.</p>
<p>Mr. D. Holland, 1886-1905. He was elected to the Municipal
Council in 1891, and was Mayor in 1892.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Moses, 1885-1905; Mr. Bernard Conlan, 1886-1904; Mr.
W.F. Linsley, 1886-1903. The latter was a very active worker in
the volunteers, Council, and in other ways up till his death,
aged seventy-two, on 5th February, 1903.</p>
<p>Mr. Jas. B. Johnston was appointed in 1888, and Mr. Brinsley
Hall, M.L.A., in 1890.</p>
<p>As we have reached to quite modern times, and are dealing with
the historical, we must stop.</p>

<h3>COURT HOUSE OFFICIALS.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Police Magistrates.</strong></p>
<p>"T<small>HIS</small> first batch of magistrates were: William
Cox, Dr. Mileham and Rev. R Cartwright, in 1810. In 1820, Lieut.
Archibald Bell was appointed as Chief Magistrate, and with hint
were associated Captain Brabyn and William Cox. The magistrates
in these days had a strong body of the chief settlers known as
the Grand Jury associated with them. An interesting reference to
their work in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of October 21st, 1826, is
as follows: "The Windsor Grand Jury on October 12th, 1826, were:
John Dight (foreman), Richard Rouse, Henry Cox, John Single,
George Bowman, William Faithful, James Mein, John Johnston,
William Hall, Thomas Arndell, John Grono, George Hall, Andrew
Johnston, John Atkinson, and Jonas Bradley. They petitioned for
better accommodation at the court-house, and suggested that the
further end of the building should be fitted up for the purpose.
They also petitioned for additions and repairs to the local
gaol."</p>
<p>Lieut. Bell held office till 1830, when he was succeeded by
Samuel North, 1830-44, and during the tatter's term of office,
Courts of Petty Sessions were first ordered to be held in Windsor
on 30th September, 1832. It might be mentioned that Captain
Samuel North arrived in New South Wales in 1826, with the 102nd
Regiment, of which he was a lieutenant, having previously served
in the 27th Inniskillens. He entered the public service on 7th
May, 1827, and was superintendent of Government bonded stores
until his appointment to Windsor in 1830, where he acted as
Police Magistrate up till 1844. He took a too active part in the
election of 1843, which may have accounted for, not his
retirement, but his removal to Berrima, where he remained till
1847, and was then sent to Carcoar, 1848-51, from whence he was
transferred to Sydney. In 1859 he was appointed Water Police
Magistrate to the Port of Sydney, which office he held up till
his death which took place at Woolloomooloo, 4th June, 1864, aged
seventy-three years. He was buried in St. Jude's cemetery,
Randwick. He left a family of three sons and six daughters. One
son and one daughter are living at present. The following
advertisement, from <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>, Tuesday,
October 22nd, 1844, giving the date of his removal from Windsor,
is interesting: "Windsor.&mdash;Mr. George Seymour has the honour
to announce that he has received instructions from Samuel North,
Esq., Police Magistrate, who is removing to Berrima, to sell by
public auction, at Government Cottage, Windsor, on Saturday, the
26th instant, at Eleven o'clock precisely, several Horses and
Mares, Milking Cattle, Waggon, Drags, and Carts: and further
articles."</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Clerk of Petty Sessions.</strong></p>
<p>The Clerk of Petty Sessions was known in the early days as the
Magistrate's Clerk, the Clerk of the Bench, or the Clerk of the
Court. The office was filled first by Andrew Johnston, who built
one of the first hotels in the district, known as the "King's
Arms", and later as the "Macquarie Arms". He was found drowned at
Killarney. George Smith held the office from 1813 to 1819; Robert
Fitz, 1819 to 1834; Henry Bailey, 1836; Alfred Holden, 1835 to
1838; and G.T. Wyatt, 1838 to 1844. George Augustus Gordon held
the office from 1840 to 1870, and also acted as Police Magistrate
in succession to Samuel North. He died on 21st February, 1909, at
the age of eighty-six years. William Henry Thomas followed, 1870
to 1873, when he was removed to Wollongong. He died at Grafton,
in August, 1893, aged sixty-seven years. William Henry Hughes
Becke, who was an uncle of Louis Becke, the author, came in 1873,
and remained till 1889. He was afterwards a Police Magistrate,
and retired in 1896. He died 17th July, 1910. Mrs. Becke died
18th September, 1896. From 1889 to date the office has been
filled by: O.A.S. Fitzpatrick, 1889; H.T. McAlister, 1896; W.I.
Perry, 1898; A. Gates, 1900; E.H. Page, 1904; E.J. Harrison,

<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Chief Constables.</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Rickerby, 1800. He had a grant of land in the centre of
the town, running to the creek, known as "Catherine Farm". This
grant passed into the hands of the Cope family, who cut up a
portion in 1838, hence we have a Catherine Street and a Rickerby
Creek in Windsor. Thomas Rickerby died on 15th May, 1848, aged
sixty-seven years. Andrew Thompson, 1804; Mathew Lock, 1810; John
Howe, 1813-25. The latter succeeded Andrew Thompson in the local
office of auctioneer and appraiser. He or his son also did some
exploring in the Maitland district. Howe's bridge was built by
him over the South Creek, and he was a relative of Robert Howe,
printer, of the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>. He had two daughters, Mary
and Eliza. The Howe family was connected by marriage with several
old families in the district, such as the Loders, Wisemans, Dr.
Dowe, Dargins, and Laban White. The next Chief Constable was
George Jilks, 1826-27, and again in 1839-40. In 1826, Constable
Green, aged twenty-five, was foully murdered in the execution of
his duty. Then followed Ben Hodghsen, 1827-35; George Shirley,
1840-44; William Hobbs, 1850-61; Jeremiah Frewin, 1862; John
James Fitzpatrick, August, 1869, to September, 1893. He was the
father of Mr. J.C.L. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., who started the
<i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i> in 1888, and of Mr. O.A.S.
Fitzpatrick, a former C.P.S. in Windsor. He retired with the rank
of Sub-Inspector, and died 26th November, 1899, aged sixty-nine
years. Senior Sergeant George Boyd, from Carcoar, followed in
1894; Senior-Sergeant Peter J. Nies, from Parramatta, came next,
followed by Senior-Sergeant Henry Norris, from Deniliquin, in
1908; and Senior-Sergeant Sim, from Temora, in 1914.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Gaol Keepers.</strong></p>
<p>George Loder, a grandson of John Howe, held this office from
1820, or earlier, to 1829; G. Walpole, 1829-35; Thomas Keenan,
1842. It was part of the duties of the gaol-keeper to put certain
prisoners in the stocks in those days. The stocks were placed in
George Street, near the School of Arts site. Michael Raper
followed in the sixties. In his time a warder named Spinks was
foully murdered by a prisoner with an axe, his grave being: in
St. Matthew's Churchyard. Eugene McCabe, 1875-81, when he was
transferred to Gundagai, where he died 25th December, 1896.
Arthur Berckelman, 1882-86, a veteran of the Crimean Light

cutting through four inches of hardwood and picking two locks
with a piece of wire. H. Elbest, 1887-92; J. Murdoch, 1892-1900.
N. Easterbrooke, 1901-3. Later men only remained for short
periods, the gaol being no longer used for long-sentence men. The
present gaol was built in 1859 on the site of a still earlier
gaol.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Coroners.</strong></p>
<p>Lieut. Thomas Hobby, 1811-26. He belonged to the 102nd
Regiment, and assisted William Cox in the construction of the

<h3>MILITARY.</h3>
<p>A<small>S</small> early as June, 1797, Lieut. N. Mackellar was
in charge of a military detachment at the Hawkesbury, being a
portion of the 102nd Regiment, or New South Wales Corps. It was
for this military officer's use that the old Government House at
Windsor was built, about the year 1798. From this date up till
1842 Windsor was the centre of much military activity. The
barracks erected especially for the use of the soldiers, about
1820, are still standing, and portion of the present hospital
building was originally the military hospital.</p>
<p>In the early times the soldiers were called on to assist in
harvesting the crops. Many of the old residents of the district
are the descendants of soldiers, who, when their time expired,
preferred to settle in the colony instead of returning to the old
land.</p>
<p>A detachment of the 73rd Regiment, which came out with
Governor Macquarie in 1809, was settled here for a few years. In
1825, the military at Windsor consisted of one sergeant, one
corporal, and fifty-six privates. In 1835-37 a detachment of His
Majesty's 50th Foot, under Lieut.-Colonel Woodhouse, were
stationed at Windsor. They were succeeded in 1838-30 by the 80th
Foot, formerly known as the Staffordshire. The regiment arrived
in New South Wales in various ships from 1836 to 1840, and was
removed to India in August, 1844. Among the officers were:
Lieut.-Colonel N. Baker, and Adjutant Lightbody. (See
<i>Reminiscenses</i>, by Wm. Walker, page 8). The bandmaster,
Samuel Edgerton, settled in Windsor, and became a magistrate. He
organised a local band, and took part in the formation of the
local Volunteers in 1860. He died 16th August, 1878, aged
seventy-eight years (see also Chapter XV.).</p>
<p>Another Regiment stationed here was the 99th Duke of
Edinburgh, daring 1842-43. The officers were Captain Reid and
Lieutenant Beatty. At other times the 58th and 83rd Regiments
were represented here. With the cessation of transportation to
New South Wales in the early forties, the military were withdrawn
from Windsor. The officers for many years occupied the building
now known as the Royal Hotel.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Volunteers.</strong></p>
<p>In the year 1854 the Government passed legislation which led
to the formation of a number of local corps, but the movement did
not catch on till 1860, when a large number of men enlisted in
the various towns of New South Wales as volunteers. Windsor was
early in the field, the Hawkesbury corps being formed on 5th
October, 1860, the first officers being Captain S. Edgerton and
Lieutenant Sydney Scarvell. The first meeting called to form the
Windsor Volunteer Corps was held on 19th September, 1860, when a
deputation was appointed to wait on the Government and offer the
services of thirty-six loyal subjects. The deputation consisted
of William Walker, M.L.A., James Ashcough, J.P., Robert Dick,
J.P., and Sydney Scarvell, J.P. The movement went forward with
enthusiasm. The Governor, Sir J. Young, came up to Windsor to
present the colours, and a steamer conveyed over three hundred
volunteers from Sydney right up to Windsor to assist in the local
demonstration. The corps was known as the Hawkesbury Volunteer
Rifles from 1862 to 1882. The name was then altered to the
Hawkesbury Infantry. We give here only the early officers, with
their promotions:&mdash;</p>
<p>Samuel Edgerton, Captain, 1860-72. Retired 1872.</p>

<p>About the time of the outbreak of the Boer war, in the year
1899, the Hawkesbury Squadron of NEW SOUTH WALES LANCERS was
formed, with half squadrons at Windsor and Richmond. The original
officers were: Captain Brinsley Hall, Captain R.B. Walker and
Lieut. N. Hall, for Windsor; Major Philip Charley, Captain W.T.
Charley and Lieut. H. Skuthorp, for Richmond. The uniform was
light brown with red facings, and a felt hat adorned with a
plume. On retiring from the squadron, presentations were made to
Captain Brinsley Hall, M.L.A., and Major Philip Charley.</p>
<p>About the year 1903 the name of the Lancers was changed to the
AUSTRALIAN LIGHT HORSE. The Hawkesbury Squadron was successful in
winning the Prince of Wales Cup, 1906-7, which was open for
competition to all the mounted troops in Australia. Four teams
competed, both Victoria and South Australia being represented.
The competition was over a three mile course, with three firing
competitions of five shots each at a target, and between each
firing three hurdles had to be negotiated. The local team who
brought this rare trophy to the district were: Captain Brinsley
Hall (leader), S.Q.M. Sgt. Owens, Sgt. Hibbert, Sgt. Timmins,
Sgt. Fallow, Sgt. Dunston, Far.-Sgt. Huxley, Corp. White, Corp.
McMartin, Tpr. Aubrey, Tpr. J. Greentree, Tpr. A. Greentree, Tpr.
Mason, and Tpr. Armstrong.</p>
<p>A number of mounted men went from the district to the Boer
War, which was in progress from 1898 to 1902. A monument will be
seen in Windsor Park to the memory of those who went, but "came
not back." The artistic earring on the pedestal is the work of
the late J. O'Kelly, and it will repay a little study.
Unfortunately, it was not enclosed at first with a fence, and its
proximity to the local school tempted some embryo iconoclasts
whose marks remain. The inscriptions on the monument
read:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">In memory of soldiers from
Windsor and District who lost their lives in the service of the
Empire in South Africa.<br>
<br>
This monument was erected as a token of respect by the residents
of Windsor.</p>
<p class="negindent">Trooper <small>GEORGE ARCHIE
MONTGOMERY</small>, killed at Zeerust, South Africa, 27th
October, 1900.</p>
<p class="negindent">Trooper <small>CHARLES JOHN GOSPER</small>,

November, 1901.</p>
<p class="negindent">Farrier Sergeant <small>GEORGE JENNINGS
DICKSON</small>, who died of enteric fever at Standerton, South
Africa, 9th January, 1902.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the Windsor and Riverstone district
soldiers who have volunteered for the war. The list was closed
early in December, 1915; many others will doubtless follow at a
later date. The list it will be noted does not include the
Richmond, McDonald, Colo, or St. Albans districts, nor a dozen
immigrants from the Scheyville training farm:&mdash;</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<h3>HOTELS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> hotels of the early days, if they could
only now be made to speak, would throw great light on the past
history of this and every other early settlement.</p>
<p>In the early days, before Halls and Schools of Art were built,
they were the only centres of social life. Some were conducted in
the moat honourable and upright manner, while others were simply
dens of infamy, where crime was hatched and the law defied.</p>
<p>Amongst the first things Governor Macquarie did was to close
up a large number of the worst houses along the river, leaving
about half a dozen. We do not know which these were in 1810, but
we find the following list in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 17th
February, 1821:&mdash;Royal Oak, William Baker; Lord Nelson, Jas.
Doyle; Plough Inn, Charles Beasley; Green Dragon, Thos. Dargon;
Hope and Anchor, George Kable;&mdash;&mdash;, Henry Kable,
senr.</p>
<p>In the present article we shall endeavour to locate some of
these; but owing to recurrence, duplications, and changes of
names, both of owners and hotels, as well as removals and
transfers, many difficulties are met with in compiling an
accurate list.</p>
<p>From various sources we find the number of public houses open
at the one time in Windsor given thus: In 1811, six; 1822, five;
1837, thirteen; 1843, fourteen; 1845, sixteen; 1857, sixteen. In
1866, 1875, 1894, 1910 the number is seven; at present, 1915,
six.</p>
<p>The oldest continuous license is held by the Fitzroy Hotel,
running back for over fifty years, probably to the days of
Governor Fitzroy, 1846-1855.</p>
<p>The Commercial is probably as old, but the license was lost
for about twelve months in 1893. The latest new licenses are the
Carrington, in 1888, and the Royal, in 1874. This license and
name may have been transferred from the Royal Hotel opposite the
Presbyterian Church. The Royal Exchange is also one of the
latest, but it was transferred from the Barraba Hotel, burnt in
1874.</p>
<p>It might be of interest to mention the hotels that have been
last closed: Hawkesbury River, closed in 1913 by reduction vote;
Farmer's Family, license transferred in 1893 to the Commercial;
Barraba, burnt down 1874; Court House, closed about 1882; and the
Rose Inn and Oddfellows' or Butcher's Arms, closed 1879.</p>
<p>In describing the situation of the various past and present
hotels, we wish to avoid reference to the present occupants of
premises, as far as possible, as this is confusing to the future
historian and is out of date in a very few years.</p>
<p>So many changes having taken place in many of the proprietary,
we shall refer chiefly only to those long in occupation. We give
in the accompanying list the location of forty-six (more or less)
public-house sites in and near Windsor, but excluding Magrath's
Hill. We will take the streets in regular order, beginning at the
Peninsula end:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Court Street</i>.&mdash;Court House Hotel, built by John
Shearing, opposite the court-house, about the year 1870. Mrs.
Shearing died at Stanmore, 17th February, 1893. Robert Leddra
kept the place about 1877. He died 6th June, 1882, aged sixty
years. This building was afterwards used as a private school by
Mr. J.G. Young, 1888-92.</p>
<p>2. <i>Bridge Street</i> (corner of Court Street, next the
South Creek.)&mdash;On this site one of the first hotels was
built, in 1813, by Andrew Johnston, Clerk of Court, called at
first the King's Arms, and later Macquarie Arms, and finally the
Windsor Hotel (1857). It was here the banquet was held in 1817 to
celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of St Matthew's
Church. It was occupied by&mdash;Ransom (1815), and William Cross
(1837), and sold by his executors in 1845; and by J. Mawson
(1857). The place was swept away by the 1867 flood, and not a
trace of it remains to-day.</p>
<p>3. At one time we believe two public-houses stood on or near
this corner. (See Crosse's executors' sale notice in <i>S.M.
Herald</i>, 15th May, 1845).</p>
<p>4. On the opposite side, now the Carrington (Lord Carrington
was Governor of New South Wales, 1885-90), formerly stood the
Currency Lass, and later the Dove Inn. It may have also been
known as the Harp of Erin, kept by E. McDonald, in 1857. The
premises were damaged by flood waters, and the present building
was subsequently erected. It was greatly improved, and a balcony
added in 1880, when it was re-opened as an hotel, a thousand
loads of material being carted to raise the yard above the flood
level in 1892. The site has not been in continuous use as an
hotel. It was used as a school, and also as a residence, for many
years. Among the old landlords have been such names as Thos.
Cullan, 1837; John Shearing, 1843; D. Maher;&mdash;Clare; A.
Dalton, 1857; McDonald, 1864; Jas. Gosper, 1866-67. After a lapse
of twenty years a license was again obtained by R. Huggins,
1886-1904.</p>
<p>5, 6. <i>Thompson Square</i>&mdash;Two sites, both still
standing, one a balconied house, just below the Royal Hotel, and
the other for long, and still occupied by the local doctors,
close to the river. We have not the names by which these were
known, but in the forties the Show meetings were held here in
Coffey's Hotel. Other names attached to these two sites are:
Doyle, about the year 1830, when the Lord Nelson Hotel may have
been hereabouts; Jas. Howe, Panton, Fisher, and James Ridge; the
latter as late as 1870.</p>
<p>The Post Office was kept in the doctor's home in 1850, at
which time it had no balcony.</p>
<p>7. At the corner of <i>Freeman's Reach</i> and <i>Wilberforce
Roads</i>, just across the river, stood the old Squatter's Arms,
kept by one Ryan. The old ruin has only recently been removed.
The house originally resembled the old Government House. It was
open from about 1846 to 1867.</p>
<p>8. <i>Macquarie Street</i> (corner of Bridge Street, south
side)&mdash;In a very old plan of Windsor this corner is marked
as McQuade's Inn. We have not been able to find the latest name
of the hotel, but one, Morgan Carroll, was in the business here
in 1843-45. McDonald, Dunstan, Bullock (1857), Donnelly, and as
late as 1870, Maher, were, we believe, on this or some
neighbouring site. In 1857 the building was known as The
Sportsman, and at another time as The Traveller's Befit.</p>
<p>9. In <em>Macquarie Street</em> (on south side near Baker
Street), stood the Jim Crowe. This was an early house, kept by
Henry Hudson (1837-46), who ran a coach to Sydney in opposition
to that run by Ridge; and afterwards by Jas. Lane and others. The
house, which is still standing, was closed about 1878 as an
hotel.</p>
<p>10. Next door to the above stood the Hole in the Wall, kept,
we understand, by J. Rafter (1833-45), and later by Chafe,
Gosper, Egan and Lovell. The hotel was called at one time, "Help
a Lame Dog over the Stile", and also the "Erin go Bragh". It has
now disappeared.</p>
<p>11. In <i>Macquarie Street</i> (north side, near the Weselyan
School Hall), an hotel was kept for a short time by R. Dunstan,
but we have neither date or name.</p>
<p>12-13. <i>Macquarie Street</i> (near Suffolk Street)&mdash;Two
buildings near here were once need as hotels. We have not the
names, but here the Dorset family were going strong in the
sixties and the early seventies. Thompson and Levy also kept the
place later. One may have been known as the Oddfellows' in
1867.</p>
<p>14. <i>Macquarie Street</i> (opposite the Convent
gates)&mdash;Here the Rising Sun was found in 1837-52, kept by
William Heath, J. Cough, and J. Dorset.</p>
<p>15. <i>George Street</i>&mdash;We will take first the south
side, beginning opposite Thompson Square, next Moses's store. The
Sir John Young Hotel. Sir John Young was Governor of New South
Wales, 1861-67, so we presume the place was licensed about that
time. It was kept by Q. Hall (1866-68); Bushell (1868-74); Cain
or Kane, and R. Leddra. The name was changed to Hawkesbury River
Inn, then shortened to Hawkesbury Hotel. The balcony was added in
1893. Later names found over the door were, we think, Walmsley,
Crowley, Horwood. Booth, and the last James Walsh. It was closed
about 1912 by an electorate reduction vote, and the place was
destroyed by fire early in 1913, and demolished in 1915.</p>
<p>16. Between <i>Baker Street</i> and <i>Fitzgerald Street</i>.
These are the sites of at least six hotels, although we have
found difficulty in exactly locating and describing them, but we
believe the order was first, the Butcher's Arms. This place was
near Baker Street, on the east side, kept in the seventies by
Cavanough. Political meetings in 1843 were held here.</p>
<p>17. Red Lion stood near <i>Baker Street</i>, on the west side,
about Dyer's shop. It is mentioned in Charles Harpur's play
called "Bushrangers". It was kept by Mary Dargin in 1835-37, and
may have been the site of the Green Dragon in the twenties.</p>
<p>18. 19. Barley Mow, close to <i>Kable Street</i>, was kept in
1837 by Robert Smith, known as "the Ginman;" and later by Jas.
Cullen. Another hotel stood close by, perhaps next to the
Congregational Church. It may have been the Golden Nugget,
Cricketers' Arms, 1857-60, or Barley Corn at different times. It
was, we understand, kept by the Kable family at one time, and
also by G. Freeman (1857). These two are difficult to trace.
There may have been only one here.</p>

<br>
<p>20. Between the Bank of New South Wales and the Poet Office
stood two hotels aide by aide. The White Hart, kept by Durham in
1840, then by W. Blanchard and Charles Beasley, 1843-65; also by
J. Baker, Byrnes and by Hall, at the earliest period of its
history in the thirties.</p>
<p>21. Plough Inn. This was even an earlier house than its
neighbour. It was associated with the name of Edward Robinson in
1835-45. Some of the earliest meetings connected with the
Agricultural Society were held there.</p>
<p>22. Bird in the Hand.&mdash;This old hotel stood in
<i>Fitzgerald Street</i>, between the Post Office and the
Methodist Parsonage. Here William Bowman's political meetings
were held in 1843. It was kept at different times by Primrose
(1837-45). Henwright, Gamble, and Burnes. We have not been able
to trace it after the fifties.</p>
<p>23. Barraba.&mdash;This hotel stood on the corner opposite the
Post Office, and was built by John Hoskisson, about 1857. It was
kept by C. Blanchard (1857), Reid and Seymour, and then in
1866-68 by Charles Beasley, who removed here from the White Hart,
then Hopkins, (1869-73), and Miss Bushell (1873-74), when it was
burnt down in the big fire (see Chapter I.).</p>
<p>24. 25. Lower down <i>George Street</i>, near where the
watercourse crosses the street, and now O'Brien's Produce Store,
was an hotel, kept in the forties by C. Eather, and later by
Alfred Dalton, J. Daley, and Hull. There may have been two sites
about here, but they were very old, and their names are not
known.</p>
<p>26. Further along <i>George Street</i>, about opposite to
<i>Catherine Street</i>, where Ward's store now stands, was a
public-house, kept in the forties by P. Burns, or Byrnes, and by
J. Gough, who was at another time in charge of the Rising Sun.
Others who kept the house were: Thomas Freeman, H. McCourt and Ed
Watt, who also kept the St. Patrick, in 1857.</p>
<p>27. The last on this side of <i>George Street</i> is at the
corner of <i>Brabyn Street</i>.&mdash;The old Benevolent
Society's Home demolished in 1915. It was built in 1835-36, and
used as a home for the old folks up till 1846. Additions were
made to it in 1841; but in those days there was no balcony. After
1846 it was used as a private school for a time. It was licensed
as the Railway Hotel in 1866, then the Farmers' Hotel in 1878, or
earlier, and there were many changes of landlords, among whom
were: Norris, Carroll, Loonan, Hopkins, Martin, and Ingate. The
license was transferred to the McQuade Park Hotel, whose license
had been previously forfeited, in 1884 (see also Chapter
XIX.).</p>
<p>28. We now return to <i>George Street, on the north side</i>,
opposite to Thompson Square, where we find the Royal Hotel,
formerly the residence of the Fitzgerald family, and it will be
found elsewhere described. It was also the military officers'
mess rooms for some years. It was opened as an hotel by the
Bushell family in 1872, and kept by them till 1900. Mr. a. T.
Bushell died here on 12th April, 1892, aged sixty-nine, after
which Mrs. Bushell kept it; Bloome (1901), and McDonald (1902)
were later. The cottage next door is part of the premises, and is
very old, built probably about 1820. It was given a new roof in
1893 (see also Chapter II, Fitzgerald family).</p>
<p>29. In <i>Baker Street</i> (off George Street), stood the
Royal Oak, kept away back in the thirties by Wm. Baker. The 1867
good waters entered it. The place was afterwards occupied by
Panton and Betts, storekeepers; F. Beddek, and R. Coley,
solicitors. It was demolished some years ago, but the interesting
old foundation may Still be seen on the west side of Baker
Street.</p>
<p>30. <i>George Street</i>, corner of <i>Kable Street</i>, where
the Commercial Bank now stands, was the site of Ridge's Horse and
Jockey. The coaches for Sydney used to start from here. It was
also kept by Gaddersly, as early as 1842, George Seymour and John
Booth. As Ridge built the Fitzroy Hotel in the sixties, or
earlier, we believe this hotel was closed at that time.</p>
<p>31. The Fitzroy stands nearly opposite the Bank of New South
Wales. It is the oldest continuous license in Windsor. Amongst
the occupants in its earlier days we find Holmes, 1886-1881; J.
Gough, 1882-1894; Wheatley, 1895-6; Rivett, 1896; Figg, 1897;
Smith, 1898-1901; and Eagles, 1902-4. Governor Fitzroy, after
whom the place is named, was in office, 1846-1855. One report
says the Parramatta coaches ran from here in 1847. The meetings
in connection with the building of the School of Arts were held
here in 1860.</p>
<p>32. The White Swan stood two doors nearer to <i>Fitzgerald
Street</i>, in the same building now occupied by Mr. A.
Berckelman. This is an old hotel site. It may have been the Green
Dragon of 1821, kept by T. Dargin. George Freeman kept the hotel
in 1837-45, and John Smith later, but it does not appear in the
fifties.</p>
<p>33. In <i>Fitzgerald Street</i>, at the corner of Union Lane,
now Miss Dick's fine property, stood an hotel, kept by Robert
Smith in 1837, and later by G. Freeman. We are not sure of the
name&mdash;Barley Corn, perhaps, or Barley Mow.</p>
<p>34. On the opposite side of <i>Fitzgerald Street</i>, next the
water tower, is the site of a very old public-house, known by
different names. Cross Keys, kept by Daniel Dickens, in the early
thirties, whose two daughters were burnt to death when drawing
off rum in the cellar. It was known also as the Australian, kept
by H. Beasley, the boat builder, in 1837, and Help me Through the
World. The names Smith, Oilman, and Primrose appear from
1837-1852, but the reference may be to other sites in Fitzgerald
Street.</p>
<p>35. At the corner of <i>Johnston Street</i> is the Royal
Exchange, built by George Freeman, probably when he left the
White Swan. We have not the date, perhaps in the sixties, or
earlier. It was kept by Freeman, Hudson, Windred, Wood, and
Nutter. The license evidently lapsed, or had been transferred,
for we learn that when the Barraba, nearly opposite, was burned
down in 1874, that Miss Bushell transferred her license to this
building, which was kept by her for over thirty years, since when
it has frequently changed hands.</p>
<p>36. The two-story building, with the old coachway under part
of the upper story, and now occupied by R.T. Clerke, was for long
a public-house. It may have been J. Delander's St. Patrick, in
1837, or B. Watt, 1857. It is beet remembered by old hands as P.
Doyle's Rose Inn, 1870-77. The name must have been well painted,
for it is still very distinctly visible on the side after the
lapse of thirty years.</p>
<p>37. Another hotel stood further down, before the watercourse
is reached; but we have no name to give it, nor are we sure of
its occupants, for it has been mixed up with its neighbour, the
Rose. McCourt, J. Dorset, or T. Freeman may have been located
here, also the name White Horse.</p>
<p>38. Further along <i>George Street</i>, opposite the Salvation
Army Barracks, was an hotel kept by Frank McDonald, 1864-70. Mrs.
McDonald died 14th August, 1874, aged seventy-sis. The house may
have been known as the Erin-go-bragh in 1866. McDonald was a
great politician in his time.</p>
<p>38. Next door, near the corner of <i>Catherine Street</i>, was
an hotel known as the Australian, kept by J. Primrose. The sign
is still legible. Also by J. Fewings as the Butcher's Arms, and
later the Oddfellows' Arms, 1876-78.</p>
<p>40. At the corner of <i>Church Street</i> and <i>Catherine
Street</i>, on the south side, in the two-storey building still
standing, T. Primrose kept the Bell Inn, 1867-1870. It may also
have been known as the Blue Bell at one time.</p>
<p>41. In <i>George Street</i>, opposite the Presbyterian Church,
in a large three-storey building, was the Royal Hotel. The sign
is just barely readable on the high gable, and also a few letters
in front. Sir Henry Parkes was entertained here on 7th September,
1869, when he laid the foundation stone of the Public School. It
was kept by C. Blanchard, Mrs. Edward, and Mrs. Hopkins. The
latter afterwards moved to the railway end of the town, while the
name Royal Hotel went to the opposite end.</p>
<p>42. Commercial Hotel, known for a time as the McQuade Park
Hotel, is at the corner of <i>George</i> and <i>Tebbutt
Streets</i>, opposite the Park. It was built by Michael McQuade
in the forties. At first it was but one storey, the second storey
being added at a later time. It was kept in 1843 by T.N. Fisher,
then by members of the McQuade family. But the name best known is
that of Harris, who was in charge for about fifteen years,
1867-1881. In the earlier days of its history more than one of
the Governors were entertained here and held receptions. In later
years it has seen many changes; Meads, 1882-86; Wheelright,
1887-89; Buckley, 1890-92; Cross, 1895-99; Cobcroft, 1901-2.
Other names: Burns, Atkinson and Nash have been seen over the
door. The license was cancelled in 1892, and much money was spent
in law appeals to get it back without effect, till an arrangement
was made to transfer the license from the Farmers' Family Hotel,
near the railway.</p>
<p>43. Railway Hotel, corner of <i>Brabyn Street</i>. The railway
was opened to Windsor in 1864, and soon after this hotel, which
is one of the last built in Windsor, was opened. It was built by
Mrs. Hopkins, who died 26th November, 1882, aged seventy-two.
Other occupants have been Edwards, 1867-74; Norris, 1879; Gillas,
1882; Solomon, 1886; A.J. Viney, 1892-1901, and Cornwell.</p>
<p>44. Another hotel stood opposite the Park on the Richmond
Road, near <i>Cox Street</i>. It was, we believe, built by James
Upton in the forties, and afterwards was kept by Jas. Cullan, who
is said to have kept the Sportman's Arms in 1843, and that may
have been the name of this hotel.</p>
<p>45. A Michael O'Brien is said to have kept an hotel on the
green at the back of Fairfield, near the railway yards, but of
this we have no data.</p>
<p>46. The last site we have to mention is on the <i>Cornwallis
Road</i>, near the bridge. Here Thomas Norris kept a public-house
in 1845, a brewery being at work close by about the same
time.</p>
<p>We still have, a few names not located, as William IV., T.
Greaves, about 1830-37; Rose Inn, kept by John Tindall, in 1835;
Prince of Wales, Mrs. Onus, 1857.</p>
<p>With regard to the district outside Windsor, we might mention
that in 1878 there were three hotels at Magrath's Hill: The
Australian, Killarney, and Royal Oak, but only one is now
licensed.</p>
<p>At Pitt Town for many years was to be found the Maid of
Australia, closed in 1898.</p>
<p>At Riverstone, two, Never fail and Riverstone. One was closed
in 1914.</p>
<p>At Clarendon, two, Chester and Farmers. Both now closed.</p>
<p>At Wilberforce, The Old Retreat.</p>
<p>This makes nine licenses which were all in existence thirty
years ago, where to-day only three remain.</p>

<h3>HOSPITALS AND BENEVOLENT SOCIETY.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Military Hospital.</strong></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first reference to hospital accommodation
in Windsor takes us back to the purchase of an old brewery, about
1812, from the executors of Andrew Thompson, on the bank of the
South Creek, where it was subject to inundation on the periodical
rise of that creek. This building cannot now be located, but it
was used for a very short time only, when a granary and store on
the present School of Arts site in Bridge Street was turned into
an hospital with provision for fifty beds. There can be little
doubt that this was the origin of the large Military Hospital,
also known as the Colonial Hospital, before 1841, built in
Macquarie Street, by Governor Macquarie in 1820.</p>
<p>On this site there originally stood a barracks for convict
workmen, but this was converted into an hospital at the cost of
six hundred and sixty-eight pounds, fourteen shillings about or
before the year 1823. The following extract is from a report made
to Sir Thomas Brisbane in 1842, concerning improvements made to
public buildings the previous year:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>BARRACK CONVERTED INTO
HOSPITAL.</small></p>
<p>"This barrack was formerly occupied by convict workmen, and
occasionally used as a Roman Catholic Chapel. The material and
workmanship of the building are altogether bad. The wall
enclosing the premises is in a very dilapidated state, as also
the lavatory sinks, which are exposed outside the walls, and for
want of proper sewers are very offensive.</p>
<p>"The foundations of this building, being laid with soft brick
and inferior loam mortar, was mouldering away with the wet; but
it has undergone a repair during the year 1823, and from better
materials being used and proper drains made round the buildings,
with a cesspit to abstract the damp, as recommended, it has
acquired a more permanent basis, and may endure some time."</p>
<p>The Military Hospital closed down in 1841, after the
withdrawal of the military forces from the district. It was,
however, taken over by the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, and
re-opened for local hospital purposes in 1846.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society.</strong></p>
<p>A full history of the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society will be
found as an appendix to their report for 1856, compiled by the
late Hon. Wm. Walker, M.L.C. From this we learn that the Society
was formed at a meeting held on 31st December, 1818, and
adjourned to 11th January, 1819, for the purpose of devising
means of relieving the poor and indigent of the district. A
previous society had been formed, known as the "Windsor
Charitable Institution", of which Mr. Robert Fits was secretary,
but it was absorbed by the new effort, and the name changed after
a few years to "The Hawkesbury Benevolent Society."</p>
<p>Those present at the original meetings were&mdash;Rev. R.
Cartwright, J.P., Wm. Cox, J.P., Dr. J. Mileham, J.P., hon.
treas; Lieut. A. Bell, Capt. J. Brabyn, J.P., Thos. Pitt, John
Jones, Hy. Baldwin, and Geo. Hall.</p>
<p>It was agreed to endow the society by forming a herd of
cattle.</p>
<p>The same plan was adopted, though not so successfully, by "The
Portland Head Society for the Promoting of Christian Knowledge
and the Education of Youth." The Society collected a Sock of
sheep about the year 1809, but was obliged to sell them off after
a few years' trial, in 1815.</p>
<p>The Hawkesbury Benevolent Society's herd was successfully
started, and the following grants of land were obtained from
Governor Macquarie: ten acres at Wilberforce, five hundred acres
at Currency Creek, and thirteen acres on Penrith road, near
Windsor, for pasturage.</p>
<p>One of the early reports of the institution will be found in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 8th July, 1820, from which We give
the following synopsis of business transacted:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The half-yearly meeting of the Windsor Charitable Institution
was held at the Court House on 3rd July, 1820. Present:&mdash;Wm.
Cox, Esq., Rev. John Cross, and others, including Robt. Fitz,
treasurer, and John Howe, the storekeeper. It was reported that
eighteen persona had been relieved with such stores as wheat,
maize, sugar, rice, and salt, and also with cash, fifty-three
pounds, fourteen shillings and threepence. Also, that the
institution owned sixty head of cows, and ten calves. A
close-logged shingled roof dwelling had been erected for the
stock-keeper, and twelve acres of land fenced in with the
necessary yards and garden."</p>
<p>In 1833-4 this old stock-keeper's house on the Penrith road
was used for a poor-house before the old asylum was built in
Brabyn Street.</p>
<p>The cattle numbered in 1822 some one hundred and forty-four
head, and were driven to the Hunter River district by Thos.
Dargin, and were under his care until 1827, when John Gaggin took
charge and settled with them on Philips' Creek, Liverpool Plains,
where they remained, numbering over six hundred head in 1835, in
which year the Australian Agricultural Company successfully
claimed and got the site. Ed. Nowland, who had taken charge two
years previously, was then instructed to seek for fresh pastures.
He took up one thousand acres, and an extensive leasehold known
as "Mooki", in the same district, and here the cattle grew and
multiplied for many years. The herd numbered in the early sixties
up to seven thousand head, and the sales brought in frequently
over five hundred pounds a year profit to the society.</p>
<p>The society had not been long settled in their new location at
Mooki before a neighbouring pastoralist claimed the site as part
of his estate, and law cases, arbitration, and litigation went on
for years and years, repeated verdicts being given against the
society. At last, in the year 1863, the whole herd was sold, and
both freehold and leasehold were leased, and the money invested.
The total law costs paid during the year 1863 amounted to no less
than four thousand eight hundred and thirteen pounds, being made
up of the costs of Reynolds, who won the suit and mulcted the
society in his costs amounting to one thousand three hundred and
twenty-one pounds; the society's own costs, one thousand eight
hundred and six pounds; Arbitration costs, one thousand six
hundred and thirty-five pounds; and sundries, fifty pounds. This
being a total loss to the society.</p>
<p>In 1866 the Mooki leasehold expired, and in order to conserve
water frontage, the society purchased three hundred and
sixty-nine acres for three hundred and seventy pounds, and then
leased the whole freehold of one thousand three hundred and
sixty-nine acres for four hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>
<p>In 1898 it was agreed to ask for an Act of Parliament giving
permission to sell the Society's land, and Mr. B. Hall, M.L.A.,
managed to get this passed in 1903, and in the year 1907 the
whole of the Mooki property was sold for five thousand three
hundred pounds, and also the Currency Creek, one thousand acres,
for one thousand pounds.</p>
<p>A study of the Society's investments in Government Debentures
and Bank Stock is very interesting. In 1864 the amount was one
thousand five hundred pounds; in 1864, four thousand pounds; in
1886, five thousand pounds; and in 1805, five thousand seven
hundred and seventy pounds. This money was obtained chiefly
through the sale of cattle, as the leased property at Mooki was
being taken away. Finally all the cattle were sold and the
freehold land leased.</p>
<p>In 1907, when the properties at Mooki and Currency Creek were
sold, the invested funds rose to twelve thousand four hundred and
eighteen pounds. The building of the new hospital, in 1911,
reduced this to seven thousand five hundred pounds. The report
for 1913 showed that the investments amounted to eight thousand
two hundred pounds. Seven hundred pounds of this was withdrawn in
1914 as part payment of the new Home in Brabyn Street, which cost
about one thousand pounds in all.</p>
<p>Quite a number of Acts of Parliament have been passed dealing
with the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society. An attempt was made in
1829 to incorporate the Society, rules being drawn up by Mr. F.
Beddek, but it was not till the 21st July, 1840, that an Act was
passed incorporating the Society, thus giving them power to hold
property, and of suing and of being sued. This Act was amended in
1860.</p>
<p>Another Act, passed on 19th October, 1903, changed the name to
"The Hawkesbury Benevolent Society and Hospital", and also gave
power to sell and to convey land.</p>
<p>In the year 1840 Richard Fitzgerald died, leaving an annuity
of fifty pounds a year to the Society, which was paid each year
by his son, Robert Fitzgerald, up till his death in 1865, when
the management of the property passed to R.M. Fitzgerald, who
died in 1909. He continued to pay the fifty pounds a year until
October, 1875, when there was a special Act of Parliament passed
permitting him to hand over to the trustees of the Society,
Government bonds for one thousand two hundred pounds to continue
the benefaction, a proviso being inserted that if the Society
dissolved or ceased to exist the money revert to the Fitzgerald
estate. This Fitzgerald legacy, together with the Government's
subsidy thereon&mdash;not paid, however, since 1905&mdash;has
benefited the hospital to the extent of over five thousand pounds
during the past seventy-four years.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Old Asylum, Brabyn Street</strong></p>
<p>We will now endeavour to trace the history of the old Asylum
near the railway station. In the year 1826 a meeting was held in
the Court House, convened by W.M. Johnson, to consider a letter
from Governor Darling referring to the erection of a poor-house
in Windsor, but not much was done beyond housing a few old folk
in a wooden cottage on the Penrith road grant till 1833, when it
was resolved to erect a substantial brick building in Windsor for
the reception of the aged and destitute of the district.
Subscriptions were invited, and in April, 1834, the tender of Mr.
Gleed was accepted to build an asylum of brick, thirty-four feet
by thirty-one feet, two stories high, to cost two hundred and
seven pounds. An application for a site was made to the
Government, and one acre in Brabyn Street, between George and
Macquarie Streets, was granted on 24th May, 1834, but not
conveyed until 1861. This building was finished in 1836, and an
overseer appointed at thirty pounds a year; also a medical
attendant, probably Dr. Richardson.</p>
<p>An addition next to George Street was added in 1841, at a
cost, with furnishing, of about two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>In the year 1845 the committee of the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society decided to enlarge their sphere of usefulness so as to
include hospital accommodation, as the Colonial Government
Hospital had been closed in 1841. They applied for and got the
use of the building in Macquarie Street, and moved the aged
inmates thither, and at the same time opened hospital wards.</p>
<p>The old building in Brabyn Street proved rather an incubus to
the committee, the sums spent on repairs and improvements being
out of all proportion to the rents received. In 1898 a new iron
roof cost two hundred and fifty-two pounds, and in 1892 repairs
and moving wall cost two hundred and nine pounds, and again in
1900 repairs one hundred pounds. The place was let as an hotel,
known as the Railway Hotel, in 1866 (see Chapter
XVIII.&mdash;Hotels, No. 27).</p>
<p>The aged inmates again took possession, after a lapse of
fifty-four years, in the year 1910, while the hospital in
Macquarie Street was being re-built.</p>
<p>The committee in 1913 decided to erect a new building for the
old folk, in Brabyn Street, as the 1835 building was too old and
out of date. Plans were called for, and revised by a small
committee, and the new building has now been completed and the
old building demolished.</p>
<p>The new building, which cost eight hundred and fifty pounds,
was opened by the Hon. F. Flowers on 14th December, 1914, and was
designated "The Home for the Infirm."</p>
<p>Some of the inmates have lived to a great age. On 9th May,
1875, one Michael Norton, of Ireland, died, aged one hundred and
twelve. Another Hawkesbury resident, but not a resident of the
asylum, Ed. Riley, died, aged one hundred and seven, on 5th
September, 1891, at Webb's Creek.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Macquarie Street Building.</strong></p>
<p>The old hospital building in Macquarie Street cost the
committee considerable sums for repairs and renovations. We find
in the year 1857 the sum of two hundred and twenty-one pounds
spent on the building. Part of this, however, was, it appears,
expended on the old Asylum. In 1859 an old brick wall was taken
down and a palisading around the ground substituted, at a cost of
one hundred and thirteen pounds. In 1863 a new slate roof was put
on, and balconies added, at a cost of four hundred and ninety-one
pounds.</p>
<p>In 1890 further additions and improvements were carried out,
including a women's cottage, bathrooms, sheds, and sanitary
improvements, at a cost of over four hundred pounds. The years
1886-7 called for an expenditure of over five hundred pounds for
new floors and staircase, and additional rooms for the
superintendent, and other improvements, and remodelling the front
of the building.</p>
<p>In 1890 further additions, improvements and painting
necessitated the expenditure of two hundred and fifty pounds. In
1898 a new fence and other improvements cost ninety-two
pounds.-.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Hawkesbury Benevolent Society and
Hospital.</strong></p>
<p>The Act of 1903 changed the name of the society as above. It
also gave them ample funds for further developments by the sale
of their surplus property. The disposal of a large portion of
which we have already referred to.</p>
<p>In the year 1903 a resolution was passed to build a new
surgical ward, and special sums were set apart and donations
received for this purpose, but the committee decided a few years
later, in 1907, to build, not a surgical ward, but an entirely
new hospital at a cost of three thousand pounds. This sum was
afterwards considerably increased. Much discussion followed, and
much ink was expended over proposed sites. No less than five
sites were proposed, two being in Newtown, one at Brickfield,
another next the condensed milk factory, and still another in
Crowley's paddock, near the tennis courts. None of these,
however, was taken, and a resolution was passed in 1909 to build
the new hospital on the site of the old hospital in Macquarie
Street. Designs were called for and that of Mr. G.M. Pitt, which
utilised the main walls of the old building, was selected, and
the tender of Mr. W. Noller, of Parramatta, accepted for four
thousand five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The building was completed, and opened by Lord Chelmsford, on
April 6th, 1911, the total cost being five thousand eight hundred
and ninety-nine pounds, fire shillings and sixpence.</p>
<p>This sum was made up of the surgical ward fond, one thousand
five hundred and fifty pounds, the chief subscribers being Miss
M.L. Dick, Major Philip Charley, and Mr. Hy. Fowler. The balance
came from the sale of the Mooki property, or other invested funds
of the society.</p>
<p>In re-building the old premises, the Macquarie tablet was
removed from the front, where it may be seen in the illustration
given. It was then placed at the south-west end, on the ground
level, and now reads thus:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image6" id="Image6"></a><img alt=""
src="1302241h-images/Image6.jpg"></p>
<p>The property at present (1915) held by the Hospital Trustees
consists of the old Asylum site of one acre in Brabyn Street,
appropriated in 1834. Also, a grant of twelve acres, three roods,
thirty-three perches fronting Penrith Road and Ham Street, which
was granted to the trustees on 16th October, 1861, in redemption,
of a promise made by Governor Macquarie in or about the year
1818. This site was originally used for grazing the society's
cattle. It was then let at a small rental until the year 1884,
and was known as the Poor Ground. In that year the late Mr. B.
Keenan got a thirty years' lease of the land at ten pounds a
year, the lease somehow being dated February, 1885, instead of
1884. On this he erected a Urge Grammar School, which fell into
the possession of the Hospital Trustees in February, 1915.</p>
<p>The property in Macquarie Street consists of three roods and
eight perches, and was dedicated on 2nd October, 1866, although
the society entered into possession in 1845.</p>
<p>A proposal was made in 1908 to secure the adjoining properties
belonging to Mrs. Brancker, and that known as Gosper's saleyards.
As this is necessary for drainage and garden purposes this
proposal should not be lost sight of. It should be of interest to
the present inhabitants of Windsor who have inherited these fine
hospital properties with their splendid endowments, to know to
whom they are indebted for their inception and maintenance in
past years. The following list gives the names of such, as far as
they can be traced, but it will be noticed that the dates
available are only from 1841.</p>
<p>The trustees, although holding honourable and responsible
office, are not called on for much actual service, and cannot,
therefore, be said to have done work as such for the society
equal to that of other officers. Five trustees are appointed for
life, as a rule, and the latter date here mentioned is the date
of death, unless otherwise stated. The names in order of
appointment are: Wm. Cox, 1841-49; Robert Fitzgerald, M.L.C.,
1841-65; Wm. Bowman, M.L.C., 1841-74; Thos. Tebbutt, 1841-57; Mr.

of a hospital ship. She was succeeded by Matron Melvin, from
Quirindi.</p>
<p>It is a matter of great difficulty, although of deep interest,
to make a selection from the foregoing of, say, the fifteen or
twenty who have rendered the greatest and the most long-continued
service to the society and hospital in past years. Unfortunately,
the earliest reports date only from 1841 to 1868.</p>
<p>Then there is a blank of nine years till 1877, from which time
up to the present the complete annual reports are available. The
following list is therefore, in parts, only approximate, and some
worthy names may have been omitted.</p>
<p>In the following list the names are given with the earliest
date of service, except, perhaps, in the case of the auditors.
The length of service is given, together with the offices filled,
and where possible the year of death and age.</p>
<p>These names might be termed the Roll of Honour:&mdash;</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XX.</p>
<h3>HAWKESBURY RIVER.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> history of Windsor is closely bound up with
the River Hawkesbury. Governor Philip and his party sailed up
this noble stream in 1789 as far as the Green Hills (Windsor),
and Lieut.-Governor Grose placed the first settlers along its
banks in 1794.</p>
<p>The history of its various floods and bridges is dealt with in
Chapters XXI. and XXIII.</p>
<p>Ship and boat building was extensively carried out along the
banks of the river at Green Hills, Richmond, Pitt Town, and
Portland Head in the very early years of settlement, Captain
Grono, Messrs. Beasley, Griffiths, and Andrew Thompson being
rival builders.</p>
<p>The cutter <i>Nancy</i> was the first boat launched in
September, 1803, but she was wrecked in 1805. An eighty ton
schooner, the <i>Elizabeth and Mary</i>, was built in 1810. The
<i>Governor Bligh</i> was built in 1807 by Andrew Thompson, and
sailed to New Zealand, where her captain rescued ten persons from
an adjacent island. The <i>Governor Burke</i>, of three hundred
and sixty tons, was launched in the thirties, and was built by
Beasley.</p>
<p>The above are some examples of the larger boats built on the
river in the early days.</p>
<p>In these early times vessels large and small traded from the
rich Hawkesbury flats, not only to Sydney, but around the eastern
coast of Australia, and as far as Tasmania. See <i>Historical
Records</i>, vol. V., pp. 311, 741.</p>
<p>As early as 1822 Governor Macquarie reported that a wooden
wharf was built at Windsor, at which vessels of one hundred tons
could berth. This wharf was on the same site as the present small
wharf near the Windsor bridge. Another wharf, known as Beasley's,
was a little higher up, near the Municipal water pump, at the
foot of Fitzgerald Street. These wharves were great centres of
activity and sources of wealth to the town for very many
years.</p>
<p>In 1814 a ferry, known as Howe's ferry, was established at the
site of the present bridge, and in 1828 a cattle and passenger
punt was provided at Pitt Town.</p>
<p>In 1828 the first irrigation pump in the colony was placed on
the river, near Pitt Town, by Lawrence May. It was capable of
lifting twenty tons of water per hour. (See <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>, 1st September, 1828.)</p>
<p>The river has also been a source of pleasure and recreation to
the district. In the years 1845-46 regattas were held, and again
in the early seventies this sport was revived, and as many as one
thousand two hundred people assembled on the banks of the river
on 26th December, 1871, to witness aquatic contests. Among the
competitors were Kemp, Ward, Alderson, White, Wilkins, Johnson,
Welsh, Plunket, Norths, Mills, Arnold, Jones, Ford, Grono,
Brookes, Batti, Tout, and others. Another successful regatta was
held in 1872, with twenty-five pounds of prise money.</p>
<p>Another useful recreation club formed on the river in 1895 was
a swimming club. The president was Mr. B. Keenan, and the hon.
secretaries Messrs. Fred Collison and R.B. Walker. There were
eighty members when it first started. In 1896, on 16th January,
the mile swimming championship of Australasia was decided under
the Windsor club's auspices on the Hawkesbury, when competitors
from New Zealand, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales
competed. There were sixteen entries for the five guinea trophy
mile championship, but only five started. It was won by Percy
Cavill, N.S.W., in twenty-eight minutes two seconds, being the
record for a straight mile in fresh water. Then came L. Leo,
N.S.W., W.J. Stratton, N.Z., H. Hoey, N.Z., and E. Prior, N.S.W,
A special train was run from Sydney to Windsor, and three local
steamers, St. <i>Alban, Lottie</i>, and <i>Colonel</i>, were in
attendance. The river was alive with boats; one thousand five
hundred spectators were present, while the banks were gay with
bunting and decorations. There were numerous entries for other
events, including high-diving.</p>
<p>For an account of this great demonstration, see the <i>Windsor
and Richmond Gazette</i>, 18th January, 1896.</p>
<p>Amongst other useful purposes the river serves is irrigation,
numerous pumps being at work in the summer months on each side of
both the Hawkesbury and the South Creek.</p>
<p>A water brigade was formed in 1872, to be in readiness in case
of flood, and to become proficient in the management of the flood
boats. The members were Messrs. J. A. Dick, Wm. Moses, R.D.W.
Walker, W. Gosper, W.F. Linsley, W. Alderson, and E.J. Tout.</p>
<p>In 1888-89 the river was again called on to serve the town,
when the present pumping plant and water supply was started, a
description of which will be found under Chapter XXXIII., dealing
with Municipal affairs.</p>
<p>From thirty to fifty years ago there was a large shipping
trade done on the river, numerous boats, and later small steamers
also, brought all kinds of farm, dairy and orchard produce from
the Macdonald and Colo rivers, Webb's Creek, Wiseman's Ferry,
Sackville, Cattai, Portland Head, and Lower Portland up to the
Windsor wharf, where it was disposed of and sent by rail to
Sydney or to inland towns. The boats took back stores and such
supplies as were needed along the river farms and orchards. A
writer in 1857 describes the Hawkesbury as "Windsor's sister and
helpmaid".</p>
<p>This river trade was valued in 1876 as worth seventeen
thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>An estimate was made of the river traffic, which appeared in
the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i> of 13th and 20th April,
1889, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>From 1870 to 1882 an average of three hundred and seventy
trips a year; from 1883 to 1885 an average of two hundred and
sixty trips a year; and from 1886 to 1887 an average of one
hundred and thirty-five trips a year, and in 1888 an average of
forty trips a year.</p>
<p>This decline in trade was owing to the gradual silting up of
the river.</p>
<p>In the year 1882 a dredge, the <i>Archimedes</i>, was at work
near Windsor, but with very little success, each fresh in the
river filling the newly-cut channel.</p>
<p>A large sum of money, five thousand pounds, was voted in 1889,
and surveys were made for deepening either the Hawkesbury or the
South Creek, but the cost would have been: For the river
scheme&mdash;twenty-six thousand pounds, and for South Creek
scheme&mdash;nineteen thousand two hundred pounds, much more than
the sum voted, and the surveyors could hold out no hope of the
suggested improvements surviving the first big flood in the
river.</p>
<p>In 1888 the river was almost closed to navigation, but a flood
in 1890 opened the channel again so that the large flat bottom
tourist steamer <i>General Gordon</i>, one hundred and
thirty-five feet long, one hundred and three tons burden, and
drawing two feet of water, got up to the Windsor wharf for the
first time for three and a half years. The <i>General Gordon</i>
came up again in 1893, and as late as 1897, carrying
tourists.</p>
<p>The largest steamer that has come to Windsor was the s.s.
<i>Victoria</i>, which brought from three hundred to four hundred
volunteers from Sydney to a review in October, 1861, when Sir
John Young was present.</p>
<p>In 1873 the s.s. <i>Pelican</i> ran an excursion to Sydney,
leaving Windsor at 11.30 a.m., and reaching Sydney at 10 p.m. The
fares were twenty shillings, and fifteen shillings.</p>
<p>In October, 1891, tho St. Albans landed two hundred and fifty
bags, and in 1897 the <i>Surprise</i> landed two hundred hags of
maize at the Windsor wharf.</p>
<p>But, alas, the palmy days of the river trade have gone from
Windsor, never more, we fear, to return.</p>
<p>The following tidal measurements and distances made when the
surveyors were at work on the river are interesting. They
appeared in the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, 20th
September, 1891: From Windsor Bridge (tide three feet three
inches) to Pitt Town wharf (four feet) four and a quarter miles;
from Windsor bridge to Great Cattai Creek (four feet one inch)
seven and a half miles; from bridge to Little Cattai Creek (four
feet eight inches) ten and a quarter miles; from Windsor bridge
to Sackville wharf (four feet eight inches) nineteen miles. The
greatest depth of water found was off Mud Island, near the Church
of England, at Sackville. one hundred feet.</p>
<p>The following is an alphabetical list of the boats and
steamers trading on the river from 1872 to 1882, the steamers
being later. It is not possible to give the owners with their
boats, for the names of the boats were sometimes changed, as was
also the ownership:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Adventure, Australia, Agenora, Alma</i> (s.s.), <i>Acme</i>
(s.s.), <i>Bluebird, Blackbird, Better Times, Cecilia,
Colonel</i> (s.s.) <i>Dug Out, Emma Matilda, Emily Jane, Emily
Edith, Elisabeth, Empress of India, Fanny, Fly, Fly-by-night,

<h3>BRIDGES.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>South Creek.</strong></p>
<p>I<small>N</small> order to reach Windsor the Sooth Creek must
be crossed, and this led up to the question of a bridge at a very
early date. Andrew Thompson, that enterprising pioneer, obtained
permission to collect tolls for fourteen years, and on this
condition he constructed the first bridge, which was a floating
one, in the year 1802. The position of this bridge was in a line
with Catherine Street, at the back of the court house. (See
Governor Macquarie's plan of Windsor, dated 1812.) The following
order referring to this bridge was issued by Governor
King:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">"Government and General Orders, 25th May,
1802.</p>
<p>"Whereas Andrew Thompson (Settler and Constable) has been at a
great expense in constructing a floating bridge over the South
Creek at the Hawkesbury, leading from the Parramatta Road to the
Green Hills, which is of great convenience to the settlers and
inhabitants in this colony; and as the subscriptions for carrying
on that work have been very inconsiderable in comparison to the
expense, he has requested that a permanent toll may be
established by authority, for persons, &amp;c, passing that
bridge, as may compensate him for the expense he has been at, and
to enable him to keep it in repair. In consequence of that just
claim, the following toll is established for the term of fourteen
years from this date, provided he keeps the said bridge in
constant repair (accidents by flood or fire excepted) viz.: for
each foot passenger fourpence, or ten shillings per annum; for
each horse, two shillings and sixpence, or two pounds ten
shillings per annum; for every cart or carriage, one shilling and
sixpence, or one pound ten shillings per annum.</p>
<p>"Government having subscribed fifteen pounds and two men for
three months towards erecting the said bridge, constables and
Government men, going or returning from public labours, who have
a pass signed by the magistrate at Parramatta, Toon-Gabbie, or
Sydney, or from the Magistrate at Hawkesbury, as well as every
officer and soldier actually in the execution of public duty, are
to be free of any toll, but if any person whatever endeavours to
impose by passing under these pretexts, they will, on conviction,
forfeit five pounds to the proprietor of the said bridge.</p>
<p>"The Governor having given to Andrew Thompson the exclusive
privilege of keeping and maintaining the bridge, and the receipt
of the tolls arising therefrom, for the space of fourteen years,
from this, date, any person keeping a passage boat, or using any
other mode of carrying or conveying passengers, horses, or carts
across the South Creek, will, on conviction before two
magistrates, forfeit the sum of five pounds for each offence to
the proprietor of the bridge.</p>
<p align="right">"PHILIP GIDLEY KING."</p>
<p>This bridge of boats was replaced with a log bridge two
hundred and fourteen feet long, which took seven months to build.
This second bridge was built by the trustees of Andrew Thompson's
estate. John Howe had the oversight of the work, and when it was
opened by Governor Macquarie, on 10th November, 1813, the name of
"Howe's Bridge" was given to it. This bridge, we believe, was at
the same place as the former floating bridge, and it was
twenty-four feet over the water level, and had four rows of
piles. It was the largest bridge in the colony at the time, and
is the bridge referred to in the first part of the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Surveyor-General's Office,         <br>
<br>
Sydney, 18th January, 1827.</i>   </p>
<p><i>Sir,&mdash;In answer to your letter of the 13th inst.,
requesting to know if the bridge over the South Creek at Windsor
was built by a private individual, and if so directing me to
report under what conditions it was built.</i></p>
<p><i>The first bridge over South Creek was erected by Mr. A.
Thompson, who was allowed a Toll regulated by the Magistrates;
when this was destroyed in 1814 a new and enlarged bridge was
erected by Mr. Thompson's executors with, I believe, some
trifling assistance from Government. A lease of the tolls of this
bridge was granted by Governor Macquarie for seven years, on the
expiration of which the bridge fell under the control of
Government, and the tolls which were permitted to be received by
the executors of Mr. Thompson are now received by Government. I
am not acquainted with any other bridge built by an individual
who has been authorised to receive toll in payment of his
expenses.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>I have, etc.,                  <br>
J. OXLEY,         <br>
Surveyor-General.</i></p>
<p><i>The Hon. Alexander McLeay,<br>
     Colonial Secretary.</i></p>
<p>This 1814-15 bridge was said to have been destroyed by an
earthquake in the year 1823, but this is probably a myth. The
bridge built in 1823 was probably the first one built on the
present site.</p>
<p>In a report as to the value of improvements made in public
buildings of New South Wales, and compiled for Governor Brisbane
by S.L. Harris, architect, and dated 24th December, 1823,
reference is made to a bridge then re-building at Windsor, and
complaint is made that piles were being placed in mid-stream that
would endanger the bridge in flood time. This bridge was still
known as Howe's Bridge in 1830. A Quaker named James Backhouse,
who visited Windsor in 1838, mentions that a bridge was then
being re-built at the South Creek. It was eventually replaced by
the one known as the Fitzroy Bridge, opened about 1848 by
Governor Fitzroy. It was constructed on the wooden arch
principle. The sum of five hundred pounds was spent in repairs to
this bridge in 1860, and it stood till replaced by the present
iron bridge built in 1879-80. A temporary wooden bridge was
erected while the iron bridge was being built. Tolls were
collected here up till 1887. The old toll house still stands near
the bridge, and is probably amongst the oldest buildings in
Windsor. The bridge was improved in 1895 by having a new concrete
floor put down. The tolls collected on the South Creek bridge,
and also for the Hawkesbury River ferry, will be found in the old
Australian almanacs, so that we need not repeat them here.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Windsor Bridge.</strong></p>
<p>The Hawkesbury River at Windsor was crossed as early as the
year 1814 by Howe's ferry, and the ferry or punt was used for
many years. The idea of a bridge was first put forward by the
Hon. William Walker, on the occasion of the opening of the
railway in 1864. It was warmly discussed in Parliament during the
next few years, the trouble being whether it would be a high
level or a low level bridge. In 1872 a start was made, the bridge
taking two and a half years to build. In 1874 preparations was
made for the opening, and the sum of ninety-eight pounds and
eightpence was collected for the demonstration. There was a large
committee appointed: Messrs. W. Dean and S.T. Greenwell being
hon. secretaries, and Mr. R. Coley, hon treasurer. There was a
great procession through the town, and in the evening a bullock
roast in Thompson Square. A full account of the proceedings
appears in the <i>Australian</i> of 7th August, 1875. The bridge
was four hundred and eighty feet long, and cost ten thousand two
hundred and eighty pounds, and was fourteen and a half feet above
the tidal level. When opened it was named the Windsor Bridge.
This bridge was covered by every strong fresh that came down the
river, and an agitation was started for raising it fifteen to
eighteen feet, but this was found impracticable. At last it was
decided to spend four thousand pounds in raising the bridge
another eight feet by placing eight feet cylinders on top of the
existing ones. The work wag started in 1896, the traffic meantime
being carried on a temporary low wooden bridge. The work, which
occupied some eight or nine months, was completed early in 1897.
An account of the improvements made will be found in the
<i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i> of 3rd April, 1807. Mr. James
McCall superintended the work. The raised bridge is twenty feet
longer than the original, and hundreds of loads of soil were
carted from the lowland near Mileham and Brabyn Streets to fill
in the river bank to the higher level.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Richmond Bridge.</strong></p>
<p>In 1857 steps were first taken to build a bridge to connect
Richmond with the Kurrajong Hills. A private company was formed,
known as "The Richmond Bridge Company". The directors in 1872
were: James Ascough (chairman), William Walker, G.M. Pitt, W.
Bowman, and Andrew Town. A wooden bridge was completed in 1860,
at a cost of ten thousand pounds. Tolls were collected until the
bridge was taken over by the Government in 1876. This bridge
consisted of nineteen spans. It was a low-level bridge five
hundred and thirty-seven feet long. It was repaired at
considerable cost in 1890. The piles of this old bridge are still
seen beside the present concrete bridge. The fine Monier concrete
bridge which now serves the Kurrajong side, was erected in 1905-6
at a cost of eighteen thousand six hundred pounds, and will carry
a light tramway if necessary. It is fourteen and a half feet
above the ordinary river level.</p>

<p>of smaller dimensions are found in the district. One over the
Chain of Ponds was built as early as 1821. Another bridge is that
over Rickaby Creek to the Cornwallis flats. In the year 1860 this
bridge was washed away and the local Member (William Walker,
M.L.A.) got a grant of three hundred pounds for a new bridge,
which was built by Thomas Collison, and opened in October,
1860.</p>
<p>The large Hawkesbury railway bridge at Brooklyn was opened on
1st May, 1889.</p>

<h3>JOHN TEBBUTT, F.R.A.S.</h3>
<p>O<small>F</small> all the names, both past and present,
connected with Windsor, none is so widely known outside New South
Wales as that of John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., whose private
observatory is to be found on the Peninsula in our midst.</p>
<p>Mr. Tebbutt was born in Windsor on 25th May, 1834, and
received his education at the schools of Mr. Edward Quaife, and
the Rev. Mathew Adam and Rev. H.T. Stiles, all of Windsor,
together with his private study after leaving school. His
biography will be found in the Astronomical Memoirs published by
him in 1908, and particulars of his work will also be found in
several astronomical publications in various parts of the world,
for his work is known in every observatory throughout the five
continents.</p>
<p>We cannot here attempt to give even an outline of his many
years' work, but a few notes will be of interest to his fellow
townsmen.</p>
<p>Mr. Tebbutt began to take an interest in astronomy when only
nineteen years of age. His first telescope was a small marine
glass, which is still preserved in his observatory, and which did
duty from 1853 to 1861. In 1861 he obtained a three and a quarter
inch refracting telescope, with which he observed a large number
of lunar occultations of stars during the period 1864 to 1870.
These observations were employed by Dr. Hugo Clemens, of
Gottingen, in an investigation of the longitude of Windsor, and
although they were made with so inferior an instrument, they were
spoken of in the highest terms. The observatory time from 1864 to
1879 depended on the use of a telescope of only two inches
aperture. In 1872 he acquired a four and a half inch equatorial
telescope. Previously to the year 1863 observations were taken in
the open air, but in that year Mr. Tebbutt erected his first
observatory, which was a very modest building constructed of pine
and roofed with slates. In 1879 a substantial observatory of
brick was erected, close to the building just referred to. In
this structure an excellent transit instrument of three inches
aperture was installed for the determination of accurate local
time. In 1886 was added a fine equatorial refractor of eight
inches aperture and one hundred and fifteen inches focal length,
the work of Grubb, of Dublin. The observatory contains an
excellent astronomical library, chiefly formed by contributions
from all well-known observatories and kindred institutions of the
world. With the two equatorial instruments a vast number of
observations have been made, extending from 1872 to 1912, and the
results have been regularly published in the Monthly Notices of
the Royal Astronomical Society, and in the <i>Astronomische
Nachrichten</i>. The work achieved may be summarised as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Meridian observations for local time.</p>
<p>Observations of occultations of stars by the moon.</p>
<p>Micrometer observations of minor planets.</p>
<p>Micrometer observations of comets.</p>
<p>Observations of eclipses, transits and occupations of
Jupiter's satellites.</p>
<p>Observations of solar and lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>Measures of double stars, especially those which have proved
to be binary.</p>
<p>Observations of the remarkable variable stars, Eta Argus and
R. Carin&aelig;.</p>
<p>Lastly, observations of a miscellaneous character.</p>
<p>The accuracy and usefulness of all these systematic
observations are attested by numerous monographs in the
observatory library. It may be mentioned that it is "to this
observatory we are indebted for the discovery of two of the
grandest comets of the nineteenth century, namely, those of 1861
and 1881, both of which were objects of great interest when at
their maximum splendour. No fewer than seven returns of Encke's
celebrated comet were observed at Windsor. This comet should be
of special interest to Australian astronomers, for its first
predicted return was verified by Sir T. Brisbane's observatory at
Parramatta in 1822. So far back as 1862 Mr. Tebbutt was offered
the post of Government Astronomer, but he preferred to work
privately for the science. His observatory has been placed on the
list of working observatories in the national ephemerides of
Great Britain, France, Germany, and the United States. In 1861 he
was elected a member of the Philosophical Society, now the Royal
Society of New South Wales, and he is at present the oldest
member but one of that Society. In 1873 he became a Fellow of the
Royal Astronomical Society of London, and in 1895 was chosen as
first President of the New South Wales Branch of the British
Astronomical Association. In 1867 he received a commemorative
silver medal from the New South Wales Commissioners of the Paris
Exhibition, and in 1905 the Royal Astronomical Society presented
him with the Jackson-Gwilt medal for services to astronomy
extending over nearly half a century. In addition to his
astronomical work, Mr. Tebbutt is the author of meteorological
work extending over half a century, and to him we are indebted
for a complete catalogue of floods and freshes in the Hawkesbury
River from 1855 to the present time.</p>
<p>It will be seen from this notice that Mr. Tebbutt is now in
his eighty-second year. Attention to private affairs is now
sufficient for him, and he feels unable to do much for his
favourite science.</p>
<p>His fellow townsmen, many of whom have followed with much
interest&mdash;although at times "afar off"&mdash;his deep
scientific labours, wish that he may spend the evening of his
life with faculties unimpaired, and so be enabled to still
follow, even though, perhaps, with a little less ardour than
formerly, his loved science.</p>
<p>The writer desires to thank Mr. Tebbutt for his kindness in
revising the MSS. of this article and that on "Weather and
Floods", and also for reading the proofs. In addition, he would
like here also to thank Mr. Tebbutt for much help in compiling
this series of articles on the "Early Days of Windsor", including
the use of his library and replies to many queries.</p>

<h3>WEATHER AND FLOODS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> danger from floods is always a source of
anxiety to the occupants of the low-lying lands along the banks
of the Hawkesbury; the river may rise and overflow its banks at
any time during the whole year. Nevertheless, it appears from Mr.
Tebbutt's records that a flood is an event of rare occurrence
during the months of January and December. The few which have
been recorded were very small. Farmers and dairymen do not take
such risks as formerly with regard to their homesteads, barns,
and haystacks, having grown wiser by the bitter experiences of
the former generation, and now build on the high ground. Still,
from time to time extra large floods do come down, doing terrible
damage, not only to the growing crops, but to live stock and
produce as well.</p>
<p>We give herewith a list of the biggest floods, that is, such
as rose thirty-five feet or more. This would be at least fifteen
feet over the present Windsor bridge, and would encroach a
considerable way up Bridge, Baker, Kable, and Fitzgerald streets
on the north side, whilst a forty-eight feet rise would bring the
water right across George Street near New Street. Such rises
occurred in the years 1864 and 1867. The highest flood recorded
was that in 1867, June 23, which rose sixty-three feet. All
Windsor was covered excepting two spots; an island about two
hundred feet wide, and extending from Johnston Street, near the
<i>Gazette</i> office, up to the School of Arts and a little
beyond. Another island started near New Street, extending along
the Terrace past St. Matthew's Church, taking in Tebbutt Street
and part of McQuade Park, and from the railway station about a
mile back along the Penrith Road.</p>
<p>Richmond was half under water. An island was formed about the
old Clarendon House to near the Roman Catholic Church. Another
island started from about the Black Horse Hotel, and extended
back through part of "Hobartville" to Yarramundi. Pitt Town was
also an island two hundred chains long and the same wide. The
whole of the road to Pitt Town and Cattai was under water, except
a small portion in Pitt Town. The Parramatta road was under water
out to Vineyard. Most of the Riverstone Meat Company's paddocks
were also flooded, and all the low laud away towards
Blacktown.</p>
<p>The flood measurements in the accompanying list, from 1855 to
date, are taken from the meteorological observations of Mr. J.
Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., made at his private observatory on the
Peninsula, near Windsor, and may, therefore, be accepted as
correct. Those given before that date are, we fear, not so
accurate, and at times are much exaggerated.</p>
<p>The rainfall and the temperature records are also from Mr.
Tebbutt's observatory, dating from the year 1863:&mdash;</p>

degrees on January 4th, 1909, and the lowest temperature on the
grass, 17.6 degrees, on July 8th, 1896.</p>
<p>A terrific hailstorm passed over Windsor in July, 1844, doing
much damage. Over one thousand panes of glass were broken. A
similar hailstorm took place on 18th January, 1893, when the
damage done at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was estimated
at eight hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Snow was seen on the Kurrajong Hills on 20th August, 1872,
28th June, 1875, and in October, 1895.</p>
<p>Severe earthquake shocks were felt in Windsor in the years
1804, 1823, and 1842. That of 1823 is reported as having
destroyed Howe's bridge over South Creek, but this is doubtless a
gross exaggeration.</p>

<h3>DOCTORS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first medical practitioner in the
Hawkesbury district was probably Dr. Thos. Arndell, who came here
in 1804, and though he did not seek to build up a practice, he
remained in the district. His death took place on 9th May,
1821.</p>
<p>Dr. James Mileham came to the colony in 1797, and was
Government surgeon at Windsor from 1811 to 1823. He died in
Sydney, 28th September, 1824.</p>
<p>Further reference to Dr. Arndell and Dr. Mileham will be found
in Chapter II.</p>
<p>Dr. William Balmain received a grant of two hundred and
seventy acres at Magrath's Hill, known as "The Sister's Farm", It
does not appear that he practised his profession in the
Hawkesbury district. This grant is dated 12th November, 1799.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Mason was at the Hawkesbury for a few years about
1807.</p>
<p>Dr. Major West, 1822-26; Dr. T.B. Allan, 1826-27; Dr. Benjamin
Clayton, 1835, were here for short periods.</p>
<p>The next local medico was Dr. William Richardson, M.D., of
Edinburgh, who arrived by the same ship (<i>Castle Forbes</i>)
that conveyed Governor Darling to these shores. He was appointed
surgeon-assistant on the medical staff of New South Wales on 3rd
of March, 1826. He settled first at Bathurst, coming to Windsor
in 1831, remaining till 1837, when he went to Goulburn, and
afterwards to Port Macquarie in 1841. He was appointed a member
of the Medical board of New South Wales on 15th May, 1846. He
received an appointment at the Sydney Infirmary in 1845, Hobart
Town, 1848. After a few years he retired on a pension, returning
to Scotland, where he died in September, 1863. When in Windsor he
occupied the site now known as "Sunny Brae", between Fitzgerald
and Kable Streets, which he sold to the late Thomas Cadell.</p>
<p>Dr. Alex. Gamack, 1838-39; Dr. Harry Graham, 1839-40.</p>
<p>Dr. William Farquharson Stewart, 1840-48. He lived in
Fitzgerald Street, and also in premises now occupied by the Bank
of New South Wales, and was the Benevolent Society's medical
officer for eight years. He died at the early age of thirty-five,
on 2nd January, 1848. His son, W.D. Stewart, who was born in
Windsor, died in Richmond in 1902, where some of his descendants
still reside. Mrs. Helsham, wife of Dr. Helsham, being his
grand-daughter.</p>
<p>Dr. White, 1842-43 (is probably the Dr. Blanc of an ancient
local romance).</p>
<p>Dr. William Bell, 1846-49, lived in Burke's Buildings,
Thompson Square, and afterwards practised at Carcoar,
Campbelltown, and Picton, 1859-71, where one of his daughters
married into the Antill family.</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Dowe was for over twenty-years the resident doctor,
1841-67. During this time he married Miss Sarah Loder, of a
well-known local family. It was he who built the large balcony
residence in Bridge Street, near the School of Arts. He
afterwards removed to Tamworth, where he died 22nd September,
1875, aged sixty-three. His son, R.A. Dowe, solicitor, of
Tamworth, who was born in Windsor in 1848, died 8th January
1915.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry Day practised first at Wilberforce, and then at
Windsor, from 1857-71. He was the hospital doctor for some eleven
years, and lived in the Terrace, near the Windsor bridge. In the
year 1882 Dr. Day was the quarantine medical officer in
Sydney.</p>
<p>Dr. H.A. Huffington practised in Windsor and Richmond from
1861-65.</p>
<p>Dr. William Shaw, 1863-64.</p>
<p>Dr. B. Fyfe, 1864; Dr. E. Pring, 1867; and Dr. J.B. Wetherill,
1871-73.</p>
<p>We now come to one whose name will long be remembered in the
Hawkesbury district, Dr. John Selkirk, of the Royal College of
Surgeons, London. He was admitted as a practitioner by the New
South Wales Medical Board,, in 1839. His first regular practice
was at Wiseman's, Lower Hawkesbury, from where he removed to
Richmond about the year 1850, and to Windsor in 1874, where he
died 15th September, 1877, aged sixty-four, and was buried in St.
Peter's Cemetery, Richmond. He was greatly mourned by a large
circle of friends in the district, where for thirty-six years he
practised his healing art. Dr. Selkirk took a keen interest in
the welfare of the district. He was a good churchman, a keen
politician, and an ardent volunteer, being one of the first to
enlist.</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Fiaschi began practise in 1876, remaining until
1886, when his superior surgical skill demanded his residence in
Sydney; but he has ever since taken a deep interest in the
district, and has considerable vigneron interests in the
Sackville district (see Chapter XXVI.).</p>
<p>Dr. D. McPhee, 1874-82.</p>
<p>Dr. G.V. Marano, 1877-79, Dr. W.Q. Dalgairns, a Spanish
medico, came in 1878, and died 30th August, 1879. Dr. H.P. Gordon
died 11th June, 1882, aged thirty-eight; Dr. W.F. Jackson,
1882-83; Dr. B.J. Newmarch, 1883-5; Dr. C.H. Hozier, 1885-9, was
afterwards in Kiama, and then went to Germany.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Callaghan, L.R.C.P., Edinburgh, came to Richmond in
1877. In September, 1882, he sold out his Richmond practice and
bought a practice in Sydney. A strong effort was made to retain
his services for the district at the time. However, he was
committed to the Sydney arrangement, but the following year he
returned, and has been practising in Windsor from November, 1883,
to the present time, 1915. He is one of the senior Magistrates of
the district, and has taken keen interest in all that concerns
the welfare of the district. He has been for thirty years on the
committee of the Hawkesbury Race Club, and for many years
president of the local School of Arts.</p>
<p>Dr. John Gibson, M.D., Edinburgh, purchased Dr. Hozier's
practice in February, 1889, and continued the same up till the
time of his death, which took place in the Eastern Archipelago,
near Java, 5th May, 1910. He had gone there on a voyage to
recruit his health. Dr. Gibson was largely instrumental in having
the fine new hospital erected in 1910.</p>
<p>Dr. A.Y. Fullerton succeeded Dr. Gibson in 1910, and left
Windsor to join the New South Wales military forces in August.
1914, and is now in Gallipoli. He was succeeded by Dr. Davis.</p>

<h3>LAWYERS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first mention we find of a local lawyer is
in Bonwick's History, where he mentions that the first Methodist
meeting held in Windsor was conducted by an emancipist lawyer in
the year 1812 (see Chapter IX.). Another lawyer, George Crossley,
had a farm of three hundred and fifteen acres at Richmond Hill as
early as 1806. His name appears frequently in connection with the
arrest of Governor Bligh, he being the Governor's legal adviser.
Crossley appears from the <i>Historical Records</i> to have been
highly respected in the Hawkesbury district. He died in 1823, and
was buried in the old Devonshire Street cemetery, Sydney, the
remains being removed to La Perouse cemetery in 1901. The
inscription on the headstone reads:</p>
<p align="center"><small>Here lyeth the body of</small><br>
<br>
ANNA MARIA CROSSLEY,<br>
<br>
<small>The much lamented wife of George Crossley,<br>
Who departed this life the 24th September, 1817.<br>
Aged 52 years.</small><br>
<br>
Also GEORGE CROSSLEY, Gent.,<br>
<br>
<small>Who departed this life March 19th, 1823.<br>
Aged 75 years.</small></p>
<p>In the forties there were several legal gentlemen in Windsor
of whom we have very little information. Mr. Thos. Darling,
1842-46; Mr. Johnson, 1848-9&mdash;an Irish gentleman, and Mr.
David Lawson, a brilliant young Scotchman, who died 27th May,
1849, at the early age of twenty-seven, and is buried in St.
Matthew's cemetery. Mr. Stephen N, Lamb-ton from Parramatta, who
arrived in New South Wales in 1838, practised in Windsor 1848-51,
where he died at the age of forty-two, in the year 1851. He was
the father of Mr. S.H. Lambton, of the General Post Office, who
studied in Windsor at the Academy of Rev. M. Adam.</p>
<p>We have now to mention one who, as both a lawyer and citizen
of Windsor, took up the work of the pioneers and played an
important part in developing the town and district, Mr. Francis
Beddek.</p>
<p>Mr. Beddek was an English attorney, admitted to the New South
Wales bar on 1st February, 1828. He began practise in Windsor
about the year 1828, and continued to make it his home and
interest for the next twenty-four years. He was married in St.
Matthew's by the Rev. E. Smith, on 11th December, 1828, to Miss
Elizabeth Blatchford, sister of Mrs. Cox, of Clarendon, and they
resided at Claremont Cottage, near St. Matthew's. Mr. Beddek was
also a director of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, as
early as the year 1843. He was the hon. treasurer of the
Hawkesbury Benevolent Society for six years, and a life member of
the same. He acted as hon. secretary for Robt. Fitzgerald in the
exciting election of 1843. He also took an interest in the
formation of the first Agricultural Society in 1845, and was
always ready to assist in anything that tended to advance the
interest of the district. He died at the age of fifty-two, on
12th November, 1852. Mrs. Beddek's death, at the age of
sixty-three, took place on 21st May, 1863. The Beddek vault is
worthy of a visit, and will be found in St. Matthew's churchyard,
near those of such other worthy pioneers as Tebbutt, Brabyn,
Arndell, and W. Cox, in the south-east corner.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Coley was admitted to the New South Wales bar on
17th February, 1844, and began practise in Windsor in the year
1848, where he continued to reside for over forty years. Mr.
Coley took into partnership in the early seventies, Mr. C. Bed
veil, but the connection was dissolved on 14th July, 1873. Mr.
Coley married Miss M. Bell, of Belmont. He took great interest in
the local Fire Brigade; he was also interested in the Hawkesbury
Benevolent Society, holding for some eight or nine years both the
office of hon. treasurer and hon. secretary.</p>
<p>Mr. Coley was an active member of the Masonic Lodge, as is
indicated by the present name, "102 Richard Coley Lodge". He also
held office as a trustee and warden in St. Matthew's Church, and
in his will, which was valued for probate at nine thousand seven
hundred and two pounds, he left four hundred pounds to St.
Matthew's Church. He died at the age of eighty-four, on 15th
October, 1889. His grave will be seen not far from-the front door
of St. Matthew's (see also Chapter XXXIV.).</p>
<p>Mr. William Walker was articled to Mr. F. Beddek in 1841, and
admitted to practise in New South Wales on 30th October, 1852,
continuing in his profession and residence in Windsor for some
fifty-six years.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker came from Scotland at the age of nine X years, with
his father, Mr. Geo. Walker, who was brought. out under the
direction of Dr. Lang as a teacher, arriving in Windsor on 3rd
December, 1837. The family lived first in Macquarie Street, near
Suffolk Street, then in the Peninsula, and finally in the
red-tiled cottage in New Street, in the year 1857, opposite the
Church of England Hall, where his father died at the age of
eighty-seven, on 22nd September, 1883 (see Chapter XIII.).</p>
<p>Mr. William Walker, in addition to his practice, found time
for everything that tended to help the town and its institutions.
He was one of the founders of the School of Arts, and its first
president in 1861, holding that office for some seventeen years.
He threw himself into all the work of the Benevolent Society,
being for fourteen years its hon. secretary, from 1854-67, and
president from 1801 to 1908, and trustee for forty-nine
years.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker took an active interest in the local Presbyterian
Church, holding the office of Elder and representative to the
General Assembly for very many years. There is a tablet to his
memory in the local church. He was interested in Municipal
affairs, being elected to the first Council in 1871, and he was
Mayor of the town in the year 1878. Mr. Walker was also keenly
interested in politics, and represented Windsor in the Lower
House from 1860 to 1864, being instrumental in advancing the
interests of the town in many directions. He was appointed to the
Upper House in 1887, holding a seat in the Legislative Council
for twenty-one years.</p>
<p>The Hon. Wm. Walker died at the age of eighty, on 12th June,
1908, and is buried in the local Presbyterian cemetery, leaving a
large family of sons and daughters, several of whom hold
influential and important positions in various parts of the
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>We now come down to more modern days, and in closing give the
names of Mr. Alex. Brodie Neilson, who was articled to R. Coley,
and practised for twenty years from 1873 up to the time of his
death at the age of fifty-four years, on 30th December, 1892.</p>
<p>Mr. Geo. McCauley, articled to Mr. Morgan, M.L.A., admitted to
practise 24th August, 1895, and carrying on his profession until
1912. He was seventeen years in Windsor, and died on June 25th,
1912, at the age of forty years.</p>
<p>Mr. J.J. Paine, who came from Parramatta to Windsor in
November, 1889, taking up the practice of Mr. R. Coley.</p>
<p>Mr. R.B. Walker, who was articled to his father, the Hon. Wm.
Walker, and with whom he was afterwards associated, and succeeded
in 1908.</p>
<p>Mr. Ed. Campbell, of Richmond, might also be mentioned; he
began practise there in the year 1892.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRIES.</h3>
<p>O<small>NE</small> of the earliest industries of this district
was the building of schooners and small boats. This was carried
on along the river bank.</p>
<p>From the earliest times, the rich flats and good grazing land
in the district have given an impetus to dairying, and the
growing of maize, pumpkins and melons. In more recent years the
science of irrigation has led to the cultivation of suet other
vegetables as cabbages, cauliflowers, and beans, as well as
tomatoes.</p>
<p>In some parts the vine has been tried and abandoned. In the
eighties Dr. Fiaschi planted the famous Tizzana vineyard, near
Ebenezer. A description of this industry appeared in the
<i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i> for the 7th March, 1891.</p>
<p>For a long time horse-breeding and training have been a
lucrative business in the district, the Hobartville and Belmont
stud being amongst others well-known throughout Australasia. (See
<i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, 28th February, 1891.)
Hobartville sold seven hundred and forty-seven horses, valued at
ninety-five thousand pounds, during the seventies and eighties.
The local sales ceased in 1891.</p>
<p>Apiaries were much in evidence some twenty years ago, when
such paymasters of the cult as the Rev. J. Ayling, Messrs. G.F.
Daley, W.C. Barker, and J.D.G. Cadden attended their well-kept
hives.</p>
<p>An attempt to introduce the growing and manufacture of sugar
was made in 1872-3, but without success.</p>
<p>From a very early date the Hawkesbury was the centre of New
South Wales wheat-growing and milling industries, but the local
growers were compelled to pass the wheat-growing out to the west
and south-west, on account of the rust in the crops about the
year 1873. At Wilberforce, Buttsworth's mill, built in 1848, and
in other parts old ruined milk may still be seen. Buttsworth's
old mill was demolished in 1915. One of the earliest windmills,
the tower of which is still standing, was on the river bank,
opposite the Ebenezer Church. Another was started at Pitt Town in
1835, by Lawrence May. This was a horse-power floor mill. In
Windsor proper there were three flour mills. One in Kable Street,
near the river, run first by Cadell and Co., and in 1857 by
Farron Bros. As early as 1830 another mill, known as the
Endeavour Mill, stood in George Street, near Dight Street,
opposite the park. It was alternately known as Teale's, Dawson's
and later as Liddel's, and then Hoskisson's. For a long time the
tall chimney was a prominent landmark. After standing for about
sixty-five years it was pulled down in June, 1896. Another flour
mill stood opposite the Presbyterian Church. It was known at
different times as Holland's, Hopkins', and Moses', and was
pulled down in October, 1893. It will be noticed that in the
years 1857-66 three steam flour mills were running in Windsor at
the same time, viz.: Hopkins', Dawson's, and Farron Bros'.</p>
<p>The brewing industry was established by Andrew Thompson on the
11th May, 1806. Hie license stated that he was to sell at one
shilling per gallon, and sixpence for small beer. In the year
1835 there were three breweries: One was O'Dell's, in Macquarie
Street, near Fitzgerald Street. Cadell's original brewery and
malt-house was on the Cornwallis Read, near the Riccaby Creek, a
public-house being also near by. The largest brewery was built
about 1845, at the corner of Kable Street and the river bank, and
was known as Cadell's Hawkesbury Brewery. Governor Young, in
visiting it in 1861, stated that he questioned if there was
another as large and ably conducted in the colony. These large
three-storied buildings were well-constructed of brick, with
slate roofs. The main portion was pulled down a few years ago.
The malt-house is still standing.</p>
<p>The tanning industry was at one time very extensively carried
on in Windsor. We find in the 1835 Directory that there were two
local tanners:&mdash;Samuel Marsden, Macquarie Street, opposite
the Oddfellows' Hall, and Joseph Windred, in George Street. Mr.
Marsden also kept a drapery shop on the opposite side of the
street to his tannery. His family were very musical. Mr. Anthony
Hordern married one of his daughters.</p>
<p>We glean from a special article in the <i>Windsor and Richmond
Gazette</i>, 6th October, 1888, that there were then no less than
six local tanneries, containing over two hundred pits, with a
total weekly capacity of over five hundred hides. These tanneries
were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&mdash;R.W. Cobcroft, Argyle Street, Newtown.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;Julian's, near railway, Newtown, and afterwards known
as Marr's. McGrath, and Perkins also worked it at other
times.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;Buttsworth and Evans, Brabyn Street.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;W.P. Linsley, Macquarie Street, formerly Marsden's
tannery; also Cavanough's, and afterwards known as Moore and
Maisey's yard.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;J.S. Busby, Peninsula, at present Anschau's, and the
only one that has survived. This tannery was started by Mr. Busby
in 1867, and was enlarged in 1881, and again in 1895. In 1898 it
was able to turn out up to two hundred and fifty hides a
week.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;W.H. Hull's, in George Street, near Kable Street, and
once owned by R. McNiven, who was Mayor of Windsor in 1882. He
died in Balmain on 7th March, 1891, at the age of forty-five.
This was Joseph Windred's tannery in 1835.</p>
<p>Another, Mottram's, James Street, Newtown, was built later
than the others. The large iron sheds may still be seen.</p>
<p>For some years (1883-93) a wool-scouring wash was located on
the South Creek, but frequent floods drove the proprietors
(Magrath Bros.) to Emu Plains, in October, 1893. Several families
left Windsor with the industry, which at one time paid locally as
much as fifty pounds a week in wages.</p>
<p>The meat industry, in the shape of beef-salting, was tried by
Mr. Robert Fitzgerald, in the forties. About the year 1880 the
late Benjamin Richards established the Riverstone Meatworks,
which have continued to flourish. In 1889 Mr. S. Hoskisson made
an attempt to establish similar works at Clarendon.</p>
<p>A jam factory at Riverstone, in 1893-5, did not return many
dividends to the shareholders.</p>
<p>The manufacture of cordials has been carried on for the past
twenty years or more.</p>
<p>In 1889 the Hawkesbury Dairy Co. was formed, but did not get
properly going until 1892, when the present factory was erected
as a butter factory, the property being then valued as: Land,
three hundred and twenty pounds; buildings, eight hundred and
twenty pounds; and machinery, Ave hundred and ten pounds. Total,
one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds. The water-tower was
erected in August, 1896. The whole business has been remodelled
and reorganised on entirely different lines, the factory now
being for the manufacture of condensed milk and powdered milk.
The opening of the original factory on the 24th of August, 1893,
was a red-letter day in Windsor. Lord Jersey came up by special
train for the purpose, being the first Governor to visit Windsor
for thirty years. The factory was named the "Jersey" factory, and
a banquet followed in the Church of England Hall. All the
children from the surrounding schools were present, and formed a
procession and marched through the town.</p>

<h3>BANKS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first Bank stalled in Windsor was an agency
of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, of which Mr. F.
Beddek, solicitor, was a director. The agency was opened in his
office, then in Macquarie Street, in the year 1941. The agency
was continued afterwards in George Street, between Kable and
Baker Streets, north side, until 1844, with Mr. T.O.S. Green as
cashier, when it closed up, Mr. Green being afterwards teller in
the head office in 1851.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Dick acted as agent for this bank till it re-opened
in 1874.</p>
<p>In the year 1858 two banks started in Windsor. The Barrack
Street Savings Bank of New South Wales was opened, with the late
Hon. Wm. Walker, M.L.C., as accountant, who held the office for
forty-four years, when, in 1903, his son, Mr. R, B. Walker, took
it over, and held office until the amalgamation with the
Government Savings Bank in 1914.</p>
<p>The same year, 1858, saw also a branch of the Bank of New
South Wales established under the management of Mr. Nicolas
Nugent, who held office for eighteen years, until his death in
1875.</p>
<p>Mr. Chas. Hole, a native of Windsor, then took charge, and
continued in office for nineteen years, until his death at the
age of fifty-four, on 13th November, 1894. His father died in
Parramatta a fortnight later, at the age of eighty years. The
family were connected with those of the Revs. C.P. Garnsey and
H.T. Stiles.</p>
<p>Mr. C. Hole was one of the promoters, and for long the
secretary of the local gasworks, which were started in the year
1883 (see Chapter XXXIII.).</p>
<p>The next manager was Mr. C. Chester, who was transferred from
Moruya in December, 1894, and remained twelve years, until
1896.</p>
<p>During his time the bank was re-roofed and fenced, and the
porch added, opening on to the street.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Scott followed in 1906, remaining about six years, when
the management passed over to the present occupant, Mr. It. A.
Nevile, in 1912.</p>
<p>The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney reopened in 1874, in
the building in George Street, known as Laban White's, the first
manager being Mr. W. W, Bodenham, who was transferred to
Parramatta in 1886, and was followed by Mr. Chas. W. Gaden,
1886-88, when Mr. W.H.B. Piddington followed, and remained until
1893. He afterwards entered Parliament. It was in his time, about
the year 1889, that the present premises were erected. Mr. W.P.
Busby, from Taree, followed, remaining until February, 1897, when
Mr. J.G. Beasley took charge, and remained sixteen years, when he
retired from the service, being succeeded the same year, 1913, by
the present manager, Mr. W.H. Haxby, from Moruya.</p>
<p>The last bank to enter the field in Windsor was the old
Australian Joint Stock Bank, which opened in the premises now
occupied by the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, in November,
1888, with Mr. F.H.M. Norton, who resigned from the New South
Wales bank, as manager. This bank, however, did not flourish, and
closed down in Windsor on 30th June, 1896.</p>

<h3>PARLIAMENT.</h3>
<p>O<small>WING</small> to changes in the boundaries of the
electorate and to the single and doable electorates, it is
difficult to follow out the order of representation, but taking
Windsor proper as a centre, although not the name of the
electorate, we find the following have represented Windsor: Wm.
Bowman, 1843-58; W.B. Dalley, 1858-60; Wm. Walker, 1860-69;
Arthur Dight, 1869-72; Richard Driver, 1872-79; Alex. Bowman,
1879-82; H.M.H. McQuade, 1882-85; Alex. Bowman, 1885-92; Sydney
Burdekin, 1892-94; Wm. Morgan, 1894-1902; Brinsley Hall, 1902,
still holds the seat.</p>
<p>The first election was held on 17th June, 1843. The candidates
were William Bowman, of Richmond, who won by a single vote, and
Robert Fitzgerald, of Windsor, The campaign was a long and bitter
one, much local feeling being aroused. When the result of the
election was announced, the supporters of the defeated candidate
broke out into riot, and smashed the windows and property of many
of the Bowman supporters in Windsor.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald committee was: Jas. Hale (chairman), F. Beddek
(hon. secretary), Dr. White, Dr. W.F. Stewart, and Messrs. John
O'Dell, John Shearing, Michael McQuade, J.L. Scarvell, Chas.
Smith, Jas. Cullen, W.G. Burgis, Ed. Coffey, Richard Ridge,
Richard Dunstan, and John McDonald.</p>
<p>The Bowman local committee was: Messrs. Chas. Tompson
(chairman), Thee. Darling, Lee, J.A. Betts, T. Tebbutt, Johnston,
and Cadell. They met in the Bird in the Hand Hotel, in Fitzgerald
Street, between the present Poet Office and the Methodist
Parsonage.</p>
<p>The rival candidates advertised for three or four months in
the Sydney papers before the election. They both gave liberal
subscriptions to the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society, amounting to
nearly forty pounds. Messrs. S. North and O'Dell, being public
officers, were rebuked by a judge for partisanship in the
revision of the rolls, having rejected the names of about twenty
Bowman supporters.</p>
<p>The following Hawkesbury residents have also occupied seats in
our Upper or Lower Houses of Legislature: Lieut. A. Bell, John
Panton, 1843; Jas. A. Cuneen, 1861-69; W.K. Piddington, 1872-76;
Hy. Moses, 1876-1892; Robert Fitzgerald, 1849, M.L.C.; Jas.
Comrie, 1858, M.L.C.; Geo. Bowman, 1856, M.L.C.</p>
<p>Amongst those who have acted as returning officers at the
Parliamentary elections we find: Samuel North, 1843; Laban White,
1850; Jas. Ascough, 1860; Robert Dick, 1872; J.B. Johnston,
senior; J.B. Johnston, junior.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XXIX.</p>
<h3>POST OFFICE.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first record we find of a local Poet Office
is when Mr. Robert Fitz was appointed Postmaster in the year
1828, at a remuneration of thirty-four pounds, seven shillings
and ninepence per annum, at which time there were three mails a
week to and from Sydney.</p>
<p>Mr. Hy. Bailey was next Postmaster, appointed in 1834, and was
followed in office by Mr. Alfred Holden, in 1835-36, and in 1836
by Mr. John O'Dell, who had to handle a daily mail with Sydney.
He remained in office, we believe, for many years, the office
being in Macquarie Street, near Fitzgerald Street. Mr. O'Dell
took a keen interest in politics, and also in the local
hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. Geo. Panton, probably of the old firm of Betts and Panton,
was postmaster in 1852. The Post Office in 1850 was the building,
minus the balcony, where Drs. Callaghan and Davis now live, in
Thompson Square.</p>
<p>The name that will be most intimately connected with the
Windsor Post Office by alt the old residents k that of Mr. Jas.
Adam Dick, who was appointed in 1861, and held the office for
some thirty-nine years, when he was retired on a pension, in the
year 1899. He died, at the age of sixty years, on 3rd January,
1900. During his time the Post Office Department secured the site
of the old look-up, now the Council Chambers, where the Post
Office was carried on for many years, and the electric telegraph
office for a further period, the present building being erected
in 1860. The present post office site was purchased in 1878 for
the sum of six hundred pounds, and the foundation stone was laid
in 1879 by the then local member, Mr. Richard Driver, M.L.A., and
the business transferred there in due time, followed afterwards
by the telegraph office.</p>
<p>Mr. J.A. Dick also took an active interest in the volunteer
movement, for many years holding office as second lieutenant, and
afterwards as captain of the local corps. His mantle and offices
fell some years later on his son-in-law, Lieut.-Col. J.J.
Paine.</p>
<p>Two of the late Mr. Dick's sons are well-known medical
practitioners in New South Wales, and both are at the war front
to-day.</p>
<p>The next Postmasters were: Mr. A.D. Fowler, 1901-1907; Mr.
H.E. Edwards, 1907-8; Mr. T.W.C. Young, 1909-11; Mr. H.J.
Lancaster, 1912-15; G. Ireland, 1915, at present in charge.</p>
<p>The telegraph office was first in charge of Mr. C.N. Ambrose,
1861-70; then Mr. J.A. Dick, 1870-2; after which Mr. C.J. Nealds,
who had held at one time an important position in the railway
department, took charge in 1873-75, followed by Mr. Jesse Cook,
1878-80, when the office passed under control of the Post
Office.</p>
<p>An interesting article on the local Post Office appeared in
the <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i>, 9th February, 1907, from
the pen of Mr. John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S.</p>

<h3>NEWSPAPERS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> earliest local papers came out in the early
days of Responsible Government, when the election fever ran high,
but they were short-lived. The <i>Windsor Express</i> was run by
Geofry A. Eager in 1843, and the <i>Hawkesbury Courier</i> in
1844, in which Messrs, Statham and Forster also assisted.</p>
<p>After a silence of some six years there appeared in 1850-51
the <i>Windsor Telegraph</i>, Messrs. Albermarle Layard and
Benjamin Isaacs being responsible for its production.</p>
<p>A magazine called the <i>Windsor Review</i>, edited by J.
Kennedy, of York Cottage, arose and fell about the year 1857. In
1860 appeared the <i>Windsor Advertiser</i>.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find to-day any files of the above,
only isolated copies, few and far between, being available.</p>
<p>In the early seventies two rival papers appeared, and from
that period onwards, owing in a large measure to the inauguration
of Municipal Government on 31st May, 1871, the town has had
continuous press representation.</p>
<p>In 1870 the <i>Hawkesbury Times</i> began its career of four
years, edited for a local company by J.D. Delaney, who died on
11th April, 1894.</p>
<p>The <i>Australian</i> was launched on its fiery career in
September, 1871, edited by Geo. L.A. Davies. This paper ran for
some twenty-three years, closing down 2nd December, 1893.</p>
<p>The <i>Hawkesbury Chronicle</i> started in 1879, under the
auspices of C.E. Fuller, then Messrs. Spencer Bros., and latterly
by G.C. Johnson. It supplied the town with local information till
1888, when the present <i>Windsor and Richmond Gazette</i> came
out, under the editorship of Mr. J.C.L. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A.,
passing into the bands of the present proprietor, Mr. F.
Campbell, in 1899.</p>
<p>The <i>Hawkesbury Herald</i>, under the conduct of Messrs.
W.H. Pinkstone and F. Collison, began in 1902, appearing at first
in Windsor; but now in Richmond.</p>

<h3>RAILWAY.</h3>
<p>A<small>S</small> early as the year 1846 a system of railways
was discussed, and a rough survey of a line thirty-six and a half
miles long to Windsor was included. The following properties lay
at that time along the proposed route from Blacktown to Richmond:
Messrs. Pye, Bobart, Betts, Marsden, Fitzgerald, Teale, Allen,
and Hale. This report was printed in 1848, and makes an
interesting study.</p>
<p>In 1856 a petition was presented asking for a railway to
Windsor and Richmond, and the same year a select committee was
appointed to consider the matter. In October, 1860, the sum of
fifty-one thousand pounds for a railway, Blacktown to Windsor,
was passed, and in 1861 the sum was increased to sixty thousand
pounds for a horse railway from Blacktown to Richmond.</p>
<p>In 1863 the first sod was turned, and the following year an
additional grant of fifteen thousand pounds was made to make the
line fit for locomotive traffic. The line has a very long viaduct
over the Hood area (as seen in the illustration) on the N.W., and
a high bridge over the South Creek to the S.E. The railway being
the only means of communication in flood time for traffic.</p>
<p>The line was officially opened on 29th of November, 1864, by a
banquet and ball, at which Sir J. Young was present. The fares
were fixed at eight shillings and sixpence, and five shillings
return to Sydney. A further sum of ten thousand pounds was spent
on the line in the year 1865.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note here the dates of the opening of
other lines about that time: Parramatta, 1855; Campbelltown,
1858; Blacktown, 1860; and Penrith, 1862.</p>
<p>The first station-master of whom we have record is Mr. Geo.
Bonamy, 1867-73, who went afterwards to the Ashfield station. He
was living at Stanmore in 1896, being then eighty-two years of
age. He was one of the founders of the local Congregational
Church.</p>
<p>Mr. David Scotland, from Ashfield, was appointed in 1873, and
held office till October, 1889. Both Mr. and Mrs. Scotland were
very popular in the town and district. Mrs. Scotland died in
1888, and he died 5th January, 1890, at the age of
sixty-four.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Critchley was the next station-muster, holding office
from 1891 to 1899. Much sympathy was felt for him on account of
the death by accident, at Nevertire, of Mr. Critchley in August,
1895, at the age of forty-eight.</p>
<p>Mr. W.C. Bradly followed, holding office from 1899 to 1909,
when he was moved to Strathfield, and was followed by Mr. R.
Johnson in 1909, and Mr. J.M. Spence, from Wollongong, followed
in 1912, and is still in charge.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL OF ARTS.</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> local School of Arts owes its origin to a
Literary Society which was started in Windsor in the year 1857.
At one of their meetings the following letter was
received:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right"><i>Department of Lands and Public
Works,       <br>
Sydney, 12th September, 1857.</i></p>
<p><i>Sir,&mdash;Referring to the letter to you from this
department of the 27th ultimo, on the subject of a petition
addressed to His Excellency the Governor-General, from certain of
the inhabitants at Windsor, praying for a grant of a piece of
land in that town as a site whereon to erect a Mechanics' School
of Arts, and pointing out that the portion of land at the head of
Bridge Street, upon which formerly stood the old Military
Hospital and Store, it particularly well adapted for the purpose,
I am directed to apprise you for the information of the
petitioners that the Surveyor-General having reported that there
is no objection to the appropriation of the land in question at
the head of Bridge Street, the Secretary for Land and Public
Works has approved of its appropriation accordingly for the
purpose applied for. I am to add that the Surveyor-General has
been requested to have the land in question measured and brought
forward in abstract for final approval.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>I have the honour to be, etc.,          <br>
<br>
MICHAEL FITZPATRICK.</i></p>
<p><i>William Walker, Esq.,<br>
        Windsor.</i></p>
<p>A petition influentially signed had been presented to Governor
Denison in 1857 for a site for a Mechanics' School of Arts,
indicating as a desirable site a small portion of land "at the
head of Bridge Street upon which lately stood the old Military
Hospital and Stores." Wm. Walker was "secretary to the Windsor
School of Arts Site Committee." The request was approved, 8th
September, 1857. A public meeting to arrange for this petition
was held on 8th July, 1857.</p>
<p>The Trustees nominated were: James Ascough, James A. Cuneen,
John Tebbutt, jun., in 1858, but they were never appointed. On
the 9th September, 1879, James A. Cuneen, John Tebbutt, junr.,
and Wm. Walker were appointed, and a deed was Anally prepared in
their names on 14th January, 1880.</p>
<p>In 1897 J.D. Smith and Geo. McCauley were appointed as
trustees instead of John Tebbutt (resigned), and J.A. Cuneen
(deceased).</p>
<p>The School of Arts site contains twenty perches, and was
dedicated 16th July, 1863, for a Mechanics' Institute. The
adjoining site, marked as twenty-three perches, and being portion
of the Church of England school land, was sold to Mr. G.M. Pitt,
on 3rd November, 1858, for one hundred and fifty-seven pounds.
(See Land Book in Court House.)</p>
<p>The earliest meeting of which we have a record of the Literary
Society, before mentioned, was held on 8th July, 1856, when Thos.
Hall, J.P., of "Dartbrook", presided. Dr. Day, Wm. Walker, and
J.A. Cuneen took part. One speaker remarked that of all the towns
in New South Wales, Windsor stood first in agriculture, fourth in
population, and twelfth in literary institutions.</p>
<p>Other members of this Literary Association whose names appear
as taking part in the debates, are: W.D. Cavanaugh, J. Swan, A.
Neilson, and &mdash; Brabant, also the committee mentioned below.
The society was a real live institution and did much for the
youth of the town. Quite a number of those who names are
mentioned rose to eminence in their various callings in later
years.</p>
<p>The debates and lectures were reported in the <i>Windsor
Review</i> in 1857, edited by J. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Great efforts were made, not only to secure the site, but to
collect funds to erect a building in which to hold their
meetings. At a meeting of subscribers held in the Fitzroy Hotel,
on 24th August, 1860, Mr. Wm. Walker, M.L.A., in the chair, it
was reported by the chairman, who was also hon. treasurer, that
he had two hundred and twenty pounds, twelve shillings and
fourpence in hand, and one hundred and twenty-three pounds
promised. Further, that the Government had promised to give six
hundred pounds when a like Bum had been locally contributed. A
number of canvassers were appointed, and the following committee
was elected: Dr. Day, J. Ascough, Wm. Walker, J. Cunningham, J.A.
Cuneen, E. Stewart, S. Edgerton, G. Ancel, J. Primrose, H. Moses,
J. Cassidy, and J.A. Walker, hon. secretary.</p>
<p>At another meeting, held in October, it was reported that the
six hundred pounds required had been subscribed.</p>
<p>In December, 1860, a plan was accepted for a building to cost
six hundred and seventy-four pounds, the contractors being
Messrs. Cook and Galbait. The new building was opened by the Rev.
Dr. Lang, in 1862.</p>
<p>The first subscribers were: Thomas Hall, one hundred pounds,
J.A. Cuneen, twenty-five pounds, J. Ascough, and W. Walker, ten
pounds each, Dr. Day, B. Ridge, J.B. Laverack, &mdash; Abraham,
H. Moses, B. Stewart, five pounds each.</p>
<p>The officers of the School of Arts have been very frequently
changed, and it is not easy to trace them all. We give, however,
an approximate list with the years of office.</p>

<p>The early records of the institution are missing, and it is
therefore a matter of regret that this chapter is, in
consequence, somewhat incomplete.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>
<h3>MUNICIPAL COUNCIL.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Origin.</strong></p>
<p>T<small>HE</small> first attempt at local government was the
formation of a District Council in the year 1841. It consisted of
seven members, Wm. Cox, "Hobartville", Warden; Josiah A. Betts,
"Wilmington", near Riverstone; Francis Beddek (who, however,
refused to act), Robert Fitzgerald, Thos. Arndell, "Cattai",
Chas. Tompson, "Clydesdale", and Thos. Tebbutt.</p>
<p>This council does not appear to have done much practical work,
and became extinct in the year 1846.</p>
<p>Another attempt was made in 1860 to form a council, but it
failed.</p>
<p>In the meantime fresh legislation was enacted, giving more
powers to such local bodies, so that on 31st May, 1871, the
following were elected as the first Municipal Council, the total
votes received being placed after their names: W.I. Crew, one
hundred and twenty-seven; Wm. Gosper, one hundred and fifteen;
Robt. Dick, one hundred and seven; Richard Ridge, one hundred and
four; Wm. Walker, one hundred and two; Thos. Primrose, one
hundred; John Johnson, ninety-two, Wm. Beard, ninety; J. M,
McQuade, eighty-seven.</p>
<p>At the first meeting on 7th June, Mr. Robert Dick was elected
as the first Mayor of Windsor.</p>
<p>The Municipality was proclaimed on 4th March, 1871, and Mr. S.
Tuckerman, J.P., was the first returning officer. The first
meeting was held in the Court House, the second in the School of
Arts, and afterwards in the Oddfellows' Hall.</p>
<p>The first municipal election in Richmond was on 19th August,
1872. Mr. A.L. Forbes was returning officer, Mr. Geo. Bowman was
the first mayor, and Mr. C.S. Quest, council clerk.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Mayors.</strong></p>
<p>It may prove interesting to give a list of those who have been
elected Mayor of Windsor, some of whom have been called a second
time, or more, to the office:&mdash;</p>
<p>Robert Dick, 1871; J.M. McQuade (two years), 1872, 1874; Wm.
Dean, 1873; John Johnson, 1875; W.I. Crew, 1876; Wm. Gosper (two
years), 1877, 1891; Wm. Walker, M.L.C., 1878; Thos. Primrose
(four years). 1879, 1883, 1886, 1903; Wm. Moses (two years),
1880, 1884; F. Simon, 1881; R. McNevin, 1882; W.F. Linsley, 1885;

1906, 1907, 1914-15; J.J. Paine, (eight years), 1895 to 1902;
A.C. Hannabus (two years), 1908, 1909; J.W. Ward, 1910; J.W.
Chandler (four years), 1911, 1912, 1913, 1915.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Council Clerks.</strong></p>
<p>The office of Council Clerk has been filled as under:&mdash;J.
Thos. Smith (four years), 1871-74; G.R. Cadell (one year),
1874-75; Wm. C. Gambrill (three years), 1875-77; R. Turner (seven
years), 1878-1884; F.W. Linsley (eight years), 1885-1892; A.J.
Berckelman (one year), 1892-1893; M.E. Myers (one year), 1893;
N.K. Pendergast (ten years), 1894-1903; Wm, J. Gibson (two
years), 1903-1905; A.V. Grimwood (seven years), 1905-1911; S.
Morgan (four years), 1911-15; C.H. Wood, 1915.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Aldermen.</strong></p>
<p>Many aldermen have passed through the Council daring the put
fort; years. Some have done very little, and others have done
much for the town. Some have held office for only a year or two,
others have been elected year after year. Amongst those who have
given long and valuable service of over eight or ten years, we
might venture on a list up to the year 1900, but lay no claim to
its being absolutely the best.</p>
<p>Of the original Council elected in 1871, the following held
office longest, and all filled the Mayor's chair: Wm. Gosper, Wm.
Moses, Wm. Walker, Wm. I. Crew, and Thomas Primrose, the latter
being an alderman for over thirty years, and was Mayor three
times. F. Simon, 1877; J.T. Gosper, 1878; J.T. Smith, 1878; F.J.
Mortley, 1887 (who was Mayor six times); D. Holland, 1891; Joe.
W. Ward, 1889; Wm. H. Dean, 1888 (Mayor tax times); and J.J.
Paine, 1893 (he held office of Mayor continuously for eight
years, 1895 to 1902).</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Council Chambers.</strong></p>
<p>A number of properties come under the control of the Council.
First the Council Chambers. The site was appropriated in 1836 for
a watch-house, and contains one rood three perches. In 1860 it
was appropriated for a post and Telegraph Office, and finally it
was dedicated on 28th January, 1891, for a Town Hall.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>The Church Green,</strong></p>
<p>consisting of nineteen acres two roods, was set apart for
public recreation on 6th December, 1867, and again dedicated as
twenty-one acres, one rood, one perch on 19th May, 1868, The park
was for a time known as McQuade Park, called after Mr. J.M.
McQuade, who was Mayor in 1872 and 1874. The name was altered by
resolution of the Council on 6th March, 1878, to Windsor
Park.</p>
<p>At one time the park was in danger of being subdivided. A plan
of Windsor (about 1834) shows Forbes Street continued through to
Moses Street, while a later plan in 1838 shows Cox Street
continued in a straight line to Windsor Terrace, which would cut
off a good part of the present football ground. However, the only
portion sold was one side of Tebbutt Street, and the area from
that street back to the line of Cope's farm, which includes the
site of the Roman Catholic Church. The park was enclosed with a
fence in May, 1872, at a cost of one hundred and seventy-seven
pounds. A cricket pitch and ground is gradually assuming shape,
and has been under construction for many years, as funds permit.
Asphalt paths were laid down, but are somewhat hard to find in
parts to-day. Trees were planted, and more are now required.
Seats and swings are provided. A drinking fountain was erected in
1891, and a South African war memorial in 1903. The Park is about
to be lighted with electricity, and a bandstand was erected in
1915.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>The River Park,</strong></p>
<p>consisting of one acre, three roods, eighteen perches, on the
bank of the Hawkesbury, extending from Fitzgerald Street to the
Peninsula, was dedicated for public recreation on 8th January,
1875, and proclaimed as "River Park " on 11th March, 1887.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Thompson's Square,</strong></p>
<p>consisting of two roods thirty-seven perches, was dedicated on
8th January, 1875, as a Town Hall site. It was resumed on 14th
October, 1899, and notified in two areas after providing for
roads for public recreation.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Other Reserves.</strong></p>
<p>A reserve, No. 15,815, of one rood, at the corner of Mileham
and Forbes Streets, notified 18th June, 1892.</p>
<p>A permanent common of five hundred and twenty acres to the
south of the town, dedicated 16th December, 1892.</p>
<p>A reserve, No. 24,075, for traffic and wharfage, containing
two acres and three perches, at the approach to Windsor Bridge
between Baker and Catherine Streets, Peninsula, including the
site of the wharf, notified 16th May, 1896.</p>
<p>Reserve, No. 36,874, for protection of approach to Fitzroy
Bridge in Bridge Street, including the old toll house, which was
in existence as early as 1827. The reserve contains two roods,
and was notified 12th December, 1903.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>General.</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to give a full account of all the doings of
the Council during the past forty-three years. A few notes,
however, may be interesting to old residents.</p>
<p>In 1875 the Council became possessed of a South American
alpaca, which gave considerable amusement, perplexity and trouble
to both Council and ratepayers. It was killed by order of Richard
Ridge in 1876.</p>
<p>The Council met in the Oddfellows' Hall, Macquarie Street, for
many years before they came into possession of the present
building, which was built in the year 1860 for a telegraph
office, on the site of an old lock-up or watch-house.</p>
<p>In 1872 the rate of pay was five shillings a day, and fault
was found because this was too high.</p>
<p>In 1878 the rates of pay were six shillings, five shillings,
and four shillings a day, according to the ability of the
workmen, the overseer receiving one shilling a day extra.</p>
<p>The Council granted forty pounds in August, 1878, to make a
cricket pitch in the park, and fifty pounds was spent in 1892,
and one hundred and fifty pounds in 1896 for the same
purpose.</p>
<p>In July, 1882, the streets of the town were lit with kerosene,
and the same year an effort was made to establish gasworks in the
town. A prospectus was issued calling for six thousand pounds in
one pound shares. Gasworks were established by a private company
in 1887. The first officers were:&mdash;Directors: H. McQuade, R.
McNevin, 8. T. Greenwell, C. Hole, secretary. W. Beard,
treasurer. Amongst others who have taken part in the management
of the company we note: W. Moses, D. Scotland, R. Dick, S.E.
Dyer, S. Gow, Ben Richards, D. Holland, P. Fraser, and W.F.
Linsley.</p>
<p>In 1901 an Act of Parliament wan passed giving permission to
extend the mains to Richmond, but the work was not carried
out.</p>
<p>Enquiry was made in 1889 about lighting the streets with
electricity. The same year, however, the Windsor streets were lit
with gas. The electric light will come into use in 1916, supplied
by a private company.</p>
<p>An agitation for a water supply began in the year 1882, and in
1888 the first steps were taken towards getting such a supply for
the town. In July, 1889, tenders were called for the work. At
first it was intended to pump from Ben's Point, near Riccaby
Creek, and to have the reservoir in the corner of the park,
opposite the Church of England rectory.</p>
<p>The first sod of the work was turned by the Mayoress, Mrs.
F.J. Mortley, on 31st July, 1889. The engineer in charge of the
work was Mr. J.P. Sharkey. The water-tower is forty-five feet
high, and the reservoir has a capacity of two hundred and fifty
thousand gallons.</p>
<p>The pumps were started, and the water supply turned on to the
town, on the 9th January, 1890, Mr. J. Sowden being placed in
charge of the water supply at that time, and has now been in
charge for a quarter of a century. Electricity was applied to the
pumps in 1916.</p>
<p>The Penrith water supply dates from 1891, and Richmond, 1892,
illustrating the ancient adage, "Windsor leads, others
follow."</p>
<p>In order to carry out the water supply scheme, the Council
obtained a loan of six thousand five hundred pounds at five per
cent, from the A.M.P. Society on 8th December, 1888. This loan
has since been reduced by five hundred pounds. The balance falls
due on 1st February, 1919.</p>
<p>In 1890 the present Council Chambers were secured in exchange
for the balance of the Market Reserve, which was then added to
the Public School grounds.</p>
<p>We might mention here that this market site was reserved as
earl; as 1835, and included the present Dight Street, which was
cut out of it about the year 1889. A portion of one acre was
taken for the present Public School on March 12th, 1669, and
another slice of thirty-nine perches on 5th January, 1872, and
finally the Education Department secured the remainder, one acre
one rood, for a playground on 28th January, 1891.</p>
<p>The Windsor Municipality in 1914-15 contained two thousand
seven hundred and thirty-three assessments. There were one
thousand four hundred and eight electors on the Municipal Boll,
while the number of ratepayers was one thousand three hundred and
forty-seven.</p>

<p align="center">CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>
<h3>SOCIETIES.</h3>
<p align="center"><strong>Freemasons.</strong></p>
<p>F<small>REEMASONRY</small> flourished in the Hawkesbury
district nearly a hundred years ago, when a number of officers
attached to the Imperial Forces stationed here formed a Lodge.
The only official record, however, available is that a Lodge,
known as the Windsor Social Lodge, was founded in the year 1841
under the Irish Constitution.</p>
<p>A distinguished Mason was Right Worshipful Brother Richard
Coley, a well-known solicitor, who came to Windsor from Hong
Kong, where he had been initiated into the ancient and honourable
Fraternity. For his services to the Craft in New South Wales he
was created a Deputy Grand Master of the Order. Shortly before
his death, in the year 1889, the Lodge was re-named the "Richard
Coley Lodge" in honour of the distinguished brother. Other
officers of the Lodge who attained Grand Lodge rank wore Very
Wor. Bro. W.H.H. Becke, P.G.D. (for many years Police Magistrate
in Windsor), Very Wor. Bro. J.J. Fitzpatrick, P.G.D., Very Wor.
Bro, the Rev. P. Fitzgerald, Grand Chaplain (a former Minister of
the Presbyterian Church), Rev. S.G. Fielding, Grand Chaplain,
still in office (formerly Rector of St. Matthew's, Windsor), and
Very Wor. Brother J.J. Paine, District Grand Inspector of
Workings. It is a coincidence that Very Wor. Brother Paine, who
succeeded the late Wor. Brother Richard Coley in his practice-as
a solicitor, to some extent, took over the Masonic mantle of that
brother, for Brother Paine has been Worshipful Master of the
Lodge on seven different occasions. The Lodge was at one time
noted for the number of clergymen in its ranks; at one period no
less than five were members at the one time. Other brethren who
occupied the chair were Mr. James Ascough, Rev. C.F. Garnsey,
Rev. P. Fitzgerald, Rev. S.G. Fielding, Rev. T. Hilhouse Taylor.
The immediate Past Master of the Lodge is Wor. Brother W.B.
Greenwell, formerly of Windsor, now residing at Killara, and the
present Master is Wor. Bro. Samuel Morgan.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Oddfellows.</strong></p>
<p>The Loyal Prince of Wales, M.U., No. 4036, was opened in
Windsor on 5th April, 1845. A hall was built at an early date in
Macquarie Street. It was flooded out in June, 1867, and burnt out
with all the records in December, 1874. Tenders for re-building
were called in October, 1875, and the present hall was opened in
1876.</p>
<p>The local branch of the Oddfellows are greatly indebted to the
late John Ross, who acted as the secretary for twenty-four years.
When he took office in 1872 the credit balance was fifty-three
pounds, and when he retired in 1894 it was two thousand, three
hundred and forty-five pounds, with one hundred and sixteen
members good on the books. The income for 1892 amounted to five
hundred and twenty-five pounds. Mr. Ross was presented with a
gold albert in March, 1882, and with a beautiful illuminated
address when he retired in July, 1894.</p>
<p>Mr. T. Lobb succeeded Mr. Ross as secretary, and is running
him close for equal length of service.</p>
<p>Amongst the earlier officers of the Lodge after the fire were
Messrs. J. Robinson, J. Gillard, F. Watting, G, Adam, W. Perry,
P. Beveridge, W. Hull, W. Hopkins, Peter Mottram,&mdash;Mawson,
and A. Johnston.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Protestant Alliance.</strong></p>
<p>A branch known as the Duke of Manchester, No. 65, was in
existence in Windsor in November, 1881. The hon. secretary was
then C.M. Mills.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Sons of Temperance.</strong></p>
<p>This order was at work in 1871, when Geo. Wade was hon.
secretary, and A. Beveridge in 1873.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Loyal Orange Lodge.</strong></p>
<p>An order known as Royal Windsor, No. 52, was in operation as
early as the year 1869. J.A. Dawson was hon. secretary from 1872
to 1878. In the year 1882 a large demonstration was held in the
Church of England Hall, New Street, when one hundred and forty
brethren are reported to have been present from this and the
surrounding district, but the information about this and all such
societies is very scanty.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Bible Society,</strong></p>
<p>Away back in the days of Macquarie, we find reports, both
lengthy and frequent, in the Sydney papers of the doings of the
Bible, Society. The Rev. J. Cross was chairman, Joseph Harpur,
hon. secretary, 1820 to 1824, of the Windsor Branch.</p>
<p>Hon. Jas. Comrie, M.L.C., was for many years a supporter and
an enthusiast in the work of this Society, both in this district
and in Sydney. We find his name in 1854, connected with the
society in Sydney.</p>
<p>In the seventies we find a local branch, Mr. John Tebbutt
being president in 1870, and for several years after that date.
Mr. J.B. Johnston, senr., was president in 1890, and later Wm.
Walker, M.L.C. Mr. William Beard was hon. treasurer from 1875 to
1890; Mr. S.T. Green well being hon. secretary for the same
period, having followed Mr. Martin in that office.</p>
<p>Other good supporters at this time were Messrs. J. Lane, Wm.
C. Gambrill, W. Boddenham, and J.S. Busby, and among the clergy
the Rev. P. Fitzgerald and Rev. A. Dandie. All the other clergy
also doubtless supported the society; but their terms of office
were much less than the above.</p>
<p>Coming down to later days of the Society, the name of William
Slaughter stands out easily first. For interest. enthusiasm, and
downright hard work in all that concerns the Bible Society, he
leads. For the past forty years he has made the Bible Society one
of the main objects of his life. Of others who have helped on the
committee and in collecting funds, we select the following names,
both male and female, as worthy of mention. Doubtless there are
some others, but our list so far embraces the names of Beazley,
Barnett, Robertson, Brancker, Primrose, Dunstan, Clark, O'Kelly,
Chandler, Lobb, and Pulsford.</p>
<p>The largest sum remitted from Windsor in one year to the
parent society was sixty-six pounds, nine shillings and sixpence,
in 1883.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>Agricultural Society.</strong></p>
<p>An Agricultural Society was formed along the Hawkesbury,
including the Penrith district, about seventy years ago. Meetings
were held alternately at Penrith and Windsor. The committee was a
very large one, containing the names of most of the leading
business men and landholders of the time. The chief offices of
the society in 1845-48 were filled by Messrs. W. Bowman, K.
Fitzgerald, A.S. Panton, F. Beddek, and Thos. Tebbutt. Other
active workers were Messrs. Scarvell, Arndell, Cadell, Hassell,
Hale, Chaseling, Wilson, Parnell.</p>
<p>This society appears to have become defunct for some years,
but it was re-formed in 1875, with Mr. J.B. Johnston, president;
George Davis, hon. secretary; and S.J. Dunstan, hon. treasurer.
The names of the committee will be found in the Australian, 31st
October, 1875, but it, too, went into recess.</p>
<p>In 1882, however, the society was re-organised on a better
fooling, and has continued in operation to the present time. The
officials have been as follows: Presidents: A. Town, 1882-88;
Geo. Yeo, 1890-1; J.D. Single, 1892-3, and Philip Charley, 1904,
still in office.</p>
<p>The office of secretary was filled for over a quarter of a
century, 1882 to 1909, by C.S. Guest, who died in 1915. On his
retirement, H.S. Johnston was appointed in 1910.</p>
<p>Amongst the veterans of the Agricultural Society were: Messrs.
John Devlin, Wm. Mitchell, Christopher May, Bernard Conlon, Geo.
Nicholls, and P. Beveridge.</p>

<h3>HORSE-RACING.</h3>
<p>H<small>ORSE</small>-racing has flourished in the Hawkesbury
district from the earliest days of colonial history. Before there
were any regular clubs, and long before the inception of the
Australian Jockey Club, which now ordains and directs the
destinies of all racing clubs, races were held in several parts
of the Hawkesbury district at regular intervals. And seeing that
the Hawkesbury has become famous for the production of the sleek
thoroughbred, it is scarcely to be wondered at that racing
institutions have continued to thrive and grow here. The
magnificent horses that were bred and sold at Hobartville for
many years, up to about 1888, made the Hawkesbury famous for its
blood stock, and there are still many old "sports" in Windsor and
Richmond worshippers of the racehorse, who refer in terms of
veneration to the deeds of the sons and daughters of such
celebrated sires as Tarragon, Maribyrnong, Grand Flaneur, Far
Niente, and a lot of others.</p>
<p>As far back as 1832 races were held at Killarney, near
Magrath's Hill. John Howe was the secretary and treasurer of the
club, and the stewards were J. Teale, Geo. Loder, and John
McDonald. In 1857 the Hawkesbury Racing Club was going strong,
and H. Hoses was the hon. secretary. In 1872, the Hawkesbury Race
Club came into existence, with J.T. Smith as hon. secretary.
Later it was known as the Hawkesbury Jockey Club and Race Club,
with B. Richards, chairman from 1882-88. Since 1888 it has been
known as the Hawkesbury Race Club, and after a very successful
career for a number of years it fell on troublous times. The old
club was nearly "down and out", and passed through many
vicissitudes before it recovered itself about ten years ago.
Since then it has flourished "like the green bay tree." Its race
meetings are now attended by from six thousand to seven thousand
people, and the club makes a profit of sometimes two thousand
pounds on a meeting.</p>
<p>In 1888-89 Andrew Town, the well-known sportsman, and owner of
"Hobartville", was chairman of the Hawkesbury Race Club, and was
succeeded by J.D. Single from 1893 to 1900. The late Mr. Single
also took a keen interest in the Hawkesbury District Agricultural
Association, and was president for some years.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Callaghan, who is still with us, has been thirty
years on the committee of the Hawkesbury Race Club, and has also
filled the president's chair. Lieut.-Colonel C.S. Guest became
secretary of the club in 1882, or earlier, and occupied the
position till his death in 1915.</p>
<p>In the forties and fifties great race meetings were held at
Wilberforce. This was in the p re-railway days, and parties of
sportsmen used to drive from the far-out west to Sydney, and take
in the Wilberforce races on their way home.</p>
<p>Among the famous racehorses of the Hawkesbury district,
Jorrocks comes easily first. He was a horse of marvellous speed
and stamina, and the old horse's history has been so often
published that it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here.
Jorrocks was an equine wonder, and had a checkered career. The
old horse died in the Hawkesbury district, and was buried at
"Clifton", the property now of Mr. S. Hoskisson.</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE.</h3>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> reviewing the long past we might ask what
possibilities has the Hawkesbury, and especially Windsor, got for
the future f Here we have plenty of first-class land, none in New
South Wales better suited for intense cultivation, and combined
with this an unlimited water supply. This spells, Irrigable,
Irrigator, Irrigate, and IRRIGATION.</p>
<p>What about a local Government irrigation and poultry farm to
supply all the Government institutions and hospitals with fruit
and vegetables and eggs? Every man along the Hawkesbury should
push and agitate for the Warragamba Water Conservation Scheme,
and also some provision for storing water for the great Colo
River Valley.</p>
<p>The Riverstone Meat Company should secure and improve the
land, now not fully utilised, for miles out from and around their
present holdings, and then add refrigerating, canning, and the
utilisation of the byproducts of their industry.</p>
<p>Why not form a large company for the cold storage and
preserving of surplus summer supplies of the cucurbitaceae
family, such as pumpkins, melons, cucumbers, vegetable marrows,
etc.?</p>
<p>Factories for treating the surplus fruit&mdash;lemon and
orange peel, tomatoes, etc., should pay well.</p>
<p>The Kurrajong hills should be opened up and greatly extended
with some kind of electric traction to bring the produce down to
the railway levels from all along the hills.</p>
<p>Mills for the manufacture of cornflour should be on the spot,
and not in Sydney.</p>
<p>More lucerne should be grown and pressed ready for dispatch
direct to the dry areas of the State, or sister States, without
having to pass through the Sydney markets.</p>
<p>Factories which require much water, such as paper mills, and
cardboard factories, might, with advantage, be placed along our
tidal streams.</p>
<p>Agricultural implement factories, and such as require a large
area of level ground, might be established here.</p>
<p>The tourist traffic could be diverted along the Hawkesbury,
<i>via</i> Windsor, by the establishment of a motor or tram
service between this and the deep water at Sackville.</p>
<p>Our fine hospital building should be fully utilised for
convalescent patients from the Metropolis or in some other useful
way.</p>
<p>We have the land and the water, and what we want now is
capital to develop and utilise and save the produce of the
district.</p>
<p>And in some of the ways mentioned a large saving in freight,
storage, cartage, commission, haulage and other charges, which
are often equal to, if not more than, the profits, would thus
pass direct into the pockets of the local producers, and in
addition the question of striking a glutted market would be
obviated by the storage or preservation of the produce so as to
be able to sell in the off season.</p>

compiling of these chapters on the "Early days of Windsor".</p>
<p>In addition to the above authorities, we have to mention
others who have placed letters, pamphlets, newspaper cuttings and
other sources of information at our disposal.</p>
<p>First among these is Mr. Hy. Selkirk, of the Lands Department,
without whose assistance these records would have been very
incomplete indeed. Mr. Selkirk is a son of the late Dr. John
Selkirk, of Richmond and Windsor.</p>
<p>Mr. John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., has also given valued advice, and
loaned some interesting matter from his library. Mr. R.B. Walker
has also placed his late father's splendid collection of old
papers, books and documents at our disposal. Mr. Hy. Potter, of
Glebe Point, supplied copies of many old inscriptions. Mr. Wm.
Freame, of Westmead, has forwarded several items, and several of
his newspaper articles have been also culled. Mr. Geo. R.
Nichols, of Llandilo, and Miss Swann, of Elizabeth Farm House,
Parramatta, have also given assistance. The Rev. Geo. E.C.
Stiles, B.A., and Rev. G. D'Arcy Irvine, of Rose Bay, and Capt.
J.H. Watson, North Sydney, have assisted, especially with the
article on St. Matthew's. Miss F. Allman, grand-daughter of
Samuel North, has given interesting particulars of his life.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to thank Mr. C.H. Bertie, of the Sydney
Municipal library, for many suggestions, and for revising the
proof sheets.</p>
