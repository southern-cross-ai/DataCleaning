<hr>
<p>Prominent among the naval patrols that England sends to police
the southern seas and guard the island fringes of the Empire,
making the while their headquarters in Port Jackson, is the
Pylades, now on another cruise among the British possessions and
protectorates in Oceania. Peculiar interest attaches to this
vessel, because she is absolutely the last of the barque-rigged
craft, of which the British Navy once possessed so many. Of course,
there are still men-of-war to be found in commission rigged as
barquentines, three-masted, but with yards on the foremast only,
and as topsail schooners, two-masted, and square on the fore. But
the Pylades, with her barque-rig of yards on both fore and main
mast, and fore-and-aft sails on her mizzen, is the last survival of
the type, as apart from the absolute square-rig, or full-rigged
ship, which has long disappeared out of actual service. Built at
Sheerness in 1884, the third-class cruiser was named after the
bosom friend of Orestes, a hero of Greek tragedy, and the son of
Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Twenty years ago we went to the
ancients for the nomenclature of warships more frequently than is
now the case; twice twenty years ago the practice was even more
common, and in many instances the names then given have been
perpetuated, and will be so while the British Navy exists.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1302291h-images/1302291h-01.jpg" alt="" width="550"

<p>The Pylades is what is known as &quot;composite&quot; built.
Soon after the building of ships with iron was commenced, this
composite system of construction was adopted in the British
merchant service, and some very fast and celebrated vessels were
thus constructed. The iron framing, with wooden skin planking,
admitted of considerable strength being obtained, and the
possibility of sheathing the bottom with metal in order to avoid
fouling, appeared to be another advantage in favour of the
composite system. Soon, however, it was shown that the galvanic
action set up between the copper on the &quot;yellow metal&quot;
sheathing and the iron frames tended to rapidly deteriorate the
ironwork, and perhaps, sooner or later, hasten the loss of the
vessel. So rapid, indeed, was this wasting of the frame found to
be, that for some time past the composite system has been, so far
as regards merchantmen, quite abandoned. Some ships, however, are
still built &quot;composite&quot; for the Royal Navy, especially
such craft as are intended for use on foreign stations, and whose
duties would render frequent docking impossible. Such vessels are
built with frames of steel, then sheathed with wood, and
coppered.</p>
<p>Such is the explanation of the laconic description
&quot;composite,&quot; which stands against the Pylades' name in
the Navy List. For the rest, she has one screw and one funnel; her
length is 200ft, and her beam 38ft. Her mean draught is 14ft 7in,
with a displacement of 1420 tons. Her indicated h.p., with natural
draught, is 950, equal to a speed of 11.5 knots; with forced
draught it is supposed to be equal to 13.1 knots. She can carry
enough coal to steam 6000 miles at a 10 knot rate. Her engines are
by Laird; horizontal-compound in type. Her protection is partial,
consisting of a 1.5in steel deck. She carries fourteen 5in 38cwt
breech-loaders; she has also eight machine and one light gun. The
crew numbers 159.</p>
<p>Like most of the other third-class cruisers of her
day&mdash;such, for instance, as the Cordelia, Calliope, and
Calypso, all built about the early eighties, but all longer than
the Pylades&mdash;she must, for all practical purposes of modern
warfare, be considered quite obsolete. In the British Navy there
are 30 or 40 of these ships still in commission, and used, many of
them, for that policing of the seas that is so largely left to
Great Britain to maintain single-handed. And it must be granted
that most of these obsolete vessels are quite equal to the duty
thus imposed upon them. They can, if necessary, make long passages
under steam alone; also, in consequence, they are much cheaper to
maintain, and are quite as efficient in peace time as more modern
ships would be. As to the wisdom of keeping such a fleet in
commission and taking the risk of, in case of war, losing between
three and four thousand men off the strength of the navy, opinions
may perhaps differ. But to return to the Pylades.</p>
<p>In May, 1899, she arrived on the Australian station to relieve
the little Ringdove, a screw gunboat of the first class. After a
stay of two months in port she left on her first cruise among the
Islands, her first calls being at Fiji and Samoa. And, as
illustrating the duties as well as the pleasures which fall to the
lot of the naval patroller, some experiences of the cruise will be
found of interest. After clearing the Heads of Port Jackson she was
driven at full speed for 24 hours, averaging 12 knots. Sail was
used after this steam trial nearly all the way to Suva. The period
was just subsequent to the Samoan trouble, and there had been a
general gathering of warships of different nationalities in Apia
Harbour. But when the Pylades called there the second time there
were left only the Torch, the German Cormoran, and the Abarenda, a
U.S. supply ship. While at Apia a sports gathering was got up by
the officers and crews of the two British warships, and, naturally,
the Germans and the Americans were invited. The Americans accepted,
and had &quot;a real good time,&quot; but the Germans sulked and
refused, an attitude, it is to be feared, growing typical of late
years where anything British is concerned.</p>
<p>Before this incident, however, the Pylades had been visiting
many of the more distant islands, in company as far as Nassan with
her sister patrol, the Torch, with which vessel the new arrival
joined in shooting away their quarterly allowance of ammunition, as
provided for by the regulations. Neither of the warships anchored
at Nassau, which belongs to the Union Group, one among the many
similar collections of islets, atolls, and other lumps of inhabited
coral, coloured &quot;all Red&quot; in the South Pacific. The
captains of the two vessels, however, landed, and had a look round
to see that all was safe in the little possession.</p>
<p>Thence the Torch made her way back to Apia, while the Pylades
continued on her patrol to Hanger Island, in the same group, and
from there to Humphrey Island, one of the Manahikl cluster.
Although received everywhere with enthusiasm and acclamation by the
natives, their reception of the Pylades at Tongarema, one of the
last-mentioned islands, was fervent in the extreme. It was rare,
indeed, that the natives were visited by a warship, and the
islanders made the most of the occasion. In her honour dances were
arranged, and feasts held with much ceremonial display,
reciprocated on the part of the Pylades by concerts and the
allowance of a wholesale inspection by the natives, on which
occasions the cruiser simply swarmed with coloured humanity
&quot;from truck to keelson.&quot; And to make matters pleasanter,
not once during the course of her patrol did the policeman find
anything wrong on her beat, or have occasion to shell a village, or
smash up canoes, or in any fashion whatever mete out punishment.
Had the islanders of the various groups known of the custom, the
Pylades would have had enough white gloves presented to her during
this first cruise to have kept her wardroom in supplies for a good
year to come.</p>
<p>Leaving Tongarowa, after a stay of five days, the Pylades
returned to Apia, via Suwarrow, and there in conjunction with the
&quot;Torches,&quot; gave a grand concert in aid of the
&quot;Coffee House and Free Library of All Nations.&quot; As a
passenger as far as Suva, on her return trip, she had Malietoa, one
of the rival Samoan chiefs, whose name in these days was very much
in people's mouth. In pursuance of one of her duties as keeper of
the seas, she discovered a danger to navigation at the entrance to
Suva Harbour, in the shape of a coral reef, and treated it
satisfactorily with gun-cotton. The cruiser entered Sydney Heads on
her return under sail, and many people will remember the pretty
picture she made on that occasion, taking, as it did, five hours to
get to her moorings, because of a strong head wind. And it is just
possible that, in addition to being the last of the naval barques,
the Pylades may also bear the record of being the last British
man-o'-war to enter Port Jackson under canvas.</p>
