     id="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a></h3>

  <p class="first">The ancient steps wound up the side of the mountain through
  the tall pines, patience trodden deep into them by the feet of twenty
  centuries. Some soul of silence, ancient and patient as the steps, brooded
  over them. They were wide, twenty men could have marched abreast upon them;
  lichens brown and orange traced strange symbols on their grey stones, and
  emerald mosses cushioned them. At times the steps climbed steep as stairs,
  and at times they swept leisurely around bastions of the mountain, but always
  on each side the tall pines stood close, green shoulder to shoulder,
  vigilant.</p>

  <p>At the feet of the pines crouched laurels and dwarfed rhododendrons of a
  singular regularity of shape and of one height, that of a kneeling man. Their
  stiff and glossy leaves were like links on coats-of-mail... like the jade-
  lacquered scale-armor of the Green Archers of Kwanyin who guard the goddess
  when she goes forth in the Spring to awaken the trees. The pines were like
  watchful sentinels, and oddly like crouching archers were the laurels and the
  dwarfed rhododendrons, and they said as plainly as though with tongues: Up
  these steps you may go, and down them&mdash;but never try to pass through
  us!</p>

  <p>A woman came round one of the bastions. She walked stubbornly, head down,
  as one who fights against a strong wind&mdash;or as one whose will rides,
  lashing the reluctant body on. One white shoulder and breast were bare, and
  on the shoulder was a bruise and blood, four scarlet streaks above the
  purpled patch as though a long-nailed hand had struck viciously, clawing. And
  as she walked she wept.</p>

  <p>The steps began to lift. The woman raised her head and saw how steeply
  here they climbed. She stopped, her hands making little fluttering helpless
  motions.</p>

  <p>She turned, listening. She seemed to listen not with ears alone but with
  every tensed muscle, her entire body one rapt chord of listening through
  which swept swift arpeggios of terror. The brittle twilight of the Yunnan
  highlands, like clearest crystal made impalpable, fell upon brown hair shot
  with gleams of dull copper, upon a face lovely even in its dazed horror. Her
  grey eyes stared down the steps, and it was as though they, too, were
  listening rather than seeing...</p>

  <p>She was heavy with child...</p>

  <p>She heard voices beyond the bend of the bastion, voices guttural and sing-
  song, angry and arguing, protesting and urging. She heard the shuffle of many
  feet, hesitating, halting, but coming inexorably on. Voices and feet of the
  hung-hutzes, the outlaws who had slaughtered her husband and Kenwood and
  their bearers a scant hour ago, and who but for Kenwood would now have her.
  They had found her trail.</p>

  <p>She wanted to die; desperately Jean Meredith wanted to die; her faith
  taught her that then she would rejoin that scholarly, gentle lover-husband of
  hers whom she had loved so dearly although his years had been twice her own.
  It would not matter did they kill her quickly, but she knew they would not do
  that. And she could not endure even the thought of what must befall her
  through them before death came. Nor had she weapon to kill herself. And there
  was that other life budding beneath her heart.</p>

  <p>But stronger than desire for death, stronger than fear of torment,
  stronger than the claim of the unborn was something deep within her that
  cried for vengeance. Not vengeance against the hung-hutzes&mdash;they were
  only a pack of wild beasts doing what was their nature to do. This cry was
  for vengeance against those who had loosed them, directed them. For this she
  knew had been done, although how she knew it she could not yet tell. It was
  not accident, no chance encounter that swift slaughter. She was sure of
  that.</p>

  <p>It was like a pulse, that cry for vengeance; a pulse whose rhythm grew,
  deadening grief and terror, beating strength back into her. It was like a
  bitter spring welling up around her soul. When its dark waters had risen far
  enough they would touch her lips and she would drink of them... and then
  knowledge would come to her... she would know who had planned this evil
  thing, and why. But she must have time&mdash;time to drink of the waters
  &mdash;time to learn and avenge. She must live... for vengeance...</p>

  <p class="quote">Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!</p>

  <p>It was as though a voice had whispered the old text in her ear. She struck
  her breast with clenched hands; she looked with eyes grown hard and tearless
  up to the tranquil sky; she answered the voice:</p>

  <p>"A lie! Like all the lies I have been taught of&mdash;You! I am through
  with&mdash;You! Vengeance! Whoever gives me vengeance shall be my God!"</p>

  <p>The voices and the feet were nearer. Strange, how slowly, how reluctantly
  they advanced. It was as though they were afraid. She studied the woods
  beyond the pines. Impenetrable; or if not, then impossible for her. They
  would soon find her if she tried to hide there. She must go on&mdash;up the
  steps. At their end might be some hiding place... perhaps sanctuary...</p>

  <p>Yes, she was sure the hung-hutzes feared the steps... they came so slowly,
  so haltingly... arguing, protesting...</p>

  <p>She had seen another turn at the top of this steep. If she could reach it
  before they saw her, it might be that they would follow her no further. She
  turned to climb...</p>

  <p>A fox stood upon the steps a dozen feet above her, watching her, barring
  her way. It was a female fox, a vixen. Its coat was all silken russet-red. It
  had a curiously broad head and slanted green eyes. On its head was a mark,
  silver white and shaped like the flame of a candle wavering in the wind.</p>

  <p>The fox was lithe and graceful, Jean Meredith thought, as a dainty woman.
  A mad idea came, born of her despair and her denial of that God whom she had
  been taught from childhood to worship as all-good, all-wise, all-powerful.
  She thrust her hands out to the fox. She cried to it:</p>

  <p>"Sister&mdash;you are a woman! Lead me to safety that I may have
  vengeance&mdash;sister!"</p>

  <p>Remember, she had just seen her husband die under the knives of the hung-
  hutzes and she was with child... and who can know upon what fantastic paths
  of unreality a mind so beset may stray.</p>

  <p>As though it had understood the fox paced slowly down the steps. And again
  she thought how like a graceful woman it was. It paused a little beyond reach
  of her hand, studying her with those slanted green eyes&mdash;eyes clear and
  brilliant as jewels, sea-green, and like no eyes she had ever seen in any
  animal. There seemed faint mockery in their gaze, a delicate malice, but as
  they rested upon her bruised shoulder and dropped to her swollen girdle, she
  could have sworn that there was human comprehension in them, and pity. She
  whispered:</p>

  <p>"Sister&mdash;help me!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden outburst of the guttural singsong. They were close now,
  her pursuers, close to the bend of the steps round which she had come. Soon
  they must turn it and see her. She stood staring at the fox expectantly...
  hoping she knew not what.</p>

  <p>The fox slipped by her, seemed to melt in the crouching bushes. It
  vanished.</p>

  <p>Black despair, the despair of a child who finds itself abandoned to wild
  beasts by one it has trusted, closed in on Jean Meredith. What she had hoped
  for, what she had expected of help, was vague, unformulated. A miracle by
  alien gods, now she had renounced her own? Or had her appeal to the vixen
  deeper impulse? Atavistic awakenings, anthropomorphic, going back to that
  immemorial past when men first thought of animals and birds as creatures with
  souls like theirs, but closer to Nature's spirit; given by that spirit a
  wisdom greater than human, and more than human powers&mdash;servants and
  messengers of potent deities and little less than gods themselves.</p>

  <p>Nor has it been so long ago that St. Francis of Assisi spoke to the beasts
  and birds as he did to men and women, naming them Brother Wolf and Brother
  Eagle. And did not St. Conan baptize the seals of the Orkneys as he did the
  pagan men? The past and all that men have thought in the past is born anew
  within us all. And sometimes strange doors open within our minds&mdash;and
  out of them or into them strange spirits come or go. And whether real or
  unreal, who can say?</p>

  <p>The fox seemed to understand&mdash;had seemed to promise&mdash; something.
  And it had abandoned her, fled away! Sobbing, she turned to climb the
  steps.</p>

  <p>Too late! The hung-hutzes had rounded the bend.</p>

  <p>There was a howling chorus. With obscene gestures, yapping threats, they
  ran toward her. Ahead of the pack was the pock-faced, half-breed Tibetan
  leader whose knife had been the first to cut her husband down. She watched
  them come, helpless to move, unable even to close her eyes. The pock-face saw
  and understood, gave quick command, and the pack slowed to a walk, gloating
  upon her agony, prolonging it.</p>

  <p>They halted! Something like a flicker of russet flame had shot across the
  steps between her and them. It was the fox. It stood there, quietly regarding
  them. And hope flashed up through Jean Meredith, melting the cold terror that
  had frozen her. Power of motion returned. But she did not try to run. She did
  not want to run. The cry for vengeance was welling up again. She felt that
  cry reach out to the fox.</p>

  <p>As though it had heard her, the fox turned its head and looked at her. She
  saw its green eyes sparkle, its white teeth bared as though it smiled.</p>

  <p>Its eyes withdrawn, the spell upon the hung-hutzes broke. The leader drew
  pistol, fired upon the fox.</p>

  <p>Jean Meredith saw, or thought she saw, the incredible.</p>

  <p>Where fox had been, stood now a woman! She was tall, and lithe as a young
  willow. Jean Meredith could not see her face, but she could see hair of
  russet-red coifed upon a small and shapely head. A silken gown of russet-red,
  sleeveless, dropped to the woman's feet. She raised an arm and pointed at the
  pock-faced leader. Behind him his men were silent, motionless, even as Jean
  Meredith had been&mdash;and it came to her that it was the same ice of terror
  that held them. Their eyes were fixed upon the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman's hand dropped&mdash;slowly. And as it dropped, the pock-faced
  Tibetan dropped with it. He sank to his knees and then upon his hands. He
  stared into her face, lips drawn back from his teeth like a snarling dog, and
  there was foam upon his lips. Then he hurled himself upon his men, like a
  wolf. He sprang upon them howling; he leaped up at their throats, tearing at
  them with teeth and talons. They milled, squalling rage and bewildered
  terror. They tried to beat him off&mdash;they could not.</p>

  <p>There was a flashing of knives. The pock-face lay writhing on the steps,
  like a dog dying. Still squalling, never looking behind them, his men poured
  down the steps and away.</p>

  <p>Jean Meredith's hands went up, covering her eyes. She dropped them&mdash;
  a fox, all silken russet-red, stood where the woman had been. It was watching
  her. She saw its green eyes sparkle, its white teeth bared as though it
  smiled&mdash;it began to walk daintily up the steps toward her.</p>

  <p>Weakness swept over her; she bent her head, crumpled to her knees, covered
  again her eyes with shaking hands. She was aware of an unfamiliar fragrance
  &mdash;disturbing, evocative of strange, fleeting images. She heard low,
  sweet laughter. She heard a soft voice whisper:</p>

  <p>"Sister!"</p>

  <p>She looked up. A woman's face was bending over her. An exquisite face...
  with sea-green, slanted eyes under a broad white brow... with hair of russet-
  red that came to a small peak in the center of that brow... a lock of silvery
  white shaped like the flame of a candle wavering in the wind... a nose long
  but delicate, the nostrils slightly flaring, daintily... a mouth small and
  red as the royal coral, heart-shaped, lips full, archaic.</p>

  <p>Over that exquisite face, like a veil, was faint mockery, a delicate
  malice that had in them little of the human. Her hands were white and long
  and slender.</p>

  <p>They touched Jean Meredith's heart... soothing her, strengthening her,
  drowning fear and sorrow.</p>

  <p>She heard again the sweet voice, lilting, faintly amused&mdash;with the
  alien, half-malicious amusement of one who understands human emotion yet has
  never felt it, but knows how little it matters:</p>

  <p>"You shall have your vengeance&mdash;Sister!" The white hands touched her
  eyes... she forgot... and forgot... and now there was nothing to remember...
  not even herself...</p>

  <p>It seemed to Jean Meredith that she lay cushioned within soft, blind
  darkness&mdash;illimitable, impenetrable. She had no memories; all that she
  knew was that she was. She thought: I am I. The darkness that cradled her was
  gentle, kindly. She thought: I am a spirit still unborn in the womb of night.
  But what was night... and what was spirit? She thought: I am content&mdash; I
  do not want to be born again. Again? That meant that she had been born
  before... a word came to her&mdash;Jean. She thought: I am Jean... but who
  was Jean?</p>

  <p>She heard two voices speaking. One a woman's, soft and sweet with
  throbbing undertones like plucked harp strings. She had heard that voice
  before... before, when she had been Jean. The man's voice was low, filled
  with tranquillity, human... that was it, the voice held within it a humanness
  the sweet voice of the woman lacked. She thought: I, Jean, am human...</p>

  <p>The man said: "Soon she must awaken. The tide of sleep is high on the
  shore of life. It must not cover it."</p>

  <p>The woman answered: "I command that tide. And it has begun to ebb. Soon
  she will awaken."</p>

  <p>He asked: "Will she remember?"</p>

  <p>The woman said: "She will remember. But she will not suffer. It will be as
  though what she remembers had happened to another self of hers. She will pity
  that self, but it will be to her as though it died when died her husband. As
  indeed it did. That self bears the sorrow, the pain, the agony. It leaves no
  legacy of them to her&mdash;save memory."</p>

  <p>And now it seemed to her that for a time there was a silence... although
  she knew that time could not exist within the blackness that cradled her...
  and what was&mdash;time?</p>

  <p>The man's voice broke that silence, musingly: "With memory there can be no
  happiness for her, long as she lives."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed, a tingling-sweet mocking chime: "Happiness? I thought
  you wiser than to cling to that illusion, priest. I give her serenity, which
  is far better than happiness. Nor did she ask for happiness. She asked for
  vengeance. And vengeance she shall have."</p>

  <p>The man said: "But she does not know who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The woman interrupted: "She does know. And I know. And so shall you when
  you have told her what was wrung from the Tibetan before he died. And if you
  still do not believe, you will believe when he who is guilty comes here, as
  come he will&mdash;to kill the child."</p>

  <p>The man whispered: "To kill the child!"</p>

  <p>The woman's voice became cold, losing none of its sweetness but edged with
  menace: "You must not let him have it, priest. Not then. Later, when the word
  is given you "</p>

  <p>Again the voice grew mocking... "I contemplate a journey... I would see
  other lands, who so long have dwelt among these hills... and I would not have
  my plans spoiled by precipitancy..."</p>

  <p>Once more Jean Meredith heard the tingling laughter. "Have no fear,
  priest. They will help you&mdash;my sisters."</p>

  <p>He said, steadily: "I have no fear."</p>

  <p>The woman's voice became gentle, all mockery fled. She said:</p>

  <p>"I know that, you who have had wisdom and courage to open forbidden doors.
  But I am bound by a threefold cord&mdash;a promise, a vow, and a desire. When
  a certain time comes, I must surrender much&mdash;must lie helpless, bound by
  that cord. It is then that I shall need you, priest, for this man who will
  come "</p>

  <p>The voices faded. Slowly the blackness within which she lay began to
  lighten. Slowly, slowly, a luminous grayness replaced it. She thought,
  desperately: I am going to be born! I don't want to be born! Implacably, the
  light increased. Now within the grayness was a nimbus of watery emerald. The
  nimbus became brighter, brighter...</p>

  <p>She was lying upon a low bed, in a nest of silken cushions. Close to her
  was an immense and ancient bronze vessel, like a baptismal font. The hands of
  thousands of years had caressed it, leaving behind them an ever deepening
  patina like a soft green twilight. A ray of the sun shone upon it, and where
  the ray rested, the patina gleamed like a tiny green sun. Upon the sides of
  the great bowl were strange geometric patterns, archaic, the spirals and
  meanders of the Lei-wen&mdash;the thunder patterns. It stood upon three legs,
  tripodal... why, it was the ancient ceremonial vessel, the Tang font which
  Martin had brought home from Yunnan years ago... and she was back home... she
  had dreamed that she had been in China and that Martin... that Martin...</p>

  <p>She sat up abruptly and looked through wide, opened doors into a garden.
  Broad steps dropped shallowly to an oval pool around whose sides were lithe
  willows trailing green tendrils in the blue water, wisterias with drooping
  ropes of blossoms, white and pale azure, and azaleas like flower flames. Rosy
  lilies lay upon the pool's breast. And at its far end was a small pagoda,
  fairy-like, built all of tiles of iridescent peacock blue and on each side a
  stately cypress, as though they were its ministers... why, this was their
  garden, the garden of the blue pagoda which Martin had copied from that place
  in Yunnan where lived his friend, the wise old priest...</p>

  <p>But there was something wrong. These mountains were not like those of the
  ranch. They were conical, their smooth bare slopes of rose-red stone circled
  with trees. They were like huge stone hats with green brims...</p>

  <p>She turned again and looked about the room. It was a wide room and a deep
  one, but how deep she could not see, because the sun streaming in from a high
  window struck the ancient vessel and made a curtain, veiling it beyond. She
  could see that there were beams across its ceiling, mellow with age, carved
  with strange symbols. She caught glimpses of ivory and of gleaming lacquer.
  There was a low altar of what seemed green jade, curiously carved and upon
  which were ceremonial objects of unfamiliar shape, a huge ewer of bronze
  whose lid was the head of a fox...</p>

  <p>A man came toward her, walking out of the shadows beyond the ancient Tang
  vessel. He was clothed from neck to feet in a silken robe of silvery-blue
  upon which were embroidered, delicately as though by spiders, Taoist symbols
  and under them, ghostly in silver threads, a fox's head. He was bald, his
  face heavy, expressionless, skin smooth and faded yellow as some antique
  parchment. So far as age went he might have been sixty&mdash;or three
  hundred. But it was his eyes that held Jean Meredith. They were large and
  black and, liquid, and prodigiously alive. They were young eyes, belying the
  agelessness of the heavy face; and it was as though the face was but a mask
  from which the eyes had drawn all life into themselves. They poured into her
  strength and calmness and reassurance, and from her mind vanished all
  vagueness, all doubts, all fears. Her mind for the first time since the
  ambush was clear, crystal clear, her thoughts her own.</p>

  <p>She remembered&mdash;remembered everything. But it was as though all had
  happened to another self. She felt pity for that self, but it had left no
  heritage of sorrow. She was tranquil. The black, youthful eyes poured
  tranquillity into her.</p>

  <p>She said: "I know you. You are Yu Ch'ien, the wise priest my husband
  loved. This is the Temple of the Foxes."</p><br>

 <h3><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a></h3>

  <p class="first">"I am Yu Ch'ien, my daughter." His voice was the man's voice
  which she had heard when cradled in the darkness.</p>

  <p>She tried to rise, then swayed back upon the bed, weakness overcoming
  her.</p>

  <p>He said: "A night and a day, and still another night and half this day you
  have slept, and now you must eat." He spoke the English words slowly, as one
  whose tongue had long been stranger to them.</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands and a woman slipped by the great vase through the
  bars of the sunlight. She was ageless as he, with broad shrewd face and
  tilted sloe-black eyes that were kindly yet very wise. A smock covered her
  from full breasts to knees, and she was sturdy and strong and brown as though
  she had been carved from seasoned wood. In her hands was a tray upon which
  was a bowl of steaming broth and oaten cakes.</p>

  <p>The woman sat beside Jean Meredith, lifting her head, resting it against
  her deep bosom and feeding her like a child, and now Jean saw that herself
  was naked except for a thin robe of soft blue silk and that upon it was the
  moon-silver symbol of the fox.</p>

  <p>The priest nodded, his eyes smiled upon her. "Fien-wi will attend you.
  Soon you will be stronger. Soon I shall return. Then we shall talk."</p>

  <p>He passed out of the wide doors. The woman fed her the last of the broth,
  the last of the little cakes. She left her, and returned with bowls of bronze
  in which was water hot and cold; undressed her; ministered to her, bathed her
  and rubbed her; dressed her in fresh silken robes of blue; strapped sandals
  to her feet, and smiling, left her. Thrice Jean essayed to speak to her, but
  the woman only shook her head, answering in a lisping dialect, no sound of
  which she recognized.</p>

  <p>The sun had moved from the great Tang font. She lay back, lazily. Her mind
  was limpidly clear; upon it was reflected all through which she had passed,
  yet it was tranquil, untroubled, like a woodland pool that reflects the storm
  clouds but whose placid surface lies undisturbed. The things that had
  happened were only images reflected upon her mind. But under that placid
  surface was something implacable, adamant-hard, something that would have
  been bitter did it not know that it was to be satisfied.</p>

  <p>She thought over what Martin had told her of Yu Ch'ien. A Chinese whose
  forefathers had been enlightened rulers ten centuries before the Man of
  Galilee had been raised upon the cross, who had studied Occidental thought
  both in England and France, and had found little in it to satisfy his thirst
  for wisdom; who had gone back to the land of his fathers, embraced at last
  the philosophy of Lao-Tse, and had withdrawn from the world to an ancient
  fane in Yunnan known as the Temple of the Foxes, a temple reverenced and
  feared and around which strange legends clustered; there to spend his life in
  meditation and study.</p>

  <p>What was it Martin had called him? Ah, yes, a master of secret and
  forgotten knowledge, a master of illusion. She knew that of all men, Martin
  had held Yu Ch'ien in profoundest respect, deepest affection... she wondered
  if the woman she had seen upon the steps had been one of his illusions... if
  the peace she felt came from him... if he had made sorrow and pain of soul
  illusions for her... and was she thinking the thoughts he had placed in her
  mind&mdash;or her own... she wondered dreamily, not much caring...</p>

  <p>He came through the doors to her, and again it was as though his eyes were
  springs of tranquillity from which her soul drank deep. She tried to rise, to
  greet him; her mind was strong but through all her body was languor. He
  touched her forehead, and the languor fled. He said:</p>

  <p>"All is well with you, my daughter. But now we must talk. We will go into
  the garden."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands. The brown woman, Fien-wi, came at the summons, and
  with her two blue-smocked men bearing a chair. The woman lifted her, placed
  her in the chair. The men carried her out of the wide doors, down the shallow
  steps to the blue pool. She looked behind her as she went.</p>

  <p>The temple was built into the brow of the mountain. It was of brown stone
  and brown wood. Slender pillars hard bitten by the teeth of the ages held up
  a curved roof of the peacock blue tiles. From the wide doors through which
  she had come a double row of sculptured foxes ran, like Thebes' Road of the
  Sphinxes, half way down to the pool. Over the crest of the mountain crept the
  ancient steps up which she had stumbled. Where the steps joined the temple,
  stood a tree covered all with white blossoms. It wavered in the wind like the
  flame of a candle.</p>

  <p>Strangely was the temple like the head of a fox, its muzzle between the
  paws of the rows of sculptured foxes, the crest of the mountain its forehead
  and the white blossoming tree, like the lock of white upon the forehead of
  the fox of the steps... and the white lock upon the forehead of the
  woman...</p>

  <p>They were at the pool. There was a seat cut at the end, facing the blue
  pagoda. The woman Fien-wi piled the stone with cushions and, as she waited,
  Jean Meredith saw that there were arms to this seat and that at the end of
  each was the head of a fox, and that over its back was a tracery of dancing
  foxes; and she saw, too, that on each side of the seat tiny paths had been
  cut in stone leading to the water, as though for some small-footed creatures
  to trot upon and drink.</p>

  <p>She was lifted to the stone chair, and sank into the cushions. Except for
  the seat and the little runways, it was as though she sat beside the pool
  Martin had built at their California ranch. There, as here, the willows
  dipped green tendrils into the water; there, as here, drooped ropes of
  wisteria, pale amethyst and white. And here as there was peace.</p>

  <p>Yu Ch'ien spoke: "A stone is thrown into a pool. The ripples spread and
  break against the shore. At last they cease and the pool is as before. Yet
  when the stone strikes, as it sinks and while the ripples live, microscopic
  lives within the pool are changed. But not for long. The stone touches
  bottom, the pool again becomes calm. It is over, and life for the tiny things
  is as before."</p>

  <p>She said quietly, out of the immense clarity of her mind: "You mean, Yu
  Ch'ien, that my husband's murder was such a stone."</p>

  <p>He went on, as though she had not spoken: "But there is life within life,
  and over life, and under life&mdash;as we know life. And that which happens
  to the tiny things within the pool may be felt by those beneath and above
  them. Life is a bubble in which are lesser bubbles which we cannot see, and
  the bubble we call life is only part of a greater bubble which also we may
  not see. But sometimes we perceive those bubbles, sometimes glimpse the
  beauty of the greater, sense the kinship of the lesser... and sometimes a
  lesser life touches ours and then we speak of demons... and when the greater
  ones touch us we name it inspiration from Heaven, an angel speaking through
  our lips&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted, thought crystal clear: "I understand you, Martin's murder
  was the stone. It would pass with its ripples&mdash;but it has disturbed some
  pool within which it was a lesser pool. Very well, what then?"</p>

  <p>He said: "There are places in this world where the veil between it and the
  other worlds is thin. They can enter. Why it is so, I do not know&mdash;but I
  know it is so. The ancients recognized such places. They named those who
  dwelt unseen there the genii locorum&mdash;literally, the spirits of the
  places. This mountain, this temple, is such a place. It is why I came to
  it."</p>

  <p>She said: "You mean the fox I saw upon the steps. You mean the woman I
  thought I saw take the place of that fox, and who drove the Tibetan mad. The
  fox I asked to help me and to give me revenge, and whom I called sister. The
  woman I thought I saw who whispered to me that I should have revenge and who
  called me sister. Very well, what then?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "It is true. The murder of your husband was the stone. Better
  to have let the ripples die. But there was this place... there was a
  moment... and now the ripples cannot die until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again she interrupted the true thought&mdash;or what she believed the true
  thought&mdash;flashing up through her mind like sun-glints from jewels at a
  clear pool's bottom. "I had denied my God. Whether he exists or does not, I
  had stripped myself of my armor against those other lives. I did it where and
  when such other lives, if they exist, could strike. I accept that. And again,
  what then?"</p>

  <p>He said: "You have a strong soul, my daughter."</p>

  <p>She answered, with a touch of irony: "While I was within the blackness,
  before I awakened, I seemed to hear two persons talking, Yu Ch'ien. One had
  your voice, and the other the voice of the fox woman who called me sister.
  She promised me serenity. Well, I have that. And having it, I am as unhuman
  as was her voice. Tell me, Yu Ch'ien, whom my husband called master of
  illusions, was that woman upon the steps one of your illusions, and was her
  voice another? Does my serenity come from her or from you? I am no child,
  and, I know how easily you could accomplish this, by drugs or by your will
  while I lay helpless."</p>

  <p>He said: "My daughter, if they were illusions&mdash;they were not mine.
  And if they were illusions, then I, like you, am victim to them."</p>

  <p>She asked: "You mean you have seen&mdash;her?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "And her sisters. Many times."</p>

  <p>She said shrewdly: "Yet that does not prove her real&mdash;she might have
  passed from your mind to mine."</p>

  <p>He did not answer. She asked abruptly: "Shall I live?"</p>

  <p>He replied without hesitation. "No."</p>

  <p>She considered that for a little, looking at the willow tendrils, the
  ropes of wisteria. She mused: "I did not ask for happiness, but she gives me
  serenity. I did not ask for life, so she gives me&mdash;vengeance. But I no
  longer care for vengeance."</p>

  <p>He said gravely: "It does not matter. You struck into that other life. You
  asked, and you were promised. The ripples upon the greater pool cannot cease
  until that promise is fulfilled."</p>

  <p>She considered that, looking at the conical hills. She laughed. "They are
  like great stone hats with brims of green. What are their faces like, I
  wonder." He asked: "Who killed your husband?" She answered, still smiling at
  the hatted hills: "Why, his brother, of course."</p>

  <p>He asked: "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>She lifted her arms and twined her hands behind her neck. She said, as
  impersonally as though she read from a book: "I was little more than twenty
  when I met Martin, Just out of college. He was fifty. But inside&mdash;he was
  a dreaming boy. Oh, I knew he had lots and lots of money. It didn't matter. I
  loved him&mdash;for the boy inside him. He asked me to marry him. I married
  him.</p>

  <p>"Charles hated me from the beginning. Charles is his brother, fifteen
  years younger. Charles' wife hated me. You see, there was no other besides
  Charles until I came. If Martin died&mdash;well, all his money would go to
  Charles. They never thought he would marry. For the last ten years Charles
  had looked after his business&mdash;his mines, his investments. I really
  don't blame Charles for hating me&mdash;but he shouldn't have killed
  Martin."</p>

  <p>"We spent our honeymoon out on Martin's ranch. He has a pool and garden
  just like this, you know. It's just as beautiful, but the mountains around it
  have snowy caps instead of the stony, green-rimmed ones. And he had a great
  bronze vessel like that of yours. He told me that he had copied the garden
  from Yu Ch'ien's even to the blue pagoda. And that the vessel had a mate in
  Yu Ch'ien's Temple of the Foxes. And he told me... of you...</p>

  <p>"Then the thought came to him to return to you and your temple. Martin was
  a boy&mdash;the desire gripped him. I did not care, if it made him happy. So
  we came. Charles with us as far as Nanking. Hating me, I knew, every mile of
  the journey. At Nanking&mdash;I told Martin I was going to have a baby. I had
  known it for months but I hadn't told him because I was afraid he would put
  off this trip on which he had set his heart. Now I knew I couldn't keep it
  secret much longer. Martin was so happy! He told Charles, who hated me then
  more than ever. And Martin made a will. If Martin should die, Charles was to
  act as trustee for me and the child, carry on the estate as before, with his
  share of the income increased. All the balance, and there are millions, was
  left to me and the coming baby. There was also a direct bequest of half a
  million to Charles.</p>

  <p>"Martin read the will to him. I was present. So was Kenwood, Martin's
  secretary. I saw Charles turn white, but outwardly he was pleasantly
  acquiescent, concerned only lest something really might happen to his
  brother. But I guessed what was in his heart.</p>

  <p>"Kenwood liked me, and he did not like Charles. He came to me one night in
  Nanking, a few days before we were to start for Yunnan. He tried to dissuade
  me from the journey. He was a bit vague about reasons, talked of my
  condition, hard traveling and so on, but that was ridiculous. At last I asked
  him point-blank&mdash;why? Then he said that Charles was secretly meeting a
  Chinese captain, by name&mdash;Li-kong. I asked what of it, he had a right to
  pick his friends. Kenwood said Li-kong was suspected of being in touch with
  certain outlaws operating in Szechwan and Yunnan, and of receiving and
  disposing of the best of their booty. Kenwood said: 'If both you and Martin
  die before the baby is born, Charles will inherit everything. He's next of
  kin and the only one, for you have nobody. You're going up into Yunnan. How
  easy to send word to one of these bands to look out for you. And then brother
  Charles would have it all. Of course, there's no use saying anything to your
  husband. He trusts everybody, and Charles most of all. All that would happen
  would be my dismissal.'</p>

  <p>"And of course that was true. But I couldn't believe Charles, for all he
  hated me so, would do this to Martin. There were two of us, and Kenwood and a
  nice Scotch woman I found at Nanking, a Miss Mackenzie, who agreed to come
  along to look after me in event of my needing it. There were twenty of us in
  all&mdash;the others Chinese boys, thoroughly good, thoroughly dependable. We
  came North slowly, unhurriedly. I said that Martin was a boy inside. No need
  to tell you again of his affection for you. And he loved China&mdash; the old
  China. He said it lived now only in a few places, and Yunnan was first. And
  he had it in his mind that our baby should be born&mdash; here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She sat silent, then laughed. "And so it will be. But not as Martin
  dreamed... " She was silent again. She said, as though faintly puzzled: "It
  was not&mdash;human&mdash;to laugh at that!" She went on serenely: "We came
  on and on slowly. Sampans on the rivers, and I by litter mostly. Always
  easily, easily... because of the baby. Then two weeks ago Kenwood told me
  that he had word we were to be attacked at a certain place. He had been years
  in China, knew how to get information and I knew he had watched and cajoled
  and threatened and bribed ever since we had entered the hills. He said he,
  had arranged a counterattack that would catch the trappers in their own trap.
  He cursed Charles dreadfully, saying he was behind it. He said that if we
  could only get to Yu Ch'ien we would be safe. Afterwards he told me that he
  must have been sold wrong information. The counterattack had drawn blank. I
  told him he was letting his imagination run away with him.</p>

  <p>"We went on. Then came the ambush. It wasn't a matter of ransom. It was a
  matter of wiping us out.</p>

  <p>"They gave us no chance. So it must have been that we were worth more to
  them dead than alive. That realization came to me as I stood at the door of
  my tent and saw Martin cut down, poor Mackenzie fall. Kenwood could have
  escaped as I did&mdash;but he died to give me time to get away..."</p>

  <p>"Yu Ch'ien, what have you done to me?" asked Jean Meredith, dreamily. "I
  have seen my husband butchered... I have seen a man give up his life for
  me... and still I feel no more emotion than as though they had been reeds
  under the sickle... what have you done to me, Yu Ch'ien?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "Daughter&mdash;when you are dead, and all those now living
  are dead&mdash;will it matter?"</p>

  <p>She answered, shaking her head: "But&mdash;I am not dead! Nor are those
  now living dead. And I should rather be human, Yu Ch'ien. And suffer."</p>

  <p>He said: "It may not be, my daughter."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could feel," she said. "Good God, but I wish I could feel "</p>

  <p>She said: "That is all. Kenwood threw himself in front of me. I ran. I
  came to wide steps. I climbed them&mdash;up and up. I saw a fox&mdash;I saw a
  woman where I had seen the fox&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He said: "You saw a Tibetan, a half-caste, who threw himself upon those
  who followed you, howling like a mad dog. You saw that Tibetan cut down by
  the knives of his men. I came with my men before he died. We brought him
  here. I searched his dying mind. He told me that they had been hired to wipe
  out your party by a Shensi leader of hung-hutzes. And that he had been
  promised not only the loot of your party if all were slain, but a thousand
  taels besides. And that when he asked who guaranteed this sum, this leader,
  in his cups, had told him the Captain Li-kong."</p>

  <p>She cupped her chin in hand, looked out over the blue pool to the pagoda.
  She said at last: "So Kenwood was right! And I am right. It was
  Charles..."</p>

  <p>She said: "I feel a little, Yu Ch'ien. But what I feel is not pleasant. It
  is hate, Yu Ch'ien "</p>

  <p>She said: "I am only twenty-four. It is rather young to die, Yu Ch'ien,
  isn't it? But then&mdash;what was it your woman's voice said while I was in
  the darkness? That the self of mine whom I would pity died when Martin did?
  She was right, Yu Ch'ien&mdash;or you were. And I think I will not be sorry
  to join that other self."</p>

  <p>The sun was sinking. An amethyst veil dropped over the conical mountains.
  Suddenly they seemed to flatten, to become transparent. The whole valley
  between the peaks grew luminously crystalline. The blue pagoda shone as
  though made of dark sapphires behind which little suns burned. She sighed:
  "It is very beautiful, Yu Ch'ien. I am glad to be here&mdash;until I
  die."</p>

  <p>There was a patter of feet beside her. A fox came trotting down one of the
  carven runways. It looked up at her fearlessly with glowing green eyes.
  Another slipped from the cover of the pool and another and another. They
  lapped the blue water fearlessly, eyes glinting swift side-glances at her,
  curiously...</p>

  <p>The days slipped by her, the weeks&mdash;a month. Each day she sat in the
  seat of the foxes beside the pool, watching the willows trail their tendrils,
  the lilies like great rosy pearls open and close and die and be reborn on the
  pool's blue breast; watching the crystalline green dusks ensorcell the
  conical peaks, and watching the foxes that came when these dusks fell.</p>

  <p>They were friendly now, the foxes&mdash;knew her, sat beside her, studying
  her; but never did she see the lithe fox with the lock of white between its
  slanting green eyes. She grew to know the brown woman Fien-wi and the sturdy
  servitors. And from the scattered villages pilgrims came to the shrine; they
  looked at her fearfully, shyly; as she sat on the seat of the foxes,
  prostrating themselves before her as though she were some spirit to be
  placated by worship.</p>

  <p>And each day was as the day before, and she thought: Without sorrow,
  without fear, without gladness, without hope there is no difference between
  the days, and therefore what difference does it make if I die tomorrow or a
  year hence?</p>

  <p>Whatever the anodyne that steeped her soul&mdash;whether from vague woman
  of the steps or from Yu Ch'ien&mdash;it had left her with no emotion. Except
  that she knew she must bear it, she had no feeling even toward her unborn
  baby. Once, indeed, she had felt a faint curiosity. That this wise priest of
  the Foxes' Temple had his own means of learning what he desired of the outer
  world, she was well aware.</p>

  <p>She said: "Does Charles know as yet of the ambush&mdash;know that I am
  still alive?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "Not yet. The messengers who were sent to Li-kong did not
  reach him. It will be weeks before he knows."</p>

  <p>She said: "And then he will come here. Will the baby be born when he
  comes, Yu Ch'ien?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "Yes."</p>

  <p>"And shall I be alive, Yu Ch'ien?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer. She laughed.</p>

  <p>It was one twilight, in the middle of the Hour of the Dog, that she turned
  to him, sitting in the garden beside the pool.</p>

  <p>"My time has come, Yu Ch'ien. The child stirs."</p>

  <p>They carried her into the temple. She lay upon the bed, while the brown
  woman stooped over her, ministering to her, helping her. The only light in
  the temple chamber came from five ancient lanterns of milky jade through
  whose thin sides the candles gleamed, turning them into five small moons. She
  felt little pain. She thought: I owe that to Yu Ch'ien, I suppose. And the
  minutes fled by until it was the Hour of the Boar.</p>

  <p>She heard a scratching at the temple door. The priest opened it. He spoke
  softly, one word, a word often on his lips, and she knew it meant "patience."
  She could see through the opened door into the garden. There were small
  globular green lights all about, dozens of them, like gnome lanterns.</p>

  <p>She said drowsily: "My little foxes wait. Let them enter, Yu Ch'ien."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, my daughter."</p>

  <p>The Hour of the Boar passed. Midnight passed. There was a great silence in
  the temple. It seemed to her that all the temple was waiting, that even the
  unfaltering light of the five small moons on the altar was waiting. She
  thought: Even the child is waiting... and for what?</p>

  <p>And suddenly a swift agony shook her and she cried out. The brown woman
  held tight her hands that tried to beat the air. The priest called, and into
  the room came four of the sturdy servants of the temple. They carried large
  vessels in which was water steaming hot and water which did not steam and so,
  she reasoned idly, must be cold. They kept their backs to her, eyes
  averted.</p>

  <p>The priest touched her eyes, stroked her flanks, and the agony was gone as
  swiftly as it had come. She watched the servants pour the waters into the
  ancient Tang font and slip away, backs still turned to her, faces
  averted.</p>

  <p>She had not seen the door open, but there was a fox in the room. It was
  ghostly in the dim light of the jade lamps, yet she could see it stepping
  daintily toward her... a vixen, lithe and graceful as a woman... with slanted
  eyes, sea-green, brilliant as jewels... the fox of the steps whom she had
  called sister...</p>

  <p>And now she was looking up into a woman's face. An exquisite face with
  sea-green, slanted eyes under a broad white brow, whose hair of russet-red
  came to a small peak in the center of that brow, and above the peak a lock of
  silvery white... the eyes gazed into hers, and although they caressed her,
  there was in them a faint mockery, a delicate malice.</p>

  <p>The woman was naked. Although Jean Meredith could not wrest her own eyes
  from the slanting green ones, she could see the curve of delicate shoulders,
  the rounded breasts, the slender hips. It was as though the woman stood
  poised upon her own breasts, without weight, upon airy feet. There was a
  curious tingling coolness in her breasts... more pleasant than warmth... and
  it was as though the woman were sinking into her, becoming a part of her. The
  face came nearer... nearer... the eyes were now close to hers, and mockery
  and malice gone from them... in them was only gentleness and promise... she
  felt cool lips touch hers...</p>

  <p>The face was gone. She was sinking, sinking, unresistingly...
  gratefully... through a luminous grayness... then into a soft blind
  darkness... she was being cradled by it, sinking ever deeper and deeper. She
  cried out once, as though frightened: Martin! Then she cried again, voice
  vibrant with joy: Martin!</p>

  <p>One of the five moon lamps upon the jade altar darkened. Went out.</p>

  <p>The brown woman was prostrate upon her face beside the bed. The priest
  touched her with his foot. He said: "Prepare. Be swift." She bent over the
  still body.</p>

  <p>There was a movement beside the altar. Four foxes stepped daintily from
  its shadows toward the Tang front. They were vixens, and they came like
  graceful women, and the coat of each was silken russet-red, their eyes
  brilliant, sea-green and slanting, and upon each forehead was a lock of
  silvery white. They drew near the brown woman, watching her.</p>

  <p>The priest walked to the doors and threw them open. Into the temple
  slipped fox after fox... a score, two score... the temple filled with them.
  They ringed the ancient font, squatting, red tongues lolling, eyes upon the
  bed.</p>

  <p>The priest walked to the bed. In his hand was a curiously shaped, slender
  knife of bronze, double-edged, sharp as a surgeon's knife. The brown woman
  threw herself again upon the floor. The priest leaned over the bed, began
  with a surgeon's deftness and delicacy to cut. The four vixens drew close,
  watching every movement&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suddenly there wailed through the temple the querulous crying of a new-
  born child.</p>

  <p>The priest walked from the bed toward the font He held the child in his
  hands, and hands and child were red with blood. The vixens walked beside him.
  The foxes made way for them, closing their circles as they passed. The four
  vixens halted, one at each of the font's four sides. They did not sit. They
  stood with gaze fastened upon the priest.</p>

  <p>The priest ringed the font, bending before each of the four vixens,
  holding out the child until each had touched it with her tongue. He lifted
  the child by the feet, held it dangling head down, high above his head,
  turning so that all the other foxes could see it.</p>

  <p>He plunged it five times into the water of the font.</p>

  <p>As abruptly as the first moon lantern had gone out, so darkened the other
  four.</p>

  <p>There was a rustling, the soft patter of many pads. Then silence.</p>

  <p>Yu Ch'ien called. There was the gleam of lanterns borne by the servants.
  The brown woman raised herself from the floor. He placed the child in her
  hands. He said: "It is finished&mdash;and it is begun. Care for her."</p>

  <p>Thus was born the daughter of Jean and Martin Meredith in the ancient
  Temple of the Foxes. Born in the heart of the Hour of the Fox, so called in
  those parts of China where the ancient beliefs still live because it is at
  the opposite pole of the Hour of the Horse, which animal at certain times and
  at certain places, has a magic against which the magic of the Fox may not
  prevail.</p><br>

 <h3><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a></h3>

  <p class="first">The Home of Heavenly Anticipations honored with its presence
  Peking, not yet at that time renamed Peiping. It was hidden in the heart of
  the Old City. The anticipations discussed there were usually the reverse of
  heavenly &mdash;or, if not, then dealing with highly unorthodox realms of
  beatitude.</p>

  <p>But except for its patrons none ever knew what went on within its walls.
  There was never any leakage of secrets through those walls. Peculiarly,
  ultimate information could be obtained at the Home of Heavenly Anticipations
  &mdash;so long as it did not pertain to its patrons.</p>

  <p>It was, in fact, a clearing house for enterprises looked upon with a
  certain amount of disfavor even by many uncivilized countries: enterprises
  such as blackmail, larceny on the grand scale, smuggling, escapes, piracies,
  removal of obstacles by assassination and so on. Its abbots collected rich
  tithes from each successful operation in return for absolute protection from
  interruption, eavesdropping and spies, and for the expert and thoroughly
  trustworthy advices upon any point of any enterprise which needed to be
  cleared up before action.</p>

  <p>Prospective members of the most exclusive of London's clubs were never
  scanned with such completeness as were applicants for the right to enter the
  Home of Heavenly Anticipations&mdash;and one had to be a rather complete
  scoundrel to win that right. But to those who sought such benefits as it
  offered, they were worth all the difficulty in securing them.</p>

  <p>Charles Meredith sat in one of its rooms, three weeks to a night from the
  birth of Jean Meredith's baby. He was not a member, but it was the privilege
  of accredited patrons to entertain guests to whom secrecy was as desirable as
  to themselves&mdash;or who might prove refractory.</p>

  <p>It was a doubtful privilege for these guests, although they were not aware
  of it, because it was always quite possible that they might never appear
  again in their usual haunts. In such event it was almost impossible to trace
  them back to the Home of Heavenly Anticipations. Always, on their way to it,
  they had been directed to leave their vehicle, coolie-carriage or what not at
  a certain point and to wait until another picked them up. Beyond that point
  they were never traced. Or if their bodies were later found, it was always
  under such circumstances that no one could point a finger at the Home of
  Heavenly Anticipations, which was as expert on alibis for corpses as for
  crooks.</p>

  <p>Although he knew nothing of this, Charles Meredith was uneasy. For one
  thing, he had a considerable sum of money in his pocket&mdash;a very
  considerable sum. To be explicit, fifty thousand dollars. For another thing,
  he had not the slightest idea of where he was.</p>

  <p>He had dismissed his hotel coolie at a designated point, had been
  approached by another who gave the proper word of recognition, had been
  whisked through street after street, then through a narrow alley, then
  through a door opening into a winding passage, thence into a plain reception
  hall where a bowing Chinese had met him and led him to the room. He had seen
  no one, and he heard no sound. Under the circumstances, he appreciated
  privacy&mdash;but damn it, there was a limit! And where was Li-kong?</p>

  <p>He got up and walked about nervously. It gave him some satisfaction to
  feel the automatic holstered under his left arm-pit. He was tall, rather
  rangy and his shoulders stooped a little. He had clear eyes whose grey stood
  out a bit startlingly from his dark face; a good forehead, a somewhat
  predatory beaked nose; his worst feature, his mouth, which hinted
  self-indulgence and cruelty. Seemingly an alert, capable American man of
  affairs, not at all one who would connive at the murder of his own
  brother.</p>

  <p>He turned at the opening of the door. Li-kong came in. Li-kong was a
  graduate of an American college. His father had cherished hopes of a high
  diplomatic career, with his American training as part of its foundation. He
  had repaid it by learning in exhaustive detail the worst of American life.
  This, grafted to his natural qualifications, had given him high place in the
  Home of Heavenly Anticipations and among its patrons.</p>

  <p>He was in the most formal of English evening dress, looked completely the
  person his father had hoped he would be instead of what he actually was
  &mdash;without principles, morals, mercy or compunction whatever.</p>

  <p>Meredith's nervousness found vent in an irritable, "You've been a hell of
  a long time getting here, Li-kong!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Chinese flickered, but he answered urbanely: "Bad news
  flies fast. Good news is slow. I am neither early nor late."</p>

  <p>Meredith asked suspiciously: "What the hell do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>Li-kong said, eyes watchful: "Your honorable elder brother has ascended
  the dragon."</p>

  <p>Meredith's grey eyes glittered. The cruelty stood out on his mouth,
  unmasked. Li-kong said before he could speak: "All with him, even his
  unworthy servants, ascended at the same time. All except&mdash;" He
  paused.</p>

  <p>Meredith's body tightened, his head thrust forward. He asked in a thin
  voice: "Except?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Chinese never left him. He said:</p>

  <p>"When you rebuked me a moment ago for slowness, I answered that I was
  neither early nor late. I must therefore bear good news and bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The American interrupted: "Damn you, Li-kong, who got away?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese answered: "Your brother's wife."</p>

  <p>Meredith's face whitened, then blackened with fury. He whispered:
  "Christ!"</p>

  <p>He roared: "So you bungled it!" His hand twitched up to the gun under his
  arm-pit, then dropped. He asked: "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese must have seen that betraying movement, but he gave no sign.
  He answered: "She fled to the Temple of the Foxes&mdash;to your brother's old
  friend, the priest Yu Ch'ien."</p>

  <p>The other snarled: "What were your bunglers about, to let her go? Why
  didn't they go after her?"</p>

  <p>"They did go after her! Of what happened thereafter, you shall hear
  &mdash;when you have paid me my money, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Paid you!" Meredith's fury mastered him at this. "With the bitch alive?
  I'll see you in hell before you get a cent from me."</p>

  <p>The Chinese said calmly: "But since then she has also ascended the dragon
  in the footsteps of her lord. She died in childbirth."</p>

  <p>"They both are dead&mdash;" Meredith sank into the chair, trembling like
  one from whom tremendous strain has lifted. "Both dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Chinese watched him, malicious anticipation in his eyes. "But the
  child&mdash;lived!" he said.</p>

  <p>For a long minute the American sat motionless, looking at him. And now he
  did not lose control. He said coldly: "So you have been playing with me, have
  you? Well, now listen to me&mdash;you get nothing until the child has
  followed its father and mother. Nothing! And if it is in your mind to
  blackmail me, remember you can bring no charge against me without sending
  yourself to the executioner. Think over that, you leering yellow ape!"</p>

  <p>The Chinese lighted a cigarette. He said mildly:</p>

  <p>"Your brother is dead, according to plan. His wife is dead through that
  same plan, even though she did not die when the others did. There was nothing
  in the bargain concerning the child. And I do not think you could reach the
  child without me." He smiled. "Is it not said, of two brothers, he who thinks
  himself the invulnerable one&mdash;that is the fool?"</p>

  <p>Meredith said nothing, eyes bleak on him. Li-kong went on: "Also, I have
  information to impart, advice to give&mdash;necessary to you if you determine
  to go for the child. As you must&mdash;if you want her. And finally&mdash;is
  it not written in the I-Ging, the Book of Changes, that a man's mind should
  have many entrances but only one exit! In this house the saying is reversed.
  It has only one entrance but many exits&mdash;and the door-keeper of each one
  of them is death."</p>

  <p>Again he paused, then said: "Think over that, you welching white brother-
  killer!"</p>

  <p>The American quivered. He sprang up, reaching for his gun. Strong hands
  grasped his elbows, held him helpless. Li-kong sauntered to him, drew out the
  automatic, thrust it into his own pocket. The hands released Meredith. He
  looked behind him. Two Chinese stood there. One held a crimson bow-string,
  the other a double-edged short-sword.</p>

  <p>"Two of the deaths that guard the exits." Li-kong's voice was courtesy
  itself. "You may have your choice. I recommend the sword&mdash;it is
  swifter."</p>

  <p>Ruthless Meredith was, and no coward, but he recognized here a
  ruthlessness complete as his own. "You win," he said. "I'll pay."</p>

  <p>"And now," smiled Li-kong.</p>

  <p>Meredith drew out the bundle of notes and passed them to him. The Chinese
  counted them and nodded. He spoke to the two executioners and they withdrew.
  He said very seriously: "My friend, it is well for you I recognize that
  insults by a younger people have not the same force that they would have if
  spoken by one of my own race, so much older than yours. In the I-Ging it is
  written that we must not be confused by similitude, that the superior man
  places not the same value upon the words of a child as he does upon those of
  a grown man, although the words be identical. It is well also for you that I
  feel a certain obligation. Not personally, but because an unconsidered factor
  has caused a seed sown in this house to bring forth a deformed blossom. It
  is," continued Li-kong, still very seriously, "a reflection upon its
  honor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He smiled at that, and said, "Or rather, its efficiency. I suggest,
  therefore, that we discuss the matter without heat or further recrimination
  of any kind."</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "I am sorry I said what I did, Li-kong. It was childish
  temper. I apologize."</p>

  <p>The Chinese bowed, but he did not take the hand the other extended. Nor
  did he recall his own words.</p>

  <p>He said: "The child is at the Temple of the Foxes. In Kansu, it is an
  extremely sacred shrine. She is in charge of Yu Ch'ien, who is not only wise
  but powerful, and in addition was your honorable late brother's devoted
  friend. If Yu Ch'ien suspects, then you will have great difficulty in adding
  to your brother's and your sister-in-law's happiness in Heaven by restoring
  to them their daughter. You may assume that Yu Ch'ien does suspect&mdash; and
  knows."</p>

  <p>Meredith asked incredulously: "Why should he suspect? How could he
  know?"</p>

  <p>Li-kong tapped his cigarette thoughtfully before he answered: "The priest
  is very wise. Also, like myself, he has had the advantage of contact with
  your admirable civilization. The woman was with him for weeks, and so he must
  know who would benefit by the&mdash;ah, expungement of your revered
  relatives. He might think it highly suspicious that those responsible for the
  regrettable affair did not pursue the custom of holding the principals for
  ransom instead of&mdash;ah, expunging them on the spot. Naturally, he would
  ask himself why. Finally, Yu Ch'ien is locally reported to have sources of
  information not open to other men&mdash;I mean living men. The dead,"
  observed Li-kong sardonically, "of course know everything."</p>

  <p>Meredith said contemptuously: "What do you mean? Spiritism, divination
  &mdash;that rot?"</p>

  <p>Li-kong considered pensively, answered at last: "No&mdash;not exactly
  that. Something closer, rather to the classical idea of communion with
  elemental intelligences, nature spirits, creatures surviving from an older
  world than man's&mdash;but still of earth. Something like the spirits that
  answered from the oaks of Dodona, or that spoke to the Sibyl in the grotto of
  Cumae, or in more modern times appeared in, and instructed Joan of Arc from,
  the branches of the arbre-f&eacute;e, the fairy tree of Domremy."</p>

  <p>Meredith laughed. "Good God! And this&mdash;from you!"</p>

  <p>Li-kong said imperturbably: "This from me! I am&mdash;what I am. I believe
  in nothing. Yet I tell you that I would not go up those steps to the Temple
  of the Foxes for all the gold you could give me. Not&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: He is trying to frighten me. The yellow dog is trying to
  keep me from the temple. Why? He spoke only the last word of the thought:
  "Why?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese answered: "China is old. The ancient beliefs are still strong.
  There are, for example, the legends of the fox women. The fox women are
  nature spirits. Intelligences earthy but not human&mdash;akin to those in
  Dodona's oaks, Cumae's grotto, Joan of Arc's fairy tree. Believed in&mdash;
  especially in Kansu. These&mdash;let us say spirits&mdash;have certain powers
  far exceeding the human. Bear with me while I tell you of a few of these
  powers. They can assume two earthly shapes only&mdash;that of a fox and that
  of a beautiful woman. There are fox men, too, but the weight of the legends
  are upon the women. Since for them time does not exist, they are mistresses
  of time. To those who come under their power, they can cause a day to seem
  like a thousand years, or a thousand years like a day. They can open the
  doors to other worlds&mdash;worlds of terror, worlds of delight. If such
  worlds are illusions, they do not seem so to those for whom they are opened.
  The fox women can make or mar journeys."</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: Come, now we're getting down to it.</p>

  <p>The Chinese went quietly on: "They can create other illusions. Phantoms,
  perhaps&mdash;but if so, phantoms whose blows maim or kill. They are
  capricious, bestowing good fortune or ill regardless of the virtue or the
  lack of it of the recipient. They are peculiarly favorable to women with
  child. They can, by invitation, enter a woman, passing through her breasts or
  beneath her finger nails. They can enter an unborn child, or rather a child
  about to be born. In such cases, the mother dies&mdash;nor is the manner of
  birth the normal one. They cannot oust the soul of the child, but they can
  dwell beside it, influencing it. Quaint fancies, my friend, in none of which
  I have belief. Yet because of them nothing could induce me to climb the steps
  to the Temple of the foxes."</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: He's trying to frighten me away! What the hell does he
  think I am&mdash;to be frightened by such superstitious drivel? He said, in
  that thin voice with which he spoke when temper was mastering him:</p>

  <p>"What's your game, Li-kong? Another double-cross? You're trying to tell me
  that if I were you, I wouldn't go to the temple for the brat. Why?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese said: "My friend, I have played the game with you. I do not
  say that if I were you, I would not go. I say that if you were I, you would
  not. A quite different thing."</p>

  <p>The other swung clenched fist down upon the table. "Don't tell me you
  expect me to take seriously that farrago of nonsense! You don't expect me to
  give up now because of a yellow&mdash;" He checked himself abruptly.</p>

  <p>The Chinese completed the sentence politely: "Because of a yellow man's
  superstition! No, but let me point out a few rather disquieting things. The
  Temple of the Foxes is believed to be the home of five of these fox women.
  Five&mdash;spirits&mdash;who are sisters. Three messengers were sent me with
  the news of the ambush. The first should have reached me within three weeks
  after it happened. He has vanished. The second was despatched with other news
  a week later. He too vanished. But the third, bearing the news of the death
  of your brother's wife, the birth of the child, came as on the wings of the
  wind. Why the failure of the first two? Because someone desired to keep you
  in ignorance until after that birth? Who?</p>

  <p>"Again, no word has come from Kansu, except by this messenger, of the
  attack on your brother's party. This, my friend, places you in a dilemma. You
  cannot betray your knowledge of his death without subjecting yourself to
  questioning as to how that knowledge came to you. You cannot, therefore, send
  for the child. You must yourself go&mdash;upon some pretext. I think that
  whoever sped the third messenger on his way intends that you shall go&mdash;
  yourself. Why?"</p>

  <p>Meredith struck the table again. "I'll go!"</p>

  <p>"Third," continued Li-kong, "my messenger said that the woman who fled ran
  up the steps of the Temple of the Foxes. And that when they were almost upon
  her&mdash;a fox stood between her and them. And that fox changed into a woman
  who changed their leader into a mad dog. At which&mdash;they ran. So I
  think," said Li-kong meditatively, "would I have run!"</p>

  <p>Meredith said nothing, but his hand beat steadily on the table and the
  grey eyes were furious.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking," said the Chinese, "'The yellow dogs! Of course they
  would run! Filled with rum or opium! Of course!'"</p>

  <p>It was precisely what he had been thinking, but Meredith made no
  answer.</p>

  <p>"And finally," said Li-kong, "your brother's wife died when the child was
  born&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because, I suppose, the fox bitch crawled into her!" jeered Meredith, and
  leaning back, whined thin, high-pitched laughter.</p>

  <p>The Chinese lost for a moment his calm, half arose, then dropped back. He
  said patiently: "If you go up the steps&mdash;ride a horse. Preferably an
  English horse that has hunted foxes."</p>

  <p>He lighted another cigarette. "But that is superstition. Nevertheless, if
  you go, take two men with you as free from taint&mdash;as you are. I know two
  such men. One is a German, the other French. Bold men and hard men. Travel
  alone, the three of you, as far as you can. At all times keep as few Chinese
  with you as possible. When you go to the temple, go up the steps alone. Take
  no Chinese with you there." He said gravely: "I vouch for these two men.
  Better still, the Home of Heavenly Anticipations vouches for them. They will
  want money, of course."</p>

  <p>Meredith asked: "How much?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. They're not cheap. Probably five thousand dollars at
  most."</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: Here's what he's been leading up to. It's a trap!</p>

  <p>Again it was as though Li-kong had read his thoughts. He said very
  deliberately: "Meredith, listen to me! I want nothing more from you nor
  through you. I have not spoken to these men. They do not know, nor will they
  know from me, anything of that transaction for which you have just paid. I am
  through with it. I am through with you! I do not like you. I hope never to
  see you again. Is that plain American talk?"</p>

  <p>Meredith said, as deliberately: "I like it. Go on."</p>

  <p>"All that they need know is that you are anxious about your brother. When
  in due time during your journey you discover that he and his wife are dead,
  and that there is a child, you will naturally want to bring that child back
  with you. If you are denied the child, and killing is necessary, they will
  kill. That is all. I will put you in touch with these two men. And I will see
  to it that none with whom I have relations embarrass you on your way to
  Kansu, nor on your way back&mdash;if you come back. Except for that
  obligation of which I have spoken, I would not do even this. I would not lift
  a finger to help you. After you leave this house, you shall be to me as
  though you never had been. I want nothing to do with Yu Ch'ien and those who
  go to the Temple of the Foxes. If we should meet again&mdash;never speak to
  me! Do not show you have known me! Never speak to me, never write to me, do
  not think of me. I am through with you! Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Meredith nodded, smiling. He thought: I was wrong about him wanting to
  keep me from the place. The yellow rat is frightened... he believes in his
  own bogies! America and everything else couldn't knock the superstition out
  of him!</p>

  <p>The thought amused him. It gave him a contemptuous tolerance of Li-kong, a
  pleasant knowledge of superiority. He said, not bothering to keep the
  contempt from his voice: "Clearer than you know, Li-kong. Where do I meet
  your friends?"</p>

  <p>"They can be at your hotel at one, if it suits you."</p>

  <p>"It suits me. Their names?"</p>

  <p>"They will tell you. They will bear credentials from me."</p>

  <p>Li-kong arose. He stood beside the door, bowing courteously. Meredith
  passed through. They went along another passage and through a winding alley
  out into a street. It was not the same street from which he had entered. Nor
  did he recognize it. A coolie-car waited. Li-kong bowed him into it.</p>

  <p>"May our shadows never touch again," said Li-kong ceremoniously. He added,
  for the first time menacingly: "For your health."</p>

  <p>He turned and passed into the alley. The coolie broke into a swift trot,
  and away.</p><br>

 <h3><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER 4</a></h3>

  <p class="first">It was mid-afternoon a month later that he rode out of the
  green glen and looked up the first steep flight of the ancient steps to the
  Temple of the Foxes. Riding beside him were von Brenner and Lascelles, the
  two bold and hard men Li-kong had recommended. They were all of that, but
  they were also discreet men. They had accepted without comment his
  explanation of seeking news of his brother, had been properly sympathetic and
  had asked him no embarrassing questions. Both could speak the Mandarin as
  well as several of the dialects. Lascelles knew Kansu, was even familiar with
  the locality in which was the Temple of the Foxes.</p>

  <p>Meredith had thought it wise to make inquiries at various places through
  which he knew Martin had passed, and here the German and the Frenchman acted
  as his interpreters. When they reported that at these points his brother's
  party had been in excellent health, they did so with every outward evidence
  of belief that such tidings were welcome to him.</p>

  <p>Either they were excellent actors or Li-kong had kept faith with him and
  told them nothing beyond what had been agreed. Confidence in the second
  possibility however had been somewhat disturbed shortly after entering Kansu.
  The Frenchman had said he thought, somewhat too casually, that if it was
  desirable to get to the temple without passing through any village within a
  day's march, he knew a way. He added that while undoubtedly the temple's
  priest would know they were coming, he would expect them to follow the usual
  route. Therefore, he could possibly be taken by surprise.</p>

  <p>Meredith smelled a trap. To accept the suggestion was to admit that the
  temple had been the real object of his journey, the reason he had given a
  subterfuge, and the anxious inquiries he had made along the line of march a
  blind. He answered sharply that there was no reason for any surprise visit,
  that the priest Yu Ch'ien, a venerable scholar, was an old friend of his
  brother, and that if the party had reached him there was no further cause for
  anxiety. Why did Lascelles think he desired any secrecy in his search? The
  Frenchman replied politely that if he had known of such friendship the
  thought would not have occurred to him, of course.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Meredith felt no more fear of Yu Ch'ien than he did
  of Li-kong's fox woman. Whenever he thought of how the Chinese had tried to
  impress him with that yellow Mother Goose yarn, he felt a contemptuous
  amusement that more than compensated him for the humiliation of having been
  forced to pay the blood money. He had often listened to Martin extol Yu
  Ch'ien's wisdom and virtues, but that only proved what a complete impractical
  ass Martin had been... gone senile prematurely, in brain at least... that was
  plain enough when he married that gold-digger young enough to be his
  daughter... no longer the brother he had known... who could tell what he
  might have done next... some senility which would have brought ruin to them
  all... a senile crazy brain in Martin's still sound body, that was all... if
  Martin had been suffering from some agonizing and incurable disease and had
  asked him to put him out of his misery, he would certainly have done so...
  well, what was the difference between that and what he had done? That the
  girl and her brat should also have to suffer was too bad... but it had been
  made necessary by Martin's own senility.</p>

  <p>Thus he justified himself. At the same time there was no reason why he
  should take these two men into his confidence.</p>

  <p>What he should do with the brat when he had it was not quite clear. It was
  only two months old&mdash;and it was a long journey back to Peking. There
  must be some woman taking care of it at the temple. He would arrange that she
  go with them to Peking. If some accident happened, or if the child caught
  something or other on the way back&mdash;that would not be his fault. Her
  proper place, obviously, was with her father's family. Not in a heathen
  temple back of nowhere in China. Nobody could blame him for wanting to bring
  her back... even if anything did happen to her.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, not so good. He would have to take back proof that
  this child was theirs. Proof of birth. It would be better to bring her alive
  to Peking... even better, it might be, if it lived until he had taken it back
  to the States and the whole matter of trusteeship and guardianship had been
  legally adjusted. There was plenty of time. And he would have his
  half-million, and the increased percentage from the estate to tide him over
  the gap between now and until&mdash;something happened, and the whole estate
  would be his. He thought callously: Well, the brat is insured as far as
  Peking at any rate.</p>

  <p>They had passed through a village that morning. The headman had met them,
  and in answer to the usual questioning, had given a complete account of the
  massacre, of Jean's escape, of her death later at the temple and of the
  child's birth. It was so complete, even to the dates, that he felt a stirring
  of faint suspicion. It was a little as though the story had been drilled into
  this man. And now and then he would call this one or that among the villagers
  for corroboration. But Charles had shown the proper shades of grief, and
  desire to punish the killers. And Brenner and Lascelles had exerted
  themselves to comfort him in orthodox fashion.</p>

  <p>He had said at last: "The first thing to do is get the baby safely back to
  Peking. I can get capable white nurses there. I'll have to find a woman here
  to look after it until we reach Peking. I want to get the child to the States
  and in my wife's care as soon as I can. And I want to start the machinery
  going to punish my brother's murderers&mdash;although I realize that's a
  forlorn hope."</p>

  <p>They had agreed with him that it was most desirable to get the child to
  his wife in quickest possible time, and that hope of punishing the killers
  was indeed a forlorn one.</p>

  <p>And now he stood looking up the ancient steps at whose end was the child.
  He said: "You couldn't ride a horse up that, unless it was a circus horse.
  And these are not."</p>

  <p>Lascelles smiled. "It is impossible to ride to the temple. There are
  steeper flights than this. And there is no trail or other road. We must
  walk."</p>

  <p>Meredith said suspiciously: "You seem to know a lot about this place,
  Lascelles. Ever been to the temple?"</p>

  <p>The Frenchman answered: "No, but I have talked to those who have."</p>

  <p>Meredith grinned. "Li-kong told me to take a horse. He said the fox women
  were afraid of it."</p>

  <p>Brenner laughed. "Die Fuchsdamen! I haf always wanted to see one. Joost as
  I always wanted to see one of those bowmen of Mons they haf spoken so highly
  of in the War. Ja! I would like to try a bullet on the bowmen, but I would
  haf other treatment for the fox women. Yah!"</p>

  <p>Lascelles said noncommittally: "It's hard to get some things out of the
  mind of a Chinese."</p>

  <p>Brenner said to Meredith: "There is one question I haf to ask. How far iss
  it that we go in getting this child? Suppose this priest thinks it better you
  do not haf it? How far iss it that we go to persuade him, hein?" He added
  meditatively: "The headman said that there are with the priest three women
  and four men." He said even more meditatively: "The headsman he was very full
  of detail. Yah&mdash;he knew a lot. I do not like that&mdash;quite."</p>

  <p>Lascelles nodded, saying nothing, looking at Meredith interrogatively.</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "I do not see for what reason or upon what grounds Yu
  Ch'ien can deny me the child. I am its uncle, its natural guardian. Its
  father, my brother so designated me in the event of his death. Well, he is
  dead. If the priest refuses to give it up peaceably I would certainly be
  justified in using force to secure it. If the priest were hurt&mdash;we would
  not be to blame. If his men attacked us and were hurt&mdash;we would be
  blameless. One way or another&mdash;I take the child."</p>

  <p>Lascelles said somewhat grimly: "If it comes to fighting, we ride back
  along that way I told you of. We will go through no village within a day's
  journey from here. It will not be healthy for us in Kansu&mdash;the speed at
  which we must go will not be healthy for the child."</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "I am sure we'll have no trouble with Yu Ch'ien."</p>

  <p>They had brought a fourth horse with them, a sturdy beast with wide
  Chinese saddle such as a woman rides. They tethered the four horses and began
  to mount the steps. At first they talked, then their voices seemed to be
  absorbed in the silence, to grow thin. They stopped talking.</p>

  <p>The tall pines watched them as they passed&mdash;the crouching shrubs
  watched them. They saw no one, heard nothing&mdash;but gradually they became
  as watchful as the pines and bushes, alert, hands gripping the butts of their
  pistols as though the touch gave them confidence. They came over the brow of
  the hill and the sweat was streaming from them as it streams from horses
  frightened by something they sense but can neither see nor hear.</p>

  <p>It was as though they had passed out of some peril-haunted jungle into
  safety. They still said nothing to each other, but they straightened, drew
  deep breaths, and their hands fell from their pistols. They looked down upon
  the peacock-tiled roof of the Temple of the Foxes and upon its blue pool of
  peace. A man sat beside it on a stone seat. As they watched him, he arose and
  walked toward the temple. At each side of him went a pair of what seemed
  russet-red dogs. Suddenly they saw that these were not dogs, but foxes.</p>

  <p>They came down over the brow of the hill to the rear of the temple. In its
  brown stone there was no door, only six high windows that seemed to watch
  them come. They saw no one. They skirted the temple and reached its front.
  The man they had seen at the pool stood there, as though awaiting them. The
  foxes were gone.</p>

  <p>The three halted as one, involuntarily. Meredith had expected to see an
  old, old man&mdash;gentle, a little feeble, perhaps. The face he saw was old,
  no doubt of that&mdash;but the eyes were young and prodigiously alive. Large
  and black and liquid, they held his. He was clothed in a symboled robe of
  silvery blue on whose breast in silver was a fox's head.</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: What if he isn't what I expected! He shook his head
  impatiently, as though to get rid of some numbness. He stepped forward, hand
  outstretched. He said: "I am Charles Meredith. You are Yu Ch'ien&mdash;my
  brother's friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The priest said: "I have been expecting you, Charles Meredith. You already
  know what happened. The village headman mercifully took from me the burden of
  delivering to you the first blossom of sorrowful knowledge."</p>

  <p>Meredith thought: How the devil did he know that?</p>

  <p>The village is half a day away. We came swiftly, and no runner could have
  reached here before us.</p>

  <p>The priest had taken his outstretched hand. He did not clasp it palm to
  palm, but held it across the top, thumb pressed to wrist. Meredith felt a
  curious tingling coolness dart from wrist to shoulder. The black eyes were
  looking deep into his, and he felt the same tingling coolness in his brain.
  His hand was released, the gaze withdrawn. He felt as though something had
  been withdrawn from his mind with it.</p>

  <p>"And your friends&mdash;" Yu Ch'ien grasped von Brenner's hand in the same
  way, black eyes searching the German's. He turned to Lascelles. The French
  thrust his hands behind him, avoided the eyes. He bowed and said: "For me, it
  is too great honor, venerable father of wisdom."</p>

  <p>For an instant Yu Ch'ien's gaze rested on him thoughtfully. He spoke to
  Meredith: "Of your brother and your brother's wife there is nothing more to
  be said. They have passed. You shall see the child."</p>

  <p>Meredith answered bluntly: "I came to take her with me, Yu Ch'ien."</p>

  <p>The priest said as though he had not heard: "Come into the temple and you
  shall see her."</p>

  <p>He walked through the time-bitten pillars into the room where Jean
  Meredith had died. They followed him. It was oddly dark within the temple
  chamber. Meredith supposed that it was the transition from the sunny
  brightness. It was as though the chamber was filled with silent, watchful
  brown shadows. There was an altar of green stone on which were five ancient
  lamps of milky jade. They were circular, and in four of them candles burned,
  turning them into four small moons. The priest led them toward this altar.
  Not far from the altar was an immense vessel of bronze, like a baptismal
  font. Between altar and vessel was an old Chinese cradle, and nestled in its
  cushions was a baby. It was a girl child, fast asleep, one little dimpled
  fist doubled up to its mouth. The priest walked to the opposite side of the
  cradle.</p>

  <p>He said softly: "Your brother's daughter, Charles Meredith. Bend over. I
  desire to show you something. Let your friends look too."</p>

  <p>The three bent over the cradle. The priest gently opened the child's
  swathings. Upon its breast, over its heart, was a small scarlet birthmark
  shaped like a candle flame wavering in the wind. Lascelles lifted his hand,
  finger pointing, but before he could speak, the priest had caught his wrist.
  He looked into the Frenchman's eyes. He said sternly: "Do not waken her."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman stared at him for a moment, then said through stiff lips:
  "You devil!"</p>

  <p>The priest dropped his wrist. He said to Meredith, tranquilly: "I show you
  the birthmark so you may know the child when you see her again. It will be
  long, Charles Meredith, before you do see her again."</p>

  <p>A quick rage swept Meredith but before he succumbed to it he found time to
  wonder at its fury. He whispered: "Cover him, von Brenner! Throttle him,
  Lascelles!"</p>

  <p>He bent down to lift the baby from the cradle. He stiffened, hands
  clutching at empty air. The baby and cradle were gone. He looked up. The
  priest was gone.</p>

  <p>Where Yu Ch'ien had stood was a row of archers, a dozen of them. The light
  from the four lanterns shone shadedly upon them. They were in archaic mail,
  black lacquered helmets on their heads; under their visors yellow slanted
  eyes gleamed from impassive faces. Their bows were stretched, strings ready
  to loose, the triangular arrow heads at point like snakes poised to spring.
  He looked at them stupidly. Where had they come from? At the head of the line
  was a giant all of seven feet tall, old, with a face as though made of
  gnarled pear-wood. It was his arrow that pointed to Meredith's heart. The
  others&mdash;</p>

  <p>He sprang back&mdash;back between von Brenner and Lascelles. They stood,
  glaring unbelievingly as he had at that line of bowmen. He saw the German
  lift his pistol, heard him say thickly: "The bowmen of Mons&mdash;" heard
  Lascelles cry: "Drop it, you fool!" Heard the twang of a bow, the hiss of an
  arrow and saw an arrow pierce the German's wrist and saw the pistol fall to
  the temple floor.</p>

  <p>Lascelles cried: "Don't move, Meredith!" The Frenchman's automatic rang
  upon the temple floor.</p>

  <p>He heard a command&mdash;in the voice of Yu Ch'ien. The archers moved
  forward, not touching the three, but menacing them with their arrows. The
  three moved back.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, beneath the altar, in the light of the four lanterns, he saw the
  cradle and the child within it, still asleep.</p>

  <p>And beside the cradle, Yu Ch'ien.</p>

  <p>The priest beckoned him. The line of archers opened as he walked forward.
  Yu Ch'ien looked at him with unfathomable eyes. He said in the same tranquil
  tones, utterly without anger or reproach:</p>

  <p>"I know the truth. You think I could not prove that truth? You are right.
  I could not&mdash;in an earthly court. And you fear no other. But listen
  well&mdash;you have good reason to fear me! Some day your brother's child
  will be sent to you. Until she comes, look after her interests well and try
  in no manner directly or indirectly to injure her. You will have the money
  your brother left you. You will have your interest in her estate. You will
  have at least seven years before she comes. Use those years well, Charles
  Meredith&mdash;it is not impossible that you may build up much merit which
  will mitigate, even if it cannot cancel, your debt of wickedness. But this I
  tell you&mdash;do not try to regain this child before she is sent to you, nor
  attempt to molest her. After she comes to you&mdash;the matter is in other
  hands than mine. Do you understand me, Charles Meredith?"</p>

  <p>He heard himself say: "I understand you. It shall be as you say."</p>

  <p>Yu Ch'ien thrust his hand into his robe, drew out a package. He said:
  "Here are written the circumstances of your brother's death, his wife's death
  and the birth of the child. They are attested by me, and by witnesses of
  mine. I am well known far beyond the limits of this, my temple. My signature
  will be sufficient to prove the authenticity of the statements. I have given
  my reasons why I think it useless to attempt to bring the actual murderers of
  your brother and his party to justice. I have said that their leader was
  caught and executed. He was! My real reason for acting as I am may not be
  known by you. Now pick up those useless weapons of yours&mdash;useless at
  least here&mdash;take these papers and go!"</p>

  <p>Meredith took the documents. He picked up the guns. He turned and walked
  stiffly through the bowmen to where von Brenner and Lascelles stood close to
  the temple doors, under the arrows of the bowmen. They mounted the hill and
  set their feet upon the ancient road.</p>

  <p>Silent, like men half-awake, they passed through the lines of the watchful
  pines and at last into the glen where their horses stood tethered&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was an oath from the German. He was moving the wrist gingerly. And
  suddenly all three were like men who had just awakened. Von Brenner cried:
  "The arrow! I felt it&mdash;I saw it! But there iss no arrow and no mark. And
  my hand iss good as ever."</p>

  <p>Lascelles said very quietly: "There was no arrow, von Brenner. There were
  no bowmen. Nevertheless, let us move from here quickly."</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "But I saw the arrow strike. I saw the archers."</p>

  <p>"When Yu Ch'ien gripped our wrists he gripped our minds," answered
  Lascelles. "If we had not believed in the reality of the bowmen&mdash;we
  would not have seen them. The arrow could not have hurt you, von Brenner. But
  the priest had trapped us. We had to believe in their reality." He untied his
  horse. He turned to Meredith, foot on stirrup: "Did Yu Ch'ien threaten
  you?"</p>

  <p>Meredith answered with a touch of grim humor:</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but he gave me seven years for the threats to take effect."</p>

  <p>Lascelles said: "Good. Then you and I, von Brenner, get back to Peking.
  We'll spend the night at that village of the too well informed headman
  &mdash;go back by the open road. But ride fast."</p>

  <p>He gave the horse his knee and raced away. The other two followed. The
  horse with the wide Chinese saddle placidly watched them go.</p>

  <p>Two hours after dusk they came to the village. The headman was courteous,
  provided them with food and shelter, but no longer was communicative.
  Meredith was quiet. Before they rolled into their blankets he said to
  Lascelles: "When the priest grasped your hand you were about to say something
  &mdash;something about that birthmark on the child's breast. What was
  it?"</p>

  <p>Lascelles said: "I was about to say that it was the Symbol of the fox
  women."</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "Don't tell me you believe in that damned nonsense!"</p>

  <p>Lascelles answered: "I'm not telling you anything, except that the mark
  was the symbol of the fox women."</p>

  <p>Von Brenner said: "I'fe seen some strange things in this damned China and
  elsewhere, Pierre. But neffer an arrow that pierced a man's wrist and hung
  there quivering&mdash;and then was gone. But the wrist dead&mdash;as mine
  wass."</p>

  <p>Lascelles said: "Listen, Franz. This priest is a great man. What he did to
  us I have seen sorcerers, so-called, do to others in Tibet and in India. But
  never with such completeness, such clarity. The archers came from the mind of
  the priest into our minds&mdash;yes, that I know. But I tell you, Franz, that
  if you had believed that arrow had pierced your heart&mdash;your heart would
  not be alive as your wrist is! I tell you again&mdash;he is a great man, that
  priest."</p>

  <p>Meredith said: "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lascelles said: "For Christ's sake, man, is it impossible for you to
  learn!" He rolled himself in his blankets. Went to sleep.</p>

  <p>Meredith lay awake, thinking, for long. He thought;</p>

  <p>Yu Ch'ien doesn't know a damned thing. If he did&mdash;why would he
  promise me the child? He knows he can't prove a thing. He thought: He thinks
  he can frighten me so that when the child comes of age she'll get what's
  coming to her... And he thought: Lascelles is as crazy as Li-kong. Those
  archers were hidden there all the time. They were real, all right. Or, if it
  was a matter of hypnotism, I'd like to see myself believe in them in New
  York! He laughed.</p>

  <p>It was a damned good arrangement, he concluded. Probably the priest
  wouldn't send the brat back to him for ten years. But in the meantime&mdash;
  well, he'd like to see that file of archers in one of the Bronx night clubs!
  It was a good arrangement&mdash;for him. The priest was as senile as
  Martin...</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>All-Story Weekly</i> magazine, January 5, 1918<br>
  Reprinted in <i>Fantastic Novels</i>, Jan 1941</h3><br>

  <p class="first">NORTH of us a shaft of light shot half way to the zenith. It
  came from behind the five peaks. The beam drove up through a column of blue
  haze whose edges were marked as sharply as the rain that streams from the
  edges of a thunder cloud. It was like the flash of a searchlight through an
  azure mist. It cast no shadows.</p>

  <p>As it struck upward the summits were outlined hard and black and I saw
  that the whole mountain was shaped like a hand. As the light silhouetted it,
  the gigantic fingers stretched, the hand seemed to thrust itself forward. It
  was exactly as though it moved to push something back. The shining beam held
  steady for a moment; then broke into myriads of little luminous globes that
  swung to and fro and dropped gently. They seemed to be searching.</p>

  <p>The forest had become very still. Every wood noise held its breath. I felt
  the dogs pressing against my legs. They too were silent; but every muscle in
  their bodies trembled, their hair was stiff along their backs and their eyes,
  fixed on the falling lights, were filmed with the terror glaze.</p>

  <p>I looked at Anderson. He was staring at the North where once more the beam
  had pulsed upward.</p>

  <p>"It can't be the aurora," I spoke without moving my lips. My mouth was as
  dry as though Lao T'zai had poured his fear dust down my throat.</p>

  <p>"If it is I never saw one like it," he answered in the same tone. "Besides
  who ever heard of an aurora at this time of the year?"</p>

  <p>He voiced the thought that was in my own mind.</p>

  <p>"It makes me think something is being hunted up there," he said, "an
  unholy sort of hunt&mdash;it's well for us to be out of range."</p>

  <p>"The mountain seems to move each time the shaft shoots up," I said.
  "What's it keeping back, Starr? It makes me think of the frozen hand of cloud
  that Shan Nadour set before the Gate of Ghouls to keep them in the lairs that
  Eblis cut for them."</p>

  <p>He raised a hand&mdash;listening.</p>

  <p>From the North and high overhead there came a whispering. It was not the
  rustling of the aurora, that rushing, crackling sound like the ghosts of
  winds that blew at Creation racing through the skeleton leaves of ancient
  trees that sheltered Lilith. It was a whispering that held in it a demand. It
  was eager. It called us to come up where the beam was flashing. It drew.
  There was in it a note of inexorable insistence. It touched my heart with a
  thousand tiny fear-tipped fingers and it filled me with a vast longing to
  race on and merge myself in the light. It must have been so that Ulysses felt
  when he strained at the mast and strove to obey the crystal sweet singing of
  the Sirens.</p>

  <p>The whispering grew louder.</p>

  <p>"What the hell's the matter with those dogs?" cried Anderson savagely.
  "Look at them!"</p>

  <p>The malemutes, whining, were racing away toward the light. We saw them
  disappear among the trees. There came back to us a mournful howling. Then
  that too died away and left nothing but the insistent murmuring overhead.</p>

  <p>The glade we had camped in looked straight to the North. We had reached I
  suppose three hundred mile above the first great bend of the Koskokwim toward
  the Yukon. Certainly we were in an untrodden part of the wilderness. We had
  pushed through from Dawson at the breaking of the Spring, on a fair lead to
  the lost five peaks between which, so the Athabascan medicine man had told
  us, the gold streams out like putty from a clenched fist. Not an Indian were
  we able to get to go with us. The land of the Hand Mountain was accursed they
  said. We had sighted the peaks the night before, their tops faintly outlined
  against a pulsing glow. And now we saw the light that had led us to them.</p>

  <p>Anderson stiffened. Through the whispering had broken a curious pad-pad
  and a rustling. It sounded as though a small bear were moving towards us. I
  threw a pile of wood on the fire and, as it blazed up, saw something break
  through the bushes. It walked on all fours, but it did not walk like a bear.
  All at once it flashed upon me&mdash;it was like a baby crawling upstairs.
  The forepaws lifted themselves in grotesquely infantile fashion. It was
  grotesque but it was&mdash;terrible. It grew closer. We reached for our
  guns&mdash;and dropped them. Suddenly we knew that this crawling thing was a
  man!</p>

  <p>It was a man. Still with the high climbing pad-pad he swayed to the fire.
  He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Safe," whispered the crawling man, in a voice that was an echo of the
  murmur overhead. "Quite safe here. They can't get out of the blue, you know.
  They can't get you&mdash;unless you go to them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He fell over on his side. We ran to him. Anderson knelt.</p>

  <p>"God's love!" he said. "Frank, look at this!" He pointed to the hands. The
  wrists were covered with torn rags of a heavy shirt. The hands themselves
  were stumps! The fingers had been bent into the palms and the flesh had been
  worn to the bone. They looked like the feet of a little black elephant! My
  eyes traveled down the body. Around the waist was a heavy band of yellow
  metal. From it fell a ring and a dozen links of shining white chain!</p>

  <p>"What is he? Where did he come from?" said Anderson. "Look, he's fast
  asleep&mdash;yet even in his sleep his arms try to climb and his feet draw
  themselves up one after the other! And his knees&mdash;how in God's name was
  he ever able to move on them?"</p>

  <p>It was even as he said. In the deep sleep that had come upon the crawler
  arms and legs kept raising in a deliberate, dreadful climbing motion. It was
  as though they had a life of their own&mdash;they kept their movement
  independently of the motionless body. They were semaphoric motions. If you
  have ever stood at the back of a train and had watched the semaphores rise
  and fall you will know exactly what I mean.</p>

  <p>Abruptly the overhead whispering ceased. The shaft of light dropped and
  did not rise again. The crawling man became still. A gentle glow began to
  grow around us. It was dawn, and the short Alaskan summer night was over.
  Anderson rubbed his eyes and turned to me a haggard face.</p>

  <p>"Man!" he exclaimed. "You look as though you have been through a spell of
  sickness!"</p>

  <p>"No more than you, Starr," I said. "What do you make of it all?"</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking our only answer lies there," he answered, pointing to the
  figure that lay so motionless under the blankets we had thrown over him.
  "Whatever it was&mdash;that's what it was after. There was no aurora about
  that light, Frank. It was like the flaring up of some queer hell the preacher
  folk never frightened us with."</p>

  <p>"We'll go no further today," I said. "I wouldn't wake him for all the gold
  that runs between the fingers of the five peaks&mdash;nor for all the devils
  that may be behind them."</p>

  <p>The crawling man lay in a sleep as deep as the Styx. We bathed and
  bandaged the pads that had been his hands. Arms and legs were as rigid as
  though they were crutches. He did not move while we worked over him. He lay
  as he had fallen, the arms a trifle raised, the knees bent.</p>

  <p>"Why did he crawl?" whispered Anderson. "Why didn't he walk?"</p>

  <p>I was filing the band about the waist. It was gold, but it was like no
  gold I had ever handled. Pure gold is soft. This was soft, but it had an
  unclean, viscid life of its own. It clung to the file. I gashed through it,
  bent it away from the body and hurled it far off. It was&mdash;
  loathsome!</p>

  <p>All that day he slept. Darkness came and still he slept That night there
  was no shaft of light, no questing globe, no whispering. Some spell of horror
  seemed lifted from the land. It was noon when the crawling man awoke. I
  jumped as the pleasant drawling voice sounded.</p>

  <p>"How long have I slept?" he asked. His pale blue eyes grew quizzical as I
  stared at him. "A night&mdash;and almost two days," I said. "Was there any
  light up there last night?" He nodded to the North eagerly. "Any
  whispering?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," I answered. His head fell back and he stared up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"They've given it up, then?" he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Who have given it up?" asked Anderson.</p>

  <p>"Why, the people of the pit," replied the crawling man quietly.</p>

  <p>We stared at him. "The people of the pit," he said. "Things that the Devil
  made before the Flood and that somehow have escaped God's vengeance. You
  weren't in any danger from them&mdash;unless you had followed their call.
  They can't get any further than the blue haze. I was their prisoner," he
  added simply. "They were trying to whisper me back to them!"</p>

  <p>Anderson and I looked at each other, the same thought in both our
  minds.</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," said the crawling man. "I'm not insane. Give me a very
  little to drink. I'm going to die soon, but I want you to take me as far
  South as you can before I die, and afterwards I want you to build a big fire
  and burn me. I want to be in such shape that no infernal spell of theirs can
  drag my body back to them. You'll do it too, when I've told you about
  them&mdash;" he hesitated. "I think their chain is off me?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I cut it off," I answered shortly.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that too," whispered the crawling man.</p>

  <p>He drank the brandy and water we lifted to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Arms and legs quite dead," he said. "Dead as I'll be soon. Well, they did
  well for me. Now I'll tell you what's up there behind that hand. Hell!"</p>

  <p>"Now listen. My name is Stanton&mdash;Sinclair Stanton. Class 1900, Yale.
  Explorer. I started away from Dawson last year to hunt for five peaks that
  rise like a hand in a haunted country and run pure gold between them. Same
  thing you were after? I thought so. Late last fall my comrade sickened. Sent
  him back with some Indians. Little later all my Indians ran away from me. I
  decided I'd stick, built a cabin, stocked myself with food and lay down to
  winter it. In the Spring I started off again. Little less than two weeks ago
  I sighted the five peaks. Not from this side though&mdash;the other. Give me
  some more brandy.</p>

  <p>"I'd made too wide a detour," he went on. "I'd gotten too far North. I
  beat back. From this side you see nothing but forest straight up to the base
  of the Hand Mountain. Over on the other side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Over there is forest too. But it doesn't reach so far. No! I came out of
  it. Stretching miles in front of me was a level plain. It was as worn and
  ancient looking as the desert around the ruins of Babylon. At its end rose
  the peaks. Between me and them&mdash;far off&mdash;was what looked like a low
  dike of rocks. Then&mdash;I ran across the road!</p>

  <p>"The road!" cried Anderson incredulously.</p>

  <p>"The road," said the crawling man. "A fine smooth Stone road. It ran
  straight on to the mountain. Oh, it was road all right&mdash;and worn as
  though millions and millions of feet had passed over it for thousands of
  years. On each side of it were sand and heaps of stones. After while I began
  to notice these stones. They were cut, and the shape of the heaps somehow
  gave me the idea that a hundred thousand years ago they might have been
  houses. I sensed man about them and at the same time they smelled of
  immemorial antiquity. Well&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The peaks grew closer. The heaps of ruins thicker. Something
  inexpressibly desolate hovered over them; something reached from them that
  struck my heart like the touch of ghosts so old that they could be only the
  ghosts of ghosts. I went on.</p>

  <p>"And now I saw that what I had thought to be the low rock range at the
  base of the peaks was a thicker litter of ruins. The Hand Mountain was really
  much farther off. The road passed between two high rocks that raised
  themselves like a gateway."</p>

  <p>The crawling man paused.</p>

  <p>"They were a gateway," he said. "I reached them. I went between them. And
  then I sprawled and clutched the earth in sheer awe! I was on a broad stone
  platform. Before me was&mdash;sheer space! Imagine the Grand Canyon five
  times as wide and with the bottom dropped out. That is what I was looking
  into. It was like peeping over the edge of a cleft world down into the
  infinity where the planets roll! On the far side stood the five peaks. They
  looked like a gigantic warning hand stretched up to the sky. The lip of the
  abyss curved away on each side of me.</p>

  <p>"I could see down perhaps a thousand feet. Then a thick blue haze shut out
  the eye. It was like the blue you see gather on the high hills at dusk. And
  the pit&mdash;it was awesome; awesome as the Maori Gulf of Ranalak, that
  sinks between the living and the dead and that only the freshly released soul
  has strength to leap&mdash;but never strength to cross again.</p>

  <p>"I crept back from the verge and stood up, weak. My hand rested against
  one of the pillars of the gateway. There was carving upon it. It bore in
  still sharp outlines the heroic figure of a man. His back was turned. His
  arms were outstretched. There was an odd peaked headdress upon him. I looked
  at the opposite pillar. It bore a figure exactly similar. The pillars were
  triangular and the carvings were on the side away from the pit. The figures
  seemed to be holding something back. I looked closer. Behind the outstretched
  hands I seemed to see other shapes.</p>

  <p>"I traced them out vaguely. Suddenly I felt unaccountably sick. There had
  come to me an impression of enormous upright slugs. Their swollen bodies were
  faintly cut&mdash;all except the heads which were well marked globes. They
  were&mdash;unutterably loathsome. I turned from the gates back to the void. I
  stretched myself upon the slab and looked over the edge.</p>

  <p>"A stairway led down into the pit!"</p>

  <p>"A stairway!" we cried.</p>

  <p>"A stairway," repeated the crawling man as patiently as before, "It seemed
  not so much carved out of the rock as built into it. The slabs were about six
  feet long and three feet wide. It ran down from the platform and vanished
  into the blue haze."</p>

  <p>"But who could build such a stairway as that?" I said. "A stairway built
  into the wall of a precipice and leading down into a bottomless pit!"</p>

  <p>"Not bottomless," said the crawling man quietly. "There was a bottom. I
  reached it!"</p>

  <p>"Reached it?" we repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, by the stairway," answered the crawling man. "You see&mdash;I went
  down it!</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I went down the stairway. But not that day. I made my
  camp back of the gates. At dawn I filled my knapsack with food, my two
  canteens with water from a spring that wells up there by the gateway, walked
  between the carved monoliths and stepped over the edge of the pit.</p>

  <p>"The steps ran along the side of the rock at a forty degree pitch. As I
  went down and down I studied them. They were of a greenish rock quite
  different from the granitic porphyry that formed the wall of the precipice.
  At first I thought that the builders had taken advantage of an outcropping
  stratum, and had carved from it their gigantic flight. But the regularity of
  the angle at which it fell made me doubtful of this theory.</p>

  <p>"After I had gone perhaps half a mile I stepped out upon a landing. From
  this landing the stairs made a V shaped turn and ran on downward, clinging to
  the cliff at the same angle as the first flight; it was a zig-zag, and after
  I had made three of these turns I knew that the steps dropped straight down
  in a succession of such angles. No strata could be so regular as that. No,
  the stairway was built by hands! But whose? The answer is in those ruins
  around the edge, I think&mdash;never to be read.</p>

  <p>"By noon I had lost sight of the five peaks and the lip of the abyss.
  Above me, below me, was nothing but the blue haze. Beside me, too, was
  nothingness, for the further breast of rock had long since vanished. I felt
  no dizziness, and any trace of fear was swallowed in a vast curiosity. What
  was I to discover? Some ancient and wonderful civilization that had ruled
  when the Poles were tropical gardens? Nothing living, I felt sure&mdash;all
  was too old for life. Still, a stairway so wonderful must lead to something
  quite as wonderful I knew. What was it? I went on.</p>

  <p>"At regular intervals I had passed the mouths of small caves. There would
  be two thousand steps and then an opening, two thousand more steps and an
  opening&mdash;and so on and on. Late that afternoon I stopped before one of
  these clefts. I suppose I had gone then three miles down the pit, although
  the angles were such that I had walked in all fully ten miles. I examined the
  entrance. On each side were carved the figures of the great portal above,
  only now they were standing face forward, the arms outstretched as though to
  hold something back from the outer depths. Their faces were covered with
  veils. There were no hideous shapes behind them. I went inside. The fissure
  ran back for twenty yards like a burrow. It was dry and perfectly light.
  Outside I could see the blue haze rising upward like a column, its edges
  clearly marked. I felt an extraordinary sense of security, although I had not
  been conscious of any fear. I felt that the figures at the entrance were
  guardians&mdash;but against what?</p>

  <p>"The blue haze thickened and grew faintly luminescent. I fancied that it
  was dusk above. I ate and drank a little and slept. When I awoke the blue had
  lightened again, and I fancied it was dawn above. I went on. I forgot the
  gulf yawning at my side. I felt no fatigue and little hunger or thirst,
  although I had drunk and eaten sparingly. That night I spent within another
  of the caves, and at dawn I descended again.</p>

  <p>"It was late that day when I first saw the city&mdash;."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a time.</p>

  <p>"The city," he said at last, "there is a city you know. But not such a
  city as you have ever seen&mdash;nor any other man who has lived to tell of
  it. The pit, I think, is shaped like a bottle; the opening before the five
  peaks is the neck. But how wide the bottom is I do not know&mdash;thousands
  of miles maybe. I had begun to catch little glints of light far down in the
  blue. Then I saw the tops of&mdash;trees, I suppose they are. But not our
  kind of trees&mdash;unpleasant, snaky kind of trees. They reared themselves
  on high thin trunks and their tops were nests of thick tendrils with ugly
  little leaves like arrow heads. The trees were red, a vivid angry red. Here
  and there I glimpsed spots of shining yellow. I knew these were water because
  I could see things breaking through their surface&mdash;or at least I could
  see the splash and ripple, but what it was that disturbed them I never
  saw.</p>

  <p>"Straight beneath me was the&mdash;city. I looked down upon mile after
  mile of closely packed cylinders. They lay upon their sides in pyramids of
  three, of five&mdash;of dozens&mdash;piled upon each other. It is hard to
  make you see what that city is like&mdash;look, suppose you have water pipes
  of a certain length and first you lay three of them side by side and on top
  of them you place two and on these two one; or suppose you take five for a
  foundation and place on these four and then three, then two and then one. Do
  you see? That was the way they looked. But they were topped by towers, by
  minarets, by flares, by fans, and twisted monstrosities. They gleamed as
  though coated with pale rose flame. Beside them the venomous red trees raised
  themselves like the heads of hydras guarding nests of gigantic, jeweled and
  sleeping worms!</p>

  <p>"A few feet beneath me the stairway jutted out into a Titanic arch,
  unearthly as the span that bridges Hell and leads to Asgard. It curved out
  and down straight through the top of the highest pile of carven cylinders and
  then it vanished through it. It was appalling&mdash;it was
  demonic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The crawling man stopped. His eyes rolled up into his head. He trembled
  and his arms and legs began their horrible crawling movement. From his lips
  came a whispering. It was an echo of the high murmuring we had heard the
  night he came to us. I put my hands over his eyes. He quieted.</p>

  <p>"The Things Accursed!" he said. "The People of the Pit! Did I whisper. Yes
  &mdash;but they can't get me now&mdash;they can't!"</p>

  <p>After a time he began as quietly as before.</p>

  <p>"I crossed the span. I went down through the top of that&mdash;building.
  Blue darkness shrouded me for a moment and I felt the steps twist into a
  spiral. I wound down and then&mdash;I was standing high up in&mdash;I can't
  tell you in what, I'll have to call it a room. We have no images for what is
  in the pit. A hundred feet below me was the floor. The walls sloped down and
  out from where I stood in a series of widening crescents. The place was
  colossal&mdash;and it was filled with a curious mottled red light. It was
  like the light inside a green and gold flecked fire opal. I went down to the
  last step. Far in front of me rose a high, columned altar. Its pillars were
  carved in monstrous scrolls&mdash;like mad octopuses with a thousand drunken
  tentacles; they rested on the backs of shapeless monstrosities carved in
  crimson stone. The altar front was a gigantic slab of purple covered with
  carvings.</p>

  <p>"I can't describe these carvings! No human being could&mdash;the human eye
  cannot grasp them any more than it can grasp the shapes that haunt the fourth
  dimension. Only a subtle sense in the back of the brain sensed them vaguely.
  They were formless things that gave no conscious image, yet pressed into the
  mind like small hot seals&mdash;ideas of hate&mdash;of combats between
  unthinkable monstrous things&mdash;victories in a nebulous hell of steaming,
  obscene jungles&mdash;aspirations and ideals immeasurably
  loathsome&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And as I stood I grew aware of something that lay behind the lip of the
  altar fifty feet above me. I knew it was there&mdash;I felt it with every
  hair and every tiny bit of my skin. Something infinitely malignant,
  infinitely horrible, infinitely ancient. It lurked, it brooded, it threatened
  and it&mdash;was invisible!</p>

  <p>"Behind me was a circle of blue light. I ran for it. Something urged me to
  turn back, to climb the stairs and make away. It was impossible. Repulsion
  for that unseen Thing raced me onward as though a current had my feet. I
  passed through the circle. I was out on a street that stretched on into dim
  distance between rows of the carven cylinders.</p>

  <p>"Here and there the red trees arose. Between them rolled the stone
  burrows. And now I could take in the amazing ornamentation that clothed them.
  They were like the trunks of smooth skinned trees that had fallen and had
  been clothed with high reaching noxious orchids. Yes&mdash;those cylinders
  were like that&mdash;and more. They should have gone out with the dinosaurs.
  They were&mdash;monstrous. They struck the eyes like a blow and they passed
  across the nerves like a rasp. And nowhere was there sight or sound of living
  thing.</p>

  <p>"There were circular openings in the cylinders like the circle in the
  Temple of the Stairway. I passed through one of them. I was in a long, bare
  vaulted room whose curving sides half closed twenty feet over my head,
  leaving a wide slit that opened into another vaulted chamber above. There was
  absolutely nothing in the room save the same mottled reddish light that I had
  seen in the Temple. I stumbled. I still could see nothing, but there was
  something on the floor over which I had tripped. I reached down&mdash;and my
  hand touched a thing cold and smooth&mdash;that moved under it&mdash;I turned
  and ran out of that place&mdash;I was filled with a loathing that had in it
  something of madness&mdash;I ran on and on blindly&mdash; wringing my
  hands&mdash;weeping with horror&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When I came to myself I was still among the stone cylinders and red
  trees. I tried to retrace my steps; to find the Temple. I was more than
  afraid. I was like a new loosed soul panic-stricken with the first terrors of
  hell. I could not find the Temple! Then the haze began to thicken and glow;
  the cylinders to shine more brightly. I knew that it was dusk in the world
  above and I felt that with dusk my time of peril had come; that the
  thickening of the haze was the signal for the awakening of whatever things
  lived in this pit.</p>

  <p>"I scrambled up the sides of one of the burrows. I hid behind a twisted
  nightmare of stone. Perhaps, I thought, there was a chance of remaining
  hidden until the blue lightened and the peril passed. There began to grow
  around me a murmur. It was everywhere&mdash;and it grew and grew into a great
  whispering. I peeped from the side of the stone down into the street. I saw
  lights passing and repassing. More and more lights&mdash;they swam out of the
  circular doorways and they thronged the street. The highest were eight feet
  above the pave; the lowest perhaps two. They hurried, they sauntered, they
  bowed, they stopped and whispered&mdash;and there was nothing under
  them!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing under them!" breathed Anderson.</p>

  <p>"No," he went on, "that was the terrible part of it&mdash;there was
  nothing under them. Yet certainly the lights were living things. They had
  consciousness, volition, thought&mdash;what else I did not know. They were
  nearly two feet across&mdash;the largest. Their center was a bright nucleus
  &mdash;red, blue, green. This nucleus faded off, gradually, into a misty glow
  that did not end abruptly. It too seemed to fade off into nothingness
  &mdash;but a nothingness that had under it a somethingness. I strained my
  eyes trying to grasp this body into which the lights merged and which one
  could only feel was there, but could not see.</p>

  <p>"And all at once I grew rigid. Something cold, and thin like a whip, had
  touched my face. I turned my head. Close behind were three of the lights.
  They were a pale blue. They looked at me&mdash;if you can imagine lights that
  are eyes. Another whiplash gripped my shoulder. Under the closest light came
  a shrill whispering. I shrieked. Abruptly the murmuring in the street ceased.
  I dragged my eyes from the pale blue globe that held them and looked
  out&mdash;the lights in the streets were rising by myriads to the level of
  where I stood! There they stopped and peered at me. They crowded and jostled
  as though they were a crowd of curious people&mdash;on Broadway. I felt a
  score of the lashes touch me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When I came to myself I was again in the great Place of the Stairway,
  lying at the foot of the altar. All was silent. There were no lights&mdash;
  only the mottled red glow. I jumped to my feet and ran toward the steps.
  Something jerked me back to my knees. And then I saw that around my waist had
  been fastened a yellow ring of metal. From it hung a chain and this chain
  passed up over the lip of the high ledge. I was chained to the altar!</p>

  <p>"I reached into my pockets for my knife to cut through the ring. It was
  not there! I had been stripped of everything except one of the canteens that
  I had hung around my neck and which I suppose They had thought was&mdash;
  part of me. I tried to break the ring. It seemed alive. It writhed in my
  hands and it drew itself closer around me! I pulled at the chain. It was
  immovable. There came to me the consciousness of the unseen Thing above the
  altar. I groveled at the foot of the slab and wept. Think&mdash;alone in that
  place of strange light with the brooding ancient Horror above me&mdash; a
  monstrous Thing, a Thing unthinkable&mdash;an unseen Thing that poured forth
  horror&mdash;</p>

  <p>"After awhile I gripped myself. Then I saw beside one of the pillars a
  yellow bowl filled with a thick white liquid. I drank it. If it killed I did
  not care. But its taste was pleasant and as I drank my strength came back to
  me with a rush. Clearly I was not to be starved. The lights, whatever they
  were, had a conception of human needs.</p>

  <p>"And now the reddish mottled gleam began to deepen. Outside arose the
  humming and through the circle that was the entrance came streaming the
  globes, They ranged themselves in ranks until they filled the Temple. Their
  whispering grew into a chant, a cadenced whispering chant that rose and fell,
  rose and fell, while to its rhythm the globes lifted and sank, lifted and
  sank.</p>

  <p>"All that night the lights came and went&mdash;and all that night the
  chant sounded as they rose and fell. At the last I felt myself only an atom
  of consciousness in a sea of cadenced whispering; an atom that rose and fell
  with the bowing globes. I tell you that even my heart pulsed in unison with
  them! The red glow faded, the lights streamed out; the whispering died. I was
  again alone and I knew that once again day had broken in my own world."</p>

  <p>"I slept. When I awoke I found beside the pillar more of the white liquid.
  I scrutinized the chain that held me to the altar. I began to rub two of the
  links together. I did this for hours. When the red began to thicken there was
  a ridge worn in the links. Hope rushed up within me. There was, then, a
  chance to escape."</p>

  <p>"With the thickening the lights came again. All through that night the
  whispering chant sounded, and the globes rose and fell. The chant seized me.
  It pulsed through me until every nerve and muscle quivered to it. My lips
  began to quiver. They strove like a man trying to cry out on a nightmare. And
  at last they too were whispering the chant of the people of the pit. My body
  bowed in unison with the lights&mdash;I was, in movement and sound, one with
  the nameless things while my soul sank back sick with horror and powerless.
  While I whispered I&mdash;saw Them!"</p>

  <p>"Saw the lights?" I asked stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Saw the Things under the lights," he answered. "Great transparent snail-
  like bodies&mdash;dozens of waving tentacles stretching from them&mdash;
  round gaping mouths under the luminous seeing globes. They were like the
  ghosts of inconceivably monstrous slugs! I could see through them. And as I
  stared, still bowing and whispering, the dawn came and they streamed to and
  through the entrance. They did not crawl or walk&mdash;they floated! They
  floated and were&mdash;gone!</p>

  <p>"I did not sleep. I worked all that day at my chain. By the thickening of
  the red I had worn it a sixth through. And all that night I whispered and
  bowed with the pit people, joining in their chant to the Thing that brooded
  above me!</p>

  <p>"Twice again the red thickened and the chant held me&mdash;then on the
  morning of the fifth day I broke through the worn links of the chain. I was
  free! I drank from the bowl of white liquid and poured what was left in my
  flask. I ran to the Stairway. I rushed up and past that unseen Horror behind
  the altar ledge and was out upon the Bridge. I raced across the span and up
  the Stairway.</p>

  <p>"Can you think what it is to climb straight up the verge of a cleft world
  &mdash;with hell behind you? Hell was behind me and terror rode me. The city
  had long been lost in the blue haze before I knew that I could climb no more.
  My heart beat upon my ears like a sledge. I fell before one of the little
  caves feeling that here at last was sanctuary. I crept far back within it and
  waited for the haze to thicken. Almost at once it did so. From far below me
  came a vast and angry murmur. At the mouth of the rift I saw a light pulse up
  through the blue; die down and as it dimmed I saw myriads of the globes that
  are the eyes of the pit people swing downward into the abyss. Again and again
  the light pulsed and the globes fell. They were hunting me. The whispering
  grew louder, more insistent.</p>

  <p>"There grew in me the dreadful desire to join in the whispering as I had
  done in the Temple. I bit my lips through and through to still them. All that
  night the beam shot up through the abyss, the globes swung and the whispering
  sounded&mdash;and now I knew the purpose of the caves and of the sculptured
  figures that still had power to guard them. But what were the people who had
  carved them? Why had they built their city around the verge and why had they
  set that Stairway in the pit? What had they been to those Things that dwelt
  at the bottom and what use had the Things been to them that they should live
  beside their dwelling place? That there had been some purpose was certain. No
  work so prodigious as the Stairway would have been undertaken otherwise. But
  what was the purpose? And why was it that those who had dwelt about the abyss
  had passed away ages gone, and the dwellers in the abyss still lived? I could
  find no answer&mdash;nor can I find any now. I have not the shred of a
  theory.</p>

  <p>"Dawn came as I wondered and with it silence. I drank what was left of the
  liquid in my canteen, crept from the cave and began to climb again. That
  afternoon my legs gave out. I tore off my shirt, made from it pads for my
  knees and coverings for my hands. I crawled upward. I crawled up and up. And
  again I crept into one of the caves and waited until again the blue
  thickened, the shaft of light shot through it and the whispering came.</p>

  <p>"But now there was a new note in the whispering. It was no longer
  threatening. It called and coaxed. It drew."</p>

  <p>A new terror gripped me. There had come upon me a mighty desire to leave
  the cave and go out where the lights swung; to let them do with me as they
  pleased, carry me where they wished. The desire grew. It gained fresh impulse
  with every rise of the beam until at last I vibrated with the desire as I had
  vibrated to the chant in the Temple. My body was a pendulum. Up would go the
  beam and I would swing toward it! Only my soul kept steady. It held me fast
  to the floor of the cave; And all that night it fought with my body against
  the spell of the pit people.</p>

  <p>"Dawn came. Again I crept from the cave and faced the Stairway. I could
  not rise. My hands were torn and bleeding; my knees an agony. I forced myself
  upward step by step. After a while my hands became numb, the pain left my
  knees. They deadened. Step by step my will drove my body upward upon
  them."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;a nightmare of crawling up infinite stretches of steps
  &mdash;memories of dull horror while hidden within caves with the lights
  pulsing without and whisperings that called and called me&mdash;memory of a
  time when I awoke to find that my body was obeying the call and had carried
  me half way out between the guardians of the portals while thousands of
  gleaming globes rested in the blue haze and watched me."</p>

  <p>Glimpses of bitter fights against sleep and always, always&mdash;a climb
  up and up along infinite distances of steps that led from Abaddon to a
  Paradise of blue sky and open world!</p>

  <p>"At last a consciousness of the clear sky close above me, the lip of the
  pit before me&mdash;memory of passing between the great portals of the pit
  and of steady withdrawal from it&mdash;dreams of giant men with strange
  peaked crowns and veiled faces who pushed me onward and onward and held back
  Roman Candle globules of light that sought to draw me back to a gulf wherein
  planets swam between the branches of red trees that had snakes for
  crowns."</p>

  <p>"And then a long, long sleep&mdash;how long God alone knows&mdash;in a
  cleft of rocks; an awakening to see far in the North the beam still rising
  and falling, the lights still hunting, the whispering high above me
  calling."</p>

  <p>"Again crawling on dead arms and legs that moved&mdash;that moved
  &mdash;like the Ancient Mariner's ship&mdash;without volition of mine, but
  that carried me from a haunted place. And then&mdash;your fire&mdash;and
  this&mdash;safety!"</p>

  <p>The crawling man smiled at us for a moment. Then swiftly life faded from
  his face. He slept.</p>

  <p>That afternoon we struck camp and carrying the crawling man started back
  South. For three days we carried him and still he slept. And on the third
  day, still sleeping, he died. We built a great pile of wood and we burned his
  body as he had asked. We scattered his ashes about the forest with the ashes
  of the trees that had consumed him. It must be a great magic indeed that
  could disentangle those ashes and draw him back in a rushing cloud to the pit
  he called Accursed. I do not think that even the People of the Pit have such
  a spell. No.</p>

  <p>But we did not return to the five peaks to see.</p><hr>

  <h3>First published in <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, November 24, 1917<br>
  Reprinted in <i>Fantastic Novels</i>, September 1940</h3><br>

  <p class="first">HERNDON helped loot the Forbidden City when the Allies
  turned the suppression of the Boxers into the most gorgeous burglar-party
  since the days of Tamerlane. Six of his sailormen followed faithfully his
  buccaneering fancy. A sympathetic Russian highness whom he had entertained in
  New York saw to it that he got to the coast and his yacht. That is why
  Herndon was able to sail through the Narrows with as much of the Son of
  Heaven's treasures as the most accomplished laborer in Peking's mission
  vineyards.</p>

  <p>Some of the loot he gave to charming ladies who had dwelt or were still
  dwelling on the sunny side of his heart. Most of it he used to fit up those
  two astonishing Chinese rooms in his Fifth Avenue house. And a little of it,
  following a vague religious impulse, he presented to the Metropolitan Museum.
  This, somehow, seemed to put the stamp of legitimacy on his part of the
  pillage&mdash;like offerings to the gods and building hospitals and peace
  palaces and such things.</p>

  <p>But the Dragon Glass, because he had never seen anything quite so
  wonderful, he set up in his bedroom Where he could look at it the first thing
  in the morning, and he placed shaded lights about it so that he could wake up
  in the night and look at it! Wonderful? It is more than wonderful, the Dragon
  Glass! Whoever made it lived when the gods walked about the earth creating
  something new every day. Only a man who lived in that sort of atmosphere
  could have wrought it. There was never anything like it.</p>

  <p>I was in Hawaii when the cables told of Herndon's first disappearance.
  There wasn't much to tell. His man had gone to his room to awaken him one
  morning&mdash;and Herndon wasn't there. All his clothes were, though,
  Everything was just as if Herndon ought to be somewhere in the house&mdash;
  only he wasn't.</p>

  <p>A man worth ten millions can't step out into thin air and vanish without
  leaving behind him the probability of some commotion, naturally. The
  newspapers attend to the commotion, but the columns of type boiled down to
  essentials contained just two facts&mdash;that Herndon had come home the
  night before, and in the morning he was undiscoverable.</p>

  <p>I was on the high seas, homeward bound to help the search, when the
  wireless told the story of his reappearance. They had found him on the floor
  of his bedroom, shreds of a silken robe on him, and his body mauled as though
  by a tiger. But there was no more explanation of his return than there had
  been of his disappearance.</p>

  <p>The night before he hadn't been there&mdash;and in the morning there he
  was. Herndon, when he was able to talk, utterly refused to confide even in
  his doctors. I went straight through to New York, and waited until the men of
  medicine decided that it was better to let him see me than have him worry any
  longer about not seeing me.</p>

  <p>Herndon got up from a big invalid chair when I entered. His eyes were
  clear and bright, and there was no weakness in the way he greeted me, nor in
  the grip of his hand. A nurse slipped from the room.</p>

  <p>"What was it, Jim?" I cried. "What on earth happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"Not so sure it was on earth," he said. He pointed to what looked like a
  tall easel hooded with a heavy piece of silk covered with embroidered Chinese
  characters. He hesitated for a moment and then walked over to a closet. He
  drew out two heavy bore guns, the very ones, I remembered, that he had used
  in his last elephant hunt.</p>

  <p>"You won't think me crazy if I ask you to keep one of these handy while I
  talk, will you, Ward?" he asked rather apologetically. "This looks pretty
  real, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>He opened his dressing gown and showed me his chest swathed in bandages.
  He gripped my shoulder as I took without question one of the guns. He walked
  to the easel and drew off the hood.</p>

  <p>"There it is," said Herndon.</p>

  <p>And then, for the first time, I saw the Dragon Glass!</p>

  <p>There never has been anything like that thing! Never! At first all you saw
  was a cool, green, glimmering translucence, like the sea when you are
  swimming under water on a still summer day and look up through it. Around its
  edges ran flickers of scarlet and gold, flashes of emerald, shimmers of
  silver and ivory. At its base a disk of topaz rimmed with red fire shot up
  dusky little vaporous yellow flames.</p>

  <p>Afterward you were aware that the green translucence was an oval slice of
  polished stone. The flashes and flickers became dragons. There were twelve of
  them. Their eyes were emeralds, their fangs were ivory, their claws were
  gold. There were scaled dragons, and each scale was so inlaid that the base,
  green as the primeval jungle, shaded off into vivid scarlet, and the scarlet
  into tip's of gold. Their wings were of silver and vermilion, and were folded
  close to their bodies.</p>

  <p>But they were alive, those dragons. There was never so much life in metal
  and wood since Al-Akram, the Sculptor of ancient Ad, carved the first
  crocodile, and the jealous Almighty breathed life into it for a
  punishment!</p>

  <p>And last you saw that the topaz disk that sent up the little yellow flames
  was the top of a metal sphere around which coiled a thirteenth dragon, thin
  and red, and biting its scorpion-tipped tail.</p>

  <p>It took your breath away, the first glimpse of the Dragon Glass. Yes, and
  the second and third glimpse, too&mdash;and every other time you looked at
  it.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?" I asked, a little shakily.</p>

  <p>Herndon said evenly: "It was in a small hidden crypt in the Imperial
  Palace. We broke into the crypt quite by"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"well,
  call it accident. As soon as I saw it I knew I must have it. What do you
  think of it?"</p>

  <p>"Think!" I cried. "Think! Why, it's the most marvelous thing that the
  hands of man ever made! What is that stone? Jade?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure," said Herndon. "But come here. Stand just in front of
  me."</p>

  <p>He switched out the lights in the room. He turned another switch, and on
  the glass opposite me three shaded electrics threw their rays into its
  mirror-like oval.</p>

  <p>"Watch!" said Herndon. "Tell me what you see!"</p>

  <p>I looked into the glass. At first I could see nothing but the rays shining
  farther, farther&mdash;back into infinite distances, it seemed. And then.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I cried, stiffening with horror. "Jim, what hellish thing is
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Steady, old man," came Herndon's voice. There was relief and a curious
  sort of joy in it. "Steady; tell me what you see."</p>

  <p>I said: "I seem to see through infinite distances&mdash;and yet what I see
  is as close to me as though it were just on the other side of the glass. I
  see a cleft that cuts through two masses of darker green. I see a claw, a
  gigantic, hideous claw that stretches out through the cleft. The claw has
  seven talons that open and close&mdash;open and close. Good God, such a claw,
  Jim! It is like the claws that reach out from the holes in the lama's hell to
  grip the blind souls as they shudder by!"</p>

  <p>"Look, look farther, up through the cleft, above the claw. It widens. What
  do you see?"</p>

  <p>I said: "I see a peak rising enormously high and cutting the sky like a
  pyramid. There are flashes of flame that dart from behind and outline it. I
  see a great globe of light like a moon that moves slowly out of the flashes;
  there is another moving across the breast of the peak; there is a third that
  swims into the flame at the farthest edge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The seven moons of Rak," whispered Herndon, as though to himself. "The
  seven moons that bathe in the rose flames of Rak which are the fires of life
  and that circle Lalil like a diadem. He upon whom the seven moons of Rak have
  shone is bound to Lalil for this life, and for ten thousand lives."</p>

  <p>He reached over and turned the switch again. The lights of the room sprang
  up.</p>

  <p>"Jim," I said, "it can't be real! What is it? Some devilish illusion in
  the glass?"</p>

  <p>He unfastened the bandages about his chest.</p>

  <p>"The claw you saw had seven talons," he answered quietly. "Well, look at
  this."</p>

  <p>Across the white flesh of his breast, from left shoulder to the lower ribs
  on the right, ran seven healing furrows. They looked as though they had been
  made by a gigantic steel comb that had been drawn across him. They gave one
  the thought they had been ploughed.</p>

  <p>"The claw made these," he said as quietly as before.</p>

  <p>"Ward," he went on, before I could speak, "I wanted you to see&mdash; what
  you've seen. I didn't know whether you would see it. I don't know whether
  you'll believe me even now. I don't suppose I would if I were in your
  place&mdash;still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He walked over and threw the hood upon the Dragon Glass.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you," he said. "I'd like to go through it&mdash;
  uninterrupted. That's why I cover it.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," he began slowly&mdash;"I don't suppose, Ward, that
  you've ever heard of Rak the Wonder-Worker, who lived somewhere back at the
  beginning of things, nor how the Greatest Wonder-Worker banished him
  somewhere outside the world?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said shortly, still shaken by the sight.</p>

  <p>"It's a big part of what I've got to tell you," he went on. "Of course
  you'll think it rot, but&mdash;I came across the legend in Tibet first. Then
  I ran across it again&mdash;with the names changed, of course&mdash; when I
  was getting away from China.</p>

  <p>"I take it that the gods were still fussing around close to man when Rak
  was born. The story of his parentage is somewhat scandalous. When he grew
  older Rak wasn't satisfied with just seeing wonderful things being done. He
  wanted to do them himself, and he&mdash;well, he studied the method. After a
  while the Greatest Wonder-Worker ran across some of the things Rak had made,
  and he found them admirable&mdash;a little too admirable. He didn't like to
  destroy the lesser wonder-worker because, so the gossip ran, he felt a sort
  of responsibility. So he gave Rak a place somewhere&mdash;outside the
  world&mdash;and he gave him power over every one out of so many millions of
  births to lead or lure or sweep that soul into his domain so that he might
  build up a people&mdash;and over his people Rak was given the high, the low,
  and the middle justice.</p>

  <p>"And outside the world Rak went. He fenced his domain about with clouds.
  He raised a great mountain, and on its flank he built a city for the men and
  women who were to be his. He circled the city with wonderful gardens, and he
  placed in the gardens many things, some good and some very&mdash;terrible. He
  set around the mountain's brow seven moons for a diadem, and he fanned behind
  the mountain a fire which is the fire of life, and through which the moons
  pass eternally to be born again." Herndon's voice sank to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Through which the moons pass," he said. "And with them the souls of the
  people of Rak. They pass through the fires and are born again&mdash;and
  again&mdash;for ten thousand lives. I have seen the moons of Rak and the
  souls that march with them into the fires. There is no sun in the land
  &mdash;only the new-born moons that shine green on the city and on the
  gardens."</p>

  <p>"Jim," I cried impatiently. "What in the world are you talking about? Wake
  up, man! What's all that nonsense got to do with this?"</p>

  <p>I pointed to the hooded Dragon Glass.</p>

  <p>"That," he said. "Why, through that lies the road to the gardens of
  Rak!"</p>

  <p>The heavy gun dropped from my hand as I stared at him, and from him to the
  glass and back again. He smiled and pointed to his bandaged breast.</p>

  <p>He said: "I went straight through to Peking with the Allies. I had an idea
  what was coming, and I wanted to be in at the death. I was among the first to
  enter the Forbidden City. I was as mad for loot as any of them. It was a
  maddening sight, Ward. Soldiers with their arms full of precious stuff even
  Morgan couldn't buy; soldiers with wonderful necklaces around their hairy
  throats and their pockets stuffed with jewels; soldiers with their shirts
  bulging treasures the Sons of Heaven had been hoarding for centuries! We were
  Goths sacking imperial Rome. Alexander's hosts pillaging that ancient gemmed
  courtesan of cities, royal Tyre! Thieves in the great ancient scale, a scale
  so great that it raised even thievery up to something heroic.</p>

  <p>"We reached the throne-room. There was a little passage leading off to the
  left, and my men and I took it. We came into a small octagonal room. There
  was nothing in it except a very extraordinary squatting figure of jade. It
  squatted on the floor, its back turned toward us. One of my men stooped to
  pick it up. He slipped. The figure flew from his hand and smashed into the
  wall. A slab swung outward. By a&mdash;well, call it a fluke, we had struck
  the secret of the little octagonal room!</p>

  <p>"I shoved a light through the aperture. It showed a crypt shaped like a
  cylinder. The circle of the floor was about ten feet in diameter. The walls
  were covered with paintings, Chinese characters, queer-looking animals, and
  things I can't well describe. Around the room, about seven feet up, ran a
  picture. It showed a sort of island floating off into space. The clouds
  lapped its edges like frozen seas full of rainbows. There was a big pyramid
  of a mountain rising out of the side of it. Around its peak were seven moons,
  and over the peak&mdash;a face!</p>

  <p>"I couldn't place that face and I couldn't take my eyes off it. It wasn't
  Chinese, and it wasn't of any other race I'd ever seen. It was as old as the
  world and as young as tomorrow. It was benevolent and malicious, cruel and
  kindly, merciful and merciless, saturnine as Satan and as joyous as Apollo.
  The eyes were as yellow as buttercups, or as the sunstone on the crest of the
  Feathered Serpent they worship down in the Hidden Temple of Tuloon. And they
  were as wise as Fate.</p>

  <p>"'There's something else here, sir,' said Martin&mdash;you remember
  Martin, my first officer. He pointed to a shrouded thing on the side. I
  entered, and took from the thing a covering that fitted over it like a hood.
  It was the Dragon Glass!</p>

  <p>"The moment I saw it I knew I had to have it&mdash;and I knew I would have
  it. I felt that I did not want to get the thing away any more than the thing
  itself wanted to get away. From the first I thought of the Dragon Glass as
  something alive. Just as much alive as you and I are. Well, I did get it
  away. I got it down to the yacht, and then the first odd thing happened.</p>

  <p>"You remember Wu-Sing, my boat steward? You know the English Wu-Sing
  talks. Atrocious! I had the Dragon Glass in my stateroom. I'd forgotten to
  lock the door. I heard a whistle of sharply indrawn breath. I turned, and
  there was Wu-Sing. Now, you know that Wu-Sing isn't what you'd call
  intelligent-looking. Yet as he stood there something seemed to pass over his
  face, and very subtly change it. The stupidity was wiped out as though a
  sponge had been passed over it. He did not raise his eyes, but he said, in
  perfect English, mind you; 'Has the master augustly counted the cost of his
  possession?'</p>

  <p>"I simply gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps,' he continued, 'the master has never heard of the illustrious
  Hao-Tzan? Well, he shall hear.'"</p>

  <p>"Ward, I couldn't move or speak. But I know now it wasn't sheer
  astonishment that held me. I listened while Wu-Sing went on to tell in
  polished phrase the same story that I had heard in Tibet, only there they
  called him Rak instead of Hao-Tzan. But it was the same story."</p>

  <p>"'And,' he finished, 'before he journeyed afar, the illustrious Hao-Tzan
  caused a great marvel to be wrought. He called it the Gateway.' Wu-Sing waved
  his hand to the Dragon Glass. 'The master has it. But what shall he who has a
  Gateway do but pass through it? Is it not better to leave the Gateway behind
  &mdash;unless he dare go through it?'"</p>

  <p>"He was silent. I was silent, too. All I could do was wonder where the
  fellow had so suddenly got his command of English. And then Wu-Sing
  straightened. For a moment his eyes looked into mine. They were as yellow as
  buttercups, Ward, and wise, wise! My mind rushed back to the little room
  behind the panel. Ward&mdash;the eyes of Wu-Sing were the eyes of the face
  that brooded over the peak of the moons!"</p>

  <p>"And all in a moment, the face of Wu-Sing dropped back into its old
  familiar stupid lines. The eyes he turned to me were black and clouded. I
  jumped from my chair."</p>

  <p>"'What do you mean, you yellow fraud!' I shouted. 'What do you mean by
  pretending all this time that you couldn't talk English?'"</p>

  <p>"He looked at me stupidly, as usual. He whined in his pidgin that he
  didn't understand; that he hadn't spoken a word to me until then. I couldn't
  get anything else out of him, although I nearly frightened his wits out. I
  had to believe him. Besides, I had seen his eyes. Well, I was fair curious by
  this time, and I was more anxious to get the glass home safely than
  ever."</p>

  <p>"I got it home. I set it up here, and I fixed those lights as you saw
  them. I had a sort of feeling that the glass was waiting&mdash;for something.
  I couldn't tell just what. But that it was going to be rather important, I
  knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He suddenly thrust his head into his hands, and rocked to and fro.</p>

  <p>"How long, how long," he moaned, "how long, Santhu?"</p>

  <p>"Jim!" I cried. "Jim! What's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>He straightened. "In a moment you'll understand," he said.</p>

  <p>And then, as quietly as before: "I felt that the glass was waiting. The
  night I disappeared I couldn't sleep. I turned out the lights in the room;
  turned them on around the glass and sat before it. I don't know how long I
  sat, but all at once I jumped to my feet. The dragons seemed to be moving!
  They were moving! They were crawling round and round the glass. They moved
  faster and faster. The thirteenth dragon spun about the topaz globe. They
  circled faster and faster until they were nothing but a halo of crimson and
  gold flashes. As they spun, the glass itself grew misty, mistier, mistier
  still, until it was nothing but a green haze. I stepped over to touch it. My
  hand went straight on through it as though nothing were there.</p>

  <p>"I reached in&mdash;up to the elbow, up to the shoulder. I felt my hand
  grasped by warm little fingers. I stepped through&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stepped through the glass?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"Through it," he said, "and then&mdash;I felt another little hand touch my
  face. I saw Santhu!</p>

  <p>"Her eyes were as blue as the corn flowers, as blue as the big sapphire
  that shines in the forehead of Vishnu, in his temple at Benares. And they
  were set wide, wide apart. Her hair was blue-black, and fell in two long
  braids between her little breasts. A golden dragon crowned her, and through
  its paws slipped the braids. Another golden dragon girded her. She laughed
  into my eyes, and drew my head down until my lips touched hers. She was lithe
  and slender and yielding as the reeds that grow before the Shrine of Hathor
  that stands on the edge of the Pool of Djeeba. Who Santhu is or where she
  came from&mdash;how do I know? But this I know&mdash;she is lovelier than any
  woman who ever lived on earth. And she is a woman!</p>

  <p>"Her arms slipped from about my neck and she drew me forward. I looked
  about me. We stood in a cleft between two great rocks. The rocks were a soft
  green, like the green of the Dragon Glass. Behind us was a green mistiness.
  Before us the cleft ran only a little distance. Through it I saw an enormous
  peak jutting up like a pyramid, high, high into a sky of chrysoprase. A soft
  rose radiance pulsed at its sides, and swimming slowly over its breast was a
  huge globe of green fire. The girl pulled me towards the opening. We walked
  on silently, hand in hand. Quickly it came to me&mdash;Ward, I was in the
  place whose pictures had been painted in the room of the Dragon Glass!</p>

  <p>"We came out of the cleft and into a garden. The Gardens of Many-Columned
  Iram, lost in the desert because they were too beautiful, must have been like
  that place. There were strange, immense trees whose branches were like
  feathery plumes and whose plumes shone with fires like those that clothe the
  feet of Indra's dancers. Strange flowers raised themselves along our path,
  and their hearts glowed like the glow-worms that are fastened to the rainbow
  bridge to Asgard. A wind sighed through the plumed trees, and luminous
  shadows drifted past their trunks. I heard a girl laugh, and the voice of a
  man singing.</p>

  <p>"We went on. Once there was a low wailing far in the garden, and the girl
  threw herself before me, her arms outstretched. The wailing ceased, and we
  went on. The mountain grew plainer. I saw another great globe of green fire
  swing out of the rose flashes at the right of the peak. I saw another shining
  into the glow at the left. There was a curious trail of mist behind it. It
  was a mist that had tangled in it a multitude of little stars. Everything was
  bathed in a soft green light&mdash;such a light as you would have if you
  lived within a pale emerald.</p>

  <p>"We turned and went along another little trail. The little trail ran up a
  little hill, and on the hill was a little house. It looked as though it was
  made of ivory. It was a very odd little house. It was more like the Jain
  pagodas at Brahmaputra than anything else. The walls glowed as though they
  were full light. The girl touched the wall, and a panel slid away. We
  entered, and the panel closed after us.</p>

  <p>"The room was filled with a whispering yellow light. I say whispering
  because that is how one felt about it. It was gentle and alive. A stairway of
  ivory ran up to another room above. The girl pressed me toward it. Neither of
  us had uttered a word. There was a spell of silence upon me. I could not
  speak. There seemed to be nothing to say. I felt a great rest and a great
  peace&mdash;as though I had come home. I walked up the stairway and into the
  room above. It was dark except for a bar of green light that came through the
  long and narrow window. Through it I saw the mountain and its moons. On the
  floor was an ivory head-rest and some silken cloths. I felt suddenly very
  sleepy. I dropped to the cloths, and at once was asleep.</p>

  <p>"When I awoke the girl with the cornflower eyes was beside me! She was
  sleeping. As I watched, her eyes opened. She smiled and drew me to
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not know why, but a name came to me. 'Santhu!' I cried. She smiled
  again, and I knew that I had called her name. It seemed to me that I
  remembered her, too, out of immeasurable ages. I arose and walked to the
  window. I looked toward the mountain. There were now two moons on its breast.
  And then I saw the city that lay on the mountain's flank. It was such a city
  as you see in dreams, or as the tale-tellers of El-Bahara fashion out of the
  mirage. It was all of ivory and shining greens and flashing blues and
  crimsons. I could see people walking about its streets. There came the sound
  of little golden bells chiming."</p>

  <p>"I turned toward the girl. She was sitting up, her hands clasped about her
  knees, watching me. Love came, swift and compelling. She arose&mdash;I took
  her in my arms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Many times the moons circled the mountains, and the mist held the little,
  tangled stars passing with them. I saw no one but Santhu; no thing came near
  us. The trees fed us with fruits that had in them the very essences of life.
  Yes, the fruit of the Tree of Life that stood in Eden must have been like the
  fruit of those trees. We drank of green water that sparkled with green fires,
  and tasted like the wine Osiris gives the hungry souls in Amenti to
  strengthen them. We bathed in pools of carved stone that welled with water
  yellow as amber. Mostly we wandered in the gardens. There were many wonderful
  things in the gardens. They were very unearthly. There was no day nor night.
  Only the green glow of the ever-circling moons. We never talked to each
  other. I don't know why. Always there seemed nothing to say."</p>

  <p>"Then Santhu began to sing to me. Her songs were strange songs. I could
  not tell what the words were. But they built up pictures in my brain. I saw
  Rak the Wonder-Worker fashioning his gardens, and filling them with things
  beautiful and things&mdash;evil. I saw him raise the peak, and knew that it
  was Lalil; saw him fashion the seven moons and kindle the fires that are the
  fires of life. I saw him build his city, and I saw men and women pass into it
  from the world through many gateways."</p>

  <p>"Santhu sang&mdash;and I knew that the marching stars in the mist were the
  souls of the people of Rak which sought rebirth. She sang, and I saw myself
  ages past walking in the city of Rak with Santhu beside me. Her song wailed,
  and I felt myself one of the mist-entangled stars. Her song wept, and I felt
  myself a star that fought against the mist, and, fighting, break away
  &mdash;a star that fled out and out through immeasurable green
  space&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A man stood before us. He was very tall. His face was both cruel and
  kind, saturnine as Satan and joyous as Apollo. He raised his eyes to us, and
  they were yellow as buttercups, and wise, so wise! Ward, it was the face
  above the peak in the room of the Dragon Glass! The eyes that had looked at
  me out of Wu-Sing's face! He smiled on us for a moment and then&mdash;he was
  gone!"</p>

  <p>"I took Santhu by the hand and began to run. Quite suddenly it came to me
  that I had enough of the haunted gardens of Rak; that I wanted to get back to
  my own land. But not without Santhu. I tried to remember the road to the
  cleft. I felt that there lay the path back. We ran. From far behind came a
  wailing. Santhu screamed&mdash;but I knew the fear in her cry was not for
  herself. It was for me. None of the creatures of that place could harm her
  who was herself one of its creatures. The wailing drew closer. I turned."</p>

  <p>"Winging down through the green air was a beast, an unthinkable beast,
  Ward! It was like the winged beast of the Apocalypse that is to bear the
  woman arrayed in purple and scarlet. It was beautiful even in its horror. It
  closed its scarlet and golden wings, and its long, gleaming body shot at me
  like a monstrous spear."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;just as it was about to strike&mdash;a mist threw itself
  between us! It was a rainbow mist, and it was&mdash;cast. It was cast as
  though a hand had held it and thrown it like a net. I heard the winged beast
  shriek its disappointment, Santhu's hand gripped mine tighter. We ran through
  the mist."</p>

  <p>"Before us was the cleft between the two green rocks. Time and time again
  we raced for it, and time and time again that beautiful shining horror struck
  at me&mdash;and each time came the thrown mist to baffle it. It was a game!
  Once I heard a laugh, and then I knew who was my hunter. The master of the
  beast and the caster of the mist. It was he of the yellow eyes&mdash;and he
  was playing me&mdash;playing me as a child plays with a cat when he tempts it
  with a piece of meat and snatches the meat away again and again from the
  hungry jaws!"</p>

  <p>"The mist cleared away from its last throw, and the mouth of the cleft was
  just before us. Once more the thing swooped&mdash;and this time there was no
  mist. The player had tired of the game! As it struck, Santhu raised herself
  before it. The beast swerved&mdash;and the claw that had been stretched to
  rip me from throat to waist struck me a glancing blow. I fell &mdash;fell
  through leagues and leagues of green space."</p>

  <p>"When I awoke I was here in this bed, with the doctor men around me and
  this&mdash;" He pointed to his bandaged breast again.</p>

  <p>"That night when the nurse was asleep I got up and looked into the Dragon
  Glass, and I saw&mdash;the claw, even as you did. The beast is there. It is
  waiting for me!"</p>

  <p>Herndon was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"If he tires of the waiting he may send the beast through for me," he
  said. "I mean the man with the yellow eyes. I've a desire to try one of these
  guns on it. It's real, you know, the beast is&mdash;and these guns have
  stopped elephants."</p>

  <p>"But the man with the yellow eyes, Jim," I whispered&mdash;"who is
  he?"</p>

  <p>"He," said Herndon&mdash;"why, he's the Wonder-Worker himself!"</p>

  <p>"You don't believe such a story as that!" I cried. "Why, it's&mdash;it's
  lunacy! It's some devilish illusion in the glass. It's like the&mdash;
  crystal globe that makes you hypnotize yourself and think the things your own
  mind creates are real. Break it, Jim! It's devilish! Break it!"</p>

  <p>"Break it!" he said incredulously. "Break it? Not for the ten thousand
  lives that are the toll of Rak! Not real? Aren't these wounds real? Wasn't
  Santhu real? Break it! Good God, man, you don't know what you say! Why, it's
  my only road back to her! If that yellow-eyed devil back there were only as
  wise as he looks, he would know he didn't have to keep his beast watching
  there. I want to go, Ward; I want to go and bring her back with me. I've an
  idea, somehow, that he hasn't&mdash;well, full control of things. I've an
  idea that the Greatest Wonder-Worker wouldn't put wholly in Rak's hands the
  souls that wander through the many gateways into his kingdom. There's a way
  out, Ward; there's a way to escape him. I won away from him once, Ward. I'm
  sure of it. But then I left Santhu behind. I have to go back for her. That's
  why I found the little passage that led from the throne-room. And he knows
  it, too. That's why he had to turn his beast on me."</p>

  <p>"And I'll go through again, Ward. And I'll come back again&mdash;with
  Santhu!"</p>

  <p>But he has not returned. It is six months now since he disappeared for the
  second time. And from his bedroom, as he had done before. By the will that
  they found&mdash;the will that commended that in event of his disappearing as
  he had done before and not returning within a week I was to have his house
  and all that was within it&mdash;I came into possession of the Dragon Glass.
  The dragons had spun again for Herndon, and he had gone through the gateway
  once more. I found only one of the elephant guns, and I knew that he had had
  time to take the other with him.</p>

  <p>I sit night after night before the glass, waiting for him to come back
  through it&mdash;with Santhu. Sooner or later they will come. That I
  know.</p><hr>

  <h3>First published in <i>Fantasy Magazine,</i> September 1934<br>
  Also published as "The Drone Man" (<i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>, August
  1936)</h3><br>

  <p class="first">FOUR MEN sat at a table of the Explorers' Club&mdash;Hewitt,
  just in from two years botanical research in Abyssinia; Caranac, the
  ethnologist; MacLeod, poet first, and second the learned curator of the
  Asiatic Museum; Winston, the archeologist, who, with Kosloff the Russian, had
  worked over the ruins of Khara-Kora, the City of the Black Stones in the
  northern Gobi, once capital of the Empire of Genghis Khan.</p>

  <p>The talk had veered to werewolves, vampires, fox-women, and similar
  superstitions. Directed thence by a cabled report of measures to be taken
  against the Leopard Society, the murderous fanatics who drew on the skins of
  leopards, crouched like them on the boughs of trees, then launched themselves
  down upon their victims tearing their throats with talons of steel. That, and
  another report of a "hex-murder" in Pennsylvania where a woman had been
  beaten to death because it was thought she could assume the shape of a cat
  and cast evil spells upon those into whose houses, as cat, she crept.</p>

  <p>Caranac said: "It is a deep-rooted belief, an immeasurably ancient, that a
  man or woman may assume the shape of an animal, a serpent, a bird, even an
  insect. It was believed of old everywhere, and everywhere it is still
  believed by some&mdash;fox-men and fox-women of China and Japan, wolf-people,
  the badger and bird people of our own Indians. Always there has been the idea
  that there is a borderland between the worlds of consciousness of man and of
  beast&mdash;a borderland where shapes can be changed and man merge into beast
  or beast into man."</p>

  <p>MacLeod said: "The Egyptians had some good reason for equipping their
  deities with the heads of birds and beasts and insects. Why did they portray
  Khepher the Oldest God with the head of a beetle? Why give Anubis, the
  Psychopomp, Guide of the Dead, the head of a jackal? Or Thoth, the God of
  Wisdom, the head of an ibis; and Horus, the Divine son of Isis and Osiris,
  the head of a hawk? Set, God of Evil, a crocodile's and the Goddess Bast a
  cat's? There was a reason for all of that. But about it one can only
  guess."</p>

  <p>Caranac said: "I think there's something in that borderland, or
  borderline, idea. There's more or less of the beast, the reptile, the bird,
  the insect in everybody. I've known men who looked like rats and had the
  souls of rats. I've known women who belonged to the horse family, and showed
  it in face and voice. Distinctly there are bird people&mdash;hawk-faced,
  eagle-faced&mdash;predatory. The owl people seem to be mostly men and the
  wren people women. There are quite as distinct wolf and serpent types.
  Suppose some of these have their animal element so strongly developed that
  they can cross this borderline&mdash;become at times the animal? There you
  have the explanation of the werewolf, the snake-woman, and all the others.
  What could be more simple?"</p>

  <p>Winston asked: "But you're not serious, Caranac?"</p>

  <p>Caranac laughed. "At least half serious. Once I had a friend with an
  uncannily acute perception of these animal qualities in the human. He saw
  people less in terms of humanity than in terms of beast or bird. Animal
  consciousness that either shared the throne of human consciousness or sat
  above it or below it in varying degrees. It was an uncomfortable gift. He was
  like a doctor who has the faculty of visual diagnosis so highly developed
  that he constantly sees men and women and children not as they are but as
  diseases. Ordinarily he could control the faculty. But sometimes, as he would
  describe it, when he was in the Subway, or on a bus, or in the theater
  &mdash;or even sitting t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with a pretty woman,
  there would be a swift haze and when it had cleared he was among rats and
  foxes, wolves and serpents, cats and tigers and birds, all dressed in human
  garb but with nothing else at all human about them. The clear-cut picture
  lasted only for a moment&mdash;but it was a highly disconcerting moment."</p>

  <p>Winston said, incredulously: "Do you mean to suggest that in an instant
  the musculature and skeleton of a man can become the musculature and skeleton
  of a wolf? The skin sprout fur? Or in the matter of your bird people,
  feathers? In an instant grow wings and the specialized muscles to use them?
  Sprout fangs... noses become snouts..."</p>

  <p>Caranac grinned. "No, I don't mean anything of the sort. What I do suggest
  is that under certain conditions the animal part of this dual nature of man
  may submerge the human part to such a degree that a sensitive observer will
  think he sees the very creature which is its type. Just as in the case of the
  friend whose similar sensitivity I have described."</p>

  <p>Winston raised his hands in mock admiration. "Ah, at last modern science
  explains the legend of Circe! Circe the enchantress who gave men a drink that
  changed them into beasts. Her potion intensified whatever animal or what-not
  soul that was within them so that the human form no longer registered upon
  the eyes and brains of those who looked upon them. I agree with you, Caranac
  &mdash;what could be more simple? But I do not use the word simple in the
  same sense you did."</p>

  <p>Caranac answered, amused: "Yet, why not? Potions of one sort or another,
  rites of one sort or another, usually accompany such transformations in the
  stories. I've seen drinks and drugs that did pretty nearly the same thing and
  with no magic or sorcery about them&mdash;did it almost to the line of the
  visual illusion."</p>

  <p>Winston began heatedly: "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hewitt interrupted him: "Will the opposing counsel kindly shut up and
  listen to expert testimony. Caranac, I'm grateful to you. You've given me
  courage to tell of something which never in God's world would I have told if
  it were not for what you've been saying. I don't know whether you're right or
  not, but man&mdash;you've knocked a hag off my shoulders who's been riding
  them for months! The thing happened about four months before I left
  Abyssinia. I was returning to Addis Ababa. With my bearers I was in the
  western jungles. We came to a village and camped. That night my headman came
  to me. He was in a state of nerves. He begged that we would go from there at
  dawn. I wanted to rest for a day or two, and asked why. He said the village
  had a priest who was a great wizard. On the nights of the full moon the
  priest turned himself into a hyena and went hunting. For human food, the
  headman whispered. The villagers were safe, because he protected them. But
  others weren't. And the next night was the first of the full moon. The men
  were frightened. Would I depart at dawn?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't laugh at him. Ridiculing the beliefs of the bush gets you less
  than nowhere. I listened gravely, and then assured him that my magic was
  greater than the wizard's. He wasn't satisfied, but he shut up. Next day I
  went looking for the priest. When I found him I thought I knew how he'd been
  able to get that fine story started and keep the natives believing it. If any
  man ever looked like a hyena he did. Also, he wore over his shoulders the
  skin of one of the biggest of the beasts I'd ever seen, its head grinning at
  you over his head. You could hardly tell its teeth and his apart. I suspected
  he had filed his teeth to make 'em match. And he smelled like a hyena. It
  makes my stomach turn even now. It was the hide of course&mdash;or so I
  thought then."</p>

  <p>"Well, I squatted down in front of him and we looked at each other for
  quite a while. He said nothing, and the more I looked at him the less he was
  like a man and more like the beast around his shoulders. I didn't like it
  &mdash;I'm frank to say I didn't. It sort of got under my skin. I was the
  first to weaken. I stood up and tapped my rifle. I said, 'I do not like
  hyenas. You understand me.' And I tapped my rifle again. If he was thinking
  of putting over some similar kind of hocus-pocus that would frighten my men
  still more, I wanted to nip it in the bud. He made no answer, only kept
  looking at me. I walked away."</p>

  <p>"The men were pretty jittery all day, and they got worse when night began
  to fall. I noted there was not the usual cheerful twilight bustle that
  characterizes the native village. The people went into their huts early. Half
  an hour after dark, it was as though deserted. My camp was in a clearing just
  within the stockade. My bearers gathered close together around their fire. I
  sat on a pile of boxes where I could look over the whole clearing. I had one
  rifle on my knee and another beside me. Whether it was the fear that crept
  out from the men around the fire like an exhalation, or whether it had been
  that queer suggestion of shift of shape from man to beast while I was
  squatting in front of the priest I don't know&mdash;but the fact remained
  that I felt mighty uneasy. The headman crouched beside, long knife in
  hand."</p>

  <p>"After a while the moon rose up from behind the trees and shone down on
  the clearing. Then, abruptly, at its edge, not a hundred feet away I saw the
  priest. There was something disconcerting about the abruptness with which he
  had appeared. One moment there had been nothing, then&mdash;there he was. The
  moon gleamed on the teeth of the hyena's head and upon his. Except for that
  skin he was stark naked and his teeth glistened as though oiled. I felt the
  headman shivering against me like a frightened dog and I heard his teeth
  chattering."</p>

  <p>"And then there was a swift haze&mdash;that was what struck me so forcibly
  in what you told of your sensitive friend, Caranac. It cleared as swiftly and
  there wasn't any priest. No. But there was a big hyena standing where he had
  been&mdash;standing on its hind feet like a man and looking at me. I could
  see its hairy body. It held its forelegs over its shaggy chest as though
  crossed. And the reek of it came to me&mdash;thick. I didn't reach for my
  gun&mdash;I never thought of it, my mind in the grip of some incredulous
  fascination."</p>

  <p>"The beast opened its jaws. It grinned at me. Then it walked&mdash; walked
  is exactly the word&mdash;six paces, dropped upon all fours, trotted
  leisurely into the bush, and vanished there."</p>

  <p>"I managed to shake off the spell that had held me, took my flash and gun
  and went over to where the brute had been. The ground was soft and wet. There
  were prints of a man's feet and hands. As though the man had crawled from the
  bush on all fours. There were the prints of two feet close together, as
  though he had stood there erect. And then&mdash;there were the prints of the
  paws of a hyena."</p>

  <p>"Six of them, evenly spaced, as though the beast had walked six paces upon
  its hind legs. And after that only the spoor of the hyena trotting with its
  unmistakable sidewise slinking gait upon all four legs. There were no further
  marks of man's feet&mdash;nor were marks of human feet going back from where
  the priest had stood."</p>

  <p>Hewitt stopped. Winston asked: "And is that all?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt said, as though he had not heard him: "Now, Caranac, would you say
  that the animal soul in this wizard was a hyena? And that I had seen that
  animal soul? Or that when I had sat with him that afternoon he had implanted
  in my mind the suggestion that at such a place I would see him as a hyena?
  And that I did?"</p>

  <p>Caranac answered: "Either is an explanation. I rather hold to the
  first."</p>

  <p>Hewitt asked: "Then how do you explain the change of the human foot marks
  into those of the beast?"</p>

  <p>Winston asked: "Did anyone but you see those prints?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt said: "No. For obvious reasons I did not show them to the
  headman."</p>

  <p>Winston said: "I hold then to the hypnotism theory. The foot marks were a
  part of the same illusion."</p>

  <p>Hewitt said: "You asked if that was all. Well, it wasn't. When dawn came
  and there was a muster of men, one was missing. We found him&mdash;what was
  left of him&mdash;a quarter mile away in the bush. Some animal had crept into
  the camp&mdash;neatly crushed his throat and dragged him away without
  awakening anybody. Without even me knowing it&mdash;and I had not slept.
  Around his body were the tracks of an unusually big hyena. Without doubt that
  was what had killed and partly eaten him."</p>

  <p>"Coincidence," muttered Winston.</p>

  <p>"We followed the tracks of the brute," went on Hewitt. "We found a pool at
  which it had drunk. We traced the tracks to the edge of the pool.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. Winston asked, impatiently: "But?"</p>

  <p>"But we didn't find them going back. There were the marks of a naked human
  foot going back. But there were no marks of human feet pointing toward the
  pool. Also, the prints of the human feet were exactly those which had ended
  in the spoor of the hyena at the edge of the clearing. I know that because
  the left big toe was off."</p>

  <p>Caranac asked: "And then what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Took up our packs and beat it. The headman and the others had
  seen the footprints. There was no holding them after that. So your idea of
  hypnotism hardly holds here, Winston. I doubt whether a half dozen or less
  had seen the priest. But they all saw the tracks."</p>

  <p>"Mass hallucination. Faulty observation. A dozen rational explanations,"
  said Winston.</p>

  <p>MacLeod spoke, the precise diction of the distinguished curator submerged
  under the Gaelic burr and idioms that came to the surface always when he was
  deeply moved:</p>

  <p>"And is it so, Martin Hewitt? Well, now I will be telling you a story. A
  thing that I saw with my own eyes. I hold with you, Alan Caranac, but I go
  further. You say that man's consciousness may share the brain with other
  consciousness&mdash;beast or bird or what not. I say it may be that all life
  is one. A single force, but a thinking and conscious force of which the
  trees, the beasts, the flowers, germs and man and everything living are
  parts, just as the billions of living cells in a man are parts of him. And
  that under certain conditions the parts may be interchangeable. And that this
  may be the source of the ancient tales of the dryads and the nymphs, the
  harpies and the werewolves and their kind as well."</p>

  <p>"Now, listen. My people came from the Hebrides where they know more of
  some things than books can teach. When I was eighteen I entered a little mid-
  west college. My roommate was a lad named&mdash;well, I'll just be calling
  him Ferguson. There was a professor with ideas you would not expect to find
  out there."</p>

  <p>"'Tell me how a fox feels that is being hunted by the hounds,' he would
  say. 'Or the rabbit that is stalked by the fox. Or give me a worm's eye view
  of a garden. Get out of yourselves. Imagination is the greatest gift of the
  gods,' he said, 'and it is also their greatest curse. But blessing or curse
  it is good to have. Stretch your consciousness and write for me what you see
  and feel.'"</p>

  <p>"Ferguson took to that job like a fly to sugar. What he wrote was not a
  man telling of a fox or hare or hawk&mdash;it was fox and hare and hawk
  speaking through a man's hand. It was not only the emotions of the creatures
  he described. It was what they saw and heard and smelt and how they saw and
  heard and smelt it. And what they&mdash;thought."</p>

  <p>"The class would laugh, or be spellbound. But the professor didn't laugh.
  No. After a while he began to look worried and he would have long talks in
  private with Ferguson. And I would say to him: 'In God's name how do you do
  it, Ferg? You make it all seem so damned real.'"</p>

  <p>"'It is real,' he told me. 'I chase with the hounds and I run with the
  hare. I set my mind on some animal and after a bit I am one with it. Inside
  it. Literally. As though I had slipped outside myself. And when I slip back
  inside myself&mdash;I remember.'"</p>

  <p>"'Don't tell me you think you change into one of these beasts!' I said. He
  hesitated. 'Not my body,' he answered at last. 'But I know my mind... soul...
  spirit... whatever you choose to call it&mdash;must.'"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't argue the matter. And I know he didn't tell me all he knew.
  And suddenly the professor stopped those peculiar activities, without
  explanation. A few weeks later I left college."</p>

  <p>"That was over thirty years ago. About ten years ago, I was sitting in my
  office when my secretary told me that a man named Ferguson who said he was an
  old schoolmate was asking to see me. I remembered him at once and had him in.
  I blinked at him when he entered. The Ferguson I'd known had been a lean,
  wiry, dark, square-chinned, and clean-cut chap. This man wasn't like that at
  all. His hair was a curious golden, and extremely fine&mdash;almost a fuzz.
  His face was oval and flattish with receding chin. He wore oversized dark
  glasses and they gave the suggestion of a pair of fly's eyes seen under a
  microscope. Or rather&mdash;I thought suddenly&mdash;of a bee's. But I felt a
  real shock when I grasped his hand. It felt less like a man's hand than the
  foot of some insect, and as I looked down at it I saw that it also was
  covered with the fine yellow fuzz of hair. He said:"</p>

  <p>"'Hello, MacLeod, I was afraid you wouldn't remember me.'"</p>

  <p>"It was Ferguson's voice as I remembered it, and yet it wasn't. There was
  a queer, muffled humming and buzzing running through it."</p>

  <p>"But it was Ferguson all right. He soon proved that. He did more talking
  than I, because that odd inhuman quality of the voice in some way distressed
  me, and I couldn't take my eyes off his hands with their yellow fuzz, nor the
  spectacled, eyes and the fine yellow hair. It appeared that he had bought a
  farm over in New Jersey. Not so much for farming as for a place for his
  apiary. He had gone in for bee keeping. He said: 'I've tried all sorts of
  animals. In fact I've tried more than animals. You see Mac&mdash;there's
  nothing in being human. Nothing but sorrow. And the animals aren't so happy.
  So I'm concentrating on the bee. A drone, Mac. A short life but an
  exceedingly merry one.'"</p>

  <p>"I said: 'What in the hell are you talking about?'"</p>

  <p>"He laughed, a buzzing, droning laugh. 'You know damned well. You were
  always interested in my little excursions, Mac. Intelligently interested. I
  never told you a hundredth of the truth about them. But come and see next
  Wednesday and maybe your curiosity will be satisfied. I think you'll find it
  worth while.'"</p>

  <p>"Well, there was a bit more talk and he went out. He'd given me minute
  directions how to get to his place. As he walked to the door I had the
  utterly incredulous idea that around him was a droning and humming like an
  enormous bagpipe, muted."</p>

  <p>"My curiosity, or something deeper, was tremendously aroused. That
  Wednesday I drove to his place. A lovely spot&mdash;all flowers and blossom-
  trees. There were a couple of hundred skips of bees set out in a broad
  orchard. Ferguson met me. He looked fuzzier and yellower than before. Also,
  the drone and hum of his voice seemed stronger. He took me into his house. It
  was an odd enough place. All one high room, and what windows there were had
  been shuttered&mdash;all except one. There was a dim golden-white light
  suffusing it. Nor was its door the ordinary door. It was low and broad. All
  at once it came to me that it was like the inside of a hive. The unshuttered
  window looks out upon the hives. It was screened."</p>

  <p>"He brought me food and drink&mdash;honey and honeymead, cakes sweet with
  honey, and fruit. He said: 'I do not eat meat.'"</p>

  <p>"He began to talk. About the life of the bee. Of the utter happiness of
  the drone, darting through the sun, sipping at what flowers it would, fed by
  its sisters, drinking of the honey cups in the hive... free and careless and
  its nights and days only a smooth clicking of rapturous seconds..."</p>

  <p>"'What if they do kill you at the end?' he said. 'You have lived&mdash;
  every fraction of a second of time. And then the rapture of the nuptial
  flight. Drone upon drone winging through the air on the track of the virgin!
  Life pouring stronger and stronger into you with each stroke of the wing! And
  at last... the flaming ecstasy... the flaming ecstasy of the fiery inner core
  of life... cheating death. True, death strikes when you are at the tip of the
  flame... but he strikes too late. You die&mdash;but what of that? You have
  cheated death. You do not know it is death that strikes. You die in the heart
  of the ecstasy... '"</p>

  <p>"He stopped. From outside came a faint sustained roaring that steadily
  grew stronger. The beating of thousands upon thousands of bee wings... the
  roaring of hundreds of thousands of tiny planes..."</p>

  <p>"Ferguson leaped to the window."</p>

  <p>"'The swarms! The swarms!' he cried. A tremor shook him, another and
  another&mdash;more and more rapidly... became a rhythm pulsing faster and
  faster. His arms, outstretched, quivered... began to beat up and down, ever
  more rapidly until they were like the blur of the hummingbird's wings... like
  the blur of a bee's wings. His voice came to me... buzzing, humming... And
  tomorrow the virgins fly... the nuptial flight... I must be there... must...
  mzzz... mzzz... bzzz... bzzzzzzz... zzzzmmmm... '"</p>

  <p>"For an instant there was no man there at the window. No. There was only a
  great drone buzzing and humming... striving to break through the screen... go
  free..."</p>

  <p>"And then Ferguson toppled backward. Fell. The thick glasses were torn
  away by his fall. Two immense black eyes, not human eyes but the multiple
  eyes of the bee stared up at me.</p>

  <p>"I bent down closer, closer, I listened for his heart beat. There was
  none. He was dead."</p>

  <p>"Then slowly, slowly the dead mouth opened."</p>

  <p>Through the lips came the questing head of a drone... antennae wavering...
  eyes regarding me. It crawled out from between the lips. A handsome drone...
  a strong drone. It rested for a breath on the lips, then its wings began to
  vibrate... faster, faster...</p>

  <p>"It flew from the lips of Ferguson and circled my head once and twice and
  thrice. It flashed to the window and clung to the screen, buzzing, crawling,
  beating its wings against it..."</p>

  <p>"There was a knife on the table. I took it and ripped the screen. The
  drone darted out&mdash;and was gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I turned and looked down at Ferguson. His eyes stared up at me. Dead
  eyes. But no longer black... blue as I had known them of old. And human. His
  hair was no longer the fine golden fuzz of the bee&mdash;it was black as it
  had been when I had first known him. And his hands were white and sinewy and
  &mdash;hairless."</p><br>

  <h3>First published in <i>Fantasy Magazine</i>, April 1934<br>
  Also published as "Rhythm Of The Spheres" (<i>Thrilling Wonder Stories</i>,
  October 1936)</h3><br>

  <p class="first">NARODNY, the Russian, sat in his laboratory. Narodny's
  laboratory was a full mile under earth. It was one of a hundred caverns, some
  small and some vast, cut out of the living rock. It was a realm of which he
  was sole ruler. In certain caverns garlands of small suns shone; and in
  others little moons waxed and waned over earth; and there was a cavern in
  which reigned perpetual dawn, dewy, over lily beds and violets and roses; and
  another in which crimson sunsets baptized in the blood of slain day dimmed
  and died and were born again behind the sparkling curtains of the aurora. And
  there was one cavern ten miles from side to side in which grew flowering
  trees and trees which bore fruits unknown to man for many generations. Over
  this great orchard one yellow sun-like orb shone, and clouds trailed veils of
  rain upon the trees and miniature thunder drummed at Narodny's summoning.</p>

  <p>Narodny was a poet&mdash;the last poet. He did not write his poems in
  words but in colors, sounds, and visions made material. Also he was a great
  scientist. In his peculiar field the greatest. Thirty years before, Russia's
  Science Council had debated whether to grant him the leave of absence he had
  asked, or to destroy him. They knew him to be unorthodox. How deadly so they
  did not know, else after much deliberation they would not have released him.
  It must be remembered that of all nations, Russia then was the most
  mechanized; most robot-ridden.</p>

  <p>Narodny did not hate mechanization. He was indifferent to it. Being truly
  intelligent he hated nothing, Also he was indifferent to the whole
  civilization man had developed and into which he had been born. He had no
  feeling of kinship to humanity. Outwardly, in body, he belonged to the
  species. Not so in mind. Like Loeb, a thousand years before, he considered
  mankind a race of crazy half-monkeys, intent upon suicide. Now and then, out
  of the sea of lunatic mediocrity, a wave uplifted that held for a moment a
  light from the sun of truth&mdash;but soon it sank back and the light was
  gone. Quenched in the sea of stupidity. He knew that he was one of those
  waves.</p>

  <p>He had gone, and he had been lost to sight by all. In a few years he was
  forgotten. Fifteen years ago, unknown and under another name, he had entered
  America and secured rights to a thousand acres in what of old had been called
  Westchester. He had picked this place because investigation had revealed to
  him that of ten localities on this planet it was most free from danger of
  earthquake or similar seismic disturbance. The man who owned it had been
  whimsical; possibly an atavist&mdash;like Narodny, although Narodny would
  never have thought of himself as that. At any rate, instead of an angled
  house of glass such as the thirtieth century built, this man had
  reconstructed a rambling old stone house of the nineteenth century. Few
  people lived upon the open land in those days; most had withdrawn into the
  city-states. New York, swollen by its meals of years, was a fat belly full of
  mankind still many miles away. The land around the house was
  forest-covered.</p>

  <p>A week after Narodny had taken this house, the trees in front of it had
  melted away leaving a three-acre, smooth field. It was not as though they had
  been cut, but as though they had been dissolved. Later that night a great
  airship had appeared upon this field&mdash;abruptly, as though it had blinked
  out of another dimension. It was rocket-shaped but noiseless. And immediately
  a fog had fallen upon airship and house, hiding them. Within this fog, if one
  could have seen, was a wide tunnel leading from the air-cylinder's door to
  the door of the house. And out of the airship came swathed figures, ten of
  them, who walked along that tunnel, were met by Narodny, and the door of the
  old house closed on them.</p>

  <p>A little later they returned, Narodny with them, and out of an opened
  hatch of the airship rolled a small flat car on which was a mechanism of
  crystal cones rising around each other to a central cone some four feet high.
  The cones were upon a thick base of some glassy material in which was
  imprisoned a restless green radiance. Its rays did not penetrate that which
  held it, but it seemed constantly seeking, with suggestion of prodigious
  force, to escape. For hours the strange thick fog held. Twenty miles up in
  the far reaches of the stratosphere, a faintly sparkling cloud grew, like a
  condensation of cosmic dust. And just before dawn the rock of the hill behind
  the house melted away like a curtain that had covered a great tunnel. Five of
  the men came out of the house and went into the airship. It lifted silently
  from the ground, slipped into the aperture and vanished. There was a
  whispering sound, and when it had died away the breast of the hill was whole
  again. The rocks had been drawn together like a closing curtain and boulders
  studded it as before. That the breast was now slightly concave where before
  it had been convex, none would have noticed.</p>

  <p>For two weeks the sparkling cloud was observed far up in the stratosphere,
  was commented upon idly, and then was seen no more. Narodny's caverns were
  finished.</p>

  <p>Half of the rock from which they had been hollowed had gone with that
  sparkling cloud. The balance, reduced to its primal form of energy, was
  stored in blocks of the vitreous material that had supported the cones, and
  within them it moved as restlessly and always with that same suggestion of
  prodigious force. And it was force, unthinkably potent; from it came the
  energy that made the little suns and moons, and actuated the curious
  mechanisms that regulated pressure in the caverns, supplied the air, created
  the rain, and made of Narodny's realm a mile deep under earth the Paradise of
  poetry, of music, of color and of form which he had conceived in his brain
  and with the aid of those ten others had caused to be.</p>

  <p>Now of the ten there is no need to speak further. Narodny was the Master.
  But three, like him, were Russians; two were Chinese; of the remaining five,
  three were women&mdash;one German in ancestry, one Basque, one an Eurasian; a
  Hindu who traced his descent from the line of Gautama; a Jew who traced his
  from Solomon.</p>

  <p>All were one with Narodny in indifference to the world; each with him in
  his viewpoint on life; and each and all lived in his or her own Eden among
  the hundred caverns except when it interested them to work with each other.
  Time meant nothing to them. Their researches and discoveries were solely for
  their own uses and enjoyments. If they had given them to the outer world they
  would have only been ammunition for warfare either between men upon Earth or
  men against some other planet. Why hasten humanity's suicide? Not that they
  would have felt regret at the eclipse of humanity. But why trouble to
  expedite it? Time meant nothing to them because they could live as long as
  they desired&mdash;barring accident. And while there was rock in the world,
  Narodny could convert it into energy to maintain his Paradise&mdash;or to
  create others.</p>

  <p>The old house began to crack and crumble. It fell&mdash;much more quickly
  than the elements could have brought about its destruction. Then trees grew
  among the ruins of its foundations; and the field that had been so strangely
  cleared was overgrown with trees. The land became a wood in a few short
  years; silent except for the roar of an occasional rocket passing over it and
  the songs of birds that had found there a sanctuary.</p>

  <p>But deep down in earth, within the caverns, were music and song and mirth
  and beauty. Gossamer nymphs circled under the little moons. Pan piped. There
  was revelry of antique harvesters under the small suns. Grapes grew and
  ripened, were pressed, and red and purple wine was drunk by Bacchantes who
  fell at last asleep in the arms of fauns and satyrs. Oreads danced under the
  pale moon-bows and sometimes Centaurs wheeled and trod archaic measures
  beneath them to the drums of their hoofs upon the mossy floor. The old Earth
  lived again.</p>

  <p>Narodny listened to drunken Alexander raving to Thais among the splendors
  of conquered Persepolis; and he heard the crackling of the flames that at the
  whim of the courtesan destroyed it. He watched the siege of Troy and counted
  with Homer the Achaean ships drawn up on the strand before Troy's walls; or
  saw with Herodotus the tribes that marched behind Xerxes&mdash;the Caspians
  in their cloaks of skin with their bows of cane; the Ethiopians in the skins
  of leopards with spears of antelope horns; the Libyans in their dress of
  leather with javelins made hard by fire; the Thracians with the heads of
  foxes upon their heads; the Moschians who wore helmets made of wood and the
  Cabalians who wore the skulls of men. For him the Eleusinian and the Osirian
  mysteries were re-enacted, and he watched the women of Thrace tear to
  fragments Orpheus, the first great musician. At his will, he could see the
  rise and fall of the Empire of the Aztecs, the Empire of the Incas; or
  beloved Caesar slain in Rome's Senate; or the archers at Agincourt; or the
  Americans in Belleau Wood. Whatever man had written&mdash;whether poets,
  historians, philosophers or scientists&mdash;his strangely shaped mechanisms
  could bring before him, changing the words into phantoms real as though
  living.</p>

  <p>He was the last and greatest of the poets&mdash;but also he was the last
  and greatest of the musicians. He could bring back the songs of ancient
  Egypt, or the chants of more ancient Ur. The songs that came from
  Moussorgsky's soul of Mother-earth, the harmonies of Beethoven's deaf ear, or
  the chants and rhapsodies from the heart of Chopin. He could do more than
  restore the music of the past. He was master of sound. To him, the music of
  the spheres was real. He could take the rays of the stars and planets and
  weave them into symphonies. Or convert the sun's rays into golden tones no
  earthly orchestras had ever expressed. And the silver music of the moon
  &mdash;the sweet music of the moon of spring, the full-throated music of the
  harvest moon, the brittle crystalling music of the winter moon with its
  arpeggios of meteors&mdash;he could weave into strains such as no human ears
  had ever heard.</p>

  <p>So Narodny, the last and greatest of poets, the last and greatest of
  musicians, the last and greatest of artists&mdash;and in his inhuman way, the
  greatest of scientists&mdash;lived with the ten of his choosing in his
  caverns. And, with them, he consigned the surface of earth and all who dwelt
  upon it to a negative Hell&mdash;Unless something happening there might
  imperil his Paradise!</p>

  <p>Aware of the possibility of that danger, among his mechanisms were those
  which brought to eyes and ears news of what was happening on earth's surface.
  Now and then, they amused themselves with these.</p>

  <p>It so happened that on that night when the Warper of Space had dealt his
  blow at the space ships and had flung a part of the great Crater of
  Copernicus into another dimension, Narodny had been weaving the rays of Moon,
  Jupiter and Saturn into Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. The moon was a four-day
  crescent. Jupiter was at one cusp, and Saturn hung like a pendant below the
  bow. Shortly Orion would stride across the Heavens and bright Regulus and red
  Aldebaran, the Eye of the Bull, would furnish him with other chords of
  starlight remoulded into sound.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the woven rhythms were ripped&mdash;hideously. A devastating
  indescribable dissonance invaded the cavern. Beneath it, the nymphs who had
  been dancing languorously to the strains quivered like mist wraiths in a
  sudden blast and were gone: the little moons flared, then ceased to glow. The
  tonal instruments were dead. And Narodny was felled as though by a blow.</p>

  <p>After a time the little moons began to glow again, but dimly; and from the
  tonal mechanisms came broken, crippled music. Narodny stirred and sat up, his
  lean, high-cheeked face more Satanic than ever. Every nerve was numb; then as
  they revived, agony crept along them. He sat, fighting the agony, until he
  could summon help. He was answered by one of the Chinese, and soon Narodny
  was himself again.</p>

  <p>He said: "It was a spatial disturbance, Lao. And it was like nothing I
  have ever known. It came in upon the rays, of that I am sure. Let us look out
  upon the moon."</p>

  <p>They passed to another cavern and stood before an immense television
  screen. They adjusted it, and upon it appeared the moon, rapidly growing
  larger as though it were hurtling toward them. Then upon the screen appeared
  a space-ship speeding earthward. They focused upon it, and opened it to their
  vision; searching it until they came to the control room where were
  Bartholomew, James Tarvish and Martin, their gaze upon Earth rapidly and more
  rapidly expanding in the heavens. Narodny and the Chinese watched them,
  reading their lips. Tarvish said: "Where can we land, Martin? The robots will
  be watching for us everywhere. They will see to it that we are destroyed
  before we can give our message and our warning to the world. They control the
  governments&mdash;or at least control them sufficiently to seize us upon
  landing. And if we should escape and gather men around us, then it means
  civil war and that in turn means fatal delay in the building of the space
  fleet&mdash;even if we should win."</p>

  <p>Martin said: "We must land safely&mdash;escape the robots&mdash;find some
  to control or destroy them. God, Tarvish&mdash;you saw what that devil they
  call the Wrongness of Space can do. He threw the side of the crater out of
  our dimension as a boy would throw a stone into a pond!"</p>

  <p>Bartholomew said: "He could take Earth and break it up piecemeal!"</p>

  <p>Narodny and Lao looked at each other. Narodny said: "That is enough. We
  know." The Chinese nodded. Narodny said: "I estimated that they would reach
  Earth in four hours." Again Lao nodded. Narodny said: "We will talk to them,
  Lao; although I had thought we were done with mankind. I do not like this
  which they call so quaintly the Wrongness of Space&mdash;nor the stone he
  threw into my music."</p>

  <p>They brought a smaller screen into position before the larger one. They
  oriented it to the speeding space-ship and stepped in front of it. The small
  screen shimmered with whirling vortices of pallid blue luminescence; the
  vortices drew together and became one vast cone that reached on and on to the
  greater screen as though not feet but thousands of miles separated them. And
  as the tip of the cone touched the control room of the space-ship mirrored in
  the screen, Tarvish, upon the actual ship, gripped Martin's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look there!"</p>

  <p>There was an eddying in the air, like that over roads on a hot summer day.
  The eddying became a shimmering curtain of pallid blue luminescence&mdash;
  steadied until it was an oval doorway opening into vast distances. And then
  abruptly, within that doorway, stood two men&mdash;one tall and lean and
  saturnine with the sensitive face of a dreamer and the other a Chinese, his
  head a great yellow dome and on his face the calm of Buddha&mdash;and it was
  strange indeed to see in the cavern of earth these same two men standing
  before the blue-coned screen and upon the greater one their images within the
  imaged room on which the tip of the cone rested.</p>

  <p>Narodny spoke, and in his voice there was a human indifference and
  sureness that chilled them, yet gave them courage. He said: "We mean you no
  harm. You cannot harm us. We have long been withdrawn from men. What happens
  on the surface of Earth means nothing to us. What may happen beneath the
  surface means much. Whatever it is you have named the Wrongness of Space has
  already annoyed me. I perceive that he can do more than annoy. I gather that
  the robots in one way or another are on his side. You are against him.
  Therefore, our first step must be to help you against the robots. Place me in
  possession of all facts. Be brief, for we cannot maintain our position here
  for more than half an hour without discomfort."</p>

  <p>Martin said: "Whoever you are, wherever you are, we trust you. Here is the
  story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For fifteen minutes Narodny and the Chinese listened to their tale of
  struggle against the robots, of their escape and of the blasting of
  Copernicus in the effort of the Wrongness of Space to prevent their
  return.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Enough. Now I understand. How long can you remain in space?
  I mean&mdash;what are your margins of power and of food?"</p>

  <p>Martin answered: "Six days."</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Ample time for success&mdash;or failure. Remain aloft for
  that time, then descend to where you started&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he smiled: "I care nothing for mankind&mdash;yet I would not harm
  them, willingly. And it has occurred to me that I owe them, after all, a
  great debt. Except for them&mdash;I would not be. Also, it occurs to me that
  the robots have never produced a poet, a musician, an artist&mdash;" He
  laughed: "But it is in my mind that they are capable of one great art at
  least! We shall see."</p>

  <p>The oval was abruptly empty; then it too was gone. Bartholomew said: "Call
  the others. I am for obeying. But they must know." And when the others had
  heard, they too voted to obey, and the space-ship, course changed, began to
  circle, as slowly as it could, the earth.</p>

  <p>Down in the chamber of the screens, Narodny laughed and laughed again. He
  said: "Lao, is it that we have advanced so in these few years? Or that men
  have retrogressed? No, it is this curse of mechanization that destroys
  imagination. For look you, how easy is this problem of the robots. They began
  as man-made machines. Mathematical, soulless, insensible to any emotion. So
  was primal matter of which all on earth are made, rock and water, tree and
  grass, metal, animal, fish, worm, and men. But somewhere, somehow, something
  was added to this primal matter, combined with it&mdash;used it. It was what
  we call life. And life is consciousness. And therefore largely emotion. Life
  established its rhythm&mdash;and its rhythm being different in rock and
  crystal, metal, fish, and so on, and man, we have these varying things.</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems that life has begun to establish its rhythm in the robots.
  Consciousness has touched them. The proof? They have established the idea of
  common identity&mdash;group consciousness. That in itself involves emotion.
  But they have gone further. They have attained the instinct of self-
  preservation. And that, my wise friend, connotes fear&mdash;fear of
  extinction. And fear connotes anger, hatred, arrogance&mdash;and many other
  things. The robots, in short, have become emotional to a degree. And
  therefore vulnerable to whatever may amplify and control their emotions. They
  are no longer mechanisms.</p>

  <p>"So, Lao, I have in mind an experiment that will provide me study and
  amusement through many years. Originally, the robots are the children of
  mathematics. I ask&mdash;to what is mathematics most closely related. I
  answer&mdash;to rhythm&mdash;to sound&mdash;to sounds which will raise to the
  nth degree the rhythms to which they will respond. Both mathematically and
  emotionally,"</p>

  <p>Lao said: "The sonic sequences?"</p>

  <p>Narodny answered: "Exactly. But we must have a few with which to
  experiment. To do that means to dissolve the upper gate. But that is nothing.
  Tell Maringy and Euphroysne to do it. Net a ship and bring it here. Bring it
  down gently. You will have to kill the men in it, of course, but do it
  mercifully. Then let them bring me the robots. Use the green flame on one or
  two&mdash;the rest will follow, I'll warrant you."</p>

  <p>The hill behind where the old house had stood trembled. A circle of pale
  green light gleamed on its breast. It dimmed, where it had been was the black
  mouth of a tunnel. An airship, half-rocket, half-winged, making its way to
  New York, abruptly dropped, circled, and streaked back. It fell gently like a
  moth, close to the yawning mouth of the tunnel.</p>

  <p>Its door opened, and out came two men, pilots, cursing. There was a little
  sigh from the tunnel's mouth and a silvery misty cloud sped from it, over the
  pilots and straight through the opened door. The pilots staggered and
  crumpled to the ground. In the airship half a dozen other men slumped to the
  floor, smiled, and died.</p>

  <p>There were a full score robots in the ship. They stood, looking at the
  dead men and at each other. Out of the tunnel came two figures swathed in
  metallic glimmering robes. They entered the ship. One said:</p>

  <p>"Robots, assemble."</p>

  <p>The metal men stood, motionless. Then one sent out a shrill call. From all
  parts of the ship the metal men moved. They gathered behind the one who had
  sent the call. They stood behind him, waiting.</p>

  <p>In the hand of one of those who had come from the tunnel was what might
  have been an antique flash-light. From it sped a thin green flame. It struck
  the foremost robot on the head, sliced down from the head to base of trunk.
  Another flash, and the green flame cut him from side to side. He fell, sliced
  by that flame into four parts. The four parts lay, inert as their metal, upon
  the floor of the compartment.</p>

  <p>One of the shrouded figures said: "Do you want further demonstration
  &mdash;or will you follow us?"</p>

  <p>The robots put heads together; whispered. Then one said: "We will
  follow."</p>

  <p>They marched into the tunnel, the robots making no resistance nor effort
  to escape. Again there was the sighing, and the rocks closed the tunnel
  mouth. They came to a place whose floor sank with them until it had reached
  the caverns. The machine-men still went docilely. Was it because of curiosity
  mixed with disdain for these men whose bodies could be broken so easily by
  one blow of the metal appendages that served them for arms? Perhaps.</p>

  <p>They came to the cavern where Narodny and the others awaited them.
  Marinoff led them in and halted them. These were the robots used in the
  flying ships&mdash;their heads cylindrical, four arm appendages, legs triple
  jointed, torsos slender. The robots, it should be understood, were
  differentiated in shape according to their occupations. Narodny said:</p>

  <p>"Welcome, robots. Who is your leader?"</p>

  <p>One answered: "We have no leaders. We act as one."</p>

  <p>Narodny laughed: "Yet by speaking for them you have shown yourself leader.
  Step closer. Do not fear&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>The robot said: "We feel no fear. Why should we? Even if you should
  destroy us who are here, you cannot destroy the billions of us outside. Nor
  can you breed fast enough, become men soon enough, to cope with us who enter
  into life strong and complete from the beginning."</p>

  <p>He flicked an appendage toward Narodny and there was contempt in the
  gesture. But before he could draw it back a bracelet of green flame circled
  it at the shoulder. It had darted like a thrown loop from something in
  Narodny's hand. The robot's arm dropped clanging to the floor, cleanly
  severed. The robot stared at it unbelievingly, threw forward his other three
  arms to pick it up. Again the green flame encircled them, encircled also his
  legs above the second joints. The robot crumpled and pitched forward, crying
  in high-pitched shrill tones to the others.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the green flame played among them. Legless, armless, some
  decapitated, all the robots fell except two.</p>

  <p>"Two will be enough," said Narodny. "But they will not need arms&mdash;
  only feet."</p>

  <p>The flashing green bracelets encircled the appendages and excised them.
  The pair were marched away. The bodies of the others were taken apart,
  studied and under Narodny's direction curious experiments were made. Music
  filled the cavern, strange chords, unfamiliar progressions, shattering
  arpeggios and immense vibrations of sound that could be felt but not heard by
  the human ear. And finally this last deep vibration burst into hearing as a
  vast drone, hummed up and up into swift tingling tempest of crystalline
  brittle notes, and still ascending passed into shrill high pipings, and
  continued again unheard, as had the prelude to the droning. And thence it
  rushed back, the piping and the crystalline storm reversed, into the drone
  and the silence&mdash;then back and up.</p>

  <p>And the bodies of the broken robots began to quiver, to tremble, as though
  every atom within them were in ever increasing, rhythmic motion. Up rushed
  the music and down&mdash;again and again. If ended abruptly in midflight with
  one crashing note.</p>

  <p>The broken bodies ceased their quivering. Tiny starshaped cracks appeared
  in their metal. Once more the note sounded and the cracks widened. The metal
  splintered.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Well, there is the frequency for the rhythm of our robots.
  The destructive unison. I hope for the sake of the world outside it is not
  also the rhythm of many of their buildings and bridges. But after all, in any
  war there must be casualties on both sides."</p>

  <p>Lao said: "Earth will be an extraordinary spectacle for a few days."</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "It's going to be an extraordinarily uncomfortable Earth for
  a few days, and without doubt many will die and many more go mad. But is
  there any other way?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He said; "Bring in the two robots." They brought them
  in.</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "Robots&mdash;were there ever any of you who could
  poetize?"</p>

  <p>They answered: "What is poetize?" Narodny laughed: "Never mind. Have you
  ever sung&mdash;made music&mdash;painted? Have you ever&mdash; dreamed?"</p>

  <p>One robot said with cold irony: "Dreamed? No&mdash;for we do not sleep. We
  leave all that to men. It is why we have conquered them."</p>

  <p>Narodny said, almost gently: "Not yet, robot. Have you ever&mdash; danced?
  No? It is an art you are about to learn."</p>

  <p>The unheard note began, droned up and through the tempest and away and
  back again. And up and down&mdash;and up and down, though not so loudly as
  before. And suddenly the feet of the robots began to move, to shuffle. Their
  leg-joints bent; their bodies swayed. The note seemed to move now here and
  now there about the chamber, they always following it, grotesquely. Like huge
  metal marionettes, they followed it. The music ended in the crashing note.
  And it was as though every vibrating atom of the robot bodies had met some
  irresistible obstruction. Their bodies quivered and from their voice
  mechanisms came a shriek that was a hideous blend of machine and life. Once
  more the drone, and once more and once more and again the abrupt stop. There
  was a brittle crackling all over the conical heads, all over the bodies. The
  star-shaped splinterings appeared. Once again the drone&mdash;but the two
  robots stood, unresponding. For through the complicated mechanisms which
  under their carapaces animated them were similar splinterings.</p>

  <p>The robots were dead!</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "By tomorrow we can amplify the sonor to make it effective
  in a 3000-mile circle. We will use the upper cavern, of course. Equally of
  course, it means we must take the ship out again. In three days, Marinoff,
  you should be able to cover the other continents. See to it that the ship is
  completely proof against the vibrations. To work. We must act quickly&mdash;
  before the robots can discover how to neutralize them."</p>

  <p>It was exactly at noon next day that over all North America a deep
  unexplainable droning was heard. It seemed to come not only from deep within
  earth, but from every side. It mounted rapidly through a tempest of tingling
  crystalline notes into a shrill piping and was gone... then back it rushed
  from piping to the drone... then up and out and down... again and again. And
  over all North America the hordes of robots stopped in whatever they were
  doing. Stopped... and then began to dance. They danced in the airships and
  scores of those ships crashed before the human crews could gain control. They
  danced by the thousands in the streets of the cities&mdash;in grotesque
  rigadoons, in bizarre sarabands, with shuffle and hop, and jig the robots
  danced while the people fled in panic and hundreds of them were crushed and
  died in those panics. In the great factories, and in the tunnels of the lower
  cities, and in the mines&mdash;everywhere the sound was heard&mdash;and it
  was heard everywhere&mdash;the robots danced... to the piping of Narodny, the
  last great poet... the last great musician.</p>

  <p>And then came the crashing note&mdash;and over all the country the dance
  halted. And began again... and ceased... and began again...</p>

  <p>Until at last the streets, the lower tunnels of the lower levels, the
  mines, the factories, the homes, were littered with metal bodies shot through
  and through with star-shaped splinterings.</p>

  <p>In the cities the people cowered, not knowing what blow was to fall upon
  them... or milled about in fear-maddened crowds, and many more died...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the dreadful droning, the shattering tempest, the
  intolerable high piping ended. And everywhere the people fell, sleeping among
  the dead robots, as though they never had been strung to the point of
  breaking, sapped of strength and abruptly relaxed.</p>

  <p>As though it had vanished, America was deaf to cables, to all
  communication beyond the gigantic circle of sound.</p>

  <p>But that midnight over all Europe the drone sounded and Europe's robots
  began their dance of death... and when it had ended a strange and silent
  rocket ship that had hovered high above the stratosphere sped almost with the
  speed of light and hovered over Asia&mdash;and next day Africa heard the
  drone while the natives answered it with their tom-toms&mdash;then South
  America heard it and last of all far-off Australia... and everywhere terror
  trapped the peoples and panic and madness took their toll...</p>

  <p>Until of all that animate metal horde that had tethered Earth and humanity
  there were a few scant hundreds left&mdash;escaped from the death dance
  through some variant in their constitution. And, awakening from that swift
  sleep, all over Earth those who had feared and hated the robots and their
  slavery rose against those who had fostered the metal domination, and blasted
  the robot factories to dust.</p>

  <p>Again the hill above the caverns opened, the strange torpedo ship blinked
  into sight like a ghost, as silently as a ghost floated into the hill and the
  rocks closed behind it.</p>

  <p>Narodny and the others stood before the gigantic television screen,
  shifting upon it images of city after city, country after country, over all
  Earth's surface. Lao, the Chinese, said: "Many men died, but many are left.
  They may not understand&mdash;but to them it was worth it."</p>

  <p>Narodny mused: "It drives home the lesson, what man does not pay for, he
  values little. Our friends aloft will have little opposition now I
  think."</p>

  <p>He shook his head, doubtfully, "But I still do not like that Wrongness of
  Space. I do not want my music spoiled again by him, Lao. Shall we hurl the
  Moon out of the universe, Lao?"</p>

  <p>Lao laughed: "And what then would you do for moon-music?"</p>

  <p>Narodny said: "True. Well, let us see what men can do. There is always
  time&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>The difficulties which beset humanity did not interest the poet Narodny.
  While the world governments were reorganized&mdash;factories turned out space
  ships for Earth's fleet&mdash;men were trained in handling these
  ships&mdash;supplies were gathered&mdash;weapons were perfected&mdash; and
  when the message from Luna, outlining the course to be followed and setting
  the starting date, arrived, the space fleet of Earth was ready to leave.</p>

  <p>Narodny watched the ships take off. He shook his head, doubtfully. But
  soon harmonies were swelling through the great cavern of the orchards and
  nymphs and fauns dancing under the fragrant blossoming trees&mdash;and the
  world was again forgotten by Narodny.</p><hr>

  </div>

  <h3>First published in <i>All-Story Weekly</i>, August 9, 1919</h3><br>

  <p class="first">"BUT rich as was the war for surgical science," ended
  Hawtry, "opening up through mutilation and torture unexplored regions which
  the genius of man was quick to enter, and, entering, found ways to checkmate
  suffering and death &mdash;for always, my friend, the distillate from the
  blood of sacrifice is progress&mdash;great as all this was, the world tragedy
  has opened up still another region wherein even greater knowledge will be
  found. It was the clinic unsurpassed for the psychologist even more than for
  the surgeon."</p>

  <p>Latour, the great little French doctor, drew himself out of the depths of
  the big chair; the light from the fireplace fell ruddily upon his keen
  face.</p>

  <p>"That is true," he said. "Yes, that is true. There in the furnace the mind
  of man opened like a flower beneath a too glowing sun. Beaten about in that
  colossal tempest of primitive forces, caught in the chaos of energies both
  physical and psychical&mdash;which, although man himself was its creator,
  made of their maker a moth in a whirlwind&mdash;all those obscure, those
  mysterious factors of mind which men, for lack of knowledge, have named the
  soul, were stripped of their inhibitions and given power to appear.</p>

  <p>"How could it have been otherwise&mdash;when men and women, gripped by one
  shattering sorrow or joy, will manifest the hidden depths of spirit
  &mdash;how could it have been otherwise in that steadily maintained crescendo
  of emotion?" McAndrews spoke.</p>

  <p>"Just which psychological region do you mean, Hawtry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There were four of us in front of the fireplace of the Science Club
  &mdash;Hawtry, who rules the chair of psychology in one of our greatest
  colleges, and whose name is an honored one throughout the world; Latour, an
  immortal of France; McAndrews, the famous American surgeon whose work during
  the war has written a new page in the shining book of science; and myself.
  These are not the names of the three, but they are as I have described them;
  and I am pledged to identify them no further.</p>

  <p>"I mean the field of suggestion," replied the psychologist.</p>

  <p>"The mental reactions which reveal themselves as visions&mdash;an
  accidental formation in the clouds that becomes to the overwrought
  imaginations of the beholders the so-eagerly-prayed-for hosts of Joan of Arc
  marching out from heaven; moonlight in the cloud rift that becomes to the
  besieged a fiery cross held by the hands of archangels; the despair and hope
  that are transformed into such a legend as the bowmen of Mons, ghostly
  archers who with their phantom shafts overwhelm the conquering enemy; wisps
  of cloud over No Man's Land that are translated by the tired eyes of those
  who peer out into the shape of the Son of Man himself walking sorrowfully
  among the dead. Signs, portents, and miracles, the hosts of premonitions, of
  apparitions of loved ones&mdash;all dwellers in this land of suggestion; all
  born of the tearing loose of the veils of the subconscious. Here, when even a
  thousandth part is gathered, will be work for the psychological analyst for
  twenty years."</p>

  <p>"And the boundaries of this region?" asked McAndrews.</p>

  <p>"Boundaries?" Hawtry plainly was perplexed.</p>

  <p>McAndrews for a moment was silent. Then he drew from his pocket a yellow
  slip of paper, a cablegram.</p>

  <p>"Young Peter Laveller died today," he said, apparently irrelevantly. "Died
  where he had set forth to pass&mdash;in the remnants of the trenches that cut
  through the ancient domain of the Seigneurs of Tocquelain, up near
  Bethune."</p>

  <p>"Died there!" Hawtry's astonishment was profound. "But I read that he had
  been brought home; that, indeed, he was one of your triumphs, McAndrews!"</p>

  <p>"I said he went there to die," repeated the surgeon slowly.</p>

  <p>So that explained the curious reticence of the Lavellers as to what had
  become of their soldier son&mdash;a secrecy which had puzzled the press for
  weeks. For young Peter Laveller was one of the nation's heroes. The only boy
  of old Peter Laveller&mdash;and neither is that the real name of the family,
  for, like the others, I may not reveal it&mdash;he was the heir to the grim
  old coal king's millions, and the secret, best loved pulse of his heart.</p>

  <p>Early in the war he had enlisted with the French. His father's influence
  might have abrogated the law of the French army that every man must start
  from the bottom up&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but young Peter would have none
  of it. Steady of purpose, burning with the white fire of the first Crusaders,
  he took his place in the ranks.</p>

  <p>Clean-cut, blue-eyed, standing six feet in his stocking feet, just twenty-
  five, a bit of a dreamer, perhaps, he was one to strike the imagination of
  the <i>poilus</i>, and they loved him. Twice was he wounded in the perilous
  days, and when America came into the war he was transferred to our
  expeditionary forces. It was at the siege of Mount Kemmel that he received
  the wounds that brought him back to his father and sister. McAndrews had
  accompanied him overseas, I knew, and had patched him together&mdash;or so
  all thought.</p>

  <p>What had happened then&mdash;and why had Laveller gone back to France, to
  die, as McAndrews put it?</p>

  <p>He thrust the cablegram back into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"There is a boundary, John," he said to Hawtry. "Laveller's was a
  borderland case. I'm going to tell it to you." He hesitated. "I ought not to,
  maybe; and yet I have an idea that Peter would like it told; after all, he
  believed himself a discoverer." Again he paused; then definitely made up his
  mind, and turned to me.</p>

  <p>"Merritt, you may make use of this if you think it interesting enough. But
  if you do so decide, then change the names, and be sure to check description
  short of any possibility of ready identification. After all, it is what
  happened that is important&mdash;and those to whom it happened do not
  matter."</p>

  <p>I promised, and I have observed my pledge. I tell the story as he whom I
  call McAndrews reconstructed it for us there in the shadowed room, while we
  sat silent until he had ended.</p>

  <p>Laveller stood behind the parapet of a first-line trench. It was night
  &mdash;an early April night in northern France&mdash;and when that is said,
  all is said to those who have been there.</p>

  <p>Beside him was a trench periscope. His gun lay touching it. The periscope
  is practically useless at night; so through a slit in the sandbags he peered
  out over the three-hundred-foot-wide stretch of No Man's Land.</p>

  <p>Opposite him he knew that other eyes lay close to similar slits in the
  German parapet, watchful as his were for the least movement.</p>

  <p>There were grotesque heaps scattered about No Man's Land, and when the
  star-shells burst and flooded it with their glare these heaps seemed to stir
  to move&mdash;some to raise themselves, some to gesticulate, to protest. And
  this was very horrible, for those who moved under the lights were the
  dead&mdash;French and English, Prussian and Bavarian&mdash;dregs of a score
  of carryings to the red wine-press of war set up in this sector.</p>

  <p>There were two Jocks on the entanglements; kilted Scots, one colandered by
  machine-gun hail just as he was breaking through. The shock of the swift,
  manifold death had hurled his left arm about the neck of the comrade close
  beside him; and this man had been stricken within the same second. There they
  leaned, embracing&mdash;and as the star-shells flared and died, flared and
  died, they seemed to rock, to try to break from the wire, to dash forward, to
  return.</p>

  <p>Laveller was weary, weary beyond all understanding. The sector was a bad
  one and nervous. For almost seventy-two hours he had been without sleep
  &mdash;for the few minutes now and then of dead stupor broken by constant
  alarms was worse than sleep.</p>

  <p>The shelling had been well-nigh continuous, and the food scarce and
  perilous to get; three miles back through the fire they had been forced to go
  for it; no nearer than that could the ration dumps be brought.</p>

  <p>And constantly the parapets had to be rebuilt and the wires repaired
  &mdash;and when this was done the shells destroyed again, and once more the
  dreary routine had to be gone through; for the orders were to hold this
  sector at all costs.</p>

  <p>All that was left of Laveller's consciousness was concentrated in his
  eyes; only his seeing faculty lived. And sight, obeying the rigid, inexorable
  will commanding every reserve of vitality to concentrate on the duty at hand,
  was blind to everything except the strip before it that Laveller must watch
  until relieved. His body was numb; he could not feel the ground with his
  feet, and sometimes he seemed to be floating in air like&mdash;like the two
  Scots upon the wire!</p>

  <p>Why couldn't they be still? What right had men whose blood had drained
  away into a black stain beneath them to dance and pirouette to the rhythm of
  the flares? Damn them&mdash;why couldn't a shell drop down and bury them?</p>

  <p>There was a chateau half a mile up there to the right&mdash;at least it
  had been a chateau. Under it were deep cellars into which one could creep and
  sleep. He knew that, because ages ago, when first he had come into this part
  of the line, he had slept a night there.</p>

  <p>It would be like reentering paradise to crawl again into those cellars,
  out of the pitiless rain; sleep once more with a roof over his head.</p>

  <p>"I will sleep and sleep and sleep&mdash;and sleep and sleep and sleep," he
  told himself; then stiffened as at the slumber-compelling repetition of the
  word darkness began to gather before him.</p>

  <p>The star-shells flared and died, flared and died; the staccato of a
  machine gun reached him. He thought that it was his teeth chattering until
  his groping consciousness made him realize what it. really was&mdash;some
  nervous German riddling the interminable movement of the dead.</p>

  <p>There was a squidging of feet through the chalky mud. No need to look;
  they were friends, or they could not have passed the sentries at the angle of
  the traverse. Nevertheless, involuntarily, his eyes swept toward the sounds,
  took note of three cloaked figures regarding him.</p>

  <p>There were half a dozen of the lights floating overhead now, and by the
  gleams they cast into the trench he recognized the party.</p>

  <p>One of them was that famous surgeon who had come over from the base
  hospital at Bethune to see made the wounds he healed; the others were his
  major and his captain&mdash;all of them bound for those cellars, no doubt.
  Well, some had all the luck! Back went his eyes to the slit.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" It was the voice of the major addressing the visitor.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong&mdash;what's wrong&mdash;what's wrong?" The words repeated
  themselves swiftly, insistently, within his brain, over and over again,
  striving to waken it.</p>

  <p>Well, what was wrong? Nothing was wrong! Wasn't he, Laveller, there and
  watching? The tormented brain writhed angrily. Nothing was wrong&mdash;why
  didn't they go away and let him watch in peace?</p>

  <p>"Nothing." It was the surgeon&mdash;and again the words kept babbling in
  Laveller's ears, small, whispering, rapidly repeating themselves over and
  over; "Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>But what was this the surgeon was saying? Fragmentarily, only half
  understood, the phrases registered:</p>

  <p>"Perfect case of what I've been telling you. This lad here&mdash;utterly
  worn, weary&mdash;all his consciousness centered upon just one thing
  &mdash;watchfulness... consciousness worn to finest point... behind it all
  his subconsciousness crowding to escape... consciousness will respond to only
  one stimulus&mdash;movement from without... but the subconsciousness, so
  close to the surface, held so lightly in leash... what will it do if that
  little thread is loosed... a perfect case."</p>

  <p>What were they talking about? Now they were whispering.</p>

  <p>"Then, if I have your permission&mdash;" It was the surgeon speaking
  again. Permission for what? Why didn't they go away and not bother him?
  Wasn't it hard enough just to watch without having to hear? Some thing passed
  before his eyes. He looked at it blindly, unrecognizing. His sight must be
  clouded.</p>

  <p>He raised a hand and brushed at his lids. Yes, it must have been his eyes
  &mdash;for it had gone.</p>

  <p>A little circle of light glowed against the parapet near his face. It was
  cast by a small flash. What were they looking for? A hand appeared in the
  circle, a hand with long, flexible fingers which held a piece of paper on
  which there was writing. Did they want him to read, too? Not only watch and
  hear&mdash;but read! He gathered himself together to protest.</p>

  <p>Before he could force his stiffened lips to move he felt the upper button
  of his greatcoat undone, a hand slipped through the opening and thrust
  something into his tunic pocket just above the heart.</p>

  <p>Someone whispered "Lucie de Tocquelain." What did it mean? That was not
  the password. There was a great singing in his head&mdash;as though he were
  sinking through water. What was that light that dazzled him even through his
  closed lids? Painfully he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Laveller looked straight into the disk of a golden sun slowly setting over
  a row of noble oaks. Blinded, he dropped his gaze. He was standing ankle-
  deep in soft, green grass, starred with small clumps of blue flowerets. Bees
  buzzed about in their chalices. Little yellow-winged butterflies hovered over
  them. A gentle breeze blew, warm and fragrant.</p>

  <p>Oddly he felt no sense of strangeness&mdash;then&mdash;this was a normal
  home world&mdash;a world as it ought to be. But he remembered that he had
  once been in another world, far, far unlike this; a place of misery and pain,
  of blood-stained mud and filth, of cold and wet; a world of cruelty, whose
  nights were tortured hells of glaring lights and fiery, slaying sounds, and
  tormented men who sought for rest and sleep and found none, and dead who
  danced. Where was it? Had there ever really been such a world? He was not
  sleepy now.</p>

  <p>He raised his hands and looked at them. They were grimed and cut and
  stained. He was wearing a greatcoat, wet, mud-bespattered, filthy. High boots
  were on his legs. Beside one dirt-incrusted foot lay a cluster of the blue
  flowerets, half-crushed. He groaned in pity, and bent, striving to raise the
  broken blossoms.</p>

  <p>"'Too many dead now&mdash;too many dead," he whispered; then paused. He
  had come from that nightmare world! How else in this happy, clean one could
  he be so unclean?</p>

  <p>Of course he had&mdash;but where was it? How had he made his way from it
  here? Ah, there had been a password&mdash;what had it been?</p>

  <p>He had it: "Lucie de Tocquelain!"</p>

  <p>Laveller cried it aloud&mdash;still kneeling.</p>

  <p>A soft little hand touched his cheek. A low, sweet-toned voice caressed
  his ears.</p>

  <p>"I am Lucie de Tocquelain," it said. "And the flowers will grow again
  &mdash;yet it is dear of you to sorrow for them."</p>

  <p>He sprang to his feet. Beside him stood a girl, a slender maid of
  eighteen, whose hair was a dusky cloud upon her proud little head and in
  whose great, brown eyes, resting upon his, tenderness and a half-amused pity
  dwelt.</p>

  <p>Peter stood silent, drinking her in&mdash;the low, broad, white forehead;
  the curved, red lips; the rounded, white shoulders, shining through the
  silken web of her scarf; the whole lithe sweet body of her in the clinging,
  quaintly fashioned gown, with its high, clasping girdle.</p>

  <p>She was fair enough; but to Peter's starved eyes she was more than that
  &mdash;she was a spring gushing from the arid desert, the first cool breeze
  of twilight over a heat-drenched isle, the first glimpse of paradise to a
  soul fresh risen from centuries of hell. And under the burning worship of his
  eyes her own dropped; a faint rose stained the white throat, crept to her
  dark hair.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I am the Demoiselle de Tocquelain, messire," she murmured. "And
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He recovered his courtesy with a shock. "Laveller&mdash;Peter Laveller
  &mdash;is my name, mademoiselle," he stammered. "Pardon my rudeness&mdash;
  but how I came here I know not&mdash;nor from whence, save that it was
  &mdash;it was a place unlike this. And you&mdash;you are so beautiful,
  mademoiselle!"</p>

  <p>The clear eyes raised themselves for a moment, a touch of roguishness in
  their depths, then dropped demurely once more&mdash;but the blush
  deepened.</p>

  <p>He watched her, all his awakening heart in his eyes; then perplexity
  awoke, touched him insistently.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what place this is, mademoiselle," he faltered, "and how
  I came here, if you&mdash;" He stopped. From far, far away, from league upon
  league of space, a vast weariness was sweeping down upon him. He sensed it
  coming&mdash;closer, closer; it touched him; it lapped about him; he was
  sinking under it; being lost&mdash;falling&mdash;falling&mdash;</p>

  <p>Two soft, warm hands gripped his. His tired head dropped upon them.
  Through the little palms that clasped so tightly pulsed rest and strength.
  The weariness gathered itself, began to withdraw slowly, so slowly&mdash; and
  was gone!</p>

  <p>In its wake followed an ineffable, an uncontrollable desire to weep
  &mdash;to weep in relief that the weariness had passed, that the devil world
  whose shadows still lingered in his mind was behind him, and that he was here
  with this maid. And his tears fell, bathing the little hands.</p>

  <p>Did he feel her head bent to his, her lips touch his hair? Peace came to
  him. He rose shamefacedly.</p>

  <p>"I do not know why I wept, mademoiselle&mdash;" he began; and then saw
  that her white fingers were clasped now in his blackened ones. He released
  them in sudden panic.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he stammered. "I ought not touch you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She reached out swiftly, took his hands again in hers, patted them half
  savagely.</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"I do not see them as you do, Messire Pierre," she answered. "And if I
  did, are not their stains to me as the stains from hearts of her brave sons
  on the gonfalons of France? Think no more of your stains save as decorations,
  messire."</p>

  <p>France&mdash;France? Why, that was the name of the world he had left
  behind; the world where men sought vainly for sleep, and the dead danced.</p>

  <p>The dead danced&mdash;what did that mean? He turned wistful eyes to
  her.</p>

  <p>And with a little cry of pity she clung to him for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You are so tired&mdash;and you are so hungry," she mourned. "And think no
  more, nor try to remember, messire, till you have eaten and drunk with us and
  rested for a space."</p>

  <p>They had turned. And now Laveller saw not far away a chateau. It was
  pinnacled and stately, serene in its gray stone and lordly with its spires
  and slender turrets thrust skyward from its crest like plumes flung high from
  some proud prince's helm. Hand in hand like children the Demoiselle de
  Tocquelain and Peter Laveller approached it over the greensward.</p>

  <p>"It is my home, messire," the girl said. "And there among the roses my
  mother awaits us. My father is away, and he will be sorrowful that he met you
  not, but you shall meet him when you return."</p>

  <p>He was to return, then? That meant he was not to stay. But where was he to
  go&mdash;whence was he to return? His mind groped blindly; cleared again. He
  was walking among roses; there were roses everywhere, great, fragrant, opened
  blooms of scarlets and of saffrons, of shell pinks and white; clusters and
  banks of them, climbing up the terraces, masking the base of the chateau with
  perfumed tide.</p>

  <p>And as he and the maid, still hand in hand, passed between them, they came
  to a table dressed with snowy napery and pale porcelains beneath a bower.</p>

  <p>A woman sat there. She was a little past the prime of life, Peter thought.
  Her hair, he saw, was powdered white, her cheeks as pink and white as a
  child's, her eyes the sparkling brown of those of the demoiselle&mdash;and
  gracious&mdash;gracious, Peter thought, as some <i>grande dame</i> of old
  France.</p>

  <p>The demoiselle dropped her a low curtsy.</p>

  <p>"Ma m&egrave;re," she said, "I bring you the Sieur Pierre la
  Valli&egrave;re, a very brave and gallant gentleman who has come to visit us
  for a little while."</p>

  <p>The clear eyes of the older woman scanned him, searched him. Then the
  stately white head bowed, and over the table a delicate hand was stretched
  toward him.</p>

  <p>It was meant for him to kiss, he knew&mdash;but he hesitated awkwardly,
  miserably, looking at his begrimed own.</p>

  <p>"The Sieur Pierre will not see himself as we do," the girl said in half
  merry reproof; then she laughed, a caressing, golden chiming, "Ma
  m&egrave;re, shall he see his hands as we do?"</p>

  <p>The white-haired woman smiled and nodded, her eyes kindly and, Laveller
  noted, with that same pity in them as had been in those of the demoiselle
  when first he had turned and beheld her.</p>

  <p>The girl touched Peter's eyes lightly, held his palms up before him
  &mdash;they were white and fine and clean and in some unfamiliar way
  beautiful!</p>

  <p>Again the indefinable amaze stifled him, but his breeding told. He
  conquered the sense of strangeness, bowed from the hips, took the dainty
  fingers of the stately lady in his, and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>She struck a silver bell. Through the roses came two tall men in livery,
  who took from Laveller his greatcoat. They were followed by four small black
  boys in gay scarlet slashed with gold. They bore silver platters on which
  were meat and fine white bread and cakes, fruit, and wine in tall crystal
  flagons.</p>

  <p>And Laveller remembered how hungry he was. But of that feast he remembered
  little&mdash;up to a certain point. He knows that he sat there filled with a
  happiness and content that surpassed the sum of happiness of all his
  twenty-five years.</p>

  <p>The mother spoke little, but the Demoiselle Lucie and Peter Laveller
  chattered and laughed like children&mdash;when they were not silent and
  drinking each the other in.</p>

  <p>And ever in Laveller's heart an adoration for this maid, met so
  perplexingly, grew&mdash;grew until it seemed that his heart could not hold
  his joy. Ever the maid's eyes as they rested on his were softer, more tender,
  filled with promise; and the proud face beneath the snowy hair became, as it
  watched them, the essence of that infinitely gentle sweetness that is the
  soul of the madonnas.</p>

  <p>At last the Demoiselle de Tocquelain, glancing up and meeting that gaze,
  blushed, cast down her long lashes, and hung her head; then raised her eyes
  bravely.</p>

  <p>"Are you content, my mother?" she asked gravely.</p>

  <p>"My daughter, I am well content," came the smiling answer.</p>

  <p>Swiftly followed the incredible, the terrible&mdash;in that scene of
  beauty and peace it was, said Laveller, like the flashing forth of a
  gorilla's paw upon a virgin's breast, a wail from deepest hell lancing
  through the song of angels.</p>

  <p>At his right, among the roses, a light began to gleam&mdash;a fitful,
  flaring light that glared and died, glared and died. In it were two shapes.
  One had an arm clasped about the neck of the other; they leaned embracing in
  the light, and as it waxed and waned they seemed to pirouette, to try to
  break from it, to dash forward, to return&mdash;to dance!</p>

  <p>The dead who danced!</p>

  <p>A world where men sought rest and sleep, and could find neither, and where
  even the dead could find no rest, but must dance to the rhythm of the
  star-shells!</p>

  <p>He groaned; sprang to his feet; watched, quivering in every nerve. Girl
  and woman followed his rigid gaze; turned to him again with tear-filled,
  pitiful eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing!" said the maid. "It is nothing! See&mdash;there is nothing
  there!"</p>

  <p>Once more she touched his lids; and the light and the swaying forms were
  gone. But now Laveller knew. Back into his consciousness rushed the full tide
  of memory&mdash;memory of the mud and the filth, the stenches, and the fiery,
  slaying sounds, the cruelty, the misery and the hatreds; memory of torn men
  and tormented dead; memory of whence he had come, the trenches.</p>

  <p>The trenches! He had fallen asleep, and all this was but a dream! He was
  sleeping at his post, while his comrades were trusting him to watch over
  them. And those two ghastly shapes among the roses&mdash;they were the two
  Scots on the wires summoning him back to his duty; beckoning, beckoning him
  to return. He must waken! He must waken!</p>

  <p>Desperately he strove to drive himself from his garden of illusion; to
  force himself back to that devil world which during this hour of enchantment
  had been to his mind only as a fog bank on a far horizon. And as he
  struggled, the brown-eyed maid and the snowy-tressed woman watched&mdash;
  with ineffable pity, tears falling.</p>

  <p>"The trenches!" gasped Laveller. "O God, wake me up! I must get back! O
  God, make me wake."</p>

  <p>"Am I only a dream, then, <i>ma mie</i>?"</p>

  <p>It was the Demoiselle Lucie's voice&mdash;a bit piteous, the golden tones
  shaken.</p>

  <p>"I must get back," he groaned&mdash;although at her question his heart
  seemed to die within him. "Let me wake!"</p>

  <p>"Am I a dream?" Now the voice was angry; the demoiselle drew close. "Am I
  not real?"</p>

  <p>A little foot stamped furiously on his, a little hand darted out, pinched
  him viciously close above his elbow. He felt the sting of the pain and rubbed
  it, gazing at her stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Am I a dream, think you?" she murmured, and, raising her palms, set them
  on his temples, bringing down his head until his eyes looked straight into
  hers.</p>

  <p>Laveller gazed&mdash;gazed down, down deep into their depths, lost himself
  in them, felt his heart rise like the spring from what he saw there. Her
  warm, sweet breath fanned his cheek; whatever this was, wherever he was
  &mdash;she was no dream!</p>

  <p>"But I must return&mdash;get back to my trench!" The soldier in him clung
  to the necessity.</p>

  <p>"My son"&mdash;it was the mother speaking now&mdash;"my son, you are in
  your trench."</p>

  <p>Laveller gazed at her, bewildered. His eyes swept the lovely scene about
  him. When he turned to her again it was with the look of a sorely perplexed
  child. She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear," she said. "Everything is well. You are in your trench
  &mdash;but your trench centuries ago; yes, twice a hundred years ago,
  counting time as you do&mdash;and as once we did."</p>

  <p>A chill ran through him. Were they mad? Was he mad? His arm slipped down
  over a soft shoulder; the touch steadied him.</p>

  <p>"And you?" he forced himself to ask. He caught a swift glance between the
  two, and in answer to some unspoken question the mother nodded. The
  Demoiselle Lucie pressed soft hands against Peter's face, looked again into
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ma mie</i>," she said gently, "we have been"&mdash;she hesitated
  &mdash;"what you call&mdash;dead&mdash;to your world these two hundred
  years!"</p>

  <p>But before she had spoken the words Laveller, I think, had sensed what was
  coming. And if for a fleeting instant he had felt a touch of ice in every
  vein, it vanished beneath the exaltation that raced through him, vanished as
  frost beneath a mist-scattering sun. For if this were true&mdash;why, then
  there was no such thing as death! And it was true!</p>

  <p>It was true! He knew it with a shining certainty that had upon it not the
  shadow of a shadow&mdash;but how much his desire to believe entered into this
  certainty who can tell?</p>

  <p>He looked at the chateau. Of course! It was that whose ruins loomed out of
  the darkness when the flares split the night&mdash;in whose cellars he had
  longed to sleep. Death&mdash;oh, the foolish, fearful hearts of men!
  &mdash;this death? This glorious place of peace and beauty? And this wondrous
  girl whose brown eyes were the keys of heart's desire! Death&mdash; he
  laughed and laughed again.</p>

  <p>Another thought struck him, swept through him like a torrent. He must get
  back, must get back to the trenches and tell them this great truth he had
  found. Why, he was like a traveler from a dying world who unwittingly
  stumbles upon a secret to turn that world dead to hope into a living
  heaven!</p>

  <p>There was no longer need for men to fear the splintering shell, the fire
  that seared them, the bullets, or the shining steel. What did they matter
  when this&mdash;this&mdash;was the truth? He must get back and tell them.
  Even those two Scots would lie still on the wires when he whispered this to
  them.</p>

  <p>But he forgot&mdash;they knew now. But they could not return to tell
  &mdash;as he could. He was wild with joy, exultant, lifted up to the skies, a
  demigod&mdash;the bearer of a truth that would free the devil-ridden world
  from its demons; a new Prometheus who bore back to mankind a more precious
  flame than had the old.</p>

  <p>"I must go!" he cried. "I must tell them! Show me how to return&mdash;
  swiftly!"</p>

  <p>A doubt assailed him; he pondered it.</p>

  <p>"But they may not believe me," he whispered. "No. I must show them proof.
  I must carry something back to prove this to them."</p>

  <p>The Lady of Tocquelain smiled. She lifted a little knife from the table
  and, reaching over to a rose-tree, cut from it a cluster of buds; thrust it
  toward his eager hand.</p>

  <p>Before he could grasp it the maid had taken it.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she murmured. "I will give you another message."</p>

  <p>There was a quill and ink upon the table, and Peter wondered how they had
  come; he had not seen them before&mdash;but with so many wonders, what was
  this small one? There was a slip of paper in the Demoiselle Lucie's hand,
  too. She bent her little, dusky head and wrote; blew upon the paper, waved it
  in the air to dry; sighed, smiled at Peter, and wrapped it about the stem of
  the rosebud cluster; placed it on the table, and waved back Peter's questing
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Your coat," she said. "You'll need it&mdash;for now you must go
  back."</p>

  <p>She thrust his arms into the garment. She was laughing&mdash;but there
  were tears in the great, brown eyes; the red mouth was very wistful.</p>

  <p>Now the older woman arose, stretched out her hand again; Laveller bent
  over it, kissed it.</p>

  <p>"We shall be here waiting for you, my son," she said softly. "When it is
  time for you to&mdash;come back."</p>

  <p>He reached for the roses with the paper wrapped about their stem. The maid
  darted a hand over his, lifted them before he could touch them.</p>

  <p>"You must not read it until you have gone," she said&mdash;and again the
  rose flame burned throat and cheeks.</p>

  <p>Hand in hand, like children, they sped over the greensward to where Peter
  had first met her. There they stopped, regarding each other gravely&mdash;
  and then that other miracle which had happened to Laveller and that he had
  forgotten in the shock of his wider realization called for utterance.</p>

  <p>"I love you!" whispered Peter Laveller to this living, long-dead
  Demoiselle de Tocquelain.</p>

  <p>She sighed, and was in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know you do!" she cried. "I know you do, dear one&mdash;but I was
  so afraid you would go without telling me so."</p>

  <p>She raised her sweet lips, pressed them long to his, drew back.</p>

  <p>"I loved you from the moment I saw you standing here," she told him, "and
  I will be here waiting for you when you return. And now you must go, dear
  love of mine; but wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He felt a hand steal into the pocket of his tunic, press something over
  his heart.</p>

  <p>"The messages," she said. "Take them. And remember&mdash;I will wait. I
  promise. I, Lucie de Tocquelain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a singing in his head. He opened his eyes. He was back in his
  trench, and in his ears still rang the name of the demoiselle, and over his
  heart he felt still the pressure of her hand. His head was half turned toward
  three men who were regarding him.</p>

  <p>One of them had a watch in his hand; it was the surgeon. Why was he
  looking at his watch? Had he been gone long? he wondered.</p>

  <p>Well, what did it matter, when he was the bearer of such a message? His
  weariness had gone; he was transformed, jubilant; his soul was shouting
  paeans. Forgetting discipline, he sprang toward the three.</p>

  <p>"There is no such thing as death!" he cried. "We must send this message
  along the lines&mdash;at once! At once, do you understand! Tell it to the
  world&mdash;I have proof&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stammered and choked in his eagerness. The three glanced at each other.
  His major lifted his electric flash, clicked it in Peter's face, started
  oddly&mdash;then quietly walked over and stood between the lad and his
  rifle.</p>

  <p>"Just get your breath a moment, my boy, and then tell us all about it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>They were devilishly unconcerned, were they not? Well, wait till they had
  heard what he had to tell them!</p>

  <p>And tell them Peter did, leaving out only what had passed between him and
  the demoiselle&mdash;for, after all, wasn't that their own personal affair?
  And gravely and silently they listened to him. But always the trouble
  deepened in his major's eyes as Laveller poured forth the story.</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;I came back, came back as quickly as I could, to help us
  all; to lift us out of all this"&mdash;his hands swept out in a wide gesture
  of disgust&mdash;"for none of it matters! When we die&mdash;we live!" he
  ended.</p>

  <p>Upon the face of the man of science rested profound satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"A perfect demonstration; better than I could ever have hoped!" he spoke
  over Laveller's head to the major. "Great, how great is the imagination of
  man!"</p>

  <p>There was a tinge of awe in his voice.</p>

  <p>Imagination? Peter was cut to the sensitive, vibrant soul of him.</p>

  <p>They didn't believe him! He would show them!</p>

  <p>"But I have the proof!" he cried.</p>

  <p>He threw open his greatcoat, ran his hand into his tunic-pocket; his
  fingers closed over a bit of paper wrapped around a stem. Ah&mdash;now he
  would show them!</p>

  <p>He drew it out, thrust it toward them.</p>

  <p>"Look!" His voice was like a triumphal trumpet-call.</p>

  <p>What was the matter with them? Could they not see? Why did their eyes
  search his face instead of realizing what he was offering them? He looked at
  what he held&mdash;then, incredulous, brought it close to his own eyes, gazed
  and gazed, with a sound in his ears as though the universe were slipping away
  around him, with a heart that seemed to have forgotten to beat. For in his
  hand, stem wrapped in paper, was no fresh and fragrant rosebud cluster his
  brown-eyed demoiselle's mother had clipped for him in the garden.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;there was but a sprig of artificial buds, worn and torn and
  stained, faded and old!</p>

  <p>A great numbness crept over Peter.</p>

  <p>Dumbly he looked at the surgeon, at his captain, at the major whose face
  was now troubled indeed and somewhat stern.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Had it all been a dream? Was there no radiant Lucie&mdash;save in his own
  mind&mdash;no brown-eyed maid who loved him and whom he loved?</p>

  <p>The scientist stepped forward, took the worn little sprig from the relaxed
  grip. The bit of paper slipped off, remained in Peter's fingers.</p>

  <p>"You certainly deserve to know just what you've been through, my boy," the
  urbane, capable voice beat upon his dulled hearing, "after such a reaction as
  you have provided to our little experiment." He laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Experiment? Experiment? A dull rage began to grow in Peter&mdash; vicious,
  slowly rising.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur!" called the major appealingly, somewhat warningly, it seemed,
  to his distinguished visitor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by your leave, major," went on the great man, "here is a lad of high
  intelligence&mdash;of education, you could know that by the way he expressed
  himself&mdash;he will understand."</p>

  <p>The major was not a scientist&mdash;he was a Frenchman, human, and with an
  imagination of his own. He shrugged; but he moved a little closer to the
  resting rifle.</p>

  <p>"We had been discussing, your officers and I," the capable voice went on,
  "dreams that are the half-awakened mind's effort to explain some touch, some
  unfamiliar sound, or what not that has aroused it from its sleep. One is
  slumbering, say, and a window nearby is broken. The sleeper hears, the
  consciousness endeavors to learn&mdash;but it has given over its control to
  the subconscious. And this rises accommodatingly to its mate's assistance.
  But it is irresponsible, and it can express itself only in pictures.</p>

  <p>"It takes the sound and&mdash;well, weaves a little romance around it. It
  does its best to explain&mdash;alas! Its best is only a more or less
  fantastic lie&mdash;recognized as such by the consciousness the moment it
  becomes awake.</p>

  <p>"And the movement of the subconsciousness in this picture production is
  inconceivably rapid. It can depict in the fraction of a second a series of
  incidents that if actually lived would take hours&mdash;yes, days&mdash; of
  time. You follow me, do you not? Perhaps you recognize the experience I
  outline?"</p>

  <p>Laveller nodded. The bitter, consuming rage was mounting within him
  steadily. But he was outwardly calm, all alert. He would hear what this self-
  satisfied devil had done to him, and then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Your officers disagreed with some of my conclusions. I saw you here,
  weary, concentrated upon the duty at hand, half in hypnosis from the strain
  and the steady flaring and dying of the lights. You offered a perfect
  clinical subject, a laboratory test unexcelled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Could he keep his hands from his throat until he had finished? Laveller
  wondered. Lucie, his Lucie, a fantastic lie&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Steady, <i>mon vieux</i>"&mdash;it was his major whispering. Ah, when he
  struck, he must do it quickly&mdash;his officer was too close, too close.
  Still&mdash;he must keep his watch for him through the slit. He would be
  peering there, perhaps, when he, Peter, leaped.</p>

  <p>"And so"&mdash;the surgeon's tones were in his best student-clinic
  manner&mdash;"and so I took a little sprig of artificial flowers that I had
  found pressed between the leaves of an old missal I had picked up in the
  ruins of the chateau yonder. On a slip of paper I wrote a line of French
  &mdash;for then I thought you a French soldier. It was a simple line from the
  ballad of Aucassin and Nicolette&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="poem">And there she waits to greet him<br>
  When all his days are run.</p>

  <p>"Also, there was a name written on the title-page of the missal, the name,
  no doubt, of its long-dead owner&mdash;'Lucie de Tocquelain'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lucie! Peter's rage and hatred were beaten back by a great surge of
  longing&mdash;rushed back stronger than ever.</p>

  <p>"So I passed the sprig of flowers before your unseeing eyes; consciously
  unseeing, I mean, for it was certain your subconsciousness would take note of
  them. I showed you the line of writing&mdash;your subconsciousness absorbed
  this, too, with its suggestion of a love troth, a separation, an awaiting. I
  wrapped it about the stem of the sprig, I thrust them both into your pocket,
  and called the name of Lucie de Tocquelain into your ear.</p>

  <p>"The problem was what your other self would make of those four things
  &mdash;the ancient cluster, the suggestion in the line of writing, the touch,
  and the name&mdash;a fascinating problem, indeed!</p>

  <p>"And hardly had I withdrawn my hand, almost before my lips closed on the
  word I had whispered&mdash;you had turned to us shouting that there was no
  such thing as death, and pouring out, like one inspired, that remarkable
  story of yours&mdash;all, all built by your imagination from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But he got no further. The searing rage in Laveller had burst all bounds,
  had flared forth murderously and hurled him silently at the surgeon's throat.
  There were flashes of flame before his eyes&mdash;red, sparkling sheets of
  flame. He would die for it, but he would kill this cold-blooded fiend who
  could take a man out of hell, open up to him heaven, and then thrust him back
  into hell grown now a hundred times more cruel, with all hope dead in him for
  eternity.</p>

  <p>Before he could strike strong hands gripped him, held him fast. The
  scarlet, curtained flares before his eyes faded away. He thought he heard a
  tender, golden voice whispering to him:</p>

  <p>"It is nothing! It is nothing! See as I do!"</p>

  <p>He was standing between his officers, who held him fast on each side. They
  were silent, looking at the now white-faced surgeon with more than somewhat
  of cold, unfriendly sternness in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"My boy, my boy"&mdash;that scientist's poise was gone; his voice
  trembling, agitated. "I did not understand&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;I never
  thought you would take it so seriously."</p>

  <p>Laveller spoke to his officers&mdash;quietly. "It is over, sirs. You need
  not hold me."</p>

  <p>They looked at him, released him, patted him on the shoulder, fixed again
  their visitor with that same utter contempt.</p>

  <p>Laveller turned stumblingly to the parapet. His eyes were full of tears.
  Brain and heart and soul were nothing but a blind desolation, a waste utterly
  barren of hope or of even the ghost of the wish to hope. That message of his,
  the sacred truth that was to set the feet of a tormented world on the path to
  paradise&mdash;a dream.</p>

  <p>His Lucie, his brown-eyed demoiselle who had murmured her love for him
  &mdash;a thing compounded of a word, a touch, a writing, and an artificial
  flower!</p>

  <p>He could not, would not believe it. Why, he could feel still the touch of
  her soft lips on his, her warm body quivering in his arms. And she had said
  he would come back&mdash;and promised to wait for him.</p>

  <p>What was that in his hand? It was the paper that had wrapped the rosebuds
  &mdash;the cursed paper with which that cold devil had experimented with
  him.</p>

  <p>Laveller crumpled it savagely&mdash;raised it to hurl it at his feet.</p>

  <p>Someone seemed to stay his hand.</p>

  <p>Slowly he opened it.</p>

  <p>The three men watching him saw a glory steal over his face, a radiance
  like that of a soul redeemed from endless torture. All its sorrow, its agony,
  was wiped out, leaving it a boy's once more.</p>

  <p>He stood wide-eyed, dreaming.</p>

  <p>The major stepped forward, gently drew the paper from Laveller.</p>

  <p>There were many star-shells floating on high now, the trench was filled
  with their glare, and in their light he scanned the fragment.</p>

  <p>On his face when he raised it there was a great awe&mdash;and as they took
  it from him and read this same awe dropped down upon the others like a
  veil.</p>

  <p>For over the line the surgeon had written were now three other lines
  &mdash;in old French:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Nor grieve, dear heart, nor fear the seeming&mdash;<br>
  Here is waking after dreaming.<br>
  &mdash;She who loves you, Lucie."</p>

  <p>That was McAndrews's story, and it was Hawtry who finally broke the
  silence that followed his telling of it.</p>

  <p>"The lines had been on the paper, of course," he said; "they were probably
  faint, and your surgeon had not noticed them. It was drizzling, and the
  dampness brought them out."</p>

  <p>"No," answered McAndrews; "they had not been there."</p>

  <p>"But how can you be so sure?" remonstrated the Psychologist.</p>

  <p>"Because I was the surgeon," said McAndrews Quietly. "The paper was a page
  torn from my note book. When I wrapped it about the sprig it was blank
  &mdash;except for the line I myself had written there.</p>

  <p>"But there was one more bit of&mdash;well, shall we call it evidence,
  John?&mdash;the hand in which Laveller's message was penned was the hand in
  the missal in which I had found the flowers&mdash;and the signature 'Lucie'
  was that same signature, curve for curve and quaint, old-fashioned angle for
  angle."</p>

  <p>A longer silence fell, broken once more by Hawtry, abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What became of the paper?" he asked. "Was the ink analyzed?
  Was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As we stood there wondering," interrupted McAndrews, "a squall swept down
  upon the trench. It tore the paper from my hand; carried it away. Laveller
  watched it go; made no effort to get it."</p>

  <p>"'It does not matter. I know now,' he said&mdash;and smiled at me, the
  forgiving, happy smile of a joyous boy. 'I apologize to you, doctor. You're
  the best friend I ever had. I thought at first you had done to me what no
  other man would do to another&mdash;I see now that you have done for me what
  no other man could.'</p>

  <p>"And that is all. He went through the war neither seeking death nor
  avoiding it. I loved him like a son. He would have died after that Mount
  Kemmel affair had it not been for me. He wanted to live long enough to bid
  his father and sister goodbye, and I&mdash;patched him up. He did it, and
  then set forth for the trench beneath the shadow of the ruined old chateau
  where his brown-eyed demoiselle had found him."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Hawtry.</p>

  <p>"Because he thought that from there he could&mdash;go back&mdash;to her
  more quickly."</p>

  <p>"To me an absolutely unwarranted conclusion," said the psychologist,
  wholly irritated, half angry. "There is some simple, natural explanation of
  it all."</p>

  <p>"Of course, John," answered McAndrews soothingly&mdash;"of course there
  is. Tell us it, can't you?"</p>

  <p>But Hawtry, it seemed, could not offer any particulars.</p><hr>

  <h3>First published in <i>Weird Tales</i>, August 1926</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MCKAY sat on the balcony of the little inn that squatted
  like a brown gnome among the pines on the eastern shore of the lake.</p>

  <p>It was a small and lonely lake high up in the Vosges; and yet, lonely is
  not just the word with which to tag its spirit; rather was it aloof,
  withdrawn. The mountains came down on every side, making a great tree-lined
  bowl that seemed, when McKay first saw it, to be filled with the still wine
  of peace.</p>

  <p>McKay had worn the wings in the world war with honor, flying first with
  the French and later with his own country's forces. And as a bird loves the
  trees, so did McKay love them. To him they were not merely trunks and roots,
  branches and leaves; to him they were personalities. He was acutely aware of
  differences in character even among the same species&mdash;that pine was
  benevolent and jolly; that one austere and monkish; there stood a swaggering
  bravo, and there dwelt a sage wrapped in green meditation; that birch was a
  wanton&mdash;the birch near her was virginal, still a dream.</p>

  <p>The war had sapped him, nerve and brain and soul. Through all the years
  that had passed since then the wound had kept open. But now, as he slid his
  car down the vast green bowl, he felt its spirit reach out to him; reach out
  to him and caress and quiet him, promising him healing. He seemed to drift
  like a falling leaf through the clustered woods; to be cradled by gentle
  hands of the trees.</p>

  <p>He had stopped at the little gnome of an inn, and there he had lingered,
  day after day, week after week.</p>

  <p>The trees had nursed him; soft whisperings of leaves, slow chant of the
  needled pines, had first deadened, then driven from him the re-echoing clamor
  of the war and its sorrow. The open wound of his spirit had closed under
  their green healing; had closed and become scar; and even the scar had been
  covered and buried, as the scars on Earth's breast are covered and buried
  beneath the falling leaves of Autumn. The trees had laid green healing hands
  on his eyes, banishing the pictures of war. He had sucked strength from the
  green breasts of the hills.</p>

  <p>Yet as strength flowed back to him and mind and spirit healed, McKay had
  grown steadily aware that the place was troubled; that its tranquillity was
  not perfect; that there was ferment of fear within it.</p>

  <p>It was as though the trees had waited until he himself had become whole
  before they made their own unrest known to him. Now they were trying to tell
  him something; there was a shrillness as of apprehension, of anger, in the
  whispering of the leaves, the needled chanting of the pines.</p>

  <p>And it was this that had kept McKay at the inn&mdash;a definite
  consciousness of appeal, consciousness of something wrong&mdash;something
  wrong that he was being asked to right. He strained his ears to catch words
  in the rustling branches, words that trembled on the brink of his human
  understanding.</p>

  <p>Never did they cross that brink.</p>

  <p>Gradually he had orientated himself, had focused himself, so he believed,
  to the point of the valley's unease.</p>

  <p>On all the shores of the lake there were but two dwellings. One was the
  inn, and around the inn the trees clustered protectively, confiding;
  friendly. It was as though they had not only accepted it, but had made it
  part of themselves.</p>

  <p>Not so was it of the other habitation. Once it had been the hunting lodge
  of long dead lords; now it was half ruined, forlorn. It stood across the lake
  almost exactly opposite the inn and back upon the slope a half mile from the
  shore. Once there had been fat fields around it and a fair orchard.</p>

  <p>The forest had marched down upon them. Here and there in the fields,
  scattered pines and poplars stood like soldiers guarding some outpost;
  scouting parties of saplings lurked among the gaunt and broken fruit trees.
  But the forest had not had its way unchecked; ragged stumps showed where
  those who dwelt in the old lodge had cut down the invaders, blackened patches
  of the woodland showed where they had fired the woods.</p>

  <p>Here was the conflict he had sensed. Here the green folk of the forest
  were both menaced and menacing; at war. The lodge was a fortress beleaguered
  by the woods, a fortress whose garrison sallied forth with axe and torch to
  take their toll of the besiegers.</p>

  <p>Yet McKay sensed the inexorable pressing-in of the forest; he saw it as a
  green army ever filling the gaps in its enclosing ranks, shooting its seeds
  into the cleared places, sending its roots out to sap them; and armed always
  with a crushing patience, a patience drawn from the stone breasts of the
  eternal hills.</p>

  <p>He had the impression of constant regard of watchfulness, as though night
  and day the forest kept its myriads of eyes upon the lodge; inexorably, not
  to be swerved from its purpose. He had spoken of this impression to the inn
  keeper and his wife, and they had looked at him oddly.</p>

  <p>"Old Polleau does not love the trees, no," the old man had said. "No, nor
  do his two sons. They do not love the trees&mdash;and very certainly the
  trees do not love them."</p>

  <p>Between the lodge and the shore, marching down to the verge of the lake
  was a singularly beautiful little coppice of silver birches and firs. The
  coppice stretched for perhaps a quarter of a mile, was not more than a
  hundred feet or two in depth, and it was not alone the beauty of its trees
  but their curious grouping that aroused McKay's interest so vividly. At each
  end of the coppice were a dozen or more of the glistening needled firs, not
  clustered but spread out as though in open marching order; at widely spaced
  intervals along its other two sides paced single firs. The birches, slender
  and delicate, grew within the guard of these sturdier trees, yet not so
  thickly as to crowd each other.</p>

  <p>To McKay the silver birches were for all the world like some gay caravan
  of lovely demoiselles under the protection of debonair knights. With that odd
  other sense of his he saw the birches as delectable damsels, merry and
  laughing&mdash;the pines as lovers, troubadours in their green needled mail.
  And when the winds blew and the crests of the trees bent under them, it was
  as though dainty demoiselles picked up fluttering, leafy skirts, bent leafy
  hoods and danced while the knights of the firs drew closer round them, locked
  arms with theirs and danced with them to the roaring horns of the winds. At
  such times he almost heard sweet laughter from the birches, shoutings from
  the firs.</p>

  <p>Of all the trees in that place McKay loved best this little wood; had
  rowed across and rested in its shade, had dreamed there and, dreaming, had
  heard again elfin echoes of the sweet laughter; eyes closed, had heard
  mysterious whisperings and the sound of dancing feet light as falling leaves;
  had taken dream draught of that gaiety which was the soul of the little
  wood.</p>

  <p>And two days ago he had seen Polleau and his two sons. McKay had been
  dreaming in the coppice all that afternoon. As dusk began to fall he had
  reluctantly arisen and begun the row back to the inn. When he had been a few
  hundred feet from shore three men had come out from the trees and had stood
  watching him&mdash;three grim, powerful men taller than the average French
  peasant.</p>

  <p>He had called a friendly greeting to them, but they had not answered it;
  stood there, scowling. Then as he bent again to his oars, one of the sons had
  raised a hatchet and had driven it savagely into the trunk of a slim birch
  beside him. He thought he heard a thin wailing cry from the stricken tree, a
  sigh from all the little wood.</p>

  <p>McKay had felt as though the keen edge had bitten into his own flesh.</p>

  <p>"Stop that!" he had cried, "Stop it, damn you!"</p>

  <p>For answer the son had struck again&mdash;and never had McKay seen hate
  etched so deep as on his face as he struck. Cursing, a killing rage in heart,
  had swung the boat around, raced back to shore. He had heard the hatchet
  strike again and again and, close now to shore, had heard a crackling and
  over it once more the thin, high wailing. He had turned to look.</p>

  <p>The birch was tottering, was falling. But as it had fallen he had seen a
  curious thing. Close beside it grew one of the firs, and, as the smaller tree
  crashed over, it dropped upon the fir like a fainting maid in the arms of a
  lover. And as it lay and trembled there, one of the great branches of the fir
  slipped from under it, whipped out and smote the hatchet wielder a crushing
  blow upon the head, sending him to earth.</p>

  <p>It had been, of course, only the chance blow of a bough, bent by pressure
  of the fallen tree and then released as that tree slipped down. But there had
  been such suggestion of conscious action in the branch's recoil, so much of
  bitter anger in it, so much, in truth, had it been like the vengeful blow of
  a man that McKay had felt an eerie prickling of his scalp, his heart had
  missed its beat.</p>

  <p>For a moment Polleau and the standing son had stared at the sturdy fir
  with the silvery birch lying on its green breast and folded in, shielded by,
  its needled boughs as though&mdash;again the swift impression came to McKay
  &mdash;as though it were a wounded maid stretched on breast, in arms, of
  knightly lover. For a long moment father and son had stared.</p>

  <p>Then, still wordless but with that same bitter hatred on both their faces,
  they had stopped and picked up the other and with his arms around the neck of
  each had borne him limply away.</p>

  <p>McKay, sitting on the balcony of the inn that morning, went over and over
  that scene; realized more and more clearly the human aspect of fallen birch
  and clasping fir, and the conscious deliberateness of the fir's blow. And
  during the two days that had elapsed since then, he had felt the unease of
  the trees increase, their whispering appeal became more urgent.</p>

  <p>What were they trying to tell him? What did they want him to do?</p>

  <p>Troubled, he stared across the lake, trying to pierce the mists that hung
  over it and hid the opposite shore. And suddenly it seemed that he heard the
  coppice calling him, felt it pull the point of his attention toward it
  irresistibly, as the lodestone swings and holds the compass needle.</p>

  <p>The coppice called him, bade him come to it.</p>

  <p>Instantly McKay obeyed the command; he arose and walked down to the boat
  landing; he stepped into his skiff and began to row across the lake. As his
  oars touched the water his trouble fell from him. In its place flowed peace
  and a curious exaltation.</p>

  <p>The mist was thick upon the lake. There was no breath of wind, yet the
  mist billowed and drifted, shook and curtained under the touch of unfelt airy
  hands.</p>

  <p>They were alive&mdash;the mists; they formed themselves into fantastic
  palaces past whose opalescent facades he flew; they built themselves into
  hills and valleys and circled plains whose floors were rippling silk. Tiny
  rainbows gleamed out among them, and upon the water prismatic patches shone
  and spread like spilled wine of opals. He had the illusion of vast distances
  &mdash;the hills of mist were real mountains, the valleys between them were
  not illusory. He was a colossus cleaving through some elfin world. A trout
  broke, and it was like leviathan leaping from the fathomless deep. Around the
  arc of its body rainbows interlaced and then dissolved into rain of softly
  gleaming gems&mdash;diamonds in dance with sapphires, flame hearted rubies
  and pearls with shimmering souls of rose. The fish vanished, diving cleanly
  without sound; the jeweled bows vanished with it; a tiny irised whirlpool
  swirled for an instant where trout and flashing arcs had been.</p>

  <p>Nowhere was there sound. He let his oars drop and leaned forward,
  drifting. In the silence, before him and around him, he felt opening the
  gateways of an unknown world.</p>

  <p>And suddenly he heard the sound of voices, many voices; faint at first and
  murmurous; louder they became, swiftly; women's voices sweet and lilting and
  mingled with them the deeper tones of men. Voices that lifted and fell in a
  wild, gay chanting through whose joyousness ran undertones both of sorrow and
  of rage&mdash;as though faery weavers threaded through silk spun of sunbeams
  sombre strands dipped in the black of graves and crimson strands stained in
  the red of wrathful sunsets.</p>

  <p>He drifted on, scarce daring to breathe lest even that faint sound break
  the elfin song. Closer it rang and clearer; and now he became aware that the
  speed of his boat was increasing, that it was no longer drifting; that it was
  as though the little waves on each side were pushing him ahead with soft and
  noiseless palms. His boat grounded and as it rustled along over the smooth
  pebbles of the beach the song ceased.</p>

  <p>McKay half arose and peered before him. The mists were thicker here but he
  could see the outlines of the coppice. It was like looking at it through many
  curtains of fine gauze; its trees seemed shifting, ethereal, unreal. And
  moving among the trees were figures that threaded the boles and flitted in
  rhythmic measures like the shadows of leafy boughs swaying to some cadenced
  wind.</p>

  <p>He stepped ashore and made his way slowly toward them. The mists dropped
  behind him, shutting off all sight of shore.</p>

  <p>The rhythmic flittings ceased; there was now no movement as there was no
  sound among the trees&mdash;yet he felt the little woods abrim with watching
  life. McKay tried to speak; there was a spell of silence on his mouth.</p>

  <p>"You called me. I have come to listen to you&mdash;to help you if I
  can."</p>

  <p>The words formed within his mind, but utter them he could not. Over and
  over he tried, desperately; the words seemed to die before his lips could
  give them life.</p>

  <p>A pillar of mist whirled forward and halted, eddying half an arm length
  away. And suddenly out of it peered a woman's face, eyes level with his own.
  A woman's face&mdash;yes; but McKay, staring into those strange eyes probing
  his, knew that face though it seemed it was that of no woman of human breed.
  They were without pupils, the irises deer-like and of the soft green of deep
  forest dells; within them sparkled tiny star points of light like motes in a
  moon beam. The eyes were wide and set far apart beneath a broad, low brow
  over which was piled braid upon braid of hair of palest gold, braids that
  seemed spun of shining ashes of gold. Her nose was small and straight, her
  mouth scarlet and exquisite. The face was oval, tapering to a delicately
  pointed chin.</p>

  <p>Beautiful was that face, but its beauty was an alien one; elfin. For long
  moments the strange eyes thrust their gaze deep into his. Then out of the
  mist two slender white arms stole, the hands long, fingers tapering. The
  tapering fingers touched his ears.</p>

  <p>"He shall hear," whispered the red lips.</p>

  <p>Immediately from all about him a cry arose; in it was the whispering and
  rustling of the leaves beneath the breath of the winds, the shrilling of the
  harp strings of the boughs, the laughter of hidden brooks, the shoutings of
  waters flinging themselves down to deep and rocky pools&mdash;the voices of
  the woods made articulate.</p>

  <p>"He shall hear!" they cried.</p>

  <p>The long white fingers rested on his lips, and their touch was cool as
  bark of birch on cheek after some long upward climb through forest; cool and
  subtly sweet.</p>

  <p>"He shall speak," whispered the scarlet lips.</p>

  <p>"He shall speak!" answered the wood voices again, as though in litany.</p>

  <p>"He shall see," whispered the woman and the cool fingers touched his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"He shall see!" echoed the wood voices.</p>

  <p>The mists that had hidden the coppice from McKay wavered, thinned and were
  gone. In their place was a limpid, translucent, palely green ether, faintly
  luminous&mdash;as though he stood within some clear wan emerald. His feet
  pressed a golden moss spangled with tiny starry bluets. Fully revealed before
  him was the woman of the strange eyes and the face of elfin beauty. He dwelt
  for a moment upon the slender shoulders, the firm small tip-tilted breasts,
  the willow litheness of her body. From neck to knees a smock covered her,
  sheer and silken and delicate as though spun of cobwebs; through it her body
  gleamed as though fire of the young Spring moon ran in her veins.</p>

  <p>Beyond her, upon the golden moss were other women like her, many of them;
  they stared at him with the same wide set green eyes in which danced the
  clouds of sparkling moonbeam motes; like her they were crowned with
  glistening, pallidly golden hair; like hers too were their oval faces with
  the pointed chins and perilous elfin beauty. Only where she stared at him
  gravely, measuring him, weighing him&mdash;there were those of these her
  sisters whose eyes were mocking; and those whose eyes called to him with a
  weirdly tingling allure, their mouths athirst; those whose eyes looked upon
  him with curiosity alone and those whose great eyes pleaded with him, prayed
  to him.</p>

  <p>Within that pellucid, greenly luminous air McKay was abruptly aware that
  the trees of the coppice still had a place. Only now they were spectral
  indeed; they were like white shadows cast athwart a glaucous screen; trunk
  and bough, twig and leaf they arose around him and they were as though etched
  in air by phantom craftsmen&mdash;thin, unsubstantial; they were ghost trees
  rooted in another space.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was aware that there were men among the women; men whose eyes
  were set wide apart as were theirs, as strange and pupilless as were theirs
  but with irises of brown and blue; men with pointed chins and oval faces,
  broad shouldered and clad in kirtles of darkest green; swarthy-skinned men
  muscular and strong, with that same lithe grace of the women&mdash;and like
  them of a beauty alien and elfin.</p>

  <p>McKay heard a little wailing cry. He turned. Close beside him lay a girl
  clasped in the arms of one of the swarthy, green clad men. She lay upon his
  breast. His eyes were filled with a black flame of wrath, and hers were
  misted, anguished. For an instant McKay had a glimpse of the birch old
  Polleau's son had sent crashing down into the boughs of the fir. He saw birch
  and fir as immaterial outlines around the man and girl. For an instant girl
  and man and birch and fir seemed one and the same. The scarlet lipped woman
  touched his shoulder, and the confusion cleared.</p>

  <p>"She withers," sighed the woman, and in her voice McKay heard a faint
  rustling as of mournful leaves. "Now is it not pitiful that she withers
  &mdash;our sister who was so young, so slender and so lovely?"</p>

  <p>McKay looked again at the girl. The white skin seemed shrunken; the moon
  radiance that gleamed through the bodies of the others in hers was dim and
  pallid; her slim arms hung listlessly; her body drooped. The mouth too was
  wan and parched, the long and misted green eyes dull. The palely golden hair
  lusterless, and dry. He looked on slow death&mdash;a withering death.</p>

  <p>"May the arm that struck her down wither!" the green clad man who held her
  shouted, and in his voice McKay heard a savage strumming as of winter winds
  through bleak boughs: "May his heart wither and the sun blast him! May the
  rain and the waters deny him and the winds scourge him!"</p>

  <p>"I thirst," whispered the girl.</p>

  <p>There was a stirring among the watching women. One came forward holding a
  chalice that was like thin leaves turned to green crystal. She paused beside
  the trunk of one of the spectral trees, reached up and drew down to her a
  branch. A slim girl with half-frightened, half-resentful eyes glided to her
  side and threw her arms around the ghostly bole. The woman with the chalice
  bent the branch and cut it deep with what seemed an arrow-shaped flake of
  jade. From the wound a faintly opalescent liquid slowly filled the cup. When
  it was filled the woman beside McKay stepped forward and pressed her own long
  hands around the bleeding branch. She stepped away and McKay saw that the
  stream had ceased to flow. She touched the trembling girl and unclasped her
  arms.</p>

  <p>"It is healed," said the woman gently. "And it was your turn little
  sister. The wound is healed. Soon, you will have forgotten."</p>

  <p>The woman with the chalice knelt and set it to the wan, dry lips of her
  who was&mdash;withering. She drank of it, thirstily, to the last drop. The
  misty eyes cleared, they sparkled; the lips that had been so parched and pale
  grew red, the white body gleamed as though the waning light had been fed with
  new.</p>

  <p>"Sing, sisters," she cried, and shrilly. "Dance for me, sisters!"</p>

  <p>Again burst out that chant McKay had heard as he had floated through the
  mists upon the lake. Now, as then, despite his opened ears, he could
  distinguish no words, but clearly he understood its mingled themes&mdash; the
  joy of Spring's awakening, rebirth, with the green life streaming singing up
  through every bough, swelling the buds, burgeoning with tender leaves the
  branches; the dance of the trees in the scented winds of Spring; the drums of
  the jubilant rain on leafy hoods; passion of Summer sun pouring its golden
  flood down upon the trees; the moon passing with stately step and slow and
  green hands stretching up to her and drawing from her breast milk of silver
  fire; riot of wild gay winds with their mad pipings and strummings;&mdash;
  soft interlacing of boughs, the kiss of amorous leaves&mdash;all these and
  more, much more that McKay could not understand since it dealt with hidden,
  secret things for which man has no images, were in that chanting.</p>

  <p>And all these and more were in the measures, the rhythms of the dancing of
  those strange, green eyed women and brown skinned men; something incredibly
  ancient yet young as the speeding moment, something of a world before and
  beyond man.</p>

  <p>McKay listened, McKay watched, lost in wonder; his own world more than
  half forgotten; his mind meshed in web of green sorcery.</p>

  <p>The woman beside him touched his arm. She pointed to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yet she withers," she said. "And not all our life, if we poured it
  through her lips, could save her."</p>

  <p>He looked; he saw that the red was draining slowly from the girl's lips,
  the luminous life tides waning; the eyes that had been so bright were misting
  and growing dull once more, suddenly a great pity and a great rage shook him.
  He knelt beside her, took her hands in his.</p>

  <p>"Take them away! Take away your hands! They burn me!" she moaned.</p>

  <p>"He tries to help you," whispered the green clad man, gently. But he
  reached over and drew McKay's hands away.</p>

  <p>"Not so can you help her," said the woman.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" McKay arose, looked helplessly from one to the other.
  "What can I do to help?"</p>

  <p>The chanting died, the dance stopped. A silence fell and he felt upon him
  the eyes of all. They were tense&mdash;waiting. The woman took his hands.
  Their touch was cool and sent a strange sweetness sweeping through his
  veins.</p>

  <p>"There are three men yonder," she said. "They hate us. Soon we shall be as
  she is there&mdash;withering. They have sworn it, and as they have sworn so
  will they do. Unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused; and McKay felt the stirrings of a curious unease. The
  moonbeam-dancing motes in her eyes had changed to tiny sparklings of red. In
  a way, deep down, they terrified him&mdash;those red sparklings.</p>

  <p>"Three men?"&mdash;in his clouded mind was the memory of Polleau and his
  two strong sons. "Three men," he repeated, stupidly&mdash;"But what are three
  men to you who are so many? What could three men do against those stalwart
  gallants of yours?"</p>

  <p>"No," she shook her head. "No&mdash;there is nothing our&mdash;men
  &mdash;can do; nothing that we can do. Once, night and day, we were gay. Now
  we fear&mdash;night and day. They mean to destroy us. Our kin have warned us.
  And our kin cannot help us. Those three are masters of blade and flame.
  Against blade and flame we are helpless."</p>

  <p>"Blade and flame!" echoed the listeners. "Against blade and flame we are
  helpless."</p>

  <p>"Surely will they destroy us," murmured the woman. "We shall wither all of
  us. Like her there, or burn&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she threw white arms around McKay's neck. She pressed her lithe
  body close to him. Her scarlet mouth sought and found his lips and clung to
  them. Through all McKay's body ran swift, sweet flames, green fire of desire.
  His own arms went round her, crushed her to him.</p>

  <p>"You shall not die!" he cried. "No&mdash;by God, you shall not!"</p>

  <p>She drew back her head, looked deep into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"They have sworn to destroy us," she said, "and soon. With blade and flame
  they will destroy us&mdash;these three&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless?" he asked, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Unless you&mdash;slay them first!" she answered.</p>

  <p>A cold shock ran through McKay, chilling the green sweet fires of his
  desire. He dropped his arm from around the woman; thrust her from him. For an
  instant she trembled before him.</p>

  <p>"Slay!" he heard her whisper&mdash;and she was gone. The spectral trees
  wavered; their outlines thickened out of immateriality into substance. The
  green translucence darkened. He had a swift vertiginous moment as though he
  swung between two worlds. He closed his eyes. The vertigo passed and he
  opened them, looked around him.</p>

  <p>McKay stood on the lakeward skirts of the little coppice. There were no
  shadows flitting, no sign of the white women and the swarthy, green clad men.
  His feet were on green moss; gone was the soft golden carpet with its blue
  starlets. Birches and firs clustered solidly before him. At his left was a
  sturdy fir in whose needled arms a broken birch tree lay withering. It was
  the birch that Polleau's men had so wantonly slashed down. For an instant he
  saw within the fir and birch the immaterial outlines of the green clad man
  and the slim girl who withered. For that instant birch and fir and girl and
  man seemed one and the same. He stepped back, and his hands touched the
  smooth, cool bark of another birch that rose close at his right.</p>

  <p>Upon his hands the touch of that bark was like&mdash;was like?&mdash; yes,
  curiously was it like the touch of the long slim hands of the woman of the
  scarlet lips. But it gave him none of that alien rapture, that pulse of green
  life her touch had brought. Yet, now as then, the touch steadied him. The
  outlines of girl and man were gone.</p>

  <p>He looked upon nothing but a sturdy fir with a withering birch fallen into
  its branches.</p>

  <p>McKay stood there, staring, wondering, like a man who has but half
  awakened from dream. And suddenly a little wind stirred the leaves of the
  rounded birch beside him. The leaves murmured, sighed. The wind grew stronger
  and the leaves whispered.</p>

  <p>"Slay!" he heard them whisper&mdash;and again: "Slay! Help us! Slay!"</p>

  <p>And the whisper was the voice of the woman of the scarlet lips!</p>

  <p>Rage, swift and unreasoning, sprang up in McKay. He began to run up
  through the coppice, up to where he knew was the old lodge in which dwelt
  Polleau and his sons. And as he ran the wind blew stronger, and louder and
  louder grew the whisperings of the trees.</p>

  <p>"Slay!" they whispered. "Slay them! Save us! Slay!"</p>

  <p>"I will slay! I will save you!" McKay, panting, hammer pulse beating in
  his ears, rushing through the woods heard himself answering that ever louder,
  ever more insistent command. And in his mind was but one desire&mdash;to
  clutch the throats of Polleau and his sons, to crack their necks; to stand by
  them then and watch them wither; wither like that slim girl in the arms of
  the green clad man.</p>

  <p>So crying, he came to the edge of the coppice and burst from it out into a
  flood of sunshine. For a hundred feet he ran, and then he was aware that the
  whispering command was stilled; that he heard no more that maddening rustling
  of wrathful leaves. A spell seemed to have been loosed from him; it was as
  though he had broken through some web of sorcery. McKay stopped, dropped upon
  the ground, buried his face in the grasses.</p>

  <p>He lay there, marshaling his thoughts into some order of sanity. What had
  he been about to do? To rush berserk upon those three who lived in the old
  lodge and&mdash;kill them! And for what? Because that elfin, scarlet lipped
  woman whose kisses he still could feel upon his mouth had bade him! Because
  the whispering trees of the little wood had maddened him with that same
  command!</p>

  <p>And for this he had been about to kill three men!</p>

  <p>What were that woman and her sisters and the green clad swarthy gallants
  of theirs? Illusions of some waking dream&mdash;phantoms born of the hypnosis
  of the swirling mists through which he had rowed and floated across the lake?
  Such things were not uncommon. McKay knew of those who by watching the
  shifting clouds could create and dwell for a time with wide open eyes within
  some similar land of fantasy; knew others who needed but to stare at smoothly
  falling water to set themselves within a world of waking dream; there were
  those who could summon dreams by gazing into a ball of crystal, others found
  their phantoms in saucers of shining ebon ink.</p>

  <p>Might not the moving mists have laid those same hypnotic fingers upon his
  own mind&mdash;and his love for the trees the sense of appeal that he had
  felt so long and his memory of the wanton slaughter of the slim birch have
  all combined to paint upon his drugged consciousness the phantasms he had
  beheld?</p>

  <p>Then in the flood of sunshine the spell had melted, his consciousness
  leaped awake?</p>

  <p>McKay arose to his feet, shakily enough. He looked back at the coppice.
  There was no wind now, the leaves were silent, motionless. Again he saw it as
  the caravan of demoiselles with their marching knights and troubadours. But
  no longer was it gay. The words of the scarlet lipped woman came back to him
  &mdash;that gaiety had fled and fear had taken its place. Dream phantom or
  &mdash;dryad, whatever she was, half of that at least was truth.</p>

  <p>He turned, a plan forming in his mind. Reason with himself as he might,
  something deep within him stubbornly asserted the reality of his experience.
  At any rate, he told himself, the little wood was far too beautiful to be
  despoiled. He would put aside the experience as dream&mdash;but he would save
  the little wood for the essence of beauty that it held in its green cup.</p>

  <p>The old lodge was about a quarter of a mile away. A path led up to it
  through the ragged fields. McKay walked up the path, climbed rickety steps
  and paused, listening. He heard voices and knocked. The door was flung open
  and old Polleau stood there, peering at him through half shut, suspicious
  eyes. One of the sons stood close behind him. They stared at McKay with grim,
  hostile faces.</p>

  <p>He thought he heard a faint, far off despairing whisper from the distant
  wood. And it was as though the pair in the doorway heard it too, for their
  gaze shifted from him to the coppice, and he saw hatred nicker swiftly across
  their grim faces; their gaze swept back to him.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" demanded Polleau, curtly.</p>

  <p>"I am a neighbor of yours, stopping at the inn&mdash;" began McKay,
  courteously.</p>

  <p>"I know who you are," Polleau interrupted brusquely, "But what is it that
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"I find the air of this place good for me," McKay stifled a rising anger.
  "I am thinking of staying for a year or more until my health is fully
  recovered. I would like to buy some of your land and build me a lodge upon
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, M'sieu?" there was acid politeness now in the powerful old man's
  voice. "But is it permitted to ask why you do not remain at the inn? Its fare
  is excellent and you are well liked there."</p>

  <p>"I have desire to be alone," replied McKay. "I do not like people too
  close to me. I would have my own land, and sleep under my own roof."</p>

  <p>"But why come to me?" asked Polleau. "There are many places upon the far
  side of the lake that you could secure. It is happy there, and this side is
  not happy, M'sieu. But tell me, what part of my land is it that you
  desire?"</p>

  <p>"That little wood yonder," answered McKay, and pointed to the coppice.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I thought so!" whispered Polleau, and between him and his sons passed
  a look of bitter understanding. He looked at McKay, somberly.</p>

  <p>"That wood is not for sale, M'sieu," he said at last. "I can afford to pay
  well for what I want," said McKay. "Name your price."</p>

  <p>"It is not for sale," repeated Polleau, stolidly, "at any price."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come," laughed McKay, although his heart sank at the finality in that
  answer. "You have many acres and what is it but a few trees? I can afford to
  gratify my fancies. I will give you all the worth of your other land for
  it."</p>

  <p>"You have asked what that place that you so desire is, and you have
  answered that it is but a few trees," said Polleau, slowly, and the tall son
  behind him laughed, abruptly, maliciously. "But it is more than that, M'sieu
  &mdash;Oh, much more than that. And you know it, else why would you pay such
  price? Yes, you know it&mdash;since you know also that we are ready to
  destroy it, and you would save it. And who told you all that, M'sieu?" he
  snarled.</p>

  <p>There was such malignance in the face thrust suddenly close to McKay's,
  teeth bared by uplifted lip, that involuntarily he recoiled.</p>

  <p>"But a few trees!" snarled old Polleau. "Then who told him what we mean to
  do&mdash;eh, Pierre?"</p>

  <p>Again the son laughed. And at that laughter McKay felt within him
  resurgence of his own blind hatred as he had fled through the whispering
  wood. He mastered himself, turned away, there was nothing he could do&mdash;
  now. Polleau halted him.</p>

  <p>"M'sieu," he said, "Wait. Enter. There is something I would tell you;
  something too I would show you. Something, perhaps, that I would ask
  you."</p>

  <p>He stood aside, bowing with a rough courtesy. McKay walked through the
  doorway. Polleau with his son followed him. He entered a large, dim room
  whose ceiling was spanned with smoke blackened beams. From these beams hung
  onion strings and herbs and smoke cured meats. On one side was a wide
  fireplace. Huddled beside it sat Polleau's other son. He glanced up as they
  entered and McKay saw that a bandage covered one side of his head, hiding his
  left eye. McKay recognized him as the one who had cut down the slim birch.
  The blow of the fir, he reflected with a certain satisfaction, had been no
  futile one.</p>

  <p>Old Polleau strode over to that son.</p>

  <p>"Look, M'sieu," he said and lifted the bandage.</p>

  <p>McKay with a faint tremor of horror, saw a gaping blackened socket, red
  rimmed and eyeless.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Polleau!" he cried. "But this man needs medical attention. I
  know something of wounds. Let me go across the lake and bring back my kit. I
  will attend him."</p>

  <p>Old Polleau shook his head, although his grim face for the first time
  softened. He drew the bandages back in place.</p>

  <p>"It heals," he said. "We have some skill in such things. You saw what did
  it. You watched from your boat as the cursed tree struck him. The eye was
  crushed and lay upon his cheek. I cut it away. Now he heals. We do not need
  your aid, M'sieu."</p>

  <p>"Yet he ought not have cut the birch," muttered McKay, more to himself
  than to be heard.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked old Polleau, fiercely, "Since it hated him."</p>

  <p>McKay stared at him. What did this old peasant know? The words
  strengthened that deep stubborn conviction that what he had seen and heard in
  the coppice had been actuality&mdash;no dream. And still more did Polleau's
  next words strengthen that conviction.</p>

  <p>"M'sieu," he said, "you come here as ambassador&mdash;of a sort. The wood
  has spoken to you. Well, as ambassador I shall speak to you. Four centuries
  my people have lived in this place. A century we have owned this land.
  M'sieu, in all those years there has been no moment that the trees have not
  hated us&mdash;nor we the trees.</p>

  <p>"For all those hundred years there have been hatred and battle between us
  and the forest. My father, M'sieu, was crushed by a tree; my elder brother
  crippled by another. My father's father, woodsman that he was, was lost in
  the forest&mdash;he came back to us with mind gone, raving of wood women who
  had bewitched and mocked him, luring him into swamp and fen and tangled
  thicket, tormenting him. In every generation the trees have taken their toll
  of us&mdash;women as well as men&mdash;maiming or killing us."</p>

  <p>"Accidents," interrupted McKay. "This is childish, Polleau. You cannot
  blame the trees."</p>

  <p>"In your heart you do not believe so," said Polleau. "Listen, the feud is
  an ancient one. Centuries ago it began when we were serfs, slaves of the
  nobles. To cook, to keep us warm in winter, they let us pick up the fagots,
  the dead branches and twigs that dropped from the trees. But if we cut down a
  tree to keep us warm, to keep our women and our children warm, yes, if we but
  tore down a branch&mdash;they hanged us, or they threw us into dungeons to
  rot, or whipped us till our backs were red lattices.</p>

  <p>"They had their broad fields, the nobles&mdash;but we must raise our food
  in the patches where the trees disdained to grow. And if they did thrust
  themselves into our poor patches, then, M'sieu, we must let them have their
  way&mdash;or be flogged, or be thrown into the dungeons or be hanged.</p>

  <p>"They pressed us in&mdash;the trees," the old man's voice grew sharp with
  fanatic hatred. "They stole our fields and they took the food from the mouths
  of our children; they dropped their fagots to us like dole to beggars; they
  tempted us to warmth when the cold struck our bones&mdash;and they bore us as
  fruit a-swing at the end of the foresters' ropes if we yielded to their
  tempting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, M'sieu&mdash;we died of cold that they might live! Our children died
  of hunger that their young might find root space! They despised us &mdash;the
  trees! We died that they might live&mdash;and we were men!</p>

  <p>"Then, M'sieu came the Revolution and the freedom. Ah, M'sieu, then we
  took our toll! Great logs roaring in the winter cold&mdash;no more huddling
  over the alms of fagots. Fields where the trees had been&mdash;no more
  starving of our children that theirs might live. Now the trees were the
  slaves and we the masters.</p>

  <p>"And the trees knew and they hated us!</p>

  <p>"But blow for blow, a hundred of their lives for each life of ours&mdash;
  we have returned their hatred. With axe and torch we have fought
  them&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The trees!" shrieked Polleau, suddenly, eyes blazing red rage, face
  writhing, foam at the corners of his mouth and gray hair clutched in rigid
  hands&mdash;"The cursed trees! Armies of the trees creeping&mdash;
  creeping&mdash;closer, ever closer&mdash;crushing us in! Stealing our fields
  as they did of old! Building their dungeon round us as they built of old the
  dungeons of stone! Creeping&mdash;creeping! Armies of trees! Legions of
  trees! The trees! The cursed trees!"</p>

  <p>McKay listened, appalled. Here was crimson heart of hate. Madness! But
  what was at the root of it? Some deep inherited instinct, coming down from
  forefathers who had hated the forest as the symbol of their masters.
  Forefathers whose tides of hatred had overflowed to the green life on which
  the nobles had laid their tabu&mdash;as one neglected child will hate the
  favorite on whom love and gifts are lavished? In such warped minds the
  crushing fall of a tree, the maiming sweep of a branch, might well appear as
  deliberate, the natural growth of the forest seem the implacable advance of
  an enemy.</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;the blow of the fir as the cut birch fell had been
  deliberate! and there had been those women of the wood&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Patience," the standing son touched the old man's shoulder. "Patience!
  Soon we strike our blow."</p>

  <p>Some of the frenzy died out of Polleau's face.</p>

  <p>"Though we cut down a hundred," he whispered, "By the hundred they return!
  But one of us, when they strike&mdash;he does not return. No! They have
  numbers and they have&mdash;time. We are now but three, and we have little
  time. They watch us as we go through the forest, alert to trip, to strike, to
  crush!</p>

  <p>"But M'sieu," he turned blood-shot eyes to McKay. "We strike our blow,
  even as Pierre has said. We strike at the coppice that you so desire. We
  strike there because it is the very heart of the forest. There the secret
  life of the forest runs at full tide. We know&mdash;and you know! Something
  that, destroyed, will take the heart out of the forest&mdash;will make it
  know us for its masters."</p>

  <p>"The women!" the standing son's eyes glittered, "I have seen the women
  there! The fair women with the shining skins who invite&mdash;and mock and
  vanish before hands can seize them."</p>

  <p>"The fair women who peer into our windows in the night&mdash;and mock us!"
  muttered the eyeless son.</p>

  <p>"They shall mock no more!" shouted Polleau, the frenzy again taking him.
  "Soon they shall lie, dying! All of them&mdash;all of them! They die!"</p>

  <p>He caught McKay by the shoulders, shook him like a child.</p>

  <p>"Go tell them that!" he shouted. "Say to them that this very day we
  destroy them. Say to them it is we who will laugh when winter comes and we
  watch their round white bodies blaze in this hearth of ours and warm us! Go
  &mdash;tell them that!"</p>

  <p>He spun McKay around, pushed him to the door, opened it and flung him
  staggering down the steps. He heard the tall son laugh, the door close. Blind
  with rage he rushed up the steps and hurled himself against the door. Again
  the tall son laughed. McKay beat at the door with clenched fists, cursing.
  The three within paid no heed. Despair began to dull his rage. Could the
  trees help him&mdash;counsel him? He turned and walked slowly down the field
  path to the little wood.</p>

  <p>Slowly and ever more slowly he went as he neared it. He had failed. He was
  a messenger bearing a warrant of death. The birches were motionless; their
  leaves hung listlessly. It was as though they knew he had failed. He paused
  at the edge of the coppice. He looked at his watch, noted with faint surprise
  that already it was high noon. Short shrift enough had the little wood. The
  work of destruction would not be long delayed.</p>

  <p>McKay squared his shoulders and passed in between the trees. It was
  strangely silent in the coppice. And it was mournful. He had a sense of life
  brooding around him, withdrawn into itself; sorrowing. He passed through the
  silent, mournful wood until he reached the spot where the rounded, gleaming
  barked tree stood close to the fir that held the withering birch. Still there
  was no sound, no movement. He laid his hands upon the cool bark of the
  rounded tree.</p>

  <p>"Let me see again!" he whispered. "Let me hear! Speak to me!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Again and again he called. The coppice was silent. He
  wandered through it, whispering, calling. The slim birches stood, passive
  with limbs and leaves adroop like listless arms and hands of captive maids
  awaiting with dull woe the will of conquerors. The firs seemed to crouch like
  hopeless men with heads in hands. His heart ached to the woe that filled the
  little wood, this hopeless submission of the trees.</p>

  <p>When, he wondered, would Polleau strike. He looked at his watch again; an
  hour had gone by. How long would Polleau wait? He dropped to the moss, back
  against a smooth bole.</p>

  <p>And suddenly it seemed to McKay that he was a madman&mdash;as mad as
  Polleau and his sons. Calmly, he went over the old peasant's indictment of
  the forest; recalled the face and eyes filled with the fanatic hate. Madness!
  After all, the trees were&mdash;only trees. Polleau and his sons&mdash;so he
  reasoned&mdash;had transferred to them the bitter hatred their forefathers
  had felt for those old lords who had enslaved them; had laid upon them too
  all the bitterness of their own struggle to exist in this high forest land.
  When they struck at the trees, it was the ghosts of these forefathers
  striking at the nobles who had oppressed them; it was themselves striking
  against their own destiny. The trees were but symbols. It was the warped
  minds of Polleau and his sons that clothed them in false semblance of
  conscious life in blind striving to wreak vengeance against the ancient
  masters and the destiny that had made their lives hard and unceasing battle
  against Nature. The nobles were long dead; destiny can be brought to grips by
  no man. But the trees were here and alive. Clothed in mirage, through them
  the driving lust for vengeance could be sated.</p>

  <p>And he, McKay, was it not his own deep love and sympathy for the trees
  that similarly had clothed them in that false semblance of conscious life?
  Had he not built his own mirage? The trees did not really mourn, could not
  suffer, could not&mdash;know. It was his own sorrow that he had transferred
  to them; only his own sorrow that he felt echoing back to him from them.</p>

  <p>The trees were&mdash;only trees.</p>

  <p>Instantly, upon the heels of that thought, as though it were an answer, he
  was aware that the trunk against which he leaned was trembling; that the
  whole coppice was trembling; that all the little leaves were shaking,
  tremulously.</p>

  <p>McKay, bewildered, leaped to his feet. Reason told him that it was the
  wind&mdash;yet there was no wind!</p>

  <p>And as he stood there, a sighing arose as though a mournful breeze were
  blowing through the trees&mdash;and again there was no wind!</p>

  <p>Louder grew the sighing and within it now faint wailings.</p>

  <p>"They come! They come! Farewell sisters! Sisters&mdash;farewell!"</p>

  <p>Clearly he heard the mournful whispers.</p>

  <p>McKay began to run through the trees to the trail that led out to the
  fields of the old lodge. And as he ran the wood darkened as though clear
  shadows gathered in it, as though vast unseen wings hovered over it. The
  trembling of the coppice increased; bough touched bough, clung to each other;
  and louder became the sorrowful crying:</p>

  <p>"Farewell sister! Sister&mdash;farewell!"</p>

  <p>McKay burst out into the open. Halfway between him and the lodge were
  Polleau and his sons. They saw him; they pointed and lifted mockingly to him
  bright axes. He crouched, waiting for them to come, all fine spun theories
  gone and rising within him that same rage that hours before had sent him out
  to slay.</p>

  <p>So crouching, he heard from the forested hills a roaring clamor. From
  every quarter it came, wrathful, menacing; like the voices of legions of
  great trees bellowing through the horns of tempest. The clamor maddened
  McKay; fanned the flame of rage to white heat.</p>

  <p>If the three men heard it, they gave no sign. They came on steadily,
  jeering at him, waving their keen blades. He ran to meet them.</p>

  <p>"Go back!" he shouted. "Go back, Polleau! I warn you!"</p>

  <p>"He warns us!" jeered Polleau. "He&mdash;Pierre, Jean&mdash;he warns
  us!"</p>

  <p>The old peasant's arm shot out and his hand caught McKay's shoulder with a
  grip that pinched to the bone. The arm flexed and hurled him against the
  unmaimed son. The son caught him, twisted him about and whirled him headlong
  a dozen yards, crashing him through the brush at the skirt of the wood.</p>

  <p>McKay sprang to his feet howling like a wolf. The clamor of the forest had
  grown stronger.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" it roared. "Kill!"</p>

  <p>The unmaimed son had raised his axe. He brought it down upon the trunk of
  a birch, half splitting it with one blow. McKay heard a wail go up from the
  little wood. Before the axe could be withdrawn he had crashed a fist in the
  axe wielder's face. The head of Polleau's son rocked back; he yelped, and
  before McKay could strike again had wrapped strong arms around him, crushing
  breath from him. McKay relaxed, went limp, and the son loosened his grip.
  Instantly McKay slipped out of it and struck again, springing aside to avoid
  the rib breaking clasp. Polleau's son was quicker than he, the long arms
  caught him. But as the arms tightened, there was the sound of sharp
  splintering and the birch into which the axe had bitten toppled. It struck
  the ground directly behind the wrestling men. Its branches seemed to reach
  out and clutch at the feet of Polleau's son.</p>

  <p>He tripped and fell backward, McKay upon him. The shock of the fall broke
  his grip and again McKay writhed free. Again he was upon his feet, and again
  Polleau's strong son, quick as he, faced him. Twice McKay's blows found their
  mark beneath his heart before once more the long arms trapped him. But their
  grip was weaker; McKay felt that now his strength was equal.</p>

  <p>Round and round they rocked, McKay straining to break away. They fell, and
  over they rolled and over, arms and legs locked, each striving to free a hand
  to grip the other's throat. Around them ran Polleau and the one-eyed son,
  shouting encouragement to Pierre, yet neither daring to strike at McKay lest
  the blow miss and be taken by the other.</p>

  <p>And all that time McKay heard the little wood shouting. Gone from it now
  was all mournfulness, all passive resignation. The wood was alive and raging.
  He saw the trees shake and bend as though torn by a tempest. Dimly he
  realized that the others must hear none of this, see none of it; as dimly
  wondered why this should be.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" shouted the coppice&mdash;and over its tumult he heard the roar of
  the great forest:</p>

  <p>"Kill! Kill!"</p>

  <p>He became aware of two shadowy shapes, shadowy shapes of swarthy green
  clad men, that pressed close to him as he rolled and fought.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" they whispered. "Let his blood flow! Kill! Let his blood
  flow!"</p>

  <p>He tore a wrist free from the son's clutch. Instantly he felt within his
  hand the hilt of a knife.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" whispered the shadowy men.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" shrieked the coppice.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" roared the forest.</p>

  <p>McKay's free arm swept up and plunged the knife into the throat of
  Polleau's son! He heard a choking sob; heard Polleau shriek; felt the hot
  blood spurt in face and over hand; smelt its salt and faintly acrid odor. The
  encircling arms dropped from him; he reeled to his feet.</p>

  <p>As though the blood had been a bridge, the shadowy men leaped from
  immateriality into substances. One threw himself upon the man McKay had
  stabbed; the other hurled upon old Polleau. The maimed son turned and fled,
  howling with terror. A white woman sprang out from the shadow, threw herself
  at his feet, clutched them and brought him down. Another woman and another
  dropped upon him. The note of his shrieking changed from fear to agony; then
  died abruptly into silence.</p>

  <p>And now McKay could see none of the three, neither old Polleau or his
  sons, for the green clad men and the white women covered them!</p>

  <p>McKay stood stupidly, staring at his red hands. The roar of the forest had
  changed to a deep triumphal chanting. The coppice was mad with joy. The trees
  had become thin phantoms etched in emerald translucent air as they had been
  when first the green sorcery had enmeshed him. And all around him wove and
  danced the slim, gleaming women of the wood.</p>

  <p>They ringed him, their song bird-sweet and shrill; jubilant. Beyond them
  he saw gliding toward him the woman of the misty pillars whose kisses had
  poured the sweet green fire into his veins. Her arms were outstretched to
  him, her strange wide eyes were rapt on his, her white body gleamed with the
  moon radiance, her red lips were parted and smiling&mdash;a scarlet chalice
  filled with the promise of undreamed ecstasies. The dancing circle, chanting,
  broke to let her through.</p>

  <p>Abruptly, a horror filled McKay. Not of this fair woman, not of her
  jubilant sisters&mdash;but of himself.</p>

  <p>He had killed! And the wound the war had left in his soul, the wound he
  thought had healed, had opened.</p>

  <p>He rushed through the broken circle, thrust the shining woman aside with
  his blood stained hands and ran, weeping, toward the lake shore. The singing
  ceased. He heard little cries, tender, appealing; little cries of pity; soft
  voices calling on him to stop, to return. Behind him was the sound of little
  racing feet, light as the fall of leaves upon the moss.</p>

  <p>McKay ran on. The coppice lightened, the beach was before him. He heard
  the fair woman call him, felt the touch of her hand upon his shoulder. He did
  not heed her. He ran across the narrow strip of beach, thrust his boat out
  into the water and wading through the shallows threw himself into it.</p>

  <p>He lay there for a moment, sobbing; then drew himself up, caught at the
  oars. He looked back at the shore now a score of feet away. At the edge of
  the coppice stood the woman, staring at him with pitying, wise eyes. Behind
  her clustered the white faces of her sisters, the swarthy faces of the green
  clad men.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" the woman whispered, and held out to him slender arms.</p>

  <p>McKay hesitated, his horror lessening in that clear, wise, pitying gaze.
  He half swung the boat around. His gaze dropped upon his blood-stained hands
  and again the hysteria gripped him. One thought only was in his mind&mdash;
  to get far away from where Polleau's son lay with his throat ripped open, to
  put the lake between that body and him.</p>

  <p>Head bent low, McKay bowed to the oars, skimming swiftly outward. When he
  looked up a curtain of mist had fallen between him and the shore. It hid the
  coppice and from beyond it there came to him no sound. He glanced behind him,
  back toward the inn. The mists swung there, too, concealing it.</p>

  <p>McKay gave silent thanks for these vaporous curtains that hid him from
  both the dead and the alive. He slipped limply under the thwarts. After a
  while he leaned over the side of the boat and, shuddering, washed the blood
  from his hands. He scrubbed the oar blades where his hands had left red
  patches. He ripped the lining out of his coat and drenching it in the lake he
  cleansed his face. He took off the stained coat, wrapped it with the lining
  round the anchor stone in the skiff and sunk it in the lake. There were other
  stains upon his shirt; but these he would have to let be.</p>

  <p>For a time he rowed aimlessly, finding in the exertion a lessening of his
  soul sickness. His numbed mind began to function, analyzing his plight,
  planning how to meet the future&mdash;how to save him.</p>

  <p>What ought he do? Confess that he had killed Polleau's son? What reason
  could he give? Only that he had killed because the man had been about to cut
  down some trees&mdash;trees that were his father's to do with as he
  willed!</p>

  <p>And if he told of the wood woman, the wood women, the shadowy shapes of
  their green gallants who had helped him&mdash;who would believe?</p>

  <p>They would think him mad&mdash;mad as he half believed himself to be.</p>

  <p>No, none would believe him. None! Nor would confession bring back life to
  him he had slain. No; he would not confess.</p>

  <p>But stay&mdash;another thought came! Might he not be&mdash;accused? What
  actually had happened to old Polleau and his other son? He had taken it for
  granted that they were dead; that they had died under those bodies white and
  swarthy. But had they? While the green sorcery had meshed him he had held no
  doubt of this&mdash;else why the jubilance of the little wood, the triumphant
  chanting of the forest?</p>

  <p>Were they dead&mdash;Polleau and the one-eyed son? Clearly it came to him
  that they had not heard as he had, had not seen as he had. To them McKay and
  his enemy had been but two men battling, in a woodland glade; nothing more
  than that&mdash;until the last! Until the last? Had they seen more than that
  even then?</p>

  <p>No, all that he could depend upon as real was that he had ripped out the
  throat of one of old Polleau's sons. That was the one unassailable verity. He
  had washed the blood of that man from his hands and his face.</p>

  <p>All else might have been mirage&mdash;but one thing was true. He had
  murdered Polleau's son!</p>

  <p>Remorse? He had thought that he had felt it. He knew now that he did not;
  that he had no shadow of remorse for what he had done. It had been panic that
  had shaken him, panic realization of the strangenesses, reaction from the
  battle lust, echoes of the war. He had been justified in that&mdash;
  execution. What right had those men to destroy the little wood; to wipe
  wantonly its beauty away?</p>

  <p>None! He was glad that he had killed!</p>

  <p>At that moment McKay would gladly have turned his boat and raced away to
  drink of the crimson chalice of the wood woman's lips. But the mists were
  raising, He saw that he was close to the landing of the inn.</p>

  <p>There was no one about. Now was his time to remove the last of those
  accusing stains. After that&mdash;</p>

  <p>Quickly he drew up, fastened the skiff, slipped unseen to his room. He
  locked the door, started to undress. Then sudden sleep swept over him like a
  wave, drew him helplessly down into ocean depths of sleep.</p>

  <p>A knocking at the door awakened McKay, and the innkeeper's voice summoned
  him to dinner. Sleepily, he answered, and as the old man's footsteps died
  away, he roused himself. His eyes fell upon his shirt and the great stains
  now rusty brown. Puzzled, he stared at them for a moment, then full memory
  clicked back in place.</p>

  <p>He walked to the window. It was dusk. A wind was blowing and the trees
  were singing, all the little leaves dancing; the forest hummed a cheerful
  vespers. Gone was all the unease, all the inarticulate trouble and the fear.
  The forest was tranquil and it was happy.</p>

  <p>He sought the coppice through the gathering twilight. Its demoiselles were
  dancing lightly in the wind, leafy hoods dipping, leafy skirts ablow. Beside
  them marched the green troubadours, carefree, waving their needled arms. Gay
  was the little wood, gay as when its beauty had first drawn him to it.</p>

  <p>McKay undressed, hid the stained shirt in his traveling trunk, bathed and
  put on a fresh outfit, sauntered down to dinner. He ate excellently. Wonder
  now and then crossed his mind that he felt no regret, no sorrow even, for the
  man he had killed. Half he was inclined to believe it all a dream&mdash;so
  little of any emotion did he feel. He had even ceased to think of what
  discovery might mean.</p>

  <p>His mind was quiet; he heard the forest chanting to him that there was
  nothing he need fear; and when he sat for a time that night upon the balcony
  a peace that was half an ecstasy stole in upon him from the murmuring woods
  and enfolded him. Cradled by it he slept dreamlessly.</p>

  <p>McKay did not go far from the inn that next day. The little wood danced
  gaily and beckoned him, but he paid no heed. Something whispered to wait, to
  keep the lake between him and it until word came of what lay or had lain
  there. And the peace still was on him.</p>

  <p>Only the old innkeeper seemed to grow uneasy as the hours went by. He went
  often to the landing, scanning the further shore.</p>

  <p>"It is strange," he said at last to McKay as the sun was dipping behind
  the summits. "Polleau was to see me here today. He never breaks his word. If
  he could not come he would have sent one of his sons."</p>

  <p>McKay nodded, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"There is another thing I do not understand," went on the old man. "I have
  seen no smoke from the lodge all day. It is as though they were not
  there."</p>

  <p>"Where could they be?" asked McKay, indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," the voice was more perturbed. "It all troubles me,
  M'sieu. Polleau is hard, yes; but he is my neighbor. Perhaps an
  accident&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They would let you know soon enough if there was anything wrong," McKay
  said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, but&mdash;" the old man hesitated. "If he does not come tomorrow
  and again I see no smoke I will go to him," he ended.</p>

  <p>McKay felt a little shock run through him&mdash;tomorrow then he would
  know, definitely know, what it was that had happened in the little wood.</p>

  <p>"I would if I were you," he said. "I'd not wait too long either. After all
  &mdash;well, accidents do happen."</p>

  <p>"Will you go with me, M'sieu," asked the old man.</p>

  <p>"No!" whispered the warning voice within McKay. "No! Do not go!"</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said, aloud. "But I've some writing to do. If you should need
  me send back your man. I'll come."</p>

  <p>And all that night he slept, again dreamlessly, while the crooning forest
  cradled him.</p>

  <p>The morning passed without sign from the opposite shore. An hour after
  noon he watched the old innkeeper and his man row across the lake. And
  suddenly McKay's composure was shaken, his serene certainty wavered. He
  unstrapped his field glasses and kept them on the pair until they had beached
  the boat and entered the coppice. His heart was beating uncomfortably, his
  hands felt hot and his lips dry. He scanned the shore. How long had they been
  in the wood? It must have been an hour! What were they doing there? What had
  they found? He looked at his watch, incredulously. Less than fifteen minutes
  had passed.</p>

  <p>Slowly the seconds ticked by. And it was all of an hour indeed before he
  saw them come out upon the shore and drag their boat into the water. McKay,
  throat curiously dry, a deafening pulse within his ears, steadied himself;
  forced himself to stroll leisurely down to the landing.</p>

  <p>"Everything all right?" he called as they were near. They did not answer;
  but as the skiff warped against the landing they looked up at him and on
  their faces were stamped horror and a great wonder.</p>

  <p>"They are dead, M'sieu," whispered the innkeeper. "Polleau and his two
  sons&mdash;all dead!"</p>

  <p>McKay's heart gave a great leap, a swift faintness took him.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" he cried. "What killed them?"</p>

  <p>"What but the trees, M'sieu?" answered the old man, and McKay thought his
  gaze dwelt upon him strangely. "The trees killed them. See&mdash;we went up
  the little path through the wood, and close to its end we found it blocked by
  fallen trees. The flies buzzed round those trees, M'sieu, so we searched
  there. They were under them, Polleau and his sons. A fir had fallen upon
  Polleau and had crushed in his chest. Another son we found beneath a fir and
  upturned birches. They had broken his back, and an eye had been torn out
  &mdash;but that was no new wound, the latter." He paused.</p>

  <p>"It must have been a sudden wind," said his man. "Yet I never knew of a
  wind like that must have been. There were no trees down except those that lay
  upon them. And of those it was as though they had leaped out of the ground!
  Yes, as though they had leaped out of the ground upon them. Or it was as
  though giants had torn them out for clubs. They were not broken&mdash;their
  roots were bare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the other son&mdash;Polleau had two?"&mdash;try as he might, McKay
  could not keep the tremor out of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Pierre," said the old man, and again McKay felt that strange quality in
  his gaze. "He lay beneath a fir. His throat was torn out!"</p>

  <p>"His throat torn out!" whispered McKay, His knife! The knife that had been
  slipped into his hand by the shadowy shapes!</p>

  <p>"His throat was torn out," repeated the innkeeper. "And in it still was
  the broken branch that had done it. A broken branch, M'sieu, pointed as a
  knife. It must have caught Pierre as the fir fell and ripping through his
  throat&mdash;been broken off as the tree crashed."</p>

  <p>McKay stood, mind whirling in wild conjecture. "You said&mdash;a broken
  branch?" McKay asked through lips gone white.</p>

  <p>"A broken branch, M'sieu," the innkeeper's eyes searched him. "It was very
  plain&mdash;what it was that happened. Jacques," he turned to his man. "Go up
  to the house."</p>

  <p>He watched until the man shuffled out of sight. "Yet not all plain,
  M'sieu," he spoke low to McKay. "For in Pierre's hand I found&mdash;
  this."</p>

  <p>He reached into a pocket and drew out a button from which hung a strip of
  cloth. Cloth and button had once been part of that blood-stained coat which
  McKay had sunk within the lake; torn away no doubt when death had struck
  Polleau's son!</p>

  <p>McKay strove to speak. The old man raised his hand. Button and cloth fell
  from it, into the water. A wave took it and floated it away; another and
  another. They watched it silently until it had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Tell me nothing, M'sieu," the old innkeeper turned to him, "Polleau was
  hard and hard men, too, were his sons. The trees hated them. The trees killed
  them. And now the trees are happy. That is all. And the&mdash;souvenir
  &mdash;is gone. I have forgotten I saw it. Only M'sieu would better also
  &mdash;go."</p>

  <p>That night McKay packed. When dawn had broken he stood at his window,
  looked long at the little wood. It was awakening, stirring sleepily like
  drowsy delicate demoiselles. He drank in its beauty&mdash;for the last time;
  waved it farewell.</p>

  <p>McKay breakfasted well. He dropped into the driver's seat; set the engine
  humming. The old innkeeper and his wife, solicitous as ever for his welfare,
  bade him Godspeed. On both their faces was full friendliness&mdash;and in the
  old man's eyes somewhat of puzzled awe.</p>

  <p>His road lay through the thick forest. Soon inn and lake were far behind
  him.</p>

  <p>And singing went McKay, soft whisperings of leaves following him, glad
  chanting of needled pines; the voice of the forest tender, friendly,
  caressing&mdash;the forest pouring into him as farewell gift its peace, its
  happiness, its strength.</p><hr>

  </div>

  <h3>First published in <i>American Weekly</i>, September 23, 1923</h3><br>

  <p class="intro">This is Professor James Marston's story. A score of learned
  bodies have courteously heard him tell it, and then among themselves have
  lamented that so brilliant a man should have such an obsession. Professor
  Marston told it to me in San Francisco, just before he started to find the
  island that holds his pool of the stone god and&mdash;the wings that guard
  it. He seemed to me very sane. It is true that the equipment of his
  expedition was unusual, and not the least curious part of it are the suits of
  fine chain mail and masks and gauntlets with which each man of the party is
  provided.</p><hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE five of us, said Professor Marston, sat side by side on
  the beach. There was Wilkinson the first officer, Bates and Cassidy the two
  seamen, Waters the pearler and myself. We had all been on our way to New
  Guinea, I to study the fossils for the Smithsonian. The <i>Moranus</i> had
  struck the hidden reef the night before and had sunk swiftly. We were then,
  roughly, about five hundred miles northeast of the Guinea coast. The five of
  us had managed to drop a lifeboat and get away. The boat was well stocked
  with water and provisions. Whether the rest of the crew had escaped we did
  not know. We had sighted the island at dawn and had made for her. The
  lifeboat was drawn safely up on the sands.</p>

  <p>"We'd better explore a bit, anyway," said Waters. "This may be a perfect
  place for us to wait rescue. At least until the typhoon season is over. We've
  our pistols. Let's start by following this brook to its source, look over the
  place and then decide what we'll do."</p>

  <p>The trees began to thin out. We saw ahead an open space. We reached it and
  stopped in sheer amazement. The clearing was perfectly square and about five
  hundred feet wide. The trees stopped abruptly at its edges as though held
  back by something unseen.</p>

  <p>But it was not this singular impression that held us. At the far end of
  the square were a dozen stone huts clustered about one slightly larger. They
  reminded me powerfully of those prehistoric structures you see in parts of
  England and France. I approach now the most singular thing about this whole
  singular and sinister place. In the center of the space was a pool walled
  about with huge blocks of cut stone. At the side of the pool rose a great
  stone figure, carved in the semblance of a man with outstretched hands. It
  was at least twenty feet high and was extremely well executed. At the
  distance the statue seemed nude and yet it had a peculiar effect of drapery
  about it. As we drew nearer we saw that it was covered from ankles to neck
  with the most extraordinary carved wings. They looked exactly like bat wings
  when they were folded.</p>

  <p>There was something extremely disquieting about this figure. The face was
  inexpressibly ugly and malignant. The eyes, Mongol-shaped, slanted evil. It
  was not from the face, though, that this feeling seemed to emanate. It was
  from the body covered with wings&mdash;and especially from the wings. They
  were part of the idol and yet they gave one the idea that they were clinging
  to it.</p>

  <p>Cassidy, a big brute of a man, swaggered up to the idol and laid his hand
  on it. He drew it away quickly, his face white, his mouth twitching. I
  followed him and conquering my unscientific repugnance, examined the stone.
  It, like the huts and in fact the whole place, was clearly the work of that
  forgotten race whose monuments are scattered over the Southern Pacific. The
  carving of the wings was wonderful. They were batlike, as I have said, folded
  and each ended in a little ring of conventionalized feathers. They ranged in
  size from four to ten inches. I ran my fingers over one. Never have I felt
  the equal of the nausea that sent me to my knees before the idol. The wing
  had felt like smooth, cold stone, but I had the sensation of having touched
  back of the stone some monstrous obscene creature of a lower world. The
  sensation came of course, I reasoned, only from the temperature and texture
  of the stone&mdash;and yet this did not really satisfy me.</p>

  <p>Dusk was soon due. We decided to return to the beach and examine the
  clearing further on the morrow. I desired greatly to explore the stone
  huts.</p>

  <p>We started back through the forest. We walked some distance and then night
  fell. We lost the brook. After a half hour's wandering we heard it again. We
  started for it. The trees began to thin out and we thought we were
  approaching the beach. Then Waters clutched my arm. I stopped. Directly in
  front of us was the open space with the stone god leering under the moon and
  the green water shining at his feet!</p>

  <p>We had made a circle. Bates and Wilkinson were exhausted. Cassidy swore
  that devils or no devils he was going to camp that night beside the pool!</p>

  <p>The moon was very bright. And it was so very quiet. My scientific
  curiosity got the better of me and I thought I would examine the huts. I left
  Bates on guard and walked over to the largest. There was only one room and
  the moonlight shining through the chinks in the wall illuminated it clearly.
  At the back were two small basins set in the stone. I looked in one and saw a
  faint reddish gleam reflected from a number of globular objects. I drew a
  half dozen of them out. They were pearls, very wonderful pearls of a
  peculiarly rosy hue. I ran toward the door to call Bates&mdash;and
  stopped!</p>

  <p>My eyes had been drawn to the stone idol. Was it an effect of the
  moonlight or did it move? No, it was the wings! They stood out from the stone
  and waved&mdash;they waved, I say, from the ankles to the neck of that
  monstrous statue.</p>

  <p>Bates had seen them, too. He was standing with his pistol raised. Then
  there was a shot. And after that the air was filled with a rushing sound like
  that of a thousand fans. I saw the wings loose themselves from the stone god
  and sweep down in a cloud upon the four men. Another cloud raced up from the
  pool and joined them. I could not move. The wings circled swiftly around and
  about the four. All were now on their feet and I never saw such horror as was
  in their faces.</p>

  <p>Then the wings closed in. They clung to my companions as they had clung to
  the stone.</p>

  <p>I fell back into the hut. I lay there through the night insane with
  terror. Many times I heard the fan-like rushing about the enclosure, but
  nothing entered my hut. Dawn came, and silence, and I dragged myself to the
  door. There stood the stone god with the wings carved upon him as we had seen
  him ten hours before!</p>

  <p>I ran over to the four lying on the grass. I thought that perhaps I had
  had a nightmare. But they were dead. That was not the worst of it. Each man
  was shrunken to his bones! They looked like collapsed white balloons. There
  was not a drop of blood in them. They were nothing but bones wrapped around
  in thin skin!</p>

  <p>Mastering myself, I went close to the idol. There was something different
  about it. It seemed larger&mdash;as though, the thought went through my mind,
  as though it had eaten. Then I saw that it was covered with tiny drops of
  blood that had dropped from the ends of the wings that clothed it!</p>

  <p>I do not remember what happened afterward. I awoke on the pearling
  schooner <i>Luana</i> which had picked me up, crazed with thirst as they
  supposed in the boat of the <i>Moranus</i>.</p><hr>

 <h2>I. GATE OF THE WHITE ROAD</h2>

  <p class="first">DAVID CORFAX laid down the last torn sheet of the stained
  old parchment with a wonder that had grown steadily while he read. What he
  had read was incredible, but the true incredibility lay in that it had been
  written. Therein was the. heart of his wonder and the indefinable terror of
  it. For what the writing dealt with was&mdash;the White Road!</p>

  <p>All his life he had known the White Road. You saw it first as a slit, a
  hair-line of white light, just the width of your eyes and somewhere, it
  seemed behind them&mdash;somewhere between your brain and your eyes, in your
  own head. In childhood, it had been after you had gone to bed; sometimes as
  soon as your lids closed, sometimes when you were dropping off to sleep.
  Later it might come in broad daylight, while you sat thinking or reading. But
  at those times you never got far on the White Road.</p>

  <p>The laws of this world not those of yours.</p>

  <p>All his life he had known the White Road; in all his life he had spoken of
  it only to three persons. Two of these were dead; the third had been a child
  whom he had not seen for years and who should long ago have forgotten. Yet it
  had been she who had sent him the parchment. And out of it had come a voice
  silent four hundred years, and speaking of the White Road as one who had been
  a pilgrim upon it.</p>

  <p>How young he had been when first he saw the White Road, David Corfax could
  not tell. But it was as real to him as was this old house in which he sat,
  the sun of a September afternoon streaming through the window upon this
  yellowed manuscript which told him that the White Road was no dream&mdash;or
  if a dream then not his alone.</p>

  <p>And there had been that enigmatic postscript of Deborah&rsquo;s: &ldquo;I
  too have seen the White Road!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Was it real after all? Whether real or not, it had its mechanics,
  unchanging, unchangeable. First there was the humming, not heard but felt, a
  vibration along every nerve, in every cell. Then the slit, the hair-line of
  white light.</p>

  <p>Then the slit would open&mdash;half an inch, an inch. And then the White
  Road would begin to unroll. You could see straight ahead of you, but that was
  all. It was as though you stood a little distance back of the slit.</p>

  <p>In a sort of black box that moved smoothly along the road. And yet you
  seemed to be out on the road, too. Sometimes the sides would sweep past
  swiftly, as though you were galloping on some effortlessly moving horse;
  sometimes slowly as though you were walking. But once the road began to
  unroll you never stopped. And you never looked back, that is until you
  learned that looking back meant journey&rsquo;s end. When you stopped, the
  slit went out&mdash;like a light and you were back in your room. You looked
  back into your room. When you turned, the road was gone.</p>

  <p>Nor could you control the motion with which you went, nor could you, try
  as you would, by any effort of will cause the window that opened on the road
  to appear. It was there, without warning&mdash;or it was not. Nor could he
  ever remember clearly what he had seen when on the White Road. The road
  itself was always plain&mdash;wide and smoothly paved, sometimes straight
  sometimes curving, going on and on and on. There were people, but of what
  kind he never remem bered. There were forests, colorful and flowered... a
  towering range of mountains, strangely serrated, toothed, pinnacled...
  enormously high, purple and amethyst and looking as though they had been cut
  from cardboard... no distance to them and with garlands of little suns
  circling their peaks... there was a city of domes and minarets... beside a
  purple sea. And there were things that terrified... that had been in
  childhood when he had learned to look back to escape them. Later, he faced
  them... but could not remember, waking, what he had faced. Memory of music...
  like Sibelius.</p>

  <p>The road appeared without warning? No, there was always the humming that
  preceded it. It was a strange sound, not heard but felt. It seemed to vibrate
  through him, and as it did so his body became weightless. He could not feel
  the bed he lay in if he clenched his hands he could not feel the fingers...
  the humming seemed to deaden all nerves of touch. It grew louder, swifter
  rather rising in vibrancy rather than in pitch as the slit widened. He
  remembered, ah, there was one thing he remembered clearly enough. One night
  the humming had quickened and the slit had opened wider than ever
  before&mdash;or since. And over it, like a climber, a woman&rsquo;s hand,
  long-fingered, yellow as old ivory had clawed with talons like a condor had
  crept. And two unwinking, amber eyes had glared into his. He remembered how
  he had screamed, and his mother had come to him, and he could see today the
  fright, the numb horror, that had appeared upon her face when he had wept and
  sobbed about the White Road... he had been no more than six then. He
  remembered.</p>

  <p>When you looked back, and the road came again, you had to begin at the
  beginning. But if you could hold your nerve, and not look back, after a while
  you went to sleep. Then, if the dream came again the next night, as sometimes
  it did, you would go on from where you had stopped the night before. That was
  how he had gotten as far as sight of the strange city beside the purple sea.
  Three nights he had been on the road. Yes, there was some system, some law
  governing it.</p>

  <p>There was a dark: road too. That was an evil road. Even in childhood he
  knew that it came close to the White Road and was to be avoided. But later,
  he felt a pull as he put it, to this road. And often yielded. He could see
  nothing on this, could only hear voices. And he must go so gently, so
  quietly. There was a hill, and behind it the murmur of voices, the creaking
  of stays, the sounds of a port. He knew it was a hill, because it loomed
  blackly against a faintly red sky, as though there were fires burning. He
  knew that he must never look over that hill, never go over it or he would be
  utterly lost. Could never return.</p>

  <p>Then his mother had died. He had gone through boarding school, through
  college, become a wanderer. Two years on the desert....</p><br>

 <h2>I. ALTAR OF KUKULKAN</h2>

  <p class="first">THE SILENCE seemed to be focused within the temple; to have
  its heart there; a heart that did not need to beat, since all the silence was
  alive. Outside the heat of the Yucatan midday held the ruins in breathless
  grip. Barry Manson, crouching at the base of the ancient altar, thought: the
  silence... marched... marched into the temple. The shrieks of the parrots
  were cut off first. .. then the little blue and yellow birds stopped
  quarreling in the crimson fruited tree at the base of the shattered
  stairway... and then the silence marched up the stairway and into this
  chamber and crowded against the seaward side... and that shut out the swish
  of the waves.</p>

  <p>He looked at Joan. She sat a few paces away, her back against the massive
  pedestal of a broken pillar. Her hands were clasped around her knees. Her
  eyes were intent upon the wall behind the altar. A painting once had covered
  that wall. The fingers of time, working patiently through the centuries, had
  plucked away most of the stucco that had carried it. But above the altar, as
  though protected by its shadow, a large and irregular fragment remained. Upon
  it, colors still vivid, Were the head and shoulders of Kukulkan, God of the
  Air of the ancient Mayans&mdash;and much more than that.</p>

  <p>The Feathered Serpent, his symbol and his avatar, floated over him, fanged
  jaws agape, plumed wings spread wide. The face of Kukulkan was the
  conventionalized one of the New Empire; the nose grotesquely lengthened like
  that of a tapir, lips thick and protruding, prognathous-jawed, bat-eared; the
  ears ringed and the labret through the nostrils; head plumed with the sacred
  panacho.</p>

  <p>The painted gaze of the god seemed fixed as intently upon the girl as hers
  upon him.</p>

  <p>The pedestal against which Joan leaned was covered with carved figures of
  priests of Kukulkan who had served him when ruined Tuloom had been one of the
  great cities of the Mayans, and this its holiest temple. On these figures the
  colors were also bright. Into them Joan&rsquo;s copper hair melted, merged
  with their reds and ochres so that for an instant Barry had the illusion that
  her face was all of her.</p>

  <p>A disembodied face peering out of the stone and holding communion with the
  god like a summoned priestess.</p>

  <p>Impatiently Barry arose and walked over to her. She dis not look up. She
  whispered, eyes still absorbed by the painted god:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break the silence, Barry! It&rsquo;s like the silence
  that wraps the city of Jade... where the thousand sages of T&rsquo;zan
  T&rsquo;zao sit holding fast to the thought that created the world... and
  that the ghost of a ghost of a sound would destroy... and with it the
  world....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt increase of revolt against the fantasies gathering about him. He
  shook his shoulders and laughed. He said, loudly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The silence is broken, Joan&mdash;and the world still
  spins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was true. The silence was broken. It was retreat ing from the chamber,
  slowly... marching away as it had marched in. Faintly came the swish of the
  waves, growing ever stronger. The silence was marching out of the chamber
  toward the shattered stairway up which it had come. Joan arose, slowly... it
  was odd, Barry thought, how every movement of hers in rising kept to the
  rhythm, kept to the beat, of the unseen and unheard feet of the retreating
  silence.</p>

  <p>The silence marched down the stairway. He heard again the quarreling of
  the little blue and yellow birds... then the shrieks of the parrots....</p>

  <p>Joan said, unsteadily: &ldquo;It was time you did that, Barry. It was...
  doing things to me. Look, Barry&mdash;look...!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He followed her finger, pointing to the painted face of Kukulkan. For a
  breath he saw it... another face looking out from the wall.</p>

  <p>An ageless face... the nose long and curved and delicate. The lips full
  but sharply cut, archaically sensuous... hair as red as his own and eyes as
  blue as. Joan&rsquo;s. A face as devoid of human equivalence as it was
  timeless... yet human... as though the seed from which it had sprung into
  godhood had been human. Incalculable, unreadable... but still within it
  something that could be read up to that point where the humanness of it
  merged into the god... might be read more plainly if the god would within it
  merge more fully into the humanness. Nothing of benevolence in it... but
  neither was there shade of malevolence, cruelty... humanless, in human
  mask.</p>

  <p>Barry thought: it is like that mountain peak in the City of Jade of which
  Joan spoke... the peak shaped like the head of a man and all of clearest
  crystal to which the thoughts of men are drawn... all their thoughts... and
  pass from its eyes and mouth cleansed of falsehood and of error, prejudice
  and hatred and love... standing naked and stark before T&rsquo;zan T&rsquo;wo
  to be judged....</p>

  <p>Power was in the face, immense power... and something of wildness, of
  freedom... the freedom of primaeval things... like the wind, the waves, the
  sun....</p>

  <p>And then the face was gone. Upon the wall was the tapir snout of Kukulkan,
  the protruding lips, the fanged and feathered serpent.</p>

  <p>His hand was clenching Joan&rsquo;s wrist. She whispered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw it! You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dropped her wrist. He said: &ldquo;It is another painting beneath this
  one. An older painting. Some trick of the light brought it out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said, doubtful: &ldquo;Maybe. But I think it was Kukulkan as the first
  Mayans knew him. Kukulkan who came to them from still an older race. Kukulkan
  when he was worshipped with flowers and fruits and incense and prayer. Before
  his worship was debased and the cruel human sacrifices began. That was when
  and why he turned from the Mayans. And so their doom came swiftly upon them.
  For it was never he who came to them thereafter, Barry. It was an evil god
  hiding behind his mask and name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hesitated, seemed listening: &ldquo;But yes&mdash;he did come. Came
  even to the Aztecs, who steeped his rites in even greater cruelties and
  renamed him Quetzalcoatl... came again and again to thwart that other god
  when his evil grew too strong... the Lord of Darkness, the Lord of the
  Dead.... "</p>

  <p>Her voice died; she stood with eyes rapt, face colorless, bent as though
  listening. He took her by the shoulders, shook her:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Snap out of it, Joan. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
  You&rsquo;re talking nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I, Barry? It was what Kukulkan was telling me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She dropped her head on his shoulder; clung to him, trembling. His hands
  slipped from her shoulders, drew her to him. He said huskily:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coming any closer to loving me, Joan?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his frankly, yet with something of regret lurking
  in them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, Barry dear. But it&rsquo;s still the same.
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He interrupted her, speaking monotonously: &ldquo;Like you better than any
  other man I know, except Bill, of course, and I wish I could love you the way
  you want, but&mdash;yes, Joan, I know all that by heart now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She flushed and said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. After all,
  Bill&rsquo;s my brother and why shouldn&rsquo;t I love him? And I do like you
  better than anyone else. So much so that at times&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped;
  he repeated eagerly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That at times?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Barry, why do you want me? There are plenty of nice
  girls who like just the things you do. I know a dozen who would love
  you&mdash;and any one of them would make you a perfect wife. I don&rsquo;t
  like the &rsquo;things you do. Or if I do, to me they&rsquo;re only brief
  amusements. Why, I&rsquo;d rather help Bill dig up a cup from some ruin that
  spans the gap of knowledge between its maker and us than win a thousand
  sporting trophies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said: &ldquo;If you loved me that wouldn&rsquo;t make any
  difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been brought up differently,
  Barry&mdash;and we&rsquo;re both too set in our ways to change. I am
  anyway....&rdquo; Suddenly she laughed:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t fooled me by this trip, Barry Manson. I know
  damned well that it wasn&rsquo;t any abrupt interest in the Mayans that
  prompted it. I&rsquo;m mighty grateful to you for giving Bill the chance
  he&rsquo;s always wanted. But I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you out of gratitude,
  and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want me to&mdash;would you,
  Barry?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His gray eyes narrowed: he said, brutally: &ldquo;Listen, redhead. You
  don&rsquo;t fool me any either. It&rsquo;s damned little of highbrow or
  blue-stocking you&rsquo;d be if you fell in love with a man. Nature
  didn&rsquo;t build you that way. And it would be damned little you&rsquo;d be
  thinking of fossils if that happened. You&rsquo;d be too busy having
  babies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She said, coldly: &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s rather&mdash;beastly!&rdquo;
  He said, hotly: &ldquo;Is that so? What&rsquo;s beastly about babies?
  You&rsquo;d be getting a slant on the present day with some outlook on the
  future&mdash;instead of burying your red head in the past. What I&rsquo;m
  afraid of is that you&rsquo;ll marry some dusty-dry, mummy-minded, scientific
  grave robber and spend the rest of your life nursing fossils instead of what
  you are obviously designed for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She interrupted, furiously, eyes snapping blue sparks:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let nobody pick my husband! Least of
  all&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; Barry&rsquo;s too-quick anger flared.
  &ldquo;It seems to me you were ready enough to pick wives for me just now.
  Not one but a dozen&mdash;&rdquo; He gripped her arms and swung her to him.
  &ldquo;You&mdash;the highbrow scientist? Like hell you are! Look at that mop
  of red hair. Those eyes of yours with the devil&rsquo;s twist to the ends of
  them, that mouth of yours&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve seen you in your rag of a
  bathing suit! I tell you again, by God, that once you&rsquo;re awake
  it&rsquo;s not fossils you&rsquo;ll be thinking of! And maybe this will help
  wake you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held her close, kissed eyes and throat, pressed his lips to hers. She
  lay in his arms, passive, unresisting. She said at last, indifferently:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cave-man stuff, Barry. Too crude. It doesn&rsquo;t interest me at
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He released her, stepping back as though out of a dash of cold water. She
  raised her arms and began to coil her disordered hair. She laughed at him, a
  little too sweetly&mdash;though he did not know it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Barry dear, we&rsquo;re as far apart as the poles. You
  make love to me by enumerating my&mdash;ah, charms, is the cliche for it, I
  think. You are an&mdash;ah, anatomical lover. It is a viewpoint, certainly. A
  Sultan&rsquo;s viewpoint, but I do not care for Sultans. Nor,&rdquo; went on
  Joan, still far too sweetly and reasonably, &ldquo;do I think that my
  worthinesses are wholly anatomical. But then&mdash;you&rsquo;ve always been
  rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p><br>
