<p>There are many pleasanter spots than the deck of a sailing ship,
as on some winter's morning she hangs to the buoy at Gravesend
ready for a start; and Merchant Jack, both fore and aft, as he eyes
the cold, grey sky and low-lying dingy shores on either hand,
curses the climate, the service, and his bad luck in not having
shipped on board a steamer in place of on a wind-jammer. That is in
these days. In the old ones, he took matters as they came, rather,
indeed, affected to look down upon all &quot;smoke jacks,&quot; and
prided himself upon belonging to a &quot;flier.&quot; Steam,
however, has changed all that. There are no &quot;fliers&quot; to
speak of now, and British Merchant Jack has become so scarce that
the powers that be, alarmed lest he should disappear altogether,
have caught a lot of him young, and sent him in mobs to learn his
trade in certain merchant ships, and qualify himself in some of the
good old-fashioned seamanship before inevitable steam claims him
for its own.</p>
<p>But to return to our outward-bounder, lying at the buoy this
grey and dismal February morning, and attempt to describe to you
scenes that will, ere many years are over, be only found in books.
Presently, the river pilot comes on board, a tug catches hold of
the big liner, and she moves slowly away down the Thames; her crew
sulky, sore-headed, and shivering; her officers trying to discover
what sort of a &quot;crowd&quot; they had dropped across; and all
hands more or less bad tempered and uncomfortable. Of course, there
are vessels that leave on fine, warm, sunny summer's mornings as
well as in the bleak ones of winter. But, fine weather or foul,
outward-bound Jack's temper, as a rule, is atrocious, and is not
improved by the sight of the homeward-bounders towing up to the
docks he has just left behind him. And, anyhow, in fine weather
there is no fun in the English Channel. It's only on a morning like
this, not thick enough to necessitate bringing up in the Downs, but
quite enough so to render objects more or less indistinct, that
there is a chance of anything exciting happening. What there is of
the wind is fair; and abreast of Dover the tug casts off her line;
the Channel pilot comes on board; the Palmetto, full-rigged ship of
1800 tons, 100 A1 at Lloyd's, carrying a few saloon and
second-class passengers, sets her topsails and courses, and
gingerly feels her way along the mid-channel course. By the time
she is opposite Beachy Head the smother has thickened, and the
narrow sea is like Fleet-street in a fog with the traffic going
anyhow, and no police about. Ghostly shapes glide past the
Palmetto, coming and going, that only by the dull thump of their
screws are known to be steamers. The ringing of bells from
bewildered &quot;sailers,&quot; and the hooting of sirens from
tramps and liners is incessant. The skipper is anxious, and wants
to anchor. &quot;Bring up, be d&mdash;d,&quot; replies the pilot,
who is cross because of losing his chance for another ship,
&quot;can't anchor in the fairway! Besides, we're just as safe
moving.&quot; The passengers collect in groups, the
&quot;seconds&quot; around their house, the &quot;firsts&quot; on
the poop, and stare and shiver, in dim apprehension, and begin to
wish that, after all, they'd taken steam for it. More or less, they
are all doing the trip under &quot;doctor's orders;&quot; and, more
or less, all begin to wish they had their medical adviser on board,
so that they might argue the point with him. For'ard, Jack skulks
as much as possible. British Jack skulks openly, remarking the
while that of all the blank-blanked-adjective-hookers he was ever
in this blanky old dug-out beats 'em all. Foreign Jack skulks
furtively in corners, and dodges the officers around in the fog.
British and foreign heads alike are all sore as yet, and the
executive know this, and wisely trouble them as little as
possible.</p>
<p>In a pen lashed amidships there are a few sheep, which bleat
mournfully; pigs in a stye for'ard grunt and squabble; in the coops
aft there is a noise of crowing and clucking that makes one think
of a farmyard adrift.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your eye skinned there on the foc'sle head!&quot;
roars the pilot, as a big homeward-bound sailer, in tow, suddenly
shows up at the flying jibboom-end of the Palmetto, just grazing
it, and slides by with her yards braced sharp up; very deep in the
water, and with a cluster of figures on her poop, barely
distinguishable through the gloom.</p>
<p>&quot;Starboard your hellum, you blank blank idiots!&quot;
shouts the Palmetto's pilot, shaking his fist at the stranger.
&quot;D'ye want to come any closer? Got letters for Sydney, or
what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your hair on, you tarnation limejuice fool!&quot;
comes back from the other. &quot;We're carryin' our own mails this
trip. Can't trust 'em to British barges. So long!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Yankee!&quot; mutters the pilot, spitting over the rail,
as the American ship disappears. &quot;Get no change out o' them
fellers. Soon cut ye down as look at ye; an' then swear black's
white you was in fault.&quot;</p>
<p>In the afternoon the fog lifts, disclosing the sea-thoroughfare
thronged with a mass of every craft and every rig under the sun,
from a Brixham trawler to a battleship, from a Dutch galliot to a
Swedish brig with a windmill on her quarterdeck, and all either
coming from or making for the Heart of the World lying away up
there at the end of the Silver Streak, at once the Mart of Nations
and Mistress of the Seven Seas.</p>
<p>At Plymouth the pilot goes off in a better temper, with six
inches of whisky and a good dinner under his double-breasted
waistcoat; also some specially choice Cavendish in the pockets of
his coat&mdash;a purple-faced, choleric, obese old fellow, but,
like all the other servants of the Honorable Corporation of the
Trinity House, no end a good man.</p>
<p>Sail was now got on the Palmetto, and the wind freshening she
swarmed down channel to such purpose that in the middle watch that
night her people caught a glimpse of the light that the lonely Wolf
sends forth into the wild Atlantic; and knew that they looked their
last on English land.</p>
