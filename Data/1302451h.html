<p>To those who have been there, the name alone of the island
suddenly suggests many things. Among others, memories run to giant
pine trees; of a period of enforced but total abstinence; of ruins;
of a curious and gentle people; of red dust, and much of it; of an
incalculable quantity of water, as compared with a mere fragment of
land; of, in fact, many things. The average visitor, in place of
indulging in thoughts of the historical Bounty and the mutineers,
and closely examining into the authentic details of the story of
Pitcairn as told by these islanders, who are not yet too proud to
admit acquaintance with anything of the kind, is, it is to be
feared, more and deeply occupied in attempting to solve the
&quot;drink problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Somehow, the vessels that make the island seem to have a habit
of approaching it during the night. In which case, dropping anchor,
they proceed to get their mails ready, and their hatches off,
prepared to discharge any cargo they may be carrying for the
residents. Repeated blasts from the steam whistle notify the
islanders of the arrival of the vessel. These having no effect,
rockets, or detonators, are sent up, which arouse the echoes from
the hills, and send them resounding throughout the island. But its
people are not going to turn out for a few letters and newspapers
and a bit of cargo. Therefore, the steamer's people, realising
this, presently turn in. One would imagine that long experience
would be effective in teaching them what to expect. Nevertheless,
the performance is religiously gone through with at each visit,
During the morning, some time after breakfast the whale boats
arrive, filled with placid natives, who, in reply to strong and
vivid protests, and arguments in favour of hurry, merely smile
depreciatingly, and promise amendment for the future.</p>
<p>But both sides know as well as possible that there will be no
change. It is the Island of No Hurry, and motto of its people is
&quot;never do to day what you can put off till to-morrow; and not
even then if it can be helped.&quot; Landing is effected by jumping
on to a slippery step out of a dancing whale-boat, and a ducking is
generally one of the accompaniments of the process. When you leave
you, as often as not, jump into a whaleboat off a big stone at the
other side of the island. You get ducked in both cases. Viewed from
the Settlement Side, the scene in the foreground is somewhat
imposing, owing to the tall and picturesque ruins of the old gaol,
the convict and commissariat stores and quarters&mdash;grim,
decaying, but all quick with half a century's story of woe
unalterable, of solidified cruelty and misery, and human suffering.
Everywhere are gently-rounded hills, some bare, some topped from
base to summit with a trailing robe of lordly pines. Red roads,
well made, run to and fro across the island in every direction.
There was nothing for the convicts to do, except make roads or
build causeways of imposing massiveness where a culvert or a bridle
track would have served equally well. Gullies deep and long run
down towards the sea from the interior; and in these grow bananas,
and mangoes, and maize, and sweet potatoes. They are the paddocks
of the island; the shoulders of the hills support the stock. To the
right of the Settlement stands Government House, looking modern
from a distance but actually as old almost as the Settlement
itself. Fronting it is &quot;Quality Row,&quot; with its fine,
substantial stone cottages, each standing in its plot of ground,
once occupied by officials of the System, now the homes of the
islanders. Close to the shore is the graveyard where a lover of
strange and old-world inscriptions might feast for a week or
more.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1302451h-images/image02.jpg" width=

<p>Inland Mount Pitt towers to its 1000 or so feet; a graceful
ascent, however, and one easily made on horseback. From its summit
the whole island lies bare to the view, and not until then,
perhaps, is it fully realised what a minute speck lies east upon
the immensity of encompassing ocean. Everybody either rides or
drives. If unable to do either, they lead a horse. The Melanesian
Mission is the show place, as well as one of the beauty spots of
Norfolk Island. And it is well worthy of its reputation. Nowhere in
southern seas, or in many others, is there anything to equal it.
Set in a gentle slope running in park-like stretches towards the
steep cliffs that girdle the whole estate, the many and substantial
buildings, and the numerous inhabitants, give it an air of
intelligent and visible occupation and industry totally absent
elsewhere. The church alone is a worthy monument to the energy and
the liberality of its founders and beneficiaries. Stained glass
windows and marble pavements, artistic seats inlaid with
mother-of-pearl devices, skillfully worked by once savage
hands&mdash;every accessory, in short, that such an edifice can
require is to be found in the Mission Church. And when filled from
end to end with its hundreds of dark worshippers, representatives
of a score of far-off island groups, the scene is one of strange
impressiveness. The Mission has its own hospital, its own farm
(which boasts some pedigreed stock), its printing office, where the
Scriptures, translated into the universal &quot;mota,&quot; are set
up, and printed and bound, to be presently distributed throughout
the Western Pacific. The names of Selwyn and the martyred Patteson,
founders and chiefs of the Mission, are, as might be expected,
household words in the mouths of the clergy here&mdash;a modest,
but strenuous company, abounding in much self-denial and
mortification, both of the spirit and the flesh, with for the
solitary aim of all endeavour, the redemption of those that sit in
darkness. And if you have the good luck to see and talk with the
present Bishop, Cecil Wilson, of Melanesia, you will learn very
much of the hopes and aspirations of those engaged in the ceaseless
labour of not only Christianising, but of civilising, the dark
places, whose cheerful pioneers they are.</p>
<p>Scarcely less worthy of notice than the Mission itself, its
people, its pupils, and its interests, is the grand and solemn
avenue of great pines by which the approach to it is made. To whom
among the old-time residents must be given the credit of planting
these splendid trees is unknown; but here they are, entire with the
exception of a few gaps at intervals, which anywhere else would
have been long filled up; a unique and splendid memorial to the
good taste of some bygone arboriculturist.</p>
<p>From the &quot;Mission&quot; to the &quot;station&quot; is a
pleasant up-hill and down-hill drive along shady roads right across
the island. Wooden buildings enclosing three sides of a square, in
which is sunk an immense underground tank, denote the spot where
three submarine cables meet. One arrives from New Zealand, another
from Queensland; and yet another from Fiji. Night and day the
machines click out their messages along the &quot;All-Red&quot;
route. For the small sum of 3d per word you can talk for as long as
you wish to Australasia; but, otherwise, you will hear nothing of
the world's news as it passes through, from one continent to
another. Battle, murder, and sudden death may be abroad among the
natives, but no soul on Norfolk Island will be any the wiser of it;
so far as the Pacific Cable Board's officials are concerned. And
this matter by those among the islanders who care for what takes
place outside their own small microcosm is looked upon as somewhat
of a hardship. The staff here is large, as the station is an
important repeating one. The plant, too, is, as may be imagined,
most complete and effective in every detail. In such isolated
positions nothing can be left to chance, and all mishaps have to be
foreseen and provided against.</p>
<p>At places like Anson Bay, where we now are, and at Fanning
Island, if possible lonelier still, life for the young men who
serve the board must be reckoned as fairly monotonous. None the
less, at Norfolk island, there are compensations in the way of lawn
tennis, riding and driving, with perhaps a little flirting thrown
in over afternoon teas, and later dances. It is true that you can
neither ride nor drive very far in any one direction; but there are
so many roads, that you can always keep going for an indefinite
period, if you do not mind crossing your tracks time without
number. As for the tea and tennis, both are excellent.</p>
<p>That the Island is beautiful under its every aspect few will be
found to deny. Situated as it is on the borders of the tropics, the
climate is one of the most equable in the world; while its pine
trees vouch for its healthfulness. And yet few outsiders who,
seduced by the charm of the place, assay to make their home in it
seem to care to stay there after the novelty has worn off. Nor,
truth to tell, are such attempts at permanent residence viewed very
favourably by the islanders themselves. And perhaps this feeling is
reasonable enough. There is no room to spare for strangers, and
none too much for the present occupants&mdash;the rightful owners.
Their enemies say that they are indolent and unambitious. But then
it must be acknowledged, that they have no incentive to be
otherwise. With the Commonwealth placing a prohibitive tax on all
their produce, why, as they pertinently inquire of the
impertinently inquisitive stranger, should they exert themselves
more than suffices them to keep body and soul together? Far better
men than they are have for lack of an object in their lives made
far worse attempts at existence. As a community, the Islanders
should be rather sympathised with and assisted in every way to work
out their own salvation, in place of, as is too often the case,
being scolded and reprehended.</p>
<p>After a long course of such treatment, a community, as well as
an individual, is apt to become indifferent and careless, and the
more especially so when unable to resent it. The Norfolkers are
fast getting into the habit of thinking that the outside world is
against them; that they have no standing or consideration attached
to them; that they are, in fact, nobody's people, It is full time
that somebody took the island in hand, and tried what kindly
encouragement and assistance would bring about in place of neglect
and something very much resembling contempt.</p>
<p>Whatever else they may be, these descendants of the waifs of
British naval history possess in a very eminent degree the virtues
of politeness and hospitality; and the temporary sojourner within
their gates is made to at once feel at home among them by the
exercise of a tact and kindliness as unexpected as it is welcome.
One thing, too, at least, they are lucky in, and that is in having
for the first time in their history an able and energetic Chief
Magistrate, who is not of themselves. Captain Drake and his wife
have the best interests of the islanders at heart, and it is
sincerely to be hoped that much good will be the result of his
firm, yet kindly, rule.</p>
<p>The future of this handful of people, isolated and cast almost
absolutely upon their own resources, is difficult to forecast. As
matters are at present, it appears none too bright, unless
assistance of a very practical nature should come from some
unexpected source. In a sense, they may be looked upon as wards of
the British Government; but one great disability they labour under
is that of divided control. When once this is removed, and it is
finally settled where the sole responsibility lies, then the first
important step will have been taken towards a better and more
flourishing state of affairs.</p>
