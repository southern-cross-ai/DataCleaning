<h2><a id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="first">HAD Tillizinni written this story of the tomb of
Ts'in Hwang Ti (the King of Ts'in who became Emperor literally)
from the notes he had upon the case, it might have made a greater
and a better book.</p>

<p>You would have pardoned such extravagance of style as he
displayed in his extraordinary narrative, remembering that he is
of Italian birth and that English is too full of pitfalls to the
foreigner for his liking. For of truth, though Tillizinni speaks
and writes the three Arabics, Moorish (which I think is the
purest), Turkish, and Russian, with considerable fluency, and
though he knows at least seven dialects in the Chinese tongue,
and can converse in most of the modern languages, yet English,
with its bland and inviting simplicity, is a tongue which more
than any other baffles and overawes him.</p>

<p>They say of Nicolò Tillizinni, his predecessor in the chair of
Anthropology at Florence, and the benefactor and more than
father, whose name Tillizinni bears, that he spoke all languages
save Welsh; but I have reason for believing that he never
completely mastered the niceties of our tongue.</p>

<p>Particularly did Tillizinni wish to write clearly in this
story which I now tell (by his favour and at his request), for it
is a story like none other I have ever heard or read.</p>

<p>It concerns the tomb of the Great Emperor&mdash;the first
Emperor of the Chinese, who died two centuries before the birth
of Christ; it concerns that extraordinary genius and adventurer,
Captain Ted Talham&mdash;surely the most talkative man in the
world; it concerns, too, that remarkable woman, Yvonne Yale, and
last but not least, The Society of Joyful Intention&mdash;the
most bloodthirsty organisation the world has known. It concerns
Tillizinni also, for Scotland Yard placed him on his mettle, set
him a challenging task, which threatened at one time to bring
ruin to the greatest detective in Europe.</p>

<p>That it likewise brought him within an ace of losing his life,
I should not think it worth while mentioning at this stage, but
for the fact that scoffers might suppose that he held life dearer
than fame.</p>

<p>Tillizinni has never greatly interested himself in Chinese
affairs, and though he had been instrumental in bringing many men
to their doom, yet, curiously enough, none of these have been
inmates of the Celestial Kingdom; so that he welcomed with the
welcome which a blasé mind offers to anything in the shape of
novelty, the invitation of Scotland Yard to make himself
acquainted with the Society of Joyful Intention. The story proper
which is set forth here, begins with the surrounding of the China
Packet.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November, in the year of the great storm, there
went aground off the Goodwin Sands the China-Orient liner
<i>Wu-song</i>. She was a modern steamer of six thousand tons,
built by the Fanfield Company in 1900, and she traded between
London and the China Sea. On the night in question she was
homeward bound and was coming up the Channel at half speed, a
precaution taken by her skipper as a result of a slight and
patchy fog which lay on the Channel.</p>

<p>Off St. Margarets, for some unaccountable reason, she shifted
her course, and before anybody seemed to realise what was
happening, she was aground. No sea was running at the time, the
storm, it will be remembered, occurred a fortnight later, and
with the aid of two Dover tugs she was refloated.</p>

<p>That would seem rather a matter for the Trinity Masters than
for Scotland Yard, but for the fact that in the natural
excitement attendant upon the grounding, a very determined
attempt was made to force the Stubb safe in the captain's cabin.
Here again Scotland Yard might have dismissed the matter as a
mere commonplace attempt to secure the safe's contents by some
person or persons unknown, but for the fact that this was the
third attempt which had been made during the voyage.</p>

<p>Coming through the Suez Canal the captain had been on the
bridge&mdash;as is usual when a ship is making progress through
the great waterway. He had left his steward in charge of his
cabin, with instructions not to leave the apartment until he (the
captain) returned. Half way through the Canal, with the ship's
searchlights showing, and a clear stretch of water before him, he
had snatched a moment to go to his cabin to get a muffler, for
the night was cold.</p>

<p>The cabin was on the boat deck and inaccessible to passengers
except by invitation. To his surprise he had found the big room
in darkness and had put one foot over the weather board to enter
the cabin, when two men rushed past him, knocking him over in
their hurry. He called for a quarter-master, entered the cabin,
and discovered his steward lying gagged and bound on the
floor.</p>

<p>The man had been sitting reading when he had found himself
violently seized and gagged by two men, one of whom had switched
out the light the moment the assault was made.</p>

<p>The steward struggled, but he was powerless in the hands of
his assailants, and for a quarter of an hour he lay upon the
floor, his back to the intruders, whilst they attacked the
safe.</p>

<p>One cannot say, without reflecting upon an eminent firm of
safe-makers, whether the burglary would have succeeded but for
the captain's return, but certain it is that the strangers had
gone to work in a most scientific manner, and had made amazing
progress in the short space of time.</p>

<p>The second attempt was made when the ship was two days out of
Gibraltar, and was a half-hearted effort to blow open the door of
the safe whilst the captain was conducting Church Service in the
saloon. No guard had been left in the cabin, the captain thinking
that the thieves would be scared at making any further attack,
and, too, that they would hardly venture in broad daylight. Again
they were disturbed and decamped unseen, leaving two pencils of
nitro-glycerine to indicate their intentions.</p>

<p>Nor was the third, and final, and&mdash;one may
suppose&mdash;desperate attempt any more successful; but this
time the thieves were nearly caught. Captain Talham had seized
his revolver the moment the ship went aground, for his crew was
in the main Chinese, and he took no risks of a panic. When going
back to his cabin to secure a lifebelt, he met the two
indefatigable thieves, and there was a sharp exchange of
shots.</p>

<p>This time the thieves were armed also. Again they evaded him
and escaped in the fog.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard sent Tillizinni to interview the captain at the
London docks, and he found him an average type of British seaman,
kindly and communicative.</p>

<p>"The rum thing is," he explained, "that there was no money in
the safe&mdash;not so much as a brass farthing."</p>

<p>"What did the safe contain?" asked Tillizinni. He took up a
sheet of paper from his desk and read:</p>

<p>"Ship's papers in envelope&mdash;confidential report on the
working of the new condenser&mdash;and a green mailbag," he
said.</p>

<p>Tillizinni was interested.</p>

<p>"Green mailbag?"</p>

<p>The captain nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the Ambassador's bag and is brought from the Court of
Pekin to the ship by special messenger, and taken from me in
London by a man from the Embassy."</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "the Chinese Government always sends
its mails like that&mdash;its Embassy mails, I mean. I bring 'em
every trip. They don't trust the Embassy despatches over the
Trans-Siberian Railway. They think that the Russians go through
'em."</p>

<p>"I see," said Tillizinni.</p>

<p>It was very clear what the objective had been.</p>

<p>The green mailbag offered an irresistible temptation to
somebody who knew its contents.</p>

<p>"There was nothing else?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said.</p>

<p>There was little to do save to continue inquiries at the
Chinese Embassy. Here, however, Tillizinni met with a check. A
letter from the Embassy informed him that nothing of the
slightest importance was contained in the bag. The letter
continued:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"In this particular mail there were no official
documents whatever, the bag being made up of a number of his
Excellency's personal effects. These were in the nature of rare
Chinese documents which his Excellency had sent for from his home
in Che-foo, to assist him in the writing of an article which he
is preparing for the North American Review. As Signor Tillizinni
may know, his Excellency is an enthusiastic student of Chinese
history, and has the finest private collection of historical
documents relating to China in the world."</p><br>

<p>This letter came to Tillizinni at a moment when he had ample
time to devote to the elucidation of the problem.</p>

<p>Our Italian friend was and is a peculiar man. He credited
thieves of persistent characters, such as these men undoubtedly
possessed, with intelligence out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Whosoever made the attempt upon the safe of the China boat
were well aware of the "worthlessness" of the safe's contents,
and it was apparent that, worthless or not, the burglars had
decided that to have them was worth the risk.</p>

<p>The passenger list was a small one, but it took a week to sort
them out and establish their innocence. For the most part they
were Customs officials and British officers returning home on
leave; and the week-end found me with only two "doubtfuls."</p>

<p>The first of these was almost beyond suspicion. A Mr. de
Costa, a ship-owner of sorts, was one, and Captain Talham was
another.</p>

<p>Mr. de Costa, whom Tillizinni visited was, I should imagine,
descended from a Portuguese family. A short, stout man, rather
yellow of face, and bearing traces of his descent. He seemed the
last person in the world to be suspected of commonplace
felony.</p>

<p>Of Captain Talham, only fragmentary information was
obtainable, He had apparently held a commission in a regiment of
Irregular Horse during the South African war, and at the
conclusion of hostilities he had gone to China in search of the
adventure which at that time the great empire offered.</p>

<p>Beyond the fact that he had gone to China as far inland as
Lau-tcheu; that he had been arrested later at Saigon in Cochin
China, over some dispute with a French naval officer, and that he
had a few months in Kuala Kangsan in Perak, little could be
learnt about him. Later Tillizinni was destined to meet him, and
discover much at first hand, for just as there was none so
perfectly acquainted with his life, so there was none as willing
to talk so freely about Captain Talham&mdash;as Captain
Talham.</p>

<p>Here, then, with the conclusion of Tillizinni's unsatisfactory
inquiries, the incident of the China Packet might have closed and
have been relegated to the obscurity which is reserved for petty
felonies, but for the events which followed the publication of
the Ambassador's article.</p>

<p>From hereon I tell the story, suppressing nothing save that
which may appear too flattering to Tillizinni. Such of the events
which Tillizinni did not actually witness, I have written from
information afforded me by the principal actors in this strangest
of modern dramas.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Here let me say one word about the title which
heads this chapter. I have lumped together many acts of Signor
Tillizinni and have described them as "Just Crimes," and I think
that I have excellent reason for so describing them.</p>

<p>Tillizinni has always been a law unto himself. He worked on
the solid basis that society was a lamb which must at all costs
be protected from the wolves of the world, and to afford that
protection he invoked the law of that land in which he was
residing.</p>

<p>Sometimes the written law did not exactly cover a case, or
presented a loop-hole through which an evil-doer might crawl
unscratched. Tillizinni filled the hole&mdash;unlawfully. It was
always better for a criminal to take his chance with the law than
to take a chance with Tillizinni&mdash;that I know; that also
many villains discovered too late for the knowledge to be of
practical service.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; CAPTAIN TED TALHAM</h2>

<p class="first">A MAN walked carelessly through Hyde Park with
the air of one who had no destination. He was tall and straight,
his shoulders were thrown back, his chin had that upward lift
which seems part of the physiognomy of all who have followed a
soldier's career. His face, lean and well-featured, was tanned
with the tan of strong suns and keen cold winds, and though the
day was chilly and a boisterous breeze swept across the bare
spaces of the Park, he wore neither overcoat nor muffler. The
upturned moustache and the shaggy eyebrows suggested truculence;
the threadbare suit, for all its evidence of pressing and
ironing, suggested that he had found patches of life none too
productive.</p>

<p>A close examination might have revealed little darns at the
extremities of his trousers, for he had a trick of brushing his
heels together as he walked&mdash;a trick disastrous to garments
already enduring more than their normal share of wear.</p>

<p>He walked carelessly, swinging his gold-headed malacca
cane&mdash;incongruously magnificent&mdash;and whistling softly
and musically as he moved.</p>

<p>The Park was almost deserted, for it was dusk, and the weather
conditions were neither ideal nor inviting. Occasionally the
gusty wind bore down a flake or two of snow and the skies
overhead were sullen and grey.</p>

<p>He had reached the Ranger's House before he examined a cheap
metal watch, which was affixed to his person by no more
pretentious guard than a broad ribbon, bearing a suspicious
resemblance to a lady's shoe-lace.</p>

<p>The watch had stopped&mdash;he arrested his progress to wind
it, deliberately and with great earnestness. This done, he
continued his stroll, bearing down towards the Serpentine.</p>

<p>He stood for a few moments cheerfully contemplating the dreary
stretch of water, and three sad water-fowl, which came paddling
toward him in the hope of sustenance, paddled away again, sadder
than ever, for he offered no greater assistance to life than a
cheerful chirrup.</p>

<p>He turned as a sharp footstep came to him from the gravelled
path. A girl was walking quickly toward him from the Kensington
end of the Park. Something in her face attracted his
attention&mdash;if ever fear was written in a human countenance
it was written in hers. Then, into view round a clump of bushes,
came three men. They were small of stature, and it needed no
second glance to tell him their nationality, for despite their
European dress and their hard Derby hats, they wore their clothes
in the négligé style which the Oriental alone can assume.</p>

<p>The girl saw the tall man and came towards him.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry to trouble," she said breathlessly, "but these
men have been following me for two days&mdash;but never so
openly&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped and appeared to be on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>He bowed, a little slyly, and glanced at the three Chinamen,
who now stood a dozen paces away, as though uncertain as to what
was the next best move.</p>

<p>With a jerk of his head he beckoned them, and after a moment's
consultation they obeyed the gesture.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No savee," lisped one of the men. "No savee them pidjin."</p>

<p>He exchanged a few rapid sentences with his companions and a
smile flickered momentarily at the corner of the tall man's mouth
and vanished.</p>

<p>"What for you walkee this piecee lady all same time?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Again the sotto-voce conference and the leader of the three
shook his head.</p>

<p>"No makee walkee samee time," he said.</p>

<p>"Makee walkee John allee samee, piecee lady no b'long."</p>

<p>The tall man nodded. He took from his waistcoat pocket a light
blue porcelain disc and laid it on the palm of his hand and the
three Chinamen walked nearer and examined it. They were puzzled
by the demonstration.</p>

<p>"No savee," said the spokesman.</p>

<p>Captain Talham replaced the button in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Why do you follow this lady, you dogs?" he asked quickly, and
the men shrank back, for he spoke in the hissing Cantonese
dialect.</p>

<p>"Excellent lord," said the speaker humbly, "we are magnificent
students walking as is our custom in the evening, and we have not
the felicity of having seen this gracious and beautiful lady
before."</p>

<p>"You lie," said the tall man calmly; "for if that were so, why
did you say, 'Let us go away until this pig is out of sight, and
then we will follow the woman?'"</p>

<p>The man he addressed was silent.</p>

<p>"Now you shall tell me what you mean," said Captain Talham and
drew from his pocket the sky-blue button, fingering it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>This time the men saw and understood, and, as if at a signal,
they bowed low, recognising in the inquisitor a mandarin of the
Fourth or Military Class.</p>

<p>"Great mandarin," said one of the three who had not spoken.
"We are servants of others, and it is said that 'the wise servant
is dumb when the bamboo falls and dumb till he dies, when he is
dumb for ever.'"</p>

<p>The tall man nodded.</p>

<p>"You shall give me your hong that I may know you," he
said.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation, the man who was evidently the
leader, took a little ivory cylinder from his pocket, and
unscrewed it so that it came into two equal portions. The
cylinder was no larger than a thick pencil and less than two
inches long. One half was made up of an inking pad and at the end
of the other was a tiny circular stamp.</p>

<p>Captain Talham held out the palm of his hand and the other
impressed upon it the tiny Chinese character which stood for his
name. One by one his fellows followed suit, though they knew that
death might be the result of their disclosure.</p>

<p>The tall man examined the name carefully.</p>

<p>"'Noble Child,'" he read, "'Hope of the Spring,' and 'Star
above the Yamen.'"</p>

<p>He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"You may go," said he; and with two little jerky bows the men
turned and walked quickly in the direction from whence they had
come.</p>

<p>He had time now to observe the girl, a grave and bewildered
spectator of the scene. She was a little above medium height, and
slight. Her hair was bronze-red and her face singularly
beautiful. The skin was clear and white&mdash;so white as almost
to suggest fragility. Her eyes were big and grey, and the two
curved eyebrows, so sharp of line as to recall the pencilled
brows which the mid-Victorian poet popularised, were dark, and
contrasted with the glowing glory of the hair above. The nose was
inclined to be retroussé, and the lips were faultless in shape
and a warm red.</p>

<p>She presented the effect which the beautifiers of the world
strive to attain, yet fail, for here nature had, in some
mysterious fashion, blended all colourings in a harmony. She was
well dressed, expensively so. Her simple gown suggested the
studied simplicity which has made one Paris house famous the
world over; and there was luxury in the furs about her throat and
in the huge muff which was suspended with one hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you," she began; and indeed she was
in some embarrassment, for whilst he was obviously a gentleman,
he was as obviously a very poor gentleman.</p>

<p>He smiled and there was good comradeship and the ease which
begets friendship in the brief glimpse of even white teeth.</p>

<p>"In this world," he said, with no apparent effort at oratory,
"existence is made tolerable by opportunity, and no aspect of
opportunity is so coveted as that which afforded a gentleman to
secure the safety, the peace of mind, or the happiness of a
lady."</p>

<p>It was oratorical all right: there could be no doubt as to
that, but there was no effort, no shaming after effect, no labour
of delivery. He was neither self-conscious nor ponderously
pleasant, but the periods marched forth in an ordered stream of
words, punctuated in the process, so it seemed, by some invisible
grammarian.</p>

<p>She flashed a dazzling smile at him which was partly thanks
for her relief, partly amusement at his speech. The smile died as
suddenly because of her amusement and her fear that he would
realise why she smiled. (As to that she need not have worried,
for Ted Talham had no fear of appearing ridiculous.)</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would allow me to see you safely from this
place," he said courteously. "Civilisation has its
dangers&mdash;dangers as multitudinous and as primitive as the
wilds may hold for the innocent and the beautiful."</p>

<p>She flushed a little, but he was so obviously sincere, and so
free from pretension, that she could not be offended.</p>

<p>"They have been following me for days," she replied. "At first
I thought it was a coincidence, but now I see that there was no
reason for their dogging my movements."</p>

<p>He nodded, and they walked on in silence for a while,
then:</p>

<p>"Are you associated with China in any way? he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have never been to China," she said, "and know very little
about the country."</p>

<p>Again a silence.</p>

<p>"You have friends associated with China?" he persisted, and
saw a little frown of annoyance gather on her forehead.</p>

<p>"My mother&mdash;that is to say, my stepmother has," she said
shortly.</p>

<p>He curled his moustache thoughtfully. She noted with an odd
feeling in which pleasure and annoyance were mixed, that he was
very much "the old friend of the family." It was not exactly what
he said, or the tone he adopted. It was an indefinable something
which was neither patronage nor familiarity. It was Talham's way,
as she was to discover, to come with pleasant violence into lives
and be no more and no less in place than they who had won their
positions in esteem and confidence through arduous years of
service.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your mother's friends have given you something
Chinese which these men want?" he suggested, and again saw the
frown. Somehow he knew that it did not indicate hostility to, or
annoyance with, himself.</p>

<p>"I have a bangle," she said; "but I do not wear it."</p>

<p>She stopped, opened a silver bag she carried on her wrist, and
took out a small jade bracelet. It was set about at intervals by
tiny bands of gold.</p>

<p>"May I see it?"</p>

<p>She passed it to him. They were nearing Marble Arch, and she
had insensibly slackened her pace. Now they both stopped whilst
he examined the ornament. He scrutinised it carefully. Between
each band was an inscription, half obliterated by wear.</p>

<p>"This bangle is two thousand years old," he said simply, and
she gasped.</p>

<p>"Two thousand!" she repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>"Two thousand," he repeated. "This is quite valuable."</p>

<p>"I know," she said shortly.</p>

<p>He detected something of resentment in her tone.</p>

<p>"What do those characters mean?" she asked. "Is it something I
shouldn't know?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>She looked up at his face. There was a dull flush on his face
and a strange light in his eyes.</p>

<p>He fingered the jade bracelet absently.</p>

<p>"There is nothing you should not know," he said
briefly&mdash;for him. "There is much that I have wanted to know
for years."</p>

<p>She was puzzled, and showed it.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, and read, turning the bracelet slowly as he
read:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"I am Shun the son of the great mechanic
Chu-Shun upon whom the door fell when the Emperor passed. This my
father told me before the day, fearing the treachery of the
eunuchs. Behold the pelican on the left wall with the bronze
neck...afterwards the spirit steps of jade...afterwards river of
silver, afterwards...door of bronze. Here Emperor...behind a
great room filled with most precious treasures."</p><br>

<p>He read it twice, then handed the bracelet to the girl. She
looked at him for the space of a minute. Here, in the heart of
prosaic London, with the dull roar of the traffic coming to them
gustily across the sparse herbage of a most commonplace park,
Shun the son of Chu-Shun spoke across the gulf of twenty
centuries.</p>

<p>"It is very wonderful," she said, and looked at the
bracelet.</p>

<p>"I think you had better let me keep this bracelet," he said;
"at any rate for a while. I beg you to believe"&mdash;he raised
his hand solemnly&mdash;"that I consider only your own safety,
and I am moved to the suggestion by the knowledge that you attach
no sentimental value to the ornament, that it was given to you by
somebody whom your mother likes, but who is repugnant to you, and
that you only wear it in order to save yourself the discomfort
and exasperation of a daily argument with your parent."</p>

<p>She stared at him in open-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how did you know that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You carry it in your bag. You frowned when you took it out to
show me," he said cheerfully. "You carry it in your bag only
because you must keep it by you in order to slip it on and off
when you are out of somebody's sight. If it were your fiancé, you
would either wear it or leave it at home&mdash;engaged people
clear up their differences as they go along. Evidently you are a
lady of strong character, strong enough to respect the foibles or
the demands of your elders. Therefore it must be your father or
your mother; and since fathers are naturally indignant and
notoriously unsentimental, I cannot imagine that he would
insist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said hurriedly. "Will you keep the bracelet
for me, and return it at your leisure to this address?"</p>

<p>She extracted a card from her bag, and he looked at it and
read:</p><br>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Yvonne Yale.</span><br> 406, Upper
Curzon Street, S.W.</p><br>

<p>"Yvonne," he read gravely. "I've never known anybody named
Yvonne."</p>

<p>He put the bracelet in his inside pocket, and buttoned the
worn coat again.</p>

<p>"I have no card," he said. "I am Captain Ted Talham of the
Victorian Mounted Infantry, of the Bechuanaland Mounted Police,
of the Imperial Bushmen, and I am, in addition, a general in the
army of the Dowager Empress of China, a mandarin of the Fourth
Class, and a wearer of the Sun of Heaven and the Imperial Dragon
Orders."</p>

<p>He recited this with all gravity. There was no glint of humour
in his eyes. The girl checked her smile when she realised how
serious this good-looking man was. There was pride in the recital
of his dignities: it was a very important matter that he should
be Captain of Irregular Horse, and as tremendous a happening that
he should wear the decorations of the Manchu dynasty.</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I am sure my mother will be glad to meet you," she said, "and
as for myself I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you should
have been so providentially at hand this afternoon."</p>

<p>He bowed, a ceremonious and correct little bow.</p>

<p>"That is the luck of the game," he said.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. He was so evidently trying to say
something more.</p>

<p>"I think it is right, and it is my duty," he said at last, "to
point out to you the very significant fact that so far I have not
offered you my address. This," he went on oracularly, "is all the
more significant and alarming when I tell you that the intrinsic
value of the bangle"&mdash;he tapped his pocket&mdash;"is
anything from fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the startled girl.</p>

<p>It was altogether an amazing afternoon.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Possibly the latter figure," he said. "Let the fact sink into
your mind, and add to it the alarming intelligence that I have no
address, and I have no address because I have exactly three yen
in unchangeable Chinese silver between myself and the ravening
world."</p>

<p>A wave of pity surged over the girl, and there were tears in
her eyes&mdash;tears that sprang most unexpectedly from
unsuspected wells of sympathy.</p>

<p>She fumbled in her bag, but he stopped her.</p>

<p>"I beg of you," he said reproachfully. "If you can't trust me
with two thousand pounds' worth of jade, believe me, I can trust
you with my secret, and a secret is only existent just so on as
either of the two parties affected do nothing overtly or covertly
to destroy the basic foundation upon which it rests. My secret is
momentary penury remove that and the secret ceases to be."</p>

<p>He would have said more, but checked himself.</p>

<p>"In fact," he concluded, "if you offer me money, I shall offer
you your jade bangle, and there will be the end of the
matter."</p>

<p>She was laughing now&mdash;her eyes danced with merriment.</p>

<p>There was something amusing in the situation. This seedy
gentleman with his unchangeable yen, his problematical dinner and
bed, with two thousand pounds in his inside pocket, appealed to
her sense of the grotesque. If young De Costa knew! Young
change-counting, bill-checking, tipless De Costa, who had given
her two thousand pounds in the innocence of his heart.</p>

<p>"Promise me that you will call?" she asked laughingly, "with
or without the bangle."</p>

<p>"With the bangle," he said. "To-night I shall make it very
clear to the 'Noble Child,' 'Hope of the Spring,' and 'Star of
the Yamen' that the bracelet has passed to my possession and that
henceforward if they wish to follow its wearer they must follow
me."</p>

<p>He shook hands again, lifted his hat, and turning abruptly,
left her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE MAN IN THE DRAWER</h2>

<p class="first">HIS EXCELLENCY Prince Chu-Hsi-Han, Ambassador to
the Court of St. James, picked up the card from the tray, and
examined it calmly through his rimless glasses.</p>

<p>"Is the distinguished stranger below?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Excellent Highness," said the Mongolian in the livery of the
Embassy, "I placed the distinguished stranger in the red
room."</p>

<p>The Ambassador nodded.</p>

<p>"Conduct him to my unworthy presence," he said, and the
servant bowed twice and left the room silently.</p>

<p>He returned in a few minutes and announced the visitor in
faultless English.</p>

<p>"Signor Tillizinni."</p>

<p>Tillizinni, spare of build, with his keen, eager face and his
black and white colouring, formed a strong note in that room of
soft pearl-blue draperies and shaded lights. He offered his hand
with a little bow to the impassive Oriental who rose from his
desk to meet him.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency expected me?" he asked, and the Ambassador
smiled, for Tillizinni spoke in the Chinese&mdash;that peculiar
"Mandarin Chinese"&mdash;which only the statesmen and
diplomatists of China employ.</p>

<p>"You are a veritable signor," he said quietly. "You have the
accent which suggests a course of training in the forbidden
city."</p>

<p>Tillizinni flushed&mdash;he was susceptible on the
intellectual side.</p>

<p>"I am flattered," he said. "Yet I studied no nearer to Pekin
than Florence."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," said the Prince, and with his own hands
drew a chair forward.</p>

<p>"Be seated," he said, "and tell me exactly what you
require."</p>

<p>He was speaking in English now.</p>

<p>Tillizinni took from his pocket a long envelope and extracted
a number of newspaper cuttings.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency wrote an article in the North American
Review," he said, "which dealt extensively with the early history
of your country."</p>

<p>The Ambassador nodded.</p>

<p>"You dealt extensively with the life of the First
Emperor."</p>

<p>Again the Ambassador nodded.</p>

<p>"One could not deal effectively with the history of China," he
smiled, "unless one wrote of the First Emperor. He built the
great wall and stimulated all the best efforts of my
countrymen&mdash;and though it was two thousand years ago, his
influence is still felt."</p>

<p>It was Tillizinni who smiled now.</p>

<p>"His influence is felt here in London," he said grimly, "and
in no place more completely than in Scotland Yard, which, as your
Excellency may know, affords me employment."</p>

<p>"At Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>The Chinese Ambassador's eyebrows rose.</p>

<p>"At Scotland Yard," repeated the other. "But if your
Excellency will proceed&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Prince was a great littérateur, and since he was riding
his hobby, needed little encouragement.</p>

<p>"The First Emperor did many wonderful things," he said. "He
also did many things, which I say humbly and with due reverence
to his illustrious memory"&mdash; he bowed his head&mdash;"were
not wise, for he destroyed all the literature which China
possessed, burnt books and documents, and forbade on pain of
death any attempt on the part of students to retain the writings
of the just. All this you will find dealt with in the story in a
sketchy way."</p>

<p>Again Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"Here is a paragraph I would like to direct your special
attention," he said, and indicated a page on which a paragraph
had been outlined with blue pencil.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" said his Excellency. He was apologising for the
fact that it was necessary for him to employ his pince-nez; for
your well-bred Chinaman be he all but blind, does not wear his
spectacles in the presence of his guest.</p>

<p>"Ah, that," he tapped the blue paragraph with his finger,
"that is a literal extract from the writings of our greatest
historian, and describes the burial of the First Emperor."</p>

<p>He read aloud in his soft English, tracing the printed lines
with his tapered fingers as he proceeded:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"In the 9th moon the First Emperor was buried in
Mount Li, which in the early days of his reign he had caused to
be tunnelled and prepared with that view. Then, when he had
consolidated the Empire, he employed his soldiery, to the number
of 700,000, to bore down to the Three Springs (that is, until the
water was reached), and there a firm foundation was laid and the
sarcophagus placed thereon. Rare objects and costly jewels were
collected from the palaces and from the various officials, and
were carried thither and stored in huge quantities. Artificers
were ordered to construct mechanical crossbows, which, if any one
were to enter, would immediately discharge their arrows. With the
aid of quicksilver, rivers were made&mdash;the Yangtze, the
Yellow River, and the great ocean&mdash;the metal being made to
flow from one into the other by machinery. On the roof were
delineated the constellations of the sky, on the floor the
geographical divisions of the earth. Candles were made from the
fat of the man-fish (walrus), calculated to last for a very long
time. The Second Emperor said: 'It is not fitting that the
concubines of my late father who are without children should
leave him now;' and accordingly he ordered them to accompany the
dead monarch to the next world, those who thus perished being
many in number. When the interment was completed, some one
suggested that the workmen who had made the machinery and
concealed the treasure knew the great value of the latter, and
that the secret would leak out. Therefore, so soon as the
ceremony was over, and the path giving access to the sarcophagus
had been blocked up at its innermost end, the outside gate at the
entrance to this path was let fall, and the mausoleum was
effectually closed, so that not one of the workmen escaped. Trees
and grass were then planted around, that the spot might look like
the rest of the mountain."</p><br>

<p>Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"That is the trouble," he said.</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>It is not etiquette for a high-born Chinaman to express his
astonishment in the exclamatory style of the West; yet the Prince
was obviously astonished.</p>

<p>As briefly as possible Tillizinni gave a résumé of the events
which had preceded and followed the stranding of the China
mail-boat.</p>

<p>His Excellency listened, his features composed to that
immobility which is characteristic of his race. When Tillizinni
had concluded, he asked:</p>

<p>"You suggest that the thieves were seeking information which
they knew I would publish, and which is to be found in every
historical text-book on China."</p>

<p>"I suggest to your Excellency," said Tillizinni quietly, "that
amongst your documents there was one which threw greater light
upon the Treasure House of the Dead than anything you have
published."</p>

<p>The Ambassador was silent. His delicate fingers played
restlessly with a silver paper knife on his desk, and his eyes
were averted from the other's face.</p>

<p>Tillizinni offered no encouragement to speech. He understood
that he had been right in his surmise. There was reason for the
attempted burglary and the reason was to be found in the contents
of the mail-bag.</p>

<p>It was fully three minutes&mdash;no inconsiderable period of
time&mdash;before the Ambassador spoke: "I can only imagine," he
said at last, speaking very slowly, "that the people who tried to
rob the safe desired information which I am not prepared to
give."</p>

<p>He looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Do you realise, Mr. Tillizinni," he asked, "that buried with
Ts'in Hwang Ti are jewels computed to be worth over two million
pounds?"</p>

<p>"Two millions?"</p>

<p>The Prince nodded.</p>

<p>"Two millions," he repeated. "All the authorities agree that
even in those days, China was enormously wealthy in gold and
precious jewels, and that the value of the First Emperor's
possessions were enormous. He was originally the King of Ts'in,
and he it was who established the Empire. By conquest alone he
must have secured enormous wealth apart from that which he
obtained through the recognised revenues of peace."</p>

<p>The knowledge that this wealth lies buried is sufficient to
tempt the foreign adventurer&mdash;no Chinaman save some of the
worst criminal characters would desecrate a tomb.</p>

<p>"I have in my possession the exact location of Mount Li," he
added simply.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think that is easy to find, but as a matter of fact the
Empire is filled with Mount Lis, and though on one of
these&mdash;the most obvious one&mdash;the tomb has been located,
the great Emperor is really buried on a small and barren island
in the Gulf of Pe-chili."</p>

<p>Tillizinni's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>What mystery there was in the burglary had now vanished.</p>

<p>"Why is not the location generally known?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Ambassador favoured him with one of his rare smiles.</p>

<p>"The Emperor himself forbade the disclosure," he said. "In
China in those days, the Divine Sun of Heaven controlled not
alone the destinies by the memories of men."</p>

<p>Tillizinni rose to go.</p>

<p>"One last question," he asked. "Do you intend publishing the
information you have at any future date?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said the Ambassador briefly.</p>

<p>Tillizinni had occasion to go into the red drawing-room, where
he had left his hat and walking-stick.</p>

<p>A man was sitting waiting&mdash;a tall, good-looking man,
jaunty enough in spite of the poverty of his attire.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham, I believe," said Tillizinni, and the other
rose.</p>

<p>"You are the gentleman who searched my luggage at King's Cross
cloak-room," said Captain Talham, without resentment, and the
detective laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"That is a confession which I should not care to make," he
said. "How do you know your luggage had been searched?"</p>

<p>"I have had some experience," said the other coolly, "and it
may interest you to know that, since your search, a more
conscientious search-party took away the whole of my baggage and
has, so far, failed to replace it."</p>

<p>Tillizinni was genuinely concerned. This strange man had a
tender spot in his heart for the needy and it needed no second
glance at the man from China to discover his straitened
circumstances.</p>

<p>He drew a chair forward.</p>

<p>"I am interested in this," he said. "Perhaps I can help
you."</p>

<p>Captain Talham raised a dignified and protesting hand.</p>

<p>"The normal mind," he said "rejects without hesitation the
instinct of rebellion against recognised authority. Undisciplined
resentment toward social safeguards imposed by society for its
own protection is atavistic. I appreciate the necessity for the
examination you made and regard as admirable the choice of agent
which the government has made. Moreover, since I am directly and
frankly interested in discovering the location of Mount Li, and
came to this country by the same ship as certain documents
revealing that location, your suspicion was pardonable."</p>

<p>He said all this, scarcely pausing to take breath.</p>

<p>Tillizinni's face, schooled to conceal his emotion, displayed
no hint of his sensations. Had this man been listening at the
door of the study, that he should take up the threads of the
Ambassador's discourse?</p>

<p>Talham seemed to divine the working of the Italian's mind, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"I gather you have been discussing the matter with
Chu-hsi-han. I gather that because you did not make your call
till after the publication of his article, and because I have
reason for knowing that that article has excited a great deal of
interest in circles with which you are probably
unacquainted&mdash;the Society of Good Intention, for
example."</p>

<p>There was something in his tone which at once interested and
nettled Tillizinni. The stranger had put him on his mettle, too,
challenged his knowledge of forces. Yet the Italian was too big a
man to allow pique to stand in his way of acquiring information.
He was not too clever to learn.</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever about the Society of Good Intention,"
he said; "though I gather from its benevolent title that it is a
Chinese secret society with a felonious propaganda."</p>

<p>Talham was tickled. Here was a man after his own heart.</p>

<p>"The Society," he began, as if to deliver a speech, then
changed his mind. "The Society is purely criminal, though it had
a political origin. It is an off shoot of the Guild of Honourable
Adventurers which flourished in Canton twenty years ago. It has
committed more crimes than any other in China, and it has reached
a pass where&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clear and sharp above the conversation a pistol shot rang
out.</p>

<p>It sounded overhead, and simultaneously the two men leapt to
their feet. With one accord they darted to the door, across the
wide hall, and up the soft-carpeted stairs, Tillizinni leading,
an automatic pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>A servant was standing at the door of the Ambassador's study,
vainly twisting the handle.</p>

<p>"It is locked, Excellencies," he said.</p>

<p>"Out of the way" cried Talham.</p>

<p>The man obeyed with suspicious alacrity. He flew down the
stairs, past the chattering crowd of servants hurrying up.</p>

<p>At the door of the house the Chinaman in the livery of the
Embassy was joined by another.</p>

<p>"We will go quickly, brother," said the first man, "else these
people will know that we are not in the Tao-ae's service."</p>

<p>They passed through the door and out into the dark street as
the sound of a crash told them that Talham had gained admission
to the room above.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness, but the observant Tillizinni had
noted the mother-of-pearl button switch, and his fingers found it
now. Instantly the room was flooded with soft light.</p>

<p>Huddled in his chair was the Ambassador&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>There was no wound which the men could see, and Tillizinni,
going swiftly to the side of the dead man, uttered an
exclamation.</p>

<p>"He has been strangled!" he cried.</p>

<p>Talham leant over the desk, his brows puckered in a frown.</p>

<p>"Strangled! Then who fired that shot?" he asked.</p>

<p>Servants were coming into the room now. The English secretary
pushed a way through a crowd of excited Chinamen. He had been
writing in his study on the third floor when the shot aroused
him.</p>

<p>"Marshall all the servants," said Tillizinni, and whilst this
was being done the detective made an examination of the
apartment. The windows were closed and fastened with a catch, for
the Ambassador shared with his countrymen a horror of
ventilation. There was no possibility of entry from that
direction.</p>

<p>Nothing had been disturbed with the exception of a large
inlaid bureau which stood against one wall of the room. Here the
door had been wrenched open, and a drawer forced and ransacked.
Private papers lay scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>Tillizinni picked up a large envelope. It was inscribed in
Chinese characters "The burial-place of the First Emperor." The
seal on the envelope remained intact, but the cover had been slit
from end to end, and was empty.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Talham's voice explosively.</p>

<p>Tillizinni followed the direction of the pointing finger. The
bottom of the bureau was formed by one huge drawer, the width and
depth of the massive piece of furniture and some eighteen inches
high.</p>

<p>From one corner bright red drops were dripping and forming a
little pool on the carpet.</p>

<p>The two men grasped the bronze handles of the drawer and
pulled.</p>

<p>The body of a man lay in the bottom. He was doubled up so that
his knees were under his chin. He had been shot evidently from
behind, and was quite dead.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"He called himself the 'Star above the Yamen,'" he said, "and
I had an interesting talk with him this afternoon."</p>

<p>For this poor, inanimate thing had been the spokesman of Hyde
Park.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; INTRODUCES MR. SOO</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a busy night for Captain Talham. The
clocks were striking three when he hailed a taxi-cab. Tillizinni
joined him as he stood on the edge of the pavement, and the two
conversed together for some time. Then they entered a cab, and
drove off.</p>

<p>The man who watched them from the opposite side of the road
followed. His car waited in a side street at no great distance,
and it was a car which readily overtook the cab which carried the
two men eastward.</p>

<p>They passed through the stone archway of Scotland Yard, and
the pursuing car continued its way along the Embankment, and in
obedience to the instructions given through the speaking tube,
slowed in Horse Guards Avenue to allow the occupant to
alight.</p>

<p>He was dressed irreproachably in the evening dress of
civilisation, and carried himself with ease and confidence. He
walked back the way the car had come, turned into Scotland Yard
without hesitation, and found the constable on duty very ready to
carry a message to Tillizinni.</p>

<p>The Italian received him alone, and the visitor favoured him
with a ceremonious bow.</p>

<p>Tillizinni took him in from foot to crown in one sweeping and
comprehensive bow.</p>

<p>The newcomer was unquestionably Chinese, though he did not
wear a queue which distinguished the Manchu before the rebellion.
His face was good-looking for a Chinaman, his features clean-cut,
his eyes alone betrayed his nationality. His lips, straight and
thin, were expressionless, and Tillizinni noticed that this
strange man, dressed in the height of fashion, yet with the
restraint which marked the gentleman, wore in one eye a
gold-rimmed monocle.</p>

<p>When he spoke there was no trace of a foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tillizinni?" he said, and the other nodded.</p>

<p>"My name is Soo&mdash;L'ang T'si Soo&mdash;and I am, as you
may suppose, a compatriot of the unfortunate man who was murdered
to-night."</p>

<p>Tillizinni nodded again.</p>

<p>"I know the Prince slightly," said Soo, as he seated himself,
"and naturally I am distressed at the tragic news."</p>

<p>"News travels very fast," responded Tillizinni dryly. "The
Ambassador has not been dead very long."</p>

<p>Soo inclined his head easily.</p>

<p>"I was passing the Embassy, and I saw a number of distracted
servants&mdash;one of whom you sent to find a policeman," he
explained. "Naturally the servants being commonplace Chinamen and
inveterate gossips, were ready to talk to one of their race."</p>

<p>This was plausible enough. Tillizinni, at any rate, could find
no fault with the explanation. He wondered why this Chinese
exquisite should have sought him at three o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>"It is very sad," continued L'ang T'si Soo, shaking his head,
"that one so learned as his Excellency should have been cut off
so ruthlessly."</p>

<p>"It is sadder to me," said Tillizinni, "that the 'Star above
the Yamen' should also have been sacrificed."</p>

<p>What made him say this he could not understand. There was no
reason at all why he should mention the second man.</p>

<p>The effect on his visitor was electrical. He rose instantly
and noiselessly from his chair, the monocle dropped from his eye,
and the eyelids lowered till the detective saw no more than two
straight, glittering slits of black.</p>

<p>"'Star above the Yamen'?" he repeated. "What do you mean?" All
the suaveness, all the languid drawl had gone out of his voice:
it was harsh and metallic. The white-gloved hands were clenched
till the delicate kid was stretched to breaking point. He stood
erect and tense; there was something animal in his poise,
something tigerish in his attitude.</p>

<p>"What I mean," said Tillizinni slowly, "is just this. In
addition to the Ambassador, a man was killed&mdash;shot from
behind, evidently by his confederates. As I have reconstructed
the crime, the murderers were disguised in the livery of the
Embassy, and made their escape in the confusion. 'Star above the
Yamen' was probably killed because his murderers desired
something which he had. He has been identified by this."</p>

<p>The detective took a sheet of paper from his pocket, and
handed it across the desk to the other.</p>

<p>Soo looked at the Chinese characters long and earnestly.</p>

<p>"It is copied from the man's hong, which was given to Captain
Talham this afternoon by the man himself."</p>

<p>With a supreme effort T'si Soo recovered his self-possession.
Without a word he handed back the sheet, fixed his eyeglass
mechanically and relaxed into his chair.</p>

<p>"That is interesting," he said calmly. "Once I knew a 'Star
above the Yamen,' but this is evidently another man. The
characters change a little as between North and South China, and
my friend does not use this hong."</p>

<p>Tillizinni's observant eye saw the tip of the visitor's tongue
pass over the dry lips.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you wonder why I have come," said the Chinaman,
"and it is only fair to you that I should explain who I am. Your
companion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My companion?" asked Tillizinni sharply.</p>

<p>"The gentleman who is waiting in the next room," said the
suave Oriental, "until I have gone. His Excellency Ho-tao, which
in our language means the River Mandarin, or as you would call
him, Captain Talham, he would know me. I am the son of the
Governor of T'si-lu: to all intents and purposes, I am the
governor."</p>

<p>Tillizinni bowed.</p>

<p>He knew something of this man, who was educated at Oxford,
rented the most expensive of Piccadilly flats, and was reputedly
wealthy.</p>

<p>Soo rose to go.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have allowed my curiosity and my natural
interest in the fate of my countryman to trespass upon your
time," he said. "Here is my address: if I can be of any
assistance to you, please command me."</p>

<p>He put his card upon the table, and with a little bow,
withdrew.</p>

<p>Three minutes later he was speeding eastward as fast as his
car could go. He swept round from the Embankment to Blackfriars
Bridge, and crossed the river. He alighted near the Borough.</p>

<p>"Wait for me!" he said briefly, and the muffled chauffeur
answered in Cantonese.</p>

<p>In a tiny thoroughfare leading off Southwark Street were a
number of small shops, shuttered and silent at this hour of the
morning.</p>

<p>Soo tapped on the shutters of one. It was a gentle tattoo that
he beat, yet the door which flanked the windows was instantly
opened and he passed in. The shop was evidently a laundry, and a
Chinese laundry at that. He passed swiftly across the shop
through the living-room at the back, in which one feeble light
burned, and without hesitation turned sharply and descended the
stairs which led directly from the living-room to the cellars
below.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs was a door. Again he knocked, and
again the door was opened by a Chinaman in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>The man removed his pipe as Soo entered, and made a profound
obeisance.</p>

<p>The cellar was a large one, and its walls were covered with
blood-red paper on which were painted crude, black drawings and
characters illustrating the "Song of Lament." There was one table
above which an oil-lamp swung, and about were seated half a dozen
men in various conditions of dishabille. Despite the coldness of
the night, the cellar was uncomfortably hot, for a big charcoal
brazier glowed in a wall recess where in some forgotten age had
stood a European stove.</p>

<p>The men rose as Soo entered, concealing their hands in their
sleeves.</p>

<p>"Where is my brother?" asked Soo quickly.</p>

<p>He addressed a cadaverous old Chinaman who stood nearest the
brazier.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, "your illustrious brother has not
returned."</p>

<p>"Where are Yung-ti and Hop-lee?" demanded Soo.</p>

<p>"Lord, they have not returned," answered the other.</p>

<p>Soo looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Ming-ya says&mdash;" began the old man, but stopped as if he
thought better of it.</p>

<p>"Ming-ya says&mdash;what?" asked Soo. "Answer me, old fool,
quickly!"</p>

<p>The old man bowed.</p>

<p>"The seven blessings of heaven upon your highness," he said
humbly. "But Ming-ya says that neither Yung-ti nor Hop-lee will
return."</p>

<p>Ming-ya, a youthful Cantonese with the dull eye of an opium
sot, nodded.</p>

<p>"That is true," he croaked hoarsely; "for these two men I
heard speaking to-night when I was taking my pipe, and they
thought I could not hear them&mdash;they go to China
to-night."</p>

<p>Soo waited for a time; his head sank on his chest, buried in
thought.</p>

<p>Then his eye singled out a thoughtful face which had been
turned to him from the moment he entered. It was the face of a
young man who stood where the shadow of the lamp fell&mdash;for
one side of the lamp had been shaded so that no gleam of direct
light could be detected from the street above. With a jerk of his
head Soo signed for him to follow, and without another word the
two men left the cellar, the door closing behind them with a
click.</p>

<p>In the shop above T'si Soo turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"Lo-Rang," he said, "these two men have killed my
brother&mdash;and yours, for we of the Society of Good Intention
are all brothers, having sworn by our ancestors to keep faith.
Also they have taken away a certain paper which I sent them to
get."</p>

<p>The younger man inclined his head obediently.</p>

<p>"I sent my brother with them because I feared treachery. He it
was&mdash;so the foreigners say&mdash;who found the paper, and
because they needed it for their treachery and could get it no
other way, they have killed him."</p>

<p>"Excellency," said Lo-Rang meekly, "all this I know. Tell me
what I shall do?"</p>

<p>"Find those men," said Soo, "and shah!"</p>

<p>The young man bowed reverently and turned, disappearing into
the back of the shop.</p>

<p>He returned with a tiny bundle of clothes, and a long,
narrow-bladed knife.</p>

<p>"This is the knife with which I killed a man in Hoo Sin," he
said proudly, and Soo nodded his acknowledgment.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE AMULET OF JADE</h2>

<p class="first">MR. RAYMOND DE COSTA put down his paper, and
looked thoughtfully at his son who sat opposite to him at the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>Gregory de Costa favoured his father in that he was below the
medium height and somewhat stout for a man of twenty-four. His
complexion had a tinge of bronze-red, which is to be found in
those families which trace back to "colour," and, indeed, there
was a history of a mésalliance which brought wealth but an
undesirable Eurasian strain into the De Costa family. They
referred to themselves as a Portuguese house, and Portuguese they
may have been originally; but generations of De Costas had lived
and died in the Madras presidency, illustrious amongst the
chee-chee folk, but unquestionably of them.</p>

<p>Raymond, the elder, was the richest of the De Costa clan. He
was fat and wheezy; his face was swollen with good living and
self-indulgence&mdash;for he denied himself none of the
excellencies of life. It was not an attractive face, though the
two black eyes that burned all the time as though with fever,
were fascinating. They were "seeing" eyes; they watched and
absorbed all things within their radius. They were terribly alive
and eager. They seemed to denote and indicate a separate
existence to that which the gross, unshapely body of the man
enjoyed.</p>

<p>The elder man&mdash;he must have been sixty&mdash;raised his
be-ringed hand and gently caressed the stubble of grey moustache
on his upper lip.</p>

<p>He was contemplating this dreadful son of his, from his sleek,
shiny head, to his sleek, shiny boots.</p>

<p>"Gregory," he said after a while, "have you seen the papers
this morning?"</p>

<p>The younger man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted, though in the admission he knew he might
earn a reproof, for he was undergoing a course of education which
included a knowledge of the daily happenings of life.</p>

<p>To his surprise the inevitable lecture was not forthcoming.
Instead&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Chinese Ambassador was murdered last night," said his
father softly.</p>

<p>Gregory stared.</p>

<p>There was something in the very gentleness of Raymond de
Costa's voice which made the younger man feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Murdered&mdash;poor devil!" he said. "Was that where you went
last night? I suppose they sent for you?"</p>

<p>Raymond sat upright suddenly.</p>

<p>"Where I went! What do you mean?" he demanded harshly. "I went
nowhere."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard you come in at one o'clock," said the
youth, reaching for an apple from the table. "I didn't sleep too
well."</p>

<p>The other frowned.</p>

<p>"I did not come in for an excellent reason," he said with
asperity; "I was in bed at eleven o'clock and I did not stir out
of my bed until Thomas brought my coffee this morning."</p>

<p>The young man was unconvinced.</p>

<p>"But, governor," he protested, "I saw Thomas with your boots,
and they were all covered with mud."</p>

<p>The old man thumped the table with a snarl of anger.</p>

<p>"I wasn't out of the house last night, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Gregory de Costa was alarmed at the storm he had brought down
upon his head.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he mumbled apologetically. "I must have dreamt
it."</p>

<p>"What is this about you're not sleeping well?" demanded the
other, changing the conversation abruptly. "Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Ill? No; it's nothing! I'm just feeling a bit rotten."</p>

<p>He got up from the table and walked disconsolately to the
window, gazing gloomily into the street.</p>

<p>"Is it that girl of yours?" asked his father with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"Which girl?" asked the other resentfully "Do you mean Miss
Yale?"</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>The youth was silent for a while.</p>

<p>"She's not my girl by any means, governor," he said
despairingly. "I wish to heaven she was! She treats me like
dirt&mdash;absolutely like dirt!"</p>

<p>Raymond de Costa smiled.</p>

<p>"Pretty people to treat a son of mine like dirt," he said
disdainfully. "The mother is head over heels in debt; the girl
only looks presentable because she does a little writing. Why
don't you make up to the mother?"</p>

<p>The young man turned round, his hands thrust deep into his
trouser pockets, discontent eloquently written on his face.</p>

<p>"The mother's all right," he grumbled, "can twist Mrs. Yale
round that." He held up a stodgy little finger. "If it was only
the mother there would be no trouble. It's the girl."</p>

<p>"Give her presents; women like that sort of thing!" suggested
his father, but the young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"I've given her&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of things!" said the youth vaguely. His conscience
was troubling him a little. Something was very much on his
mind.</p>

<p>There is an intense sympathy between some fathers and some
sons which is generally all to the good. It sometimes, however,
works out to the embarrassment of one of the partners. De Costa
père had a trick of catching mind impressions; and now there came
to him the recollections of something he wished to say.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said carelessly, "Miss Yale has something
which I should very much like to possess."</p>

<p>The youth made no attempt to discover what that something was.
He glanced a little apprehensively at his parent and waited.</p>

<p>"Miss Yale," the other went on, "has a bangle, which, from the
description I have had of it, must be the very companion of one
which I have been scouring the world to secure, and which that
thief Song-lu of Nanping swore he had dispatched to me by
registered post."</p>

<p>He rose from the table too, a scowl on his unpleasant
face.</p>

<p>"It cost me over a thousand pounds to find, and another
thousand to buy," he said; "and Song-lu expects me to believe
that he entrusted it to the registered post!"</p>

<p>"When ought it to have arrived?" stammered Gregory, very red
in the face and horribly conscious of a desire to bolt.</p>

<p>"During my absence in China," said his father. Then, sharply:
"You saw nothing of a bangle, did you?"</p>

<p>Gregory de Costa cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I wanted to say&mdash;I've had an uncomfortable feeling," he
said incoherently, "that a bangle came to me&mdash;at least I
thought it was for me&mdash;some old curio that you'd picked up,
governor. I hadn't any idea it was for you it was just addressed
'Mister de Costa.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, you've got it!" There was relief and pleasure in Raymond
de Costa's face.</p>

<p>The son hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I haven't exactly got it. As a matter of
fact I thought you meant me to give it away&mdash;so I gave
it!"</p>

<p>De Costa stared at his son open-mouthed. His face went paler
and paler with almost unconquerable rage.</p>

<p>"Gave it away?" he said at last, restraining himself with the
greatest effort. "And to whom did you give it, you precious
fool?"</p>

<p>"I gave it to Miss Yale," said the young man sullenly. "How
was I to know?"</p>

<p>"How was he to know?" De Costa, senior, appealed to the
ceiling in his exasperation. "How was he to know that I should
not waste my time picking up curios for a moon-calf? Oh, Gregory
Marcus de Costa, you make me tire!"</p>

<p>It was chee-chee now. All the Eurasian in him was indicated in
his voice and his manner. Tears of rage stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>Only a man of iron will could have overcome his natural
disabilities as did old De Costa, because of a sudden he became
very calm.</p>

<p>"You must go at once to Miss Yale, and on any excuse whatever
you must regain possession of that bracelet. Tell her," he bent
his brows in thought, "tell her that you have learnt that it came
from somebody who was suffering with the plague. Tell her
anything&mdash;but get the bangle. She shall have diamonds in its
stead. Go!"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, governor," began Gregory. The old man
bared his teeth.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he said savagely.</p>

<p>Gregory de Costa went to his room with a grievance and a fear.
Suppose Yvonne Yale would not surrender this precious circle of
jade? Suppose she were hurt&mdash; no such luck! The worst and
the most likely thing that could happen would be that she would
seize an excellent and providential opportunity for ridding
herself of an undesirable suitor.</p>

<p>He dressed himself with care, swearing at his reflection in
the glass as at his worst enemy. He counted his money
mechanically before transferring it from one pocket to the
other&mdash;a frugal soul was Gregory de Costa!&mdash;and
examined with care the interior of his pocket-book. He would
avail himself of his father's offer. It would be a diamond
bracelet which he would offer as a substitute, and no girl in her
senses could refuse that. He found consolation in the prospect,
and finished his dressing carefully.</p>

<p>The Yales, mother and daughter, lived in a tiny house in Upper
Curzon Street&mdash; a little house which had managed to squeeze
itself between two more imposing façades and strove
unsuccessfully to pretend that it had been there all the
time.</p>

<p>Miss Yale was alone, the servant informed him, and added with
the garrulous familiarity of a servant from whom her mistress had
no secrets, that she had gone to the bank.</p>

<p>In the little drawing-room on the first floor Mr. de Costa
junior found a lady who was coldly polite and undisguisedly
surprised to see him at that hour in the morning.</p>

<p>He blundered to his fate.</p>

<p>"Fact is, Miss Yvonne&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Miss Yale," she corrected him with a little smile.</p>

<p>"Sorry. Fact is, there's been a plague."</p>

<p>"A plague?"</p>

<p>He nodded vigorously, satisfied with the sensation he had
created.</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid that I don't understand," she said. "Where is
the plague, and what has it to do with me?"</p>

<p>"In China," he lied glibly. "Thousands of fellows dead. My
governor is awfully upset; that bracelet, you know."</p>

<p>She began to comprehend, and nodded.</p>

<p>"You see," he went on eagerly, "the man that owned it has the
plague, and the governor's awfully concerned about you. So if
you'll let me have it, we'll just put it where it can do no
harm."</p>

<p>He was flushed with self-satisfaction; already it seemed his
task was satisfactorily performed. But her next words sent a
flood of ice-water down his back.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said; "but I haven't got it."</p>

<p>"Haven't? Oh, I say, Miss Yvonne! Oh, come now!" he almost
wailed. "You must have it. I shall get into an awful row!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry you will get into trouble," she said quietly; "but
I haven't got it at the moment."</p>

<p>"But you must have it, Miss&mdash;Miss Yale. You must!" He was
violent almost in his terror at facing his father empty-handed.
"And I must insist upon your giving it to me."</p>

<p>A wrong&mdash;a fatally wrong&mdash;move on the part of
Gregory de Costa.</p>

<p>The girl stood up, stiff and uncompromising.</p>

<p>"You insist?" she said scornfully. "You forget that the
bracelet is mine, though I assure you I've no desire to keep it.
In a short time I shall have it, and it will be sent to you. Good
morning!"</p>

<p>"If I've said anything offensive," pleaded the young man
humbly, yet in his humility mopping his brow with a handkerchief,
the gaudiness of which was in itself an offence.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Yvonne Yale, with a little inclination of
dismissal.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and De Costa checked his flood
of apology.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham," announced the servant, and Captain Talham
followed her quickly into the room.</p>

<p>The girl flashed a little smile of welcome, then turned to the
young man.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham will give you what you desire," she said
coldly; then, to the tall man: "Will you please give this
gentleman the bracelet I gave you yesterday?"</p>

<p>Talham looked from the girl to the youth, and from the youth
to the girl. Then, with a sigh in which relief was evident, he
drew from his right hand pocket something wrapped in tissue paper
and placed it in the outstretched hand of the other.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Mr. Gregory de Costa, and unwrapped the jade
bracelet set about with bands of gold. "Phew!" he said again, and
his trembling fingers stowed the precious circlet in an inside
pocket.</p>

<p>Captain Talham scrutinised him gravely.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "on what small and seemingly trivial
incident does life turn! A petulant word&mdash;the hint of
offensiveness to this dear lady"&mdash;he waved his hand
gracefully in the direction of the embarrassed Yvonne&mdash;"a
sudden revulsion of feeling, which turns penitence to stern and
unscrupulous purpose, hardens the shamed heart, and adds lustre
to villainy."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" asked young Mr. de Costa reasonably
puzzled.</p>

<p>Talham would have proceeded, but something in the girl's eyes,
some mute entreaty, averted him, He favoured the young man with a
bow which effectively dismissed him and turned his attention to
the girl.</p>

<p>She waited until the door closed behind him.</p>

<p>"You are always getting me out of scrapes, Captain Talham,"
she smiled.</p>

<p>"You've got me out of a scrape," he said solemnly, and seated
himself at her gesture.</p>

<p>He had been up all night, he told her without invitation.</p>

<p>He added that he had borrowed a sovereign from a famous
detective whom, with unnecessary caution, he described as Signor
T&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not that I've been to sleep," he said. "I have been engaged
with a Chink"&mdash; he saw she was puzzled&mdash;"a Chinaman,"
he hastened to correct himself. "A very admirable man, who does
things."</p>

<p>An ambiguous but characteristic description, she thought.</p>

<p>He was ill at ease, and remarkably silent through the
interview; spoke little, yet several times seemed to be on the
point of speaking.</p>

<p>"You seem to have something to confess," she said at last in
gentle raillery.</p>

<p>She had to make conversation at an hour of the day when small
talk was a most difficult exercise to assume, and was at her
wits' end for subjects.</p>

<p>Three times he had started with an ominous "I feel that I
ought to tell you" and three times he had stopped and talked
rapidly for a minute or two about some subject wholly irrelevant
to the matter under discussion.</p>

<p>"I have and I haven't," he said slowly. "That is to say, I
had, and probably that from a strictly ethical standpoint still
have. It is a nice question."</p>

<p>He rose to go with startling abruptness.</p>

<p>"There is something troubling you, my man," thought she in an
amused way.</p>

<p>"Miss Yale," he said solemnly. "In war all expedients are
justified."</p>

<p>"I agree," she smiled. "But exactly what are you thinking
about?" It may be that Captain Talham had no intention of telling
her at that precise moment. What is certain, however, is that in
his agitation he pulled his handkerchief from an inside pocket
and with it something which fell upon the floor, The girl looked
at it in wonder; and well she might, for there was an absolute
replica of the ornament she had returned to young De Costa a few
moments before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; MR. SOHO MAKES A DISCOVERY</h2>

<p class="first">MR. DE COSTA, senior, sat in his study until
late that night. His son had gone to a musical comedy to the
relief of his mind and the repair of a crushed spirit, and Mr. de
Costa was alone in the house save one man-servant&mdash;a
half-caste factotum, who was neither butler nor errand-boy nor
valet, and yet performed the functions of each.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock a man came to the house and was admitted
through the servants' entrance. He was shown at once to the
study.</p>

<p>De Costa looked over his glasses at the visitor and pointed to
a chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Soo," he said, and the Chinaman, with a jerk and
wriggle intended to display his respect for superiority, and his
reluctance to seat himself in the presence of greatness,
obeyed.</p>

<p>He was above medium height, and pallid even for a Chinaman.
His high cheekbones and thin, straight lips, gave him sinister
appearance, yet he was by no means bad-looking, for the nose was
straight and well proportioned to the face. He wore no queue, and
his black hair was brushed back in the style affected by the
youth of England. His eyes were larger than the average, set
about in a void face&mdash;void of emotion, of the expression and
capacity for feeling.</p>

<p>Whatever humility convention may have dictated on his arrival,
he had no false views on the question of his equality for the man
who sat at the desk, for he leant over, lifted the lid of a
silver box, and extracted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Mr. de Costa, blotting a letter he had written,
"what is the news?" The man he called Soo shook his head as he
applied a light to the cigarette.</p>

<p>"I come to you for news," he said. "In my humble circle we
talk of nothing more interesting than the surprising results
which follow a game of Fan-tan."</p>

<p>"Where did you pick up your English?" asked De Costa
irritably. It is never pleasant to know that one whom in your
heart you grade below your own intellectual level is your
superior in scholastic attainments.</p>

<p>"I picked it up in the place where one acquires much
enlightenment," said Soo carelessly.</p>

<p>He blew a ring of smoke towards the ceiling, and watched it
disappear.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't imagine," said he, "that I was intended for the
ministry; yet that is the fact. There were good people who
thought I would make an ideal missionary, and by the force of my
personality and the knowledge of my own people, wean them from
the traditions and the philosophies of two thousand years to the
half-hearted philosophies, imperfectly understood and imperfectly
promulgated in twenty different ways by the intelligent people of
this country."</p>

<p>De Costa said nothing. He was too wily a man to be drawn into
a discussion on a subject with which he was not too well
acquainted.</p>

<p>Soo had an irritating trick of getting him out of his
depths.</p>

<p>"I understand you've got the bracelet," said the Chinaman, and
the other acknowledged the possession.</p>

<p>He unlocked the drawer of his desk, and took out a steel box.
From this he extracted the bangle which Talham had handed to his
son.</p>

<p>It was still in its paper wrapping, and Soo paused awhile
before he removed the tissue.</p>

<p>"It is very light for jade," he said suspiciously.</p>

<p>He threw the end of his cigarette into the fireplace with a
quick movement of his hand, and stripped the ornament of its
wrapper.</p>

<p>He looked at it carefully, twisting the bangle about in his
hand.</p>

<p>"This is not jade," he said.</p>

<p>"Not jade," repeated the merchant, and half rose from his
chair. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"This is celluloid," said the calm Soo, "cleverly copied and
possibly weighted to give it the appearance of jade."</p>

<p>He balanced it carefully on his hand; then he examined the
gold bands.</p>

<p>"Yes, as I thought," he said, "the weight is in the gold."</p>

<p>He inspected the inscriptions and read them carefully. Half
obliterated as they were, it was no easy task to decipher them by
artificial light. Then he put the bangle upon the table, "Your
friend has deceived you," he said quietly. "This is not the
famous Shu Shun bracelet. It is not even an imitation. These
writings"&mdash;he tapped the bangle with his fingers&mdash;"are
commonplace copybook maxims, as you would call them in this
country."</p>

<p>He picked up the ornament again, and read: "An ungrateful son
is a disappointed father."</p>

<p>"The father of patience is wisdom, and the source of peace is
love."</p>

<p>"You have been fooled, my friend!" he said. De Costa sprang to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Explain what you mean," he said.</p>

<p>The Chinaman was lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p>"It is very simple." He looked abstractedly at the ceiling,
and spoke half to himself: "The girl had the original bracelet,
and has returned this. Either she, or one of her friends, has the
bangle; and it is our business to get it. Without that"&mdash;he
lowered his voice&mdash;"everything that happened yesterday was
in vain."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about yesterday," said De Costa hurriedly. "That
is a subject which I never wish to discuss; you don't know how
I'm feeling about it, Soo. I never wanted anybody hurt, I swear I
didn't."</p>

<p>The Chinaman interrupted him with a slow smile.</p>

<p>"These things are not done by politeness," he said. "You are
going into a big enterprise, and you must take a correspondingly
big risk."</p>

<p>"I take no risks," said De Costa, white of face. "I know
nothing whatever about it. Two deaths! My God, they
couldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Soo nodded.</p>

<p>"They could indeed," he said easily. "If anybody hangs for
what happened last night, be sure that you hang with them. You
have gone into this matter, De Costa, with your eyes open. You
saw a chance of obtaining an enormous treasure, and you took all
risk. You Westerners," he went on, "place too high a value upon
human life."</p>

<p>He half rose from his chair, leant across to the desk, and
picked up the bangle again, examining it with an amused smile.
Then, as he replaced it upon the table, he said grimly: "The
events of yesterday about which you do not wish to speak, would
have been wholly unnecessary had I known in time that this bangle
existed."</p>

<p>"But surely," began De Costa, "the paper you found&mdash;"</p>

<p>Soo shook his head. He was calmness itself. "I have no
papers," he said simply.</p>

<p>De Costa stared at him.</p>

<p>"No papers! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean exactly what I say," said the other. He marked the
situation upon the outstretched fingers of his hand. "Three men
were sent to secure an envelope from the Chinese Ambassador's
bureau, and one of them was killed. Two made their escape with
the papers concerning the matter. I have not seen them
since."</p>

<p>"Gone?" said De Costa.</p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated the other. "There is another influence at
work. I am inclined to associate an old acquaintance of
mine&mdash;Captain Talham. You probably know him!" De Costa
nodded.</p>

<p>"He is interested in this matter of Mount Li. So firm was my
conviction that he was behind the treachery of my two men, that I
took the liberty of preparing a little surprise for him last
night. Unfortunately," he said with regret, "it did not
materialise. But to-night&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, and buttoned his overcoat, turning up the
collar about his neck.</p>

<p>"I must go now," he said. "There is a lot of work to be done
before to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"What work?" asked De Costa.</p>

<p>"I am going to recover the bracelet," said Soo, and there was
that in his eyes which made the older man quail.</p>

<p>"There will be no violence?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"None, I assure you," said the other airily.</p>

<p>"Remember," said De Costa almost tremulously, "that it is a
woman you have to deal with."</p>

<p>"I have dealt with many women," said Soo, "and I find very
little difference between the sexes save that the gentler is a
trifle more courageous, and a little more willing to bear the
consequences of their folly."</p>

<p>De Costa accompanied him into the regions of the kitchen and
showed him to the door which led to the area. Not another word
was spoken between the two men.</p>

<p>De Costa closed the door behind his visitor and bolted it
securely. He went back to his study and drained off a glass of
neat brandy.</p>

<p>He went to bed that night in no happy frame of mind.</p>

<p>He might have been less happy, as he lay tossing from side to
side in his bed, had he seen the dark figure of a man stealing in
the shadow of the wall which formed a tiny courtyard at the back
of his house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; A CRIME OF TILLIZINNI</h2>

<p class="first">WHOEVER the masked man was who was working so
deliberately at the back door of Mr. de Costa's respectable
dwelling, he went to work methodically and without any indication
that he feared detection. He carried a little tiny kit of tools
which he had spread upon the ground, and from time to time he
leant down and selected one of these by the light of a small
electric lamp which he flashed for a moment upon the kit's
contents.</p>

<p>He took some trouble to avoid anything in the nature of a
violent noise, and it was half an hour before the lock, and a
portion of the door, came away very gently in his hand.</p>

<p>As methodically he leant down and rolled up the tools, placing
them in his pocket; he pushed the door open, and entered.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in forcing another door, or in gaining
the wide hallway which formed the principal entrance to the
house.</p>

<p>In half an hour he pursued his inquiries with quiet
confidence.</p>

<p>The dining-room yielded nothing; the rather ornate
drawing-room no more. Yet he made a systematic search, flickering
his light here and there, moving such pictures as he thought
might conceal that which he sought.</p>

<p>He reserved his examination of the study till the last. He
found some cigarette ends in the fireplace and picked them up
cautiously, examining the brand with the light of his lantern.
These he wrapped carefully in a piece of paper, and placed in his
waistcoat pocket. He opened all the drawers and methodically
examined them, replacing them just as he had found them, and
relocked the drawers after him with a curious key which he took
from his pocket.</p>

<p>After a while he mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>De Costa occupied the first room on the second floor, and the
door faced the stairs, and on the right was another door, which
led to the dressing-room, which again gave access to the
principal bedroom.</p>

<p>The visitor made no attempt to force the door for some
minutes, but devoted his attention to the door on the right.</p>

<p>It opened easily. He stood in the doorway listening. For all
he knew De Costa may have had alarms fixed; but no bell or buzzer
woke the stillness of the night. He closed the door gently behind
him; the floor was carpeted with thick felt, and the precaution
he had taken of enclosing his feet in galoshes was unnecessary.
In this room, as he knew, was the intimate safe of the
merchant's.</p>

<p>He had come prepared to open that safe and inspect its
interior. In his pocket was a heavy iron bottle containing
sufficient oxygen for his purpose, and in another pocket the
blow-pipe and the instruments necessary to burn out the lock of
the safe.</p>

<p>He switched on his pocket light, and turned it unhesitatingly
in the direction of where the safe was to be found. Instantly his
thumb closed upon the switch, and his light went out. Facing him
was a man who stood with his back to the safe. His face was
covered with a black crêpe mask, and in his hand, pointing
insistently in the direction of the other, was a long-barrelled
Colt revolver.</p>

<p>He might have saved himself the trouble of switching off his
light, for instantly from the stranger's disengaged hand a white
beam of light shot out. He had come similarly equipped.</p>

<p>"Go downstairs," whispered the man by the safe, "and keep your
hands away from your pockets."</p>

<p>There was nothing for the burglar to do but to obey. Without a
word he turned and walked out of the room, the other following a
few paces behind.</p>

<p>"To the kitchen!" whispered the second man, and the burglar
turned obediently.</p>

<p>They entered the big, underground kitchen together, the second
man closing the door behind him before he felt on the wall for
the switch. In a minute the room was illuminated, and they stood
facing each other.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the second man quietly.</p>

<p>"I prefer to remain anonymous," said the burglar.</p>

<p>He was the taller of the two, a man above medium height, and
his voice had just that touch of culture which one does not
expect from a member of the criminal classes.</p>

<p>"I prefer to see your face," said the second man. The burglar
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Existence," he said oracularly, "is made up of unsatisfied
desires. Nature in the ordering of her plans does not take into
account the prejudices&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" gasped the other. "Captain Talham!" The
burglar was silenced momentarily, apparently annoyed too.</p>

<p>"I am Captain Talham," he said with ridiculous pride, and took
off his mask; "though why you should know me I fail to
understand."</p>

<p>The second man laughed&mdash;a low, musical, chuckling
laugh.</p>

<p>"I know you all right," he answered.</p>

<p>Talham stood for a moment fidgeting by the side of the kitchen
table; then: "Let us put our cards on the table, Tillizinni," he
said.</p>

<p>It was the second man's turn to start.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know you!" Talham went on. "I always remember
people by their hands; and as you probably know, the third
knuckle of your left is more prominent than any other."</p>

<p>Tillizinni laughed.</p>

<p>"We seem to have made a pretty mess of it between us," he
said; "as I gather, we are both here on the same errand."</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"You can save yourself the trouble of tampering with the safe.
I've already been to it."</p>

<p>"How did you get in?" asked Talham.</p>

<p>The detective shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>"The last thing I can do is to arrange to get out," he
answered evasively. "What did you find?"</p>

<p>Talham hesitated.</p>

<p>"I found nothing, save that our friend T'si Soo has been here.
Some of his cigarette ends were in the fireplace; at least, they
are Chinese, and I gather&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"I didn't need his cigarette ends to know that," he said. "I
saw him come out."</p>

<p>They left the house together, walking arm in arm, through the
front door, leaving the door ajar, and walked away under the very
nose of a policeman who stood at the corner of a street a hundred
yards from the house.</p>

<p>For a long time neither man spoke. Then Tillizinni burst into
a fit of uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>"You amuse me very much," he said, "although you annoy me.
Here is a situation worthy of a comic opera. I go to burgle a
house for my own private ends. I meet another burglar, whom it is
my duty, as an officer of the law, to arrest."</p>

<p>"Let's go and talk it over!" said Talham.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"You're a curious man," said Tillizinni, and
Captain Talham did not consider it worth while to correct him,
though "curious" was an obvious misapplication of a word.</p>

<p>A bright, cheerful fire burnt in the big Adam fireplace, and
the shaded lamp on the table afforded enough light to the room.
Outside, day was breaking over the dull silver of the river and
slow moving tugs were passing up with the tide, drawing a trail
of clumsy barges in their wake.</p>

<p>Tillizinni's rooms in Adelphi Terrace offered the finest view
in London, but never was London more attractive than in the early
hours of a frosty winter morning.</p>

<p>Neither of the two men had slept that night. A bundle of
papers, each giving a brief account of the tragedy, was at the
detective's elbow. He looked across to Talham in his worn
garments. You could not pity the tall man. His confidence, his
self-satisfaction&mdash;in the best sense of the
word&mdash;precluded pity. He sat now with a fragrant cigar
between his teeth, a steaming cup of coffee within reach on a
little table by his side, his legs crossed&mdash;a model of
contentment.</p>

<p>"I gather, of course," Tillizinni went on, "that you wanted to
find the Ts'in tomb, and I must confess that I regarded your
search as being little removed, in point of self-interest, from
the efforts of our Chinese friends."</p>

<p>Talham shook his head.</p>

<p>"Accustomed as you are to the venal predilections," he
began.</p>

<p>Tillizinni put up his hands to his ears in mock despair.</p>

<p>"Do you forget that I am Italian?" he asked.</p>

<p>The great anthropologist was a man of quick likes and quicker
dislikes. Never before had he found one to whom he felt so warm
and so instant a regard as he did with this adventurer. Add the
warm and generous qualities of his southern nature, interest in
the rara humanis which his science dictated, and there is every
excuse for the sudden friendship which has so often been the
subject of criticism.</p>

<p>Tillizinni was at the zenith of his fame; he had handled the
danger of the Fourth Plague with rare courage and ingenuity, and
his name at this time was in all mouths. Even Scotland Yard, a
cautious institution which does not take the stranger to its
bosom, however brilliant he may be, had succumbed to his
fascination, and Room 673E was "Mr. Tillizinni's Room," just as
surely and unalterably as Room 1 is the Chief Commissioner's.</p>

<p>He leant forward to stir the fire, and to return an escaping
coal to its glowing inferno.</p>

<p>"Will your man do the work you require?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the time?"</p>

<p>The detective nodded, and Talham pursed his lips
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He has till eleven," he said; "and a Chinese mechanic can do
much in seven hours."</p>

<p>There was a restful little interval of silence, which
Tillizinni broke.</p>

<p>"It is most fantastic&mdash;the most bizarre idea I have ever
heard," he said. "From no other human being in the world would I
accept such a story. Yet I believe you."</p>

<p>"Of course you do," retorted Talham simply.</p>

<p>Tillizinni stared; then an amused smile crossed his thin lips.
The other surveyed him with great earnestness, then leant
forward.</p>

<p>"Signor Tillizinni," he said, "the acquirement of wealth is a
process which too often dissipates the qualities of self-respect.
I will be a millionaire, not as the thief who robbed a tomb of
dross"&mdash;he snapped his fingers finely&mdash; "but as the
genius who wrested from the dead ages the secret and its
attainments. I am satisfied that in the tomb of Ts'in I shall
have revealed to me that supreme mechanical wonder of all
time&mdash;perpetual motion."</p>

<p>His face was tense; his eyes glossed with the splendour of the
thought. So the eyes of Christopher Columbus might have burnt as
he sighted, through the spray, the low, grey cloud of land upon
his bow.</p>

<p>"All this story of mechanical devices," Talham went on
rapidly. "These rivers of quicksilver which run for ever by some
complexity of machinery&mdash;it is all true. There may be little
or no treasure; but that device lies hidden as surely as the
bones of the architects are upon the floor of the chasm."</p>

<p>He rose, and paced the room with short, quick, nervous
steps.</p>

<p>"But suppose when you opened the tomb you found nothing?"
asked Tillizinni. "Suppose the device was non-existent and the
quicksilver rivers had disappeared, and there was nothing but the
store of treasure?"</p>

<p>Talham thought for a while.</p>

<p>"I should take the treasure," he said impressively, "and
afterwards I should close the tomb reverently and come away."</p>

<p>Tillizinni laughed. It was a long, rich, chuckling laugh of
pure enjoyment, which not even the reproachful eye of the other
could suppress.</p>

<p>"I like you," said Tillizinni; "and if I do not consider it my
duty to hamper you, I shall find a pleasure in helping you in
your search."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the two men were dozing in their chairs,
proof enough of the ease which comes with friendship.</p>

<p>It was not until ten o'clock, with the bright, winter's
sunlight flooding the room, that Tillizinni awoke with a sense of
refreshment. The big lamp upon the table still burnt, and he
extinguished it.</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon Talham still fast asleep. His legs
outstretched, his hands thrust into trouser pockets, and his chin
on his breast.</p>

<p>Tillizinni moved across the room noiselessly, and looked out
into the terrace below. There were two tradesmen's carts
delivering goods at a neighbouring club. He closed the French
windows of the room and returned to Talham, and dropped his hand
upon the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>Talham was awake instantly.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" he asked, as he saw the other's face.</p>

<p>Tillizinni shook his head.</p>

<p>"That we are both alive is evidence that nothing is wrong," he
said. "Look at the mantelpiece!" Talham raised his eyes.</p>

<p>On the shelf above the fireplace, between two Tanagra
statuettes, was a small, square, black box, as large as a small
tea-caddy, and not unlike one in its appearance. Dependent from
the case, hung a length of fuse some eight inches long, and the
end was burnt black.</p>

<p>"Ashes in the fireplace&mdash;obviously fuse," said
Tillizinni, kneeling down. "What made it stop burning, I wonder?"
He examined the little rope minutely, using a reading-glass.</p>

<p>"That's blood!" He pointed with his finger to a stain near the
burnt end. "The man who placed this here had blood on his
hands&mdash;probably cut himself in making the entrance. Now,
where?" He walked to the door of the room and, opening it,
crossed the broad landing. Another room opened from here, and he
entered. It was used as a boxroom, and should have been locked.
For the matter of that, it should have possessed a lock of more
service than the twisted piece of metal that lay on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Wrenched off with a modern pocket-jack," said Tillizinni
approvingly. "A neat piece of work. Don't touch the lock; we'll
hunt for a finger-print by and by. Window open! Humph!" It was
clear which way the thing had come. "We've had a narrow escape,"
said Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"So did he," said Talham.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; AN AFTERNOON CALL</h2>

<p class="first">TALHAM was seized with the idea of making an
afternoon call, and waited on Tillizinni, to the detective's
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Tillizinni," he said, "one of the duties which civilisation
imposes upon its products, is the obligation under which we all
rest, to observe the social amenities."</p>

<p>After which preamble he deigned to explain that he had
accepted an invitation for himself and for the detective, to what
he termed "a party."</p>

<p>Tillizinni had visions of being called upon to sing, or do
parlour tricks, and he hastily excused himself.</p>

<p>"You must come," said Talham gravely. "I did perhaps overstep
the conventions when, without consulting you, I accepted this
invitation on your behalf. But I think you will enjoy yourself.
Mrs. Smith is a lady of singular charm of manner, and has the
gift which so few women, and indeed so few men, possess, of
appreciating scientific endeavour at its true value."</p>

<p>From which Tillizinni gathered that the lady had been engaged
in impressing upon Talham what a fine fellow he was.</p>

<p>The detective hesitated. He knew he would be horribly bored,
but it must be confessed he was possessed by a curiosity to know
exactly how Talham would behave in that nebulous sphere which is
called "society."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith had a little house in Bayswater. It was in one of
those long roads which connect Bayswater with Mayfair, and where,
at the Mayfair end, the houses grow narrower and narrower,
crowding against one another as if in a panic lest they stray
into the more unfashionable end of the street.</p>

<p>She was a woman who had a passion for parties, and was never
quite so happy as when she was making two guests groan where one
had groaned before.</p>

<p>Since her entertaining area was severely restricted, it is not
to be wondered that her little social plot was somewhat
overcrowded.</p>

<p>Habitués at Mrs. Smith's "at homes" and functions were
sufficiently well acquainted with the lay of the house to tuck
themselves into odd corners and alcoves; but both Talham and his
apprehensive companion found themselves a little cramped for room
in the tiny hall where six men were endeavouring to find pegs for
their coats at one and the same time.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was on the first floor, and although the
stairs leading up to it were somewhat narrow, Mrs. Smith carried
out the illusion of a Foreign Office reception by receiving her
guests on the first landing with her back to the bathroom door,
and handing them over, as they squeezed past, to an ill-fitted
butler, who conducted them the three or four paces which
separated the end of stairs from the beginning of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>She boasted that she never forgot names, and was wont to cite
herself and King Edward as twin souls in this respect.</p>

<p>Indeed, from time to time, she found many startling phases of
resemblance between herself and various members of the Royal
Family.</p>

<p>The tiny drawing-room was uncomfortably crowded.</p>

<p>Tillizinni found himself wondering, as he pushed his way
through the press, by what extraordinary manoeuvre Mrs. Smith
held and attracted such a large and representative body of
good-looking young men.</p>

<p>He had a lurking suspicion that as fast as they entered the
drawing-room by the door they surreptitiously escaped through the
window.</p>

<p>There was that air of unreality which is frequently to be
found in the small drawing-rooms of the people bitten by the
social bug.</p>

<p>"She called me Mr. Tinker," said Talham's voice in the other's
ear.</p>

<p>His words almost trembled with chagrin. Tillizinni tried to
appease him.</p>

<p>"She called me Phillips," he said with a smile; "though that
is not my name as far as I know. You must allow for lapses in the
memory of a hostess who probably entertains thousands of people
in a year."</p>

<p>Talham was silent, but he was very annoyed indeed.</p>

<p>The press was thickest at one end of the drawing-room, and to
this the two made, following the instinct which invariably draws
man to man&mdash;for men like men in crowds.</p>

<p>"What is the attraction?" grumbled Talham. "Is it not
lamentable," he went on without waiting for a reply, which, as a
matter of fact, the detective was not prepared to offer, "that
with all the joyous and bountiful gifts which nature has prepared
and laid open for her children, men should be found who prefer
the hot and fetid atmosphere of a drawing-room and the
stimulations of artificial gaiety to that ante-chamber of heaven,
the field? Does not the pettiness&mdash;the
inconclusiveness&mdash;of it, strike you? Think of the futility
of effort&mdash;" He got so far and was warming to his subject,
when the little crowd which stood between them and the
attraction, thinned, as a sea-fret thins before a westerly wind,
and Tillizinni saw, for the first time in his life, Yvonne
Yale.</p>

<p>She was standing near the fireplace, listening to a short
youth by her side, with some evidence of boredom.</p>

<p>Her hair, perfectly coiffeured, was a mass of golden brown.
About this she wore a little bandeau of dull gold.</p>

<p>Tillizinni received the impression of observing a crowned
queen&mdash;so proud and straight she stood, with a little tilt
to her chin, and the merest hint of condescension in her eyes, as
she talked to the voluble youth who hung upon her words.</p>

<p>Her gown, cut low at the neck, was very plain. It was of black
velvet, close fitting. About her neck she had three strings of
imitation pearls. Her arms, bare to the elbow, were white and
beautifully shaped; her hands larger than one expected, but
pretty. She had a plain gold bangle about her wrist&mdash;the
only jewel she wore.</p>

<p>Tillizinni looked at Talham. He was staring at the girl, his
lips parted, his eyes wide open, his head a little forward.</p>

<p>At any other moment he would have amused the other, but
Tillizinni had seen that look before&mdash;that strange
earnestness and intensity with which he confronted the problems
of life.</p>

<p>He continued to look, and the girl must have subconsciously
become aware of the unwinking gaze fixed upon her, for she turned
her head and faced him.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood thus, looking one at the other; then
Tillizinni saw a delicate pink creep into her face, and he caught
Talham's arm. "Introduce me," he muttered, "and apologise for my
rudeness."</p>

<p>Obeying rather the dictation of his inner self than any
suggestion of his friend, Talham went towards her, his hand
outstretched.</p>

<p>She held out her hand frankly with a little smile to Talham,
and he took it. He held it, it seemed to Tillizinni, an
unconscionable time. The responsibility of piloting Talham
through the social maze was getting on the nerves of one who was
famous throughout Europe for his freedom from nerve trouble.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you again, Captain Talham," she said with a
dazzling smile which showed two rows of pearly teeth. "We do not
often entertain such distinguished people."</p>

<p>She said this with a gentle note of mockery, but as usual
Talham took her very seriously.</p>

<p>"Whatever views you may hold regarding my friend," he said
gravely, "you must not think of regarding me as distinguished. I
hope, Miss Yale, that you and I shall be great friends. I will
have no artificial barriers erected which may separate to any
extent two people anxious to grow in acquaintance."</p>

<p>The girl looked puzzled. She had uttered the first
conventional pleasantry which had come into her head. She never
regarded Talham as distinguished. To her he was a man, who in the
moment of her necessity, had rendered a kindly and a chivalrous
service.</p>

<p>She turned hurriedly, it seemed to Tillizinni, to introduce
her mother&mdash;a lady dressed in the abrupt fashion which was
suggestive of conflicting bargain sales.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith was engaged in the eternal quest for the missing
segment. It was only a tiny segment that was required to make
both ends of her circle meet. She speculated modestly on the
Stock Exchange, and dreamt dreams of meeting a magnificent,
kindly man who would give her the "tip" of her life.</p>

<p>Then she would buy shares. The market would undergo some
extraordinary evolution, and the shares she bought at one pound,
less fortunate people would want to buy at twenty-five shillings.
Then she would sell, and she would be exactly five shillings per
share to the good.</p>

<p>And if she had had five thousand shares, why then she would
have one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

<p>It was very simple.</p>

<p>On such day dreams as these, men grow rich, but they are
usually the men who sell the shares to the dreamers. But Talham
was not to be detached. He made a little speech to the mother,
and with deplorable sang-froid, dismissed her from the circle. It
was unpardonable, but it was very much Talham.</p>

<p>Tillizinni, watching the scene with his keen eyes, was
chuckling and learning.</p>

<p>But the girl was undoubtedly puzzled. She could not understand
whether Talham was serious, or whether his persistence was a form
of humour which had just about then become popular owing to the
success of a certain socialist dramatist, with whose name I will
not sully these fair pages.</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall be delighted," she murmured pleasantly.</p>

<p>He had invited her to a concert, and had in his magnetic,
plausible way, persuaded her to go.</p>

<p>She altered her position, tapping her foot nervously&mdash;an
infallible sign that she was embarrassed. She looked from Talham
to the dark young man at her side.</p>

<p>Gregory de Costa owed his readmission to the Yale ménage to
the admiration which Mrs. Smith had for his business acumen.
There were some subjects which Yvonne did not regard as being
worth a quarrel, and Gregory de Costa's attendance was one of
these.</p>

<p>He made up for homeliness of face in magnificence of attire.
His dress suit was cut so well that he seemed, like another
famous character, to have been melted and poured into it. In the
breast of his shirt blazed a diamond, almost as big as a hickory
nut. His links, when he raised his hand to caress his tiny
moustache, radiated light. His bejewelled fingers reminded one
irresistibly of the illuminations at Luna Park.</p>

<p>"Do you know Mr. de Costa?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>Talham bowed to the young man, and the young man bowed to
him.</p>

<p>For some reason she did not introduce Tillizinni. "I think I
have met you before, Captain Talham," said the young man.</p>

<p>"I do not think we have ever met you," said Talham with
deliberation.</p>

<p>"In our office?" suggested Mr. de Costa, an encouraging smile
on his thick lips.</p>

<p>"We have never been into your office," said Talham.</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly sure that I have seen you there," persisted the
other.</p>

<p>If he expected that Talham would be satisfied with an exchange
of platitudinous pleasantries with the girl, and then withdraw,
he was disappointed. If he imagined he could draw Talham to a
discussion on so futile a question as his presence in an office
at some remote period of his life, he was mad.</p>

<p>Talham had a weightier interest. The thought that he might be
de trop never occurred to him, and if it had been suggested that
his unconventional method of interesting others in his career and
his aspirations was calculated rather to bore than to grip their
imaginations, he would have smiled, pityingly.</p>

<p>He diagnosed the girl's half-amused embarrassment as a natural
nervousness in being suddenly confronted with a man of his
attainments. By some extraordinary mental convolution which was
peculiarly Talhamesque, he credited her with a full appreciation
of his genius, a lurking suspicion of his identity, and a
comfortable ignorance of the character of his adventures. Like
the exigent little boy who demanded of the store-keeper two cents
worth of hundreds and thousands&mdash;an infinitesimal candy,
about the size of a pin's head, variously coloured&mdash;Talham
wanted her to pick him out all white.</p>

<p>"It is more than a pleasure to again meet you, Miss Yale," he
began, in his oratorical manner. "There are some events in
life&mdash;some landmarks which rise above the dreary path that
meanders across the plain of eternity&mdash;which stand out..."
He orated on without drawing breath, so to speak. For his imagery
he ransacked forest and field and plain; the vegetable, mineral
and animal kingdoms contributed to the illuminations of his
argument; and the girl stood looking at him wonderingly, a little
frightened, a little&mdash;a very little&mdash; amused, a
little&mdash;more than a little&mdash;bored.</p>

<p>As for Gregory de Costa&mdash;he stood stolidly by, taking no
part in the conversation, twirling his moustache with a
determined and an injured air.</p>

<p>From sheer humanity, Tillizinni set himself the task of
diverting Talham's attention. He felt that his action was
invested with that heroism which one reads about in books of
travel, when a devoted servant sets himself the thankless task of
attracting the attention of a tiger, feeding upon his fellow
creature, to his plump and trembling self.</p>

<p>Tillizinni succeeded, however, in giving the girl an
opportunity for escape; but he drew down upon himself all the
heavy weapons in Talham's arsenal. It was absolutely necessary
for him to seek out Mrs. Smith and pay her that little attention
which is due from a guest to his hostess.</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Smith came to the rescue. She was engaged in
that process which is described in the society columns as "mixing
up her guests." In other words, she was making her slow way
through the crowded little room, giving a nod here, a smile
there, some comment&mdash;generally misplaced&mdash;elsewhere.
She left behind her a trail of bachelors, who had, in
acknowledging her tender inquiries after their wives,
inferentially admitted such possessions.</p>

<p>She found Talham, and from the manner in which she pounced
upon him and led him forth, Tillizinni gathered that the object
of her search had been accomplished.</p>

<p>She was Yvonne Yale's stepmother, being the second wife of the
gallant colonel who had long since passed over to the majority.
Mrs. Smith's poetical way of putting it, was that he had taken
his sword to heaven; but as to this, it is impossible to speak
with authority.</p>

<p>She was one of those women who have a den&mdash;half study,
half boudoir, all roll-top desks and Liberty knick-knacks. She
prided herself upon being a thorough business woman, with a head
for figures, which meant periodical disputes between her and her
broker, which induced piles of tragic correspondence between
herself and her bank, and explained to a very large extent the
domestic cataclysms which were of such frequent occurrence in her
household.</p>

<p>To this den she led Talham, and in the hour he spent with her
he learnt as much of her private history, and much more of her
financial standing, than she knew herself.</p>

<p>He came back and rescued Tillizinni at a period where he was
bored to the point of tears. Talham was very important and very
mysterious. He plunged into the crowd again to find Yvonne Yale.
She may have seen him coming; at any rate Tillizinni saw her look
helplessly round, then face him with a scared look.</p>

<p>"Must you really go, Captain Talham?"</p>

<p>Talham said that he really must go; he said why he had to go,
what he had to do&mdash;the hours of anxious work which lay ahead
of him&mdash;and he hinted of the destinies of people which would
be affected by any longer abstention from their interest. He
spoke of generations yet unborn whose fates were trembling in the
balance; he laid down the well-worn thesis that social
obligations should be subservient to stern economic
realities.</p>

<p>If she thought she had seen the last of him after he had so
unmistakably expressed his intention of retiring, she was
mistaken. She did not know Talham. She felt foolish and resented
the cause. People at whom speeches are made in public invariably
feel foolish.</p>

<p>Yet for all the exhaustive character of his farewell, Talham
remembered on his way home several things he had intended to say,
and was half inclined to go back to say them. All the way to the
hotel he could think of nothing else but her wonderful eyes, her
refinement, her glorious voice.</p>

<p>She was, he then told me, the daughter of an army officer who
had died suddenly a few years before, leaving the second wife and
his daughter the most meagre of incomes. This was the text on
which he delivered an address, dealing with the duty of the state
and the grudging gratitude of the nation. So far as Tillizinni
was able to trace, Yvonne's father was a colonel of infantry, who
had spent some twenty years in various parts of the globe,
missing active service the whole of his life, and finishing up
with the command of a militia depot. Under these circumstances,
Talham's heroics about the "children of England's battle-scarred
defenders" were beside the point.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Yale," he said impressively, "was a wonderful woman, a
splendid woman, a business woman. I can only hope that Yvonne
inherits her splendid qualities."</p>

<p>When Talham ordered his world to his own satisfaction, he was
not above adjusting the laws of progeniture. Mrs. Smith had
sought his advice as to her investments. Talham had fallen for
it.</p>

<p>It is a subtle form of flattery employed by dowagers, who
could not hint at the physical attractions of their middle-aged
and bald-headed admirers, and still retain their self-respect;
and who found in this oblique tribute to their business
capacities an effective and profitable substitute.</p>

<p>But Talham was not middle-aged, and the poison of the flattery
had eaten deeper into his system.</p>

<p>"I am transferring five thousand shares in the Mount Li
Exploration Syndicate," he said.</p>

<p>Tillizinni was not easily moved, but now he gasped.</p>

<p>"The Mount Li?" he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"The Mount Li Exploration Syndicate," said Talham firmly.</p>

<p>"But there isn't such a company," protested the other.</p>

<p>Talham looked at him a little sadly.</p>

<p>"It is one of the things I have overlooked," he said. "One of
the essentials of our communal life. It did not, I confess, occur
to me until that extraordinary woman was discussing such things
as shares and bonds, that I realised in a flash that it was
impossible for me to help her because no such shares stood in my
name. Have not," he asked impressively, "the great events of
history which have transformed the world, been born in a moment's
inspiration? Even as I sat there, in the excellently appointed
study&mdash;I must make a note, by the way, of the furnishing of
that apartment: I should like an office arranged on similar
lines&mdash;the Mount Li Exploration came into existence."</p>

<p>"In other words," said Tillizinni with a helpless smile, "you
created the company in order to give her shares!"</p>

<p>"I created the company," agreed the tall man, gravely.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE CELESTIAL WAY</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a drizzling, miserable night; the streets
were crowded with cars and cabs carrying their occupants to
theatreland. On the drenched pavements the newspaper boys drove a
thriving trade despite the unpromising climatic conditions. Every
news bill dealt with the one subject&mdash;the mysterious murder,
in the heart of London, of an ambassador by some person or
persons unknown.</p>

<p>That it was the Chinese Ambassador added to the general
interest. There was something bizarre and mysterious about the
great empire which appealed to the imagination, and the series of
hypothesis which appeared in the columns of the press assisted to
a remarkable degree in fostering the sense of mystery which
surrounded the tragedy.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a police-station in London that was not at
that moment interrogating some stray Chinaman who had been
brought in to account for his whereabouts on the night of the
murder.</p>

<p>There was not a district, apparently, which could not furnish
a clue.</p>

<p><i>The Evening Megaphone</i>, London's most enterprising
evening journal, secured something of a "beat," for it was the
only paper which was able to throw a light upon the inside
mystery of a vendetta which had apparently culminated in the
Ambassador's assassination.</p>

<p>"We are able," said this journal, in large, leaded type, "to
supply a number of curious and significant facts concerning the
tragedy, which have hitherto been unrecorded elsewhere. Our
representative had the pleasure of a long conversation with Mr.
T'si Soo, a wealthy young Chinese gentleman who has been
domiciled in England for a number of years. Mr. T'si Soo is the
son of the Governor of Chulung, a large and populous district of
China, and is engaged in this city in studying constitutional
law. Mr. Soo&mdash;a fine, handsome-looking young man of
commanding appearance&mdash;received the representative of <i>The
Evening Megaphone</i> in Piccadilly. Fortunately Mr. Soo has a
perfect command of English, and the interpreter which our
representative brought with him was unnecessary.</p>

<p>"'I cannot tell you,' said Mr. Soo, 'how grieved I am at the
death of the Noble Prince who so ably and worthily represented
the Dowager Empress at the court of St. James.</p>

<p>'"The Prince, as you know, was an antiquarian of great note,
but he was also a man of strong political opinions which, I fear,
have not always commended themselves to the majority of my fellow
countrymen.</p>

<p>"'He was by repute a reactionary,' he went on, 'and earned the
animosity of a number of secret societies in China by his efforts
to secure their abolition.'</p>

<p>"'But surely,' our representative pointed out, 'the abolition
of secret societies is not a reactionary movement!'"</p>

<p>"Mr. Soo shook his head.</p>

<p>"'You are now speaking,' he said with a smile, 'from the point
of view of the European. In China we regard anybody as a
reactionary who attempts to alter the position of affairs so that
it corresponds with any period of time in the past. For instance,
there was a time when there were no secret societies; to abolish
them would be regarded, therefore, as a reactionary measure since
it would produce conditions which had once existed. That, again,
I say, is an Eastern point of view.'</p>

<p>"'Do you explain the murder as having been committed by the
emissary of a society,' asked our representative.</p>

<p>"Mr. Soo nodded.</p>

<p>"'I believe there is an association,' he said, 'which had a
special reason for removing the Ambassador.'"</p>

<p>"'It has been suggested,' said our representative, 'that
robbery was the object of the murder, and that a bureau had been
rifled and valuable documents extracted.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Soo was very emphatic in dissociating himself with this
theory.</p>

<p>"'That I do not believe,' he said. 'The people who killed his
Excellency probably travelled all the way from China, and are
now, possibly, on their way back again. They had no other object
but his destruction, and if they stole documents, they were
documents associated with the Prince's campaign to suppress the
societies affected.'</p>

<p>"'It may be remarked,' continued the enterprising journal,
'that such is the abhorrence in which the crime is held by every
Chinaman, that numerous offers of help have come to this paper
from Chinese citizens who desire to assist in the search for the
miscreant. It may be said that the interpreter who accompanied
our representative was one of these. It was through his
instrumentality that the interview with Mr. Soo was secured.</p>

<p>"With extraordinary modesty, he disappeared as soon as the
interview was concluded, and has since not been in this
office."</p>

<p>Whilst the contents bills of <i>The Evening Megaphone</i> were
flaring the question at every street corner: "Was Ambassador
Killed by Secret Society?" Soo himself was interviewing the
interpreter whose enterprise and modesty the journal was at the
moment praising. He was interviewing him in a little room, the
smallest in the suite he occupied, and he was assisted in the
process by three compatriots, who gazed impassively on a
Chinaman, a little less impassive, stretched upon a small iron
bed, his wrists strapped to the bed head, his feet spread-eagled
and strapped to its sides.</p>

<p>Soo sat on a chair smoking his inevitable cigarette, with his
inevitable monocle glued in his eye, watching the man with
interest.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "you shall tell me why you came here, who
sent you, and what you desired."</p>

<p>"Lord," gasped the man on the bed, "I have told you
everything; by my Father's grace I have nothing more to say."</p>

<p>His face was drawn and haggard, beads of perspiration stood
upon his shaven skull, and terror was in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You shall tell me," repeated the other calmly, "who sent you,
why you came, and what you were told to do."</p>

<p>He nodded to the man who sat nonchalantly smoking a pipe by
the side of the captive's bed.</p>

<p>The man leant over and made a half turn of the screw upon a
weird-shaped contrivance which enclosed the prisoner's
fingers.</p>

<p>The man suppressed a shriek with reason, for over him leant a
second Chinaman ready to thrust a gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>"You shall tell me," said Soo monotonously, "why you came, who
sent you here, and your business."</p>

<p>"Lord," whispered the man, "I will tell you all I know."</p>

<p>Soo nodded to the torturer, and he loosened the screw on the
other's finger.</p>

<p>"Give him water" said Soo, and the attendant with the gag put
a cup to the other's lips. He drank greedily.</p>

<p>"Lord, I was sent by my society, which, as your Excellency
knows, is the society of the 'Banner Bearers of Heaven'."</p>

<p>Soo nodded.</p>

<p>"They desired to discover how your Lordship felt in this
matter."</p>

<p>"To whom were you to report?" asked Soo.</p>

<p>The man hesitated, and his interrogator glanced significantly
at the screw in which the captive's hand still rested. It was
enough for the man on the bed. He mentioned a name.</p>

<p>Soo recognised it as the keeper of a Chinese lodging-house in
the East End of London&mdash;a man who was known to him to be the
agent of the Bannermen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION</h2>

<p class="first">YVONNE YALE had spent a tiring and a busy day
shopping with her mother. It was not a relaxation which she often
allowed herself. Mrs. Yale took shopping very seriously, and
would follow a will-o'-the-wisp of a five-shilling bargain
through enticing marshes of other departments where scarcely a
weed grew which was not labelled twenty-five shillings.</p>

<p>After dinner, Mrs. Yale announced the fact that she was dead
tired; she implied the further fact that the exertions of the
day, shared by her daughter, had not affected her, and that the
energy dissipated by Mrs. Yale herself was sufficient for
two.</p>

<p>She went to bed, leaving Yvonne half a dozen letters to
answer&mdash;letters which regretted the inability of Mrs. Yale
to settle an account, but promised "next month," not only to
clear off existing liabilities, but to extend her scope of
patronage.</p>

<p>Yvonne's self-respect led her to tone down the letters, to
make them less optimistic as to the future and less vague as to
the present. She finished her work at half-past eleven, and
signed her mother's name with a flourish, enclosed the letters in
envelopes, and placed them on the hall table ready for
posting.</p>

<p>She made her customary round of the house&mdash;their one
servant was in bed at that hour&mdash;and went to her room
feeling depressed and worried. She could not trace her state of
mind to any particular course, and she told herself that the
reason was purely physical. She undressed in record time, jumped
into bed, switched out the light, and her head had hardly touched
the pillow before she was asleep.</p>

<p>How long she had been sleeping she could not tell, but
something woke her with a start. The room was dark, the only
light being that from the lamp in the street below. She was wide
awake, and her reasoning faculty told her that something must
have occurred&mdash;there must have been some extraordinary noise
to have brought about this condition of wakefulness.</p>

<p>She lay perfectly still&mdash;listening. For a long time she
heard nothing and saw nothing; then for a moment she saw a tiny
streak of bright light in the room.</p>

<p>Before she could touch it her wrist was grasped, and a long,
bony hand closed over her mouth.</p>

<p>"Be silent!" said a voice in her ear. "If you make a noise I
will kill you!" She felt a grip on her throat, and lay paralysed
with terror; she had neither the will nor the ability to
scream.</p>

<p>At last she found her voice.</p>

<p>"Take what you want and go," she said.</p>

<p>"Where do you keep your jewels?" said the man who held her, in
a low voice, The ghost of a smile, in spite of the tragic
situation, dawned on Yvonne's face.</p>

<p>"In the top drawer of my bureau," she said, and might have
added: "such as they are;" but even her sense of humour could not
rise equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>The man muttered some words in a language which she could not
understand; but she gathered that he was addressing the second
man in the room, for two there were undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Then with a sickening sense of danger she realised that the
language was Chinese.</p>

<p>She heard the soft "hush" of the drawer as it opened, she saw
the flash of light as the men swept it over her belongings. Then
the man at the drawer spoke over his shoulder. There was a quick
exchange of words, then:</p>

<p>"Get up!" said the man by her side shortly.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but obey. She rose from her bed and
stood on the floor shaking in every limb. She was thankful for
the darkness which perhaps hid the full extent of her danger.</p>

<p>"You have a bracelet somewhere," said the man who had spoken
first. "It was given to you by young De Costa. Where is it now?"
The girl made no reply. She was dismayed when she realised that
Talham's deception had been discovered, and she felt herself a
guilty party to the deception.</p>

<p>"I have not got it," she said.</p>

<p>"Who has?" The voice was sharp and authoritative.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham has it," she said, before she realised that
she was betraying the strange man. He was nothing to her, yet
even in the moment of her peril, she understood that perhaps she
might be endangering him, and was sorry she had spoken.</p>

<p>There was a little silence, then:</p>

<p>"Put on your clothes!" said the man.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked startled.</p>

<p>"Don't argue. You can dress in the dark. Put on your clothes.
If you can't I'll turn on the light."</p>

<p>She groped for her clothes, thankful to dress in the dark, and
the man walked over to the door.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said as his vice-like grip released her arm,
"any attempt to raise an alarm will result in your immediate
death; there are no men in this house as I know. Captain Talham,
on whom you may unreasonably depend, is quite unconscious of your
present predicament. I am going to take you away from here, and I
swear to you that you shall not be harmed. Are you going to take
my word?"</p>

<p>"There is no alternative," answered the girl.</p>

<p>With trembling hands she drew on her clothes. That she should
be dressing herself in the presence of two Chinamen&mdash;for a
Chinaman the first speaker was, in spite of his perfect
English&mdash;did not strike her at the moment as being so much a
subject for dismay, as to what would happen after she had
dressed.</p>

<p>There was a heavy cloak hanging in the wardrobe of the room.
She drew this on over her other things, and, twisting her hair
into a knot at the top of her head, fixed a hat over what she
knew was a most appalling untidiness.</p>

<p>"It may not be necessary," said the man, "to tell you that any
cry will bring your mother and the maid&mdash;in which case I
shall destroy not only you, but the people you alarm."</p>

<p>He guided her past her mother's door, down the stairs and into
the street.</p>

<p>A little distance from the door was a motor-car. The second
man went out, and at a signal the car drew across the road to the
door of the house.</p>

<p>She was hustled inside, and the two men sprang in after her.
With a jerk the car started upon the most adventurous journey
that Yvonne Yale had ever taken in her short, and until then,
uneventful, career.</p>

<p>Just as the car passed out of sight, a taxi came flying round
the corner, and pulled up at the door of Mrs. Yale's dwelling.
Two men got out and made straight for the door. The first of
these was Tillizinni. He had his hand upon the knocker when he
felt the door yield to his touch, and he pushed it open.</p>

<p>He turned to the pale-faced Talham.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said. "They've been here!" He slipped a revolver
from his hip pocket, and went up the stairs, two at a time, for
Talham had found the switch which controlled the stair light.
Tillizinni guessed that the best bedroom would be at the back,
and that Mrs. Yale would occupy it. He knocked on the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked a muffled voice.</p>

<p>"Open, please!" said Tillizinni. "I am an officer of police,
and I want to see you very urgently."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale came out to the light of the detective's lamp and
presented an unhappy figure.</p>

<p>"Which room does your daughter occupy?" asked Tillizinni.</p>

<p>She recognised Talham with an embarrassed smile.</p>

<p>"My daughter is in the next room." She led the way and knocked
at the door; but again there was no necessity for
knocking&mdash;the door was half open. She entered, followed
without invitation by Tillizinni, who was too anxious as to the
girl's safety to stand upon ceremony.</p>

<p>The bed was empty. He put his hand inside&mdash;it was still
warm. A quick glance round at the open drawers gave evidence of
the visitors' presence.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>"Your daughter has been kidnapped," he said. "You must arouse
your servants. I will send a policeman to you," Into the street
again came the two men, and Tillizinni lifted one of the lamps
from the taxi and examined the roadway. There had been a sharp
shower of rain half an hour previous, and the tracks of the other
car were plainly visible.</p>

<p>He ran along the roadway carrying the lamp, and reached the
thoroughfare which ran to the north and south. There was no
evidence that the car had taken either direction. He crossed the
road, the taxi-cab following in his rear. Yes, here it was
again&mdash;the broad band had gone straight on. They would be
making now for Portland Place.</p>

<p>At this point a policeman appeared, and Tillizinni gave him an
order that set the man running back to the house in Curzon
Street. Then Tillizinni went back to the cab, and the taxi went
straight ahead at full speed, slowing at the point where Portland
Place cut across the route.</p>

<p>The streets were newly washed. Indeed, the great thoroughfare
was at that moment in the hands of the scavengers with their
hoses and their squeegees. There would be no definite track here,
and Tillizinni, after a search, saw sufficient evidence to show
him which direction the car had taken.</p>

<p>At Oxford Circus a policeman had seen it. It had turned
eastward, and had gone straight along Oxford Street in the
direction of Holborn.</p>

<p>"Speed up!" said Tillizinni to the driver. "There's just a
chance they may have a puncture, and we may overtake them."</p>

<p>He rejoined the silent Talham in the cab.</p>

<p>"I'll never forgive myself," said the big man. He sat with his
hands clasped together, and his face set.</p>

<p>"My dear chap, it's not your fault."</p>

<p>Tillizinni laid his hand on the other's shoulder. He had a
genuine affection for this eccentric giant with his irrepressible
oratory and his calm disregard for convention.</p>

<p>"It's a damned bracelet," said Talham bitterly. "All the
wealth and all the secrets of Ts'in are too inadequate
compensation for one moment of misery she may suffer."</p>

<p>Tillizinni made no reply. Like a white light it suddenly
dawned upon him that this man, the last man in the world that he
would have imagined, was smitten with love.</p>

<p>The tense agony in Talham's voice, the attitude of absolute
dejection&mdash;he sat huddled in a corner of the cab&mdash;spoke
eloquently of his agony.</p>

<p>At Holborn Bars a City policeman had seen a car passing
swiftly eastward, and yet again, and farther on at the Mansion
House, a patrolling sergeant was able to direct them toward
Gracechurch Street. They lost the scent at Tower Hill. Two cars
had come along at about the same moment, probably one from
Eastcheap. One had crossed Tower Bridge and gone southward; the
other had continued its way eastward. Unfortunately both had been
of similar make.</p>

<p>Tillizinni was in a dilemma.</p>

<p>"We'll take the east road," he said, after a moment's thought;
"that is the more likely route."</p>

<p>A moment later the cab was following the trail of an empty car
on its way to Harwich to meet the morning boat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE ROOMS BY THE CANAL</h2>

<p class="first">YVONNE YALE had sat in silence during that mad
rush through the City. Once in a frenzy of terror she had half
risen to throw herself from the car. Instantly Soo's hand grasped
her.</p>

<p>"When I tell you I will kill you, I mean it," he said quickly.
"Be quiet, and no harm will come to you. I tell you this, that I
am merely holding you as a hostage for the recovery of the
bangle. If I know your friend, he will not hesitate when he knows
a woman is in danger."</p>

<p>His words reassured her somewhat. She had hardly dared to put
her fears into words.</p>

<p>The car swung round Tower Hill and slowed at the very spot
where Tillizinni was destined to stop ten minutes later; but it
did not go eastward, as Tillizinni had thought, but crossed the
bridge, sped down the slope into Tooley Street, turned again, and
followed the Deptford Road.</p>

<p>It continued until it came to a street which ran parallel with
the north bank of the Surrey Canal, and into this it turned. It
was a street made up of wharf entrances, of old and dilapidated
warehouses and stables.</p>

<p>The car stopped before a low-roofed old building that in its
prosperous days had been part of the wharfage of a stone
merchant. As the car stopped, a door in the wall opened, and Soo
flung away the cigarette which he had smoked during the latter
part of the journey, stepped quickly to the ground, and half
dragged and half carried the fainting girl into the building.
Instantly the car moved on, and the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>They were in complete darkness. There was a musty, unwholesome
smell. The atmosphere of the place filled her with cold
terror.</p>

<p>"This way!" said Soo.</p>

<p>He led her unerringly across the ramshackle shed. At the far
end there was a door which opened and revealed a room lit by two
swinging oil lamps.</p>

<p>It was poorly furnished, with a table and a couple of chairs,
and a fire blazed in a broken grate in one corner. Some attempt
had been made to produce a sense of comfort&mdash;the square of
carpet on the floor, and the plain table-cover had evidently been
newly purchased and still showed their shop creases.</p>

<p>The room was untenanted, and Soo and the girl entered alone.
He closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>She saw now a man in the garb of a Westerner, whose face was
hidden from her by a curious contrivance. This was no less than a
waxen mask, which fitted the upper portion of the face down to
the mouth. So skilfully and cunningly had the colours been
blended, that it was difficult to see where the real ended and
the artificial began. It gave the man a European appearance, and
made him tolerably good-looking.</p>

<p>He locked the door, then turned and faced her.</p>

<p>"You stay here, Miss Yale," he said, "until I secure
satisfaction from your friend. This," he explained, waving his
hand round the apartment, "was once the manager's quarters. It is
fitted with some luxury."</p>

<p>He opened a little door.</p>

<p>"There is a bathroom here," he said, "and you will find
everything you may desire."</p>

<p>"How long do you intend to keep me?" she asked. It was the
first coherent question she had put to him.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That depends entirely upon the willingness of your friend to
give me what I wish," he answered.</p>

<p>"You know you are committing a very grave crime," she said,
"and that you will be punished for this?" She saw a smile gather
on the thin lips.</p>

<p>"I have a much more extensive knowledge of the criminal law of
England than you can be expected to have," he said coolly. "I am
well aware of all the risks I take; but since I am prepared to
take the additional, and to you, perhaps, unthinkable, risk of
losing my life, the minor perils need not be counted."</p>

<p>Without another word he left her. She waited until the sound
of his footsteps had died away; then she made a quick examination
of the two rooms.</p>

<p>From the sitting-room a door opened into a tiny bedroom. It
was scrupulously clean; the sheets were of the finest linen,
pillow of down, and what other furniture occupied the room was in
good taste.</p>

<p>There was one small window, heavily barred, and screened from
the street by an opaque pane of toughened glass. She was to learn
that this looked upon a small wharf, and that no help might be
expected from that direction. There was a little window in the
bathroom which also looked out upon another corner of the
wharf.</p>

<p>The sitting-room depended entirely upon artificial light. So
she thought until she looked up and saw a big skylight in the
room.</p>

<p>She returned to the little bedroom and found, with
considerable satisfaction, that a much needed brush and comb had
been provided. She dressed her hair and washed her face in the
little bathroom.</p>

<p>There was no question of sleeping that night. It encouraged
her, and removed some of her apprehension to find how thoroughly
her abductor had prepared for her arrival. There was a bookshelf,
well stocked with the latest novels, and if the selection had
been a hasty one, it was also a wise one.</p>

<p>She came back to the fire and drew up a chair, for she felt
cold. "What would be the end?" She shivered, and dare not supply
an answer. She got up and walked to the door and listened. There
was no sound outside. It came on to rain, and the pitter-patter
of the drops as they fell upon the tiled roof gave her a sense of
companionship with the outside world. She wondered when her
mother would discover her absence. She was unlikely to make her
discovery before nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>What would she do? Would she call in the police? Would that
extraordinary man, Tillizinni, endeavour to fathom the mystery of
her disappearance? She prayed that he would. And Talham? She
found herself thinking more of Talham than she could have thought
possible. He liked her&mdash;she was sure of it. She was afraid
that the impecunious Captain of Irregular Horse was in love with
her.</p>

<p>She shook her head a little impatiently at the thought. Why
could not the friendship exist about which the philosopher wrote?
Why could not a woman possess a man friend without the
disagreeable element coming into it? Talham was responsible for
her present plight; yet she did not blame him, which was a
curious circumstance for a woman untouched by love. She was
satisfied at least that of all the people who would be affected
by the news of her disappearance, he would feel his
responsibility most poignantly.</p>

<p>She walked up and down the little room. It must have been half
an hour after Soo departed that he came back again. He opened the
door quietly and stepped inside, locking it again after him, and
laid on the table a letter. It was typed, she noticed, and was
addressed to Captain Talham.</p>

<p>"You will sign this," said Soo briefly. He read it over. It
was short and to the point. It ran:</p><br>

<p class="quote"><tt>DEAR CAPTAIN TALHAM,&mdash;</tt></p>

<p class="quote"><tt>I am at present in the hands of some people
who desire you to restore the jade bracelet, which, as you know,
you took from me.</tt></p>

<p class="quote"><tt>Unless you do this within forty-eight hours
either I shall be killed or worse will happen to me. I implore
you, therefore, to hand the bracelet to a messenger who will meet
you tonight at six o'clock in Whitcombe Court, Coventry
Street.</tt></p><br>

<p>She read the letter through, and looked up at the man.</p>

<p>"What guarantee have I," she asked, "if I sign this letter,
and if Captain Talham is in a position to restore the bracelet,
that you will keep your part of the bargain, and will release
me?"</p>

<p>"You have no guarantee at all," he said coolly, "except my
word. But I am in this position, that you must accept my word
without any proof of my bona-fides."</p>

<p>She hesitated before she took the fountain-pen which he
offered her. She read the letter through again.</p>

<p>There was no harm in signing it. She would be no better off by
refusing, and she might easily be worse. She was cool-headed
now.</p>

<p>She signed her name at the foot of the sheet, and handed it to
him.</p>

<p>He took it from her with a little bow.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to write some letters," he said. "You
will find paper in the drawer of the table, and if by any chance
you have any correspondence you would like to clear off in this
uncomfortable period of waiting, this will be an excellent
opportunity."</p>

<p>His tone was polite, he was not even mildly sarcastic. He
wished to convey to her the fact that her detention was a
temporary business, a regrettable expedient which need occasion
her no alarm.</p>

<p>"Suppose Captain Talham refuses to give this up," she said,
"as he may very well do; or suppose he has parted with it and is
not in a position to hand it to you, what happens to me?"</p>

<p>She asked the question calmly, and the man shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I will accept no excuses," he said. "Whatever happens,
subsequent to his refusal, will be most regrettable." With which
sinister remark he left her.</p>

<p>She stood near the door. She thought she heard voices outside.
Quick voices speaking in low tones excitedly, and she wondered
who was the masked man's companion.</p>

<p>She was soon to learn, for the door opened, and Soo came in,
followed by four Chinamen.</p>

<p>"Get your coat on!" he said roughly. "We have got to get out
of here at once."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Get your coat on" he said, ignoring her question. "I haven't
a moment to spare."</p>

<p>All his polish had dropped away.</p>

<p>She had known him for a Chinaman despite his mask, and she
knew there was nothing to be gained by opposing one of the race
which places women on the level of domestic animals. She went
into the bedroom and put on her cloak, again pinned on her hat,
and came out to where the men were waiting.</p>

<p>They were talking eagerly together in Chinese.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you for a little journey by water," said
Soo.</p>

<p>He extinguished the light in the room, and led the way
noiselessly across the empty warehouse to a big door which led
out on to the wharf. It was a sliding door, which moved
noiselessly upon its greased guides.</p>

<p>Soo stepped out first, and the girl followed. Ahead of her she
saw a patch of untidy wharf and the dull gleam of water. He
piloted her to the edge of the wharf and peered down into the
canal; but there was no sign of a boat.</p>

<p>He turned and hissed a savage enquiry to one of his
companions.</p>

<p>The girl's heart beat high, instinct told her that help was on
the way, and the absence of the boat was at least a respite.</p>

<p>"Quick!" said Soo. "Come!"</p>

<p>He caught her by the arm, and she half ran and half walked
back to the building, through the barn-like warehouse, and to the
door through which they had first entered.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, "that any sound you make will bring upon
you consequences which you will have very little time for
regretting."</p>

<p>He pulled back the bolt, and the door swung open noiselessly.
He had his hand upon the girl's arm, and his foot was raised to
step across the threshold when a flood of white light struck him,
and he staggered back.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands!" said a voice.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Tillizinni.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; CAPTAIN TALHAM'S PROGRESS</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a second only Soo stood. He saw the gleam of
two pistol barrels directed at his breast, and then with a sudden
jerk of his arm, he brought the girl into the line of fire.</p>

<p>A second later, he was running with all speed across the
building and through the gate.</p>

<p>He heard fleet footsteps coming after him, and looking over
his shoulder he saw the tall form of Talham silhouetted in the
doorway of the warehouse. He could have shot him then, and was
tempted to take the risk, but thought better of it. A shot would
arouse the neighbourhood, would set whistles blowing, and might
perhaps dissipate his last chance of escape.</p>

<p>He could trust his men to preserve his secret. He sped without
hesitation to the end of the wharf. The boat was still away. He
understood now why it had not put in an appearance. He heard a
whistle blow, and cursed himself for his failure to make use of
an opportunity of killing Talham which the gods had put into his
hands.</p>

<p>The place was surrounded&mdash;he guessed that. He guessed it
just as soon as he understood the significance of the boat's
absence. There was no time to hesitate, without a pause he leapt
from the edge of the wharf into the dark and noisome waters of
the canal. He came to the surface for a moment to breathe, and
cast his eyes back to the bank.</p>

<p>Innumerable beams of light were searching the water. The
police had recently been equipped with a new truncheon torch.</p>

<p>He could swim under water like a fish, and he did not come up
again until the black hulk of a moored barge offered protection
from the prying eyes of the police.</p>

<p>"He's gone, I'm afraid!" said Tillizinni with an expression of
vexation. "I'd like to have seen his face."</p>

<p>"But didn't you see it?" asked Talham in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I saw an ingenious mask," said the other.</p>

<p>"I thought it was curious," said Talham, "that a European
could run as that man ran. He had that curious sideways waddle
which only the Chinks have."</p>

<p>They were talking in the little warehouse, half filled with
police now, and bright with light. Four Chinamen sat on the
ground handcuffed together and philosophical.</p>

<p>"I could have wished to capture the car," said Tillizinni. "I
might then have found its owner. Yet"&mdash;he turned a dazzling
smile upon the girl&mdash;"we have succeeded in doing what we set
out to accomplish."</p>

<p>She looked very white and shaky, and Talham was no less
pale.</p>

<p>"I am grateful this has turned out so well for me," she said
softly.</p>

<p>Tillizinni explained how they had taken the wrong road, and
how by great good fortune they had come upon the car they were
chasing drawn up at a coffee stall, where the chauffeur was
taking an early morning breakfast. They had got back to Tower
Bridge, and picked up the trail with no difficulty, save that
none had seen the car turn into the little street which runs by
the side of the canal. Here, however, the two men had to do some
quick guessing, and once in the little cul-de-sac, the hiding
place had easily been located.</p>

<p>Exactly how, he did not explain, but two hours later he was
comparing the cigarette end which he had picked up outside of the
warehouse with one Talham had found in Mr. de Costa's study.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether this is enough to issue a warrant on,"
he said. "It would be quite sufficient for the detective in
fiction"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"but unfortunately police
magistrates have little imagination and no romance, and require
something more substantial in the shape of evidence than the
characteristics of Chinese tobacco."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">An ordinary man would have waited a day or two
before he attempted to renew acquaintance with a woman whose
charms had created so profound an impression upon him, and
moreover, who had been responsible for so much mental suffering
on the part of the woman whom he loved. But Talham was no
ordinary man. He called the next day, and having no more idea of
social conventions than a cow has of painting on silk, he chose a
quarter to one in the afternoon as the hour.</p>

<p>Mercifully, both Mrs. Yale and her daughter were indulging in
the luxury of a day's shopping, and Talham came back to Adelphi
Terrace crestfallen, and sat moodily at the lunch table watching
his host eat. Tillizinni expostulated with him.</p>

<p>"It was absurd to call at an hour like that," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought they might ask me to lunch," said Talham
naïvely.</p>

<p>He refused to eat anything for a little while, and then his
healthy appetite overcame his desire for starving to death, with
the result that the detective had to wait another three-quarters
of an hour at the table whilst he fed, which annoyed him
intensely.</p>

<p>"Do you think if I called this afternoon&mdash;" he asked
tentatively.</p>

<p>"You'll make yourself a nuisance. Moreover," Tillizinni said
as a bright idea struck him, "Miss Yale will not unnaturally
think that we regard our rescue of her as giving us the right of
entrance into the house at all inconvenient hours of the day and
night."</p>

<p>His face fell, and he made no attempt to put his threat of
calling into execution. Indeed, during the next few days he was
so busy with his preparation for departure, that Tillizinni hoped
that his infatuation had died a natural death. When, later, he
mentioned the material prospects of the Yales, Tillizinni was
sufficiently indiscreet as to suggest that they might be well
left to work out their own salvation.</p>

<p>"It is to such unsympathetic pharisaical souls as yours," he
said, amongst other things, "that we owe the shocking and cynical
disregard for infant life in England, the deterioration of the
national physique, the growth of anti-militist in France."</p>

<p>On the fourth day after the abduction, Talham called. At four
o'clock in the afternoon he issued from his room at the Pall Mall
Palace Hotel arrayed like a modern Solomon in all his glory. From
the tips of his enamelled American shoes, to the crown of his
glossy Bond Street hat, he was the man about town.</p>

<p>In an hour and a half, considerably agitated, he called upon
Tillizinni. Whatever had happened he did not say, but he directed
the vials of his wrath upon two gentlemen who had had the
singular bad taste to be present, and to monopolise much of the
lady's time during Talham's visit.</p>

<p>Talham would have sent them out, but they had apparently
called to take the girl out to a "five o'clock."</p>

<p>"It was impossible to say what I wanted to say," he said
moodily, striding up and down the apartment, "so I hit upon a
ruse."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What was the ruse?" asked Tillizinni; but the other seemed
disinclined to go on.</p>

<p>"In love as in war," he began at last, "all means are
justified. Remembering the seriousness of the issue, remembering
the tremendous effect which the decision one way or the other
might produce upon posterity, and remembering, too, that in love
as in war, as I say, we come against the elementary passions
which are superior to the trivial conventions of modern
life&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tillizinni waited, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"My suggestion to the two young men&mdash;one, as I have told
you, was De Costa, and the other a Mr. William Dixon, of
forty-three, Claremont Gardens, S.W.," he added imposingly and
significantly, "my suggestion was, I contend, perfectly
pardonable and quite admissible within the rules of war. It was
that I had a friend who in a moment of exuberation had struck a
policeman."</p>

<p>Tillizinni gasped.</p>

<p>"As a result of that unlawful act, my friend had been arrested
and taken to Bow Street police station, the police being ignorant
as to his identity. I myself was a stranger in the country; I had
not sufficient influence to secure his release. Would these
gentlemen of their charity drive to Bow Street and vouch for the
respectability of my unfortunate friend?"</p>

<p>He said all this hesitatingly, yet hurriedly; there were long
pauses between each sentence. Talham was obviously ill at
ease.</p>

<p>"And who," Tillizinni asked slowly, "might this unfortunate
friend of yours be?"</p>

<p>Talham looked at the ceiling thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If by any chance," he said, "I have overstepped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not me!" cried the detective in horror. "You didn't say it
was me?"</p>

<p>Talham nodded silently.</p>

<p>"I will only say this in extenuation," he said with that
seriousness which made all his actions so real and plausible:
"that I took particular care to impress upon them that you were
perfectly sober."</p>

<p>Tillizinni fell back in the chair helplessly, with silent
laughter.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked at last. "Having resigned myself to the loss
of what little character I possessed, I should like to know what
these two young people did?"</p>

<p>"I must confess," said Talham, "that they were very decent.
They went at once, took a taxi-cab, and drove straight away to
the police station. Not finding you there, and ascertaining by
telephone that you were not at Adelphi Terrace, they came back.
In the meantime I had thrown myself upon the mercy of
Yvonne."</p>

<p>"Did you call her Yvonne?" Tillizinni asked.</p>

<p>"I called her Yvonne," said Talham gravely, "because that is
her name. I put before her as much of my prospects as I deemed it
expedient to reveal. I gave her a brief resume of my views of
love and matrimony and the duty which we owe to the future. I
told her in the terms which I have discovered are usual
"&mdash;(It was afterwards discovered that Talham had sent out a
comprehensive commission to the nearest bookstall for all the
latest novels in which love dominated)&mdash;"that I loved her,
and would endeavour by a life-long service, by a devotion which
should be unique in the history of the world, to make her life an
increasing joy and pleasure."</p>

<p>He was walking up and down all the time he spoke. He stopped
in front of the window and stared out. Thunder clouds were
banking up over South London, and on the murky horizon there was
the flicker of lightning.</p>

<p>"That is as it should be," he said.</p>

<p>Talham was approving of the elements; it was not the first
time he had suggested that the incidence of natural phenomena
were directed by an all-wise Providence to coincide with his
moods.</p>

<p>"She could not agree," he said. "She was startled, I thought
at first that she was angry; but possibly I am doing her an
injustice."</p>

<p>"What of the young men?"</p>

<p>"They returned as I was going," said Talham. He swung round on
Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"I have their cards and their addresses; that is what I wish
to see you about. If you are my friend, you will call on them
to-morrow and arrange a meeting."</p>

<p>The detective had no words; he simply arose from the chair
with his mouth open.</p>

<p>"Arrange a meeting!" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Arrange a meeting," said Talham. "They used language to me
which I will not permit any man to use. Moreover, what they said
was in the presence of my future wife."</p>

<p>"But she refused you!"</p>

<p>"My future wife," repeated Talham in such a tone of decision
as left no room for argument.</p>

<p>"But what do you mean by a meeting? You don't for one moment
imagine that these people will fight a duel?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," said the other. "I think that Hyde
Park in the early hours of the morning would be an admirable
rendezvous. You may leave to them the choice of weapons. I know
very little about these fancy small swords which duellists
favour, but if they will be kind enough to choose cavalry swords,
I should be glad. I will fight them with Chinese knives, or, of
course, with rapiers, if they prefer those weapons. I have no
doubt that I shall make myself proficient in a few hours. As
honourable men, they will not, of course, desire to take me at a
disadvantage."</p>

<p>He discussed the punctilio of duelling at some length. There
was no use in arguing with him.</p>

<p>They spent the evening together, Tillizinni examining the
documents which had been removed from the Chinese Embassy, and
Talham assisting him.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course," the detective explained, "that if
I come upon any information which is likely to be of service to
you in your search for your tomb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not my tomb," corrected Talham.</p>

<p>"Well, the Emperor's tomb," said the other. "I cannot allow
you to see it."</p>

<p>"You will find nothing," said Talham with confidence. "Every
scrap referring to the Tomb of the First Emperor was in the
stolen docket."</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past ten when his servant brought
Tillizinni a card. The detective read it and passed it to the
other. It was inscribed:</p><br>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">Raymond de Costa<br>
&amp;<br> Gregory de Costa.</p><br>

<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Show them up!" said Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Talham's face brightened up.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" he began, but did not finish his sentence.
It might have been that he imagined that the visit would
symbolise an act of self-abnegation of which young De Costa was
incapable.</p>

<p>All his doubts were disposed of a few minutes later when the
sulky young man, looking stouter and more unpleasant than ever,
came into the room and introduced his father.</p>

<p>De Costa bowed ceremoniously to both men.</p>

<p>"This is my father," said young De Costa.</p>

<p>Something made Tillizinni look at Talham. He had the faintest
of smiles upon his lips, as at some amusing recollection.</p>

<p>"You know my father, I think," said young De Costa.</p>

<p>"I haven't that pleasure," replied Talham.</p>

<p>The older man favoured him with a malicious little grin.</p>

<p>"I think we have done business together,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Talham."</p>

<p>"Is it Talham?" asked the other innocently. "I seem to
remember another name. May I sit down?" Tillizinni apologised,
and pushed forward two chairs, and the men seated themselves.
They were both in evening dress; in De Costa senior's shirt front
blazed a diamond even larger than that which his son affected on
such occasions.</p>

<p>"I may recall to you, Mr. Talham"&mdash;there was an offensive
little pause before the name&mdash;"that I am engaged in the
shipping trade. I sometimes send cargoes to South
America"&mdash;he smiled again "and sometimes to China."</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," said Talham. "I think shipping is
one of the most fascinating branches of commercial
endeavour."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so," said the old De Costa.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he continued, "I find it necessary to engage a
super-cargo to carry out the more delicate and intricate
negotiations which are sometimes associated with the transference
of the goods shipped."</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"I quite understand the functions of the supercargo," he
said.</p>

<p>"Some years ago," the old man went on reminiscently, "I had to
send rather an important cargo to one of the islands of the West
Pacific." He shrugged his shoulders and waved his hands in one
motion. "I cannot recall exactly where the cargo was to land, or
what it consisted of; but I have a most vivid recollection of a
gentleman who called upon me at my office in Little Saville
Street on one occasion. And I also remember having engaged him to
carry out certain duties. In so engaging him it was necessary to
take him into my confidence, to an extent"&mdash;he smiled. "For
instance, I had to explain that he would pick up a collier at a
certain point at sea, and that he would land bales of hardware in
a very difficult place."</p>

<p>"In the Philippines," said Talham cheerily. "And it was not
hardware, but rifles, if I remember rightly."</p>

<p>"As to that," the other hastened to say, "I have no distinct
recollection. At any rate there was an accident: my coal was
stolen, my collier, which I specially chartered to meet my ship,
was met by another. The coal was stolen, I repeat. Later my ship
was held up by a make-believe warship, and the merchandise was
removed, against the captain's wish. That
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Talham, was piracy."</p>

<p>"It was piracy," admitted Talham pleasantly. "A gross act of
piracy, undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"I am glad you agree," said De Costa.</p>

<p>"What would you call the act of running guns for half-breed
Philippians?" asked Captain Talham.</p>

<p>The old man flushed. It was not the accusation which annoyed
him; it was that horrid word "half-breed."</p>

<p>"That would not be piracy," continued Talham drily. "That
would be just an act contrary to every civilised law. Yes," he
said, "I am Talham. I don't need to hide it from you. What I
really called myself in those days does not matter. I took your
coal; I took your rifles. The rifles you were sending to niggers
to enable them to shoot white men."</p>

<p>"Mr. Talham!" said the old man, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>"The rifles you were sending to niggers, I repeat," said
Talham, "so that they might snipe the solitary pickets of the
United States army&mdash;so that they might murder and terrorise
the helpless and unarmed islanders. You're not a fool&mdash;you
know the breed of the Puljanes. Why, you're one yourself!"</p>

<p>Talham in his insolence was a most offensive man. Tillizinni
had never seen him in this mood except twice during the time he
knew him.</p>

<p>Talham held very strong views regarding the colour question.
With him a man was either black or white; he recognised no
intermediary stage. Once let him depart from the pure white
stock, and in Talham's eyes he might as well be coal-black. On
this point he was a fanatic.</p>

<p>It was curious to see the old man wilt under the tall man's
vitriolic tongue. It was as though he insensibly did homage in
that moment to the dominant race. Despite his vast riches,
despite his undoubted influence, he was a native in the presence
of a white man.</p>

<p>Under the spell of Talham's mastery he cringed. Not so the
son. He was one generation nearer whiteness. With a horrible
noise which was half a scream and half a strangled cry of hatred,
he leapt at the other.</p>

<p>Talham half turned. His hand went out rigidly. It seemed to
Tillizinni that the young man did not check in his flight, but
rather continued it, describing a curve about the spot where
Talham stood, until he pulled up with a crash against the
opposite wall. He went down in a heap.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" said Talham&mdash;but he was addressing
Tillizinni.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE MESSAGE OF THE DEAD</h2>

<p class="first">IT was an embarrassing situation for
Tillizinni.</p>

<p>He saw the older man's eyes fixed on him accusingly as the
youth, dazed and white, picked himself up from the floor. Yet the
detective said nothing.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me, Signor Tillizinni," said De Costa,
senior. He spoke with deliberation, and his tone was full of
menace. "Scotland Yard shall know that you consort with this
adventurer, who, in addition to being a pirate, is also a common
thief."</p>

<p>Tillizinni checked a movement of his impulsive friend with a
gesture.</p>

<p>"A common thief?" he repeated pleasantly.</p>

<p>"A common thief&mdash;a burglar&mdash;who ransacked my house a
fortnight ago," said De Costa. "Who cut a way through a door, and
found&mdash;nothing!" He bared his teeth in a triumphant
smile.</p>

<p>"Here!" He thrust his hand into the inside pocket of his coat
and pulled out a short-bladed knife, protected by a leather
sheath.</p>

<p>"The burglar left this behind on a desk he had forced," he
said. "You will observe, Ned, that your initials are on the
blade&mdash;N.T.&mdash;Ned Talham!"</p>

<p>Tillizinni smiled as the old man replaced the knife and made
for the door.</p>

<p>"Yet another fact to lay before Scotland Yard, "he said
pleasantly, as he opened the door for the angry pair." N.T. also
stands for Nicolò Tillizinni."</p>

<p>The son had reached the landing, and De Costa was passing
through the doorway to follow the waiting servant. At
Tillizinni's words he turned.</p>

<p>"You?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tillizinni bowed.</p>

<p>"I came searching for a certain document stolen from the
Chinese Embassy," he said. "Would you allow your son to wait in
another room whilst I tell you something?" De Costa paused
irresolutely.</p>

<p>He walked to the door.</p>

<p>"You may wait downstairs for me," he said.</p>

<p>He came back and closed the door after him. Tillizinni
strolled to the other end of the room, his hands in his pockets,
his dark brow puckered in a thoughtful frown. He strolled back to
meet De Costa.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said, but the old man made no
move.</p>

<p>"As I said, I went to your house&mdash;burgled it if you
will&mdash;it is one of the crimes which I permit myself. I came
to seek a certain dossier containing a document which I had every
reason to believe was in your possession."</p>

<p>"You found nothing? said the old man steadily.</p>

<p>"I found nothing," agreed Tillizinni. "At any rate, I did not
find that which I set forth to find. What I did discover,
however, was rather interesting. It was that you, had at least
three visitors on that night, and that they had all been
Chinamen, and that one, and the most important of these"&mdash;he
spoke slowly&mdash; "was quite in ignorance as to the visit of
the others."</p>

<p>Not a muscle of the old man's face moved, "Go on," he
said.</p>

<p>Tillizinni had picked up a fountain pen from the desk and was
pointing his remarks with little flourishes which were peculiarly
his.</p>

<p>"Well," he began, and stopped with an exclamation of apology,
for from the waving fountain-pen a few drops had fallen upon the
white shirt-front of the visitor.</p>

<p>He stepped forward impulsively with his handkerchief and wiped
them clean.</p>

<p>De Costa was in some doubt as to whether he should reject such
civility. Then Tillizinni resumed.</p>

<p>"The presence of the two men was rather a mystery. I found no
indication that they had stayed any time, and I gathered by the
fact that you had written very elaborate directions, that they
had come to consult you as to the best method of getting out of
England."</p>

<p>Still the man made no sign.</p>

<p>"You had carefully written&mdash;possibly on two half-sheets
of notepaper, since I found the corresponding halves with the
tell-tale address upon them in the wastepaper basket&mdash;a
string of names of places written in English and blotted on a
fairly clean pad. Since those names occur twice I gathered there
was some slight difference between them, and I gather that you
had advised them to take different routes.</p>

<p>"One went by way of Ostend to Petrograd, Moscow, and Tomsk,
and via the Trans-Siberian Railway; the other was apparently
advised to leave by way of Liverpool on a Chinese cargo boat
which sailed this morning. This much I gathered from the fact
that you had given him the name of an agent in Liverpool to whom
he could apply. That also you very indiscreetly blotted."</p>

<p>The old man's face was livid now.</p>

<p>"And what do you make of all this?" he asked with a show of
bravado.</p>

<p>"As far as I can understand," said Tillizinni, "two men in
your pay are responsible for the abstraction of a very important
document from the Chinese Embassy. Piecing the story together I
understand that you are in agreement with Soo, a scholarly
gentleman and a mutual acquaintance."</p>

<p>He bowed ironically.</p>

<p>"At the last moment, or possibly long before the last moment,
you feared that Soo would play you false, and went behind his
back to bribe two hirelings to deliver what was found to you.
Possibly you did not see the workings of the Chinese mind, nor
foresee the tragedy which must inevitably occur when one member
of the party engaged to rob the ambassador happens to be the
brother of your defrauded partner."</p>

<p>"The brother!"</p>

<p>De Costa was shocked, he was terrified they read that in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"The brother," he repeated, "of Ts'i Soo was the unfortunate
man who was found doubled up in the bureau of the ambassador's
study. As I say, you probably did not foresee this unpleasant
ending to the adventure, and went into it with no more idea than
of being party to a minor felony. Your men killed the Chinaman
who called himself 'Star above the Yamen' because they saw no
other way of silencing him. They brought the documents straight
on to you."</p>

<p>"That is a lie!" said De Costa.</p>

<p>"They brought the documents to you," repeated Tillizinni, "and
they have never left you day or night."</p>

<p>He took a step closer to De Costa, and the old man shrunk
back. His hands went up to his right breast.</p>

<p>"They are probably in an inside pocket of your waistcoat,"
said Tillizinni. "May I see?"</p>

<p>He reached out his hand, but before he could touch him the old
man turned with a snarl, dashed open the door, and swung himself
through it, descending the steps at a pace which did credit to
his age, but was disastrous to his dignity.</p>

<p>Tillizinni laughed. He sat back in his chair and laughed that
silent chuckle of his for fully three minutes.</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;why," protested Talham, "why not have taken the
papers whilst you could? For heaven's sake, why did you let him
go?"</p>

<p>Tillizinni shook his head.</p>

<p>"I could not take the document from him," he said with a
smile, "because I had already taken it when I was wiping his
shirt front," and he laid on the table a thin folded sheet
closely written in Chinese characters.</p>

<p>Very slowly Talham read:</p><br>

<p class="quote">"Chu, Mi, Tsan Sui, and Tulm...... together as
brothers...... swearing...... This we say, being mechanical men
from divers provinces brought together, because of our great
skill, to the shadow of the Emperor's house (here was something
indecipherable) that we shall finish the tomb, fitting bronze

made.</p><br>

<p class="quote">"One of us to the other said&mdash;if the
Emperor be buried and with him mighty treasures, how easy will it
be for us&mdash;we shall know all the mechanical secrets of this

treasure buried, to take it away with us; and we agreed. So we
have set this down for the guidance of our sons if we be dead

shall fall at the entrance, and may not be lifted except with the
strength of fifty bullocks&mdash;and the...... be taken away.</p>

<p class="quote">"We have made a pit so large as the door itself,

shall find at either side of the entrance, between two great

fell before, but never to be raised, save with the strength of
fifty bullocks.</p>

<p class="quote">"And inside is a large cave with two silver

the manuscript is indecipherable).</p>

<p class="quote">"If you shall pull upon the silver lamp which is

either side shall be cast the ornaments of gold and silver, and
the jewels which he wore in his lifetime, and the jewels also of
his wives and of his blood relations.</p>

<p class="quote">"Let our memories be blessed by our children,
that we have brought fortune to them, and made them richer than
kings, and given them dominions greater than the provinces of the
barbarians."</p><br>

<p>Talham read these documents through twice, scribbling in his
angular writing a rough translation the first time and amending
as he read it again.</p>

<p>He looked up at the detective.</p>

<p>Tillizinni had been infected with something of the fever which
possessed the other.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" asked Talham.</p>

<p>"I think it is a wonderful discovery," said Tillizinni, and he
meant it, for that document to him was as precious as anything
which Talham might secure from the vaults beneath Mount Li.</p>

<p>It was written on paper of extraordinary texture. Indeed, it
was as thin as that quality which is known as "Indian paper"
to-day.</p>

<p>Very few of the characters had been damaged, and such
obliterations as there were, were caused by the folds in the
document.</p>

<p>Talham looked up with a puzzled frown,</p>

<p>"Still, this tells us nothing as to the locality of the
mountain?" he said.</p>

<p>Tillizinni shook his head.</p>

<p>"Curiously, I have never thought that the locality was ever
likely to be established," he said. "Probably the Chinese
ambassador referred to the locality of the tomb rather than the
exact geographical position of the mountain.</p>

<p>"I have been looking through some books in the British
Museum," he said, "and it appears that the Emperor had expressed
a desire to be buried in the land of his birth. As you knew, he
was practically a usurper of the Chinese throne. The Empire as we
know it to-day had no existence until he brought the provinces
together into a united whole. He was a sort of prehistoric
Bismarck."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, too," said Talham. "The old kingdom
of Ts'in was situated in a rough circle, of which the town of Hoo
Sin is the centre. It is obviously not the Mount Li in the
neighbourhood of Pekin."</p>

<p>There was a long silence; which Talham broke.</p>

<p>"Delay," he said, "is repugnant to the active mind; action is
the essence of vitality. Seconds, strenuously saved at one end,
are lessened hours of peace at the other."</p>

<p>"When you have finished delivering these excellent maxims,"
said Tillizinni with a faint smile, "perhaps you will come to the
point."</p>

<p>"My point is this," said Talham shortly; "we must go along and
find that tomb before somebody else discovers it. You see, we
have the information which was denied to De Costa and to his
confederates&mdash;the information contained in the jade
bracelet."</p>

<p>"We?" said Tillizinni, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"We," said Talham calmly. "You have been so kind to me, and
have offered me such hospitality, even going so far to advance me
the small sums which were necessary to my sustenance. No, no," he
went on, for Tillizinni would have hushed him down, "these
matters, material as they are, show the tendencies of a soul. I
once thought," he mused, but Tillizinni cut him short.</p>

<p>The orations of Captain Talham were inclined to err on the
side of longevity, and Tillizinni regarded himself as more or
less ephemeral.</p>

<p>Besides which, Tillizinni had work to do, a description of Soo
had been circulated up and down the country, and every haunt
which might shelter him had been systematically searched. The
ports were being watched, and no Chinaman went on board an
ocean-going liner without first passing the strict scrutiny of
detectives who were watching the outgoing steamers. In spite of
this fact no trace of the man could be found.</p>

<p>Neither Talham nor Tillizinni agreed with the theory that he
had been drowned in his attempt to escape, and Talham, who
invariably held stronger views than most men, and expressed them
with greater strength, even went so far as to accompany the
dragging parties on the banks of the canal, and at intervals to
deliver little speeches on the futility of vain effort&mdash;an
embarrassing situation from which Tillizinni delivered the
searchers by the exercise of his tact.</p>

<p>By Tillizinni's instructions, the house in Curzon Street was
watched day and night. He had no illusions, he knew full well
that if Soo could strike a blow at Talham through the girl, he
would do so.</p>

<p>The newspapers had arisen to the occasion and had referred
exultantly to the "bottling up" of the fugitive Chinaman. It was
a little phrase coined in a hurried moment which caught the fancy
of the great public; the "bottling up" of England to hold an
escaping murderer, appealed to the popular imagination.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the greatest difficulty had been found in
identifying Soo with any known person in China. The Governor of
Tai-pan, with whom the Chinaman claimed relationship, had
telegraphed to his Government that his only son was pursuing his
studies in Nanking, and could not possibly be the wanted man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though the Chinese Government had promised every
assistance to bring the culprit to justice, and to thoroughly
punish him if he reached Chinese territory, Tillizinni knew that
it was for China that the man would make.</p>

<p>Talham had gone home, and the precious document had been
locked in Tillizinni's safe, and he himself was preparing for a
greatly-needed night's rest, when his sleepy servant brought a
plain envelope addressed to the detective.</p>

<p>"How did this come?" asked Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"By a little boy, sir," said the man.</p>

<p>Tillizinni held the envelope to the light. It showed nothing
more sinister than a folded sheet of paper, and he slit it open.
There were only a few words, but those words were particularly
interesting.</p>

<p>The letter was without superscription, and ran:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"Some day I will 'bottle up' somebody who is
very precious to your friend, and you may be sure that when she
is once again in my hands, nothing you can do will save
her."</p><br>

<p>Tillizinni re-read the letter and sent for the messenger.</p>

<p>The boy could tell him little, except that a man had given the
letter to him to deliver, and since the description of that man
did not in any way tally with the description of Soo, Tillizinni
gathered that the messenger originally sent, had chosen a deputy,
for reasons of his own.</p>

<p>He sent the boy away, read the letter for the third time, and
after telephoning to assure himself that the guards he had fixed
in Curzon Street were at their posts, he went to bed and slept as
soundly as any man could sleep who had not closed his eyes in
slumber for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when his servant brought him in his
chocolate and toast. With it came one of the few letters which
were addressed personally to him. It was from Yvonne Yale, a
charming little note of thanks for the service he had rendered,
but she made no mention of Talham.</p>

<p>Tillizinni smiled.</p>

<p>Now that the excitement had passed, and the exhilaration of
the rescue subsided, he imagined that the girl might very
properly blame Talham for the part he had played. In this he was
wrong, as he was to discover.</p>

<p>He spent the whole of the day at Scotland Yard in the
laboratory, making experiments to demonstrate the value of a new
finger-print method.</p>

<p>He did not see Talham that night, nor the next day either, for
the matter of that, but on the third day following the discovery
of the paper, and the fourth after the abduction of the girl,
Talham came to see him in a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>"Soo is in London," he said briefly, and seemed pleased with
himself that he could report information to the encyclopaedia
detective.</p>

<p>Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"I know that," he said.</p>

<p>"What is more," said Talham, "I've been followed about for the
last two days by a couple of men. I tried to lure them into a
dark court last night to beat them up."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad you didn't," said Tillizinni drily, "because
those were eminently respectable members of the Metropolitan
Police, whom I have put on to protect you from whatever harm
might be coming to you."</p>

<p>Talham looked a little crestfallen. He had come prepared to
accept a little praise from the other for his acumen and his
powers of perception.</p>

<p>"But how do you know that Soo is in London?" asked
Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"Because I saw him," said the calm Talham, and secured his
sensation.</p>

<p>Tillizinni raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Saw him and did not arrest him?"</p>

<p>"It was rather difficult," explained Talham. "I was on the
platform of a tube station at Piccadilly Circus just as the train
was moving out. In a rear carriage as it went past me, gathering
speed at every second, I saw a man whom I'll swear was Soo, with
a perfectly fitting beard. I know him, moreover, by the scar
above his left eye. Just as he came abreast of me he raised his
eyes, and then I was sure. I couldn't stop the train&mdash;which
reminds me," he said portentously, "that I must report the
station-master and several of the employees on the Underground
Railway for marked insolence."</p>

<p>Tillizinni gathered that Talham had made himself
objectionable, and sympathised with the station officials.</p>

<p>"I couldn't telephone through to the next station, and if I
had, I probably should not have got through in time," he said,
"and if I got through&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyway, you didn't telephone at all," said Tillizinni with a
smile, "and he alighted at the next station, and
disappeared."</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"I have known he's been in London for some days," said
Tillizinni. "As a matter of fact, there is nothing very clever in
finding that out, because I received a note which was
unmistakably from him. Scotland Yard can do no more than they are
doing, and unless he leaves in an aeroplane, and we have made
provision for that contingency, I don't see how he is to escape
from England."</p>

<p>Tillizinni had applied for leave, he told the other, and was
prepared to leave for China the following week. If he had
expected Talham to be excited or elated or in any way pleasantly
surprised, he was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p>Talham had taken it for granted that Tillizinni, despite all
his multifarious interests, would grasp the opportunity to visit
the Celestial Kingdom and enjoy the adventure which his
enterprise promised.</p>

<p>"Everything, of course, depends upon what happens to Soo," the
detective went on. "I can't leave if he's arrested, I can't leave
if he's not arrested. Our only hope for my holiday is that Soo,
in some mysterious fashion which is peculiarly his, makes his
escape from this country."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the detective did not leave that week nor
the next, nor that which followed.</p>

<p>On the Saturday of the third week came a letter; it bore the
postmark of Madison Square Gardens post-office, and was in the
handwriting of Soo. It was brief, and reiterated the threat which
he had uttered in his shorter epistle, but more specifically, in
language which need not be repeated nor transcribed.</p>

<p>Tillizinni locked it away with the other documents affecting
the case and prepared for his departure.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">There was one man as interested in the movement
of Soo as Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Old Raymond de Costa, a bitter and hateful man, and also a
fearful man. He dreaded the law on the one side, and the
vengeance of Soo on the other, if it ever came out that it was he
who had played him false.</p>

<p>The news published in the morning papers that Soo had reached
America came as a great relief to the old man it freed him to
pursue his private feud against Tillizinni and his insufferable
friend.</p>

<p>He discovered the loss of the document for which he had
sacrificed so much, yet did not associate the detective with the
theft until his valet drew attention to the ink-spot on the dress
shirt which came back from the laundry.</p>

<p>"You've had some ink on your shirt, sir," said the man.</p>

<p>With a scowl De Costa remembered the circumstances under which
it had been acquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, throw it away," he said shortly.</p>

<p>The man folded up the garment with a little smile.</p>

<p>De Costa detected it, and turned on him the vials of his
vitriolic wrath.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir," said the man apologetically. "I wasn't
smiling at the shirt, I was just remembering how a gentleman I
once valeted was robbed of fifty pounds."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear about it," growled the old man.</p>

<p>Then curiosity got the better of him.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're aching to tell me," he said ungraciously.
"How was it?"</p>

<p>"It happened in the West End," said the valet. "A man was
writing a note with a fountain-pen in the vestibule of one of the
cafés. He happened to shake it, and some drops fell on the
gentleman's shirt. The gentleman who did it was very sorry and
wiped it off with his own silk handkerchief, but my master lost a
bundle of notes from the inside pocket of his coat whilst the
wiping process was going on."</p>

<p>As he proceeded, De Costa's face was a study. He realised now
how the paper came to be lost.</p>

<p>So Tillizinni had the paper, and had, too, evidence as to his
complicity in the Embassy robbery! But had he? Nobody would be
able to identify the documents which were stolen. It had been
stated so at the inquest.</p>

<p>No, there would be no evidence to convict the respectable
Raymond de Costa in that, or he would have been arrested by now.
Besides, he was a known antiquarian and a collector of Chinese
objects, art, and literature. There would be every excuse for his
being in possession of such a thing. He had the transcription,
and the document had no value now save to the antiquarian.</p>

<p>He must act at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; CAPTAIN TALHAM PROPOSES</h2>

<p class="first">TALHAM had proposed to Yvonne Yale. It had
followed many meetings, many calls at the house in Upper Curzon
Street, many lengthy orations on the future of applied mechanics
delivered to Mrs. Yale, who took what might be termed a
shareholder's interest in such matters, and the end of it was
that Talham, after a sleepless night, called upon the Yales at
five o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>This statement is made in all seriousness, because it is true.
At this outrageous hour Captain Talham, a tall, handsome figure
of a man, tanned and debonair, knocked at the door of the Yale
ménage.</p>

<p>He had knocked half a dozen times before the shuffling of
slippered feet told him that his efforts had succeeded. A sleepy
servant admitted him, albeit reluctantly. She asked him to stand
in the hall while she went to arouse her mistress.</p>

<p>"Remember," said Talham, solemnly, "that it is only Miss
Yvonne that I wish to see.</p>

<p>The servant came down again in her wrapper and led him to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Talham, with deplorable familiarity, pulled the blinds up.</p>

<p>In five minutes the girl came in. She wore a long kimono of
dark blue, edged with Russian embroidery, and she had hidden the
glory of her hair under a boudoir cap.</p>

<p>She looked singularly beautiful&mdash;he had never seen her
more so.</p>

<p>She was worried, too. Naturally, she could only interpret this
unexpected call into a recurrence of the perils which she had
already experienced.</p>

<p>"I have called to see you, Miss Yale," said Talham, gravely,
"on a most important matter." She nodded and waited.</p>

<p>"Last night, or, rather, in the early hours of this morning, I
had an interview with a Mr. de Costa," said Talham.</p>

<p>He went on to give particulars of that interview. She seemed
more than ordinarily interested. It was rather as though she were
eager for all he could tell her. The light of sympathy was in her
eyes. She sat on one of those hard, straight-backed chairs which
are to be found in London drawing-rooms, and are designed to
discourage lengthy visits, her hands clasping her crossed knees,
as step by step, concealing nothing, exaggerating nothing,
omitting nothing&mdash; except, perhaps, his own foresight and
resourcefulness&mdash;Talham took her through the act of his
"just piracy," as he described it. He went on to tell the full
story of the Emperor's tomb. When he had finished, there was a
pause. Then she said gently:</p>

<p>"I understand, Captain Talham, and I appreciate your
confidence. I am glad you have told me, because Mr. de Costa
himself sent me a version last night which was not as
complimentary to yourself as you have made it." She frowned a
little as at some unpleasant memory. De Costa had threatened
her&mdash;she did not tell him this. Now, in a panic, she
realised that the information for which the old man had asked and
which she had not at the moment possessed, was now hers!</p>

<p>"Why, oh why, have you come?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You are entitled to know that," said Talham.</p>

<p>"I must hurry forward all my arrangements and go back to
China. I cannot go back until I know one thing. I cannot wait a
day," he said, vehemently, "with one doubt in my mind. Miss
Yale&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leant forward, his hands tightly clasped, his face tense
and drawn, a new Talham, and a Talham she had never seen
before&mdash;the strong, clean soul of the man shone in his face
"I want a partner," he said. "I want&mdash;you!" He jerked the
last word.</p>

<p>She rose slowly, and looked down at him still in the same
attitude in which he had made his plea&mdash;and a look of pity
and something else came over her face.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Captain Talham," she said in a low voice. "I
cannot agree, though I recognise how great an honour you have
done me."</p>

<p>He got up and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"You cannot agree;" he repeated.</p>

<p>She did not trust herself to speak, but shook her head
slowly.</p>

<p>Then a pause&mdash;one of those seemingly interminable pauses
so trying to the nerves. Neither of the two spoke. Talham's eyes
were on the floor; hers, filled with pity, were on his face. It
seemed that five minutes passed like this, though, as a matter of
fact, the period was less.</p>

<p>Then Talham said, "Oh!"</p>

<p>That was all he said. It was not an "Oh" of pain, or an "Oh"
of surprise, or "Oh" of indifference; it was just "Oh!" When
Talham left the house that memorable morning to return to the
hotel after his fantastic and fruitless quest, Yvonne Yale sat
for quite a long time in the little drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was not an apartment which shone in the merciless grey
light of early morning. At such an hour you saw the mark of the
cleaner's vacuum-brush&mdash;the discolourations where an amateur
varnisher had endeavoured to renovate the chipped
chairs&mdash;the thinness of the carpet here and there, and, most
appalling of all, the blatant artificiality of the "Gloire de
Dijon" roses which Mrs. Yale had brought back from Ostend with
her the previous year.</p>

<p>Yvonne had taken a seat by the window and was sitting on it
sideways, one arm thrown across the back and the other twisting
and untwisting a piece of loose embroidery upon her kimono.</p>

<p>She was thankful, at that moment, that her mother was a heavy
sleeper and had not been aroused by the summons.</p>

<p>Yvonne Yale hoped that she was a dutiful daughter. There were
times when she came perilously near being glad that she was not.
This was a moment when the presence of her mother would have sent
her to her room.</p>

<p>It was good to be here alone, in the silence and in the sweet
light of the early day, to think this problem over for Talham had
become a problem.</p>

<p>A fortnight ago, she would have dismissed his proposal with a
laugh&mdash;and found relief in the sight of his disappearing
back.</p>

<p>But now, this tall, brown man, with his obvious sincerity, his
interminable speeches, his earnestness, which verged upon
pomposity, had taken a place with her.</p>

<p>He filled a niche no other man had occupied, could occupy, to
do Talham justice, for Nature does not create duplicates of his
quality.</p>

<p>Exactly where was that niche? This speculation puzzled her. If
she could have answered that question after long deliberation and
self-analysis, the problem was a problem no longer.</p>

<p>Where did he stand? At that moment of time she had no feeling
of love, as young people understand love, no quickening of the
pulse at his approach, no blotting out of her soul's sun at his
departure&mdash;no gnawing ache or unsatisfied voidance of soul
at his continued absence.</p>

<p>Indeed, she had none of the conventional symptoms, and might
be excused the belief that, so far as love was concerned, there
was no bond between Talham and her.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>She walked to the French windows and, opening them, stepped
out on to the little stone balcony. She looked up and down the
street; there was nobody in sight; it would be little short of a
social crime for any of the inhabitants of Upper Curzon Street to
be seen abroad at that hour, save in evening dress.</p>

<p>Insensibly, she found herself looking long, and a little
wistfully, in the direction which she knew Talham must have
taken.</p>

<p>He was something more to her than a friend, though he was not
even a friend in the accepted sense. The confidences, which mark
the growth of friendship, had been all one-sided. It had been
Talham who had talked&mdash;be sure of that. She had listened
excellently.</p>

<p>Talham's passion was an inspiration, a thing born of a
momentary glance&mdash; love at first sight, though the term is
hateful.</p>

<p>To fulfil the requirements of the ideal, those two souls
should have leapt together to light, as two chemical elements
dormant apart, will, on impact, forsake their independent
properties and mingle riotously in the creation of a newer
element.</p>

<p>But Talham had done all the leaping. The girl had been but the
passive agent, a screen to reflect his brilliancy&mdash;Talham
was a dazzling searchlight that played on Yvonne Yale. She,
herself, produced no increase in the power of illumination.</p>

<p>It was absurd to say that she was cold. All women are
cold&mdash;just as all men are liars. In a dark room a diamond is
undistinguishable from half a brick. People who, when groping in
the gloom of ignorance, in a vain search for the furnace, which
they felt must burn within the heart of the girl, not
infrequently came up against the refrigerating plant, and retired
in disorder, composing wicked little epigrams. She stood for a
long time on the balcony&mdash; then returned to the room.</p>

<p>The servant, who had admitted her, still waited resentfully.
Her name was Martha Ann, and she had in her colourless
composition no romance. Her hour for rising was seven, and she
had risen at five. That was all.</p>

<p>"Do you want me, miss?" she asked, with offensive
patience.</p>

<p>Yvonne shook her head, and the girl went off.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I shall get to sleep now," she said bitterly.
"A nice time in the morning for a gentleman to call."</p>

<p>She said many other things, but was careful to wait until her
voice was only represented to the girl below by a succession of
incomprehensible sounds, the tenor of which might be grasped from
the fact that each sentence ended on a high note.</p>

<p>When Martha came down at the conventional hour she found her
young mistress fully dressed, moreover, dressed for the
street.</p>

<p>"I am going to Covent Garden to buy some flowers, Martha,"
said Yvonne.</p>

<p>Martha tightened her lips and said nothing until she heard the
door close behind the girl.</p>

<p>"What a house!" said Martha, and raised her eyes to the
ceiling.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. The air was sweet and clean; the
flood of golden sunlight which bathed the green spaces of the
city squares and made ornate avenues of the long orderly streets,
was a veritable elixir of life.</p>

<p>There was a spring even in the hard, asphalt pavement that
morning, and the girl found herself singing quietly to herself as
she walked along.</p>

<p>Covent Garden Market was no great distance from the hotel
which housed Talham. An hour later she was standing in the
Strand, her arms filled with dewy blooms, looking with a
thoughtful eye upon the great block of buildings which
constituted the caravanserai.</p>

<p>Breakfast was seldom a pleasant meal in Upper Curzon Street.
The urbanity, the graciousness, and the Foreign Office manner of
Mrs. Yale were never on view at so early an hour. The great
hostess of eleven p.m. became the vinegary housekeeper of nine
a.m.</p>

<p>It was as though Nature had reversed her processes, and had
evolved from the overnight butterfly a most business-like
grub.</p>

<p>There was a pile of letters by the side of Mrs. Yale's plate
when she came down to breakfast. Yvonne had already begun her
meal, and the elder woman gave her a slight peck in the region
between the eye and the superior maxilla, which signified the
automatic continuance of her devotion.</p>

<p>She flounced into her chair, unfolded her napkin, glanced at
her papers, and criticised the bacon at one and the same
time.</p>

<p>Yvonne glanced at her idly. Instinctively, she had closed all
the sound-proof doors of her mind on her stepmother's
entrance.</p>

<p>"Bills," said Mrs. Yale grimly. "We shall have to draw in our
horns."</p>

<p>Yvonne had never completely satisfied herself as to what were
the horns to which Mrs. Yale invariably referred. If it was the
cornucopian horn, it was generally drawn in empty.</p>

<p>"Here's this exasperating broker of mine," said the elder
woman, looking at a long statement of account. "I told him
particularly not to sell Long Island Gas until it reached
eighty-four&mdash;and here he has sold it at eighty-one!"</p>

<p>"It is now seventy-six," said Yvonne, drily. "If you had
waited for your eighty-four you might have lost much more
money."</p>

<p>She had taken to a study of the Share Market and its report
from sheer self-defence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale opened another letter. It was very short and,
apparently, unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said she.</p>

<p>Her language at breakfast was generally violent. It was, in a
sense, an act of devotion, since it had been acquired from her
militant husband, who long since had carried his sword to
heaven.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? From the bank?" asked Yvonne.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale invariably kept her most violent expletives for the
bank.</p>

<p>"He says I am eighty pounds overdrawn&mdash;will I put this
right at once!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale glared at her unoffending stepdaughter.</p>

<p>"It's absurd," she said, "ridiculous! Eighty pounds overdrawn!
Why, I've never heard of such a thing in my life."</p>

<p>Yvonne smiled. She, at any rate, had had this experience
before.</p>

<p>"I know what it is," said Mrs. Yale, with sudden decision.
"They've got one of those wretched horse-racing bank clerks who
is robbing the bank. He's filching my account because he knows I
am so careless. I suspected it all along!"</p>

<p>"The last time, mother," said Yvonne quietly, "you thought
Martha had been using your blank cheques. Why don't you fill up
your counterfoils, and then you would know how much money you
had?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Yale offered no reply. She made a further rapid survey
of the morning's post without finding satisfaction. She reserved
two obviously private letters for the last. These she opened and
read carefully. Then she folded them up, placed them in their
envelopes, and slipped them into a bag which hung at her
side&mdash;for all the world like a sabretache.</p>

<p>She scrutinised Yvonne with a long and approving scrutiny.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said finally, "you've got to make a good
marriage."</p>

<p>"Have I?" said the girl coolly. "I thought only people in
novelettes made good marriages. What do you mean by making a good
marriage, exactly?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't be tiresome, Yvonne," said Mrs. Yale. "I've been a
good mother to you. I've done my best to bring around you the
most eligible men in London. I've spent money like
water&mdash;which reminds me, we shall have to have that kitchen
range seen to; Martha tells me it's smoking again, and she can't
get the oven hot. Where was I?&mdash;Oh, I was saying, I have
spent money like water, and I think I am entitled to some return.
Not," she hastened to say, "that I expect any monetary reward for
my sacrifices&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yvonne had heard all this before. In one form or another this
conversation was almost a daily feature of her life.</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking, my dear," said Mrs. Yale, putting her
head on one side and looking at her stepdaughter with her pale
blue eyes opened to their widest extent. "I cannot help thinking
that you have not always appreciated my efforts. That new dress,
for instance, which I bought at the summer sales&mdash;you have
never worn it."</p>

<p>"It's totally unsuitable for me, mother," said Yvonne. "I
thought I told you so. It's not the kind of dress that I should
care to be seen walking in. I'd always much rather choose my
own."</p>

<p>"That's pique," said her stepmother. "That's naughty
pique."</p>

<p>Yvonne made no reply. It was useless to argue the point.</p>

<p>"Then, the other night, when Mr. de Costa called to
congratulate you on your rescue from those horrid China
people"&mdash;Yvonne's lips curled scornfully&mdash;"you came
down absolutely without a jewel on. Yet, in your room, on your
own table, for you to wear, are my own pearls&mdash;my own
bangles."</p>

<p>Yvonne smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear mother," she said, "I will not wear imitation pearls,
even to please you, and most certainly I will not wear any kind
of jewel which everybody, who is in the habit of coming to this
house, has seen round your neck at least a dozen times. You see
they are rather unmistakable," she said carefully. "If they were
real, they could not be worth less than fifty thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"There is a certain finesse in these things," said Mrs. Yale
vaguely; but she did not pursue the topic.</p>

<p>She waited until her own meal was nearly at an end, and the
girl was folding her serviette preparatory to leaving the table,
before she returned to the attack.</p>

<p>"What about young De Costa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"Has he proposed to you?"</p>

<p>"I really forget," said Yvonne carelessly. "These people do
propose in a way&mdash; almost mechanically. I don't like
him&mdash;he is rather a worm."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale frowned.</p>

<p>"A most unkind description," she said severely. "His father is
immensely rich. He gave you a beautiful bangle which I never see
you wearing, by the way." She paused for an explanation, but
Yvonne offered none. "And what of Captain Talham?"</p>

<p>Yvonne rose from the table.</p>

<p>"I don't propose to discuss these matters at breakfast,
mother," she said. "You know, it takes all the romance out of a
thing. It reduces love and marriage to the level of cold
bacon."</p>

<p>"But has he?" persisted Mrs. Yale.</p>

<p>"Has he what?" the girl evaded.</p>

<p>"Has he proposed to you, my dear? Let me impress upon you this
fact&mdash;that though Captain Talham is not enormously wealthy,
he has prospects, and he is enormously generous. I hope you have
not forgotten the fact that he rescued you from the hands of
those terrible persons."</p>

<p>"He has proposed," interrupted the girl, "if that is what you
mean. In fact, he called this morning at five o'clock to make his
proposal."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; AND RECEIVES HIS ANSWER</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. YALE gasped.</p>

<p>"Proposed this morning!" she repeated incredulously. "At five
o'clock!"</p>

<p>"He called at five this morning," said the girl, "as Martha
Ann will tell you, if you have any doubts."</p>

<p>"Why was I not aroused?" asked Mrs. Yale, with a sense of
grievance that she had missed something.</p>

<p>"Because he wasn't proposing to you," said the girl calmly.
"It was my affair entirely."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale got up from the table, a little hurt.</p>

<p>"I think, Yvonne," she said, with a sort of stagey gentleness,
"that you might remember my anxieties and sacrifices."</p>

<p>"I do not forget them," said her stepdaughter; "only,
unfortunately, this is my anxiety and my sacrifice."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale sniffed, and searched aimlessly for her
handkerchief, but thought better of it. After all, Yvonne was not
the sort of girl to be moved by tears. She did not need to have
this fact again impressed upon her. She was hard. The dear
colonel, her father, had shown similar callousness of tears, and
had laid down the perfectly dreadful theory that the more one
wept the less one perspired. And indeed, he had written a paper
on the subject, and had invited the Royal Society to allow him to
read it&mdash;a request which was respectfully declined.</p>

<p>The subject of her marriage, as Yvonne had so truly said, had
formed a periodic matter for argument&mdash;only unfortunately,
in the present instance, it was absolutely necessary that Mrs.
Yale should know where she stood.</p>

<p>She had hinted as much&mdash;indeed, had said as
much&mdash;before; but now she could say so in very truth. The
eccentric behaviour of Long Island Gas was as nothing to the
monstrous conduct of an oil well in Southern Russia.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of Mrs. Yale's money had gone from time to time
towards the sinking of a bore hole upon what the directors
invariably and carefully referred to as "The Property."</p>

<p>When they wrote to Mrs. Yale they referred to themselves as
"Your Directors." It gave the good lady the comforting feeling
that they were distant relations&mdash; though what satisfaction
accrued to her from that, Heaven only knows.</p>

<p>"Your Directors," who had started out on their career joyful
and optimistic, making conservative estimate of future profits,
which were beyond the dreams of avarice, had grown rather gloomy
of late. "Your Directors" had been probing the bowels of the
earth without any great profit to themselves, and apparently
without any great inconvenience to the earth. The oil, in its
furtive, sneaking way, seemed to have got wind of "Your
Directors'" intentions, and moved off to a neighbouring oil
field.</p>

<p>"Your Directors"&mdash;sharp and cunning fellows&mdash;were
not to be evaded. They purchased the neighbouring oil field, and
told Mrs. Yale, by private letter, that the prospects were of the
brightest, and they hoped soon to make a definite statement.</p>

<p>After six months they made a definite statement&mdash;but the
prospects were no longer of the brightest.</p>

<p>The oil, in a panic, had retired some thirty versts.</p>

<p>"Your Directors" were considering their position. Mrs. Yale
was impressed by the whole-hearted devotion of "Your Directors"
to her interests, and the employment of the blessed word "versts"
brightened her up. After all, it looked as if there was a mine
somewhere, and undoubtedly it was in a foreign country where
"miles" had a special name of their own, and so many other
extraordinary things happened.</p>

<p>In one way or another, as a result of poetic folders and
disinterested advice from Mr. Macdougal and other outside brokers
with names reminiscent of the Old Testament, Mrs. Yale had lost
some eight hundred pounds, not a considerable sum to most of the
people who lived in Upper Curzon Street, and not one to bother
even a woman circumstanced as Mrs. Yale was&mdash;the morning
after the loss.</p>

<p>Yvonne knew nothing of her stepmother's folly, or she would
have worried much more than did Mrs. Yale. As a matter of fact,
that amiable lady did not greatly distress herself. She was
obsessed with the idea that she was a born financier. She
adjusted things. She had learnt the financier's trick&mdash;which
is, not to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, but to borrow from
Peter, pay half of Paul's demands, and utilise the other half for
playing margin on sure enough stock.</p>

<p>In this way the debt both to Peter and Paul may be discharged
with a bit of luck, and anyway Paul has had something on
account.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale spent the day shopping pleasantly; Yvonne dreamt
away the hours in reverie. She thought of Talham, that first
meeting in the park, the adventures that followed her parting
with the jade bracelet, and all he had said that morning. She
acted on a sudden impulse and sent him a wire.</p>

<p>So the day wore on, bringing Mrs. Yale back from her precious
bargain sales, weary but triumphant, and the possessor of many
articles for which she had no particular use, but which were
undeniably cheap.</p>

<p>Just before dinner the second visitor was announced.</p>

<p>Yvonne read the card and frowned. "Mr. Raymond de Costa," said
the pasteboard elaborately. He had called for an answer to his
letter.</p>

<p>It was not the hour that visitors usually called, unless they
were invited to dinner, and, as Martha Ann can testify, the
dinner that night was of significant frugality. Mrs. Yale, dining
alone (and it was tantamount to dining alone when she had no
other companion at the table but her stepdaughter), was an
exponent of the simple life.</p>

<p>Martha Ann ushered the visitor into the drawing-room, then
flew to find Mrs. Yale, to warn her that three chops and a pint
of dessicated soup was very poor preparation for a dinner-party,
if it were to include Mr. de Costa.</p>

<p>Yvonne was dressing, but came down within a few minutes of his
arrival. The old man rose and favoured her with a bow as she came
in.</p>

<p>"I have called for your answer, Miss Yale," said De Costa.</p>

<p>"I have no answer to give you now, that I was not prepared to
give you yesterday," said the girl, quietly. "I could not, even
if I knew, put you in possession of the information you
require."</p>

<p>De Costa shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It means such a lot to you," he said, "and to your mother. I
am sure she would persuade you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mother could not persuade me to do anything I thought was
dishonourable and unworthy," she replied, with a note of hauteur
in her voice.</p>

<p>"You know the consequences?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"I know what you threaten," said the girl, steadily. "That you
will have Captain Talham arrested, and that you will subpoena me,
and force me to tell you what was inscribed on the bracelet."</p>

<p>The old man nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that is my intention. You can save your
friend a lot of trouble, and save me a great deal of
inconvenience, by telling me all you know."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"By hook or by crook, I am going to learn what you have to
tell," said De Costa savagely. "This man has done me a grievous
wrong, and I intend repaying myself for all the inconvenience to
which he has put me, and for all the money which I have lost as a
result of his act of theft. The bracelet was not yours; it is not
his."</p>

<p>"There is no Court of Law in England that would force me to
say what I did not wish to say," she said firmly.
"Legally&mdash;however unfortunate it was your son should have
given it to me&mdash;it was mine. It is now out of my hands. I
cannot tell you anything about it without Captain Talham's
permission."</p>

<p>De Costa shrugged.</p>

<p>"Your refusal to answer will be accepted as an answer
unfavourable to the prisoner. If you lie, the judges and the jury
will know."</p>

<p>"Have no fear," she said haughtily. "I shall not say anything
which is not true."</p>

<p>It was at that tense moment that Mrs. Yale came in. She
boasted her ability to take in a situation at a glance. Now she
sought to justify that boast.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said pleasantly, with a genial smile which
comprehended both the old man and her stepdaughter. "I see you
have succeeded in persuading my obstinate daughter."</p>

<p>"I have not yet, madam," said De Costa, putting on his mask of
courtesy. "I do not doubt we shall succeed eventually," he added,
with a smile. "I have had to take a very serious line with Miss
Yale, and I know that you will support me in my action."</p>

<p>"You may be sure, Mr. de Costa," said the lady fervently,
"that whatever action you take you have the approval of one who
is not only a fond and doting mother, but is also sufficiently a
woman of the world to realise the disinterestedness of your
action."</p>

<p>It was a speech almost worthy of Talham. She turned to the
girl.</p>

<p>"Yvonne," she said, with proper sadness, "I have never yet
exercised that authority which my position and my age and the
regard in which I was held by that hero who has long since
carried his sword to Heaven"&mdash;she dabbed her eyes
automatically&mdash;"entitles me. Yet I feel," she said firmly,
as she drew herself erect as a queen-mother would draw herself
erect, "that I must, in this present instance, insist upon your
taking a certain line of conduct&mdash;a line of conduct which
will be beneficial to us all, and which will be creditable and
worthy of the name you bear. Mr. de Costa has honoured me with
his confidence."</p>

<p>There was a little exchange of bows between the two.</p>

<p>"He has told me what steps he would take in certain
eventualities. For the honour of the house&mdash;!" She laid her
hand with dramatic effect on the girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>Yvonne heaved a deep sigh. She put up her hand and took that
of her mother's. It was not so much to demonstrate her affection
as to relieve an intolerable, melodramatic situation.</p>

<p>"There is no profit in talking to me like that, mother," she
said quietly. "You do not help me or help Mr. de Costa. The
honour of the house, you may be sure, is safely in my keeping,"
she said, with her little chin tilted upward proudly. "It is
indeed more in my keeping than it is in yours."</p>

<p>"But think of the court; think of the newspapers!" wailed Mrs.
Yale. "Think of the scandal!"</p>

<p>"I have thought of all that," said Yvonne with a little smile.
"I do not relish the prospect any more than you. If Mr. de Costa
does this disgraceful thing," she shrugged her shoulders, "what
else can I do but endure? Under any circumstances"&mdash;she
faced the old man squarely&mdash;"I will not tell you what I know
about Captain Talham's plans."</p>

<p>The opposition he was encountering had fanned the fury of the
old man to a white heat of rage. The veins in his forehead were
swelling, his voice trembled when he addressed her: "I will
know!" he said, "I will know what that bracelet said. If you
don't tell me I'll find a way&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and looked over the girl's shoulder at
the doorway, his mouth open, his eyes staring, for Talham had
brushed aside the agitated Martha Ann, and had stood there,
unannounced, for quite a minute.</p>

<p>The girl, following the direction of the old man's eyes,
looked round. Her face went pink and white, her hands clasped and
unclasped about her crumpled handkerchief.</p>

<p>He came forward with his shoulders bent a little forward, his
eyes peering from left to right, a trick of his when he was
facing a peril, the extent of which he did not know.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard my name mentioned," he said softly. "I
intrude for the second time this day, but I come to take farewell
&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not directly address Yvonne, nor did he look at
her.</p>

<p>Whatever faults the old man De Costa had, cowardice was not
one of them.</p>

<p>"I mentioned your name," he said loudly, "and I am telling you
now, Captain Talham, what I have told this young lady: that if
you restore that bracelet which you have purloined, I am prepared
to take no further action; but otherwise, I shall apply for a
warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>It was, of course, the maddest kind of bluff to put on a man
of Talham's calibre.</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>Talham was monstrously polite. The girl's eyes were fixed on
him, and her face was a little drawn with anxiety. He smiled at
her, an encouraging and an understanding smile.</p>

<p>"We are under the impression," he said regally, "that you have
already applied for the warrant, but that the authorities have
refused to supply you with the necessary instrument to remove us.
As for the bracelet"&mdash;he smiled again&mdash;"we are
prepared, at this moment, to tell you exactly the wording on that
extraordinary ornament; but alas! it is in the hands of our
excellent friend Tillizinni."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. The old man made as if to go.</p>

<p>"You shall hear again from me, Captain Talham," he breathed.
"Although I admit the warrant has not been granted, yet in a day
or two the necessary affidavits will be received from China."</p>

<p>"We shall be ready to answer any charge you may bring against
us," said Talham, "and we would remark that it is no part of our
desire to shrink from the ordeal of a public trial. We have
supreme and complete faith in the justice of our cause, and we do
not shrink from the judgment of our peers."</p>

<p>Evidently De Costa was not anxious to hear the conclusion of
the speech. He had long left the room before Talham reached his
peroration, which he had so skilfully and adroitly adjusted as to
render the presence of the other unnecessary to its dramatic
effect.</p>

<p>The girl listened with patience which was beyond praise,
though her mind and her heart were in a ferment, and though every
moment's delay was torture to her. As for Mrs. Yale, that
wonderful and adaptable woman, she became the sole audience, as
far as Talham was concerned. It was she who supplied the murmured
applause, who agreed with the deductions he made and the
inferences he assumed, though they were tolerably
incomprehensible to her. She sat with the proud and happy smile
of the well-tested friend who had seen her loyalty
vindicated.</p>

<p>At last Talham's address came to an end.</p>

<p>"I want to see you alone," said Yvonne.</p>

<p>There was hardly a break between his last words and her
request, so quick she was to take advantage of the silence.</p>

<p>"I have to explain why I wired to you," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yale tiptoed from the room with ostentatious
discretion.</p>

<p>"I wired to you," said the girl at last, "because I wanted to
see you."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"These people weren't worrying you, were they?" he asked;
"because you need not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know!" she said hastily. "I know! But I'm afraid of what
they will do; that they will force me to go out as witness
against you. But I will never tell," she said. "Never!
never!"</p>

<p>Talham was looking at her in perturbation. It was a new Yvonne
Yale he saw; such a one as he had never dreamt of. She took his
breath away; he felt himself shaking from head to foot, and at
that moment he cursed what he thought was a recurrence of
malarial fever. But there was no malarial germ in Talham's veins
at that moment. There was something within her that spoke to him,
some message which went out in vibrant waves and shook the very
centre of life within him.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Talham was speechless. He
could say nothing; his tongue refused its duty, and Yvonne Yale
was in no better case. For her throat had gone dry and husky; it
sounded queerly hoarse when she spoke, and she was short of
breath, though she had made no recent or unusual exertion.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham," she managed to say, "I wanted to tell you
something.... That is why I sent for you. It is a very
extraordinary thing I want to say. Suppose they arrest you?" He
shook his head. Even that possibility did not lend him words.</p>

<p>"Suppose they arrest you," she went on in her new, breathless
way, with her eyes shining and moist, and her lips parted because
of the very physical discomfort of breathing. "Suppose they ask
me to go into the witness-box to testify against you... there is
a law in England, do you know it&mdash;that no&mdash;
no&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again she stopped; the words were so difficult and so
impossible.</p>

<p>"There is a law in England," she went on again, "that a wife
cannot testify against her husband."</p>

<p>The last words were in a whisper.</p>

<p>For a moment their eyes met. He held them for a breathing
space&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; SOO WHO CAME BACK</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN De Costa went back to his house he was
determined at all costs to revenge himself upon the man who had
slighted him, and who had brought such misery to his son.</p>

<p>He was prepared to brave any consequences&mdash;for an angry
man is neither logical nor reasonable, and until his temper
cooled he was wilfully blind to the danger which he himself might
incur through the publicity of a trial. That was his mood when he
reached the gloomy house in Kensington.</p>

<p>Over a frugal dinner he reviewed all the happenings of the
past few weeks, and bitterly cursed his luck. Yet the planning
and the scheming of years had not altogether ended in nought.</p>

<p>Armed with the information which he was able to give them, his
exploration parties would soon be on their way to Mount Li.</p>

<p>The books which were open to Tillizinni were open equally to
him. Within a rough radius he also had located the mountain of
the Emperor.</p>

<p>His house was in disorder: Holland sheets covered most of the
furniture, his valuables had been removed to the bank, and his
heavy baggage already stood roped and corded for the journey
which he had set himself.</p>

<p>He intended travelling across the Trans-Siberian Railway, and
sending his trunks on to Shanghai to a trusted agent. The tickets
necessary for the journey were in his desk, and his sleeping
berth had been booked for some weeks past. This thought made the
old man pause: it might be three weeks or a month before he could
bring Talham to trial, even supposing that he persuaded the
Public Prosecutor to act, and a month was a long time. He decided
to sleep on it before taking any further action.</p>

<p>Half-way through dinner, Gregory de Costa paid him an
unexpected visit. For two weeks Gregory had seldom been at home
except to sleep, and that night, as the old man knew, he had an
engagement to dine with a party at a fashionable West End
restaurant.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the old man, not unkindly. "What has happened to
you?" The young man sank listlessly into a chair by the
table.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I'm just sick of things&mdash;that's
all!"</p>

<p>"After dining with Soumerez?"</p>

<p>Gregory shook his head. "No," he said, "Soumerez bores me, and
I don't feel that I could sit down to dinner at the same table
to-night."</p>

<p>There was a little silence, then the young man asked: "What do
you want me to do whilst you're away?"</p>

<p>"Do!" replied his father. "Why, do what you've been doing for
the last year or two&mdash;just fool around London. I have taken
a flat for you in Jermyn Street."</p>

<p>The young man played with a salt-cellar moodily.</p>

<p>"I'd rather go with you," he said.</p>

<p>"That's impossible," said De Costa hurriedly. "I've got to go
into a country where all sorts of privations and discomforts have
to be encountered, and you're not fit for it. You're a young man,
I know," he said gently, "but I've had the life; I have lived in
most of these wild places, and my present position is due to the
fact. In my young days I undertook certain risks and underwent
certain hardships. I have no wish that you should have any of the
experiences which were mine as a young man."</p>

<p>Gregory looked at his father curiously.</p>

<p>"I suppose you had a pretty rotten life, didn't you, when you
were young?" Raymond replied with a nod of his head. His son had
chosen an appropriate word, for "rotten" indeed was the life De
Costa had lived.</p>

<p>There was not an unsavoury transaction in the Philippines or
in the far-away trading-places of Asia with which he had not been
associated. He had financed more purely illegal schemes, had been
behind more piratical expeditions, and had been associated with
more heartless villainy than any other of his kind.</p>

<p>Not even the bad old traders of the South Sea Islands could
show such a record as his, and even the sanctified odour of
Kensington had not altogether dispersed the sinister atmosphere
of his early days.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible for you to come," he went on. "There
are all sorts of dangers to be encountered. This is my last
expedition."</p>

<p>The young man reached out and took a few grapes from the
silver centre-piece, and ate them thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of you," he said suddenly. The old man did not
conceal his pleasure.</p>

<p>"I think," he said softly, "that that is a mutual
fondness."</p>

<p>The boy rose after a while and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I suppose I had better go along and invent some lie," he
said. "Anyway, the dinner will be nearly finished, and I shall be
in time for whatever fun there is going after."</p>

<p>His father accompanied him to the door, and watched the
disappearing tail-light of the taxi; then he returned to his
study.</p>

<p>He spent an hour poring over the translation of the document
which was now in Tillizinni's hands. Had he but the jade
bracelet, how easy might it be; but he had enough to work on.</p>

<p>Some of the references puzzled him. What were the "spirit
steps," for instance; and what of these gigantic cross-bows which
were to discharge titanic arrows at the intruder? Possibly two
thousand years of rust and decay would have robbed them of their
potency.</p>

<p>He picked up some newspaper cuttings dealing with Soo, and
smiled, as again and again he came across the phrase which spoke
of the "bottling up" of the fugitive. Very well; had these clever
English policemen bottled up a man who was now in America, he
thought.</p>

<p>He tidied away his documents, and was slipping a rubber band
around one little dossier when he stopped, and raised his head,
listening.</p>

<p>It was the faintest sound, a tiny, hushed, buzz from one
corner of the room.</p>

<p>Now there was only one noise like this in the world that he
knew. It was the sound of the secret buzzer which he had had
installed communicating with a tiny push near the area door. It
had been specially put in to allow his confederates to signal
their presence when his servants were out, as they invariably
were when visitors of this kind arrived.</p>

<p>Who could it be? He took from his desk a revolver, and made
his way noiselessly downstairs to the little hallway which led
from the area to the servants' domain.</p>

<p>He crept to the door and listened; there was no sound. The
bolts were always kept well oiled. He slipped them back
noiselessly and opened the door. Two men were standing
there&mdash;two small men who made no sound.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he said; but still they made no sign. Then he knew
that they were Chinese.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he said again, addressing them in their own
language.</p>

<p>He waited until they had closed the door behind, and turning
on the electric switch, he flooded the passage with light.</p>

<p>"You!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Well might he be surprised, for these were the two agents of
his whom he thought were on their way to China, the men who
called themselves "Happy Child" and "Hope of Spring"&mdash;who
were wanted by the police for the murder of the Chinese
Ambassador, and greatly wanted by Soo T'si, for the treacherous
slaughter of their comrade&mdash;his brother.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here?" he asked angrily. He spoke in the
hissing Canton dialect.</p>

<p>They shuffled uneasily, and the smaller of the two asked
sullenly "Where were we to go, master? Though we escaped the
English police, yet Soo T'si has set his society against us, and
we have been turned from one refuge to another."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you leave the country?"</p>

<p>"Lord, it was impossible," said the other. "There were men
watching boats and trains; we were warned."</p>

<p>"You can't stay here!" said De Costa.</p>

<p>They offered no alternative suggestion, and he led the way
upstairs to his room. There they sat on the edge of the two
chairs, forlorn, miserable, with that peculiar hunted, haggard
look which criminals of all classes assume from necessity.</p>

<p>"Soo is in America now," said De Costa. "If he could get away,
why shouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Master, we were warned," said the taller man again. "A
servant from the boat told Hophee," he gave the small man his
nickname, "that they were looking for us."</p>

<p>De Costa's mind worked quickly; he had been in some peculiarly
dangerous situations before. He must get these men away as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"You want some money, I suppose," he said, and the smaller
man, who seemed to be the ruling spirit, answered
monosyllably.</p>

<p>De Costa turned out his pockets and gave him a handful of
silver and gold.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow night," he said, "at the same hour, and I will
let you know exactly what plans I have made for you. Is there any
danger until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The small man shook his head.</p>

<p>"You will find your way out, you know the way," said De Costa.
"I will come down later and bolt the door after you."</p>

<p>Noiselessly the two men left the room, and De Costa sat at his
desk in no enviable mood. He thought he heard the two men
speaking together as they went down the stairs to the basement.
In his state of tension he imagined that one had called to him
sharply, and he opened the door and stepped out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" he asked, and a voice from the basement
answered briefly, "No."</p>

<p>He had waited to hear the door open, but realised that so
perfectly had it been prepared for midnight visitors that no
sound would reach him, and he returned to his desk again.</p>

<p>These men must be got rid of at all hazards; he wondered how.
Perhaps now that the attention had been directed towards Soo they
might be smuggled out of the country. They had escaped Soo, that
was something, for Soo would make short work of them if he knew
how grossly he had been betrayed.</p>

<p>The translation of the stolen document still lay on his desk
before him, and he folded it up carefully.</p>

<p>"This, at any rate, is something," he said aloud. "But not
all," answered a quiet voice.</p>

<p>He looked up startled.</p>

<p>Before him, in the centre of the room, with his arms folded so
that his hands were concealed in his sleeves, stood Soo T'si, and
there was a smile upon his face which was not pleasant to
see.</p>

<p>"Don't touch your revolver," he said, "for I can shoot you
through my sleeve with the greatest of ease."</p>

<p>"I thought you were in America," stammered De Costa.</p>

<p>"I suppose you did," said the other.</p>

<p>He spoke easily in English, a fact which he evidently thought
called for some comment.</p>

<p>"I have been speaking nothing but Chinese for the last week or
two," he said, "and I was afraid of my English getting stale. Do
you mind if I practise it on you?" He was so affable, and so
friendly, that De Costa lost some of his misapprehension.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you," he said. "I was afraid you had got
into serious trouble."</p>

<p>Soo shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," he said lightly, "one never gets into serious
trouble; I got into a particularly foul canal, which compares
very favourably with some of the streams of my native land."</p>

<p>He did not attempt to sit down; he did not even move from
where he stood, or change his attitude.</p>

<p>"What are your plans?" asked De Costa. "I suppose you know
that the police are searching for you?" Soo nodded.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe that they are," he said
sardonically.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance to you?" asked De Costa.</p>

<p>Soo shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that you are absolutely useless to me," he said
quietly. "What is that interesting document you have there?"</p>

<p>De Costa would have snatched up the translation from the
table, but there was a cold menace in the Chinaman's eye which
prevented him.</p>

<p>"It's a little thing," he said vaguely.</p>

<p>"So I see," replied the other. "Turn it round so that I can
read it, please."</p>

<p>Like a man fascinated, De Costa obeyed, and Soo took a step
nearer the table. He read the sheet through carefully, without
moving his hands from the inside of his sleeves, and De Costa
wondered why, until he remembered that Soo had threatened him
with a concealed pistol.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to trust me." De Costa put a note of reproach
into his voice.</p>

<p>"I have very good reasons for not trusting you, De Costa. The
last time I was here you swore to me that you had not seen this
document, that you had no idea as to where it was. I have
discovered since," he went on meditatively, "that you had it all
the time, and that you were directly responsible for the
treachery of my men, and indirectly for the death of my brother;
you told your servants to bring the paper to you at any
cost&mdash;my brother's life paid for that order."</p>

<p>His voice was even and colourless, and he spoke like a man who
was reciting a lesson.</p>

<p>"You are wrong&mdash;you are wrong," protested De Costa
violently. "I know nothing whatever about it. This paper only
came to me a few days ago. I tried to find you&mdash;" Soo shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Why do you lie?" he said. "To me, who come from the land of
liars, and am skilled in their detection. I know, because the two
men you employed, and whom I have been tracking for the last
three weeks, have confessed."</p>

<p>"Confessed!" gasped De Costa.</p>

<p>Soo nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"But they have just left," stammered the other.</p>

<p>"They have not left," said Soo quietly, and withdrew his hands
from the veiling sleeves.</p>

<p>De Costa went as white as death, for the hands of Soo T'si
were scarlet with blood....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Twenty minutes later a constable slowly
patrolling his beat came to the front of the house De Costa
occupied, and automatically threw the light of his lamp over the
front door. It seemed in order, and he passed on. He had not gone
a dozen yards when he heard a sharp crack, and turned to see a
tongue of fire leap from the window of the house he had passed,
for even as he had stood watching it, the flames were eating
their way through the wooden shutters which covered the window,
and the body of old De Costa lay wrapped in a fiery sheet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; IN THE CITY OF HOO-SIN</h2>

<p class="first">THE landscape which the travellers beheld was an
especially uninviting one; the country was flat, except about the
horizon, where a range of low hills were half veiled in mist.</p>

<p>Dreary paddy fields stretched left and rights and the roadway
that led down into the village from the slope on which they stood
was little more than an uneven track.</p>

<p>"That is our objective," said one of the horsemen.</p>

<p>He looked around for the escort and the mule caravan which was
following leisurely behind. There was no sign of either. Five li
back there was a particularly difficult piece of road to
negotiate, and he gathered that with true Chinese philosophy and
imperturbability, the muleteers were waiting for the rain to
stop.</p>

<p>"That is the village of Cha-k'eo," said the taller of the
men.</p>

<p>They were both dressed in the conventional costume of
China&mdash;thick felt shoes and white stockings, wadded silk
coats and padded skirts. On the breast of one was embroidered a
fantastic pheasant, and on the top of his little cap he wore a
sky-blue button.</p>

<p>That same button had carried them through many seemingly
impossible situations.</p>

<p>"It will be raining again in a minute," said Talham with a
glance at the sky. "Let us see what Cha-k'eo offers in the way of
accommodation."</p>

<p>He cantered down the slope, his sure-footed pony making light
of the natural obstacles in the path, and trotted through the one
grimy street of the grimy village, ankle deep in black mud.</p>

<p>He drew rein before a dwelling which might have been, in a
western clime, a respectable cattle shed. There were two big
windows, one of which was half filled up with loose flat bricks,
and the other denude of any covering. The door gave entrance to
the uninviting interior, but before he could reach the door the
proprietor came out.</p>

<p>"How far are we from Shan Shi?" demanded Talham.</p>

<p>"Lord, you are fifty li," said the man with a profound bow. "I
would advise your excellencies to stay here for the night, for
the road is very difficult, and is, moreover, patrolled by bad
characters."</p>

<p>He glanced nervously up at Talham as he spoke, for, for all he
knew, this might be one of those bad characters against whom he
felt it his duty to warn the unwary.</p>

<p>"The advice of the chink in his native habitation," orated
Talham as he dismounted slowly, "is liable to be self-interested.
On this occasion, however, I think his natural desire to rob us
of our cash runs hand in hand with a proper appreciation of real
danger."</p>

<p>He spoke in English, and then turned to the fawning
landlord.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said benevolently, "tell me the name of the
men who patrol this road."</p>

<p>The landlord hesitated. He was evidently afraid to speak
openly, yet the authority of Talham's tone, the undeniable rank
which he held, and, moreover, the familiarity of the stranger
with the dialect of the district, compelled confidence.</p>

<p>"It is the honourable Society of the Bannermen of Heaven," he
said humbly. "As your Excellency knows, the city of Taupan, one
hundred li south, is having much trouble. There is a rebellion,
and His Excellency the Governor has been killed. It is said, too,
that his honourable son has returned from the land of the foreign
devils."</p>

<p>Talham interrupted him sharply.</p>

<p>"You shall not say," he said, "Iang kuei-tsi, but Iang-ren,
for I am a foreigner, and your speech is offensive to me."</p>

<p>The man bowed low. He was frightened almost to death, and was
shaking in every limb, for the stories of the foreigner, and the
events which had followed the taking of Pekin, had been
exaggerated up and down the country. Moreover, as he knew,
Iang-ren filled the Chinese army, holding high positions, as this
great one evidently did.</p>

<p>"Lord, it was a slip of my tongue," he said naïvely, "as we
used to speak of foreigners in the days of Ihoch'uan."</p>

<p>He gave the Boxers their full title, and Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"Take the horses and let them be cleaned and fed," he said.
"My friend and I desire your best room."</p>

<p>The man led the way with many apologies into the interior of
his shed. To Talham's surprise, there was an interior room which
had few of the objectionable features which Chinese caravanserai
frequently present. It was tolerably clean, and free from the
disagreeable odour of opium smoke.</p>

<p>A long, low kang occupied the full length of one wall, and
when an hour later the mule train came up, and rugs were spread
upon the Chinese equivalent for bedstead, and a brazier of
burning charcoal was brought in, the travellers had good reason
for congratulating themselves upon the comfort of their
lodging.</p>

<p>That the arrival of foreigners in a tiny village would attract
the entire population goes without saying, but a word from Talham
dismissed the rabble, and the landlord was placed outside the
door with two of the escort to see that the foreign "lords" were
not disturbed.</p>

<p>"You may say," said Talham, "that we have now reached the most
critical portion of our journey."</p>

<p>Tillizinni was examining a map by the light of a Chinese
lamp.</p>

<p>"If your surmises are right," he said, "the Mount Li described
in the Second Emperor's account, is that somewhat insignificant
hill that we saw as we came over the rise to the village."</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that it is," he said.</p>

<p>He seemed less inclined to orate than Tillizinni had ever
remembered him. Indeed, so marked was his depression that
presently the detective referred to it.</p>

<p>"I know," said the other uncomfortably; "but the fact is, I am
not too satisfied with the progress we have made, and less
satisfied did you hear what he said?"</p>

<p>He jerked his head in the direction of the landlord.</p>

<p>"I did," said Tillizinni. "But, fortunately, my knowledge of
the dialect isn't as good as yours. I find that a conversance
with 'Mandarin Chinese' isn't always as useful as it might
be."</p>

<p>"He said that there had been a revolt in Taupan," said Talham,
"and that His Excellency the Governor had been killed, and that
his son occupied what amounted to the kingship of this district.
Do you realise who that man is?"</p>

<p>"Not Soo?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>Talham nodded.</p>

<p>"That's just who it is," he said, "and he has tricked us." He
was silent for a moment, then, "Anyway, I'm glad he's here," he
said. "I've been getting jumpy about Yvonne."</p>

<p>The thought that Soo might be within six or seven days'
journey had troubled him.</p>

<p>"It is better he should be here than there."</p>

<p>He was almost cheerful at the thought.</p>

<p>"He'll hear to-morrow that we're in the district," he went on,
"and then the fun is going to begin."</p>

<p>Before he went to sleep that night, Tillizinni saw that his
revolver was loaded, and placed it under his pillow within reach
of his hand. News travels fast in a country which does not depend
so much upon the up-to-date telegraph, as upon some mysterious
means of communication which is peculiarly the secret of a
semi-barbarian people.</p>

<p>They were not to be disturbed that night, however, and
Tillizinni woke to find the day broken and rain still falling
heavily. Breakfast was prepared by the servant whom Talham had
engaged at Shanghai, but in spite of the wretched surroundings
and the unpleasant prophecy of the day, the two men made a good
meal.</p>

<p>"Our immediate danger," said Talham, "lies in the fact that we
are going straight to Hoo Sin, a city which is in some way allied
to our friend's stronghold. What makes it rather awkward is the
fact that Hoo Sin must be our base for a week or two, or, at any
rate, until we can locate the tomb."</p>

<p>Tillizinni nodded.</p>

<p>"I know the mandarin personally," Talham went on "An Oriental
of exceeding affability, and it would seem to me that the
possibility of the Oriental mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>He might have developed his speech into a discourse on Chinese
metaphysics, but Tillizinni interrupted him.</p>

<p>"We have to go," he said, "and the roads are pretty bad."</p>

<p>They were worse than the men anticipated, and the progress
along the wild and tortuous path, which was dignified by the name
of road, was a painful experience.</p>

<p>The two leaders of the expedition could not afford to leave
their escort. They were in an enemy's country, and although the
fifty soldiers which the First Mandarin of the Empire had
supplied them was a formidable body, Talham knew the Chinamen
well enough to know that they could not be depended upon if they
were convinced that the object of his trip was the desecration of
a grave.</p>

<p>He would gain nothing by explaining to them that he had no
intention of robbing the grave of its treasures, or that he
sought some wonderful mechanical secret which the dead years
held&mdash;that was too supple a distinction for words.</p>

<p>He had sent messengers ahead a week before to collect as many
of the soldiers who had served in his regiment as could be found,
to meet him at Hoo Sin. Soo might send a story flaming through
the bazaar that would set the city of Hoo Sin in a
ferment&mdash;if he dared. That reservation was Talham's only
hope.</p>

<p>If Soo himself had designs upon the tomb, desired exact
knowledge as to its location, and wished for himself to unravel
the mystery and to take the treasures of the dead king, he would
be silent. Once he set the city in a ferment he might spoil
whatever chance Talham had of achieving his object, but he would
just as assuredly defeat his own ends, and might, moreover, call
down upon the city of Hoo Sin a detachment of Imperial troops, to
say nothing of commissions of enquiry.</p>

<p>The thought comforted Talham as he jogged along, the rain
falling in sheets above his head, the pony under him stumbling
across rocks and through pools of liquid mud, towards the blurred
horizon.</p>

<p>There is no more cheerless sight in the world than a Chinese
landscape on either side the flat black land stretched drearily
to the stunted hills.</p>

<p>Now and again they would pass a half-ruined temple or a
collection of squalid huts, too tiny it seemed to bear the long
name which custom had given to them.</p>

<p>Night was falling when they clattered up the broad irregular
street, littered with garbage, and passed through the high, gaunt
city gates of Hoo Sin.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and the city was filled with people who
looked curiously at the "foreign devils," whom no Chinese costume
could disguise. No demonstration was made, however, as the two
men and their escort rode up to the Yamen and dismounted.</p>

<p>There was the inevitable delay.</p>

<p>The Mandarin's assistant who interviewed him in the courtyard
of the Yamen at Talham's request for an interview had
disappeared. He returned in a few minutes full of apologies and
regrets. His Excellent Lio-le was indisposed, and regretted that
he was unable to see the honourable visitors.</p>

<p>Talham turned to Tillizinni and said in English "That is
pretty ominous. If old Lio-le won't see us, it is because he is
afraid of our friend Soo."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary that we should see him?" asked
Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Talham nodded. He turned again to the secretary.</p>

<p>"You will go at once to His Excellency and say a Mandarin of
the Empire, and a bearer of the Imperial Banner, desires an
immediate audience in the name of the Daughter of Heaven, the
Dowager Empress."</p>

<p>The man bowed low and went back to the Yamen.</p>

<p>He returned almost immediately with the request that the two
should follow him.</p>

<p>They passed through the big, cold entrance-hall into the
throne-room of the Yamen. As they entered, a man, sitting in
solitary state at one end of the room, fanning himself
mechanically, rose and shuffled forward, stopping within a few
paces of his visitors to give the customary Chinese kow-tow.</p>

<p>The old Mandarin was stout and ordinarily jovial, but now his
face wore a troubled and fretful expression.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to this city?" he asked with asperity. "Where
do you come from? How many miles have you travelled by road?" and
so through the whole gamut of questions which are conventionally
asked by those in authority of those who come within their
sphere.</p>

<p>The servants brought tea&mdash;little cups and placed them
handy. Tillizinni, to whom a cup of tea would have been very
refreshing at that moment, almost mechanically stretched out his
hand to take one, when Talham stopped him.</p>

<p>"To take tea," he said, "is a sign that the interview is
finished, and I have much to ask our friend before the
tea-drinking stage arrives."</p>

<p>"Does the honourable stranger intend staying in our perfectly
beastly little village for any time?" asked the Mandarin.</p>

<p>Talham bowed.</p>

<p>"Though we are unworthy to walk through the beautiful streets
of this most divine city," he said, "we wish your noble citizens
to tolerate our disagreeable presence for the space of a
moon."</p>

<p>The Mandarin eyed him coldly.</p>

<p>"At this season of the year," he said significantly, "my mean
and despicable city is very unhealthy for the honourable
foreigner."</p>

<p>"Yet we will stay," answered Talham promptly, "if your
Excellency will afford protection to two insignificant animals
who, by the fortune of the gods, are very precious to the
Daughter of Heaven, the Dowager Empress. So much does the
Daughter of Heaven regard us," he continued, "that though we are
as dirt under her feet, every moon there will come a courier from
Pekin to your glorious community to seek information as to our
welfare, and if"&mdash;he was apologetic&mdash; "if we are so
base and horrible that we cannot find health in so salubrious a
spot, the courier will return to the Daughter of Heaven with news
of our misfortune."</p>

<p>It was threat for threat, and Talham carried the heavier guns.
His passport was in order, and he was commended by the highest in
the land, and at the end ran the "tremble and obey" of an exalted
Prince of the Royal House.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE TOMB LOCATED</h2>

<p class="first">THE Mandarin's face was a study. Between fear of
consequence, the sure reprisal which would come to him from the
Government if his visitors were harmed, and the fear of the
greater and more immediate danger from a cause unknown to the
visitors, but very accurately guessed, he was in a very painful
quandary.</p>

<p>"If the honourable strangers will accept the hospitality of my
miserable pigsty," he said sullenly, "for a few days, at least, I
will ensure them safety from the disorderly characters who
populate my unsavoury town."</p>

<p>He reached out for the cup, and the two men followed suit, for
they were dismissed.</p>

<p>They made their way to the house to whither Talham had already
directed his muleteers. The two men rode back through the bazaar
by themselves. There was nothing in the attitude of the people to
suggest that they had organised opposition to fear. The scowls
and half-muttered implications which greeted them was the usual
lot of the Western traveller in that part of the world.</p>

<p>Talham's keen eyes surveyed the crowd as the horses made their
way slowly through the street leading to the western end of the
city. He was looking for a familiar face, and presently he found
it. Over the heads of the throng he saw a man standing quietly
with his back to the entrance of a fruit shop.</p>

<p>Talham tilted his chin ever so slightly, and the man, though
seemingly unobservant of his action, repeated the motion.</p>

<p>So far so good. Some of his men were in the city. He had never
depended upon the escort. He knew that they would fly at the
first hint of danger.</p>

<p>But they were armed with modern weapons, and since it was
necessary for his purpose that the various members of his old
regiment should be effectively equipped, what easier way of
bringing arms into this territory than in the hands of Imperial
troops? He had this in his mind when they reached the little
caravanserai which was to be the headquarters of the
expedition.</p>

<p>It was a one-roofed dwelling set in the middle of a yard and
surrounded by a high wall. The building proper was divided into
two parts, the smaller of which Talham directed to be cleaned out
(for it was indescribably filthy) and prepared for the lodging of
himself and his friend.</p>

<p>He handed the other to the captain of the escort.</p>

<p>It seemed to Tillizinni hardly large enough to accommodate
forty men, but then Tillizinni was not so well acquainted with
the habits and customs of the Chinese soldiery as was his
companion.</p>

<p>"It would take a hundred and forty," was the cool reply when
Tillizinni cast doubt upon its capacity.</p>

<p>They made the little room&mdash;it was no more than a stable
from their point of view&mdash;as comfortable as possible,
spreading a carpet unpacked from one of the mules and fixing up a
little much-needed ventilation.</p>

<p>The walls were thick, and an inspection of the outer wall
which surrounded the courtyard was satisfactory. The place could
withhold a siege given a few improvements, and these improvements
Talham set himself out to make without further delay.</p>

<p>He sent into the town for workmen, and as soon as day broke he
had them knocking out bricks from the wall at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>Some news of this must have come to the Mandarin, for he sent
a hurried message demanding Talham's presence.</p>

<p>The tall man rode out along to the Yamen and saw his unwilling
host.</p>

<p>"News has come to me," said the Mandarin without preliminary,
"that your honourable self and your honourable friend are engaged
in making alterations to the outer wall of the King-Li. Now, such
conduct," he wagged his finger at Talham, "is against my faith. I
cannot save-face if it is known that my protection is so unworthy
to the honourable foreigners that he must fortify himself against
the citizens of this town."</p>

<p>"Lao-ae," said Talham earnestly, and he employed his full
knowledge of Mandarin Chinese to further his eloquence, "though I
am but as the mud under the wheels of your cart, though I am not
fitted even to prostrate myself in your presence, yet the
Daughter of Heaven thinks so well of me that it would not please
me if I caused the great and beautiful lady sorrow by my death.
Moreover," he added, "my love and esteem for you, who are known
from one end of the Empire to the other as a just and wise ruler,
and one marked out for special promotion to the Governorship of
Shu Shung&mdash;"</p>

<p>A little gleam came into the Mandarin's eye at this broad
hint, though he might have known that Talham could lie as well as
any other man.</p>

<p>"Yet," the big man went on, "because I have this affection for
you, I am terrified lest trouble come upon your nobility through
some mischance to my miserable carcase."</p>

<p>The Mandarin was silent.</p>

<p>The reference to a governorship, the dreams of his life, set
him thinking. Presently he said mildly: "I have talked with your
Excellency, and my duty is finished&mdash;puh p' a! You have
nothing to fear."</p>

<p>With that he allowed Talham to return to his work of putting
the inn into a condition of defence.</p>

<p>Talham had posted two sentries at the gate, and people were
only allowed in two at a time.</p>

<p>That there should be a big crowd before the foreigner's
quarters&mdash;a crowd of curious, peering, tip-toeing,
interested Celestials, goes without saying, for the Chinese are
tremendously curious.</p>

<p>Every now and again the officer of the guard would come to
Talham, busy with Tillizinni, working out calculations as to
distances and depths, with the information that a stranger wished
to see him. Talham would walk patiently to the gate, exchange a
few words with the man who desired an audience, and, at a nod,
the stranger would be allowed to pass.</p>

<p>By the evening of the first day there were occupying the
little compound some forty soldiers and some forty-five
nondescript Chinamen who had turned up from nowhere in
particular, and Talham's estimate as to the sleeping capacity of
the improvised barrack-room proved to be no exaggeration.</p>

<p>He had made one wise provision, and that was that the arms of
the escort, including even the sword and revolver of the officer
commanding when he was not on duty, should be stacked in a
smaller room. In addition, he had all the ammunition which he had
brought with him similarly stored. It cramped the small apartment
considerably and filled up every available piece of space, but
Talham was insistent upon this, though the officer demurred.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the new guard mounted, they took over the
rifles of the men who had been on duty on the previous day.</p>

<p>On the third day Talham went out to make an inspection of the
problematic Mount Li. He left before daybreak and only halted at
the city gates because they were not open at that hour.</p>

<p>He did not return until near sunset, and when he did he was
immensely hungry, not having, as he said, eaten since he set
forth, save a couple of dubious eggs which he secured at a
village en route.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied we are on the right track," he said, "and I am
more satisfied because a farmer in the neighbourhood tells me
that some men have been over from Tai-San quite recently
exploring the mountain.</p>

<p>"It isn't a mountain really," he went on. "As a matter of fact
I have a theory that previous to the Emperor's death, it had no
existence at all."</p>

<p>He described the place.</p>

<p>It lay in the neck or dip of two hills, and, apparently, had
been filled up so that the top of the hill should offer an
unbroken sky-line to the traveller in the valley beneath.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt at all in my mind," said Talham
emphatically, "that this is the tomb. We have now to find the
guarded entrance. You can see the slope of the hills before they
were earthed up quite distinctly, and I think I have found the
ruins of an old temple half buried near the crest of one of
these."</p>

<p>He read again the Second Emperor's description.</p>

<p>"That's it," he said. "He caused trees and grass to be planted
so that it might appear a part of the mountain."</p>

<p>"But why should he have been brought so far away from the
capital?" asked Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"That is a question which we have never satisfactorily
settled. You might as well ask," said the other, "why the Ming
Emperors wanted huge stone elephants to indicate the way to their
tombs. There is no reason for anything in China, except that if
you see a thing for which there is absolutely no excuse, you may
be satisfied that that is the excuse!"</p>

<p>"You are almost lucid," said Tillizinni with a smile.</p>

<p>He himself was enjoying the trip immensely; he found the
relaxation which he needed so badly. There was no telephone;
nobody brought him tangles of mystery to unravel. He was living
amidst actualities, amongst primitive forces, in a land where
murder was a commonplace everyday incident, and where the
murderers seldom troubled to hide their tracks. He recognised
that there was considerable danger to himself and to his
companion if the real object of the visit was ever
discovered.</p>

<p>Soo would be very active just now; his spies would long since
have carried news of the arrival of the "foreign devils."</p>

<p>It needed no spy, as it happened, for the Mandarin himself,
with a keen desire to "save-face" all round, had sent a private
courier with many apologies to his powerful rival, and Soo's
agents were active.</p>

<p>The first indication of trouble that Talham had seen took the
shape of a jagged stone which was thrown at him as he passed
through the bazaar on an afternoon on his return from one of his
expeditions.</p>

<p>That evening he found the soldiers sullen, and he was
interviewed by the officer of the guard.</p>

<p>"My insignificant men," said the officer, "have petitioned me,
asking that your Noble Beneficence will restore to them their
arms, because they feel afraid and ashamed also, since the common
people of the bazaar laugh at them."</p>

<p>"You may tell your men to go to the devil," said Talham
without finesse.</p>

<p>But an hour later the officer had returned, this time with a
fresh grievance.</p>

<p>"My men," he said boldly, "do not like these strangers,
sleeping in the same room with them, for they come from another
province, and are members of another society."</p>

<p>"Captain," said Talham patiently, "if you come to me again
with such stories, I will have you beaten on the feet."</p>

<p>Later, he was to receive private advice from one of these same
strangers, that the men had had a meeting and were discussing the
advisability of leaving the compound in a body.</p>

<p>This threat took definite shape the next morning, when the
officer came yet again in some fear to announce the intention of
his men.</p>

<p>"These pigs," he said humbly, "will leave your Excellency
unless their arms are returned."</p>

<p>"Tell them they may leave," said Talham cheerfully, "and they
will get no arms from me."</p>

<p>The situation outside the gates was even more serious. A
rumour had broken through the bazaar that the foreigners had come
to mark out the land for a railway.</p>

<p>The people in this province were fanatics on the question of
"fire-horses," and every hour the feeling grew against the
intruders.</p>

<p>Talham suspected the Mandarin of fostering this feeling. Twice
when he had called at the Yamen His Excellency had been
indisposed and only his men-shang was visible. On the occasion of
the second visit (he had called in on his way back from one of
his trips of exploration) a hostile crowd surrounded his horse,
and somebody from the outskirts of the crowd had thrown a stone
which narrowly missed his face.</p>

<p>Instantly the big man turned his horse, scattering the people
left and right. He had seen the face of the thrower, and reaching
down he caught him by the collar of his jacket and galloped with
him at full speed through the streets, his prisoner alternately
running and stumbling in the powerful grip of his captor.</p>

<p>Talham reached the compound and the gates closed behind him;
then he turned his attention to his captive.</p>

<p>"Seize that man," he said in Chinese, and the guard obeyed the
order reluctantly.</p>

<p>Talham dismounted and came to where the man stood.</p>

<p>"Why did you throw stones?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because you are a 'foreign devil' and are going to bring the
'fire-horses' across the graves of our ancestors," said the
Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Who told you this?"</p>

<p>"Everybody knows it," answered the prisoner, emboldened by the
fact that he had escaped immediate punishment.</p>

<p>"You are not of this town. Where do you come from?" The man
hesitated.</p>

<p>"I come from Tang Ti," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, liar, and son of a liar!" said Talham. "You come from
Tai-pau."</p>

<p>The man shifted uneasily on his feet.</p>

<p>"Who sent you?" asked Talham. "Let me see his shoulder."</p>

<p>Again the guard showed some reluctance to obey, and Talham
himself stepped forward and tore the blouse of the man from his
neck and scrutinised the yellow flesh for the sign of the
telltale tattoo.</p>

<p>It was there.</p>

<p>"Go back to Lao-ae Soo T'si," he said, "and tell him that I
know who is at the bottom of all this hostility. I speak to you
fairly," he added, "because I see you are a student, and perhaps
you are the son of great parents."</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"I am the son of a son of a Mandarin," he said with pride.</p>

<p>Your Chinaman will never deny his parentage if it be
sufficiently illustrious.</p>

<p>"Well, then, son of a son of a Mandarin, or son of a son of a
gun, whichever you are," said Talham, "go quickly from this place
and take with you as many of your friends as you can find."</p>

<p>With that he turned the man loose.</p>

<p>That night Talham's escort deserted in a body, and the big man
was jubilant.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have happened better," he said. "I was wondering
how I could get rid of the beggars."</p>

<p>Instantly he assembled his own men and armed them. He was
satisfied of their loyalty, and distributed ammunition that same
night. For some reason the hostility in the bazaar had ceased
after that one act of stone-throwing. The escort disappeared from
the town as if by magic.</p>

<p>It was not a healthy sign as Talham knew, because armed or
disarmed, they were men who carried the Imperial badge upon their
breast, and their hurried departure was ominous. He rode out now
to Mount Li with an escort of four of his own men. He thought he
had detected the entrance to the tomb.</p>

<p>Half-way down the hill two straight ledges of the rock jutted
out. They ran parallel to one another for about twenty yards, and
then curved downward into the earth. From a distance they had
every appearance of being placed there by nature, but something
induced Talham to take a closer view. He made the ascent over the
loose rubble and through the stunted bushes which covered the
hillside.</p>

<p>He examined them carefully, and in the end he had no doubt
whatever that they were placed there by the hand of man.</p>

<p>This would be the entrance, if entrance there were.</p>

<p>He had looked for an opening to the tomb at the foot of the
hill. Apparently, it was half-way up that he must seek it.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly sure," he told Tillizinni that night, "that if
we can dig between those two pieces of sculpture, for pieces of
sculpture they are, ingeniously carved to represent natural rock,
and at the same time to afford some interested person a clue as
to the whereabouts of the hill, we shall come upon the famous
bronze door which hides the secret of the Emperor's
artificers.</p>

<p>"We shall have to do our digging by night," he went on; "but I
don't anticipate digging very far. From what I have seen of the
entrance to the tomb, it looks as though a few more showers of
rain would wash the bronze door into view."</p>

<p>Preparations were far advanced towards the final examination
of the hill, and it was in the afternoon previous to the day on
which the attempt was to be made, that a courier came hot-foot
from the Yamen summoning Talham to the Mandarin's presence.</p>

<p>He had not seen the great man for some days, and wondering
what was new, and somewhat apprehensive, since it was quite on
the cards that Pekin may have sent an Imperial edict prohibiting
any further research, he hurried to the Yamen, and was instantly
admitted to the presence of the Mandarin, who received him with
great geniality.</p>

<p>"A courier has brought a letter for your honourable self from
Pekin," and he picked it up from a little ebony table.</p>

<p>The letter, whatever it was, was enclosed in a large envelope
covered with Chinese characters.</p>

<p>Talham opened the outer envelope slowly, dreading the
contents. They proved to be two letters, and the first of these
was startling enough, for it was addressed to Miss Yvonne Yale,
c/o the British Consul, Hoo Sin.</p>

<p>Talham stared. There was no British Consul in Hoo Sin.</p>

<p>With a start he recognised the handwriting as that of Mrs.
Yale.</p>

<p>The second was addressed to himself, and was from the same
lady. He tore it open quickly and read its contents with a
sinking heart. It ran:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Captain
Talham</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Yvonne left London yesterday for China to join
you. She is travelling by the overland route.</p>

<p class="letter">Naturally, I felt very chary of allowing her to
go by herself, but your telegram was so emphatic that I could not
deny the dear girl the pleasure which I know she will feel in
meeting you.</p>

<p class="letter">I am sure you will telegraph her arrival the
moment she gets to Hoo Sin, and that the ladies who have so
kindly offered her their hospitality will not be disappointed in
my gem! I should be glad if you will thank them for me.</p><br>

<p>"My God!" muttered Talham, for he had sent no cablegram to the
girl or to her mother.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; IN THE CAVERN OF THE DEAD</h2>

<p class="first">"THE honourable stranger has received bad news,"
said the Mandarin.</p>

<p>Talham looked at him thoughtfully. Could he help?</p>

<p>"I have received very bad news," he said, "with which I will
not assail your magnificent ear. Yet I would ask you this. Where
is the nearest telegraph town?"</p>

<p>The Mandarin considered.</p>

<p>"There is one at Tai Pan," he said, looking straightly at the
other. "That is the nearest. Otherwise you would have to go to
Cho Sin, which is a hundred and fifty li from here."</p>

<p>"I shall send to Tai Pan," said Talham, and took his leave
with a little ceremony.</p>

<p>All messages that went through Tai Pan would, of course, be
seen by Soo. It was Cho Sin or nothing.</p>

<p>He got back to the compound, and found Tillizinni making an
inspection of the walls.</p>

<p>"I've bad news," he said, and with remarkable brevity told the
contents of the letter.</p>

<p>"The girl has been lured here by Soo," said Tillizinni;
"that's evident."</p>

<p>"My God, she may be in Tai Pan now!" said Talham.</p>

<p>"He would have met her at one of the wayside stations on the
Trans-Siberian. It's horrible, Tillizinni, horrible!"</p>

<p>Tillizinni considered.</p>

<p>"One thing is evident," he said after a while. "Once you have
penetrated the tomb of the Emperor you must clear out quick. Why
not make the attempt to-night and leave China by way of Tai Pan?
You have fifty men. Make a dash upon Soo's stronghold and take
your chance of finding Yvonne there."</p>

<p>Talham thought for awhile.</p>

<p>"That is one scheme," he said; "but I think I know a better. I
will leave twenty men to defend this place and use this as my
base. We'll go to the tomb to-night."</p>

<p>Talham could have let the tomb go&mdash;but there was nothing
to be gained by this. Mount Li was on the way to Tai
Pan&mdash;the two expeditions could be accomplished in one night.
He could reach Tai Pan before the dawn.</p>

<p>Soo would not be prepared for an early morning rush upon his
city.</p>

<p>Prudence and interest dictated parallel courses.</p>

<p>Talham had committed to memory the instructions which the dead
builders had left, some of which apparently conflicted with those
upon the jade bracelet.</p>

<p>He had written down the words engraved upon the bracelet, and
now he read them again.</p>

<p>"I am Shun, the son of the great mechanic, Shoo Shun, upon
whom the door fell when the Emperor passed. This my father told
me before the day, fearing the treachery of the Eunuchs.</p>

<p>"Behold the pelican on the left wall with the bronze neck.
Afterwards the spirit steps, afterwards rivers of silver,
afterwards door of bronze. Here Emperor... behind a great room
filled with most precious treasures."</p>

<p>"I guess he's a little wrong in the bronze door part of it,"
said Tillizinni. "It's possible that there were two sets of
disloyal mechanics planning to secure the Emperor's treasure, and
made provisions for entering and retiring at the proper
moment."</p>

<p>That afternoon his men left singly and in two's and three's,
making for the rendezvous, and when night fell, Tillizinni and
Talham, both men heavily armed, rode out into the dark streets,
and the door of the compound closed behind them.</p>

<p>They had left twenty-three men under a trusted old officer who
had been with Talham in the Northern wars, and the remainder of
the party were picked up beyond the city walls.</p>

<p>They rode along the mud track which led to Mount Li.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock before they debouched from the road and
picked a way across the rough, uncultivated land which sloped up
to the Emperor's tomb.</p>

<p>The party dismounted at the foot of the hill and took shelter
in a little gully, and six men only accompanied the two Europeans
in their climb.</p>

<p>These carried spades and picks, a spare one each for Talham
and Tillizinni, and the eight men attacked the soft earth with
feverish haste.</p>

<p>It was easier work than even Talham had anticipated, and after
an hour's work Tillizinni's spade struck something hard and
metalled.</p>

<p>"It's the door," he said exultantly.</p>

<p>He cleared away a space and examined his find with the aid of
a pocket lamp.</p>

<p>Here the hill fell sheerly, and it was at the foot of a sharp
slope that the top of the door was discovered.</p>

<p>Although the hill fell steeply there seemed to be no place
from whence a door might slide down in its grooves to block the
entrance of the cave.</p>

<p>This was the only doubt that had been in Talham's mind, but
the explanation suddenly occurred to him.</p>

<p>"I see now," he said excitedly. "It opens inward on hinges at
the top."</p>

<p>This probably was the case.</p>

<p>They continued digging for half an hour before they reached
the foot of the bronze door.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, there was no engraving upon the
panel. It was of solid bronze, green with age.</p>

<p>The men scraped carefully away at its foot, and then Talham on
one side and Tillizinni on the other, groped for the image
between the two stones. It was a long time before Talham
discovered his, but Tillizinni's was soon revealed. It had
deteriorated until it was little more than the thickness of a
curtain ring.</p>

<p>Tillizinni looked at it closely. It had been shaped crudely by
these old dishonest artisans, and even now its extemporised
character was revealed in the imperfection of the circle.</p>

<p>"Got it!" he heard Talham grunt.</p>

<p>"Does it give at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, "but, gently! It is any odds on the
connection being rotten with age.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now!" said Tillizinni. "Are you ready? Now!" He put a gentle
strain upon the ring, and it gave, ever so little.</p>

<p>He was afraid to put his full strength upon it for fear it
broke away in his hand.</p>

<p>"Again," said Talham's voice.</p>

<p>Tillizinni pulled gently. Suddenly, without a warning, there
was a horrible squeak, which it seemed could be heard for miles,
and the great door sunk as if the earth had swallowed it up, and
the big black entrance of the cave was revealed.</p>

<p>From here on, they must depend upon their own exertions. The
Chinamen declined civilly enough to assist any further. So far
they had acted in accordance with their tenets. Beyond that they
might not go.</p>

<p>Talham understood and dismissed them, telling them to wait at
the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>He flashed an electric torch about the entrance of the cave.
It was a large spacious place carved out of a solid rock. At
intervals around its grim walls were placed huge statues in
fantastic shapes, extending from the dim roof to its polished
floor.</p>

<p>Talham looked at them without awe.</p>

<p>He felt something about his feet, and flashed the light down.
He was treading on a little heap of bones. Further examination
revealed a dozen more such pitiful relics of the long-dead
artisans who had perished that they might not reveal the secret
of the Emperor's tomb.</p>

<p>For two thousand years they had laid thus, through all the
centuries pregnant with progress and with world-shaking events;
as they had fallen in death so they remained.</p>

<p>Talham was a curious mixture of the sentimental and the
practical.</p>

<p>The practical side of him brushed the relics aside with his
foot as he walked forward sending the gleam of his light flashing
up to the roof.</p>

<p>Yes, there were the two silver lamps; they were black under
the tarnish, but the delicacy of the workmanship was
apparent.</p>

<p>Reaching up his hand, Talham could just clutch the dangle
tassel beneath the first lamp.</p>

<p>"Watch that entrance," he said, and put his lamp upon the
black door at the further end of the vault.</p>

<p>He pulled and a chain gave slowly. Then, with a swift rush,
the door before him opened in the middle and parted. As it did,
from the interior of the inner chamber came a loud crash,
something whizzed between the two men, passed through the opening
where the bronze door had been, and buried itself in the hillside
without.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Talham, "that crossbow did work after all."</p>

<p>He wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>"I trust nothing else unpleasant happens," he said.</p>

<p>He looked round for the pelican which had been referred to on
the bracelet, but could see no sign of any such ornament.</p>

<p>The steps leading down into the inner room were clean and
smooth. They were of white marble, save in the centre was what
appeared to be a carpet. On closer inspection this proved to be
"treads" of jade, two feet wide and exactly in the centre of the
stairway.</p>

<p>"Those are the spirit steps," said Talham. "You had better
keep to them."</p>

<p>"What are spirit steps?" asked Tillizinni in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's an old Chinese idea, and you'll find it in a good many
temples," replied Talham briefly. "It is popularly supposed to be
the steps up and down which the spirits of the departed pass to
their devotions, and is never under any circumstances used by
mortals."</p>

<p>"For a moment," he said with a facetiousness which seemed to
Tillizinni to be entirely out of place, "we will regard ourselves
as disembodied and keep to the spirit steps."</p>

<p>He walked down gingerly. Half way to the bottom were two
little niches on which stood carved representations of two of the
earlier Chinese deities.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at them thoughtfully. Then, leaning
over, he lifted one down. It was a tremendous weight, and he
staggered under it, but Talham was curious to see the result of
his experiment.</p>

<p>He placed the statue upon one of the white marble steps which
ran down at either side of him. For a moment nothing happened,
and then the stairs opened under it and it disappeared.</p>

<p>In a second came the tinkle of smashing steel.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Talham. "If we had departed from the
spirit steps, we should have fallen into a most unpleasant
mess."</p>

<p>He watched the yawning hole where the steps had been. Three
had disappeared.</p>

<p>In a few seconds they came slowly back and jarred themselves
back into their place.</p>

<p>"They are balanced on an arm below," explained Tillizinni. "I
saw something of that sort in Burma years ago."</p>

<p>He led the way down, and so they came to the inner
chamber.</p>

<p>"Look!" gasped Talham, and well might he be astonished, for as
they put their foot upon the lower stairs the whole of the inner
chamber was flooded with soft light.</p>

<p>It came from the cornices in the roof and was reflected down
from the glittering blue firmament of an artificial heaven.</p>

<p>"It's electric!" said Talham in a whisper. "I never dreamt of
this."</p>

<p>Whilst they stood upon the steps the light continued. When
they took a step forward it went out. They returned to the lower
step and the room was again illuminated.</p>

<p>"It was from this step, you may be sure, that the Second
Emperor took his last view of his father," said Tillizinni.
"There is your river."</p>

<p>They looked down in silent wonderment. There at their feet was
China&mdash;China as it was known to the ancients, with little
townships cunningly modelled, and the ever-moving river flowed
from hill to sea. So it had been flowing for two thousand
years.</p>

<p>"Stand on the step," said Talham, "and let me see."</p>

<p>He stepped down quickly and leant over one of the tiny streams
that wandered tortuously through an artificial garden.</p>

<p>"It's quicksilver all right," he said.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room was a great block of polished black
stone, and upon this rested a stone coffin. The pedestal was
reached by three steps, but the steps were indistinguishable.
They were covered with rags, and, as it seemed, little pieces of
white, glittering wood.</p>

<p>Talham surveyed them reverently. These, then, were the
unfortunate creatures of joy, who had gone down to death with
their lord.</p>

<p>He made a rapid survey of the great stone room. At either side
he saw a square pit, and flashed a light down upon the white gems
that still glittered and sparkled in the light.</p>

<p>He was seeking something else, and presently he found
it&mdash;a little box of jade, upon the roof of which was the
faded remnants of an inscription. More to the point, there had
been carved on its side, and was as fresh to-day as when it left
the carver's hands, two thousand years before, the words:</p>

<p>"This is the secret of the philosopher."</p>

<p>He lifted the box and put it under his arm and made his way
back to Tillizinni.</p>

<p>"We can't leave yet," said the detective, all a-quiver with
excitement. He felt he was on the verge of a great discovery. "We
must find by what means this room is lighted."</p>

<p>Then he remembered the urgent business that waited in Tai
Pan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can come back," he said regretfully, for he knew
that when they had once passed through the portals they would
never again visit the last home of the First Emperor.</p>

<p>Talham led the way upward, and was within twenty feet of the
silver door when somebody laughed, and the laugh rang hollowly
through the vaulted chamber. He looked up. Before he was
conscious of what was happening and before his hand could drop to
the pistol at his side, a voice called mockingly:</p>

<p>"You have ample time to complete your investigations, Captain
Talham."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Soo, and it came from the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Talham and Tillizinni whipped out their revolvers and fired
together, and again came the laugh and something more
ominous&mdash;the rumble of a moving door.</p>

<p>They sprang up the stairs together, but before Talham could
swing himself through, the door had closed with a clang and a
crash. They were trapped in the house of the dead!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE YAMEN OF T'SI SOO</h2>

<p class="first">YVONNE YALE was in the little room which
overlooked the courtyard of the Governor's yamen. She sat on the
edge of the kang, her hands clasped on her knees, her face tense
and pale.</p>

<p>So this was the meaning of it&mdash;the meaning of that
telegram which had sent her flying across Europe into the
barbaric regions of Asia, that had set her down at a little
wayside station, where a polite and tidy escort waited to convey
her to her lover.</p>

<p>With no knowledge of the language, she had hesitated before
accompanying them, and had stood on the platform for half an hour
before she at last yielded to the agitated entreaties of the
officer in charge of the escort&mdash;a man with little English,
and who knew that his life depended upon his persuading the
beautiful Westerner to accompany him.</p>

<p>Why had not Talham come himself to receive her? The
officer-escort had been full of apologies and explanations in his
pidgin English. Captain Talham was honourably engaged, also he
had honourably hurt his foot digging and could not ride.</p>

<p>He had not sent her a line of welcome, which was strange, but
she had come so far, and it was absurd to shrink from the thirty
miles journey which she was promised.</p>

<p>A luxurious palanquin, borne upon mules and lined with rose
silk; was a tempting conveyance. The bottom of the shaky vehicle
was covered with down cushions. That novelty of the silken nest
pleased her.</p>

<p>An impassive bystander, watching the departure of the caravan,
sidled up on some pretext to where she sat and muttered under his
breath "Ko'lien," shaking his head the while.</p>

<p>She repeated it, "Ko'lien."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>The officer rode by her side and chatted with her in such
English as he could master.</p>

<p>It occurred to her, after they had gone some ten li on the
road, to ask carelessly the meaning of the words which the
strange Chinaman had employed.</p>

<p>"Ko'lien," repeated the escort with a beaming smile. "He mean
makee piecee solly."</p>

<p>"Makee piecee solly," she repeated. "So it meant I am sorry
for you! Why should he be sorry?"</p>

<p>Later she understood, and was sorry enough for herself.</p>

<p>Her destination was farther than thirty miles. They halted
that night at a village where rough but reasonable accommodation
was provided for her, and Hoo Sin was promised in the
morning.</p>

<p>But it was not until the evening of the next day, after hard
going, that they passed through the deserted streets of a big
city, and turned into a walled courtyard and came to a halt
before a handsome building.</p>

<p>She got out of the palanquin, stiff and aching. She was
feeling depressed and untidy, and in no mood to meet the man of
her choice.</p>

<p>They made it clear to her that she might go to her room, and
for this she was grateful.</p>

<p>Again there was no Talham, but the commander of the escort was
at pains to explain that possibly her lover would not be in till
later, and that he had not expected her arrival so soon.</p>

<p>She was shown to the room which she now occupied, a curious
little room filled with Western knick-knacks, and evidently
prepared for her. She had made her hurried toilet, and was
wondering exactly how she could summon the attendant, when the
door opened and a Chinaman walked into the room.</p>

<p>She saw at once that he was of a different class to the men
who had escorted her. His garments were of silk and beautifully
embroidered; his face was almost aesthetic, his mien lofty and
commanding.</p>

<p>"I hope you have everything you want," he said in perfect
English.</p>

<p>She gave a gasp of horror, for she recognised the voice of the
man in whose power she had been before.</p>

<p>He smiled genially, reading her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smoothing the breast of his silk jacket
delicately. "I am Soo T'si, whom your friends 'bottled up.'"</p>

<p>There was something in that expression which had been
particularly hateful to the man. His weakness lay in his vanity,
perhaps, and the implied reflection upon his inability to evade
the English police had rankled.</p>

<p>"Bottled up," he repeated, as with relish "and now I think I
have you 'bottled up' also."</p>

<p>"You must let me leave here at once," she said.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that cannot be done," he replied coolly. "You see,
you are not in Hoo Sin. You are in Tai Pan, which is my
particular stronghold, and where I hold certain rights which you
would describe as feudal. I owe you an apology," he went on, "for
telegraphing to you."</p>

<p>"Then it was you?" she said.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought you would have guessed that. Hoo Sin is some
distance," he went on, "and I am afraid your lover is pursuing
his warlike preparations in blissful ignorance of the fact that
some forty li away the lady of his heart is a prisoner in the
hands of his worst enemy."</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>What use was there in arguing with this man? Whatever was to
happen, no word of hers could move him to pity or to compassion.
She must face whatever had to be faced with all the courage which
God would give her in her extremity.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Soo did not prolong his visit. He made a few
enquiries as to whether she was comfortable, and left her, having
first brought into the room a Chinese girl who was to act as her
servant.</p>

<p>"I have decided what I shall do with you," was his parting
speech, "and you may be sure it will be something highly
entertaining."</p>

<p>For two long days, where every minute seemed an hour and every
hour a year, she was kept prisoner in the little room under the
roof of the Yamen. No indignity was offered to her. Her commands,
such as did not procure greater freedom of movement, were
instantly obeyed. Even her food was cooked in Western style by
Soo's own chef.</p>

<p>They called him Ho-Lao-Ae, "the river Mandarin," and the name
of Soo T'si seemed to be unknown to them. That he was a person of
the greatest importance she realised from the fear in which his
servants held him.</p>

<p>He had returned from Europe in time to quell a rebellion
against his father, a rebellion which had brought about the death
of his distinguished parent, and a multiplication of deaths
amongst other parents not so distinguished, for Soo punished
swiftly and terribly, and the execution ground outside the city
walls ran red with blood as the executioner wielded his long,
heavy sword.</p>

<p>On the third night of her arrival she was awakened by the
Chinese maid, who signalled to her to rise. The girl would have
dressed, but the servant snatched the clothes away.</p>

<p>"Puh pa" she said. ("You have nothing to fear.")</p>

<p>It was a conventional assurance, and the girl attached greater
significance to the phrase than it deserved.</p>

<p>She was allowed to put on her dressing-gown, and thrust her
feet into her slippers, and she followed the beckoning finger
through the door.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be gained by resistance as she saw, for
in the corridor outside were six men of the Yamen Guard.</p>

<p>With terror in her heart, but with her head erect, she
followed the serving-maid through what seemed innumerable
corridors until she came to a door before which hung a heavy
curtain of orange velvet. She had no idea as to what was the
time. Her own watch had stopped, but from the glimpse of sky she
caught as she passed a window, she thought it must be nearly
three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The servant pulled aside the portiere and knocked timidly on
the door, and a voice bade her enter.</p>

<p>Yvonne followed the girl. She was in a larger room than that
to which she was accustomed. It was hung around with Chinese
embroideries, the floor was of polished wood, and divans,
cushions, and little stools formed the only furniture in the
place, save for a few carved Buddhas and a huge hanging lamp
suspended from the ceiling. It was unlit, the only light in the
room being a small lamp placed on the floor within reach of
Soo.</p>

<p>He was there alone, but what caught her eye and held her was
something which stood in the very centre of the apartment.</p>

<p>It was a huge glass bottle, ten feet in height, and modelled
in the shape of a medicine bottle. That, in fact, was the design
which Soo had given to his artificers to cast.</p>

<p>The servant left her. The door closed with a click behind the
girl, and she was left alone confronting this man with his cruel;
smiling lips and his sly eyes. He was smoking a Chinese pipe and
was a model of comfort and self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you," he said, "because you represent the
last fragment of opposition offered to me in Europe, and I desire
that you shall be disposed of with the ceremony which the
occasion demands."</p>

<p>Planted against the bottle's neck was a light bamboo ladder;
inside, dangling from the top, and secured from the outside by a
ring fastened to the wall, was another ladder, a ladder of
silk.</p>

<p>He saw her wondering eyes surveying this, and smiled.</p>

<p>"When I was in Europe," he said cheerfully, "there was a
phrase employed which interested me more than ordinarily. It was
the phrase of 'bottled up.' Now, I have never seen any human
being so circumstanced."</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, choosing his words with great deliberation.
"And I am particularly anxious that this reproach should be
removed. You will mount those steps," he pointed to the ladder,
"and lower yourself gently to the bottom of the bottle. You will
notice that there is a down cushion upon which you may sit, and
you will probably find it most comfortable."</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse?" she said.</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"I think you will not refuse," he was very urbane, almost
gentle of speech&mdash; "but if you do refuse, I will promise you
that you shall be glad to have that bottle as a place of
refuge."</p>

<p>He uttered two words sharply. The doors at the farther end of
the apartment opened and four men came in naked to the
waist&mdash;great muscular coolies with scarcely any humanity in
their brutalised faces.</p>

<p>"Suppose," suggested Soo, "suppose, instead of putting you
into the bottle and disposing of you as I shall in an especially
novel fashion, I find a quicker death for you by handing you to
these cattle?"</p>

<p>Her hands went to her face.</p>

<p>"No, no no!" she shuddered.</p>

<p>At a nod from Soo the men departed.</p>

<p>"<i>Montez</i>!" said Soo mockingly, and she went up the
creaking ladder without hesitation.</p>

<p>It said much for the immense size and solidity of the bottle
that it did not budge under the strain of her weight. She sat for
a moment on the edge of the neck with her feet dangling in the
cavity where, in a bottle of ordinary dimensions, the cork would
be fixed.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Soo, and glanced at the door.</p>

<p>She lowered herself with hands that shook down the swaying
rope ladder, and came to rest on a cushion below.</p>

<p>She was in the room, but not of it. She saw Soo speaking but
did not hear his voice till quite a second later, when it had
travelled over the neck of the bottle and down to her. He came
across and gave a pull upon the silk ladder and withdrew it
flinging it down on the ground, and kicked the bamboo steps away.
He spoke again, and his servants removed the only means by which
she could escape.</p>

<p>She had to attune her ear to her strange position, and after a
while, when she had learnt to ignore the movements of his lips
and wait for the words to float down to her, she knew as well as
though no solid wall of glass was between them.</p>

<p>He was sitting cross-legged on a cushion, still smoking his
pipe. By and by he knocked the pipe out on to a little porcelain
tray and devoted the whole of his attention to her.</p>

<p>"You may wonder," he said, "why I have awakened you at this
inconvenient hour to begin a process which is to end your earthly
career."</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt," he said, "that you expected sooner or later
that your lover would learn of your unhappy plight and come
hastening across China like a modern knight-errant to your
rescue."</p>

<p>He spread out his hands in deprecation.</p>

<p>"Alas," he mocked, "your lover is not in a position to assist
you, and far less is he in a position to assist himself."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she was startled into asking, and her
voice sounded strange in that confined place.</p>

<p>"Alas," repeated Soo. "He sits in the house of the dead,
waiting for death."</p>

<p>She stared at him in horror.</p>

<p>He picked up another pipe and lit it from the tiny flame in
the smoke-box by his side.</p>

<p>"He discovered the secret of the Emperor's tomb, you will be
pleased to learn, and even penetrated its interior. I watched his
interesting operations for close on an hour and a half without
learning much, for the Emperor's tomb was known to me, and I
might have forestalled him."</p>

<p>He thought awhile.</p>

<p>"It was better that he should do the work," he said, "and that
I should have no more to do than to take the reward of his
industry. I watched him enter, he and his Italian friend, and
closed the door behind them. It was very simple, and was a matter
of inductive reasoning, for the pulling on one silver lamp would
open the door as the pulling on the second silver lamp would
close it, since the robbers must find some way of veiling from
the outside world the fact that they had been guilty of
sacrilege. So it proved. Waiting there in the darkness whilst
your friends were exploring the chamber below, I tested the
second lamp and found that the door moved slowly. A dozen steps
lay between them and liberty and life when I pulled with greater
strength, and the door closed upon those inquisitive
foreigners&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>Something in his tone told her that he was speaking the truth.
What hope was there now? In her heart of hearts she had depended
upon Talham discovering her capture. If he were dead, nothing
mattered. If all this man said was true, death could not come too
quickly on her.</p>

<p>She sat crouched at the bottom of the bottle, her hands
clasping her knees, her face fixed on his.</p>

<p>The end must come slowly if he spoke the truth. Soo was
looking above the bottle thoughtfully: his gaze was fixed. She
followed the direction of his eyes. From a round hole recently
cut in the ceiling suspended a thick silken rope which hung
directly over the mouth and came down to within a foot of
neck.</p>

<p>She had seen it before, and thought that it had placed there
to afford her assistance in making her into the bottle, whilst
the ladder was removed. and still remained.</p>

<p>Soo's voice came to her soothingly.</p>

<p>"I see you have noticed it. That cord will give you some
moments of interesting thought. Above this room is a smaller one,
and in that small chamber is a large cage," he said, "and in that
cage is a python. I presume you know what a python is. It is a
snake of unusual size, and, in this particular case, unusually
hungry. As to the habits of the python I am not well acquainted,
but I hope to discover much interesting data from a closer
observance than hitherto I have been able to secure."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>She saw the smile almost before she had heard the last
words.</p>

<p>"At your leisure"&mdash;he inclined his head&mdash;"you will
clap your hands three times, and my servants, who will be on duty
day and night, will release the reptile."</p>

<p>What did he mean?</p>

<p>She was soon to learn.</p>

<p>"I do not know what are the effects such confinement as yours
will have upon you," he said, "but I rather think that after the
end of twenty-four hours you may easily welcome the happy
release, even though it be in so unpleasant a form."</p>

<p>He sat watching her with the drowsy eyes of a man under the
influence of some narcotic. The sight of her fascinated him. All
that was Oriental in him, all that loved suffering for
suffering's sake, was alive to the possibilities which the
situation offered. He had planned this end for her with such
elaboration; and now found something wanting&mdash;something
dramatic, something sudden.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours was a long time, he might be sleeping when
she gave the signal. She might die of fright or of
exhaustion&mdash;these Western women were particularly fragile.
Through the glass walls of her prison she watched the man, saw
the curious look in his face, and knew instinctively that the
respite he had given her he had already taken away. Something
froze within her, her heart almost stopped beating as he raised
his hand.</p>

<p>"I do not think I can afford to wait," he said
apologetically.</p>

<p>He did not clap, for there came a slight knock at the door
through which she had entered. He turned his frowning face to the
portal.</p>

<p>"Come in" he said quickly in Chinese.</p>

<p>It might be a message from the Mandarin of Hoo Sin. It might
even be an Imperial rescript. The summons was not obeyed, and
then he remembered that he had dropped the bar across the
entrance.</p>

<p>He rose slowly and walked across the room and slipped the
lacquered bolt aside.</p>

<p>The sliding doors slipped apart, and Captain Talham stepped
into the room, a revolver in each hand.</p>

<p>This the girl saw, and fainted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; SOO "SAVES FACE"</h2>

<p class="first">LEFT alone in the darkness of the tomb the two
men stood motionless. Tillizinni was the first to realise the
awfulness of their position. None knew the secret of the door
save themselves.</p>

<p>The men at the foot of the hill, if they were not already
destroyed by Soo's soldiers, would wait til the morning, and then
with true Chinese philosophy would report the occurrence to the
Mandarin of Hoo Sin.</p>

<p>By that time the two pioneers would be dead.</p>

<p>There was very little air in the chasm, and apparently no
inlet. The door itself was almost hermetically sealed; they would
exhaust the supply which they had unconsciously brought in with
them in less than an hour. Talham was the first to recover
himself. He ran up the remainder of the steps until he came to
the blank wall of the silver door and carefully examined its face
with his lamp. The two edges of the door fitted in a flange, and
there was no place where a lever, even if they had possessed one,
could have found a purchase. As it happened, they had left all
their tools at the bronze door.</p>

<p>"Keep to the spirit steps," said Talham, "and go down below
again. We may find something there. I think you will have plenty
of opportunity, at any rate," he added grimly, "to discover the
lighting secret of this place."</p>

<p>Back they went again to the chamber of the dead. The little
quicksilver rivers were running merrily, as they had for two
thousand years, and they might run for all eternity until through
countless thousands of years the quicksilver became
volatised.</p>

<p>There were stacks of ancient arms placed near the stone door,
but none of these would be of any use to the men.</p>

<p>They made a diligent search for some other means of exit, but
in vain. There was no time to waste in purely scientific
exploration.</p>

<p>They had obviated the necessity for one of them standing on
the lower step, by lifting thereon one of the heavy irons which
stood at the four corners of the pedestal, and this weight was
apparently sufficient to keep the light going.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're caught," said Talham at last, and Tillizinni
nodded.</p>

<p>It was a curious end to all his extraordinary adventures, yet
if an end could be attractive, surely this was one, to go down in
this treasure-house of the past&mdash;to go out in the shadow of
the great Emperor's tomb.</p>

<p>A romancer to the finger-tips, Tillizinni found some
consolation in the prospect, but Talham was devoid of
sentiment.</p>

<p>"It isn't the death I mind," he said quietly; "but we ought
not to have come, we should have made straight for Yvonne. We
know she is in that fiend's power; how could I have been so mad
as to have neglected her for one moment&mdash;all the treasures
in the world were not worth it."</p>

<p>On one of the steps he had placed the jade box. He lifted it
up and looked at it resentfully, and raising it above his head he
sent it crashing down amongst the artificial landscape which
covered one half of the floor. The box burst and a roll of
parchment fell out.</p>

<p>"Leave it alone," said Talham roughly, "there is only one
thing in the world that counts."</p>

<p>He did not say what that one thing was, but Tillizinni
guessed. Another examination of the chamber offered no better
result. At the foot of the bier Tillizinni found a square box,
which he prised open without any difficulty. It was filled to the
brim with pearls of varying sizes from that of the average pea to
pearls as large as pigeons' eggs.</p>

<p>If only they could make their escape from here the box would
represent an enormous fortune.</p>

<p>If Talham despised the secret of the philosopher, here might
be some compensation for all his trouble if they made their
escape. The chances were very slight, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Tillizinni took a handful of the gems, and put them in the
loose pocket of his coat. He took another and another, until the
pocket bulged.</p>

<p>He made his way back with difficulty to where Talham stood by
the lower step. The air was getting foul, and he found a
difficulty in breathing; the end would come very soon&mdash;the
scientist in him told him that.</p>

<p>"Have you found anything?"</p>

<p>Talham did not answer.</p>

<p>He was looking stupidly at one of the two ornaments which
flanked the lower steps leading into the death chamber.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Talham nodded sleepily.</p>

<p>Tillizinni examined the object of his interest a little
closer.</p>

<p>It was one of the two huge birds of bronze. It seemed alive as
it stood there, balanced on one leg.</p>

<p>"I didn't notice those before," said Talham. Neither had the
other, a fact easily explained as they stood in the shadow cast
by the two great War Gods which towered left and right of the
tomb's entrance.</p>

<p>"I think this is where we go out," muttered Talham. His heart
was beating at a terrific rate; his head was swimming. He was
affected sooner than the smaller man, and staggered, and would
have fallen but for Tillizinni's arm.</p>

<p>"You had better sit down," said Tillizinni quietly.</p>

<p>He would take his own advice later; seated with his back to
the wall he would wait for death.</p>

<p>But Talham shook his head; he took a step and swayed, reached
out his hand to steady himself, and caught the bronze bird by the
neck.</p>

<p>He threw his head back suddenly.</p>

<p>"A pelican," he said thickly. "A pelican! my God! I didn't see
a pelican&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no other word. He threw all his weight upon the neck
of the bronze bird, and it bent down towards him as if working
upon an invisible pivot.</p>

<p>There was a rumble at the head of the stairs; a draught of
sweet, fresh air rushed down to the men, and Talham fell on his
hands and knees and breathed it in greedily.</p>

<p>"So that was it," he gasped. "Now, Soo, look out for me!" and
he went reeling up the stairs like a drunken man, Tillizinni
following.</p>

<p>They went out into the starlit night to find their patient men
still sitting in the gulley waiting for orders.</p>

<p>Whilst the men were mounting, Talham went back to the tomb
alone. He was absent for five minutes.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't we do something to hide the door?" asked Tillizinni.
"There will be an awful row when it is found open."</p>

<p>Talham turned on his saddle.</p>

<p>"It will be hidden in a minute," he said.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a dull, muffled roar which set the
horses prancing.</p>

<p>"I dynamited the first chamber," said Talham "That's the end
of the Emperor's tomb."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Soo stared blankly at the intruder, but he did
not lose his presence of mind.</p>

<p>"Captain Talham, I believe," he said. "How very interesting!"
He smiled at the stern-faced man before him.</p>

<p>"I had intended coming to-morrow to find your unhappy
bodies"&mdash;he saw Tillizinni at the entrance and nodded in a
friendly way&mdash;"and incidentally to help myself to such of
the treasures of the great Emperor's. May he dwell in the
seventeenth heaven for a million years"&mdash;he bowed his head
in mock reverence; "but that one pleasure, at least, is
deferred."</p>

<p>"All your pleasures are deferred," said Talham sternly. "You
will never again discover the tomb of the dead
Emperor&mdash;neither you nor any other man. The outer chamber
has ceased to be."</p>

<p>Soo lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he said incredulously.</p>

<p>"I have dynamited the entrance," said Talham in his thorough
way. "That ends the business of the Emperor's tomb,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then it was that he saw the bottle. The room was in half
darkness as he had entered; only one faint light showed, and this
was beside the place where Soo had sat.</p>

<p>The reflection of the light upon the polished face of the
glass prevented him from seeing its interior. He took a step
forward.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said. "Yvonne!"</p>

<p>He turned and pointed the revolver at the other's head. His
face was white and drawn.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he said.</p>

<p>"She is not dead&mdash;she is alive," said Soo quickly.</p>

<p>"Alive!" Talham dropped his revolver.</p>

<p>"For the moment, yes," said Soo, and clasped his hands.</p>

<p>Talham heard the shriek of the girl, saw the wild agony in her
face, and realised that this was a signal for some act of
treachery. But it was Tillizinni who saw the dangling rope, and
heard the rustle of a heavy body moving on the floor above. It
was Tillizinni who saw the wedge-shaped head with the cruel, cold
eyes peep down through the hole and stretch out its sinuous body
towards the rope.</p>

<p>He knew instantly the significance of that dangling cord.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried, and threw the whole of his weight against
the bottle. It slid over the polished floor a dozen paces.</p>

<p>"Stop him!" said Tillizinni.</p>

<p>Soo was making for the door. He turned when the revolvers were
levelled, and lifted his hands.</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble," he said.</p>

<p>Even in that moment of his deadly peril he did not lose his
nerve. He seemed to take a delight in recalling the suavities of
his Western veneer.</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared to stand my trial before the Imperial
Court for anything I have done," he said. "In the meantime, will
you allow me to summon my men to assist your friend from her
distressing position?"</p>

<p>"We will do without the servants," said Tillizinni. "Get some
of those cushions, quick!"</p>

<p>They laid three thicknesses of down cushions before the
bottle, the way it would fall.</p>

<p>Then Tillizinni deftly wedged the front and the two men threw
their weight on it. It fell over unbroken, and the girl dragged
her way out.</p>

<p>"Take her outside," said Tillizinni, and Talham lifted the
half-fainting figure and bore her from the room along the
deserted corridors to the little courtyard behind, where his men
were waiting.</p>

<p>The Yamen was wrapped in slumber; Soo had given orders that he
was not to be disturbed that night, and beyond a watchman who had
been at the gate, but who was now no longer in a position to
hinder the party, there was none to say them nay.</p>

<p>Tillizinni confronted Soo T'si, and if ever there were two men
in the world competent to deal with one another in that extreme
crisis, they were those two, who now stood face to face.</p>

<p>Ever and anon, Tillizinni's eyes would go up to the little
round hole in the roof. He had recognised the head the moment he
had seen it, and knew that the python was searching for food in
the room above, until, in his desperation, he took the more
desperate step of descending the rope.</p>

<p>"Soo T'si," said Tillizinni gently, "you will find it much
easier to get into the bottle than, I gather, did Miss Yale."</p>

<p>"It is possible," said the Chinaman coolly; "but it is not an
experiment that I care to make."</p>

<p>"It is an experiment," said Tillizinni in the same tone,
"which I shall ask you to make, for if you do not do as I tell
you, I shall most certainly shoot you."</p>

<p>Soo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You should have been a Chinaman," he said.</p>

<p>"I am of the race," said Tillizinni carefully, "which produced
the Borgias, and some of the most refined torturers of the Holy
Inquisition. Enter your bottle, my friend!" he said. "I wish to
see you bottled up in reality. You will find the place cramped,
but you will probably be able to bear the indignity of it much
easier than the delicate and refined English lady whom we have
just released."</p>

<p>"I will do anything," said Soo, "save sacrifice my
dignity."</p>

<p>His eyes followed the other to a little aperture in the roof.
The head of the python was hanging down now; his hateful eyes
surveyed them.</p>

<p>"I see your idea," said Soo pleasantly. "I think I know a
better way. A Chinaman must 'save face,' you know!"</p>

<p>His hands were concealed under his silken jacket. Tillizinni
could not see the man searching for the razor-like knife which he
carried at his waistband, nor the firm fingers of the suicide
feeling for the little place under the heart which, skilfully
pierced, brings an easy death. Only he saw the face go suddenly
grey.</p>

<p>"Au 'voir," said Soo in French. "I like this way better."</p>

<p>He fell in a heap on the ground, and looked up with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Pardon&mdash;me!" he said, smiling faintly&mdash;and
died.</p>

<p>So Tillizinni left him, with the head of the python looking
hungrily down on the quiet figure below. So Tillizinni thinks of
this man now, and often sees him at night&mdash;a smiling,
fearless figure of a villain.</p>

<p>And when all the lights are lit upon the Embankment, and
Tillizinni leans out of his window watching the dark river and
the flaming lamps of London, he looks westward and tries to
picture Captain Talham a happy, domesticated man in his Surbiton
home, with his motor-cars and his race horses and all the good
things of life which the Emperor's pearls had brought to him.</p>

<p>Somehow Tillizinni fails to reconcile those two men. The
Talham who held the fort of Hoo Sin against the armed soldiery of
Tai Pan come to avenge their lord; the Talham who made the wild
flight across China to the link of civilisation which the
Siberian railway afforded, with the Talham who now discusses
poultry and pigs with such earnestness and volubility.</p>

<p>"For my part," wrote Tillizinni in his diary, "I would as lief
be buried alive in the tomb under Mount Li, as be buried alive in
a suburb of London."</p>

<p>It is, of course, a matter of opinion.</p>
