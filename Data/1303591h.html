  <p class="blurb">Mr. Wells' job is to think. He has been doing it now for
  nearly half a century, and it is disturbing to see how often he has been
  right. In this book he has been thinking about the war-why we are fighting,
  what will happen when it is over, what practical aims we can set ourselves,
  and how we can still look forward to organising a world in which wars will
  not perpetually recur until the human race has bombed itself out of
  existence. He believes that it is stiIl possible, but only if we throw over
  many of our old prejudices,. and make clear at once the principles on which
  we intend to act.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec1"
     name="sec1">§ 1. &mdash; GROWN MEN DO NOT NEED LEADERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the greater part of my life I have given most of my
  working time to the problem of the human future, studying the possibility of
  a world-wide reorganisation of human society that might avert the menace of
  defeat and extinction that hangs over our species. That has been my leading
  preoccupation since I published <i>The Time Machine</i> in 1893. I have never
  thought, much less have I asserted, that progress was inevitable, though
  numerous people chose to fancy that about me. I have always maintained that
  by a strenuous effort mankind might defeat the impartial destructiveness of
  nature, but I have always insisted that only by incessant hard thinking and a
  better co-ordination of man's immense but dispersed powers of self-sacrifice
  and heroism was such a victory possible.</p>

  <p>Since the present crisis began to develop I have done everything I could,
  to focus the thinking of a lifetime upon the stormy clashes of to-day. I have
  studied and spoken and written and published, to get reality clear in my own
  and as many minds as possible. In this little book I am trying again to
  assemble the essential truth about what is happening, as concisely and
  clearly as possible. This is, to the best of my ability, a map of where we
  are and how we can go. Not only where we are, I repeat, but how we can go. I
  am writing it down without exhortation or any emotional appeal. That, if you
  want It, you must seek elsewhere. If you are one of those who <i>prefer</i>
  to go On with life with a magic talisman in your hand instead of a map, this
  book is not for you. But if you like to carry a blessed image or a mascot in
  your pocket I will not quarrel with you, if only you have the sense to rely
  upon the map instead of trying to muddle your way through when the bearings
  of the situation are plain.</p>

  <p>Since I began to learn about the direction of human affairs, I have been
  much afilicted by would-be disciples and followers. Before I took my own
  measure I did occasionally entangle myself with groups of people who proposed
  to take possession of me, interpret me and make something between a
  figure-head and a leader of me. These entanglements taught me one thing very
  clearly, that "leadership" is entirely incompatible with the clear and
  critical apprehension of how things are and where things are, which is the
  natural activity of such a mind as mine. You might just as well expect a
  chart and compass to steer a ship. I found out very early in life, not only
  that I could not "manage" people, but that I disliked in about equal measure
  the concessions and deceptions that are involved in managing anyone, and the
  tiresome people who obliged me to make those politic adjustments of the truth
  necessary to keep them in tow. I despise driven sheep, I despise dogs tha.t
  fawn upon me, I despise followers and disciples, I despIse the " simple faith
  " and " unquestioning loyalty" of human beings who ought, I feel, to think
  and act for themselves instead of sacrificing the brief opportumtIes this
  life affords them of being real.</p>

  <p>Read me, I would say, use all I have to give you, assimilate me to
  yourself (and assimilation may very well mean a digestive change and
  improvement) and we will go on together in fraternal co-operation, but
  please, please, do not imagine you are being invited to line up behind me.
  You have a backbone and a brain; your brain is as important as mine and
  probably better at most jobs; my only claim on your consideration is that I
  have specialised in trying to get my Outlines true.</p>

  <p>That is the spirit in which I call myself a republican, a democrat and an
  adult man.</p>

  <p>It is a biological truism that the majority of our species retains
  infantile characteristics throughout life; most men and women never grow up
  at all. Most animals settle down, but human beings can play and be curious at
  seventy. Men and women of eighty can die young. This has its good but also
  its profoundly enfeebling side, if you remain not young but infantile. Most
  of our kind pass from the knee of mothers, who tell them what and how, to the
  schoolmaster or mistress, the priest, the big boys (or girls) in the school,
  their caste, the employer, the political adventurer, all telling them what
  and how before they are allowed a sceptical moment. Directly they come to the
  frustrations and distresses of our disordered social life, leadership touts
  for them, exploits them and enslaves them. We have now in Mein Kampf a
  complete expose of the art of leadership, and in the stricken lands of the
  great offensive, we have seen these poor methodical, gullible, German
  lout-sheep pouring forward in their multitudes to destroy horribly or be
  destroyed. It is like a flight of locusts; it is a stampede. One has to kill
  them or be killed, because reason would be wasted on them.</p>

  <p>In Britain, America, France and what are called the sroaner democratic
  countries, we have a number of more or less ridiculous figures proposing
  themselves for leadership after the fashion of Mussolini and Hitler. Every
  antic of these masters is aped. But there is in all our countries, thanks to
  certain accidents of their past history, a capacity for derision and
  individual initiative that makes the careers of these aspirants to dominance'
  difficult. It is a type which ought of course to be shot when it makes itself
  plainly dangerous. Huey Long, whom I met and found very attractive in America
  was,I think, very properly murdered. Our Parliamentary forefathers made
  treason to the people a capital offence. It might very well be the only
  capital offence. There is no other crime so evil. If it were possible to
  express this present world conflict in one phrase which it certainly is not-"
  The struggle of the free men against the led men," might be as serviceable as
  any.</p>

  <p>The infantile belief that it is possible for one single individual to
  concentrate will and understanding for a whole people may be best disposed of
  by a very simple set of considerations. I would call it "counting the hours
  of a man's life." I would ask you to take anyone to whom you may be disposed
  to submit yourself and reduce the total of his life to hours. It comes to no
  very great total. Then deduct from that the hours that must have been spent
  in sleep, in eating and drinking and in what is called recreation. That will
  about halve your total. Now take off the years of infancy. Then enquire into
  the history of your divinity. He went to such and such a school, he had
  access to what books? All schools waste a certain amount of time; no
  worth-while book is read without difficulty. And a man who is to cut a figure
  in the world must act as well as learn. I was led to this sort of enquiry
  when I set myself to work out the maximum number of hours available for
  impartmg knowledge to youngsters between tbe ages of five and sixteen.* When
  everything else has been allowed for it works out to a total that is
  astoundingly small. I was so struck by this realisation that I set myself a
  number of problems in history. Always I sought to determine the quality of
  the sources of knowledge available and the maximum number of hours the
  individual under examination could have given to the matter under discussion.
  What could Alexander the Great have known of the Persian and Indian worlds
  into which he led his raiders, what was his vision of the world he splashed
  with new cities, had he the remotest idea of the gathering Romans in his
  rear? What can Stalin know of the social and cultural realities of the
  Western world, against which he guards himself with such dire suspicion? What
  can the Pope, any Pope, know of the great concepts of modem biology? You will
  realise that every one of us, even the most receptive, is a blinkered man.
  There are certain things he may know well, but the better he knows those
  definite things, the less he can know of matters outside the limits of his
  specialisation. A man may guide you unerringly up Mont Blanc. That is no
  reason why you should expect him to steer you through the traffic of New York
  City. These leaders and enslavers of men are fabulous creatures. They are
  pretenders and impostors. There are no such people.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See "World Brain!"</p>

  <p>I write these introductory disavowals to the reader in order that the
  purpose of this book should be perfectly plain. You are being led nowhere in
  this little book; you are being shown certain definite things. Certain
  interpretations of what is happening will be put before you, and it is for
  you to decide whether these interpretations are true or false. Certain
  possible roads will be shown to you and whither they lead. If your leader or
  your colonel or your priest or anyone to whose hands you have entrusted your
  mental conscience tells you not to trouble about the reasoning with which I
  challenge you, and you take his word for it, I can do no more for you. Or if
  some bright young Communist, for example, after the pattern of those absurd
  young "students" I met at Leeds the other day, students who listened to
  nothing and were obviously incapable of study, persuades you that I have
  produced all this carefully thought out discussion for some obscure and
  sordid motives of my own, and that therefore you are absolved from thinking
  about it, then again I I can only shrug my shoulders. Suppose, as he will
  imply, that publishing a Penguin book brings me wealth beyond the dreams of
  avarice, does that in itself make the arguments I put before you, any the
  less sound?</p>

  <p>And so to our discussion.</p>

  <p>But first let me repeat the headline of this section and add two
  additional sentences. <i>Grown Men do not need Leaders. But that does not
  mean that they will not trust a properly accredited equal who has some
  specific gift or function. You trust your plumber, your doctor, your cook,
  your automobile scout, your Ordnance Map, conditionally, without either
  arrogance or subservience.</i></p>

  <h2><a id="sec2"
     name="sec2">§ 2. &mdash; CAN ANY PEACE BE MADE NOW?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS present warfare differs from all previous warfare in
  many respects. To others of these I will call your attention later, but here
  I would concentrate upon the difficulty created by the absolute unreliability
  of these Totalitarian States.</p>

  <p>The world is full of warfare. We in this country are spending seven or
  eight million pounds a day, I gather, on the war. It is not only costing us
  seven or eight million pounds a day. In spite of everything that sincere
  supporter of the present monetary system, Mr. Maynard Keynes, may say or do,
  this war plainly means bankruptcy and inflation within quite a reasonable
  time. In quite a little while we may find money in our pockets that will
  practically buy nothing. So far as I can see, all the gold in the world is
  gravitating now to the vaults of the United States of America. When it is all
  safely interred there, America may be considered to have won the Gold
  Standard game. I presume that then the rest of the world will have to work
  out a new system for exchanging labour and commodities. We shall still have
  our hands, our heads, our land and our raw materials, and we are not likely
  to starve quietly because all these things are mortgaged to a remote
  creditor.</p>

  <p>But how to re-animate those lands and that material is likely to be a
  difficult and contentious process. It is a matter that our experts in
  business management should be doing now, most urgently. They should be making
  schemes for barter and a new and independent exchange system now. It may not
  be necessary, but it is highly advisable to have it ready and thought out. So
  far as I know, nothing of the sort is being done, and in our careless British
  fashion we are likely to be caught by this problem unawares, and undergo all
  the stress and suffering that unpreparedness entails. Not only here but all
  over Europe a progressive social disorganisation is plainly apparent; day by
  day we can see things getting worse, education being disorganised and
  demoralised, the standard of living sinking, freedom dwindling. The first
  question, therefore, we have to put to ourselves is: Is it possible to get
  any peace now? What sort of peace can we possibly have at the present time?
  We have read speeches and articles by Mr. Lloyd George advocating a peace
  settlement as soon as possible. Mr. C. R. Buxton issued a booklet, <i>The
  Case for an Early Peace</i>. Lord Beaverbrook, before his change of heart,
  urged it in his papers. But ask these people: "Is it a peace that would allow
  us to disarm?"</p>

  <p>"No," they will say: "we must keep armed to the teeth." Is it a peace that
  would lift in any way that apprehension of sudden attack which broods upon
  all the world to-day? No such peace is conceivable at present. Anything you
  could call a peace would be so insecure that it would still cost almost as
  many millions pound a day and do nothing material to arrest the progressive
  dislocation of. our lives. The balloon barrages would still have to keep in
  the sky and the troops under arms. Such a peace would be a mere technical
  change of no practical importance at all. Instead of being technically at war
  as we are now, we should be technically at peace, as China and Japan are at
  peace now. When England and France declared war last September, they started
  something that it is going to be excessively difficult to stop. Even Mr.
  Chamberlain has observed that it is a new sort of war altogether. I believe
  we are all in practical agreement about that.</p>

  <p>Let us ask then: what is the real nature of this strange, new-fashioned
  war which we are so incapable of ending in any etfettive way? We must exert
  our minds to answer that. Obviously, we cannot make any hopeful plans for
  restoring order to the world until we know the real nature of its disorder.
  Do we know?--are we clear on this matter?</p>

  <p>I suggest we are not. Weare all ridiculously at sixes and sevens, because
  so many people, who set up to be leaders of thought, prefer to be eloquent
  and demonstrative when they ought to <i>think</i>. At present one can hear of
  a fantastic variety of views about what is hapPening. Only one set of them
  can be right. Shall we try to find out what that right set of answers is?
  What, in the broadest terms, is happening to the world?</p>

  <p>I want to ask J Are we fighting against anything definite at all? You will
  hear it constantly repeated that this is "a war of ideologies." You will hear
  about the Totalitarian State, National-Socialism, Bolshevism; and you will
  hear it stated and implied that these are new and more complicated methods of
  State organisation that are coming into existence, that the "individual" is
  to be subordinated to these new elaborate State systems, and that the present
  struggle is a struggle to preserve our individual freedom and self-respect
  from envelopment in this serpent of the Totalitarian State.</p>

  <p>Either this is true or it is not true-I submit that it is not true.</p>

  <p>I am going to ask a very simple question indeed: <i>Do any of these States
  really exist at all?</i> Is there such a thing as a Totalitarian State in
  being? Is there a National-Socialist State? Is there now anything in the
  nature of a responsible working system that you can call Bolshevism? Is there
  any sort of definite working social organisation anywhere corresponding to
  any of these words?</p>

  <p>If these things are in existence, if these alleged new and more elaborate
  State organisations are living realities in our world, then they must consist
  almost entirely of people who have definite places in them; people who have
  specific jobs; people who know they are safe if they do their jobs properly;
  people as sure in their actions as cog-wheels in a watch, knowing clearly how
  they stand to one another, knowing clearly how this wonderful new organised
  State, in which they live and move and have their being, stands towards all
  the rest of the world. We must in fact be face to face with a higher, more
  complicated order, with a shape and a character and a mind of its own with
  which we can deal. It will have a character with which we can negotiate and
  upon which we can rely.</p>

  <p>Well, where is there such a living "ideology" in operation? Where is that
  higher organisation? Our politicians and journalists reach out in search of
  such a system, and do they find anything of the sort? I suggest that nowhere
  on earth do these things, Totalitarianism, National-Socialism, Bolshevism,
  exist, and that when distinguished writers and radio talkers call this "a war
  of ideologies," they are talking nonsense. They are talking about
  intellectual fantasies and phantoms infinitely remote from the grim realities
  which crowd upon us.</p>

  <p>Bolshevism, I admit, did at one time seem to contain the promise of a
  system of constructive ideas. Twenty years ago, when I had the privilege of
  talking to Lenin, I found that fine, valiant and subtle intelligence
  entangled in the beard of Karl Marx, and doing its best to struggle out of
  that huge fuzz to real constructiveness. But he was learning the job from the
  ground up! He was reading Chiozza Money's <i>Electrification of Holland</i>,
  of all books! and he was full of a scheme for the electrification of
  Russia-which rather overlooked the relative difference in the distances
  between centres in the two countries and the consequent cost in copner
  cables. I have described the talk I had with him in Russia in the Shadows,
  and in that book you will find I foretold clearly the devastating danger of
  Marxist planlessness-pIanlessness and dogmatism.</p>

  <p>"Come again," said Lenin, "in ten years' time." Six years ago I did go
  again to see what was happening in Russia, and then I had the privilege of
  talking to Stalin. That talk also is on record.* I wanted to know the
  structure of the new society he was producing to work Bolshevism. What was
  its character, its spirit, its working organisation?</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Published as a pamphlet by <i>The New
  Statesman</i>.</p>

  <p>I had just come from America. The New Deal was being crippled in America
  for want of a competent Civil Service. What was Russia doing? I hoped rather
  than expected to find Russia one vast Civil Service falling into order. I
  found nothing of the sort. I found in Russia no development of any securely
  ordered society whatever, no system in which a man could do his job without
  fear, in which he knew where he stood, in which one man could trust another
  and speak fearlessly to him, no society in which there was any real
  developing social structure. In certain material particulars Russia had
  progressed with the rest of the world, but not nearly so fast as the rest of
  the world, and chiefly by importing American notions, tractors and so forth.
  The only organisation that had developed was the secret police and personal
  espionage. Russia was no more a new social order in 1934 than it had been in
  1920. It was less so. It was plainly relapsing into autocracy.</p>

  <p>In a recent publication, Sir Nevile Henderson has told how he went to
  Germany to find a Germany with which this country could deal. And what report
  has he brought back? Nothing but gossip about personalities, nothing but talk
  about individuals, how, like the present British Foreign Minister, Lord
  Halifax, he shot with Goering and gossiped with Goebbels, and what fine
  fellows they all were together; gossip and nothing else-and why?</p>

  <p>Because manifestly there was no National-Socialist State there for him to
  deal with, nothing but forceful groups and individuals, incalculable because
  there was neither law nor ideas to control them. So far from any State, new
  order, or National Socialism having triumphed over the individual, the truth
  manifest in his revelations is that groups and individuals had triumphed over
  any system whatever, and that National-Socialism, like the Totalitarian
  State, and like, I am afraid, Bolshevism at the present time, was just
  theoretical eyewash for a purely individualistic control.</p>

  <p>The truth is not that the State has suppressed the individual in Germany,
  but that forcible and entirely irresponsible individuals have captured the
  State. Trotsky, in his published denunciation of Stalin, witnesses to the
  same thing in Russia. He presents the Government of Russia as Henderson
  presents the Government of Germany, as entirely a handful of individuals,
  running amok in a steadily disintegrating commumty.</p>

  <p>That, I suggest, is the essential difficulty of our situation. There is
  nothing there to make peace with. You cannot make peace with disorder.
  Disorder, gang tyrannies, a collapse into a brigand world; that is what we
  fight <i>against</i>! And now let us ask ourselves what we are fighting
  <i>for</i>.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="sec3"
     name="sec3">§ 3. &mdash; WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE question of what we and our Allies are fighting for is a
  difficult one. If we are not fighting against some new, strange and evil way
  of life, but only against gangster violence on a monstrous scale, then it
  seems that our war must be primarily a defensive one. But is it altogether a
  defensive one?</p>

  <p>Official sources seem uncertain about that. Even Lord Halifax in his more
  exalted moments talks vaguely of a new and better order that is to emerge
  from this war. In that case we are not primarily on the defensive at all; we
  are fighting for a new order in the world. But is this merely what is called
  an "inspiriting" utterance? Useful in war time but of no subsequent value? I
  am reminded of Mr. Lloyd George's "Land fit for Heroes" in-was it 1917 or
  1919? Let us probe a little deeper into this question. Because plainly it is
  a quite fundamental question for us and our allies and our adversaries and
  the neutral States of the world. Are we fighting to save an old order, the
  stately homes of England, the huntin', the fishin', or are we honestly
  fighting to make a new world? Sooner or later our rulers and representatives
  must come clear upon this point. They do not do that now. Their propaganda
  has a bafflng flavour of insincerity. Our Foreign Office has to speak out and
  tell the world its War Aims, and so far it has failed to speak out and do
  that. Until their Governments do that, the Allies remain ambiguous and
  perplexing even to those who would be their associates and friends. The
  present Churchill government is manifestly a provisional government, torn
  internally by this conflict between the ideas of a defensive and of a
  creative war. Are we fighting to keep or to make?</p>

  <p>Many of us still hope to see still more creative governments than exist at
  present, both in Britain and France. Meanwhile let us go on clearing up our
  minds. Let us ask therefore, What is the reality on our side, we who are
  fighting against these gangs and groups of individuals who, with such
  manifest insincerity, are professing to be new social systems? Are we so very
  different? What is our reality? What is this Western Civilisation of ours for
  which we are asked to take every conceivable risk, for which we are asked to
  make every possible sacrifice? There again we find people all giving the most
  completely contradictory accounts of what we stand for. Surely we have to
  clear these contradictions out of the way? One account must be right and the
  rest wrong. If you will read a booklet called <i>The British Case</i> (a
  ninepenny Government publication I commend to your most earnest study) you
  will learn that our present Minister for Foreign Affairs lends his name to
  the assertion that we are fighting not simply for the Birtish Empire
  throughout the world, but for the Christian religion. We are fighting a
  religious war for Catholicism. Inspired utterances in high quarters echo this
  assertion. It is a "Crusade." But do many Christians really believe this is a
  war of religion? Did our boys who went to be exposed to overwhelming numbers
  in Belgium, ill-equipped and betrayed by that Belgian King who must have been
  educated so badly at Eton, did they really march to the tune of <i>Onward
  Christian Soldiers</i>? Were they really fighting to make the world safe for
  Bishops and Eton boys? From this appalling document you will be able to Judge
  how much Lord Halifax (i.e. the British Foreign Office) cares for the
  hardships of the Jews in the concentration camps or the restoration of
  slavery in Central Europe. . His mind is largely early-Kipling, Stalky and
  Co., With a strong dash of Eric, or Little by Little. The greater part of the
  British Empire, you will realise, is still, from the point of view of Lord
  Halifax and his associates, no more than "the lesser breeds within the law."
  "Asiatics," for example, like the Aga Khan, are put in their places in this
  great missionary enterprise upon which we are engaged. What our Turkish
  Allies think of this war for the Church of England I cannot imagine. Do we
  English as a main objective in this war really want to shove our religion and
  our gentry down the throats of all man kind? This canting stuff is far below
  the liberal British Imperialism of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>Yet our people fight, and we fight with a sense of rightness. The
  diffused, unorganised popular mentality of the British people is far higher
  than that of the governing and political ciasses. What is it we fight for? I
  think most of our soldiers and common people will be in agreement that we are
  fighting for something very much greater than any Empire. Something far
  beyond the cramped ideas of that dismal pamphlet, something we may all agree
  in speaking of as democratic civilisation. We feel that we have a reality in
  that, a reality that justifies our appeal to world opinion, against our
  antagonists.</p>

  <p>Nowadays you will encounter the most diverse statements about this
  "democratic civilisation" of ours. And the curious thing is that all these
  diverse ideas have a certain plausibility. They involve no irreconcilable
  contradictions. One man will say that democratic civilisation is an expansion
  of medieval Christendom; another will present it as a natural development of
  the GraecoRoman culture; Marxists, perhaps rather nearer actuality, will
  declare we are living in the last stages of the Capitalist System; and others
  will talk of the peculiar geographical advantages of Britain or of Europe,
  and the peculiar energy of the northern peoples, which gave our Western
  Civilisation the leadership of the world. I suggest to you that all these
  ideas have factors of truth in them, but that none of them is the whole
  truth; that the reality of our Western Civilisation is a vast complex of
  traditions, usages, rules, laws, dominations and devices; which at the
  opening of the present century did in effect dominate the whole world. It
  was, I suggest, a vast growth, a happy concatenation of accidents, containing
  no guarantee of its permanence.</p>

  <p>And now, because the forces that assembled it have ebbed, and new
  unanticipated forces have come into destructive activity, it has ceased to
  dominate the world.</p>

  <p>One aspect of this dominant Western Civilisation of the nineteenth century
  was the universal validity of the gold sovereign. I would call your
  particular attention to that. When the history of our times comes to be
  written, I think historians will be disposed to call it the Gold Standard
  Age, or the Age of Investments.</p>

  <p>It produced a definite way of life and a way of thinking of its own. I
  shall try presently to define the characteristics of that distinctive culture
  in a brief section on the Blue Swastika and the downward class war of the
  Rentier type.</p>

  <p>Prosperous people, during that phase of monetary domination, distributed
  their savings, and felt sure of their dividends, levied their tribute in
  fact, from China to Peru. With a passport and a letter of credit they could
  go in comparative freedom and safety all over the world. Throughout that
  phase, in spite of much social injustice and oppression, slums, sweating,
  exploitation there was a working order in the world, that gave a fortunate
  minority at least, but, be it noted, a considerable and increasing minority,
  security and a fairly hopeful life. There was real progress and ample
  justification for optimism.</p>

  <p>I won't attempt to analyse the forces that created this transient world
  domination, this Golden Age of the investor. I don't think historians have
  ever attempted to make any proper estimate of those forces. The repeated
  discovery of new gold deposits had a lot to do with it. But towards the end
  of the Victorian era, something happened. That phase passed its climax. What
  was it happened?</p>

  <p>I suggest that what happened was that this huge complex of Westernised
  Civilisation began to fall to pieces, <i>through the operation of novel and
  entirely unforeseen forces</i> which I will examine a little later, and also
  I suggest that nothing has yet appeared to restore or replace that complex.
  If so, then we are not faced with a conflict of two types of State or
  anything of that sort-we are in the presence of one single world system which
  is breaking down, this wild German belligerence aiming at power and power
  only, is part of the breakdown, and nothing whatever has appeared yet to
  replace this collapsing order. <i>Which will therefore go on
  collapsing.</i></p>

  <p>We are fighting confusedly and we may fight unsucc:ssfully because our
  minds are divided. We all fight against the blind conquest drive of Nazidom.
  But that is merely fighting a symptom. Some of us are scrabbling to preserve
  the collapsing order at any cost; while on the other hand an increasing
  number are only too anxious to get rid of the old order and lay the
  foundations of a new one. The two conceptions are incompatible. We cannot
  have it both ways. We have to make our choice. Is this a war to salvage a
  world manifestly far gone in decay, or is it a vast tragic clearance for a
  new order? The only answer with hope in it is the latter alternative. Let me
  now do my best to make this half-instinctive, creative war aim, definite and
  acceptable.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="sec4"
     name="sec4">§ 4. &mdash; ONLY WORLD REVOLUTION CAN END WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND here I come to something still more vital and
  fundamental, about which I think all men of good will should come to a common
  understanding. Either you have to declare that what I am now going to say is
  misstated or altogether untrue-or I do not see how you can avoid making it
  the basis of your interpretation of our difficulties. I do not apologise for
  stressing this, because matters are too urgent for genteel
  understatement.</p>

  <p>I encounter an extraordinary inability on the part of earnest,
  peace-seeking people to incorporate the realities I am putting before you
  with their always amiable and earnest proposals. I do all I can to keep those
  ideas before them. I write my propositions in capital letters. I state the
  truth gently but persistently, and they smile and disregard it; I put the
  idea to them insultingly; they seem pained by my manners and they pass on as
  though nothing had been said. I cannot persuade them to treat these
  fundamental verities as primary facts in our world problem.</p>

  <p>Their resistance to these ideas is, I think, due mainly to the way they
  have read and been taught history. Old-fashioned history is saturated with
  the idea that there is nothing new under the sun, kings and empires come and
  go but there are always more kings and empires, and you cannot change human
  nature. But Science disentangled our minds from that dull belief in routine
  and assures us that under the sun every morning the day is a new day. People
  are so saturated in the old-fashioned conception of history that they are
  impervious to the recognition of any fundamental change in human conditions.
  Why, I ask, will people go on discussing the riddle of peace upon an
  historical basis, in historical terms, that are superseded?</p>

  <p>The bedrock realities upon which all our ideas of social and political
  policy must now rest, are, I assert, as follows:</p>

  <p><b>A complete biological revolution has happened to our species. There
  has, in the past half century, been a complete reversal of the conditions
  under which human beings have to live. A tremendous development of invention
  and discovery has swung us round, in less than half a century, from need to
  possible abundance, and from remoteness to unavoidable contact.</b></p>

  <p>One most obvious result of that development has been to bring all the
  people of the world together upon each other's doorsteps. This is spoken of
  generally as the abolition of distance, and this abolition of distance is
  something that has made every national, sovereign state in the world too
  small for contemporary conditions. Let me repeat these words. <i>They are too
  small for contemporary conditions.</i> But there they are!</p>

  <p>There has also been an incredible increase in power and productive
  capacity. It is now a simple statement of fact that we could have a world of
  universal prosperity, if we had peace. That was not true half a century
  ago.</p>

  <p>There has been a tremendous release of energy, and the present political,
  social and economic organisation of the world gives no scope for its
  utilisation except in destructive violence and war.</p>

  <p><b>*</b> And here I put a star to direct your attention to what is surely
  the very central factor in our present complications. <i>It is not only
  mechanical energy that is set free, but human energy of a most urgently
  restless type, in the form of great numbers of restless unemployed young
  men.</i> These supply the driving force for the Hooligan, the Nazi, Fascist,
  Communist, the I.R.A. movements that are everywhere tearing our social order
  to pieces; and until we find a way out of this incessant revolt and conflict
  that will turn the human energy into creative channels, matters will go on
  from bad to worse, war will go on from bad to worse.</p>

  <p>We have to adapt ourselves to these new conditions, or, like every other
  species which does not adapt itself to new conditions, we have to perish. Now
  here I have stated what I believe to be the gist of the present human
  problem. For consider: what we call war to-day is not war as history has
  known it. It is a different thing. Its destructive effect is immeasurably
  greater. It is now a truism that if we do not end war, war will end us.</p>

  <p>Nor is the competitive hunt for profit and dividends the same tolerable
  process that it was in the past. I find few people rea1ise how much of our
  business exploitation to-day is a wastage of resources that can never be
  replaced. Few people realise the destructiveness of business competition
  nowadays. Because of this change in our conditions.</p>

  <p>We are not only burning up our coal and our oil, and sweating and
  degrading the workers who are employed for that service, but we are rapidly
  stripping our planet of its forests, and so turning a wholesome, mitigated
  rainfall into an alternation of droughts and soil-destroying torrents. We are
  exterminating hundreds of precious and interesting species that can never be
  replaced, whales, elephants, penguins, seals and the like, and we are turning
  millions of acres of grassland into dusty deserts. All this is ascertainable
  fact. Unregulated competitive business, because of the new teeth and claws
  invention and discovery have given it, is doing this.</p>

  <p>We have power and more power, and everywhere it is being used to knock our
  world to pieces. That is why it is now urgent to replace not only our
  Sovereign States, but also our competitive and wasteful economic
  exploitations, by a more highly organised method-or perish. To achieve a
  progressive world organisation as speedily as possible, before extinction
  overtakes us, is, therefore, the primary problem, about which Mr.
  Everyman-you and I-has to get his mind clear now. Everything rests on our
  ability to solve that. Unless we are clear about that, not merely world
  peace, but the survival of our species in its present form, is just futile
  aspiration.</p>

  <p>We are fighting now face to face with an enemy whose one passionate aim is
  manifestly destructive conquest; we are ruled by governments that betray us
  by their passionate desire to keep on the propitiatory defensive. The plain
  truth is that we cannot stay where we are. We have to go on or succumb. We
  have to achieve the reorganisation of the world as one continually
  progressive, political, social, economic and educational community, and
  embark upon the realisation of the abundance and ever-fuller life for man
  that is now attainable. We have to do that because there is no other road
  except the road to destruction.</p>

  <p>Am I right in that? Or have you some other end in mind about which I know
  nothing? And if so will you tell me what that end is? Can you set up the
  universal peace and plenty that is now clearly possible on earth, in any
  other way?</p>

  <p>Let me ask you now what the setting-up of one sovereign peace in the world
  and one general economic control, means. It means World Revolution.. I ask
  you not to be afraid of the word "Revolution." Speak English. Don't think of
  Revolution as an affair of street barricades, the heads of beautiful ladies
  on pikes, and tumbrils going to the guillotine. Our "Glorious Revolution" in
  1688 had none of these ingredients, and the Revolution that established the
  Hanoverian Succession was practically bloodless. You can have a Revolution
  without massacre or violence. But anyhow, I submit that organised world peace
  and welfare mean such a Revolution in human life as will dwarf all previous
  revolutions to comparative insignificance. It means such a universal
  scrapping of time-honoured institutions as mankind has never faced hitherto.
  Consider: Man has always been a war-making animal. Our sovereign national
  governments arose as war-making organisations, and now we are under the
  necessity of setting up one single Pax in the world. That is a quite
  fundamental change of front for humanity. How can we do that without either
  completely amalgamating all existing governments, so far at least as their
  power to make war goes, or else reducing them to the position of ceremonial
  memories like Halloween or the Ancient Society of Druids and setting up a
  common control over them? I put it to you with the utmost deference that
  anyone who runs about now demanding permanent world peace and who is not
  prepared to scrap the sovereignty of his own government and amalgamate the
  general control of political and economic life into a world-wide system, is
  either muddle-headed or insincere or both. This means the end of the British
  Empire quite as much as the end of German Imperialism. You have to face it.
  In other words, I am saying that if we really want World Peace and World
  Welfare, that means we are World Revolutionary Socialists, and for my own
  part I cannot see how we can escape the chain of reasoning along which I have
  been led to this conclusion.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec5"
     name="sec5">§ 5. &mdash; THE BLUE SWASTIKA<br>
  AND THE RELIGION OF THE RENTIER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now here I propose to make a digression upon human motives
  and upon the forces that give us our Quislings, and particularly King Leopold
  Quisling, that Eton boy who deliberately betrayed his country and his allies,
  to the sympathetic consternation of the better-class elements in our present
  compromise government. I think that there are common features in all the
  weakening and defeatist elements which complicate the democratic effort
  everywhere throughout the world. I want to make it clear that hatred of the
  common man and hatred of the idea of government in the common interest,
  exists everywhere on earth and that it has to be given its proper value,
  which is almost primary, in mapping out the problem before us.</p>

  <p>I have said that some of us are really fighting with a clear desire to go
  on to a new world, and that others of us are pulling back to preserve a state
  of affairs tbat is collapsing. Sooner or later, I repeat, and the sooner the
  better, we have to make our choice between revolution and reaction. The world
  at large is not clear about this and it is becoming urgently necessary tbat
  it should become clear about it.</p>

  <p>For the past few months I have been almost continually engaged in sampling
  human reactions to the present situation. I have received and read, and
  sometimes re-read, thousands of letters provoked by my trial attempts to
  state the broad facts of that situation, and a very considerable volume of
  printed comment and criticism. In addition I have read a large number of
  books which, quite independently of anything I was doing, deal with these
  same broad facts. In modem phraseology I have been engaged in Mass
  Observation in the field of expression of opinion. A certain section of the
  letters dealt in a spirit of charitable detestation with my parlous spiritual
  state, and others dealt very wholesomely with my lack of personal charm and
  the undesirableness of my continued existence. I agree about the
  disagreeableness; I am not particularly in love with my style; but I find it
  gets rather oily and ambiguous when I try assuagement; and I find a
  sufficient countercorrespondence to go on with this research in my own
  manner. It cannot be so very long anyhow before I stop altogether.</p>

  <p>Happily the very great bulk of this material I have had to handle has been
  without personal reference, pleasant or unpleasant. Even when it has been
  definitely addressed to me, it has been inspired by so keen an interest in
  the material under discussion, that only facts, views and estimates have
  mattered to the writers. One would have to be omniscient or completely stupid
  not to have learnt a great deal both in detail and about the general shape
  and statement of one's views through such an experience, and though I find
  the general trend of thought I have followed remains substantially the same,
  there has been nevertheless a decided change in the relative value of two of
  the main lines of possible political development, and I have realised a need
  for much greater explicitness upon certain issues where I had rashly assumed
  there was a general under standing. Let me state as simply as I can what I
  mean when I say that my sense of the relative values of certain processes in
  this task of world adaptation has been modified by these months of study and
  discussion I have spent in getting my mind clear. When we call this warfare a
  war between Democracy and Gangster Aggression, I realise more and more, we
  mean not a struggle between existing sovereign powers, divided vertically
  from one another, the good democracies and the bad, bad, bad swastika folk,
  but a struggle between aggressive dominating types of people and the general
  interest, a struggle which is going on <i>in every state in the world</i>. I
  am in agreement with the psychology of Adler rather than Freud about the
  essential motives of human beings. The desire to feel secure and superior, to
  command and extort respect and recognition, amounts to a primary hunger; it
  is far more essential than the intermittent drives of sex. Everywhere and
  under any political formula, it leads to parallel, if not identical,
  conflicts.</p>

  <p>That has been manifested very plainly by the course of events in Northern
  Europe. In Finland and all the Scandinavian countries there has been a very
  considerable amount of progressive liberal and labour legislation during the
  past quarter of a century. Social services have been vigorously developed,
  educational standards have risen slums have vanished, upper chambers have
  disappeared from the legislatures; no other countries whatever have gone so
  far in the direction of a unIversally prosperous equalitarian parliamentary
  regime. There has been a vast increase in vulgar happiness. The ground was
  cut from beneath the feet of the Communist by these advances. In Finland in
  1918 there had been a very considerable Marxist movement and there was a grim
  civil war; it is not an entirely satisfactory story but in the end compromise
  prevailed. In a brief twenty years insurrectionary Marxism had dwindled to
  ineffectiveness in Finland, the agrarian and urban workers had come to a
  working understanding, and men who had literally hunted one another in the
  days of conflict were working together for the general good. It was an
  astounding experience to come, as it did in 1920 and again in 1934, from the
  Marxist pseudo-socialism of Russia to these orderly, happy and highly
  socialistic countries.</p>

  <p>Yes. But there was discontent in them and discontent of a very definite
  sort. In Stockholm last August when I was there I encountered some very
  strong whiffs of that discontent. I do not mean discontent from below. There
  was indeed an active Communist Party, but that was no more natural to the
  soil than our English communism. It was just a nuisance to the Labour-Liberal
  political bodies, and it was quite conceivably subsidised by reactionary
  money. Its chief activity, there as everywhere, was to disorganise the
  progressive parties. The real and dangerous discontent was from above. One
  found it among the more active employers, in the official and military
  classes and the sort of people who were gradually being deprived of their
  sense of superiority and importance by the progressive social equalisation.
  They felt it had gone too far.</p>

  <p>They resented the criticism of their business management and finance, they
  were offended by the sight of the happy and cheerful common people who ate in
  the same rather democratised restaurants and showed the utmost lack of
  deference in tramways and trains. They felt just as our British Colonel
  Blimps do when a private in uniform eats in their presence, or a coloured man
  gets into the same railway compartment. They wanted these common people
  deprived of all this Parliamentary nonsense and put back in their places, and
  they saw in the Nazi reaction in Germany the very pattern of the methods
  required.</p>

  <p>Why should we pretend things were not so? In Sweden up to the outbreak of
  the war there was the possibility of an illegal pro-Nazi coup, and the same
  was manifestly true of Finland. So far had matters gone that the war-planes
  of Finland were even adorned with a blue swastika to facilitate their
  co-operation with the black. Everything was ready for a struggle from above
  downwards to arrest the legalised democratic drift and embark upon a common
  attack upon Russia as the symbol (even if it had become a monstrously
  unsatisfactory symbol) of the proletarian idea. In 1937-8 Sweden and Finland,
  like Poland, were ripe for a Nazi revolt from above. Apparently this was also
  true of South Norway. And it is absurd to say that the Stalin-Molotov
  dictatorship in Russia had no reason to fear an attack through Finland. From
  their doctrinaire, stupid and suspicious but not altogether ill-informed
  point of view, they had ample reason to regard Finland as the destined
  spear-head of an anti-Comintern attack. It is to Hitler that we owe the
  frustration of this reactionary possibility. No man in the world, not even
  Ribbentrop, has done so much as he has done to expose and destroy the
  imminent danger of totalitarian world dominion. Think of all the possible
  allies this foolish leader of the blind has dispersed. The Germanised and
  Yiddish-speaking Jews fought loyally for German ascendency inside and outside
  Germany as long as they possibly could. In the 1914-1918 conflict their
  services to Germany were of immense value. All the Jews in Poland and the
  Baltic provinces were naturally pro-German. Germany was their spiritual home.
  Yiddish was a German dialect and they were proud of it. The Jews in America,
  again, until Hitler came along, were largely anti~British and pro-German.
  They were powerful in the press, in the book trade and in criticism. To them
  we owe the poisonous legend that every Englishman who visits America is a
  "British propagandist," however cunningly disguised.</p>

  <p>Hitler has deprived Germany of all that potential loyalty and preference.
  In a state of hysteria at the approach of his particular nightmare, the war
  upon two fronts, he sold his possible Nazi friends like cattle to their
  traditional enemies. I hope that as a consequence we may see at last the blue
  swastika and all it stands for fade out of the struggle and out of the
  political imagination of the north.</p>

  <p>The point I want particularly to stress here is the revelation of the
  <i>extreme precariousness</i> of any advances in social well-being and
  popular happiness by parliamentary activity, <i>unless they are fortified by
  a world-wide co-operation of the popular and constructive elements in
  society</i> to restrain the fear and resentment of the rich and privileged. I
  have always opposed and ridiculed the class-war theories of Marx and his
  followers, the classwar upward, but the behaviour of a number of significant
  people since the betrayal of the liberal Republican Government in Madrid, has
  brought me to realise, as I never did before, the strength and quality of the
  classwar downward. I find this jealousy, this fear of equality, this dread of
  a world without inferiors, without people one can command and order about, a
  primary factor in our present perplexities.</p>

  <p>It happens that a typical case of downward class-hatred has come to hand,
  has, so to speak, volunteered, in the person of Dean Inge. In a recent essay
  about me he has favoured the world with an explanation of the revolutionary
  flavour of my views. I suffer, he says and have never recovered from, "the
  hardships of my early life"; I am "permanently embittered" with the genteel
  classes; at the sight of real ladies, deer parks, the stately homes of
  England and the clergy, I "see Red" and "exult in the destitution" which I
  "hope awaits them." (Note please that word "destitution" and not"
  destruction," because I shall have more to say about that.) He then sails on
  to a string of vague utterances against "Victorian Socialism" and a story of
  vast massacres and abominable outrages committed, he alleges, in Spain, and
  apparently with my connivance if not under my direct incitement. Or else I do
  not know why he drags them in when he writes about me. I make no defence
  whatever to these extraordinary charges. I mention them simply because they
  justify me in discussing the Dean's mental and moral condition with an equal
  freedom and a clearer regard to the facts.</p>

  <p>I have watched him closely for many years. I have been curious about him
  and perplexed by him. He is conservative and reactionary, but he is not an
  arrogant Tory. There is nothing of the large generosity of an autocrat about
  him, nor has he any of the overbearing confidence of a storm-trooper or a
  Russian commissar. Nor should I say he is at all snobbish, though he takes a
  lively interest in people of good family as being in fact the only people who
  are justified in living. But he IS saturated with animus against common
  people and against any legislation or any social forces that seem likely to
  diminish to any degree their inferiority to himself. He grudges them their
  reproduction, their education, for which he assumes they are "unfitted," and
  he bemoans any collective action to civilise their living and working
  conditions. Now there, it seems, we have something closely akin to that
  spirit of suppression which underlies that middle and upper class sympathy
  with the Totalitarian State outside the formally Totalitarian States, which I
  observed in Sweden, and which I have found far too abundant for my liking at
  home in England; <i>the spirit of the blue swastika.</i> But in the Dean it
  lacks dramatic quality. He will denounce me as a "Red," but he will not
  attack me as a "Red." If and when I am hustled off with blows and kicks to
  the Brown House or seized and dosed with castor oil, I am sure I shall not
  detect his familiar and, I warn him, very recognisable legs and gaiters among
  my masked assailants. His Fascism is of a more indoor and defensive type.</p>

  <p>And reconsidering again those innumerable articles of his which poured out
  from Lord Beaverbrook's papers in Lord Beaverbrook's unregenerate days, I am
  struck more and more by the continual insistence upon payments. He resents"
  paying for other people's children" and other people's illnesses and old age
  and so on and so forth. And, following up this clue, I find it leads me not
  merely to an explanation of Dean Inge, but to the adjustment of quite a large
  mass of behaviour in our world at the present time to our world problem. He
  belongs to a large class of people who resent expenditure upon all social
  services with extreme bitterness. War preparation, police, law courts and
  whatever protects property he can tolerate, but schools, medical services,
  housing, these are anathema to him. He stands preeminently for that rentier
  type of mind which has been produced in great masses by the financial and
  economic developments of the past two or three centuries. He clings to a
  sense of superiority over the great majority of his fellow creatures, but he
  does not do so in any titled, decorated, armed and trampling manner. He has
  transferred all that assertiveness to his property and more particularly to
  his investment list. For him typically, as for vast multitudes of his class,
  the central sustaining reality in life is neither God nor Church nor country
  nor duty nor any of those brave decorative things, but the investment list
  and the income it yields. He thinks in terms of solvency, and his use of
  "destitution" instead of "destruction" in the sentence I have quoted exposes
  the very core of his mind.</p>

  <p>Whatever sustains that central reality is his good, whatever threatens it
  is his evil. There is the key to his objection to expenditure on social
  service and to his dread of anything that threatens him with expropriation.
  In a world of increasing terrors for his class, he still clings to the
  desperate idea that these swastika cults will keep the people down for him.
  The supreme evil, because it is the plainest threat, is "Bolshevism," but
  anyone he suspects of taxation and collectivisation he denounces, as he
  denounces me, as a "Red." We are all Reds together, we are all in a
  conspiracy against that sacred thing, which he calls civilisation, Christian
  civilisation, or what you will, and nothing is too bad for us. He lapses into
  conspiracy mania upon the lines of Mrs. Nesta Webster, whose Secret Societies
  and Subversive Movements must never be forgotten in any study of the present
  political and social conflict in Britain.</p>

  <p>Now I do not want to accuse Dean Inge of any essential dishonesty or
  wickedness. He is not writing or thinking, as people say, with his tongue in
  his cheek. It is a!l to his credit that he reveals to us, honestly and
  plainly, exactly what he is. He is what his origins have made him. He does
  not know how completely his mind has been transferred to those threatened
  investments as the touchstone of social and political good. But the
  consequences of such a fundamental distortion of the mind become apparent
  directly we come to any question of evidence bearing on the case. Any
  statement that discredits these " Reds," however preposterous, he accepts and
  repeats eagerly. Any statement that seems to him to favour the anti-Reds must
  by that fact be true. And I find he has a kindred spirit in our press in Mr.
  Arthur Bryant, who, I understand, is a trusted adviser of some of our present
  rulers.</p>

  <p>I will take them, therefore, together. I refuse to charge either of these
  gentlemen with deliberate falsehood. But I can do so only on the assumption
  that they are so mentally deranged by their horror of expropriation as the
  ultimate evil, that they are indifferent to the ordinary rules of evidence. I
  have been pleading with them recently, both in private and in public, to come
  straight and own up, about certain fantastic statements they have made about
  Spain, and it is only after a complete failure to get them to do anything of
  the sort, that I produce them here as types of a widespread, and still
  spreading, infectious mental malady, a malady that has to be taken into very
  serious consideration in our speculation upon the possibility of bringing
  some sort of new order out of our present world confusion.</p>

  <p>First with Dean Inge. He has written (the italics are mine):</p>

  <p class="quote">"I cannot understand how any decent person can deny that the
  Nationalists were justified in taking arms against <i>those devils in human
  shape</i>, the Spanish Reds, who, fighting under the 'hammer and sickle' and
  <i>under orders from Moscow</i>, butchered three hundred thousand men and
  women, a hundred thousand in Madrid alone, <i>in an attempt to extirpate
  whole classes of the population.</i> It is difficult to forget what an
  American eyewitness saw in the town of Ronda, near Malaga. The Reds impaled
  on stakes <i>all the male inhabitants who belonged to the middle class</i>,
  and while they were dying in agony compelled them to watch their wives and
  daughters being first violated and then burnt alive. There are scores of
  similar horrors equally well authenticated."</p>

  <p>There is a plain statement. I asked for the evidence and I pointed out
  that when the "Nationalists" took arms the Spanish Government was a Liberal
  Republican one which had recently suppressed with considerable difficulty an
  Anarchist-Syndicalist revolt. And I asked particularly for the name and
  qualifications of that "American eye-witness." To which the Dean replied
  proudly: "I have made a careful study of the Spanish horrors, and have
  accepted none but well-documented evidence." He then without a word of
  apology dropped his American eye-witness and appealed to "a book by Mr.
  Arthur Bryant," which Mr. Bryant tells me does not exist-he has never written
  about Ronda-and there I was left. Mr Bryant referred me to "official" reports
  upon atrocities by the Nationalist authorities, but I feel I have hunted the
  Dean far enough. As for the Communist rule in Spain, the Dean cites
  Krivitsky's <i>I Was Stalin's Agent</i> as convincing evidence. It is plain
  that if Krivitsky's book has a word of truth in it, then he was by his own
  confession an accessory for many :years to a complex of crimes, frauds,
  tortures and deceits. Why should we trust him now '/ The Dean cannot have it
  both ways. And this assertion that something is " official" without date or
  other reference, is really beyond sane acceptance. What Herr Goebbels says is
  "official." What Lord Haw Haw says is "official," and the denials of the
  Republican Government in Madrid were equally official. So far from making a
  "careful study" of the matter, it is plain that the Dean has just shut his
  eye and gobbled what he wanted. "I could have found several equally dreadful
  examples by Spanish eye-witnesses, but some of them I did not care to keep on
  my shelves. The estimate of 300,000 victims is official; some have put the
  number much higher. Krivitsky's <i>I Was Stalin's Agent</i> is most
  illuminating; for example, page 120: "The Ogpu had done a brilliant piece of
  work. In December, 1936, the terror was sweeping Madrid, Barcelona and
  Valencia. The Ogpu... carried out assassinations and kidnapping.... The
  Soviet Union had a grip on Loyalist Spain, as if it were already a Soviet
  possession."</p>

  <p>According to the Dean and Mr. Arthur Bryant, Franco, you see, had taken up
  arms in July, 1936, to avenge what happened, according to that veracious
  witness, Krivitsky, in the subsequent December.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, so far as figures go, Mr. Arthur Bryant outdoes Dean Inge, and
  I find him running on in this style in the pages of the <i>Illustrated London
  News</i>:</p>

  <p class="quote">"...the deliberate murder of 800,000 men, women and children
  in cold blood, <i>as did the Communist rulers of Republican Spain in the
  early days of the Civil War</i>. For it seems that these ghastly
  slaughter-house figures, which can now at least be computed, far exceed
  anything previously estimated in this country."</p>

  <p>Shocked by this, I wrote direct to Mr. Arthur Bryant, asking him to clear
  up that massacre of the entire middle-class of Ronda with the Dean, and to
  justify or apologise and withdraw his" deliberate murder... in cold blood"
  figures and his statement that the Republican Government in Spain at the time
  of Franco's treason was a "Communist" one. I pleaded with him as one decent
  Englishman to another to own up and not make it necessary for me to expose
  him. He referred me as his source for that 800,000 to an evidently
  well-informed article in <i>The Times</i> for January 3rd last. Now here let
  me quote what that article says and ask the reader to judge whether a man who
  can draw the above conclusion from what follows can really be considered to
  be in his right mind.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The shadow of tragedy lies heavy over all. With a total of
  murdered estimated at 800,000, apart from 400,000 killed in regular fighting,
  there is hardly a family in the land without a sense of wrong as well as
  loss, if not a desire for vengeance. This extends to the relatives of the
  'executed.' Ten months after the civil war ended, prisons remain crammed and
  tribunals have to struggle to keep pace with arrests. Denunciation is
  extended to foreigners, as in the case of Mr. Charles Clayton Ray, president
  of the British Chamber of Commerce in Madrid, who has been twice molested.
  Association with the 'Red' Governments or authorities, even in official
  capacity, is confounded with crirrunality.... In spite of promises to the
  contrary, persecution for political reasons continues and heavy sentences are
  pronounced. Fifty Basque priests still lie in prison. Two of them were
  recently reprieved from death by General Franco, but the Mayors of Tudela and
  Eibar, together with the youth Raimundo Uriarte, leader of the Basque
  <i>mendigoxales</i> (Alpinists) were shot."</p>

  <p>You see what Mr. Bryant's 800,000 butchered" in cold blood" amounts to. It
  includes all the Franco massacres also, systematic killings that are still in
  progress, and it spreads over the whole period from 1935 to the present day.
  Yet he still clings to his own interpretation.It is a triumph of faith over
  fact. The Dean's "official" 300,000 is a reduction of half a million, and
  still it will not stand examination. No less a witness than General Franco
  can be put into the box. In a review of the state of Spain at the end of last
  year he gave the figure of the legal government's killings from first to last
  as 100,000. Even he may not be entirely free from bias. One gets down to
  something rather more tangible in F. A. Voigt's <i>Unto Caesar</i>. There we
  find that he estimates the shootings in Madrid, including those of persons
  who were spying, signalling or fighting against the government within the
  city, and who were shot, therefore, according to all the accepted usages of
  war, as "at least" 40,000. He tells me personalJy that he was able to see the
  police records of the shootings in Madrid from first to last, and he
  estimates the total of those records as about 35,000. He feels, however, that
  these figures are incomplete, and he adds another 10,000 for his own
  satisfaction. Let us assume that 22,500 of these were unjustifiable political
  murders. That is frightful enough, but we must remember Spaniards of all
  parties take their politics grimly. Still it does little to exculpate my two
  cases from the charge of a bias amounting in effect to mania.</p>

  <p>Now if these two gentlemen on the dissecting table were rare specimens, it
  would not be worth while devoting space and time to their state of mind, but
  they are not rare specimens; the problem of their kind and what has to be
  done to them is a central one in our present discussion. In <i>The Fate of
  Homo sapiens</i> I drew attention to the influence of Mrs. Nesta Webster's
  <i>Secret Societies and Subversive Movements</i>. It is a book that all
  serious people interested in the British situation ought to read and think
  about, and very few of them do. I give Mrs. Nesta this much advertisement.
  You hear little of her in what we call literary circles, and your ordinary
  educated man, if her volume should ever come into his hands, will probably
  either consider it a joke and read it through with chuckles, or drop it as
  preposterously silly. But <i>the politics of Great Britain are not now in the
  hands of highly educated people</i>, and if we are to understand the mental
  forces at work in influential quarters at the present time, we cannot Ignore
  Mrs. Webster, Buchmanism Christian Science, occultism and so forth. They are
  probably more influential even than orthodox Anglicanism.</p>

  <p>In my <i>Fate of Homo sapiens</i>, published before the war broke out, I
  wrote:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I should describe Mrs. Nesta Webster as a perfectly sane
  and capable person with insane ideas, so widely do I disagree with her. I
  believe her influence has spread far beyond the circle of her actual readers.
  Milder forms of the same intellectual malaise at any rate are now prevalent
  throughout the more prosperous classes in Great Britain and America. It is
  the only way to account for the behaviour of Mr. Neville Chamberlain, for
  example, or Lord Rothermere, the British newspaper proprietor, towards the
  Jews, towards Russia, during the past two or three years. A tepid, negligent,
  broad Christianity is becoming an aggressive, narrow pro-Christianity under
  the stresses of the time."</p>

  <p>In America this rentier mentality is probably even more obstinately anti-
  common-man than in Great Britain. It is the clue to all the frenzied
  denunciations of the New Deal by rich people and their consistent efforts to
  hinder and sabotage the socialisation of America by Franklin Roosevelt. All
  these defensive rentiers would break away into defeatism and a deal
  to-morrow, if only Goering and Hitler would let them. These case-book studies
  I have made throw a new and very illuminating light upon the reality beneath
  all this vehement pseudo-Christianity that still seeks to transfigure this
  present conflict into a religIous war against anti-God (and anti-Stock
  Exchange) Rusia.</p>

  <p>And I think they make the significance of that Finish blue swastika clear.
  All these things psycholopical understanding of that downward class war,
  which threaten) all our hopes and liberties.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec6"
     name="sec6">§ 6. &mdash; THE TRIPLE CHOICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the preceding section I have done my best to put before
  you my conception of the roughly triangular conflict that is now going on in
  the human community. I have tried to put the Blue Swastika, the Rentier
  mentality and the Black Swastika in their proper relationship to each other
  and to the collapse of the Investors' world. None of these things present any
  hopeful alternative to the third path-the Revolutionary path. There, there is
  hope, and how much hope there is, and what call there is for effort, must be
  our next question. Either, convinced by such considerations as I have put
  before you, you will decide more or less honestly to be a Revolutionary. That
  means the utmost selfobliteration of which you are capable in a good cause.
  You will find that idea worked out very clearly by a very great Russian
  psychologist, Chakhotin, a former colleague of Pavlov, in a book called
  <i>The Rape of the Masses</i>. You should read that book. Become a conscious,
  devoted Revolutionary. That is the first alternative.</p>

  <p>Or you will try to dodge about in the convulsion in human affairs ahead of
  us, buy gold bars for example and bury them, cheat or wangle advantages, or
  resort to political gangsterism and bare-faced robbery. You will perhaps
  resort to the propitiatory complicity of the Blue Swastika. Or thirdly, you
  will join what will probably be the great majority of mankind in the days
  ahead. You will submit, you will bolt, you will evade facts until they
  overtake you. You will join what is always the great majority in a decadent
  species, the fugitives and victims.</p>

  <p>That is the triple choice before you; <i>either a revolutionary, or a
  gangster-trickster, or a victim</i>. Fight, cheat or yield. Your pride and
  conscience must decide.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="sec7"
     name="sec7">§ 7. &mdash; WHAT FEDERATION MEANS AND MAY MEAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE argued that the alternatives before a human being in
  the face of our present stresses are, to fight, cheat or yield. You have
  either to be a World Revolutionary, working to set up a new Law and Order in
  the world, or a shyster, or a victim. I am now going to assume that we have
  braced ourselves to the first alternative. We propose to make the
  establishment of a New World Order the major interest in our lives. It is a
  vast undertaking, but I, for one, do not believe it is a hopeless one, and I
  will now set before you my reasons for that belief as plainly and clearly as
  I can.</p>

  <p>I believe that we have at hand now the means and the method for a New
  World Order that will make that collapsing Golden Age of the Investor, that
  transitory upper and middle class world order of the late Victorian age, seem
  a mere gleam of barbaric prosperity before the dawn.</p>

  <p>Let us now put the question: What is the primary problem we human beings
  have to solve? Obviously it is to replace or at least to mitigate adequately
  these militant, sovereign, national governments and these competitive
  business and financial organisations, which are now, under the new conditions
  created by invention and discovery, devastating and tearing our world to
  pieces, by something that will override, restrain, and even perhaps end,
  their conflicts. We want to discover some project that will not only open a
  way to peace out of this present conflict but establish a safe barrier
  against the recurrence of warfare in the future. Can it be done 1 and
  inseparable from that, How can it be done? Now there is a word very much in
  circulation at present which, for reasons I will make clear, I have been
  disposed to regard with considerable suspicion, the word" Federation." It can
  be used very easily in a misleading and dangerous way, and that was the thing
  most evident to me at the onset. Combined with "Union," in the phrase
  "Federal Union," it appeared associated with some extremely misleading and
  preposterous schemes. Their mental quality aroused a sort of contemptuous
  dislike in me, and in my desire to make my objections emphatic, I may have
  struck at ideas outside the definite target at which I aimed. Happily I am
  not one of your heaven-sent leaders, but merely an explorer. I profess no
  inspired omniscience. If I find I have reported things wrongly I do my best
  to correct that report as soon as possible. I am going now to restate my
  ideas about Federation-or may I call it?-Federalism. I don't think that I or
  for that matter anyone else has been very clear about that word. Released
  from its early associations, and stripped down to its essential significance,
  cleaned and defined, this word "Federalism" may yet prove to be the key word
  for the solution we are seeking.</p>

  <p>But let us keep this clear; "Federalism" is the thing; "Federal Union," as
  it is now being used, is something much more limited.</p>

  <p>What is a Federation in the broadest sense? A Federation is nothing more
  nor less than an agreement on the part of this or that group of independent
  powers or organisations to set up a common authority to which they delegate
  <i>certain specific functions</i> and no others. You can have a federation of
  football clubs or of manufacturers. You can have a federation of free cantons
  like the Swiss Republic. The essence of federation is that <i>the federating
  bodies keep their identity</i> and merely <i>delegate</i> powers.</p>

  <p>For instance, and it is a thing most Europeans fail to keep in mind, all
  the States in the United States of America are independent sovereign States.
  They do what they please, they have powers of life and death, inside their
  boundaries. The Sacco and Vanzetti case, the Scottsborough case, the peculiar
  divorces of Reno, are local stories as much outside the purview of the
  Federal Government of the United States as the troubles of Shanghai or Tibet.
  The Federal Government is concerned only with the collective foreign policy,
  army and navy, money, inter-state trade and so forth, and each carefully
  defined function has been speciaIly relinquished to it in the Federal
  Constitution. This is one outstanding type of federation. It is an affair of
  power politics; it is a regional grouping of sovereign states which realised
  that they were doomed to conflict and disaster if they remained divided, in
  face of European, and particularly of British, encroachment. So they made a
  common front to the danger, and incidentally got rid of the inconvenience of
  local monies and inter-state trade barriers.</p>

  <p>But the American Union is only one type of federation. There exists also a
  whole series of organisations at the present time which are much wider in
  scope and which deal only in very strictly defined fields. Essentially they
  also are federal. I want to stress that. They are federal in spirit even when
  they are not federal in form.</p>

  <p>This type of federalism is often spoken of nowadays as <i>ad hoc</i>
  internationalism. A typical case is the Postal Union. So far as our
  correspondence goes, we have been living for some time in a loose world
  federal state. It is true that the associated countries all print and sell
  their own stamps in order to advertise their monarchs, their great personages
  and their scenery and products upon them. There is indeed a complicated
  system of coupons for the payment of return postage, but there are still no
  federal world stamps, and under the stresses of war the privacy of letters is
  no longer respected. But the fact that the idea has so far materialised only
  imperfectly, does not affect the validity of the idea.</p>

  <p>That great Jewish genius, David Lubin, had a scheme for developing the
  Postal Union into a world parcels post, setting no limit to the bulk of
  parcels, standardising frieght, and so bringing all the goods transport and
  merchant shipping of the world under one international control. It was a
  clear-headed, practicable idea. It pointed straight to that economic world
  federalism which is our only escape now from unending conflict. He organised
  the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, which, before 1914, had
  independent treaties with nearly all the sovereign States of the world and
  received reports, month by month, upon the crop outlook everywhere, so that
  it was becoming possible to foretell gluts and shortages, famine and
  superfluity, and provide for them, all over the world. That was twenty-six
  years ago. 1914 put an end to that development. The International Institute
  of Agriculture, in so far as it had delegated powers, was an even closer
  approach to economic federalism than the Postal Union, though it never had
  time, before it was overtaken, to develop a system of agents of its own
  throughout the world.</p>

  <p>The Elder Brethren of Trinity House, again, who light and chart and dredge
  all the sea channels of the world, constitute another world organisation
  essentially federal in its nature. The control of the drug traffic the
  control of the White Slave traffic, the distribution of radio wave lengths,
  are all parallel instances of <i>ad hoc</i> internationalism. Already in
  respect to these various matters, we were living practically in the dawn of a
  federal world state before the present War overtook us. We may call the first
  sort of federalism, <i>political power federation</i>, and I suggest we call
  this second type of international co-operation, <i>ad hoc</i> wprld
  federalism, since it deals <i>ad hoc</i> with only one function. They are the
  two extremes of the same thing. At one extremity we have essentially
  political federations, power federations, limited both in their functions and
  their boundaries; and at the other extremity, federalism limited only by
  function. Some legal-minded people will think that I am stretching this word
  "federalism" unjustifiably to bring in these world-wide types of
  international cooperation, .but for the life of me I can find no difference
  except in degree and range between these extremes. The essential thing in
  both types is the surrender of one or more particular function to a common
  control, while retaining every other aspect of sovereignty intact.</p>

  <p>And I want to put it to you that another, a third distinct form of
  federalism is developing now, under the stresses of the present struggle. I
  do not think anyone of us has sufficiently appreciated its possibilities in
  our discussion of the world situation. It may develop very remarkably.</p>

  <p>It arises from the imperative necessity that allies engaged in modern
  totalitarian warfare, should pool their military, air and naval commands,
  stabilise their exchanges, co-operate closely in their economic life, in
  their shipping and general transport, in their declaration of war aims and in
  their preparations for peace. That sort of federalism, the natural product of
  necessity, was in operation between the Allies in the late phases of the war
  of 1914-18. It worked very well. This again was not called "federation," but
  essentially it was. I suggest that we might very well call this "war-welded
  Federalism." It was not foreseen or planned; it developed out of an
  unavoidable need. Powers were delegated to a unified control of the fighting
  forces, to an allied shipping control, to a federation in the matter of
  supplies.</p>

  <p>After the war, this bundle of federal arrangements was it is true broken
  up, but it was broken up hastily and foolishly. That is largely why we are
  again at war. Shipping and industries were grabbed back by private
  ownerships, British support was withdrawn from the franc, secret treaties and
  double-crossing broke out like a rash on the fair face of victory, and the
  foreign policies of America and the Allies came untwisted like a badly made
  rope. That was a disaster that must not recur. Nevertheless, there <i>was</i>
  that essentially federal phase during the earlier war; it is lamentable that
  it did not hold together, and under our present stresses most of it seems to
  be returning in an intensified form.</p>

  <p>This time the conditions are very different. Any repetition of Armistice
  Day and that great Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul's, in which King, Church
  and Deity--none of whom could really be held responsible for the conduct of
  the war--gave each other credit for a glorious victory, seems to me highly
  improbable. This time it looks as though the elaborate cultivation of
  inefficiency under the British system, the concentration of power in the
  hands of a class so demoralised by privilege that it has failed to keep up
  even its own training and education for direction, had at last reached the
  pitch of conclusive military failure. It is unthinkable that the Allied
  "democratic" peoples should accept defeat but it is becoming more and more
  doubtful whether the directive energy and intelligence our ruling classes can
  now produce, is capable of conducting the conflict to a triumphant end. The
  slowly awakening anger of a misled people may clear away the old regime but
  it will not in itself produce the immediate technique for victory. This will
  be a stubborn and costly war for the common soldier. When this German
  onslaught upon civilisation passes its climax it may ebb and collapse very
  rapidly, but by that time the social, moral and economic exhaustion of the
  nominal victors will probably have reached a phase which will render them
  incapable of dictating any such peace as that made at Versailles.</p>

  <p>What then is the outlook? It seems to me that the present involuntary and
  unprecedented federation of ourselves and our Allies, will be forced to go on
  increasing and elaborating itself far beyond any more or less illusory "end "
  to the present fighting. This time it is going to be very much harder to
  unscramble the eggs we have been forced to beat up together for the second
  time. Now here, it seems, we have a third distinct type of federalism;
  federation through conflict under modem conditions. To distinguish between
  this and the power block federation, the " Federal Union" idea on the one
  hand and ph doc world internationalism on the other, we may call this third
  type of federalism "war-welded Federalism."</p>

  <p>And as I have been turning over this general theory of federalism in my
  mind, I have come to realise that there is a possible way towards a world
  settlement arising out of this conception of War-welded Federalism. I want to
  put that idea before you. If it stands examination, I put it to you it may
  turn out to be a very valuable and important idea indeed.</p>

  <p>Unless the onset of peace is to take us by surprise, just as we were taken
  by surprise by the war and by the discovery of the immense unpreparedness,
  incapacity and half-heartedness of our governing class, it is evident we must
  set about thinking out the probJem of peace for ourselves now. <i>They</i>
  cannot be trusted to handle it for us.</p>

  <p>Talking about peace need not and must not weaken our fighting, but talking
  about a worth-while peace may put a lot of energy into our fighting. It is
  plainly impossible now to call off any of the fighting until the Germans are
  exhausted, and until something like a general disarmament is agreed upon and
  provided for.</p>

  <p>It is not <i>our</i> choice that; <i>they</i> won't let us. How can you
  trust Germans any more so long as they have arms in their hands? And the
  return of the evacuated populations has to be not only stipulated for but
  arranged for, before we leave off. We must be agreed about that. Treaties
  aren't good enough. But when we are through there will have to be far greater
  social reconstructions than were attempted at Versailles. Money is going to
  "bust." Both sides will have to come together upon that much, before this
  war, as they call it, <i>can</i> end. Anything short of that will be merely a
  pause for another Nazi surprise. The Armistice will be imposed by necessity
  on both sides. Until there is some such fully implemented Armistice prepared,
  how can this fighting stop? It may ebb for a while and then break out again,
  but there can be no other ending for it. So that a lot of the terms of the
  Armistice will have to be discussed and settled-through neutrals perhaps, and
  in all sorts of roundabout wayswhile the fighting is still going on. Maybe
  America may formulate these conditions. Maybe America and Russia-have you
  thought of such a combination?-may insist upon them. Neither dare permit a
  Germany rampant. Neither wants to fight, but they cannot tolerate that. Then
  they must co-operate in holding her down. And how else can she be held down
  except by <i>fully empowered world commissions</i>? So the idea of a
  war-welded federation of the combatants and the interveners, quasi-victors
  and quasi-vanquished, may emerge in the guise of a great tangle of special
  world adjustment commissions....</p>

  <p>That is surely a much more possible and practicable outcome than any mere
  triumph of us or them. Europe is being bled down to pale reasonableness
  pretty rapidly. And the shortest way to cessation will be special world
  commissions. We could have the best part of the world under international
  commissions in quite a short time if it wasn't for the inertia of the older
  politicians. In two or three years at the outside. That is the most probable
  way out of this bloody chaos and the most possible and the most desirable.
  Unless this break-up of the world into a slaughter scramble is to go on
  in-definitely, there must be an effective disarmament commission, a
  reparations commission, an international commission for the restoration of
  the displaced populations, an air and general transport commission, and a
  commission for the restoration of production by some readjustment of money
  and barter, all in operation quite soon. Their work, once it begins, may
  stretch over year....</p>

  <p>Is this asking too much of the human intelligence? At its present level? I
  for one do not think so. One world-wide federation there must certainly be
  after this war and that is a federation to put a stop to air war for ever.
  Plainly that at least must stop, or civilised life must stop, and the one and
  only way to stop it is to set up a world commission with full powers to
  control the air everywhere, powers of search, powers of instant suppression.
  No single country can be left out of that. If necessary, countries must be
  compelled to come in. And no simple treaties or conventions will meet the
  case. There will be no more treaties because there is no more good faith.
  Germany has killed that for ever. The air commission must be a commission
  with full powers, a world air police. All over the world reasonable people
  and common people will be in favour of that. Patriots may object, but even
  patriotism may be out of fashion in a little while. And once we federate so
  far as the air goes, we can add other world commissions quite easily to the
  bundle of delegated powers. All that, we can get out of a properly
  conditioned <i>and previously discussed and formulated</i> Armistice. We can
  get it in no other way. So I take it that is the way things will have to
  go.</p>

  <p>What else can there be? Utter disaster. Even countries that keep neutral
  right up to the end will see the logic of the new conditions; they will
  surely insist upon bearing a share in this settlement. It is a universal
  concern. They will all be under arms. They will all be entangled economically
  in the war. Is there such a thing as an "Isolationist" left even in America?
  If so, it must be some old gentleman who cannot read. Inevitably all the
  world must participate. The alternative is to become troglodytes listening
  for the air-raid warning from t~e air watchers and listeners outside, as
  prairie dog sentinels listen for trouble, for evermore.</p>

  <p>Do I make this idea of a sort of Standing Armistice clear? Negotiated and
  worked out from now on? Discussed beforehand? Put into operation at the cease
  fire? The longer the inevitable international commissions that would be set
  up, stay in being, and the more extensive they are, the less disposed
  reasonable men will be to part wIth them, and the more effectively will they
  block the way against the old order, or the old disorder sneaking back to its
  outworn localisations and appropriations. Putting the settlement in the hands
  of international commissions will save the faces of the combatant
  governments, and it will satisfy the immediate need for peace as I cannot
  imagine anything else doing. How else can we get back out of this world mess?
  How can our rulers and leaders and politicians dodge such an obvious
  settlement? Saving face is always important in old, decaying, complicated
  states. And under a regime of international commissions, the sovereign states
  will be able to declare they are still independent sovereign states, except
  in so far as these international commissions go. They can keep all their
  flags and dignities. That will not matter for the time being. We are only
  beginning to realise how far these commissions may be able to take us to a
  world-wide collectivism in raw materials, industrial distribution and so on,
  in spite of all such face-saving residues of sovereignty. The nominal
  Armistice will be in effect a Peace Union. The world will become, for all
  essential purposes, a federated Union, so far as the functions I have
  enumerated go, long before the fact is openly recognised.</p>

  <p>And here I want to suggest that concurrently with this proposed discussion
  of an Armistice forthwith, there is another line of consolidation and
  reassurance open at the present time, and no reason whatever why it should
  not be followed. The democratic governments, belligerent and neutral it seems
  to me are doing themselves and the world a grave injury by not making a clear
  and detailed statement of their common conception of democracy. They have
  been urged to do so from many directions, and the Sankey Committee convened
  under the auspices of the official Labour organ in London, the <i>Daily
  Herald</i>, has drafted a Declaration of the Rights of Man which might well
  serve either as an actual statement of the common objectives of the
  progressive states at the present time, or as a basis for a careful revision.
  With that and the use that can be made of it, I will deal presently. The
  supremely desirable end at which the Declaration aims, is to establish
  clearly defined unanimity of outlook, so that the common man everywhere and
  the decent enemy citizen may know where he stands. The air is full of vague
  talks by the heads of states, leading politicians, eminent divines and so
  forth, about the common ends of civilisation, the brotherhood of mankind,
  etc., etc., but it is impossible to regard that kind of stuff as anything but
  iridescent humbug until something like a honest willingness is displayed to
  bring these loose, cloudy aspirations to the cutting edge of an explicit
  statement.</p>

  <p>The extreme reluctance of the Allied governments to explain themselves to
  the world now is one of the most extraordinary aspects of the present
  situation. If anything is more inept than our general strategy it is our
  propaganda. Just as very few Europeans are aware of the essential sovereign
  independence of every one of the United States of America, so that the
  responsibility for local scandals and injustices is all charged to
  Washington, so hardly any stress whatever is laid upon the practical
  disintegration of the British Empire by the Statute of Westminster. It is a
  matter of vital importance in the real British case, in the face of the
  successful extinction of one free nation after another by the German
  onslaught, that the British Empire has been breaking up into free nations,
  visibly and so completely, that Southern Ireland has been able to remain a
  neutral in the present struggle and South Africa was free to discuss a
  similar detachment. Many even of our own people do not realise this, and it
  does not seem to be understood in America where as the British Pavilion at
  the New York World Fair showed, the only official British propaganda was a
  monarchist appeal to snobs. It is not clearly appreciated anywhere how far
  the Empire has already disarticulated itself, in convenient preparation for
  new and wider international readjustments.</p>

  <p>A further change in government in Britain may afford the opportunity for a
  clean-up of ideas in this matter. No Germans believe in our present good
  intentions. They believe we are a nation of sturdy fighters led by angry,
  vindictive but, luckily for them, incompetent Blimps. They expect no mercy if
  they lose the war. We hand them over body and soul to Hitler with our
  indiscriminate threats. Yet since it is highly undesirable as well as
  impracticable to exterminate them root and branch, we shall have sooner or
  later to make peace with them and work with them again. Why not make it clear
  at once what our conditions for co-operation are and what sort of common
  world we intend to share with them? We are obliged to go on fighting them
  until they surrender the air and disarm. Cannot we make up our minds now,
  that we do not propose they shall surrender to any victorious antagonist or
  antagonists at all, but to a special <i>ad hoc</i> world organisation in
  which from the very beginning they will have a properly conditioned
  share?</p>

  <p>The general embarrassment and probable failure of governments, statesmen,
  diplomats and politicians in the face of the present situation is to be
  understood if we realise that all their training has been as patnots and
  national advocates and that the task they have to undertake is an extensive
  unification of the common interests of mankind which will limit and minimise
  the importance of the very sovereignties in whose particularisms they have
  lived and moved and had their being. The Labour Party quite as much as the
  Conservative Party is first and foremost British. Very few men who are making
  political careers are likely to possess the intellectual vigour even to
  understand this situation in which the world finds itself, and even among
  that select minority the power of everyday use and wont will keep them
  playing on at the old game by the guttering candlelight of scholastic
  "history," long after the brightening dawn of the new realities has filtered
  round and through drawn blinds.</p>

  <p>This is the paradoxical position of human affairs. An increasing number of
  us know more and more clearly how matters are with the world. A lesser number
  are making an effort to meet the stupendous challenge of the situation. The
  rest follow their traditional motives, remain passive, obey their rulers
  blindly and when disaster looms immediately over them give way to panic, and
  to the persecutions and mass hostilities that panic engenders. Whatever plans
  are conceived and attempted to restore progressive order in the world, they
  must take into account the resentments and resistances of the instinctively
  conservative majority. They will obey the driving force of a Hitler who leads
  them to destructive conquest, because, as we have pointed out, destruction,
  and even self-destruction, is one of the normal escapes of the weaker sort of
  mind, but they will not face the terrifying prospect of a reconstructed
  world. From Aldous Huxley downward these gentler souls will continue to sneer
  at the idea of a Brave New World and take refuge in the desert and
  self-effacement. I beg his pardon-"Detachment."</p>

  <p>It is plain, therefore, that those who can add courage to their personal
  conviction that the human disaster may still be averted, must make their
  plans so as to inflict the minimum of shock and secure the maximum of
  acquiescence throughout the world. That is why it will be more convenient to
  set up the limited but sufficient amount of world federation needed to arrest
  the human debacle in the guise of a pre-arranged Armistice than to set up
  some terrifying and boring. World Conference with unspecified powers of
  reconstruction. An armistice, even a carefully prearranged armistice, has a
  reassuringly temporary appearance. That it had been considered beforehand
  would rob it of the flimsiness of an improvisation. It would leave all the
  existing governments (or such provisional governments the stresses of the war
  may produce) in being. They would simply be shorn of their more manifest
  powers of mutual injury. Crowns need not topple, nor natural boundaries-so
  long as they cease to be barriers-change. Some of the special commissions a
  preconceived Armistice would set up, commissions for the restoration of
  evacuated populations and the immediate relief of distress, for example,
  would be manifestly of a temporary nature. They would do their appointed work
  and fade out. Others, such as the air control or the control of staple
  production, would remain and become the permanent and not too obtrusive
  framework of a recuperating world.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec8"
     name="sec8">§ 8. &mdash; WAR IN THE AIR AND AFTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is sometimes an advantage to walk round an idea and see
  it from various sides, and so I am going to approach this idea of getting to
  a practical world federalism through a prearranged Armistice, from another
  angle.</p>

  <p>I happen to have had opportunities of observing the reactions of a number
  of human minds, including my own, in the face of an advancing certainty. Here
  again I have been my own guinea-pig, and what I have first observed in myself
  I have found reflected in the behaviour of people about me. These
  observations have a very direct bearing upon the problem of how to get
  humanity out of its present phase of distress and destruction. There is a
  very evident way out, but whether we shall be able to pull our minds together
  and take it is an altogether more debatable question.</p>

  <p>War in the air has been foretold for more than a century. I need scarcely
  quote Tennyson's "airy navies grappling in the central blue." What I have
  more particularly in mind is a book I published in 1908, <i>The War in the
  Air</i>, a year before Bliriot flew the Channel, and I want to direct your
  attention to the spirit in which it was written and read. It told of a German
  surprise air raid upon the world (in Zeppelins), of the rapid supersession of
  the airship by the aeroplane, of the extension of the air war to the whole
  world and the collapse of civilisation under it. The argument of the book was
  perfectly clear and sound, and it has been sustained by the experience of the
  intervening third of a century. It was that air war would be enormously
  destructive and inconclusive. This conviction, which is a clear, reasoned
  conviction, I have since reiterated in various books and films. But I am not
  claiming credit as a prophet. I am not asking you to observe that I told you
  so, but how it was I told it. The point I want to stress is this, that though
  I could work out this argument with complete intellectual integrity, I could
  at the same time treat the whole devastating prospect as a joke, as a
  preposterous extravaganza. <i>The War in the Air</i> is written in a vein of
  cheerful burlesque. An absurd little Bert Smallways opens the story with the
  remark, "This here Progress, it keeps on," and he ends an ageing barbarian
  among the ruins of a world. I just poked fun at the march of events, and
  people found the book very amusing.</p>

  <p>I wrote this book in a cheerful little house I had built for myself at
  Sandgate, among surroundings of an apparently invincible stability. I did not
  connect it in the least with the outlook of my children. There was a
  disconnectedness in my mind. I was not dishonest, but my mind was carrying on
  along two main and mutually incongruous strands, and it is only in the
  restrospect and in the light of the psychological analysis of. the
  behaviourist school of thought, which presents conscious life as an imperfect
  association of conditioned reflexes, that I begin to realise the significance
  of this. These main strands were not completely independent; they affected
  and coloured one another, but to a large extent they were independent
  processes. From the standpoint of the everyday present in 1908, war in the
  air was incredible and slightly absurd; from the standpoint of the
  intellectual process, the every-day life was just the temporarily pleasant
  foothold from which we looked at the inevitable. Now, since I am a very
  ordinary person, what is true of me is probably more or less true of most of
  my fellow creatures,* and I find in this realisation of the active existence
  of different systems in my own mind a clue to the behaviour and limitations
  of a great number of people which have hitherto perplexed me. They can at
  once understand things more or less clearly and refuse to entertain them.
  They can do this in perfect good faith.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Here is precisely the same idea from Churchill's The
  World Crisis, Vol I, p. 24:<br>
  "During the whole of those ten years (1904-1914) this duality and discordance
  were the key-note of British politics; and those whose duty it was to watch
  over the safety of the country lived simultaneously in two different worlds
  of thought. There was the actual visible world with its peaceful activities
  and cosmopolitan aims; and there was a hypothetical world, a world 'beneath
  the threshold,' as it were, a world at one moment utterly fantastic, at the
  next seeming about to leap into reality-a world of monstrous shadows moving
  in convulsive combinations through vistas of fathomless catastrophe."</p>

  <p>Until they apprehend their own natural human inconsistency, they will
  behave with apparent disingenuousness and act with such complex
  indecisiveness as to frustrate the realisation of their own declared beliefs
  and intentions. Myself in 1908 reasoning out the approaching threat from the
  air to all the decencies of human life quite clearly and convincingly, ana
  telling about it in a humorous story with a disarming giggle, which robbed
  the warning of any direct value even for myself, is typical of what nearly
  all of us are doing in the face of the immense challenges of to-day. You can
  turn from one school of opinion to another, and every where you will find the
  same complexity of reaction. Quite apart from this question of the air war
  which I believe is bound now to clinch our decision for a united world, there
  have been great movements of the contemporary mind in which the same
  indecisiveness has been apparent. I have lived through a phase of human
  thought in which socialism, that is to say the recognition of the waste and
  injustice of the private appropriation of natural resources, the steady
  accumulation of social stresses towards an ultimate disaster, and the
  consequent need for a more-comprehensive organisation of economic life, has
  won its way from a minority protest to a complete argumentative
  establishment. "We are all socialists nowadays "-in theory.</p>

  <p>But following upon that intellectual conviction came the question "But
  how? <i>How</i> will you reorganise your system?" People, intellectually
  socialist, realised that, to become really socialist, a vast series of
  correlated changes had to be worked out, in which all the securities, usages,
  precedences and subordinations of to-day would have to be readjusted-not
  smashed, which is comparatively easy, but readjusted, which is abominably
  bard. There were these customary things and one was habituated to them. That
  toilsome and dangerous adapatation of the world might be ultimately
  necessary, yes, but meanwhile, for a time, one could carry on. At any rate
  until over the next week-end. So with an almost unconscious and quite
  unpremeditated duplicity our world had put off socialism just as I put off
  the problem of war in the air. The method with most well-disposed people was
  similar, if not the same. They did. not, it is true treat socialism as a
  fantastic story as I did War in the Air, but they dealt with it as a
  Beautiful. Ideal. They enjoyed and admired the Utopias of MorrIs and Bellamy,
  but they studied the city article with close attention. The Catholic Church
  denounces the expropriation of private owners, exhorts them to consider their
  property as held in trust for God and man, says severe things about usury,
  and invests its reserves without manifest scruple in the most reprehensible
  enterprises. The Anglican Ecclesiastical Commissioners are accused, rightly
  or wrongly, of the irresponsible and socially mischievous exploitation of
  slum properties. In perfect but uncritical good faith.</p>

  <p>It is easy to comment upon these things in a tone of self-righteous
  cynicism, but the fact is we are all made like that. Clear-headed, deliberate
  humbug is rare in our world, and though I consider the Roman Catholic Church
  as a serious obstacle to human enlightenment, though I find a hireling
  baseness in some few of its apologists, and though I have been "up against
  it" all my life, I still believe in the essential honesty of the bulk of
  those who speak and act for it. Never was there a falser saying than that man
  is a reasonable animal. Man is an extremely inconsistent animal. "The right
  thing to do" has a servant and a traitor, a friend and an enemy, in every
  man.</p>

  <p>This evasiveness, when it is a case of tackling some huge and difficult
  change in human life, however imperative, is not confined merely to those who
  benefit obviously by the immediate securities of the demonstrably decadent
  and doomed system in question. There is also an evasion of the task of
  reconstruction on the part of those who are declaredly in open revolt against
  the system and who may reasonably claim to be "underdogs." In my life journey
  through Socialism I have had very ample opportunity of seeing into the
  mentality of the extreme Left and Communist Party groups. A great deal of
  their dogmatism and malicious mischief is due, I reaJise, to pure funk of
  toil, balance and responsibility. They have a standard of living and except
  for incidental qualifications, that everyday side of theirs resists any
  fundamental change quite as much as if it was luxurious and triumphant.
  Vindictive sabotage and malicious mischief are well within their
  psychological range, but not the strain of constructive work. They do not
  want to alter this distressing world; they want to serve it out. They make a
  slogan of "Socialism in our Time," but they are not merely jealous and
  suspicious, they are hostile and malignant towards constructive effort. They
  achieve their escape from effort by professing an extreme purity of
  revolutionary purpose; they are a bright, noble "Red," they claim, none of
  your "Pink" stuff; the rational socialist is anathema to them, and in
  practice we find their red is yellow and they are the eager allies of any
  reactionary movement against a liberal progressive regime. The slowing-down
  of the revolution in Russia, its "failure to develop economic enterprise and
  operative efficiency, its spasmodic storms of suspicion and suppression and
  the increasing absolutism of its general direction, are best accounted for by
  that same <i>hysterical self-frustration of the sub-consciously
  incapable</i>. Forgive a long phrase that is loaded with meaning.</p>

  <p>To return to the particular issue on which we started; the problem of
  bringing this war in the air to some sort of conclusion. The peculiarities of
  Air War, evident from its very dawn-Bleriot flew the Channel in 1909-were
  this-that it was a war in three dimensions and not two; that it abolished war
  fronts and spread the conflict over the entire countries of the two
  combatants, so obliterating the distinction of combatant and non-combatant;
  that since its opening blows could be prepared for in profound secrecy and
  delivered with unprecedented swiftness, no country could henceforth feel safe
  from attack without warning; and that consequently it must dominate the world
  from now on either in the apprehension felt by a nominal neutral or in full
  and declared belligerence, until it is made impossible.</p>

  <p>Advances in the science of tactics of explosives and of destructive
  inventions generally have merely enforced and sharpened the edges of this
  forecast. It becomes more and more plainly evident to every clear
  intelligence that at any price the <i>possibility</i> of air war must be
  banished from the earth. Either man will put an end to air war or air war
  will put an end to mankind; that is the plain alternative before us, and it
  is by no means improbable that man will fail to produce the necessary mental
  vigour for his continuance. This is where the fact that our minds are made up
  of imperfectly reconciled strands of thought and motivation becomes cardinal.
  Had we the undivided energy of our convictions, we should be planning already
  the necessary political adjustments to take at least the control of the air
  out of the scheme of national and imperial politics and entrust it to a
  fully-empowered worlddirectorate. Federal Governments are not unlimited
  super-governments; they are special unifying authorities to which the
  constituent states have relinquished certain carefully specified powers, and
  it is plain that <i>war in the air, latent or active, can never cease now
  until the whole world is federated in this sense so far as this particular
  power is concerned</i>. This much of world federation is plainly a necessity
  we ought to be discussing now with the neutral powers, and not only with the
  neutral powers, but with our antagonists through the neutral powers. Such a
  discussion need do nothing to qualify the vigour and acerbity of the actual
  warfare. Whichever combatant gains the advantage of the fighting, or whether
  that presently comes to a stalemate, the whole world should be aware of and
  prepared for this issue to which no state in the world can be indifferent.
  This present war is not a war for oil or iron or gold. It is now primarily a
  war for the mastery of the air, and the world at large cannot suffer that to
  remain in the hands of any single power or group of powers. The less
  downright "Victory" there is indeed, the greater the prospect of a reasonable
  settlement. Either by conquest or intelligent arrangement, this much of
  Federation at least must be established on earth, and the sooner intelligent
  people set about discussing that everywhere, war or no war, the more hopeful
  is the outlook.</p>

  <p>That is the rational long-range view of the world situation. But here
  again we encounter the same unresolved conflict of the main groups of strands
  in our minds, between the strands than can forecast and prepare for things
  that are still for most of us not real until they actually happen, and those
  more immediate systems of habits and associations, of things experienced and
  the every-day life, which blind us to remoter realities. The actual fighting
  is now absorbing an increasing volume of attention, and any line of thought
  that goes beyond strategy and tactics is denounced by many people and
  denounced with an eagerness for which we have already found an explanation,
  as a diversion of energy from the real business in hand. It is nothing of the
  sort. War without clearly stated war aims is a sort of epilepsy. "First win
  the war," people say. But we won the .war in 1918 and then hardly anyone had
  the remotest idea what to do with it. This state of affairs seems likely to
  return again in an exaggerated form if we tolerate this sabotage of the end
  by the means. So now, while the outcome of the war is still uncertain, it is
  necessary not merely to discuss but to define the terms of an Armistice and
  to have it ready, cut and dried, for the inevitable phase of exhaustion and
  reasonableness. It needs to be something that will anticipate and may defer
  indefinitely the clumsy and elaborate procedure of a Peace Conference. We
  have taken as our type function the control of the air. It is quite possible
  to state preciselyat the present tme what powers would be possessed by that
  control. Obviously it would have to monopolise air armament, air routes, air
  controls, aerodromes, the manufacture of planes and airships, and it must
  receive its authorisation from the existing independent states of the world.
  How far and with what variety of methods it would receive its authorisation
  directly or indirectly from the peoples of these states, raises a multitude
  of considerations too complicated and detailed to discuss now. They do not
  affect the immediate imperative to set about preparing for the Armistice, to
  familiarise people's imaginations for it and to rouse them from their evasive
  fatalism as rapidly as possible now.</p>

  <p>Air warfare has been made the backbone of this discussion of a possible
  armistice, or rather it makes itself the backbone, but it is by no means the
  only universal interest with which the terms of a definite and hopeful
  armistice should deal. We hear a lot of vague promises from our leading
  statesmen about some juster treatment of the exploitation of markets and the
  distribution of raw produce, in the better days ahead. None of this need
  remain vague. Put it in words, put it in writing now. The more the outlook of
  the peace ahead is defined now, the better heart we shall have to bring it
  about, and the less will be the power of suspicion, distrust and despair to
  prolong the war.</p>

  <p>In 1918 I had some experience of the "War Aims" controversy at Crewe
  House. (<i>The Secrets of Crewe House</i> tells part of the story.) We
  declared we were unable to do our propaganda work effectively until we knew
  exactly what we and our allies wanted; we fired questions, a memorandum and
  delegations at the Foreign Office and were met with a solemn disingenuous
  vacuity. Except that the Germans were very, very bad people and had to be
  punished, and that Professor: (rather than President) Wilson had an innocent
  Gladstonian enthusiasm for nationalism, the smaller the nationalism the
  better, the Versailles Congress assembled in a mood of elaborate evasion,
  subconsciously blind to the urgency of an economic reconstruction of the
  world that stared it in the face. The common people were baffled and
  "business" grabbed back and looted.</p>

  <p>Are we to go through the bloody business of this resuscitated war again,
  with the sanie stupid aimlessness? Shall we emerge once more with a jumble of
  flushed belligerents all making unimplemented undertakings to disarm, without
  the faintest intention of doing so? Shall we have to face an economic storm
  of inflation, social disorganisation, another General Strike-on a world scale
  this time, simply because we will not face these coming events while they are
  still controllable?</p>

  <p>I do not think mankind can afford that risk for a second time, and the
  only way of escaping it that I can imagine is to go right ahead with the
  drafting of what will be practically a world treaty of peace <i>now</i>, a
  treaty that can be brought into immediate operation with the signing of the
  Armistice. The thing is quite possi~le, and particularly so as long as the
  United States remams out of the actual war and in contact with all the
  belligerents. The only objection to it on the part of m~st publicists will be
  that it is unprecedented and so quite improper.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec9"
     name="sec9">§ 9. &mdash; THE PUERILITY OF CURRENT FEDERAL UNION
     SCHEMES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WILL confess that I believe that the way to achieve our
  revolution to one single world order, various but united and continually
  progressive, which is now plainly the only alternative to chaotic
  degeneration for our species, lies in the concurrent development of
  world-wide <i>ad hoc</i> federalism, and the extension of war-welded
  federalism to the whole planet. The former will take on more and more
  functions and the latter will extend its range. I see no hope and I can see a
  lot of possible waste and mischief in these various schemes for the United
  States of Europe, or of Central Europe, or this, that or tbe other union of
  existing powers, which are distracting people's minds from a realistic study
  of the present international situation.</p>

  <p>I will try to give you my objections as pithily as possible. I have
  criticised Mr. Streit's <i>Union Now</i> at length elsewhere.* Loose as the
  great federal system of the United States is, it had to be consolidated only
  by one of the bloodiest of civil wars, arising out of the clash that arose
  between state and federal rights, when the slave plantation regime in the
  South was brought, by the development of railways and the westward movement
  of population, into conflict with the wages labour economy of the North. I
  have shown the impracticability of his own suggestion of a common money among
  countries in different phases of economic development.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* In <i>The Fate of Homo sapiens</i> and <i>The New World
  Order</i>.</p>

  <p>Recently I have read <i>Europe Must Unite</i>, the work of a pro-Japanese
  propagandist, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi. You should all read it, and, what is
  more think it over. The Count very kindly gives us a name: "Pan-Europa,", a
  crest and a banner for Pan-Europa, designs a little button for the faithful,
  even settles upon a "Pan-Europe Day," but he is a trifle indefinite about all
  he will include in his scheme. He is vague about the position of the British
  Empire. Mrica, he says, "is the garden of Europe," a legitimate part of Pan-
  Europa. But some of Mrica is British Empire. Turkey and Egypt are to be
  admitted to this European-African PanEuropa. The disposal of the rest of the
  British Empire might embarrass anyone but our author-it is embarrassing in
  most of these schemes-but he sets about the job with a polite ambiguity that
  does not even stir the touchy imperialism of, for example, Messrs. Amery and
  Duff Cooper, whom he counts among his most ardent supporters. The Empire, he
  argues, cannot be a part of Pan-Europa, India and the Dominions must go their
  own way, but the increasing liaison of France and Great Britain is to bring
  the latter into the happy Pan-European family, leaving her dominions to
  scatter according to the Statute of Westminster. Canada, he seems disposed to
  hand to "Pan-America," and then all we good little Europeans are to get
  together and. face the "intolerable competition of America." So, kindly but
  firmly, he breaks up and distributes the English speaking world.</p>

  <p>You feel Eastern Asia consolidating in the background, under the
  enlightened tutelage of Japan, but to that he does not direct our attention
  too markedly. The fate of one country is left particularly vague--Australia.
  It is, the Count tells us, a continent by itself, and I had a curious feeling
  when I had finished with him, almost as though I had had a very interesting
  visitor and one of my silver spoons was missing. I am not nearly so ready as
  Messrs. Amery and Duff Cooper and Wickham Steed seem to be to give up my
  fellowship in the Englishspeaking world and regard America as the great
  competitor, the essential antagonist and rival, in order to be a Pan
  -European. I do not think any of these Federal Union schemes will ever be
  more than a pleasant tea-party sedative, and so I will merely point out that,
  if by some infection of insanity anyone of them should be realised, it would
  merely prepare the world for a new, more monstrous cycle of warfare; Europe
  against America, Yellow against White, directly the unequal pressure of
  population and economic necessity began to operate.</p>

  <p>But this sort of thing is mere playing about with the map. The harm it
  does is the diversion of attention from more urgent, more difficult but
  ultimately more practicable things. Any intelligent schoolboy could spend an
  agreeable afternoon arranging and rearranging the world in this fashion. You
  can do it in a dozen different ways. Dr. Ivor Jennings has produced his plan,
  <i>A Federation for War-time Europe</i>, definite, lucid, incredible; the
  reverie of an able lawyer. I have two other Federal Constitutions on my table
  waiting to be read, and I wonder if I shall ever read them. I have watched
  Mr. Wickham Steed playing at this game all through my life. Yet I am
  compelled to suggest to you, in the interests of reality, this is a game for
  boys who have never grown older, rather than for men who have really grown
  up. It is based on no vital reality. It takes us nowhere at all.</p>

  <p>Mr. Streit and the Count make much of the "menace" of Bolshevism. As I
  pointed out in my previous article Bolshevism as the organised, progressive
  development of a new type of society is not to be found now on earth.
  Bolshevism has done what it was capable of doing, and has come to a phase of
  lassitude or reconstruction; I cannot tell which. It has done great things;
  it has destroyed financial speculation in the ordinary needs of life; it has
  abolished the rentier parasite; has liquidated illiteracy, effaced the spirit
  of serfdom, and now seems to have lost its moral impetus. For a phase it has
  ceased to operate even as a hope. Yet being dead it can still terrify. It can
  still make comfortable, well-off people, who had believed they had really
  managed to secure a pleasant superiority and command over the labour and
  respect of the commoner sort, wake up in the night and scream. And what is
  more, it can still attract subscriptions and adherents to these puerile and
  vacuous antiBolshevik schemes. But I can assure these poor dear rentiers that
  the Golden Age of Investment is over, anyhow; Bolshevism did not end it;
  Bolshevism was only one product of its breakdown.</p>

  <p>Apart from such definite books as those I have named, this Federal Union
  drive seems to be just a vague project for doing nothing, in that it is
  following in the footsteps of the League of Nations Union, and with the same
  assuaging effect.</p>

  <p>All over the world now people are distressed about the future the near
  future, of our social life-as well they may be. There is a smell of blood in
  the air and menacing sounds and strange rurnours of an Immense social
  disintegration. They are far more evident and distressing than they were in
  1918. Many people find the problem of the world outlook and their own outlook
  more and more uncertain and dismaying. They collapse morally at the prospect
  of hard and unfamiliar thinking. What is now called "Escapism" prevails. The
  Chinese take to their opium, which, thanks to the friendly Japanese, they
  find more and more accessible. Here, in London, alcohol, benzedrine, light
  entertainment, "not thinking about it" and getting back to the idea that
  everything is all right really, are most in evidence.</p>

  <p>In Great Britain this Federal Union stuff is the very cheapest dope
  available for that purpose. For the small sum of five shillings you can go to
  meetings and get publications that will assure you that all is well, join
  societies that seem to be organised solely to keep it up that all is well.
  Don't worry those poor brains of yours. That is the quintessence of it. It is
  all a matter of spiritual values; the less materialist you are, that is to
  say, the less you think <i>hard</i>, the better. The sight of so many nice
  people applauding the stirring and reassuring speakers the movement provides
  is very effective as a counterblast to the sterner prophets of duty and
  danger. Our diplomatists and governments, we are told, will act under our
  instruction and arrange for their own abolition. It's all right. Vote for
  Federal Union and pay your five shillings. Just say the words over-the magic
  words, "Federal Union" instead of the old soporific of counting sheep; Then
  you can go to sleep again-until something hits you.</p>

  <p>Well, if I am unjust to these Federal Union schemes, tell me where I go
  wrong. Don't merely say I misjudge them. Tell me what else they do.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec10"
     name="sec10">§ 10. &mdash; THE PROVISIONAL DECLARATION OF RIGHTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LET us leave these fantasies and come back to practical
  politics. I have discussed the practicability of extending war-welded
  federalism until it becomes world-wide, and so brings all the various <i>ad
  hoc</i> organisations it will necessarily develop, for disarmament, for the
  replacement of deported populations, for general economic restoration, and so
  forth, into parallelism with the minor permanent world federalisms. This time
  I don't think anyone will "call" a Peace Conference. We shall find one will
  grow informally out of the war conditions and out of the necessary explicit
  terms for an Armistice with an entirely untrustworthy enemy. One necessity in
  the process is a clear statement, in the broadest and most acceptable terms,
  not of any remote Utopia ahead, nor of any acceptance of things as they are,
  but of the world as reasonable people want to have it now.</p>

  <p>We have such a statement.</p>

  <p>Following a time-honoured precedent of all the free parliamentary nations
  of the world, a great number of people have come to realise the need of a
  clear formulation of creative liberal thought, revised and brought up to
  date. After a discussion, very ably organised by Mr. Ritchie Calder, in which
  thousands of people of every creed and type have participated, a Declaration
  of the Rights of Man has been drawn up by a distinguished committee. I have
  told the story of the growth of that declaration in a companion PENGUIN to
  this-<i>The Rights of Man</i>. The Declaration, as it has emerged from the
  hands of Lord Sankey's Drafting Committee, albeit it remains a profoundly
  revolutionary statement, is nevertheless far more satisfactory than the
  earlier suggestions made in that pamphlet. It does state, I believe, the
  Greatest Common Measure of human goodwill at the present time. It has been
  made acceptable to the professors of almost any form of religious belief-or
  none. It is, indeed, frankly socialistic and frankly cosmopolitan, and yet I
  fail to see how anyone who desires world peace and happiness, whatever his or
  her religion or race may be, can fail to subscribe to it.</p>

  <p>Here it is, Introduction and all. I have, greatly daring, restored a
  clause (in italics in Article 1) which was amputated by an accident in
  committee. It awaits the endorsement of at least the Labour and Liberal
  Parties in Great Britain and of liberal opinion throughout the world. So far
  it remains provisional, and I believe that these bodies may still find a need
  to amend the phrasing of Article 6. Ultimately I hope it may be made
  acceptable to all the Allied and benevolently neutral governments, and
  embodied in their declared war aims. A certain resistance may have to be
  overcome to bring that about, and that is where there seems to be scope for
  immediate activity on the part of every sincere Revolutionary.</p>

  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p class="quote">Within the space of little more than a hundred years there
  has been a complete revolution in the material conditions of human life.
  Invention and discovery have so changed the pace and nature of communications
  round and about the earth that the distances which formerly kept the states
  and nations of mankind apart have now been practically abolished. At the same
  time there has been so gigantic an increase of mechanical power, and such a
  release of human energy, that men's ability either to co-operate with, or to
  injure and oppress one another, and to consume, develop or waste the bounty
  of Nature, has been exaggerated beyond all comparison with former times.</p>

  <p class="quote">This process of change has mounted swiftly and steadily in
  the past third of a century, and is now approaching a climax.</p>

  <p class="quote">It becomes imperative to adjust man's life and institutions
  to the increasing dangers and opportunities of these new circumstances. He is
  being forced to organise cooperation among the medley of separate sovereign
  States which has hitherto served his political ends.</p>

  <p class="quote">At the same time he finds it necessary to rescue his
  economic life from devastation by the immensely enhanced growth of
  profit-seeking business and finance.</p>

  <p class="quote">Political, economic and social collectivisation is being
  forced upon him.</p>

  <p class="quote">He responds to these new conditions blindly and with a great
  wastage of happiness and well-being.</p>

  <p class="quote">Governments are either becoming State collectivisms or
  passing under the sway of monopolist productive and financial
  organisations.</p>

  <p class="quote">Religious organisations, education and the Press are
  subordinated to the will of dictatorial groups and lDdlviduals while
  scientific and literary work and a multitude of social activities, which have
  hitherto been independent and spontaneous, fall under the influence of these
  modern concentrations of power.</p>

  <p class="quote">Neither Governments nor great economic and financial
  combinations were devised to exercise such powers; they grew up in response
  to the requirements of an earlier age.</p>

  <p class="quote">Under the stress of the new conditions, insecurity, abuses
  and tyrannies increase; and liberty, particularly liberty of thought and
  speech, decays.</p>

  <p class="quote">Phase by phase these ill-adapted Governments and controls
  are restricting that free play of the individual mind which is the
  preservative of human efficiency and happiness.</p>

  <p class="quote">The temporary advantage of swift and secret action which
  these monopolisations of power display is gained at the price of profound and
  progressive social demoralisation.</p>

  <p class="quote">Bereft of liberty and sense of responsibility, the peoples
  are manifestly doomed to lapse, after a phase of servile discipline, into
  disorder and violence. Confidence and deliberation give place to hysteria,
  apathy and inefficiency.</p>

  <p class="quote">Everywhere war and monstrous economic exploitation are
  intensified, so that those very same increments of power and opportunity
  which have brought mankind within sight of an age of limitless plenty seem
  likely to be lost again, and, it may be, lost for ever, in a chaotic and
  irremediable social collapse.</p>

  <p class="quote">It becomes clear that a unified political, economic and
  social order can alone put an end to these national and private
  appropriations that now waste the mighty possibilities of our time.</p>

  <p class="quote">The history of the Western peoples has a lesson for all
  mankind.</p>

  <p class="quote">It has been the practice of what are called the democratic
  or Parliamentary countries to meet every enhancement and centralisation of
  power in the past by a definite and vigorous reassertion of the individual
  rights of man.</p>

  <p class="quote">Never before has the demand to revive that precedent been so
  urgent as it is now.</p>

  <p class="quote">We of the Parliamentary democracies recognise the
  inevitability of world reconstruction upon collectivist lines, but, after our
  tradition, we couple with that recognition a Declaration of Rights, so that
  the profound changes now in progress shall produce not an attempted
  reconstruction of human affairs in the dark, but a rational reconstruction
  conceived, and arrived at, in the full light of day.</p>

  <p class="quote">To that time-honoured instrument of a Declaration of Rights
  we therefore return, but now upon a world scale.</p>

  <p class="quote">1.-RIGHT TO LIVE</p>

  <p class="quote">By the word "man" in this Declaration is meant every living
  human being without distinction of age or sex.</p>

  <p class="quote">Every man is a joint inheritor of all the natural resources
  and of the powers, inventions and possibilities accumulated by our
  forerunners.</p>

  <p class="quote">He is entitled, within the measure of these resources and
  without distinction of race, colour or professed beliefs or opinions, to the
  nourishment, covering and medical care needed to realise his full
  possibilities of physical and mental development from birth to death.</p>

  <p class="quote">Notwithstanding the various and unequal qualities of
  individuals, all men shall be deemed absolutely equal in the eyes of the law,
  equally important in social life and equally entitled to the respect of their
  fellow-men.</p>

  <p class="quote">2.-PROTECTION OF MINORS</p>

  <p class="quote">The natural and rightful guardians of those who are not of
  an age to protect themselves are their parents.</p>

  <p class="quote">In default of such parental protection in whole or in part,
  the community, having due regard to the family traditions of the child, shall
  accept or provide alternative guardians.</p>

  <p class="quote">3.-DUTY TO THE COMMUNITY</p>

  <p class="quote">It is the duty of every man not only to respect but to
  uphold and to advance the rights of all other men throughout the world.</p>

  <p class="quote">Furthermore, it is his duty to contribute such service to
  the community as will ensure the performance of those necessary tasks for
  which the incentives which will operate in a free society do not provide.</p>

  <p class="quote">It is only by doing his quota of service that a man can
  justify his partnership in the community.</p>

  <p class="quote">No man shall be conscripted for military or other service to
  which he has a conscientious objection, but to perform no social duty
  whatsoever is to remain unenfranchised and under guardianship.</p>

  <p class="quote">4.-RIGHT TO KNOWLEDGE</p>

  <p class="quote">It is the duty of the community to equip every man with
  sufficient education to enable him to be as useful and interested a citizen
  as his capacity allows. Furthermore, it is the duty of the community to
  render all knowledge available to him and such special education as will give
  him equality of opportunity for the development of his distinctive gifts in
  the service of mankind. He shall have easy and prompt access to all
  information necessary for him to form a judgment upon current events and
  issues.</p>

  <p class="quote">5.-FREBDOM OF THOUGHT AND WORSHIP</p>

  <p class="quote">Every man has a right to the utmost freedom of expression,
  discussion, association and worship.</p>

  <p class="quote">6.-RIGHT TO WORK</p>

  <p class="quote">Subject to the needs of the community, a man may engage in
  any lawful occupation, earning such pay as the contribution that his work
  makes to the welfare of the community may justify.*</p>

  <p class="quote">He is entitled to paid employment and to make suggestions as
  to the kind of employment which he considers himself able to perform. Work
  for the sole object of profit-making shall not be a lawful occupation.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* It has been objected with manifest justice that this
  Article 6 implies that the only employers shall be the State, and that it
  hands over a man's energies to the direction and sanctions of some sort of
  public authority, some labour commissar or what not. Here the intricate
  difficulties of committee work defeated the plain intentions of the drafters.
  Manifestly something was cut out from this Article, and a gap was left and
  never filled up again. Plainly our Drafting Committee failed to assert one of
  the most vital of human rights, the right of every man to make and do things
  for himself or for anyone else and for any consideration or none, provided
  the general welfare is not infringed and there is no speculative
  appropriation of his work. It was that speculative appropriation the
  committee was worrying about. This gap, unless it is amended, would for
  example kill all unlicensed art whatever, all free literature, all
  unsanctioned research, all experiment that officialdom failed to approve. But
  I believe, subject to the criticism of those more experienced upon these
  issues, that a few liberating words will restore the lost intention of the
  clause. Suppose that after the word "justify" we add:<br>
  "Or that the desire of any private individual or individuals for his
  products, his performances or the continuation of his activities may produce
  for him." And I would further insert "freely" after "engage m the opening
  sentence of the Article.<br>
  Until it has been accepted by Parties and Governments, the Declaration
  remains a provisional and unofficIal document capable of amendment. I think
  this gap is. the only serious flaw that has been discovered in it, and I
  believe this gap was made possible by, among other things, the feeling that
  Article 11 would be sufficient to protect the individual from dogmatic
  control.</p>

  <p class="quote">7.-RIGHT IN PERSONAL PROPERTY</p>

  <p class="quote">In the enjoyment of his personal property, lawfully
  possessed, a man is entitled to protection from public or private violence,
  deprivation, compulsion and intimidation.</p>

  <p class="quote">8.-FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT</p>

  <p>A man may move freely about the world at his own expense.</p>

  <p class="quote">His private dwelling, however, and any reasonably limited
  enclosure of which he is the occupant, may be entered only with his consent
  or by a legally qualified person empowered with a warrant as the law may
  direct.</p>

  <p class="quote">So long as by his movement he does not intrude upon the
  private domain of any other citizen, harm, or disfigure or encumber what is
  not his, interfere with, or endanger its proper use, or seriously impair the
  happiness of others, he shall have the right to come and go wherever he
  chooses, by land, air, or water, over any kind of country, mountain,
  moorland, river, lake, sea or ocean, and all the ample spaces of this, his
  world.</p>

  <p class="quote">9.-PERSONAL LIBERTY</p>

  <p class="quote">Unless a man is declared by a competent authority to be a
  danger to himself or to others through mental abnormality, a declaration
  which must be confirmed within seven days and thereafter reviewed at least
  annually, he shall not be restrained for more than twentyfour hours without
  being charged with a definite offence, nor shall he be remanded for a longer
  period than eight days without his consent, nor imprisoned for more than
  three months without a trial.</p>

  <p class="quote">At a reasonable time before his trial, he shall be furnished
  with a copy of the evidence which it is proposed to use against him.</p>

  <p class="quote">At the end of the three months period, if he has not been
  tried and sentenced by due process of the law, he shall be acquitted and
  released.</p>

  <p class="quote">No man shall be charged more than once for the same
  offence.</p>

  <p class="quote">Although he is open to the free criticism of his fellows, a
  man shall have adequate protection from any misrepresentation that may
  distress or injure him.</p>

  <p class="quote">Secret evidence is not permissible. Statements recorded in
  administrative dossiers shall not be used to justify the slightest
  infringement of personal liberty.</p>

  <p class="quote">A dossier is merely a memorandum for administrative use; it
  shall not be used as evidence without proper confirmation in open court.</p>

  <p class="quote">10.-FREEDOM FROM VIOLENCE</p>

  <p class="quote">No man shall be subjected to any sort of mutilation except
  with his own deliberate consent, freely given, nor to forcible handling,
  except in restraint of his own violence, nor to torture, beating or any other
  physical ill-treatment.</p>

  <p class="quote">He shall not be subjected to mental distress, or to
  imprisonment in infected, verminous or otherwise insanitary quarters, or to
  be put into the company of verminous or infectious people.</p>

  <p class="quote">But if he is himself infectious or a danger to the health of
  others, he may be cleansed, disinfected, put in quarantine or otherwise
  restrained so far as may be necessary to prevent harm to his fellows.</p>

  <p class="quote">No one shall be punished vicariously by the selection,
  arrest or ill-treatment of hostages.</p>

  <p class="quote">11.-RIGHT OF LAW-MAKING</p>

  <p class="quote">The rights embodied in this Declaration are fundamental and
  inalienable.</p>

  <p class="quote">In conventional and in administrative matters, but in no
  others, it is an obvious practical necessity for men to limit the free play
  of certain of these fundamental rights.</p>

  <p class="quote">(In, for example, such conventional matters as the rule of
  the road or the protection of money from forgery, and in such administrative
  matters as town and country planning, or public hygiene.)</p>

  <p class="quote">No law, conventional or administrative, shall be binding on
  any man or any section of the community unless it has been made openly with
  the active or tacit acquiescence of every adult citizen concerned, given
  either by direct majority vote of the community affected or by a majority
  vote of his representatives publicly elected.</p>

  <p class="quote">These representatives shall be ultimately responsible for
  all by-laws and for detailed interpretations made in the execution of the
  law.</p>

  <p class="quote">In matters of convention and collective action, man must
  abide by the majority decisions ascertained by electoral methods which give
  effective expression to individual choice. All legislation must be subject to
  public discussion, revision or repeal. No treaties or contracts shall be made
  secretly in the name of the community.</p>

  <p class="quote">The fount of legislation in a free world is the whole
  people, and since life flows on constantly to new citizens, no generation
  can, in whole or in part, surrender or delegate this legislative power,
  inalienably inherent in mankind.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec11"
     name="sec11">§ 11. &mdash; AN OPPOSITION IS THE ESSENCE OF
     DEMOCRACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN this Declaration of Rights we have, I believe, the
  substantial material for a very important implement in the work of world
  reconstruction. So soon as the vehement stresses of the present war situation
  are sufficiently alleviated to permit a resumption of constructive political
  discussion, this instrument, with some such necessary amendment as I have
  suggested to Article 6, an amendment which would best come from the Labour
  organisations of the world, could be brought into effective political action.
  How that can be done is the next phase in our discussion. But first, it is
  advisable to get a rather clearer understanding of certain terms that are
  used habitually in such an exasperatingly loose and misleading way as to rob
  them of most of their effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Just as we have cleared up the meaning of the word "' federalism" so now
  let us consider what we mean exactly by "political democracy." The essential
  difference between democratic and absolute rule is, I suggest, that in a
  democracy a revolutionary movement need not be the violent insurgent upheaval
  it necessarily becomes under an absolutism. This is because in every
  Parliamentary country there exists, as a necessary part of the political
  organisation of that country, an Opposition. It is remarkable how few
  foreigners who are unaccustomed to democratic institutions realise the real
  significance of an opposition. <i>The existence of an opposition is the
  fundamental political distinction of democracies.</i> (Forgive these italics.
  But this is a very vital point.)</p>

  <p>In the absolutisms, there is the monarch, the gang, the dictatorship or
  the oligarchy, and that is the State, the whole State, the sole Government,
  and there is nothing to temper it. If you want to get rid of it, you must
  blow it out of existence with a revolutionary explosion. There is no
  revolution possible there but explosion, and so it is that all absolutisms
  end. So ended the absolute monarchy in France and Czarism in Russia. But a
  democracy, as we understand it to-daya modern democracy-is a more complicated
  and higher order of government than any absolutism. It has come into
  existence only in the last few hundred years, while a bullying
  authoritarianism is as old as mankind. It is a government with a <i>potential
  revolution incorporated in its structure</i>. The opposition is a body which
  exists to criticise, mitigate or replace the prevailing regime. That is the
  very essence of democracy. It is two-handed. It has taken Revolution into its
  bosom. It has a left hand and a right. <i>In a genuine democracy, the
  opposition stands prepared to get rid of the existing regime and to change
  the domestic or foreign policy of the government without limit.</i></p>

  <p>I put it to you tbat this double-handed tradition of democracy is a
  profoundly important fact in the present situation. It gives us the clue to a
  comparatively peaceful world revolution. It affords a method by which power
  can be readjusted witbout killing or cruelty, by stages if necessary, and
  with every sort of mitigation to the abdicating order.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="sec12"
     name="sec12">§ 12. &mdash; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD
     REVOLUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So I put before you the elements, as I conceive them, of a
  world pacification and of a world reconstruction. I put it to you that we
  have before us here all that is necessary for a complete world revolution.
  Upon the lines I have drawn it would be a possible thing now to link all the
  liberal-spirited oppositions in the world by their acceptance of this common
  Declaration of Rights which is now awaiting completion and endorsement, and
  to mould their antagonisms to the various warring national governments they
  face, into one common pattern of world peace and revolutionary world
  reconstruction.</p>

  <p>We have no need for a new world revolutionary party. We do not want to
  multiply parties, we want to consolidate them. We want to fuse them by a
  common idea, that will dissolve away all the petty intrigues and jealousies
  that now break them up and destroy the hopes of their supporters. We can say
  to them: "Accept the Declaration or get out of the way." We need indeed a
  world movement to use this Declaration, but the essential factors for
  revolution are already to hand. Everywhere in the democratic countries we
  have the institutional material needed for a rapid fusion of commonsense men
  and common people into one creative World Opposition.</p>

  <p>Almost everywhere we shall find a new Declaration of Rights opposed,
  ignored and stifled by Governments, ruling classes and authoritative people
  whose advantages it threatens. Everywhere they will be trying to dodge its
  essential rightness. Everywhere they will be challenged, with the insistent
  demand that they justify their evasion. And put to the question they will
  find it very hard to justify that evasion.</p>

  <p>"How," the doubter may ask, "will you induce these wicked national
  sovereign governments and imperialisms and this tangle of financial interests
  and credit systems, with which they are associated, to abandon any essential
  international powers they exercise? Internationalism in little conveniences,
  post, hygiene, vice control, they will no doubt concede readily enough. But
  how will they ever agree, for example, to a permanent international air
  control, to a standing international disarmament police, to the complete
  effacement of passport and customs control; all of which are obviously parts
  of a rational world order? " That is exactly where this fundamentally
  democratic idea, the idea of one world opposition, lined up by a Declaration
  of Human Rights and prepared to "take over" everywhere, in the same spirit,
  comes in.</p>

  <p>Governments and Foreign Offices, though reluctant to abolish themselves,
  yet faced by an intelligent and critical revolutionary world opposition,
  which I think I have given every reason for believing could be brought into
  existence very rapidly at the present time, will prove capable, you will
  find, of a considerable amount of appeasement, and will yield this and yield
  that, step by step, provided they are not attacked directly by proposals of
  self-extinction. You must remember that even now they are being forced to a
  considerable degree of war-welded federation. Even the "neutrals" are being
  forced that way. It will not be we, the reasonable people, who will be
  putting something over on our governments at the end of the war; it will be
  they who will be domg their best to recover and dodge back to the old order
  of things. A unified world Opposition will press upon them with the force of
  plain necessity. Step by step, they will yield, still clinging to the forms
  of power and retreating as they go. Step by step they will cease to be "the
  powers that be," and become dignitaries and honourable traditions. They need
  never be overthrown in any melodramatic fashion; they may fade out. Except
  for outbursts of revolutionary temper, the end of the national sovereign
  state may be almost painless.</p>

  <p><i>It is not necessary to destroy existing governments as such.</i> The
  idea of a federal world does not involve the creation of a common world
  government resembling the sovereign governments of the present time, pushing
  them aside and taking their place like a conqueror. It does not threaten in
  the least the racial and cultural distinctions of mankind. Our imaginations
  are too obsessed by the United States of America, and we have horrid dreams
  of a World President and a Senate and a Lower House of Mankind. But it is
  quite possible to anticipate a world transport control, air, shipping and
  rail included, a world production control, a world system of barter-for
  organised barter is marching upon us now in seven-league boots-a world
  control of hygiene, education and information, without anything you can call
  a central government at all.</p>

  <p>For some people that will prove a hard saying. Some where, they feel,
  there must be a powerful person or body of persons which will decide, "Do
  this" or "Do that." Yet there is something a little infantile about that. Is
  it as necessary as may seem at the first glance-so far as the world-wide
  services, all these functional organisations, are concerned? Authority may be
  necessary in what one might call matters of opinion. But is a world transport
  system, a proper distribution of staple products, the health of the race, the
  common peace, the issue of money, the survey and mapping of the world, or
  scientific and general education, really a matter of opinion? Is there not,
  if only we knew it, a <i>right thingto do</i> in these matters? I suggest
  that with every increment of knowledge in the world, it is less and less
  necessary for an overriding government to do the ruling. The knowledge
  organisation, in the light of a free public discussion, will give the rule.
  Faced with famine or pestilence, for example, an ignorant population may need
  " firm government" and even a "strong man" to save it from panic and
  disaster. An educated community in the same case asks intelligent questions
  and, after due scrutiny, does the <i>right thing to do</i>.</p>

  <p>Manifestly this involves an <i>ad hoc</i> federation of the intellectual
  organisations of the world. That is too complex an issue to expound here. I
  have written about it in World Brain, and I will not regurgitate that book
  here. At the roots of most of the troubles of mankind to-day lies a terrible
  under-nourishment of minds. But upon that I will refrain from expansion here.
  So I submit my ideas for your consideration. I shall be bitterly disappointed
  if my points are not fully I examined and either confuted or accepted. And if
  you accept them, the business cannot rest there; you have to get to work. I
  am quite sure a lot of people will get to work, anyhow . You can start
  pressure upon your political representatives, upon your party organisations
  and so on, to subscribe definitely to a new Declaration of Rights. You have
  it now. Practically that job, subject to the completion of Article 6, is
  done. You can write to your local papers to increase the pressure upon
  politicians to accept it or give a reason why. You can make any Liberal or
  Labour candidate extremely uncomfortable if asked to explain why he will not
  accept it and get on with it. How a Communist can dodge it will be very
  interesting. Quite a small group of people in any constituency who insist on
  a full, unambiguous acceptance of the Declaration of Rights and make a
  strenuous fuss if they do not get it from their candidate, can incline a
  candidate to conform. And if there is no group handy, there is yourself, with
  a mouth and a pen and a vote. You can spread the idea of this varied yet
  federated world, which is so little understood, which is still thought of by
  so many people as if it were a sort of monstrous fusion of existing
  governments. The Declaration of Rights should be taught everywhere. You can
  get busy about the lessons taught in your schools, the books in your public
  libraries....</p>

  <p>Let me say in conclusion, by way of summary, that the backbone of my hope
  for a new world is this possibility of a <i>world-wide coalescence of all the
  scattered forces of creation and protest in the human heart, into one
  consciously revolutionary movement based on the declared rights of man.</i>
  It is an entirely practicable proposal. All over the democracies of the world
  now we can call into being this uniform opposition, inspired by a common idea
  of world unity. In the non-democratic countries, of course, it will be a
  definitely insurrectionary movement. And the policy it must press upon
  governments everywhere is the preservation of the <i>ad hoc</i> war-welded
  federalisms that are being brought into existence now, function by function,
  and their extension to the whole world, as a permanent peace settlement.</p>

  <p>"No restoration, no attempted restoration, of the old order," may well be
  our slogan. You see how these two essential democratic institutions, the
  tried and tested institutions, of a consolidated Opposition and of a
  Declaration of the Rights of Man, dovetail into the plan of creative
  political action I am putting before you, and you can see how hard it will be
  to stop this contagious, creative liberalism once it is started. This and
  this alone, so far as I can see, is the way of escape for our species from
  chaos. Call it world reconstruction, world pacification, world union or world
  revolution, as you will, but do not rashly upon some minor issue refuse
  participation in these living possibilities.</p>

  <h2><a id="sec13"
     name="sec13">§ 13. &mdash; THAT NEW WORLD AFTER THE WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE preceding sections of this pamphlet give the essence of
  what I have been able to make out of the needs and possibilities of the
  present time. But there are two appendices I want to make. The first of these
  bears upon one of the most difficult problems that arise when we try to
  figure to ourselves the way of living the new peace will mean for us. For
  plainly the old peace of the comfortable classes can never return again. The
  new peace has to be a peace for every man or none. I have been writing a
  novel which is these days of paper shortage mayor may not be published,
  <i>Babes in the Darkling Wood</i>, and in it a youngster who is on a
  minesweeper writes a letter home. I intend him to be as intelligent as I know
  how and I make him say exactly what I want said. So I will quote him here
  instead of writing it all over again.</p>

  <p>He writes:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Our people detest militarism and at the same time take to
  fighting very readily. It is nonsense to pretend the mass of English people
  are unhappy now. The country is profoundly excited, and you can't be really
  unhappy when you are stirred up. This war is going to be a near thing for us
  all, and we like it. With a sort of grim excitement. The one dream of old
  Smithers, our skipper, for example, is to 'do a bit on his own.' He feels he
  has never really lived before. If we come on a German cruiser by any chance,
  I'm certain he'll go straight for it. He'll chase it, and he'll keep banging
  away at it until we are blown into the air. And we shall be cheering him on,
  and who knows whether we shan't get away with it?</p>

  <p class="quote">"That's all very well for the moment. But it takes us
  nowhere. This can't go on for ever. We talk among ourselves here about how
  things are to end, but when it comes to that we are all at sixes and sevens.
  Theoretically all our chaps want a world at peace. But they discuss peace
  half-heartedly, as though it was some sort of pi-jaw, and then they go and
  fondle the new gun we have been given. It's a lovely bit of machinery.
  They've never had their hands on anything so competent. Or so simple. Our
  dream is to bring down a raider. 'Blast that peace of yours!' they say.
  'Let's win the war first.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Never will our people look forward. Now the bulk of them, I
  realise, don't want to. It's too perplexing. The peace-or anyhow the time for
  peace-may catch us just as unprepared as the war did.... What we have to
  realise is that the sort of full, long-range life we want has to look good
  and be made believable, for everyone, if ever we are to get it....</p>

  <p class="quote">"That's the practical hitch. If I have got any new idea,
  it's that. I mean, until you can give these chaps something as lovely and
  satisfying as they find this gun of ours-microscopes, observatories,
  stratosphere travel, apparatus for the photographic survey of the world,
  things that will make the rocks and waters of the earth, the sky above and
  the unknown beneath our feet, yield a sense of power, these rank and file men
  are going to enjoy war, far more than any peace they have ever yet been
  offered. What do we promise the common men here or in France or Germany or
  anywhere? Nothing but to go back to the street corner. We don't even promise
  them something to hammer. Are they likely to think seriously of peace when
  peace has no other face than the face of a tepid bore? With the nobility and
  gentry scrambling back to all the positions of advantage, romping about with
  opportunity while the heroes, etc., are back on the dole. Allowed to look on
  again. These boys just say 'Peace' because they've been taught to say it.
  They'll blast it all right when they get it.... Even if the world doesn't
  need rebuilding from top to bottom, we ought to set about rebuilding it,
  carving it up and throwing it about, just for the excitement. Just to keep
  their souls alive....</p>

  <p class="quote">"Will these old men of the City and the stately homes of
  England and so forth ever release that stagnating, paralysing grip that holds
  back our people and all the people in our Empire from any fullness of life,
  until in sheer despair of their heavy monopolisation we are driven to wrench
  them off violently?..."</p>

  <p>The whole of this present book is an attempt to discover a possible answer

  <h2><a id="sec14"
     name="sec14">§ 14. &mdash; A LESSON FROM 1918</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That is one appendix to this pamphlet. Now, by way of a
  further appendix and a warning, I am going to reprint a document that was
  drawn up twenty-two years ago, chiefly by Dr. J.W. Headlam Morley and myself,
  as a memorandum for the propaganda department of Crewe House. It dates in
  certain details, but on the whole, because of the lack of fulfillment, there
  is much of it that might have been written this month.</p>

  <p>This is how we saw things in May, 1918.</p>

  <h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p class="quote">"Propaganda in Germany, as in other enemy countries, must
  obviously be based upon a clear Allied policy. Hitherto Allied policy and
  Allied war aims have been defined too loosely to be comprehensible to the
  Germans. "The real aim of the Allies is not only to beat the enemy, but to
  establish a world peace that shall preclude the resumption of war. Successful
  propaganda in Germany presupposes the clear definition of the kind of world
  settlement which the Allies are determined to secure and the place of Germany
  in it.</p>

  <p>"The points to be brought home to the Germans are:</p>

  <p>"I The determination of the Allies to continue the war until Germany
  accepts the Allied peace settlement.</p>

  <p>"2. The existing alliance as a Fighting League of Free Nations will be
  deepened and extended and the military, naval, financial and economic
  resou;ces of its members will be pooled until:</p>

  <p>"(a) Its military purpose is achieved, and</p>

  <p>"(b) Peace is established on lasting foundations.</p>

  <p>"German minds are particularly susceptible to systematic statements. They
  are accustomed to discuss and understand co-ordinate projects. The ideas
  represented by the phrase 'Berlin-Baghdad' and 'Mittel-Europa' have been
  fully explained to them and now form the bases of German political thought.
  Other projects, represented by 'Berlin-Teheran' and 'Berlin-Tokyo' are
  becoming familiar to them. Against these ideas the Allies have not yet set up
  any comprehensive and comprehensible scheme of world-organisation. There is
  no Allied counterpart of Naumann's' Mittel-Europa' which the neutral and
  German Press could discuss as a practical proposition. This counterpart
  should be created without delay by competent Allied writers. It would form an
  effective basis for propaganda, and would work automatically.</p>

  <p>"It follows that one of the first requisites is to study and to lay down
  the lines of a practical League of Free Nations. The present alliance must be
  taken as the nucleus of any such League. Its control of raw materials, of
  shipping, and its power to exclude for an indefinite period enemy or even
  neutral peoples until they subscribe to and give pledges of their acceptance
  of its principles should be emphasised. It should be pointed out that nothing
  stands between enemy peoples and a lasting peace except the predatory designs
  of their ruling dynasties and military and economic castes; that the design
  of the Allies is not to crush any people, . but. to assure the freedom of all
  on a basis of self-determination to be exercised under definite guarantees of
  justice and fair play; that, unless enemy peoples accept the Allied
  conception of a world peace settlement, it will be impossible for them to
  repair the havoc oftbe present war, to avert utter financial ruin, and to
  save themselves from prolonged misery; and that the longer the struggle lasts
  the deeper will become the hatred of everything German in the non-German
  world, and the heavier the social and economic handicap under which the enemy
  peoples will labour, even after their admission into a League of Nations.</p>

  <p>"The primary war aim of the Allies thus becomes the changing of Germany,
  not only in the interest of the Allied League, but in that of the German
  people itself. Without the honest co-operation of Germany, disarmament on a
  large scale would be impossible, and, without disarmament, social and
  economic reconstruction would be impracticable. Germany has, therefore, to
  choose between her own permanent ruin by adhering to her present system of
  government and policy and the prospect of economic and political redemption
  by overthrowing her militarist system so as to be able to join honestly in
  the Allied scheme of world organisation.</p>

  <h3>MEMORANDUM</h3>

  <p class="quote">"It has become manifest that for the purposes of an
  efficient pro-Ally propaganda in neutral and enemy countries a clear and full
  statement of the war aims of the Allies is vitally necessary. What is wanted
  is something in the nature of an authoritative text to which propagandists
  may refer with confidence and which can be made the standard of their
  activities. It is not sufficient to recount the sins of Germany and to assert
  that the defeat of Germany is the Allied war aim. What all the world desires
  to know is what is to happen after the war. The real war aun of a
  belligerent, it is more and more. understood, is not merely victory, but a
  peace of a certam character which that belligerent desires shall arise out of
  that victory. What, therefore, is the peace sought by the Allies?</p>

  <p class="quote">"It would be superfluous even to summarise here the primary
  case of the Allies, that the war is on their part a war to resist the
  military aggression of Germany assisted by the landowning Magyars of Hungary,
  the Turks and the King of Bulgaria, upon the rest of mankind. It is a war
  against belligerence, against aggressive war and the preparation for
  aggressive war. Such it was in its beginning, and such it remains. But it
  would be idle to pretend that the ideas of the Government and peoples allied
  against Germany have not developed very greatly during the years of the war.
  There has been a deepening realisation of the danger to mankind of existing
  political divisions and separations, a great experience in the suffering,
  destruction and waste of war; a quickening of consciences against conquests,
  annexations and subjugations; and a general clearing up of ideas that have
  hitherto stood in the way of an organised world peace. While German
  Imperialism, to judge by the utterances of its accredited heads, and by the
  behaviour of Germany in the temporarily disorganised States on her Eastern
  front, is still as truculent, aggressive and treacherous as ever, the mind of
  her antagonists has learnt and has matured. There has arisen in the great
  world outside the inner lives of the Central Powers a will that grows to
  gigantic proportions, that altogether overshadows the boasted will to power
  of the German junker and exploiter, the will to a world peace. It is like the
  will of an experienced man set against the will of an obstinate and selfish
  youth. The war aims of the anti-German Allies take more and more definitely
  the form of a world of States leagued together to maintain a common law, to
  submit their mutual differences to a conclusive tribunal, to protect weak
  communities, to restrain and suppress war threats and war preparations
  throughout the earth.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Steadfastly the great peoples of the world outside the
  shadow of German Imperial domination have been working their way to
  unanimity, while the ruling intelligences of Germany have been scheming for
  the base advantages of conquest; while they have been undermining, confusing
  and demoralising the mentality of Russia, crushing down the subject peoples
  of the AustroHungarian Imperialism, and threatening and cajoling neutrals
  there has been a wide, free movement in the minds of their antagonists
  towards the restraint and wisdom of a greater and nobler phase in human
  affairs. The thought of the world crystallises now about a phrase, the phrase
  'The League of Free Nations.' The war aims of the Allies become more and more
  explicitly associated with the spirit and implications of that.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Like all such phrases, 'The League of Free Nations' is
  subject to a great variety of detailed interpretation, but its broad
  intentions can now be stated without much risk of dissent. The ideal would,
  of course, include all the nations of the earth, including a Germany purged
  of her military aggressiveness; it involves some sort of INTERNATIONAL
  CONGRESS that can revise, codify, amend and extend intemationallaw, a supreme
  Court of Law in which States may sue and be sued, and whose decision the
  League will be pledged to enforce, and the supervision, limitation and use of
  armaments under the direction of the international congress. It is also felt
  very widely that such a congress must seta restraint upon competitive and
  unsanctioned 'expansionist' movements into unsettled and disordered regions,
  must act as the guardian of feeble races and communities, and must be
  empowered to make conclusive decisions upon questions of transport, tariffs,
  access to raw material, migration and international intercourse
  generally.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The constitution of this congress remains indefinite; it is
  the crucial matter upon which the best thought of the world is working at the
  present time. But given the prospect of a suitable copgress there can be
  little dispute that the great Imperial Powers among the Allies are now
  prepared for great and generous limitations of their sovereignty in the
  matter of armaments, of tropical possessions, and of subject peoples in the
  common interest of mankind. The spectacle of German Imperialism, boastful,
  selfish, narrow and altogether hateful, in its terrible blood-dance through
  Europe, has been an object-lesson to humanity against excesses of national
  vanity and national egotism and against Imperial pride. Among the Allies, the
  two chief Imperial Powers, measured by the extent of territory they control,
  are Britain and France, and each of these is more completely prepared to-day
  than ever it has been before to consider its imperial possessions as a trust
  for their inhabitants and for mankind, and its position in the more fertile
  and less settled regions of the world as that of a mandatory and trustee.
  These admissions involve a plain prospect and promise of the ultimate release
  and liberation of all the peoples in these great and variegated Empires to
  complete world-citizenship.</p>

  <p class="quote">"But in using the phrase 'The League of Nations' it may be
  well to dispel certain misconceptions that have arisen through the
  experimental preparation by more or less irresponsible persons and societies
  of elaborate schemes and constitutions of such a league. Proposals have been
  printed and published, for example, of a Court of World Conciliation, in
  which each sovereign State will be represented by one member-Montenegro, for
  example, by one, and the British Empire by one-and other proposals have been
  mooted of a Congress of the League of Nations, in which such States as Hayti,
  Abyssinia and the like will be represented by one or two representatives, and
  France and Great Britain by five or six. All such projects should be put out
  of mind when the phrases 'League of Free Nations' is used by responsible
  speakers for the Allied Powers. Certain most obvious considerations have
  evidently been overlooked by the framers of such proposals. It will, for
  example, be a manifest disadvantage to the smaller Powers to be at all
  over-represented upon the Congress of any such League; it may even be
  desirable that certain of them should not have a voting representative at
  all, for this reason, that a great Power still cherishing an aggressive
  spirit would certainly attempt, as the beginning of its aggression, to compel
  adjacent small Powers to send representatives practically chosen by itself.
  The coarse fact of the case in regard to an imnediate world peace is this,
  that only five or six great Powers possess sufficient economic resources to
  make war under modem conditions at the present time, namely, the United
  States of America, Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan and, doubtfully,
  AustriaHungary. Italy suffers under the disadvantage that she has no coal
  supply. These five or six Powers we may say, therefore, permit war and can
  prevent it. They are at present necessarily the custodians of the peace of
  the world, and it is pedantry not to admit that this gives them a practical
  claim to preponderance in the opening Congress of the World League. It may be
  pointed out that a small State with a voice in the discussions, but no vote
  in the decisions of the League, would logically be excused from the liability
  to assist in enforcing those decisions.</p>

  <p class="quote">"But this question of the constitution of a world Congress
  is not to be solved by making a coarse classification of States into large
  and war-capable Powers and small and weak Powers. Take the case of Italy, for
  example: though she is almost incapable of sustaining a war against the world
  by herself because of her weakness in th.e matter of coal, she can as an ally
  be at once of enormous importance. Take the case of Spain again, a very
  similar case. And whatever the war ability of Latin-America may be to-day,
  there can be no question that this great constellation of States must count
  very heavily in the framing of the world of to-morrow. Then, again, we have
  to consider the vast future possibilities of the Chinese Republic, with coal,
  steel and a magnificent industrial population, and the probable
  reconstruction of Eastern Europe and a renascence of Russia which may give
  the world a loose-knit but collectivelyimportant Slavonic confederation.
  While an isolated small Power within the orbit of attraction of a large
  Power, a State of 5,000,000 people or less, must always remain a difficult
  problem in the world representation, it is clear that something like an
  adequate representation of small and weak Powers becomes possible so soon as
  they develop a disposition towards aggregation, for the purposes of world
  politics, into associations with States racially, linguistically, and
  historically akin to them. The trend of Allied opinion is to place not Peru
  or Ukrainia, nor Norway, nor Finland on a level with the United States of
  America or the British Empire at the League of Nations Congress, but to
  prepare the way for adequate representation through a preliminary
  Latin-American ora Slavonic or a Scandinavian Confederation, which could
  speak with a common idea at the World Congress.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It should be manifest that there is one Power whose
  splendid achievement in this war, and whose particular needs justify her
  over-representation (as measured by material wealth and millions of
  population) upon the Congress of the League, and that is France. It is open
  to question whether Italy should not also be disproportionately
  over-represented, seeing that she will not have, as Spain will have, the
  moral reinforcement of kindred nations overseas. And with regard to the
  British Empire, seeing that there exists no real Imperial legislature, it is
  open to consideration whether Canada, South Africa and Australasia should
  come into the Council as separate nationalities. The Asiatic and African
  possessions of Britain and France, Belgium and Italy, possessions, that is,
  which have no self-government, might possibly for a time be represented by
  members appointed by the governing power in each case. These are merely
  suggestions here, indications of a disposition of mind, but they are
  suggestions upon which it is necessary for the Allied Powers to decide as
  speedily as possible. The effective working out of this problem of the League
  of Nations Congress by the Allies without undue delay is as vital a part of
  the Allied policy as the effective conduct of the war.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It has to be recognised that the institution of a League of
  Nations precludes any annexations or any military interference with any
  peoples whatever, without a mandate from the Congress of the League. The
  League must directly or indirectly become the guardian of all unsettled
  regions and order must be kept ana development promoted by it in such
  derelict regions as Mesopotamia and Armenia, for example, have now become. In
  these latter instances it is open to consideration whether the League should
  operate through some single power acting as a mandatory of the League, or
  else by international forces under the control of the League as a whole.
  Theoretically the latter course is to be preferred, but there are enormous
  practical advantages in many cases to be urged for the former. The Allies
  have indeed had a considerable experience during the war of joint controls
  and joint expeditions; there has been a great education in internationalism
  since August, 1914; but nevertheless the end of the war is likely to come
  long before any real international forces have been evolved. It is, however,
  towards the ultimate use of international forces in such cases that the joint
  policy of the Allies is plainly and openly directed.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The bringing of the League into practical politics
  profoundly affects the question of territorial adjustment after the war. The
  Allies are bound in honour to follow the will of France in the matter of
  Alsace-Lorraine, and the rectification of the Italian frontier and the
  bringing of the bulk of the Italian-speaking population, now under Austrian
  dominion, into one ring-fence with Italy, also seem a necessary part of a
  world pacification. It is, however, of far less importance in the war aims of
  the Allies that this and that particular scrap of territory should change
  hands from the control of one group of combatants to that of the other, than
  that the present practical ascendency of German Imperialism over the
  resources of the Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Czech, Jugo-Slav, Finnish, and
  Roumanian peoples should cease. The war aim of the Allies in Eastern Europe
  is to create in the place of the present Austro-Hungaran Empire a larger
  synthesis of associated States, something in the nature of an 'East Central
  European League,' within the League of Nations, a confederation that might
  possibly reach from Poland to the Black and Adriatic Seas, and have also
  access to, if not a port upon, the Baltic at Danzig. The Allies are
  necessarily obliged to wait upon the development of affairs in Russia, but
  the hopes and efforts of the Allies are towards a reconciliation of at least
  Great Russia, Siberia and Ukrainia into a workable association within the
  League. It is premature to speculate upon the grouping of Finland at the
  present time. Relieved of the feverish and impossible ambitions the political
  weaknesses of these peoples have stimulated, a free and united Germany could
  then become one of the predominant partners in the World League of Free
  Nations. The Allies do not propose an unconditional return of the former
  Mrican possessions of Germany, but they contemplate an over-ruling
  international regime in Mrica between the Sahara and the Zambesi, restraining
  armament, reorganising native education, and giving absolute equality to
  trade to all the nations in the League. Such an international regime under
  the League may not be incompatible with the retention of national flags in
  the former 'possessions' of the leagued Powers.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Exact territorial definition does not appear to the Allies
  to be of nearly such importance as the establishment of a common system of
  disarmament and a common effort to restore the ravages of the war. The full
  effect of the war is still not realised by the mass of the belligerent
  peoples, more especially in America and Western Europe, where life is still
  fairly comfortable. There has already been a destruction not merely of the
  political but of the social order over great areas of the world, especially
  in Eastern Europe, and it is doubtful whether any peace can restore these
  disorganised areas to anything like their former productivity for many years.
  A universal shortage not merely of man-power, but of transport and machinery
  available for the purposes of peace cannot be avoided. It is doubtful,
  moreover, if social discipline in the ports of the British Empire and America
  will be strong enough to restrain an organised resistance to the use of
  German shipping after the war for any purpose and to the use of Allied
  shipping for the transport of goods to and from Germany on the part of Allied
  and neutral seamen and transport workers indignant at the U-boat campaign;
  moreover, there is a world-wide cry for a vindictive trade boycott after the
  war against Germany, and for organised boycotts that may further restrict the
  process of economic world recovery. It is doubtful if the menace of these
  'revenge' movements and the difficulty of controlling them in democratic
  States is properly appreciated in Germany. The militarist Government of
  Germany, fighting now for bare existence, is concealing from its people this
  world-wide disposition to boycott German trade and industry at any cost to
  the boycotting populations, and buoying them up with preposterous hopes of
  'business as usual' as soon as peace is made. The fact has to be faced that
  while the present German Government remains no such economic resumption is
  possible. The 'War-after-the-War' possibility has to be added to the economic
  destruction in Russia, Belgium and elsewhere in any estimate of the
  situtation after the war.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The plain prospect of material disorganisation thus opened
  should alone suffice to establish the absolute necessity for peace now of
  such a nature as will permit a world-wide concentration upon reconstruction,
  in good faith and without any complications of enmity and hostility. But in
  addition to the material destruction and dislocation and to the 'hatred'
  disorganisation already noted, the financial transactions of the last few
  years have created a monetary inflation which, without the concerted action
  of all the Powers, may mean a collapse of world credit. Add now the plain
  necessity for continued armament if a real League of Nations is not attained.
  Without any exaggeration the prospect of the nations facing these economic
  difficulties in an atmosphere of continuing hostility, intrigue and conflict.
  under a continuing weight of armaments, and with a continuing distrust, is a
  hopeless one. The consequences stare us in the face; Russia is only the first
  instance of what must happen generally. The alternative to a real League of
  Nations is the steady descent of our civilisation towards a condition of
  political and social fragmentation such as the world has not seen since the
  fall of the Roman Empire. The honest co-operation of Germany in the League of
  Nations, in disarmament and in world reconstruction is, therefore,
  fundamentally necessary. There is now no other rational policy.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And since it is impossible to hope for any such help or
  co-ordination from the Germany of the Belgian outrage, the Brest-Litovsk
  Treaty, the betrayal of Ukrainia, THE CHANGING OF GERMANY becomes a primary
  war aim, the primary war aim for the Allies. How Germany is to be changed is
  a complex question. The word Revolution is, perhaps, to be deprecated. We do
  not, for instance, desire a Bolshevik breakdown in Germany, which would make
  her economically useless to mankind. We look therefore, not so much to the
  German peasant and labourer as to the ordinary, fairly well-educated mediocre
  German for co-operation in the reinstatement of civilisation. Change there
  must be in Germany; in the spirit in which the Government is conducted, in
  the persons who exercise the control, and in the relative influence of
  different classes in the country. The sharpest distinction, therefore, has to
  be drawn between Germany and its present Government in all our propaganda and
  public utterances; and a constant appeal has to be made by the statesmen of
  the Alliance, and by a frank and open propaganda through the Germans of the
  United States of America and of Switzerland, through neutral countries and by
  every possible means, from Germany Junker to Germany sober. We may be
  inclined to believe that every German is something of a Junker, we have to
  remember he is also potentially a reasonable man.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And, meanwhile, the Allies must continue with haste and
  diligence to fight and defeat Junker Germany, which cannot possibly conquer
  but which may nevertheless succeed in ruining the world. They must fight the
  German armies upon the fronts, they must fight an unregenerate Germany
  economically and politically, and they must bring home to the German reason
  and conscience at home by an intensive air war and by propaganda alike, the
  real impossibility of these conceptions of national pride and aggressiveness
  in which the German population has been bred."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>That is how Crewe House was trying to put a shape upon things in 1918.
  Ancient history, you will say. Unhappily none of this story has become
  ancient history. Lord Northcliffe was a man of great mental instability; at
  his best his apprehensions were rapid and lucid. Later on he went back upon
  us. His brother, Lord Rothermere, in flat contradiction to our policy, was
  filling the Harmsworth newspapers with the wildest threatenings against
  Germany, and when I insisted that this must cease, Northc1itfe was either
  unwilling or powerless to stop it. Nor were we able to get the Foreign Office
  to fall in with this shape we sought to put upon things. Sir Campbell Stuart
  says it approved our memorandum, but that was not the case. We were kept in
  ignorance of the secret understandings and diplomatic commitments that were
  undermining the possibility of a secure peace. That secrecy is as true to-day
  of our Foreign Office as it was then. Now as then we do not know and nobody
  knows what it imagines it is up to. In the concluding year of that earlier
  war, there was a War Aims Controversy. There needs to be another and a more
  emphatic and world-wide War Aims discussion now. We clamoured for a public
  statement to all the world of what we fought for. We try to clamour now.
  (With a shortage of paper and the B.B.C. under government control). So long
  as we have Lord Halifax, that sporting saint, in the Foreign Office, or
  anyone of his type, it is preposterous to hope for anything of the sort. We
  shall fight, but we shall fight under a cloud of baffiing misapprehension.
  The Allied Governments will be presented not only to their own people but to
  the doubting would-be-friend abroad, as something ambiguous and
  untrustworthy. How long are we to go on telling our own people and the world:
  "Open your mouth and shut your eyes and see what an anti-Bolshevik Tory
  Churchman will give you." This is the monstrous absurdity of our present
  phase.</p>

  <p>I have already made some bitter comments on the way in which the French
  were let down monetarily and the nationalised services looted by private
  ownership in the pseudo-Reconstruction that followed 1918. The story is told
  simply and plainly in the later editions of The Outline of History (1931).
  What fills me with dismay as I look over this Crewe House document and recall
  its ineffectiveness, is the parallelism of our problem after two and twenty
  years. You see what happened to the hopes of my generation and you see what
  may happen to yours. You see why the world revolutionary must set himself now
  to anticipate and resist the return of the old order and how plainly it is
  manifest that this time we must go on along the lines we failed to pursue in
  that last phase of hope and opportunity. Go on with it now. Make this in
  reality the war to end war. There is no other way to end war, and there is
  very little time remaining.</p><br>
