  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE been asked to set down as simply and clearly as I
can, in one
  compact book, the reality of the human situation; that is to say I have been
  asked to state the world as I see it and what is happening to it. This is the
  result.</p>

  <p>A very large part of my conscious life has been a struggle for effective
  knowledge. I have attempted to collect and summarise existing knowledge so
  that it could be made available in human living, and to induce other and
  abler people to take up the same work, I have worked also to bring together
  incompatible systems of thinking about reality, systems which ignore each
  other stupidly and wastefully, and are manifestly answerable for much
  fundamental confusion in human thought. These unresolved, contradictory
  philosophies and theologies encumber the human mind, and their irresolution
  is largely due to an elaborate mutual disregard. I am exceptionally
  intolerant of such inconsistencies, because if I attempt to deal with them
  they worry and entangle me. I cannot make the necessary reservations and
  adjustments.</p>

  <p>The peculiar strength and the peculiar weakness of my mind are one and the
  same quality. Put favorably, mine is a very direct mind; put unfavorably, it
  is unsubtle. I am impatient of complicating details and conventional
  mis-statements because I am afraid of them. The reader will find this book
  ego-centered, for so we all began, and also insistent. I <i>hammer</i> at my
  main ideas, and this is an offense to delicate-minded people. If a door is
  not open I say it is shut, and I am impatient with the suggestion of worldly
  wisdom that it may be possible to wangle a way round. Yet there may be a way
  round if you do not lose yourself getting there. You have been warned that I
  shall not be with you in any such uncertain enterprise. I work not simply for
  knowledge but for a stark clarity of thought about it. It seems to me a fair
  challenge to demand a lucid statement of the vision of the universe to which
  this directness of inquiry and assemblage have brought me.</p>

  <p>That vision may affect many readers as unflattering to human self-esteem.
  I cannot help that; it is the way in which reality has unfolded itself before
  me.</p>

  <p>By way of Introduction I will tell how I came to see the world as I do.
  Then in the subsequent sections I will give the conclusions at which I have
  arrived today. I will tell what I first saw of life. How I saw it. How I was
  allowed to see it. How my range of vision extended. How knowledge, experience
  and imagination accumulated and horizon opened beyond horizon.</p>

  <p>I was born in a rather unprosperous home; there was no nursery and most of
  my waking day was spent in an underground kitchen. Very little remains in my
  memory now of that first world, my infantile world. As I saw it then, it
  seemed to be the only world. When I put together the notes for this
  Introduction, I sat for a time, doing my utmost to recall what picture of the
  world I had in early childhood. I get scarcely anything at all.</p>

  <p>It must have been a very limited picture. I had few general ideas. Or
  none. For instance, my mind was not living in a that world or a round world
  or anything of that sort, I was not bothering about any shape or size of the
  world. I was entirely incurious about all that. I was just living in
  "<i>the</i> world." I was informed that there was a home for little children
  above the bright blue sky, but I do not remember that that interested me in
  the slightest degree. I was rather more concerned about Old Bogey who would
  come and fetch me if I told fibs and so on, and I rather disliked (but I did
  not think very much about) a certain divine eye that was always watching
  me&mdash;generally with disapproval But as far as my recollections go, I was
  much more afraid of bears, tigers, black men, red Indians and other dangers,
  lurking in the shadows upstairs and round the corner. That infantile world
  was a world of vivid, immediate, inconsecutive realities against a background
  of nothingness that evoked no curiosity. There was the house next door, there
  was the moon, there was night, there was day and so forth. Why not? With the
  utmost effort, that is all I can reconstruct of the world I saw before I
  began to read books and see pictures, go for walks, go to school, and inspect
  and inquire with the freedom of seven or eight years old.</p>

  <p>I have a fuller conception of what I was seeing after that stage. My
  imagination was being used to amplify and extend what I saw and heard and
  felt directly. A rather foggy time-background was taking shape. I heard about
  "Once upon a time" before I existed. I had a jumbled idea of old England,
  mostly forests with turrets peeping out of them, old Paris, Rome, where it
  was always --Nero and Christians fighting beasts in the Coliseum. My
  historical ideas centered upon Windsor Castle. I had seen Windsor Castle, and
  I firmly believed that that grandiose round tower, which George the Fourth
  clapped upon it, was built by William the Conqueror. Rome, Greece, Babylon,
  Jerusalem and Egypt, arranged anyhow, crowded the background, and the
  Creation, seen across the shining waters of the Flood and a curious
  procession of very, very, very old gentlemen&mdash; Methuselah beat the
  record&mdash;sealed up the vista of the past.</p>

  <p>I was interested in geography chiefly because it provided varied scenery
  for imaginary adventures. I thought China and Japan were made to be laughed
  at, though their porcelain and silks and fans were clever. I knew that there
  were also savages for whom Britain provided missionaries and machine-guns.
  Savages were generally cannibals and wore few or no garments, which seemed to
  me very rude of them indeed. I knew the world was round because everybody
  told me so. If they had told me the world was cone-shaped or flat, I should
  have known that with equal conviction&mdash;and it was only years afterwards
  that I realized how difficult it is to prove that the world is a globe. There
  were upper classes one respected and lower classes that one didn't, and poor
  people had to work, and that was how things were. The nearer I could edge up
  to the upper classes the better it would be for me.</p>

  <p>So I saw the world about the year 1880, when I was rising fourteen years
  old, and I think most of my readers will agree with me that I was seeing the
  world then in a very distorted and foggy fashion. And yet&mdash;I was seeing
  it as most people in Great Britain were seeing it at that time. I was seeing
  it as vast multitudes of people arc seeing it today. I was seeing it as it
  was shown to me. For a score of...</p>

  <p class="cp">[PAGE MISSING]</p>

  <p>I forget when it was I began to realize that the world as it had been
  presented to me was not a trustworthy picture of reality, that in effect I
  was being lied to about life. I began doubting quite early in life. The
  religion they put before me was queer, muddled stuff, metaphors about
  unfatherly fathers and sacrificial sons, blood offerings and blood-dripping
  sacrificial lambs (in suburban London!), an irrational fall and a vindictive
  judgment, stuff that took refuge from any intelligent questions behind a
  screen of awe, mystery and menace, so that my reason did not so much reject
  it as fail altogether to accept it. What they called morality seemed planned
  to thrust me into some nasty secret corners and leave me there. I had some
  bad times, fearing a God whom I felt but did not dare to think a spy, a
  bully, a tyrant and fundamentally insane, and it was only after terrific
  distresses and terrors that I achieved disbelief. Fear lingered in my mind
  long after definite faith had dissolved.</p>

  <p>The sublunary world they imposed upon me was equally difficult to accept.
  The history they taught me wound up at 1700, which was queer when one came to
  think about it. But even then I must have read books about the French
  Revolution and George Washington and the Roman Republic, and they had upset
  my simple faith in the inevitability of our political order, the dear Queen
  and all the rest of it. A sixpenny book by the late Henry George came into my
  hands and set me thinking crudely, destructively, but profitably about rent,
  wages and suchlike matters. Some rumors about a science called geology
  reached me. I had already observed for myself in the pictures in Wood's
  Natural History that different species of animals had quite needless
  resemblances to one another, if it was indeed true that they had all been
  made separately. Then about that time my schoolmaster set me reading science
  textbooks to earn Education Department grants for him, and suddenly I woke up
  to the existence of a vast and growing world of thought and knowledge outside
  my ordinary circle of ideas altogether. My heavens opened, and the world as I
  had seen it hitherto became a flimsy veil upon the face of reality.</p>

  <p>I have heard other people who have had similar experiences to mine tell of
  the <i>thirst for knowledge</i> they experienced. I suppose I had that thirst
  in good measure, but far stronger was my anger at the paltry sham of an
  education that had been fobbed off upon me; angry resentment also at the
  dismal negligence of the social and religious organizations responsible for
  me, that had allowed me to be thrust into the hopeless drudgery of a shop,
  ignorant, misinformed, undernourished and physically under-developed, without
  warning and without guidance, at the age of thirteen. To sink or swim. I was
  too young to make allowances for the people who were exploiting and stifling
  me. I did not realize that they were quite charming people really, if a
  little too self-satisfied and indolent. I thought they had conspired to keep
  me down. It wasn't true that they had conspired to keep me down. But I was
  down and they didn't bother. They took my inferiority as part of the accepted
  order. They just trod on me. But I did not discriminate about their
  responsibility. I <i>hated</i> them as only the young can hate, and it gave
  me the energy to struggle, and I set about struggling, for knowledge. I was
  bitterly determined to see my world clearer and truer, before it was too
  late.</p>

  <p>To this day I will confess I dislike the restriction and distortion of
  knowledge as I dislike nothing else on earth. In this modern world it is, I
  hold, second only to murder to starve and cripple the mind of a child.
  Emasculation of the mind is surely more horrible than any degrading bodily
  mutilation. In our modern world we recoil from the deliberate manufacture of
  human dwarfs, harem attendants and choristers, but the world still swarms
  with mental cripples, who follow the laws of their own distortion and
  scarcely suspect they are distorted.</p>

  <p>I have indicated the limits of my world outlook in 1880. By extraordinary
  good luck I caught up to something like contemporary knowledge in the course
  of a few years. In seven years, before I was twenty-one, I
  contrived&mdash;never mind how&mdash;to secure four years of almost
  continuous study, and three of these were at the Royal College of Science,
  and one under the professorship of the great Huxley, Darwin's friend; and by
  1887 the world as I saw it had become something altogether greater, deeper
  and finer than the confused picture I had of it in 1880. Mentally, we all
  travel at our fastest, I suppose, between fourteen and twenty-one. Many of my
  readers will know from their own experience what I mean when I say that for
  me these years remain in my memory as if all the time I was putting together
  an immense jig-saw puzzle in a mood of inspiration. These were the most
  exciting years in my life. I had been blind and I was learning to see. The
  world opened out before me. By '88 I saw the world, not precisely as I see it
  today, but much more as I see it today than as I saw it in 1880. There has
  been a lot of expansion and supplementing since, but nothing like a
  fundamental reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Now how did we&mdash;because I was one of a generation of science
  students&mdash;how did we see the world in '88? Time had opened out for us,
  and the Creation, the Fall of Man and the Flood, those simple fundamentals of
  the Judaeo-Christian mythology, had vanished. Forever. Instead I saw a
  limitless universe throughout which the stars and nebulae were scattering
  like dust, and I saw life ascending, as it seemed, from nothingness towards
  the stars.</p>

  <p>In the eighties the prevailing ideas about space and time, matter and
  energy, were simpler than they are now. Space and time just went on forever,
  we thought. We students used to talk about the fourth and other dimensions,
  but when I wrote a story for the students' magazine and identified time with
  the fourth dimension, I thought I was being very original and paradoxical
  indeed. We also had very definitely limited ideas about the amount of energy
  latent in the universe, and it seemed to us that our world would probably
  "freeze up" in a few million years. Still even that gave us a long time
  ahead, and we thought humanity might see and do tremendous things. We knew
  the broad outline of the history of life in time; we knew that our ancestors
  were apes, and it seemed possible that man would go on to a power and wisdom
  beyond all precedent.</p>

  <p>But our ideas of that progress we anticipated were remarkably restricted.
  Our imaginations were relatively unstimulated. For example, our world, as we
  saw it then, knew nothing of radio&mdash;or to be exact it knew of radio
  transmission as a curious laboratory experiment, the Hertzian waves&mdash;and
  its ideas about atoms and the statement of physical processes, were naive in
  the extreme. We doubted if aviation was possible, we doubted if electric
  fraction was possible, we associated submarines with the fantasies of Jules
  Verne, and we considered his <i>Around The World In Eighty Days</i> an
  extravagant dream. Our interpretation of mental actions was trivial and
  shallow almost beyond comparison with what we have now.</p>

  <p>As I compare the world as I see it now, with that world I contemplated
  fifty years ago, I realize how greatly the picture has unfolded and how much
  understanding has intensified. So far as its scale and texture go, so far as
  space and time, the atoms and the threads and substance of the picture go,
  the world as I see it today is altogether more marvelous, mysterious and
  profound.</p>

  <p>It is not only that our analysis of the rhythms and interplay of the
  physical elements of the universe has been elaborated and rephrased in far
  more effective modes. In the foreground and middle distance also, concerning
  affairs upon this planet and the more obvious and immediate activities of
  life, our enlightenment has been immense. Thanks largely to Freud and his
  disciples and successors, there has been an immense advance in our
  self-knowledge. I would put Freud side by side with Darwin as a significant
  figure in human enlightenment. These two men are cardinal not so much on
  account of the actual elucidations they produced but 'because of the
  questions they asked and the method of their questioning. Our knowledge first
  of our own motives and impulses and then of mass-thought and mass-action, has
  become beyond comparison more lucid and practical, thanks primarily to the
  initiatives of Freud.</p>

  <p>One immediate result of this rapid progressive enlargement and
  confirmation of our former outlook has been a tremendous wave of optimistic
  assurance in the minds of liberal-minded, freely thinking people. They have
  taken progress in discovery, in intelligent social organization, in the
  conquest of want, disease, ignorance, as something almost as inevitable as
  the precession of the Equinoxes. That progress has had the air of something
  quite independent of the daily lives and mass responses of everyday people.
  There was nothing anyone need do about it. It came; it unfolded; it
  increased. Progress! The men of science, the inventors, clever people
  somewhere were doing it all for us and all we had to do was to sit back and
  marvel and accept the cornucopia. There are the facts before us, the
  novelties, the triumphs, perpetually reinforced. In the world as I see it
  today, the powers and possibilities of human effort appear enormously greater
  than they did in 1888. And still they increase. Still the prospect and the
  promise expand.</p>

  <p>The case for optimism about physical wants is stronger now than ever. So
  far as economic circumstances go, the world could be organized to provide
  every living soul upon it with abundant food, housing and leisure, and that
  without either direct compulsion to toil or any irksome monotony of
  employment. We have passed in a single lifetime from a general neediness to a
  practicable plenty for all The story is too familiar to need exhaustive
  recapitulation here. Aviation and radio communication have abolished
  distance. In 1888 the unity of the world as one community was a remote
  aspiration; now it has become an imperative necessity. Fifty years ago none
  of us dreamt of the freedom and fullness of life that is now a plain
  possibility for everyone. To many hopeful people in die past few decades, an
  age of power, freedom and abundance has seemed close at hand. Eye has not
  seen nor ear heard, it is only now entering into the human imagination to
  conceive, the wonder of the years to come.</p>

  <p>And now suddenly we are confronted by a series of distresses and
  disasters, of a nature to convince the most hopeful of us that all this happy
  assurance was premature. We anticipated too easily, too greedily and too
  uncritically. These new powers, inventions, contrivances and methods, are not
  the unqualified enrichment of normal life that we had expected. They are
  hurting, injuring and frustrating us increasingly--They are proving dangerous
  and devastating in our eager but unprepared hands. We are only beginning to
  realize that the cornucopia of innovation may perhaps prove far more
  dangerous than benevolent.</p>

  <p>What we may call the scientific world has recognized this quite recently.
  There have been great stirrings of conscience in various scientific
  organizations upon the question of the misuse of science and invention, and
  how far the man of science may be held responsible for that misuse. The
  Associations for the Advancement of Science in Britain, America and Australia
  have been moving under the initiatives of such men as Sir Frederick Gowland
  Hopkins, Lord Rutherford and Sir Richard Gregory. The British Association has
  created a special Division, not merely a new section but a sort of collateral
  to itself, for the study of the 1 social relations of science. The fate of
  this Division will be of considerable interest from our point of view. I have
  been privileged to attend some of its deliberations and two divergent lines
  of tendency have been very evident. One is plainly to organize and implement
  the common creative impulse in the scientific mind so as to make it a vital
  factor in public opinion; that was the original impulse which evoked the
  Division; the other is to restrain any such development of an authoritative
  and perhaps embarrassing criticism of the conduct of public affairs and to
  keep the man of science modestly to his present subordination.</p>

  <p>It would carry us too far afield to discuss here how far the consciences
  of men of science may be able to get the upper hand of a trained and
  experienced governing class, so as to insist upon such collective ideals as
  they are able to formulate, and how far a trained and experienced governing
  class may maneuver this medley of distressed and protesting intelligences
  into the position of a roster of mere "experts" available if called upon by
  the authorities, and otherwise out of consideration.</p>

  <p>It is conceivable that the scientific worker is even now walking into a
  net; that increasing areas of his inquiries and experiments are falling under
  the restrictions of "official secrets"; and that far beyond the more obvious
  realms of physics and chemistry, fields of investigation that have no direct
  bearing upon warfare are likely to come under control, as favoring subversive
  ideas undermining the military morale of the community. In Nazi Germany this
  has happened already to psychological science, to mathematical physics and
  ethnology&mdash;matters quite outside armament and strategy. An almost
  complete strangulation of the unhampered publication and exchanges of the
  free scientific period is visibly within the range of contemporary
  possibility, and the world of scientific workers, as we know them, even with
  that "Division" to rally them, appears a feeble folk to resist the influences
  making for that extinction.</p>

  <p>No one has ever explored the bases of intellectual freedom in the modern
  community, and they may prove to be far more flimsy than the intellectual
  worker, flinging his mind about in the apparent security of his study,
  imagines.</p>

  <p>It is not simply the forcible misuse of purely mechanical inventions that
  is producing such frightening retrogressions of those brave, free hopes that
  culminated in the later twenties. Every fresh development of radio, of the
  film and mass information generally, and all the new educational devices to
  which we had looked for the rapid spread of enlightenment and a common world
  understanding, are being subordinated more and more to government restriction
  and the service of propaganda. They were to have been the artillery of
  progress. They are rapidly being turned against our mental freedoms with
  increasing effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Plainly, it is high time we looked more closely into the causes of these
  disconcerting frustrations of our recent large, bright anticipations of a
  world of plenty and expansion. What is the real position of <i>Homo
  sapiens</i> in relation to his environment? Has he the mastery we assumed he
  had, or did we make a profound miscalculation of his outlook? Have we been
  indulging in hopeful assumptions rather than facing the realities of his
  case? Upon that question the subsequent summary concentrates.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">&sect; 1. &mdash; PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</a></h2>

  <p>SINCE the day when Herbert Spencer launched the word "Sociology" upon the
  world, the study of the general question of what is happening to mankind has
  made great advances. Sociology&mdash;or, to give it a more recent and better
  name, human ecology&mdash;has become a real science, analyzing operating
  causes and forecasting events. Our awareness of our circumstances is
  altogether more lucid than the world outlook even of our fathers. We have,
  flowing into the problem of human society, a continually more acute analysis
  of its population movements, of its economic processes, of the relation of
  its activities to the actual resources available. We no longer talk with
  quite the same pompous ignorance as the history teachers of our youth, of the
  rise and decay of Empires and of the march of civilization from East to
  West&mdash;or from West to East, it is much the same&mdash;and suchlike
  plausible caricatures of the current of events. With the increase in our
  knowledge and understanding quite new conceptions of the prospects and
  problems of humanity unfold before us.</p>

  <p>The infiltration of biological ideas into sociology and human history, it
  has to be recognized, is a process still only beginning. The enlightenment of
  the middle nineteenth century through the destructive analysis of the
  Creation myth, went on in the face of vast resistances, and not the least of
  these were in the schools. The new conceptions threatened the very bases of
  belief oh which right conduct seemed to rest. Men shrank from following out
  the plain implications of the new discoveries. And so either they were
  denied, irrationally and frantically, or they were minimized, they were
  admitted, yes, but as obscure, remote matters, that had little or no
  significance in the "broader issues" of life. So that they could be taught in
  a sterilized form or ignored altogether. There was a period of controversy,
  very disastrous to the old dogmas, and then a phase of defensive silences.
  Open fighting was abandoned and the established beliefs dug themselves
  in.</p>

  <p>It is still possible for bright youngsters at the universities to enter
  upon the "advanced" study of history, philosophy and economics, in the
  blackest ignorance of general biology. A majority of them remain in that
  ignorance, with a deepening scholastic hostility to this science, which sits
  like a neglected creditor at their doors. They have established a social
  prejudice against this dreaded line of thought and body of knowledge in which
  they have no share. They succeed in putting it upon the all too snobbish and
  sensitive young that somehow the biological reference is not quite the thing.
  It isn't done. It isn't to be thought about. There is an indecency in it. The
  young university philosopher, historian or economist is in many cases not so
  much biologically ignorant as biology-proofed.</p>

  <p>It is because of such mental gaps and barriers that it is necessary to
  recapitulate here certain facts about life, which, although they are matters
  of general knowledge today beyond question and almost beyond cavil, might
  nevertheless, so far as any effective realization of their bearing upon our
  general social, political and religious behavior goes, be totally unknown.
  Yet they bear upon the problems of the present urgently. Contemporary
  political discussion remains indeed mere maundering empiricism, a tissue of
  guesses, ill-founded assertions and gossip, until they are brought into
  court.</p>

  <p>This contrast of established knowledge and its effective application is a
  very remarkable one. Men can know a thing and yet know it quite ineffectively
  if it contradicts the general traditions and habits in which they live. It is
  well to understand that at this stage in our analysis, because it bears very
  directly upon the review of human possibilities to which this summary is
  directed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">&sect; 2. &mdash; BIOLOGY INVADES HISTORY</a></h2>

  <p>ONE of the most striking differences between the outlook of our
  grandparents and that of a modern intelligence today is the modification of
  time values that has occurred.</p>

  <p>By the measure of our knowledge their time-scale was extremely shallow.
  They had scarcely any historical perspective at all. They looked back to a
  past of a few thousand years and at the very beginning of time as they
  conceived it, they saw human life very much as it is now: it was a more or
  less balanced system of certain social types: rulers and ruled, hunter and
  cultivator, priest and soldier. This they regarded as the immemorial life of
  man. They saw the life of city and cultivated land, desert and sea,
  throughout all the interval, spreading perhaps, changing in a few
  particulars, enriched rather than altered by inventions and discoveries, but
  essentially the same. Their range of observation and comparison was too
  limited for them to realize that by clearing forests, overstocking
  grasslands, destroying soil, they were slowly impoverishing and devastating
  many of the regions into which they spread. They did not connect the rise and
  fall of empires with a factor of unforeseeing waste in that normal life of
  theirs. They ascribed such drifting of population and energy as they observed
  to other causes. These processes of primitive waste were too relatively slow
  to be perceptible from lifetime to lifetime. So these thinkers of yesterday
  talked of unchanging human nature. You cannot change human nature, they said.
  They relied upon the fabled promise of the rainbow, they had it straight from
  the Creator's mouth, that while the earth still remained, seedtime and
  harvest should endure.</p>

  <p>The order of events seemed a sure, unfailing routine. And in much the same
  way, our ancestors, until a couple of dozen centuries ago, thought the world
  was flat. They thought the sea they sailed upon flat without qualification,
  and it required a considerable amount of mental exercise for them to realize
  that the apparent plane of the ocean surface was really curved and that the
  faster and farther they sailed the more effectively they would realize how
  the round earth was falling away from their first assumptions. All their old
  landmarks would then vanish one after another. Astounded navigators found
  unfamiliar constellations in the heavens. Within two dozen centuries man has
  been discovering that he lives not on a flat earth but upon a globe, and
  within the last ten, that he is not the center of the universe but a denizen
  of a very second-rate planet. He has had to readjust his general ideas about
  life to that, and to a certain extent he has adjusted them. To a certain
  extent only.</p>

  <p>And similarly our historical imaginations, quite as much as our
  geographical imaginations, live today in a vastly enlarged system of
  perspectives. We know that the everlasting hills are not everlasting, that
  all our working conceptions of behavior and destiny are provisional and that
  human nature and everything about it is being carried along upon an
  irreversible process of change. Our historical ideas reach back now through
  vistas of millions of years, we see humanity emerging from sub-human
  conditions, from the life of relatively solitary apes, at distances in the
  nature of a quarter of a million years, we know with increasing precision of
  the onset of a social hunting life in those distant ages, we are able to
  trace the beginnings of agriculture in a period of two or three hundred
  centuries, and by the new scale, the development of cities, language, law,
  religious organization, and all the various adaptations of humanity to the
  new conditions of a regular food supply, all that social system which seemed
  as eternal as the heavens, appear now events of yesterday, devoid of any
  finality whatsoever. That fixity of the normal human life which our
  great-great-grandfathers assumed as a matter of plain common sense, we
  discover was a transient dream. As our perspectives open, it vanishes.</p>

  <p>The rapid progress of social psychology, human ecology and all the ill-
  defined activities of human and general biology is opening our eyes, it is
  opening even the eyes of our trained historians and our social teachers, to
  the real nature of our everyday social life. It is brought home to us that
  the human species for the last twenty or twenty-five thousand years has been
  living in such a continuously accelerating process of change as no other
  animal species has ever been called upon to face. And it is also being forced
  upon our reluctant attention that the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> is no
  privileged exception to the general conditions that determine the destinies
  of other living species. It prospers or suffers under the same laws. These
  laws can be stated compactly, and there is nowadays very little dispute about
  them, even in matters of detail.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">&sect; 3. &mdash; HOW SPECIES SURVIVE</a></h2>

  <p>WHAT in general terms are the relations of a species to the world about
  it?</p>

  <p>A species may be living in practical harmony with its environment or it
  may be more or less out of balance with its surroundings.</p>

  <p>In the former case it may continue recognizably the same species, living
  the same life, age after age. Any tendency to excessive numbers may be
  corrected by a correlated increase in the types that prey upon it, and there
  will be no definite biological encouragement for such variations and
  mutations as occur. Harmless mutations may indeed produce varieties and
  sub-species, and, as Henry Fairfield Osborn long ago pointed out, there may
  be purely mutational. efflorescences; the correlation of a species to its
  environment is never hard and exact; but only a minority of mutations seem to
  be without some quality of advantage or disadvantage. Abnormal individuals in
  a species in practical equilibrium will generally be eliminated, and the
  species as a whole will pursue the even tenor of its way indefinitely.</p>

  <p>There are species that have been under no necessity to adjust themselves
  to circumstances over vast periods of geological time. But they are
  exceptions to the general ecological spectacle of species balancing
  themselves in a changing world. Most existing species, when their affairs are
  scrutinized as a whole, are discovered to be in a state of imperfect
  adjustment to their circumstances, and to be either undergoing adaptation to
  meet new requirements or to be losing ground in the struggle&mdash;if one may
  call anything so essentially passive a struggle-to survive. Over a large part
  of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, adaptation, the working adjustment of
  the species under stress, is made, if it is made at all, by the selective
  frustration and killing off of less well-adjusted individuals. Variations and
  mutations&mdash;it is not necessary to enter here into the controversial
  question of their causes; suffice it that they occur&mdash;variations and
  mutations, indifferent, favorable and unfavorable, play a considerable part
  in this selective adjustment. The adjustment is either sufficient or
  insufficient. In the latter case, the species dwindles and disappears. In the
  former, the species undergoes modification; it survives, changed, as a new
  species or as several new species according to the imperatives of its altered
  conditions.</p>

  <p>All this again is practically common knowledge today. Most educated people
  know about it even if they do not think very much about it, or link it up
  with other systems of ideas in their minds. It needs to be repeated plainly
  here in view of that possibility of disregard.</p>

  <p>The general history of life in the past is, as everybody knows, one of
  failure and defeat rather than adaptation. Great groups of living things have
  arisen, had their heyday, and then passed altogether from the scene, giving
  place to more plastic and adaptable forms of life. Comparatively
  insignificant forms with novel accommodations arise to take their place.</p>

  <p>When we contemplate that greater past that science has unfolded for us, we
  see great groups and orders of mighty creatures dominating the earth,
  enormous reptiles, huge mammals flourishing and then waning and passing away.
  They have not kept pace with change; their exuberance has been almost a
  defiance of change; and change has overcome and obliterated them. The
  geological record can be presented, certain assumptions being granted, as on
  the whole a great progression, but that does not alter the fact that it is
  also a history of the ruthless extinction of whole species, genera and orders
  of living things. There are tremendous massacres in the geological
  record.</p>

  <p>One of the greatest of these occurred at the close of the Mesozoic period,
  when in the course of perhaps only a few hundred thousand years, a vast
  reptilian fauna, ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, tyrannosaurus and so forth, an
  equally wonderful flora, scores of genera of ammonites and so on and so
  forth, were thrust out of existence. We know little or nothing of the changes
  that made so many hitherto successful forms of life impossible. We know
  surely only that they occurred. A change from conditions of
  all-the-year-round equable temperature to wide seasonal alternations of heat
  and cold may have resulted from some planetary disturbance. More recently
  there have been parallel massacres of groups of the early mammals, and there
  can be no question that today we are, from the geological point of view,
  living in a phase of exceptional climatic instability,-in a series of glacial
  and interglacial ages, and witnessing another destruction of animal and plant
  species on an almost unparalleled scale. The list of species extinguished in
  the past hundred years is a long one; the list of species threatened with
  extinction today is still longer. No new species arise to replace those
  exterminated. It is a swift, distressful impoverishment of life that is now
  going on. And this time the biologist notes a swifter and stranger agent of
  change than any phase of the fossil past can show&mdash;man, who will leave
  nothing undisturbed from the ocean bottom to the stratosphere, and who bids f
  air to extinguish himself in the process.</p>

  <p>This species man is, as we all know, one of a great series of species
  which we can speak of roughly as cerebral animals. These are the mammals who
  have dominated the earth since the beginning of the Tertiary period and which
  display throughout a rapid development of the cerebral cortex. This cerebral
  cortex was a novelty in the history of life, and it brought with it a fresh,
  distinctive method of individual adaptation to special circumstances. It
  quickened the response of a species to changing conditions very greatly.
  Learning from experience appears indeed but very rudimentarily in
  cold-blooded vertebrata; it is only in the birds and mammals, and
  particularly in the latter, that it becomes of real importance in adaptation.
  Essentially the cerebrum is an organ for the storage and application of
  memories. It enables individuals to learn by experience. The history of the
  mammals in particular is a history of memory development. All through the
  Tertiary period, it is to be noted, brains in every group of mammals increase
  in relative size and complexity. With every increase, the power of learning
  from experience and of supplementing direct impulse by conditioned reflexes
  increases. A young fish or reptile comes into the world with a practically
  complete, almost unalterable set of instinctive responses. It survives or
  fails by its inherited outfit. Apparently it can learn to a certain extent,
  but it learns very little. A young mammal comes into life far less
  conclusively equipped, a <i>tabula rasa</i>, prepared to learn. It learns.
  And the ampler its cerebral equipment, the more it learns to take care of
  itself. To begin with, it is sillier and less certain than the cold-blooded
  type; it stands in need of protection; in the end it is far better adapted to
  meet the special conditions it faces.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the young mammal and, to a rather different extent and in a
  rather different fashion, the young bird do not simply learn from individual
  experience. Generally speaking there is also a protective relationship
  between the parent and the new individual. By example and often by direct
  intervention the young individual is taught. It heeds and imitates.</p>

  <p>As we ascend the scale of cerebral development the possibility of teaching
  increases. It becomes possible to domesticate and train these higher-brain
  animals in just the measure that their brains are developed. You can teach
  very little to a fish or a reptile, but directly you come to the higher
  cerebral mammals you are confronted by the new possibility of establishing an
  artificial, taught, motive system to control, supplement or altogether
  replace natural instinct. You must catch them young. Then you can socialize
  them and get to quite remarkable working understandings with them. The
  shepherd's dog, the blind man's dog, the polo pony, the polite, house-trained
  cat, are examples of the immense individual adaptability which is achieved
  through the establishment of a taught, secondary self in the cerebral cortex.
  None of these creatures are behaving in accordance with the primary
  tendencies they have inherited. They are behaving in accordance with an
  adaptive mental superstructure imposed upon their natural dispositions. It
  enables them to survive not simply as tolerated but as contributing
  individuals in a complex social organization which otherwise would have had
  no alternative but their extermination. They would have suffered the fate
  that is overtaking the unteachable Tasmanian Devil or the unteachable
  Tasmanian Wolf.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">&sect; 4. &mdash; HISTORY BECOMES ECOLOGY</a></h2>

  <p>AT this point again it may be well to take stock of the discussion we are
  unfolding. We have been restating, very plainly and directly, established
  facts in general ecology, and we are going on now to develop this restatement
  in relation to the particular position and outlook of the human species.
  There is no need to apologize for this biological resume, elementary though
  it is. It is vitally necessary to our statement. It is absolutely impossible
  to approach the urgent and distressful problems of the present time with any
  hope of lucid solution until this general background of knowledge is
  definitely present in the mind.</p>

  <p>From now on we shall encounter an increasing amount and variety of
  resistance to our application of these almost universally admitted facts.
  From this' point on, many readers will be quite unaccustomed to seeing human
  social life in the light of ecological science. There is a sort of barrier in
  their minds. It is not because they do not know, but because they see the two
  sets of facts apart. They will experience a strong resistance to this
  invasion of this reserved region of human affairs by these really quite
  incontrovertible ideas, because in this reserved region their minds are
  already strongly occupied by idea systems that are incompatible with
  it....</p>

  <p>It has been pointed out how the species of brain-animals cooperate with
  circumstances in teaching their offspring to adapt themselves to the
  exactions of their environment. But in th&pound;&raquo; case of man, and to a
  quite exceptional extent, because of an immense development of speech and
  gesture, the taught stuff in the cerebrum becomes of overpoweringly greater
  importance than mere hard experience, and we find the behavior system of the
  individual' molded to social co-operation and collective needs, not only by
  tradition and other forms of education but by institutions and law. Man,
  above everything else, is an educated animal, socially controlled. He is no
  longer primarily or even mainly a creature of instinct and brief individual
  experience. That phase in evolution lies a million years behind him. His
  instincts alone and without correction would fail him utterly as a behavior
  control in his present circumstances.</p>

  <p>There is a relatively enormous artificial supplement to the natural man in
  all of us. We talk of our "selves" and of being freemen, but much the greater
  part of our activities today we perform as parts not of one simple, greater
  organism, human society, but, what is more complex, as parts of a number of
  greater organisms&mdash;profession, township, nation, religion, club, class,
  and so forth, which are all woven together into what we call human society
  and our social reactions. What we do as purely spontaneous individuals is
  -hardly more than a narrow choice between prescribed things. The home we live
  in, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the way we go about the world, are
  all substantially imposed upon us by forces exterior to our
  personalities.</p>

  <p>They are social products and more and more do they become social
  products.</p>

  <p>The socialization of human life, the relative increase of the factor
  supplied by society, is still going on quite rapidly. There was a time, for
  instance, not so many generations ago, when most people built their own
  homes, made their own clothes, got their own food, taught their own children.
  Now the building trade, clothing trade, the provision shop, and the public
  school see to all that.</p>

  <p>This applies with even greater truth to our minds. A mere fraction of our
  knowledge is self-taught. What we know again is nine-tenths hearsay. We have
  heard, we have read. The stuff in our heads was mainly put there by society.
  To the biologist an ordinary ape is just a natural ape, but a man is a
  natural man plus a great cerebral accumulation of directive ideas,
  prejudices, antagonisms, tolerances and conceptions of what he ought and
  ought not to do, which wrap about him and fit him into the social body to
  which he belongs. From the biological point of view all this cerebro-social
  accumulation of knowledge, beliefs and ideas, responsibilities and
  dependency, is as much a natural adjustment to needs and environment as a
  claw or a skull or a swimming bladder; it is a thing of the same kind, though
  it differs enormously in the relative swiftness and breadth of its
  adaptability to changing conditions. It is subject to the same ecological
  laws.</p>

  <p>The growth of this mental superstructure upon the primitive ape-man of the
  later Tertiary period can now be traced in its broad lines without very much
  difficulty. Any attempt to make a general outline of human history falls
  almost uncontrollably into the form of a story of developing communication,
  learning and co-operation between the primordial ape-man family groups. The
  outline of history as one whole is, and must be, a history of communication
  and socialization. It is compelled to apprehend primary processes that the
  older type of history, with its preoccupation with separate communities, was
  equally compelled to ignore. It begins necessarily with the origins of
  speech, gesture, drawing, observances, and taboos.</p>

  <p>With every such development, the association of human animals in groups
  collectively more efficient in the appropriation of food supplies became
  easier. The family group grew into the tribe and tribes grew larger. Their
  growing awareness of the seasons is apparent in the archaeological record;
  their growing ability to co-operate in the semi-domestication of animals and
  the first agricultural tentatives is now quite clearly traceable. These are
  no longer matters to dispute about. With the development of agriculture and
  the beginnings of settlement, man, the new sort of socialized man, appears as
  a rapid and immense biological success. His growing communities spread
  swiftly, growing as well as multiplying and spreading, and displaying every
  symptom of an unprecedented surplus of biological energy.</p>

  <p>A few millenia ago the life which our great-grandfathers considered to be
  the normal and immemorial life of mankind was well under way. It had grown
  up, biologically speaking, speaking by the standards of geological time, with
  the rapidity of a puff-ball, and those who lived it were unaware that there
  had ever been any other way of human living. Such was life. And it was still,
  although they did not perceive it in the least, under a stress of
  accelerating change.</p>

  <p>The changes in the conditions of human life during the last twenty or
  thirty thousand years have been mainly brought about by the acceleration of
  invention through increasing co-operation and the release of material and
  social power. There have been no doubt climatic and geographical changes, but
  their share has been relatively less important. The essential story of
  history and pre-history is the story of the adaptation of the social-
  educated superstructure of the animal man to the novel problems with which
  his own enterprise and inventiveness have been continually confronting him.
  Law, religion, education, are from the ecological point of view, names we
  give to the cardinal aspects of this process of adaptation. Each generation
  in these growing and spreading societies was told a story of its relation to
  the community into which it had to fit itself and given an account of the
  acquiescences and co-operations expected from it. The imperatives of law,
  education, religion, all flowing into one another and sustaining one another,
  were expressed, and in these early stages of mental development could only be
  expressed, by anthropomorphic myths. Natural selection has no care for
  scientific precision. There is no immediate survival value in truth. To this
  day the survival value of the critical habit of mind is questionable. It
  sufficed for the purposes of nature if the myths and the system of
  observance, the things that were too awful to do and the things that it was
  fatal to leave undone, made for the survival of the community as a whole. The
  adaptive superstructures, the laws, rules and beliefs, that were favoring
  human survival, varied in different regions, but they varied within the
  limits set by the conditions of specific survival. A certain primary
  resemblance of the tribal gods and of the tribal stories and of the behavior
  systems of the differentiating social classes, waited upon the spread of the
  "normal" way of life about the earth. Parallel circumstances evoked parallel
  adjustments. Generally the pattern included a tribal ancestor god, a
  priesthood taking care of the calendar and medicine, a morality of
  propitiation and self-restraint.</p>

  <p>Step by step, as human inter-communication increased, communities grew
  larger. And as they grew larger they developed something, of which curiously
  enough we are only beginning to grasp the profound importance today; they
  developed a superfluity of young men.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of the biologist <i>Homo sapiens</i> was making an
  almost excessive success. He was repeating the exuberance of the great
  Mesozoic reptiles or the early Tertiary deinotheria. The species was not only
  holding its own, it was spreading and multiplying by leaps and bounds. And
  the front of its biological advance was this surplus of young men. Young men,
  full of beans as people say, and looking for trouble.</p>

  <p>Hitherto historians have failed to recognize the great importance of this
  trouble-making stratum. It is well to underline it here. It is a primary
  social fact. I have been reading recently the works of Mark Benney, <i>Low
  Company</i> and <i>The Truth About English Prisons</i> (<i>Fact</i>, March
  1938), who is rapidly becoming a leading authority on criminology, and he
  reminds me very strikingly of how nonsensical it is to talk of a criminal
  class as a different sort of human being. It is in its origins more and more
  of an age class. Every sort of energetic male human being is a potential
  criminal, if nothing else is found to occupy and interest him. These
  expanding human societies in the past were needing less and less energy per
  head to be sure of their food supply and security. Something had to be done
  to and for these young men, and the easiest way of keeping them out of
  mischief, keeping them disciplined in fact and the numbers of them down, was
  war.</p>

  <p>Primitive war was a necessity forced upon the human community by
  biological success through the production of a surplus of young males. It
  appeared with herding and agriculture and it was naturally associated with
  them. In Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, one can still see
  humanity in a sort of equilibrium at that stage of development. There you
  have a population of over half a million, still living in small independent
  communities, each with its own conceit of itself, its peculiar petty customs
  and prejudices. These New Guinea peoples are by no means a monotony of
  barbarism. They present indeed a great variety of physical and mental types,
  and their social and artistic possibilities are very considerable. Up to the
  present they have solved their population pressure by spells of not too
  destructive warfare. There is a little killing-off and then things settle
  down again. Now, under the parental care of the Canberra government, their
  warfare is to cease, and what will happen to these peoples is very uncertain.
  They may be subjected to economic exploitation far more tragic than
  warfare.</p>

  <p>You can write human history in a variety of ways, but one way of writing
  it would be to consider how, age after age, humanity has met the problem of
  What to do with out sons. There was war and what was generally associate i
  with war, conquest and colonization. Roman Britain, for instance, was
  conquered by the surplus offspring of the Saxon shore. In my native county,
  Kent, traces survived until a very recent period of the custom of gavelkind.
  The elder sons were sent off marauding and the youngest kept the home. You
  can re-write the history of all the great population movements in terms of
  the pressure of the young male surplus.</p>

  <p>It should be particularly evident as an operating cause in the history of
  the last two centuries, and it would be if history were properly told. Every
  community can be shown to be either sending out the plethora of its
  population as emigrants and settlers, or reducing it by warfare, or else
  suffering from acute social trouble, such social trouble as the words Russian
  Hooligans, Chinese Boxers, Moonlighters, Nazis, Fascists, revolutionary
  terrorists, gangsters, will call to mind. The young man surplus, if it is not
  consumed, is the main source of rebels, revolutionaries and disturbances of
  all kinds. Somehow that tension must find relief. The comparative social
  stability of the nineteenth century was largely due to emigration and the
  settlement of new lands. Now there are no more new lands open to
  immigration.</p>

  <p>Moreover this tension has been greatly intensified by the huge increase of
  productive efficiency through invention and the use of mechanical power,
  which has diminished the number of young men who could look forward to a
  fairly secure, properly rewarded, sufficiently interesting married life.</p>

  <p>Invention and discovery in production have intensified this age-long human
  problem and contributed to the present exceptional drift towards warfare and
  social convulsions. People stand in the young man's way and he is ready to
  get rid of them in any fashion suggested to him. That drift towards a social
  killing-off, and the necessity of justifying it, explain the eagerness with
  which race difference, class difference, any sort of difference of
  complexion, language or usage, nationalism and imperialism, are exalted into
  combatant provocations today. You can waste a lot of time arguing about this
  or that <i>ism</i>. The essential fact is the accumulating tension of
  unsatisfied youth, and these <i>isms</i> are mere formulae of relief.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note4a">Note 4A.</a> A falling birth-rate
  does not affect this.</p>

  <p>Warfare and social conflict have for long ages released the plethoric
  human species towards the relief of a bloodletting. So it has been through
  all the ages of recorded history. With the relatively puny means of
  destruction available before the age of invention and innovation, it was no
  more than an excretion of inconvenient energy. For some hundreds of centuries
  humanity got along in this way. War became part of the accepted human rhythm,
  just as the massacre of the drones is part of the natural rhythm of the honey
  bee. Laws, customs, morals, sentiments and thoughts were adapted to it so as
  to make it natural and easy. If it were not for the outbreak of invention and
  discovery during the past century, man might have gone on drumming and
  trumpeting his way through long ages yet to come, going to his priest to
  bless his flags, facing the day of battle bravely, and either dying on the
  field of honor, or surviving to raise another generation for the same
  experience.</p>

  <p>But that inventive urge in the species has suddenly, in&mdash;what is by
  the geological and biological scales&mdash;a mere flash of time, altered all
  that. It has made war something entirely different and it has put quite a new
  face on the political ideas, the working conceptions of right and wrong, of
  duty and service that have hitherto kept the varied and fluctuating patchwork
  of human communities going. It has strained and distorted the problem of
  adaptive survival almost beyond recognition. That, concisely, is the clue to
  the human situation today.</p>

  <p>Let me try to give the gist of this vast change. It is a change in human
  power and scope.</p>

  <p>First as to the increase in socially available power. Before the change,
  except for a little wind power or water power, the only power available for
  human purposes was a little animal power, horse, ox, elephant, camel, llama,
  or what not, and man power. The gross total of power units that sufficed to
  run everything that was going on in Great Britain in a day in the reign of
  Queen Elizabeth, everything, was probably much less than the total of units
  that is consumed today in running the lighting and transport alone of such a
  city as Manchester or Kansas City. And again all the energy of marching,
  shooting, stabbing, hacking, running to and fro at the battle of Agincourt
  was probably less than the energy released by one single high explosive shell
  in a modern bombardment.</p>

  <p>Until this change in the total of available power occurred, the great
  majority of mankind toiled habitually to get food, clothing and shelter. They
  were under an obligation to do so or want. A small minority contrived in
  various ways to live by the toil of others and spend, and except for such
  parasitism there was no way to leisure. Now a steadily dwindling number of
  people, using power machinery and modern contrivances, can produce the
  essentials of life in excess of all our requirements. Never before in the
  history of life has any animal had such a fantastic increase in its ability
  to make or destroy.</p>

  <p>That is the first aspect of the contemporary change. A second is what is
  called the abolition of distance. Even more fantastic in relation to past
  tradition is the increase of speed from point to point. The maximum of speed
  at which an Elizabethan man could travel was limited by a horse. He could
  send an uncertain and difficult message a hundred miles a day. He had beacon
  fires of course, but they do not carry any explicit messages.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note4b">Note 4B.</a></p>

  <p>He could see for a few miles. Now abruptly this creature can travel in
  comfort three hundred miles an hour, he can see and talk to his fellow-man on
  die other side of the earth, he can murder him at vast, increasing distances,
  he knows what is happening all over the world almost instantaneously. And his
  health improves and his vitality is greater. On the average he lives almost
  twice as long and twenty times as actively and variously as his
  great-great-grandfather. Now that distance has been abolished, he lives with
  increasing restlessness cheek by jowl with all the rest of mankind. So far a
  biologist might count him an unqualified success in the struggle for
  life&mdash;except for one disconcerting thing. He is ceasing to breed. His
  numbers are now passing a maximum and seem fated to decline, at least for
  some decades ahead. Woman for a variety of reasons is betraying an increasing
  disinclination to bear children. Man's conquest of nature may prove a sterile
  conquest.</p>

  <p>His reproduction is falling off and his behavior traditions and controls,
  and more particularly the war tradition, are producing the most devastating
  tragedies among his communities. The effect of the increase of power has been
  to exaggerate the impact of the war drive monstrously. One may compare the
  human species today to a steamship that has long sailed the seas with engines
  roughly adequate to its needs, until some malign influence has suddenly gone
  down into the engine-room and, without any consultation with the ship's
  officers, amplified the power of the engines a thousandfold. Now they are
  flying loose out of control, lashing the ship to pieces, and threatening to
  sink it altogether. The captain upon the bridge gives impotent orders; the
  engineers dodge the pounding shafts and the escaping, searching, scalding
  steam.</p>

  <p>Because of the way in which science and invention have brought us all into
  intimate contact and put high explosives into our hands, war has become a
  process of destruction that spares neither age nor sex, it is no longer a
  selective elimination of the surplus young men, it is a colossal wastage of
  material resources, a rapid disintegration of the social organization, robbed
  of all the glories and gallantries that once adorned it. In the past it was a
  corrective and almost tonic process. Now it has become a rapid wasting
  disease, a galloping consumption of the human species.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">&sect; 5. &mdash; UNION NOW?</a></h2>

  <p>IS it possible for man to recover control, or is this shattering return to
  destructive violence the beginning of the end of the career of <i>Homo
  sapiens</i>? Let us hold firmly to the broad conceptions of ecological
  science that have brought us thus far. The human species is, as a whole,
  dangerously out of harmony with these new conditions. Either its powers of
  adaptation will be sufficient to readjust it to the new demands, and it will
  go on to a new phase of survival, or, like any other living species, it will
  be defeated, shattered and ultimately wiped out. There are no other
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>There is no time for any of the slower and more ancient methods of
  adaptation. The readjustment needed must be a mental readjustment. In that
  alone is there any hope for mankind.</p>

  <p>In view of what has gone before it is plain that that mental readjustment
  must involve three main essentials. In varying measure these essentials are
  already widely recognized.</p>

  <p>First and most obviously the idea and tradition of war must be eliminated.
  For that, quite a large number of people seem to be more or less prepared.
  They desire it, even if they have yet to discover the price that must be paid
  for it. Secondly, and what is not nearly so widely conceded, the vast and
  violent wastage of natural resources in the hunt for private profit that went
  on during the nineteenth century, must be arrested and reversed by the
  establishment of a collective economy for the whole world. And thirdly, in
  view of the stress of those young people, the resultant world organization
  must be of an active, progressive, imaginatively exciting nature. That
  surplus energy of youth, male and female, must be used up. It is the drive
  and essence of life; it is life itself. It must in each generation be
  "getting on." It must be doing things, making or re-making with an effect of
  conquest and general participation. The earlier years were preparation; the
  later, relieved of the high fever and impatience of that full onset of
  vitality, are appreciation, deliberation and the continual broadening-out of
  the human agenda.</p>

  <p>These three propositions, peace, collectivism and incessant new
  enterprise, are interdependent and practically inseparable. One cannot be
  realized without the other two. In stating these propositions we are not in
  any way "laying down the law." The law is in the nature of things. We are
  merely stating as precisely as possible the unconditional terms that our race
  manifestly has to expect.</p>

  <p>To what extent is contemporary thought and education moving towards the
  abolition of war?</p>

  <p>An increasing number of us are realizing that the age of independent
  sovereign states and empires throughout the world, free to make war and
  prepared to make war, each separated from the other by barriers of language,
  religion, historical delusions and those differences in habits of life which
  are called national cultures, is coming to an end, obviously, rapidly; and at
  present not one of us can say with any confidence what sort of world order
  can replace it. A world order we feel there must be, but as to how it is to
  be attained, we are all at sixes and sevens.</p>

  <p>The world of man has to become, has&mdash;in a chaotic disorder of
  conflict&mdash;already become, one community&mdash;one disorderly community.
  In the days of Oliver Goldsmith, what happened in China, happened in China,
  and did not matter a rap to anyone in England, If every time one fired a gun
  in England, he remarked, a man died in China, nobody would mind in the least.
  The shooting would go on. Now what happens in China, happens everywhere in
  the world; that is to say it is known and affects life everywhere. The crude
  fact of the world-wide community is here now. The open questions arise when
  we consider how this inevitable coming together of our communities can and
  will be recognized and established as a world order.</p>

  <p>We have indeed already seen one attempt to reconstitute human affairs so
  as to eliminate this destructive process of modern war, in the League of
  Nations experiment. That, we realize now, was an extremely naive attempt to
  stop the current of history and to preserve forever just those national
  separatisms and strangulating boundaries against which the stars in their
  courses are fighting. Certain minimum changes were to be made to "end war"
  while everything else was to go on just as it had been going on before.
  Sovereign states, organized essentially for defense and aggression, were to
  form a League to end combat. Simply that. The conception of an organized
  World Pax, after it had played its part in the warfare of propaganda, after
  it had been used to build up false expectations of a new start in life for
  the German people, was taken over at Versailles and translated into the
  ideology of Foreign Offices and the diplomatic services. These essential
  organs of the old regime were instructed to supersede themselves and they
  were left to work out the task, and quite naturally they did nothing of the
  sort. The League Covenant completely disregarded that perennial problem of
  the restless young men, and it gave no attention to the absolute necessity of
  reconstructing economic life upon a collective basis throughout the world.
  These are matters about which diplomacy has never concerned itself. They do
  not enter into diplomatic or political education, which is at least the
  better part of a century out of date.</p>

  <p>At the end of less than a score of years the failure of the League of
  Nations experiment is complete, and we will spend no time on enlarging upon
  that fruitless interlude of half-hearted idealism. Suffice it to say that for
  many excellent minds it has blocked the way to a realistic treatment of the
  human problem for two decades. We find now in 1939, a rough reproduction of
  the world situation of 1914-18. We find three aggressive military states
  threatening the whole world, and we find a number of threatened states
  contemplating some sort of loosely organized resistance to that
  aggression.</p>

  <p>How loosely&mdash;with what dangerous looseness&mdash;that organization is
  still contemplated is illustrated by a book that has recently been given
  quite serious attention in Britain and America. This is <i>Union Now</i> by
  Clarence K. Streit He proposes that right now there shall be a "federal"
  union of fifteen now independent states which he describes as democracies.
  They are the United States of America, the British group, Finland, France,
  Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden. It is not a League or
  a war alliance he proposes but a permanent federation on the American model,
  with a common foreign policy, common money, common armed forces, common
  control of interstate and foreign trade and a common citizenship. He sweeps
  aside such questions as the status of India, colonial possessions, the
  various monarchist traditions involved, as secondary questions. Soviet Russia
  he balances on the brim of his project with a query&mdash;on the whole an
  encouraging query. Apparently the federated democracies are to have great
  local economic autonomy within the limits of the federal constitution.</p>

  <p>Before we look into Mr. Streit's proposals more closely, it will be worth
  while to get this loose word "democracy" defined. The special interest of his
  book here lies in the fact that it has been well received by a considerable
  number of considerable people. It is an intimation of how rapidly opinion is
  moving towards the conception of a new world order transcending existing
  boundaries. So far it is a book to be welcomed. But it is also an indication
  of the extreme vagueness still prevalent about the necessary material and
  mental conditions of such a world order. Its pseudo-practical
  short-sightedness is almost as manifest as the boldness of its intention.</p>

  <p>I do not believe that a world order can come into existence without a
  preliminary mental cosmopolis. I may be mistaken in that. Political
  federation, loose and confused at first, may precede and impose the necessary
  mental adaptations. That is too round-about and slow a process for the
  limitations of my imagination. World democracy, I believe, would get lost on
  the way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">&sect; 6. &mdash; WHAT IS DEMOCRACY?</a></h2>

  <p>SINCE at any time now we may find ourselves fighting, enduring and dying
  for "democracy," it seems worth while to ask for some clear definition of
  what democracy means, so that we shall not only fight for it, but be prepared
  to see that in the end we get it. When you question people closely in the
  matter, you will encounter a considerable variety of answers, but you will
  find as you sort them out and arrange them that they do tend to converge and
  point in a common direction. There is a vital intention beneath the endless
  misuses and perversions of the word.</p>

  <p>Towards what do these diverse statements converge? What is the reality,
  implicit and potential, that gives its living, present appeal to the word
  <i>democracy</i>?</p>

  <p>Two words that will come out very frequently in the definitions that are
  given you are "freedom" and "liberty." Frequent, but not quite so frequent,
  are such phrases as the "right" of individuals and communities to
  "self-government." A few people will make a vote the symbol of democracy. But
  all of them can be brought into agreement that democracy means the
  subordination of the state to the ends and welfare of the common individual
  Very prevalent is an attitude of negation. Democracy, it is declared, is an
  <i>anti</i>-movement. It demands the protection of the individual life from
  the state. It is anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi, anti-Communist,
  anti-war&mdash;since there is no liberty in a state of siege&mdash;it is the
  denial of the right of the state organization to interfere in the life of the
  common individual except for the common convenience and with the common
  consent.</p>

  <p>All this is matter of general agreement, but in all these phrases, there
  is an element of idealistic overstatement, and as soon as we attempt to bring
  them into effective contact with the realities of life, we find ourselves
  involved in some of the standing controversies that have exercised humanity
  since human thought and discussion began. We are reminded that there is no
  such thing as absolute freedom or absolute servitude. Limitless freedom,
  anarchy, would be a world of chaotic conduct, ruled only by impulse, a jungle
  life. All freedom in any society is conditional; it is a compromise; it
  implies "rules of the game," that is to say, law. Behind all actual social
  behavior there is the suggestion of a defined give-and-take, a "social
  contract." The social contract may vary between the extremes of a contract of
  blind obedience on the one hand and a contract to undertake no collective
  action whatever without a plebiscite, an entirely impracticable subordination
  of the law to mass impulse, on the other. Between these extremes and with a
  declared bias for conscious, free, individual action whenever it is
  practicable, this <i>democracy</i> falls.</p>

  <p>Now the desire for conscious, free, individual action is innate in the
  normal human being. But it can be inhibited by fear of known or unknown
  consequences, by indolence and following the drift, and by a complex of
  infantile dispositions to imitate and obey. The herd instinct is very strong
  in the immature human animal. It will follow a leader or stampede like a cow,
  and find great relief from perplexity in doing so. The preference of
  democracy for the practical maximum of conscious, free, individual action
  requires a justification beyond the mere faltering desire in our hearts to
  "stand up, look heaven in the face and be a man."</p>

  <p>For the normal man, unrestrained democracy is a very exacting way of
  living indeed. It asks too much of his natural resources. In a thousand
  situations even a wise or able man may find himself unable to decide upon the
  line of action that is fairly the best for himself and also the best for the
  general good, and in ten thousand he will find a fatal delay in his
  decisions. For that reason, a detailed, comprehensive, agreed-upon,
  accessible and understandable system of laws, which are really rules for
  behavior in predigested situations, is a necessary preliminary condition for
  a modern democracy. A taxi-cab tariff or the rule of the road or a minimum
  wage is a convenient elementary instance of the way in which conscious, free,
  individual action is set aside to the general benefit in a modern, democratic
  community. We extend that principle nowadays to rates of interest and
  inordinate profits, to the acquisition of land and many forms of property and
  to an increasing number of ordinary transactions. Our modern democratic
  community would frustrate its own declared aims without a complete, detailed,
  legal framework enforced by a judiciary and a police acting strictly under
  the law. The man who in a breath will say "I am a democrat" and also "I am a
  rebel" is simply a fool.</p>

  <p>The contrast between democracy and the forms of community with which it is
  generally contrasted lies essentially in this reliance upon law. In a
  democracy a man does or should know, or should be easily able to ascertain,
  exactly "where he stands," what he must do, what he may do, what cannot be
  done, and he should be able to say with the utmost confidence, "You be
  damned" to any illegal order or request. The laws that restrain and protect
  him have received his implicit or expressed consent, and he has a reasonable
  right to attempt to alter them if he finds them uncongenial, but until they
  are altered they must be respected by all, small or great, in the community.
  The President or ruling assembly is as much bound by the law as the meanest
  citizen.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the dictatorships and undemocratic social organizations
  generally, subject a large part of the common man's activities to
  uncovenanted restrictions, interference and compulsion. It is plainly
  contrary to the spirit of democracy that a man should sell himself into
  slavery or bind himself indefinitely to unquestioning obedience. The care of
  democracy for freedom extends to the protection of a man from his own
  desperate necessity. No democracy would tolerate Esau's bargain. Most
  existing dictatorships, indeed, claim a sort of legality based upon some
  forced plebiscite, some snatched election. But your inquiries will make it
  plain that the consent of the governed in a democracy can never be a finally
  silenced and irrevocable consent. It must be a continuing consent. It must be
  subject to sustained revision and renewal. From the point of view of
  democracy all absolutisms are illegal, and resistance to their commands is as
  justifiable as resistance to any less general hold-up or act of violence.</p>

  <p>This fundamental legalism of democracy has been and is a deterrent to
  swift collective action, and the history of human government is very largely
  a history of attempts to reconcile the bickering gradualism of legal and
  deliberative government under democratic conditions with the needs of special
  emergencies. Before flood, fire, pestilence, earthquake, war, and especially
  in war, men have had to relinquish their liberty of individual action more or
  less completely to a higher command of some sort with unqualified immediate
  powers. The original "dictators" of the Roman system were essentially legal
  officials, and one of the primary riddles of human society has been the
  resumption of power by the community at the end of a period of crisis. A
  democracy needs to be in a state of perpetual vigilance against the
  specialist. From Caesar to Stalin, democracy has been trapped into one-man
  tyrannies by crises.</p>

  <p>But historical analogies are always misleading, and modern crises become
  more and more elaborate affairs and less and less controllable by single
  individuals. None of these modern dictatorships has yet been tried out in a
  sustained war. It is at least highly doubtful whether the vast communities of
  today, if they are able to develop a class of competent public servants, with
  a co-operative morale and a sense of public criticism, may not attain an
  efficiency and a toughness far beyond that of a system subjected to the
  freaks and inspirations of a single individual. But they must work in the
  light. They must work with the distinctive freedom and the conscious
  individual co-operation of a team of football players, and they must be
  subjected to the continual criticism of an understanding public opinion with
  unlimited freedom of expression and with an ultimate, if deferred, right of
  intervention.</p>

  <p>This conception of the superior flexibility and efficiency of free
  teamwork, as against dictatorially planned work, is very attractive to the
  democratically-minded, but it may easily be exaggerated. For example, Tom
  Wintringham in his <i>English Captain</i> lays great stress on the technical
  superiority of free men, inspired by a common idea, over the conscript
  soldiers of a dictatorship. He was in the fortunate position of leading a
  battalion of English volunteers, exceptionally intelligent and enthusiastic,
  picked men who wanted to fight, who were keen to fight, and unanimous at
  least in their hostility to the Franco pronunciamento. Of such individuals,
  unanimous for the services that engage them, an enlightened democracy should
  no doubt consist. But when one turns to the story Major Jose Martin Blasquez
  tells in <i>I Helped To Build An Army</i>, of the internal struggles and
  indiscipline of the defenders of the Republic, one realizes that practical
  freedom of initiative may achieve the most disastrous confusion.</p>

  <p>There is indeed no guarantee of either immediate or ultimate victory in
  democracy. On that we must insist. There is no inherent magic successfulness
  in democratic freedom. Democratic freedom may be much more vulnerable than
  slavery, less easy both to attain and maintain. It may be that few or none of
  us realize yet the full price that may have to be paid for it.</p>

  <p>None the less it is only through the attainment of a real world democracy
  that there is any hope for the ultimate survival of our species.</p>

  <p>In many of the replies one will receive to the demand for a clear
  definition of democracy, one will get some reference to that magnificent
  outbreak of the common sense of mankind, the first French Revolution, That
  remains still a cardinal event in the history of human liberation. It was not
  the beginning of liberation but it was its most outstanding assertion. The
  democracy of America, the radicalism of Britain in its most vigorous phase,
  derived plainly from that French initiative. And since in those days titles
  and privileges were the most conspicuous infringements of men's liberties,
  democracy from the outset would have none of them; it was equalitarian
  without qualification. It was republican, it denied and repudiated any form
  of class rule whatever&mdash;and whenever it is still in health it remains
  republican and equalitarian.</p>

  <p>But conditions in eighteenth-century France were peculiar in the fact that
  then the conspicuous offense against human liberty was class privilege. For
  many people in those days the possession of private property was a means of
  independence, freedom of ownership seemed a reasonable provision for
  democratic liberty, and only a few realized that, released from class
  tyranny, the free play of proprietorship might create advantages and
  disadvantages as wide and socially wasteful, as subject to "abuses," as the
  class privileges of the older regime. Throughout the first revolutionary
  period the spirit of democracy found itself puzzled, mocked and frustrated by
  economic inequality. Men freed from the tyranny of privileges found
  themselves oppressed by a tyranny of advantages. The common man,
  theoretically free and independent, discovered himself in the grip of an
  expanding economic system that made free competitive employment only another
  form&mdash;and to many it seems a scarcely preferable form&mdash;of serfdom.
  Political equality by itself proved in practice to be no equality at all.</p>

  <p>Accordingly when we pursue our inquiries into the meaning of democracy
  today, we find a definite cleavage from this point onward in the replies to
  the question of "What is democracy?" An increasing number will be forced to
  agree that collective economic controls, "Industrial Democracy," as Beatrice
  Webb first phrased it very happily, in her study of co-operation (1891),
  constitute a necessary completion of the democratic proposition. A dwindling
  minority clings to the private profit system as the logical method of the
  sturdy individualism of the revolution. But the general implication of modern
  democracy is that unrestrained economic advantage can be an even graver
  infringement of human liberty than privilege. Modern democracy is not only
  legalism and equalitarianism; it is socialism. It sets its face against all
  abuse of the advantages of ownership.</p>

  <p>Democracy is socialism, and also, by a natural extension of its
  equalitarianism as the problem of world law becomes urgent, it is
  cosmopolitan. Almost tacitly democracy has accepted and assimilated the
  necessity that law must be world law and equally protective of every
  individual human being.</p>

  <p>So far as cosmopolitanism goes, modern democracy reverts to far older
  revolts of human common sense against racial, national and class
  distinctions. Since the rise of Buddhism there has been hardly any broad
  religious initiative that has not at least paid lip service to this idea
  which, in Christianity for example, is incorporated in the formula of an
  impartial divine fatherhood and an equal brotherhood of man. In <i>The
  Outline Of History</i> the association of cosmopolitanism with theocrasia and
  the appearance of the syncretic universal religions is traced. There was a
  double impulse from below and from above; the desire of the expanding empires
  to fuse local particularisms into a larger order under the God-Emperor was in
  accordance with the craving of normal common sense to escape from the
  irksomeness of obviously artificial estrangements. Dr. T.J. Haarhoff, quoting
  W.W. Tarn's <i>Alexander And The Unity of Mankind</i>, declares that
  Alexander "was the pioneer of one of the supreme revolutions in the world
  outlook, the first man known to us who contemplated the brotherhood of man or
  the unity of mankind." This is an exaggeration of a significant fact.
  Cosmopolitanism, universal brotherhood, has indeed been appearing and
  reappearing in human thought for at least the past four and twenty centuries,
  like sunshine trying to break through a cloudy sky.</p>

  <p>Now the "democracy" that found its expression in the first French
  Revolution, the American Revolution and the liberal movement throughout the
  world, was not only incomplete upon the economic side and had, later and with
  difficulty, to become socialist in order to preserve its liberating
  intention, but also it was very sketchy and indefinite in the matter of
  education.</p>

  <p>This was due to the fact that the ideology of the Great Revolution was
  essentially middle-class in its origins. It sprang from a social stratum
  already educated and so satisfied with the sufficiency of its general
  education and so accustomed to a supply of books and pamphlets, that it did
  not realize that there was anything exceptional in the knowledge and freedom
  of thought it enjoyed. It did not even apprehend its immense and immediate
  obligations to the Encyclopaedists in organizing its ideas. It took their
  contribution for granted. It launched its generous proposition of universal
  equality indeed, but not only did it fail to realize the need to insure
  freedom from economic pressure, but also it neglected to organize the
  education of the community as one whole. The American Revolution, in this
  respect, with, for example, its provision of State universities, seems to
  have been ahead of the French. Nevertheless it took the better part of a
  century for democracy to realize, even to a limited extent, the third vital
  implication of its demand for liberty, equality, and fraternity, which was
  the free and necessary universal education of the democratic community to a
  common level of understanding and co-operation. Communities in which every
  mentally normal citizen can at least read and write, have existed for less
  than a century. Communities in which the common education rises much above
  that level do not yet exist.</p>

  <p>That freedom and equality are incomplete without freely accessible
  knowledge and free and open discussion is a necessary completion of the
  democratic idea, but it is one upon which the inquirer into the meaning of
  democracy will get the least assurance. If he asks leading questions, he will
  get a general admission that universal education and sound, ample information
  upon every matter of collective concern are necessary elements in the
  democratic proposition, but unless he himself introduces the matter he will
  hear very little insistence upon this vital completion of the democratic
  ideal.</p>

  <p>He will indeed encounter a certain amount of impatience if he stresses
  this matter. Ordinary people resent being told that they are undereducated or
  wrongly educated. To the common man and woman today, prepared though their
  minds seem to be now for a socialist cosmopolis of a quite , and news is what
  a press run entirely for profit and political and social ends, and (in the
  British system) a government-controlled radio, choose to tell them. It is the
  education they have grown up to, and so far they have not been awakened to
  its insufficiency. They want to carry out these new conceptions of life at
  that level To raise that level seems to them irksome and uncalled for.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note6a">Note 6A.</a></p>

  <p>It is still possible therefore for the equalitarian impulse to be
  effectively frustrated in practice by deliberate and systematic miseducation
  and misinformation. The common man and woman know now in general terms and
  pretty definitely what they want, but they still do not know how to state and
  demand what they want. Private enterprise is able to defend its
  appropriations quite effectively, because it owns the press almost entirely,
  the news agencies and the distributing trades, and so it can distort values
  and distract the public from crucial issues in the boldest fashion. There is
  no countervailing equipment of the public mind in the common schools. These
  are essentially conservative institutions, adapting the common man to the
  social order in which he finds himself, preparing him for that state of life
  to which he has been called, and giving him no reasonable intimations of the
  great drama of change in which he has to play his part. As we have shown, the
  whole mechanism of modern life demands organized collective control. The
  stars in their courses will not suffer the world scramble of exploitation
  that wasted so much human possibility in the nineteenth century to go on. Our
  species cannot afford it under any conditions. But in face of the essential
  ignorance of the modern "democratic" community, the enterprising owner, the
  profiteer that is to say, can keep his grip upon his advantages far more
  effectively than he can in the face of a dictator with unqualified powers. He
  can resist socialization far more effectively.</p>

  <p>Against the capitalist's obstructive power the willfulness of the dictator
  is able to operate far more vigorously than the will of the under-educated,
  ill-informed and suggestible "democracies." So that in certain ways the
  dictatorships have undoubtedly been able to get ahead of the "democratic"
  states. They have gone further on the way to socialization. While the
  industrial exploiter or the rich man struggles to keep his grip on the
  recalcitrant worker below, the dictator of the totalitarian state takes him
  firmly by the collar. Wealth finds itself handled with an extraordinary
  disrespect. Dictatorships imply collectivism. They are forced to collectivism
  in the face of bargaining wealth and the uneasy claims of their own
  supporters. They are forced towards a comprehensive efficiency. The only
  effective response to totalitarian collectivism on the part of a
  freedom-seeking community is a scientifically planned and directed
  socialism.</p>

  <p>From the economic point of view, the whole difference now between the
  reality of dictatorship and the ideal of democracy, when it is worked out to
  its practical completion, is the difference between socialization in the
  dark, with all the progressive corruption, appropriation and inefficiency
  that spring up in the dark, and socialization in the light of an alert and
  implemented public opinion; between socialization by compulsion or
  socialization by enlightened consent.</p>

  <p>From the point of view of the individual the difference is one between a
  deadening servitude and a continual participating enlargement of responsible
  life. No existing institutions coming to us from the past can represent
  democracy as it is thus conceived; it is a far bolder thrust towards a new
  order than any of these adventurer systems that stand in its path.</p>

  <p>If now we fill in the gaps in the current conception of democracy by
  insisting upon complete educational equalitarianism, if we dot the i's and
  cross the /s that are still undotted and uncrossed, if we transcend any
  accepted contemporary rendering of the idea, then "democracy" does indeed
  become a very magnificent conception of a new life for man.</p>

  <p>If democracy means economic justice and the attainment of that universal
  sufficiency that science assures us is possible today; if democracy means the
  intensest possible fullness of knowledge for everyone who desires to know and
  the greatest possible freedom of criticism and individual self-expression for
  anyone who desires to object; if democracy means a community saturated with
  the conception of a common social objective and with an educated will like
  the will of a team of football players to co-operate willingly and
  understandingly upon that objective; if democracy means a complete and
  unified police control throughout the world, to repress the financial
  scramble and gangster violence which constitute the closing phase of the
  sovereign state and private ownership system; then we have in democracy a
  conception of life for which every intelligent man and woman on earth may
  well be prepared to live, fight or die, as circumstances may require.</p>

  <p>But that rounded-off and completed realization of democracy is still only
  establishing itself against great resistances in the human mind. It is not as
  yet established there. And still less is it established as the guiding faith
  of any political or social organization whatever.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">&sect; 7. &mdash; WHERE IS DEMOCRACY?</a></h2>

  <p>WHERE in all this collection of governments Mr. Streit would have us
  federate, is there one that satisfies this plain bare statement of the
  growing and deepening significance of the democratic idea?</p>

  <p>France depends for its mental expression upon an alliance of reactionary
  papers and for its foreign policy upon an association of diplomatists and
  army chiefs, which has held together throughout its dynastic and political
  fluctuations in one consistent policy for the security and advancement of
  <i>La France</i>. America tempers a wide tolerance of free speech and
  personal criticism with a press-sustained persecution of labor leaders,
  radicals, "reds" and "agitators" generally. Its press, if less centralized
  than the French and so less concerted, is equally commercial. The freedom of
  expression of its university professors is pinched between the possibility of
  dismissal for excessive outspokenness from above and the attacks of the
  press-man from below. The American record of successfully framed-up cases
  against troublesome workers' leaders is a long and discreditable one, and one
  need only glance reproachfully at the distressful history of color prejudice,
  unincorporated townships and the exploitation of penal labor in the more
  backward states. And yet these two are the "democracies" <i>par
  excellence</i>.</p>

  <p>Most of the European states invited to Mr. Streit's federation are not
  even democratic in profession. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland and the
  British Empire are monarchies; the monarch professes to act only on the
  advice of his or her ministers, but as a matter of fact the court is a center
  of social and administrative influence of an entirely undemocratic sort. A
  crown is the symbol of graded privilege. In the place of <i>Heil Hitler</i>
  or the Fascist salute, these royalist peoples, at the sound of their
  particular Royal Anthem, stand stiffly to attention with an air of ineffable
  reverence. It is a quite parallel act of worship, and as complete a
  repudiation of the personal responsibility of democracy.</p>

  <p>The disintegrating British Empire is now, one has to recognize, a system
  of government almost completely out of popular control. Practically it has
  undergone a reactionary revolution in the last decade, and a loose-knit
  combination of court, church, army and wealth, intensely class-conscious,
  intensely self-protective, has resumed control of affairs. It is an oligarchy
  skillful in the assimilation of useful or formidable individuals but without
  the slightest disposition to amalgamate with anything else on earth. Its
  ruling motive is the fear of dispossession. Decisions involving peace or war
  are made without any pretense of consulting any surviving popular will, and
  the whole capitalist press, the cinema, the radio and indeed all possible
  means of influencing opinion, concentrate upon the assertion of the rightness
  and inevitableness of these decisions. Dissent is a muffled and ineffective
  squeaking, and any inconvenient facts are kept from the public by requests
  for suppression that are in effect commands. There is a special Form D sent
  round to the press which it is extremely unwise to defy. Most of the acts of
  Mr. Chamberlain since September 1938 have been as irresponsible as those of
  any Dictator, equally unscrupulous and far more shameful. He has indeed made
  himself a Dictator by tact and betrayal instead of by violent seizure. There
  is in the long run very little to choose between a bully dictatorship and a
  "tact" dictatorship. The latter may be less crushing but more insidious in
  its attack upon human dignity.</p>

  <p>These are the practical realities Mr. Streit has to face. The will for
  federation in any of these governments is more than doubtful&mdash;even if
  presently they have their backs to the wall. They will all fight for their
  separate sovereignty to the last.</p>

  <p>No doubt it is true that, in spite of much human inconsistency, much
  confused thinking and many local abuses, there is still a powerful
  disposition throughout all the Atlantic and Scandinavian communities towards
  liberty, equality and world brotherhood. It breaks out in literature,
  discussion and conduct. It expresses itself plainly in books, spontaneous
  press writing, plays and films. This is most manifest in America and there is
  in consequence a growing disposition of the British authorities to intercept
  and censor the too outspoken American weekly press. An increasing number of
  English readers subscribe to American periodicals to learn what is being
  hushed up in their own country.</p>

  <p>With every acceleration of communications this American influence will
  increase. Moreover, there are plenty of American professors manifestly
  disposed to take the risk of outspokenness and say what they like. If at
  times they veil their meaning a little from the possible hostility of the
  unintelligent in a deliberate obscurity of technicality that sometimes
  borders on jargon, that does not prevent their speculating very boldly about
  economic, social and international processes, muck more boldly and freshly
  than their English equivalents.</p>

  <p>Again the bitter jests of such a French periodical as <i>Le Canard
  Encha&icirc;n&eacute;</i> are saturated with the soundest democratic scorn
  and derision. The desire of a considerable section of enlightened Frenchmen
  to sustain and complete the mighty impetus of the Declaration of the Rights
  of Man is genuine and obstinate. They will not willingly suffer France to
  desist from her traditional task of world enlightenment. For some years, in
  the face of overwhelming financial and political difficulties, there has been
  a gallant attempt to produce a modern encyclopaedia, which might repeat the
  preparatory role of the original Encyclopaedists for the vaster needs of
  today.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note7a">Note 7A</a>, the Italian
  <i>Encyclopedia</i>.</p>

  <p>Neither Americans nor British, with their vastly greater resources, have
  attempted anything so comprehensive and illuminating. It would be possible to
  quote hundreds of instances, names, books, speeches, utterances and acts, to
  show that all round and about the world in a great multitude of still
  all-too-dispersed intelligences, democracy lives and advances.</p>

  <p>But these evidences of a considerable and growing will for a reasonably
  complete democracy do not alter the fact that the directive forces in control
  of this miscellany of states Mr. Streit and his disciples would have us
  federate, are scarcely more democratic in structure and method than those
  running the frankly anti-democratic states.</p>

  <p>Indeed, to call the present world convulsion a war between the "allied
  democracies" of the world and "totalitarian states," is putting all too fine
  a name upon it. The reality will be a war of established governments and
  governing systems claiming to represent "democracy" but quite unwilling and
  unprepared to set themselves to realize the modern democratic idea, against
  expansive desperado governments that have shown themselves -contemptuous of
  democratic pretensions and dangerous to the general peace. It will be another
  war for the alteration or preservation of frontiers.</p>

  <p>It is almost impossible to hope that this complex of warfare towards which
  the world is drifting can assume any other form than a confused alliance
  against these more lawless military powers, whatever formal victories or
  defeats ensue. It is incredible that there will not be a steady deterioration
  in human morale through the stresses of the struggle. If the so-called
  aggressor states are defeated, their unfortunate common people will be
  saddled with the war guilt of the governments that have enslaved and ruined
  them. They will be made to "pay" again. Another insincere attempt to organize
  "collective security" on the lines of the League of Nations, another unstable
  League of victors, will simply accumulate the necessary resentments for
  another collapse into still more violent conflict. Fresh brigand adventurers
  will appear, trading on the shame and despair of the vanquished.</p>

  <p>It is this that makes the approach of this second world-war storm so
  black. Whichever side emerges at any particular phase as victorious, is
  really a secondary issue. The practical loss of freedom, the usurpation of
  controls, seems inevitable.</p>

  <p>The possibility of an emergence of any sort of enhancement of democracy
  from the threatened <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> seems very slight indeed.
  Democracy is still too incomplete, unorganized and unprepared to bring about
  any such happy ending. Catastrophe is still steadily outrunning education. We
  are at present rapidly experiencing a repetition of 1914-1919 on a vastly
  more disastrous scale.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">&sect; 8. &mdash; WHAT MAN HAS TO LEARN</a></h2>

  <p>IF we hold firmly to that same systematic assembling of universally
  acceptable statements which has brought us thus far, it is not overwhelmingly
  difficult to state the nature of the mental adaptation that is needed to
  arrest this present drive towards biological disaster for <i>Homo
  sapiens</i>. If it has become necessary for him to be re-educated as a
  conscious world citizen, to be prepared to take his place in a collective
  world fellowship, then plainly the realization of this necessity is the
  framework upon which his social being must be rebuilt. The scientific vision
  of life in the universe and no other has to be his vision of the universe.
  Any other leads ultimately to disaster. And since the existing educational
  organization of the world does not provide anything like that vision nor
  establish the necessary conceptions of right conduct that arise out of it, it
  needs to be recast quite as much and even more than the political framework
  needs to be recast. This may involve, it will almost certainly involve, such
  a <i>Kulturfkampf</i> as the world has never seen before. But since it is the
  only possible line of survival, that effort has to be faced. Unless there is
  sufficient mental and moral vigor in our race to achieve the educational
  readjustment, then there seems to be nothing that can possibly arrest the
  present <i>d&eacute;gringolade</i> of <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">&sect; 9. &mdash; SAMPLE OF A GENERATION</a></h2>

  <p>LET us be as full and explicit as possible about this reorganization of
  man's mental superstructure, this reconditioning of his apparatus for
  adaptation, that we are stressing.</p>

  <p>And here again there is nothing original and hardly anything that is
  fairly controversial in what will be stated here. The only originality lies
  in an adherence to one consistent line of thought, to carrying the broad and
  practically indisputable statements of modern ecological science, unimpaired,
  into the field of current human affairs and refusing to be deflected or
  complicated by secondary and irrelevant considerations.</p>

  <p>It happens to have been my role throughout life to assemble facts and
  interpretations of fact, bearing upon man's power of controlling his future.
  From the days of that paradoxical fantasy, <i>The Time Machine</i> (1894)
  onward, my mind, partly no doubt by the accidents of life, but partly also, I
  think, by a natural predisposition, has been directed more and more
  definitely to the question of what is likely to happen in the future. And
  looking back upon this half-century of discussion and suggestion and tracing
  its development phase by phase, a very remarkable change in the whole tenor
  of human thought becomes manifest.</p>

  <p>It is only now, indeed, as I bring all these things together to review,
  that I realize how our attitude to past and future has changed since the
  later-Victorian period. There has been an almost complete reorientation, at
  once profound and subtle, of our minds with regard to time.</p>

  <p>Briefly: the intelligence of the nineties attached much more importance to
  the past and much less to the probabilities of the days to come, than do any
  contemporary minds now. It was living in what appears now as an almost static
  present. The past supplied a picturesque system of justifications for the
  established state of affairs, but it was the established state of affairs
  alone which had any quality of reality. There was a widespread feeling that
  nothing more of primary importance was ever likely to happen. Life as we knew
  it was a leisurely game of consequences. It is difficult now, even for those
  of us who were already living in those days, to recall the entire absence of
  urgency that prevailed. We were carried along by habit and that false sense
  of security which the absence of fundamental crises engenders. To most of my
  generation in the eighties and nineties, all the cardinal discoveries of
  science seemed to have been made, all the great political systems established
  for good, the world permanently apportioned among the Powers. We had a sort
  of feeling that Queen Victoria, under whose rule everybody up to high middle
  age had been born, would go on living forever. The future was something in
  another universe, in another dimension. One could say or think anything one
  liked about it because it did not seem to matter in the least.</p>

  <p>This habit of mind lingered long after the beliefs on which it had been
  established had decayed. It lingers still.</p>

  <p>One factor in the steadily accelerated swing from traditionalism and
  legalism to futurism, that presently began, was certainly the enlargement of
  our horizons by the realization of evolution and geological time and the
  breaking of the barriers set to our imaginations by the myth of the Creation
  and the Fall. But at first there was&mdash;how can one put it?&mdash;an
  intellectual but not a practical release. It was still possible in <i>The
  Time Machine</i> to imagine humanity on the verge of extinction and
  differentiated into two decadent species, the Eloi and the Morlocks, without
  the slightest reflection upon everyday life. Quite a lot of people thought
  that idea was very clever in its sphere, very clever indeed, and no one
  minded in the least. It seemed to have no sort of relation whatever to normal
  existence.</p>

  <p>To a large extent, I shared that detachment. If I was imaginatively
  futurist, I was for all practical purposes contemporaneous. The possible
  extinction of humanity appeared to be something so remote that it never gave
  me a moment's real uneasiness in those days. The future was still no more
  real than dreamland.</p>

  <p>But all that has changed, and I have come through the phases of that
  change. Now the questions: "What is going to happen?" and "And then what will
  happen?" dominate an increasing number of awakening minds among which I am
  moving. We live in a planning world. Everything we do is becoming preparatory
  and anticipatory. Today has vanished almost completely in our enormous
  preoccupation with tomorrow.</p>

  <p>I suppose I have responded as much as anyone in my generation to this
  mental rotation. There is no need therefore for me to apologize for using
  myself as the trace of the flow of thought during the past half century. I
  happen to be the most convenient trace. If I were not so, then somebody else
  should be writing this book instead of me.</p>

  <p>To begin with I used the future as a field for purely imaginative play.
  After <i>The Time Machine</i> I wrote some more futuristic stories. But as
  one followed another I found I was less and less interested in the artistic
  business of making the tale plausible and more and more in the scientific
  interest of making it probable. The turn of the century set many of us
  forecasting in earnest. My natural bias or my journalistic instinct, or maybe
  both in unison, moved me to write <i>Anticipations</i> (1900), in which I
  threw the teller of fantastic tales aside altogether and set myself
  speculating about the coming years. I was moving with the times. The book
  caught on; it was more successful than most novels; it was one of the first
  of such books to sell well. I will not say anything of its guesses, some
  happy, some wildly out. But it left me with the persuasion that here was
  something needing to be done and which could be done much more thoroughly
  than I had done it. My sense of the importance and reality of the future
  increased.</p>

  <p>In 1902 I was reading a paper to the Royal Institution, <i>The Discovery
  Of The Future</i>, in which I was boldly asserting the need to realize and
  accept a forward-looking system of values. I presently found myself in
  correspondence with various parallel groups abroad which, half in defiance
  and half in burlesque, were proclaiming the Futurist doctrine. Among them was
  Signer Marinetti, who came to London reciting, in a tremendous voice, the
  most astounding Futurist poetry. He resented with extreme bitterness the
  English and American tourists in Italy with their red guide-books like
  catalogues at a sale. He was, he said, prepared to destroy all the historical
  monuments in the peninsula. He demanded, loudly and violently, a living
  country and not a museum of antiques.</p>

  <p>The impulse spread, but still for a great number even of
  progressive-minded people it retained a quality of unreality. It was an
  exuberance for them, a lark, a fashion. This Futurist stuff, they felt, could
  not last. In practice they still clung to the established order for their
  permanent values. It was the shock and stresses of the Great War that
  wrenched them away finally from this assumption of permanent stability
  towards a reluctant, imperfect recognition of the greater importance of the
  anticipatory aspect of life. It was like the internal change-over that must
  happen in a bar of iron when it is magnetized. And many quite intelligent
  people were not wrenched away. They kept up their resistances, and a large
  body of the educated still resist&mdash;as we shall see. But the
  forward-looking section accumulated conviction; their sense of reality
  continued to shift away more and more decisively from the thing that is to
  the thing that is to be. <i>The Discovery Of The Future</i> became by degrees
  a matter-of-fact statement for me instead of a daring thesis. I believed in
  it as time went on much more than I had done when first I launched it.</p>

  <p>As the war unfolded before me, my mind was increasingly obsessed by the
  problem of how the war would end and what would come after the war.
  Imaginative people were guessing and inferring and making plans. The word
  "plan" became more and more frequent; at length no newspaper was complete
  without it. A Ministry of Foresight was suggested. We busied ourselves in
  making the New Map of Europe, the New Map of the World. The idea of a "League
  of Nations" emerged amidst this ferment of anticipatory projects. An
  interesting phase in all this forward-looking peering was the War Aims
  controversy, I happened to be working in Northcliffe's Ministry of Propaganda
  in Enemy Countries.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* See <i>Secrets Of Crewe House</i> by Sir Campbell
  Stuart. ]</p>

  <p>I was in particular directing the propaganda in Germany, and, in
  co-operation with Dr. J W. Headlam-Morley, I induced our Crewe House
  colleagues to draw up a memorandum upon the allied war aims and submit it to
  the Foreign Office for endorsement. "This," we said, "is what we suppose we
  are fighting for, and if we can get this we shall be satisfied and the war
  will be at an end. Is that so? We cannot go on with our work properly unless
  we know its objective." The War Office was profoundly shocked. Whatever else
  in the world had been affected by the rotation of the human mind towards the
  future, the Foreign Office has remained immune. There, at any rate, war was
  what it always had been. You fought your way to your enemy's capital and you
  then "dictated terms." The objective of a war was victory. To reveal your
  terms beforehand was not done. So the Foreign Office never committed itself
  to a binding endorsement of our War Aims Memorandum, and it never warned us
  of various secret understandings that affected it. It remained in the
  self-satisfying pose of a superior body tolerating us and using us according
  to the best diplomatic traditions. And at length at Versailles the terms were
  dictated.</p>

  <p>Until the German capitulation we went on with our development of the
  League of Nations movement, committing ourselves to very definite promises to
  the German people, in the hope that our engagements would be honored at the
  Peace. They were not honored. We had taken the utmost pains in our propaganda
  to distinguish between the German people and the Hohenzollern government, and
  to hold out hopes of a speedy return to the fellowship of nations and a
  reasonable prospect of recuperation to a chastened and republican Germany.
  The victorious Foreign Offices treated all that as new-fangled rubbish. The
  Quai d'Orsay in particular seemed obsessed with a dream of obliterating
  Germany, of dividing it up so that it would never reassemble itself. They
  continued to kick Germany about until Germany became frantic with shame and
  hate, until Germany passed from reason to screaming fury. Its screaming fury
  found its incarnation at last in Hitler. He did not hesitate at the thought
  of war. He demanded war. He did not hesitate at the possibility of a
  subsequent social revolution. The victors of Versailles found Red Revolution
  even more terrifying than flaming war, and he played upon that terror. They
  passed from arrogance to propitiatory terror. This madman, they felt, might
  do anything. History became an attempt to humor and appease a lunatic who
  after all&mdash;and that was the worst of it for them&mdash;was not always
  quite so mad as he seemed.</p>

  <p>All that is now quite familiar to everyone. What concerns us more directly
  here are those meetings and movements and discussions that occurred when the
  idea of the League of Nations was being shaped. These deliberations brought
  home to me the confused divergence of historical preoccupations among those
  taking part in them. Their minds were full of broken scraps of history,
  irrational political prejudices, impossible analogies. Everyone saw the idea
  from a different angle and seemed prepared to realize it by the hastiest of
  compromises. The Outline of History was the direct outcome of the experience
  I gathered in these discussions. At first, in conjunction with L.S. Woolf*
  and one or two others, I tried to organize a Research Committee, which would
  set itself to think out the full significance and possibilities of this great
  idea. We made William Archer, who was badly out of a job just then, the
  salaried secretary of this body.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Author of an excellent book, <i>International
  Government</i> (1916).</p>

  <p>With much internal friction we compiled <i>The Idea Of A League Of
  Nations</i>, <i>Prolegomena To The Study Of World Organization</i>, and
  <i>The Way To The League Of Nations: A Brief Sketch Of The Practical Steps
  Needed For The Formation Of A League.</i> These booklets are still available
  for the collector. Then President Wilson came to Europe and we were swept
  aside, because he had his own ideas, and very crude ideas they were, of a
  League that would make the world safe for democracy. But the difficulty of
  producing these two reports opened my eyes to the enormous obstacles in the
  way of all volunteered co-operation. It seemed impossible to hold a team
  together. They differed upon endless points and they would not come together
  to hammer diem out. They were all too intent upon what they considered more
  immediately important things. Our chief financial supporter deserted us to go
  off wool-gathering upon his own lines.* He could not see what need there was
  for all this highbrow research. But we were all going off upon our own lines.
  We had already disintegrated before we were disregarded.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note9a">Note 9A</a>, expanding this.</p>

  <p>At a conference with some representative Americans at the Reform Club
  during the war, I pointed out the urgent need for a general history of
  mankind which would consolidate people's ideas about the establishment of
  some sort of World Pax. Everyone thought it was a good idea. But here again
  was something which was nobody's business in particular. There was no time to
  go about collecting, persuading and editing the academically right people.
  One might as well have asked Lord Acton to write something. An Outline of
  History had to be done soon, even if it had to be flung together&mdash;and,
  getting help wherever I could find it, I flung one together.</p>

  <p>I did it as well as I could, I worked enormously, and the strenuous
  hostile criticism to which it has since been subjected has revealed hardly
  any serious errors of statement. But a lot of it was headlong writing. It
  seemed to me at the time that if I and a few people could show that there was
  a shape to history, then it would be easy, since there is no copyright in the
  past, for the professional historians to rectify any serious flaws and do it
  better. They did nothing of the sort, and, failing that better performance,
  The Outline of History was launched upon a world conspicuously in need of
  just that assemblage of information. It had a fantastic success. Millions of
  copies have been sold and it has been translated into practically every
  important language in the world&mdash;except Italian. Fascist Italy could not
  tolerate the candid criticism of the Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>I was probably rather excited by this astonishing boom. I do not know
  about that because I was not watching myself very closely. But I think that
  even at the time I did realize that this immense sale was no tribute to my
  authorship. It was something much more significant. It was the revelation of
  a world-wide hunger for adequately summarized knowledge on the part of
  multitudes whom the schools had sent empty away.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that this aching void probably extended far beyond the
  field of history. I knew that the general public throughout the world was
  being kept in the blackest ignorance of modern biological knowledge,
  evolutionary thought, modern ideas about individuality and modern psychology.
  I have already told in the Introduction how I realized that in my own case.
  With the assistance of Dr. Julian Huxley and my son, G.P. Wells, I produced a
  far more competent companion volume to <i>The Outline Of History, The Science
  Of Life</i>. It is fuller and more searching and better done than its
  predecessor, but its success was by no means astronomical.</p>

  <p>Then I turned to the most difficult and original of all these
  encyclopaedic essays, <i>The Work, Wealth And Happiness Of Mankind</i>. This
  was an attempt to rescue social, economic and monetary "science" from the
  medieval scholasticism, the theorizing unworldliness, in which it still
  wanders. It was also an attempt to get behind the arbitrary assumptions upon
  which the Marxist doctrine of a necessary class war is based. Instead of
  jumping into the matter in the accepted academic style from some crudely
  plausible assumption, I approached these questions as a special branch of
  human ecology, and opened the matter out from a realistic survey of human
  life as a going concern. I began with a survey of the substances and power in
  the service of man, and thence I pursued a series of interrogations, How? and
  Why? up to government and education.</p>

  <p>It was a laborious task; I chose some unsuitable collaborators from whom I
  had to disentangle the enterprise with considerable expense and difficulty;
  but in the end I managed to get every section of it "vetted" by authorities
  of the first rank. It is sound and tested matter.</p>

  <p>In the end the book failed to earn the attention I think it deserved. The
  title may have been unpromising to the ordinary reader, the manner of its
  marketing unsuitable. It might have had better fortune as <i>An Outline Of
  Social And Economic Knowledge</i>. I am convinced there is as great a public
  ready for a summary of facts and ideas upon social, political and monetary
  matters as there is for historical and biological digests. The book did not
  get to them. The world of economists and so forth ignored it
  completely&mdash;but then it is their practice also to ignore one another
  completely, to ignore almost everything completely. I find a sort of
  recognition of it in Barbara Wootton's brilliant <i>Lament For Economics</i>
  (1938), for which I am discouraged enough to be grateful. She is not
  biologically trained, she is probably quite ignorant of general ecology, but
  her realization that economics has still to become a science and can only
  become a science by admitting the descriptive treatment and examination of
  actual things and processes, is perfectly clear.</p>

  <p>One other book I must mention here. <i>The Salvaging of Civilization</i>
  was written originally to be delivered as lectures in America, a project
  frustrated by a bout of influenza. Therein, borrowing a phrase from Dr. John
  Beattie Crozier,* I launched the idea of a "Bible" for civilization. In this
  idea of a "Bible" for the new social and political order, it is plain that
  Dr. Crozier and myself are groping our way and getting very near to a full
  realization of the scale and nature of the mental readjustment incumbent upon
  the world.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note9ba">Note 9B</a></p>

  <p>This new "Bible" of ours is the World Encyclopaedia, to which I am coming,
  in embryo. I will not recapitulate the various other papers, pamphlets,
  books, with which I documented my successive mental readjustments, because
  they are ceasing to have anything more than a minor, personal significance. I
  was traveling along a road that a number of my contemporaries were
  following.</p>

  <p>Step by step the more responsive elements in my generation were being
  forced towards a complete recognition of the need for a realistic preparation
  for the future, if our existence henceforth was to be anything better than a
  mechanical response to the blows of adverse fate that were beating upon us
  now, faster and faster. We were asking "What shall we do?" and more
  realistically "What have we to do?" and it was plain that the answers to
  these questions needed setting down as the necessary articles of association
  for a world-wide revolutionary effort. There may have been a slight
  slackening of this mental fermentation during the phase of the Fatuous
  Twenties, but it was revived with the mounting sense of urgency that came
  with the Frightened Thirties. Crisis appeared following crisis, each more
  menacing than the last&mdash;it was like the Pacific surf coming in before a
  rising gale&mdash;and what had we prepared for these crises?</p>

  <p>By the early thirties I was one of those who were becoming fully aware
  that the systematic reconditioning of our mental life was not a secondary but
  a primary need for all mankind. It has beyond all question become now the
  most urgent and important thing in the world.</p>

  <p>And also I was realizing the unsatisfactoriness of such detached,
  uncoordinated work as writers of my type were doing. A number of us were all
  saying very much the same sort of thing, but without much co-ordination or
  anything mutual in the way of consequences. We could plead that we were
  pioneering and exploring, but that is merely a provisional plea. There comes
  a time to have done with sketches and samples. There is a quantitative
  element in real affairs. Doing something does not amount to very much unless
  you do enough.</p>

  <p>The achievement of the French Encyclopaedists has always appealed very
  strongly to my imagination. Diderot and his associates had scented the onset
  of change; they had set themselves, in the measure of their times, to prepare
  and equip the ideology of the new world they anticipated. They worked against
  great difficulties and within hampering limitations, but they did produce a
  new, inspiring conception of a world renewed. They gave a definite form and
  direction to the confused and powerful liberal impulses of their time. Their
  assembled thought materialized in the American and French revolutions and in
  a great heartening of the creative spirit of man throughout the whole world.
  They lived in an age of comparatively small things. The public capable of
  understanding and transmitting their ideas was a limited one. But it became
  very clear to me that what was needed in the face of the oncoming challenges
  of our time was essentially a new Encyclopaedism commensurate with the
  relative vastness of our new occasions.</p>

  <p>I set myself to the development of this idea of a modern Encyclopaedism
  which should assemble facts and suggestions with the same insistence upon
  scientific reality and the same exclusion of irrelevances that has controlled
  the establishment of the world outlook I have put before the reader.</p>

  <p>In a small book, <i>World Brain</i> (1938), the reader will find the
  substance of my proposals stated more fully and explicitly than is convenient
  here. I would be glad if the reader could find time to get and read it. I
  have made a sort of campaign for this new Encyclopaedism and I continue to
  work for it to the best of my ability. <i>World Brain</i> is a book, quite
  bold and uncompromising in substance, but still with a distinctly
  propitiatory manner. It makes clear and definite proposals for a world-wide
  reconstruction of what we call higher education. What I call the permanent
  World Encyclopaedia is projected as a permanent institution, a mighty
  super-university, holding together, utilizing and dominating all the teaching
  and research organizations at present in existence. This is shown to be not
  only a plausible and practicable idea, but an idea already finding a material
  embodiment in part and detail, through the common-sense needs of the
  scientific and technical world. A permanent World Encyclopaedia, as I show in
  that book, is indeed crystallizing into existence, but at a pace altogether
  too slow for the urgency of the human situation. Bound up with this in the
  same book is a frank survey of what the citizen of a modern democratic world
  should know&mdash;that is to say, a scheme for an adequate modern education.
  This survey constituted my address as President of the Education Section of
  the British Association at Nottingham in 1937. It is much more provocative in
  its manner than the Royal Institution lecture of which it forms the
  complement. It completely excluded both the Bible mythology and national and
  imperial history from the educational scheme.</p>

  <p>Throughout 1937 I was doing what I could to promote this new
  Encyclopaedism I had in mind, but with very little effect, and in the autumn
  I went to America and lectured, as <i>World Brain</i> relates. There is no
  need to recapitulate that American discourse here, but what is very apparent
  to me as I re-read the book, is the sacrifice of intensity in the effort to
  make it interesting and attractive. I am trying out ways and means in a very
  discursive spirit. I attempt some disarming jests. I write as though there
  was still quite sufficient time in hand to bring about the new mental
  orientation. I still had that feeling. Taking myself as a fair sample of the
  more progressive thought of my time, it is plain that up to the publication
  of <i>World Brain</i> in the spring of 1938 we were still not fully aware of
  the nearness of a culminating crisis in human affairs.</p>

  <p>That forced itself upon our attention in spite of ourselves. We were
  compelled by the rush of circumstances to realize not only the unqualified
  soundness, but also, what is by no means the same thing, the urgent and
  fundamental importance of our intellectual convictions.</p>

  <p>In the summer I was invited to be the guest of the Australian and New
  Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science at Canberra, and this
  involved giving an hour's discourse. I was becoming more and more impatient
  with the failure of the new encyclopaedia idea to secure any energetic
  support, and also I was growing more and more impatient with my own personal
  ineffectiveness in the matter. I determined to use this invitation to assert
  still more plainly and clearly&mdash;to myself among other hearers&mdash;the
  case for a new encyclopaedia and a radical revision of the world's
  educational organization. In Canberra I gave this address the tide of <i>The
  Role of English In The Development Of The World Mind</i>, for reasons I have
  set out in a note at the end of this book.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* For the advantages of English see <a href=
  "#note9c"><i>Note 9C</i></a></p>

  <p>I repeated this lecture with some slight modifications as a public lecture
  in Sydney Town Hall, under the title of <i>The Human Outlook</i>.
  Substantially this book is an expansion of that address. Its line of thought
  is the same; its conclusions are the same. It is fuller, much more explicit
  and more closely reasoned, and its application to current affairs is closer
  and, to my mind, inescapable.</p>

  <p>In addition I volunteered to read another paper to the Education Section
  at Canberra. I called it <i>A Provocative Paper On The Poison Called
  History</i>. This also was made into a very largely attended public lecture,
  at which debate would have been impossible. It was an hour's show. As I
  wanted to bring whatever opposition there might be to my thesis into the
  light of clear statement, I suggested that the Education Section should
  provide time for its discussion.</p>

  <p>The reception of these lectures and addresses was very typical of the
  transitional state of mind in which we are all living, even the most
  enlightened of us. They were, you must take my word for it, vividly
  successful. They were delivered in a setting of compliments and applause. I
  had been stimulating, amazingly stimulating. I had said things that had long
  needed saying. I had given them all food for thought of the most invigorating
  kind. Distinguished men of science came to thank me earnestly for the
  plainness of my statements. And so on.</p>

  <p>And then everything went on just as it had been going on before. The
  stimulant seemed to evaporate at once and the food was certainly not
  assimilated.</p>

  <p>The Right Honorable William Hughes, that distinguished Australian
  statesman, had very kindly consented to preside over my Town Hall lecture and
  at the end of it he expressed his appreciation. "God save us all," he said,
  and then, advancing to the front of the platform, he led the audience with
  the singing of "God Save the King." Everybody stiffened up to attention. I
  had been stating as lucidly as I could the reasons for believing that the
  human species was already staggering past the zenith of its ascendancy and on
  its way through a succession of disasters to extinction. And then we shook
  off the disagreeable vision, and lifted up our voices in simple loyalty to
  things as they are.</p>

  <p>The discussion of that "provocative paper" by the Education Section was
  still more remarkable. I had denounced the teaching of the Judaeo-Christian
  mythology as historical fact, in the most emphatic terms. Not a single
  Christian teacher appeared to reply to that challenge. Most of them,
  including the masters in one or two progressive schools who had been most
  anxious to turn my publicity value to account, contrived to have a parallel
  conference with another Section. In place of a discussion upon the crucial
  points I had sharpened, we had a series of brief, disconnected addresses by
  various educational officials, public characters and thoughtful people, about
  education in general, speaking in an elevated and discursive spirit, making
  many admirable but irrelevant philosophical remarks and including much
  autobiographical material. The avoidance of the essential issue was complete.
  And it was quite deliberate. The discussion was over and nothing had come of
  it and things were still very agreeably as they always had been. Tea was
  ready.</p>

  <p>Now these were not consciously backward people. They knew indeed that they
  were the elite of Australasian progress. These Associations for the
  Advancement of Science throughout the world, the British, the American and
  the Australasian, are essentially assemblies of well-informed and liberal and
  progressive minds. But the real world of our Conference was still this wholly
  present world in which there are parents to consider, promotion to consider,
  dismissals, retirements, a world of knighthoods and honors. I went away
  pondering these things. Presently&mdash;let me confess it, lest I seem to
  claim to be anything better than a sample of a generation&mdash;I found
  myself discussing rather keenly the terms upon which I would lecture in
  Sydney.</p>

  <p>Plainly we are not moving fast enough. We are still balancing in this
  strange phase of indecision between the actual present and the inevitable
  future. Even what we may call the more advanced intelligences vacillate and
  fail to sustain their constructive faith. The established, habitual present
  remains their real world. They may be profoundly
  disturbed&mdash;intellectually. They may be greatly unsettled and alarmed by
  the ever-increasing uncertainty of life, but still, in the exact sense of the
  word "realize," they fail to realize the urgent, implacable future. As the
  legendary gentleman who sat over his drink in the bar of the sinking Titanic
  remarked: "Well, anyhow, the damn thing hasn't gone down yet."</p>

  <p>They are all continually relapsing towards acceptance of the prevalent
  contemporaneous outlook because that is what is most natural in the normal
  human make-up. At any sign of respite they yield to it. Alertness to the
  future, we have to realize, is a novel and artificial thing in life. It has
  to be constantly refreshed and sustained. Minds must be trained and
  accustomed to it; it is a matter of social atmosphere much more than
  individual intelligence. They have to be held up to it by something stronger
  and more permanent than themselves.</p>

  <p>It is only in such an educational organization as I have been deducing
  from our present needs and, I hope, forecasting here, in such a permanent
  organization of knowledge, systematically assembled, continually extended and
  renewed and made freely and easily accessible to everyone, that there is the
  slightest hope of our species meeting the serried challenges of destiny that
  advance upon it. It is impossible to be steadily futuristic, solo, without a
  sustaining social organization which will give as assured and habitual a
  quality to the forward orientation of the everyday life as is now possessed
  by the unprogressive world of today.</p>

  <p>And that organization fails to materialize.</p>

  <p>I am impatient and at the same time I do not know how to accelerate
  matters. I do not think this is simply a case of the distress of an old man
  in a hurry. There is every justification for hurry in the world about us. I
  think that however young and hopeful I might be, I should still be intensely
  impatient to see this movement for human re-education quickened and
  implemented.</p>

  <p>This reconditioning and reorientation of the human mind has to be
  undertaken not merely against the innate resistances to changing conditions
  in everyone's make-up. These innate resistances are organized very powerfully
  and effectively, and the nature of their organization is one we have now to
  examine. And also we are working against time. It is this time factor that
  casts the darkest shadow upon the possibility of a single, clear-headed,
  creative, happily interested, war-free human community emerging from the
  returning chaos of the present to dominate our planet through long ages still
  to come.</p>

  <p>Years ago I threw out a sentence that caught the attention of that very
  great and lucid historian, James Harvey Robinson. He picked it up and
  repeated and commended it and gave it a wide publicity. The outlook for
  mankind, I had written&mdash;I think in <i>The Salvaging Of
  Civilization&mdash;</i>"a race between education and catastrophe."</p>

  <p>Today catastrophe is well on its way, it is losing no time at all, but
  education seems still unable to get started, has indeed not even readjusted
  itself to start. The race may, after all, prove a walk-over for disaster.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">&sect; 10. &mdash; ESTIMATING HOPE</a></h2>

  <p>HERE a personal factor comes in, which, I think, should be explained to
  the reader.</p>

  <p>We are now in a field of thought from which it is impossible to banish a
  temperamental estimate of values. I find a certain defeatism has invaded my
  mind in the course of the past year. I anticipate very little happiness in
  the residue of my life. I feel that the odds are very heavily against any
  such educational revolution being even attempted in my lifetime&mdash;there
  will be no Pisgah glimpse of the promised world for me&mdash;and that in all
  probability my last years will be passed in a very ugly and distressful phase
  of human history. In many quarters I am unlikely to be a <i>persona
  grata</i>, A spell of ill-health involving bodily discomfort and a
  considerable ebb of mental resilience is contributing to this depression.
  These are my circumstances. That matter of health is comparatively a minor
  issue. But quite apart from any bodily depression, the spectacle of evil in
  the world during the past half-dozen years&mdash;the wanton destruction of
  homes, the ruthless hounding of decent folk into exile, the bombings of open
  cities, the cold-blooded massacres and mutilations of children and
  defenseless gentle people, the rapes and filthy humiliations and, above all,
  the return of deliberate and organized torture, mental torment and fear to a
  world from which such things had seemed wellnigh banished&mdash;has come near
  to breaking my spirit altogether.</p>

  <p>Said an old friend of mine the other day: "If only we could get away from
  events for a spell! If only we could get together as we used to get together
  and laugh!"</p>

  <p>Children still laugh. Laughter is born again in each generation. What is
  past is over and done with for those who did not share in it. Life begins
  again incessantly. The sequence of birth and death is a continuing amnesty,
  but for my generation there have been things so unforgettable and
  disappointments so bitter that for us laughter has become almost a brutality.
  The dead past is dead&mdash;but not for us. We have been too near it and we
  are splashed with blood.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note10a"><i>Note 10A</i></a> for a
  schoolgirl's reaction to A.R.P.</p>

  <p>It is well to remind the reader that though all that follows is written
  as. objectively and truly as I can, it is overshadowed by these misadventures
  of my generation and mental type. The younger the reader is the more he or
  she should be able to discount the discouragement of our shadows.</p>

  <p>And a consideration he must bear in mind in weighing what I am putting
  before him is the probability that there is a kind of egotistical intolerance
  in every definitely elderly mind. That is almost inevitable. Through a long
  life a complex system of ideas is built up upon a framework of concepts and
  associations determined by early circumstances. One qualifies, modifies,
  extends, superimposes significance upon this primary structure, but after a
  time it becomes irreplaceable. It may not be the best possible foundation,
  but the more it has to carry, the less it can be changed. It is like a
  business that has grown up in reasonably convenient premises, they might be
  better laid out perhaps, but there is no possibility now of completely
  revising the lay-out. The going concern must carry on. But it becomes more
  and more difficult to rephrase one's ideas or to recognize them when they are
  rephrased. So that I may be much less alone and outstanding than I am
  disposed to think.</p>

  <p>The nearer my beliefs are to reality the more probable it is that similar
  minds may be traveling along parallel, if not identical, lines of thought to
  practically the same conclusions, approached perhaps from a different
  starting-point and so differently phrased. I suspect and indeed I hope that
  I do not allow fully for that.</p>

  <p>For example, there is the peculiar dialect of so many minds in the war
  generation who resorted to communism and the Communist Party to express their
  recoil from the existing state of affairs. It was the handiest formula for
  any sort of organized dissent. Many of them&mdash;not all, alas!&mdash;are
  emerging to a broader conception of what can be done with life, but they
  still speak with a strong Marxist accent. Some few, and my friend J.B.S.
  Haldane is among their number, seem to be resolved like Lenin (but without
  the justification of his circumstances) to read a wisdom and profundity into
  the sage of Highgate which was certainly not there. His Haldane Memorial
  Lecture (Birkbeck College, May 24th, 1938), was, to my mind, a brilliant yet
  obstinately perverse overvaluation of the role of Marx (and Engels) in human
  thought, which may well have made the worthy uncle whom he was commemorating
  turn in his grave. Lord Haldane also professed the Hegelian faith and that
  was his nephew's justification. This lecture made the most of Marx, I insist,
  and more also. And then more.</p>

  <p>Now I have always had a peculiar contempt and dislike for the mind and
  character of Karl Marx, a contempt and dislike that have deepened with the
  years. I have given it the liveliest expression I could contrive in "The
  Shaving of Karl Marx" in <i>Russia In The Shadows</i> and in the
  "Psychoanalysis of Karl Marx" in <i>The World Of William Clissold</i>. My
  only regret for these brief essays is that I could not infuse more sting and
  challenge into them. I have watched the tradition of Marxian bad manners and
  Marxian dogmatism wrapping like a blanket of fog round the minds of two
  crucial generations. They seemed to me to be lost in the fog. It was
  difficult for me to think they could be advancing under that fog.</p>

  <p>Yet when, for example, I turn over such a book as <i>The Social Function
  Of Science</i> by that very considerable writer, Professor J.D. Bernal,
  F.R.S., I get at times, in spite of his very distinct Marxist twang, a
  curious sense of parallelism and co-operation. And much that J.B.S. Haldane
  said in his lecture, I find as I read it over again, I could subscribe to,
  except that I reject the Marxist attribution.</p>

  <p>I am reminded of the story of an Englishman who had a more or less
  rudimentary cultural conversation with a Japanese gentleman. The latter broke
  into an oration, a gabble, a flow of unfamiliar sounds which sounded like no
  known human speech. Then something clicked over in the hearer's mind. He made
  some rapid transpositions and light broke upon him. He was hearing one of the
  most familiar of Shakespeare's speeches in English! English of a different
  tint.</p>

  <p>I have been asserting, in a phraseology that no doubt owes much more than
  I realize to the phrases and assumptions of the liberal, protestant,
  progressive world of half a century ago, a view of the human outlook, that
  seems to me to be irresistibly convincing if one accepts a known series of
  facts. The truer and more inevitable that view is, the more probable it is
  that intelligent men, starting from all sorts of different standpoints, will
  converge upon the same conclusions. In English of a different tint. Indeed,
  it will be the completest disproof of my contentions, if there is not that
  convergence, if my conclusions do not reappear independently, crop up from a
  variety of starting-points and yet work out towards practically the same
  pattern. If the compelling facts do, as I assert, lie plainly on the face of
  things, that must be so. But probably, because I have a phraseology of my
  own, I shall be among those least able to recognize it.</p>

  <p>And another thing that anyone who has spent most of his mental energy in
  trying to give the fullest and most emphatic expression to the truth as he
  perceives it, may easily underrate, is the tacit insubordination of many of
  the suppressed and formally silenced minds who are apparently disciplined
  against us. It is well to recall that all that outbreak of liberal
  questioning, the Protestant Reformation, which did so much to prepare the way
  for the French Revolution, was due almost entirely to the mental insurrection
  of friars or priests. They had had to take their creeds seriously, and they
  had brooded over their dogmas until they found them unbearable. There was no
  effective attack from without upon Church teaching throughout the whole
  Reformation period. There were close at hand in the alien disbeliefs of Jew
  and Moslem, a tacit denial of the Catholic faith, but these provoked no
  reforming zeal. All that came from within. And conversely the Jesuit Counter
  Reformation was the work of a group of romantic-minded laymen led by a
  court-bred gallant who had been wounded and crossed in love. The seven
  founders of the Society of Jesus were with one exception laymen. They were
  excited outsiders. They believed crudely and without qualification. They had
  had none of that intimate instruction of the mind from which questionings
  arise. They were, so to speak, the Nazis of Roman Catholicism.</p>

  <p>But that is a passing comment. The more relevant point is the
  indisputable, obstinate tendency of common sense to assert itself in minds
  deliberately trained in any elaborate system of intolerance and error.
  Fanatics are madmen who find a masochist pleasure in strangling their own
  doubts, there is no dealing with them; but wherever there is discussion and
  mental training there lurks in every organized dogmatism a class of potential
  rebels. Hidden allies and half-hearted antagonists may be waiting to come
  over to a movement for the radical reconstruction of human ideology as it
  gathers strength. They are, so to speak, among the undisclosed reserves of
  progress.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in further mitigation of my defeatist mood, it has to be borne
  in mind that while there is still life in a species no biological defeat is
  complete. Men and women of my type of mind and my generation, however the
  odds work against us, have no alternative to a stoical persistence in our
  convictions until our courses are run. We may have to admit regretfully a
  loss of buoyancy and of the ability for flexible mental co-operations. That
  is our private affair. In that we are just as much war casualties as those
  who may</p>

  <p>have suffered physical disablement in battle but are not yet completely
  incapacitated. Our injuries narrow down the scope of our service, but they
  furnish no justification for abandoning a loyal participation in the
  struggle. Our cause may still be winning.</p>

  <p>Finally, as to the urgency of all this, let it be remembered that nothing
  is more difficult than estimating possibilities in time, and that timing here
  is a factor of primary importance. Disaster seems to me to be advancing upon
  us, but it may be that I am overlooking or underestimating the possibility of
  some intercalary slowing-down in the pace of change. I may be failing to
  perceive possible delaying forces. Some unexpected development of
  anti-aircraft technique might, for example, greatly minimize the
  destructiveness of air raids and the possibility of surprise wars.* The world
  may be held back from disaster for a time by the very weight and strain of
  its own armaments. It may be false to assume that sooner or later guns will
  go off of their own accord. Guns can rust and explosives disintegrate. A
  balance of power may be possible for longer years than I suppose, heavy and
  burthensome years perhaps, but still not years of complete catastrophic
  collapse.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note10b"><i>Note 10B</i></a> for such a
  possibility.</p>

  <p>In that pause, many people will be thinking hard, and the human
  intelligence may find methods of discussion and organization unknown to us. I
  find myself unable to imagine any such respite, and so I cannot bring it
  honestly into my account-rendered of the world, but there may be such a
  possibility. That gives no excuse for slackening, but it does justify a
  certain hopefulness.</p>

  <p>With that I think I can finish with myself as a typical sample in evidence
  in this survey of the reaction of <i>Homo sapiens</i> to his present dangers.
  These ego-centered passages are not really so egotistical as they will seem
  to be to the antagonistic reader. It is auto-vivisection. I was by far the
  best and handiest rabbit for this demonstration.</p>

  <p>Allowing for my own loss of individual hopefulness and that probable
  narrowing down of co-operative tolerance in my mind, the conclusions I am
  presenting to you remain nevertheless sound, grimly sound. The prospect for
  our species is just as stern and implacable, charged just as much with
  bracing uncertainty. The issue upon which I am in doubt is not whether I am
  right or wrong about the facts I have assembled; it is simply whether you of
  the new generation can be sufficiently braced in time. There, maybe, I do you
  an injustice. That is what I am saying.</p>

  <p>What I have admitted in qualification of my own ebb of confidence, is no
  justification whatever for mere optimistic trumpetings&mdash;"I believe in
  the ultimate triumph of civilization"&mdash;and so forth. We have heard so
  much of that kind of hysteria. Without personal and organized devotion it
  means less than nothing. It is desertion under cover of a declaration of
  faith.</p>

  <p>There are always plenty of well-meaning people in the world ready to relax
  at the slightest encouragement, and the surest preparation for disaster is
  the enervation of sentimental overconfidence. Face your adversary at his
  worst and most menacing, and then you will know best how to set about him.
  Rational adaptation, I admit, may be achieved ultimately, but only
  heroically, at a great cost. The odds are against it, rest assured, if not
  perhaps so heavily against it a$ nowadays they seem to be, to me.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">&sect; 11. &mdash; SURVEY OF EXISTING FORCES</a></h2>

  <p>WE are now in a position to reconsider the nature of the various
  established systems that block the way to the readjustment of the human
  species as one single, continually progressive and creative world community,
  and to make a rough estimate of the way in which they are operating at the
  present time. We arrive with minds cleansed and refreshed by our survey of
  the biological situation, at the political, social and religious realities of
  today.</p>

  <p>Legally the world's affairs are in the control of a miscellany of
  sovereign states, and each embodies itself in a government of politicians and
  officials, deeply concerned in maintaining the bargaining autonomy of the
  particular regime which gives them their importance, and prepared to offer a
  spirited resistance to any invasion, conquest or amalgamation of brave little
  (or big or old) Ruritania, or whatever state it is. That is how the political
  map of the world presents things to us. But very few of these legal
  governments are real cultural entities. It is only one or two sovereignties
  that embody a complete cultural system of their own. For all practical
  purposes the British Empire is such a system, with a curiously loose yet
  persistent will and tradition, sustained by a very distinctive literature of
  biographies, memoirs, collected letters and speeches and the like, and a
  quite definite religion&mdash;or religious substitutes&mdash;the Anglican
  compromise between Protestant and Catholic Christianity. Still more complete
  is the Nazi Germany of today, which indeed is now strenuously self-sufficient
  even to the extent of a distinctive science, art, literature, history,
  clothing, dietary of its own. But most of the other states play their game of
  international competition over a sort of map which does not necessarily
  correspond to their spheres of sovereignty. They are like estates, farms and
  fields spreading over a substratum of soils and geological formations.</p>

  <p>It is to these underlying foundation realities of the world situation that
  we must first direct our attention.</p>

  <p>As the facts assembled in <i>The Outline Of History</i> showed very
  clearly, the expansion in size of the early empires (saving only Egypt with
  its Nile) was dependent upon two advances in communication, writing and
  road-making. These expanding empires of the second and first millennia B.C.
  put a great strain upon the tribal and petty national religions (which in
  those days included the science and morality) of the smaller states they
  incorporated. A working compromise was found in a sort of fusion of the
  absorbing and absorbed cultures. A rejuvenated religion was produced by a
  mutual modification of ceremony and myth. The corresponding gods of these
  syncretic religions adopted each other's names as aliases, or they became
  different "aspects" of a consolidated deity (theocrasia). A general
  similarity in these more primordial tribal cults greatly facilitated this
  syncretic process.</p>

  <p>About these primordial religions we now have a considerable body of
  assured knowledge. And this is not&mdash;we must underline
  here&mdash;knowledge in dispute. It is not a collection of theories we are
  bringing into court; it is an assemblage of facts. What we have to cite here
  is no more questionable than the facts of evolution and ecology that have
  been assembled in the earlier sections of this book. It is indeed knowledge
  that is not made accessible to everyone; that is the default of our
  educational systems; it is steadfastly ignored by many people who find it
  inconvenient and distasteful; but that does not affect its truth.</p>

  <p>We know that these early religions were systems of fear and propitiation,
  that they centered upon the primary importance of a seasonal blood sacrifice,
  and that that sacrifice was the function of a priesthood, which was also in
  charge of the calendar and of whatever medical knowledge existed. From <i>The
  Golden Bough</i> of Sir James George Frazer, O.M., and from <i>Forerunners
  And Rivals Of Christianity</i>, by F. Legge (published by the Cambridge
  University Press), the unbiased reader can realize for himself how this
  cannibal blood sacrifice has been refined at last into the Mystery of the
  Mass, which will indeed have very little mystery left for him if he faces the
  facts these writers, with no unnecessary emphasis nor any partisan purpose,
  put plainly before him.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note11a"><i>Note 11A</i></a></p>

  <p>These investigations into the beginnings of religion have accumulated
  steadily throughout the past half-century. It is only by great efforts of
  censorship, by sectarian education of an elaborately protected sort and the
  like, that ignorance about them is maintained.</p>

  <p>These seasonal blood-sacrifice religions had a wide range of local
  variation, their theogonies differed widely&mdash;in some of them, mystical,
  secret mother-nature goddesses lurked behind the great father god; in others,
  the totem animal prevailed&mdash;but in all their forms they sustained the
  fear-begotten idea of blood salvation. Two dozen centuries ago they were
  already suffering through the pressure not only of syncretic necessity but
  from the increasing skepticism of the awakening human intelligence. They
  still cumbered the earth with a multitude of temples and priesthoods, for
  where there is an endowment you can always find someone to be a priest, but
  they were producing complex developments of their theological
  explanations.</p>

  <p>Ptolemaic Alexandria was a hot-bed of religious elaboration. At the
  Serapeum, before the middle of the third century B.C., it had produced a
  trinity with a sacrificial son, who is slain and ascends to the Father and
  becomes the Father. There were a regular and secular clergy, monks with
  tonsures, a choral Easter ceremony; and the worship of the goddess Isis
  bearing the infant Horus in her arms anticipated the Catholic adoration of
  the Virgin Mary down even to minor details. The hymn "Sun of my Soul, thou
  Saviour dear," addressed originally to the hawk-sun-god Horus, has become a
  Christian hymn. In the temples one saw collections of ex-votos hung up in
  gratitude for miraculous cures and escapes, and the ceremonial purchase and
  burning of votive candles was encouraged. The hope of a glorious
  immortality&mdash;which was little stressed in the earlier religions outside
  Egypt&mdash;was a central fact in this religious scheme, and so, too, was an
  insistence upon the material resurrection of the (in Egypt usually pickled)
  body. All this was going on nearly three centuries before there was a
  Christian in the world.</p>

  <p>But very few Christians know these facts. They are all to be found fully
  documented in Legge (op. cit.).</p>

  <p>We must turn now to a second factor in the basis of 'the cultural life of
  Europe and the Europeanized world, the Sacred Book.</p>

  <p>While religious cults were limited in their range and appealed at most to
  a few thousand votaries, it was possible to sustain 'them by direct teaching
  and initiation, but as greater empires grew with the development of writing
  and land and sea communications, there appeared a new demand and also a new
  facility for mental organization. This was the written word. Spreading over
  the old sacrificial paganism, there presently appeared what one may
  distinguish as Book religions. Every great religion in the world today,
  whether it does or does not preserve the tradition of the cannibalistic blood
  sacrifice, is a Book religion.</p>

  <p>The first of the Sacred Books to affect the Western world was the
  collection of Hebrew writings constituting the core of what is now called the
  Old Testament. It came into existence as a natural result of the series of
  misfortunes that happened to the various communities speaking the closely
  related Semitic languages which had dominated the Western world a thousand
  years before the Christian era. These were the Babylonian, Phoenician and
  Carthaginian states, the Jews who had been deported to Babylon and then
  returned to Palestine, and a variety of trading colonies and settlements in
  association with these Semitic-speaking centers. In the course of a few
  centuries these highly civilized and intelligent trading empires and cities,
  in common with various other old-world communities, collapsed under a series
  of barbarian raids and conquests coming from the North. Most of these
  Northern barbarians spoke languages of the Aryan group. Between the Homeric
  Age and the third century B.C. they had, as the Persians, the Greeks and
  Macedonians, the Romans and Gauls, become masters of the larger part of the
  Mediterranean world, leaving the less warlike, Semitic-speaking peoples,
  inter alia, subdued and scattered and defeated but still trading, sustaining
  a financial network, navigating the seas and going to and fro in the world.
  They remained in possession of these roles because they knew more about them.
  The conquerors, as they became civilized, availed themselves, with a certain
  suspicion and resentment, of these superior gifts and facilities of the
  defeated. The Semitic business methods were ready-made for the new kings and
  aristocrats and warriors. They learnt to use them slowly and left them
  largely in Semitic hands.</p>

  <p>During the course of these conquests there was naturally a great
  intermingling of blood. The subjugated Semitic and pre-Semitic peoples were
  certainly in the majority in the Latin, Greek, Persian 'and Macedonian
  empires; history records no general ban upon intermarriage, and we can hardly
  doubt that the actual blood of the ruling Aryan-speaker was the smaller
  factor in that continually stirred-up mixture which is now the European and
  Europeanized world of today.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note11b"><i>Note 11B</i></a> on the
  racial unity of mankind.</p>

  <p>But traditions were less easily assimilated. Throughout that millennium
  which culminated in the Roman Empire, in all the ports and cities there must
  have been groups of households and business organizations struggling to
  maintain a level of refinement and behavior higher than that of their rulers,
  and eager also to preserve their business correspondence and a sympathetic
  understanding with their kindred throughout this new world that had
  annihilated and discredited their separate religious systems. They needed a
  Book to unify them, they were ripe for a Book, and the Book was ready for
  them.</p>

  <p>It was in Babylon and Judaea and in the towns of these regions that those
  Jewish sacred writings first appeared. They contained two overlapping
  versions of the old Babylonian cosmogony, together with the myths of the
  Creation, the Serpent-Enemy, the Fall, the Flood and the Tower of Babel. They
  also contained the story of a Promise and of a Chosen People who were
  destined to recover all and more than their ancient ascendancy. But at a
  price. These Chosen People had to keep themselves aloof from the Gentile
  world. They must preserve their precious distinctive habits and usages
  intact. They must remain aloof and enduring, until a promised Messiah came to
  lead Israel to its final triumph over the rest of mankind.</p>

  <p>The appeal of these Scriptures to. the needs and imaginations of these
  scattered peoples on the defensive must have been irresistible. In a century
  or so Carthaginians, Phoenicians, Babylonians disappear from history, and all
  over the world of their former activities the Jewish communities appear,
  centering upon the schools of Babylon and Jerusalem with a consolidating
  literature and a religion. In this stage they proselytized freely. Probably
  the proselytizing was chiefly among kindred and sympathetic Semitic-speakers,
  but there were also Tartar and other tribes which were won over. The
  blood-sacrifice tradition was sustained by the priests in the Temple until
  the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian in 70 A.D. Then the sacrifices ceased and
  the Sacred Book with its semi-authoritative accretions became the link of
  Jewry throughout the world....</p>

  <p>So the first of the great Book religions on which our civilization rests
  arose. Hard upon its diffusion followed Christianity, its unidentical
  twin.</p>

  <p>Christianity began as a Jewish sect, as the Books of the New Testament
  tell very simply and clearly; it was still entirely Jewish after the
  Crucifixion; and it was only through the initiative of Saint Paul that the
  ranks of the elect were opened to the uncircumcised. After the Four Gospels,
  the New Testament is largely occupied with Paul's reconstruction of the
  Nazarene cult. It is all very plain to anyone who reads these books without
  theological prepossessions. His brilliant intelligence seized upon the idea
  of presenting Jesus as the sacrificial king of the blood-sacrifice tradition.
  Jesus, he declared, was the Lamb by whose blood we were saved&mdash;though as
  a matter of fact crucifixion is hardly a more bloody death than hanging. He
  had died, said Saint Paul, not only for the Jews but for all men who would
  accept his sacrifice. This, for the stricter Jews, was an intolerable
  relaxation of their divine bargain. But some, less profoundly convinced of
  the Messianic hope, realized the attractive quality of the Pauline
  teaching.</p>

  <p>The medium of diffusion for Christianity remained for a time the scattered
  Jewish communities. Throughout the first and second centuries Judaism and its
  offshoot, Christianity, the latter becoming more and more Gentile and anti-
  Jewish, spread and bickered side by side throughout the whole extent of the
  Roman Empire. The pagan world, although it was also in a state of great
  social and religious unrest&mdash;the two things seem to be
  inseparable&mdash;had no comparable nexus for the production of alternative
  sacred writings that could stand up against the dissemination of these
  Judaeo-Christian legends and mythology. So that these latter provided the
  written factor in the foundations of civilization throughout the entire
  Western world.</p>

  <p>Later, another Book religion, Islam, swept for a time across the
  Mediterranean scene, with very considerable reactions upon medieval science
  and thought. But that influence, and the effects of a vast multitude, myriads
  indeed, of less distinguished "Sacred Book" cults, are outside our present
  discussion.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to recall these well-known&mdash;though persistently
  neglected&mdash;facts--here because they establish a general statement that
  what we may call roughly Western culture&mdash;the mental adaptation of
  mankind to social and political life, from -the Pacific coast westward across
  the Atlantic to farthest eastern Russia, up to as late as the second Russian
  Revolution in 1917&mdash;was based upon an interrelated system of
  Bible-centered Book religions which had either obliterated or assimilated the
  more ancient blood-sacrifice cults.</p>

  <p>Let us now review the chief forms these foundation religions take in our
  world today.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">&sect; 12 &mdash; THE JEWISH INFLUENCE</a></h2>

  <p>FIRSTLY, because of its illuminating quality, we must consider the
  progressive segregation of the Jewish community. It has diverted, wasted and
  sterilized an amount of ability and moral energy that mankind at large can
  ill spare. In the previous section we have shown how naturally it arose out
  of the state of world affairs of the centuries before and after the Christian
  era, and how the realistic genius of Saint Paul sought an escape from its
  perilous limitations. From the very beginning, there must have been men of
  vision among the Jews who realized and rebelled against the moral isolation
  to which they were being condemned, there must have been a continual
  seeping-away of individuals to the larger opportunities of the outer world,
  but the uncompromising tradition carried by the old Bible and the associated
  writings which grew into the Talmud has been sufficient to hold together a
  core of inassimilable and aggressive orthodoxy to this day clinging
  obstinately to every detail of ritual, behavior and avoidance that emphasized
  the central legend of a Chosen People. It is this orthodox remnant and its
  behavior and influence, the repercussions it evokes and the dangers to which
  it has exposed the whole Jewish community, which constitute the Jewish
  problem. There would be no distinctive Jewish question at all were it not for
  this remnant and its activities.</p>

  <p>The whole question turns upon the Chosen People idea, which this remnant
  cherishes and sustains, which it is the "mission" of this remnant to cherish
  and sustain. It is essentially a bad tradition, and the fact that for two
  thousand years the Jews on the whole have been very roughly treated by the
  rest of mankind does not make it any the less bad. Almost every community
  with which the orthodox Jews have come into contact has sooner or later
  developed and acted upon that conspiracy idea. A careful reading of the Bible
  does nothing to correct it.</p>

  <p>Every sort of man is disposed to get together with his own sort of people
  and prefer them to strangers. That is the natural disposition of our species,
  fair play to the outsider is one of the last and least assured triumphs of
  civilization, but the indictment against the Jewish community is 'that their
  religion of a Chosen People takes this universal human vice, justifies it and
  stimulates it to the form of a persistent organized attitude of
  self-exclusion from the common fellowship of the world.</p>

  <p>Everywhere the same reaction occurs and everywhere the Jew expresses his
  astonishment. Not only Christians but Turks have resorted to pogroms. In
  contact with the Arab, the Koran-taught Arab from the desert, who shares the
  Jew's cosmogony, who practices similar dietetic taboos, who is equally free
  from Trinitarian theology and sacrificial bloodshed, and has indeed a much
  stronger claim to be called Semitic, the angry reaction to the theory and
  practice of a Chosen People, to the practice much more than the theory, is
  just as violent as it is in any other part of the world.</p>

  <p>It is this Chosen People tradition and still more the habit of mind which
  betrays itself in those who have come under its influence, which is the ever-
  recurrent cause of the trouble. It seems to me beside the mark to look for
  any other.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note12a"><i>Note 12A</i></a> for a
  further discussion of this point.</p>

  <p>Estimates of the number of Jews in the world vary between fourteen and
  sixteen million. The latter figure is given by Louis Golding in <i>The Jewish
  Problem</i> and by Lewis Browne in the careful and scholarly work he has
  entitled so flippantly, <i>How Odd Of God</i>. ("How odd of God to choose the
  Jews!"&mdash;W.N. Ewer.) This is not a very great total. They have and always
  have had abundant and well-cared-for families. Probably outside the range of
  definitely associated Jews, there has always been a much larger world of
  sympathetic kin, sharing and affected by the feelings of the stricter core,
  capable of co-operating with it and responding to modifications of the
  central idea, but gradually slipping away beyond recall.</p>

  <p>As we have noted in &sect; 11 (and see also <i>Note 11B</i>) most of us
  probably have a more or less considerable proportion of "Jewish" blood in our
  veins, using "Jewish" in the larger sense. But orthodox Judaism has always
  been a narrower and intenser strain. It has passed through phases of leakage
  and recovery. The Protestant Reformation was a phase of leakage. Browne
  doubts whether there were half a million Jews in Europe in 1600, "fewer than
  were to be found in Castile alone four hundred years earlier."</p>

  <p>Of the sixteen million Jews today, Browne estimates that there cannot be
  more than four million who are strict adherents to and observers of the Law
  and that perhaps another six million are what he calls semi-observant; they
  are lax about food and drink and the Sabbath, but when it comes to
  celebrating marriages, funerals, taking an oath and so forth they follow the
  ancient formulae, they attend the main annual feasts, they pay their pew
  rents and do their full duty by the Jewish charities. They are very much like
  the Anglicans who don't go to Church very much but would never dream of being
  married in a registry office. Then comes another three million who have
  become entirely indifferent to the Law. They do not attack it, but they put
  it aside. Yet they cling as nationalists to the solidarity it has preserved
  through the ages. They are Reform Jews or Radical Nationalists, like the
  law-disregarding young Jews of Palestine. Mr. Browne is himself a Reform
  Rabbi and he can write incidentally:</p>

  <p>"There are certain writers who become tremulously nostalgic and tender
  when describing the life of those pietist Jews. Ensconced in laurel-embowered
  English cottages, or seated in cafes on Montparnasse, such writers will wax
  ecstatic as they discourse on the effulgent 'mysticism' enhaloing the ghetto
  hovels. But that, I fear, is because they have never entered those hovels.
  Had they done so they would in all likelihood realize&mdash;unless
  sentimentality had too thickly blurred their sight&mdash;that life in them is
  not bathed in the lambent light of unearthly wisdom: that instead it is dark
  and scabrous with superstition."</p>

  <p>The remaining three of these sixteen million Jews are rapidly ceasing to
  be Jews at all, and he notes with a sort of calm amazement that "a cult which
  has lasted for centuries could be shattered in a decade." The younger
  generation has been given equality in the U.S.S.R,, excellent schools and a
  new and exciting creed. Nominally they remain Jews, and their language,
  Yiddish, is one of the national languages recognized by the Union. But Hebrew
  has vanished&mdash;the Law, the Promise and Jehovah!</p>

  <p>And at this point Browne and I part company. Judaism may vanish in Russia
  under communism, he has to admit, but it will live on elsewhere not by virtue
  of its own quality but because of Gentile intolerance. He argues that Gentile
  intolerance makes the Jews and keeps them together. I argue that the Jews
  make themselves and that Gentile intolerance is a response to the cult of the
  Chosen People. To get down to ultimate things, we are in substantial
  agreement, I find, in that we desire a world, enlightened, scientifically
  administered, free, a world-wide new civilization open to everyone, where
  there will be neither Jew nor Gentile, bond nor free. Nevertheless we differ
  diametrically in our interpretation of the root cause of the Jewish problem,
  and as a consequence upon the question where the tentative for
  denationalization should begin. Thirteen million Jews&mdash;at
  least&mdash;still make the implacable Gentile the justification for their own
  persistence. They still hold to that hard core of national separatism in
  spite of the steady evaporation of every traditional religious justification.
  Yet they have a world-wide organization for calling off that attitude and the
  Gentiles have no corresponding representative network to speak for them to
  the same extent. The Holy See has recently condemned racialism very clearly
  and definitely. So has the White House....</p>

  <p>But let me go on with what I believe is the truer version of the Jewish
  story, and the reader, with a glance at the notes at the end whenever he
  needs confirmation, must judge between me and the defenders of persistent
  Jewish nationalism.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note12b"><i>Note 12B</i></a> for that
  fuller discussion.</p>

  <p>The hostile reaction to the cult of the Chosen People is spreading about
  the entire world today. In the past the Jews have been subjected to much
  resentful treatment and much atrocious cruelty and injustice, now here, now
  there, but there has never been such a world-wide&mdash;I will not use the
  word anti-Semitism because of the Arab&mdash;I will say anti-Judaism. Now,
  because of the physical unification of the world, the resentment against the
  theory and practice of a Chosen People is much quicker and more contagious
  than it used to be; it is becoming world-wide and simultaneous. The idea is
  becoming everywhere more and more intolerable than it has ever been
  before.</p>

  <p>The cultivated, exaggerated, national egotism of the Chosen People has
  never been so conspicuous as it has been in the present century and
  particularly since the War. As their ritualism has weakened their nationalism
  has increased. I recall a conference that took place in '19 or '20 in a room
  in the House of Commons. A number of French writers had deputed Madame
  Madeleine Marx to discuss with various English men and women of letters the
  possibilities of concerted action and possibly organization in the cause of
  world peace and world understanding. In those days Israel Zangwill had
  adopted the role of Champion of the downtrodden and suffering Jewish race,
  and more particularly of that section of it which was to be found in the
  wealthier mansions of West Kensington and Tyburnia, <i>en route</i> from the
  East End to the House of Lords. He sustained its racial pride, if indeed that
  needed sustaining. He insisted upon Israel's distinction and its inappeasable
  hunger for restoration to the land of the protracted Promise. He told them of
  the <i>Dreamers of the Ghetto</i>. He reminded them of their origins with
  humor and emotion. He helped them to feel "different," as the American car
  salesmen say, and mystically better. They were, he persuaded them, not really
  having the good time they seemed to be having; behind the brave face they put
  upon things they were weeping by the waters of Babylon. The true voice of
  Israel was to be heard not in the West End of London -but when it went off
  for a trip to Palestine and, following the customary routine, wailed at the
  Wailing Wall. Always he spoke of "<i>My</i> people."</p>

  <p>He brought his championship to our deliberations. We various British
  authors had had our trivial shares in the "war to end war," and we were very
  willing to fall in with any proposals that would help to rationalize the
  heated and punitive atmosphere of the Versailles peace. We felt that a peace
  that would indeed end war was slipping away from us. But we found this
  conference dominated by the communist dogmatism of Madame Marx, against which
  Bernard Shaw protested, and Zangwill's preoccupation with his "people." He
  laid down the conditions that would satisfy their needs; he insisted on what
  would satisfy them, what would make them willing to help us, and the
  difficulties an offended Jewry could create for us. So far as I could grasp
  his drift he was dealing with us as the British Empire. We were not the
  British Empire, but it was vain to protest. Zangwill was a very resolute
  character and that was the drama he had in mind. Just as in our private
  disputes he would insist on treating me as a devout Christian. Then he could
  say: "But your Saviour was a Jew!" Useless to plead that I was not a
  Christian, and that there might be considerable prepotency in the Holy Ghost.
  Zangwill was being the captive nation making his terms with the oppressor. It
  is the drama so many people still have in mind when discussing this
  question.</p>

  <p>In those days we in the victorious allied countries were all ready to
  believe that the world was really recovering from the War and entering upon a
  phase of comparative freedom and hope. We did our best not to think too much
  about the state of affairs in Germany. Everybody was talking of
  reconstruction and rationalization, and it was possible to deal jestingly
  with things that have now become intolerably grim.</p>

  <p>The Zionist movement was the crowning expression of what I, in flat
  contradiction to Mr. Browne, hold to be the obdurate insistence of orthodox
  and semi-orthodox Jewry upon their peculiarity. In the years immediately
  following the war, there was a lull even in the normal persecutions in
  Eastern Europe to which the orthodox were subjected. They suffered indeed
  during the civil disorders that preceded the consolidation of the Bolshevik
  government; Whites, Reds and Greens were alike guilty of pogroms of varying
  degrees of virulence, and there was in consequence a certain exodus westward,
  but as the new law and order were established in Russia these outrages ceased
  and the process of rapid assimilation, to which reference has already been
  made, began. But already the champions of Judaism were advertising to the
  whole world how implacably they insisted upon their eternal essential
  foreignness. They had demanded a national home, so that elsewhere they could
  be forever foreigners. They might within limits accept the advantages of
  citizenship of the country they lived in, but essentially they would not
  belong. They would vote, hold office, rule, but always with Zion in their
  hearts. They ignored the manifest fact that the day of small sovereign states
  is drawing to an end, and that in a world of ever-growing violence, to plant
  themselves massively in any particular area was to invite a wholesale
  disaster.</p>

  <p>Today when the whole world is being subtly pervaded with anti-Jewish
  feeling, and when the restraints upon the predatory and persecuting impulses
  in the human animal are being rapidly weakened, these implacable nationalists
  are still conspicuously seeking suitable regions where they can go on being a
  people by themselves, where, pursuing an ancient and irrational ritual so far
  as it suits them, they can sustain a solidarity foreign and uncongenial to
  all the people about them.</p>

  <p>No country wants them on such conditions. Why should any country want
  these inassimilable aliens bent on preserving their distinctness? Palestine
  is an object lesson. Until they are prepared to assimilate and abandon the
  Chosen People idea altogether, their troubles are bound to intensify. No one
  can help them while even a die-hard minority&mdash;a minority that the
  general body of them does not disavow, a nucleus about which habit and
  association and sentiment gather very readily and to which it is easy for
  lost sheep to return&mdash;prefers these exasperating pretensions of a
  special right and claim to becoming frankly and of their own accord common
  citizens of the world.</p>

  <p>These are the elementary facts of the quandary to which the Chosen People
  have come, the more relentless dragging the doubters and half-hearted with
  them. They are facts that have to be stated, even though matters are now
  coming to a complexion which gives a flavor of ruthlessness to their bare
  statement.</p>

  <p>Because this obdurate separatism which, after all, except for the growing
  trouble in Palestine, has been hitherto more of an irritant than a downright
  evil, is now conspicuous and challenging just at a phase in human affairs
  when it is becoming extremely dangerous to be in any manner alien and
  provocative.</p>

  <p>In the last two paragraphs of &sect; 4, the essential facts of the present
  rapid dislocation of social order have been stated. Social disintegration is
  now a world-wide reality, it is a convulsive breaking-down everywhere of
  long-established systems of law and order, an almost cataclysmal
  dissolution. It is a process far vaster than this Jewish question we are
  discussing and it arises from causes that have no special connection with
  that trouble. But it catches up the Jewish question in its swirling eddies
  and spins it about so that its fluctuations become indicative of the
  character of the entire process.</p>

  <p>The Jewish question is already something very different from what it was a
  score of years ago when Zangwill championed and threw that glamor of racial
  romance and Maccabean heroism about the ancient ways. Those were tolerant
  days. At that time it was easy for people to fall away from the old
  observances if they chose and become Christians or unconforming skeptics.
  Now, and it is the most ominous aspect of the new phase, in many parts of the
  world the doors of escape from orthodox Jewry are being closed. These doors
  are not being closed from the inside; there i&pound; no way of closing them
  from the inside. They are being closed from the outside. Those who are
  disposed to apostasy are being turned back by the outer world. Nothing of
  this sort was happening twenty years ago. A number of people, and some of
  them are very sinister people indeed, are beginning to say, "You insisted
  upon being Jews. Jews you <i>shall</i> be."</p>

  <p>The operating causes in those wide alternations between social confidence,
  a sense of stability and a prevailing lawfulness and intolerance, and phases
  of insecurity, fear, dishonesty and general unrighteousness, which have
  manifestly occurred in the human story, have still to receive anything but
  the most casual attention from the historian. Those happier periods, when the
  social machine was running smoothly, when men were able to move about freely
  and almost fearlessly, work with a sense of fair reward, when there was
  something definite and reasonably satisfactory and hopeful for most of the
  young men to do, have been by far the less frequent and the least secure.
  Order and peace have been precarious always in the growing human societies of
  the last four or five thousand years. There have been constantly recurrent
  phases of mutual pressure, expansion and that dislocation without which
  readjustment is impossible. Then doubt and suspicion invade men's minds. They
  lose that feeling that they are being properly taken care of; there is no
  confidence that services will be rewarded or debts paid; mutual trust gives
  way to suspicion. Social behavior deteriorates. The strong and cunning no
  longer feel that the weak will be protected. The suspicious look for
  scapegoats to blame, for evil doers who have offended the gods, for
  conspirators. Particularly for conspirators.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note12c"><i>Note 12C</i></a> for <i>The
  Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>We do know and we have already stated in general terms the forces that
  have produced the particular phase of violent social disintegration that is
  going on today. They are world-wide and unprecedented. Socially they are more
  destructive than anything our species has ever faced before. The
  disintegrating changes in the social order of the past were probably due to
  much more localized and quite different influences: to unrecorded
  fluctuations in the relative welfare of classes, to the social shifting due
  to new economic processes, to the infiltration of foreign ideas and
  practices, to foreign pressure, to epidemics&mdash;no history can be complete
  without a proper study of the social sequelae of plague, the Black Death and
  the like&mdash;to sustained bad weather, drought for example, over a number
  of years, to a stimulating and disorganizing influx of gold such as happened
  after the discovery of America. These and a thousand other disturbing forces
  have been enough to tilt the always unstable and insecure social balance back
  to general distrust and convulsive, self-protective dishonesty. The adaptive
  culture fails. Things go to pieces, Man reverts to his more natural state of
  a fear-and-desire-driven beast.</p>

  <p>In the history of any social system such periods of disorganization
  display almost parallel phenomena of demoralized mass action. The strong are
  looking for the weak not only individually but collectively in order to
  gratify their craving for power, the crowd is seeking the furtive enemies of
  the state, the fearful are looking for the strange wickedness and secret
  mischiefs that have brought about the discomforts of the time. In such an
  atmosphere any marked kind of people are liable to set upon, are liable to be
  ringed about for victimization and punitive plunder.</p>

  <p>Such a convergence of hostility has by no means been confined to the Jews.
  The Albigenses, for example, in the south of France, had no very special
  relationship to the Jewish community. They were a Christian sect with certain
  heretical ideas derived by way of Bulgaria from the Gnostics and Manichaeans.
  They were charged, by their exterminators, to whom we owe most of the
  knowledge we have of their beliefs, with abnormal sexual practices. What is
  more certain is that they protested vigorously against the corruptions of the
  Church and were markedly anti-sacerdotal. They spread throughout Provence
  and prospered throughout the twelfth century. Their movement was in several
  respects an anticipation of the Protestant Reformation. Whereupon the Church
  invoked the harder, ruthless and more Catholic north, and preached a Crusade
  against them. Moral and religious indignation and the prospect of loot
  implemented their destruction. Here we cannot tell the tale of massacres,
  burnings alive&mdash;two hundred in one <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>&mdash;the
  sadistic terrorism and blackmail of the Holy Inquisition....</p>

  <p>The Armenians again are another much massacred, non-Jewish but distinctive
  people.</p>

  <p>But it is the Jews who have generally been the marked people throughout
  the realms of Christendom and Islam. They have generally "got it first." And
  repeatedly the door has been slammed upon Jews who have been seeking to get
  away or were actually getting away from the threats that darkened over
  them.</p>

  <p>Lewis Browne gives a compact and effective account of the fate of the
  Marranos in Spain and Portugal. He tells of the forcible baptism and
  conversion of the Jews in 1391 in the face of a storm of popular hostility.
  The government, because of their financial and administrative usefulness,
  opened a door of escape for them. They were given the choice between exile
  and massacre or Christianization. A great majority chose the latter, and
  since all the synagogues were closed and the practice of the Jewish law
  sedulously suppressed, within three or four generations most of these
  baptized Jews became just as good or better Catholics than their neighbors.
  This from the outset was a huge disappointment for those neighbors who had
  been whetting the knife, so to speak, for an orgy of murder and plunder. It
  seemed to them the meanest trick conceivable. They called these desperate
  converts the New Christians or more familiarly swine (=Marranos), and set as
  rigid a bar as possible on any intercourse with them. As Jews they had been
  "dogs" but now they were "swine." "Conversion indeed!" they said. "You don't
  get away with <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>In complete good faith the majority of the Marranos in the next generation
  or so were Catholics, "These hapless creatures," says Browne, "took no pride
  in their past. On the contrary they were through and through ashamed of it
  and groaned that it be forgotten." That did not help them in the least.
  Massacre and detailed persecution closed in on them. The tale is fully told
  in Mr. Cecil Roth's <i>History Of The Marranos</i>. It is a frightful story,
  but from the point of view of the present discussion it is almost the same
  story, Inquisition and all, as that of the Albigenses who were not Jews at
  all.</p>

  <p>An entirely parallel treatment has been meted out in the last decade to
  the Christian Jews in Germany. They have been herded back upon their orthodox
  brethren, in the same spirit and for the same reason that the Marranos were
  kept apart for destruction. We are witnessing now a swifter and vaster
  repetition of that Marrano tragedy.</p>

  <p>A time has come when a multitude of men and women of more than average
  intelligence, men and women who in reality have no essential racial
  difference from the average European, are finding themselves with no foothold
  whatever upon the earth, dispossessed and hunted from country to country,
  marooned in impossible regions, deprived of the normal protection of the law,
  beaten up by anyone who chooses to beat them up, outraged, tortured,
  sterilized, stripped of everything, ill-treated in every possible way. They
  seek escape from one country to another, and the countries where they would
  take refuge, suffering now from the fast-spreading economic and social
  malaise of this current phase in human history, are more and more chary of
  receiving them even as assimilable individuals. Everywhere employment is
  dislocated. Everywhere they encounter the protest: "We have our own
  unemployed!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note12d"><i>Note 12D</i></a> upon the
  refugee question.</p>

  <p>A great book, a book of victims with thousands of authenticated cases,
  could be filled already with the tale of forced suicides, murders and
  abominations done upon these refugees, and there is no reasonable prospect of
  surcease. From the narrower point of view the compilation might be called
  <i>The Jewish Book Of Martyrs</i>, but from another it could be entitled
  <i>The Natural Man</i>, because its broader interest lies in the clear
  demonstration of what the inherent brute in man can do when the grip of law
  and order relaxes. It is a horrible recrudescence of primordial human
  reactions, but that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the role of
  the alien nationalism of the Chosen People in exposing them first and
  foremost before any other people to this accumulating outbreak of hatred,
  cruelty, bestiality and every sort of human ugliness. They are the first to
  suffer in the social dissolution of our epoch, because they have stood 1 out
  most conspicuously. They are the most obvious "murderees" and "plunderees."
  They come first. But they are only the first....</p>

  <p>I have enlarged upon their case because it is not only conspicuously
  challenging at the present time but because it brings into the picture most
  of the elements of the present human situation, the general disposition of
  any established community to adhere to forms and traditions of living long
  after their survival value has disappeared, the normal blindness of human
  beings to the onset of novel and more exacting conditions until disaster
  actually supervenes, the swiftness with which social balance can now be
  overturned.</p>

  <p>I can see no other destiny for orthodox Judaism and those who are involved
  in its obloquy, unless that enormous effort to reconstruct human mentality
  for which I have been pleading arrives in time to arrest their march to
  destruction. That, if it is to save our species, must be a reconstruction so
  bold and wide, an amnesty so fundamental, that it will sweep the religion of
  the Chosen People and this age-long feud of Juif and anti-Juif out of the
  living interests of mankind altogether.*</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">&sect; 13. &mdash; CHRISTENDOM</a></h2>

  <p>FROM the tragedy of Judaism we must turn now to Christianity, that second
  and greater branch of the Bible tradition, which is the basis of contemporary
  Western civilization. The word Christianity has covered and still covers an
  immense variety of idea systems, but today it finds its most highly organized
  and active expression in the Roman Catholic Church. That too is a power
  transcending national and state boundaries and playing a distinctive part in
  molding human thought and destiny today.</p>

  <p>In certain respects Catholic Christianity is in diametric contrast to
  Judaism; in certain others the two cults run side by side. They have this in
  common that nearly everywhere they produce the feeling that they are alien
  cultures. They are apt to be suppressed by governments together, as in
  Hanoverian England and Hitlerian Germany, and to be emancipated together. But
  they differ fundamentally in the fact that while participation in Judaism
  after the early phase of eager proselytism became for many reasons difficult,
  Christianity from its beginning with Saint Paul (Acts xi, 26) onward has been
  a missionary religion, seeking and incorporating converts throughout the
  whole world.</p>

  <p>It not only incorporated converts but it incorporated ideas. It sprang
  from the Jewish sect of the Nazarenes, but in the course of the three
  centuries before its forcible stabilization by Constantine the Great in 325
  at the Council of Nicaea and the definitive formulation of its three creeds,
  the third-century Apostles Creed, the fourth-century Nicene Creed, so much
  more explicit about the Trinity, and the Athanasian (of uncertain date and
  authorship) which finally cleared up the Trinity business for good and all in
  a drumming storm of intolerant nonsense, it had practically become a
  synthesis of all the chief religious cults of that mentally festering
  age.</p>

  <p>The Catholic Church emerged from these formative centuries as an
  organization of very considerable tenacity, but intellectually it was already
  the most extraordinary jumble of absurdities and incompatibilities that has
  ever exercised and perplexed the human intelligence. It accumulated
  accretions like a caddis worm. Still&mdash;though now with more
  deliberation&mdash;it assimilates. At a very early stage it developed sexual
  obsessions unknown to its cognate Judaism. The Virgin Birth began to worry
  its usually celibate theologians. Jesus on one occasion (Matthew xx, 47-50)
  had very definitely denied any religious importance to his mother, but with
  the taking-over of Isis and the Infant Horus, as the Virgin and Child, this
  was disregarded. The Virgin became a divine queen, very beautiful and
  adorable. St. Ignatius Loyola, contemptuous of the earthly attractions he had
  found unsatisfactory, vowed himself her Knight, and believed there was a
  mutual devotion. That the intenser religious succumb very readily to the
  suggestions of such phrases as "The Bride of Christ," one can find ample
  evidence for in the vast literature of the Christian mystics. It became
  necessary to sublimate the Virgin, the attractive Queen of Heaven. She had to
  be made "sinless" and born without "sin." So the theologians excogitated a
  "sinless" begetting for her. It is difficult to tell these things without a
  touch of derision. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception emerged from
  their meditations. It was mainly a Spanish product, and there is a monument
  to the Immaculate Conception outside the Alcazar in Seville. It is perfectly
  decent; it is a grouping of the divines, thinkers and spiritual heroes, grave
  and dignified figures, who contributed to the perfection of this profound
  discovery. For centuries, however, this Immaculate Conception was not a
  matter of faith. It was made so by a bull of Pope Pius IX as recently as
  1854. There was a great assembly of bishops and dignitaries in Rome from all
  parts of the world, a great gathering of adult men robed very beautifully and
  carrying themselves very seriously. A happy sense of a great consummation
  pervaded them. And now all good Catholics must believe in the Immaculate
  Conception of the Virgin Mary, though what it is they think they are
  believing in I cannot imagine.</p>

  <p>And so, century by century, the great fabric of the faith goes on
  accumulating. It has become a sort of Cumberland Market of religious
  notions.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* For a frank Catholic admission of this, see <a href=
  "#note13A"><i>Note 13A</i></a></p>

  <p>There is something from everywhere in it and, wherein lies its chief
  attractiveness, something for everybody. No single mind can cover that mighty
  mental jumble sale in its entirety, so that anyone willing to be converted
  has no difficulty in ignoring the less congenial articles of the collection.
  You will, for example, find the sternest condemnation of socialism, no
  Catholic can be a Socialist, and then you will find that the author of the
  completest forecast of communism, commissars and all that, Sir Thomas More,
  has been canonized as a saint.</p>

  <p>The organization of the Church, with its confessional and its spiritual
  direction, facilitates this fragmentary approach to faith in every possible
  way. The convert is invited and trained to help in his own subjugation. He is
  implored to pray for light. He must bury his sense of humor. These, he is
  told, are serious matters. A hearty laugh at the metaphors of relationship in
  the triplex composition of the divinity would -shatter the whole process.
  Derision is the deadly enemy of Catholicism; it drives it to indignant
  persecution, indignant silence or indignant flight, according to the
  exigencies of the situation.</p>

  <p>Christianity picked up the Holy Trinity, it would seem, in the second
  century, and very manifestly from Alexandria. By that time Alexandria far
  more than Jerusalem had become the spiritual home of Christianity. Neither
  St. Paul nor Jesus insisted upon the fundamental importance of right views
  about the Mystery of the Trinity to their followers. To say the least of it,
  it was inconsiderate of them to leave it to the author of the Athanasian
  creed, centuries later, to formulate in terms of the now long-abandoned
  metaphysics of Alexandria, "The Catholic faith, which except a man believe
  faithfully he <i>cannot</i> be saved." Did Matthew know? Did Peter
  understand? It leaves one anxious about the ultimate fate even of St. Paul
  himself.</p>

  <p>Why do intelligent people accept this strange heap of mental corruption as
  a religion and a rule of life? That question will bring us back to that
  reorientation of the human mind, and that conflict between the actuality of
  the present and the accumulating reality of the future, to which I have
  devoted &sect; 9. They accept it because it is there before them and because
  it existed long before they did. They grew up to it and even if they were not
  actually born and bred Catholics, they saw it everywhere taken for granted
  and treated with respect, cathedrals and shrines, saints and martyrs, in art,
  in literature, in history, in the world about them. There is no reasoning in
  a stained-glass window, but there is an immense amount of conviction. To turn
  from the menaces of stark reality to established religion is to be
  immediately reassured. To turn from active, questioning minds to the company
  of the faithful is inexpressibly comforting. And with that you get
  prescription and direction for all the main issues of life. The Church, the
  faithful about one, a vast volume of literature and history, agree in saying:
  "Don't trouble. You are all right. Do as we do and all will be well." At
  times I have tried to imagine what such a natural born scoffer and rebel as
  Mr. Hilaire Belloc, whose mental processes have always interested and
  distressed me, thinks at Mass. But that is just when he suspends all
  thinking. <i>Credo quia absurdum</i>, I suspect is the note of it, a
  triumphant revolt against his own intelligence. He became a scoffer and rebel
  against liberalism and scientific revelation because he resented their
  compelling convincingness. Any fool, he felt, could believe that.</p>

  <p>And it is equally easy to understand the attraction of the Catholic Church
  to those outside but within the influence of the fold. They are already half
  converts. They "go over" without the slightest examination of the fundamental
  absurdities of the faith. Conviction comes after a discussion of the
  Apostolic Succession and the validity of the Protestant Orders. Such things
  are deliberated very gravely. With a sense of enhanced importance, the
  convert takes to fish on Fridays, is received, attends Mass, feels
  unutterable things. Unutterable even to himself. It is all so tremendously
  established. Quiescence, spiritual peace ensues. Until the anxiety of the
  times takes hold of these refugess from fact, they will not recognize the
  element or malignity in the activities of this great organization to which
  they, are clinging. Even then they will feel the utmost reluctance in leaving
  go. It is their last protection against that terrifying readjustment to
  creative reality, which would make them responsible adults in this world of
  limitless danger, limitless difficulty and limitless possibility.</p>

  <p>Fantastic, defiantly absurd as this vast pile of the Faith becomes to
  anyone who dares to go into it and question it fearlessly, it is far less
  fantastic than the actual organization of the Church. Its central control
  rests with a close corporation of priests, mainly Italians, the cardinals,
  who with scarcely a break have elected a continuity of Italian Popes for the
  last three centuries. Spiritually Italians must be a very superior
  people.</p>

  <p>In the Vatican, in entirely unveracious succession to St. Peter, sustained
  by a handsome subsidy from the Fascist government and the less reliable
  contributions of the faithful at large, the Holy Father, in the measure of
  his intelligence and the quality of his advisers, keeps his court and steers
  the Church through the pitfalls of this world. He has had the medieval
  education of a priest; his advisers have worn the mental blinkers of the
  devout, and just as far as they dare, they influence the political life of
  the world, according to their limitations and prejudices. In all the
  democracies the "Catholic vote" obeys the tortuous wisdom of these scheming
  old anachronisms. Here tyrannies are blessed and here revolts are fomented.
  The devout in France or Britain, for example, must support the Franco
  pronunciamento to the infinite injury of their own countries.</p>

  <p>Joseph McCabe in his <i>History Of The Popes</i> tells the story of the
  Papacy with a certain bitter accuracy and an ample citation of authorities.
  The Catholic reader will, I know, feel that my recommendation of that
  outspoken book is in the worst possible taste. But let me nevertheless urge
  it upon his attention. It will trouble his mind, but it will purge it. But if
  he asks his co-religionists questions about it, they will make him feel as if
  he were making rude noises.</p>

  <p>When we try to estimate the role the Church is now playing in mundane
  affairs we have to realize that on earth it has no definite objective at all.
  It is a vast, self-protective organization which seeks merely to exist and if
  possible spread. Its friends are those who support and serve it; its
  enemies&mdash;and its enmity has the unrelenting quality of an
  instinct&mdash;are those who have thwarted, controlled and suppressed it. It
  is against Soviet Russia, against every Protestant system, against every
  country which insists upon secular education; it is on the side of every
  government, however corrupt and evil, which attends Mass and makes the sign
  of the cross. Its real objectives, it alleges, lie in another world. In some
  strange existence outside time and space the reckoning will be made, and
  those who have swallowed the Athanasian metaphysics, taken the advice of
  their priests, and performed all their religious duties, will enjoy heaven,
  and those who have fallen short will pass to heaven through a state called
  purgatory or descend into hell forever, according to the enormity of their
  disrespect. Bolsheviks, I assume, will all go to hell.</p>

  <p>In the past it was the custom of the Church to suggest that the sufferings
  in hell and purgatory were essentially physical tortures, and simple folk
  were given pictures of the damned being burnt in flaming bowls, tormented by
  red-hot pincers, racked and maltreated very richly and variously. The state
  of bliss was less fully particularized. Nowadays one hears remarkably little
  of either the upper or lower aspect of the future state. Yet why is there no
  copious and attractive literature upon the subject? Why are there no
  speculative anticipations? Why have Catholic poets recoiled? It should be a
  most fascinating preoccupation to imagine that unearthly loveliness ahead.
  There are not even impostors to offer us dreams and visions. No one has ever
  produced a plausible page from a celestial Baedeker. Even Bunyan's
  <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> stops short at the gates of the Celestial City. We
  are left to imagine "these endless Sabbaths the blessed ones see." There is
  the Book of Revelation indeed, but who except cranks and lunatics reads the
  Book of Revelation? And that, after all, is symbolic prophecy and not to be
  mistaken for a picture of reality. The fact of it is that the majority of
  Christians are not even reasonably curious about the future life, and they
  are not curious because they have no more positive belief in it than I have.
  They are Christians because it is the most convenient and agreeable pattern
  of life for them, and for no other reason whatever.</p>

  <p>And yet the Church is something more than a picturesque and reassuring
  frame for an everyday mode of living. It provides that, just as it provides
  dispensations, annulments of marriages for the wealthy, titles, blessings,
  missions, festivals and displays, but such things are by the way. It exists
  primarily for itself. It is always anticipating and warding off dangers and
  occasionally it counter-attacks. There is an incessancy in its
  self-preserving activities, and in this present phase of world crisis it is
  encouraging much partisan activity.</p>

  <p>There comes to hand as I write a book, <i>Crisis For Christianity</i> by
  William Teeling, which summarizes very clearly the ideas of a Catholic
  reaction and recovery that are stirring the imaginations of the more active
  faithful I do not know who William Teeling is. His title page supplies no
  information beyond his bare name; he has written at least one other book,
  <i>The Pope In Politics</i>; but he seems to have met and discussed affairs
  with most of the leading Catholics in Europe; and I understand that that very
  peculiar body, the British Council, which spends &pound;100,000 a year in
  endearing England to foreigners by sending them carefully chosen, if
  occasionally highly unrepresentative, samples of British thought and behavior
  to lecture and talk to them, has availed itself of his services. So that his
  book gives us not only the present Catholic outlook, but one at least of the
  many faces the now highly diplomatic and incalculable British Empire turns to
  the world.</p>

  <p>The first thing to remark about this book is that it completely ignores
  the existence of any modern, scientific picture of the world. So far as I am
  able to judge, this is a real and not a deliberate ignorance. Mr. Teeling was
  probably educated in a Catholic atmosphere from which such knowledge is
  excluded. He seems to have no idea of the Good Life except in what survives
  today of Christendom, <i>White</i> Christianity that is to say, finding its
  completest embodiment in the Roman Catholic Church. Regardless of the foreign
  missions, he fears that Christ may "desert Europe" and leave it "to be
  completely overrun by the Yellow Races or the Black or the Communists and to
  pass through horrors undreamt of even today." The most Christian countries of
  Europe now, he says, are "Franco's Spain, Catholic Belgium and God-fearing
  Britain." Mrs. Nesta Webster, to whose mentality I have devoted a Note at the
  end of this book (<i>Note 12c</i>), could not have a livelier horror of Jews
  and Russia. Outside the Christian pale there is one single movement to which
  he turns with a certain hope and kindliness, and there I think he is probably
  giving us a fair reflection of the Vatican-centered mentality. He has met and
  discussed matters, it is to be noted, with the present Pope. He seems to be a
  fair sample of how Catholics think.</p>

  <p>He writes: "No matter what we may think of the Nazi leaders, or the
  methods they employ, they are at least instilling into the nation as a whole,
  and not only into those who might be their willing converts in a free
  country, a desire to help the maimed, to support one's neighbors, to work and
  live clearly, such as no democratic country is able to show. The democratic
  governments pay only lip service to much that is Christian, and they scarcely
  ever try to enforce it, while the Trade Unions and other socialist groups in
  this country" (i.e., Britain) "encourage, as indeed do some of the
  less-thoughtful Conservative die-hards, a form of class warfare which
  Christianity can never tolerate.</p>

  <p>"My own feelings are all in favor of a free democracy giving the
  opportunity to lead a Christian life, seeing that a willing Christian is
  worth more to God than an unwilling one. But if the democrats do not respond,
  and under the cloak of freedom carry on a most un-Christian life, can we
  expect that God should favor them, rather than a disciplined body that at
  least is practicing some of the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount?"</p>

  <p>That is how the Church wishes to see the Nazis today. Our exponent ignores
  the implacable resolution with which the education of the young is being
  wrested from the Catholic teachers in favor of Wotan, and the bulk of this
  edifying book is a discussion of the possibilities of a sympathetic swamping
  of this Nazi movement by the incorporation of more and more Catholics into
  the Reich so that at last it will be possible to chip off the flapping ends
  of the swastika and restore the cross. It is all set out very attractively.
  The curious reader can learn how Dollfuss on "Great Catholic Day" (Sept.
  11th, 1933) inaugurated the first German Corporative Christian State, and
  less explicitly how he stamped down socialism and labor. It was Dollfuss who
  betrayed and destroyed the radical republic that had ruled in Austria from
  the end of the War. It was he who stood behind Major Fey's smashing-up of the
  workmen's dwellings that had been the pride of the socialist regime in Vienna
  (Feb. 1934). This was not only a frankly uncivilized act but a piece of
  political folly.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* John Gunther's <i>Inside Europe</i> is particularly
  good on this.</p>

  <p>It left him face to face with the Nazis. They assassinated him in July
  1934, but the Catholic Corporative movement went on less confidently under
  Schuschnigg, until the forcible realization of the Anschluss in 1938 by the
  Nazi army made Austria an integral part of the Reich.</p>

  <p>Ultimately Mr. Teeling thinks Nazi Germany will have an indigestion of
  Catholics. That is his hope. Large parts of Bavaria, Baden and possibly
  Wurttemberg and the Rhine-land, are to break away and join up with Austria.
  Communism may gain control in Italy&mdash;Mr. Teeling throws that out quite
  abruptly and gives no reason for his assumption&mdash;and then the Vatican
  will have to make Vienna its headquarters, Nazism and Fascism will be at a
  discount, and the Authoritarian State, founded on the suggestions of the
  Papal Encyclical <i>Quadragesima Anno</i> (Pius XI, 1931) for a corporative
  society will be installed in Vienna, with the Emperor Otto at its head and
  the Pope near by.</p>

  <p>There you have the sort of thing the energetic young Catholics of today
  can imagine; the sort of thing the present "God-fearing" British government
  is unobtrusively subsidizing and spreading about, to the ultimate confusion
  of all Jews, atheists, men of science, Bolsheviks, Russians (but see the
  <i>Note 12c</i> on Mrs. Nesta Webster.)...</p>

  <p>So much for the Catholic contribution to human adjustment today.</p>

  <p>We are too apt to forget the narrow educational limitations of those who
  figure as wise, unquestionable leaders of men. Everywhere that applies, we
  live in a medley of ignorant systems, but it is the Catholic culture I am now
  discussing. It is a common tendency in our minds to believe that what we know
  clearly is also known clearly to other people. We are all too apt to believe
  that these dignified directors of human consciences know and understand the
  body of modern knowledge, that they have studied, judged it and rejected
  it.</p>

  <p>But these Catholic prelates, so imposing in their triple crowns and miters
  and epicene garments, are in fact extremely ignorant men, not only by virtue
  of the narrow specialization of their initial education, but also by the
  incessant activities of service and ceremony that have occupied them since.
  They can have read few books, they can have had no opportunities of thinking
  freely. They are not nearly the cynical rogues so many non-Catholics think
  them; most of them are trying most earnestly to do right by the dim and
  dwindling oil-lamps inside their brains. They are quite ready to believe Mr.
  Belloc when he tells them, with that buoyant assurance of his, that Darwin
  was inspired by the ambition to abolish God in the universe. That fits in
  completely with their prepossessions. Why should they seek further? Mentally
  they live in another universe from ours, and the pity is that materially our
  universes intersect.</p>

  <p>The slovenly, unorganized, intellectual world in which we and they live
  together, gives them no opportunity of grasping modern ideas without an
  impossible expenditure of perplexing inquiry. And to set against that we must
  remember that their world of theological elaborations remains an unmapped
  jungle to the unbeliever. They may have something to say to us but we are
  quite unable to get it, and conversely. The mind of mankind is still like a
  scattered jigsaw puzzle, bits of knowledge here and bits of knowledge there
  and no common pattern visible. And until we have something in the nature of
  that permanent world encyclopaedia I have tried to foreshadow, so matters
  must remain. That revival of the Holy Roman Empire under the Emperor Otto,
  which strikes a realistic modern intelligence as fantastically absurd,
  presents itself to the Vatican intelligence in the guise of sober and subtle
  statecraft.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary for us to wait for the return of the Holy Roman Empire
  to appreciate the nature of the Roman Catholic Christian State. In Eire
  (formerly Southern Ireland) and in Spain, the Church rules and we can watch
  it in operation. Franco's Spain is still too busy cleaning up the Republican
  Opposition, by shootings, expulsions and proscriptions, to develop the
  Christian life in its complete beauty, but in Ireland, Catholicism has been
  in control for some years.</p>

  <p>A stringent censorship of books and publications and a fairly complete
  control of education have produced a first crop of young men, as blankly
  ignorant of  the modern world as though they had been born in the thirteenth
  century, mentally concentrated upon the idea of bringing the Protestant North
  under Catholic control in the sacred name of national unity. That tension of
  the young men to which so much social disturbance is due seems to be
  increasing. There has been a steady flow of emigrants to Great Britain, and
  recently there have been a number of bomb outrages designed to terrorize the
  British government into an abandonment of Northern Ireland. These patriotic
  zealots set about their business in a vein of pious devotion. They take Mass
  and purify their souls by confession&mdash;of everything but -the particular
  enterprise they have in hand. And if the British police deal sternly with
  these foolish, misguided youngsters, all Catholic Ireland will set up a.great
  outcry, possibly with more and better bombing, to avenge or release this new
  crop of national martyrs.</p>

  <p>The future of Ireland is incalculable. Hopeful Irishmen abroad have
  indulged in dreams of a restless and independent-minded people tiring of
  priests, piety and patriotism and returning presently as an animating
  influence to world civilization. But how can these young men get the idea of
  that? We may perhaps find sounder intimations of Ireland's future in the
  experiences of the Catholic South American States. A people which learns
  little forgets nothing, and the Church in Eire may be trusted to see to it
  that the young men of Ireland learn little and so sustain their tradition
  that inveterate animosities are dignified and desirable. The probabilities
  seem to point to murderous faction fighting, with Northern Ireland and
  England always to fall back upon in phases of comparative unity. There is a
  close temperamental kinship between the Irish and the Spanish, and the
  history of South America has already produced a series of bosses and
  pronunciamentos, vindictive massacres and pitiless wars.</p>

  <p>Never has there been such heroic, cruel, senseless warfare as those little
  Christian hells in South America have known. Paraguay under Solano Lopez
  fought on until its population was reduced from 1,300,000 to under a quarter
  of a million. Regiments were made up of boys between twelve and fifteen, and
  women were enrolled to carry ammunition and stores. When these women could
  keep up no longer, they were either left to die by the roadside or, i&pound;
  there was any chance of their falling into the enemy's hands and yielding
  information, butchered out of hand. No doubt many a wretched young conscript
  rebelled against his lot, but what could he do? He might hope for a change of
  leaders. He had no other ideas. It was impossible for him to have other
  ideas.</p>

  <p>The Roman Catholic Church, that clumsy system of frustrations, that
  strange compendium of ancient traditions and habit systems, since it lies in
  the closest entanglement with the intellectual life of the Western world and
  still holds many millions in its grip, is certainly the most formidable
  single antagonist in the way of human readjustment to the dangers and
  frustration that now close in upon us all.</p>

  The Roman Catholic Church is the most highly organized and efficient
  embodiment of Christian teaching, the Orthodox Churches of Greece, Serbia,
  Russia and the like are relatively negligible systems of ceremony and
  superstition, the British Imperial culture it will be more convenient to
  consider later, and the next group of world forces to which we must direct
  our attention is the Protestantisms, that series of movements and
  organizations which has arisen through the incapacity or unwillingness of
  people to accept this or that outstanding incredibility of the Catholic
  faith.</p>

  <p>They protested. But for the most part they did not protest outright
  against the ensemble of Church beliefs. That would have been too awful for
  them. The earlier reaction was to discover some incompatibility between the
  Bible and the practice and teaching of the Church. The courage of the
  Protestant has grown by degrees. None of these earlier doubters were capable
  of facing, even in their secret hearts, the terrific isolation of denying
  Christianity. Such a denial was almost unthinkable in Christendom for those
  born within the pale, and they did not think it. For reasons we made plain in
  the preceding section, when we asked why it is that fairly well-educated
  people cannot merely remain but become Roman Catholics, these early
  dissentients clung quite desperately to the assertion of their essential
  orthodoxy.</p>

  <p>A convergence of mechanical inventions occurred in the sixteenth century
  to strengthen the Book against the priest; paper in sheets of a uniform size
  replaced parchment, and the rapid multiplication of books by printing from
  movable type became possible. Suddenly Europe was sprayed with Bibles and
  vernacular translations of the Bible, and the Church found itself assailed by
  a variety of new Protestantisms that steadily gathered strength and
  enterprise. Men brooded dubiously over the inspired word. All the Protestants
  began as "reformers," and their original protests were the distressful cries
  of honest men, who were&mdash;as I have noted in an earlier
  section&mdash;usually priests.</p>

  <p>But though the Church monopolized education, ruled men's minds, sanctioned
  and condemned conduct, adjudicated on political claims, preached crusades,
  excommunicated, put states under interdicts, and held an ever increasing
  accumulation of land and wealth, it had never secured a physical grip upon
  the secular arm. It trusted for obedience to the spiritual fears it could
  arouse and the civil inconveniences it could cause. It could turn state
  against state and subjects against their rulers. It could dissolve
  allegiances. In an illiterate world this gave it an effective security. Many
  monarchs and princes lived in a 'state of uneasy resentment against the
  restrictions imposed upon their conduct. There was a continual struggle going
  on over such things as the appointment of bishops, the restriction of gifts
  and bequests to the Church, the taxation of its accumulating property. These
  lords and princes struggled and lived and died, but the Church had a massive
  continuity. Sooner or later it recovered its concessions and advanced to
  further aggrandizements. So long, that is, as its moral power, its grip upon
  the minds and consciences of the people, remained.</p>

  <p>It could bluff its way through many scandals and abuses so long as faith
  was unimpaired. But these honest doubters and critics, with their arguments
  and proofs, gave a novel strength to the recalcitrance of the princes.
  Before, they had been recalcitrant like naughty boys, there had been fear and
  the possibility of repentance behind their outrages, but now they began to
  behave like youths growing up and discovering flaws and weaknesses in the
  character of the governess that hitherto even in their disobedience they had
  respected. They seized very gladly upon this new destructive criticism of the
  doctrines of the Church. They gave the reformers their protection and ample
  opportunity to spread their doctrines. So that a thinly concealed desire for
  autonomy and the confiscation of the vast estates of the Church, mingled very
  remarkably with honest protestations in the Protestant Reformation.</p>

  <p>All this is a matter of history. We need not recapitulate the process by
  which the new Protestant States that detached themselves from Rome sought
  first to utilize and then to limit this process of protesting and
  questioning, of which they had made such good use, by setting up
  government-controlled Established Churches. Nor need we do more than glance
  at the way in which Peter the Great took a leaf from the English
  Establishment and applied the same process of nationalization to the Orthodox
  Church in Russia. These Protestant State Churches play a diminishing role in
  the present drama of human affairs. What is of greater interest for the
  purposes of our present inquiry is the inability of any of these
  would-be-religious settlements, as reading, writing and controversy spread,
  to arrest the progressive release of the human intelligence.</p>

  <p>The implementing of the Bible by printing had two divergent results. The
  most conspicuous at first was a definite return towards the spirit of Old
  Testament Judaism. The Old Testament is the larger, more various and
  intriguing part of the Word. One theme in it, which appealed more to the
  reformers and thoughtful subjects generally than to the princes, was the
  Calvinistic theme, the assertion of a stern Theocracy, the rebuking and
  warning of kings by prophets, a republicanism under God. The other,
  politically more agreeable to the established rulers, attached less
  importance to predestination and more to the good works that came naturally
  from the Christian monarch. According to the former doctrine he might fail to
  be one of the elect and be denounced and disobeyed in this life and damned
  forever in the next, however amiable his behavior. According to the Lutheran
  alternative he justified himself by the inevitable rightness of his
  works.</p>

  <p>Here we cannot enlarge on these attempts to adjust the new Bible
  Christianity to the needs of that period. But one very natural mental twist
  may be noted, and that was the widespread disposition of the Protestant
  Christians to identify themselves with the Chosen People, either mystically
  or physically. It would need a small encyclopaedia to recapitulate the
  writers, movements and societies that have sought to prove some magical
  migration of the "Lost Ten Tribes" to Western Europe. There are British
  Israelites of that persuasion today. Such a jungle of absurdities it is, as
  could only flourish in an ill-instructed world. But one curious variant upon
  this craving to be an elite with specific divine favor we shall have to
  consider when we come to estimate the value of the Nazi movement in the
  complication of human destiny....</p>

  <p>The reversion of large parts of Christendom to Bibliolatry and the Chosen
  People idea was however only the first and most immediate result of the
  invention of printed books. Many accepted the authority and read and
  believed. But some read and thought and compared as they read. Gathering
  momentum more slowly was a new skepticism, which began to question the
  divinity of the Bible itself.</p>

  <p>The doctrine of the Trinity was on the whole one of the less fortunate
  acquisitions of the Catholic Church. It has always given trouble from the
  days of the Arian heresy onward. It gave Charlemagne an excuse for breaking
  with Greek orthodoxy on the profoundly important point whether the Holy Ghost
  proceeds from the Father only or from the Father and the Son. Arian and
  Trinitarian, Latin and Greek&mdash;the history of their wars was written in
  the blood of millions. With the increase of questioning in Christendom, that
  triplex divinity began presently not merely to untwist but to lose its second
  and third strands altogether.</p>

  <p>Men dared presently to call themselves Unitarian, bowing politely but
  distantly to the Biblical record.</p>

  <p>Then came another step. A fashion of skepticism spread among the European
  nobility and gentry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; bold spirits
  encouraged each other to the pitch of doubting and ridiculing the Bible
  altogether. They became naughtily wicked about it. They were deists. There
  were soon enough of them to live in easy understanding with each other.
  Voltaire and Gibbon typify their quality. But atheism still remained a rather
  shocking extravagance. Only temerarious individuals professed so extreme a
  lack of belief, and usually it was associated with defiant blasphemies and a
  general pretension to extreme depravity. By this note of defiance in their
  excesses, these eighteenth-century atheists betrayed a lingering belief in
  the God they had denied. It was the ideas of God and good not only in the
  world about them but in themselves that they fought down.</p>

  <p>The bright young people who gathered about Sir Francis Dashwood at
  Medmenham Priory set out to be terrible fellows with their Hell Fire Club and
  their Black Masses, but how could one get the slightest thrill out of a Black
  Mass unless one had a lingering awe of the Mass itself? Without that much
  belief a Black Mass is an inane burlesque of nothing in particular.</p>

  <p>It is only in our own time that Protestantism, the progressive etching
  away of belief by inquiry, has reached its natural finality in complete,
  untroubled disbelief in superhuman authority. Even now many atheists
  prevaricate. If the word "God" means anything at all, it means a powerful
  being sufficiently anthropomorphic to have reciprocal relations with the
  individual man. A God who is not a personality is a contradiction in terms.
  But because of the ribald and ungenteel associations of the word "atheist," a
  great number of atheistic thinkers and teachers and writers have clung
  ambiguously to the entirely deflated name of "God." God, they say, is -the
  Absolute, he is a force not ourselves making for righteousness, he is the
  whisper of conscience, he is the brainless Thinker responsible for the
  mathematical order of the world, he is immanence. These are mere subterfuges,
  God-shaped vacuums.</p>

  <p>A sort of theism in effect, a theistic feeling at the beginning of life,
  may be as innate as suckling. The natural and necessary disposition of all
  immature creatures to believe they are being taken care of, survives and will
  no doubt survive always. Even if they do not think in theistic terms they
  will still believe in protection. And throughout the Western world, in
  Christendom and Islam and Israel, children will be constantly hearing talk of
  God, so that a father-like divinity becomes the form of this basic feeling.
  Until a mind is fully adult, it finds great comfort in that ancient
  personification of a natural but transitory need. And there is still a
  disposition on the part of unbelieving parents and of teachers who should
  know better to utilize this craving for dependence in the moral training of
  their children. Most educational psychologists are convinced that it gives a
  better result in behavior to teach children that the right thing should be
  done, not because of an all-seeing eye or a loving Father in Heaven, but
  because it is simply just that&mdash;the right thing to do. Innumerable
  Confucians and Buddhists have lived noble and beautiful lives without the
  assistance of an unseen Inspector.</p>

  <p>Protestantism carried on to its end is a complete acceptance of the
  limitless, impartial and continually more wonderful universe that scientific
  inquiry is illuminating for us; that is to say, it culminates in atheism
  without qualification. Its final stage is a world of grown men, free from
  superstitious fear and free equally from belief in any guidance of the world
  that can relieve them from responsibility for the shortcomings and failures
  of our race.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">&sect; 15. &mdash; THE NAZI RELIGION</a></h2>

  <p>WE come now to the Nazi movement, which is, in its possibilities of
  destruction, the most urgent challenge the human mind and will have ever had
  to face. Nazi Germany may well bring down conclusive disaster on our species.
  Yet its intellectual content is naive, and its sudden extreme importance the
  result of a convergence of accidents. A people almost stupidly warlike, led
  by a maniac, threatens the world and holds in its hands all the exaggerated
  powers of destruction modern science and invention have created.</p>

  <p>It is plain that the Fuehrer is insane; he shows all the symptoms of a
  recognized form of sex mania, the jealous fear and hate of the great raping
  black man&mdash;who in his case becomes the Jew. Since in his case his
  obsession endangers the lives of people about him, he should be certified and
  put under restraint. But insanity has its advantages as well as its
  handicaps. It involves an abnormal concentration of purpose and nervous
  energy. In its phase of mania it abolishes or at least defers fatigue and
  sustains long spells of sleepless vigilance and penetrating distrust far
  beyond the compass of the normal man. These qualities alone never made any
  man the leader of a mighty nation. Hitler's insanity would have had little
  effect upon the world if it had not slotted very easily into certain
  essential needs of the German situation. But for that he might be shouting,
  frothing and orating in a madhouse at the present time. But it happened that
  he supplied just the inflexible spearhead, the inhuman pertinacity, required
  to give extreme expression to the feelings of a humiliated and outrageously
  treated people.</p>

  <p>The Nazi movement, or something essentially like it, was inevitable. Had
  there been no Hitler, or were Hitler to vanish tomorrow, Germany would still
  be the problem sister among the European states, the embittered and crazy
  sister clutching the high explosive bomb.</p>

  <p>The Nazi movement was inevitable because she had a greater surplus of
  young people without reasonable hope of life than any other country in the
  world. They had no colonies to go to, no great business enterprises to
  develop; no employment of any sort. There you have the primary condition for
  a desperate outbreak. If you want the state of mind of pre-Nazi Germany
  compactly rendered, read Hans Fallada's <i>Little Man, What Now?</i> That
  post-war generation grew up to explode and it has exploded. What else could
  have happened?</p>

  <p>In &sect; 12 the conditions under which social order may degenerate into
  phases of suspicion, persecution, and plunder have been discussed. Post-war
  Germany displayed these conditions to an exaggerated degree. A new regime
  should have its own new education to explain itself to the community, but the
  staggering liberal Republican Germany of the twenties carried on without any
  revolution in its schools and colleges. They had become a great means of
  patriotic consolidation under the Hohenzollern regime, they had been purged
  and vetted for a third of a century to that end, and now they were hard at
  work establishing in the minds of a new generation the innocence of Germany
  for the war and the conviction that she had never been defeated; she had been
  cheated and betrayed. She was suffering bitterly through no fault of her own.
  The teachers mined the democratic republic. Everything was ripe for an
  outbreak of hysterical patriotism and a great pogrom before Hitler became of
  the slightest importance.</p>

  <p>And here another factor in the mentality of that dominating section of the
  German peoples which we may call Nordic-conscious came into play. Much of it
  was only less anti-Catholic than it was anti-Jewish. Its mentality had been
  framed upon the Lutheran interpretation of the Bible, and with a certain
  acceptable reversal it was possible to apply the conception of a Chosen
  People to the Germanic world. The Nazis took that over in one magnificent
  plagiarism. The Slav Prussians, the Alpine Bavarians, the melange of Gothic
  and Celtic peoples in the Rhineland, discovered that they were one single,
  pure race of beautiful blonds. They saw through their mirrors to the inner
  truth of themselves. They knew that in spite of appearances they had lovely,
  pure, blond souls. They turned upon the Jews and all foreigners with the
  completest paraphrase of the old Bible nationalism. And, wiser in their
  generation than the post-war liberal Republic, they have seized upon the
  schools and universities, and are doing their best to mold the mentality of
  the entire Reich to this fundamentally Biblical idea of a militant Chosen
  People&mdash;Germanized.</p>

  <p>Explicitly the new teaching retranslates Jehovah as Wotan, the old
  Kaiser's <i>unser alter Gott</i> and flouts the most elementary concepts of
  Christianity. But it is impossible to estimate with what consistency this new
  religion of heroic combat is being imposed upon the youth of the Reich.
  Variations in statement may set the brighter ones thinking. All the books
  have not been burnt. We do not know how much of social democracy remains
  beneath the Nazified surface. We do not know how much counter-propaganda is
  going on in the outwardly submissive and still tolerated Protestant and Roman
  Catholic congregations.</p>

  <p>I have cited Mr. William Teeling to show the Roman Catholic expectation of
  a German return to the faith, but I doubt whether he fully realizes the
  relentless vigor of the educational drive of the new religion. In Austria
  just as much as in Germany they are turning the children against parent and
  priest. Mr. Teeling, I think, counts his Catholics before they are hatched.
  He would be wiser to count them after they are educated. The complete
  de-Christianization of the entire Reich, of southern as of northern Germany,
  is, I think, the greater probability.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <i>School For Barbarians</i> by Erika Mann
  (1939).</p>

  <p>But that involves no release of German thought; it is only a relapse into
  organized, relentless barbarism. Science in Germany has been silenced
  completely. There is no free scientific opinion any more. What remains of
  German science is enslaved to produce either secret discoveries of military
  importance or sustain the crazy ethnology of race superiority. But if
  research in non-German countries is forced, barbarism for barbarism, to adopt
  a reciprocal protective secrecy, it may not be long before Germany realizes a
  decline in her technical efficiency. She may cease to make discoveries
  herself and she may be able no longer to borrow them from abroad and develop
  them for her own purposes. This may move her to some loosening of the gag on
  her laboratories and an attempt to re-open communications with the alien
  world outside. And that again may undermine that still very unstable
  Wotan.</p>

  <p>The problem of what will happen in Germany is the major problem of our
  immediate future. If the Nazi process continues upon its present lines, then
  all die world must be given over to the .servitude of war preparation, at
  least until Nazi Germany ceases to exist. So far, Germany has conquered the
  earth already. The demonstration of the impossibility of independent
  sovereign states under modern conditions is complete. This finishes it. The
  declared Nazi objective is to create a unanimous, belligerent Germany, a
  bloodthirsty nation, entirely tough and ruthless, resolved to use any weapons
  and any methods, however monstrous and destructive, in its march to world
  dominion. It will fight and conquer, or blow the world to pieces.</p>

  <p>How will that drive to destruction end? It is possible but highly
  improbable that this desperate adventure may succeed, and the whole world, or
  what is left of it, may cower at last at the feet of Wotan's Chosen People,
  its masters. Or that after a world storm of war, more horrible than any war
  has ever been, Germany may be defeated and stamped out by victors become at
  last as ruthless as their enemies. Or as a third possibility; something may
  occur within Germany to shake the Nazi solidarity. Many accidents are
  possible. Mental forces at present unrevealed may appear. All German thought
  is not in concentration camps. Individuals may die, new groupings may occur,
  resolution may falter at the eleventh hour. Every month that this tension
  endures without an actual explosion, the search for escape from</p>

  <p>Armageddon will become more intelligent both within and without Germany.
  The magnitude of the still impending danger will help more and more people to
  realize the magnitude of the reconstruction needed to restore safety and hope
  to mankind. Which means, <i>inter alia</i>, restoring security, hope and
  ample scope for energetic activities, to the stifled youth of
  Germany&mdash;from whose exploited frustrations all this trouble has
  arisen.</p>

  <p>Before we leave this vital question of the German outlook, it may be well
  to note one sinister possibility in contemporary thought. Because of the
  peculiar filthiness and malignity of the Nazi concentration camps, because of
  the sheer horror of the stories told by the more or less broken creatures who
  have escaped from them, there is a widespread disposition to assert that
  Germans are particularly cruel; that they are indeed a specially
  evil-spirited variety of human being. Old stories of atrocities are being
  revived. Now this is to concede the Nazi claims to be a unique people. We
  cannot have it both ways, and, if we argue, as we have done in the preceding
  sections, that the Germans are not the pure blond Chosen People they imagine
  themselves to be, but a melange of Slav, Celtic, Gothic and Alpine elements
  with only a language to bind .them together, then we cannot also entertain
  this idea of a specific sadistic streak in Germans.</p>

  <p>Yet when we compare the evidence of those who have been interned in
  various countries, we find a general agreement in one respect, in regard to
  the attitude of the minor officials towards the prisoners, which at the first
  glance does seem to justify this particular charge against the Germans. There
  is a consensus of evidence by those who have been there, that in British and
  Russian prisons the attitude of the guard, the warder, the turnkey and so
  forth is generally sympathetic to his charges. Fellow feeling is his quality.
  He regrets his instructions and does his best to mitigate them. At times he
  may lose his temper or dislike and bully someone, but that is an individual
  lapse. But his German equivalent, there is no doubt of it, does his tortures
  with zest, hates his charges as though they were loathsome animals, and is
  ingenious in devising new pains and abasements and suffering for them. It is
  important that we should make up our minds about the real nature of this
  difference. If it is innate, then biologically it would be an excellent thing
  to kill all Germans.</p>

  <p>But most of us who have known and seen Germans intimately have found them
  as humane and helpful as most people. They are generally more law-abiding
  than the Irish or the English. They like to be relieved of the dangers and
  troubles of responsibility by explicit directions. That may be a habit of
  mind due to a persuasion that this is a dangerous world with which it is
  unwise to take liberties, and it is quite compatible with these cruelties.
  The position of the Germans in Central Europe has always exposed them to an
  exceptional imminence of warfare. The country has been overrun time after
  time by alien armies. Plunder and rapine have flowed over the land. The
  German-speakers lived for the most part in a great plain, they had no
  mountains in which they could hide. It was only by screwing themselves up to
  fighting pitch and facing all comers, that the divided German states were
  able to maintain themselves at all. They were called upon by their
  circumstances to be tougher fighters than any other Europeans.</p>

  <p>Toughness therefore is as much in the German tradition as it was, for
  other reasons, in the Spartan. They had to despise fear and pain in
  themselves, and that for most human beings means despising fear and pain in
  others. The Nazi is not a born tough. If he were changed at birth and put
  among gentle, fearless people, he would not be a tough at all He is a being
  innately as gentle as you and I, only he is inspired by an hysterical desire
  to be utterly tough. He refuses to give way to the horror of other people's
  torments, because from doing that it is only a step to giving way to pain and
  fear himself. And, attacking his own shrinking and disgust, he goes out of
  his way in a sort of desperation, to devise and inflict ruthless, disgusting
  and intolerable things on the recalcitrants, the evil-doers, the detected
  conspirators&mdash;and we must remember that he has been made to believe them
  that&mdash;committed to him for reformation. Deliberate cruelty is not a
  characteristic of limitless strength. Great strength may be heedless and
  unconsciously cruel, but not ingeniously and appreciatively cruel. It would
  get no thrill out of it. That is reserved for men and women who are inwardly
  afraid. It is sensitive people who seek to sustain and fix themselves by
  outrages.</p>

  <p>Here it would take us too far from our main argument to examine other
  cases of torture and cruelty, the abominations done by Red Indian and Arab
  women for example, after battles. There is indeed no people on earth against
  whom some phase of cruelty cannot be brought. The English assume themselves
  to be a particularly gentle people, and with some truth now. Yet consider the
  cockshies and bear- and bull-baiting that delighted their ancestors in the
  past and the extreme savagery of the penal laws at the end of the eighteenth
  century. There is a strain of cruelty, suppressed or overt, in every human
  being. It is inseparable from self-assertion and the craving to exercise
  power....</p>

  <p>But enough has been said to qualify this charge of a special German
  cruelty. Those concentration camps must be forgotten if ever Germany comes to
  judgment. Vindictive reprisals may be part of the behavior pattern of a
  patriotic Irish Catholic who knows no better, but not of a civilized man. Let
  the dead past bury its grievances. They can have no part in the rational
  reconstruction of human life....</p>

  <p>And here, apt to my argument, comes confirmation. Since I wrote the above
  I have had a talk with a man who has been in a German concentration camp, and
  he told me of how an official, instructed to give him, for no particular
  reason, thirty lashes, fell into conversation with him after the second
  stroke, found out that he had been the editor of an illustrated paper he
  liked, sat talking journalism, omitted the rest of the prescribed beating,
  saying only, "I suppose your friend here won't give us away," quite after the
  Russian or English pattern. The friend was trustworthy. All fellow-prisoners
  are not trustworthy. One of the minor vilenesses of Dachau is that prisoners
  are bribed by petty indulgences and payments to report small relaxations of
  discipline. And many are in such physical misery, craving to smoke, craving
  for taste of sweetness, that they do.*</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">&sect; 16. &mdash; TOTALITARIANISM</a></h2>

  <p>TOTALITARIANISM is no new thing in the Western world. It is stated very
  completely in Hobbes' Leviathan. Leviathan is the State into which the
  individual life is almost completely incorporated. Its will is concentrated
  on the sovereign who heads the collective monster by right divine. He makes
  war and peace, he raises up and casts down, he levies taxes as he will. Even
  while Hobbes was preparing his book for press, England decapitated Leviathan
  in the person of Charles the First. The practical difficulty of the
  Corporative State has always been the question who should be the head and how
  a new head should succeed its predecessor. The High Anglican Church upheld
  the monarchy and maintained the hereditary principle, but the liberal gentry,
  the merchants and the tax-paying classes generally, were too much for the
  state monster.</p>

  <p>Except in the case of Franco's Spain and the extinguished Catholic
  Corporative State of Dollfuss, the heads of the totalitarian states of today
  are usually sustained by "parties" of a distinctly gangsterish quality. At
  the cost of mental flexibility and adaptability, the corporate state gains a
  certain immediate concentration of will. Our problem is to estimate what
  amount of mischief these obstinately knotted will systems may do with the
  monstrous weapons of the present time, before they themselves can be undone.
  It may be irreparable mischief.</p>

  <p>The Nazi culture has been weighed in the previous section. Now we turn to
  its weaker associate, fascism. This is immediately interwoven with the career
  of one single man, Benito Mussolini. Compared with Hitler he is sane,
  intelligent and human. He is vain, rhetorical and immensely energetic, with
  the energy not of morbid concentration but physical abundance. He is what
  many men would like to be. His career from his early days as a socialist
  conspirator, when oddly enough he was already nicknamed <i>il Duce</i>, to
  his present supremacy on the crest of middle age, is a fairly open book. It
  is laced throughout with a thread of the ridiculous. Where Hitler is an
  unqualified horror, Mussolini often is, as schoolboys say, a bit of an ass,
  which is much more endearing. Until we remember the castor oil campaign and
  the poison bombs in Abyssinia and the Lipari Islands, and Amendola and
  Mateotti and Roselli and the like, he is a lark. But then the lark stops
  singing. We know absurdities about him from which he cannot escape, we have
  the researches of the curious and the revelations of intimates. Madame
  Balabanoff* tells a fairly convincing story of his life at Geneva, Mr. G.
  Megaro&dagger; gives the particulars of his upbringing among the rebel
  spirits of the Romagna, quotes relentlessly from his early speeches, and
  shows with chapter and verse how strenuous have been his efforts to conceal
  the truth about his early career. That anxious eye on posterity, these absurd
  and belated efforts to escape the unrelenting pens that pursue him, are
  naturally pleasing to a writer with a weakness for derision.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* My Life as a Rebel ( 1938).<br>
  &dagger; Mussolini in the Making (1938).</p>

  <p>But do not let us judge Mussolini only by the writings of his enemies. A
  more flattering study, written indeed in terms of unrestrained admiration, is
  <i>My Autobiography</i>. It was dictated by the Duce himself at the request
  of Mr. Richard Washburn Child, if possible a more fulsome hero-worshiper than
  the autobiographer himself, and it is amusing to compare its evasive
  flourishes with the relentless documentation of Megaro. If one learns little
  about the blacksmith father one gets hitherto disregarded particulars about
  the aristocratic Mussolinis of former days and their armorial bearings and
  castles and so forth. Anybody on record who was ever called Mussolini seems
  to have been his ancestor and to have anticipated some or all of his
  distinctive qualities.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See also Professor Salvemini's <i>The Fascist
  Dictatorship In Italy</i> (1928).</p>

  <p>Here we are not concerned either with biography or history except in so
  far as they throw light on the present world situation, but it is of very
  great importance in our estimate of the future of fascism to realize that the
  personal vitality of its creator must now be passing its maximum. He was born
  in 1883. For some years there has been an increasing appearance of effort and
  uncertainty in his grandiose gestures. It is as if he felt Italy was slipping
  away from beneath him. He has manifestly become dependent on the tougher
  initiatives of Nazi Germany. He is less sure of the Church. Six years ago he
  was holding up Dollfuss in Austria as a barrier against Hitler. And where is
  that barrier now? The Nazis look down on him from the Brenner Pass. He is
  losing face with his own people and his Nazi friends do little to help him in
  that matter. A few years ago it was dangerous to talk about him in Italy. Now
  they are talking.</p>

  <p>Can there be a second Duce to follow the first? His high-spirited daughter
  and his son-in-law, Count Ciano, seem impatient to outdo his Fascist
  intemperance, but they will scarcely dare to attack and oust him, and it is
  not in his character to resign. Unless some unanticipated accident removes
  him from the scene, we shall have, not Giovinezza, but a middle-aged fascism
  to reckon with from now on.</p>

  <p>The Italian situation has several incongruous elements and their relative
  importance varies continually. The Vatican (<i>pace</i> Mr. Teeling and his
  friends) seems now firmly dug in at Rome. Its relations to fascism have
  always lacked enthusiasm; it has ideas of its own. In the case of Fascist
  collapse or national defeat, the monarchy also stands ready to return and
  save the country. If the monarchy returned, would it be liberal or Catholic
  totalitarian? And the foreigner knows nothing of the possibilities of social
  discontent in Italy. Italy is a land peculiarly unfitted to stand the
  stresses of modern war. She is mostly coast line. She has no coal, and the
  Apennines are a thousand feet too low for her to have snowfields that would
  give her irrigation or water power. She can better defend herself against
  Germany in the Alps than against the sea power of France and Britain.</p>

  <p>All these considerations lead towards the same conclusion, that in the
  probable war tornado of the near future, Italy, if she is not clever enough
  to keep out of it, will play a secondary and gesticulating role. She may
  suffer many things. She has not the fixed will, and she cannot afford to have
  the fixed will, for war, at which the Nazi culture aims. It is Nazi Germany
  which remains the danger center of mankind.</p>

     name="chap17">&sect; 17. &mdash; THE BRITISH OLIGARCHY</a></h2>

  <p>THE next network of thought and behavior we must bring into this reckoning
  of world forces is the British Empire. British Imperialism, like Roman
  Catholicism, is a natural aggregation. No man planned it; it discovered
  itself in being. It is a crowned oligarchy, claiming to be democratic because
  it uses universal suffrage for election to one of its two Houses of
  Parliament, and to correct that it has an easily manipulated voting system
  and a proprietary press dependent on advertisement revenue for the
  information of its citizens. At no phase in history have the common people
  played a dominant part in the government of Great Britain, and in every phase
  the baronial oligarchy has prevailed. It is the tradition and education of
  this oligarchy which determines the behavior of the Imperial Government and
  its role in contemporary world affairs.</p>

  <p>Runnymede is the typical scene in the pageant of English liberties; Magna
  Carta documents the fundamental British situation. Magna Carta secures the
  liberties of the baron and free yeomen of the realm from all the main abuses
  of unqualified monarchy. It concedes no more rights to the churls and common
  folk of the land than it does to cats and dogs. About this central picture of
  the monarch amidst his barons English history groups itself. The king is
  restive, but his peers are stern. They war with the Scots and the French and
  they conquer and parcel out Ireland. The Church carries on its habitual
  struggle for existence, asserts itself, is restrained; it becomes rich and is
  reformed and plundered. The Crown, with a Tory following and a sympathetic
  Church, tries to go back upon Magna Carta, asserting its divine right to
  absolutism, and one king is beheaded and another goes into exile with his
  family, leaving the oligarchy, with a manageable new dynasty of Hanoverians,
  in possession. It over-exploits its American colonies and loses them, and it
  happens upon a greater Empire in the East.</p>

  <p>Never once in the proud island story does the will of the common people
  matter a rap. Occasionally they give trouble; they get rather out of control
  after the Black Death; and a little later we find them asking quite
  inconclusively:</p>

  <p class="poem">"When Adam delved and Eve span<br>
  Who was then the gentleman?"</p>

  <p>They subside into deepening misery with the industrial revolution, and
  they reappear in the nineteenth century struggling for nothing more than
  better wages and rather more tolerable living conditions. There was nothing
  very democratic about British trade unionism&mdash;as we have defined
  democracy in &sect; 6&mdash;and hardly more in the Labor Party that derived
  from it. The British Labor Party has never displayed any ambition to direct
  the affairs of the Empire. It aspires to nothing of the sort. It acknowledges
  the class inferiority of the workers and haggles by means of strikes and
  votes for a more tolerable but admittedly inferior way of living. By
  diminishing the discomfort of the masses and mitigating and soothing the
  exasperations caused by excessive business enterprise, it plays a stabilizing
  role in the existing system. Not only is it utterly absurd to call the
  British government now or at any time in the past a democratic government,
  but it flies in the face of manifest facts to deny that it is farther off now
  from anything that can be recognized as a democracy than it was thirty years
  ago. The old Liberal Party was liberal in its professions at any rate; the
  Labor Party is densely conservative. The British masses neither rule nor want
  to rule. They are politically apathetic. They do not produce outstanding
  individuals to express their distinctive thoughts or feelings, because they
  have no distinctive thoughts or feelings to express. Outstanding individuals
  of humble origin are obliged to fall into more or less easy acquiescence with
  the ruling system. There is nothing else for them to do. The oligarchy is
  privileged, it has to be served first at table with everything, office,
  honors, opportunity, but it is not exclusive, and that is one of the factors
  in its continued existence.</p>

  <p>I do not know of any comprehensive study of the education and training of
  the British ruling class throughout the ages. The feudal world was limited
  enough for a lord to get away with very little reading and writing. He had
  his clerk, his cleric, at his elbow, and he felt he could keep his eye on
  him. His world was all in sight. Leech, lawyer and priest knew their places
  and stuck to them. The renascence and the coming of the printed book altered
  all that. The medieval universities were swarms of poor scholars. The
  gentleman of the renascence had his tutor at home and went to grammar school
  and university. The grammar school became the narrowing portals through which
  the poor scholar had now to pass on his way to the learned professions. The
  Latin and Greek classics came into the Western world first as a stimulant and
  then, as the pedagogues watered learning down to scholarship, as a
  distinctive culture. The British oligarchy of the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries conceived of itself as Roman patricians and was rather ashamed of
  its illiterate members. It made the grand tour with its tutor, achieved a
  sort of French and Italian and became artistic and architectural. The apt
  classical quotation adorned the Parliamentary debates into the middle of the
  nineteenth century. After -that it became infrequent. It was not that the
  classics were going out of fashion but that the standard of learning was
  sinking.</p>

  <p>Culturally the British oligarchy was at its best in the seventeenth
  century. It knew what it wanted and how to get it. It managed its estates
  ably. It built fine houses, it made great progress in agriculture; its
  younger sons went into trade and spread adventurously into America, India,
  China. A prolific Protestant clergy supplemented the supply of enterprising
  young men. Yet a shadow fell upon the outlook with the Hanoverian
  importation, and Pope's <i>Dunciad</i> marked the change. The Goddess
  Dullness is enthroned:</p>

  <p class="poem">"And at her fell approach and secret might<br>
  Art after art goes out and all is night."</p>

  <p>The oligarchy still ruled and flourished materially under that
  unstimulating dynasty, but it made no further progress mentally; it ceased to
  be alert and adaptable, it became acquisitive, tenacious and conservative.
  Because of these qualities it presently irritated the thirteen American
  colonies into separation. The French Revolution took it by surprise. When the
  French in their turn decapitated their king it was not flattered by the
  imitation. It was scared. The revolutionary mob, it realized, was something
  different from the Ironsides. The Ironsides sang hymns and were sternly
  respectable. These people from Marseilles sang a much more alarming song.</p>

  <p>The deterioration of an education is usually a complicated process. The
  mere fact that it is materially successful makes for uncritical contentment,
  and discredits change. Teaching falls into the hands of sound, orthodox,
  unenterprising men. It becomes humdrum. Interest shifts to the greater
  reality of the playing fields. The history of British education&mdash;of the
  education of the oligarchy, that is to say, for popular education had hardly
  begun&mdash;from 1760 to 1860 is a history of resistance to change and steady
  deterioration.</p>

  <p>The nineteenth-century British gentry had nothing like the full-bodied
  classical education of the preceding centuries; they had only the pedagogic
  vestiges of that education. Mathematical studies had been introduced, but
  they were as stylistic and useless as the pedants could make them. By the
  middle of the nineteenth century the self-complacency of the British
  governing classes was being protected educationally not only from the
  subversive ideas of the French Encyclopaedists and the French Revolution, but
  also from that more fundamental upheaval which was making biological science
  the key to a modernized mentality. A dwindling section of the upper classes
  could read French still; there was an attractive breadth in the French novel
  that the domestic fiction of the period did not display; but Voltaire and
  Gibbon were passing out of fashion. When gentlemen scoffed, Queen Victoria
  was "not amused."</p>

  <p>Within the narrowing field of their cultivated ignorance, the young
  gentlemen prepared themselves vigorously for Parliamentary and administrative
  careers, and they developed an -enthusiasm for open-air sport and that
  primitive form of bath called the Englishman's tub, which was quite outside
  the ideology of their Tudor and Stuart ancestors. Many of them still shoot
  with distinction; others devote much time and attention to fly-fishing;
  others again cultivate gardens and watch birds. They have developed a
  peculiar literature of their own; memoirs, biographies and autobiographies,
  collections of letters and speeches, which establish their social values and
  supply them with patterns for the careers they follow. This constitutes the
  bulk of their reading. So equipped, the British oligarchy, at the head of a
  vast and scattered medley of dominions, crown colonies, mandated territories,
  India, faces the vast occasions of our time.</p>

  <p>It is questionable whether it faces them with any ideas about their future
  at all. Or its own future or any future. Like the Catholic Church, its main
  purpose seems to be to hold on, aimless except for self-preservation. It
  means to go on with the sort of life its fathers have left it, forever if
  possible, and that apparently is all it means. Crown, Church, lords and
  gentry will just stick at what they are where they are, until something
  shatters and replaces them. And they will do this not out of any essential
  wickedness but because in fact they know of nothing better to do.</p>

  <p>The English-speaking world produces an abundance of thought and new ideas,
  and it has a reading public sufficiently large to secure the translation of
  any really original book written in any language under the sun. But that
  reading public is widely dispersed and the major part of it is probably
  outside the boundaries of the Empire. The British ruling class is shy of
  ideas and imaginative creation, it dreads and hates what it calls highbrow
  conversation, and it can have very little time to explore beyond its
  distinctive literature of personalities. A number of concepts and
  understandings, a vast multitude of facts, that are known and clear to all
  well-informed people, seem never to have entered the British ruling-class
  mind or to have entered it only in a crippled or belittled state.</p>

  <p>Here again, just as in our examination of the mutual unawareness of
  Catholicism and skepticism, we may fall into the error of imagining that what
  is known to us must necessarily be known to other people. But in reality
  these people who rule the British Empire do not willfully ignore a great
  number of things, they are simply ignorant of them or ignorant about
  them&mdash;which is quite a different matter. Ever since the first French
  Revolution, for example, the mind of the British ruling class has remained
  barred against any understanding of revolutionary democratic ideas. The
  French Revolution frightened them and they pulled down the blinds upon it.
  They chose to think that liberty means nobody doing any work, that equality
  means bringing the under-housemaid up into the drawing-room and sitting her
  down to play the grand piano, to her and the general embarrassment, and that
  fraternity means embracing extremely unwashed&mdash;untubbed&mdash;people.
  Socialism again they regard as a dividing-up of all the property in the world
  into exactly equal shares for everyone. ("Inequality would come again
  tomorrow.")</p>

  <p>Since the advent of a real social democracy would certainly mean very
  profound readjustments in life for them, these quick shorthand
  interpretations so to speak, are far more satisfying and sufficient than a
  sustained argument. They insist upon thinking like that, and if their sons
  and daughters get other ideas they discourage them and "laugh them out of it"
  if they can. Everything indeed outside that little anecdotal world of theirs
  with its importances and routines, that world they would like to go on
  forever, they know as little about as possible; and since they have never
  looked at such projects and interpretations directly and intelligently, they
  cease to be projects and interpretations and are apprehended vaguely as
  prowling monsters, threats and perils&mdash;the Red Peril, the Yellow Peril,
  the Black Peril&mdash;outside rational existence altogether.</p>

  <p>I have had plentiful opportunity of sounding the minds of socially well-
  placed people, and in common with all the world I have watched the political
  conduct of the Empire during the past few searching years. Manifestly the
  mentality now ruling is one in which "Bolshies" are the enemies of God and
  man, men who go east are "pukka sahibs," royalties, beloved mascots whose
  very pet dogs are adorable, and workers honest drudges so long as they are
  not "spoilt," with only one weakness, susceptibility to foreign agitators.
  Americans it is understood are snobs in grain, but rich, and they should be
  kindly entreated. They will just simply fall down before the dear king and
  queen, whenever they get a chance. And also remember, "they cannot afford to
  see the British Empire overthrown,"</p>

  <p>If the men get a little away from that sort of thing, the chatter of their
  women brings them back to it. Their women interfere a lot; the Colonel's lady
  is the typical figure of feminine influence throughout the social scale. In
  the army, in the Church, in politics, her good word raises up or casts down.
  All this is recognized openly in novels, in plays and social intercourse, but
  when it comes to political discussion and <i>Times</i> leading articles, then
  reality has to be wrapped up in a lofty pretentiousness....</p>

  <p>This is undignified writing. This is in the worst possible taste. Yet I
  cannot explain the twists and turns of Mr. Neville Chamberlain unless I use
  the terms I do. How can I adorn him with splendid prose? I cannot see him as
  anything but essentially ignorant, narrow-minded, subconsciously timid,
  cunning and inordinately vain. He and his father, Joseph, before him appear
  to me as the appointed scavengers of the fading Imperial dream. Joseph
  Chamberlain, with his mean yet extravagant idea of monopolizing the vast
  resources under the flag by means of an Empire <i>Zollverein</i>, aroused
  that convergent hostility of the Have-Not States, to which his son, with a
  sort of poetic justice, now makes his propitiatory surrenders.</p>

  <p>I do not think Mr. Chamberlain wants to "save the Empire." The Empire came
  and the Empire may have to go. He adheres to something less transitory. His
  more immediate purpose, unless all his acts belie him, is to save the
  oligarchy and its way of life from its predestined end. He cannot understand
  that that way of life is over forever.</p>

  <p>His family have been at such pains to achieve it, have been so eager, so
  clumsily eager, to serve it. Still he and his kind dream of friendly
  hospitable chateaux in a restored Holy Roman Empire or under a Spanish
  monarchy, and of a France, an Italy, a Greece made safe for the gentry again
  by the crushing out of all subversive forces. That I am convinced gives the
  ultimate range of the political vision of Mr. Chamberlain and his class.</p>

  <p>When New York made an Exhibition to stimulate imaginations about <i>The
  World Of Tomorrow</i>, the British pavilion stressed the sentimental past,
  exhibited Magna Carta, crown jewels, pedigrees and an old English village.
  There was a genealogical diagram to demonstrate that George Washington was
  "one of us." There was not the faintest anticipation of that great fusion of
  English-speaking thought and activity throughout the world, of which all
  modern-minded men are dreaming. World Federation? Instead there was the most
  definite reminder that the British Crown and Church stood gently but
  inexorably in the way of anything of the sort.</p>

  <p>In the days before "Tariff Reform," it was possible for young Englishmen
  to dream of the Empire as a great propaganda and medium for liberal and
  broadening democratic methods, free migration, free trade and open speech,
  steadily weaving all the world together. It was a dream that captured many an
  alien imagination, as for example, Joseph Conrad's, but now it is an
  altogether abandoned dream. The idea of the Empire as a step towards world
  unification has lost all plausibility, and while the Chamberlain school of
  statecraft engages in its propitiatory dispersal, the creative imagination
  turns to the still living possibilities of one common culture of the
  English-speaking peoples.</p>

  <p>An increasing number of British people look now to the present President
  of the United States for some sort of world leadership. He is a good,
  liberal-minded fellow anyhow, but in a sort of despair of anything better
  they do their best to exaggerate him. Britain herself produces no one to
  speak whatever liberal thoughts she has to the world. She has nobody of that
  quality, and even were there such a man it is difficult to imagine how under
  existing conditions he could emerge to popular attention. Without an
  objective, dumb, the Empire is becoming an anachronism, an Empire of passive
  and inadequate resistance. Its progressive disarticulation seems inevitable,
  and if after all the dream of a federal reassembling of the English-speaking
  and English-reading communities struggles towards realization, it will owe
  very little to the Imperial tradition and organization. North America, with
  its looser, freer and more abundant mental activities, is far more likely to
  become the backbone of such a reconstruction, and to carry it out on a
  democratic rather than oligarchic ideology. Monarchy, Church, influential
  families, experienced administrators and old Parliamentary hands, would
  merely clog and encumber the development of the social machinery necessary
  for a modernized world state.</p>

  <p>So far from exercising any further leadership in world affairs, Great
  Britain is much more likely to withdraw into itself. With a dwindling
  population, an inadequately progressive educational system falling more and
  more behind the headlong needs of our time, and a shriveled prestige, the
  island may become unimportant enough to stand out altogether from the effort
  to effect a world synthesis. It may remain a crowned oligarchy yet for many
  years, fatuously content with itself and still as unaware as it is today of
  its continual decadence. Today in the Eastern world one can find a dozen
  anticipatory parallels, the self-satisfied and self-contained vestiges of
  what were once proud and important ruling powers.</p>

  <p>Possibly this residual Old England, in addition to its hunting and
  shooting and fishing and race meetings and so forth, will carry on, will be
  almost forced to carry on, a small but bickering warfare with the equally
  decadent dictatorship of Catholic Ireland. In that manner, if the world fails
  to reconstruct itself, the British Islands seem likely to pass into the
  gathering darkness of the future. And if after all, mankind as a whole does
  meet the challenge of facts and the scientifically organized world state
  emerges, it will be into enlightenment rather than darkness that these island
  residues will dissolve. Macaulay's New Zealander may arrive after all, and
  when, according to the prophecy, he has visited the ruins of St. Paul's, he
  will be shown over the Houses of Parliament ("curious and rewarding," as
  Baedeker would put it) and do his puzzled best to imagine what that strange
  narrow life was like, assisted by extracts from Hansard, carefully preserved
  gramophone records of important speeches, enlarged photographs of Mr.
  Gladstone, movie glimpses of Mr. Neville Chamberlain in a state of
  indignation, and the still surviving political novels of Mrs. Humphry
  Ward.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">&sect; 18. &mdash; SHINTOISM</a></h2>

  <p>AND now we may consider another great mental system ruling the minds and
  behavior of millions of men and women, which has recently become a leading
  factor in world destiny. This is Shinto, the official and compulsory religion
  of the Japanese. Formally, other religions are still tolerated, the Roman
  Catholic for example, but only on condition of ceremonial and practical
  acquiescence in the main doctrine of the creed, the recognition of the
  supreme divinity of the Mikado. Mr. A. Morgan Young has recently published an
  admirable summary of this culture,* and to this mainly I am indebted for the
  material of this section. He in turn gives his sources for whatever
  statements he makes, so that the interested reader can easily verify and
  expand what is given here.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>The Rise Of A Pagan State</i> (1939).</p>

  <p>The basis of Shinto is the Kojiki, a compilation of the eighth century
  A.D. It is readable in its entirety only by scholars, its language being far
  more remote from the Japanese of today than eighth-century Anglo-Saxon would
  be from current English. For various reasons only portions of it have been
  modernized for general use. It begins with a sort of storm of Gods neither
  made nor begotten but passing away. From this tumult emerge two highly sexual
  figures, Izanagi and Izanami, who might be described in Hollywood language as
  male and female "sex appeal." They respond to each other with tremendous
  vigor, begetting gods and islands and at last a Fire God who burns up his
  mother Izanami. But by this time Izanagi is so set on procreation that
  everything about him procreates; he throws off his clothes and they become
  sea gods and land gods. Finally he produces the Sun Goddess from his left
  eye, the Moon God from his right eye and the headlong Susa-no-o by blowing
  his nose. After which he seems to have retired and the Sun Goddess and
  Susa-no-o occupy the stage.</p>

  <p>After various remarkable adventures, no doubt of the greatest spiritual
  significance and full of lessons for the true believer, Susa-no-o meets a
  formidable damsel-devouring dragon with eight heads and other alarming
  accessories, makes the beast drunk with saki, and then kills it and cuts it
  up. But one of the tails resists and breaks his sword, because in it there is
  hidden a better sword. This he extracts and presents to his sister the Sun
  Goddess. It lies today, thickly swathed in brocade, in the Family Shrine of
  the Imperial House in Tokio. It is one of the Three Sacred Treasures, the
  sword, the mirror and the jewel, which the Sun Goddess transmitted to her
  heirs, the divine Emperors, the living Gods of Japan.</p>

  <p>To the Western mind accustomed to a widely different system of myths and
  absurdities, this reads like monstrous nonsense. But it is wiser not to say
  that in Japan. For example, Mr. Morgan Young tells of what befell Dr. Inoue
  Tetsujiro, a loyal but liberal-minded Shintoist who ventured to doubt the
  authenticity of the Three Sacred Treasures. He was denounced, his publisher
  was penalized, and he was expelled from the Imperial University. Later on,
  while attending the memorial service of a friend, he was set upon by a gang
  of pious ruffians and beaten so that one eye was destroyed. So much for a man
  who had attempted to spiritualize and rationalize the Japanese faith. No one
  was punished for the outrage upon him, which indeed is only one sample among
  many of the spirit of renascent Shintoism. It is quite good form to jump at a
  man who uses a phrase or makes a gesture that seems lacking in piety, and
  stab him. It is like those fierce old colonels in England who assault people
  for not standing stiff to "God Save the King."</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan Young makes some interesting suggestions about the
  temperamental make-up of the Japanese. There are important Mongolian strains
  in them, but he quotes Putnam Weale (<i>The Truth About China And Japan</i>)
  to support the thesis that the virile and dominating factor is Malay. Their
  clothing beneath the kimono, the construction of their houses, their lapses
  into moody murderousness are all Malay. He insists upon the constant
  recurrence of head hunting proclivities in their history. An unintelligent
  blood-thirstiness is in their nature and tradition. They have an inferiority
  complex with regard to Chinese and Western civilization, which takes the form
  of an extravagantly aggressive and assertive patriotism. I have followed my
  authorities in these generalizations. So far as official Japan is concerned
  they seem to be thoroughly justified. They account for the fact that the head
  of the state is not so much a leader as a mystically sacred symbol. The
  rulers of Japan today are Nazis without a Hitler, Fascists without a
  Mussolini. In the animal world an acephalous monster is sometimes, tougher to
  tame or destroy than one with a head.</p>

  <p>From the deliberate isolation of Japan in the seventeenth
  century&mdash;when all the bickering Christian sects and in particular
  Xavier's Jesuits were expelled, and the entry of foreigners and foreign
  travel prohibited absolutely&mdash;until the barrier was broken down by
  Commodore Perry in 1853, there was an age of internecine feuds and exciting
  strife of every sort. Vendettas were honored. The play of the <i>Forty-Seven
  Ronin</i>, the most popular of Japanese plays, is the heroic consummation of
  a vendetta, ending, after the decapitation of the initiator of the feud, with
  the hara-kiri of these forty-seven heroes. Japan was indeed a romantic
  head-hunting preserve for the tough. And among the tough everywhere loyalty
  to the gang is the supreme virtue, loyalty to the gang and no mercy for the
  flats, the serfs, the common cattle, outside the gang.</p>

  <p>This is as true of the "wise guys" of Soho as it is of the gangsters of
  San Francisco. Wherever there are young men without proper employment the
  tough guy reappears. The ultimate sin is "squealing"; the crowning heroism is
  silence under the severest questioning; the master triumph is brilliant
  outrage. These gallant fellows in Japan would rape or try their swords on
  peasants without compunction. In such an atmosphere of swagger and loyalty
  lived the Daimios, the feudal noblemen, and their henchmen the Samurai, until
  the barriers were forced and the outer world broke in.</p>

  <p>About the beginning of this century, the code of honor of these bickering
  toughs, the noble warrior's way of life, was idealized by a certain Dr.
  Nitobe, who wrote a book in English called <i>Bushido</i>, "through which the
  word was for many years far better known abroad than in Japan." He
  incorporated all the finest pretensions of European chivalry. His Samurai
  became the disciplined and fearless knights-errant of the world. It took in a
  lot of people&mdash;including myself. In <i>A Modern Utopia</i> (1905), the
  world was taken care of by an order of "Samurai." They assumed the role of
  the Syphograuntes in the original <i>Utopia</i>, and in that they anticipated
  the Communist Party commissars very strikingly. Since 1900 we have had,
  <i>inter alia</i>, the Nazis, the Fascists, the Phalangists. I was thinking
  with my generation.</p>

  <p>In a lecture at the Sorbonne, in 1927, <i>Democracy Under Revision</i>, I
  returned to that idea of a disciplined liberal "party." It arises naturally
  and inevitably out of the problem of contemporary indefiniteness and the
  relative ineffectiveness of intelligent people.</p>

  <p>Perry's guns in 1853 aroused that ringed-in Japan of blood feuds,
  hara-kiri and heroic decapitations to the existence of a dangerous and
  aggressive outer world. The Japanese nobles and their Samurai, given over
  altogether to pride, realized their enormous practical inferiority. While
  they had been enjoying life after their fashion, the outer world had stolen a
  march on them. It was plain they had to modernize or succumb&mdash;like
  India, like Java. They had to learn the tricks of these foreigners and learn
  them quickly, their machinery, their weapons and generally how they did it.
  At first it seemed that Christianity might be part of the coveted advantages,
  and Japan thought seriously of making Christianity a state religion. After
  much recalcitrance and rebellion, the Shinto religion was revived and the
  country was unified under the divinity of the Mikado.</p>

  <p>Happily for the renascent Japanese, the British Empire suffers from
  practically incurable Russophobia. It is a constitutional disease of the
  British ruling class. Every assistance was given, material and mental, to the
  new forces of consolidation, and in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) an
  Eastern Asiatic power shattered the prestige of Europe on land and sea alike.
  The Great War completed the job. After that there were no more inquiries for
  an adaptation of Christianity to the headship of a divine monarch&mdash;a
  slight improvement upon the Royal Headship of the Established Church of
  England. Instead of Christianity, Shinto, a genuine home product, came into
  its own.</p>

  <p>And gradually, in association with the concentration of power in the
  warrior class, it has consolidated itself and all its absurdities as the sole
  religion of Japan, driving every alternative faith and conception
  underground. For the better part of the period of modernization since 1868,
  there has been a steady influx of Western science, Western ideas, Western
  radicalism into Japan. There were endless circles in which "advanced" ideas
  were discussed freely. With an astonishing swiftness that liberal Japan has
  disappeared. A few murders, a clean-up of schools and colleges, and the thing
  has been done. In the place of an intelligent people we face a national
  monomaniac. This, from our present point of view, is the most important
  aspect of the whole business.</p>

  <p>With an apparent singleness of purpose Japan has flung itself into the
  attempted conquest of China and the most reckless defiance of the chief naval
  powers of the world. Here, as in the case of Nazi Germany, we are left
  asking, "Where have all these reasonable mitigating people gone?"</p>

  <p>"Where"&mdash;and this is perhaps even more to the point&mdash;"has the
  rational element gone in those who have succumbed?" So many who once talked
  liberalism, seem now to be wholehearted belligerent patriots.</p>

  <p>Our essential theme in this book is the possibility of changing the mental
  superstructure, the knowledge, idea and habit system of mankind. In that we
  hope. The tremendous rapidity of this last Japanese change-over is almost
  incredible. Is it an irreversible process? And if so, what will it go on to
  next? Can it stand military defeat in China?</p>

  <p>Many things seem possible in this catastrophic world of today, but one of
  the higher probabilities of the present world situation seems to be the
  failure of the Japanese attack on her greater neighbor. China has astonished
  the world by her tenacity, by the steady unification of her resistance, by
  the emergence of a sort of pervading militant wisdom. The Japanese have been
  stupendously energetic and stupendously unoriginal. There has been much
  detailed cunning in their operations but no essential wisdom. Desperadoes may
  murder many people but they cannot divide and rule a hostile country. What
  will happen in their heads as they realize defeat with nothing but that
  childish Shintoism of theirs and a tradition and cant of swaggering victory
  to sustain them?</p>

  <p>Will it be wrath and social revenge? Many of these young warriors who
  landed in China full of the toughest dreams of heroism, victory, rape and
  authority, must now be in a state of profound disillusionment. They will have
  a sense of having been fooled. And in China&mdash;unless I underestimate the
  quality of Chinese and Communist propaganda&mdash;they will have met not only
  hardship but ideas. Sooner or later they must go back to a country where the
  endurance of the peasantry and the people has been tried to the breaking
  point.</p>

  <p>Here are the same factors that existed in Russia in 1918, the factors for
  a crude and violent social revolt. There is no greater threat to a government
  than the return of a defeated army. It will go ill in such an event with
  nobles and dignitaries and priests, and it is quite among the possibilities
  of the next few years that the last divine heir of the Sun Goddess, shorn of
  all divinity, may share a parallel fate to that of the last Little Father of
  Russia. Then, starting from an even lower level than Russia in 1918, Japan
  will have to reconstruct its social and economic life.</p>

  <p>That may be one possibility, but history never repeats itself exactly, and
  revolutionary methods have changed very greatly in the last twenty years. As
  one turns these matters over in the mind, China looms not merely as a
  military but as a mental reality of the first importance. What systems of
  thought are operative there, what new systems of thought are worming their
  way into the brains&mdash;and many authorities declare that they are rather
  above the human average&mdash;of that immense multitude? That is a question
  of more importance in a forecast of the human outlook than any we have
  hitherto discussed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">&sect; 19. &mdash; THE CHINESE OUTLOOK</a></h2>

  <p>THE primary importance of China in the current interplay of human forces
  is due not only to the fact that it is the greatest mass of human beings with
  any sort of solidarity in the world, but also to its manifest educability. It
  is not only the largest but now it is probably the most plastic mass on
  earth. Hitherto we have been weighing the influence and destinies of set and
  blinkered cultures. But in China, tradition, cultural ideas, cultural methods
  are passing through a phase of extreme dissolution, the mind of every
  intelligent man is in a state of stimulated inquiry, and creative
  propositions, if they could be presented there, would surely have a freedom
  and effectiveness such as no other part of the world can display.</p>

  <p>The immemorial basis of Chinese life is an industrious peasantry, the
  primary source of wealth, on whom the landlord, the loan manager, the
  merchant, the tax collector have lived in a state of inconsiderate refinement
  for a long period. When the pressure of taxation or population becomes
  intolerable, the peasant becomes a bandit and the tension is relieved.
  Bandits, says J.D.M. Pringle, are the Chinese equivalent of the "unemployed,"
  they levy an unsystematic dole. There have never been any fixed impediments
  to peasants acquiring wealth or gentlefolk becoming poor, and so, though
  there has always been much poverty, it has produced little class antagonism.
  No race difference exists between rich and poor; there is no superimposed
  nobility, no chivalry with a strong military and hunting tradition. The
  absence of great natural barriers led to a precocious expansion of
  governments to a size that, almost from the outset, made a class of literate
  administrators more necessary and more important than soldiers.</p>

  <p>The early need for writing in China arrested its development beyond a
  quasi-pictorial and clumsily elaborate stage. It was wanted too soon, before
  it could undergo simplification into a syllabic or alphabetical system. This
  also contributed to the distinctive quality of China, to the Chinese&mdash;if
  we may coin a word&mdash;<i>para-democracy</i>. The extreme difficulty of the
  written language did indeed put popular education out of the question and set
  a practical barrier between literate and illiterate more effective as between
  man and man than any Western class distinction, but at the same time the very
  difficulty of scholarship obliged the mandarinate to draw continually upon
  the clever sons of poorish homes. These special conditions converged to give
  China its distinctive social and political structure, a structure so
  difficult to alter without complete destruction, that so far neither invasion
  nor civil commotion has ever changed it in any essential particular. When for
  example the Manchus conquered the land, they merely founded a new dynasty and
  imposed the now vanished pigtail&mdash;rather by way of assimilation than
  sublimation. So far. But now this refractory system has to face something
  more powerful than Hun or Manchu or Japanese; it has to face the change of
  scale, the change of pace, that is shattering all other human societies.</p>

  <p>The religious basis of the Chinese system is equally in contrast with the
  God-centered beliefs of the West. Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism are all
  alike atheisms. There is no one God standing in any personal relationship to
  man. Confucianism is concerned entirely with the present life, it discourages
  speculation and inculcates an excessive ancestor worship and respect for the
  state. It insists upon public service and dignified self-control, not to
  please a god but simply because that is the right way of living. Taoism is in
  contrast a religion of abandonment to nature. Politically it is anarchistic
  and around it cluster a great accumulation of superstitions, spiritualisms,
  spookisms and quasi-magic beliefs, incantations and astrology. Every folly of
  the wonder-lovers of today has been anticipated by Taoism. Buddhism teaches
  a transmigration of souls, souls that may be entirely unaware that the good
  and evil they experience is due to their behavior in a previous
  embodiment.</p>

  <p>Essentially these religions are behavior systems&mdash;or misbehavior
  systems. Taoism is frankly anti-social, an imaginative dissipation of the
  mind and will, and Buddhism is at least a withdrawal from life. They are both
  what it is now fashionable to call escape systems. Their teaching finds its
  Western equivalent in the "detachment" of Mr. Aldous Huxley. Both foster
  religious orders and inflict a great multitude of monks and nuns upon the
  community, and neither has anything of importance to contribute to that
  intelligent reconditioning 3f the human mind which the present world
  situation demands. Politically and educationally, the yellow- (or gray) clad
  Buddhist monk with his begging bowl and his pimping possibilities is a social
  nuisance; the convent passes by insensible degrees into a common brothel.*
  But Confucianism is almost pedantically upright. It is the religion of a
  respectable totalitarianism. Whatever political backbone is found among the
  older generation of Chinese is in the tradition of Mencius, the disciple and
  exponent of the master.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See Lin Yutang's <i>My Country And My People</i>
  (1936).</p>

  <p>In the crucial period of the nineteenth century, China was more self-
  satisfied with itself than Japan, and altogether indisposed for fundamental
  change. It had no such sudden shock as Commander Perry gave the Japanese, and
  it had no consciously ruling caste to react effectively to a warning. It knew
  the European better than the isolated Japanese, and it had long since formed
  a poor opinion of the physical and moral bustle and inelegance of Western
  living. It found the Westerners ugly, truculent and requiring cautious
  management; but although they had a variety of curious mechanical advantages
  it deemed them despicable. Since it took on an appearance of Westernization,
  China held out against modernization for half a century after the Japanese
  awakening. It endured much. We cannot even sketch that story here from the
  British Opium War onward. China's first reaction to these aggressions was
  violent xenophobia. This culminated in the Boxer outbreak (1900) and the
  punitive looting of the Summer Palace at Peking by the allied European
  powers. Still China would not pull itself together to fight Outlying parts of
  its Empire fell away; ports and provinces were seized; this did not affect
  the routine in the regions still intact. Even under direct foreign rule much
  of the old life still carried on. The ancient order seemed as incurably
  contented with itself as the British.,</p>

  <p>Here is how that keen and witty writer Mr. Lin Yutang characterized the
  Chinese way of living&mdash;so recently as 1936. "...Face, Fate and Favor.
  These three sisters have always ruled China, and are ruling China still. The
  only revolution that is real and that is worth while is a revolution against
  this female triad. The trouble is that these three women are so human and so
  charming. They corrupt our priests, flatter our rulers, protect the powerful,
  seduce the rich, hypnotize the poor, bribe the ambitious and demoralize the
  revolutionary camp. They paralyze justice, render ineffective all paper
  constitutions, scorn at democracy, contemn the law, make a laughing stock of
  the people's rights, violate all traffic rules and club regulations, and ride
  roughshod over the people's home gardens. If they were tyrants, or if they
  were ugly, like the Furies, their reign might not endure so long; but their
  voices are soft, their ways are gentle, their feet tread noiselessly over the
  law courts, and their fingers move silently, expertly, putting the machinery
  of justice out of order while they caress the judge's cheeks. Yes, it is
  immeasurably comfortable to worship in the shrine of these pagan women."</p>

  <p>So Mr. Lin Yutang in 1936, and in 1936 he still despaired of any
  purposeful consolidation of his country for many years to come. But in three
  years Japanese military savagery has brought about a desperate unification
  beyond any foresight.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lin Yutang is by nature and disposition a Taoist of the finer sort. He
  betrays at times a certain patriotic uneasiness and impatience, but these are
  lapses from his usual artistic self. For the most part he sustains a genteel
  detachment from the revolution of 1911 which ended the Manchu regime and the
  pigtail forever. He deplores the novel energy of Sun Yat Sen who "kept up his
  reading." He notes that Chiang Kai Shek and his financial ally T.V. Soong
  work "like horses." His heart turns back to "Merry old China" in all the
  infinite strength of laziness. "The racial tradition," he concludes, "is so
  strong that its fundamental pattern of life will always remain."</p>

  <p>Nothing in the world is so perennial as that. The history of China since
  the fall of the Manchus displays altogether new forces at work. It is not the
  old, old story. However reluctantly, she now faces towards Cosmopolis, The
  republic was the creation of Chinese students who had been educated abroad or
  by foreign missions, and mostly they had been trained in America. Never
  before had there been a Chinese revolution fostered in exile. But this last
  one, like the kindred Russian one, was made by expatriates. Its revolutionary
  technique followed Western patterns. The Chinese Republicans borrowed ideas
  from the Communist Party, and the organization of the Kuomintang provided a
  nexus for the restless and intelligent throughout the Empire. Numerically the
  Kuomintang, like the Communist Party in Russia in 1917, was a relatively
  small organization, but it was the only thing that had continuity and a
  definite will of its own in an otherwise planless chaos.</p>

  <p>This is not the place to review the stormy confusion of Chinese affairs
  since the establishment of the Republic;* the experimental policies of Sun
  Yat Sen and the significance of his will, the treason of Yuan Shih Kai and
  his transitory usurpation of the Imperial throne, the clumsy attempts of the
  Russian Borodin to introduce an uncongenial class war and to revive
  xenophobia in the form of anti-British Imperialism as a fundamental motive.
  He failed, and returned to obscurity in Russia, but the Party, under Chou
  En-lai, organized a successful peasant communist state in Kiangsi&mdash;I say
  peasant communist because there was no attempt at collective
  farming&mdash;and a very efficient Red Army.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A compact summary is to be found in <i>China Struggles
  For Unity</i>, by J.D.M. Pringle and Marthe Rajchman.</p>

  <p>Driven out of Kiangsi, this Red Army retreated fighting for six thousand
  miles in one of the greatest retreats in history, and stood at last with its
  back to Soviet Russia in Shensi and the northwest. The intricate struggles
  between the Nanking government, the private armies of various warlords and
  the Red Army, need not concern us, nor the romantic and mysterious cessation
  of the war against the "Reds." The fact became apparent to the Japanese that
  slowly and steadily China was being unified under one government. There was
  no time to lose. Like a fiery new birth came the tragic consolidation of the
  Chinese national spirit in the face of intolerable Japanese outrages. Today
  under the military and administrative ability of the energetic Chiang Kai
  Shek we have a China more united and purposeful than it has ever been before,
  and apart from its resolve for complete national emancipation, more
  incalculable than any other human aggregation.</p>

  <p>So faded and nerveless are the old conceptions of life, so Taoist, that
  the entire collective mentality of China is now in effect a <i>tabula
  rasa</i> upon which it is possible to write almost any constructive idea. And
  what is written will be evidently determined very largely by movements in the
  general world mind outside the boundaries of China. The native contribution
  is in the nature not of initiatives but adaptive qualifications. Lin Yutang,
  in one of those involuntary lapses of his from "detachment" into patriotic
  distress and irritation, notes that a dozen years after the death of Sun Yat
  Sen, who is by universal consent the father of the new China, no Chinese
  writer has yet displayed the energy and intellectual power .needed to write a
  full and competent account of the Founder's life and teaching. It would
  certainly be an immense commercial success; it would be of the greatest
  political importance; and in that land of lassitude, evasion and passive
  resistance to change, nobody produces it.</p>

  <p>It would seem as though a Chinese mind must needs go abroad and lead a
  foreign life, before it can even begin to see China. And when it sees China
  it still depends upon a push from the exterior, for action.</p>

  <p>The most vital new thing so far that has been written upon this blank
  Chinese intelligence is a sort of communism. In a later section we must
  examine communism as a world force, but here it is to be observed that just
  as Chinese democracy is not the same thing as Western democracy but a
  <i>para-democracy</i>, so Chinese communism is not by any means the Russian
  article, but a <i>para-communism</i>. It has rejected Borodin's crude ideas
  of liquidating the "rich," the class war and collectivized farming. It is
  essentially a peasant communism, a revolt against rent, taxes, debt,
  forestalling, speculative marketing and all the handicaps that enslave the
  little man. Its leaders are often the fanatical enthusiastic sons of wealthy
  men, sons who have read Marx and Lenin, but the responding rank and file are
  the commonalty. It educates earnestly and well, it carries on a propaganda by
  means of plays, concerts, meetings. It promotes a modernized script. It is
  making its people into newspaper readers. It is in fact producing a new sort
  of Chinese common man, with a genuine workers' and soldiers' solidarity.
  Everywhere the peasants, even those who do not belong to the Party formally,
  believe in it. Its "Red" Army is as sturdy as any China has ever seen, with
  partisan tactics peculiarly adapted to the country.</p>

  <p>A second set of ideas which is being scrawled across the Chinese <i>tabula
  rasa</i> is the New Life movement. This was deliberately created by Chiang
  Kai Shek as a rival and substitute for communism. Chiang Kai Shek is at
  present the central figure on the Chinese stage; he has been fairly explicit
  about his ideas and motives, and there is considerable artlessness in what he
  says. He has an interestingly responsive and representative mind. He speaks
  with profound reverence of the influence of his mother in forming his
  character. She remained an earnest Buddhist to the end. She watched over his
  tender years. She trained him for an energetic life of public service and
  self-subordination. He took his early political leadership from Sun Yat Sen
  and the Kuomintang. Sun Yat Sen was a Methodist with a passionate desire to
  free his country from 'Western Imperialism." This brought him at last into
  close association with the anti-Imperialist Borodin. It was Borodin's
  aggressiveness and the killing of rich people and foreigners that estranged
  Chiang Kai Shek from Sun Yat Sen.</p>

  <p>Chiang Kai Shek became for a period militantly anti-Communist. His
  marriage with Miss Mayling Soong, a member of one of the richest families in
  China, may have had its subconscious influence upon him. His close
  association with the Soong family, and particularly with T.V. Soong, has
  relieved him of many temptations that have overcome other leaders less
  financially secure. Madame Chiang Kai Shek is a woman of manifest beauty and
  force of character, and for some time she seems to have done the religious
  thinking for her husband. He was baptized as a Christian in 1930. Their type
  of Christianity is a simple evangelical bibliolatry, inclining to
  fundamentalism rather than to either modernism or Catholicism; it is
  fundamentalism with a dash of Buchmanism. Every day the Generalissimo reads
  his Bible and prays for guidance. He prays regularly and abundantly and says
  grace before he eats. In moments of doubt the sacred book is opened and
  consulted for an omen.</p>

  <p>The New Life Movement is not however professedly Christian, though it
  speaks in the name of the Christian Sun Yat Sen. It is essentially a
  patriotic behavior system, attacking opium, polygamy and "immorality"
  generally, tobacco, alcohol, tea, coffee, meat. It is in violent reaction
  from the enervation of Taoist self-indulgence. It expresses the realization
  of the middle and upper classes that things are getting serious for them. Its
  ambition is to be stern and powerful, to promote a "clean" and strenuous
  life.</p>

  <p>Chiang Kai Shek has been immensely impressed by Fascist and Nazi
  propaganda, he speaks in profound admiration of "the strength of present-day
  Italy and Germany," he swallows, as I did, the legend of Bushido (&sect; 18)
  and like Mr. Teeling (&sect; 13) he believes that the Nazi disciplines make
  for brotherhood, obedience and particularly for that "cleaner" life of sexual
  and imaginative suppression which leaves the mind free for militant
  authority. (Both he and Mr. Teeling would be all the wiser and better for a
  cleansing month in the latrines at Dachau.) But since the aim of the New Life
  is power even more than purity, it is flatly opposed to any infringement of
  the rights of private property. It was indeed primarily organized for that
  end, as a counterblast to communism, and by its emphatic denunciation of
  Communists and "traitors" and its rigid insistence upon the payments of
  debts, it makes a special appeal to foreign finance. Its Methodist virtues
  are a means to an end. The end is self-righteous power. No doubt the New
  Life stimulates the open campaign against opium, vice and insanitary living,
  and no doubt it releases a genuine streak of solemn masochism in the
  composition of the Generalissimo, but how far the natural Chinaman will give
  himself wholeheartedly to the New Life remains to be shown. The failure of
  Prohibition in America and the social demoralization caused by it, seem to
  have had no lesson for Chiang Kai Shek.</p>

  <p>For my own part I believe in the complete honesty of Mr. and Mrs. Chiang
  Kai Shek, but it is plain that they have not the faintest conception of the
  demands that fate is making upon mankind. They sound indeed in all their
  published utterances, terribly limited and self-satisfied, and however much
  we may be pleased to see China led to victory against the Japanese, that is
  no reason why we should exaggerate the intelligence and vision of these two
  leaders, because they are instrumental in that hoped-for
  <i>deb&acirc;cle</i>.</p>

  <p>Such are the chief forces that are operating to produce the China of
  tomorrow&mdash;Chinese communism, or, to define it more clearly, <i>para-
  communism</i>, and this New Life which is plainly <i>para-fascism</i>.
  Neither is yet what one can call a commanding force. They combine against the
  common enemy, but they have no real convergence. The end of the war with
  Japan will release rather than conciliate their oppositions. China liberated
  will become more and more definitely a battleground of world ideologies. She
  will waver between Soviet Russia and fascism, between Christianity of the
  J.D. Rockefeller type on the one hand and a tentative socialism after the
  fashion of the New Deal, rather to the left of the New Deal, on the other.
  One may well doubt if she has any initiative of her own to give the
  world.</p>

  <p>In most Chinamen there struggle a Confucian, a Taoist and a Bandit. To
  judge by the present state of things that completes the inventory. And yet
  there is an accumulation of artistic work, a record of invention and
  ingenuity to the credit of China, witnessing to something not covered by any
  of these three factors, to some constructive element that existing
  circumstances have failed to release, some higher intellectual development
  which may still be waiting there&mdash;for the proper evocation.</p>

  <p>This raises what is from our present point of view a very important issue.
  Is there a real scientific modernism, a constructive originality, latent in
  that very respectable Chinese brain? Has it unexploited mental reserves? That
  is a question that might be extended far beyond the Chinese horizon. At
  present China is almost completely unaware of the ecological view of life.
  She has never heard about it. Science subsidizes no missions; it has failed
  even to organize its friends in defense of its own freedoms. Almost all this
  "new education" in China, that has been replacing the classics since the
  revolution, has been ear-marked for the service of some narrow dogmatism or
  other. Her brightest intelligences have had but a poor chance of any broader
  vision. So in China even more than in our Western world, political and social
  life is still a disastrous clashing-together of blinkered minds. What she
  thinks new is already old. She is no more prepared to attack the gigantic
  problems of adjustment that close in upon her, in common with the rest of the
  world, than she was thirty years ago.</p>

  <p>In these thirty years she has done great things. The greatest has been to
  discover and assert her national independence and solidarity. And still she
  has everything to do. It is either a prelude to renascence or failure, to
  have installed a Methodist-Generalissimo in the place of the Son of Heaven,
  got rid of pigtails, given up smoking, drinking, swearing, necking and
  suchlike scandalous behavior, and driven the opium traffic underground.
  Things will not stay at that.</p>

  <p>So China, because of its nascent state, because at present there is no
  deep-rooted system of ideas imposed upon her character and habits, presents,
  in the barest form, the universal human problem. What prospect is there of an
  effective drive towards a scientific understanding of history and present
  realities, and of a reconstruction upon the lines of that knowledge?</p>

  <p>Here again we must repeat the refrain of this book.</p>

  <p>There exist already scattered about the world, all the knowledge and
  imaginative material required to turn not merely these seething four hundred
  million people but the whole world into one incessantly progressive and
  happily interested world community. All that is needed is to assemble that
  scattered knowledge and these constructive ideas in an effective form. The
  world cannot go on, a hydra-headed confusion of sovereignties; it has to
  concentrate its direction in a <i>World Brain</i>. The organization of a few
  thousand workers and the expenditure of a few score million pounds could
  bring that indispensable organization into being. And I doubt if it will ever
  be done.</p>

  <p>It would give this rudderless world, as it drifts towards the rocks, a
  chart-room, a compass, a bridge and steering-gear</p>

  <p>It would change the face of human politics from the aimless stare of
  dementia to understanding purpose....</p>

  <p>To vary the image once more, in China, the greatest, most central and
  representative human accumulation in the world, the fields are manifestly
  "white unto harvest" for a comprehensive renewal of civilization, the whole
  land aches for it, and there are no reapers; there are only spreading fires,
  trampling beasts in the corn, and a few weaklings gathering a handful of
  ears.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A very convincing and readable picture of China in
  dissolution is to be found in Miss Nora Wain's <i>The House Of Exile</i>, and
  there are also the various effective and well-informed novels of Mrs. Pearl
  Buck, <i>The Patriot</i> for example, and <i>The Good Earth</i>. Edgar
  Mowrer's <i>Mowrer In China</i> is a convenient little book, compact, full,
  and understanding.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">&sect;20. &mdash; SUBJECT PEOPLES</a></h2>

  <p>ONLY very briefly and, as it were, in parenthesis, is it possible to
  glance at the future of the black peoples massed in Africa and their kindred
  in America.</p>

  <p>The argument of this book is framed on such a scale that the lives and
  deaths of scores of millions appear as details of microscopic size in
  relation to the general ant-hill Moreover, it has a perspective of its own.
  It looks from the directive centers of human thought, outwardly. Estimates of
  the population of tropical and southern Africa vary round and about one
  hundred and fifty million. Probably it is subject to considerable
  fluctuations. These millions live, hope, desire and suffer. But this great
  population is so remote from the central intellectual processes of mankind,
  it contributes so little to these processes, that it counts for far less than
  the sixteen million Jews, from whom, in spite of great handicaps, come men of
  science, original thinkers, mental workers of all sorts by the thousand.
  Later, but many decades later, the Negro mind may make a steadily increasing
  contribution to the World Brain. But at present it is held off by such a
  tangle of difficulties, obstructions and mind-traps as only the rarest and
  luckiest of natural geniuses may hope to overcome.</p>

  <p>In Lord Hailey's <i>An African Survey</i> (1938) and in Julian Huxley's
  <i>Africa View</i> (1931), the reader may learn something of that tangle.
  There, for example, he will find a discussion of the language problem. Is the
  young Negro of genius to begin his learning in some narrow dialect or in such
  a wider medium as Swahili, which still provides only a very limited
  literature for his study, or shall he be given as soon as possible the key to
  contemporary knowledge and thought, in English or some other European tongue?
  And where are the teachers and schools to be found for that? Even if he gets
  English, will it be good, fresh English? Will he encounter anything better
  than the faded methods, half a century stale, of a lower type of English
  school? Will it let him get to anything better than Bible Christianity, the
  history of England and a nice Christmas story or so about holly and robins?
  Where the Negro is apt to become a little ridiculous is in his exaggerated
  response to white religious teaching. He takes it in good faith and brings
  out its absurdities. That is not his fault. <i>Green Pastures</i> and Father
  Divine are products of white revivalist teaching; they are not native African
  creations. They smell of the camp meeting and not of the Heart of Darkness.
  We have no right to call a Negro a fool when it is our people who have made a
  fool of him. Julian Huxley insists very definitely on the desirability 01
  biology and descriptive geography as the backbone of native African education
  and on the natural interest and aptitude of the African for such studies.
  There he would be on his, own ground. But because the African is ready for
  the right education, it does not follow that the governments in authority
  over him are. These poor-white schoolmasters can teach him nothing of the
  sort, because they know none of it themselves.</p>

  <p>There is a great conflict of testimony about the abilities of black
  Africa. His bitterest detractors are unable to deny the Negro an enviable
  sense of rhythm, natural good-humor and an instinct for civility, a sense of
  fun, brilliant mimicry, rich artistic aptitudes. And more than that. In the
  United States, in spite of the severest handicaps, black men have been able
  to struggle up to do distinguished scientific and literary work, and in South
  Africa it has been found necessary to protect skilled white labor from the
  competition of able colored people by discriminating against the apprenticing
  of natives to skilled trades and restricting "certificates of competency" in
  various mechanical employments to whites. Obviously you cannot put up
  barriers to protect yourself from the colored man and at the same time
  declare that he is incurably your inferior.</p>

  <p>The outlook for tropical and sub-tropical Negro life in the coming years
  is dark and indefinite. An adequate education, that would make a large
  proportion of that population conscious world-citizens, seems improbable, and
  the utilization of that great reservoir of ignorant animal vitality as a
  source of conscript soldiers or conscript laborers is highly probable. It is
  one of the good marks in the checkered record of British Imperialism that in
  Nigeria it has stood out against the development of the plantation system and
  protected the autonomy of the native cultivator&mdash;with the most
  satisfactory consequences to everyone concerned. But against that one has to
  set the ideas of white-man-mastery associated with Cecil Rhodes and
  sustained today by General Smuts, which look to an entire and permanent
  economic, social and political discrimination between the lordly white and
  his natural serf, the native African, And this in the face of the Zulu and
  Basuto, the most intelligent and successful of native African peoples. The
  ethnological fantasies of Nazi Germany find a substantial echo in the resolve
  of the two and a half million Afrikanders to sustain, from the Cape to Kenya,
  an axis of white masters (preferably of Dutch origin and speaking Afrikaans)
  with a special philosophy of great totalitarian possibility called holism,
  lording it over a subjugated but much more prolific, black population.</p>

  <p>That racial antagonism makes the outlook of South Africa quite different
  from that of most of the other pseudo-British "democracies." Obviously it is
  not a democracy at all, and plainly it is heading towards a regime of race
  terrorism on lines parallel and sympathetic with the Nazi ideal. The
  Afrikander will do his best to be a terrific fellow to the last, and he will
  see to it that the black insurrection gathering under his heel, is
  sufficiently under-educated and sufficiently embittered to behave savagely
  when its day of opportunity comes. He will always be rather afraid, and his
  fears will brutalize his treatment of his helots until he is intolerable.
  Slowly but surely a racial self-consciousness, a collective resentment, is
  being forced upon the Negro, not only in South Africa but throughout the
  world, and South Africa seems the inevitable theater for its release.</p>

  <p>But the fate of South Africa need not concern us now, beyond the plain
  probability that whether the Dominion follows the fate of Haiti or San
  Domingo or whether the sjambok holds its own, it is very unlikely to
  contribute anything of primary value to the reconstruction of human society
  upon a planetary scale.</p>

  <p>And so, too, we cannot consider here the possible survival or
  disappearance of that little group of human beings, the Australian
  blackfellows, with their undeniable artistry, their aptitude for mechanical
  work, and so subtle a sense of form that they invented the boomerang ages
  before the white man made his first experiments with the much simpler
  propeller. Nor can we bring in that great festoon of interesting and
  distinctive human societies which hangs across the subtropical seas from
  Singapore in the west throughout the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea to Guam
  in the east. Sixty million brown and yellow peoples they are, illiterate,
  unawakened, but for the most part excessively polite and subservient.</p>

  <p>The problem of all these colored peoples is a vast one, but vast as it is,
  it is still secondary to greater decisions. If the mind of the world can be
  pulled together so as to give our species a collective rational guidance,
  this problem will fall into proportion and be solved deliberately and sanely.
  The colored man will understand and be understood, he will get his fair
  chance, so that he will come at last to look the white man in the eye,
  feeling as equal to him as a musician does to an engineer, with as complete
  an acceptance of difference and as complete a mutual respect. But if we
  cannot achieve that intellectual readjustment, then the prospect is fear and
  more fear, cruelty and more cruelty, trampling suppressions, wild
  insurrections, massacres and reprisals, atrocities and counter-atrocities,
  and the ultimate waste of every good possibility in these still largely
  unbroached reservoirs of human variety.</p>

  <p>It is not in their own lands that the destiny of all these people will be
  determined. It is not on the "illimitable veldt" or in the tropical forest,
  not in mountain fastnesses or on stormy seas that their hope is to be found.
  Natural aptitude is not enough. The inherent intellectual quality of a
  cannibal savage or a coolie laborer, a starving share-cropper or an
  Abyssinian slave, may be as high or higher than that of a distinguished
  professor or a brilliant colonial administrator, but the latter is not simply
  his inherent self; he is that plus an education. The one is like a
  photographic plate that has been casually exposed to the light, it is an
  accidental blur; it means little or nothing. The other is a plate that has
  been exposed in a carefully focused camera. It means. It is related. The
  education and habits of behavior it imposes are the greater part of the
  civilized man. The better and fuller his education, the better the knowledge
  organization of his life, the higher he stands over the bare human being, and
  the more he and his kind control him and are responsible for human destiny.
  The only salvation of these threatened millions lies through the patient,
  incessant ordering of the collective human mind. A man working in a study at
  Harvard or a student sitting, as Marx and Lenin sat in their time, in the
  Reading Room of the British Museum, may be linking ideas and devising phrases
  that will open the way of escape for all these menaced and benighted peoples
  to equal participation in a reconstructed world.</p>

  <p>And here is the place to apply the same line of reasoning to that great
  miscellany of peoples and cultures which is India. They seem destined to play
  only a secondary and supporting role in any unification of human affairs that
  is achieved, not by reason of any inherent inferiority, but because they are
  debarred by their complicated mental barriers and divisions from any
  collective understanding of modern constructive ideas. These hundreds of
  millions also I see as people struggling in a net. At present none of their
  cultural movements displays an original line of its own that amounts even to
  a slight contribution to world reorganization. Vague aspirations to an
  obviously fictitious nationalism of an imitative parliamentary kind,
  sustained by non-co-operation, preferential trading and the fasts of Mr.
  Gandhi, point to anything but the coming city of mankind. Starving on the
  doorsteps of the ruler in the Gandhi fashion is a curiously unfair appeal to
  the ruler's decency. Directly it is used against anyone tough enough to say
  "Starve then, and be damned to you," it becomes ineffective.</p>

  <p>There would be much to be said for an Indian nationalism based upon the
  idea of human brotherhood and the common future of mankind. If all these
  peoples can be fused, 'the whole world can be fused. But speaking generally
  Indian nationalism is no sort of synthesis; it is based on a common,
  understandable resentment at the British Imperial Government and on very
  little else. You cannot build a nation on a vanishing grievance. The old Raj
  is not going to last forever, and when it fades out the Hindu will still be
  wearing his caste marks and the Moslem slaughtering cattle at him in a
  derisive spirit.</p>

  <p>A culture which said "We are ignorant and divided and condemned to a
  collective sterility by our ignorance, and we mean to reorganize our mental
  energy and stock our minds to play our proper part in human unity," would be
  a culture to respect. But even the Brahmo Sumaj, most liberal of Indian
  cultures, does not say that. It is universalist religiously, but it is not
  acutely educational. In India there are numerous rich men, great
  industrialists, wealthy maharajas and the like, but it has still to dawn upon
  any of them that a great, growing, liberating mass of knowledge exists in the
  world beyond the present reach of any Indian, and that there must be scores
  and hundreds of thousands of fine brains, which need only educational
  emancipation and opportunity, laboratories, colleges, publication facilities,
  discussion with the rest of the world, to add a continually increasing Indian
  contribution to the ever-learning, ever-growing <i>World Brain</i>. In India
  now there must be a score of potential unrealized Royal Societies, so to
  speak, running about in loin-cloths and significant turbans and Gandhi caps
  and what not, running about at that lowly partisan level, and so running to
  waste.</p>

  <p>The British ruling class has been unable to impose modern ideas upon India
  for the simple reason that it does not possess them itself. The indebtedness
  is the other way round. The British picked up the idea of caste from the
  Brahmins and gave very little in return. And other things they picked up. I
  do not know if anyone has ever made an estimate of the number of elderly
  gentlemen who return to Great Britain with gurus in tow, mysterious dodges
  for breathing down their spinal canals, Yoga and all that. They seem to be
  quite numerous. Man for man when it comes down to that sort of thing the
  Hindu is master.</p>

  <p>What modernization may come into Indian thought and life is much more
  likely to arrive tediously and belatedly from the north as an adapted
  communist propaganda, a propaganda modified perhaps by contact with whatever
  modern Western science may have come in by, through and in spite of British
  influence from the south.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">&sect; 21. &mdash; COMMUNISM AND RUSSIA</a></h2>

  <p>IT is difficult to say whether on the whole dogmatic communism is to be
  regarded as a disaster that has happened to the growing discovery of the
  rational world state or an unavoidable phase in that discovery. In the
  earlier half of the nineteenth century and especially in the years of
  recovery from that embolism called Napoleon, there was a great bandying about
  of creative and pseudo-creative ideas, humanisms, varieties of socialisms,
  hand-specimen Socialist experiments, New Lanarks, Oneidas, Brook Farms. In
  all of them there was a subconscious feeling that something was still
  wanting, the ideas were incomplete. Such a phase of the collective mind is
  very distressful to impatient intelligences. They feel that nothing is being
  achieved; they want to "fix something and get on with it." At this pace, they
  feel, we shall get nowhere.</p>

  <p>So they get into the ditch.</p>

  <p>Apt to the demands of such eager spirits came Marx. He was a man of vast
  intellectual ambitions, emulous of Darwin and Adam Smith. He seized upon that
  economic aspect of life which the political revolution had ignored, and he
  hung on to that. The "capitalist system," which was his misnomer for
  privately owned capitalism, had to be abolished and then social justice would
  ensue. He proclaimed the materialistic conception of history and the class
  war as the only practicable way to social justice.</p>

  <p>Neither Adam Smith nor Darwin, with whom he was obviously disposed to put
  himself in competition, betrayed any sense of finality in his thought nor any
  ambition for leadership. They contributed and passed on, according to the new
  scientific morality. But Marx was of a more primitive and more immediately
  practical type of intelligence. He was for conclusive formulation, for dogma
  and an energetic revolutionary effort according to that dogma. He evoked a
  vigorous, rigid-spirited movement for the destruction of "capitalism" by an
  insurrectionary class war. He had no ideas, and he was probably incapable of
  producing ideas, about the peace that should succeed victory in the class
  war. It never entered his head that a powerful new organization of knowledge
  and will would be required to direct an emancipated world system. He was, to
  be plain about it, too lazy-minded. He invented a phantom, more insubstantial
  than the Holy Ghost, the proletariat. The ever-blessed proletariat would see
  to it all.</p>

  <p>The curious may read about that proletariat, and what is and what is not
  the dictatorship of the proletariat, and when the Party is the dictatorship
  and when it is not, and how the peasant comes in, in Joseph Stalin's
  <i>Leninism</i>. It is the Athanasian Creed of socialism.</p>

  <p>But these complications arose later, and at first the proletariat <i>sans
  phrase</i> sufficed. That the proletariat would solve everything with the
  hammer of Thor and the sickle of Rhea Cybele was an all too attractive
  doctrine for eager minds, and the communist movement, in perfect unison,
  contemned and despised the intricate and difficult business of foresight as
  "utopianism," and scientific criticism as a sinful want of faith. And so at
  last when czarism and private ownership of land and capital did collapse in
  Russia, and that great country was thrown into the hands of the communist
  leaders, they were totally unprepared with any conceptions of a better
  organization of affairs.</p>

  <p>The released Russia of October 1917 found itself wildly experimental. It
  had to reorganize a great community fallen into chaos, and it had only scraps
  of suggestion of how to set about it. Upon Lenin fell the immense task of
  rationalizing Marxism and getting it to work.</p>

  <p>In &sect; 6 the question "What is democracy?" is asked and answered, and
  it is shown that the life of a human being can be full and free only if it is
  politically, economically and mentally liberated; that is to say when it is
  living in a state of political equality, socialism and universal adequate
  education. Without that much realization, liberty, equality and fraternity
  are mere words. Marx and his Communist Party never fully grasped the third,
  the educational condition. How to direct? how to keep direction?: these were
  questions they never answered. They filled in the gap in their doctrines with
  that sprawling, muscular divinity with the 'hammer and sickle, who is in
  truth hardly more real than those symbolic Hindu gods with countless arms and
  extra parts who puzzle the realistic Western mind. Believe in Him, said
  they.</p>

  <p>In practice the Russian Communists were less elusive than their creed. If
  they fudged a pseudo-God, in order to get on with their revolution, they were
  still acutely responsive to modern democratic ideas. They set themselves with
  considerable energy and success to liquidate the illiteracy of the common
  people, but unfortunately they did not go on with the harder task of
  educating themselves. They did not realize the need for that Instead they
  suppressed disturbing discussion. They are today blinkered and boxed-in to an
  ideology as definitely restricted, within its wider limits, as that of the
  orthodox Jews, the British oligarchy, the Roman Catholic hierarchy or the
  Chinese patriots we have discussed in preceding sections.</p>

  <p>The Russian spectacle for the last twenty years has played an immense part
  in the thought and imagination of the young everywhere. When everything that
  can be said has been said against it, it still seems to be ahead of the rest
  of the world in its progress towards the practical realization of the
  complete democratic idea. Whether it will go on and keep that lead is quite
  another matter, but the improvement not merely in the material circumstances
  but in the spirit of the common people is beyond dispute. They were servile
  and now they are proud. They have a wholesome conceit that the world looks to
  them. That has been done at a price, yet nowhere else has anything been done
  to compare with it. America also has advanced in its ideas, as we shall note
  in the next section, but it started far ahead, five Centuries ahead, of
  Russia.</p>

  <p>But Russia may have achieved this much progress less by virtue of the
  Communist Party than in spite of it. The Communist Party did no doubt bring
  the spirit of revolutionary progress to Russia, but it was not in itself the
  spirit of revolutionary progress. It might well have been better prepared for
  the task, and it might have produced men of a finer caliber and greater
  magnanimity. The darkest shadow on the Russian outlook today is its failure
  to produce a constellation of first-rate men able to evoke its general
  intelligence and speak for it to the world. Like most countries today, Russia
  does not seem to be putting her best men foremost She does not know how to
  find them and use them. She goes on being clumsy. Russia is faltering and
  losing its imaginative appeal. Her inability to deal with her internal
  difficulties without a series of trials and executions, so presented as to be
  extraordinarily repugnant to the Western mind, and the open and undignified
  bickering of Trotsky and Stalin, have done much to rob her of her once almost
  magical fascination for the undergraduate intelligence. That intelligence is
  now shocked and puzzled. It may easily stampede in some new direction, and
  the real greatness of the new Russia may be forgotten altogether in its
  superficial littleness.</p>

  <p>But how intolerable these ardent young Communists of the last fifteen
  years have been! What a rawness they have imparted to social and political
  discussion, all the world over! How unrighteously is the reasonable man
  tempted to rejoice at this present deflation of noisy, juvenile leftism! It
  is rare for the normal human being to attain to an adult mental independence
  before thirty, and it is rare for it to refrain from the vehement expression
  of opinions after eighteen. Satan finds some mischief still for idle youth to
  do. Its natural instinct is to rebel against its parents and the parental
  generation, which has brought it into the world for no end it finds
  explicable, and, since it is still much too timid intellectually to act
  alone, its disposition is to go over, lock, stock and barrel, to the
  organization in flattest repudiation of the flaccid home atmosphere. The good
  pagan's daughter goes Catholic and the Catholic's son goes Communist. And
  there they stick. They have made their little act of assertion, but they must
  still have the comforting feeling of something not themselves, something
  built up authoritatively, to which they can cling. The boy who runs away from
  home likes to get on to a ship and give himself up to that. If not, he
  usually comes home again.</p>

  <p>It is one of the primary difficulties of this creature <i>Homo sapiens</i>
  that it grows up, so far as bodily and willful energy goes, twenty years
  before its mind has ripened enough for it to think and act alone. The young
  want to do vigorous and effective things by eighteen, while their mental
  unripeness obliges them still to seek authority for the things they want to
  do. They cannot wait. They will respond to nearly anything that lets their
  energy loose, as a kitten will pursue a cork on a string. There we have the
  common clue to the storming young Nazi, the Irish patriot, the Spanish
  Anarchist Syndicalist, the bomb-throwing Zionist, the Shinto militarist, the
  gangster, the Ku Klux Klansman. They are all forms imposed upon and accepted
  by that youthful surplus which is the imperative problem of our species,
  which will overstrain and wreck every social system until its insurgent need
  to be used is anticipated and satisfied. It has been made clear how this
  mental exuberance has been allayed in the past by wars and migrations, and
  why it is that these natural reliefs are no longer sufficient for the
  magnified destructive forces of the new time.</p>

  <p>In the last three years in Britain there have been three magnetic
  movements with an unaccountable attraction for unemployed vitality. Fascism,
  a fourth possibility, was happily made repellently ridiculous for our sons in
  the person of Sir Oswald Mosley, but the impressionable young men who did not
  succumb to the God-guided woosh of Buchmanism or the high-toned
  Anglo-Catholicism of T.S. Eliot, fell very readily to the worship of the
  heroic Hammer-and-Sickle-God. They joined the Party, surrendered themselves
  to tasks and disciplines and strategies. They felt they had the revolution
  and all Russia behind them. How they maddened their serious elders, those
  undergraduates holding on without thought or question to the Party and being
  as rude as they knew how to critical liberalism, for all the world like
  naughty children holding on to nurse's apron strings and putting out their
  tongues at the grown-up passers-by!</p>

  <p>That particular adhesion seems to be drawing to an end after the political
  and intellectual waste of a generation of silly, gallant young lives. They
  exaggerated the perfection and finality of Soviet Russia. Some have died for
  that faith. Now the drift is all against the present regime, and instead of
  searching criticism we are likely to have partisan condemnation. Yet there is
  a strong case for the existing regime in Russia.</p>

  <p>There, there has been and there is still a sustained, widespread and
  honest effort to build up a new social and economic order. It is only
  necessary to contrast the Russian drive with the relative ineffectiveness of
  the Kuomintang. In Russia "revolution" still means, for millions of minds, a
  new human beginning. In no other community is that idea of a new beginning so
  manifestly at work. It had had to work against bad social traditions and a
  widespread defensive subtlety and disingenuousness, with a people to whom
  punctuality and precision were strange ideas. Chekhov lived and died before
  the war, but his stories are saturated with the distress felt by a man with a
  modern scientific training, at the all too human indiscipline of the land he
  loved. The Bolsheviks, planless themselves, as we have seen, had to take over
  that world, shattered, impoverished, chaotic, invaded from every direction,
  and make a working system of it, some sort of new order, however rough and
  clumsy, or perish. And they have made a new order, rough and clumsy still
  perhaps in many aspects, but holding together, really holding together, and
  not nearly so rough and clumsy as it might have been.</p>

  <p>I have visited Russia thrice, in 1914, in 1920 and in 1934, I have had
  long talks with Lenin and Stalin, I have some well-informed and variously
  orientated Russian friends, and I have read a library full of books about
  Russia, pro and con, Like most of the world, I was amazed at those strange
  public trials and the killing-off of, among others, a majority of the
  original revolutionaries. And I think that of all my witnesses, I have learnt
  most from an American mining engineer, Mr. J.D. Littlepage, who wrote a book
  called <i>In Search Of Soviet Gold</i>.</p>

  <p>There never was a writer so free from the taint of political
  prepossessions. He is no sort of <i>ist</i> or <i>crat</i> at all. But he
  likes mining to be done properly and shipshape, no fudging, no shirking, no
  waste, no stealing, no trickery. You have to come down heavily on that sort
  of thing. He thinks vigorously within <i>his</i> blinkers (excellent
  blinkers) of honesty and high efficiency. And he tells the story of how he
  was engaged to revive and reorganize the Siberian mines, copper and other
  minerals as well as gold. He tells pretty convincingly&mdash;and it is
  illuminating&mdash;how Stalin was moved to start this revival, and of all the
  difficulties and complications of the task. At the Littlepage touch the vast,
  sinister phantoms of Trotskyite conspiracies and organized capitalist
  sabotage vanish from the scene, the confessions of the accused join the
  confessions of sorcerers during the witch mania, and we see the human reality
  of incompetent men trying to cover up the mess they are making of things, of
  wrongfully-appointed men holding on to their jobs by trick and subterfuge, of
  hates and jealousies, of elaborate misrepresentations to save the face of
  groups involved in a common failure, of the manufacture of countervailing
  evidence, counter-accusations, resort to influence in high quarters. These
  are the ways of imperfect, inadequately watched men everywhere. The allied
  generals on the western front during the great war behaved similarly, though
  unhappily there was nobody to shoot them. And at the last come the
  confessions, to put a consistent face on the untellable tale of fudging and
  muddle-headness. Better persuade yourself you are a consistent conspirator
  than a self-protective fumbler, a snake rather than a worm.</p>

  <p>Littlepage makes you understand not only the slackness of the country and
  the disappointing output, but also the perplexity at the head of things, the
  inability to get sound information and to discriminate between merit and
  speciousness. The head does not know whom to believe, grows suspicious and
  incalculable. The impulse of most of us when we cannot hit accurately is to
  hit hard. The shootings become understandable; take on the quality of
  necessity. After Little-page you can re-read the reports of those trials and
  begin to understand them. The wonder of Russia is that nevertheless so much
  has been done.</p>

  <p>I write with prejudice about communism, but it is not prejudice on its
  behalf. I have made it clear, I think, how intensely I detest Karl Marx and
  how greatly my mind has been irritated by the narrowly dogmatic communism of
  the young. Yet I am forced to a recognition of the real advance Russia has
  made since the revolution, not merely in material things. Will it go on? What
  for us is the significance of the new phase into which Russia is now
  passing?</p>

  <p>The mass of the new Russia still seems in its crude way to be
  revolutionary, in the best, the creative sense of the word. The great raw
  organism is still moving forward. But there is manifestly something wrong
  about the head of it. A great number of disillusioned young men in the
  Western world are saying now that it is Stalin who is to blame and
  proclaiming themselves Trotskyites. But the matter goes deeper than that. It
  is not really a personal matter. The organization at the head of things must
  be radically wrong to be put out of gear by a mere personal feud. It must be
  so framed as to eliminate good types of mind and promote mediocrities. Lenin
  was a first-quality man, Litvinov is a much abler man than the run of
  diplomatists; apart from that the personalities directing Russian affairs
  vary from honest ordinary to intricately mean. It is preposterous to suppose
  that they are the pick of that Russian intelligence which has produced men
  like Mendeleev, Mechnikov, Pavlov, Pushkin, Maxim Gorky....</p>

  <p>The headquarters organization upon the shoulders of the Russian giant is,
  to be plain about it, a head without a forehead; it has a brain that lacks
  anything more than a rudimentary cerebrum. Russia, with an area of over eight
  million square miles and a gross population of one hundred and sixty-six
  million people, is being run by a directorate as antique and rudimentary in
  its nature as some small <i>pronunciamento</i> South American Republic or the
  tyranny of an ancient Greek city state. It has no knowledge organization at
  all. It has no powers of reflection. It has only the Communist
  Party&mdash;which is dogmatic ignorance. It is a giant&mdash;I speak of
  social structure and not of persons&mdash;with the head of a newt.</p>

  <p>That is the absurd situation of Russia. Only, unhappily, nobody seems to
  consider it absurd. The country is still living on the mental impetus of
  Lenin and the democratic socialism of the nineteenth century. When that
  impetus is spent it will have nothing to fall back upon but die preposterous
  pretensions of personal government.</p>

  <p>It is this absence of a collective cerebrum that has made the present feud
  of the Stalinists and the Trotskyites possible. Trotsky I have never met, but
  he seems to have a considerable personal vanity; Stalin I liked when I talked
  to him; I did not think he had an overwhelming intelligence, but I thought he
  was honest and strong and human. I have been disillusioned about him mainly
  by those foolish films of personal propaganda he has allowed to be made,
  <i>Lenin In October</i>, for example. Therein Trotsky is elaborately
  belittled and Stalin made the all-wise hero of the story. He stands over
  Lenin. Modestly but firmly he indicates the strategic points in the map and
  tells him what to do. Apparently he is trying to distort the whole history of
  the revolution for his personal glorification.</p>

  <p>Why do these two men behave in this way? Apparently they are posing for
  posterity. That was something Lenin never did. He was a man of the new order.
  Both Trotsky and Stalin are middle-aged and have very few years left now in
  which to do anything more for the world, and this is how they dissipate them.
  They are behaving as absurdly as Mussolini. Few human beings are adult before
  thirty-five and most remain puerile to the end. Do they not understand that
  even if they are remembered they are&mdash;in the busy world
  ahead&mdash;certain to be misjudged? Nobody will have time to read whole
  books about them. One or another thing awaits these legends they are
  cherishing. If the world fails to readjust itself now, they will pass, with
  everything else that is human, into oblivion; and if it does readjust itself
  to its new occasions, then so far as they are remembered at all, they will be
  taken in hand by a more adult and motherly Clio and spanked and put in their
  places.</p>

  <p>I am amazed at these egotisms and astonished at the complete inability of
  the Communist rank and file, out of Russia at any rate, to avoid taking
  sides. Either they take sides or they wander away from the idea of creative
  revolution altogether, so completely are they dependent on the behavior of
  their Great Men. This is infantile. The man of the new world order, if ever
  it is to be attained, must learn to go right on without leaders, just as he
  must learn to go right on without God.</p>

  <p>What is happening to the body of Russia, obscured by this scuffle? The
  scuffle has so narrowed-down to personalities that a great deal may be
  happening outside it. It may be that in this matter my wish is father to my
  thought, but at any rate I believe that a more or less complete restoration
  of intellectual liberty in Russia in the next few years is a quite possible
  thing. The Russian, who, like the Englishman or the American, has grown up in
  an atmosphere of less immediate militant stress, is not nearly so docile as
  the German. There is an ineradicable disposition to humor and laughter in
  these less controlled peoples. They are earlier adult. I cannot suppose that
  the Nazi regime would tolerate for a moment those popular stories by Michael
  Zoshchenko, which hold up the weaknesses and discomforts of the Soviet regime
  to the gayest ridicule. Laughter can dissolve prison bars; it can outflank
  prohibitions. Russian writers are beginning to take liberties.</p>

  <p>The Russian mind is an insubordinate mind and an untidy one. This virtue
  and this vice may be two aspects of one quality. Russian thought lacks and
  needs the restraint of the more disciplined Western intelligence. It has that
  courage and irresponsibility which we associate with genius. A release of
  intellectual energy in Russia, corresponding with and responding to the
  appearance of a reorganization of knowledge and collective purpose and
  judgment in the West, would have a vastly stimulating effect upon the thought
  and will of the entire world. It would be an event of major importance in the
  mental reorganization of mankind. And in the brightness of this new beginning
  it would hardly be observed that the Communist Party, the Comintern, too
  narrow, too insincerely dogmatic and "too clever by half," had unobtrusively
  disappeared, as I suppose that sooner or later it must do.*</p>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">&sect; 22. &mdash; AMERICAN MENTALITY</a></h2>

  <p>FINALLY, in this stocktaking of human forces, we come to the countries
  more directly affected by the American and French revolutions at the end of
  the eighteenth century, the countries in which, beyond the shadow of the
  British oligarchy, radical and liberal and democratic ideas have had a
  maximum freedom of expression. Chief of these, and charged now, it would
  seem, with the main burthen of their common destiny, is that third great mass
  of human beings with any sort of solidarity, the United States of America,
  China, Russia, North America; these vast countries make more than a third and
  nearly a half of humanity; they occupy most of the north temperate zone,
  which is the zone of maximum human energy, and with the British Empire they
  constitute the greater part of mankind. They are all fermenting with change.
  And the most freespoken, active, perplexing and various of all these great
  vats of destiny is the United States.</p>

  <p>The United States is of primary significance in world affairs for a number
  of reasons. In the first place its population is almost entirely literate,
  that is to say, it can read. How it reads and what it reads is another
  matter. There are no cheap books in America such as there are in Great
  Britain and France; most books worth reading can be got in England for
  sixpence, while in America they cost from ten times as much upward; and
  outside a limited world even prosperous people hear very little of any but
  those best sellers which follow each other like epidemics across the
  continent. But the newspaper Sunday supplements and the public libraries
  largely compensate for these present imperfections of the book supply. So the
  American public as a whole, over the vast areas it covers, is simultaneously
  accessible, if need be, to new ideas, and that accessibility is greatly
  enhanced by the nation-wide distribution of the cinema and the radio. And
  next it has a tradition of free discussion. The American says what he thinks,
  and even when he doesn't think he is apt to say it. You can always contradict
  him, and there is no handicap to help any opinion to win.</p>

  <p>Education is in the hands of the forty-eight state governments of the
  Union, and varies widely in its standards and organization from state to
  state; schools, colleges and universities are scattered abundantly over the
  land; they range from sheer imposture upward, and the best of them are as
  good as or better than anything else in the world. There are great endowments
  for education and for educational enterprises. There are probably more highly
  educated people in the United States than in any other single country
  whatever, and when it comes to what we may call the half-educated, people
  whose minds, already loosely furnished, could easily be quickened, there is
  no comparison. In one or two backward states, modern scientific
  teaching&mdash;of evolution, for examples&mdash;is prohibited in the state
  schools, and discriminatory obstacles are put in the way of the education of
  colored people. These are exceptions to a general freedom. The intellectual
  possibilities of this vast country are unlikely to be seriously threatened by
  invasion, extreme war stresses or civil convulsions for some time. They are
  threatened just enough to stimulate them and prevent their becoming
  lethargic.</p>

  <p>Like all the rest of the world, the Union has felt the impact of the new
  conditions of human life, the progressive abolition of distance, the immense
  increase of material power and the ensuing dislocations of economic and
  social order, but less confusedly and with more time and elbow-room for
  consideration than any other country. It has been able to look and see; it
  has been able to think more plainly about the change that has come upon us
  all. It has only realized in the last decade that it has an accumulating
  surplus of unemployed.</p>

  <p>There is a vast elementariness about the past hundred and fifty years in
  America. It is as if social and political life in the United States was
  simplified and made plain for demonstration purposes to all the rest of the
  world. We have there in unqualified contrast the East and the West, the North
  and the South, White and Black; no petty nationalisms, no traditional
  hatreds, no language difficulties, no localized religions obscure the broad
  issues. The War of Independence left the country a democracy, democracy at
  its first stage, the state of political equality and individual liberty. The
  extension of the democratic idea to include socialism, educational equality
  and universally accessible information, which we have traced in &sect; 6,
  scarcely affected America until the close of the nineteenth century.
  Throughout all that century she worked out the possibilities for good and
  evil of a hard individualistic democracy. The Civil War, though it arose out
  of a number of economic and political stresses, simplified out at last, to a
  logical completion of the equalitarian idea by the abolition of slavery and
  the enfranchisement of the liberated slaves.</p>

  <p>Life throughout that period resolved itself into a scramble for wealth.
  The whole nation thought dollars, talked dollars. For several generations it
  was a distinctly exhilarating scramble. There were so much unexploited land,
  such reserves of natural wealth available, that it was possible to accumulate
  vast fortunes and still find fresh employment for everyone who chose to work.
  After the civil war came a great development and organization of industry.
  American invention, American enterprise, soon led the world in the expansion
  of big business and the mechanization of life. For a time it was not realized
  that this march of Triumphant Democracy* was essentially the rape of virgin
  resources that could never be replaced. Triumphant Democracy poured across
  the continent, destroying the forests and so changing the climate for the
  worse, ploughing up pasture that presently became sandy desert, exterminating
  animal species, using up coal, oil, mineral wealth as though there was no end
  to any of these things.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Andrew Carnegie, <i>Triumphant Democracy</i>
  (1886).</p>

  <p>It was only as the "Wonderful Century" drew to its end, that the immensity
  and the menace of Waste dawned upon people's minds. Everyone was so keen to
  get dollars that many of them forgot to get children, but the supply of labor
  for all that vast ploughing-up, cutting-down and tearing-out was sustained by
  a tremendous immigration. In 1906 a million immigrants poured into America,
  mostly people who knew no English and had a far lower standard of life than
  the native worker. They were divided among themselves at first by their
  special ignorances; they supplied a far more manageable type of labor from
  the point of view of the exploiting employer.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See my <i>The Future In America</i> (1906); "Two
  Studies in Disappointment."</p>

  <p>The home-grown strain hoped to save money, get on, escape from employment,
  and so it was slow to develop any class solidarity until it realized that
  every door to hopeful competition was being closed upon it. Labor legislation
  in America therefore fell far behind that of Great Britain. Not only was the
  immediate real wealth of America being turned to dollars; a rapid
  deterioration of the common life was also going on. Very reluctantly would
  America admit that the great uprush was over. Theodore Roosevelt's campaign
  for Conservation was the first practical recognition in America that
  Americanism had gone too far.</p>

  <p>This is not a history, but a survey of existing possibilities, and we will
  say nothing here of the events that exalted and depressed American life for
  the next third of a century, the war, the boom, the collapse, until we come
  to that nationwide realization of crisis and panic that brought Franklin
  Roosevelt in as the savior of a staggering social system.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a work of art can do more to present reality than a whole
  library of reports and statistics, and that tremendous genius, John
  Steinbeck, in his <i>Grapes Of Wrath</i> (1939), has given an unforgettable
  picture of the last stage in that process of material and moral destruction
  and disillusionment with which the story of sturdy individualism in America
  concludes. He gives it all, from the exhausted soil dribbling down to dust,
  to the broken pride, the hopeless revolt and the black despair of the human
  victims, without rhetoric, without argument, but with an irresistible effect
  of fundamental truth.</p>

  <p>The crisis discovered a great man in Franklin Roosevelt. As I have written
  elsewhere,* he is a "patrician" rather in the vein of Lord Grey and Arthur
  Balfour than a typical American politician. He is rich and his peculiar
  health makes him float rather above the level of everyday temptations.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Experiment in Autobiography</i>, Chapter IX, &sect;
  9, and <i>World Brain</i>, The Fall in America, 1937.</p>

  <p>He has the boldness of imagination needed to meet the challenges of the
  time, but he has the great gentleman's disposition to look to subordinates
  for the detailed execution of his designs. None too soon he has carried
  America forward to the second stage of democratic realization. His New Deal
  involves such collective controls of the national business that it would be
  absurd to call it anything but socialism, were it not for a prejudice
  lingering on from the old individualist days against that word.</p>

  <p>At the beginning there was much talk of the Brain Trust, which he had
  gathered about him to realize the vast changeover of American affairs he had
  in hand. I was tremendously excited by this Brain Trust idea, and I went off
  to America, as my <i>Experiment In Autobiography</i> relates, to have a good
  look at it. He had imagined that the universities could and would give him
  men of exhaustive knowledge and capacity in sufficient amount to create, on
  the spur of the moment, a civil service competent to meet the huge demands of
  this great transition he was so gallantly attempting. These Brain Trusters
  were what the universities produced for him. My wits were not quick enough to
  size them up at once. They seemed to be an extremely interesting and
  miscellaneous set of men, but I had a feeling from the outset that they were
  not going to justify the President's expectations. He was under an easy
  delusion about the American universities. He thought they were untapped
  reservoirs of wisdom. They are not. They were quite unable to give him the
  knowledge, understanding and responsive imaginations necessary to convert his
  magnificent gestures of social and economic reconstruction into a working
  reality.</p>

  <p>I went, a traveling note of interrogation, from him to Stalin, because I
  realized that the same insufficiency of mental resources and support which
  was baffling the American President, the lack of any adequate mass and
  structure of administrative knowledge in the state, must also be crippling
  the socialist thrust in Russia. Was Russia meeting or attempting to meet that
  difficulty? In some way of its own? And in Russia I found Gorky in a dream of
  Russia's greatness, unfolding the plans of non-existent universities to my
  incredulous eyes, and nothing else but intolerant dogmatists and intriguing
  commissars.</p>

  <p>Both Roosevelt and Stalin were attempting to produce a huge, modern,
  scientifically organized, socialist state, the one out of a warning crisis
  and the other out of a chaos, and the lack of a brain organization to give
  that state consciousness and coherence was a difference not in nature, but
  degree.</p>

  <p>The brain organization of the United States is not up to its new job. It
  needs to be revised, expanded, turned round to face the future. I have
  compared the head structure of the Russian giant to the brain of a newt. To
  carry on the biological analogy, the knowledge and will structures of the
  United States seem, to be somewhere about the level of a horse. It has a
  cerebrum all right; it remembers almost too well within a limited range, it
  shies at shadows, stampedes very readily, and has no particular zeal for
  learning new things. Something very much better than that is demanded.</p>

  <p>For the great, closely-organized, human community that socialism
  contemplates, a World Brain is essential The third aspect of a complete
  democracy is a tremendous educational expansion, that not only opens the way
  to the White House to Everyman but gives him the necessary mental equipment,
  if he can use it, to get there. Such an educational organization has been
  latent in America for a century and a half. The fathers of the Republic were
  not unmindful of it. In every state, land was set aside to supply the
  endowment for a state university, and sometimes that turned out well, and
  sometimes it did not. In addition, there were older endowments of the British
  type, and fresh benefactions expanded these and added to their number. The
  whole community was concentrated upon that fascinating dollar hunt, but when
  one of the winners felt public-spirited and generous, it seemed a fine thing
  to him to get some more knowledge and education for the people. And being
  essentially a business man, he went and bought the stuff; he bought the best
  in the market; and it did not occur to him&mdash;and why should
  it?&mdash;that America might be in need of something at least as new and
  distinctive of her as the great business plants and concentrations that he
  and his fellow-magnates were, with such vivid immediate success and such
  ultimate bad consequences, making. So that the extensive and complicated
  university system of America remained essentially European, first upon the
  British pattern and then with an increasing German influence. To this day it
  clings to the medieval cap and gown, the degree-giving and medieval lecturing
  of the old world.</p>

  <p>Dollar preoccupation was almost as effective in leaving unchallenged the
  ascendancy of Europe and European patterns in the world of thought and
  artistic creation. Boston, which had played a vigorous part in British
  intellectual life in colonial days, resented this acceptance of inferiority,
  but until well into the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the European
  ascendancy was tacitly admitted in the rest of America. Lowell might complain
  of a "certain air of condescension" in the visiting English of his time. This
  air of condescension had this much justification that in many strata of the
  American world it was accepted. There were insurgent spirits and many
  protests indeed, but the War of Independence only reached the realm of
  literary criticism towards the turn of the century, and then it came as a
  great shock to the British writers of my generation, who had taken the
  American tribute for granted. Today no young American writer would dream of
  sedulously imitating or indeed resembling a British model. And in many fields
  of thought, the new history and sociological speculation for example,
  individual minds broke into distinctive American methods. Some thirty odd
  years ago the American climate, by way of a protest, killed all the cherished
  ivy on those red-bricked colleges, but it did nothing further in the matter.
  To this day the shape of the knowledge organization and education, and
  particularly of the higher education, remains in precisely the same state of
  picturesque headlessness and material ineffectiveness as the older,
  natural-grown, European disorder of institutions. The erection of facsimile
  buildings, Magdalen Tower in Chicago, for example, is merely the extreme
  expression of this reverential attitude.</p>

  <p>The United States, let alone the world, cannot carry on now with an
  unorganized mentality, a scattered higher education that has no power over
  the press or the common schools or political consciences. It produces no
  adequate civil service, no well-informed and easily co-operative
  administrators. It cannot compass any of the major problems before the
  nation. The resort of the undergraduate world to the realities of the playing
  fields is a sure indication of the un-attractiveness of its array of
  subjects. They yell. Every university has a yell. And well may they yell and
  go wild and frantic in their stadiums, for their lives and their powers are
  being largely wasted.</p>

  <p>Yet it is in America now that the clearest hope for a beginning of that
  World Brain resides. A country habituated to the rapid development of vast
  commercial and industrial enterprises must surely be capable of attempting an
  intellectual and educational enterprise beyond the imagination of men bred in
  smaller and more tradition-ridden communities. So far it has been impossible
  to awaken any influential and resourceful people to this patent, if
  unprecedented necessity. It is unhappily so novel that they seem afraid to
  realize how obvious it is and unavoidable. There is no time to lose about it.
  It is hard to guess what may happen when this abnormal phase of personal
  government by one inspired, insufficiently able man of genius comes to an
  end. There is no one to replace him and nothing to replace him. Nothing is
  being prepared. America may relapse in quite a little time into something as
  acephalous and incalculable as Russia.</p>

  <p>And so I return to my refrain: "We need a World Brain," and to my
  insistence that the creation of a greater mental superstructure to reorient
  the mind of the world is an entirely practicable proposal.</p>

  <p>At this point I imagine an angry critic interrupts. He has been skimming
  through this book&mdash;he wouldn't deign to read it or mark the course of
  its argument&mdash;looking for occasion for offense. And now he cries: "Who
  are you, Mr. Know-all, to tell us that all these splendid institutions.
  Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Chicago, Johns Hopkins and a multitude of
  others, and abroad Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, London, Coimbra, Upsala,
  Tokio&mdash;one could count a thousand galaxies of clustering colleges and
  dreaming spires&mdash;and all these wise and good men, thousands of them, men
  of eminent learning, men of distinguished character, doctors, teachers,
  investigators, scholars, not one who is not in every respect a far better man
  than yourself, that all together they amount to nothing! that this great
  constellation, this veritable shining skyful of gifts and powers is not
  sufficient for the needs of the world today! that altogether it amounts to no
  more, scale for scale&mdash;what did you say?&mdash;than the brain of a
  horse! that it needs something far more powerful, some far vaster embodiment
  of knowledge and purpose&mdash;some queer fad of yours?"</p>

  <p>To which I answer: What are they doing now? So far from lighting the
  world, the skies are so overcast that these starry constellations seem
  scarcely to be shining.</p>

  <p>And far from being "Mr. Know-all," I am in helpless ignorance, in a sea of
  unconscious ignorance. There is one thing, and one thing only, I know, that
  you do not seem to know, and that is this&mdash;that neither you nor I know
  enough nor know the little that we do know well enough, to meet the needs of
  the world's occasions. Unless we do something about this ignorance of ours,
  this universal blinkered ignorance, we shall be overwhelmed, we shall destroy
  one another.</p>

  <p>If only some small fraction of the still considerable wealth and energy of
  America could be turned not merely to a campaign against the ignorance of
  others but against its own far more dangerous ignorance; if only this
  absolute necessity for an organized World Brain, a gigantic but still
  possible super-university, set above all these admirable but ineffective
  scattered foundations to utilize and consolidate them, if only that could
  fire the imagination of a few energetic spirits; then the whole outlook of
  the human species might still be changed.</p>

  <p>There is a last possibility to consider in this survey. Some such appeal
  as I am making may presently gather force, attract a measure, but an
  insufficient measure, of support and not enough critical attention. The thing
  may be tried, the effort may be made, and, as people say, it may fall into
  the wrong hands. Instead of a living World Brain we may have a sham World
  Brain. The effort may be made. Money may be forthcoming; the demand may grow.
  Something to look like a world encyclopaedic organization may be brought into
  being, good enough to pacify most of the clamor, good enough for those people
  who say you cannot have everything at once&mdash;you must have a beginning.
  When embryonic tissue cannot build an organ it can still produce a cancer. We
  may have some large and plausible organization of platitudes, irrelevances
  and compromises, as adequate as an organization of knowledge as the old
  League of Nations was of world peace. There may be great academic comings and
  goings, ceremonies and solemn consecrations.</p>

  <p>And at last something in the nature of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler and
  President Grover Whalen will appear enthroned, side by side, organizers of
  the World Brain triumphant, the World Brain of Tomorrow, brooding profoundly
  over the unmitigated destiny of mankind.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Cf. <i>The Columbia Encyclopedia</i>.</p>

  <p>That may be. The history of most religions supports this possibility.
  There is nothing whatever between the stars and the atoms to show why the end
  of <i>Homo sapiens</i> should not be absurd as well as tragic. The price of
  human salvation is eternal vigilance, incessant fearless criticism and
  unrestricted wit. How can one tell beforehand whether that price will be
  forthcoming? Without unrestrained free speech and irreverence, how can we
  defeat the universal human tendency to be satisfied with and tolerant towards
  plausible, pretentious things? There can be no rest, no tactful
  acquiescences, no mental toleration, no enfeebling politeness, in the
  <i>Kulturkampf</i> ahead, if man is to escape the evils that close in upon
  him.</p>

  <p>In the design of this book three primary themes interlace and pursue and
  develop each other. There is first, that invention and science have
  completely altered the material environment of human life. Next, that the
  disruptive driving-force of an excess of bored and unemployed young men,
  which must in some manner find relief, will probably shatter human life
  altogether under the new conditions. And thirdly, that the existing mental
  organization of our species is entirely insufficient to control the present
  situation, which nevertheless might, with an adequate effort, be controlled.
  These are the Change of Scale theme, the Youth Pressure theme and the World
  Brain theme. The first two create the problem to which the third indicates
  the only possible solution.</p>

  <p>About the role of those young men; its cardinal importance is still not
  recognized plainly by sociologists, historians and writers of contemporary
  history. In practice, however, it is plainly apprehended, and a very
  considerable amount of propaganda to capture the imagination of this vital
  stratum is carried on, and particularly by the more aggressive contemporary
  states. They pursue their co-nationals abroad, and make strenuous efforts to
  win over opinion in neutral states and bring local conditions into
  parallelism with their own. Nazi patterns are being studied in South Africa,
  for example, and we have noted the Fascist disposition of General Chiang Kai
  Shek. There is a great totalitarian propaganda, and now, awakening and
  responding to it, there is counter-propaganda.</p>

  <p>On the whole the totalitarians make the more exciting and attractive
  promises and give the brooding young man the most immediate prospect of
  authorized masterful activities. Official Great Britain pays the dole and
  encourages no presumptuous hopes. But in America and elsewhere there is a
  definitely anti-Fascist organization called the World Youth movement. This
  is a brotherhood and fundamentally a pacifist organization, a combination of
  a great number of more specialized associations, which attempts to bring the
  opinions and demands of the young for security from massacre and for
  employment, training, adult education, health culture and so forth, to bear
  upon governing and administrative bodies, and exert a critical, helpful and
  mediatory influence upon their social welfare work. It has the open support
  of both the President and his wife, more particularly of Mrs. Roosevelt, and
  it extends its liaison work into most of the so-called democracies&mdash;and
  Russia. Its activities vary with the country and occasion, but its general
  objective is to keep its young people busy with work of public importance,
  developing their capacity with use and experience. This World Youth movement
  claims to represent and affect the politico-social activities of a grand
  total of forty million adherents&mdash;under the age of thirty. Of these,
  twelve million are credited to Russia, though I cannot imagine how these
  figures are checked. It includes also a number of War Resisters whose ideas
  stop short at a repudiation of war. They will have nothing to do with war,
  but how human affairs are to be carried on in a warless world they do not
  trouble to think. Anyone else can bother about that, it seems, not they. They
  carry passive resistance to the pitch of know-nothingness. With a certain
  disapproval they offer us their bodies to be protected and their mouths to be
  fed.</p>

  <p>I mention the World Youth Movement here, but I am quite unable to estimate
  its possibilities. It may fade out It may play an important and increasing
  role in the consolidation of a new world order.</p>

  <p>The President and Mrs. Roosevelt, though they seem acutely aware that a
  developing Youth Movement may play an important part in the political drama
  of tomorrow, have neither of them betrayed any consciousness of the immense
  intellectual reorientation of which the world is now in such urgent need.
  Their circumstances have never directed their attention to that. I doubt if
  these two fine, active minds have ever inquired how it is they know what they
  know and think as they do. Nor have they ever thought of what they might have
  been if they had grown up in an entirely different culture. They have the
  disposition of all politicians the world over to deal only with made opinion.
  They have never inquired how it is that opinion is made.</p>

  <p>The only representative of Youth I have ever met who seemed to be aware
  that they were under-educated and improperly educated were some Burmans I met
  in Rangoon. "We are taught to be clerks in European-owned factories," they
  complained. "What we want is technical knowledge and the science of our own
  country and circumstances so as to give us a clear conception of our role in
  the world...."</p>

  <p>Now that was saying something.*</p>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">&sect;23. &mdash; THREE FACTORS IN EVERYONE</a></h2>

  <p>WE have now exposed, in stripped outline, the primary factors in world
  affairs at the present time. In all these matters I have written with the
  complete freedom of a biologically trained and uncontrolled observer. Sir
  Arthur Salter, for example, in his <i>Security. Can We Retrieve It?</i>
  (1939), writes with all the discretions and reserves of a responsible
  politician who has to think and speak within the conventions that I, in my
  entire irresponsibility, can repudiate and kick aside. His thoughts are
  capped and gowned and mine are stark. He has an air of scarcely recognizing
  the realities I assemble. Nevertheless, his intelligence and integrity are
  manifestly forcing him towards a conception of public policy and the human
  future essentially the same as those I have stated concisely and brutally
  here.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See <a href="#note23a"><i>Note 23A</i></a> for a
  quotation from his Epilogue.</p>

  <p>The cultural summaries made in the preceding sections from &sect; 11
  onward may be offensive to many readers, if only because of their plainness,
  but they have been made with deliberation, they have been sustained when
  necessary by citation, and they will be much easier to run away from than to
  disprove. The political map is imposed upon these primary factors and more or
  less conditioned by them, very much as it is imposed upon a contoured
  physical map of the world. It entirely distorts the truth to attempt to
  reduce this complex struggle for existence to any left and right antagonism.
  At the maximum simplification we have still to distinguish three absolutely
  divergent trends in ourselves and in the world about us. Each of these trends
  has its variations, but these variations can be put very easily as species
  under one or other of these three genera. The divergence of the three main
  trends remains complete.</p>

  <p>The first of these trends embodies the inveterate disposition of the
  normal man to accept his immediate circumstances as he finds them and make
  the best of them for himself. He sticks to the creed he is born to or to the
  alternative culture that gives him greater comfort. One might write, indeed,
  not merely the inveterate disposition of the normal man but the inveterate
  disposition of every normal living thing. For the ordinary animal the loss of
  the sense of security releases panic, flight, violence&mdash;vehement and
  usually quite unintelligent efforts to recover the confidence that has
  slipped away. It is only in the human animal, and probably it is only in the
  last two or three thousand years that there has been any disposition to look
  forward, even during a fairly prosperous social phase, beyond the prescribed
  social round, not only to anticipate and arrest danger but also to enlarge,
  enrich and alter life. There is a faint uneasiness. "Man looks before and
  after." For the first time in mental history the quality of reality is
  shifted from the present or from a past-present system to the future. Already
  in this book (&sect; 9) the idea of a rotation of values in time has been
  developed in reference to European thought in the past half-century and with
  an auto-vivisection of one particular sample. Now we are able to envisage
  that forced rotation of the mind as a world phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Everywhere we note a natural, retrospective conservatism, and everywhere
  we have minds reluctantly and inadequately coming about and taking up the
  constructive challenge of the age. Such are the two main antagonistic trends
  in the mental life of the world today. The third trend goes neither backward
  nor forward; it is moral abandon. It is equally regardless of the reactionary
  passive peace desire and of the creative peace impulse. The manifest relapse
  of the world towards lawless warfare and recklessly destructive violence is
  due to the successful blocking of the road to the latter peace by the
  resistance of those who desire the continuance of the former. The deadlock
  between conservative instinct" and creative readjustment releases the
  suppressed beast, the unqualified egotist in the species, from control. It
  can only be recalled to discipline for good and all by the complete triumph
  of the new peace over the old.</p>

  <p>This triangular struggle is going on now not only in the human species as
  a whole but in every intelligent individual among us. It is the essential
  religious struggle of the time. In every one of us there is the disposition
  to acquiesce in the dear, familiar values, faith, creed, patriotism, culture,
  amidst which we began. In every one there stirs the protest against, a
  fatuous surrender to things plainly unstable and unsound; the protest and the
  creative desire even at the price of personal loss and injury. Moments come
  when we feel that we "must speak out." And there is the ever-recalcitrant
  egotism which lies in wait for every phase of perplexity, inducing us to
  abuse every confidence put in us, to snatch the profit and pleasure and
  personal glorification that offer themselves, so that even leadership turns
  insensibly into a clamor for precedence, a jealous tyranny and the betrayal
  of all it set out to serve.</p>

  <p>So it is we are all constituted. "Let him who thinketh he stand, take heed
  lest he fall."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">&sect; 24. &mdash; SUMMARY</a></h2>

  <p>THERE is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really
  meets the needs of the time.</p>

  <p>When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main
  religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are
  sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually
  destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some
  vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide. To the very last moment, in
  spite of falling rafters and bulging walls, men and women cling to the houses
  in which they were born and to the ways to which they have grown accustomed.
  At the most they scuttle into the house opposite or the house next door. They
  accuse each other of straining the partitions, overtaxing the material; they
  attack the people over the way for secret mining operations. They cannot
  believe such stresses can continue. The city is still sound enough, they say,
  if it is not too severely tried. At any pause in the wreckage they say "What
  did I tell you? It's all over. Now we can feel safe again," and when at last
  they realize the inevitability and universality of disaster, most of them
  have become too frantic to entertain the bare possibility of one supreme
  engineering effort that might yet intercept those seeping waters that have
  released the whole mountainside to destruction.</p>

  <p>Such a salvaging of the species is still just possible. That is as much as
  the most hopeful mind can say.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">&sect; 25. &mdash; IMPOSSIBILITY OF UTOPIANISM</a></h2>

  <p>IN a previous section (&sect; 10) I have given my reasons for and against
  believing that this creative world peace I have shown to be possible, will be
  achieved in time to save our species from disaster. I fluctuate, I admit,
  between at the best a cautious and qualified optimism and my persuasion of
  swiftly advancing, irretrievable disaster. Now let me assemble the probable
  experiences before our children in the event of such a conclusive frustration
  of democratic and progressive hope.</p>

  <p>This is a much easier task than an attempt to forecast a progressive
  triumph. Upon that it would be possible to speculate only in the most general
  terms. What the human intelligence, no longer hag-rid, released from that
  abject fear of change that has restrained it through the ages, what the
  released and implemented creative imagination of thousands of millions of
  free and happily active individuals might achieve, is beyond any
  anticipating. At the utmost we can produce words like vacant frames and empty
  showcases, to indicate that undelivered wealth. We can talk of unhampered and
  unhurrying swiftness of realization, of universal variety, of abundance and
  balanced beauty. We are forced to take refuge as St. Paul did, when he evaded
  the greedy materialism of those who demanded a bodily resurrection from him,
  in "eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of
  man to conceive"....</p>

  <p>It is impossible to foretell what the liberated human mind may produce,
  but at least we can foretell one certain reaction to what is given here.
  There are those who cling with an obstinate willfulness to the persuasion
  that a unified world must be a uniform and stagnating world. It is
  ridiculous, but they manage to believe it. "Horrible monotony," they say,
  "stress and servitude. Bolshevik tyranny. Prigs' Paradise," and nothing will
  dissuade them.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See, for example, Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New
  World</i>.</p>

  <p>Many, I am persuaded, feel an intense jealousy of the possibility of a
  state of affairs better and happier than their own. It is an intolerable
  thought for the greedier sort of mind that there should be any possible life
  finer than the one they live, a finer life that they will never share and
  which indeed they would be incapable of sharing. Their reaction to all
  forecasts and Utopias, possible or impossible, is self-protective hatred.
  They interrupt; they leap out with "That wouldn't suit me!" As indeed it
  would not. How inevitable is that uncomfortable, protesting laugh: "I'm glad
  I shan't have to live in this dreadful, tidied-up, drab, <i>ordered</i> world
  of yours."</p>

  <p>The congratulations are mutual. I won't even ask you, Madam, to read in

  <p>On the other hand, mankind in defeat and decadence involves no great
  probabilities of mental novelty. There is nothing to alarm your self-
  complacency in that. It is the world we live in now, only a little farther on
  and a little more so. We need not speculate outside the traditional, limited,
  human stuff, that dear old "unchanging human nature" of the past twenty or
  thirty thousand years. And to that we will now apply ourselves.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">&sect; 26. &mdash; DECADENT WORLD</a></h2>

  <p>IT was becoming evident to everyone that the present state of affairs
  could not continue. The greater part of mankind was living in the immediate
  fear of sudden, undeclared war. At any time, by night or day, with less than
  an hour's notice, the screaming sirens and the high explosive and incendiary
  bombs were expected to burst about us. Every other occupation was
  subordinated to the ill-conceived exigencies of air-raid precautions, and an
  ever-increasing proportion of our human and material resources was pouring
  into military preparations. Almost every intelligent human being and every
  township and community in Eurasia was in a state of mental tension which was
  rapidly approaching the breaking-point. Suicides were increasing. Lucid
  thinking became offensive and intolerable. People attacked and persecuted one
  another on flimsy excuses. Because of the limited and distorted idea systems
  in which they are living, they were, as we have seen in &sect;&sect; 11 to
  22, incapable of setting about the necessary readjustments of relationship.
  We have dismissed any such outbreak of sanity, therefore, as improbable.
  There is no basis on which it can start. There will be no world unification,
  because our species is too distraught and divided for anything of the
  sort.</p>

  <p>What seems much more likely is a lapse into actual warfare, red war, on a
  planetary scale. This will not be a clearly conceived war carried out with
  the intention of establishing a world peace. Governments will pretend it is
  that, but fundamentally it will be a fit of frantic violence with no rational
  objective whatever. The first offensive was just as likely to come from the
  so-called "democratic" as from the "dictator" side.</p>

  <p>As we have shown quite clearly by an appeal to manifest facts, the
  threefold forces making for conflict are to be found busily active in every
  existing human community&mdash;the evil patriotic and religious traditions,
  the horribly magnified weapons, the relative excess of unemployed young
  men&mdash;but the states where the pressure of these forces, because they
  were most pent up, has produced its maximum effect in menace and belligerent
  gestures, will be marked as the aggressor states. They will be assailed by a
  loose alliance of incongruous countries animated by the diverse motive
  systems we have scrutinized, and agreed only upon the need of suppressing
  these desperado nations. The ensuing war is likely to be briefer but far more
  violently destructive than the previous world war, because while that war
  began at a level of equipment which permitted a steady increase in the supply
  of munitions almost to the end when the losers collapsed through material and
  moral exhaustion, the combatants this time start from the beginning at
  something like a maximum of armament, and will reach the breaking-point much
  earlier. Staying power will decide the formal victory, which is less likely
  to be decisive even than the surrender of the eleventh of November, 1918.</p>

  <p>The material and moral destruction of the actual warfare will certainly be
  enormous. The population stratum of military age will be largely killed,
  mutilated, poisoned or mentally unbalanced, and after it, will come a
  generation or so, which has been more and more undernourished,
  under-educated, demoralized and mentally distorted, as the concentration upon
  preparation (guns for butter) and the actual stress, noise and disorder of
  the conflict, have made a normal growth impossible for them. Vast resources
  of power will have been wasted for good and all, and the land and the sea
  bottom will be littered with smashed-up aeroplanes, shattered tanks, twisted
  railway trucks, burnt-out aerodromes and a great abundance of sunken ships
  and stores. Exoduses of population hardly less frightful than battle routs
  will have dislocated all sanitary balances, and famine and its follower,
  pestilence, will have swept the world. Even the influenza epidemic which
  followed the previous Great War killed more people than were actually slain
  in battle. This time the sanitary disorganization will certainly be much
  greater and the possibilities of morbid infections far more various. Probably
  there will be a deliberate spraying of disease germs to assist this, more
  natural mischief. There will have been much gratuitous bombing of cities.
  There will have been a great burning and smashing-up of human habitations
  which no one will have had energy to replace, and such a destruction of
  beautiful buildings, works of art and irreplaceable loveliness of all sorts,
  as will make the feats of the Huns and Vandals seem mere boyish mischief. All
  that lies plainly ahead.</p>

  <p>And when at last one side admits defeat, and peace is proclaimed upon the
  world battlefield, what will be the situation? The defeated will be treated
  as the incurably guilty parties. If that were so, if there were incurably
  malignant peoples, then the wholesome thing to do would be to massacre them
  carefully and completely. Mankind will balk at that.</p>

  <p>Instead of any such biologically conclusive settlement, there will be,
  once again, a punitive peace. The victors, to the best of their ability, will
  make the losers pay. The losers will be quite unable to pay. Further punitive
  measures will then become necessary. Modern war is a very impartial process,
  and the victors will probably have suffered quite as much and even more
  material and social devastation than the vanquished. They will be in no mind
  for generosity. No country in the world, even those that have preserved a
  technical neutrality, alert under arms, will emerge from the storm at
  anything like the level of civilization at which it stands today. There will
  be less freedom of speech, less opportunity to speak freely, far more fear
  and far more danger of frantic mass impulses.</p>

  <p>In &sect;&sect; 11 to 22 there has been an attempt to estimate the general
  trend of the main idea systems of the world. Here we may recapitulate the
  conclusions to which that survey points. What is going on now?</p>

  <p>A very considerable festering of minds is no doubt occurring. People arc
  reading and thinking feverishly but they are often thinking wrong and with an
  assisted wrong-headedness. Patriotic and religious teachings surround them,
  and subtle and insidiously mischievous suggestions. The arts of propaganda in
  enemy countries improve rapidly. There is no country in the world where
  enemies are not sowing tares with constantly increasing effectiveness. Every
  form of discontent is fomented with a skill and energy worthy of a better
  cause. The suggestions of desperate and destructive revolt that men may fear
  to whisper to their neighbors, will come to them from abroad.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the break-up of the British Imperial system in face of a
  complex of insurrectionary movements, troubles on which the sun will never
  set, has a high degree of probability. The conflict of the new Nazi religion
  with Catholicism is plain and open, we have studied it in the ingenuous
  speculations of Mr. Teeling, and beneath the surface of most of the
  established systems of today, some queer development of social dissent is
  latent. The present ebb of communism is no end to insurrectionary class war.
  It is muttering vaguely, it may be unorganized and criminal, but it will be
  none the less socially destructive. We have noted the waning charm of the
  Italian dictatorship and the lamentable tendency of original sin to emerge as
  murder and fanatical cruelty under the very shadow of obscurantist Christian
  teaching. Where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken the pronunciamento
  flourishes with undiminished vitality.</p>

  <p>America has a transitory unity and stability under the protean aspects of
  the New Deal, but no one knows what will follow when the extremely personal
  direction of Franklin Roosevelt ceases. There may be a heavily financed drive
  to put back the New Deal and return to a hard-faced business individualism.
  Big business has used some rough methods in the past and may resort to still
  rougher methods again&mdash;in an atmosphere that has become much less
  tolerant of the old forms of firmness. Not without reason do Americans talk
  of their Bourbons. That once unorganized alien labor has become assimilated
  and unified and more capable of meeting pseudo-legal violence with
  extra-legal violence. The country that produced Franklin Roosevelt also
  produced at the same time Huey Long and an unprecedented regime of gangster
  terrorism. And in the same period came the revival and the suppression of the
  intimidations of the Ku Klux Klan. Things have a way of beginning in America,
  running large and rank, and then coming suddenly to an end. This applies to
  evil and hopeful things alike. Everything may occur in some part of the
  United States or another, and the country may still retain an apparent unity.
  With a strong personality the White House may concentrate the nation, as it
  were, into one mind; with a less vigorous head that federal unification
  relaxes and the continental expanse is revealed as a miscellany of divergent
  issues. War and Roosevelt might impose a temporary national personality upon
  the United States that would vanish again in a subsequent reaction, giving
  place to a state of affairs as incoherent and variegated as Europe. The
  apparent solidarity of the United States may be as personal as any
  dictatorship; it may be accidental and not essential.</p>

  <p>The question of what will come after Roosevelt opens a vista of localized
  possibilities varying between dull conflict, boss rule and chaotic violence,
  and the corresponding question of what will come after Stalin opens up not a
  vista but darkness. We have weighed up the uncertainties of China and Japan,
  and there too there is no assurance of stability and many intimations of
  degenerative revolution. A Japanese collapse would probably disintegrate
  China again, for nothing but patriotism holds China together.</p>

  <p>So we have left as the main factors in the settlement after the second
  world war, a patchwork of staggering governments ruling over a welter of
  steadily increasing social disorganization. The settlement after the next
  world war will be only a prelude to further conflict. Informal warfare will
  succeed the formal struggle. What else can happen? Victors and vanquished
  will go to pieces and rearrange themselves. There is no body of ideas in
  existence, no tradition or frame of a world law to which an appeal can be
  made, that can carry on the shattered, mentally and morally overstrained, but
  still heavily armed combatants to any sort of world synthesis. The seizures
  and pronunciamentos that followed the Treaty of Versailles will recur more
  abundantly and on a more sustained and uncontrollable scale.</p>

  <p>Since any new synthesis is improbable, the names of the existing main
  political systems are likely to continue long after they have lost any real
  authority, just as the idea of the Empire prevailed among the barbarians in
  the Dark Ages. The Union Jack, the Swastika, the Cross, or the Stars and
  Stripes may still float over a thousand dissociated gangs and tribes,
  claiming its authority, just as the Roman Eagle survived as a legally
  dominating reality in man's imaginations, side by side with the Church, long
  after Rome was sacked.</p>

  <p>Now it may be thought that so much political and social dissolution may
  mean an ebb of invention and a break-up of the industrial organizations that
  supply the destructive apparatus which is smashing up the existing order so
  rapidly and uncontrollably. The human process will go back, it may be
  fancied, to a mechanically feeble barbarism, and a new system of expanding
  states may finally reconstruct civilization. It will be the Dark Ages over
  again, a planetary instead of a merely European Dark Ages. <i>Homo
  sapiens</i> will be given a second opportunity. There will be a return to
  primitive home-made weapons, non-mechanical transport, a new age if not of
  innocence yet of illiteracy, and slow, feeble and less lethal mischiefs will
  return to the world. But history never repeats itself, ecological processes
  are irreversible, and there are many considerations that make it improbable
  that the new barbarism which is coming upon us will have even a material
  resemblance to the barbarism of sixteen centuries ago. It will be much
  tougher, with a livelier and wickeder intelligence, and it will retain a far
  more destructive equipment.</p>

  <p>Because it is proving impossible to assemble and organize knowledge and
  sane ideas for the establishment of a world civilization, it does not follow
  that knowledge already scattered about the earth will be destroyed. It may
  become generally inaccessible and secret, but it may continue available in
  workable fragments to a number of enterprising people, A vast store of
  metallurgical and industrial technique was completely lost with the downfall
  of the Roman Empire,* but then the record of principles and processes was
  very flimsy and vulnerable.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Rendered rather vividly in George Gissing's
  <i>Veranilda</i>.</p>

  <p>Many technical secrets were never written at all and none were printed.
  Even down to the past century that sort of thing went on; a number of the
  processes in Wedgwood's china factory, for example, were transmitted verbally
  from one worker to another. Some of the older men carried secrets with them
  to the grave, and an analytical chemist had to be called in and the processes
  laboriously rediscovered before the firm could go on producing its
  characteristic wares. That was a survival of old-world methods. Under such
  conditions the old techniques disappeared in a generation or so. But nowadays
  scientific and technical knowledge is embodied in so huge a number of printed
  and widely distributed publications, the body of people in contact with those
  records is so large and varied, that even in a world of deepening and
  extensive disorder, it will still be possible to assemble knots and groups of
  men capable of carrying on the production of most of the lethal devices now
  in use. Postal and railway organization may go to pieces, newspapers
  disappear, roads become impassable and gas supply, drainage, and public
  lighting cease, because such things depend upon a widespread social
  co-operation, and still there may be radio transmission, aeroplanes and high
  explosives, which do not demand anything like the same general
  participation.</p>

  <p>It does not follow that mechanisms and contrivances will disappear in
  reverse order to that in which they appeared. It may have taken long years of
  research and the contribution of thousands of scientific workers to discover
  an explosive or a poison, but when that has been attained only a recipe and
  material are needed for its production. It has become a part of "our human
  heritage."</p>

  <p>This is evident for example in the steady increase of bomb-making and
  bomb-throwing in the world. It is a growing feature of the normal social
  life. Every morning now we read in our newspapers of the young braves of the
  Irish Republican Army throwing their cheap but effective bombs in Great
  Britain, the Jew boys and the Arab boys bomb each other with ever-increasing
  zeal and bloodier results, bomb outrages comment on the new regime in Spain,
  they multiply in India, in the occupied areas of China. In a world of
  deepening misunderstandings and grievances, there is no reason to doubt that
  they will become as common as road accidents and as little thought of, a part
  of the normal give and take of politics. People will harden their hearts to
  their consequences until the bomb comes to themselves, and then their
  enlightenment will be too late.</p>

  <p>The world emerging from the next great war, then, will be a tougher world,
  more disunited than ever, abounding still more in concealed aims and secret
  preparations and the fears and suspicions they engender. What else can it be?
  The open forum of the scientific world will have disappeared and the
  suggestion of any cosmopolitan ideas will have been suppressed, as a
  weakening of combatant morale. In every country. For the neutral powers, if
  any remain, will still have had to be mentally as well as materially
  "prepared-" Human beings who can do nothing else to gratify their craving to
  exercise power, love to suppress and help suppression.</p>

  <p>No doubt great numbers of people will have felt the irrational evil of all
  this shrinking of thought into strategic holes and corners, but they will
  have had less and less, opportunity of getting together, or even clearing up
  their own minds sufficiently to take effective action. Many of them, under
  the stress of their conscious helplessness, will lapse into mystical
  religiosity, will refuse to bear children, will resort to suicide or the
  quasi-suicide of non-resistance. Many will take refuge in opiates. The
  Japanese are doing their utmost to spread the use of opium and heroin among
  the Chinese, and they will probably succeed in affecting their own troops
  also. The ideas and expedients of birth control, now they have spread about
  the earth, will not be easily forgotten.</p>

  <p>More and more will the world be for the tough, for the secretive, the
  treacherous and ruthless. Cities will be dangerous labyrinths and the
  countryside an exposure to attack. Ever and again some group or some
  individual by luck or cunning may achieve a certain width of conquest and
  establish a peace of terror. Subservient millions may rejoice then for awhile
  that at last strong government has come back to the world. They will accept
  an imposed religion, a last revival of Christianity &agrave; la Franco
  perhaps, or of that "clean" Nazi creed, or something on the evangelical lines
  General Chiang Kai Shek seems to favor; they will observe a dictated morality
  and a mutual censorship. Any intellectual revival is improbable. This light
  of free science will have sunken and gone out long since; what remains of
  technical knowledge will be in the safe hands of properly ordained men. The
  first thing a youth attracted to mechanical or medical knowledge will do,
  will be to take orders and put himself under safe direction. History will
  have shriveled down to the Creator myth again, but the popular imagination
  will be titillated and appalled by a dim and dying tradition of a former age,
  our age, of sinful knowledge, of lawless indulgence, of unconsecrated loves,
  of a terrible disrespect for customs and taboos and sacrifices and priests,
  that brought great misfortunes upon mankind. A new "World before the Flood"
  it will be.</p>

  <p>A few secret doubters may exist, bookish, silent, hinting and whispering
  men&mdash; <i>men</i>, for a more "wholesome" use of womankind will leave
  women little time for reading&mdash;who will pore guiltily over the
  unfulfilled promises of a golden age to come, in the old books which men
  wrote when they still had pride and hope. There may be some wistful
  whisperings, some weak attempts at a new Freemasonry. But the necessary
  adaptation of human thought to turn the tide of decadence is something too
  wide and open in its nature to be brought about by any sort of secret
  organization. What can be done by timid men who are forced to squeak and
  scamper like mice behind the arras?</p>

  <p>Art may have an Indian summer. The dictator may even build some fine
  buildings&mdash;for most of them build&mdash;monasteries, cathedrals,
  palaces, before he passes. There may be portrait painting and portrait pieces
  of an ennobling type, glorified history, an effort at a technically lower
  level to recall the Venetian bravura of Titian, Tintoretto and Paul Veronese.
  At any rate we shall not live to see that last Art Age. Then, because there
  will be no correction for the material stresses of a static system, the
  darkness will close in again. There will be peasant revolts, an exhausting
  war or dynastic trouble. So human affairs have gone in the past, and so,
  without any fundamental change in human mentality, they must continue to go,
  so long as they go on at all.</p>

  <p>The coming barbarism will differ from the former barbarism by its greater
  powers of terror, urgency and destruction, and by its greater rapidity of
  wastage. What other difference can there be without a mental renascence? The
  average life will be steadily diminishing, health will be deteriorating. The
  viruses and pestilential germs will resume their experiments in variation,
  and new blotches and infections will give scope for pious resignation and
  turn men's hearts again towards a better world beyond the stars. There will
  be a last crop of saints and devotees. Mankind which began in a cave and
  behind a windbreak will end in the disease-soaked ruins of a slum. What else
  can happen? What other turn can destiny take?</p>

  <p>If <i>Homo sapiens</i> is such a fool that he cannot realize what is
  before him now and set himself urgently to save the situation while there is
  still some light, some freedom of thought and speech, some freedom of
  movement and action left in the world, can there be the slightest hope that
  in fifty or a hundred years hence, after he has been through two or three
  generations of accentuated fear, cruelty and relentless individual
  frustration, with ever diminishing opportunity of apprehending the real
  nature of his troubles, he will be collectively any less of a fool? Why
  should he undergo a magic change when all the forces, within him as without,
  are plainly set against it?</p>

  <p>There is no reason whatever to believe that the order of nature has any
  greater bias in favor of man than it had in favor of the icthyosaur or the
  pterodactyl. In spite of all my disposition to a brave looking optimism, I
  perceive that now the universe is bored with him, in turning a hard face to
  him, and I see him being carried less and less intelligently and more and
  more rapidly, suffering as every ill-adapted creature must suffer in gross
  and detail, along the stream of fate to degradation, suffering and death.</p>

  <p>That, compactly, is the human outlook, the only possible alternative to
  the willful and strenuous adaptation by re-education of our species
  now&mdash;forthwith&mdash;that I am urging in this book. Adapt or perish,
  that is and always has been the implacable law of life for all its children.
  Either the human imagination and the human will to live, rises to the plain
  necessity of our case, and a renascent <i>Homo sapiens</i> struggles on to a
  new, a harder and a happier world dominion, or he blunders down the slopes of
  failure through a series of unhappy phases, in the wake of all the monster
  reptiles and beasts that have flourished and lorded it on the earth before
  him, to his ultimate extinction. Either life is just beginning for him or it
  is drawing very rapidly to its close. This is no guess that is put before
  you, no fantasy; it is a plain and reasoned assembling of known facts in
  their natural order and relationship. It faces you. Meet it or shirk it, this
  is the present outlook for mankind.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note4a"
     name="note4a"><b>Note 4A.</b></a> A shrinkage of the gross population, one
     may note, under the new conditions, though it foreshadows an ultimate
     biological defeat, does not in itself compensate for that superfluity of
     unemployed and dangerously restless young men stressed in the preceding
     paragraphs. It does nothing to stabilize the community. Not merely
     increased productivity per head due to technical progress but also the
     prolonged activity of skilled older people will still be diminishing
     employment and the young man's prospects of normal assuagement. A falling
     birth rate or for that matter a rising one is no relief for that primary
     social tension, which is essentially a matter of proportion and not of
     scale. An island community of a few hundred people will still be unstable
     if it includes a few dozen young men with nothing definite to do.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note6a"
     name="note6a"><b>Note 6A.</b></a> It is true that in Great Britain there
     are certain organizations, the Plebs League, for instance, and the
     Workers' Educational Association, which owe their existence to the
     realization that the traditional education, meeting as it does the
     requirements for upper and middle class survival, may not be entirely
     adequate for the needs of an awakening democracy. But in practice there is
     little of the interrogative and creative spirit of science in the work of
     these quasi-rebel bodies. A rash conceit of finality pervades them. One
     need only turn over the pages of Plebs to realize the glib, trite
     omniscience of its attitude. The aim throughout is not knowledge but
     equipment for the political class war; it is to assemble and supply
     predigested controversial material for the Labor politician (research!),
     prepare and train "speakers" for the Labor cause, and sustain the profound
     satisfaction of its clientele in such education as they have already
     derived from the general atmosphere of their upbringing. At a Royal
     Society Dinner one can stand up and say "We are all self-confessed
     ignorant men, our common aim is inquiry and better knowledge; we want to
     know, and that is why we are here together." But that sort of thing would
     provoke either indignation or derision in the Little Bethel of a workers'
     educational gathering. They have the Gospel; they know. Labor is going to
     take over things and the millennium will ensue. The Plebs League, it
     seems, has a doctrinal feud with the kindred Communist Party; I cannot
     understand why. It preaches practically the same stuff. No seminary for
     the missionaries of some eccentric sect was ever more specialized and
     narrow-minded.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note7a"

     this work in any English, American or French review. I have no idea of
     what this attractive-looking publication gives, what it conceals, what it
     may suggest or misrepresent, and short of learning Italian and reading it
     through I do not see how I can find out. No university professor anywhere
     in the world seems to have bothered yet to put a research student or so on
     to this task. But why should he care? Why on earth should he care? It
     would be infringing on journalism. It would be vulgar. There is always
     something more to be done in the best academic tradition about the
     probable sex life of Leonardo da Vinci or the personal resentments of

  <p class="note"><a id="note9c"
     name="note9c"><b>Note 9C.</b></a> "The world-wide English language is
     destined, I think, to serve as the primary medium in this renascence of
     the human spirit. Unquestionably that renascence must ultimately be
     cosmopolitan, but to begin with it is likely to find its fullest and most
     lucid expression in one or the other, or maybe one or two, of the existing
     thought and language systems in the world. What are they? What other
     systems are there? There is the Latin cultural group expressing itself in
     French, Italian and Spanish. In the past French has been the common
     medium, but it is by no means certain that it will remain so as
     intellectual suppression progresses in Italy and Spain. Then there is the
     great Slavonic sprawl whose medium of expression is Russian. There is the
     German system and, last and most widespread and convenient of all, there
     is the English-speaking network. I want to point out to you that for the
     next few decades at any rate, the burthen and responsibility for human
     mental progress or human mental failure will rest principally upon the
     series of communities using the English tongue either as a mother tongue
     or as a cultural language. It is becoming the lingua franca of the
     so-called "democracies." Matters may change later, but that is the present
     state of affairs. These communities are far more free to discuss, learn
     and publish than any other people in the world.<br>
  Germany as an organized country has, for a time at least, withdrawn herself
  from any claim to a share in the moral or intellectual leadership of the
  world. The burning of the books by the Nazis was a symbolical act of
  detachment from the free mentality of mankind. The expulsion of such men of
  science as Einstein and Freud, and the assertion of the racial hallucinations
  of Hitler in place of established ethnology, were practical demonstrations of
  the same withdrawal. Dogmatic nationalism has stamped upon science and free
  thought and the German mind and retired into itself. And so too has the
  Russian. Before the Great War, the Russian language and literature were the
  medium for civilized thought not only throughout Russia but all over the
  Slavonic-speaking world of southwest Europe. In the summer of 1938, just
  before the destruction of Czechoslovakia, I took part in a small conference
  upon Slavonic culture in Prague. It was attended by representatives of all
  the Slav-speaking countries except Poland, and I found that everyone in that
  meeting spoke and liked speaking Russian. But the present Russian government
  has seen fit to sterilize this Russian influence by a systematic suppression
  of free speech, free discussion and free publication. For all practical
  purposes this leaves only the French-and English-speaking systems. The
  French intelligence at its best is lucid, brave and enterprising, still finer
  I think in its quality than any other in the world,, but it works upon a much
  narrower base than the English. The very precision of French deprives it of
  an amplitude of expression of which English is capable. So we come to the
  conclusion that if the human race is not to go on slipping down towards a
  bottomless pit of wars, conquests and exterminations, it must be through the
  rapid and zealous expansion and reorganization of the intellectual and
  education organizations of the English-speaking communities.<br>
  But let me make it clear that when I say English-speaking, I say it without
  any shadow of political propaganda, Anglo-Saxon radicalism, dear-old-
  Englandism, British imperialism or any shallow-wilted stuff of that sort-1 am
  thinking of the things our language carries, and can carry, and not of our
  contemporary "culture." And I think of a flexible language expanding to meet
  every fresh need. English is a very adaptable language; it borrows and
  assimilates words and idioms very freely; and when I speak of the English of
  the future, I have in mind something much more copious and powerful than the
  "correct English" of the academic scholars. It can already narrow down to
  Basic or expand to express a thousand delicate shades of meaning. I think of
  it as stripped of any remaining idiomatic complications with a reformed
  spelling and a continually expanding vocabulary.<br>
  Even now English brings together into one creative fermentation a vast
  diversity of peoples, from the Maori to the Eskimos; it enables an educated
  Indian to talk to an educated Norwegian or an educated West African Negro. It
  can bring all the thought and learning of the world within their
  understanding, as no other language can do. It translates everything of
  importance in every other language under the sun. Its center of gravity is
  now the United States of America, but every several community which
  participates in its free exchanges contributes its distinctive experiences.
  See, for example, how the mental world of Australasia receives practically
  everything that America or Britain can give it, and in return produces great
  men of science, brilliant artists, writers, thinkers... (Adapted from the
  Canberra lecture on <i>The Role Of English In The Development Of The World
  Mind</i>.)</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note10a"
     name="note10a"><b>Note 10A.</b></a> While I was working on this chapter a
     little friend of mine who draws rather cleverly sent me a card to wish me
     a Happy Easter. Below that she had drawn two chicks emerging from their
     eggs with their little heads in gas masks over the legend "Be Prepared." I
     find my little niece's jest rather a grim one. But maybe there is an idea
     in that, a topical touch, for the Nativities they will be setting up next
     Christmas in bomb-devastated Madrid, now that Catholicism has waded
     through blood to its own again. It would be a halfhearted incarnation that
     did not fully share the anxieties and precautions of our distressful
     life.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note10b"
     name="note10b"><b>Note 10B.</b></a> Since the &sect; 10 was first drafted,
     a very revolutionary device has come to hand in Major Muir's invention of
     the "air mine." This is a balloon-sustained mine which can be set adrift
     in the air at any level, and which will drift before the wind until it
     contacts with a plane and destroys it. It is too small to be seen and
     avoided. It can be timed to keep the air for a definite time, a day or a
     week or so, and then explode and come down. These air mines are cheap to
     produce and they could be made quickly and released in enormous
     quantities. So long a.s they were up they would make the air impossible
     for any sort of air transport, civil or military; they would in fact for
     the time being eliminate the air altogether. I have consulted several
     authorities in this matter, and they agree upon its entire practicability.
     But obviously there are considerable obstacles to its being properly tried
     out. The combatant air forces detest the idea. Still there we have the
     possibility of putting the air completely out of action whenever we wish
     it, and of restoring war to its ancient and slower two dimensions.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note11a"
     name="note11a"><b>Note 11A.</b></a> It is the practice of those who find
     the results of scientific inquiry unpalatable, to stigmatize such
     statements as we have assembled here as "cocksure" and declare them as
     dogmatic as any other dogmas. They will make it a personal matter if
     possible, as though I individually had made it all up, or got it wrong,
     and was being rather absurd about it. And then "Yah!", and they think no
     more about these uncongenial things. But I am no more responsible for the
     facts in this book than a telegraph messenger is for the cable he brings,
     I have been simply gathering up undisputed statements, and they remain
     intact, however brilliantly I can be discredited personally.<br>
  Alternatively these recalcitrant spirits will have it that it is science
  which is "cocksure." That is a flat misrepresentation of the scientific
  spirit. Experimental science, natural science&mdash;which is what everyone
  understands by "science" nowadays,&mdash;is never assured and final. That is
  where it differs from all other established systems of belief, and that is
  why I speak of it throughout this book as a new thing in the development of
  human mentality, new within the past century or so. The true symbol of
  natural science is a note of interrogation. A better name would be research.
  It questions until some false assumption is laid bare or destroyed. It tries
  out and rejects or accepts. And still it questions. It is rare that it
  reverses its carefully tested conclusions&mdash;it is another defensive
  invention that "Science is always contradicting itself"&mdash;but continually
  it advances beyond these conclusions and restates with increasing precision
  and enrichment. The utmost the man of science says to the religious dogmatist
  is "In view of this and that, your general statement is unsound," or, "In
  view of this and that it must be untrue."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note11b"
     name="note11b"><b>Note 11B.</b></a> "The number of one's ancestors
     increases as we look back in time. Disregarding the chances of
     intermarriage, each one of us had two parents, four grandparents, eight
     great-grandparents, and so on backward, until very soon, in less than
     fifty generations, we should find that, but for the qualification
     introduced, we should have all the earth's inhabitants of that time as our
     progenitors. For a hundred generations it must hold absolutely true, that
     everyone of that time who has issue living now is ancestral to all of us.
     That brings the thing quite within the historical period. There is not a
     palaeolithic or neolithic relic that is not a family relic for every soul
     alive. The blood in our veins has handled it." (From H. G. Wells. <i>First
     and Last Things</i>, "The Being of Mankind.")<br>
  There are, however, certain qualifications to be made to this statement of
  our common ancestry if it is to pass unchallenged. In every generation there
  is an elimination of half the genetic elements. The individual is not a
  mixture of the total ancestry of his four grandparents. He is a compound of a
  quarter of their genes. And in addition he may be a mutation. Genes are
  transmitted in associated groups, but these groups fall infinitely short of
  carrying a complete personality. They carry traits, but the traits are
  carried separately. In so-and-so we may remark this and that trait of his
  Grandfather William but they are mixed with traits from other progenitors;
  the practical reappearance of Grandfather William is a mathematical
  improbability verging on the impossible. Of all this and how there are
  recessive characteristics masked by dominant ones, but capable of reappearing
  in offspring, the reader will find a dear and full account in The Science of
  Life.<br>
  A common ancestry does not therefore involve a common physiognomy, and at any
  time an individual or a type may turn up in which some once prevalent type
  virtually reappears. Mr. George Bernard Shaw, for example, is a very
  exceptional person today, but Etruscan tombs and potsherds reveal a departed
  world of quasi-George Bernard Shaws. There are quasi-Cromagnards in La
  Dordogne and the Canary Isles today. Certain regions, certain climates, seem
  to attract and favor their own special types and tend to revive them. That
  all English people are descended from William the Conqueror and most of the
  population of the earth from Abraham, implies brotherhood indeed, but not
  uniformity. The fact that if humanity survives so long, everyone alive will
  be the descendant of every fertile individual among us today exposes the
  absurdities of family and national pride, but it does not mean that the dance
  of the genes will not give us an incessantly restored human variety, in which
  every individual will be consciously or unconsciously seeking the region, the
  occupation and the associates most congenial to his make-up.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note12a"
     name="note12a"><b>Note 12A.</b></a> Some of those who, in spite of much
     subsequent enlightenment, still cling, out of natural affection and
     association, to traditions of their home and upbringing that have become a
     dear and necessary part of themselves, take refuge, I know, in the plea
     that the idea of the Chosen People has become altogether spiritualized,
     that they are now segregated not for an ultimate conquest but for a
     mission. Their mission is to serve and exalt all mankind.<br>
  There is moreover another line of sublimation with a bolder appeal, and that
  is the line taken by that great neglected genius, David Lubin, the founder of
  the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome. His Israel was indeed an
  Israel with a mission, but then he claimed everyone who participated in
  constructive work as one of the elect. To Lubin I was an honorary
  Israelite.<br>
  "But why then call it Israel?" I protested.<br>
  This sort of transfiguration of the objectives of the Chosen People is all
  very well in apologetic discussion, but there is nothing to sustain it in the
  normal ceremony and practice and teaching of the cult, which remains a narrow
  and troublesome nationalism. Let these sublimators repudiate the Bible and
  the Promise and say what they mean plainly. Then we shall be better able to
  believe in their assertions of an exalted inaggressive modernization.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note12b"
     name="note12b"><b>Note 12B.</b></a> Louis Golding (in <i>The Jewish
     Problem</i>) argues that anti-Judaism is due to the fact that the Jews
     cried "Crucify him," when Jesus came before Pilate. Jesus, as everybody
     knows, was crucified (a particularly Roman method of execution) not by the
     Jews but by the Roman Pontius Pilate. Countless people who criticize the
     Jews today are extremely impartial about the Crucifixion, and I find it
     difficult to believe that Mr. Golding, who, I presume, is himself a
     product of orthodox Jewish education, is so entirely unaware of the effect
     of this Chosen People cult upon the outside world as he seems to be. He
     ignores it absolutely.<br>
  Browne also, refusing to face that primary issue, accounts for the
  unpopularity of the Jewish community in an entirely different manner. He
  theorizes brilliantly about Jews being urban while non-Jews are rustic.
  Certainly the Semitic-speakers were prevalently urban in the first century
  B.C. The balance, says he, must be corrected and all will be well. So the
  Jew, he decides (1935) had better go to Palestine and dig himself out of his
  troubles. Both writers then launch out into an account of the great
  intellectual superiority of Jews to Gentiles, wholesome rather than
  ingratiating reading for a puffed up Gentile, and cite a, string of names,
  Sigmund Freud, for instance, and Einstein and so on, who are as a matter of
  fact no more orthodox Jews than I am. They are citizens of the world, they
  work for all mankind. Even now Freud is busy, he tells me, in a patient
  analysis of the legend of Moses. Moses, he concludes, was an Egyptian! His
  monotheism was Akhnaton's sun worship. (Moses and Monotheism.)<br>
  Both Golding and Browne are typical of a vast literature on the Jewish
  question. There is no need to multiply instances. Neither, I think, realizes
  quite clearly what it is that encompasses them, because they are themselves
  enveloped in it. They accept this taught and cultivated idea system, this ex-
  religious bias, this artificial solidarity I am arraigning, as though it was
  in the nature of things and could not be prevented, and thence they wander
  off into a limitless jungle of controversial irrelevances, of the rights and
  wrongs of ancient hates, misunderstandings, persecutions and reprisals, to
  which there can be no conclusion.<br>
  But the eloquent and emotional Mr. Josef Kastein, who dedicates his
  <i>History And Destiny Of The Jews</i> quite incongruously to the entirely
  unorthodox Einstein, concludes his Jews in Germany with the real
  irreconcilable note:<br>
  "...we were once in Egypt. Already we have compelled a Pharaoh to set us
  free. We have outlasted the Pyramids. We shall outlast the denials of all
  those who surround us."<br>
  As a matter of fact the Pyramids were there a long time before the Jews.<br>
  I reiterate that the whole scheme and purport of this book is to insist upon
  the supreme decisive importance of what in &sect; 4 I have called the mental
  superstructure of the human animal. The reconstruction of its idea system is
  its only practicable method of adaptation, and here is an. idea system that
  resists and evades reconstruction very obstinately. In &sect;&sect; 8 and 9 I
  have assembled and summarized the nature of the great intellectual effort
  which is needed if our species is to adjust itself to the terrific new
  conditions that have risen about it. The Jewish conflict disregards this,
  cuts athwart it, arrests and prevents it, like a noisy quarrel in a
  laboratory. All the countervailing evil in the world cannot make a bad
  tradition a good one. Killing or ill-treating a man does not put him in the
  wrong, but also, we have to remember, and that is not so easy for the
  liberal-minded, it does not put him in the right The idea of the solidarity
  of the Chosen People, evade it or not, remains the fundamental Jewish idea,
  and this fundamental Jewish idea, like any other nationalism, is an offense
  against the unity of mankind.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note12c"
     name="note12c"><b>Note 12C.</b></a> Persecution mania is a well-known form
     of insanity. With certain variations of phrase and form, due to the
     current ideas of the period, it presents an almost stereotyped pattern
     through the ages. Formerly it was usually witches and warlocks who were
     supposed to be at the root of the matter. Anyone odd, anyone different,
     came under suspicion, old crones and afflicted and odd-looking men were
     distrusted, and very often the suspects caught a touch of the infection
     and tried doing the things they learnt were so potent. Multitudes of
     sorcerers have confessed, under no great duress, to impossible crimes.
     They brewed potions, stuck pins in wax images, cast spells, sent familiar
     spirits to gibber and creep and whisper in the night.<br>
  Madness like everything else moves with the times; it clothes itself in new
  fashions while remaining essentially the same. Nowadays the witches have
  become "Occult Powers." They use hypnotism, electricity, infections (Pah!),
  they radio voices making threats and evil suggestions. Every prominent
  publicist continually gets letters from sufferers with this type of
  obsession. Such delusions may easily make the patient a danger to himself and
  others, and then he is "certified" and taken care of. But in times of social
  movement and stress this disorder may become contagious, witness the witch
  mania of the early seventeenth century. It is then more difficult to deal
  with.<br>
  Like a dark shadow to the rational objections that can be made to the in-and-
  out double nationalism of the Jews, there is a sustained campaign of sinister
  suggestion with a considerable literature of its own. Some years ago four or
  five books written by Mrs. Nesta Webster attracted considerable attention.
  She is a very competent writer and so sound a Christian, of a faith so
  uncritical, that she is quite unable to understand that many honest people
  find a vast amount of Christian doctrine impossible. How impossible, I have
  sought to show in &sect;&sect; 13 and 14. To her there is nothing good except
  in Christianity, and this is so obvious to her that any objection to the
  faith seems necessarily part of some diabolically hatched conspiracy. She has
  set herself with the greatest industry to trace and link together the
  long-drawn succession of Cabalists, Gnostics, Manichaeans, the Old Man of the
  Mountains, Knight Templars, Satanists, Rosicrucians, Illuminati, Freemasons,
  Rousseau, Voltaire, Cagliostro, Madame Blavatsky, Mrs. Besant, Trade Unions,
  Anarchists, Socialists, Theosophists, Communists, Those Bolsheviks, a
  frightful horde all plotting and getting hold of power and handing it on and
  doing down Christianity and the Christian life. Her books are written
  with-conviction enough to make one look under the bed at nights. She has
  never quite committed herself to those famous forged <i>Protocols Of The
  Elders Of Zion</i> which were published as the articles of association so to
  speak of that world conspiracy, but she stoutly maintains that though that
  book may not be genuine, it nevertheless shows the sort of thing of which the
  Jews are capable. Her book <i>Secret Societies And Subversive Movements</i>
  concludes: "For behind the concrete forces of revolution&mdash;whether
  Pan-German, Judaic or Illuminist&mdash;beyond that invisible secret circle
  which perhaps directs them all, is there not yet another force, still more
  potent, that must be taken into account? In looking back over the centuries
  at the dark episodes that have marked the history of the human race from its
  earliest origins&mdash;strange and horrible cults, waves of witchcraft,
  blasphemies and desecrations&mdash;how is it possible to ignore the existence
  of an Occult Power at work in the world? Individuals, sects, or races fired
  with the desire of world domination, have provided the fighting forces of
  destruction, but behind them are the veritable powers of darkness in eternal
  conflict with the powers of light."<br>
  I should describe Mrs. Nesta Webster as a perfectly sane and capable person
  with insane ideas, so widely do I disagree with her. I believe her influence
  has spread far beyond the circle of her actual readers. Milder forms of the
  same intellectual malaise at any rate are now very prevalent throughout the
  more prosperous classes in Great Britain and America. It is the only way to
  account for the behavior of Mr. Neville Chamberlain, for example, or Lord
  Rothermere, the British newspaper proprietor, towards the Jews, towards
  Russia, during the past two or three years. Mr. William Teeling again, to
  whom I refer in &sect; 13, is another case. A tepid passive Christianity is
  becoming an aggressive pro-Christianity tinder the stresses of the time.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note12d"
     name="note12d"><b>Note 12D.</b></a> Sir Norman Angell and Mrs. Dorothy
     Frances Buxton, in a very clear and almost pressingly persuasive book,
     <i>You And The Refugee</i> (Penguin Books, 1939), argue for a practically
     unrestrained admission of these outcasts. They show in particular how
     beneficial a large refugee immigration might be to the British Empire. It
     would bring in new trades, new skill, find fresh work for the unemployed,
     and in Great Britain arrest the approaching decline in population&mdash;if
     that is desirable. Their plea for a more generous treatment of refugees,
     so far as assimilable individuals are concerned, is unanswerable.<br>
  But our authors' arguments for an inassimilable immigration en bloc are less
  convincing. That would only renew the trouble at a later, date. There is no
  time to begin that old history again in new regions and among fresh
  difficulties. Disaster is advancing too rapidly upon our entire species.
  Jewish nationalism like every other nationalism must end and end soon. And
  even though the plea of existing unemployment is an irrational social barrier
  to assimilable immigrants, it is, in a country where the sense of social
  insecurity is growing, where confidence in the intelligence and good faith of
  the government is diminishing, and where large masses of the population, and
  especially the accumulation of untrained and unemployed young men, see no
  dear prospect of a tolerable life ahead, none the less a barrier. Implicitly
  the British authorities admit: "We do not know how to handle our own people,
  we are getting more and more bothered&mdash;by everything&mdash;and if these
  people come into our muddle, there is bound to be serious trouble." And so in
  effect they give them up to destruction, not outrageously and openly as the
  Germans do, but by looking in the opposite direction, and delaying
  action.<br>
  In a scientifically organized, forward-looking social order, there will be no
  people unemployed and there will be no difficulty whatever in the movement of
  population from point to point. The whole world will be everyman's and the
  fullness thereof. The bare possibility of such a rational order sustains
  whatever hope there is for mankind in this present survey of the human
  outlook. But this world we are living in is not a rational world and the
  harsh reality we have to face when we cast the Jewish horoscope is this
  dosing-up of the avenues of escape.<br>
  Already in the past year or so, a multitude, scores and possibly hundreds of
  thousands, must have been done to death. And still it goes on....<br>
  In <i>You And The Refugee</i>, however, I came upon one passage that affected
  me very disagreeably and I think I ought to say a word about it here. It is
  too germane to this discussion to omit:<br>
  "Not all Jews are Zionists, but all Jews will resent the letting down of
  Zionists, the surrender of Zionists to Arab terrorism. And their resentment
  will be world-wide. We do not perhaps realize the possible repercussions.<br>
  "The power of world Jewry is moral&mdash;the power of journalists, writers,
  dramatists, scientists. It is worth while for an Empire as gravely menaced as
  the British to have that power on its side."...<br>
  That is a threat and a very evil and embittering threat. Happily it is not
  made by Jews but by two overofficious Gentile champions on their behalf, I do
  not see things from the Imperialist standpoint .. of these authors. I think
  the British Empire has outlived its usefulness. But the consolidation of the
  English-speaking people as the vehicle of a world civilization is quite
  another matter, and a matter of great urgency. Yet unless the British
  government does what it is told in Palestine, the Chosen People, we are told,
  will devote themselves to preventing that consolidation. I think that is a
  very unhappy suggestion indeed. It does no justice to the intellectual
  quality of Israel. I doubt if any representative Jewish writer could be
  quoted in support of it. But it is exactly what the Jews are accused of doing
  by their worst enemies. My first reaction to it, until I realized that this
  dream of vindictive sabotage was a purely Gentile invention, was acute
  resentment and anger. I believe these two authors would be wise to take that
  tactless and unjustifiable passage out of any further editions of their
  well-intentioned book.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="note13a"
     name="note13a"><b>Note 13A.</b></a> "We Catholics acknowledge readily,
     without any shame, nay with pride, that Catholicism cannot be identified
     simply and wholly with primitive Christianity, nor even with the Gospel of
     Christ, in the same way that the great oak cannot be identified with the
     tiny acorn. There is no mechanical identity, but an organic identity. And
     we go further and say that thousands of years hence Catholicism will
     probably be even richer, more luxuriant, more manifold in dogma, morals,
     law and worship, than the Catholicism of the present day. A religious
     historian of the fifth millennium A.D. will without difficulty discover in
     Catholicism conceptions and forms and practices which derive from India,
     China and Japan, and he will have to recognize a far more obvious 'complex
     of opposites.' It is quite true, Catholicism is a union of contraries. But
     'contraries are not contradictories'.... The Gospel of Christ would have
     been no living gospel, and the seed which He scattered no living seed, if
     it had remained ever the tiny seed of A.D. 33, and not struck root, and
     had not assimilated foreign matter, and had not by the help of this
     foreign matter grown up into a tree, so that the birds of the air dwell in
     its branches." Professor Karl Adam, <i>The Spirit of Catholicism</i>
     (1938).<br>
  For reasons I have made perfectly clear in this book, I do not believe there
  will be any Roman Catholic Church at all in the fifth millennium &raquo;A.D.,
  but (see &sect; 18) it is amusing to speculate how the successors of
  Professor Karl Adam, long before then, would have plaited into the Trinity
  that God of Male Sex Appeal from whose left eye sprang the Sun Goddess, while
  he blew Susa-no-o, the dragon-slaying Susa-no-o, from his nose. It is, I
  agree, not at all improbable, given the survival and continual growth of the
  Church. Morgan Young, in the book I have cited in the text, tells that the
  great assimilation prophesied by Professor Karl Adam has already begun. The
  crude early Christians, still in the "acorn" phase, preferred martyrdom to
  burning a pinch of incense to the Roman God-Emperors, but the more
  catholic-spirited Church of today has already established friendly relations
  with the Shinto faith, Japan and Rome have exchanged envoys, and the Japanese
  Catholic bows in the Shinto temples in acquiescence to the local supremacy of
  the Emperor-Divinity over the Vatican.</p>
