  <p class="blurb">An essay originally read by Wells to the Fabian Society in
  December 1905. Unwearable boots are cited as an example of the pointless
  suffering brought about by a system in which capital is privately owned. This
  essay is especially notable for the manner in which Well's uses his childhood
  view of the world from a basement: Well's seemed destined, in these first
  fifteen years of his life, to spend much of his time underground, in dark,
  dismal surroundings. Raised in an underground kitchen, from which, through
  the grating, he could see only the feet of passers by, he lodged in cellars
  or garrets, dim, closed in, filled with shadows, away from the sun, in all of
  the apprentice homes in which he was forced to stay.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; THE WORLD AS BOOTS AND SUPERSTRUCTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT does not do," said a friend of mine, "to think about
boots." For my own
  part, I have always been particularly inclined to look at boots, and think
  about them. I have an odd idea that most general questions can be expressed
  in terms of foot-wear&mdash;which is perhaps why cobblers are often such
  philosophical men. Accident it may be, gave me this persuasion. A very
  considerable part of my childhood was spent in an underground kitchen; the
  window opened upon a bricked-in space, surmounted by a grating before my
  father's shop window. So that, when I looked out of the window, instead of
  seeing&mdash;as children of a higher upbringing would do&mdash;the heads and
  bodies of people, I saw their under side. I got acquainted indeed with all
  sorts of social types as boots simply, indeed, as the soles of boots; and
  only subsequently, and with care, have I fitted heads, bodies, and legs to
  these pediments.</p>

  <p>There would come boots and shoes (no doubt holding people) to stare at the
  shop, finicking, neat little women's boots, good sorts and bad sorts, fresh
  and new, worn crooked in the tread, patched or needing patching; men's boots,
  clumsy and fine, rubber shoes, tennis shoes, goloshes. Brown shoes I never
  beheld&mdash;it was before that time; but I have seen pattens. Boots used to
  come and commune at the window, duets that marked their emotional development
  by a restlessness or a kick.... But anyhow, that explains my preoccupation
  with boots.</p>

  <p>But my friend did not think it did, to think about boots.</p>

  <p>My friend was a realistic novelist, and a man from whom hope had departed.
  I cannot tell you how hope had gone out of his life; some subtle disease of
  the soul had robbed him at last of any enterprise, or belief in coming
  things; and he was trying to live the few declining years that lay before him
  in a sort of bookish comfort, among surroundings that seemed peaceful and
  beautiful, by not thinking of things that were painful and cruel. And we met
  a tramp who limped along the lane.</p>

  <p>"Chafed heel," I said, when we had parted from him again; "and on these
  pebbly byways no man goes barefooted." My friend winced; and a little silence
  came between us. We were both recalling things; and then for a time, when we
  began to talk again, until he would have no more of it, we rehearsed the
  miseries of boots.</p>

  <p>We agreed that to a very great majority of people in this country boots
  are constantly a source of distress, giving pain and discomfort, causing
  trouble, causing anxiety. We tried to present the thing in a concrete form to
  our own minds by hazardous statistical inventions. "At the present moment,"
  said I, "one person in ten in these islands is in discomfort through
  boots."</p>

  <p>My friend thought it was nearer one in five.</p>

  <p>"In the life of a poor man or a poor man's wife, and still more in the
  lives of their children, this misery of the hoot occurs and
  recurs&mdash;every year so many days."</p>

  <p>We made a sort of classification of these troubles.</p>

  <p>There is the trouble of the new boot.</p>

  <p>(i) They are made of some bad, un-ventilated material; and "draw the
  feet," as people say.</p>

  <p>(ii) They do not fit exactly. Most people have to buy ready-made boots;
  they cannot afford others, and, in the submissive philosophy of poverty, they
  wear them to "get used" to them. This gives you the little-toe pinch, the
  big-toe pinch, the squeeze and swelling across the foot; and, as a sort of
  chronic development of these pressures, come corns and all the misery of
  corns. Children's feet get distorted for good by this method of fitting the
  human being to the thing; and a vast number of people in the world are, as a
  consequence of this, ashamed to appear barefooted. (I used to press people
  who came to see me in warm pleasant weather to play Badminton barefooted on
  the grass&mdash;a delightful thing to do&mdash;until I found out that many
  were embarrassed at the thought of displaying twisted toes and corns, and
  such-like disfigurements.)</p>

  <p>(iii) The third trouble of new boots is this: they are unseasoned and in
  bad condition, and so they squeak and make themselves an insulting commentary
  on one's ways.</p>

  <p>But these are but trifling troubles to what arises as the boots get into
  wear. Then it is the pinch comes in earnest. Of these troubles of the work
  boot, I and my friend, before he desisted, reckoned up three principal
  classes.</p>

  <p>(i) There are the various sorts of chafe. Worst of the chafes is certainly
  the heel chafe, when something goes wrong with the upright support at the
  heel. This, as a boy, I have had to endure for days together; because there
  were no other boots for me. Then there is the chafe that comes when that
  inner lining of the boot rucks up&mdash;very like the chafe it is that poor
  people are always getting from over-darned and hastily-darned socks. And then
  there is the chafe that comes from ready-made boots one has got a trifle too
  large or long, in order to avoid the pinch and corns. After a little while,
  there comes a transverse crease across the loose-fitting forepart; and, when
  the boot stiffens from wet or any cause, it chafes across the base of the
  toes. They have you all ways. And I have a very lively recollection too of
  the chafe of the knots one made to mend broken laces&mdash;one cannot be
  always buying new laces, and the knots used to work inward. And then the
  chafe of the crumpled tongue.</p>

  <p>(ii) Then there are the miseries that come from the wear of the sole.
  There is the rick of ankle because the heel has gone over, and the sense of
  insecurity; and there is the miserable sense of not looking well from behind
  that many people must feel. It is almost always painful to me to walk behind
  girls who work out, and go to and fro, consuming much foot-wear, for this
  very reason, that their heels seem always to wear askew. Girls ought always
  to be so beautiful, most girls could be so beautiful, that to see their poor
  feet askew, the grace of their walk gone, a sort of spinal curvature induced,
  makes me wretched, and angry with a world that treats them so. And then there
  is the working through of nails, nails in the shoe. One limps on manfully in
  the hope presently of a quiet moment and a quiet corner in which one may
  hammer the thing down again. Thirdly, under this heading I recall the
  flapping sole. My boots always came to that stage at last; I wore the toes
  out first, and then the sole split from before backwards. As one walked it
  began catching the ground. One made fantastic paces to prevent it happening;
  one was dreadfully ashamed. At last one was forced to sit by the wayside
  frankly, and cut the flap away.</p>

  <p>(iii) Our third class of miseries we made of splitting and leaks. These
  are for the most part mental miseries, the feeling of shabbiness as one sees
  the ugly yawn, for example, between toe cap and the main upper of the boot;
  but they involve also chills, colds, and a long string of disagreeable
  consequences. And we spoke too of the misery of sitting down to work (as
  multitudes of London school children do every wet morning) in boots with
  soles worn thin or into actual holes, that have got wet and chilling on the
  way to the work-place...</p>

  <p>From these instances my mind ran on to others. I made a discovery. I had
  always despised the common run of poor Londoners for not spending their
  Sundays and holidays in sturdy walks, the very best of exercise. I had
  allowed myself to say when I found myself one summer day at Margate: "What a
  soft lot all these young people must be who loaf about the band-stand here,
  when they might be tramping over the Kentish hills inland!" But now I
  repented me of that.</p>

  <p>Long tramps indeed! Their boots would have hurt them. Their boots would
  not stand it. I saw it all.</p>

  <p>And now my discourse was fairly under way. "<i>Ex pede Herculem</i>" I
  said; "these miseries of boots are no more than a sample. The clothes people
  wear are no better than their boots; and the houses they live in far worse.
  And think of the shoddy garment of ideas and misconceptions and partial
  statements into which their poor minds have been jammed by way of education!
  Think of the way that pinches and chafes them! If one expanded the miseries
  of these things . . . Think, for example, of the results of the poor, bad,
  unwise food, of badly-managed eyes and ears and teeth! Think of the quantity
  of toothache."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, it does not do to think of such things!" cried my friend, in
  a sort of anguish; and would have no more of it at any price...</p>

  <p>And yet in his time he had written books full of these very matters,
  before despair overtook him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; PEOPLE WHOSE BOOTS DON'T HURT THEM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WELL, I did not talk merely to torment him; nor have I
written this merely
  to torment yon. You see I have a persistent persuasion that all these
  miseries are preventable miseries, which it lies in the power of men to
  cure.</p>

  <p>Everybody does not suffer misery from boots.</p>

  <p>One person I know, another friend of mine, who can testify to that; who
  has tasted all the miseries of boots, and who now goes about the world free
  of them, but not altogether forgetful of them. A stroke of luck, aided
  perhaps by a certain alacrity on his own part, lifted him out of the class in
  which one buys one's boots and clothes out of what is left over from a pound
  a week, into the class in which one spends seventy or eighty pounds a year on
  clothing. Sometimes he buys shoes and boots at very good shops; sometimes he
  has them made for him; he has them stored in a proper cupboard, and great
  care is taken of them; and so his boots and shoes and slippers never chafe,
  never pinch, never squeak, never hurt nor worry him, never bother him; and,
  when he sticks out his toes before the fire, they do not remind him that he
  is a shabby and contemptible wretch, living meanly on the dust heaps of the
  world. You might think from this he had every reason to congratulate himself
  and be happy, seeing that he has had good follow after evil; but, such is the
  oddness of the human heart, he isn't contented at all. The thought of the
  multitudes so much worse off than himself in this matter of foot-wear, gives
  him no sort of satisfaction. Their boots pinch him vicariously. The black
  rage with the scheme of things that once he felt through suffering in his own
  person in the days when he limped shabbily through gaily busy, fashionable
  London streets, in split boots that chafed, he feels now just as badly as he
  goes about the world very comfortably himself, but among people whom he knows
  with a pitiless clearness to be almost intolerably uncomfortable. He has no
  optimistic illusion that things are all right with them. Stupid people who
  have always been well off, who have always had boots that fit, may think
  that; but not so, he. In one respect the thought of boots makes him even more
  viciously angry now, than it used to do. In the old days he was savage with
  his luck, but hopelessly savage; he thought that bad boots, ugly
  uncomfortable clothes, rotten houses, were in the very nature of things. Now,
  when he sees a child sniffing and blubbering and halting upon the pavement,
  or an old country-woman going painfully along a lane, he no longer recognises
  the Pinch of Destiny. His rage is lit by the thought, that there are fools in
  this world who ought to have foreseen and prevented this. He no longer curses
  fate, but the dullness of statesmen and powerful responsible people who have
  neither the heart, nor courage, nor capacity, to change the state of
  mismanagement that gives us these things.</p>

  <p>Now do not think I am dwelling unduly upon my second friend's good
  fortune, when I tell you that once he was constantly getting pain and
  miserable states of mind, colds for example, from the badness of his
  clothing, shame from being shabby, pain from the neglected state of his
  teeth, from the indigestion of unsuitable food eaten at unsuitable hours,
  from the insanitary ugly house in which he lived and the bad air of that part
  of London, from things indeed quite beyond the unaided power of a poor
  overworked man to remedy. And now all these disagreeable things have gone out
  of his life; he has consulted dentists and physicians, he has hardly any dull
  days from colds, no pain from toothache at all, no gloom of
  indigestion....</p>

  <p>I will not go on with the tale of good fortune of this lucky person. My
  purpose is served if I have shown that this misery of boots is not an
  unavoidable curse upon mankind. If one man can evade it, others can. By good
  management it may be altogether escaped. If you, or what is more important to
  most human beings, if any people dear to you, suffer from painful or
  disfiguring boots or shoes, and you can do no better for them, it is simply
  because you are getting the worse side of an ill-managed world. It is not the
  universal lot.</p>

  <p>And what I say of boots is true of all the other minor things of life. If
  your wife catches a bad cold because her boots are too thin for the time of
  the year, or dislikes going out because she cuts a shabby ugly figure, if
  your children look painfully nasty because their faces are swollen with
  toothache, or because their clothes are dirty, old, and ill-fitting, if you
  are all dull and disposed to be cross with one another for want of decent
  amusement and change of air&mdash;don't submit, don't be humbugged for a
  moment into believing that this is the dingy lot of all mankind. Those people
  you love are living in a badly-managed world and on the wrong side of it; and
  such wretchednesses are the daily demonstration of that.</p>

  <p>Don't say for a moment: "Such is life." Don't think their miseries are
  part of some primordial curse there is no escaping. The disproof of that is
  for any one to see. There are people, people no more deserving than others,
  who suffer from none of these things. You may feel you merit no better than
  to live so poorly and badly that your boots are always hurting you; but do
  the little children, the girls, the mass of decent hard-up people, deserve no
  better fate?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; AT THIS POINT A DISPUTE ARISES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOW let us imagine some one who will dispute what I am
saying. I do not
  suppose any one will dispute my argument that a large part of the misery of
  civilised life&mdash;I do not say "all" but only a "large part"&mdash;arises
  out of the network of squalid insufficiencies of which I have taken this
  misery of boots as the simplest example. But I do believe quite a lot of
  people will be prepared to deny that such miseries can be avoided. They will
  say that every one cannot have the best of things, that of all sorts of good
  things, including good leather and cobbling, there is not enough to go round,
  that lower-class people ought not to mind being shabby and uncomfortable,
  that they ought to be very glad to be able to live at all, considering what
  they are, and that it is no good stirring up discontent about things that
  cannot be altered or improved.</p>

  <p>Such arguments are not to be swept aside with a wave of the hand. It is
  perfectly true that every one cannot have the best of things; and it is in
  the nature of things that some boots should be better and some worse. To some
  people, either by sheer good luck, or through the strength of their
  determination to have them, the exquisitely good boots, those of the finest
  leather and the most artistic cut, will fall. I have never denied that.
  Nobody dreams of a time when every one will have exactly as good boots as
  every one else; I am not preaching any such childish and impossible equality.
  But it is a long way from recognising that there must be a certain
  picturesque and interesting variety in this matter of foot-wear, to the
  admission that a large majority of people can never hope for more than to be
  shod in a manner that is frequently painful, uncomfortable, unhealthy, or
  unsightly. That admission I absolutely refuse to make. There is enough good
  leather in the world to make good sightly boots and shoes for all who need
  them, enough men at leisure and enough power and machinery to do all the work
  required, enough unemployed intelligence to organise the shoemaking and shoe
  distribution for everybody. What stands in the way? Let us put that question
  in a rather different form. Here on the one hand &mdash;you can see for
  yourself in any unfashionable part of Great Britain&mdash;are people badly,
  uncomfortably, painfully shod, in old boots, rotten boots, sham boots; and on
  the other great stretches of land in the world, with unlimited possibilities
  of cattle and leather and great numbers of people, who, either through wealth
  or trade disorder, are doing no work. And our question is: "Why cannot the
  latter set to work and make and distribute boots?"</p>

  <p>Imagine yourself trying to organise something of this kind of Free Booting
  expedition; and consider the difficulties you would meet with. You would
  begin by looking for a lot of leather. Imagine yourself setting off to South
  America, for example, to get leather; beginning at the very beginning by
  setting to work to kill and flay a herd of cattle. You find at once you are
  interrupted. Along comes your first obstacle in the shape of a man who tells
  you the cattle and the leather belong to him. You explain that the leather is
  wanted for people who have no decent boots in England. He says he does not
  care a rap what you want it for; before you may take it from him you have to
  buy him off; it is his private property, this leather, and the herd and the
  land over which the herd ranges. You ask him how much he wants for his
  leather; and he tells you frankly, just as much as he can induce you to
  give.</p>

  <p>If he chanced to be a person of exceptional sweetness of disposition, you
  might perhaps argue with him. You might point out to him that this project of
  giving people splendid boots was a fine one that would put an end to much
  human misery. He might even sympathise with your generous enthusiasm; but you
  would, I think, find him adamantine in his resolve to get just as much out of
  you for his leather as you could with the utmost effort pay.</p>

  <p>Suppose now you said to him: "But how did you come by this land and these
  herds, so that you can stand between them and the people who have need of
  them, exacting this profit?" lie would probably either embark upon a long
  rigmarole, or, what is much more probable, lose his temper and decline to
  argue. Pursuing your doubt as to the rightfulness of his property in these
  things, you might admit he deserved a certain reasonable fee for the rough
  care he had taken of the land and herds. But cattle breeders are a rude,
  violent race; and it is doubtful if you would get far beyond your proposition
  of a reasonable fee. You would in fact have to buy off this owner of the
  leather at a good thumping price&mdash;he exacting just as much as he could
  get from you&mdash;if you wanted to go on with your project.</p>

  <p>Well, then you would have to get your leather here; and, to do that, you
  would have to bring it by railway and ship to this country. And here again
  you would find people without any desire or intention of helping your
  project, standing in your course, resolved to make every possible penny out
  of you on your way to provide sound boots for every one. You would find the
  railway was private property, and had an owner or owners; you would find the
  ship was private property, with an owner or owners; and that none of these
  would be satisfied for a moment with a mere; fee adequate to their services.
  They too would be resolved to make every penny of profit out of you. If you
  made inquiries about the matter, you would probably find the real owners of
  railway and ship were companies of shareholders, and that the profit squeezed
  out of your poor people's boots at this stage went to fill the pockets of old
  ladies at Torquay, spendthrifts in Paris, well-booted gentlemen in London
  clubs, all sorts of glossy people....</p>

  <p>Well, you get the leather to England at last; and now you want to make it
  into boots. You take it to a centre of population, invite workers to come to
  you, erect sheds and machinery upon a vacant piece of ground, and start off
  in a sort of fury of generous industry, boot-making.... Do you? There comes
  along an owner for that vacant piece of ground, declares it is his property,
  demands an enormous sum for rent. And your workers all round you, you find,
  cannot get house room until they too have paid rent&mdash;every inch of the
  country is somebody's property, and a man may not shut his eyes for an hour
  without the consent of some owner or other. And the food your shoemakers eat,
  the clothes they wear, have all paid tribute and profit to land-owners,
  cart-owners, house-owners, endless tribute over and over and above the fair
  pay for work that has been done upon them.... So one might go on. But you
  begin to see now one set of reasons at least why every one has not good
  comfortable boots. There could be plenty of leather; and there is certainly
  plenty of labour and quite enough intelligence in the world to manage that
  and a thousand other desirable things. But this institution of Private
  Property in land and naturally produced tilings, these obstructive claims
  that prevent you using ground, or moving material, and that have to be bought
  out at exorbitant prices, stand in the way. All these owners hang like
  parasites upon your enterprise at its every stage; and, by the time you get
  your sound boots well made in England, you will find them costing about a
  pound a pair&mdash;high out of the reach of the general mass of people. And
  you will perhaps not think me fanciful and extravagant when I confess that
  when I realise this, and look at poor people's boots in the street, and see
  them cracked and misshapen and altogether nasty, I seem to see also a lot of
  little phantom land-owners, cattle-owners, house-owners, owners of all
  sorts, swarming over their pinched and weary feet like leeches, taking much
  and giving nothing, and being the real cause of all such miseries.</p>

  <p>Now is this a necessary and unavoidable thing?&mdash;that is our question.
  Is there no other way of managing things than to let these property-owners
  exact their claims, and squeeze comfort, pride, happiness, out of the lives
  of the common run of people? Because, of course, it is not only the boots
  they squeeze into meanness and badness. It is the claim and profit of the
  land-owner and house-owner that make our houses so ugly, shabby, and dear,
  that make our roadways and railways so crowded and inconvenient, that sweat
  our schools, our clothing, our food &mdash;boots we took merely by way of one
  example of a universal trouble.</p>

  <p>Well, there are a number of people who say there is a better way and that
  the world could be made infinitely better in all these matters, made happier
  and better than it ever has been in these respects, by refusing to have
  private property in all these universally necessary things. They say that it
  is possible to have the land administered, and such common and needful things
  as leather produced, and boots manufactured, and no end of other such
  generally necessary services carried on, not for the private profit of
  individuals, but for the good of all. They propose that the State should take
  away the land, and the railways, and shipping, and many great organised
  enterprises from their owners, who use them simply to squeeze the means for a
  wasteful private expenditure out of the common mass of men, and should
  administer all these things, generously and boldly, not for profit, but for
  service. It is this idea of extracting profit they hold which is the very
  root of the evil. These are the Socialists; and they are the only people who
  do hold out any hope of far-reaching change that will alter the present dingy
  state of affairs, of which this painful wretchedness of boots is only one
  typical symbol.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; IS SOCIALISM POSSIBLE?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WILL not pretend to be impartial in this matter, and to
discuss as
  though I had an undecided mind, whether the world would be better if we could
  abolish private property in land and in many things of general utility;
  because I have no doubt left in the matter. I believe that private property
  in these things is no more necessary and unavoidable than private property in
  our fellow-creatures, or private property in bridges and roads. The idea
  that anything and everything may be claimed as private property belongs to
  the dark ages of the world; and it is not only a monstrous injustice, but a
  still more monstrous inconvenience. Suppose we still admitted private
  property in high roads, and let every man who had a scrap of high road haggle
  a bargain with us before we could drive by in a cab! You say life would be
  unendurable. But indeed it amounts to something a little like that if we use
  a railway now; and it is quite like that if one wants a spot of ground
  somewhere upon which one may live. I see no more difficulty in managing land,
  factories, and the like, publicly for the general good, than there is in
  managing roads and bridges, and the post office and the police. So far I see
  no impossibility whatever in Socialism. To abolish private property in these
  things would be to abolish all that swarm of parasites, whose greed for
  profit and dividend hampers and makes a thousand useful and delightful
  enterprises costly or hopeless. It would abolish them; but is that any
  objection whatever?</p>

  <p>And as for taking such property from the owners; why shouldn't we? The
  world has not only in the past taken slaves from their owners, with no
  compensation or with a meagre compensation; but in the history of mankind,
  dark as it is, there are innumerable cases of slave-owners resigning their
  inhuman rights. You may say that to take away property from people is unjust
  and robbery; but is that really so? Suppose you found a number of children in
  a nursery all very dull and unhappy because one of them, who had been badly
  spoilt, had got all the toys together and claimed them all, and refused to
  let the others have any. Would you not dispossess the child, however honest
  its illusion that it was right to be greedy? That is practically the position
  of the property-owner to-day. You may say, if you choose, that
  property-owners, land-owners for example, must be bought out and not robbed;
  but since getting the money to buy them out involves taxing the property of
  some one else, who may possibly have a better claim to it than the land-owner
  to his, I don't quite see where the honesty of that course comes in. You can
  only give property for property in buying and selling; and if private
  property is not robbery, then not only Socialism but ordinary taxation must
  be. But if taxation is a justifiable proceeding, if you can tax me (as I am
  taxed) for public services, a shilling and more out of every twenty shillings
  I earn, then I do not see why you should not put a tax upon the land-owner if
  you want to do so, of a half or two thirds or all his land, or upon the
  railway share-holder of ten or fifteen or twenty shillings in the pound on
  his shares. In every change some one has to hear the brunt; every improvement
  in machinery and industrial organisation deprives some poor people of an
  income; and I do not see why we should be so extraordinarily tender to the
  rich, to those who have been unproductive all their lives, when they stand in
  the way of the general happiness. And though I deny the right to compensation
  I do not deny its probable advisability. So far as the question of method
  goes it is quite conceivable that we may partially compensate the property
  owners and make all sorts of mitigating arrangements to avoid cruelty to them
  in our attempt to end the wider cruelties of to-day.</p>

  <p>But, apart from the justice of the case, many people seem to regard
  Socialism as a hopeless dream, because, as they put it, "it is against human
  nature." Every one with any scrap of property in land, or shares, or what
  not, they tell us, will be bitterly opposed to the coming of Socialism; and,
  as such people have all the leisure and influence in the world, and as all
  able and energetic people tend naturally to join that class, there never can
  be any effectual force to bring Socialism about. But that seems to me to
  confess a very base estimate of human nature. There are, no doubt, a number
  of dull, base, rich people who hate and dread Socialism for purely selfish
  reasons; but it is quite possible to be a property owner and yet be anxious
  to see Socialism come to its own.</p>

  <p>For example, the man whose private affairs I know best in the world, the
  second friend I named, the owner of all those comfortable boots, gives time
  and energy and money to further this hope of Socialism, although he pays
  income tax on twelve hundred a year, and has shares and property to the value
  of some thousands of pounds. And that he does out of no instinct of
  sacrifice. He believes he would be happier and more comfortable in a
  Socialistic state of affairs, when it would not be necessary for him to hold
  on to that life-belt of invested property. He finds it&mdash;and quite a lot
  of well-off people are quite of his way of thinking&mdash;a constant flaw
  upon a life of comfort and pleasant interests to see so many people, who
  might be his agreeable friends and associates, detestably under-educated,
  detestably housed, in the most detestable clothes and boots, and so
  detestably broken in spirit that they will not treat him as an equal. It
  makes him feel he is like that spoilt child in the nursery; he feels ashamed
  and contemptible; and, since individual charity only seems in the long run to
  make matters* worse, he is ready to give a great deal of his life, and lose
  his entire little heap of possessions if need be, very gladly lose it, to
  change the present order of things in a comprehensive manner.</p>

  <p>I am quite convinced that there are numbers of much richer and more
  influential people who are of his way of thinking. Much more likely to
  obstruct the way to Socialism is the ignorance, the want of courage, the
  stupid want of imagination of the very poor, too shy and timid and clumsy to
  face any change they can evade! But, even with them, popular education is
  doing its work; and I do not fear but that in the next generation we shall
  find Socialists even in the slums.</p>

  <p>The unimaginative person who owns some little bit of property, an acre or
  so of freehold land, or a hundred pounds in the savings bank, will no doubt
  be the most tenacious passive resister to Socialistic ideas; and such, I
  fear, we must reckon, together with the insensitive rich, as our
  irreconcilable enemies, as irremovable pillars of the present order. The mean
  and timid elements in "human nature" are, and will be, I admit, against
  Socialism; but they are not all "human nature," not half human nature. And
  when, in the whole history of the world, have meanness and timidity won a
  struggle? It is passion, it is enthusiasm, and indignation that mould the
  world to their will&mdash;and I cannot see how any one can go into the back
  streets of London, or any large British town, and not be filled up with
  shame, and passionate resolve to end so grubby and mean a state of affairs as
  is displayed there.</p>

  <p>I don't think the "human nature" argument against the possibility of
  Socialism will hold water.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; SOCIALISM MEANS REVOLUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LET us be clear about one thing: that Socialism means
revolution, that it
  means a change in the every-day texture of life. It may be a very gradual
  change, but it will be a very complete one. You cannot change the world, and
  at the same time not change the world. You will find Socialists about, or at
  any rate men calling themselves Socialists, who will pretend that this is not
  so, who will assure you that some odd little jobbing about municipal gas and
  water is Socialism, and back-stairs intervention between Conservative and
  Liberal the way to the millennium. You might as well call a gas jet in the
  lobby of a meeting-house, the glory of God in Heaven!</p>

  <p>Socialism aims to change, not only the boots on people's feet, but the
  clothes they wear, the houses they inhabit, the work they do, the education
  they get, their places, their honours, and all their possessions. Socialism
  aims to make a new world out of the old. It can only be attained by the
  intelligent, outspoken, courageous resolve of a great multitude of men and
  women. You must get absolutely clear in your mind that Socialism means a
  complete change, a break with history, with much that is picturesque; whole
  classes will vanish. The world will be vastly different, with a different
  sort of houses, different sorts of people. All the different trades and
  industries will be changed, the medical profession will be carried on under
  different conditions, engineering, science-, the theatrical trade, the
  clerical trade, schools, hotels, almost every trade, will have to undergo as
  complete an internal change as a caterpillar does when it becomes a moth. If
  you are afraid of so much change as that, it is better you should funk about
  it now than later. The whole system has to be changed, if we are to get rid
  of the masses of dull poverty that render our present state detestable to any
  sensitive man or woman. That, and no less, is the aim of all sincere
  Socialists: the establishment of a new and better order of society by the
  abolition of private property in land, in natural productions, and in their
  exploitation&mdash;a change as profound as the abolition of private property
  in slaves would have been in ancient Rome or Athens. If you demand less than
  that, if you are not prepared to struggle for that, you arc not really a
  Socialist. If you funk that, then you must make up your mind to square your
  life to a sort of personal and private happiness with things as they are, and
  decide with my other friend that "it doesn't do to think about boots."</p>

  <p>It is well to insist upon one central idea. Socialism is a common-sense,
  matter-of-fact proposal to change our conventional admission of what is or is
  not property, and to re-arrange the world according to these revised
  conceptions. A certain number of clever people, dissatisfied with the
  straightforwardness of this, have set themselves to put it in some brilliant
  obscure way; they will tell you that Socialism is based on the philosophy of
  Hegel, or that it turns on a theory of Rent, or that it is somehow muddled up
  with a sort of white Bogey called the Overman, and all sorts of brilliant,
  nonsensical, unappetising things. The theory of Socialism, so far as English
  people are concerned, seems to have got up into the clouds, and its practice
  down into the drains; and it is well to warn inquiring men, that neither the
  epigram above nor the job beneath are more than the accidental accompaniments
  of Socialism. Socialism is a very large, but a plain, honest, and human
  enterprise; its ends are to be obtained neither by wit nor cunning, but by
  outspoken resolve, by the self-abnegation, the enthusiasm, and the loyal
  cooperation of great masses of people.</p>

  <p>The main thing, therefore, is the creation of these great masses of people
  out of the intellectual confusion and vagueness of the present time. Let me
  suppose that you find yourself in sympathy with this tract, that you, like my
  second friend, find the shabby dullness, the positive misery of a large
  proportion of the population of our world, make life under its present
  conditions almost intolerable, and that it is in the direction of Socialism
  that the only hope of a permanent remedy lies. What are we to do? Obviously
  to give our best energies to making other people Socialists, to organising
  ourselves with all other Socialists, irrespective of class or the minor
  details of creed, and to making ourselves audible, visible, effectual as
  Socialists, wherever and whenever we can.</p>

  <p>We have to think about Socialism, read about it, discuss it; so that we
  may be assured and clear and persuasive about it. We have to confess our
  faith openly and frequently. We must refuse to be called Liberal or
  Conservative, Republican or Democrat, or any of those ambiguous things.
  Everywhere we must make or join a Socialist organisation, a club or
  association or what not, so that we may "count." For us, as for the early
  Christians, preaching our gospel is the supreme duty. Until Socialists can be
  counted, and counted upon by the million, little will be done. When they
  are&mdash;a new world will be ours.</p>

  <p>Above all, if I may offer advice to a fellow-Socialist, I would say: Cling
  to the simple essential idea of Socialism, which is the abolition of private
  property in anything but what a man has earned or made. Do not complicate
  your cause with elaborations. And keep in your mind, if you can, some sort of
  talisman to bring you back to that essential gospel, out of the confusions
  and warring suggestions of every-day discussion.</p>

  <p>For my own part, I have, as I said at the beginning, a prepossession with
  boots; and my talisman is this:&mdash;The figure of a badly fed but rather
  pretty little girl of ten or eleven, dirty, and her hands coarse with rough
  usage, her poor pretty child's body in ungainly rags, and, on her feet, big
  broken-down boots that hurt her. And particularly I think of her wretched
  sticks of legs and the limp of her feet; and all those phantom owners and
  profit-takers I spoke of, they are there about her martyrdom, leech-like,
  clinging to her as she goes....</p>

  <p>I want to change everything in the world that made that; and I do not
  greatly care what has to go in the process. Do you?</p>

  <p class="smcap">H.G. Wells</p>
  <br>

  <p class="first">[Here is just a bit of hard fact to carry out what I say.
It is a
  quotation from a letter from a workman to my friend Mr. Chiozza Money, one of
  the best informed writers upon labour questions in England:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I am a railway man, in constant work at 30s. per week. I am
  the happy, or otherwise, father of six healthy children. Last year I bought
  twenty pairs of boots. This year, up to date, I have bought ten pairs,
  costing &pound;2; and yet, at the present time, my wife and five of the
  children have only one pair each. 1 have two pairs, both of which let in the
  water; but I see no prospect at present of getting new ones. I ought to say,
  of course, that my wife is a thoroughly domesticated woman, and I am one of
  the most temperate of men. So much so, that if all I spend in luxuries was
  saved it would not buy a pair of hoots once a year. But this is the point I
  want to mention. During 1903 my wages were 25s. 6d per week; and I then had
  the six children. My next-door neighbour was a boot-maker and repairer. He
  fell out of work, and was out for months. During that time, of course, my
  children's boots needed repairing as at other times. I had not the money to
  pay for them being repaired, so had to do what repairing I could myself. One
  day I found out that I was repairing boots on one side of the wall, and my
  neighbour on the other side out of work, and longing to do the work I was
  compelled to do myself...."</p>

  <p>The wall was a commercial organisation of society based on private
  property in land and natural productions. These two men must work for the
  owners or not at all; they cannot work for one another. Food first, then
  rent; and boots, if you can, when all the owners are paid.]</p>
