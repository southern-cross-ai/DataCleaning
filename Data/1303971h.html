  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p>The Author who offers these tales has called them <i>Bagatelle</i> (a
  game, a diversion, a trifle), having been moved to write them through the
  poignant appeal of those aspects of the past, the decorations of peoples and
  an age long since gone, which to most appear but a game, a
  trifle&mdash;bagatelle. They might be named, too, stories of empty palaces,
  of closed mansions, of deserted castles, built to affront the enemy in the
  game of war, or to entertain the friend in the game of pleasure.</p>

  <p>The roofless towers of Karolsfeldt where the oak grows near the hearth of
  the great hall and the trees of the heavy forest have encroached up to the
  fallen walls&mdash;the tarnished mirrors in the gilt and stucco pavilions
  hidden in airy woods or agreeable parks&mdash;a lonely villa on the
  Brenta&mdash;a straight-fronted, shuttered palace facing the fountain where
  the gladiators washed their wounds outside the Roman Coliseum&mdash;a secret
  and dark-balconied residence in a narrow street of Madrid&mdash;an
  extravagant château close to the Russian frontiers...These places in their
  loneliness, decay, neglect and partial ruin still mark the quiet solitudes or
  forgotten streets of European cities and possess for some a bitter-sweet
  fascination.</p>

  <p>These dwellings, where the long-since dead kept their toys and beguiled
  the nostalgia for the unattainable (with which we are all so desperately
  familiar), are easily peopled by phantoms that soon take a definite shape and
  play out their own story without any help from the writer, who takes the part
  rather of transcriber than that of author; he is, at least, conscious of no
  invention and endeavours to describe people and scenes that arise as
  naturally from these ancient habitations, parks, pleasaunces, as mist from a
  lake at the close of an autumn day, or pungent perfume from a plucked and
  dying flower.</p>

  <p>Some of the episodes are grim enough; behind the ribbons, the lutes, the
  cupidons, grins the mask of tragedy; yet&mdash;bagatelle&mdash;all of it, for
  these people are dead and seen through the medium of a dream.</p>

  <p>They inhabit no known country, but they claim an eternal existence in
  those memories of the past that torment, perplex and solace some of us; they
  are purged of grossness; gorgeous ghosts, they enact their parts splendidly,
  their passions are romantic, their actions seldom lack the heroic outline;
  since they died their persons have taken on a richer beauty, their characters
  a nobler cast; they are grander than when they lived; so much we may allow
  them in recompense for the dust that covers their memories.</p>

  <p>Their tragedy shows through a veil of resignation; their comedy is hard,
  cynical and grotesque, they have a little the air of actors who have played
  the same part many times, for they are perfect in their words and easy enough
  to flourish in their gestures; most of them are profoundly lonely and some
  profoundly unhappy; all feel cheated, thwarted in ambition or passion, or
  dissatisfied to agony with the bagatelles of their moment.</p>

  <p>It may be protested that they are to the last degree artificial, mere
  puppets adorned with tinsel, but to those who understand them they have the
  essence of accomplished, successful humanity, disappointed (as always) in its
  final achievement; they are worldlings defying their own negation; they are
  creatures who pile up games and trifles at higher cost with fiercer greed,
  the more they realize their own futility; the men taste the brittleness of
  success, the women the limits of beauty; all, men and women, pursue each
  other in vain hoping to clasp the long-lost, the perfect lover, and always
  embrace delusion.</p>

  <p>Their world is opulent about them and all is man-created; they move in
  palaces, pavilions, parks, gardens; if they glimpse a cottage, a heath, a
  field, they turn away wearily; the open country means a battle, a hunt, or
  boredom; to a siege, a chase, a march, a journey, they desperately carry the
  elements of carnival, music, players, clowns, dwarfs, fine clothes and
  furniture.</p>

  <p>They discuss philosophy (that cloudy disguise of lack of faith), they
  bandy terms, but they believe in nothing save their own secret and endless
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>The writer who has evoked them despairs of rendering them as they appear
  to his "inner eye," but has not lacked earnestness in the attempt.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>BAGATELLE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>A Collection of Chinese Rarities in the possession of
  Karl August Graf von Aspremont Reckheim at the Château Halstadt in the
  Archbishopric of Salzburg.</i> [THE EMPIRE, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The covered waggon, with faded blue hangings drawn closely at the sides,
  halted at last, after a long journey, at the gates of Château Halstadt, one
  of the finest mansions in the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Captain Engel van
  Dollart dismounted from beside the driver's seat, gave a thick grunt of
  relief, took off his shabby hat and scrub wig to wipe a bald, glistening head
  while he gazed stolidly, unimpressed but satisfied, at the handsome stone
  piers and rich scroll work of the gates that bore, in every possible space,
  the arms of Aspremont Reckheim and Zringi.</p>

  <p>The Dutchman then eyed the waggon with alert suspicion, as if he feared
  that some one behind the curtains would draw these and look out; but the
  rough canvas was not disturbed; the two stout horses stood patient, sweating
  in the sun; the German coachman and the German grooms on horseback waited
  with stupid indifference for the Captain's commands.</p>

  <p>This personage called up his Dutch servant, a heavy fellow with a waddling
  gait.</p>

  <p>"This is the place, Cornelis. A fine estate, hey? A very wealthy patron,
  hey?"</p>

  <p>Master and man smiled at each other slowly; Cornelis replied with a placid
  grin:</p>

  <p>"You were sure of that, Captain, before you took so much trouble. It has
  been a very tedious journey."</p>

  <p>"A very tedious journey," repeated Van Dollart. "Now I get the reward for
  it, <i>hein</i>? While I am inside you guard the waggon&mdash;careful,
  Cornelis, careful and prudent to the last. One never knows."</p>

  <p>The gate-keeper had now opened to the modest <i>cortége</i>; the covered
  waggon turned and was driven up the long avenue that emphasized the correct
  splendour of the mansion. Captain van Dollart followed on foot; it was an
  August day, clear azure gold, a few snow-white cloudlets floating above the
  tall trees; on the double-winged staircase of the château, Warriors and
  Virtues in stone guarded the pretentious entrance; above the <i>tympanum</i>
  a flag curled on a pole; a glitter of gold threads outlined the arms of
  Aspremont Reckheim and Zringi.</p>

  <p>Van Dollart despised and detested all this display; he was in love with
  his misty native flats, his trim house of neat dull pink brick with the
  precise step-gable in the Prinzengracht at Amsterdam, his quiet, heavy wife
  with the double chin and starched linen hood and collar. Van Dollart was a
  dour Churchman, a good citizen and, as a man, had only one fault&mdash;this
  was, perhaps, sufficient&mdash;he would have done anything for money.</p>

  <p>Giving a jealous glance at the covered waggon he ascended the wide stone
  steps, entered, sombrely and rudely, the grand open doors and asked the
  waiting lackeys for their master.</p>

  <p>The valet stared at the large uncouth man with his clothes of a seaman's
  cut, his formidable pistols, his resolute, ugly, leather-skinned face, and
  listened to his broken German.</p>

  <p>"Tell your master that I have brought&mdash;what he asked
  for&mdash;Captain van Dollart of the 'Water Dog,'" said the Dutchman firmly
  and cautiously. "It is outside in the covered waggon&mdash;what he asked me
  to get."</p>

  <p>While the message was being taken to the master of the château, Van
  Dollart waited indifferently among the fine marbles, sparkling lustres and
  silken tapestries of the vestibule. From the window he kept his eye cocked at
  the covered waggon on the gravelled space beyond the steps, with Cornelis
  hulking in front of the blue curtains, and beasts and men waiting patiently
  in the sun.</p>

  <p>In a few moments he was conducted into the presence of Graf Aspremont
  Reckheim, whom he greeted with an odd surly lack of respect.</p>

  <p>The noble owner of Halstadt had finished his early repast and was sitting
  in complete idleness over a stale copy of the "Gazette de France." He was a
  man more fortunate than Van Dollart (who despised him), believed any man had
  a right to be; his descent was partly Hungarian; his father's mother was a
  relation of that Emeric Tekéli who had fought with the Turks against the
  Emperor Leopold, and his own mother had been a sister of the elegant Zringi
  who had been executed in Vienna, but who was better remembered for the long,
  high-waisted coat he had made fashionable in Paris. The Aspremont Reckheims,
  very loyal subjects of His Imperial Majesty, had inherited the two immense
  fortunes of these rebel Hungarian Princes, and their present sole
  representative had received the rank of General Commandant of Hungary, which
  post gave him, a good Catholic, fine opportunities of keeping in order the
  Protestants his ancestors had died to assist. Nor had he neglected these
  chances and was, in consequence, so keenly hated by the Magyars that he
  sometimes found it agreeable to leave his famous palace at Vesprim (which
  rivalled that at Kassel for magnificence) for the more sober splendours of
  Halstadt. Van Dollart, grim Protestant, loathed this ruthless persecutor of
  the faith, Van Dollart, honest, sober citizen, quiet family man, detested
  this costly libertine of whom he had never heard anything save what he
  considered evil, but he continued to serve him, for Aspremont Reckheim paid
  with lavish prodigality.</p>

  <p>For years the Dutchman had brought rarities and curiosities from the East
  and sold them to the purchaser who never haggled over increased prices; every
  voyage "The Water Dog" took from Amsterdam there were commissions from
  General Graf Aspremont Reckheim; each time something more uncommon, more
  difficult was required, for the soldier was one of the most considerable
  collectors of his age. Van Dollart was always very clever in nosing after
  these treasures, very adroit and unscrupulous in obtaining them, very greedy
  in asking more and more of those orders which, slipped across the tables of
  an Amsterdam bank, were so readily changed into good golden florins.</p>

  <p>In this very room lined with pale green brocade were vases of celadon,
  <i>clair de lune</i>, and Imperial Yellow, adorned with prunus and magnolia
  blossom, which Van Dollart had obtained by not the most fastidious means and
  sold at not the most reasonable figure, while the Ching-Té bowl with fishes
  in copper-red (three hundred years old, at least) which now held the sugar
  for the chocolate, had cost the blood of some obscure heathen.</p>

  <p>"I expected you before," remarked the nobleman pleasantly; he never asked
  the Dutchman to sit, but his courtesy was otherwise perfect.</p>

  <p>Van Dollart replied without any title of respect.</p>

  <p>"What you asked was not easy. I doubted I should do it at all. The return
  voyage was delayed. And," added the Dutchman grimly, "it was a rough overland
  journey from Amsterdam. And I had to come myself, there being no one I could
  trust with a matter like that."</p>

  <p>"So I suppose. I believe you always earn your money."</p>

  <p>"Amsterdam, Cologne, Coblenz, Frankfurt, Würzburg," recited the Dutchman,
  checking the stages of his travels on his coarse fingers, "it has been very
  expensive."</p>

  <p>"You want more than I promised&mdash;the five thousand rix dollars?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There would not be much profit on that."</p>

  <p>"I'll pay more. If the merchandise is worth it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand rix dollars?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Graf Aspremont Reckheim agreed easily; he would win half that by
  the bet with Culembach&mdash;besides, this particular rarity was worth it; he
  smiled in a way that made the Dutchman frown, though most people would have
  thought the nobleman very agreeable to look at. His notorious face and figure
  had the dark, swift, impatient Magyar grace and beauty; his name of Karl
  August suited him very ill, for he had nothing of the Teuton. As the Dutchman
  pouched the bankers' order he would (without scruple had it been safe to do
  so) have strangled his customer for a base, dangerous, subtle beast from the
  East&mdash;like the cruel black panther or the sly, slim snake...a
  persecuting Papist too.</p>

  <p>Almost Van Dollart was tempted not to trade with him
  again...almost&mdash;but the money?</p>

  <p>Karl August looked at the Dutchman as if he understood those slow thoughts
  of hate, and continued to smile. He had good cause; he had always obtained
  what he wanted, and till now, at thirty years of age, he had contrived to
  escape both conscience and satiety. He had no complaint to make about
  fortune, and fortune by her continued gifts seemed to show that she had no
  complaint to make about him; he certainly graced his destiny and embellished
  all the favours he received from an immoral providence.</p>

  <p>"Is she beautiful?" he asked; then added, "You would be no judge."</p>

  <p>"Eh, who?"</p>

  <p>"The Chinese woman."</p>

  <p>"I never thought about it&mdash;she is Chinese."</p>

  <p>"Young?"</p>

  <p>"Young indeed."</p>

  <p>"You have her here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the covered waggon."</p>

  <p>"Is she sad, afraid, angry?" smiled Karl August.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She has never said anything&mdash;how should she? She
  speaks only Chinese."</p>

  <p>"You have really been very clever to get her&mdash;how did you?"</p>

  <p>"A tale better not told. We went inland as far as Chuchow. We had to kill
  several heathen and one of my men got an ugly cut. Never mind. She is the
  daughter of what they call a Mandarin&mdash;a Princess to them. I can tell
  you, eight thousand rix dollars is low."</p>

  <p>"If she is really beautiful I will give you more. You know I have never
  cheapened my pleasures." It had always been his pride not to do so; he had
  always led every fashion, exploited it in the most costly and extravagant
  way, and never bargained the price; at Vesprim he had a hermitage, a classic
  ruin in marble, a village of dwarfs, a pyramid, and a temple above a cascade;
  at Halstadt he had kept his Chinese curiosities; a pagoda, a pavilion, a
  garden, and, in the house, the rarest collection of <i>famille rose</i>,
  overglaze of Wan-Li and Chia-Ching, T'ang and Sung ware.</p>

  <p>And an exquisite assortment of women's clothes and ornaments.</p>

  <p>It was these which had first made him want a Chinese woman to complete his
  rarities; as he looked at the lines, lustres and lights of the translucent
  porcelain, this want had become a desire; when Culembach had bet him four
  thousand rix dollars that he could never gratify so fantastic a wish, the
  desire had become a longing; while skilfully and cruelly repressing a
  rebellion in Transylvania his secret thoughts had been of little else than
  the Chinese woman.</p>

  <p>He went to the window, gazed beyond the curtains of peach-bloom velvet
  made to match the vases Captain van Dollart called "liver-coloured"...there
  was the small covered waggon, the horses patiently waiting...a Chinese woman
  inside...Culembach would be furious, not only because of the money, but out
  of jealousy; neither he nor any other man of Karl August's acquaintance,
  however much they might boast of their experiences, had ever possessed a
  Chinese woman.</p>

  <p>Van Dollart grinned at him, showing tobacco-stained teeth.</p>

  <p>"Will you please come and take her? I want to be on my way."</p>

  <p>Karl August preceded the Dutchman into the summer sun; he was considering
  the sumptuous, exquisite effects he would achieve with his new possession,
  how delicately she would be lodged in the pagoda of peacock blue tiles, in
  the pavilion of green and yellow lacquer, and how tastefully he would adorn
  her from his store of jade, rock crystal, onyx, malachite, rose quartz,
  enamelled gold and filigree silver.</p>

  <p>As they descended the steps the Dutchman said with dull malice:</p>

  <p>"She is not alone."</p>

  <p>"She has a servant? I told you to provide that."</p>

  <p>"No. There is some one I had to bring with her from China."</p>

  <p>Karl August paused on the step and looked up; with his hand on his hip,
  his black hair yet undressed, curling on his shoulders, and his air of swift
  action impetuously arrested, he seemed like the model for one of the heroic
  gaudy statues behind him, who flaunted stone plumes into the rich air.</p>

  <p>"Who have you brought?" he demanded. "I thought I could trust you, Van
  Dollart."</p>

  <p>"The person who is with her," replied the slow Dutchman, "is better able
  to look after her than anyone I could have supplied. As a Papist, you will
  agree."</p>

  <p>"As a Papist?" The stare of Aspremont Reckheim was contemptuous for the
  insolent heretic.</p>

  <p>"It is a nun."</p>

  <p>"A Christian nun?"</p>

  <p>Van Dollart grinned with delight at the <i>impasse</i> before the detested
  customer.</p>

  <p>"Truly a Papish nun. There is a missionary station at Chuchow. They try to
  convert the heathen. I don't grudge them the name of good women."</p>

  <p>The Dutchman licked over his words, considering with relish the dark face
  turned on him with such angry expectancy.</p>

  <p>"One of them was abroad on her errands when she saw us taking the Chinese
  lady away. And followed. She marched after us to Hangchow. She tried to
  rescue the Chinese lady. I prevented that, but I couldn't make her leave, she
  stayed with her day and night."</p>

  <p>"And you allowed it?" asked Karl August fiercely.</p>

  <p>"My men would not interfere, they thought they had done enough. There was
  a manner of superstition about it, though one was a heathen and the other a
  Papist."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you had more resource?"</p>

  <p>"Resource? I should have had to kill one of them to get them apart. You
  can do that yourself."</p>

  <p>Karl August was not so exasperated as the Dutchman had hoped to see him;
  his flash of wrath passed; as violence (unchecked, unpunished) was always in
  his power, he had not yet met a situation with which he could not deal. He
  descended the stone stairs, leaving the heavy Dutchman behind, and stood
  before the covered waggon. Cornelis eyed him with stolid curiosity, the
  Germans were all humility, one drew the blue curtains. Karl August was so
  eager to see the Chinese woman that he scarcely concerned himself about the
  nun; but, as they were seated side by side, he could not observe one without
  observing the other.</p>

  <p>The Chinese woman was very beautiful, exactly like those ladies in
  lacquer, porcelain, rice-paper painting, carved stone and ivory already in
  his possession; she was pale, pallid gold in complexion, with ebony eyes and
  hair and a smooth small vermilion mouth, her robe was dead-leaf brown and
  flecked with those broken lines used by Chinese artists to represent cracking
  ice; two pins of lapis lazuli were in her glossy locks; the nun wore the garb
  (rather soiled) of the Ursulines; Karl August saw at once that she was French
  and well-bred.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible?" she asked, "that you are General Aspremont Reckheim, the
  instigator of this heartless outrage?"</p>

  <p>"I am indeed. Captain Van Dollart has, no doubt, informed you."</p>

  <p>"Everything." The nun spoke more in compassion than indignation. "You have
  actually spent a fortune to abduct this unhappy creature from her home and
  country, and for what purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Merely to complete my collection of Chinese rarities."</p>

  <p>The nun gave him a challenging look; he had the impression that she was a
  woman of some experience, and might if a bigot, prove difficult, but he did
  not greatly concern himself about her because he was so enraptured with the
  Chinese woman who, for her part, neither spoke nor moved.</p>

  <p>He begged them to alight and they obeyed, the Chinese woman responding to
  a touch from the nun; the covered waggon with the curtains now drawn moved
  away, the Dutchman staring back with a sombre curiosity and a sulky
  vindictiveness.</p>

  <p>Never had Karl August viewed any dearly-bought treasure with such
  satisfaction (and he had had his moments of delicious achievement) as he now
  felt on gazing at the Chinese woman; he was even grateful to the nun for
  giving her company and protection; nothing, he began to consider, more
  suitable could have been devised, and he would be willing to return the
  zealous missionary to China at his own cost.</p>

  <p>He conducted them to the Chinese pavilion which he called after the
  fashion of the day, <i>Bagatelle</i>, and there suggested that the nun should
  take refuge in one of the convents at Salzburg until she felt inclined to
  journey back to Chuchow.</p>

  <p>The nun declined to leave her charge.</p>

  <p>"She is neither a slave nor a toy, monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"I happen to have bought her, madame."</p>

  <p>With that pity which, with her, took the place of scorn the nun informed
  him that a human being could not be traded, and that the Chinese woman was a
  princess, a person of education and culture, that her family would be in
  grief and desperate mourning for her, and that she herself, during the
  tiresome voyage by land and sea and land again, had endured every possible
  discomfort and alarm, "Consoled only by my company, monseigneur."</p>

  <p>Karl August, with folded arms, leaning inside the pavilion door, listened
  while the nun pleaded the cause of the Chinese lady who showed no concern,
  but stood meekly, her hands in her sleeves.</p>

  <p>"The least that you can do, monseigneur, is to return her to her home. I
  am willing to accompany her to Chuchow."</p>

  <p>"Why," he asked, "do you take such a considerable interest in a heathen, a
  creature held to be of less account than the heretics who are slaughtered
  like rats in Hungary?"</p>

  <p>"She is a woman," replied the nun, "and for your deeds of violence of
  which you boast, may God forgive you!"</p>

  <p>"You try my patience," said Karl August, "the Chinese woman is mine and I
  shall do as I please with her. I intend you no harm, but do not provoke me. I
  command much power."</p>

  <p>"But I more," the nun defied him, "God, the Pope, and the Emperor are
  behind me."</p>

  <p>Karl August was slightly uneasy at this; he reflected that the three
  personages she had mentioned were all bigots, and that he owed his own high
  fortunes to the fact that he had assumed bigotry; no slight to the Church was
  ever tolerated in the Empire.</p>

  <p>"If you attempt any harm to this noble maiden," added the nun gently, "you
  will bring on yourself the retribution for all your crimes."</p>

  <p>Karl August considered this amusing, but tiresome; he asked the nun if she
  understood Chinese: "if so, demand of the woman if she cannot be content
  here."</p>

  <p>"I speak very little Chinese, but I can assure you that she will die of a
  broken heart and home-sickness."</p>

  <p>Karl August returned to the château, considering how he should, with some
  decorum, be rid of the nun. The situation was almost stupid, almost touched
  him with ridicule...he cursed Van Dollart...the man was either a fool or
  malicious...the nun must go before Culembach knew of her presence...the
  Chinese woman must appear at the supper where and when he claimed his bet.
  Meanwhile he sent down to the pavilion a palanquin containing all the Chinese
  garments and ornaments that he had been for years collecting and gave
  instructions for the Chinese woman to be elegantly maintained. So occupied
  was he with these affairs and with thinking of his new acquisition that he
  forgot his rendezvous at the chase until the hunt swept up to his door,
  Culembach calling out to him for a laggard, and the horns blowing in jolly
  fashion of reproach.</p>

  <p>Culembach's sister, Hedwig Sophia, rode up and down the gravelled space
  where the covered waggon had rested. Karl August came out on to the winged
  staircase to answer her greeting; he was to marry her in six weeks' time and
  since Van Dollart's visit he had forgotten it; warm-coloured, yellow-haired,
  voluptuous, Hedwig Sophia smiled under her cockaded hat, waved her
  whip&mdash;had he not recalled the rendezvous of the chase? She loved him and
  this showed in her looks and gestures, she cared nothing for his reputation
  nor his wealth. She was infatuated with the man himself; she was a widow and
  had learnt toleration of male failings; she was very jealous but even more
  prudent; rather than weary her lover she had resolved to endure his
  infidelities.</p>

  <p>Hastily he joined the chase, excusing himself with Van Dollart's
  visit&mdash;"some new fangles from the East."</p>

  <p>"Anything for me?" smiled Hedwig Sophia.</p>

  <p>"Everything for you," he lied agreeably. They rode fast, side by side,
  down the wide <i>allée</i>; he wanted to marry his companion but he was
  thinking of the Chinese woman and considering that he might delay his
  marriage so as to have more leisure with his new mistress...perhaps he would
  take her to Vesprim and enthrone her in the ice grottoes or amid the village
  of dwarfs&mdash;or even build her another pavilion there and a grove of
  silver birch trees. At the first courteous opportunity he outrode Hedwig
  Sophia and came up with her brother who was leading the chase through the
  park of beech and chestnut; he told him that Van Dollart had brought the
  Chinese woman safe as a pearl shut in an oyster from Chuchow to Halstadt,
  trust the sly, grim Puritan Dutchman, eh?</p>

  <p>Culembach was chagrined; though a reigning prince he was not rich and the
  wager was high; he laughed and tried to undervalue the prize&mdash;a small,
  yellow, shrunken creature, he knew...such a one had been found abandoned in
  the Turkish camp outside Buda...Hesse Darmstadt had been infatuate with her,
  but for his part, he preferred to have his monstrosities in porcelain. "And,
  look you, Reckheim, I'll see her before I pay."</p>

  <p>"She is beautiful," asserted Karl August, with a confidence odious to the
  other. "And most rare, different from any other woman you ever saw. I would
  not take for her twice what I paid. Chinese, not African or Turk, like the
  egg-shell paste of Te-Hua, where the pink is fused from gold. To-morrow
  evening you shall see her, she is no more than seventeen and, in her own
  country, a princess."</p>

  <p>Immediately he returned from the chase Karl August, refusing the
  invitation of Hedwig Sophia to ride home with her, hastened to the pavilion
  called <i>Bagatelle</i>, in the Chinese garden. Lamps of porcelain and
  lacquer had been lit in the lattice windows; their thin, fine light made long
  elegant shadows from the delicate leaves of young bamboo and yellow maple;
  the twilight was hushed and luscious. Karl August peered through the
  curtains, the Chinese woman was within, she had arrayed herself in one of the
  robes, coral red, orange-yellow; she had made herself tea in one of his
  services of Wu Ts'ai or five-colour ware with ruby-backed plates, she had set
  a branch of pearl-colour maple in one of his bronze vases, and appeared at
  home and happy; her hands, moving in the wide blue satin sleeves, were like
  flowers drifting on water, opening and closing in a kind breeze; they were
  the hue of pale clover honey; where the shadow stole over her throat it was
  the warm tint of amber; dark gold appeared in her eyes and hair where the
  light burnished the black lustre; her mouth had the fresh, dewy redness of a
  petal plucked as it unfolds in early summer from the bud. Karl August did not
  enter the pavilion; the nun was seated inside the door; her habit appeared
  grotesque among those Eastern trifles, her face appeared old, ugly, sad,
  compared with the face of the Chinese woman; as Karl August left
  <i>Bagatelle</i> he noticed that a wooden crucifix had been fastened over the
  curved horns hung with bells, at the entrance. He began to be more uneasy,
  disturbed by sensations new to him; it was remarkable that he, who had
  committed so many lawless acts of violence, could not now commit another; it
  would really be easy to force away the nun; he was not, he assured himself,
  superstitious, and he did not believe in God&mdash;scandal could be avoided;
  why, then, this detestable hesitation?</p>

  <p>He passed a disagreeable night; his mind dwelt most curiously on the
  Chinese woman; he believed she could give new variety to an emotion he had
  almost staled, she was more than beautiful, she had some magic...</p>

  <p>When a flying post brought news from Vesprim of a revolt among the
  heretics, Karl August was an angry man; he declared that the Emperor's
  business could wait until he had finished his own and sent orders to his
  lieutenant to burn and slay without pause or mercy. To punish himself for his
  cowardice he kept away from the pavilion; but he sent an order to the nun
  that the Chinese woman must be sent up to the château that evening to sit
  beside him at his supper-table. The nun's reply was submissive, "But if she
  is not returned by eight o'clock I shall come to fetch her."</p>

  <p>Karl August raged because he could not have the insolent woman removed;
  sulky and violent he meditated a revenge that would be the sterner for being
  deferred; he knew himself capable of complete cruelty; his uneasiness
  increased.</p>

  <p>There were six gentlemen at the supper, companions in arms and pleasures.
  The windows were open on to the monstrous moon, the melody of caged
  nightingales, on the voices of Siennese boys singing to zithers, and on the
  steady, recurrent splash of a fountain that was as monotonous as a
  heart-beat.</p>

  <p>The decoration of the room was Chinese. White satin on walls, and chairs
  with tiny figures of mandarins, a plum-coloured carpet with blue dragons
  petalled like chrysanthemums, a table of cinnabar lacquer the work of two
  generations, a hanging lamp of inlaid ivory and shell, services of egg-shell
  porcelain, <i>sang-de-boeuf</i>, Lang-Yao, and <i>flambé</i> or red copper
  glaze; some of the priceless curiosities "The Water Dog" had brought, packed
  among the coffee, tea, pepper and spices in her hold, to Amsterdam. An
  aromatic odour still clung to these delicate objects; the air was perfumed
  with cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and attar of roses; in contrast to this exotic
  elegance the six guests showed robust and hearty, with their fair, red faces,
  their curled, powdered hair, their bright coloured velvet and satin coats,
  their Paris paste and steel appointments cut to a diamond glitter.</p>

  <p>The Chinese woman entered, carried in her palanquin; she could not stand
  for more than a moment on her tiny feet in the slippers stitched with
  sequins; she was placed carefully, as if she had been a doll, beside
  Aspremont Reckheim; the gentlemen all gazed eagerly at this curiosity; they
  were really not sure that she was alive. Her quilted outer robe of sea-green
  silk being removed by Karl August showed her dress of festival gold, a massed
  design of webs and blossoms in bullion threads, her sash of azure satin,
  stiffened with silver wires, her necklets of white jade, of smoked crystal,
  of scarlet cords with beads of rose quartz, tourmaline and chrysolite; above
  the smooth black billows of her hair quivered metallic flowers of silver,
  copper and gold, which appeared finer than nature in filaments, pistils and
  petals that stirred with the least movement. All of the guests had travelled
  and each possessed a closet of curiosities, but none of them had ever seen
  any rarity like this wonder.</p>

  <p>She bowed, and then spoke.</p>

  <p>A little cascade of meaningless sound soft, mellow as drowsy notes from
  the soft-plumed throat of a bird, fell from her vermilion lips; she bowed
  again, folded her hands into her sleeves, was silent.</p>

  <p>They murmured surprise, admiration, envy; Culembach had his rix dollars
  bond ready; he slipped it along the table. Karl August pocketed it without
  satisfaction; he was tormented by the desire to know what the Chinese woman
  thought and felt, to possess her mind and soul as well as her person; never
  had he heard anything so tantalizing as that soft incomprehensible speech; he
  had never failed, one way or another with a woman before, but now he was
  baffled; he glowered where he should have been triumphant. And before the
  Lang-Yao clock struck eight he sent her away because of the intolerable nun,
  who would, he was sure, keep her word.</p>

  <p>Culembach lingered after the others had gone; Karl August scowled at the
  continued intrusion; he wanted to go down to the pavilion which would be
  glittering in the moonshine...he had other treasures to give her, a bracelet
  of yellow jade, a bowl of alabaster so fine as to be transparent, a box of
  vermilion orange lacquer...perhaps, if he put these before her she would
  speak again in that meaningless and enchanting language.</p>

  <p>The Margraf of Culembach began to praise the Chinese lady...he offered to
  buy her...</p>

  <p>"As a dilettante?" asked Karl August.</p>

  <p>"As a man," said Culembach.</p>

  <p>Karl August refused to consider any offer; Culembach said that he would
  give more than money; his Arab-Polish horse called "<i>La Folie</i>," who was
  the most perfectly trained animal in the Empire, his pair of <i>bleu de
  roi</i> Sèvres vases which had taken three years to paint. As Karl August
  remained contemptuous Culembach offered his summer palace in the mountains
  that the other had often envied. On receiving an abrupt refusal the Margraf,
  a short-tempered man, purpled in the face; the two parted in dislike of each
  other; this was the first time that Karl August had quarrelled with the
  brother of Hedwig Sophia. The Margraf's offers had put the final value on the
  Chinese woman; she was indeed priceless; her owner could think of nothing for
  which he would surrender her. Yet he allowed the days to pass without
  disturbing her, because of the nun, because of some sacred magic which
  enclosed her, because of something in himself? Was he being drawn into a new
  unimagined world? He did not know; he became melancholy, moody, yet excited
  and violent; if only he could discover what the Chinese woman was thinking,
  if she was happy, if he could make her happy, what she was saying when she
  bowed and spoke sweetly, rapidly. Every day he visited her and sat, brooding,
  on a divan, while he watched her; the nun was always present and he had
  ceased to resent this; he gave the Chinese woman a little zither and she
  played on it thin melodies of heartbreaking sadness. The greatest pleasure of
  Karl August was, however, to watch her unperceived, to linger hidden among
  the maples and bamboos while she walked by the pond or sang at her window, or
  drank tea, or played with a white cat.</p>

  <p>Culembach rode over frequently and tried to bargain for what he called
  this <i>bibelot de prix</i>. He also seemed fascinated by the Chinese woman
  whom, however, he had only seen once; the two men began to detest each other;
  the Margraf pointed out that General Aspremont Reckheim's post was in
  Hungary&mdash;what leave had he to linger in Salzburg, while there was a
  revolt in his command?</p>

  <p>Hedwig Sophia came too frequently to Halstadt; Karl August suspected her
  brother of making trouble; the lady longed too often to be taken to the
  pavilion, the pagoda, and on excuse or refusal became too sweetly submissive.
  She knew, of course, from her brother, about the Chinese woman and she was
  sick with terror lest she should lose her lover; she was afraid of his
  abstracted air, his gloomy indifference to her caresses, his dark, sullen
  face; she wished to marry him and go to Hungary to quell the rebellion, to
  please him she would have witnessed the slaughter of hundreds of heretics,
  but Karl August suspended all his affairs.</p>

  <p>He gradually made a confidante of the nun; she was of his own world and
  intelligent; she appeared to like him, she was at least very tolerant; he
  endeavoured to discover from her every scrap of information about the Chinese
  woman...her mind, her nature, her habits, what she believed, or wished, or
  feared...</p>

  <p>The nun knew very little; she could not, save for a word or two,
  understand her companion's speech, but she always declared that she was very
  home-sick; at night she would weep and pray to a little crystal image which
  to Aspremont Reckheim was a toy, but to her a god.</p>

  <p>Always the nun ended:</p>

  <p>"You must assuredly send her home, monseigneur, it is your only chance to
  palliate a great wrong. No doubt you acted more in wantonness than malice,
  but now you understand that you have not bought a carving or a jewel, but a
  human creature."</p>

  <p>"Give me some credit," Karl August would reply bitterly, "that I have not
  molested her."</p>

  <p>The nun had a smile for that.</p>

  <p>"You cannot. You do not dare."</p>

  <p>The haughty, violent man raged. He stared at himself in many mirrors; he
  had always disliked his person, inherited from a defeated people he had
  betrayed; no powder could efface that black hair, no art alter those straight
  fine features, no imperial uniform make him appear of the conquering race. A
  Magyar, one with those he crushed and slew...he had burnt a church once with
  a hundred worshippers within, and watched while his troopers thrust the
  wretches back into the flames...every face shrieking to death had been like
  his face...detestable, and giving him the air of a renegade. He passionately
  wished he was like Culembach, the dominant Northern stock...who did he appear
  to the Chinese woman?</p>

  <p>She remained unchanged; patiently she waited through the luscious autumn
  days. The lilies on the pond withered, the bamboos and maples shed their
  leaves, the sunshine took a mellower tinge; in meek resignation the Chinese
  woman waited; only her songs became more plaintive, her music the melody of
  an exile, and her slanting eyes glittered with tears as she prayed to her
  crystal god.</p>

  <p>"Send her home before the winter," said the nun.</p>

  <p>"Sell her to me," insisted Culembach.</p>

  <p>"Marry me," implored Hedwig Sophia.</p>

  <p>While the Emperor's commands came stern from Vienna:</p>

  <p>"Go immediately to Hungary."</p>

  <p>Aspremont Reckheim did none of these things. He was entirely, and, for the
  first time in his life, occupied with his own soul; he ascended to stormy
  heights and grovelled in murky depths; all his possessions became earthly
  baubles, the wind in the bare trees at night was of peculiar importance; the
  sight of the moon touched him to nothingness, and the vapourous sunshine was
  bitter-sweet to agony; he was in full pursuit of something flying beyond his
  reach, a chase that would snatch him off the globe into darkness, for what he
  sought was hidden surely beyond the farthest star.</p>

  <p>Culembach one evening penetrated the Chinese garden; he only saw all the
  lattices of the pavilion flicked down and heard the mournful note of a
  zither; but Karl August posted a guard of his own regiment round the Oriental
  pleasance.</p>

  <p>With the waning of October came the news of the sacking of his château at
  Vesprim; the rebels had broken into his costly grounds, smashed the pyramid,
  lit bonfires in the grottos, kicked to pieces the ice caves, set free the
  dwarfs in the village. These tiny monsters had frolicked up to the mansion
  and, mad with liberty, destroyed all they could discover, then drunk
  themselves to death amid shards of porcelain, tatters of silk and fragments
  of gilt wood. The rabble had cracked the cedar-wood chapel as if it had been
  a nut; angels, saints and crucifixes were tumbled out to be trampled into the
  parterres of the coronary garden. At night the flames of Vesprim appeared to
  smite the moon; blood, bones, and the value of a million rix dollars were
  consumed.</p>

  <p>Close on this news Hedwig Sophia rode to Halstadt, her mood beyond
  subterfuge or prudence.</p>

  <p>"Why do you linger? See what has befallen. There was no such palace save
  at Kassel."</p>

  <p>"I can build another," he replied sternly, "if I am not too old for
  playthings."</p>

  <p>Golden, rosy, flushed, distracted with emotion, Hedwig Sophia passionately
  replied:</p>

  <p>"Playthings? You think of nothing else. You are a fool for this Chinese
  woman."</p>

  <p>"You know of her, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, am I imbecile? Theodor, also, is obsessed by her&mdash;what is it? I
  have suffered it long enough...Do you not think of me at all? Do you not
  think of your duty? You will be ruined, disgraced, if you do not go to
  Hungary."</p>

  <p>Striking her hand with her riding whip Hedwig Sophia trembled in the rich
  firelight.</p>

  <p>"For a Chinese woman!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"She is not my mistress," he said dryly. "I cannot even speak to her. I
  have never touched her."</p>

  <p>Amazed and frightened, Hedwig Sophia asked: "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"But you keep her there, hidden at <i>Bagatelle?</i> Theodor heard her
  sing."</p>

  <p>"He'll not again. Yes, I keep her there, immaculate. She is like nothing
  you could imagine, Hedwig. I cannot speak of it."</p>

  <p>"But you love me." Hedwig Sophia was hurried into open avowal of her pain.
  "This is a whim, it can, it must be dispelled. We will go together to Hungary
  and regain what you have lost."</p>

  <p>"I have lost nothing," mused Karl August.</p>

  <p>"You have lost me," retorted the passionate woman, "and I was something to
  you once."</p>

  <p>Very little; how women overestimated themselves! He could not tell her
  that, nor how many fair women, soft, easy, there were in the world, very
  ready to the hand of a man like himself. Her rank prevented Hedwig Sophia
  from knowing how ordinary she was; she pleaded with him hopelessly; she
  really believed the man bewitched, and though she loved him no less for that
  she endeavoured to sting him with taunts.</p>

  <p>"How can you dally here? You must be a scorn at Vienna&mdash;nothing will
  save you if you do not go at once&mdash;I could not marry an idler&mdash;or,
  is it a coward?"</p>

  <p>"Tell your brother to come and ask that," he suggested, thinking he would
  relish an opportunity to quarrel violently with Culembach.</p>

  <p>"I will, oh, I will!"</p>

  <p>She flung away; he thought he could hear her angry sobbing long after she
  had gone; he was indifferent to her suffering, she was pampered, selfish,
  cruel, as he had been.</p>

  <p>The posts from Buda and an <i>Express</i> from Vesprim waited in his
  antechambers while he was closeted with the nun; he had sent for her from the
  pavilion, which he had not visited for several days; a faint blue haze lay
  over the park; the nun warmed cold fingers at the frost-clear fire.</p>

  <p>General Aspremont Reckheim stood with his hands clasped behind him; he
  wore a careless civilian dress and had neglected to pomade the black locks
  that he detested.</p>

  <p>The nun smiled at him pleasantly; her face was peaked and thin between the
  folds of linen; she stooped slightly, some small dead leaves clung to the hem
  of her grey robe.</p>

  <p>"You have held out against me a long time," he said.</p>

  <p>The nun continued to smile.</p>

  <p>"I love the Chinese woman," said Karl August.</p>

  <p>"Then you will send her home, of course?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You do not love her, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"It is terrible how I love her&mdash;I cannot endure to see her because my
  thoughts of her torment me so. I meant the affair for a jest, for a caprice,
  to win a wager and a little mistress for a while. I have been horribly
  ensnared."</p>

  <p>The nun considered him with pity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is how it happens. One does lightly a wicked deed and it closes
  on one's soul like a vice."</p>

  <p>"I have done worse things," he replied, "and never heeded them."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this is the punishment for them all, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"It is enough," he sighed. "She is so hemmed in that I cannot approach
  her...hedged about&mdash;what with?"</p>

  <p>"Innocence, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"I have overcome that before."</p>

  <p>"Alas, Monseigneur!"</p>

  <p>"You have laid a spell round her." He tried to smile. "You have conquered.
  I will marry her."</p>

  <p>The nun shook her head.</p>

  <p>"She is not a Christian."</p>

  <p>"I will have her baptized; I will give her my mother's name."</p>

  <p>"She would not understand. She does not care for you. She only longs for
  her home. If you keep her she will die."</p>

  <p>"I would not let her die. I can make women happy and I love her so
  much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, certainly you will return her to Chuchow. Love has only one way,
  Monseigneur, it serves, it does not think of self; either," added the nun,
  "you use a word you do not understand, or you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Karl August looked away.</p>

  <p>"What should I do when she was gone?"</p>

  <p>"Take up your duty. Return to Hungary and endeavour to obtain justice and
  mercy for the rebels and heretics your kinspeople."</p>

  <p>"It is too difficult. I cannot part with her and I'll not tolerate them.
  You are defeated."</p>

  <p>"Not I, but you, General Reckheim."</p>

  <p>He dismissed her; with a sweep of his wide cuff and heavy ruffles he
  knocked over all the stupid trifles on his bureau, splinters of egg-shell
  porcelain scattered on the carpet; he stamped on them while the posts
  waited.</p>

  <p>For three days he was shut in his rooms; at nights the frosts fell and the
  dawns were slow and heavy; a despatch from the Emperor awaited his pleasure;
  another week's delay and he would be superseded in his command; Culembach
  wrote violently demanding explanation, satisfaction for an insulted sister;
  all this was chaff in the wind to Aspremont Reckheim. He went down through
  the still cold, the bare park to the withered winter-bitten Chinese garden
  where the pavilion showed stark amid the desolation of the trees; the
  brilliant tiles were rimed with frost which had melted in drops of moisture
  on the bells above the horned gate, there was no sound of zither or
  voice.</p>

  <p>"How has this come on me who was so sure of myself? I, who did not know of
  the unattainable, to be overcome by desire I I, who was always resolute, to
  be thus baffled I I shall never know her heart or her mind, or what she said
  in her lovely language; she will never lead me into the world where she
  moves."</p>

  <p>He did not cross the confines of her domain, but, returning to the
  château, sent a letter to the nun:</p>

  <p class="letter">Take the Chinese woman back, command my means. I leave for
  Buda.</p>

  <p>And he thought: "When they are gone I will have the Chinese gardens, the
  pavilion and the pagoda demolished&mdash;and never again will I trade with
  Van Dollart."</p>

  <p>General Aspremont Reckheim appeared in the full accoutrements that he had
  so long put aside, and rode at the head of the troop of horse he was leading
  to the Imperial headquarters near the ruins of Vesprim. The wan day had
  wasted to the bleached grey of twilight; the dark soldier saw nothing but a
  mist-bound horizon; his companions rode apart, awed by his grim air of gloom;
  he had not reached the limits of the estate before he was overtaken by a
  Heyduck with a bruised face, urging an exhausted horse; his panted news,
  gasped out as his master drew rein, was brief.</p>

  <p>"The Margraf has carried off the Chinese woman."</p>

  <p>This was to Karl August as if the scornful hand of God had, out of the
  menacing sky, struck him one blow...and sufficient.</p>

  <p>"They surprised us, five hundred men&mdash;the Princess Hedwig Sophia was
  there&mdash;the instant, sir, you had departed."</p>

  <p>Karl August turned back at the gallop; by using three relays he arrived at
  Culembach's château by nightfall.</p>

  <p>No one thwarted his entrance; he believed that some catastrophe beyond
  violence had occurred; he had outridden his company and entered the house
  alone; room after room was empty and quiet; he would not call her because he
  did not know her name; in a high ornate chamber he found the nun, very weary,
  and praying; she saw his face and said:</p>

  <p>"You must not kill them. They have been very gentle. Besides, it was too
  late. She would never have reached home; she was dying."</p>

  <p>With her old, tired gait she preceded him to the next room.</p>

  <p>The Chinese woman was on a sofa; Culembach and Hedwig gazed at her in
  silence, holding hands for company in their guilt; Karl August did not see
  them or their misery; he knelt beside the sofa and said words he had never
  said before, save falsely.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, for God's sake, forgive me!"</p>

  <p>The Chinese woman sat up and looked at him; she bowed, she spoke directly
  to him, a low murmur of delicate sound. He was sure that she spoke only to
  him not to the nun; never would he know what she said; she could not speak
  for long, for she was occupied with the matter of dying. She bowed again and
  turned to her repose; she seemed to fold herself together, like a flower,
  furled petal by petal round a dead heart.</p>

  <p>Never would his pursuit overtake her, never would she teach him her
  speech, nor admit him to that world which he now knew of and must ever weary
  after; never could she relieve his desolation.</p>

  <p>Dead, she appeared no more than a toy, <i>Bagatelle</i>, an Eastern puppet
  on the coquettish sofa. Karl August looked inwards and found detestable
  company; himself grinning in loneliness.</p>

  <h2>A FLOURISH FOR DRUMS</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>With an accompaniment for trumpets set for the Imperial
  Army of the Czar of All the Russias under Prince Zadikov at the Château
  Brockenstein.</i> [BOHEMIA, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew was familiar with Europe and Europe was tolerably familiar
  with Miss Pettigrew; she had permitted herself every indulgence save an
  indiscretion; those who knew most about her, applauded her the most
  warmly&mdash;for tact, elegance and an inflexible courage, concealed behind
  the most becoming air of timidity; those who knew least about her, admired
  her for a great lady whose dignity was never flecked with blame; all who knew
  anything of her, conceded her greater gifts than her too celebrated beauty;
  she never forgot any circumstance, however trifling, and she never lost her
  composure in any event, however disturbing. She was extremely well-bred and
  so finely trained that she never allowed any of her lovers to discover that
  she was an intelligent woman; she knew, exquisitely well, how to give an
  enchanting air of caprice to the most adroitly conceived plan, how to beggar
  a man negligently as if she had no idea of the value of money, and how to
  confer her favours with an air of sweet, overwhelmed reluctance, as if she
  succumbed for the first and last time; she had a high sense of honour, but
  this, masked behind the laughing grimace of folly, was a masculine code; that
  of her own sex, from her early years, she had found trivial and inconvenient.
  Her secret regret was that she had never met a man quite worthy of her
  talents; no one with that right mingling of honour and humour, grace and
  spirit, to deal with her exactly as she was, no more and no less than
  himself.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew had been visiting the Electoral Court of Dresden and had
  found it rather dull; the most interesting portion of the population was at
  the war; Miss Pettigrew discovered the time was long between the opening of
  the campaigns and the closing, when the troops came into winter quarters and
  made the cities lively. With unperturbed good spirits, however, she retired
  with the Ursins Trainel to their château of Brockenstein between the darkness
  of the Bohemian forests and the brightness of the river Moldau. Like thunder
  on a midsummer day the distant bolts of war rattled in the background of a
  <i>fête champêtre</i>; Ursins Trainel was an old man, his wife timid, the
  others of the household were servants; rumours began to deaden the air with
  panic, refugees pressed against the haughty scrolls of the iron gates of the
  Park, crept to sleep in the wide allées, and begged for bread at the doors of
  the château; refugees from Silesia...</p>

  <p>Prince Zadikov, the commander of the troops of the Czar of All the
  Russias, putting under his heel a rebellious Poland, striking a rebellious
  Silesia, was advancing to face the Circle of Franconia in Munich; with every
  flash of news that came, fear grew more horrible at Brockenstein; the Ursins
  Trainel had no interest in the tedious war, but they were technically enemies
  of Russia...if Zadikov should chance to march that way...no one knew his
  objective...if it was Munich, then Brockenstein lay directly in his path; M.
  d'Ursins Trainel was faced with the alternative of abandoning his property,
  his peasants, his dignity, or risking a visit from Zadikov.</p>

  <p>This general had the worst of reputations; cruel, unscrupulous,
  implacable, extravagant..."a Tartar, in one word," said M. d'Ursins Trainel,
  sitting gloomily in his great shadowed salon and drinking tea from a cup of
  powder blue; the small agitated company began to decry Zadikov; there was no
  crime they did not charge to his account, no vice with which he was not
  familiar.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew sat at a desk slightly apart; her wardrobe was a little
  depleted; she was making a list for her next visit to Paris: a roll of
  watered bronze silk for a cloak, a pair of green velvet slippers, a garland
  of jasmine flowers in pearls...She looked up to listen to what they were
  exclaiming, in terror and rage, of Zadikov.</p>

  <p>"They say he plays the harpsichord exquisitely," she remarked, "I should
  like to hear him."</p>

  <p>"The man is&mdash;beyond our discussion," declared M. d'Ursins Trainel
  coldly, "there is nothing detestable that he has not done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hear he has good manners," said Miss Pettigrew, reflectively. "I should
  like to see him."</p>

  <p>"You may have the opportunity," replied one of the ladies drily, "and then
  you would repent your wish&mdash;though you have always been slightly
  enamoured of the Devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is, at least, <i>grand seigneur</i>," remarked Miss Pettigrew, "while
  <i>le bon Dieu</i>&mdash;eh, a pity that the Almighty never understood good
  breeding."</p>

  <p>"I fear you have no soul, Miss Pettigrew, possibly no heart," sighed
  Madame d'Ursins Trainel, "you put virtue at a discount."</p>

  <p>"Because it has done so much harm," smiled Miss Pettigrew, "encouraged ill
  manners, muddy complexions and sour speeches...virtue, eh? What is it but an
  invention of those who have nothing else to boast of?"</p>

  <p>While they conversed there came further news of Zadikov&mdash;the worst;
  he was marching straight on Brockenstein with his Russian and Imperial troops
  (for the campaign, at least, the Emperor leagued with the Czar), his
  Cossacks, Uhlans, Black Cuirassiers...a trail of fire, blood and ruin across
  Silesia as across Poland; he had crossed the Vistula on pontoons, he would
  soon be crossing the Moldau.</p>

  <p>"He grows flowers," said Miss Pettigrew, "he will be interested in your
  glasshouses, Monsieur."</p>

  <p>She added to her list: "blue velvet corsets cut very low, saffron silk
  garters with knots of coral beads..."</p>

  <p>The Château was to be abandoned, every one must fly as best they could,
  back into Bavaria, to Munich or Nuremburg; every coach, horse and waggon was
  brought out of the stables; the men looked up all guns, powder, swords,
  knives; the women ran from room to room, snatching up and packing ornaments
  of gold and silver, of fine porcelain and alabaster.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew disliked confusion and agitation. She retired to her
  chamber; it was a delightful day in September and from her high window she
  looked on a voluptuous prospect of shimmering gold&mdash;wood, mountain,
  river, azure horizon...it would be an evening, a night, such as many vaguely
  love but few know how to enjoy...but Miss Pettigrew was an expert in such
  delicacies of delight; she leant from the window and allowed the afternoon
  breeze that floated from the upper plumes of the airy trees to disturb her
  locks of dark English gold...when her hostess hastened in on her she found
  her thus with her possessions untouched.</p>

  <p>"Are you not packed, Miss Pettigrew? Are you not ready? There is no time,
  not a moment! Everyone is departing...most are gone."</p>

  <p>"Nay, dear Madame, do not be alarmed. I have never heard of women of our
  position being inconvenienced."</p>

  <p>"We deal with Zadikov," Madame d'Ursins Trainel spoke in despair. "He sent
  a detachment of Cossacks this morning to demand the surrender of Budweis, our
  nearest town...we have just heard&mdash;they refused."</p>

  <p>"Fools!" remarked Miss Pettigrew.</p>

  <p>"Fools indeed I The town is unfortified...it will fall in half an
  hour...the Cossacks returned to Zadikov with the threat to pillage the entire
  country...he will make his headquarters here...<i>Eh, Mon Dieu</i>! come at
  once."</p>

  <p>"I have seen a pillaged town," said the English lady thoughtfully. "I
  remember it very well&mdash;those crazy wretches in Budweis&mdash;children,
  too, and old people...I might have had daughters myself."</p>

  <p>Madame d'Ursins Trainel did not listen to this, she was weeping.</p>

  <p>"The Burgomaster is here, he has repented his obstinacy and is imploring
  us to help him; we can do nothing but advise the inhabitants of Budweis to
  fly with us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such as have horses or carts," smiled Miss Pettigrew, "I believe the
  Russians are in excellent condition&mdash;how long before they overtook this
  poor rabble?"</p>

  <p>"They must take their fortune!" cried Madame d'Ursins Trainel, distracted.
  "Do you come and not waste your time."</p>

  <p>"I will follow you," replied Miss Pettigrew, to be rid of her. The lady
  fled, and, in the hurry of her mischances, forgot her foreign guest; Miss
  Pettigrew called her maid; the girl had gone. Miss Pettigrew herself took
  from the wardrobe a shift of Indian mull worked with a million white flowers,
  transparent as a breath of vapour, and a holster pistol inlaid with ivory
  which had belonged to her father, slain at Philipsbourg; she placed both on
  her bed and went downstairs; in a short space of time the tumult had stilled;
  everyone had left the château. From a window on the stairway Miss Pettigrew
  could see the procession of coaches, of carts, of horses, winding along the
  high road towards Bavaria; their laborious overladen progress gave them a
  depressed and defeated air; not every one had left the château. In the salon
  where lately they had been drinking tea sat the Burgomaster of
  Budweis&mdash;a man overwhelmed by disaster; but he had had the fortitude not
  to follow the others; he had remained to face the consequences of his own
  folly; few, thought Miss Pettigrew, can do more.</p>

  <p>He rose, the stout elderly man, amazed at the appearance of a lady in the
  château he had believed so swiftly deserted, stood stammering, for an
  explanation?</p>

  <p>"There is none," Miss Pettigrew reassured him. "I dislike hurried
  journeys&mdash;they have overlooked my absence, no one is of importance in a
  panic. You, sir, retire to Budweis&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"You remain here&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>"My fancies make a crowded company. Why were you so imprudent as to refuse
  to surrender the town?"</p>

  <p>"I was badly advised...the burghers were afraid of their property..."</p>

  <p>"And now must be afraid for their lives."</p>

  <p>"Alas! if I could die for all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You cannot. Budweis will be sacked to-morrow, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless?" he demanded, eager at the sparkle of hope in her words.</p>

  <p>"Prince Zadikov should prove merciful."</p>

  <p>The Burgomaster began sorrowfully to relate some of the cruel stories
  current about the Russian; Miss Pettigrew interrupted:</p>

  <p>"Eh, we all have our legends! Perhaps I can save Budweis."</p>

  <p>"You! Pardon me, but you! You remain here...?"</p>

  <p>"To meet this Tartar, this monster, this dragon...Compose yourself, sir,
  and return to Budweis to tell your citizens to hope."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me again, Madame, but what do you know of Zadikov?"</p>

  <p>"That he is an expert in music&mdash;in flowers&mdash;we shall have points
  of contact&mdash;the <i>décor</i>, too, the evening, how exquisite! The man
  must have some sensibility."</p>

  <p>The Burgomaster did not quite understand what the lady meant, but he
  gathered courage from her beauty, her resolute air, her serenity.</p>

  <p>"It is a tradition of Budweis," he faltered, "that in the ancient days it
  was saved from a ravening beast by a virgin martyr&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew kept a smile from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I hope Prince Zadikov will be no more a ravening beast than I am a...a
  martyr," she replied gravely, not to offend the old man's simplicity. "Now,
  sir, return to Budweis."</p>

  <p>"Shall I not send you some women...at least?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" murmured Miss Pettigrew, with recollection of some of
  the good wives of Budweis, "tell them to keep within their walls."</p>

  <p>She got rid of him, saw him riding away amazed on his mule, and returned
  to the emptiness of the château...a virgin martyr She laughed, not without
  irony and her face became serious; she had experienced so much, the rise and
  break of passion, the ebb and flow of emotion, the smooth conveniency of
  compromise, the surge of rebellion, the look of disillusion in her own
  mirrored eyes the moment before satiety when disgust must be strangled at
  birth, the moment before consummation when some gorgeous hope must be
  foregone&mdash;she had learnt so much, balance, humour, grace, tolerance, to
  overlay the tedious years with rich trifles, to enjoy every possible beauty
  and delight, to keep her dignity immaculate. She had evolved a philosophy and
  morality in one: miss no pleasure, weary no one and allow no one to weary
  you, be an epicure in your indulgences...never confess and never
  repent...flee boredom as the most deadly of the sins...She had not always had
  as pleasant a background as this, so many clothes in her trunks, so much
  money in her pockets...she had known her reverses, like Zadikov...she, like
  him, had been sometimes in retreat, and would be again in full flight one
  day, before the enemy tracing wrinkles in her face and fading the dark amber
  of her hair...but, to-day&mdash;"Perhaps," said Miss Pettigrew, "we can both
  be victorious."</p>

  <p>She was not alone in the chateau; a negress waited in the corridor, seated
  on a stool between two gilt model cannon and caressing a silver deerhound;
  the lady remembered her for doing her a kindness, when Madame d'Ursins
  Trainel had chided her for laziness; the creature was faithful, then...She
  looked up at Miss Pettigrew with tears in her handsome eyes and caught the
  end of her scarf, imploring to be permitted to stay; she, of all of them, had
  noticed that the English woman had remained in the chateau.</p>

  <p>"Poor Corinne," said Miss Pettigrew, "certainly you may stay&mdash;there
  is nothing to be afraid of&mdash;the dog, too?"</p>

  <p>Yes, the dog was loyal to the negress; he had refused to leave her; they
  looked charming, the lady thought&mdash;Corinne, strong and graceful, her
  bronze body wrapped in a glittering scarlet tissue, an agraffe of yellow
  plumes bound to her black curls, the hound fine and light as a curling
  feather, pale as a moonbeam.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew reflected.</p>

  <p>"The salon shows signs of disorder, see to that, Corinne; we must be
  clever and leave nothing to chance. Then you will see what they have left in
  the house and prepare some supper&mdash;set it out, wine and fruit, as
  elegantly as possible, set it out in the salon."</p>

  <p>The negress sprang up, eager and delighted at being used; Miss Pettigrew
  directed her to arrange the great room that opened so nobly on the terraces
  and the steps; here a chair overturned, there a vase toppled down, a tapestry
  awry, a couch upset, a screen fallen, all soon deftly arranged, and the
  beautiful harpsichord painted with garlands of tender <i>amorini</i> and
  stately laurels opened, and set in place; fresh candles put in the lustres
  and in the brackets. Before they had completed these adjustments the patrols
  of Zadikov were entering the park, frightening the deer, disturbing the cool
  silence of the long glades; the sun had disappeared behind the high boughs of
  the chestnuts and elms and filled the air with the vaporous glow of unearthly
  gold. Miss Pettigrew glanced at herself in the mirror behind the harpsichord;
  she had made no alteration in her attire, she appeared as an English
  gentlewoman, in grey sarcenet with slim ruffles, her hair but slightly
  powdered, her face as it had smiled from the canvas by Mr. Gainsborough when
  he had painted her but last year.</p>

  <p>The patrols had reported the château deserted; Zadikov and his staff rode
  negligently through the park; Zadikov, whose life had been all action,
  admired the contrast of this fine repose, the graceful vistas, the flying
  deer, the lofty, whispering trees, the fastidious château, elegant behind the
  wide terraces and shallow steps, with the fountain in front where a nereid in
  marble blew up long jets of water into the azure air. Zadikov and his
  officers dismounted. The long windows beyond the terrace stood open as if to
  receive them; the Russians ascended the steps, slowly, carelessly, jaded
  after the long march. Miss Pettigrew came to the window and looked at them;
  she was slightly shortsighted and narrowed her eyes in an effort to discover
  which was Zadikov. Perceiving her, the Russians stopped and spoke quickly,
  one to another; she guessed what they said&mdash;"A trap!" She knew that
  Zadikov lived under the constant menace of assassination; she came out on to
  the terrace, to the head of the steps, and one man detached himself from the
  hesitant group and came straight up to meet her&mdash;Zadikov&mdash;she knew
  him better by that action than by his cords and laces, his orders and
  sashes.</p>

  <p>"Prince Zadikov," she said, in French, "I regret that I can only offer you
  a poor entertainment, such as it is, you are welcome."</p>

  <p>He answered in French as correct as her own.</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, I am grateful, Madame."</p>

  <p>His officers were crowding up behind him, as if to threaten and protect;
  Miss Pettigrew smiled.</p>

  <p>"I regret, Monseigneur, that I cannot receive your friends&mdash;I am
  inconvenienced by lack of service, of provisions&mdash;I am alone in the
  château."</p>

  <p>"You are alone?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"No, I forgot&mdash;there is a negress and a dog&mdash;the only creatures
  not afraid of you, Prince Zadikov; will you enter?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadily; he was as well-trained in quick scrutiny as
  she; he did not pause but leisurely followed her across the terrace, telling
  his officers to wait for him.</p>

  <p>"You are French, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"English."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;and alone?&mdash;here? You knew I was coming..."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. And your reputation. I wanted to receive you."</p>

  <p>Zadikov smiled.</p>

  <p>"Seldom have I had a prettier compliment." He entered the great salon,
  then filled with golden dusk, following her.</p>

  <p>She saw his glance flicker to the large gilt screen behind the supper
  table; she had not thought of that, nor of the attempts on his life&mdash;it
  would be very natural that he should take this for a trap; she could see the
  angry suspicious faces of his officers as they, despite his orders, crept
  closer to the open windows.</p>

  <p>"Will you believe that I am alone here?" she asked courteously. "Will you
  accept my company this evening? I know nothing of politics, little of
  war&mdash;your Highness will risk nothing but&mdash;boredom!"</p>

  <p>"I am never bored," said Zadikov; he moved so that he stood with his back
  to the screen; had there been anyone behind it, he could have been killed
  instantly.</p>

  <p>Brave! thought Miss Pettigrew; her blue eyes kindled into a flashing look
  that gave a radiant lustre to her charming face; she negligently moved the
  screen, revealing the emptiness of the room.</p>

  <p>"Your officers are still alarmed for you, Prince Zadikov; will you tell
  them to find their quarters elsewhere&mdash;there are the farms, the
  outbuildings, other houses between here and Budweis."</p>

  <p>"You command very well," smiled Zadikov, "and you may command my
  leisure&mdash;the day is over." He went to the window and spoke to the
  officers; Miss Pettigrew saw them reluctantly depart; she smiled to think
  that they should be afraid of her who was so utterly in their power&mdash;an
  army surrounding her complete helplessness.</p>

  <p>She asked her guest to be seated; she took from him his hat with the stiff
  black cockade, the light cloak covered with autumn dust. She laughed quietly
  to see how perfectly he controlled what must be a baffled amazement, with
  what audacious readiness he accepted this improbable adventure; some of the
  tales she had heard of him ran through her mind; she studied her monster, her
  Tartar, her dragon, her ruthless devouring tyrant. The appearance of Gregory
  Zadikov gave the lie to these ferocious epithets; he had a charming, slightly
  melancholy countenance, devoid of any definite expression, a person more
  elegant than powerful, a manner of instinctive magnificence well curbed by
  careful good breeding; those who described him as a bearded Muscovite, or a
  yellow flat-faced Eastern, were grotesquely wrong; and they forgot what Miss
  Pettigrew had always remembered, that he had been educated at Versailles. He
  was set off with the most extravagant of military bearing; his hair was as
  exactly rolled and pomaded as if he had just left the barber's hands; Miss
  Pettigrew had seen many a gentleman at St. James's less precisely ordered
  than Zadikov after his march; nor was there any offence in the reserved
  scrutiny he gave her; she had read a coarser appraisal of her charms in the
  eyes of men of a better reputation.</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to know me?" he asked, carelessly on his guard.</p>

  <p>"I hear you play the harpsichord divinely," smiled Miss Pettigrew, "I
  should like to hear you."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" he asked. He had faintly coloured, and amused, she
  wondered who had last brought the blood to his serene face.</p>

  <p>"You grow flowers also, there is one here in the glass-houses I should
  like to show you&mdash;<i>Corona Imperialis</i>, rare, Monseigneur, if not
  unique."</p>

  <p>Zadikov was pulling off his fringed gloves. When Corinne opened the door
  behind him he did not look round; Miss Pettigrew noted that; he had not had
  the château searched; did he trust her, or was he outrageously foolhardy? She
  hoped the latter; she had always wanted to meet a man worthy of her utmost
  art. Corinne lit the candles, soft blooms of mellow light in the tender dusk;
  the twilight beyond the windows was a hyacinth azure, the sky above the trees
  of an infinite depth of voluptuous purple. Corinne had arranged the supper
  exquisitely&mdash;a melon in a silver basket, <i>Bon Chrétien</i> pears on a
  jade green dish, Venetian glasses with ruby stems, such cold meats and
  pasties as she had found in Madame d'Ursins Trainel's larder, fastidiously
  set out, wine in long tawny gleaming bottles...</p>

  <p>"Have you enjoyed your life, Monseigneur?"</p>

  <p>"Immensely; and you, Madame?"</p>

  <p>"I also immensely; an evening like this&mdash;lovely, is it not?"</p>

  <p>Zadikov looked at her earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Lovely, indeed!"</p>

  <p>"You have a fine taste&mdash;a delicate appreciation&mdash;of beauty,
  Prince Zadikov?"</p>

  <p>"No one has denied me that quality."</p>

  <p>"I am not concerned with what others you have&mdash;only with that. You
  are fastidious in your choice, and neither scruples nor fears would prevent
  you taking your choice once you had made it?"</p>

  <p>"You read me exactly," he replied; he had lost his artificial look of
  composure, and she saw that his eager dark face was beautiful.</p>

  <p>"And will read you no further, so much knowledge will serve our brief
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Mary Pettigrew, of Waygood Boys, Somerset&mdash;but it is a long while
  since I was there. Will you take your supper, Prince Zadikov?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he said, "read you as you do me; no, not even that little
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She poured his wine.</p>

  <p>"You are married, Monseigneur?"</p>

  <p>"Inevitably and inconveniently, Madame."</p>

  <p>"My condolences&mdash;for the lady."</p>

  <p>"You would not be in her place?" he smiled. "No, I do not see you
  there&mdash;you have never married for you are not a woman&mdash;you are an
  enchantment," he ended with sudden gravity.</p>

  <p>"Take me as that and we shall do very well."</p>

  <p>"How can I take you as anything else? One must call in magic to
  explain&mdash;an unprecedented situation."</p>

  <p>He was close to her now, the other side of the small table, and her level
  look considered him more keenly; was there not, after all, something
  dangerous in that face?&mdash;the cheek-bones too high, the lips too full,
  the eyes too dark&mdash;a savage, perhaps, beneath the brilliant veneer.</p>

  <p>"You sack Budweis to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Need we talk of it?"</p>

  <p>"I ask you to spare the town."</p>

  <p>She saw disappointment darken in his glance, as if he had found the
  solution of her mystery, and found it commonplace.</p>

  <p>"That, then!" he answered, not without an inflection of contempt, "the
  mouthpiece of those whining burghers&mdash;what you ask is impossible. I have
  heard of Deliliah and Judith&mdash;I am not to be wrought on, even by an
  enchantress."</p>

  <p>"I do not try to seduce you," smiled Miss Pettigrew. "Never have I taken
  less trouble with any man&mdash;I did not even change my gown. I have put
  greater pains into pleasing&mdash;those less powerful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her eyes became thoughtful; she was recalling a night in Venice, a
  rendezvous beneath the <i>Colleoni</i> statue, when she had worn a cavalier's
  attire&mdash;severe, trim, gaitered, buttoned from toe to chin&mdash;but,
  afterwards, in the locked chamber of the <i>Capo del Moro</i> she had worn
  nothing save a cloud of gauze and diamond garters...Zadikov saw that
  reflective look, as if she had forgotten him, and he was piqued.</p>

  <p>"And yet you make a monstrous request. What is Budweis to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I am a stranger here. I have scarcely seen the place. I ask you
  not to sack Budweis."</p>

  <p>"I have promised my soldiers the plunder. That is sufficient."</p>

  <p>"Your word is so inviolable? What is one town more or less to you,
  Monseigneur?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly the same as one lover more or less to you, Madame."</p>

  <p>"A trifle, then. And you can let Budweis go?"</p>

  <p>"No," smiled Zadikov.</p>

  <p>"No?" Miss Pettigrew raised her fine eyebrows. She leant back in her
  chair, her hands folded languidly in her lap; twilight and candlelight
  fluttered over her in mellow shade and glow, on all her hues of pearl and
  amber and rose; she looked past Zadikov at the warmth of the night beyond the
  open window where troops, trees and heavens were all hidden in one trembling
  depth of blue, the deep blue of hyacinth, of dying summer, of her own
  eyes&mdash;a little weary, a little veiled by the memory of tears.</p>

  <p>Zadikov got to his feet; Miss Pettigrew did not stir; gentle and tranquil
  she gazed into the night.</p>

  <p>"What would you give me if I spared Budweis?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Why did I ask? You could give me nothing I could not take&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She detected arrogance and impatience in his tone; he had revealed
  exasperation and given her an advantage she serenely used.</p>

  <p>"I never thought to hear a man of quality speak so crudely! I believed you
  were more subtle. Do you think I stayed here to save Budweis? I wanted to
  meet you. Do not disappoint me."</p>

  <p>"I regret I spoke so&mdash;falsely. I know you could give me what no cost
  or menace could buy&mdash;I am not so barbarous&mdash;forgive me."</p>

  <p>"I see you will not disappoint me. And when I said 'nothing' I was wrong.
  If you will spare Budweis I will give you the new lily, <i>Corona
  Triumphalis, Corona Imperialis</i>, which grows very well in the glasshouses
  here."</p>

  <p>"A town for a flower!" smiled Zadikov. "It is true that I am an ardent
  collector&mdash;but, no."</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew pressed him no more; she went to the harpsichord and set
  out a sheet of music, and lit the candles either side; the quivering
  reflections gleamed on the wreaths of <i>amorini</i>, of laurels. "Will you
  play for me?" smiled Miss Pettigrew&mdash;"it is a lovely night; do you not
  sometimes consider how soon they pass&mdash;nights such as this, so warm, so
  still, the sweeter the dream the briefer&mdash;and, who knows if, in the last
  sleep, we dream at all?"</p>

  <p>"I've thought of that," replied Zadikov unsteadily, "is it that which
  torments us?"</p>

  <p>"We miss so much," said Miss Pettigrew. "A hundred years hence we shall be
  ghosts in an old story&mdash;no one will care if Budweis was sacked or
  no&mdash;this music will be out of tune and my face fading on a
  canvas&mdash;'<i>Ah, giovenezza, come sei Bella</i>!'&mdash;Do you know that
  melody? How many women have you loved, Prince Zadikov? And if the sum of them
  all were here to-night would you not find these few hours worth one cruelty
  foregone?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was full of caresses, of tenderness, of invitation, but when he
  approached her she looked at him with irony.</p>

  <p>"Corinne has prepared the apartments of M. d'Ursins Trainel for you,
  Monseigneur&mdash;do you wish for your friends, your secretaries, your
  valets&mdash;you have work to do to-night?"</p>

  <p>Zadikov repeated:</p>

  <p>"The day is over, and with it those affairs of the day."</p>

  <p>"You are well-guarded, eh?" smiled Miss Pettigrew. "How many sentries
  about the chateau? How many soldiers encamped in the park?"</p>

  <p>"You, too, have your defences," he answered. "I think I have never met a
  woman so well protected."</p>

  <p>"You can hardly have met a woman more alone, Monseigneur. I move solitary
  in all my designs."</p>

  <p>"Yet you are unapproachable," he sat down by the harpsichord; he was
  weary, clouded by melancholy. She had roused (he knew not how) old torments
  that he usually lulled by swift action; the nostalgia for the unattainable,
  the secret, surprised regret (never confessed) that success, power, glory,
  were not in achievement what they had seemed in anticipation; the gloom and
  sadness latent in his blood stirred an intolerable pain; he grinned as if
  tortured physically, and asked her what she thought of while she pondered by
  the mute music?</p>

  <p>"Of our deaths. If you die first I shall hear of it&mdash;the battle,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Please God," Zadikov crossed himself.</p>

  <p>"But, perhaps, an assassin, an illness, possibly the scaffold,
  Monseigneur&mdash;at least pomp, high above the crowd&mdash;clamour and
  amaze, But if I die first you will hear nothing&mdash;it will be obscurely
  one night when the candles are put out for the last time, when the wreaths
  and garlands are withered, to be no more renewed, when the silks are folded
  away and the gems set aside for another woman's pleasure...Play to me, Prince
  Zadikov, and give me another memory."</p>

  <p>"Of what?" asked Zadikov sombrely; he was deeply troubled. Life had never
  been a moral problem to him, nor women anything but a simple matter; but this
  woman had roused in him that lust for the impossible, the intangible, the
  unearthly, that had sunk him to embittering excesses and raised him to
  maddening ecstasies...</p>

  <p>"Of an illusion of happiness," breathed Miss Pettigrew, "what more can
  anyone give another?"</p>

  <p>He played and sang; first from the Operas, <i>"Armide," "Alexandre,"</i>
  then the wild melancholy songs of Russia, in his despised native
  tongue&mdash;songs of snow, of black rivers, of dark pines like metal against
  a rigid sky, of great bears and packs of wolves and sledge bells, and
  passionate bridals in gaunt castles with one lit window gleaming on to the
  lonely storm, quenched suddenly by a trembling hand...to Zadikov these things
  were in the music.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew thought of England; an autumn morning, the first falling
  leaves on the trim swept path before the manor door, a bright chestnut horse
  waiting at the gate, a happy child lifted into the saddle&mdash;herself...the
  pang of joy...the sense of all life before her...a golden secret of
  unutterable delight...She sighed her thoughts back to the present and looked
  at the man playing his sombre melodies.</p>

  <p>Zadikov.</p>

  <p>His face had changed; it was flushed, heavier, darker, had lost that
  careful look of formality, of authority. She could now believe that those
  wide lips could snarl...the full nostrils were slightly distended, his too
  heavy brows met in a frown; it was the front of an animal, noble but savage;
  but Miss Pettigrew reflected that the countenance of an animal&mdash;a bull,
  a lion&mdash;had as much of the godlike as the countenance of humanity.</p>

  <p>Zadikov appeared to sense that she spied on his soul and recovered himself
  with admirable composure. He looked at her with eyes slightly bloodshot and
  only a negative expression; Miss Pettigrew applauded the performance of
  something difficult, the recovery from the music, not the music itself. Her
  light delicacy of touch saved him from the regret of having revealed too
  much; she made no comment on his music; she told him the story of the
  Burgomaster of Budweis and the Virgin Martyr, and they laughed together
  without self-consciousness. Zadikov appeared quite amiable when he laughed.
  From the park came the appeal of drum and trumpet; the companions of Zadikov
  were becoming as exasperated as the companions of Ulysses when he visited
  Circe.</p>

  <p>Corinne came and removed the supper appointments; as she passed beside
  Miss Pettigrew, her gleaming darkness, her scarlet tissue, her hard outlines
  made the Englishwoman appear faint, vague, frail as the ashes of a roseleaf.
  Corinne left them, moving the candles so that they were drowned in
  shadows.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew waited; she believed that he would know exactly what to do;
  he came towards her with no more of parade than was allowable, and asked if
  he should go?</p>

  <p>"When you have promised to spare Budweis," said Miss Pettigrew. "Promise?
  Nay, I believe you think little of that&mdash;you shall sign orders that the
  town be left&mdash;the château, too, the park, I'll not have it
  touched&mdash;then you may go, Prince Zadikov."</p>

  <p>"All this because you have a lovely face?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him out of the shadows, impalpable, tantalizing as those
  most daring, most unrealizable desires that tormented him even in the moment
  of his keenest triumph.</p>

  <p>"Those whom I love, those who hold me, do not know if my face be lovely or
  not&mdash;do not care if I am ugly or beautiful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He could have caught hold of her with a movement that seemed to be of
  destruction, but Miss Pettigrew stayed him by adding:</p>

  <p>"Those whom I love&mdash;he who takes me against my will enbraces disgust
  and death."</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said Zadikov hotly, "I will spare every town I
  take&mdash;you shall have a court in Munich&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have always avoided such obvious triumphs&mdash;you cannot prolong
  dreams into the light of day&mdash;nor do I bargain, Prince Zadikov," she
  laughed, amused. "Are you used to buy your mistresses at so cheap a rate?
  Budweis for Mary Pettigrew&mdash;nay, every town you take! Match me against
  Rome, Vienna, Paris&mdash;and still bid too low!"</p>

  <p>"You have a high pride," he said, but not in mockery, rather in admiration
  of an emotion that matched his own emotions, that so often seemed too vast to
  know any possible satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"But my worth outstrips it&mdash;now, give me Budweis, nor keep me,
  Monseigneur, quibbling for a bagatelle."</p>

  <p>As indifferently as if she had asked what he could at once concede Zadikov
  sat down at the desk she had prepared and wrote his orders to leave
  Budweis&mdash;to leave Brockenstein and all the gardens and houses, farms and
  fields; Miss Pettigrew held the candle while he wrote. When he had scrawled
  the last "Zadikov" she suggested that he sent these orders at once to his
  adjutant.</p>

  <p>"How slightly you trust me."</p>

  <p>"How slightly you are to be trusted&mdash;in the morning you may think:
  'Why did I concede so much for nothing?'"</p>

  <p>"In which case I could countermand these orders."</p>

  <p>"You would never do that, for you do not wish to give an impression of
  weakness, of indecision."</p>

  <p>"And what impression of weakness do I give as it is? Every one will know I
  have given up the town because you asked me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;as the price of the flower; I have heard of a regiment given for
  a drinking cup&mdash;a town for a bulb is a prettier exchange&mdash;will you
  leave it at that?"</p>

  <p>Zadikov replied in formal tones: "I will leave it at that," and Miss
  Pettigrew sighed at the achievement of one of her most difficult victories;
  she allowed him to stare at her, the fine English gentlewoman so well-bred,
  so fastidious, so composed, a mere breath, a mere sparkle of loveliness in
  the warm dusk of the beautiful night; he glowered and stiffened.</p>

  <p>"I will take these orders myself, I will not remain in the château&mdash;"
  Then, on the threshold of the window, "What an irony that you could not have
  liked me!"</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew did not reply to that; she said: "Corinne will take you to
  the flower," and left him leaning against the window-frame, inwardly raging.
  He had always flattered himself that he could seize the utmost from any
  opportunity and this had escaped him; he had long since found that he
  required more for the least satisfaction that brutality could give him; he
  was glutted by violent victories, satiated by the trophies and spoils he
  could rudely wrest from the reluctant hands of fortune; strong, brave,
  shrewd, but wilful, reckless and extravagant, he lived on the edge of
  disillusion; 'an illusion of happiness' this woman had said&mdash;what, if
  there was not only no happiness, but even no illusion possible?</p>

  <p>Moving always amid large events it was natural for him to think grandly;
  he had been answerable to few for his actions, to none for his desires, yet
  he had always realized his own sharp limitations. And never so keenly as
  to-night; he gloomed into the tranquil beauty of the skies; the moon was
  rising behind the avenue of trees.</p>

  <p>"We are here to enjoy what is&mdash;not to yearn after what might
  be"&mdash;Zadikov's philosophy could get no further than that; he thought he
  would give orders to strike camp, forget his discomfiture in seeing the
  discomfiture of the others in his power, in sending his armies staggering
  sullenly on the march in the hot night, with Budweis untouched behind
  them&mdash;they also mortified and cheated. But he decided that it would be
  more noble to keep his word, and so sent his orders by one of the sentries
  thickly posted round the château; though no one dared intrude on him, all
  were disturbed as to his safety; he saw a group of Heyducks on the steps
  watching the lighted window; impressive and aloof, he was admired by the
  soldiers because he gave them confidence in his brilliant and steadfast star
  and never allowed them to guess that he often saw it overclouded in its
  progress and dimmed in its flashing.</p>

  <p>As Zadikov paused on the terrace he could hear the agitated bells of
  Budweis; the people were, of course, crowding to their churches, endeavouring
  to mitigate the wrath of God...praying perhaps, to their Virgin Martyr,
  immobile in her niche. Odd that their clamours should be answered in such
  indirect and cynic fashion; Zadikov, who despised all the superstitions of
  men, stared at the moon rising into a sky emptied of the warm, rich and
  tender hues of early evening, and cast over in his mind the word
  "enchantment."</p>

  <p>With her easy movement, both stealthy and candid, Corinne crossed the
  terrace and reminded him that he had not waited for the bulb, the flower that
  her mistress had promised him; this fantasy pleased Zadikov and he re-entered
  the house behind the negress; she led him seriously across the salon, past
  the open harpsichord and the screen, and up the stairs lit only by one
  bracket of candles placed high, so that he mounted through falling shadows;
  somewhere a window was open and the church bells, with their tedious appeal,
  broke the serene repose of the lovely night. Corinne opened a door on to a
  room lit only by moonlight and turned away down the corridor; Zadikov,
  pausing, saw her extinguish the candles on the stairs, as in his music the
  light in the window of the gaunt Russian castle had been extinguished. As he
  closed the door the flower welcomed him&mdash;a crown of crowded buds, half
  curling open, depending from a stem wreathed with thin leaves like a victor's
  baton with laurels, sprays shaping, in the unfluctuating light, an Imperial
  diadem raised on a conqueror's staff.</p>

  <p>Miss Pettigrew was seated beside the flower; she regarded Zadikov gravely,
  without coquetry; she was no longer the English gentlewoman, but
  Antiope&mdash;</p>

  <p>Danae&mdash;Ariadne&mdash;serious, absorbed in a dedication to the
  transient delights and beauties lent by the immortal gods; her hair was in a
  knot of classic severity and she wore a mull robe embroidered with millions
  of white roses.</p>

  <p>Zadikov crossed the room, knelt beside her and put his face in his hands
  on her knee; she looked down at him with compassion for the brevity of mortal
  joy, with irony for the length of the longing, the depth of the yearning, the
  incompleteness of any human satisfaction; she tenderly told him to rise; as
  he did so his foot struck the pistol which she had not troubled to
  conceal.</p>

  <p>"What is that for?" asked Zadikov, drowsily indifferent to all harsh
  matters.</p>

  <p>"In case I had not liked you," said Miss Pettigrew, sighing into his arms.
  She appeared diaphanous in the light from the remote moon&mdash;a creature
  ravished from ineffable depths of unimagined heavens; but the vague perfume
  of her locks was the perfume from the coronal on Eve's tresses, blooming in
  the shade of gilded trees, as she slept through an imperishable afternoon in
  an earthly Eden.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The citizens of Budweis, in solemn thanksgivings, laid offerings on the
  altar before <i>Santa Rosa</i>, virgin martyr, who had once saved the city
  from a dragon, and now, it seemed, from Zadikov. The rearguard of the great
  army had disappeared over the plains of Bavaria, leaving Budweis
  unscathed&mdash;a miracle! When the Burgomaster remembered the lady at the
  château he hastened up from the city through the park&mdash;possibly it had
  been her good offices?</p>

  <p>She had gone; the château was deserted; the harpsichord stood open in the
  salon which was full of a sunshine definitely tinged with the sensuous
  melancholy of autumn.</p>

  <p>A lingering forester had seen her departure; neat, composed, in her trim
  habit, with a negress and a dog, in a small travelling coach going in the
  opposite direction to that taken by the armies of the Russians and
  Imperialists.</p>

  <p>The utmost care of Prince Zadikov could not preserve the lily; disdainful
  of life outside a glasshouse it vanished into a scroll of dusty brown;
  Zadikov sullenly wrapped this ghost of beauty and delight in a robe of Indian
  mull embroidered with a million white roses and kept it, secretly, in his
  private baggage, where the bulb perished completely and became ashes to the
  heart. One day, after a bitter and indecisive battle, Zadikov furious and
  exhausted, found this pinch of dust in the wisp of lawn, cast one away and
  rent the other with unsteady hands, while he cursed all dreams.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03-2"
     id="ch-03-2"></a>CAPRICCIO</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Variations on a Spanish theme composed for Diego Lopez
  de Figuerra, Duque de Sommaja, Viceroy of Aragon, by Carlo Barlucchi.</i>
  [SPAIN, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"<i>Nota</i>. To endure with grace this world, since I do not know of
  another. <i>Nota</i>. How to accomplish this? <i>Nota</i>. Since Beatrix de
  Bellefonds torments me..."</p>

  <p>Idly Carlo Barlucchi wrote these words across the unfinished music score,
  idly he looked out of the window which revealed nothing but an ornate roof
  line and a space of bright blue sky; the room was in shadow, for the hard
  sunlight fell on the other side of the street; in shadow, dark and hung with
  many musical instruments.</p>

  <p>Carlo Barlucchi tore up the score; the fragments of paper fluttered on to
  other fragments marked with notes and the name "Beatrix de Bellefonds." The
  young man lounged on a low leathern seat; everything in the chamber was
  sombre, fantastic, deep-hued; a tapestry of hideous and gigantic fruits in
  indigo and blackish green, a cabinet of yellow amber and black amber; heavy,
  dark chairs with coats of arms stamped in tarnished gold, a picture of a
  blond woman stifling in a bodice rigid with square-cut gems, kneeling before
  a warrior in scarlet armour who loomed from incomprehensible shadows where
  grinned an Ethiopian carrying a helmet crowned with blood-spangled
  plumes...on the walls musical instruments&mdash;lutes, smooth as swan-skin
  jelly-bags, hurdy-gurdies with silver-handles and backs gleaming like
  rain-washed melons, viol <i>d'amore</i>, striped white, black, hard,
  glittering even in the shadow, a flute ringed with cornelian, agate, colours
  of sea-drowned moss, embers suddenly quenched; in the corner a spinet painted
  laboriously with hard flat roses, yellowish white, purplish blue that seemed
  like eyes to stare across the room.</p>

  <p>Carlo Barlucchi was attired in rich dishevelment&mdash;black velvet,
  <i>point d'Alençon</i> lace, narrow carnation ribbons, a topaz buckle for his
  thick black hair; he was the favourite and the sport of fortune, a prisoner
  of a good chance, that was his livelihood, held in Madrid by the patronage of
  the idle slothful grandees.</p>

  <p>In this slumbrous life of a great city sinking in stately decay, every one
  sought to be drugged by music; the only passion that a corrupt, gloomy,
  decadent nobility discovered was the passion for an oblivion given by music.
  Amid the slow disintegration of Spain music alone had power to dispel the
  universal melancholy; the King, brooding in the Alcazar into hopeless
  insanity, sought solace in Farinelli&mdash;as did the filthy beggar in his
  ebony pipe, playing dolefully and nursing his sores in the violet shadow of a
  porch heavy with adoring saints.</p>

  <p>The country was governed by foreign adventurers, while Spaniards,
  afflicted by a profound disillusion, a sombre lethargy, paid musicians and
  singers the last of the Mexican gold to give them the smallest draught from
  Lethe.</p>

  <p>Carlo Barlucchi heard through the open door, the frail sound of glass
  chinking on glass, smelt a faint distasteful odour; he knew by this that even
  in the drowsy hot afternoon Felipe Hermosa, the diligent physician, was
  working. Barlucchi believed that he must be the only industrious person in
  Madrid; they shared between them this floor of an ancient palace; they were
  of an age and friendly; Hermoza, alert, eager, pursued knowledge with steady
  step and clear gaze; Barlucchi was enervated by his adoration of beauty,
  sighed with the lassitude left by sumptuous dreams; Hermoza knew of his
  useless passion for the Bellefonds, the most costly courtesan in Madrid, and
  thought the obsession commonplace; Barlucchi knew some of the problems the
  physician dared to essay to solve in his retorts and furnaces, and considered
  such ambitions ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Yet they tolerated each other and even took a pleasure in each other's
  company.</p>

  <p>When, in his idle despair, Barlucchi heard the tinkle of Hermoza's
  glasses, he rose languidly, yawned, and crossed the spacious landing that
  divided his apartments from those of the doctor; up those wide, shallow
  stairs, supporting themselves by the baluster of gilded iron which curled
  into the involved shape of fern fronds, had come many clients for both young
  men; creatures who seemed wraiths of beautiful women, creatures who seemed
  spectres of haughty gentlemen, imploring drugs, soporifics, music,
  medicine...to make life endurable.</p>

  <p>Hermoza greeted the Italian indifferently and continued his experiments;
  he was lean, red-haired, and freckled; he wore trodden-over slippers, a spare
  black gown, spectacles, and a turban of white linen; he was yet young and
  resolute.</p>

  <p>In his outer room he stood at a table and poured drops from a violet phial
  that curdled the liquid in a pale glass bowl into the likeness of seething
  milk; an inner door was open and Barlucchi could see the elongated necks of
  retorts, the opaque shapes of bowls and bottles, the orange square of the
  furnace door; thin vapours hesitated in the hot atmosphere; the room was
  furnished indifferently with worn chairs and a discreet screen.</p>

  <p>"How idle you are!" remarked Hermoza.</p>

  <p>"I am tired of writing music, I soothe every one but myself. I detest
  Spain. The very air is heavy with slumber. Madrid is like a rotten
  pomegranate decaying in the desert."</p>

  <p>"Yet you remain here because you earn a great deal of <i>scudi</i>, and
  loll and grow fat; whereas in Naples you would have to quarrel with others
  for a bone."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. In Naples the life is free, active, joyous, every one is
  alive, even the beggars dance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bah! you are an idler; even your music is not very good. You turn over
  the same tunes again and again."</p>

  <p>"Is that not what they want? Farinelli has sung the same four songs to His
  Majesty every night for ten years&mdash;and has he not the Cross of St. Iago,
  three thousand gold ducats every year and more influence than anyone in
  Spain?"</p>

  <p>"The King is a lunatic."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it is very agreeable for Farinelli who, after all, has a
  voice like a nightingale."</p>

  <p>"And it is very agreeable for you who, in return for a sonata for the
  clavier, an <i>ode</i>, a <i>motet</i>, or a <i>symphony</i>, can obtain
  money, caresses, velvet clothes, Tokai, and down pillows."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me," protested the Italian, mildly. "I am oppressed by
  all this luxury, I am profoundly dissatisfied&mdash;I wish to write a mighty
  opera on the theme of Armida or Circe, but I never even finish a
  symphony&mdash;every day I dream more..."</p>

  <p>"Of Beatrix de Bellefonds?" sneered the physician, peering into the glass
  globe that was now dense as white coral.</p>

  <p>"She is my chief illusion."</p>

  <p>"You are enamoured of her because a hopeless love requires no exertion. It
  is easy for you, knowing all endeavour useless, to sigh and slumber."</p>

  <p>"You think I have chosen her out of laziness?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Does she not belong to the Duque de Sommaja, Viceroy of
  Aragon? You might as reasonably hope for a smile from the Madonna of the
  Seven Swords on the High Altar of the Cathedral."</p>

  <p>"I know that all my desires are impossible, that is why I am tormented,
  the world I wish to inhabit does not exist&mdash;I describe it in my music,
  and Giambattista Tiepolo has been there&mdash;you can see it on his
  canvasses."</p>

  <p>"A crazy, motley universe," mocked the physician. "Lilac parasols, diamond
  cuirasses, palaces upside down, leopards entangled in mantles of rose
  brocade, peacocks plucking at grapes made of emeralds...hurry, folly,
  tritons, satyrs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And everywhere love," interrupted Barlucchi. "Love in pearls, in radiant
  clouds, in translucent seas, in fields of roses and lilies, riding a white
  hippocampus or a unicorn with a coral horn, blowing a gold trumpet, playing
  on steps of alabaster&mdash;air, light, beauty, love&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" cried the physician, "this is all very trivial&mdash;Tiepolo,
  like you, gets excellent pay for his dreams; you drive people crazy between
  you&mdash;every one is tantalized with glimpses of the impossible; many
  become imbecile with melancholy, because painters and musicians create this
  world no one can enter."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi approached the table.</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> create, Hermoza? With your ugly smells, powders, fumes
  and potions?"</p>

  <p>"Knowledge," smiled the Spaniard with a fierce red glance.</p>

  <p>"And what is the use of this knowledge save to preserve illusion? These
  women in black lace veils, these men in dominos, who come here&mdash;what is
  their errand? To buy some mess to prolong the Spring&mdash;a wash for the
  face, drops to keep the eyes ardent, a drug to renew strength and
  spirits&mdash;above all, to beg for the elixir of love, of youth!" Barlucchi
  spoke excitedly; his smooth, plump face flushed, his large black eyes
  gleamed. "Yes, you old charlatan," he added hurriedly, "you deceive as deeply
  as I, and not so pleasantly&mdash;yes, that is true, you rob all your
  clients, for you can do nothing for them&mdash;nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't I?" sneered Hermoza, "I assure you that they are very well
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>"That is only because you are clever enough to hoodwink them&mdash;despite
  all your concoctions, they have gout, dropsy, and pimples; they become
  wrinkled, bent, blear-eyed, soft, fat and swollen as a bursting fig, or thin,
  hollow and dry as an ear of corn when the grain is shaken out&mdash;they lose
  their teeth, their noses become red and glistening, they can no longer slip
  their rings over their twisted knuckles&mdash;they turn from each other with
  disgust and to God with despair, and then they come to me, to Carlo
  Barlucchi, for music, for memory, for hope, for oblivion!"</p>

  <p>"How noisy you are," remarked Hermoza. "Even if it is as you say, some
  people manage to slip out of the world quite content. It is all this hectic
  nonsense of Love, Beauty, Youth, that complicates life so."</p>

  <p>"Bah! you understand nothing!" cried the musician. "Why do I talk to such
  a dried hide of a man?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go and write a <i>Cantata</i> for the Bellefonds?"</p>

  <p>"Because my heart is so dismal. I have youth, money, good looks, and I am
  merely wasting my time. I allow every opportunity of pleasure to escape me
  because I cannot possess the Bellefonds. I must be a fool."</p>

  <p>"You are."</p>

  <p>"What is that you are making?" asked Barlucchi gloomily.</p>

  <p>Hermoza was pouring the thick white liquid into bottles the colour of a
  Persian violet.</p>

  <p>"A lotion for the Bellefonds to wash her arms with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is already as pure, as pale-skinned as a magnolia leaf."</p>

  <p>"But she is afraid, you see," grinned the Spaniard, "of a little mark, a
  little stain, a tiny wrinkle."</p>

  <p>Two eunuchs in the Sommaja livery pushed open the door and Beatrix de
  Bellefonds entered, attended by two duennas with greenish bilious faces, long
  scraggy necks, and farthingales a hundred years out of fashion and two pages
  from Andalusia, short, swarthy, wearing the Sommaja colours of flame and
  citron; one carried a white spaniel with bells of scarlet glass on its
  collar, the other supported a stand on which a macaw, green as verjuice, tore
  to pieces a luscious over-ripe peach.</p>

  <p>The Bellefonds was delighted to see the handsome young musician; it gave
  her great pleasure to torment him; she was insolent with success. For six
  months she had belonged to the Viceroy of Aragon, and as he applied all the
  revenues of that kingdom to his own pleasures he had been able to give even
  this rapacious courtesan all she wished.</p>

  <p>She was fond of saying:</p>

  <p>"Sommaja gives me everything I want."</p>

  <p>It was true that she lived under lock and key, behind lattices, that she
  went abroad in closed litters or coaches with the curtains drawn, and never
  without two eunuchs, the two duennas and the two pages, but if she missed the
  liberty she had enjoyed in France she did not complain.</p>

  <p>She spread her splendours on the sunken leathern seat, she unlaced her red
  silk corsets on a chemise of silver-threaded lawn, lamenting the oppressive
  heat; her pale hair, lengthened with braids of pearl and ribbons sewn with
  diamonds, fell to her waist; a dozen veils and laces of precious tissues
  drooped from her shoulders.</p>

  <p>She also accused Barlucchi of idleness.</p>

  <p>"How you waste your time! As I came up the stairs I listened in vain for
  your music&mdash;I thought, 'He is asleep or with his mistress'."</p>

  <p>"Would not that be wasted time?" asked Hermoza, considering her without
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"There is pleasure in slumber, in love&mdash;but Signor Barlucchi, he does
  nothing!"</p>

  <p>She snapped her fan on to her bosom wickedly, inviting the young man to
  look at her warm, voluptuous, transient loveliness from which she had loosed
  off her black satin mantle; she wore a black tricorne with an emerald
  agraffe; she had several flowers at her corsage so that she might continually
  drop and readjust them; with a hand that held a scrap of batiste she jerked
  up her garlanded flounces to the knee, showing gauze stockings, silk shoes
  with mother o' pearl heels; the duennas brought out their rosaries and the
  harsh mutter of their prayers accompanied the whispering chatter of the
  macaw.</p>

  <p>"You know that I have no mistress," said Barlucchi coldly.</p>

  <p>"How foolish you are!"</p>

  <p>"I know that, Madame de Bellefonds."</p>

  <p>"And how handsome," smiled the lady, "but you must be careful you do not
  become too plump. I dislike a man who looks as if he fed on snails. Why do
  you not write me a song?" she added.</p>

  <p>"Because you have no means of paying him," sneered the doctor, handing the
  pages the lilac-coloured bottles and winking at the ugliest duenna.</p>

  <p>"Sommaja will pay," smiled the Bellefonds, adding her familiar
  boast&mdash;"he buys me everything I want."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi had frequently wondered what kind of man was the Spanish grandee
  who could afford this beautiful woman, who paid for her jewels, her palace,
  her horses, her attendant, her whims; he had seen him occasionally in the
  distant gloom of a corridor in the Alcazar, or in profile outlined against
  green leather curtains, riding in a gilded coach drawn by six Polish
  steeds...he did not seem real to the musician, but yet he appeared to hover
  disdainfully, an invisible power, about his mistress and servants.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi's tormented heart ached with envy...to have so much power and
  wealth, to be able to own such an insolent, greedy, gorgeous creature and,
  even better, to cast her aside, if one tired...</p>

  <p>"Eh, but you look melancholy," mocked the lady, pleased with his
  flattering distress. "I will certainly tell Sommaja to order you to write
  something gay for me."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," said Barlucchi sombrely, "if you ever consider the day
  when you will be a heap of yellow bones."</p>

  <p>"Such a commonplace," she retorted, rising, "is in the worst possible
  taste. Besides, the soul is immortal."</p>

  <p>"But I spoke of the body, and that is really all you are concerned
  with."</p>

  <p>The courtesan faced him with disdain; when she was startled out of her
  affectations her eyes were hard with sternly-acquired wisdom.</p>

  <p>"Do you not think one must be very valiant to dare to be beautiful?" she
  asked. "I spare nothing, I miss nothing, I take every hazard, and know that
  in the end I lose them all&mdash;put that in your music for me. Only virtue
  is cowardly enough to tremble for the future."</p>

  <p>"Yet the day will come when you, too, will buy oblivion at a high price,"
  Barlucchi warned her, "but my music will not give it to you, for I shall be
  dead of pining sloth."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were dead now," complained the physician peevishly, "for I
  want to get on with my work."</p>

  <p>Every one laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"You must be the only industrious man in Madrid," mocked the
  Bellefonds.</p>

  <p>She left them, with her studied walk, her swaying grace, her fingers in
  her loosened corsage, the wilting blossoms of her bouquet crushed in the
  pleated lawn, her eyes slightly reddened and swollen as if she had not slept
  last night, keenly turned to Barlucchi; the duennas tripped, the eunuchs
  waddled, the pages dawdled after her; their high heels went tap, tap, on the
  wide, worn, spacious stairs.</p>

  <p>"Can't you see how trivial and ridiculous she is?" asked Hermoza
  impatiently. "If you saw her without all those fantastic ornaments I doubt if
  you would even find her beautiful. Come, Barlucchi, come, you are living in a
  fry tale, nothing of what you prize is real, why don't you go out and observe
  how other people live?"</p>

  <p>"Why should their lives be more real than mine?" protested the musician.
  "However, I will do as you say, I will nose round Madrid and search for
  reality&mdash;perhaps thus I may forget the Bellefonds."</p>

  <p>"As long as you leave me in peace&mdash;" grumbled the physician,
  shuffling towards his laboratory.</p>

  <p>Carlo Barlucchi passed into the airless streets of Madrid; the heat was
  dry, heavy; the shadows seemed as solid as substance in the doorways and
  across the alleys under the massive gables of the houses.</p>

  <p>The first person Barlucchi met was a ragged melon-seller; the musician
  would have liked to question him on matters of philosophy, but was absorbed
  by the beauty of the melons, the broad gleaming swell of the rind, like a
  lute, the rosy gash moist with juice; details always distracted
  him&mdash;that was what the doctor meant, he lived in a fry tale...</p>

  <p>On the shadowed steps of a monstrous church two little water-carriers ate
  figs; they were so dirty Barlucchi would not stop to question them; he turned
  into a wine-shop, the smell of the <i>olla podrida</i>, of the garlic and
  onions hanging on the filthy walls, of the customers themselves, was
  nauseating.</p>

  <p>"Would Hermoza call that real life?" murmured Barlucchi, as he
  retreated&mdash;"is nothing genuine save it is verminous?"</p>

  <p>As he continued his way through the hot streets he reflected: "Besides
  these people also seek illusion, oblivion, though they can afford only bad
  wine."</p>

  <p>He entered a huge church; hundreds of gigantic saints frowned on the
  facade; before the wadded curtains at the door vile beggars pointed out
  neglected sores and deformed limbs; inside the church was dark with brown
  shadows, vast, lofty, filled with the vapours of stale incense, sparkling
  with many altars that glittered through the gloom; a monk was praying before
  a cavernous chapel where the trembling stars of candles lit pictures of
  writhing tortured martyrs.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his devotions Barlucchi addressed him, and begged him
  for a copy of his prayer.</p>

  <p>"What, father, pleases God best? How does one get out of a faery tale to
  real life?"</p>

  <p>"My son," replied the monk, "I have long since ceased to compose prayers.
  They have all been said so often. Every day I recite the letters of the
  alphabet, and beg God, Who, with those signs has composed holy writ, to make
  Himself a prayer as best suits Him out of my offering."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi sighed.</p>

  <p>"As for your second question, you had better go to Suliman Ali, the wise
  Eastern; he really knows everything&mdash;a wicked man, but useful; he lives
  by the Perseus fountain, the house with the yellow-tiled balcony and the
  knocker shaped like an Amphitryon."</p>

  <p>The musician hastened to this address, near hopeless of any assistance in
  rearranging his confused life, even of ridding himself of the passion that
  was wasting his youth.</p>

  <p>A dwarf answered his knock and seemed vexed at being disturbed.</p>

  <p>"You cannot see Suliman Ali," he snarled, "because he hanged himself this
  morning. When it is cooler I shall cut him down."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi thought this a sour jest, but the deformity offered to show him
  the dangling philosopher; Barlucchi hastily refused and asked if the wise man
  had left a message?</p>

  <p>"Only this: I have tried every vice under the sun and there is nothing in
  any of them."</p>

  <p>"He might, perhaps, have sampled virtue."</p>

  <p>"How could he? He always maintained there was no such thing."</p>

  <p>The dwarf slammed the door and Barlucchi went to the Alcazar and found his
  friend and patron, Carlo Brioschi, called Farinelli&mdash;either, as his
  friends declared, from some property in his family or, as his enemies
  averred, because his father had been a baker and he had grown up daubed with
  flour.</p>

  <p>Farinelli ruled Spain, but with such lazy good nature that he offended
  none; all day he rested, fed, made his toilet; every evening he sang his four
  songs to Philip de Bourbon King of Spain, and thus kept His Majesty the safe
  side of lunacy.</p>

  <p>Farinelli was becoming plump, he had many chins below his pink, soft,
  hairless face; his diamond rings cut into his fat fingers, his pale satin
  coats were tight under the arms, and under the stiff azure velvet bow that
  held in place his long powdered curls, his neck showed in little rolls of
  flesh; still he was yet very agreeable and comely, as his portrait by his
  friend Amicone shows.</p>

  <p>Always he had been treated as a deity; in London, where he was almost
  received with frenzy, they had cried&mdash;"One God, one Farinelli!" His
  powers were certainly transcendant; he would really warble like a celestial
  nightingale; to hear his sustained notes rise and fall in the "Folia," or
  twenty-four variations by Corelli, or swell and diminish in some of the
  compositions written especially to display his execution by his teacher
  Nicolo Porpora, was indeed to be admitted to Paradise.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi told him of his quest.</p>

  <p>"If I am in a dream, an illusion, a faery story, I want to get out of it.
  Also, I am obsessed by the Bellefonds."</p>

  <p>Farinelli, used to dealing with imbeciles, smiled indulgently; he had
  himself no fault but vanity, no vice but gluttony, no passion save for fine
  clothes and sleep.</p>

  <p>"<i>Caro amico</i>," he said, that light famous voice as carefully used as
  if he dispensed gold, "have you had any dinner?"</p>

  <p>"No, I forgot about it."</p>

  <p>"I thought so. You will not talk so much nonsense when you have discussed
  my capon, truffles, pineapple, Falerian."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi stamped his foot in impatience.</p>

  <p>"Every one puts me off. I must be right or wrong."</p>

  <p>"Of course," soothed Farinelli, playing with his stars.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, which is it? Either I do move in a dream, as Hermoza says, or
  I do not&mdash;either the Bellefonds is worth pining for or she is not."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," smiled Farinelli.</p>

  <p>His smooth blandness further irritated his <i>protégé</i>.</p>

  <p>"You, of course, <i>caro maestro</i>," he exclaimed, "care nothing but
  preserving your voice for those four songs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," agreed the singer, opening his small eyes wide. "Does not
  the domestic felicity of Their Majesties, the welfare of a vast kingdom,
  depend on my four songs?"</p>

  <p>"But, how foolish!" murmured Barlucchi ungratefully, for his own fortunes
  had been made by the tenor.</p>

  <p>He escaped and entered the apartments of His Eminence the Cardinal
  Archbishop, who was always pleased to see him, and for whom he was composing
  a <i>Mass</i>.</p>

  <p>His Eminence, with silver scissors, was clipping off the withered leaves
  from a jasmine plant that grew in an alabaster vase; he was watched by
  Catalina de Rabais, who had once been a dancer in the courts of the Alhambra,
  capering in tatters for a few pence; now she was nearly as indulged, nearly
  as insolent as the Bellefonds; she rubbed her dark skin with violet-coloured
  powder, and put kohl under her eyes till the whites appeared like
  <i>nacre</i>.</p>

  <p>"Eminence," said Barlucchi, "I have not brought the <i>Mass</i>, but a
  problem."</p>

  <p>The Cardinal Archbishop listened courteously. And had his answer
  immediately ready.</p>

  <p>"The only reality is the persistence of the dream, knowledge is as obvious
  an illusion as beauty; the King listening to Farinelli, the beggar with his
  patch of sun, his white piece&mdash;each in his degree tries to blind himself
  to the misery of his fate&mdash;if Life is a deception, Death is at least a
  certainty, and you are lucky if you can approach so grim a fact by means of a
  faery tale. The pictures of Signor Giambattista Tiepolo, that you mention,
  contain as much truth as you will find in flea-bitten galley-slaves
  quarrelling over their chains, or an old blind hag dying in a
  lazar-house."</p>

  <p>"What jargon!" said Catalina, who resented the last allusion.</p>

  <p>"As for your second question," continued His Eminence, "the woman worth
  waiting for has not yet been created. If you miss a single possible hour of
  pleasure you are a fool. Patience is as alien to love as fidelity. There are
  a number of ladies in Madrid who, if given the opportunity of a closeted
  half-hour would make you forget the Bellefonds."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi found something definite in this; he took his leave gratefully;
  Catalina ran after him, he had left his glove by the pot of jasmine, she
  contrived to whisper to him, to suggest an appointment; she admired him very
  much, she longed for his kisses, she assured him that, viewed under proper
  conditions, she was really prettier than the Bellefonds but despite the
  Cardinal Archbishop's advice, the musician's melancholy black eyes
  declared:</p>

  <p>"You are not the woman."</p>

  <p>He returned to his apartment, lounged over a meal, slept a blank hour,
  awoke to find himself summoned by his servant...A client, a personage, the
  Duque de Sommaja, Viceroy of Aragon.</p>

  <p>Adjusting his person with agitated hands Barlucchi hastened to the outer
  room and stood obsequious in the presence of the grandee, who entirely
  effaced his surroundings by the splendour which enveloped him like an
  <i>aureole</i>.</p>

  <p>Ignoring Barlucchi, and staring straight in front of him, the Viceroy
  commanded:</p>

  <p>"A piece of music for a lady. Play it now."</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency," stammered the musician, "I do not compose as rapidly as
  that."</p>

  <p>"No?" replied the Viceroy coldly, "then I will wait." He waved away the
  lackeys who had crowded after him, and seated himself near the spinet.</p>

  <p>"Excellency," implored Barlucchi, who felt very uneasy. "I cannot&mdash;at
  a moment&mdash;I lack the theme&mdash;the title&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The theme," replied the grandee, "is a woman&mdash;the title,
  <i>Capriccio</i>. Proceed."</p>

  <p>As Barlucchi hesitated, the Viceroy added:</p>

  <p>"You are a musician, are you not?"</p>

  <p>Barlucchi was stung by that; he seated himself at the spinet and began to
  play; there was certainly some inspiration in the theme of the Bellefonds. In
  his music he might express another man's passion for her and his
  own&mdash;<i>Capriccio</i> in his native tongue&mdash;vagary, whim, temper,
  expressive of her and himself, of the canvasses of Giambattista Tiepolo, of
  his own saunterings through Madrid that morning.</p>

  <p>He composed as he played, intervolved melodies rushing up to a suspended
  climax, halting, returning, at once petulant and melancholy, self-confident
  and wistful.</p>

  <p>As he played he looked over the top of the spinet at the grandee, looked
  with awe, curiosity, with a touch of fear at that magnificent figure; to the
  vivacious and volatile musician it seemed impossible to credit the sedate,
  austere Spaniard with any human feelings.</p>

  <p><i>Diego Lopez de Figuerra, Duque de Sommaja, Viceroy of Aragon, Knight of
  the Golden Fleece and of Saint Iago</i>, sat immobile, his long limbs
  disposed with stiff grace, his wide-skirted coat rigid with metallic thread
  and bullion embroidery, a smother of lace and diamonds on his breast, his
  chin held up, the nostrils of his aquiline nose curving down, rows of pomaded
  curls, precise, exact above his powdered ears and flowing to his waist
  behind; a wooden image, thought Barlucchi, endeavouring to feel
  contemptuous.</p>

  <p>But the narrow, dark eyes of the Viceroy, which flickered quickly beneath
  his languorous lids, proved him no image.</p>

  <p>He deigned to approve the music but declared it needed
  improvement&mdash;polish&mdash;an added grace, a final provoking
  impertinence; he condescended to promise a return visit.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi detested and admired him; in the presence of the lover of
  Beatrix de Bellefonds his own passion increased; as he played he felt he was
  the other man's proxy in the affair; a torment, but one he could not
  forego.</p>

  <p>After, as he considered, he had perfected his piece he went across to
  Hermoza's apartments to plague the physician with his melancholy and his
  music, but that personage, screaming with annoyance, drove him away and
  locked the door in his face.</p>

  <p>"I am engaged on a most interesting experiment!" he yelled through the
  keyhole. "Go away, you stupid idiot!"</p>

  <p>Barlucchi, however, did not lack distraction; a negress tapped at his
  chamber; she brought a basket of rice straw full of rose-gold
  nectarines&mdash;a gift from Catalina de Rabais; the choice stolen treasure
  of the Cardinal Archbishop's gardens.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi was pleased that the lady had become enamoured of him, but it
  was useless to think of returning her passion until he could rid himself of
  his obsession about the Bellefonds.</p>

  <p>The days so hot, so lazy, settled to a formal pattern for Carlo Barlucchi;
  every afternoon Sommaja, sumptuously attended came to hear him play over
  <i>Capriccio</i>, every evening the negress brought a basket of nectarines,
  every night he lay awake sighing for the Bellefonds.</p>

  <p>Hermoza frequently came to see him and ate or pocketed Catalina's
  fruit.</p>

  <p>"What a fool you are!" he remarked; "why don't you try to win the silly
  woman? My invention has been very successful. Sommaja is pleased."</p>

  <p>"What," cried Barlucchi, "he comes to see you also?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. He seeks knowledge as well as beauty. A clever man."</p>

  <p>The piece of music had reached perfection; Sommaja admitted as much;
  Hermoza's work had also been completed with delight at least to himself; he
  carried away the neglected pannier of fruit, with ugly grins of pleasure;
  both these tasks had been hurried to a conclusion through the indolent
  sequence of dry summer days when Madrid and her gardens rank with over-ripe
  flowers and fruit, seemed to corrupt in the sun.</p>

  <p>The day the music was finished Sommaja told Barlucchi to send it to his
  palace; the musician ran after him with the sudden recollection of an
  omission on the part of his patron:</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency has not given me the lady's name?"</p>

  <p>He stopped; the grandee was leaving Hermoza's apartments and had a
  nectarine in his hand, one of the Prince Archbishop's nectarines, named
  "Fortune's Kiss." Barlucchi thought this strange, and stared.</p>

  <p>Sommaja stared also as if he perceived an impertinence.</p>

  <p>"The piece of music <i>Capriccio</i> is for a lady named Catalina de
  Rabais," he said with stern coldness, and haughtily descended the stairs,
  leaving Barlucchi confounded.</p>

  <p>Had the grandee, then, left the coveted Bellefonds for a woman whom he,
  the humble musician, could have had so easily&mdash;the cunning, wanton, dark
  gypsy, Catalina?</p>

  <p>Barlucchi could scarcely realize his good luck; he had to find Hermoza and
  tell him about it; the physician was in his laboratory, eyeing the nectarines
  which stood in a row before some sinister, murky, elongated bottles; he
  hastily put a bag of <i>scudi</i> into his pocket as Barlucchi entered, and
  remarked, thoughtfully:</p>

  <p>"Sommaja certainly pays very well."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"One of your nectarines."</p>

  <p>Disgusted by this rubbish the musician hastened away and wrote "For
  Beatrix de Bellefonds" under the piece, <i>Capriccio</i>; he would not sell
  it to Sommaja, but himself present it to the lady for whom it was
  written.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, with the scroll in the pocket of his gala coat, he went to the
  barber's shop and there spent the entire afternoon, a fact he eternally
  repented afterwards; but the day was so hot, the barber's parlour so cool,
  with a lemon-scented fountain spraying on green marble, the barber himself so
  entertaining with his scandalous gossip...In the purple twilight, which
  seemed full of the golden heat vapours of the day, Barlucchi, shaved,
  frizzled, powdered, perfumed, with his guitar slung round his shoulders, full
  of joyful anticipation, waited before the severe palace with the latticed
  windows, where Beatrix de Bellefonds resided.</p>

  <p>As he was about to begin the <i>Capriccio</i> that was to console the
  forsaken beauty by striking his guitar and opening his mouth, he saw a
  side-door open and some shadows, black as Erebus, come forth.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi's hand dropped from the strings, his song was unuttered.</p>

  <p>The dark shapes were four monks carrying a coffin.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi approached this dismal procession.</p>

  <p>"Who is it," he whispered, "you carry away?"</p>

  <p>"Beatrix de Bellefonds," replied one of the monks. "She died
  penitent&mdash;they all do."</p>

  <p>"What did she die of?" stammered the musician.</p>

  <p>"A nectarine she ate this afternoon&mdash;it was overripe, and the heat,
  you know, Señor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They proceeded gravely on their way with the slender coffin; laughter made
  the distracted musician glance upwards; Catalina smiled from a high window;
  her expression scorned him for lost opportunities; her mockery was eclipsed
  by a steady hand that closed the <i>grille</i> before the window; Barlucchi
  knew that those long fingers belonged to the Duque de Sommaja.</p>

  <p>He ran back to his apartments and, exhausted with rage and grief, broke in
  on Hermoza, who was cooking himself a chicken spiced with bay leaves.</p>

  <p>"I know what you sold the Viceroy!" sobbed Barlucchi, "in that
  nectarine..."</p>

  <p>"No, you do not," snapped the doctor; "I have been far too careful.
  Besides, she was a jealous woman and would not let him go quietly, and
  boasted too much&mdash;it got on his nerves to hear her continually
  saying&mdash;'He gives me everything I want.'"</p>

  <p>Barlucchi wept.</p>

  <p>"You have destroyed the creature I would have given all the stars
  for!"</p>

  <p>"No, you would not&mdash;you are in love merely with your own dreams.
  Besides Knowledge must destroy Beauty, that is its mission."</p>

  <p>Barlucchi crept to his own room, unslung the guitar, and sorrowfully drew
  the piece of music from his pocket; he wished that he had given it to the
  monks to put in her grave. He could only tear the score to fragments, and
  that was a poor revenge, for both he and Sommaja had every note by heart.</p>

  <p>Soothed by his tears the musician had glimmering glimpses of how order and
  light might be obtained and the balance held, between the dreams of the poet
  and the account book of the money-changer; but he knew that he was not the
  man to accomplish this, and a soft resignation fell on his spirit.</p>

  <p>Sommaja had, after all, proved a benefactor; he had removed the Bellefonds
  beyond the reach of any man's longing, and he had taken Catalina, who was
  beginning to annoy Barlucchi with her negress and her baskets of fruit; the
  musician became philosophic; perhaps a third woman combining the merits of
  both these beauties might be discovered in Madrid? He was also hungry, and a
  tender aroma from Hermoza's capon penetrated his dusk-filled apartment.</p>

  <p>Barlucchi crossed the landing; the physician was dismissing a late and
  unwelcome patient.</p>

  <p>"Señora, no art can conceal pride or a squint&mdash;all you can do is to
  allow one to neutralize the other; let your arrogance be so high that people
  are shaken in their conviction that you have a defect."</p>

  <p>The capon was deliciously cooked&mdash;the sauces were excellent&mdash;the
  wine superb; the fruits appeared to have been grown in Giambattista Tiepolo's
  far-drawn world; Hermoza generously shared these delicacies with the subdued
  musician, whose appetite was not spoilt by the reflection that the
  <i>scudi</i> the Viceroy had given for the poisoned nectarine had probably
  paid for the feast.</p>

  <p>Lights flickered up in the high-set windows of Madrid, a warm breeze
  fluttered in the close streets, as if a thousand people yawned with relief at
  the setting of the sun; Farinelli strutted to the room of the green mirrors
  to sing his four songs to the King.</p>

  <p>As Carlo Barlucchi raised his glass and drank to the inscrutable faces of
  goat-bodied <i>Chimera</i>, he heard the doleful pipe of a beggar playing
  below one of the melodies he had used in <i>Capriccio</i>.</p>

  <p>Trumpets blared in the courtyard of Castle Karolsfeld. The Castle which
  rose black amid black pines into a black sky, was empty save for three
  people&mdash;a wounded man, a woman, and a pastor.</p>

  <p>Some months before, the Imperialist forces had passed through Karolsfeld
  and one wing of the Castle was now merely a wall, half-consumed by fire, and
  those rooms yet habitable in the other portion had been pillaged and defiled;
  here and there on a wall hung some decorations, some rent tapestries and
  splintered wood smashed by wanton blows from pike or musketoon, and in the
  room where the sick man lay was a scant arrangement of broken furniture, a
  torn tapestry across the unglazed window, and a poor lamp burning rank oil
  standing on a cracked and broken marble table.</p>

  <p>The wounded man lay on an old mattress and some rank straw which had come
  from the stables; his cuirass and gorget, rusted with dried blood and flung
  beside the rude bed, dully reflected the coarse lamplight; his wound was
  festering and his tainted blood ran thickly; he held the woman's hand; the
  pastor supported his head on which the yellow hair hung flat and dank with
  sweat.</p>

  <p>The three listened to the trumpets and to a great clatter and stir which
  came from below, splitting the sombre melancholy of the night into a thousand
  fierce interwoven noises.</p>

  <p>"The Imperialists," whispered the wounded man, and he added, on a bitter
  note, "I had hoped they would have overlooked Karolsfeld on their
  retreat."</p>

  <p>Without saying anything the woman loosened her hand from his and gave him
  to drink out of an earthenware mug. The pastor rose, crept to the window,
  lifted the tapestry and looked out on to the wide and magnificent courtyard,
  one side of which had been battered down so that the forest loomed sudden and
  fierce into the building, and then was full of men and horses; as far as the
  old man's eyes could see straining into the dark, was the flicker of
  torchlight and the shape of waggons, carts, furled pavilions, and the crossed
  lines of pikes and spears.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the courtyard a man in black armour had raised at the end
  of a pole a bowl of flaming pitch, and the crimson light of this streamed
  over the glossy shapes of rearing horses, the vague forms of plumed and
  cloaked men, and over a mighty banner which moved slowly and solemnly in the
  night breeze and was emblazoned with monstrous double black eagles.</p>

  <p>The pastor dropped the tapestry. He was grave and composed. The woman
  still held the mug of water to the dry lips of the feverish man.</p>

  <p>"As we expected," said the old man, "Wallenstein&mdash;on the march to
  Saxony, as I suppose."</p>

  <p>They had had news of that oncoming march earlier in the day from flying
  peasants whose clothes appeared scorched by cinders from their burning farms.
  Wallenstein was retreating before the Swede after a nine hours' battle, and
  was like enough to come that way...by Karolsfeld.</p>

  <p>"They appear in some disorder," added the pastor quietly. "What shall we
  do? We should have left before, even if it were only into the woods."</p>

  <p>The woman did not answer. She knew the woods were no safer than the
  castle. For months she had fled from one pressing danger to
  another&mdash;hiding, creeping, lying in concealment. The pastor had
  sheltered her until the fireballs had fallen upon his roof, and when her
  betrothed lover was wounded in a foray as he rode with his party to join the
  Swedes and staggered back to her hiding-place, he had found her and the old
  man homeless; between them they had dragged him to the ruins of his castle of
  Karolsfeld, and there he had lain, a helpless man for two days. The woman had
  crept out to the devastated village and found some store of dried fruit put
  by for the winter in one of the fallen cottages, and in another a little
  grain, which she had pounded into meal, and so with wild-berries, and fish
  that the old man had got from the river which ran below the rock on which the
  castle stood, they had lived, while the young man prayed to find the strength
  to lead the woman and the pastor, through no matter what adventure, to the
  Swedish lines or Nürnberg; but, instead, he had become weaker. A blue pallor
  had begun to show through his fine tanned skin and often he had had to clench
  his hands to control the desire to cry aloud with agony.</p>

  <p>"Wallenstein," he murmured, stupidly, "Wallenstein in defeat."</p>

  <p>The woman rose and straightened her gown. It was of silk and torn by the
  sharp bushes from among which she had gathered the wild-berries. She
  said:</p>

  <p>"Surely Wallenstein will not touch a woman, a wounded man and a
  priest?"</p>

  <p>The prostrate youth put his fingers to the bloodstained rags on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"We are in great danger," he sighed out and slowly swooned.</p>

  <p>Covered by a small handkerchief, which she had in happier days embroidered
  with bright blue flowers, was a precious drop of brandy in a horn cup; the
  pastor had saved this for a desperate emergency; as the woman, on her knees
  again, with careful anxiety moistened her lover's distorted lips with these
  costly drops, she was unconscious of the gathering noise and disorder which
  overwhelmed their melancholy peace. Loud murmurings lifted the silence as the
  sullen light lifted the dark.</p>

  <p>A scarlet flame of pitch was being carried up the dark stairs where in
  gaunt niches lay the shattered busts of Caesars carved from crimson
  marble.</p>

  <p>This was the end of a hard tumultuous day for the Imperialists, and all
  the men murmured and groaned among themselves; as they moved, their armour
  rattled like an echo of the crackling fusillade of the Swedes to which they
  had been for ten hours exposed.</p>

  <p>As the blast of an angry storm the Imperialists entered Karolsfeld.</p>

  <p>The door of the chamber where the three fugitives waited was flung open
  and a scarred soldier entered, followed by others, holding out a torch of
  flaring pitch; Wallenstein could endure no lesser light.</p>

  <p>The pastor and the woman looking round in silence, endeavoured to
  distinguish one man from another in the group that this red light disclosed,
  but all these warriors were hot, flushed and bitter, in armour, cloaked and
  plumed; all spoke and moved as if with one volition, so that it seemed to the
  pastor that he did not see many men but one gigantic symbol of war, a cloudy
  impersonal cohort of Mars.</p>

  <p>But the woman distinguished one from the press.</p>

  <p>He was bareheaded and carried his broadsword under his arm. She knew him
  for the leader and the great Wallenstein. He had in close attendance on him,
  a dwarf in a fantastic habit of sulphurous yellow and acrid green, who was
  nearly rolling drunk yet sucked continuously at a horn of liquor he had slung
  round his waist.</p>

  <p>More light, and the little group it revealed, arrested the progress of the
  Imperialists, who had believed they were sweeping through an empty and ruined
  habitation.</p>

  <p>The pastor stepped forward, putting up a silent petition to God that he
  might find strength to face this fearful man, and Wallenstein detached
  himself from his officers and came down the room, accompanied only by the
  lolling dwarf and the soldier with the pitchpine flare.</p>

  <p>"Who is here?" he asked, and snatched a soiled cloth from his waist to dry
  the sweat on his forehead.</p>

  <p>The pastor made no salutation to the Bohemian who was to him as the Prince
  of the Powers of Darkness&mdash;the Bohemian who was reputed to be able to
  stamp the devil out of the ground by thundering with his mailed foot; the old
  man had nothing to lose but his life and his honour; though of the first he
  had grown wearily careless, the second he yet held precious.</p>

  <p>"Sire, I am Martin Gernsheim," he said.</p>

  <p>"A heretic priest," commented Wallenstein, glancing down at the speaker's
  habit.</p>

  <p>"A servant of the Lord."</p>

  <p>"And these?" Wallenstein waved his hand towards the straw.</p>

  <p>The woman still knelt there with her unconscious lover's head on her lap
  and looked over her shoulder at the Imperialists.</p>

  <p>"That," replied Gernsheim, "is Graf Sylvain Eckhardt Erlangen the owner of
  Karolsfeld, who has returned here after much disorder and vicissitude of war
  to die, as I think."</p>

  <p>"Graf Erlangen," repeated Wallenstein slowly, "that is a noble name. I
  knew his father&mdash;he had a better judgment and bore arms for the Emperor.
  Who is the woman?"</p>

  <p>"She is Graf Erlangen's betrothed wife, Saba de Hohendorff; her father,
  her brother, her cousin, all have been slain in the war, and she is reduced
  to seek some shelter with me. This is her and his last retreat. I do not ask
  too much, even from you, Graf Wallenstein, when I demand protection for a
  dying man and a noble lady."</p>

  <p>"You speak," replied Wallenstein, "like all your fry, cunningly and
  presumptuously." He turned to the woman. "Stand up," he commanded.</p>

  <p>She rose, and again she smoothed out the thin silk gown torn by the wild
  bushes.</p>

  <p>The soldier slightly dipped the pitchpine flare and illumined her from
  head to foot.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein stared at her, shifting his sword under his arm and twisting
  round and round his lean wrist the cloth with which he had lately wiped his
  brow. A slight cut had broken out into fresh bleeding and the red blood had
  soaked into his soiled linen.</p>

  <p>Saba de Hohendorff stood motionless under this cruel scrutiny. Tenderly
  bred and through all her youth admired and cherished, she hardly yet realized
  what war made of men. She stood timid, but without any great fear or
  supplication, before the Imperial commander.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein remembered a figure he had seen over a wide church porch in a
  deserted village; so had that stone saint stood in flowing gown and
  close-girdled, with serene look and helpless hands; and he, riding by sullen
  and discontented, had chanced to glance up; the stone countenance pure and
  undefaced, had seemed to smile at him with compassion. Even as he had looked,
  one of his men had raised a carbine, fired, and shattered the figure, so that
  the stone shards had fallen down before the battered church door. Wallenstein
  had explained to none why he had stopped the march to hang that soldier.</p>

  <p>The brandy, the light and the noise had restored Graf Sylvain to his
  senses. He writhed on to his side, plucked at Saba's skirts to pull her
  aside, and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Wallenstein!"</p>

  <p>The two men peered at each other with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you and no lesser captain have come," whispered the young
  Graf, "for I must, being myself, as I take it, dying, entreat your protection
  for an old man and this lady."</p>

  <p>"Ah, young Erlangen," replied Wallenstein softly, "you have come to a
  fearful pass. I recall Karolsfeld when it held a hundred serving-men in the
  kitchen and fifty horses in the stables."</p>

  <p>Graf Sylvain did not answer, but the pastor said:</p>

  <p>"And now there are but rats and owls, sire, and such is war."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein turned to his officers and said that he would make his
  quarters in Karolsfeld that night, bade them inform the sutlers and have his
  furniture and provisions brought into the ruins, and a large pavilion set up
  in the courtyard, with the Emperor's flag and his own raised above the
  highest fragment of the battered keep. "Or, if that be higher, the tallest
  pine tree. The moon rises, so you can the better see, and, if I recall well,
  Karolsfeld is on a mighty height."</p>

  <p>"You keep us," said Martin Gernsheim sternly, "in a suspense as to our
  affairs, general."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein replied negligently:</p>

  <p>"Erlangen is noble and dying, I have no business with him, nor with you.
  There are many wounded men with me and sufficient surgeons. If you will, you
  may have him carried out to the pavilion and given what comfort there
  is."</p>

  <p>"And the noble woman?" asked the pastor. "Where shall I find fitting
  accommodation for her?"</p>

  <p>"You will find none," replied Wallenstein, "you will leave her here with
  me for company."</p>

  <p>The wounded man groaned out: "Then I will not be moved."</p>

  <p>Saba de Hohendorff turned from one to the other, bewildered, and beginning
  to be afraid.</p>

  <p>"She stays," said Wallenstein, "and you may do as you please."</p>

  <p>He seated himself on the chest by the window, from which he pulled down
  the square of tapestry and, seeming to be lost in dark brooding, stared down
  at the hubbub below, over which then fell the quiet light of the rising
  moon.</p>

  <p>The sutlers were coming in with the baggage&mdash;beds, utensils,
  furnishings and provisions were being hurried into Karolsfeld. Gold and
  silver dishes mingled with earthen pots; kettles, ladles, baskets and cradles
  of wine were dragged up the stairs; grease and bread were handed out to the
  soldiers on the confines of the wood and the courtyard, and some began to
  make porridge.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein, as if he noticed none of this, remained at the window-place,
  and his major-generals and marshals, believing him in the worst of moods,
  left him and as quietly as might be, departed from the room.</p>

  <p>The Imperialists had been ten hours under fire, and ten hours in retreat;
  none of them had uttered the word "defeat" for, although the famous Swede had
  thrust upon their forces with all his ferocious valour, with all the force of
  his famous and victorious soldiers, he had not been able to break their
  ranks. Wallenstein had resisted a murderous and infuriated discharge from
  culverin, cannon and musket; his Black Cuirassiers, his Uhlans, his Poles and
  Bavarians had fallen, but not fled, before an atmosphere that sparkled fire,
  crackled as if lashed with whips. Amid clods of earth raised by falling
  cannon-balls, splinters of wood and shards of stone, falling farms and mills,
  amid flaming trees and smoking turf the troops of Wallenstein had stood
  steady. But, in the night, without disclosing his plans to any, not even to
  Piccolomini or Pappenheim, those brilliant and most successful of soldiers,
  the Imperialist commander had drawn off his shattered troops and left the
  Swede undisturbed in Nürnberg. For ten hours the men had marched towards
  Saxony; waggons went heavily with the wounded and dying, the dead in their
  blood-besmirched, dirt-befouled clothing marked the track of the retreating
  forces.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein, like one in heavy thought, had ridden ahead of all,
  immediately before the standard of the black eagles of the Empire. At one
  time, as they passed through the beautiful woods of early autumn he had seen
  a bird in a wild cherry tree among the yet green fruit, and, taking his
  carbine from his saddle, had fired at it, watching to see it fall; he who was
  glutted with the slaughter of war had turned in his saddle to see the little
  bird lying in the sweet grass; he had seemed more like a man tormented than
  one who has satisfied his lust.</p>

  <p>Those who knew him were aware that he would not leave his place by the
  window where he sat looking down brooding upon his half-unseen army which
  spread over the wide slopes of the mountains. As he sat there with arms
  crossed, they brought him water in a great bowl. At Wallenstein's feet lay
  the dwarf, now sunk into an intoxicated slumber; his chest heaved with
  spasms, and his crooked face twitched. Wallenstein pushed him aside with his
  foot and washed away the blood, the dust and the sweat from his own face and
  hands.</p>

  <p>Saba de Hohendorff, who had taken a little stool and sat by the head of
  her lover's straw pallet, watched Wallenstein. She had never seen him before,
  but no other name since the war began&mdash;and that was all her
  youth&mdash;had ever been so frequently in her ears as that of <i>Albrecht
  Wenzel Eusebiws, Graf von Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, Prince of the Holy
  Roman Empire, and Generalissimo of His Imperial Majesty's forces.</i> No
  filthy ogre in an old gossip's tale told by the fire in the long winter
  nights had had so many vile deeds put to his account as this man. Saba
  herself, in deadly terror, had fled before his troops for weeks. Yet, it was
  more with curiosity than fear that she surveyed him, and the pastor, standing
  patiently but without hope beside her, smiled upon her tenderly for her
  simple courage.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein was dishevelled. During the halt he had given his men five
  hours before, amid the trampled cornfields and the hacked orchards, he had
  taken no repose or refreshment. His black-enamelled field armour was dinted
  and marked, his cloak torn, his linen collar fouled. Round his smooth-shaven
  face the black hair hung tangled; but, beneath his lowering brows with the
  dissatisfied frown, his golden-hazel eyes sparkled with the fire of genius.
  There was a painful expression in the lines of his lips; in that tanned,
  lean, aquiline and implacable face, hated by so many, feared by so many more,
  was a certain grandeur and beauty, sinister and melancholy.</p>

  <p>They set a table for him near where he sat and kicked the dwarf out of the
  way, an act of which he took no heed. He laid his broadsword in the
  window-place and taking his tablet, frowned over something that he found
  within. The three by the hearth believed he had forgotten them; but, when he
  looked up and saw the meal was spread, he beckoned to Saba to come across the
  room.</p>

  <p>The wounded man caught at her skirts; she gently disengaged herself and
  obeyed the command of Wallenstein.</p>

  <p>Looking at her across the top of the tablet which he still held open,
  Wallenstein asked her:</p>

  <p>"Do you not wish your lover attended to? Why have you all remained there
  mute, watching me? There is everything in my camp that you can require."</p>

  <p>"You said I was to remain, Sire."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but not your two companions&mdash;they may go."</p>

  <p>"They will not go without me," replied the girl simply. "We have been
  companions too long and he may be dying. If he is, I shall not see him again
  after to-night."</p>

  <p>"I do not take him to be dying," said Wallenstein, "he but lacks
  attention."</p>

  <p>He then spoke quietly to one of the soldiers who were bringing in the
  food, and ordered him to send up a surgeon to see to the wounded man.</p>

  <p>"Does that pacify you, does that please you?" he asked Saba. "The old
  heretic, too, for your sake I will let him go. I will give them both a safe
  conduct to the Swedish lines. Is that enough?"</p>

  <p>Saba moved forward as if about to kiss his hand, though it was still
  stained with blood, but the pastor was quicker and, catching her by the
  wrist, prevented her.</p>

  <p>"You must not accept any of this," he said in a quick whisper. "We will
  take nothing, we will remain together."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein frowned and waved the old man aside and bade the girl sit
  down. She did so. The room was smoky from the flaring resin torch which had
  been fastened in the doorway, though the pan with the pitch in it had been
  taken away the smell of it yet was in the air.</p>

  <p>A surgeon entered and stooped over Graf Sylvain; the wounded youth, whose
  heart was throbbing violently, tried to thrust him aside, but his hands
  feebly slipped away and Wallenstein smiled to see him forced to submit to the
  ministrations of the Imperialist surgeon.</p>

  <p>The girl sat at the table with Wallenstein and looked at the pastor.</p>

  <p>He murmured:</p>

  <p>"The Lord presseth a crown of thorns oft upon our brows."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein laughed and asked the old man to eat: "I am particular about
  my cook."</p>

  <p>There were pastries and meats and fruit, but the sight of them filled Saba
  with a rising nausea. She abhorred the colour of the wine and the sound of it
  as Wallenstein poured out into the long green glasses engraved with the
  double eagle. Martin Gernsheim came nearer to the window so that he could see
  beyond the dark figure of Wallenstein into the courtyard and the pinewoods,
  where the moonlight now showed clearly the bluish-black shapes and the
  rust-red boughs of the trees. The sutlers moved about with their pots and
  provisions among the soldiers; some of these ate riotously and others were
  already drowsy and falling among the baggage, all had an air as if they
  foresaw the coming day as without hope.</p>

  <p>With fatigued and bent bodies the surgeons moved about, they continually
  replenished their pocket-flasks with brandy from casks.</p>

  <p>Startled by the invasion of light the owls fled from the ruined portion of
  Karolsfeld into the depths of the wood, their sweeping wings brushed the
  folds of the floating standard, fringed from musket-fire.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein sat in the window-niche against the half-fallen piece of
  tapestry he had pulled aside. When he saw that Saba would not eat, he took
  away the meat from in front of her and placed before her fruit&mdash;early
  pears and cherries just ripe.</p>

  <p>Martin Gernsheim knew that it was his intention to keep the maiden with
  him and that he did not even concern himself to argue about this.</p>

  <p>The wounded man on his straw groaned and writhed as the newly-bandaged
  wound flushed out red on the clean linen swathed across his chest. Saba
  endeavoured to eat the fruit. A light wind blew chill on her young bosom, the
  outline of which was softly visible beneath the silk gown.</p>

  <p>The pastor spoke without passion and as one disgusted with the meanness of
  his words, which were so beneath the occasion. He pleaded with Wallenstein to
  allow the maiden to go with them; he spoke of her purity, of her noble birth,
  of her misfortunes, of her great love for young Sylvain Erlangen, lying there
  helpless.</p>

  <p>He said:</p>

  <p>"Prince, there sits a lovely and an innocent creature, as it might be in
  this chance of war your own sister, or your own wife."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein did not answer, the pastor could see that he greatly desired
  to keep Saba with him. What could anyone say to move the firm determination
  of a man who had absolute power&mdash;a disappointed, a defeated, and a
  violent man?</p>

  <p>"Prince," stammered Martin Gernsheim, "she is a good creature."</p>

  <p>Wallenstein frowned, thrusting his forefinger between his gorget and his
  white, soiled linen collar.</p>

  <p>A faint cloud, like the heavy breath of a sigh misting a glass, blurred
  the moon.</p>

  <p>"Noble lady," said the pastor, "let us go. The great Wallenstein will not
  keep us, he will give us a safe conduct for all three."</p>

  <p>The man of peace fixed his pale, watery but resolute eyes on the features
  of the man of war.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein pressed his nether lip with his teeth until it was white; his
  hand, twitching, fumbled with his buckles. He said nothing and the pastor
  whispered to the maiden:</p>

  <p>"Rise up and come with me."</p>

  <p>Outside, one of the soldiers was playing a hymn-tune on a metal flute, and
  against this melody was the different rhythm of a drum, to which could be
  heard the tap of heavy boots of men dancing.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein looked down, looked at his coat and the folds of his mantle,
  which were spotted with grease and blood, and handed the leaf that he had
  torn from his tablet to the pastor. It was a safe conduct for all three.</p>

  <p>Martin Gernsheim did not venture to thank him, but Saba drew away so
  quickly and quietly that when Wallenstein raised his eyes her place was
  empty. He put his elbows upon the table and thrust his fingers into his hair,
  with his thumbs under his chin, to watch the three depart. Graf Sylvain,
  under the surgeon's direction, was helped up by two soldiers, but showed
  great weakness, upon which Wallenstein directed that a litter was to be
  brought for him.</p>

  <p>Saba had put on her little coat of blue velvet with swansdown edging,
  which had once been so pretty but was now dirty and dishevelled. She pulled
  nervously at the pastor's sleeve and said:</p>

  <p>"Shall I not thank him&mdash;shall I not go back?"</p>

  <p>The pastor said, "No." His only anxiety was to get them quickly away from
  Karolsfeld. Glancing over his shoulder he had seen Wallenstein's face take on
  a dead look and his dark eyebrows lifted up over his eyes which smouldered
  with a diabolical fire.</p>

  <p>"Leave the man to himself," he whispered, "and what has he done? If he had
  behaved otherwise it would have been the greatest shame to him and his
  Emperor."</p>

  <p>And Sylvain on his litter murmured: "If we thank him it sets us very
  low."</p>

  <p>So in silence they left Karolsfeld, going noiselessly down the shattered
  stairway because they had to follow the litter which was carried awkwardly
  round the corners.</p>

  <p>To the pastor it seemed incredible that he had contrived to save the
  maiden from a man like Wallenstein. As he held and patted the cold little
  hand, he thought tenderly and with gratitude of those noble virgins in the
  old Christian story whom angelic protection had preserved immaculate.</p>

  <p>When they reached the bottom of the stairs they heard a great shouting
  from above. The voice was strained and seemed to be that of some one in
  agony. There was a heavy ado and a running to and fro of Croats and Heyducks
  and a commotion which seemed like to split the dark shell of the castle. The
  soldiers set the wounded man down in the courtyard, where was a great medley
  of light and noise. Graf Sylvain implored the pastor to take Saba away..."I
  shall be well enough, I have his promise, do you get her out of this."</p>

  <p>Here in the courtyard everything became a confusion of movement and sound,
  all had leapt to their feet, whilst the minor officers gave orders. Martin
  Gernsheim thought that possibly the Swedes were upon the Imperialists, but he
  discovered that the cause of all this confusion was the shouting commands
  that came from an upper window.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein was leaning from the window of the room where they had left
  him; his black hair, his lose cravat blew out into the night breeze, which
  was then freshening, and the moon was reflected in his black armour. They
  could not hear what he said. His major-generals and his colonels came
  thundering down the stairs to enforce his commands. The soldiers seemed to
  understand very well. They brought out a great wheel, too large to be used
  for any but a fearful purpose.</p>

  <p>"What are they going to do?" asked Saba.</p>

  <p>A tall Transylvanian dragging up a coil of rope said:</p>

  <p>"He is going to punish some prisoners, he is going to punish someone."</p>

  <p>"Who are the prisoners?" gibbered the pastor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, old man, we have a great many Swedes, Germans, deserters, and some
  citizens, too."</p>

  <p>"And are these all to be put to death?" asked Saba.</p>

  <p>"Certainly they are to be put to death."</p>

  <p>"And how?"</p>

  <p>"Some will be broken on the wheel, some will be hanged, some will have
  stones put round their necks and be thrown in the river; eh, girl, don't you
  know all that?"</p>

  <p>"Why is this?" asked the pastor, "we left him sitting quietly."</p>

  <p>The Transylvanian had passed on with his coil of rope and was helping his
  fellows to set up the wheel.</p>

  <p>A moaning psalm rose from the lips of the Swedish prisoners who had
  glimpsed their fate.</p>

  <p>Two Black Cuirassiers came out of the Castle dragging between them the
  dwarf. He was to be beheaded for being drunk in his master's presence.</p>

  <p>"Take away Saba," groaned Graf Sylvain. The soldiers had placed his litter
  in a doorway.</p>

  <p>The surgeon who had dressed the wound stood beside them.</p>

  <p>"She is safe," he said. "Wallenstein has passed his word, and as for the
  other his wound protects him; for the rest what can you expect? The Swedes
  have given him a set-back, and that is the first time anyone can remember
  that of Wallenstein."</p>

  <p>"This slaughter, this massacre," gasped the pastor, wiping his forehead
  and clasping his hands. "Can nothing be done?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the surgeon. "It is his mood. When he has been silent for
  long, you may be sure he will fall into a frenzy at the end of it. It is,
  perhaps, a convulsion or reaction&mdash;who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Can you not reason with him, restrain him?"</p>

  <p>"Anyone who attempts to do that will himself be sent to the wheel," said
  the surgeon; he added, in a confidential tone&mdash;"You see, he allowed the
  lady to go; now a woman, and one whom he fancies, can very often soothe him;
  but in this case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Saba overheard these words and understood them.</p>

  <p>She saw the Swedish prisoners&mdash;hardy, shabby, small men, many with
  bleeding feet and foreheads being brought out, and they continued to sturdily
  sing their song of Protestant defiance, although their faces were blanched
  and distorted when they were brought near the gallows and the wheel being so
  hastily erected.</p>

  <p>The pastor and the surgeon endeavoured to draw the girl to safety, to take
  her away into the pinewoods where she would see none of this frightful
  spectacle, and the sick man, with a frantic and feverish force, entreated her
  to escape.</p>

  <p>Saba slipped out of their hands, returned to the Castle and forced her way
  up the staircase, which was then full of terrified men&mdash;soldiers,
  sutlers and camp servants; when they saw her pressing up some murmured, all
  seemed to make a way for her, to hustle her roughly forward and upward,
  passing her from hand to hand so that she scarcely touched the steps at all,
  bringing her at last to the door of Wallenstein's room.</p>

  <p>A tall field-marshal, whose armour was covered with looped tassels and
  scarlet ribbons, said to her: "If you go into him you may change his
  mood."</p>

  <p>Saba was alone among enemies. She hurried on and looked about her in the
  chamber lit by the flaring pitch-pine for Wallenstein; he stood there by the
  table, which still bore her plate with the untouched fruit. He had wrenched
  off his gorget and torn open his black taffeta cravat and soiled white linen
  collar, so that his neck was bare; he had pulled at his cuirass with a force
  which had broken the strap, so that it hung from one shoulder only. His sword
  was again slung up under his arm and, straddling with his hands on his hips,
  he gazed out like a madman, on the scene of the execution of his orders for
  death and torment.</p>

  <p>Saba came up to him, her breast heaving. When he saw her his voice fell
  and he stared:</p>

  <p>"I sent you away," he said gloomily.</p>

  <p>She nodded, unable to speak.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come back?" he insisted.</p>

  <p>Unable to think of an apt reply, she said, foolishly:</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of the forest, the dark and the shadows, and even the
  moonlight."</p>

  <p>He did not hear what she said, but he was pleased and soothed by her
  beauty and gentleness, the soft lines of the silk gown, by the delicate fair
  face and disordered blonde hair. She sat down at the table and said,
  breathlessly:</p>

  <p>"I am hungry, and fatigued."</p>

  <p>She began to eat the pear and the cherries that he had given her before
  and which she had rejected.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein looked at her and as he paused, the hubbub and commotion in
  the chamber was silenced, and, so long as any orders did not come down from
  that room, the hubbub and commotion in the castle and in the courtyard was
  silenced also. But there was still to be heard the tap of the hammers and the
  drag of the rope as gallows and wheel were put into place.</p>

  <p>Saba finished the cherries, and Wallenstein still gazed at her. She then
  offered him a pear and asked him to cut it for her..."If it pleases you."</p>

  <p>His eyelids lifted, showing a look of pleasure at this request.</p>

  <p>Saba said, watching him:</p>

  <p>"That is a fearful noise without. Can you not tell them to cease that we
  may have a little peace?"</p>

  <p>He asked: "Have you come to stay with me?"</p>

  <p>Saba said, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"But what did the heretic priest say, and are you not the betrothed wife
  of Sylvain Erlangen?"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I have come to stay," she said steadily; as she took the
  pear from him their fingers touched. "Do you care for music, Prince? I have a
  guitar hidden in this house, and I can play on it well enough to beguile a
  tired man."</p>

  <p>"Aye," he muttered, "I am a tired man tonight."</p>

  <p>"Be done then," she said, "with all this noise and stir without."</p>

  <p>He sat opposite to her at the table; she smiled, and as his convulsive
  nervous tension relaxed, she saw how sad the man was, how fatigued and
  tormented. In the faces of the men behind him she saw relief and gratitude.
  They glanced and signalled one to the other. They crept away, the confusion
  of sound diminished below. There was no longer the tap of hammer, the drag of
  rope, or the psalm of the prisoners; the cackle of the drunken dwarf rose in
  shrill glee.</p>

  <p>Saba gravely finished eating her pear, and Wallenstein still regarded her.
  Then she rose and went to him and unfastened his cuirass, as she had learned
  to fasten and unfasten the cuirass of her lover Sylvain Erlangen, and laid it
  down in the window niche. He drank a little wine and ate a little bread, but
  never ceased to look at her. Presently he asked her where she kept the
  guitar.</p>

  <p>She said, "I will fetch it." And when she rose he followed her, taking
  with him a burning lanthorn.</p>

  <p>The guitar was in the turret chamber which she had used as a bedroom since
  she had hidden in Karolsfeld. Above this turret apartment now hung
  Wallenstein's standard and that of the double eagle. On her bed was a
  soldier's blanket, and in a broken goblet she had placed a bouquet of autumn
  daisies, strong white and yellow.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein set the lanthorn on the table beside these. Saba took the
  guitar from a hook on the wall; one of the strings was broken. She mended it
  with steady fingers, her face was serious. Everything was by then silent and
  the moon going down behind the mountains, so that between this setting and
  the rising of the sun there would be a little space of dark.</p>

  <p>Saba took off her small jacket trimmed with soiled swansdown and seated on
  the bed, began to play her guitar. She was very skilful in small fine arts.
  The soldier listened, pacing up and down the narrow room and as she played,
  told her of the last day and night&mdash;the ten hours' attack by the Swedes,
  the ten hours' falling back from Nürnberg. She learnt from what he said that
  he was a man who would venture to storm heaven and set his heel on hell, that
  he had been forced to draw away from the Swedes and their leader&mdash;a
  Protestant northern invader&mdash;he, the mighty Bohemian, the greatest
  soldier in the world! Not in precise words did he tell her this, she sensed
  it. She did not remind him that he was making this confession to one who was
  a Protestant and of his enemies.</p>

  <p>The oil of the lanthorn failed, the flame flickered wearily from side to
  side. Wallenstein tried to guard this fleeting fire. Saba rested her soft
  bosom against the guitar. She said:</p>

  <p>"It is a terrible thing, Prince, to have so much power. You spend your
  life among maimed and dying men, wounded limbs, ambulances, doctors,
  massacres...You march through towns in mourning, you tramp across the country
  bleeding to death..." Her voice faltered and grew stammering, she had no
  longer the strength or the courage to touch the strings of the guitar.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein endeavoured to stay the flame in the lanthorn; he told her he
  was afraid of the dark. She was the first person to know this and he was put
  to many shifts and devices to keep a light in his pavilion or in his
  quarters.</p>

  <p>He spoke that like a confession, bending low over the dying flame, which
  faintly illumined his tormented and sombre face&mdash;yes, afraid of the dark
  ever since he had been a small child and woken up screaming at the blackness
  round about him&mdash;the alive and terrible dark.</p>

  <p>"There will be a little moon yet," she said in faltering, husky tones.</p>

  <p>But he replied that the moon had gone behind the shoulder of the mountain
  and the thickly-placed pines.</p>

  <p>"I am greatly to be pitied," he muttered, "more to be pitied than you or
  anyone." He was still absorbed in watching the sinking flame, and she crept
  nearer the door.</p>

  <p>When it became utterly dark she surely could escape, even if it was only
  to dash herself to pieces from the ramparts, to fall perhaps, near where her
  lover lay muttering maledictions on her name for turning back. But when she
  had her hand on the door, the flame sank out suddenly and in the darkness she
  heard the soldier cry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me!"</p>

  <p>She stood still; first the complete blackness, then the faint grey square
  of the window, then that obscured by his black figure. She had no protection.
  She snatched up the goblet of daisies and held it against her bosom, for a
  second it formed a barrier between them, then fell, the flowers and the
  broken earthenware across their feet&mdash;her thin, small shoes, his thick
  and heavy boots.</p>

  <p>He embraced her closely, she was consoled by the knowledge of his need of
  her, his fear of the dark.</p>

  <p>In the courtyard among the soldiers the sick man moaned and languished on
  his litter. Now and then the surgeon attended to him and the pastor spoke
  words of consolation. Presently both became yawning and drowsy and slept.
  Only the young man lay wide awake, rigid, staring up at the black
  heavens.</p>

  <p>In the morning the Imperialists departed.</p>

  <p>Wallenstein was early in the saddle. He rode away with a great guard of
  Spanish and Italian generals, of field-marshals, colonels and glittering
  commanders, he had hung the Golden Fleece round his neck and there was a
  diamond in his hat. The Black Cuirassiers, on a whetstone in the courtyard,
  once more sharpened their swords, now worn so thin that they seemed like
  ribbons. Wallenstein looked back and up as his flag and the flag with the
  black eagles were taken down from the highest turret of Karolsfeld&mdash;the
  turret which was higher than the loftiest pine. The expression on his face
  was the same as it had been yesterday when he had glanced round at the cherry
  tree from which he had shot the little bird with his carbine&mdash;an
  expression more of a man tormented than of a man who has gratified a
  lust.</p>

  <p>Saba de Hohendorff came down the turret stairs to find her lover. She had
  plaited up her hair, fastened the blue jacket with the soiled swansdown close
  to her chin, the rents made by the wild bushes in her gown were longer. She
  came to the sick man's litter. He turned away his head and as she bent over
  him, struck out with his hand at her, feebly. The pastor looked at her
  sorrowfully. The angels had not been able to protect her...the prisoners had
  been spared, but she had been sacrificed.</p>

  <p>She appeared to have been weeping, her beauty was eclipsed; she seemed to
  the pastor altogether a lesser creature than she had been yesterday; she had
  nothing to suggest. He advised her to keep out of Graf Sylvain's sight, if
  she wished him to recover his health. He said he would pray for her soul.</p>

  <p>Saba did not answer. She looked down at the face of the man who yesterday
  she had believed she loved, at the high cheekbones glazed with the scarlet of
  fever, at the cracked lips and the sunken eyes.</p>

  <p>"He does not wish to speak to me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The pastor shook his head. "No, that you can understand." His tone was
  different from the tone he had used yesterday when he had called her "a noble
  lady."</p>

  <p>Saba stood aside; she crept to the door and sat on the top step with her
  hands clasped round her knees. She saw a cart brought up and Graf Sylvain put
  in, and the pastor get in beside him. He did not look back at her. The
  surgeon had evidently arranged this accommodation. They went off through the
  forest to the Swedish lines, she supposed, to at least some adventure in
  which she would have no part.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the army had departed, only a few stragglers remained. These
  were women, draggled and tawdry; old men and a few peasants with wine, beer
  and vegetables, which they hoped to sell to the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Saba sitting apart, alone, watched a filthy old harridan making porridge
  over a fire of dried thistles and last year's fir cones. She was hungry,
  faint and cold. When the old woman had finished her mess she put a little of
  it in a wooden cup and, crossing the courtyard, offered it to Saba. The girl
  ate it as eagerly as a famished animal. The hag surveyed her with some
  compassion.</p>

  <p>Sensing this pity in the bleared gaze bent upon her, Saba's tears again
  began to fall and were caught in the empty bowl which the old woman took away
  and wiped on her apron.</p>

  <p>"You had better come with us," she suggested.</p>

  <p>But Saba de Hohendorff continued to weep.</p>

  <p>The trumpets of the Imperialist army rang out over Karolsfeld as the
  rearguard glittered down the mountain side.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03-4"
     id="ch-03-4"></a>SERENATA</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>A Florentine night-piece composed by Nicolo Antonio
  Porpora for His Serene Highness the Grand Duke Gian Felice of Florence.</i>
  [ITALY, 18th Century.]</p>

  <p>Everything inclines to its own conclusion."...The Virtuoso, Nicolo Antonio
  Porpora, seated lonely in his small chamber of the vast palace, found in the
  opening bars of his <i>Serenata</i> the theme that would bring it to an
  end...The work was a failure&mdash;a false composition&mdash;undertaken to
  order, with no heart in it...Where he should have evoked gaiety and
  voluptuous pleasure he had evoked melancholy and a sense of
  disillusion&mdash;the terror of fruition which is so near decay. He desired
  to write motets and masses, but the Grand Duke had ordered a serenata, and
  Porpora, for his livelihood, was forced to obey&mdash;had he been independent
  he would have composed the melodies which lay tranquil in his soul, but that,
  it seemed, could never be&mdash;the artist always at the service of a prince!
  He played and mused over the incomplete <i>Serenata</i>. "<i>Rondo al Gran
  Duca</i>"&mdash;what should that be&mdash;what did he know of the Grand Duke,
  after all? Nothing very admirable. Certainly he was gallant, and young, and
  not ill-looking. But the Virtuoso thought that his master's brains were not
  of the finest quality, he knew him to be idle and selfish, obstinate and
  extravagant, wilful and reckless; how put these qualities into music?</p>

  <p>Porpora dropped his old violet-veined hands, which had become dry and
  delicate from making music, plucking at strings, touching keys, bows, stops,
  sighed in the warmth of the night and went to the window; as he leaned out
  and looked to the right and the left he could see the immense blank white
  façade of the palace, which alarmed him with its impressive aloof air of
  power; the night was of amazing beauty. "But the most amazing of all,"
  thought the Virtuoso, "is that we find it wonderful. Ever since I have known
  anything I have known the moon, yet, on a night like this, I still marvel at
  it. Everything inclines to its own conclusion, and they say the moon is
  dying. How does the Grand Duke spend his nights, and for whom does he wish
  the <i>Serenata</i> written? It will be a cold composition&mdash;how will it
  go? <i>Capriccio</i>, I think&mdash;a loose affair without order or method,
  as the young man is himself..."</p>

  <p>Porpora returned reluctantly and with an air of fatigue to the spinet;
  into the warm, breathless silence of the immense palace, into the voluptuous
  stillness of Florence&mdash;silent beneath the September moon&mdash;the
  halting, hesitant, contradictory notes of the Grand Duke's <i>Serenata</i>
  rose from beneath the fastidious fingers of the Virtuoso...Beauty, that was
  it, one must search for beauty, and there the night helped&mdash;the night,
  like the artist, ignored or transformed all that was vile or sordid, ugly or
  contemptible&mdash;the night, the hot moonlight night of September gave the
  illusion of immortality to loveliness, to passion and to art...Perhaps,
  inspired by the night and avoiding the fear of disillusion which touched his
  withering heart, the Virtuoso might yet compose something that had a breath
  of sublimity in it, even if it was not a masterpiece for a generous and
  reckless young prince. There was everything in the night, the transparency of
  water and the glitter of gems; the perfumes from the palace garden, the
  odours from those flowers which were crushed and bowed beneath the heat of
  the day might make a priest forget his book, a saint his meditation; these
  odours, stirring through the open window, mocked the music&mdash;the melody
  not yet created, the theme already faded and effete...</p>

  <p>"It requires something grand and splendid," thought the Virtuoso in
  despair; "something that dazzles with ornament and is adorned with fancies;
  something that is easy to learn, too, sweet and yet austere. A young man
  should write for him&mdash;whatever I compose will have a note of irony
  through it, and that unkind satire which is a gibe at infirmity."</p>

  <p>Yes, an amazing night, a lovely night&mdash;the moon enveloping all the
  city of Florence with a piercing and a poignant radiance! The rose, the
  oleander, the lily and the laurel, syringa and myrtle&mdash;pouring out this
  unseen libation of perfume&mdash;the overwhelming beauty of the
  night...enchantment. The feebleness of the music that faltered from the
  spinet was like the lament of humanity for its own weakness and inadequacy in
  the face of a night like this. What should one put into a <i>serenata</i>?
  Perhaps, when she turned, the pins&mdash;of gold or silver, would they
  be?&mdash;would fall through her loosened bronze-coloured hair, and strike on
  the alabaster tiles of her chamber&mdash;would that be a harmony one could
  reproduce? Or, if she ventured on to her balcony and leant against the rigid
  iron of the balustrade, what sound would the stiff taffetas of her dress make
  crushing against the sides of the window?</p>

  <p>A bell lamented from <i>Santa Maria dei Fiori</i>. Porpora thought of the
  dome of the cathedral, where the moonlight would glisten gracefully on all
  those high plaques of coloured marble, faded rose, azure, amber, pearl; the
  clock of white silvered porcelain on the mantelpiece struck twelve times. The
  Virtuoso sighed, tore up his score, and returned to his labours&mdash;a
  <i>Serenata</i> for the Grand Duke...September and moonlight in Florence.</p>

  <p>While the echo from the last stroke of the bell of <i>Santa Maria dei
  Fiori</i> lingered in the translucent air a man drew back into the shadows of
  the arcade of a silent palace on the bank of the Arno. He had lightly and
  cautiously closed the shadowed side-door behind him, and he now lightly and
  cautiously looked to right and left along the curved embankment with the low
  balustrade; his eyes were quick, his perceptions acute, and he at once
  observed a group of men lingering darkly in the distant strip of shadow which
  the moon, rising behind him, cast from the palace as far as the parapet which
  edged the yellow, noisy river. The darkness of this group of men showed that
  they were sombrely cloaked against observation; their stillness showed they
  waited for some one&mdash;possibly for him, Gian Felice, possibly for some
  one else; it would, in any case, be reckless to pass that way; he believed
  there were four or five of them. He paused, not alarmed or hesitant, but
  swiftly considering. He had been visiting Engracia on an errand of farewell;
  he was invaded by a sensation of futility and depression. If among these
  lurking enemies was her husband, or this was his arrangement, it would be
  very stupid to be killed for the sake of a mistress one had, with some
  difficulty, discarded&mdash;in any case, it would be detestable to be cast
  into the Arno and washed down through Pisa to those muddy flats where the
  winding river carried its refuse to the sea...Gian Felice therefore waited in
  the shadow, wondering whether they had perceived that he had left the palace.
  If they were not waiting for him and he declared himself, he might pass them
  without mischance, but such an action had a dull and undignified air. Gian
  Felice, keeping close to the flat front of the palace, moved away from where
  the group of assassins lurked, but he peered cautiously back over his
  shoulder, which was muffled by a dark cloak, and perceived that they, also
  cautiously and with a creeping, stealthy movement, were following him,
  waiting, no doubt, until some lonely spot was reached where his cries and
  struggles would not be heard. He believed that while he kept along the banks
  of the Arno they would not venture to attack, for at his first cry for help
  many of those lattices would be thrown open, lights and voices would break
  the drowsy moonlight, and, even if they succeeded in murdering him, it was
  not likely that they would escape pursuit; therefore, as long as he kept flat
  to the palace like that&mdash;so one with the shadows that if they essayed a
  shot they would have no good aim&mdash;he was safe enough; but, presently,
  the palaces ended and the embankment concluded sharply in the city walls and
  fortifications, a labyrinth of dark and intricate lanes leading to the viler
  quarters of the town.</p>

  <p>Gian Felice, crouching like a cat in the shadow, grinned beneath his mask;
  he had an angry sense of being trapped. How often he had been warned of just
  such a situation as this, and how lightly and mockingly he had disregarded
  all such warnings! But now...folly and imprudence were all very amusing until
  something happened. On the other side of the hastening river the blackness of
  cypress trees rose into the pellucid silver of the sky and across the
  glittering white marble circle of a window in a marble church. Gian Felice
  thought of requiem masses and his own body being borne into the chancel,
  while organ and choir proclaimed an official regret. The sharp smell of
  lemon, the drowsy perfume of night-scented lilies coming from a courtyard
  enclosed behind a gilt-scrolled gate, gave him an intense desire for life. He
  was angry with himself for ever having been bored, or weary, or full of
  lassitude; if he escaped this present peril he would enjoy every minute of
  every hour of life, without scruple, remorse, regret, or hesitancy.</p>

  <p>The assassins were gaining upon him, already he seemed to feel the
  muffling folds of a heavy cloak flung over his head, rendering all cries
  useless. Should he stop now and strike on one of those silent, locked doors,
  and demand assistance. But they were too close; before he could have made the
  gesture they would have been upon him.</p>

  <p>Who could it be? Engracia's husband, was he so interested and so careful?
  It was well known that, despite his fifty years and a constitution enfeebled
  by all manner of excesses, he was more likely to be sighing beneath the
  balcony of another man's wife than protecting his own...Perhaps the affair
  was political, perhaps they mistook him for some one else. Gian Felice
  reached the dark angle of a column, he stood at the corner of a narrow lane
  where the massive buildings were only a foot or so apart, where the shadow
  was thick and solemn, for in these narrow alleys the light of the moon could
  not penetrate until directly overhead, and then even only as a line of light;
  with sardonic swiftness Gian Felice at this important corner turned and fled
  with rapid violence into the obscurity of the dark by-street. He was
  immediately followed by his pursuers. He could hear their footsteps on the
  cobbles, and, at the thought of what would happen if he fell or they overtook
  him, Gian Felice became profoundly vexed. This would, indeed, be a stupid
  extinction of a life that had been by no means without a pulse of
  delight&mdash;a life which had, perhaps, with a careful juxtaposition of
  events, led precisely to this moment&mdash;" All things inclined towards
  their own end." Yet the rhythm of his flight soothed his apprehensions, for
  he was a fine athlete, and even now the exercise of his strength and powers
  pleased him. He was being gained on, however, by his pursuers, and they were
  not so far away.</p>

  <p>Sharp and clear amongst all those darkened windows in the dark palaces he
  saw a small lamp which hung in a high apartment between the leaves of a
  partially opened lattice. The rays of this light, like kindly indicating
  fingers, showed a balcony, where stone acanthus leaves supported pillars of
  red marble and wound downwards into the heavy coronals of caryatides who
  upheld the rich foliated porch above a deep-set door. Gian Felice, who began
  to hear the pulsating of his own blood hammering in his ears, was guided by
  that insistent light, mounted the nearest caryatid&mdash;a foot in the stone
  drapery, a foot in the crooked stone elbow, another on the crown of stone
  flowers, and so up on to the balcony. He could hear them below, almost upon
  him, panting, whispering. The light came from a small lamp hanging in bronze
  chains in the window-place; he turned it down and threw his cloak over it in
  one movement. When the pursuers came up to the palace where he lurked it was
  dark as the others and by no means to be distinguished from them; Gian Felice
  waited, motionless, save for a soft caress for a bruised hand. They had
  passed, but they were not satisfied, he heard them going to and fro in the
  narrow street beneath. Conscious of the indignity of his position he became
  angry and cast over in his mind a plan of revenge...Intolerable that he
  should thus be pursued through the streets of Florence, that his heart should
  be made to beat so high, his forehead become damp, his limbs to tremble!
  Insupportable! and he inwardly raged that he could not very easily discover
  who these pursuers were, or even if they knew him or not; for all he could
  guess they might have been hunting another man, for he could scarcely flatter
  himself that he was the only recipient of the favours of Engracia.</p>

  <p>He turned into the room which was in darkness and then longed for some
  glimmer of the light which he had so impulsively extinguished; he dared not
  descend into the street by the same way he had ascended, for he believed that
  the assassins would be lingering there. How then, without a light or guide,
  find a way out of the palace which might be the residence of an enemy? Gian
  Felice moved, slightly hesitant, through a blackness so complete that even
  when his eyes became used to it he could distinguish nothing. Making his way
  delicately with outspread hands, careful as a tight-rope dancer, he avoided
  the furniture in the room and proceeded without noise. He hoped in this
  manner to find the door and so to get out on the stairs and leave the palace
  by some exit at the back; but his good fortune did not long attend him. His
  foot struck some slight object and a jangled wail of music arose. He had
  knocked against a guitar. A woman's sigh rose in a pant of terror from the
  dark&mdash;a woman's voice, startled from dreams, whispered in deep
  alarm:</p>

  <p>"The light! where is the light?"</p>

  <p>He heard her move, apparently she was searching for a flint and taper.
  Gian Felice had never found women among his enemies, but he was a little
  alarmed at the present situation; never before had he been so utterly in a
  woman's power. He judged it best to declare himself and not to wait for any
  revelation he might make when the light came.</p>

  <p>"Signora," he whispered earnestly, cautiously approaching the direction of
  the voice. "Flying for my life from a number of assassins, I took refuge in
  your open window, and quenched your light to confuse my pursuers. If you will
  be so generous as to show me the way out of your house I shall always
  consider you my guardian angel."</p>

  <p>Gian Felice felt this speech to be rather cold and formal, but surprise at
  the presence of a lady and doubt as to her appearance made him unable to
  better accomplish a compliment at a moment's notice. She was silent; he
  commended her for that&mdash;at least she would not betray him with a
  senseless clamour of useless alarm. He grasped what he knew must be one of
  the slender posts of her bed and waited for her answer to his appeal. When
  this came it was completely commonplace. The voice out of the dark said:</p>

  <p>"Supposing my husband should come in?"</p>

  <p>Gian Felice had heard that remark so often and in such different
  tones&mdash;of coquetry, alarm, invitation, and menace...</p>

  <p>He sighed and replied civilly: "Precisely; therefore, may I entreat you to
  get me out of the house as quickly as possible?"</p>

  <p>The unseen lady sighed also, and asked him what hour it was?</p>

  <p>"I do not exactly know, Signora, I heard midnight strike when I first
  noticed I was pursued, and that cannot be more than half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of time, then," said the lady's voice, but still in a sighing and
  melancholy fashion; "my husband is out on a most important affair, and it is
  not likely he will return much before the dawn. I am alone in the palace,
  save for a few servants&mdash;most of whom are devoted to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then," replied Gian Felice, "I shall not much inconvenience you by asking
  you to assist me in my escape."</p>

  <p>"Particularly," returned the voice, softly and sadly, "as I am myself
  escaping to-night."</p>

  <p>"You were expecting a lover?" he asked regretfully, "and I have put out
  the light which was to have been his signal?"</p>

  <p>"How you mistake me!" protested the voice, wistfully; "I have no lover,
  and that light which you extinguished illuminated a little image of the
  Mother of God."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Gian Felice, confounded by this innocence, "you said that
  you were escaping tonight..."</p>

  <p>"And so I am, I am going to a convent. I always had a religious
  inclination; and once I am in the convent the good Sisters will see that
  neither my husband's violence nor his money gets me out again."</p>

  <p>"You are leaving the world?" said Gian Felice regretfully, "and I think
  your voice sounds charming&mdash;I believe you are a beautiful woman, and I
  am already more than half in love with you."</p>

  <p>"I am quite pretty," conceded the voice tenderly. "I have that dark,
  thick, yellow hair that belongs to the ladies of Siena, my features are
  tolerable, and my eyes a pleasant blue&mdash;a colour which, as you know, is
  not very common in Italy. I was married at fifteen to a man of fifty-five,
  and I have been singularly unhappy. I am tormented by his causeless
  jealousy."</p>

  <p>They always were, he knew that "causeless jealousy."...</p>

  <p>"Is there no refuge besides the convent from a jealous husband?" protested
  Gian Felice. He walked along beside the bed and, delicately searching, found
  the lady's hand outside the coverlet. She did not resist, but allowed her
  fingers to lie in his.</p>

  <p>"If you knew my whole story, I declare you would pity me," she said with
  another sigh, "but I have finished with this life. I have made all
  arrangements secretly through Jacinth, my woman. At two o'clock the convent
  gate by the fig tree will stand open, and I shall pass in; it will close
  behind me for ever."</p>

  <p>"What caused you to take this most desperate resolution?" asked Gian
  Felice, caressing her hand, which he had found young, small and soft.</p>

  <p>"My husband was so absurd as to become jealous of the Grand Duke."</p>

  <p>"Jealous of the Grand Duke?" exclaimed Gian Felice. "Who then, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Who then are you, should I not ask?" commanded the lady, slightly
  piqued.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I spoke harshly," apologized Gian Felice humbly. "I am a
  gentleman of Naples, on a visit to Florence."</p>

  <p>"Remain <i>incognito</i>, if you please," replied the lady indifferently,
  "I have done with things of this world, as I have said. My name is Dionisia.
  My husband is a provincial nobleman of some pretensions; perhaps it would be
  more prudent if I did not give you his title."</p>

  <p>"Let us both be nameless," agreed Gian Felice, "such a proceeding appears
  to fit the complete darkness in which we meet and shall, no doubt, part. But,
  tell me, how is it possible that your husband should be jealous of you and
  the Grand Duke?"</p>

  <p>"Why should it not be possible?" retorted the lady. "Not having seen me
  you cannot possibly judge whether I am unlikely to attract the attention of
  the Grand Duke&mdash;which is not so difficult, after all. He has been
  pleased, let me remind you, Signor, with lesser beauties than I have
  pretension to be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As to that," replied Gian Felice, "I always thought that his taste was
  excellent. Where did you meet?"</p>

  <p>"At the Opera," cried the lady; "we were one side of the theatre and he
  was the other, and my husband would have it that he was looking at me and
  signalling."</p>

  <p>"Signalling at the Opera!" exclaimed Gian Felice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, everybody knows that he has a code of signals: for instance, when he
  touches his cravat twice it means, May I send you a box of sweetmeats? When
  he twists one of his curls round his fingers it means, Will you be at home
  this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, does it, indeed?" said Gian Felice dubiously. "Everybody knows of
  this secret code?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Dionisia, "such things soon get about, do they not? And
  my husband swore that he saw him making these signals to me."</p>

  <p>"And I could swear," remarked Gian Felice, "that he never even noticed
  you."</p>

  <p>"You cannot possibly swear any such thing until you have seen me,"
  complained the lady, pulling her hand away from his, "and whether he did or
  not, it was quite sufficient for my husband to make my life a torment to me.
  And I have decided to leave the vanities and temptations of the world, to
  retire to a convent and there dedicate myself to the service of heaven."</p>

  <p>"And did not the Grand Duke give any indication of rescuing you from your
  unfortunate position?"</p>

  <p>"Alas," sighed the lady melodiously, from the dark, "I have neither seen
  nor heard anything of him since that day, and I fear that even if I took his
  fancy he soon forgot me. I take this mortification as a punishment for the
  sin I was guilty of in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In what?" asked Gian Felice eagerly.</p>

  <p>"In regarding him with too indulgent an eye," admitted the lady. "I
  confess that I could not help contrasting him, very favourably, with my
  husband&mdash;" then she added, on a note of sweet thoughtfulness, "and if I
  had allowed myself to love him, and if by any chance he should
  have&mdash;well, not loved, but amused himself with me, my heart would have
  broken in despair; therefore, it is better that I go into the convent."</p>

  <p>Gian Felice tried again to find her hand on the silk coverlet. This time
  it escaped him. The darkness weighed on his eyelids and oppressed his
  heart.</p>

  <p>"May I, at least," he asked, "escort you to the gate of the convent?"</p>

  <p>She replied simply: "Yes, I will help you to get out of the house, and you
  may come as far as the convent gate if you wish; since you tell me you are a
  stranger here and in peril of your life I owe you just this much kindness,
  for I have heard that Florence is a very wicked city and full of sin,
  especially at night. My husband, himself&mdash;and, since you are a stranger
  to all of us, I may tell you this&mdash;is out on an evil errand."</p>

  <p>"Ah, is he indeed?" asked Gian Felice, rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>"That is why I have chosen to-night to escape, for I know he will be fully
  occupied. He betrayed himself to me by chance, and since then I have watched
  him, and come at the truth of a conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"A conspiracy," repeated Gian Felice softly, but alert.</p>

  <p>"He and a number of other gentlemen who have, they say, their grievances,
  are out to-night to assassinate the Grand Duke."</p>

  <p>"Indeed they are!" exclaimed Gian Felice, "and you appear to take that
  very calmly, signora."</p>

  <p>"I take it very calmly," replied the lady, and he felt that she smiled,
  "because I have taken steps to prevent it. This morning I sent a note to the
  palace, warning the Grand Duke of the conspiracy, telling him to remain
  indoors...It seems he was expected at a certain palace&mdash;how my husband
  found that out I don't know, but I suppose the Grand Duke was betrayed; in
  any case, the assassins will wait in vain."</p>

  <p>Gian Felice was silent, nor did she speak&mdash;the darkness seemed to
  dissolve them into a dream in the heart of the other, so that they appeared
  to be a voice, a sigh, answering each to each; striving against this
  illusion, he said, sighing:</p>

  <p>"Do not enter a convent, there must be happiness somewhere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Crescendo&mdash;fruition&mdash;completion!&mdash;the words seemed to hover
  in the dark...</p>

  <p>"We are born with the seeds of death in us," whispered the lady's voice,
  "we never touch the utmost, nor achieve perfection&mdash;it is better to
  forego everything than to be content with a second best."</p>

  <p>"But you could have loved the Grand Duke," said Gian Felice warmly, "and
  he, I am sure, could have loved you."</p>

  <p>"He has loved too many," replied Dionisia, "and I have never loved at
  all&mdash;we are not fairly matched. Memory is better than a
  disillusion."</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, moving towards the head of her bed, "we will escape
  together."</p>

  <p>He heard her rise, he heard her move about in the dark room and take up
  the guitar, strike the strings and sing to it, so faintly that her murmur was
  but another added sweetness in the night...</p>

  <p class="poem">"Why hast thou gone from me, my lost delight<br>
  Wilt thou return to me one summer night?<br>
  When my lone lattice high<br>
  Opés on a midnight sky&mdash;<br>
  Empty and bright!"</p>

  <p>She passed him and he felt the lightest touch from her drapery; he heard a
  door open, and she begged him to wait for her in the corridor.</p>

  <p>"You are safe, and I shall not be long before I join you."</p>

  <p>Gian Felice waited in the outer greyness, for here a window opened on to
  the garden, which the moon's rays were already beginning to illuminate,
  rising above the blackness of the crowded palaces opposite. She joined him;
  he could discern nothing of her since she was cloaked and hooded with dark
  and decorous material&mdash;still a shade among shades was Dionisia; he
  followed her down the shallow stairs through the intermingled greynesses of
  many shadows, and down another sombre corridor, and out through a side door,
  which led into a by-street, where the lingering glooms of night still hovered
  before the ever-mounting moon.</p>

  <p>"Let us make haste," whispered Dionisia from behind her mask, "in case
  somebody endeavours to overtake us."</p>

  <p>They walked swiftly between the high palaces, which were all blank,
  shuttered, silent, and unlit. A peacock screamed from some distant pleasance,
  and from high, straight walls hung cascades of roses&mdash;all pallid,
  colourless in the moonlight; above these lofty walls showed the erect spears
  of cypress, the black boughs of chestnut and honeysuckle emitting its pungent
  nocturnal scent, brightly ringed by fireflies, which, gay and useless as
  disembodied joys, hovered wilfully in the moonshot air.</p>

  <p>They came out into the Grand Piazza, in the centre of which stood the new
  monument to the Grand Duke, erected but a few months before; a huge figure in
  bronze on a rearing horse, raised on a massive plinth of stone; the flying
  curls, laurel wreath, Roman attire and raised arm of this authoritative and
  commanding potentate, colossal in size and grandly sweeping in outline, was
  harshly and blackly relieved against the pale moon-filled sky.</p>

  <p>Gian Felice and Dionisia, small and frail in comparison with this gigantic
  bronze warrior, crept into the shadow of the plinth and waited, to ease their
  beating hearts and rest their trembling limbs, for they had come with great
  rapidity through many winding and cobbled streets, and she was faint with
  regret and he with expectancy.</p>

  <p>"We are nearly there," whispered Dionisia. "How utterly lonely it is here
  in the great Piazza which, in the daytime, is so full of noise and
  people!"</p>

  <p>An ancient beggar had fallen asleep at the base of the statue; a
  half-broken <i>viol d'amore</i> lay across his ragged knees; his old age, his
  dirt and his rags were all glorified by the moonlight. He appeared a figure
  of ivory and ashes; his white beard swept the broken instrument; he was like
  Time asleep over a ruined dream of great beauty, as he reposed, weary, on the
  hard stone in the hard shadow, while high above his head leapt magnificently
  into the air in petrified action the bronze horse and the bronze rider.</p>

  <p>"It is the Grand Duke," whispered Dionisia, peering up, "how large and
  implacable and magnificent he looks!"</p>

  <p>"In reality," smiled Gian Felice, "he is only an ordinary man like
  myself."</p>

  <p>"How close here seems the perfume of myrtle and roses! I never realized
  how many flowers there were in the city! In the daytime one cannot smell them
  so easily!"</p>

  <p>Gian Felice took Dionisia's hand as they stood together in their infinite
  loneliness in the middle of the empty piazza, ringed round by silent palaces,
  beneath the huge statue of the colossal figure, close beside the old man,
  asleep, with the broken <i>viol d'amore</i>; the peacocks shrilled faintly in
  the distance, protesting against the intensity of the stillness...</p>

  <p>"Are you still wishful to go into a convent?" he asked, inclining towards
  her, tenderly putting back her hood, expecting a radiancy of fairness.</p>

  <p>But she was masked; he lifted the lace of this from above her lips and
  kissed her; she kissed him in return, and yet the kiss fell somewhere between
  them, and was lost in the night as an unfolded blossom born in the darkness
  may fall from a high tree into a quick river and disappear, useless, no one
  ever knowing of its existence.</p>

  <p>She caught his hand and pulled him away from the statue and the beggar;
  even while he thought that she was still indulging a caprice, a whim, she had
  drawn him to the cold gates of the convent, close by the city wall, where the
  great bastions rise up on the slope of the hill. Before them was the open
  gate and the fig tree, its large unpruned leaves square-cut in the light,
  which was now beginning to flush with the opal tints of dawn.</p>

  <p>"I think no one has followed us, no one has observed us."</p>

  <p>He asked her if she would not take off her mask; she shook her head and
  ran into the convent garden. Under the fig tree he saw two waiting nuns come
  forward, enfold her, enclose her, and lead her into the cloister..."Wilt thou
  not come back to me, my lost delight!..."</p>

  <p>All the manifold trees of the city were stirring in the western breeze,
  the silver haze of the sky began to brighten with a warmer gold as Gian
  Felice returned to his palace&mdash;the immense black facade of which looked
  like a barrack, a prison, monstrous&mdash;a dwelling for giants.</p>

  <p>The young man entered by a secret door with a secret key. He went
  noiselessly down a long, quiet corridor and paused at an open door of a
  chamber where Nicolo Antonio Porpora his Virtuoso, had fallen asleep across
  the spinet. Gian Felice entered the chamber and, for the first time since he
  had left Engracia's house, took off his mask, revealing a face of notorious
  beauty, where the eyebrows slanting towards the nose had the air of wings,
  and the lips mocked even at what they offered.</p>

  <p>The old musician had drowsed into slumber across papers where scores had
  been crossed out, words underlined, words effaced..."<i>Rondo al Gran
  Duca</i>"&mdash;"<i>Serenata</i> for the Grand Duke"..."<i>Capriccio!</i>"
  "An amazing night! Why do we find it amazing?" "The fear of
  disillusion&mdash;the dread of completion."..."What we have never enjoyed we
  can never lose."..."Immortality lies in incompletion."..."All things incline
  towards their own end."...</p>

  <p>Such the senseless scrawlings the Virtuoso had put across his music; Gian
  Felice read them and smiled. This was his <i>Serenata</i>&mdash;broken and
  unfinished; he thought of the old man asleep beneath the great bronze
  statue&mdash;Would not that be the real <i>Serenata</i>&mdash;for ever
  mute?</p>

  <p>The Prince, smiling, woke the Virtuoso, who sprang up, startled and
  humiliated, adjusting his wig, clutching his papers.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Your Serene Highness will forgive, will excuse&mdash;I have done
  nothing, written nothing; the heat, the moonlight&mdash;I strove to capture
  an illusion, it was not easy; Your Serene Highness will pardon?"</p>

  <p>"I, too, have tried to capture an illusion," said the Grand Duke. "She did
  not know me, and I never saw her, and yet I think it was She&mdash;the
  dearest dear, the sweetest woman..."</p>

  <p>"It is an enigma," sighed the Virtuoso, not understanding in the
  least.</p>

  <p>"Therefore it can be put into melody," smiled the Grand Duke, "which is
  always an enigma&mdash;eh? You can have no definite statement in Melody, why,
  therefore, in Love?" Fingering the keyboard, he misquoted Dionisia: "What we
  have just missed is always ours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"An infinite regret is preferable to satiety," sighed Porpora, "and I can
  put none of these things into music. Your Serene Highness must get another
  Virtuoso...Scarlatti, perhaps, could have done it, or Jomelli?"</p>

  <p>"She was extraordinarily simple," mused the Grand Duke, "she thought that
  I read my letters, that she had saved my life&mdash;I wonder which was hers
  out of that heap this morning they brought in with the chocolate! Ah,
  Porpora, there is another day beginning, and you have not finished my
  <i>Serenata</i>."</p>

  <p>"I have slept, Serene Highness, I am refreshed, I will begin."</p>

  <p>"Think of my effigy," smiled the Grand Duke mockingly, "on the bronze
  horse, in that new statue on the Grand Piazza, and see me now&mdash;spent,
  fatigued, disappointed&mdash;and combine the two, if you can, in your
  <i>Rondo al Gran Duca</i>."</p>

  <p>"What was her name?" asked the Virtuoso.</p>

  <p>"Perdita, for she is lost&mdash;and she is of the sweetness that must be
  lost."</p>

  <p>"A moth flutters in out of the night. If you let it go the memory of it is
  yours; and, if you try to capture it, you have but a pinch of silver dust on
  your finger-tips."</p>

  <p>The Virtuoso's relaxed hands stumbled over the keys of the spinet in an
  endeavour to recapture some of the themes he had thought of for his
  Serenata...</p>

  <p>"If pins of gold and silver fell through her bronze-coloured hair and
  tinkled on the alabaster tiles..."</p>

  <p>"If it was so dark that you could not see her," interrupted the Grand
  Duke, "and you heard her rise from her bed, and heard her sigh, and if in
  that darkness your foot struck against the guitar and it gave out a jangle of
  music, and if you heard the gates of a cloister, the grille of the convent
  parlour closing behind her, if you knew she had seen and loved you, yet met
  you again and did not know you, and you had never glimpsed her
  face&mdash;there is your <i>Serenata</i>, Porpora!"</p>

  <p>He smiled sadly and pushed back the damp black curls from his forehead; he
  thought of the sleeping old man and the broken <i>viol d'amore</i> in the
  moonlit market-place beneath his own pompous statue; meanwhile he considered
  what a stupid tinkle Porpora was making on the spinet...</p>

  <p>"The man is old and knows nothing."</p>

  <p>While the Virtuoso, playing aimlessly, was reflecting: "The young man is a
  fool and his head is empty."</p>

  <p>The Grand Duke yawned, the music ceased at that signal of tedium, and the
  sun came up over Florence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03-5"
     id="ch-03-5"></a>A FANFARE FOR SILVER TRUMPETS</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Set for His Most Catholic Majesty King Philip of Spain
  on his arrival at Madrid.</i> [SPAIN, 18th Century.]</p>

  <p>Three young men came out on to the gilt gallery round the prow of the
  state galley; they found the prospect so charming and sumptuous that they had
  a great desire to take a draught of it; as they stared at the wide harbour
  and commanding citadel of Bordeaux, at the great crowd of decked French
  shipping, they first smiled and then giggled at each other, but furtively,
  for they had been very strictly brought up.</p>

  <p>The pale, azure grey of the winter morning was a discreet background for
  the Bourbon gesture of challenging splendour and pomp.</p>

  <p>The royal vessel on which the three young men (secretly impressed and
  outwardly stately) stood was towed by four barques painted blue interspersed
  with <i>fleur de luce</i> and golden crosses; each of these barques had a
  pilot and twenty-four oarsmen plying oars also blue, their gay habits were
  covered with silver lace; besides these there were other boats, one
  containing the numerous musicians, with their shining violins and haut-boys,
  who had played during the whole sea passage from Blaye; beyond came two small
  brigantines, each carrying six pieces of cannon which were continually firing
  and flying blue and silver flags.</p>

  <p>"They are replying to our cannon," remarked the elder youth who was the
  King: all three listened and heard volleys from the fort artillery and musket
  shots from the mansions and castles on each side of the river.</p>

  <p>The harbour behind the royal vessel was covered with shipping, so that one
  might have walked from shore to shore across the decks of a number of boats
  and sloops of all sorts. On many of these were being served, with the
  greatest diligence and nicety, an entertainment of fruits and other
  refreshments, which had been sent out by the magistrates of Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>The young King, smiling excitedly, surveyed this glittering scene. He then
  watched the two boats moving alongside the royal vessel, one containing the
  rich provisions and the servants who were to prepare them; the other laden
  with contrivances for keeping the dainty victuals hot. This breakfast was
  served with so much dexterity and everything was so delicate and savoury that
  the King was charmed with existence.</p>

  <p>"It is really, after all, very entertaining to be a great monarch," he
  sighed, with a slight air of relief.</p>

  <p>Educated very severely, entirely under the eye of, and following the will
  of, that great and redoubtable potentate, his grandfather, the King of
  France, he had rather dreaded this journey to a strange people and the
  wearing of this alien crown, hitherto borne by the greatest enemies of his
  own country; but all this was very agreeable; his two young brothers, the Duc
  de Berri and the Duc de Burgogne, agreed with him that to be the centre
  figure of such a gorgeous spectacle was no mean situation.</p>

  <p>"But you must remember," observed the Duc de Berri, who was shrewder than
  either of his brothers, "that we are yet in France, we know nothing of the
  conditions of Spain where you are to rule, Philippe."</p>

  <p>But the young King, whose elegant manners covered a complete ignorance of
  everything save the power of Rome and the might of the Bourbons, replied
  gaily:</p>

  <p>"Spain is the land of the Golden Fleece&mdash;everything is of precious
  metal and even, so I hear, the saucepans have diamonds in their handles!"</p>

  <p>And then the three youths laughed together in their excitement.</p>

  <p>So the royal ship arrived, preceded by splendid vessels and followed by a
  gorgeous display of three or four hundred shallops and boats laden with men,
  equipment, flags and trumpets. His Majesty and the Princes were again saluted
  by the discharge of cannon from the shipping, the forts and the batteries.
  There was a great concourse of people; nothing could have been louder than
  their shouts of welcome&mdash;louder even, Philippe thought, than the guns or
  the music.</p>

  <p>"Long live the King! Long live the King of Spain!"</p>

  <p>A violent fanfare of trumpets rent in the cold, pure air; the young man
  smiled with gratification as he stepped on to the wooden bridge lined with
  tapestry, where the magistrates of the town waited to receive him. This
  ingenious contrivance was set upon four wheels, one end was strongly attached
  to the royal ship, the other sloped towards the door of the royal coach.</p>

  <p>Above all this was a canopy of cloth of tissue with a fringe of lace and
  gold; this, when the King had passed beneath it, was immediately taken down
  and given to his Majesty's footmen, who divided it amongst themselves with
  suppressed quarrelling (so that it might not be used on a less august
  occasion).</p>

  <p>The King was conducted in the huge state coach to the Archbishop's palace;
  the swelling balconies, crowded with ladies, were adorned with floating
  tapestries, scarlet-hung scaffolds arranged along the streets were filled
  with cheering people, the roadways were all cleared, the shops shut, and the
  burghers under arms.</p>

  <p>The high gate of the King's lodging was set with crowns of laurel, the
  arms of France and Spain, and hung with silk Persian cloths.</p>

  <p>The magistrates of the town in robes of white satin and scarlet waited
  upon His Majesty. The three young French Princes began to feel slightly
  fatigued and squeamish, for the passage from Blaye to Bordeaux had been rough
  and they had been too excited to eat discreetly of the delicacies sent on
  board the ship.</p>

  <p>However, the King, who had early learnt the niceties of etiquette,
  received with an agreeable smile the presents offered him by the magistrates
  of Bordeaux&mdash;four great baskets, in one of which were three dozen of
  white wax flambeaux, in another two quintels of all sorts of curious comfits
  in different painted boxes, and two others full of all manner of native wine
  in gold-stoppered bottles. They also presented to the King and the two
  Princes two great baskets of oysters, covered with seaweed. Then there were
  speeches and compliments, receptions, listening to harangues, the replying to
  them, and the whole day passing in a whirligig of glory, excitement and pomp.
  All day long twenty-four pieces of cannon that were placed on the walls were
  answered by the artillery of the citadel, and, by the time the fireworks were
  beginning to rise into the darkening sky, the three young men felt slightly
  sick from the continuous noise, the amount of sweetmeats and glasses of wine
  that they had been forced, in a manner of compliment, to endure; but the
  King, at least, did not admit his own discomfort. He was determined to enjoy
  every moment of what he must consider the sumptuous prologue to a great and
  glorious reign.</p>

  <p>Philippe de Bourbon, Duc d'Anjou, a cadet of the great house of France,
  had suddenly, through a complication of politics, found himself on the throne
  of the Spanish Hapsburgs&mdash;a position for which he had never been trained
  and to which he had never aspired; slightly bewildered but definitely
  gratified by the beginning of his new glories, the young man resolved to be
  equal to all the lofty and heroic precepts with which his grandfather had
  regaled him since his accession to the throne of Spain.</p>

  <p>King Philippe was an amiable and elegant young man, who practised all the
  virtues he knew, and it was not his fault if these were but a few.</p>

  <p>His brothers told him that he had behaved very well during that exciting
  and bewildering day.</p>

  <p>It was really very splendid in the streets of Bordeaux&mdash;"Almost,"
  agreed the young Princes, "as splendid as in Paris, Marli, or
  Versailles."</p>

  <p>In the paved courtyard of the Archbishop's high palace there were four
  fountains running with wine which splashed the bare breasts of stone nymphs,
  and illuminations and bonfires throughout the whole town, so that the facades
  of the churches and mansions were stained a leaping red; then, of course,
  there was the public supper and afterwards a ball for His Majesty, while many
  of the magistrates kept open table at which anyone might get their glut of
  sweet wines and pastries.</p>

  <p>In purple and silver, powdered, perfumed and curled, His Majesty sat in
  the great hall in which, with so huge a press of people, the pages might
  scarce get round the tables with the meats.</p>

  <p>The young King on his chair with arms, on a dais and under a canopy, felt
  himself a little giddy from the murmurs of the crowd and the continual
  salutes of the cannon answering each other without, the whizz of the
  fireworks, the lustre of the gleaming chandeliers, the melody of the violins,
  and the walls lined with mirrors that gave back a thousand radiances, the
  vivid gold and azure of the decorations, the extremely rich and glorious
  dresses of his attendants&mdash;all so dazzling that it was like venturing to
  stare into the face of the sun to look round the hall.</p>

  <p>When he nervously glanced up he saw the inside of the pavilion above him
  hung throughout with crimson velvet edged with gold lace four fingers broad.
  Round the table was a great valance with a very deep fringe of knotted
  tinsel. There were twisted gilt banisters against the walls covered with
  velvet, with hangings weighted with gold fringe&mdash;everywhere he looked,
  gold, and an excess of splendour, the whole lighted with an infinite number
  of wax candles in Florentine copper sconces which, in their burning, gave out
  an acrid but voluptuous perfume. On the walls, too, of this great room were
  plaques and inscriptions, representing the glories of His Catholic Majesty
  and the arms of the several kingdoms which composed the Spanish monarchy.</p>

  <p>The heat melted the sugar on the marzipan models of heroes, a monkey was
  choked with a silvered almond, behind the curtains of Utrecht velvet the
  lackeys dipped spoons into the custards and the pages sucked their fingers
  soaked in caramel; huge pineapples on filigree dishes overtopped goblets
  formed of ostrich eggs, and on the arras above the door a wreath of gigantic
  flowers surrounded a buskined huntress who pursued, in eternal chase, a
  pearl-coloured hart.</p>

  <p>"I am a great King," murmured the dazed young man to himself, "I am the
  King of Spain and I know not what besides. It is truly a remarkable
  experience."</p>

  <p>Then, in a little pause from the trumpets and kettledrums, one made him a
  speech; Philippe did not know by this time who spoke to him, but he
  mechanically leant forward and smiled in that amiable fashion which was
  already making him popular.</p>

  <p>What was this pompous fellow, with his feathered hat in a fat hand and his
  trailing crimson robe and gold chain, saying?</p>

  <p>The young King, with dutiful gratitude, strained his ears to listen.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty has just entered the first years of your youth, yet the fame
  of your virtues has penetrated to the extremest parts of the world. The exact
  integrity, that love of justice, that heroic humanity, that moderation, that
  advanced prudence, that sincerity, that inviolable fidelity which have gained
  the admiration of every one about you, have made your name adored in the most
  distant countries. A hundred different nations that compose one only&mdash;an
  immense Empire&mdash;What said I?...The <i>entire world</i> comes to the feet
  of your august Majesty's throne."</p>

  <p>"He means me," thought the young King.</p>

  <p>A slight blush crept into his cheek, not at the flattery of the pompous
  fellow at the foot of his throne, but at the faint smile which he fancied he
  had seen pass across the face of one of his governors&mdash;the old Duc de
  Noailles. Of course, if it had been a smile, it could not have been an ironic
  one; everybody declared him a great King.</p>

  <p>The speaker, bowing lower, continued:</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty is the greatest and most magnificent object that God has
  placed in the universe."</p>

  <p>Philippe looked round the crowded room. He heard this sentiment generously
  applauded. He glanced at his brothers and saw no dissent in their candid
  eyes; all seemed to admire and acclaim him a mighty monarch.</p>

  <p>It was rather difficult for him to conceive how he could be so great,
  since he could remember doing nothing save living exactly as his grandfather
  and the priests had directed him. But there it was.</p>

  <p>There was a great deal more in the same style, but the young King, who was
  then convinced of his invincible greatness, found it unnecessary to listen.
  His giddiness and sense of sickness passed and he felt instead a buoyant
  exhilaration, an unnatural exultation he could not remember experiencing
  before, and he glanced with a lively interest past the bowed head of the
  speaker and round the heated faces of those crowding about the sumptuous
  overloaded table. He had, perhaps, drunk a little more of the potent wine of
  Bordeaux than he was aware of, or, the perpetual insidious strains of
  flattery had really turned his amiable head; for he began to believe that he
  was almost Jove himself, wielding a handful of lightning, seated on the
  highest peak of the heavens, and commanding a galaxy of gods and
  goddesses.</p>

  <p>Precisely at this moment, when his head seemed to be in gilded clouds and
  his feet on a world composed of an immense circle of lapis lazuli studded
  with diamonds, a curious adventure befell the young King of Spain.</p>

  <p>Among the many countenances there, all eagerly and slavishly turned
  towards him, he suddenly beheld one face only&mdash;a face that seemed so
  detached from the others that all in that proud, magnificent chamber seemed
  but a background; a young girl, one of the public admitted to this costly
  banquet, had contrived to come quite close to the throne, had slipped between
  the King's governors and guards and stood at the corner of the dais looking
  directly at his youthful Majesty. Gazing at her the young man forgot his
  recent godlike pose, forgot even that he was master of sixty-three kingdoms,
  that Holy Masses never ceased in his dominions, that the sun never deprived
  them of life, and that he had a right to command all strange nations...</p>

  <p>All this preamble vanished from his mind and he stared directly at the
  young girl as a youth might stare at a maiden met by chance in the confused
  gaiety of a country fair.</p>

  <p>She returned his glance without shame and her gaze seemed to pierce beyond
  the formal hollow flatteries of the moment, and to pay him a tribute beside
  which all these other homages were but brittle indeed.</p>

  <p>She was about eighteen years of age, of a majestic, lively countenance,
  and very neatly dressed. Her long, closely-curling locks of a saffron yellow
  were her chief ornament, about her slender rounded waist was a little girdle,
  as if she were seldom far from domestic duties, but her hands were as fine as
  those of the ladies of Versailles who bathed continually in milk and essence
  of lilies; he could not have described her, but he found in her something
  charming which distinguished her from all others of her sex. He heard no
  words further of the magistrates' address, but, with his plumed hat on his
  knee and leaning forward a little from his high seat, he gazed at the
  maiden.</p>

  <p>On a side table near the King's throne were lilac china baskets full of
  sweetmeats, Persian rose-leaves and Italian violet petals preserved in dyed
  sugar.</p>

  <p>The girl wore a little silvered apron of Dresden silk, and, in the slight
  confusion into which she fell under the King's gaze, she had caught up the
  ends of this trifle to her bosom. The young man leant forward and without any
  further ceremony took the dish of sweetmeats and turned the comfits into her
  apron.</p>

  <p>With modest blushes she received his present and retired into the crowd,
  the young King smiling on her and signifying by many tender glances the
  impression she had made upon his heart.</p>

  <p>When she had withdrawn and the feast had come to an end the King asked his
  two brothers if they knew who the damsel was, and they replied she might be a
  lady of good quality, as there were many such among the press, but that she
  was no person of any distinction.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand," smiled the Duc de Berri, "why you, Philippe, are
  the least interested in this young person who seems to me of the most
  ordinary description."</p>

  <p>But the King thoughtfully replied that this maiden was the only object he
  had ever seen in all his life who had moved him to the extraordinary emotion
  he now felt.</p>

  <p>The Princes smiled and yawned; they were both drowsy and excited.</p>

  <p>The King retired to the Archbishop's closet and, calling up a page who had
  stood near his throne, bade him inform himself of the name and abode of the
  lady to whom he had given the sweetmeats. At the same moment, feeling
  inspired, the young King wrote a note on gilt-edged paper perfumed with
  orris-root.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Love reigns in the heart of kings as well as in those of
  their subjects, and the greatest monarch in the world glories in their
  submission to his empire. You may think it strange, my dear, that I am
  affected by the charm of your person, but I beg of you one hour's interview
  wherein I may show you the excess of my affection."</p>

  <p>This he signed with a flourish and in Spanish fashion&mdash;"<i>Félipe, Yo
  el Rey.</i>"</p>

  <p>At the same moment he drew from his finger a very pure diamond, which had
  been his grandfather's last present to him; he gave this to the page and sent
  it with the note to the lady. In an hour the answer arrived, and the King had
  so far contrived to detach himself from the ceremony of the evening as to be
  able to receive it privately.</p>

  <p class="letter">"GREAT KING,<br>
  <br>
  "I assure you that if love reigns over the hearts of kings, constancy, virtue
  and fidelity reign also among women as well as among queens. I thank you for
  the billet you have been pleased to give yourself the trouble of writing.
  Perhaps, great Prince, if I had been blest with the blood of queens you would
  not have noticed me. I cannot answer you but with sighs and regrets;
  nevertheless, sir, I would keep your fine diamond as a token of the precious
  regard with which it has pleased so great a monarch to honour me; though what
  I have to say to you cannot be what you expect, I am prepared to grant you
  immediately the interview you do me the honour to desire."</p>

  <p>But here the young King felt himself at a loss.</p>

  <p>He was very much under the observation and still felt under the dominion
  of his ancient governors, the Duc de Noailles, the Duc de Beauvilliers, the
  Marquis de Seignelai and the Marquis de Razilli. It was difficult for him to
  believe that though he was now undoubtedly a great king he could really do
  what he liked in his own time.</p>

  <p>"We are leaving Bordeaux to-morrow," he sighed.</p>

  <p>"But the lady has made an appointment for to-night, sire, and she lives
  not very far from this palace, in a little side street which has the
  prettiest garden in the world and where, even now in the winter, the laurels
  are quite glossy, and I smelt the perfume of Roman hyacinths coming from the
  glass-houses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how," said the King, "shall I get there? How contrive to escape the
  scrutiny of my guardians and gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>The page had led a much freer existence than the King and had a great deal
  more experience. He pitied his sovereign, who had been deprived of most of
  the pleasures of life, and pointed out to him that it would be easy to
  pretend to retire to bed, being fatigued and overborne by the day, and then
  to rise and creep out to the <i>rendezvous</i>.</p>

  <p>"She is, sire, a Mademoiselle de Sourdis, daughter of one of the gentlemen
  of the town, of no particular beauty or pretensions; but, since she has taken
  the fancy of Your Majesty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The King interrupted:</p>

  <p>"This is more than fantasy, this is fate."</p>

  <p>The page smiled respectfully, he thought the words meant the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>So the King, with the help of the young Gascon, managed to excuse himself
  from all the formalities of the pageant and retired at last into his great
  bedchamber, which glittered on all sides with mirrors and lustres, and was
  hung with a hundred pompous mottoes and arms proclaiming Philippe V, after
  the King of France, the greatest king in the world.</p>

  <p>When the last violins and kettledrums were silenced, the last fireworks
  spent, when, finally, the candelabra and wax-lights were extinguished in the
  banqueting hall, the tired serving-men asleep among the débris of the feast,
  when even the lap dogs had ceased yapping and the crimson parrots no longer
  screamed with excitement in their twisted cages, then the young King, wrapped
  in a dark velvet mantle, with a travelling mask on his face, a black peruke
  (stolen by the page from the toilet of one of his gentlemen) over his own
  blonde hair, crept down the cool marble stairs of the Archbishop's palace
  into the cold moonlit street of Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>The young King discovered true beauty in this silver dark, this lovely
  night sky, these clear, mournful shadows, in the blank facades of the houses,
  and in the cold alien wind. His mind was cleared of all the gilded confusion
  of the gorgeous day; if he could no longer credit that he was a great King he
  at least was tolerably certain that he was a young man engaged upon a
  pleasant adventure.</p>

  <p>The page went with him as far as the door of Mademoiselle de Sourdis'
  house.</p>

  <p>On a thrice-repeated rap the lady herself admitted him and, taking him
  lightly by the hand, drew him into a small chamber which was more modest,
  humble and sweet than any chamber he had ever beheld. It seemed to him like a
  dolls' house for neatness, smallness, and prettiness. There was one little
  crystal lamp, which gave a light of singular purity, a fine, small fire on
  the hearth which glowed with a peculiar clarity, and the girl was dressed as
  he had observed her at the banquet, in a housewife's neat attire, with her
  keys at her waist. On the little tulip-wood table were his gift of sweetmeats
  and his offering of the diamond. She put both her hands in his when he had
  taken off his mantle and periwig, and looked at him earnestly.</p>

  <p>This, and not the triumph of his progress, was faeryland to the King. He
  said:</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, you have opened a little door for me on to something that I
  did not know existed."</p>

  <p>He had not meant to say that, for he had many pretty set-pieces ready; but
  her earnest look had extorted from him an expression of the truth.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur, that is exactly what I wished to do&mdash;open a little door
  for you."</p>

  <p>"My dear, this is most extraordinary, that we should meet like this, speak
  like this. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"To me it is the most natural thing in the world. Do not you, sir, know
  the moment when it arrived?"</p>

  <p>They sat together between the clear little fire and the bright little
  lamp. He could not remember ever feeling so safe or so familiar with anyone.
  He knew she would neither rebuke him, command him, nor fawn upon him, and
  this was rare indeed for the King of Spain to feel so at ease and so
  confident. For he was a man who had always been bidden and over-ruled, and he
  did not as yet know himself.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle, why did you look at me like that at the banquet
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>She answered on a beautiful note of compassion:</p>

  <p>"Because, sir, I so pitied you, I was so deeply grieved for you."</p>

  <p>"You pitied me&mdash;and I am the King! What do you mean&mdash;you pitied
  me?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Ah, you <i>were</i> the King, sir, but now you are not."</p>

  <p>"It is true," he replied gravely, "that I no longer feel master of
  sixty-three kingdoms, or Jove with his lightning, or&mdash;What was it that
  fellow said? The grandest object in the whole of the world.' But I feel as if
  I were something better than all that, and that is possibly the man you
  favour, for I am most extraordinarily enchanted by you."</p>

  <p>"And I have never liked one better," she admitted. "We have, of course,
  been waiting for each other a great while. But, perhaps, we shall lose one
  another after all. You have not the courage, sir, to escape&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To escape!" repeated the young man, and the word fell with a fearful
  sound on his ear.</p>

  <p>She looked at him most tenderly and the tears came into her kind hazel
  eyes. She had a beauty in her simplicity beyond any beauty which he had
  hitherto guessed at; to him she was the clue to the cypher which holds the
  secret of the world.</p>

  <p>"Do not you see," she added earnestly, "that they make a fool of you? You
  are no more than their poor puppet, and, once you are in Spain, it will be as
  if you were in prison."</p>

  <p>He laughed indulgently.</p>

  <p>"These matters are beyond your feminine understanding. Let us discourse of
  what is within your comprehension, dear." And he made an eager movement to
  take her in his arms.</p>

  <p>She put him by without ado.</p>

  <p>"Did you not read my billet, sir, that I have something extraordinary to
  tell you? Well this is it, that you have with me a chance to escape. This is
  not a mere amorous interview. I believe I really love you, and I think that
  you really love me&mdash;yes, even after these few minutes...it is quite as
  extraordinary as that, you know&mdash;real love. And I thought that we might
  escape together."</p>

  <p>King Philippe no longer laughed.</p>

  <p>"Proceed. How could I escape with you?"</p>

  <p>"If you never returned to the Archbishop's palace, and you and I went away
  together&mdash;I know where we could go&mdash;to a little farm where you
  might earn your living, dressing the vines and tilling the ground, and they
  would never think of looking for you there. I daresay we should be, as far as
  this world goes, extremely happy."</p>

  <p>This was so amazing to the young man that he cast about in his mind for an
  explanation and fell on two of the crudest possible.</p>

  <p>"You are bewitched or lunatic," he sighed regretfully and tenderly. "We
  cannot possibly understand each other, we are so differently placed."</p>

  <p>"We are human beings, sir, and surely there should be something in common
  between us. We are young and man and woman, and surely it is not so strange
  if we should love one another."</p>

  <p>"I came here to love you," replied the King simply.</p>

  <p>"But not to escape with me, sir?"</p>

  <p>"To escape with you! That is beyond all measure fantastical!"</p>

  <p>"Love itself," said the girl, laying her hand lightly over her heart, "is
  beyond all measure fantastical, and that passion which calls itself love, if
  well-regulated, sober and logical, masquerades under a false name."</p>

  <p>The young man flushed.</p>

  <p>"No king ever had such a suggestion made to him."</p>

  <p>"No king, perhaps, had so fortunate a chance," replied Mademoiselle de
  Sourdis. "Do you know Spain&mdash;do you know what is before you?"</p>

  <p>"I know very well."</p>

  <p>She insisted: "I am giving you the best of good advice, I am giving you a
  warning. Do not go on with them. Come with me&mdash;I offer life&mdash;and
  they? Death."</p>

  <p>The King of Spain drew closer to the small clear fire, for he felt himself
  shivering. He could not believe that this maiden was of mortal flesh, but
  credited that she might be some celestial messenger, so composed and
  resolute, yet so tender and gentle she stood before him and put forward her
  plea; she spoke so ardently with the tears overbrimming her sweet eyes and
  running down her unprotected cheek. She was as one who pleads for more than
  mortal good and offers more than mortal bliss. He had come to find an
  entrancing, but a light and passing love, and had found himself entangled in
  something so vast and deep that he was both bewildered and exalted.</p>

  <p>"You will come with me?" she urged, and knelt beside the chair whereon he
  sat shivering over the fire.</p>

  <p>He, not looking at her, repeated his lesson: "I am the King of Spain,
  master of sixty-three countries, the grandest object on the face of the
  earth...What else? I have forgotten all they said. Of course, I am a great
  monarch."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" she said, "some day you will know differently."</p>

  <p>Without a blare of trumpets saluted the first colour of the dawn.</p>

  <p>The King got to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Hark!" he said proudly. "Fanfare for the King of Spain!"</p>

  <p>Still kneeling at his feet, she answered:</p>

  <p>"Some day you will hear it differently."</p>

  <p>Her raised her up and kissed her hand; she was so encompassed with regret
  he felt for her no more passion.</p>

  <p>"I will go back and think this was a dream," he said, sighing.</p>

  <p>"A dream that you," she sighed also, "may sometimes for your pain
  remember."</p>

  <p>And into his pocket she put his sweetmeats and his diamond.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?" he said, without hope. "My dear, I will take you
  to Madrid&mdash;I will set you up in a palace, instead of you taking me to a
  cottage amid vineyards I will put you in a vast castle among the finest
  gardens in the world."</p>

  <p>She gently shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then we must part, and I am sorry, sir, for I shall not be able to
  forget."</p>

  <p>The King turned away. He put on his black peruke, his dark-coloured
  mantle, and closed the door on this strange adventure.</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle de Sourdis remained in her humble, neat room, put out the
  lamp and raked over the fire, so that there was no longer light or warmth in
  her charming chamber.</p>

  <p>When the King woke on the morrow he complained to his brothers of heavy
  dreams, and when the royal cavalcade left Bordeaux the King looked from the
  window of his coach of green leather at the blank facade of the little house
  in which he had passed last night that curious half hour.</p>

  <p>From Bordeaux the King went to Bayonne, where His Majesty and the two
  Princes stayed two days, where they were received with all the magnificence
  and honour worthy of their great dignity, and thence they went to the Isle of
  Bidasso, where the great Treaty of the Pyrenees had been signed, and there
  the King must bid adieu to the two Princes, his brothers, and all his French
  gentlemen, and embark on a small ship from a canopied gangway built and
  adorned like the royal structure at Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>At the ship's side he bade adieu to all his countrymen, accompanied by
  their mutual blessings and murmurs of regret. The Duc de Noailles must hand
  over His Majesty to the Duque de Harcourt that he be conducted to the Duque
  d'Alba and the Duque d'Ajen; the vessel was then towed by four shallops,
  which passed between the densely crowded strands of the French and Spanish
  territories. The air was filled with shouts and acclamations of joy. The King
  looked backwards with homesick longing at the lines of the French coast. Even
  his governors&mdash;the Duc de Noailles and the Duc de Beauvilliers&mdash;he
  regretted in that moment; and, as he presently stepped on to Spanish soil, he
  could not venture to think of Mademoiselle de Sourdis.</p>

  <p>Of all his French gentlemen none was left him but the Gascon page; he,
  like the King, had been bred at Versailles, where everything was in
  abundance, and thought when he entered Spain he was going to the conquest of
  the Golden Fleece, that he would be received with unparalleled magnificence,
  with the daintiest dishes and the most delicious wines, but found instead he
  had come into a country as poor as it was proud, where the people were
  satisfied with an onion, or a clove garlick to flavour their diet; found they
  must bring their own beds to the inn, that they must make use of mules
  instead of horses, and that their servants must sleep on the cloak bags on
  the road. So great were the inconveniences and poverty of His Majesty's
  progress that the young page remarked that it put him in mind of the caravans
  that traverse the deserts of Arabia, for there were no refreshments to be had
  save what they carried with them.</p>

  <p>The King kept up his spirits and remembered the directions of his
  grandfather. On his landing, he was encouraged to see the people run on all
  sides to see him; they lined the road throughout the country and fell upon
  their knees even in the dirtiest places as if God Himself had passed by.</p>

  <p>The King, leaning from his coach window, threw among them handfuls of
  money, provided by King Louis, to receive in return their empty blessings as
  they scrambled for the <i>louis d' ors</i> among the dust.</p>

  <p>It was cold and the wind high. The Spanish grandees were all silent and
  gloomy; they had with them a great number of priests, who insisted on the
  King attending to his devotions in public and private every day, and so the
  progress continued to Madrid. There he must alight from his coach to make his
  devotions in many churches, and then must go to the Palace of <i>Buen
  Riposo</i>, where the Captain of the Castle came to meet His Majesty in the
  garden of the Brazen Horse and presented him with the keys of the apartments,
  of the churches, of the dungeons.</p>

  <p>The days passed in pompous addresses and flattering harangues&mdash;all,
  like the Spaniards, haughty, grave and serious; no one smiled or jested and
  the Mass bell scarcely ceased.</p>

  <p>Palace and garden were grey and the clouds were low and blackish. The
  King, seeing no friend and no Frenchmen beyond the page about him, felt
  serious and grave also; his head ached and he ate little.</p>

  <p>The grandees and the priests were continually instructing him.</p>

  <p>"Sire, you must do this and that. Sire, this is the custom in Spain. Sire,
  it is so with the Kings of Spain. Sire, so you must be dressed, so you must
  behave, so you shall live, be wedded, die and be buried."</p>

  <p>These great palaces of Spain were churches and cemeteries as well as
  habitations; he found that he walked continually above graves.</p>

  <p>In the long, mournful, dark galleries, hung with tapestries of indigo,
  green, and blackish blue, were portraits of his predecessors, the Kings of
  Spain&mdash;Félipe and Carlos...one after another. This King of Spain died
  mad&mdash;and this, and this. The long, pale faces seemed to gibber at him
  from to canvasses; he detected in them a likeness to his own and hurried
  away.</p>

  <p>The harangues and the compliments were over; life became infinitely
  monotonous, the days extraordinarily long. How weary it was! Though every one
  was stiff, it seemed as if they wished to loll and yawn; the black hangings
  were still in place for the late King.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" said Philippe. "How shall I divert myself? These grey
  days are intolerable."</p>

  <p>"There are Your Majesty's devotions," said Cardinal Portocarreo
  reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"And when I am finished with my devotions?"</p>

  <p>"There are various amusements for a King of Spain&mdash;sometimes there is
  an <i>auto da fé</i>, when we burn the heretics in the public square of
  Madrid. Then Your Majesty may hunt with the grandees and, for the rest, His
  late Majesty amused himself with spillikins."</p>

  <p>The King looked at himself in many mirrors. He walked alone down gigantic
  corridors, scaled immense staircases; the paintings of emaciated saints, the
  tortured limbs of martyrs, glowed white and ghastly from the black canvasses
  on the high walls.</p>

  <p>Priests, dark-cowled, sombre, muttered before altars that glittered with
  wavering scarlet and yellow lights. He had to attend the masses said before
  the tombs of his predecessors, and mark the epitaphs which noted how they had
  died&mdash;many young and all mad.</p>

  <p>Yet His Majesty kept up his spirits, smiled, conversed, laughed after the
  manner of Versailles; but the grandees and the Cardinal told him the King of
  Spain should be more sedate in his deportment...they also informed him there
  was no money for ballets, masquerades, or even a French cook.</p>

  <p>"I shall become used to this," he said to himself, "I shall soon discover
  how delightful it is to be a great King."</p>

  <p>The French page reported that he had discovered a diversion for His
  Majesty.</p>

  <p>A certain Spaniard had made a pleasant conceit for the King and desired to
  be admitted to His Majesty's presence to have the honour of showing him the
  strangest spectacle in the world.</p>

  <p>"This, sire," said the page, "is really amusing."</p>

  <p>"If he is amusing," said Philippe, "admit him at once."</p>

  <p>So this person was borne before the King in the garden of the Brazen
  Horse; the wind moaned in high trees, the fountains were dry, the dovecotes
  empty.</p>

  <p>The adventurer was carried on a chair, according to the mode of Paris.
  Before and behind the chair was fixed a pole having at one end a flag with a
  queer device of a dancer, and at the other a packet of poison which was
  labelled "Death." This fellow leapt from the chair and made an obeisance to
  the King. His coat was of all colours, like that of Arlequino, and hung about
  him in fantastic rags. His eyes were squinting and lively, his hair reddish,
  his features keen. He was large and stout, an extraordinary mimic, and very
  facetious, laughing at every word he spoke, and the King was delighted with
  him because he reminded him of France.</p>

  <p>The King shivered in the garden and clenched his hands in his muff; he
  felt the damp ground through the thin soles of his shoes with the monstrous
  rosettes.</p>

  <p>The Brazen Horse curvetted, gigantic, into the grey air; implacable
  appeared this animal of metal as if he trampled on all the shuddering
  aspirations of humanity.</p>

  <p>Seeing His Majesty, surrounded by several grandees, standing under a
  pepper tree which as yet bore no leaves, the adventurer made several comical
  bows.</p>

  <p>The King, diverted, asked him his business and the adventurer made his
  compliments to the King.</p>

  <p>"Sire, I am come to present to Your Majesty a new wonder, unknown to the
  world till this day. Admire, sire, the marvel, the most famous of all shows,
  and remember, sire, that Your Majesty, though the greatest of Kings, has
  never seen anything so surprising."</p>

  <p>After this address he took a cage from one of his porters; confined in it
  was a large rat.</p>

  <p>The adventurer received this dainty beast in his hand and exposed it to
  view, and the King looked at it keenly.</p>

  <p>The creature had had its tail cut off, so had lost the greater part of its
  ugliness; its ears had been pierced, and in them hung pendants of small
  pearls; it had a necklace adorned with ribbons of various colours. Fastened
  between its ears was a tiny peruke of a fair colour.</p>

  <p>The adventurer now bade the porter stretch a cord from a small portable
  table that he had brought with him, to the chair in which he had been carried
  to the garden of the Brazen Horse, and on this he placed the rat, producing
  with a flourish his flageolet from his pocket; he bade His Majesty observe
  the great wonder he had just announced, and so began to play the flageolet,
  upon which the rat daintily raised itself on its hind legs and began to dance
  with much exactness upon the cord.</p>

  <p>This greatly amused and charmed the ruler of Spain.</p>

  <p>"Why," exclaimed the King, "surely it is known that these creatures are
  very fearful and put to flight at the least noise?"</p>

  <p>"Yet, observe, sire," said the adventurer, who had caught this remark,
  "that I have made him so tame and familiar that no ape will caper on the rope
  with more boldness and assurance."</p>

  <p>Then, playing again, he caused the rat to perform a succession of Spanish
  dances with the greatest precision and composure, the pearl pendants dangling
  in his ears, the ribbons fluttering from his necklace, and the fair peruke
  floating over his head.</p>

  <p>The King and the page laughed, the Spanish grandees smiled; as the day
  darkened down the Brazen Horse appeared more monstrous in the twilight.</p>

  <p>The performance over, the King would have rewarded the adventurer with
  fifty pistoles. The fellow refused, putting the rat back into his cage, and
  took his departure from the garden of the Brazen Horse, as he went playing
  softly upon his flageolet the little prologue for the rat's dance, which all
  that day rang in His Majesty's ears, so that he could eat no supper nor take
  any interest in his devotions, or the talk of politics with the Cardinal and
  his ministers.</p>

  <p>When he was alone in his bedchamber that night he awoke and thought of
  Mademoiselle de Sourdis; such a supernatural terror possessed him that he
  rose from his high-canopied bed, crept softly among his sleeping gentlemen,
  and so came into an antechamber; the moonlight was full in this vast room and
  showed a hundred menacing figures from portraits, from tapestries, and from
  statues; they all appeared to grin and threaten the King of Spain.</p>

  <p>He thought: "What did I see to-day, and who was the man in the
  many-coloured coat?"</p>

  <p>As if forced by an invisible presence he turned and looked at himself in a
  gigantic mirror, where the moonlight lurked like an enemy, chill and bold.
  His fair hair hung crimped upon his shoulders, his bed-gown was tied with
  lace and ribbons at the neck, after the Spanish fashion he had been forced to
  wear a pearl in his right ear; his features were fine and small.</p>

  <p>"Where had he seen such a figure before?"</p>

  <p>The lady had offered him a chance to escape, he had not taken it; he had
  gone away.</p>

  <p>He continued to stare into the mirror where the moonlight made the
  reflection of the room appear even more gigantic and dreadful than it was in
  sombre reality; and stared, lonely, until the dawn light replaced the
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>"They cut off its tail, pierced its ears, adorned it, trained it to dance
  upon a rope, and, when it had satisfied them by this performance, they took
  it and put it back into a small cage in which it could scarcely move; without
  hope, its small eyes twinkled through the bars..."</p>

  <p>The King put his fingers to his quivering lips. He saw in the mirror not
  himself, the great monarch, the master of sixty-three kingdoms, but the
  dancing rat, adorned for the gratification of its master.</p>

  <p>"So, Your Majesty! Thus, Your Majesty! It is the custom of the Kings of
  Spain&mdash;Your Majesty will advance three steps&mdash;Your Majesty will
  bow&mdash;Your Majesty will put your hat on your knee&mdash;Your Majesty will
  return your hat to your head&mdash;Your Majesty will attend so many masses,
  listen to so many sermons, go so many times to confession..."</p>

  <p>The King drew back from the mirror. On the table was an open
  miniature-case; the portrait showed a gaunt, frightened, plain girl of
  thirteen, whom all the painter's art had not been able to make
  beautiful&mdash;Marie Luise Gabrielle de Savoie, his future queen, the
  priests' choice&mdash;in all the opposite of the girl at Bordeaux, who had
  spoken to him as no woman would dare to speak again.</p>

  <p>What would the rat be doing now? Peering through the bars of its
  cage&mdash;waiting, without hope, for the day and the signal to come out and
  dance upon the rope?</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle de Sourdis had warned him; she had said, "Some day you will
  know."</p>

  <p>Trapped.</p>

  <p>The early trumpets sounded through the silent palace. His Majesty must
  rise for early devotions, according to custom...</p>

  <p>Fanfare for the King of Spain.</p>

  <p>But, to His shuddering Majesty, not daring to look into the mirror, the
  sound was exactly the same as the prologue on the adventurer's flageolet
  which had heralded the dance of the rat.</p>

  <h3>SCENE. <i>A baroque chamber.</i></h3>

  <p class="intro"><i>Window C. back curtained; light given by girandoles of
  candles. Door L. and entrance obscure in the shadows R. Near window a sofa,
  centre of stage a table and two chairs. By wall an old chest. As curtain
  rises enter MEZZETIN, one of the innumerable clowns of the Comedia Italiana.
  He wears brocade doublet and breeches, a loose cap of the same material, a
  circular cape which hangs below his hands, a large falling ruf and huge
  coloured spectacles. He cuts a caper in a self-absorbed manner and is closely
  followed by the Two TRAVELLERS. The first is young, elegant, in a rich
  travelling costume; the second is elderly and wears the garb of a clergyman
  of the Church of England of this period; while the first traveller appears
  delighted with everything, the second is in a very ill humour.</i></p>
  <hr>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Turning and bowing to the travellers.</i>] Here,
  Signori, you may take your entertainment. There is a. view over the river and
  presently there will be a moon. There will also be violins. Perhaps something
  else&mdash;an adventure&mdash;a surprise!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Delightful! What a charming apartment!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Moonlight! Violins! But what of a supper and a bed?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Ah, Signor, that comes afterwards.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Does it, indeed? But I, sir, have travelled twenty miles
  to-day in a vile coach, over a viler road; my bones are sore, my throat dry,
  my stomach empty.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Sir, this is not an inn!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] So I perceive, I wish it were. [<i>To
  MEZZETIN.</i>] What is this place?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>With a caper.</i>] We call it the Villa
  Malcontenta.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Discontented House! And a very good name, too, I'm sure.
  [<i>Looking closely at MEZZETIN, speaking to FIRST T.</i>] And now I see our
  guide in the clear light he is confoundedly queer-looking. A disreputable
  fellow, my lord, I dare swear. And I think it were better to pass the night
  in the coach on the roadside.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Taking of hat, mantle, etc.</i>] It is all charming,
  and I intend to stay. [<i>To MEZZETIN.</i>] What is your name?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Mezzetin.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I thought as much. The outlandish creature is not even a
  Christian.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> What is a Christian?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Sir, my cloth is insulted! I refuse to stay. I dislike
  the place, I dislike this mountebank!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> On the contrary, my good doctor, I am enchanted with
  everything.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To SECOND T.</i>] If you will have a little patience,
  perhaps I shall be able to enchant you, too.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> None of your impudence, sir. I am a clergyman of the
  Church of England; this is an English nobleman of whom I am in charge,
  sir&mdash;in charge&mdash;morals, conduct, health and purse in my charge,
  sir.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Confound it, doctor, if you are bear-leading me you need
  not rattle the chain. [<i>To MEZZETIN.</i>] Sir, you must think us uncommonly
  uncivil. You find us stranded on the road at midnight and you offer us
  hospitality, for which we have not yet thanked you.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Do not do so, Signor, till the adventure is ended.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Sir, I do not intend the adventure to begin; perhaps
  those miserable postillions have mended the coach.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> No, they are all comfortably asleep on the roadside.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Then what of our baggage exposed in this thievish
  country?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Never heed it&mdash;let us say good-bye to common sense
  for this one night, doctor.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Common sense has never yet been in your company, my lord,
  so no need to say good-bye to it, since we began travelling in Italy it has
  been nothing but folly after folly.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> What did you come to seek&mdash;in Italy?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Polish, sir, instruction, ruins, the classics,
  antiquities, cabinets of curiosities&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I'm heaving sick at the mention of 'em,</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> I saw a girl to-day in a coach.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Skipping up to him.</i>] Ah, I perceive you have kept
  your eyes open, at least&mdash;now I can tell you&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Indignantly drawing him away.</i>] I'll not have it.
  [<i>To MEZZETIN.</i>] I've had enough trouble without you, sir. Quite enough
  of girls in coaches, or on balconies, or in gondolas&mdash;and His Grace's
  instructions are <i>most</i> explicit.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Aha! [<i>Pokes SECOND T. in the ribs.</i>] Oho!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Furious.</i>] You're crazy, sir. This is a terrible
  country. In England you'd be shut up, sir, shut up, I repeat. His Grace
  said&mdash;' My dear Dr. Prose, I insist on no entanglements between my on
  and any of the frail sex.'</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> I suppose his hands are full of his own affairs of that
  nature? Anyhow, I regard his remark as a mere formality.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I never regarded it at all.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Bravo! Now will you repose yourself and wait for the moon
  to rise?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Willingly. [<i>Throws himself on sofa.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I refuse, sir, definitely, to wait for any moon. [<i>To
  FIRST T.</i>] My lord, I must insist&mdash;I must use my full authority. I am
  responsible for your safety. I mistrust this place, we may be murdered before
  the morning&mdash;or dead of hunger and fatigue.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Neither the one nor the other, I dare promise you,
  Signor. As for your authority, here you have none. This is the Villa
  Malcontenta and I am Mezzetin.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> You're an impudent rogue, and I'll have the whole affair
  reported to His Majesty's Resident in Venice&mdash;His Britannic Majesty,
  sir!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Who is His Britannic Majesty? But I know who you are!
  Panteleone, eh? The dry old pedant&mdash;you have lost your beard which made
  you look like a goat. But you still have that expression of mingled malice
  and stupidity which is so amusing.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Furious.</i>] Sir, I am Theodosius Marryatt Prose,
  D.D.!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> You must think of a better joke than that, you know,
  Panteleone&mdash;people begin to get tired of your squeaky voice and your
  eternal hostility to youth and beauty. Everyone makes fun of you and laughs
  at you behind your back. You are so old and so silly.</p>

  <p>[<i>FIRST T. laughs from sofa.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>With dignity.</i>] My lord, I regret that the care I
  took in your education has resulted in failure&mdash;no well-bred gentleman
  would have laughed at such a vulgar tirade.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Dear doctor, I regret my indiscretion. But I am resolved
  to spend the night here. Who knows what my happen? After all, this tour is my
  last chance of the romantic and absurd. When I return to England I shall
  marry an heiress, drink port, sleep through your sermons, and so decorously
  proceed, led by gout and apoplexy, to the family mausoleum. As for Mezzetin,
  you must not regard him&mdash;we have entered a world of phantasy, let us
  play our parts with spirit.<br>
  [<i>He rises; SECOND T. sinks, fuming, into chair by table.</i>] Mezzetin,
  who am I? What am I?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Studying him.</i>] Young. There is your passport to
  all we have to offer. You are graceful, too, and have taken some care with
  your dress. When you gaze in the mirror you try to imagine what you look like
  to a woman. You are anxious to please. You are ready to believe anything that
  is agreeable. Yes, you will do very well for Florio or Crispino, or any of
  the young lovers who are always endeavouring to escape from Panteleone's
  spite.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Taking snuff vigorously.</i>] Disgusting, sir!
  Disgusting!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I am grateful for your description. It is true I am eager
  for any adventure. Is there a lady in your Villa Malcontenta?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] My lord!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Unheeding SECOND T.</i>] There is. Awaiting precisely
  such a charming fellow as yourself. First T. Delightful, Mezzetin!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Furious.</i>] My lord, if you were a little younger,
  I'd give you a thrashing with the birch.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Smiling.</i>] And if you were a little younger,
  reverend sir, I'd put up a play of fisticuffs that would keep you quiet a
  while, you old torment!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience.</i>] You see, it is always the same
  story. These two can never agree&mdash;one is eager for his reputation, the
  other for his pleasure. But we really ought to be sorry for the old man, he
  is hungry and, at his age, that is serious.<br>
  [<i>While MEZZETIN is speaking the Two TRAVELLERS are regarding each other
  with defiance, the young man is smiling but the other is angry. MEZZETIN
  returns to them.</i>] Signor<br>
  Panteleone, would you like some supper?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Sir, your most obliged. Considering I
  have not eaten since midday, and then was forced to content myself with a
  sickly mess of the devil knows what&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> You are hungry? Well, what would you like?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Glaring.</i>] Ham and eggs. An apple pudding with a
  good short crust. A pigeon pie. A tankard of ale and a pipe of Virginia. That
  is what I would <i>like</i>, sir. But I quite realize I am not in a civilized
  country. Therefore, bring what you have and be damned to you!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>In affected horror.</i>] Sir! Never have I heard you
  speak so profanely.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] Never have you seen me in so profane a
  situation. I consider your conduct abominable, my lord. Abominable!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> That is what you will say of the supper. All the same I
  will fetch it.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> And the lady?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Never fear, signor, the lady is as impatient as you
  are!<br>
  [<i>Exit into obscurity R.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Really&mdash;well, really! My lord, I shall have to
  report this to His Grace. Under my very nose! Have you lost all sense of
  decorum?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I hope so. We are in faeryland, I do believe.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I fear you have caught the malaria&mdash;you must be
  delirious. I wish I had not left the quinine in the coach.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Why do you think I am out of my senses, good doctor?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Talking of faeryland! This draughty, decayed
  villa&mdash;damp, too, far too near the river, this tawdry furniture, that
  insolent ruffian, in his absurd dress! Faeryland! Well, I don't make much of
  our chances of a meal and a bed. There's no comfort&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> There's a lady.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Now, sir, now&mdash;I will not have it, do you hear? I
  will not. I've always drawn a line&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Why, so have I&mdash;but not in the same place as you,
  sir.<br>
  [<i>Sounds of music without, a pleasant melody on strings.</i>]<br>
  Ah, a heavenly harmony!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Heavenly indeed! Well, sir, if that is what we are to
  hear in heaven I for one shall be disgusted, sir, disgusted.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Curiously.</i>] Dr. Prose, what is your idea of
  heaven?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> An empty stomach, sir, makes a dull mind. I've no ideas
  on any subject whatever.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] But you are so pious, so careful, so
  diligent at prayers, so exact in your behaviour, so circumspect in your
  speech&mdash;you forego all that is really agreeable, save a good meal now
  and then&mdash;in short, you lead a very miserable sort of life; now you must
  have some idea as to what you expect as a reward, sir?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> You have never ventured to speak like this before, you
  must be bewitched.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I hope I am. Come, sir, do you not expect a handsome
  acknowledgment from the Almighty for your good behaviour?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> You, sir, are blasphemous. As for what I expect, I have
  no doubt I shall get it, no doubt at all, sir.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Yes, yes, good doctor, but what <i>is</i> it? If this
  isn't heaven, tell me what is? Heaven&mdash;to be young, well, idle, in
  Italy, awaiting the unknown!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> That's the devil of it, my good sir&mdash;the unknown may
  be a couple of cut-throats.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You are spoiling the music. Hark, how sweet! In this
  country they cage nightingales.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I wish they caged lunatics! Then we should not have been
  plagued by this detestable Mezzetin fellow. [<i>Catches hold of the young
  man.</i>] I insist, my lord, that you leave this place, we will sleep on the
  road&mdash;in the coach&mdash;we will walk to Venice&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> If you please, you may, sir, but I shall remain.</p>

  <p>[<i>While they are struggling together enter MEZZETIN from L. bearing a
  tray with fruit, wine and food.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience, placing tray on table centre.</i>]
  There, you see, they can never agree. It is always the same. If I leave them
  for a moment they come to blows. I perceive I shall have a very fatiguing
  evening. [<i>To TRAVELLERS.</i>] Signor, you are served.</p>

  <p>[<i>The musicians play. The moon is rising. SECOND T. sinks exhausted into
  chair by the table and eyes the refreshment while straightening his
  wig.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>With a groan.</i>] And I was always certain of dying
  in my bed, with good Mrs. Vinegar&mdash;[<i>to MEZZETIN</i>]&mdash;my
  housekeeper, sir&mdash;making my possets.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Pouring wine.</i>] Why forego this pious hope,
  sir?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I shall not survive the night. The food is probably
  poisoned&mdash;the wine drugged; and I swear the house is damp&mdash;I
  believe I have a palsy. [<i>Groans.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To FIRST T.</i>] He is very tiresome. We shall have
  to get rid of him.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Drinking.</i>] Where is the lady?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>To MEZZETIN.</i>] I forbid the lady to appear! I
  forbid it! But should she appear, I shall know how to deal with her; it will
  not be the first time, sir, that I have been called upon to place before a
  straying sheep the terrors of eternity, the pangs of hell, the wrath of
  heaven, in all their most awful colours.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Have something to eat and drink, sir&mdash;the wine is
  excellent.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Pressing food on him.</i>] You have no idea how this
  will improve your spirits.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Improve my spirits! <i>They</i> require no support. I
  thank my Maker I am fortified by celestial comfort. But the body, sir, the
  body that faints, that fails. [<i>Drinks.</i>] Ah, if I am to have a vigil
  to-night against the powers of darkness, I must keep my strength up.
  [<i>Drinks again.</i>]</p>

  <p>[<i>The music ceases. FIRST T. leaves table and goes to MEZZETIN. SECOND
  T. absorbed in his meal takes no notice of them.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>To MEZZETIN, whispering.</i>] Is it the lady I saw in
  the coach?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] It is.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Is it the lady who dropped the rose from the balcony at
  Pisa?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> It is.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Is it the lady whose prayer-book I shared in the wayside
  church outside Florence?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>More and more delighted.</i>] It is!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> What shall I call her?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Incognita.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> The unknown! [<i>Goes to table and picks up
  wine-glass.</i>] Homage to the Unknown! [<i>Drinks.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Eating steadily.</i>] The cooking is not
  bad&mdash;for foreigners; the wine [<i>drinks
  again</i>]&mdash;passable&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Why has the music ceased?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> You will hear it again presently. The musicians rest. The
  lady is preparing herself.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Shaking his finger at MEZZETIN.</i>] And so am I!
  [<i>Drinks again.</i>] I feel better, decidedly. Ready for [<i>drinks
  again</i>] Vice itself&mdash;herself, I should say.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> What shall we do with him?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> That is always the question&mdash;perhaps the lady will
  be able to manage him. I will fetch her. Second T. [<i>Jovial.</i>] Fetch
  her, sir! Bring in your straying sheep! [<i>Drinks.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> No, no, this will spoil everything. Where is my romance,
  my adventure, while he is here?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience.</i>] I told you I should have trouble
  with them! However, I must do my best. [<i>To FIRST T.</i>] Have patience,
  and leave it all to me.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Shaking bottle at him.</i>] Aha, you rogue! You think
  to get the better of me, do you? Well, sir, you are mistaken. Here I am,
  quite comfortable, I shall not budge, I shall not sleep. I shall not allow
  this graceless youth out of my sight.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Bravo! you play your part very well. I will go and fetch
  you some coffee to help keep you awake.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Imploringly.</i>] Mezzetin, do not forsake me!<br>
  [<i>MEZZETIN puts his finger on his lips and skips out L. FIRST T. turns
  despairingly to SECOND T., who continues drinking; he is now very genial, but
  none the less firm.</i>]<br>
  Oh! sir, allow me this one night.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Tut, tut, sir. No nights, no mornings, evenings, or
  afternoons. Nothing, sir. I will return you to your respected father if no
  better for your travels, at least no worse. How difficult it is to keep from
  corruption in this godless age. [<i>Drinks.</i>] Now, when I was a young
  man&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Yes, I know&mdash;but now I am young&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Slightly tipsy.</i>] I proved the hollowness of all
  vanities; believe me, my dear Charles, there is nothing in&mdash;any of 'em.
  Frauds! Shams!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Sir, oh, I am sure that you are right, but I want to find
  out for myself.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mustn't. Positively mustn't. Strictest orders&mdash;not
  to find out for self. [<i>Drinks.</i>] Find out what? That's what want to
  know.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> So do I. Now, dear Dr. Prose, if you were to stretch
  yourself on that sofa and just meditate a little...</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mustn't. Positively mustn't. Why? Want to find out. Ah,
  my dear Charles, you won't get round me.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Sir, I implore you to drink yet another glass of this
  excellent wine.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mustn't. Positively mustn't.</p>

  <p>[<i>Music heard again. Enter from L. a Lady in domino and mask&mdash;bauta
  Venetian fashion.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Ah, Incognita!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Shaking his finger.</i>] The strayed sheep! Ah,
  naughty, naughty!</p>

  <p>[<i>The LADY advances timidly. FIRST T. tries to snatch her hand, but she
  evades him.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> I am frightened. I fear I have undertaken too much.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Whispering.</i>] Never mind the old man, we will get
  rid of him.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Unheeding this.</i>] Have I been too bold?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Retaining his seat.</i>] Much too bold. Now, listen
  to me, listen to good old Prose.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Turning to SECOND T. anxiously.</i>] Oh, sir, I am all
  attention.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mustn't be naughty girl&mdash;positively
  mustn't&mdash;naughty girl won't go to heaven&mdash;good old heaven!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Alas! I am overwhelmed&mdash;I blush!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Ought to have blushed before. [<i>Bracing himself.</i>]
  Madam, your behaviour is&mdash;indiscreet, unbecoming, disgraceful.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Oh, into what a situation have the transports of love hurried
  me!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Alas! What confession do I hear? You love this wretched
  youth? You have pursued him, and, if guardian&mdash;poor old
  Prose&mdash;hadn't been faithful old dog&mdash;who knows? [<i>Shakes bottle
  at her.</i>] Begone! Avaunt! False siren, I conjure thee, depart! [<i>Drinks

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Purity of what? Excuse for what? I said&mdash;begone!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Give me one kind word to treasure in my memory! We knew each
  other once.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Startled.</i>] The Devil!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> No, your own Lucia!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mine? But are you not pursuing old Charles here?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> That insipid boy! No. Indeed you mock. I love you. And have
  long done so.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] Mrs. Vinegar! Mrs. Vinegar! Bless my
  soul, I forgot&mdash;Mrs. Vinegar not here!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Who is this Signora Vinegar? Is she your beloved?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Madam, you confound me! My lord Charles, help!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>In background.</i>] Nay, sir, the adventure is to you,
  not to me, after all. I cannot interfere.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Clasping SECOND T's knees.</i>] Are you
  ice&mdash;marble?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Neither I merely uncomfortable. But what's uncomfortable?
  Mustn't complain.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Pray do not. Is it possible that you have forgotten Lucy?
  [<i>Offers wine.</i>] Come, drink again and you'll remember.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Puzzled.</i>] Lucy? [<i>Drinks.</i>] Not little Lucy
  Latimer of the Grange?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> The same&mdash;we exchanged rings, vows and kisses&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> My faith, so we did. I'd forgotten.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Oh, fie on your fidelity!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> 'Tis so long ago.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> It is yesterday.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Is it? You by the fireside with your knotting and I
  coming in out of the cold, and the smell of winter apples cooking for jelly,
  and your little sister Jane putting up the holly&mdash;is that yesterday?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Yes, indeed. And you were going to ask me to marry
  you&mdash;why did you not do so? We should have been so happy.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Wistfully.</i>] Should we, my dear? Why, so I
  thought. But we had no money. And I was selfish, I suppose. I like comfort,
  too. I went to London as tutor to a proud lord's whelp&mdash;and then the
  church...well, well, poor Lucy!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Have you never since felt the happiness you had when you used
  to visit me? You brought me a nosegay once.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] Why, so I did; why Lucy [<i>turns to
  the LADY</i>] and you remember the robin we used to feed and Scamp the
  dog?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Who used to go with us on our walks? And a little coral scarf
  I wore with ribbons to match?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Yes, yes, how could I ever have
  forgotten? But surely this is a very long time ago. [<i>Sadly.</i>] You are
  hooded and masked, but underneath your hair must be grey, like
  mine&mdash;your face lined, like mine&mdash;We dream, Lucy, we dream.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Why, then, wake?</p>

  <p>[<i>Music without.</i>]</p>

  <p>Do you not hear? Is not that the melody I used to play on my spinet?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Indeed it is. Oh, Lucy, I haven't missed it all? [<i>In a
  panic.</i>] I am not old, it has not really gone by&mdash;lost? I am not an
  old pedant in Italy, but a youth in England.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You are young and I am Lucy&mdash;Come [<i>raises him from
  chair</i>]. You are tired from a long ride through the snow; you will rest on
  the sophy while I play to you; then supper and all the family! And we will
  arrange our marriage day.</p>

  <p>[<i>While speaking the LADY leads SECOND T. to sophy. He gets on to it,
  she puts cushions under his head.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Drowsily.</i>] That is comfortable, Lucy, very
  comfortable. And how prettily the spinet sounds! Dear Lucy, do not forget to
  wake me in good time.</p>

  <p>[<i>He falls asleep. FIRST T. comes forward. The LADY throws of domino and
  mask and reveals MEZZETIN. Music ceases.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Laughing softly.</i>] I knew you from the first! Your
  figure is too angular, your voice too squeaky! And yet you deceived him.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> When you are as old as he is dreams will easily send you
  to sleep, too.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Looking down at SECOND T. asleep on sofa.</i>] And so
  he had a Lucy! Who would have thought it?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Who is there who has not had a Lucy? No nut so dry,
  Signor, that did not once hang green on a tree.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> But I hope you do not deal only in deceptions, I hope
  there really is a lady and that you do not intend to slip on another disguise
  and fool me.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience.</i>] You notice how ungrateful he is!
  After all the trouble I have taken! Well, we shall see if I deserve his
  thanks or not. Having disposed of age, cynicism and decorum, we now proceed
  to the real matter of the night.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Clasping his hands.</i>] And quickly, I hope!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> First, we must set the scene. Help me to turn the sofa so
  that you are not disturbed by the slumbers of sleeping propriety.<br>
  [<i>They turn sofa away from audience, or, if this is not practicable, put a
  screen about it, so that the sleeping tutor is hidden from audience.</i>]<br>
  His wine was well-flavoured and he will certainly sleep till cockcrow. Now
  [<i>goes to window and draws curtains</i>] the moon has risen and really
  looks very pretty. [<i>Gently claps his hands.</i>] The music!</p>

  <p>[<i>Music again.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> And the lady?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> No, we are not ready yet. [<i>Draws table to back, pulls
  out another couch from L.</i>] Now, the scene is set. But what about you,
  Signor? You look a little English. Come, I must disguise you more in
  accordance with the humour of the night and the Villa Malcontenta.</p>

  <p>[<i>MEZZETIN opens a chest&mdash;or the ottoman couch&mdash;takes out a
  large gold lace ruff which he claps round FIRST T's neck; a gay satin coat
  which he makes him change for his travelling coat, and ties a large knot of
  ribbons on his sword. FIRST T's appearance now is that of one of the
  travellers in Watteau's "L'embarquement pour l'Ile de Cythere."</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>During change of dress.</i>] How shall I repay you for
  all this trouble you are taking, Mezzetin?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> By always believing in the impossible.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Who are you, Mezzetin?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Handing him a mirror.</i>] Behold yourself! Are you
  not transformed?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Looking at him.</i>] Yes, I feel free of much that
  went with my clothes. I believe that I too could cut capers and sing; in
  short, I have become Arlequino waiting for Columbina&mdash;but who are you
  who work these miracles?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> I am Fantasy, day-dreaming and the unattainable. I beckon
  just round the corner where no one has been yet. I reside in those violet
  horizons which no man has reached. I am all you missed in the past and all
  that will evade you in the future. I am all that is incredible yet pursued,
  all that is never credited, yet longed for. Those who do not know me are no
  better than blind worms, but those who do know me are always tormented by
  unsatisfied desires.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> As I am tormented by you now. Where is the lady?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> I will fetch her. [<i>To audience.</i>] It is always the
  same! You see how impatient and unreasonable he is! Do not blame me if things
  go wrong. As you can observe, he looks quite charming and his manners are not
  bad. But he is very inexperienced and lacks tact and discretion. Something
  disagreeable will occur and I shall be called upon to put it right.</p>

  <p>[<i>MEZZETIN skips out R.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Nervously, looking after MEZZETIN.</i>] I wish I had
  asked him for more advice. What does one do in such a situation? Who is she?
  Am I the subject of a great lady's caprice or merely the victim of a jest on
  the part of this clown? Is she perhaps married? I feel very uneasy and wish I
  had taken another glass of wine.<br>
  [<i>Goes to table now at back and looks for wine.</i>]<br>
  The good doctor has drunk it all! Every bottle is empty. I hope I do not look
  a fool in this carnival attire. [<i>Returns centre stage.</i>] Ah, here she
  is! If only this had happened before how delightful it would be, but the
  first time one cannot help feeling nervous.</p>

  <p>[<i>Enter R. the LADY. She is young and pretty, wears a loose, dark silk
  mantle with sleeves. Her hair is unpowdered, she carries a small cluster of
  flowers, her manner is very serious.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Good evening, traveller.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Good evening, madam.</p>

  <p>[<i>They study each other with grave embarrassment.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Who brought you here, stranger?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Mezzetin.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> He also brought me. Do you know why?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I cannot answer that, madam.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Why has he brought us together in this room in the Villa
  Malcontenta&mdash;with music and the moon?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Yearningly.</i>] Because we are young. And it is a
  summer night in Italy.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> There are so many summer nights. And one is young so long. Do
  you like my flowers? When Mezzetin came to fetch me I was watering the plants
  on my balconies and I picked some of the blossoms to bring with me. In the
  moonlight they were silver. Here they appear gold.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Like yourself, you are gold and silver both.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> No, I am flesh and blood, like yourself. [<i>approaches
  him.</i>] I believe we must be about the same age. How old are you?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I have forgotten.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Why, so have I, now I think of it.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same, bending towards her.</i>] Who are you, you
  lovely creature?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Mezzetin says you must call me the Unknown.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Why, so I will.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> And who are you?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Let me also be unknown for to-night.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> As you please. It does not really matter. [<i>Gives him
  flowers.</i>] Take these, already they begin to fade.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> No, no! With kisses I will revive them. [<i>Kisses the
  flowers.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> They droop the more from your warm hands and lips.<br>
  [<i>Music ceases.</i>]<br>
  Suddenly it is silent!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Putting flowers on couch L.</i>] What does that mean,
  that we shall be disturbed?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Who is to disturb us? I am here alone, everyone has gone to a
  festival in the village.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Even Mezzetin?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Yes, he has gone to join the merrymakers, he is never long in
  one place.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Will you not take off your mantle, which is so dark and
  prim?<br>
  [<i>The LADY takes of mantle; she wears a sacque of pale flowered material.
  FIRST T. takes her hands.</i>]<br>
  It was you I saw looking from the window of the coach?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Was it?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Eagerly.</i>] I was idling on the bridge at Pisa, the
  coach swung by, it was lacquered green and the arms on the side had many
  quarterings; you peeped between the leather curtains, there was a spaniel
  with silver bells on your knee and beside you a man, ill-favoured, wearing a
  violet coat&mdash;Who was he?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> I have forgotten.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Releasing her hands.</i>] You forget too much!
  <i>Lady.</i> Everything. I am too young to have memories.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> No memories&mdash;of me?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You are in the present. While you are here I shall not forget
  you.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> But afterwards? When I go away, then will you forget?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> How can I tell?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Mournfully.</i>] Love should be immortal and never
  forgotten.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Love is&mdash;but you did not speak of him, but of
  yourself.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You are not faithful?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> To love. He has many aspects&mdash;to-night yours and mine;
  to-morrow, perhaps, who knows, that of another man for me and another woman
  for you.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> No, no, it has always been you! In the woods at home, in
  the sunbeams across my chamber wall, between the pages of my books at
  college&mdash;during these travels&mdash;always you [<i>imploringly</i>].
  Have you had no such dreams of me?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You expect too much. The present moment is ours&mdash;and
  that only.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You learned that philosophy from the rogue Mezzetin.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> No, from experience.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> What have you experienced&mdash;at your age?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> It is true that I am very young. It is also true that when I
  was at school I used to hear a few stories...Ah, well, I fear you are very
  pragmatical. While you talk of fidelity the clock is ticking.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I always thought of you as constant, pure, noble...</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> There was one talked of virtue and did not see he stood upon
  a quicksand. As it swallowed him he lamented his wasted sermon. So time will
  swallow you up in the midst of your nice debates.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Vexed.</i>] I feared I should make a fool of myself!
  Yet surely I do not offend by praising you. I said you were constant, pure,
  noble&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> But did you say I had a neat ankle, a pretty wrist, a slim
  waist&mdash;nay, you have not even glanced at these details of my person.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Confused.</i>] I did not presume&mdash;I may not
  venture&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Then if you may not presume or venture I had better return to
  watering my poor flowers. [<i>Turns to R.</i>] First T. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Do
  not go! I will not be so stupid! You must forgive my awkwardness. I have been
  looking forward to this so long, I really hardly know what I am doing.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Do not think I am not sorry for you. Alas! it is difficult
  for any of us to be perfectly natural even in the most natural of
  situations.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I am torn by a hundred doubts and fears! I
  fear to do the wrong thing&mdash;I fear still more to do nothing at all!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> What are you whispering to yourself? You should know your
  part without rehearsal.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> How can I if I have never played it before?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> But you say you have seen me so often; surely, then, you were
  ready with your style of behaviour when we met?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I become more and more confused. Is she
  fresh from a convent&mdash;a lily grown in the shelter of a cypress tree? Or
  is she one of those dangerous creatures against whom I have so often been
  warned? I should like her wholly innocent&mdash;and yet I long to meet an
  accomplished woman of the world who will help me to overcome this confounded
  shyness.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> I am not as beautiful as you expected? You are
  disappointed?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Indeed, you are more beautiful
  [<i>approaching</i>]&mdash;now I see you close I discover a thousand
  graces&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> And a thousand hesitations.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> The second the result of the first.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Perhaps you would prefer me in another costume?<br>
  [<i>SECOND T. snores loudly.</i>]<br>
  Oh, heavens, what is that?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Only the sleeping protest of drugged propriety&mdash;my
  tutor, Dr. Prose, is slumbering on the sofa.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> It was a jarring note.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You were saying&mdash;about the costume? Truly, I think
  that sacque rather shapeless.</p>

  <p>[<i>The LADY unbuttons and takes of the sacque. She wears a lace undress
  beneath, showing much of her shape.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Turning about.</i>] How is that?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Adorable!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> I hope that you are more at your ease. Sit down on this
  sophy.<br>
  [<i>He does so on couch L.</i>]<br>
  [<i>Standing before him.</i>] Who am I?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I have ceased to care.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> But, consider, I might be a great lady, who fell in love with
  you on the bridge at Pisa. I might be a maid in her mistress's clothes. I
  might be a girl whose parents are away, I might be a poor player acting a
  familiar part, I might be something worse than any of these with my eyes on
  your pocket-book, watch and rings.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Incognita, I ask no questions.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Seating herself beside him on the sofa.</i>] Yet I had a
  thousand answers ready for you! [<i>Taking his hand.</i>] Yes, it is true we
  have met before, riding on a white camel across a desert, sharing a lilac
  sunshade in a garden of oleanders, seated on a balcony overlooking an island
  weighed to the water's edge with roses; or in the snow driving fast towards a
  castle with lights in the upper window...Ah, what drowsiness of sun or frost,
  what skies lavender with heat, purple with cold, what immortal trifles, fans,
  slippers, ruffles, ribbons, fruit and sweetmeats&mdash;[<i>leaning towards
  him as he, absorbed in her words, leans towards her</i>] Kisses, caresses,
  and the final ecstacies&mdash;darkness and sleep.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Entranced.</i>] Take me with you on yet another
  journey to so joyous a destination.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Sometimes I sit seated among rosy clouds, a gold sceptre in
  my hand, a diadem of pearls on my brow, Tritons, Loves, surround me, blowing
  horns of coral; dwarf negroes lead up a white hippocampus, from a balustrade
  of the purest alabaster my lover looks down and offers me a paroquet; to
  escape him I mount a little car of opal drawn by peacocks. [<i>She rises.
  FIRST T. springs after her.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> But you cannot escape your lover&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Holding him back.</i>] While, sometimes I am only poor
  Brighella, the despised varlet&mdash;[<i>she throws off the lace robe, and
  shows herself in the satin trousers and jacket of Pierrot or Brighella, but
  her neck and bosom are open on a quantity of ruffies</i>]&mdash;whose
  business is to run your errands and make you laugh.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Ardent.</i>] Laughter and errands are over for
  to-night&mdash;come to me&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Still holding him of.</i>] What will you give me if I do?
  I have already everything&mdash;youth, and a thousand dreams&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] I will give you yet one more dream.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> I do not want it. I am complete&mdash;a circlet of pearls
  exact to my throat, a crystal of wine full to the brim, a sheet of paper
  loaded with expressions of devotion and each different&mdash;who is more
  content than I?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] Why then did you come here to torment
  me?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Ask the butterfly why it chooses the carnation instead of the
  syringa as a pausing place! I know not why I came, nor why I shall go.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You are cruel. You say you want nothing, yet you take from
  me the little I have.</p>

  <p>[<i>Music again, very soft.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> They play for us&mdash;<i>adagio</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You torment me. [<i>Catches hold of her.</i>]</p>

  <p>[<i>Music changes.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> <i>Scherzo!</i><br>
  [<i>She wrenches free. Music ceases.</i>]<br>
  Finale!<br>
  [<i>She runs to sofa L., the FIRST T. after her. He catches her
  again.</i>]<br>
  You see, you have made the music cease.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Triumphant.</i>] What does the music matter? I have
  caught you. [<i>Holds her closely.</i>] Yes, and you shall not so easily go
  again!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You seem to have forgotten your timidity.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] I have forgotten everything, as you
  advised me. I only remember that the present hour is ours.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> And that I am the lady of the coach?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] That is indifferent to me. The only
  thing I am sure of is that you are the lady I have in my arms&mdash;and it is
  the only thing that matters.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Embracing him.</i>] You have learnt your lesson very
  well. I love you. I always have loved you.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Draws her on to couch; they sit there close in each
  other's embrace.</i>] And I love you. I always loved you.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> There is no more to be said.</p>

  <p>[<i>They kiss. Enter L. a MASK. He is handsomely dressed, wears a huge old
  fashioned peruke and a mask fashioned like the visage of a wolf; he carries a
  cane and wears a sword. For a second he surveys the lovers, who do not
  perceive his cautious entry.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>To LADY.</i>] I see I have timed my arrival
  excellently.<br>
  [<i>The lovers start apart, the LADY shrieks.</i>]<br>
  I missed you at the festival. Who is your companion?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Mercy! Pity! Forgiveness!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Dazed.</i>] Who is this?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> My husband.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Advancing.</i>] Yes, Signor, her husband.</p>

  <p>First T. [<i>The same.</i>] You are married?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Vexed.</i>] Of course. Why don't you say what is
  customary on these occasions?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> But I don't know what that is&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> A fool. Where is your taste, Rosina?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>To FIRST T.</i>] You really must do something. Don't you
  see that this is serious? You must face him.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] I'll face anyone, of course. But I never
  knew of his existence&mdash;and nothing has happened to cause him any real
  vexation.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> He never will believe that. I know his suspicious nature.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> And I know your complete untrustworthiness, Rosina.
  [<i>To FIRST T.</i>] Signor, who are you?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Defiant.</i>] A traveller.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Touching his sword.</i>] I shall be delighted to send
  you a stage further on your journey.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> What do you mean?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You will have to fight him, of course.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Shall I? I've learnt to fence, but I never fought anyone
  before.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Vexed.</i>] Is there anything you <i>have</i> done before
  except ask questions?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Indignant.</i>] You take this very coolly. I believe
  you deceived me, too.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> Of course she did. What did you think she was here
  for?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>To LADY, simply.</i>] Then you don't love me? And you
  are not the lady of the coach? And what about our dreams?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Whispering to him.</i>] I will answer all those questions
  when you have disposed of my husband.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Overhearing.</i>] And I will answer them now. She
  does not love you. She is not the lady of the coach, for I never allow her
  out of the villa. As for dreams, she never has any; and, as for disposing of
  me [<i>draws</i>], that, madam, will not be so easy, for I am well used to
  this sort of affair, while I see that your lover is as green as grapes in
  June.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Bracing himself.</i>] But I daresay I am able to give
  a good account of myself. [<i>Flings of coat.</i>] But, please take off your
  mask, you look really horrible.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Grim.</i>] If you saw my face you would be further
  alarmed. [<i>Takes of coat.</i>] Know, Signor, that I am of the most ancient
  blood in Italy, and judge of my feelings when I see my wife, in this wanton
  attire, in the arms of a stray gallant!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Tears of the knot of ribbons from his sword and draws
  it.</i>] My blood, sir, is not unworthy to satisfy you&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Yes, indeed, I am sure he is nobly born, and we did but kiss,
  my Rinaldo. Have mercy!</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> None. I shall kill him&mdash;then deal with you. You see,
  I know the correct procedure in these cases.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Indeed you appear to do so, while I am but a novice and
  cannot understand why this pleasant adventure must end in my death.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Fierce.</i>] How did you enter my villa?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> The coach lost a wheel in a rut; while we were waiting on
  the road up came a fantastic fellow called Mezzetin&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> Aha! Mezzetin I I know him&mdash;he is a very great
  rogue.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> &mdash;and he invited me here.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> Well, no doubt of it, you must die. And do not delay. I
  am tired with the festival I have been attending.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> If you would take off your mask I should be
  obliged&mdash;you bewilder me.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Flourishing his sword.</i>] These are excuses. Defend
  yourself.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Who has slipped on her mantle.</i>] Will you not give
  him, poor youth, five minutes to say his prayers and farewell to me?</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Seating himself on couch.</i>] Certainly. No one
  shall say I am ill bred. He may even kiss you&mdash;seeing no one will ever
  kiss you again. Have you ever thought of that, Rosina? One kiss must be the
  last kiss for all of us.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Shuddering, to FIRST T.</i>] He intends to kill us
  both!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I will defend you to the utmost; but, alas! I have so
  little skill. I perceive now how rash it is to enter into these adventures
  unless one has had some experience.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Approaching him.</i>] He allows us one kiss. After all,
  this is an agreeable way to die. I shall never be old and you will never be
  surfeited. I shall never be ill, nor you infirm; when they lay us before the
  altar in the chapel everyone will say how fair we are and what a pity it was
  we were slain.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Yes, there is consolation in that. And I shall not be
  mourned very much. My brother will take my place with the utmost elegance. I
  am too young to have any attachments or possessions of my own and therefore I
  shall forfeit nothing but dreams and hopes&mdash;and who knows but that these
  continue after death?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> Yes, perhaps now we shall really ride a white hippocampus
  protected by a lilac parasol&mdash;I shall find a couch in the chalice of a
  lily and you will string for me pearls which an endless sea of eternal azure
  washes to your feet...Oh, I am happy! [<i>Embraces him.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Then you do love me, after all? Then I am happy, too.
  Everything is endurable save disillusion.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Still seated on couch.</i>] You are too young to know
  that.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> It is not knowledge, but intuition. When I thought this
  lady was a vulgar creature who had deceived me I was wretched, now I find she
  is glad to die with me I am serene again. I therefore conclude that anything
  is preferable to the misery of disenchantment.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> A pretty speech. Three of your minutes are gone and, if
  you wish to say any prayers&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Prayers? To whom?</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> That was what I was wondering. Your idols must be very
  inefficient or ill-paid, otherwise you would never be in this situation. But,
  perhaps you chance to be a Christian.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I wonder&mdash;I never thought about it till now.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> No, you are a pagan like myself. We return to the earth like
  blooms nipped by a late frost, fall and are trampled into the field to rise
  again; and we have been a thousand fanciful shapes, you and I&mdash;and shall
  be another thousand yet. I have embraced you in the mountains of the moon, in
  the grottos under the sea, on the clouds beyond the sunset, in twilight
  groves of Hades, on sweet violet paths of Parnassus&mdash;all the Muses
  assisted at our union, and Apollo played our marriage ode&mdash;on an
  iceberg, green, purple and glittering, we floated to extinction in the
  midnight of the North, and we were born again on an island of the South where
  the perfume of monstrous blossoms was so powerful that I fainted in your
  arms&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Enraptured, embracing her.</i>] This is ecstasy, this
  is what I sought! I am satisfied! [<i>They kiss.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] Just as well. The five minutes are
  over.</p>

  <p>[<i>The lovers passionately and reluctantly part; the LADY retreats to the
  couch and the TRAVELLER faces his opponent; he takes of his ruff and fancy
  coat given him by MEZZETIN and recovers his sword, which he has laid aside to
  embrace the LADY. The MASK does not take of his coat; they make a few passes
  at each other.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> You do not seem nervous.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Exalted.</i>] On the contrary, I am delighted to
  die&mdash;Strike! I cannot fence with you.</p>

  <p><i>The Mask.</i> Oho! I am slain!</p>

  <p>[<i>He falls prone R. FIRST T. steps back amazed and horrified. The LADY
  rises with a shriek.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>In dismay.</i>] Is it possible I have killed him? He
  does not stir! Quick, take off his mask and let us see if we can help
  him.</p>

  <p>[<i>The LADY runs to the prostrate MASK and bends over him.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> It is useless, he is dead. Your sword went right through
  him.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] This is dreadful. I feel rather sick.
  Are you sure he is dead?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] Quite sure. He does not breathe. Now we are
  alone again.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Throwing away his sword with a shudder.</i>] But this
  is different; I never meant to kill him.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> But remember that he was quite ready to kill you.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> This is his house&mdash;you are his wife.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> No, his widow.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I do not know what to do. I was quite prepared to die
  myself but not to kill someone else&mdash;what of our enchanted isles beyond
  the tomb?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> We must postpone the visit.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>In horror.</i>] I shall be arrested&mdash;perhaps
  hanged&mdash;and I do not even know whom I have killed!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> This is Italy and these accidents are not uncommon. I daresay
  I can put some gloss on it.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You seem to take it very calmly; after all, he was your
  husband.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> That is just why I do take it so calmly. Dear me, you really
  have a great deal to learn!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> You've changed again!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> So have you.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>In despair.</i>] Nothing lasts! My moment of ecstasy
  when I thought we were going to die together has gone.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> It would not have been a moment of ecstasy if it had
  stayed.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> What shall I do?</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> You talked of fidelity, but now it seems to me you have
  forgotten me&mdash;now, when you can love me without hindrance.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Doubtfully.</i>] Oh yes, I must, no doubt, love you
  just the same. But this dead man has chilled my blood; it appears that after
  all I am a Christian, for I feel that I have committed a sin.</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> [<i>Enticing him.</i>] Commit another&mdash;with
  me&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> I have just killed your husband!</p>

  <p><i>Lady.</i> That is what makes it so easy. We shall not be
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>[<i>She draws the reluctant and bewildered TRAVELLER to window; he puts
  his head in his hands, his elbows on the sill. She watches him; THE MASK
  rises to a sitting position, takes of peruke and mask, revealing
  MEZZETIN.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience.</i>] You see what a variety of
  experiences I have given him&mdash;love, fear of death, killing a man, wooing
  a widow, and the knowledge that there is nothing in any of it I
  [<i>Rises.</i>] But he seems depressed. It is always the same. They are never
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>[<i>As the TRAVELLER remains in the window-place with his face hidden the
  LADY slips away from him, crosses stage, smiles at MEZZETIN and with her
  finger on her lips creeps out R. The TRAVELLER looks up, misses the LADY,
  comes centre stage and sees MEZZETIN, who cuts a caper.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Amazed.</i>] I had forgotten you&mdash;and yet you are
  the cause of all the mischief. Through you I have killed a man!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Pointing to wig and mask.</i>] No, only a mask.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>The same.</i>] What, it was you? You dared to play a
  trick on me! I shall thrash you, rogue!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>With clasped hands.</i>] Tricks are all I can play.
  You would not punish me for following my profession, Signor?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] No, I should punish myself for being
  such a fool as not to know your profession. [<i>Looking round.</i>] Where is
  the lady?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>With the same mock humility.</i>] Pardon, my Signor.
  As you seemed to have lost interest in her she has gone.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Who was she?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Aha, my Signor, did you not drink homage to the Unknown?
  That is exactly who she is&mdash;la Incognita!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Angry.</i>] Why did you interrupt me in that
  ridiculous disguise? I was being more successful than I expected&mdash;I was
  really getting very curious and excited&mdash;her kisses were
  delicious&mdash;when <i>you</i> came in&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Exactly, I thought your emotions would be heightened by
  an interruption. If things go too smoothly they become dull, and that must be
  avoided at all costs. Besides, though that is a detail, she really <i>is</i>
  my wife.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> The wife of Mezzetin? Impossible! <i>Your</i> wife!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Precisely. Why not? Do you think all the fools are
  bachelors? No, indeed, Mezzetin is a married man. [<i>Capers.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Furious.</i>] I do not believe you&mdash;that lovely
  creature! I have had enough of your lies. [<i>Snatches up his sword.</i>]
  Where is she? You are intolerable.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Oh, dear, oh, dear. What shall I do? I have made him
  angry!<br>
  [<i>Runs round stage, the TRAVELLER after him with drawn sword.</i>]<br>
  This comes of interfering with Englishmen!</p>

  <p>[<i>He knocks into screen or couch R. and wakes SECOND T., whose head
  appears above couch.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Mrs. Vinegar! Mrs. Vinegar! My slippers! My
  chocolate!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Shrilly.</i>] Coming&mdash;coming!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> The woman becomes intolerable! Where am I?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Clutching MEZZETIN by the collar, still very
  angry.</i>] We've both been fooled, sir, by this wretched scoundrel here!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>Struggling in his grip.</i>] And if it is the last
  time you're lucky.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Coming round the sofa, putting his wig and cravat
  straight.</i>] Charles! My lord! What is this place? I feel
  confused&mdash;slightly giddy.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Throwing of MEZZETIN.</i>] We have been the victims of
  a harlequinade.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Well, if you are never the victims of anything worse,
  you're lucky again!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I recall&mdash;the broken coach...</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> It must be mended by now.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i>.,.and the Villa Malcontenta!</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Still bitter.</i>] Well-named!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Now, what can I do to put him in a good humour again? It
  will soon be dawn and they must go on their way.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I believe I had a strange dream. About Lucy [<i>checks
  himself</i>]. 'Umph! I am afraid that the wine was not very good and that I
  drank a little too much of it.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] I drank scarcely a drop, and I too, had
  strange dreams.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> And yet neither of you feel grateful for these same
  dreams.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> Now at least I feel extremely sober.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Alas, what intoxication survives till the dawn? The
  rising sun always finds us sober&mdash;or asleep.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I remember this horrid fellow. So it is the dawn!
  [<i>With sudden suspicion.</i>] My lord, how have you spent the night?</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Not as I wished.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Sternly.</i>] You evade me.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Mournfully.</i>] No, it was I who was evaded.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To SECOND T.</i>] Signor, do not question the youth
  too closely, because he himself hardly knows what happened. You had better go
  on your way and think as you please on what has occurred.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I fear, sir, I must think as I don't please.
  [<i>Sniffing.</i>] There is a perfume in the air...[<i>Eyeing FIRST
  T.</i>]&mdash;a disorder in his looks&mdash;I accuse a petticoat!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Take care, Signor, that a petticoat does not accuse
  you!</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Indignant.</i>] Accuse me, sir&mdash;of what? Of what
  sin could a petticoat accuse me?</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Have you forgotten Lucy? Are you sure you had no
  companion in your strange dreams? That none of this perfume clings to your
  own person? That your looks are not disordered?</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> I remember nothing.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Then be careful not to give yourself away. Silence is the
  only cure for a bad memory.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Putting on hat, etc.</i>] Let us go, sir.</p>

  <p><i>Second T.</i> [<i>Dubiously.</i>] It certainly seems to be time we did
  so...My lord [<i>with discretion</i>], when we return to England this will be
  one of the episodes we shall forget.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> Only one? Do you intend others, then? I, for my part, want
  no more such experiences.</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> Hark, they play an <i>aubade</i> to set you on your
  way.<br>
  [<i>Music. The TRAVELLERS bow to MEZZETIN and exeunt, L.</i>]<br>
  Young man, come back!<br>
  [<i>FIRST T. turns back from L. MEZZETIN takes his hand. The LADY enters, R.
  MEZZETIN takes her hand.</i>]<br>
  [<i>To FIRST T.</i>] You will see her again. Under many disguises.<br>
  [<i>The LADY kisses her hand to FIRST T.</i>]<br>
  Never bear her any ill will for she means no harm. And she is really very
  pretty.</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Bewildered.</i>] I do not know what to think!</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> You must not think anything! It is all a matter of
  sentiment. Go on your way, Signor. [<i>Waves him of L.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>First T.</i> [<i>Departing, to LADY.</i>] I shall pursue you
  elsewhere!</p>

  <p>[<i>Exit L. MEZZETIN takes the LADY, still holding her hand, to the
  footlights, facing audience.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Mezzetin.</i> [<i>To audience, while aubade is softly played.</i>] The
  travellers, old and young, have gone. We remain and shall prepare our
  entertainment for the next wayfarers. It is wonderful what you can do with
  moonlight, wine, music and a few masks. Perhaps some day you will pay us a
  visit. We shall always be ready to receive you. We have welcomed so many
  travellers, if we are good for nothing else we offer them, at least, a
  trifling diversion. We give to the old memories, to the young hopes, to all
  another illusion either in the past or the future, and if our benefits are
  not very substantial we never destroy anything, not even the tenderest,
  sweetest falsehood. Perhaps you want to know who we are? We do not know
  ourselves. We have a thousand shapes, a thousand names. Yet I am always
  Mezzetin. And she is always&mdash;<i>La Incognita</i>. Good night and good
  morning both, for, if you are going home to bed, to us it is always the
  beginning of a new day.</p>

  <h2>SUPPER WITH MADAME OLSHAUSEN</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>And Prince Clement Louis of Grafenberg-Freiwaldau,
  Generalissimo of the Imperial Forces, in a summer pavilion outside Mons.</i>
  [SPANISH NETHERLANDS, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"I cannot conceive of any situation from which a man of breeding could not
  extricate himself with credit."</p>

  <p>"And yet Your Serene Highness has had your difficulties," replied the Duke
  of Glückstadt with as much irony as he dared show in the presence of his
  Commander-in-Chief.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, my dear Duke&mdash;I've had my difficulties, but no one has
  known about them."</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis of Grafenberg-Freiwaldau, Prince of the Holy Roman
  Empire, <i>Generalissimo</i> of the Imperial Forces, gave his amiable smile
  which did not cover good nature but complete indifference. Agreeable to all
  and interested in none, he was not popular with the ruling princes of the
  Empire, and the French nobility who composed his staff; but as his cold
  severity and his ruthless imperiousness were disguised by social tact and
  exquisite breeding, they were none of them able to find any cause for
  offence. He was one of the most considerable commanders of the day, and well
  knew his value: he could have made all these subordinate gentlemen devoted to
  him if he had so wished; but he did not think this same devotion worth any
  trouble to gain. He worked with other weapons.</p>

  <p>He then looked with his unruffled amiability at the Duke of Glückstadt,
  who plainly had something to say and did not know how to say it
  agreeably.</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis rather suspected that thee young German prince had
  come as a spokesman for the other generals; something was wrong no doubt, and
  he was expected to set it right. It would be, likely enough, one of the usual
  petty jealousies between themselves. Prince Clement Louis never allowed such
  matters to disturb his serenity.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Forces were besieging Mons, and these two gentlemen sat in a
  small farmhouse which was the Imperial Headquarters. It was evening of a ripe
  summer day, and Prince Clement Louis hoped that the young German prince would
  not be long in coming to whatever affair he had in hand; for he, the
  Generalissimo, had an appointment for supper with Madame Olshausen, who was
  established in a small château or summer pavilion, in the woods beyond the
  Imperial lines.</p>

  <p>"I believe my dear Duke," he said pleasantly, "that you find yourself in
  one of these awkward situations that we were discussing. There has been some
  trouble, perhaps, with the French generals, or with the other German princes?
  If so, tell me plainly, and I will do my best to smooth matters over."</p>

  <p>"Your Serene Highness always does that," replied the young German, "but I
  believe that this is a matter which even your tact will not so easily deal
  with."</p>

  <p>"Are you speaking," asked the Prince suavely, "for yourself? Or do you
  come as a spokesman for the others?"</p>

  <p>"As a spokesman for the others, Highness."</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis smiled: he knew perfectly well why this young officer
  had been chosen to voice the complaint of his fellow-officers; he was at once
  the youngest of all the German princes who served the Imperial Eagle and the
  most agreeable to the <i>Generalissimo</i>. He was both sincere and
  ingenuous. He might venture far in delicate matters and give no offence. The
  others, arrogant and quarrelsome, would not be able to control themselves,
  and would damage their cause by the passion with which they put it
  forward.</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis encouraged the young man with a brilliant look and
  smile. He really did not want to waste time; it was a delicious evening, and
  it was also two days since he had seen Madame Olshausen.</p>

  <p>"Your Serene Highness knows, as well as we all know," said the young Duke
  hurriedly, "that there is a spy in the camp&mdash;some leakage of news of our
  plans."</p>

  <p>"That has been discussed at the Council," replied the Generalissimo. "It
  can scarcely be any matter between my officers and myself."</p>

  <p>"We believe that that is precisely what it is," replied the young man
  earnestly, "but it is very likely that Your Serene Highness will take what I
  am about to say extremely amiss."</p>

  <p>"Then don't say it," replied Prince Clement Louis with smiling arrogance.
  "Let us waste no time, my dear Duke, on anything which is likely to cause
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Monseigneur," persisted the young Duke stubbornly, "there is a feeling of
  great discontent, of unrest, almost of panic among the men&mdash;among us,
  too, very definitely&mdash;about this question of the spy."</p>

  <p>"You say the spy," replied Prince Clement Louis calmly, "but we do not
  know there <i>is</i> a spy: every possible investigation has been made, every
  possible precaution taken, and we have discovered nothing."</p>

  <p>"But the ambush of the artillery train," replied the young man quickly,
  "and our surprise on the ramparts&mdash;the attack on the
  glacis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No surprise at all, for the garrison was ready to meet us."</p>

  <p>"A great many men were lost on both those occasions, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"Both occasions may have been coincidences; we must consider the
  possibility of that. For myself, I was inclined to think there was a spy at
  work; but, as I say, after the most extensive investigations, nothing was
  discovered, and I cannot conceive yet, my dear Duke, quite what your mission
  is."</p>

  <p>"You have ordered," replied the other, flushing thickly under his fair
  skin, "you have ordered, Monseigneur, a night attack on the citadel for
  to-morrow. If the enemy should be apprised of that..."</p>

  <p>"It is quite impossible," interrupted Prince Clement Louis. "Unless you
  entertain the monstrous supposition that one of my officers himself is a
  traitor; but that is an idea I refuse to entertain."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to entertain it!" exclaimed the young man with some
  heat, "that is the last thought which has entered into any of our minds,
  Monseigneur; but we have considered&mdash;there are these two things ahead:
  the night attack to-morrow, and Maréchal d'Orbitello coming up with the
  reinforcements which we so greatly need. Supposing, Monseigneur, he was met
  and cut to pieces, like the artillery train?"</p>

  <p>"That also is impossible," replied the Generalissimo. "The secret has been
  sternly kept, even my secretaries know nothing about it; the code is in my
  own possession, the messages have gone to and fro with a man of the utmost
  reliability. There is no one beyond yourselves, Highness, who can know of
  these two plans of mine."</p>

  <p>"If they fail," insisted the young Duke, rising impatiently and
  restlessly, "we, it seems to me, are likely to be slaughtered in our
  trenches. If there is some one in our camp who knows the weakness of our
  numbers, that twice reinforcements have been cut off, that we have lost what
  we did lose by that last surprise&mdash;which certainly, before God, sir, was
  a betrayal!&mdash;Maréchal d'Isenburg has only to come up from Brussels and
  annihilate us where we are. Our <i>liaison</i> has been interrupted and cut;
  there, too, is surely the work of a traitor!"</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis looked steadily at the flushed and earnest young
  officer.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite believe in this traitor of yours, my dear Duke," he
  replied. "Plans will go wrong: each case, as I say, may have been a matter of
  chance. I am forced to this conclusion, though I must say it seems unlikely;
  for there is no one whom I can possibly suspect...no one, indeed, to whose
  advantage it would be to betray me; for those who serve under me will find
  obviously their best advantage in supporting me."</p>

  <p>"We think we know who has betrayed us," said the young Duke of Glückstadt,
  "and I have been sent here on the abominable errand of telling Your Highness
  whom this person is&mdash;or whom we think it is."</p>

  <p>"Why 'abominable'?" demanded Prince Clement Louis haughtily. "Shall I not
  be rejoiced to know? Never have I had so many misfortunes as during this
  siege of Mons; and if you have been skilful enough to discover the author of
  them, why should it be any offence to me?"</p>

  <p>The young Duke did not reply, but walked uneasily up and down the worn,
  flagged floor. The windows were open on the violet twilight, and the air was
  pleasant with the perfume of late hay brought from the low fields beyond the
  encampment.</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis glanced at the old clock beside the kitchen stone.
  Madame Olshausen would be already expecting him; it was a pity that this boy
  could not come sooner to the point...</p>

  <p>A small dim mirror, painted with a wreath of faded flowers on the frame,
  hung beneath the clock; and there Prince Clement Louis could see himself, in
  his ornate uniform, richly laced with knotted bullion, with his Orders
  sparkling over the lace on his breast, his long, stiff, military, powdered
  and pomaded curls, clasped with a diamond buckle, and his smooth,
  expressionless face, so handsome as to be almost effeminate.</p>

  <p>He was not yet thirty, and had been commanding armies since he was
  eighteen; and, though he was so good looking and so amiable, with such a
  charming address and&mdash;when he chose&mdash;such caressing manners, his
  reputation was that of an unscrupulous, ruthless, arrogant and inflexible
  man. He had great gifts: those of energy, secrecy, indomitable courage; an
  unyielding fortitude and immutable patience. None of this showed in his
  appearance, which was splendid, superb and careful&mdash;almost to
  foppishness. He spent a great deal of the money that he made out of his
  successful campaigns and his various governments on lace and jewellery.</p>

  <p>Now, while he was waiting for the young Duke to speak, he was arranging
  the ruffles at his wrists, which were tied by wide black ribbons, and had
  been pulled awry by his gauntlets, which he had just removed. He had been
  reviewing the cavalry, and there was a speck or so of dust on the bullion on
  his cuffs. This he flicked away, still waiting for the Duke of Glückstadt to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"We think," stammered that young man at last, red in the face with passion
  and agitation, "that Madame Olshausen is the spy."</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis stared at the speaker, without any change in his
  expression.</p>

  <p>"She accompanies Your Highness everywhere. She would have ample
  opportunity to discover your secrets and to sell them," insisted the young
  German prince, "and those creatures can always be easily bought. It is the
  petition of all of us that Your Highness send away this woman."</p>

  <p>"But of course," replied Prince Clement Louis, with a mild courtesy which
  veiled a limitless arrogance, "it is quite impossible for us, my dear Duke,
  to discuss my private affairs. That is my answer to you all; and
  now"&mdash;he rose&mdash;"as I have an appointment with Madame
  Olshausen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've no doubt, Monseigneur," interrupted the young German obstinately.
  "And how do we know she will not, to-night, get everything out of you about
  the attack, about the reinforcements coming up&mdash;if she doesn't know it
  already! There have been a good many lives lost through this spy,
  Monseigneur, and we do not intend to stand by and see any more sacrificed. We
  demand that this woman be sent away, or at least arrested or watched."</p>

  <p>"Who is in this?" demanded Clement Louis. "All of you?"</p>

  <p>"All of us, Monseigneur. It is the common opinion of all of us, and it is
  noised abroad in the camp, even among the soldiers."</p>

  <p>"And yet it never occurred to me," remarked Prince Clement Louis coldly,
  "and certainly I am better acquainted with the lady than any of you could
  possibly be."</p>

  <p>The young Duke wanted to reply&mdash;but dared not: "But you sir, are
  obsessed, infatuate."</p>

  <p>"You have introduced," continued the Generalissimo smoothly, "a subject
  that&mdash;as I said at first&mdash;I could not possibly discuss with anyone.
  If I were to take what you say seriously, I should have to be offended, and
  treat your interference as insolence; and I have no wish to do that. You are
  either all of you deceived by some foolish gossip of the camp, or you wish to
  insult me. Whichever case it may be, I shall take no notice of your action,
  it would be beneath me to do so."</p>

  <p>"And we, I suppose, Monseigneur," replied the young man hotly, "are to
  wait here meekly and see all our plans go wrong&mdash;perhaps be murdered in
  our tents!"</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis picked up his gloves from the plain kitchen
  table.</p>

  <p>"Believe me," he smiled, "there is no danger whatever of that. For your
  own satisfaction I will tell you&mdash;and you may repeat it to your
  fellow-officers&mdash;that the woman is a fool, and absolutely incapable of
  what you suspect her; whoever this spy is, if there is a spy, it is some one
  of education and intelligence. Madame Olshausen knows no language but German;
  she can scarcely read or write; and she has just sufficient brains to keep
  out of all serious affairs. This is for your own satisfaction&mdash;to your
  formal embassy I have no formal answer; I absolutely decline to discuss my
  own affairs."</p>

  <p>The calm assurance with which he spoke almost shook the deep conviction of
  the young man. Was it possible that they had, after all, made a mistake? That
  all the little shreds and scraps of evidence which, put together, had pointed
  to Madame Olshausen as the spy, were wrong? And yet there were several of
  them, older, wiser, more experienced men than himself, who had assured him
  that it was she and no other, and that only the infatuation of Prince Clement
  Louis for his mistress prevented him from seeing what she really was&mdash;a
  spy in the pay of the English and Hanoverians.</p>

  <p>Hesitating, frowning, the young Duke said:</p>

  <p>"It was damned odd about that artillery train, and damned odd about the
  assault upon the glacis. If it happens again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was," agreed the Generalissimo calmly, "as you remark, Highness,
  damned odd...But I don't think it <i>will</i> happen again. It is possible,
  of course, that we have some traitor at work, though I've combed the camp
  pretty thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"Does your Highness know," persisted the young Duke doggedly, "the
  antecedents of Madame Olshausen? You took her from the stage when she was
  playing in the Italian comedy, under the name of Minetta; but who was she
  before that? Ask her, Monseigneur, if she was ever at the Elector of
  Hanover's Court, under the name of Madame Aurora Frey?"</p>

  <p>"The woman has never been at any Court," replied Prince Clement Louis
  contemptuously, "and are you telling me that you have been investigating her
  career?"</p>

  <p>"We have had to take measures of self-defence," replied the young man
  sullenly. "It was not until we had some very clear and good grounds to go
  upon that we ventured to approach Your Highness. We can, if you wish, put all
  our evidence before you; and we would appeal to you," he added with dignity,
  "to put your officers, your men and your Emperor before this woman."</p>

  <p>"I have never," replied Prince Clement Louis, "had any creature attached
  to me who would be likely to be the least danger to any cause. Please credit
  me with sufficient sense to know an intriguing woman of the world from a poor
  actress of the Comedy. There is really no more to be said."</p>

  <p>"There is a great deal more to be said," protested the young Duke, "but I
  understand from Your Serene Highness that it cannot be said without
  offence."</p>

  <p>"You are to understand exactly that," replied the Generalissimo. "I bid
  you good evening, or I shall be late for my appointment."</p>

  <p>"With Madame Olshausen?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely, with Madame Olshausen."</p>

  <p>"And what am I to tell the others?"</p>

  <p>"What you please, my dear Duke. You have heard what I have said, and you
  can gauge my sentiments and attitude. Any interference of the nature you
  suggest is grotesque. Do not force me to have to tell you all that it is
  dangerous as well."</p>

  <p>"You carry it with a very high hand, Monseigneur. It is our lives that
  hang on this matter."</p>

  <p>"And my honour; one will be regarded as jealously as the other. Good
  evening, Highness!" And Prince Clement Louis picked up his hat and left the
  farm, looking back with smiling malice at the discomfited and angry figure of
  the young Duke. His Serene Highness, with a light-coloured summer cloak over
  his gay uniform, rode rapidly to the pretty little pavilion where he had
  installed Madame Olshausen.</p>

  <p>For six months he had taken this woman with him everywhere, and he could
  not remember any connection of the kind which had endured so long. He utterly
  repudiated the idea that she in any way obsessed or infatuated him; but she
  certainly was charming, and he found in her company a satisfaction that he
  had never yet discovered in female society. Nothing could have amazed him
  more than what the young Duke of Glückstadt had just said to him. Practised
  as he was in social tact, it had been difficult for him to conceal this
  complete surprise, for Madame Olshausen, whom he had first seen dancing in
  the Italian comedy in Vienna, was the most inoffensive and foolish of
  creatures, and, as he had himself just declared, was totally
  illiterate&mdash;a peasant-girl with no training beyond that of the circus
  and the theatre; indeed, her complete ignorance of all worldly affairs had
  been one of her main attractions for him; who was always weighed with heavy
  responsibilities, faced by grave issues, and involved in many ramifications
  of statecraft. With her there had always been relief and pleasure; in her
  company life went lazily. She had an air of innocence and freshness, and in
  gratitude for her gift of lovely gaiety he had solicited from the Emperor a
  barony for his favourite. For the past three months she had held Olshausen
  and its important revenues.</p>

  <p>How lunatic were those men to suppose that he could possibly have thus
  favoured and protected a woman who was in the least likely to betray him! He
  was almost as sure of her loyalty as he was of her fidelity; but not quite:
  he was always prepared for any woman to betray him with another man, though
  so far he was not aware that this had happened&mdash;largely, he supposed,
  because there were few men who had qualities to render them formidable as
  rivals. He had always been the most powerful and the most charming
  personality of any society in which he mingled. Any woman of taste or
  judgment was not likely to forsake him; but he always allowed for caprice. If
  he had been told&mdash;or if, rather, he had discovered&mdash;that Minetta
  Olshausen had been unfaithful to him, he might have believed it without too
  much difficulty; but that she was betraying him&mdash;stealing and telling
  his most intimate secrets for money&mdash;he refused to credit for a
  second.</p>

  <p>Insolent stupidity to suggest such a thing! She was not capable of the
  mildest, most obvious, intrigues; why, he had been able to be completely at
  his ease with her&mdash;to say things before her&mdash;that he would have
  said before no one else; even, now he came to consider the matter (and he was
  bound to consider it a little after what the Duke of Glückstadt had said), to
  visit her with his code in his pocket, to leave important papers in his coat
  that hung all night in her chamber, to read letters in her presence and leave
  them lying on her dressing-table. She, a peasant from the Tyrol, knew nothing
  but that dialect, and a little German; Italian, and French, in which he
  usually corresponded, would be impossible for her to decipher.</p>

  <p>Certainly those men had been right in this: that, if she had been both
  intelligent and false, she had had considerable opportunities to betray
  him.</p>

  <p>The Prince was amazed at their impertinence, and did not quite know how to
  deal with it; he would force Madame Olshausen on them, of course, at every
  possible opportunity; he would give a supper, and invite them all, and set
  her at the head of the table. She should go with him everywhere. Her coach
  should have a prominent place at all reviews. He would induce the Emperor,
  when he had taken Mons and Brussels and could ask for more rewards, to make
  her a Duchess.</p>

  <p>Both his pride and his passion jumped in this. Minetta Olshausen pleased
  him so much that he was prepared to do anything for her save marry her: he
  believed that he loved her; he certainly could not think without a wrench at
  the heart, most uncommon to his cold temperament, of leaving her; and now, of
  course, he could not have left her without submitting to the dictations of
  his officers. She was secure in her position for a long time to come, through
  his arrogant pride if not through his affection. He decided, as he rode
  through the slender avenue which led to the little château she occupied, that
  he would make the most desperate efforts to discover who this spy was, and
  thus vindicate his judgment.</p>

  <p>It had been, as the young Duke had remarked, "damned odd" about the
  artillery surprise; and also about the attack on the St. Nicholas Gate; but
  if there were a spy at work, surely he, Prince Clement Louis, who had never
  failed in anything yet, could discover the odious traitor, and that without
  too much ado? As for the matter of this request of which Glückstadt had been
  the mouthpiece, he would have to break any officer who mentioned it to him
  again; or, if a ruling prince dared to do so, insult him to such an extent
  that he would return home.</p>

  <p>The <i>Generalissimo</i> could ill afford the withdrawal of any troops,
  but he would rather that half his forces left than be in any way dictated to
  by another. Madame Olshausen should stay even if the Confederacy fell to
  pieces; if need be, he reflected, he would leave the Emperor and obtain a
  command somewhere else. He was sufficiently famous to be able to demand his
  own terms. Poor young Glückstadt had spoken of a difficult situation which
  might arise to confound the nicest in judgment; and he had replied that he
  could not credit any such situation, which could not be efficiently dealt
  with by men of tact and breeding; and he smiled as he thought of the young
  Duke's embarrassment. There was no great difficulty about this particular
  situation: he knew how to deal with those generals of his, and also with
  Madame Olshausen.</p>

  <p>She was waiting for him in a room which she had already been able to
  render charming. Whenever she followed the army, she took with her a quantity
  of baggage; and whatever deserted mansion or devastated chateau might be put
  at her disposal she rendered it almost immediately civilized and delightful.
  Her few servants were installed with her, and a troop of Black Cuirassiers
  kept guard in the court of honour. Prince Clement Louis knew all the
  household and all the soldiers; they were particularly selected for this
  delicate work. As for the servants, not one of them could possibly be a
  traitor, for they all came from his own estate of Grafenburg Freiwaldau.</p>

  <p>She greeted him with the most tender affection, the most joyous delight,
  and with her own hands took off his mantle. She was finely blonde and as pale
  and exquisite as the most fragile manner of flower, and, dressed in fine,
  floating laces and shimmering blue ribbons (for she knew that he liked both
  laces and ribbons), and hung with pearls which were part of his lavish gifts
  to her, she appeared like a creature too ethereal for mere humanity.</p>

  <p>Supper was prepared and the pale candles lit. He saw to it that she was
  well-served. In everything he was fastidious and sumptuous.</p>

  <p>Madame Olshausen said she had been dull all day, that it was rather lonely
  and sad in the little pavilion in the thick woods, from which you could not
  even see the great fortress, nor the camp; but you could, she added, hear the
  guns firing, and there was something grim and frightening in that sound.</p>

  <p>"The next time there is a review," he replied, "you shall come to it; you
  would like that, would you not?"</p>

  <p>And she flushed with pleasure and cried out her gratitude; for never
  before had she received such an open honour.</p>

  <p>After supper, which His Serene Highness enjoyed without the least alloy in
  his pleasure, the cloth was drawn and a case of small models of soldiers set
  out; Prince Clement Louis carefully arranged these. They were one of his
  chief amusements, and often something more than an amusement; for he
  preferred to plan the disposition of his troops in this manner instead of on
  paper.</p>

  <p>Madame Olshausen sat on the arm of his chair and watched him as he quickly
  arranged the cavalry in small squads, one behind the other. He was already
  planning the manner of his state entry into Brussels, and he saw these small,
  lead figures magnified into the size of his Dragoons and Hussars, and the
  tiny metal flags into the grandeur of great standards, bearing the Imperial
  Eagles and his own arms and those of the Allies, and crowned with wreaths of
  laurels.</p>

  <p>"Ah, so sure of taking Brussels!" she laughed; and he answered:</p>

  <p>"Of course! I have never yet sat down before a town I have not taken."</p>

  <p>"But there's Mons in the way," smiled Madame Olshausen.</p>

  <p>"Mons will fall in a day, or two or three days."</p>

  <p>"You're expecting reinforcements?"</p>

  <p>And he, remembering the conversation with the young Duke of Glückstadt,
  was almost startled:</p>

  <p>"Did I tell you that, Minetta?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you told me that&mdash;how else could I know?"</p>

  <p>How else indeed? And he had always used the most careless freedom towards
  her, as he would have used it towards one of his own generals...or a
  fool.</p>

  <p>"Well," she laughed, putting her tiny hand caressingly on his epaulettes,
  "I hope we shall soon leave Mons. I want you very much to take this town, for
  I am rather weary of this little pavilion in the woods."</p>

  <p>"I come here," he smiled, "almost every night; it is only in the day time
  that you are alone. Are you beginning to be tired of following the army?"</p>

  <p>He turned to look at her as he spoke, and saw reflected an infinite
  passion in her candid eyes. He could not doubt that she loved him. He could
  scarcely doubt that he loved her...</p>

  <p>The Prince continued thoughtfully and with precision to arrange his
  military pieces. When he had them set out to his taste, he left them on the
  table and leant back in the deep chair with arms. He had realized that he was
  fatigued. He had been up with the dawn, inspecting the trenches. It was two
  nights since he had been able to repose himself in the little pavilion in the
  woods; and he asked Madame Olshausen to call his valet, and, when the man
  came, gave him his Orders, taking them off one by one: the Golden Fleece, the
  White Eagle of Poland, the White Eagle of Prussia, coveted stars and crosses
  that had been his since he was a boy.</p>

  <p>The valet took these away and locked them into a Chinese lacquer cabinet.
  Prince Clement Louis stood up to take off his heavy coat, and as he did so
  thought to put his hand in his pocket: there were some papers there,
  including that private cipher code that he never was without. He put all
  carelessly on the table beside the array of metal soldiers, and then he
  turned and went into the inner bedroom, which was so pleasantly lit by one
  silver lamp.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for that absurd conversation with the Duke of
  Glückstadt it never would have occurred to His Serene Highness to turn back
  and look at Madame Olshausen through the half-open door.</p>

  <p>She was still seated, so pale and airy and fair, on the arm of the big
  leather chair which he had just left; and she was bending over the soldiers,
  with her hands just hovering over those little squads of metal cavalry. He
  had not noticed, ever before, that she had shown any interest in those little
  toys of his; but was it over the soldiers her tiny hand was hovering?...Or
  over those papers that he had left&mdash;almost purposely left&mdash;for her
  inspection?</p>

  <p>She was certainly flicking over the papers, and now she looked round, and
  assured herself that she was alone&mdash;not seeing him in the shadow of the
  door, so slightly ajar; and now she was reading: surely, although she could
  scarcely read or write her native tongue, she was carefully and deliberately
  reading that French document! Prince Clement Louis waited...a moment, two
  moments, five moments; and still Minetta Olshausen was reading the papers he
  had left on the table.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that he had ever watched her, so sure and so
  careless had he always been in his dealing with the little Columbine. He went
  back into the bedroom, and considered. Of course, very likely there
  <i>was</i> nothing in it. In fact, it was absurd to think there was anything
  in it! She could not really have been reading. And that French paper had not
  been of any importance. What <i>was</i> of importance was in code, and it was
  ridiculous to suppose that she could de-code his cipher, the secret of which
  was known only to himself and his correspondents.</p>

  <p>He came back to her. She was half curled up in her chair, in her flounces
  and ribbons and pearls, and seemed almost asleep. He gathered up the papers
  quietly, and, with them in his hand, asked, with even more than his usual
  careless indifference in his manner:</p>

  <p>"You were never at the Court of Hanover, were you, under the name of
  Madame Aurora Frey?"</p>

  <p>She shuddered and stiffened; under her drooping lids her eyes gleamed as
  he had never seen them gleam before, but her self-command was admirable, She
  said:</p>

  <p>"Monseigneur, what do you mean? I do not know the name at all."</p>

  <p>The sound of the guns broke across the night: the usual night attack of
  the artillery on Mons.</p>

  <p>Madame Olshausen sprang up, nervously wringing her hands. She seemed about
  to weep.</p>

  <p>"I cannot endure it!" she cried. "It is so terrible, the cannonading day
  and night!"</p>

  <p>"But it has never upset you before," remarked Prince Clement Louis, never
  ceasing to watch her keenly.</p>

  <p>"It upsets me now!" she cried, throwing herself on to his breast; and that
  action heightened his suspicions. She would, of course, if she thought he
  doubted her, bring into play all the allurements which she knew affected
  him...endeavour to reduce him with every possible grace.</p>

  <p>She clasped him closely and began to sob a little, resting her exquisite
  head on his breast; and the Prince, returning this embrace, for purposes of
  his own, asked again:</p>

  <p>"You have never heard of Madame Aurora Frey?" He held her tightly, and
  this time he could have no doubt that the name caused her to stiffen. She
  became almost rigid in his arms.</p>

  <p>"No!" she gasped out at once. "Why will you tease me? Of course it means
  nothing to me, and I have never been to Hanover."</p>

  <p>"I thought not," he answered smoothly, "but some one mentioned that name
  to me to-day, and connected it with you."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" she asked too quickly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he replied, "since there is nothing in the story, eh,
  Minetta? It can be of no importance?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, of none," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Go to bed now," he said, disengaging himself from her, "and I will join
  you in a little while. I have some work to do still."</p>

  <p>She left him, obedient at once. Never had he known her anything but
  obedient. She appeared more than ever innocent and childlike and
  graceful.</p>

  <p>When she had left him, His Serene Highness sat for more than half an hour,
  carefully thinking, with no change in his expressionless face. Then he sent
  for Madame Olshausen's woman, Frau Dotler&mdash;a creature in whom he could
  have complete trust; and, sitting there in his brocaded dressing-gown by the
  table on which the lead soldiers stood undisturbed, he questioned her; and to
  every question received a satisfactory answer.</p>

  <p>Madame Olshausen neither sent nor received messages. She went out alone
  sometimes, certainly, but there was not the least reason to suspect her of
  any indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"You think her," asked Prince Clement Louis, "very simple and foolish and
  illiterate, do you not&mdash;a peasant girl, in fact&mdash;about the simplest
  creature that you've ever had charge of?"</p>

  <p>The woman said respectfully that so she did think.</p>

  <p>"So I believe myself," smiled His Serene Highness. "Now will you give me
  your keys, her keys and go to bed; and please see that someone is sent down
  to my headquarters for Dr. Hartmann? I shall require his attendance up here,
  say, in an hour's time."</p>

  <p>Having given these orders and received the keys of Frau Dotler and Madame
  Olshausen's keys brought from her dressing-table, Prince Clement Louis again
  sat silent a little while, turning many things over in his mind. They were
  very trivial-looking keys&mdash;nothing, as Frau Dotler had explained, was
  locked up save one cabinet, where the lady kept a few letters (those written
  by His Highness when they were separated by the vicissitudes of war) and a
  few of her more precious jewels.</p>

  <p>Before he proceeded to use these keys, he looked into the bed-chamber and
  saw her, by the light of the silver lamp, asleep. It was convenient that she
  should be asleep, and he always had been able to trust her to do the
  convenient thing.</p>

  <p>He unlocked the brass and tortoise-shell cabinet which the waiting-woman
  had indicated, and found therein what she had said he would find: letters,
  his own letters, and a few valuable pieces of jewellery; but he was skilful
  at careful searching, and acute in his observations; and in a few moments he
  had found something more than either letters or jewellery. In the flat bottom
  of the case that held a string of brilliants was a careful copy of the key to
  his private cipher, short transcripts in French of letters which he had
  lately sent, and a German version of the Italian despatch he had lately sent
  in code to Maréchal Monsanto.</p>

  <p>No further proof was needed: the woman was exactly what Glückstadt had
  said she was&mdash;what every one, save himself, had discovered her to be: a
  spy...an adroit professional spy.</p>

  <p>The first emotion that Prince Clement Louis felt was amazement at her
  sheer cleverness&mdash;her diabolical cleverness. She must be an educated,
  accomplished, clever woman, and she had passed herself off on him, who so
  prided himself on his knowledge of human nature, as an illiterate fool, and
  lulled him into an entire carelessness of which she had taken a deadly
  advantage. He remembered with a chill at his heart the assault on the
  Nicholas Gate which had so terribly failed; and his artillery train, ambushed
  and cut to pieces in the morass; and those two other secrets&mdash;she knew
  of them. Had she had a chance to betray them? He did not think so, for her
  woman had said that she had not left the pavilion for two days. She had
  lacked a chance. It was clear she employed no messenger&mdash;she was too
  subtle for that...probably she went herself to some rendezvous far beyond the
  lines, and delivered her information to some emissary of the enemy.</p>

  <p>He took the papers and destroyed them, replaced the jewellery carefully,
  and again locked up the brass and tortoise-shell cabinet.</p>

  <p>Who was she? Aurora Frey, of the Hanoverian Court? Minetta, of the Italian
  Comedy? the Baroness Olshausen, of Imperial creation? Who was she? He would
  not be likely ever to know now, nor did it greatly matter. A spy, and, with
  that appearance and that skill, worth her light weight in jewels twice over
  to whoever had the luck to employ her. And through it all she had loved him:
  he was convinced of that; and he loved her. Somewhere between them was a
  romantic dream which even this could not spoil; a deep passion which even
  this could not mar. But he had always been master, both of his dreams and of
  his passions. Never had they dominated him&mdash;nay, not only not dominated,
  never had they influenced him...</p>

  <p>And now, how to get out of this? He had boasted to young Glückstadt, that
  there was no situation, however complicated and delicate, from which a
  gentleman of tact and breeding and experience could not extricate himself. He
  would have to act at once. If he allowed her to-morrow, she would use it to
  betray him again.</p>

  <p>Two more heavy losses. Too more deep blows at his prestige and his pride.
  Enough to send all those murmuring officers and princes into open revolt. And
  he had his obligations towards them&mdash;already they had suffered
  profoundly through this woman of his, through his infatuation. Reinforcements
  must come up and the assault on Mons must be successful.</p>

  <p>He passed to the table and gazed at his array of metal soldiers. That
  triumphal entry into Brussels must not be jeopardized. He could have her
  arrested and put out of the reach of any further mischief; but to do so would
  mean to make himself an object of ridicule to all those men whom he
  considered&mdash;nay, whom he knew to be&mdash;his inferiors. How they would
  smile and sneer, even to his face..."We knew&mdash;we had to warn you before
  you noticed it! If Glückstadt hadn't spoken you'd have gone on in your
  blindness till we were all massacred in our tents. You, who were so
  impervious to feminine influence! How she took you in! She made such a fool
  of you that you talked openly in front of her, flung about your
  correspondence, even the key to your secret code!"</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life he would give these men the opportunity to
  sneer at him. A great many people had disliked&mdash;perhaps hated&mdash;him;
  but so far no one had been able to despise him; and he did not intend to give
  anyone, now, that excuse.</p>

  <p>The way out, then? The boasted tact and fortitude which he had told
  Glückstadt would help a gentleman out of any difficult situation?</p>

  <p>When the doctor arrived from the headquarters at the pavilion in the
  woods, he found His Serene Highness, still in the brocaded bedgown, seated by
  the table on which was that imposing array of lead soldiers. A carafe of
  water and some glasses were beside him, and he handled a rose-coloured phial
  which appeared to contain scent.</p>

  <p>"Your Serene Highness looks extremely pale," remarked the doctor with
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," replied Prince Clement Louis. "It is not for myself
  that I have sent for you, but for Madame Olshausen." And he led the way into
  the charming bedroom where this lady still lay asleep, and roused her with a
  pressure of his hand on her bare shoulder.</p>

  <p>"She was taken very ill at supper, my dear doctor. I was quite alarmed. A
  fit or seizure, followed by a great faintness. She has had these attacks
  before, but never so badly as to-night."</p>

  <p>The young woman sat up in bed, surprised and confused to see the doctor
  standing beside her lover. She appeared to glow not only with youth and
  beauty but with the uttermost bloom of health; but His Serene Highness
  remarked coolly:</p>

  <p>"You observe, doctor, how she is flushed with fever!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed," protested the lady in amaze. "I am perfectly well, and I do not
  know, Monseigneur, to what you refer."</p>

  <p>"It is quite usual," said the doctor, bowing, "for the patient to forget
  such attacks, madam. Now, if you permit me a prescription."</p>

  <p>The Prince interrupted:</p>

  <p>"I dare say there will be no need of that, if you think she seems well
  enough; but I thought I would like you to see her, my dear doctor. And now
  you are awake, Minetta, perhaps you would like a glass of
  chicory-water&mdash;it is a favourite refreshment of yours, and I have had
  some freshly prepared."</p>

  <p>"I would like it well enough," she said bewildered, "but indeed I do not
  know what this means! I am perfectly well!"</p>

  <p>"I hope," smiled the Prince, "that you do not deceive yourself." And he
  offered her the glass of water which he had held in his hand since he entered
  the chamber.</p>

  <p>She drank it hastily, and then he urged her to lie down and rest.</p>

  <p>"Now the doctor has seen you, I feel more at ease."</p>

  <p>The two men went into the outer chamber.</p>

  <p>"She seems, Monseigneur," began the doctor respectfully, "in perfect
  health."</p>

  <p>"She is not in perfect health; she is in a very dangerous state," said
  Prince Clement Louis; "and I must beg you, Dr. Hartmann, to remember it. You
  will please stay at the pavilion to-night; you may be required again. I have
  never consulted you for Madame Olshausen's health before, but that is not
  because I have not been anxious about it, but because she has such a dislike
  of physicians; but to-night the attack was too severe for me to ignore
  it."</p>

  <p>The doctor bowed, filled with a vague uneasiness, and, smilingly dismissed
  by His Serene Highness, retired.</p>

  <p>Prince Clement Louis returned to the table and the array of soldiers.
  Nothing would blemish that triumph; no one would be able to sneer at him...He
  put the pink phial carefully in an inner pocket of his brocaded gown. He had
  several such. They were certain legacies from his mother, who had been
  devoted to his interests. She had left, besides the phials, a curious
  reputation in most of the Courts of Europe, not unconcerned with the sudden
  deaths of notable personalities whose political interests were opposed to
  those of her employer; but she had been a great princess and a very beautiful
  woman.</p>

  <p>Looking at the pompous array of soldiery, Prince Clement Louis
  thought:</p>

  <p>"How shall I ever replace Minetta? How shall I ever find anyone so docile
  and obedient and delicious? And I am sure that she loves me as I love her; it
  could hardly be otherwise. But dreams and passions must not interfere with
  more important matters."</p>

  <p>What was a mistress compared to a city&mdash;or any woman compared to a
  successful campaign, a triumphal process, and the laurels gilded by the
  Emperor's gratitude? What was any love-affair, however charming, compared to
  the respect of his officers and his obligations towards them? Nothing&mdash;a
  grain of dust in the scale.</p>

  <p>Everything was silent in the pavilion in the woods. Prince Clement Louis
  went into the bedchamber of Minetta.</p>

  <p>Soon after dawn, the frightened Doctor Hartmann was roused by the Prince
  himself, standing at his bedside.</p>

  <p>"I told you you would probably be needed, doctor. Madame Olshausen is
  dead. She died suddenly just now, in my arms. An attack like that of last
  night. And it was over immediately, before I could call assistance."</p>

  <p>The doctor, in a panic, began to huddle on his clothes. He noticed that
  the Prince was partially dressed and seemed perfectly cool and unconcerned,
  though he was even paler than he had been last night.</p>

  <p>"Is Your Highness sure," he stammered, "that the lady is really dead? Some
  mistake, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said Prince Clement Louis. "There can be no possibility
  of mistake."</p>

  <p>Through the quiet rooms of the pretty little pavilion the two men went to
  the bedchamber of Madame Olshausen. The sun was already shining in the trees,
  which pressed quite close to the open windows; and the birds were singing in
  the pale, light leafage. But in her room the curtains had been drawn.</p>

  <p>She was certainly dead, in her frivolous laces and ribbons, half-naked in
  the charming, disarrayed luxury of her coquettish bed; and His Serene
  Highness, gazing down at her, remarked:</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear doctor, I was quite correct in my opinion as to her
  state of health?"</p>

  <p>And the doctor muttered, not caring to look up into the cold, reserved
  face of the Prince:</p>

  <p>"Monseigneur, you were perfectly right."</p>

  <p>The attack on Mons was successful. In three days the city fell. The relief
  coming up under Maréchal d'Orbitello was not ambushed. The pride of the
  <i>Generalissimo</i> was in no way blown upon. With the death of Madame
  Olshausen all cause of discontent and complaint was removed. She had a
  pompous funeral, and he his triumphal entry into Brussels. If his lonely
  spirit was at times struck by shafts of a surprising agony, he had the
  satisfaction of knowing that he had dealt successfully with a very delicate
  situation.</p>

     id="ch-05-2"></a>A PROMENADE IN THE COLISEUM</h2>

  <h3>(Passegiata nel Coloseo)</h3>

  <p class="quote"><i>A design by Giovanni Battista Piranési for an Almanac
  by John Evelyn, Esquire.</i> [ROME, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann had come to Italy to study gardening and see what choice
  rarities he might bring back with him to adorn the parterres of the German
  prince who employed him; Herr Stoppelmann was a very learned pedant, and knew
  more about horticulture than any wise man would seek to know about
  anything.</p>

  <p>He had been sent to Rome by a fellow enthusiast, who told him to search
  among the ruins of the Coliseum and the Forum for a certain bell-shaped
  flower of a curious greenish, milky hue, belonging to the species of a Brumal
  jacinth, the bulbs of which were very difficult to obtain; but which, when
  once planted in a rich, loamy soil, covered in the winter with dry straw or
  peasehame, would, in the spring, bloom into a plant that would grace any
  Royal garden.</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann had stayed several days in Rome, and searched the ruins,
  but had found no trace of any but common weeds. It was not a good season of
  the year for such as shared Herr Stoppelmann's enthusiasm, for the farewell
  frosts and nipping winds were prejudicing the choicest flowers and spotting
  them with freckles; and the alternating of these yet continuing frosts and
  sharp winds, with the sudden quick, piercing heat of the sun, scorched and
  destroyed those delicate flowers which Herr Stoppelmann had come expressly to
  Italy to see expanding their loveliness under the native azure of their
  translucent skies.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that some one on whose opinion he did not very much
  rely&mdash;and yet who had spoken with a certain conviction&mdash;had told
  Herr Stoppelmann to promenade the Coliseum by moonlight, and then he would
  very likely see his Brumal jacinths growing by this silvery light of night,
  and coloured, not white (said his informant), but purple or crimson, and of a
  far fairer and more exquisite beauty than its milky pale fellow. And
  therefore, on this sharp evening of early Italian spring, which would in any
  other country have yet been winter, Herr Stoppelmann, soberly dressed in his
  russet and black, and with a number of his inseparable books in a strap
  tucked under his arm, walked round the ruins of the Coliseum&mdash;which,
  black as it was against the pale moonlit sky, almost frightened him by the
  immensity of its shape and the grandeur of its design. It dwarfed all
  buildings to a pitiful insignificance he had ever seen or ever imagined, and
  made him, for the first time in his life, wonder if his particular duty and
  passion of horticulture was of that preeminent importance which he had
  hitherto considered it to be.</p>

  <p>"If I had not been a florist," he mused, sitting on one of the large
  fallen stones and gazing round the arena, "I would have liked to be an
  architect."</p>

  <p>He did not see his pursued flower growing in the crevices of any of the
  fallen ruins, nor adorning the mighty walls which yet rose undefiled,
  undefaced by time. He saw silvery, silky weeds and brambles and pallid
  daisies, nipped by the frost, black and white hellebore, wicked, poisonous
  plants; and here and there a scattering of white violets, where the stones
  overlapped one another and had formed, by their shelter, a damp, mossy
  shelter: all these Herr Stoppelmann perceived through the pale, misty light
  of the frosty moonshine, but he found no Brumal jacinth, nor any rarity which
  resembled that coveted variety.</p>

  <p>So he was sitting, now fatigued, and presently took out his books,
  unstrapped them, and by this same moonlight began to read one of
  them&mdash;<i>Kalendarium Hortense</i>&mdash;which was a classic English book
  on gardening and he in his leisure, was translating it into German; he opened
  it at the thumb-marked passage which he was at present digesting:</p>

  <p class="letter"><i>"How to take off a reproach which Box may lie under,
  otherwise a most beautiful and useful Shrub for Edging, and other Ornaments
  of a Coronary garden, because its scent is not agreeable to many. If,
  immediately upon Clipping, when only it is most offensive, you Water it, the
  Smell vanishes and is no more considerable..."</i></p>

  <p>So absorbed was Herr Stoppelmann in this book&mdash;to translate which had
  been so agreeable yet arduous a pleasure to him, and which he had prefaced
  with seven pages of dedication to his master, <i>His Serene Electoral
  Highness</i>&mdash;that he was considerably startled to look up and see two
  men regarding him with downcast looks and folded arms: two masked men in
  cloaks. And Herr Stoppelmann realized, with an unpleasant start, that he was
  alone in the Coliseum by night, and that he had heard it was a place of no
  good repute, much frequented by <i>banditti</i> and assassins.</p>

  <p>Having been educated at Leyden, Herr Stoppelmann of course knew all the
  languages in Europe, and almost everything else there was to know besides;
  therefore he addressed the two strangers in a flowing Tuscan, and asked them
  rather timidly if they had any business with him?</p>

  <p>"Well, we don't know yet," replied one of them in another
  dialect&mdash;that of the <i>Romagna</i>&mdash;"we were rather amused to see
  you here, sitting one a stone and reading a book. Couldn't you find a more
  comfortable place or a more comfortable occupation?"</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann rose and bowed. His nervousness had been increased by the
  fact that he noticed the two strangers were shabby, heavily armed, and wore
  strips of black ribbon tied rather negligently over the upper portions of
  their faces, as if they wished to be masked and yet could hardly take the
  trouble to disguise themselves.</p>

  <p>"I am," said the German, "a horticulturalist and an antiquarian. I have
  come here to look for a flower which is said to bloom on the Roman
  ruins&mdash;but that will not interest you: in fact I was already convinced
  that I came on a fool's errand, and I was merely passing the time, because
  the spot was so imposing and the light so clear. In fact," he added
  nervously, "there is no reasonable explanation at all of why I am here. I
  fell into habit and took out a book I am translating, and proceeded to read
  it."</p>

  <p>"I should read it at home, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"I am not at home here," said Herr Stoppelmann, who had a liking for
  exactitude of phrase. "I am staying at an inn&mdash;'The Three White
  Horses'&mdash;it is not far."</p>

  <p>"Return, then, my dear fellow," said one of the strangers, "to the Three
  White Horses,' and ask them to gallop you away out of Rome as quickly as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand the drift of your jest," said Herr Stoppelmann, "but
  I am quite willing to leave the Coliseum to you. It no longer has very much
  interest for me&mdash;in fact, I find it rather overwhelming."</p>

  <p>One of the strangers had now thrust his hand into the leather bag he wore
  strapped round his waist, and brought out a handful of coins.</p>

  <p>"If you are an antiquarian," he remarked, "perhaps you would care to buy
  these. I have dug them up in my promenades round the Roman ruins."</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann looked eagerly at the treasure, and found many of the
  coins were of the first importance&mdash;though only of interest to a
  collector.</p>

  <p>"How much do you want for these?" he asked, forgetting his fear of the two
  strangers in his eagerness to acquire these curios, which he was quite sure
  he could re-sell at a very handsome profit to His Serene Electoral Highness,
  who had an obsession for this manner of rarity.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he was prepared to bargain, the other two sat down on the
  stones near to Herr Stoppelmann, spread out the coins and proceeded to argue
  in the most amiable fashion about their value and their price; Herr
  Stoppelmann getting the antiques for what he believed to be far less than
  they were worth, and the others selling them for far more than they had ever
  hoped to obtain, the three became good friends, and chatted amiably
  together&mdash;especially when the two Italians produced a flask of <i>Aqua
  Vita</i> and pledged the professor in the fiery refreshment: while they
  civilly drank to the exchange of these ancient coins of the Roman Emperor for
  present coins of His Holiness the Pope&mdash;of good negotiable value in the
  inns of Rome.</p>

  <p>The liquor was of extraordinary potency, and Herr Stoppelmann, between the
  effects of it and the pleasure of having secured the antiquities (which now
  lay comfortably in his pocket) became quite garrulous, and told the friendly
  and agreeable strangers&mdash;whose manner was so much more pleasant than
  their rather sinister appearance&mdash;all about his journey to Italy and his
  search for rare plants, and he became so encouraged by the sound of his own
  words as almost to believe himself in a professorial chair in a Dutch
  university, talking to a large number of students.</p>

  <p>So he began to discourse gravely on how cats will eat and destroy <i>Marum
  Syriacum</i>, if they can come at it; therefore it is best to guard it with
  furze or holly branch, together with other secrets not till now divulged, he
  declared pompously; how tuber roses will not endure the wet of September,
  therefore they are best set in pots, wrapped in papers, and put up the
  chimney; how the first ripe pear is, rightly treated, the Hamden Bergamot,
  and the first for baking the Arundel pear, while the most excellent is the
  Louis pear; and so he discoursed to a polite if inattentive audience, and
  pleased by the manner in which these two men&mdash;who looked so ruffianly
  and acted in so gentlemanly a fashion&mdash;sat and listened to him, Herr
  Stoppelmann at last asked them if it was entirely the charms of his eloquence
  that held them there in the Coliseum at this hour of the night?...and they
  answered, "No, they had some other business."</p>

  <p>"We are not only gentlemen of leisure," confessed one, "nor do we entirely
  make our living by selling the coins and curios which we dig up in the ruins
  of Rome. We may be hired for private and intimate affairs."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Herr Stoppelmann, rather checked in his discourse. "You are
  not, I suppose, assassins?" At which the two masked men smiled with a
  deprecating air.</p>

  <p>"We, on occasion, do undertake work of that kind," admitted one. "But
  there is no need for you to disturb yourself, for you are not the victim whom
  we are out to seek to-night."</p>

  <p>At this Herr Stoppelmann was considerably startled, and the discourse on
  horticulture died away on his lips. He even made a hasty attempt to rise, but
  his two companions detained him courteously.</p>

  <p>"I cannot be a party to murder," cried Herr Stoppelmann, whose brain was a
  little confused by the Aqua Vita, and who scarcely knew what he was saying,
  yet felt he had heard something about which he must protest. He could not,
  however, make his escape, for one of the gentlemen who had admitted to being
  an assassin was holding him by the cloak, and he saw, at this moment, a third
  man coming to join them, at which his blood ran very cold indeed with a nasty
  bitter fear.</p>

  <p>The two gentlemen who detained him, however, told him that the newcomer
  was no friend of theirs.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps however," stammered the German, "he is your victim."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind&mdash;our victim will be walking with a lady."</p>

  <p>The new-comer had now joined them, and seeing that they were alone in the
  vast arena of the Coliseum and that he was passing them so close, it seemed
  only civil for him to salute them&mdash;which he did with a very gracious
  air, and even paused and made some conventional remark about the clarity of
  the moonlight and the grandeur of the Coliseum.</p>

  <p>"I hope," he added, "that you are not molesting this gentleman," and he
  smiled agreeably at Herr Stoppelmann and touched his sword&mdash;for he was a
  young and vigorous man, obviously of noble birth, and armed both with rapier
  and pistol.</p>

  <p>The two assassins bowed in recognition of his quality, and declared that
  they were hearing a most elevating discourse from the other gentleman, who
  was a horticulturalist in search of a certain flower which was supposed only
  to bloom on Roman ruins.</p>

  <p>"And we have taken the occasion to sell him some Roman coins which we
  discovered in the Forum," said one. "There is nothing in all this to disturb
  your Excellency."</p>

  <p>"But you are perhaps waiting for some unfortunate," remarked the stranger.
  "I have heard that the Coliseum is a most dangerous place at night."</p>

  <p>"Why then, does your Lordship wander in it unprotected?" asked one of the
  assassins pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied the stranger with a certain languor, as if any
  place was of indifference to him, "I came to Rome to keep an appointment, and
  I am rather too early. So to fill in the time I thought I would walk in the
  Coliseum and see the moonlight."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Herr Stoppelmann looked at him with some relief. He was glad
  to have a companion, and to be no longer alone in the society of the two
  admitted assassins. It was all very well reading about such affairs in the
  comfort of one's chamber, but he had no wish to be an actor in one of the
  innumerable scenes of violence that he had often heard disgraced the streets
  and the ruins of Rome.</p>

  <p>The stranger was youthful and handsome, though without much fire or
  animation. He seemed as one lazy in his wishes and languid in his desires. He
  carried himself gracefully and with a certain careless nobility, and he was
  finely dressed in expensive travelling clothes. His hair appeared to be newly
  dressed and powdered, and was clasped by a paste buckle&mdash;very
  recklessly, Herr Stoppelmann thought. There was also paste, or maybe
  diamonds, in the young man's laces, but he eyed the assassins coolly, as if
  not in the least apprehensive of any danger from them.</p>

  <p>"Truly," he remarked disdainfully, "Rome is very badly governed when it is
  possible for gentlemen like you to lurk here waiting for their victim,
  uninterrupted."</p>

  <p>He then addressed the German:</p>

  <p>"And you, my good sir, had better come with me. You are hardly in the most
  desirable of company."</p>

  <p>The two assassins shrugged their shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One must live," one of them remarked carelessly. "We do very well for
  ourselves, and no more harm to others than anyone else, I think. We are very
  practised in our work, and our victim dies instantly&mdash;just a stroke
  between the shoulder-blades, and all his troubles are over. We then take him
  up and very neatly convey him through the streets, making him look like a
  sack of rubbish, and drop him into the Tiber. There the current is rapid and
  the waters are muddy, and likely enough he is not found again."</p>

  <p>"Or washed up into the drains, perhaps," mused the young man, with a
  shudder. "Whom are you waiting for to-night?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman who will be presently promenading here with a lady," answered
  one of the assassins.</p>

  <p>"Then I must stay and protect him," replied the young man, "for the lady's
  sake, if not for his."</p>

  <p>Upon this both the assassins laughed.</p>

  <p>"For the lady's sake!" they cried. "It's the lady who has paid
  us&mdash;and paid us well&mdash;to make away with the gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Ah, her husband!" exclaimed the young man, with an accent of surprise and
  slight horror.</p>

  <p>"No, in this case it is not her husband, but her lover. I believe the
  affair touches politics&mdash;but that is nothing to do with us. If you, sir,
  are an adventurer, as we are, perhaps you would care to join in the business
  and share the reward?"</p>

  <p>"That is a strange suggestion to make to me," remarked the young man.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can hardly be an honest traveller, your Excellency," smiled one
  of the assassins, bowing again, "or you would not be walking here at this
  time of night. There's many a year that I've known the Coliseum, and I've
  never seen an honest man in it by moonlight yet, unless he's been lured here
  to meet his end, just like the gentleman whom we have to deal with to-night
  will be lured here by the lady."</p>

  <p>The young man considered thoughtfully, and then shrugged his shoulders. It
  was none of it his business. He had a most important appointment to keep, and
  could not by any means remain in the Coliseum and help this unknown stranger
  to free himself from the trap that was awaiting him. Besides, perhaps he
  deserved it. The young man always made a chivalrous point of being on the
  side of the ladies, and if the lady had decreed the assassination, perhaps
  she was justified in doing so. He thought to himself: "If I see a couple
  proceeding round the ruins, I will warn the gentleman and risk the lady's
  displeasure. If I see a guardia', I will tell him that there is a crime
  meditated in the Coliseum. If I see neither of these things, I will go to my
  rendezvous and forget all about it." He could not, of course, be too
  severe&mdash;there were certain turns of good fortune in his own life that he
  owed to assassination.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he remarked after he had made these reflections, "you have no
  objection to my continuing my way?" And both the assassins said politely that
  they had no objection whatever.</p>

  <p>"We never interfere, as a matter of professional honour, with any but
  those whom we are paid to attack," they assured him. "And whatever your
  business is, we are assured that it is no more lawful than ours, and you may
  go on it undisturbed."</p>

  <p>"It certainly," admitted the young man, with an elegant smile, "is no more
  lawful than yours. You are right there, and we may consider ourselves, I
  suppose, birds of a feather." And he lifted his plumed hat and bowed to the
  three of them.</p>

  <p>But Herr Stoppelmann sprang forward and caught him by the flowered brocade
  of his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir, do not leave me in the Coliseum. These gentry are very
  courteous, but I should be glad to be rid of their company."</p>

  <p>"I will see you to the street," said the stranger, "and then I am afraid I
  must leave you, for I have&mdash;as I believe I have already remarked&mdash;a
  very important appointment."</p>

  <p>The two assassins allowed them to depart without any attempt to interfere
  with them.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary country," gasped Herr Stoppelmann as they made
  their way carefully over the half-ruined seats of the Coliseum.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," said the young man. "I have lived here nearly all my
  life."</p>

  <p>"In Rome, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, not in Rome, but in Italy. One gets used to these things. Who are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I," said Herr Stoppelmann with some pomposity, "am in the employment of a
  German prince whose name I do not feel at liberty to divulge. Politics, you
  know, my dear sir&mdash;politics."</p>

  <p>The young man caught his arm, for he was stumbling over a large block of
  masonry in his way.</p>

  <p>"I am writing a book," gasped the horticulturalist, when he had recovered
  his breath. "<i>Hortus Deliciarum</i>." And then he began to relate of his
  search for the flower, white in most places, but purple when found in the
  Coliseum by moonlight.</p>

  <p>The young man laughed. "There's a double meaning in that, I think."</p>

  <p>They had now left the gigantic ruins, and stood on the ground outside,
  where was the half-fallen fountain where the gladiators used to wash their
  wounds; and beyond, the facade of some baroque houses&mdash;flat, white,
  adorned with wreaths of fruit, with green blinds drawn against the
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>The young man took a diamond studded watch, round as an apple, from his
  breast-pocket, and looked at the time.</p>

  <p>"I am due for my appointment," he observed civilly, "and now sir, I must
  bid you good night. I would willingly escort you to your inn, but I have not
  time."</p>

  <p>"May I not know your name?" said the German, bowing, "so that I can thank
  you personally."</p>

  <p>"Call me," said the young man, "Porphyrios."</p>

  <p>Slightly apart from the other silent shuttered houses the silent shuttered
  house with the green <i>persianes</i> faced the gigantic circle of the
  Coliseum. To reach this Porphyrios had to pass two monstrous pillars, above
  which the acanthus leaves scrolled round the capitals like frozen waves, and
  where all the hard, curling fronds were picked out by the moonlight into hard
  shapes of black and white. Beneath these pillars, on a waste of ground, grew
  some ragged grass, and a herdsman, clad in goatskins, sat there asleep; while
  three white kids browsed round his feet.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios paused, and looked at this and at the house he was about to
  visit. He was on a foolish errand, but life without folly was hardly
  conceivable to one of his temperament. He had been for years in love with a
  woman who had blighted his fairest prospects, alienated his best friends and
  overclouded his reputation in its tenderest point. He had finally, after a
  due consideration of all these facts, dismissed her, and she had come to Rome
  and married, on the strength of the pension that Porphyrios had allowed her,
  an old man with a ruined reputation and an ancient name. So he (Porphyrios)
  was well rid of a dangerous love affair, and yet not in the least
  rid&mdash;for he must secretly write to the lady and beg to see her again,
  seeking out the chains from which he had with such difficulty delivered
  himself; and she had told him that she had too many enemies to be able to
  venture abroad, but that if he cared to come to Rome she would meet him, and
  she named this house near the Coliseum, which was a <i>caffè</i> and
  sweetstuff shop, and had rooms above&mdash;let easily for obscure and
  difficult interviews.</p>

  <p>To come to Rome had been to come into a city of enemies. He was therefore
  in disguise, but he might be recognized. When he had seen the two assassins
  just now, waiting in the Coliseum, he had believed they were for him. He had
  not been afraid to meet them, for he was well armed; but he had been rather
  relieved to discover that he was not their destined victim. Now he paused,
  and wondered how his foolish adventure would end, and if Antonia Camilla was
  worth the risk he took.</p>

  <p>The <i>caffè</i> that Porphyrios approached, and above which were the
  rooms where he would meet his beloved, was not&mdash;as might be
  supposed&mdash;of the better sort, for this was a dangerous and avoided
  neighbourhood; but it was famous for the making of sweetmeats, and, in the
  day-time, many gallants would throng there to buy gifts for their mistresses.
  Soon after the dusk fell it was deserted, and now the doors were closed and
  there was only a dim light coming between the lattice of the shutters.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios pushed the door and entered into a small white room, set with
  chairs and tables, and the walls painted with arabesques surrounding figures
  of dancing girls. The air was heavy and sickly with the smell of hot sweets,
  and on the table were many delicacies ready for sale on the morrow, such as
  cream toast or <i>pain perdu</i>, blancmanges, jellies, orange pudding,
  bateleo pie, sullebubs, marchpain, chocolate creams, salladmagundy and pippin
  frazes&mdash;all these set out temptingly in clear silver or glass
  dishes.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios crossed this room and opened a door at the back, which stood
  ajar, and looked into the kitchen, where a fair and plump young girl was
  making jelly, straining some finely-clarified lemon-juice of a pure white
  colour into a swan-skin jelly-bag, which hung on a clean saucepan; the
  lemon-juice poured out as clear as rock-water; while over a charcoal fire an
  old woman was stirring hard some boiling cream, and pouring on it a mazarine,
  and flavouring it with a piece of cinnamon&mdash;all of which made a medley
  of potent, sweet perfume in the close air.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are the gentleman for whom the lady waits upstairs," cried the
  old woman. "You go up one flight and stop at the first door. She has been
  here half an hour."</p>

  <p>"But I," smiled Porphyrios, "am punctual to my appointment."</p>

  <p>The old woman and the young girl looked at him curiously, each pausing in
  their delicate, frivolous labours.</p>

  <p>"You are not masked," they remarked, "and we should know your face
  again."</p>

  <p>Porphyrios thought it had possibly been very foolish of him to come
  unmasked, and yet it scarcely mattered, and he was of a temperament that
  finds it most difficult to take precautions. He would rather face the
  consequences of imprudence than be at the trouble to be prudent.</p>

  <p>So he went up the narrow stairs boldly, as one embarked on a just design,
  and knocked at the first door he came to; and her familiar voice said
  "Enter!" And when he had entered and seen her, he did not grudge his pains,
  or his long, tedious travel, for she seemed to him to represent all the
  grandeur of Nature and all the profuseness of God in sending beauty on to the
  earth&mdash;for of grace and fairness and gaiety and voluptuous charm she had
  an amazing plenty, and she always roused in the breast of Porphyrios a
  gratitude to heaven for the gift of her, for she was more noble and sumptuous
  than any woman, not only that he had beheld in the flesh, but whom he had
  beheld through the imagination of artists and poets, painted or described;
  and he had always cherished her as a great rarity, which perhaps a hundred
  years would not produce again. It was true he owed himself a certain
  compliment for the discernment which made him perceive these manifold charms,
  for he had taken her from an obscure&mdash;even a shameful&mdash;position.
  Therefore her lustre shone all the more brightly in contrast to the dingy
  nothingness from which she had sprung.</p>

  <p>All this was quickly in his mind as he stood inside the door and looked at
  her again, as she sat on a yellow sofa with her hands folded in her lap and
  her mantle disposed decorously over her shoulders; but he knew that when she
  took the mantle off her bosom would be bare.</p>

  <p>All this was Antonia Camilla to Porphyrios, and because of her he had
  abandoned everything&mdash;things of great moment and sharp import&mdash;to
  come all this tiresome way from Florence to Rome, at peril of more than his
  life; yet to others she was but an ordinary woman, and to some she was very
  detestable.</p>

  <p>"I never thought you would come," she smiled, staring at him, and her note
  was more one of triumph than of welcome.</p>

  <p>"Why did you make this appointment?" he asked, scarcely caring what remark
  he made, so long as he had the exquisite pleasure of talking to her
  again.</p>

  <p>"It was difficult for me to get to Rome, and this house is in a dangerous
  spot&mdash;even for Rome."</p>

  <p>"Could I receive you in my own palace?" she asked, "when you have given me
  a jealous old husband?</p>

  <p>"I give you!" he protested. "My dear Camilla, you married the man
  yourself&mdash;it was your own idea."</p>

  <p>"What was I to do?" asked the lady mournfully. "Since you dismissed me, I
  had to seek another protector."</p>

  <p>He did not remind her of her pension. Why ruin with recriminations this
  delicious moment of reunion? He took his seat beside her on the sofa, and
  with a sigh unclasped her cloak and laid his head on her bare bosom; and she
  caressed his smooth cheek and long curls with familiar tenderness.</p>

  <p>"I would not have believed," he sighed, "that you could so soon forget an
  injury."</p>

  <p>"An injury?" she repeated, as if she had never heard the word before.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Camilla, of course I did you a gross injury when I sent you away from
  Florence, and I thought you would revenge it on me by refusing to see me
  again."</p>

  <p>"Revenge?" repeated the lady again as if the word was alien.</p>

  <p>"Do not let us talk of such ugly things, my love. Only tell me that you
  love me still and are pleased to see me again." And he ended with pleading in
  his voice.</p>

  <p>"The fact that I am here is sufficient to show that I still love you,"
  said the lady mournfully. "I also take risks, though I am, compared to you,
  Porphyrios, a most unimportant person. But my husband has his notions of
  honour, even though he knows my past history he is very jealous of my newly
  acquired virtue, and if he should discover that I had given you an
  assignation here, my life would not be safe for half an hour. He is an adept
  in removing those he dislikes."</p>

  <p>"Why," exclaimed Porphyrios, half angry, "did you marry such a
  narrow-minded and dangerous man? However, we will not trouble ourselves about
  him&mdash;I want you to return with me to Tuscany."</p>

  <p>"But you also are going to be married, are you not?" said the lady; and
  she rose from the sofa and began to set out a service of silvered porcelain.
  "You will need some coffee and refreshments," she smiled. "You must have come
  a long and tedious way."</p>

  <p>"I am to be married, it's true," agreed Porphyrios sullenly, "but that, as
  you know, is a matter of State. I shall see as little as possible of my new
  wife, who is thirty years old, plain and bigoted; and you shall have
  precedence on all possible occasions."</p>

  <p>"In short," said Camilla delicately, "your discarded mistress will return
  in triumph. What will all your friends and my enemies say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I do not care what they say," said Porphyrios. "I want you above
  everything. Life goes to a different melody when you are near me." And he
  looked with the greatest gratification at her extraordinary beauty, as she
  moved about preparing the coffee.</p>

  <p>The room was a charming setting to these remarkable charms of hers, for it
  had been arranged, with some art, as a temple for sweet, stolen interviews
  and delicious private love affairs. The walls were covered with pale green
  watered silk; the furniture was delicate and gilded; the tables were of pale
  alabaster; the couches were piled with down cushions and the windows were
  hung with thick velvet curtains; and there were many mirrors on the walls, so
  that the occupants of the secret chamber above the sweet shop should be able
  to see themselves and the object of their adoration in all the delicious
  attitudes of surrendered love, repeated again and again from every possible
  angle.</p>

  <p>"It is six months since we have seen each other," mused Antonia Camilla,
  "and you are not in the least changed."</p>

  <p>"But you are more beautiful," declared Porphyrios, "even than my fervent
  longing painted you; and if you will only return to Florence I will put
  Tuscany beneath your feet."</p>

  <p>At this he rose and would have taken her in his arms, but she put him by,
  saying he would spill her coffee, which she had just heated and which was
  giving out a pungent aroma. But Porphyrios would have none of this, and took
  his beloved frankly in his arms, and held her close and told her all her
  praises, and how he would never allow her out of his sight again, and what he
  would do for her when he had her again in Florence; and how she should set
  her foot on all who had opposed her and called her wanton and profligate and
  extravagant, and even spy. He would dispose them in their several places, and
  listen no more to their vicious conversations; he would even force them to
  promise to do her homage. How she should live in every profuseness and
  magnificence, and be the greatest, noblest figure in all Tuscany!</p>

  <p>Antonia Camilla listened to this with downcast eyes. "And what title have
  I to all this greatness?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios replied:</p>

  <p>"Your whole title is that you continue to love me."</p>

  <p>"Can one control love?" said the lady softly. "Does it come and go as one
  calls it&mdash;if one is once cast off, can one come back again? I am married
  now to an old and jealous man, who rates me pretty high."</p>

  <p>"But not so high as I do," cried Porphyrios with some indignation, still
  holding her close. "And who is he? We may pension him or remove him. You are
  my incomparable love, and nothing more must be set between us."</p>

  <p>"All extremes are pernicious," said the lady. "Love me with more
  moderation." And she escaped from him and served him with his coffee.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios, looking all round the room, saw her loveliness repeated again
  and again in the many mirrors, and felt grateful towards whoever had hung
  them there, so admirably to extol his lady's beauty by reflecting it so
  often; then Porphyrios, waiting in delight for the return of all the joys he
  had once known with this lady, wondered idly if he really knew her, and if
  any of the images he saw reflected round the room were the lady herself. He,
  indeed, was aware of nothing about her save the fact that she inspired him
  with love. She might be sordid and covetous, violent and mean, for all he
  knew of her&mdash;and what did it matter?</p>

  <p>The lady now approached him, and when he had drunk his
  coffee&mdash;looking on her the while with doting glances of extreme
  love&mdash;she said:</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful night, and I feel stifled in this room. The moonlight
  is delicious, and I suggest that we should take a promenade in the
  Coliseum?"</p>

  <p>Porphyrios set his coffee-cup back on the tray, and the lady perceived
  that the look on his face had become fixed, and was no longer soft and
  melting, but of an odd hardness. However, he said quietly:</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you wish, we will take a promenade in the Coliseum."</p>

  <p>He rose at once and put on his hat and cloak.</p>

  <p>"You are not offended, are you?" asked the lady, a little aggrieved by his
  coldness and the sudden change that had come upon the ardour of his
  glances.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am not offended," he replied; and he looked again round the
  mirrors at all the images of Antonia Camilla.</p>

  <p>They went down the silent stairs and through the shop that was filled with
  sweetmeats waiting to be sold on the morrow, and out into the open space
  where were the two ruined columns, the sleeping goatherd and the kids, and
  past the fountain where the gladiators washed their wounds, till they came to
  the Coliseum; and all the while the lady hung on his arm.</p>

  <p>They entered the intense darkness of one of the entrance arches, and came
  out on to the wide brightness of the arena, filled with tumbled masonry and
  tall trees, and shrubs and plants, all misted and grey in the moonlight. But
  Antonia Camilla said that she did not wish to wander there, but to promenade
  above the tiers of the boxes, and particularly to the Imperial box above the
  main entrance, where the Emperor used to sit; and this was precisely where
  Porphyrios had seen the two assassins waiting.</p>

  <p>He did not move when the lady expressed this desire, but sat down on one
  of the stones and thought of how he had treated Antonia Camilla, casting her
  away with a pension to a marriage with an old man; and how unlikely it was
  that she would never forgive this. How little he had known of her to expect
  that she would forgive it, and what a complete fool he had been to come from
  Florence to Rome to trust himself to this wronged woman!</p>

  <p>The lady became impatient.</p>

  <p>"We shorten the night," she said, "by dallying too long here. Will you not
  come and make my favourite promenade with me?"</p>

  <p>This time he rose, and allowed her to conduct him to the ruins of the
  Imperial box. How dark and gigantic the Coliseum looked, and how clear and
  bright was the sky above, and how strange their destiny&mdash;these two
  lovers, one conducting the other to the place where two assassins lurked; and
  when they had nearly reached it, Porphyrios paused and said:</p>

  <p>"This is a melancholy spot for us to say good-bye. I should never have
  come, Antonia Camilla. I might have known that you could never forgive."</p>

  <p>And he saw, as he glanced away from her intense and terrified face, the
  two assassins were approaching him, their hats pulled over their eyes and
  their arms raised and hidden by their cloaks.</p>

  <p>"Those two men are coming to murder me at your instigation," sighed
  Porphyrios quietly, "and I am sorry that we should have come to this,
  Camilla."</p>

  <p>The lady hesitated, but, seeing the two ruffians hastily approaching, she
  said:</p>

  <p>"You were a fool to suppose that I should forgive. You were a fool not to
  guess that there would be someone who could pay me even higher than
  you&mdash;that rely revenge would chime with my interest. My husband is a spy
  of France, and I serve him as well as I once served you. And now, good night
  to Your Highness, for these men are here to put you to death."</p>

  <p>But Porphyrios had already covered the two approaching murderers with his
  pistol, and they cowered back, surprised and confounded; for they could only
  attack the undefended and the unsuspecting&mdash;whenever they were faced,
  they fled, as they fled now squealing, scrambling and stumbling over the
  ruins and dropping out of their wallets the money that Herr Stoppelmann had
  paid them for the antiquities.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Porphyrios, "my only misfortune to-night is to be the
  misfortune of losing you." And he looked at her mournfully. Here in the
  monstrous ruins of the Coliseum, under the bright moon in the pale sky, they
  stared at each other most intently; and then she again essayed her fate, and
  struck him with a bodkin she had in her breast, so that the blood ran down
  his wrist from the slight wound she had made, and Porphyrios laughed
  unhappily.</p>

  <p>"Shall I escort you back to your lodging?" he asked mournfully.</p>

  <p>But the lady turned and left him, and walked alone through the blackness
  of the Imperial box; he was quite sure that she still loved him.</p>

  <p>Porphyrios sat down and mused bitterly. He did not notice that the blood
  was running from the scratch on the back of his wrist over the flowers that
  grew by his side; tall bell-like flowers rising elegantly from amid brambles.
  How clumsy he had been; why did he not follow Camilla; before morning she
  would betray him, of course: but it would be worth it, to a man of
  spirit.</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann had lost his way, and, as the Coliseum was the most
  conspicuous object in the city, he had made his way back there, intending, if
  need be, to pass the night under the arches, which despite his meeting with
  the assassins seemed to him to be safer than the narrow streets or the
  deserted temples full of sinister figures; seeing a tall purple flower
  growing in the moonlight he exclaimed foolishly: "Ah, sir, have you found the
  jacinth?"</p>

  <p>"It is a white flower stained with my blood," replied Porphyrios, looking
  down mournfully. "That is the only purple jacinth you will find in the
  Coliseum."</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann remembered the lady, the two assassins, and queried the
  rest. Porphyrios with a sigh bound up his wrist, said good night to Herr
  Stoppelmann, and went his way, which was not the way to the sweet shop.</p>

  <p>When the horticulturist came to write his diary of his journey abroad for
  the benefit of his Serene Electoral Highness, he put in this incident, told
  with many illustrations from classical authors. But he could not explain it;
  nor, he felt sure, could Porphyrios.</p>

  <p>"Who was Porphyrios?" asked His Serene Highness bored with the diary; and
  that Herr Stoppelmann could not tell either. But when he was sent, some years
  later, to the Court of Florence with a present of variegated tulips for the
  Grand Duke, he was astonished to see in this gentleman the stranger of that
  promenade in the Coliseum; or to believe that he saw this; discretion made
  him dubious of his own senses.</p>

  <p>The Grand Duke did not appear to recognize him, and Herr Stoppelmann did
  not venture to recall their mutual adventure to his mind. But later, Herr
  Stoppelmann strolled in the gardens with His Highness Karl Ferdinand Maria,
  Archduke of Austria and Grand Duke of Tuscany, who showed him his red Roman
  nectarines and other tempting fruit growing plentifully on the walls, and
  told him how he had hung there three bottles of mixture to keep away the
  wasps. Herr Stoppelmann interrupted to say how neats' feet kept off earwigs,
  "which are pernicious," he added. "Nor ought you to be less diligent to
  prevent the ants, which above all invade the orange flower. Cast scalding
  brine on their hills and other haunts. Look diligently under the leaves of
  mural trees for snails&mdash;they stick commonly somewhat above the fruit. Do
  not nip off the bitten leaves, for then they will certainly begin
  afresh."</p>

  <p>Here His Highness checked Herr Stoppelmann, who was again inclined to
  think he was in a chair at Leyden, and to talk a great deal too much, though
  no doubt to good purpose.</p>

  <p>"None of your glasses of beer to entice wasps and flies is of much use,"
  he smiled. "They will get the peach just the same, even if they perish
  afterwards. And, believe me, my dear Herr Stoppelmann, they will think it
  worth it. I was once in that situation. To avoid a trap baited with poisoned
  honey, I left my peach untasted, and, believe me, I have regretted it ever
  since."</p>

  <p>Herr Stoppelmann was left to his own reflections on this matter, and to
  decide whether or no it dealt with the promenade in the Coliseum&mdash;and if
  so, whether it indicated that His Highness regretted, not the folly which had
  led him into the trap, but the wisdom with which he had extricated
  himself...</p>

  <p>"I believe," thought Herr Stoppelmann, "that is probably what he means, he
  was so fond of that lady that he would rather have had another hour or two of
  life with her and been slain&mdash;than lost her and escaped. He is sorry,
  not that he discovered her perfidy, but that he let her know he had
  discovered it. He regrets, not that he escaped, but that he did not eat his
  peach before he fell into the jar of sweets. The prize would have been worth
  the penalty&mdash;the sweetness worth the suffocation. I wonder," he
  reflected to himself, rubbing his long chin.</p>

  <p>But His Highness, who seemed indifferent about most matters, proceeded in
  a leisurely manner to display the rest of his collection of peaches&mdash;the
  quince peach, the musk peach, the Grand Carnation, the Portugal peach, the
  Crown peach, the Savoy Malacotan "which," said His Highness, "has this
  advantage&mdash;that it lasts till Michaelmas, and few sweet delicious things
  have so long an enduring."</p>

  <p style="margin-left:45%">[ITALY. 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The hunted man paused at the corner of the street by the great fountain;
  from the wide lips of a marble river god, the purest of waters trickled into
  a huge white basin where the gossips met in the evening and the girls stayed
  to freshen beneath the crystal-clear drops the bouquets wilting from wearing
  over their warm bosoms.</p>

  <p>It was the high blaze of noon and the streets were empty; green lattices
  shrouded the high narrow windows in the white facades of the houses built
  between the gigantic acanthus-crowned pillars of an antique temple.</p>

  <p>The pursued man waited, listening to the distant footfalls of those upon
  his track.</p>

  <p>He had little breath to run further, but he began to hope he had
  outdistanced them and that they had lost their way in the great city so
  silent in the midday heat. As his strength returned he moved on cautiously;
  there was a bullet-hole in his purple cloak; he contemplated this with a sly
  smile.</p>

  <p>In the last fortnight his life had been attempted several times, but never
  so openly and audaciously as on this occasion.</p>

  <p>A yellow and scarlet parakeet shrieked, high on a shaded balcony, and the
  man knew the extent of his own fear by the great start he gave and the urging
  movement of his tired feet.</p>

  <p>He could surely hear them again, he could just see them rounding the angle
  of the white houses by the marble fountain...snatching at chance he turned
  into a black archway which led to a cellar of a small, unguarded fruit-store,
  half-beneath the pavement.</p>

  <p>From among piles of water melons, damp yellow and green figs, overripe
  bursting plums and the last grapes swarming with tiny flies, he peered up
  into the street and watched his would-be assassins go swiftly past.</p>

  <p>They had, then, missed him; the moment he was safe he became ashamed of
  his fear, but consoled himself for this shame by the reflection that in the
  first struggle he had been totally disarmed; the ruffians coming behind had
  cut his sword-strap and soon wrested from him the dagger he wore in his belt.
  It was a miracle (though he did not know what god he must thank for it) that
  he had escaped.</p>

  <p>He was exhausted from running and, frowning at his unworthy situation, he
  flung himself down on a pile of hempen sacks filled with onions and salad
  which had been brought up that morning from the country.</p>

  <p>The fugitive wiped the sweat from his throbbing forehead and endeavoured
  to set straight the habit which had been so rich and precise when he left his
  apartments an hour ago.</p>

  <p>A girl came from the shadows at the back of the store; from the inner room
  she had heard his movements and she expected a customer.</p>

  <p>She was amazed both at his splendour and his disorder and stood silent,
  contemplating him; the hunted man returned her scrutiny with equal interest
  for, although he had seen many such girls walking in the streets of Rome, the
  circumstances of their meeting gave a peculiar emphasis to the beauty of this
  peasant, and, to the man's heated imagination, she seemed almost like a saint
  or goddess whom he had evoked for his salvation.</p>

  <p>Her skirt was of faded blue-dyed linen, her bodice of white linen, and a
  faded kerchief of many colours was folded on her bosom; this barely concealed
  and did not disguise her shapeliness. Her arms and neck were bare and there
  was nothing on her glossy black hair but a classic fillet of thin silver
  which served to keep her heavy locks in place.</p>

  <p>The young man rose, uneasy at having been discovered in so undignified a
  position; his eyes had become used to the warm murk of the cellar shop, and
  he could now discern on all sides richness and colour piled high, the dark
  green mottled sides of gourds and pumpkins beside the vermilion skins of
  love-apples, the opulence of bruised peaches and crimson nectarines set on
  curly green leaves, wilting in the heat; pears hanging by azure strings from
  hooks in the walls, and red earthenware jars holding plumey clusters of sweet
  basil tied together by scarlet ribbons.</p>

  <p>The girl asked if he wished to make a purchase and he replied ruefully
  that he believed he had no money; but he pulled off a small gold ring which
  he had always disliked and offered it to the girl in exchange for a drink of
  water and five minutes in which to recover his composure. The price he
  offered for these small favours was high, but he intended the ring as an
  oblation to the goddess of good luck.</p>

  <p>The girl stared at the ring, turning it over in her brown palm. She told
  him (he did not know why) that her name was Marianna, then she stared at him
  again, at his purple cloak with the bullet-hole, his costly habit, laced and
  prinked with silver, his falling collar of heavy lace, his curls of a thick
  amber-brown, his smooth, warm-coloured, southern face, which was given an
  alert and eager expression by the slight upward turn of eyebrows and
  nostrils, and the odd, sly lift at the corners of the full lips.</p>

  <p>Without comment she brought him precisely what he had asked for&mdash;an
  earthenware jug full of the famous Roman water brought by the Claudian
  aqueduct from the Sabine hills. The red pottery was cool, damp and delicious
  to the touch; the young man drank eagerly from the jug. Marianna handed him
  figs, heavy with the hopes of Autumn, bruised with their own rich
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>"You have been in some danger?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ah, yes; there are certainly some rascals who desire my life, but I
  suppose that is not such an uncommon thing in Rome."</p>

  <p>"You should defend yourself."</p>

  <p>"I do what I can&mdash;I even wear under this habit a corselet of stout
  steel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean," replied the girl, "you should ask protection from His Holiness
  the Pope, or one of the great princes of the city."</p>

  <p>"There are many excellent reasons why I cannot do that. I am a foreigner
  here."</p>

  <p>"Yet you speak our language very well; of what nation are you? And what,
  if I may have the courage to ask as much, is your name?"</p>

  <p>The young cavalier had recovered his spirits and with his spirits a
  certain effrontery which, however, did not pass the limit of good
  breeding.</p>

  <p>"I come from Spain&mdash;Valentia, and my name is Eugenio; after all," he
  added, with a smile, "I daresay they were no more than common street thieves
  and rascals who attacked me."</p>

  <p>"But in broad day!" exclaimed she, amazed; "and could you not, sir, have
  shouted for help? Though everyone is now asleep in the heat of the midday,
  still there would have been soon someone to your rescue."</p>

  <p>"And I should have been despatched before they arrived," replied the young
  man. "No, sweet one, I know what I am about and, believe me, I have a
  powerful protector."</p>

  <p>"Then, signor, I implore you to invoke this protector, whether it be of
  heaven or earth."</p>

  <p>"My protector," smiled Eugenio, "is very much of earth."</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat, which he had removed when Marianna entered, for he
  was very exact in all the niceties of courtesy, brushed the dust off it and
  adjusted the long feather.</p>

  <p>Marianna turned the little gold ring, which was twisted in the form of two
  hearts, about on her palm, and appeared both amazed and bewildered. Eugenio,
  pausing in the doorway, suddenly knew that it was not the little gold ring
  that he disliked but the woman who had given it to him; he was as thankful to
  be rid of it as if it had been a thing of ill omen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, signor," exclaimed the girl fearfully, "you will set forth again so
  soon? Will you not hide here?"</p>

  <p>"Would you hide me?" he asked gaily.</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly, signor; and you know," she added, with an ardent passion
  of eagerness, "this is really a very convenient place, it is built upon an
  old temple. You go down many, many steps and there is the ancient building,
  and beyond it a passage which leads right under the walls and out into the
  Campagna&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And catacombs," added Eugenio, with something of a shudder. He disliked
  all that was dark and underground.</p>

  <p>"No one uses the passage now," urged Marianna. "Sometimes I and my brother
  for pure adventure go down there with candles, and we know our way very
  precisely now by means of a string, and, if it would be of any use to
  you?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Eugenio laughed, but not in derision, and thanked her tenderly for her
  kindness.</p>

  <p>"I am, however, sweet one, quite sure of my protector, to whom I must now
  immediately recommend myself."</p>

  <p>He left the dark, cool cellar shop with the girl standing there, and came
  out again into the street, smitten and dazzled by the excess of sunlight; he
  was then near his destination and feared no further attack; but he kept his
  slanting, dark eyes warily this way and that and his shrewd glance keenly in
  all doorways and passages. He left the streets and turned into a noble
  piazza, in the centre of which a basalt elephant bore a marble column on his
  back; in the shadow of the plinth of this monument a player of a hurdy-gurdy
  and a vendor of melons were asleep side by side&mdash;the instrument and the
  fruit were alike glossy and striped.</p>

  <p>Eugenio took his way across the flat Roman pavement. A sharp flight of
  steps receded from a triple porch of a haughty church, where the sun picked
  out from hollows and blots of purple shadow gigantic figures of saints and
  martyrs who, with fluttering stone robes and hair, appeared to resist an
  invisible wind.</p>

  <p>Eugenio, dainty and wary as a cat, sidled round the church; peering
  cautiously back he saw that the man with the hurdy-gurdy had come on his
  knees round the plinth of the elephant and castle, and had a carbine levelled
  at him.</p>

  <p>Throwing up his cloak Eugenio ran agile and fleet-footed he gained the
  high iron gates of the palace which was his destination; they stood ajar;
  Eugenio slipped in, closed them, and peered through the metal scrolls and
  roses. The hurdy-gurdy player had not followed him; at a more easy pace he
  proceeded through the garden.</p>

  <p>The drowsy peace of noon pervaded everything; there was a sense of
  eternity in this sleepy quiet; the dusty green of ilex trees hung over the
  whiteness of <i>termini</i>, the dry, curling leaves lay on the stone blocks
  of these guardians of the noon-like coronals.</p>

  <p>In the shimmer of the fierce light the facade of the palace, rosy-gold,
  appeared as unsubstantial as a sunset cloud. Fine palms, jade-green lemons
  among their smooth leaves and lilies flecked with red and purple grew in the
  stone pots upheld by bronze fauns along the sun-swept terrace.</p>

  <p>Eugenio was familiar here and he entered at once by the long window,
  grateful not only for this ultimate protection but for the relief from the
  glaring light.</p>

  <p>The apartment was curtained in pale green; the lattices, also of this
  colour, admitted only a translucent light. In the centre of the marble floor
  a sunk pool filled the air with coolness; through the clear water grew the
  sharp leaves and the purple blossom of iris, and below, between the stems,
  swam small carp, glittering with a metallic brilliancy. In the centre of the
  pool a fine fountain cast a cascade of drops high into the shadowed
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Beyond the fountain, in an alcove hung with straw-coloured silk, was a
  little group of people very well known to Eugenio, and occupied, as he so
  often found them occupied, in a philosophic discussion. The exiled Queen, who
  had resigned her throne out of caprice and extravagance, was the mistress and
  centre of this company, among whom Eugenio recognized the Cardinal Cipriano
  degli Angeli; Jean Bochart, the orientalist; Isaac Vossius, the professor of
  Greek; the Princess Palatine, who was shortly to become a Protestant Abbess;
  and Anna von Schurmann, the most learned blue-stocking from Utrecht; while,
  leaning over the back of the Queen's gilded chair, was the elegant French
  philosopher, Monsieur Des Cartes.</p>

  <p>Eugenio was welcomed gaily by all these people with whom indeed he was
  tolerably familiar. The young Spaniard, who had played many parts in his
  short life, was known to the fantastic court of this discrowned Queen as the
  Marquis della Ferranti, Master of Her Majesty's Horse.</p>

  <p>This titular office was a sinecure, but the young Marquis held another
  position not so easily explained, but infinitely powerful; he was the
  favourite of this Queen who had disdained marriage. She now beckoned him to
  her side and he took up a dutiful post at her footstool, grateful for the
  coolness of the room and the sense of safety that encompassed him. Here, at
  the very feet of his powerful protectress he need no longer fear the obscure
  designs of his enemies.</p>

  <p>"We are having a philosophic discussion," said the Queen, "in which you,
  Eugenio, must join. The subject is no less than this: Which is the more
  powerful passion&mdash;love or hate?" She glanced round her learned
  circle.</p>

  <p>And Eugenio glanced at her.</p>

  <p>Slight and aquiline with eyes too large, vivid and brilliant for her thin
  face, the Queen appeared devoured by some inner ardour; even this drowsy
  noonday occasion found her keen and animated. She was curiously dressed in a
  cavalier's habit of white satin, heavily embroidered with steel, and her hair
  hung like a man's on to her thin shoulders. She wore a sword, a great diamond
  on her breast, and on her knee were the plumed hat and embroidered gauntlets
  of a gentleman's attire. The other two women in the company suffered
  themselves without dispute to be eclipsed by Her Majesty.</p>

  <p>The Princess Palatine was exhausted by the misfortunes and passions of a
  life spent in exile and retreat. She already wore almost a religious garb.
  There was a fanatical belief in her dreamy eyes and what remained of her
  beauty, wasted in waiting, was no more than the perfume of her
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>The learned lady from Utrecht was attired stiffly in the Dutch style, and
  chose every possible opportunity to display her pedantry; when she was forced
  to be silent and listen to the others her nervous fingers cut out an endless
  procession of figures of birds, Chinamen, fishes, stars, and monsters in
  paper&mdash;these were scattered all over the floor near the edges of her
  stiff silk skirt.</p>

  <p>In secret amusement Eugenio listened to the discussion, inwardly he felt
  vastly superior to all the disputants; they seemed to him to have lost their
  wits in musty pedantry and to have no understanding of life as he, Eugenio
  Marquis della Ferranti, knew it. They spoke in soft, indifferent voices and
  their abstract arguments crossed and re-crossed each other in the lazy
  afternoon air as if they made a pattern of lace in the shadows.</p>

  <p>Isaac Vossius, the Dutch professor of Greek, was so wise that he was
  credulous of everything. It was said of him that he could believe in anything
  save the Bible; while the Cardinal was such a tolerant man that he disagreed
  with nobody save those whose opinions differed from his own.</p>

  <p>Both these men declared that the passion of Hate was far fiercer, more
  violent, and more powerful than the passion of Love.</p>

  <p>Eugenio laughed in his sleeve at them for a pair of dry old fools.</p>

  <p>The learned lady from Utrecht knew nothing of either love or hate, but
  kept up her part of the dispute by extracts from the classics, illustrated by
  modern verse and prose&mdash;Greek, Hebrew and Latin.</p>

  <p>The Queen slipped her fingers into Eugenio's curls and remarked that they
  were somewhat disordered; then, in a louder voice, demanded the French
  philosopher's opinion on the matter of the discussion.</p>

  <p>"Love or Hate&mdash;which is the stronger? You, who know the secrets of
  the human soul, must decide our difficulties."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman's bright eyes twinkled under the heavy fringe of his
  wig.</p>

  <p>"I have had," he said, "some visions in my time, but I do not know that
  any of them would throw light on this matter. I recall when I was in Germany,
  returned to the army after the Emperor's coronation, I was in winter
  quarters; I had no society whatever and no diversions of any kind. Luckily,
  neither had I any cares nor was I agitated by any passions, so that I
  remained shut up all day long&mdash;shut up with the stove and my own
  thoughts."</p>

  <p>"And what sprang from this dismal seclusion?" asked Her Majesty.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman glanced with irony at the Dutch man.</p>

  <p>"I do not know; I tried to get away from pedantry, from rust, from the
  foolishness of those who speak nothing but Latin as soon as they have pulled
  a doctor's cap over their ears. In brief, I endeavoured to be a philosopher
  though always remaining a pious churchman and to do everything in the manner
  of a gentleman."</p>

  <p>Eugenio smiled secretly and, putting up his fine hand, pressed the Queen's
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Bochart, the orientalist, now began to talk of the pendulum, and Saturn's
  rings, and the new discoveries in astronomy.</p>

  <p>The Queen bid him back to the point.</p>

  <p>"You will make me think," she said, "that you are no more than dried
  specimens, such as one keeps in a case or a box and brings out for inspection
  in a particular company. Have you then, no passions&mdash;any of you? Cannot
  'you tell me which is the more potent&mdash;Love or Hate?"</p>

  <p>At this Des Cartes declared roundly for Hate, and ran over all&mdash;war,
  crime and impiety&mdash;which had been produced from this terrible force.</p>

  <p>"And if," he added, "you ask me what Love has produced, I shall
  reply&mdash;very little, a stray good deed, an odd good work, here and
  there."</p>

  <p>The Cardinal interrupted, for he felt he had not had enough of the
  conversation, and he wished to stave off the noontide drowsiness, he feared
  also to disgrace himself by dropping asleep and snoring in his too easy
  chair. Therefore he began to argue with more vigour than conviction on the
  power of Love.</p>

  <p>"Love created God," he declared.</p>

  <p>To which Bochart, the orientalist, countered: "But Hate created the Devil,
  and we all know, without reflection, who is the more powerful of the
  two!"</p>

  <p>The Queen looked down at Eugenio.</p>

  <p>"You have nothing to say?" she smiled. "Will you not enter into this
  interchange of pleasantries and let us know what is your opinion on this
  grave and weighty matter?"</p>

  <p>Eugenio replied by glancing up with a confident smile. Well he knew the
  value of his shapely lips, his smooth features, his rich locks and brown
  complexion, his flattering tongue and his gay air; and well he knew her
  value&mdash;coy and fine, nobly born and by no means disposed to play the
  penitent in the desert.</p>

  <p>"One must speak by experience," he said, "and according to one's age. In
  five-and-twenty years one has not been through as much as in five-and-sixty.
  Though I have learned a great deal of love, I am yet unversed in the powers
  of hate."</p>

  <p>"Innocent and noble youth," murmured the Queen, "you are indeed well
  fitted to be the exponent of this mighty passion," and, with her hands on his
  shoulders, she half turned him about as if exhibiting him to the company.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the French philosopher, rather sadly (for in his younger
  days he had been gallant and now regretted his wrinkles and his wig), "that
  you, madam, consider this youth, with his beauty and his comely carriage, his
  grace and his ease, worth all of us philosophers with our quips and our
  arguments, our science and our learning?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly I do," admitted the Queen thoughtfully, and quoted the doctrine
  on which Malebranche built up his philosophy. "` So to judge all things
  according to its own inward life to the exclusion of all outward impressions
  produced by the mere senses and all the fantasies of the imagination; only
  that knowledge must be tried which teaches us what we are '."</p>

  <p>She looked steadily at Eugenio; he noted the wrinkles under her large
  melancholy eyes.</p>

  <p>He thought the moment appropriate to kiss her hand and murmur&mdash;"You
  have taught me to be what I am&mdash;your servant."</p>

  <p>Smiling at this touching language the Queen did not appear to be further
  interested in the argument.</p>

  <p>Seeing her thus, the Princess Palatine, who considered herself the Queen's
  dearest friend, clapped her hands and summoned an African page, who brought
  in drinks of sherbet and iced water in which floated slices of lemon.</p>

  <p>The Queen now roused herself (she, as all the company, seemed drowsy) and
  asked them how the argument had concluded.</p>

  <p>No one knew.</p>

  <p>It was decided to give Eugenio the casting-vote.</p>

  <p>"Why, Love is the stronger passion," declared he confidently and with a
  triumphant look at the Queen. "Love is like the sun and Hate is merely the
  black cloud that sometimes, but never entirely nor for long, obscures
  it."</p>

  <p>"Eugenio has decided," sighed the Queen, and rose.</p>

  <p>She walked towards the fountain and looked between the iris flags into the
  still water, broken only by the flash of the glittering fish. In her white
  satin, gold-tagged cavalier's dress she appeared a haggard youth, and her one
  beauty was the quantity of her fine curls which fell to her waist.</p>

  <p>They left her with her favourite: the learned lady, the disappointed
  princess, the orientalist, the philosophers and the Cardinal&mdash;all took
  their leave of the discrowned Queen and entered coaches and chairs; with
  languid movements they yawned.</p>

  <p>"How thankful I am that they have gone at last!" said Eugenio, approaching
  his mistress by the iris flowers; "I thought they would never leave, with
  their tedious arguments and fruitless discussion. Why, madam, do you
  encourage these tiresome and rusty pedants&mdash;these women who have
  forgotten their duties and never known love?"</p>

  <p>The Queen put the toe of her soft boot on one of the paper figures that
  Anna von Schurmann had cut out and, fixing her large melancholy eyes on
  Eugenio, asked him why his dress was so disordered.</p>

  <p>"I perceive," she added, "that there is a hole in your cloak, which
  appears also scorched."</p>

  <p>"You bring me," said Eugenio, "exactly where I would be. You will remember
  that I was attacked in the streets of Rome, a few days ago?"</p>

  <p>"I made nothing of it," smiled the Queen, "Rome is not a safe city for a
  well-dressed foreigner."</p>

  <p>"But now you must make something of it," said Eugenio, "for again I have
  been waylaid and only with the greatest difficulty escaped with my life."</p>

  <p>"How was it that you did escape?" she asked in low voice. And he triumphed
  to see the emotion which paled her thin cheeks. Those dusty idiots might well
  discuss which was the stronger&mdash;love or hate; he had no need to argue on
  the matter; the infatuation for this woman for him held not only safety but
  all high fortune. "Attacked?" she murmured, "someone tried to assassinate
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Truly," said Eugenio; and he related to her the story of the attempt made
  upon him in the deserted noontide streets&mdash;how he had leapt into the
  salad-monger's cellar shop (he did not mention the girl), how he had been
  pursued by the assassins who had passed the door, and afterwards how the
  hurdy-gurdy man, who had seemed nothing but a beggar, had endeavoured to get
  him with a carbine, even at the gate of Her Majesty's palace.</p>

  <p>"Who are your enemies?" murmured the Queen.</p>

  <p>Eugenio protested that he had not the least notion.</p>

  <p>"There are a complication of intrigues in Rome and somehow I have offended
  someone. There are those jealous of my favours with Your Majesty; perhaps I
  have incurred the enmity of someone who is altogether strange to me&mdash;how
  can I tell? This, at least, I know I am not safe in Rome."</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?" asked the Queen.</p>

  <p>"Leave Rome," he suggested, pressing her hand with the seriousness of a
  favoured lover.</p>

  <p>"You rely on me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"And the power of love," smiled Eugenio charmingly.</p>

  <p>She regarded him thoughtfully; never before to him had her eyes appeared
  so large, dark and mournful.</p>

  <p>"You wish me to leave my beautiful villa, my elegant company of friends, a
  climate that suits me, and all the amenities of Rome, because you are in
  danger here?"</p>

  <p>"My love," declared he on a superb note of passion, "will compensate you
  for all that you lose."</p>

  <p>Christina pulled at the tips of the iris flags and watched the reflection
  of her own face in the dark waters below.</p>

  <p>"Truly," she mused, in a low voice, "you have almost persuaded me that you
  love me, and as we have just decided in our argument that love is the most
  powerful of all passions it is therefore only just and fitting that for you I
  should abandon everything."</p>

  <p>Smiling with triumph he pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"In Spain I should be safe."</p>

  <p>"Would you&mdash;would not your enemies follow you?"</p>

  <p>"How would that be possible when I am under your protection? I rely on
  your protection&mdash;the protection of love."</p>

  <p>"I am tired of these terms of speech," said the Queen, in a low, moody
  voice. "I hear too many empty arguments. What did I not say just now? The
  only doctrine I can hold by...What is that&mdash;what is the truth of our own
  wretched little souls? Are we capable," she added rapidly, "of any pure and
  disinterested feeling&mdash;are we not merely full of arrogance, ambition and
  lust? Are not many of us utterly bewildered and incapable of distinguishing
  right from wrong? What is all this tremendous flow of words that surrounds us
  but the shameless invention of wicked men to torment us?"</p>

  <p>Eugenio cared little for this speech.</p>

  <p>"Madam, it is quite sufficient that we love each other," he pleaded, with
  all the ardour he could throw into his seductive voice and graceful
  person.</p>

  <p>"It should be sufficient," agreed the Queen, sombrely.</p>

  <p>"And I am in danger," he urged, "I scarcely dare leave your palace."</p>

  <p>"And here you think you are safe?"</p>

  <p>Eugenio observed that bars of sunshine falling through the lattice of the
  tall windows had become less on the marble floor and the air was of an
  oppressive and sultry heat.</p>

  <p>"Madam, there is a storm coming up," he remarked; the Queen, in a low
  tone, bade him open the windows.</p>

  <p>Eugenio did so and saw that the sky was covered with dark yellow clouds,
  that the leaves of the ilex trees were turned backwards by a low menacing
  breeze, that the flowers growing in the vases on the terrace appeared wilted,
  as if there were an acid in the air.</p>

  <p>"A storm," breathed Eugenio, "how still everything is! Where is our late
  learned company?"</p>

  <p>"They have all returned to the city," replied the Queen.</p>

  <p>"But your household, your servants&mdash;they also seem abroad. Never have
  I noticed the palace so quiet."</p>

  <p>"You and I are here, Eugenio, and that is sufficient," said Christina.
  "Presently, I do not think there will lack some few others to complete our
  joy."</p>

  <p>He did not understand the meaning of this nor greatly trouble himself
  about it, for that she was often obscure in her speech and eccentric in her
  manner. Eugenio did not, indeed, greatly trouble himself about the Queen in
  any particular, he was so sure of her; rather than lose him she would leave
  Rome and journey with him anywhere, so that he was safe from his mysterious
  enemies. So, despite the gloom of the nearing storm, his spirits were light
  and easy, and he knew that the Queen was watching his beauty and elegance as
  in his rich and tasteful habit he leant at the open window.</p>

  <p>The first flash of lightning darted behind the avenue of ilex trees and
  showed the looming whiteness of the gigantic termini, showed something else
  to the sharp eyes of Eugenio, which had become during the last few days so
  alert; this was the creeping figure of the man with the hurdy-gurdy who had
  levelled the carbine at him from behind the statue of the elephant and
  castle.</p>

  <p>Starting back from the window Eugenio exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Madam, there is one of my would-be assassins actually within your garden
  I Pray call someone and have him arrested!"</p>

  <p>The Queen came to the window and looked out for herself, though Eugenio
  cried out that she possibly put herself in some peril.</p>

  <p>But Christina gazed steadily down the ilex avenue and into the tawny light
  of the gathering storm.</p>

  <p>The man with the hurdy-gurdy leaned against one of the smooth grey stems
  of the dark trees and was now turning the handle of his little instrument,
  which emitted a brisk yet squeaky melody.</p>

  <p>"It is only a poor beggar," she said indifferently, "why should you
  disturb yourself for nothing? If this is the worst you have seen, I believe
  you are the victim of a fantastical imagination, Eugenio."</p>

  <p>Still turning the handle of his instrument the hurdy-gurdy man came up the
  empty avenue of ilex trees.</p>

  <p>Eugenio clapped his hand to his side to realize that he had not replaced
  his sword of which he had been despoiled in the street.</p>

  <p>Alarmed by the still attitude of the Queen, whom he believed paralysed
  with fright, he began to call for assistance, shouting up one by one the
  members of the household, but there was no reply from the marble arches of
  the palace then filled with dun shadows. Infuriated by this silence Eugenio
  ran to the doorway, which was usually shrouded by a thick silk curtain, but
  now when he raised this he found the bronze portals in place and locked; he
  hurled himself on the other entrance, through which had come the learned
  company of the philosophic discussion; here, a grille had been fastened in
  place.</p>

  <p>Eugenio was a prisoner in the marble room with the iris pool&mdash;a
  prisoner, unarmed. There was but one way of escape and that through the
  window and down the ilex avenue, up which had come the man with the
  hurdy-gurdy.</p>

  <p>"There has been some treachery here, as I take it!" he cried fiercely,
  turning on his mistress.</p>

  <p>"There seems to have been treachery enough," whispered the Queen, without
  looking at him.</p>

  <p>"Madam, how is it possible&mdash;the palace empty&mdash;no one answered to
  my shouts&mdash;both the doors fastened upon us&mdash;who is this assassin
  creeping up the avenue?"</p>

  <p>"A musician," replied the Queen, "he plays an elegy for a fool."</p>

  <p>"Madam! Christina!" exclaimed the young man, drawing back from the
  window-place, "I am unarmed; I lost my sword in the streets. I came straight
  to you and did not think of taking other weapons&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said an elegy for a fool," repeated the Queen, and turned round on him,
  her hands on her hips, with such an expression of pain and contempt on her
  face as caused him to utter a cry of alarm.</p>

  <p>"You came to me, you were safe with me, because I was a queen, and you
  were my lover? Love is the stronger passion, eh? You have had no experience
  of hate? I will enlarge your knowledge of women and the world."</p>

  <p>The trapped man began to perceive that she was his enemy.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?" he shuddered.</p>

  <p>She pulled out a package of letters from the pocket of her masculine
  coat.</p>

  <p>"You have a mistress in Valentia, younger than I, more beautiful, more
  charming&mdash;a woman whom you really love, a woman to whom you write
  lightly of me. For a month I have been intercepting your letters. You would
  be safe in Spain&mdash;and near her, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Madam, I never wrote them&mdash;they are forgeries," he lied
  desperately.</p>

  <p>"I know your hand, my Eugenio, and more, I know your heart and your
  mind...These are your words' She is not young, you have no cause to be
  jealous; she never has been fair, you have no reason to be peevish, for I do
  very well by her favour. I shall grow great by her infatuation. She is
  surrounded by fools who know not how to take advantage of her. You must not
  be angry with me if I have persuaded her I love her, for our fortune hangs
  upon my success.' Was it not foolish, my Eugenio, to write these things and
  trust them to the post?"</p>

  <p>"There has been treachery!" he cried, "I swear there has been
  treachery!"</p>

  <p>"Enough to shame Judas, but swear no more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The hurdy-gurdy man had approached nearer and then, still turning the
  handle of his instrument, he mounted the terrace. The thunder began to roll
  in the clouds and the lightning to flash the quicker over the empty ilex
  avenue.</p>

  <p>The young man fell back before the Queen's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You, was it you?" he stammered. "You cannot mean assassination?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I not? You see, after all, you understand very little,
  Eugenio. The wise men were right when they argued that the power of hate was
  stronger. You shall see how powerful it is."</p>

  <p>Even then he could scarcely credit his atrocious destiny.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you set those assassins on me, that you have trapped me
  here with these closed doors, knowing me unarmed and trusting you?"</p>

  <p>"I trusted you," said Christina.</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;I never thought of murder."</p>

  <p>"I would as soon be slain as mocked at," said the Queen, and, leaning from
  the window, she beckoned to the hurdy-gurdy man, who placed his instrument by
  the pot of wilting agaves and crept across the terrace where, on the hot
  stone, the round drops of rain were falling.</p>

  <p>Eugenio's throat was dry and his shapely limbs shuddering. It was as
  intolerable as incredible. He had walked smiling, claiming protection, into
  this hideous trap. Hatred for the woman shook him. How it had always sickened
  him to have to pretend to love her&mdash;she, with her eccentricities, her
  cruelties, her treacheries!</p>

  <p>"It is true that I have been a fool," he stammered, "but you&mdash;what
  are you?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you may now judge," she said, turning on him. "Did I not say
  that was all I held by&mdash;the truth? This is my truth, for what you have
  done to me I will see you destroyed." She lifted her lips at him like a cat
  he had once seen ready to fly at its fellow.</p>

  <p>The hurdy-gurdy man, a tall, sinewy ruffian with a beastly countenance,
  blocked up the window beside her.</p>

  <p>Eugenio snatched off his cloak and cast it over the head of this ugly
  fellow and, in this second's respite, fled down the ilex avenue. They would
  be guarding the gates, but he knew another way out of the villa garden. He
  ran, ran, ran, thankful for the rain splashing on to the hot marble flags and
  the dust beneath the ilex trees, rattling on the dry leaves and staining the
  dry whiteness of the watching termini.</p>

  <p>By the wide secret pool where the nymphs of Diana were still supposed to
  bathe on moonlit nights of June, past the water organ where Tritons formed of
  shells grinned at him, through a grove of olives, where grey-pink doves
  sheltered from the storm in a temple dedicated to Venus, Eugenio fled.</p>

  <p>A leap over a parapet, a drop from a wall, helped by the hanging branches
  of flowers which tore his hands, and Eugenio was again in the streets of
  Rome, now emptied by the storm as they had, a few hours before, been emptied
  by the noontide sun.</p>

  <p>She would have set spies for him everywhere; he paused, panting, and
  considered what he should do&mdash;friendless, penniless, a stranger, and
  pursued&mdash;so, in a few moments had his fortunes fallen!</p>

  <p>In his angry distress he recalled the girl in the fruit store and her talk
  of a way of escape through the catacombs and subterranean passages, ancient
  temples and forgotten grave vaults. The lightning flashed behind the florid
  cornice of the ruined temple of Mars the Avenger. The white goats browsing on
  the scant weeds among the columns once dedicated to Jove the Thunderer ran
  bleating for shelter into an archway where Latin letters, a foot long,
  recorded the glories of a forgotten hero.</p>

  <p>Eugenio ran, doubled, turned and came to the vegetable shop half-sunk
  beneath the cracked marble pavement.</p>

  <p>Marianna was there, silent among her wares, still turning over on her
  brown palm the ring he had given her and which the Queen had given him.</p>

  <p>"Child, you see, I have come back," he gasped, "I want you to help
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God be praised!" she said simply. "They are after you even now?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know&mdash;I hope they have not seen where I went, but it is not
  safe for me in the streets of Rome."</p>

  <p>"And the protection you spoke of?"</p>

  <p>"That failed me entirely. I have no hope but in you, Marianna."</p>

  <p>Again the girl said joyously:</p>

  <p>"God be praised!"</p>

  <p>She beckoned to him to follow her without more ado, and led him through a
  room at the back, then down a wooden ladder, she holding a burning lanthorn;
  so they came out of the storm-darkened streets into the quiet sombreness of
  the underground cellars, where amphori of Roman wine were piled round an
  alabaster altar. Following the girl with the light, Eugenio traversed passage
  after passage until they reached a round and lofty chamber. Here she lit two
  candles and, swiftly as she had escorted him from the shop, he now perceived
  that she had brought with her all his necessities&mdash;a knife, bread,
  cheese, wine, fruit&mdash;all which she took adroitly from her apron and laid
  on the mosaic floor of the underground chamber.</p>

  <p>"From here you can very easily get out into the Campagna," she said, "you
  will want nothing but a little money."</p>

  <p>Eugenio replied:</p>

  <p>"I have two diamond studs which, perhaps, if you are clever you can sell
  for me."</p>

  <p>He was not thinking of what he said, but of the beauty of the
  girl&mdash;her dewy eyes, her blooming cheeks, the lines, the light and
  lustre of her rich youth.</p>

  <p>Earnestly she assured him of his safety, no one would think of looking
  here&mdash;"And you may escape, signor, when you will."</p>

  <p>"But to-night I shall stay here," he replied, pressing her hand.</p>

  <p>"I must go now," she said, "but I will return and bring you a pillow."</p>

  <p>He allowed her to go; in the confidence of delight he awaited her
  return.</p>

  <p>Eugenio was at ease and peaceful in the underground mosaic chamber; while
  he waited for Marianna he stretched himself at ease; ate some fruit, smoothed
  his hair. How delicious to escape from the hate of a Queen and, deep in the
  earth, to embrace one who was more than a queen&mdash;a goddess, young,
  lovely, fresh.</p>

  <p>Then, recalling her stupid discussion, Eugenio laughed aloud; he had been
  right, after all. Love was the stronger passion.</p>

  <p>The candles glittered on the gilt mosaic; he heard her light tread and saw
  her small lamp...</p>

     id="ch-05-4"></a>A VISIT TO VERONA TO SEE<br>
     THE RUINS OF THE AMPHITHEATRE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>"When the sun grows troublesome it was the custom to
  draw a covering or veil quite over the Amphitheatre. This veil they
  oftentimes made of silk, dy'd with scarlet, purple or some such rich colour.
  The effect the colour of this veil had upon the audience that sat under it is
  finely described by Lucretius." ("Remarks on several Parts of Europe," by J.
  Breval, Esquire, 1726.)</i> [ITALY, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>At precisely the same moment as the Conde Florio de Moncada's travelling
  equipage swung into the courtyard of "The Lily Pot" a lady was alighting from
  a white jennet at the door of that hostelry.</p>

  <p>She was attended only by a small Indian groom and seemed too elegant to be
  travelling thus unescorted.</p>

  <p>As the coach, the sun glittering on the pale green varnish and the coat
  with twenty quarterings on the panels, drew up by the wide entrance of "The
  Lily Pot" the Conde Flaminio de Moncada glanced from the window and whispered
  excitedly:</p>

  <p>"There she is Florio, come you must admit that it is becoming very
  interesting."</p>

  <p>The elder gentleman smiled indulgently at his brother:</p>

  <p>"We will remain in the coach till she has gone into the inn."</p>

  <p>Flaminio smiled also; for a week the lady on the white jennet had
  travelled the same road, stayed at the same inns and taken no notice of their
  existence; her behaviour had been as decorous as her mode of journeying was
  strange; both had obliged the brothers to notice her very particularly; a
  beautiful creature without a doubt, and well-bred.</p>

  <p>The lady slipped modestly into the inn, which was soon in a hubbub over
  the arrival of my lords of Moncada; two Spanish noblemen travelling for
  health and pleasure...eh, but a grand <i>entourage</i>...the post chaises
  followed; my lords brought their own valets, grooms, cooks, barbers...twenty
  liveried attendants...a severe hooded dame, who was nurse to the younger
  gentleman, a woman to wait on her...eh, "The Lily Pot" was used to splendour,
  but padrone, lackeys, ostlers, chambermaids were eagerly impressed by this
  display...a courier had bespoken rooms days before...the whole of the piano
  mobile for the two foreign Excellencies...one was ill, be it understood, eh,
  but a pity! Verona had been ransacked for luxuries&mdash;early peaches,
  apricots, pineapples, for the invalid; the courier had brought feather-beds
  and silk hangings with him; the padrone bowed these great ones into the fine
  apartments overlooking the gardens, nervously wished these better, timidly
  hoped these were not too mean...for their Excellencies?</p>

  <p>And behind his humble protestations of duty was a sharp flicker of
  curiosity; the courier, a cunning Levantine, very able at his work, had
  whispered something of the history of his two masters.</p>

  <p>"The affection between them&mdash;it was prodigious! their wealth,
  extraordinary!&mdash;but, what would you? Some bitter drop in the cup we must
  all have, and the Conde Flaminio was ill, dying, perhaps! A wound received in
  a duel had caused a malady in the chest, and consider this, the lady who was
  the cause of the duel had forsaken him for his rival, and ever since his
  brother has been carrying him from place to place, from doctor to doctor, in
  the endeavour to please and distract him, and the oddest thing is that they
  contrive to be perfectly happy."</p>

  <p>The Conde Florio courteously thanked the landlord for his attention and
  ordered a light collation...the chambers were very good; the walls painted
  with sea-nymphs who offered branches of coral to plumed heroes on silver
  ships; the wide windows stood open on a garden full of palms, lilies,
  carnations and pepper trees like green foam; the sharp brightness of noon
  filled the Verona sky.</p>

  <p>Leonilda the nurse with the long puckered yellow face, tenderly arranged
  the Conde Flaminio on a couch by the window and gave him one of her own
  brewed cordials; the sick man turned his graceful head on the violet pillows
  and looked across the garden; the lady of the white jennet, forgotten by all,
  was seated in the shade of the yellow marble wall; she had a musing air and
  did not look up at the windows.</p>

  <p>"Florio, she is really very charming and she reminds me of Isabella."</p>

  <p>The elder brother glanced sharply out of the window; this was the first
  time he had heard that name since Isabella had married Flaminio's rival; yes,
  the girl appeared gentle, sad and pleasing in the blue shadow; some azure
  rosy doves were about her feet, she seemed their sister.</p>

  <p>"Flaminio, she must be no better than a vagabond&mdash;to travel
  alone."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," the other sighed and smiled. "But is it not peculiar that
  she is on the same road with us&mdash;at the same inn continuously?"</p>

  <p>"No doubt, but if it amuses you at all, my dear brother, I am very
  glad."</p>

  <p>Their own lackeys, in liveries of black and green, served iced sherbet,
  hollowed oranges filled with jellies, candied melons and marchpane; a
  delicate shadow obscured the cool chamber. Florio anxiously studied his
  brother to see if he had suffered from the fatigue of travel; the wasted
  face, still so noble and handsome, was very like his own, the thin haughty
  countenance of an Andalusian cavalier, the nose a fine aquiline, the arched
  upper lip darkened, the outline clear, the complexion sallow but pure, the
  eyes of a dramatic darkness, the eyebrows sweeping, and the rippling hair so
  black that all the anxious barber's pomade could scarcely darken the thick
  ringlets...all through Italy the severe faces, the costly heavy clothes,
  brocades, velvets, embroideries of the Spanish grandees had been stared at
  for their quality of exotic <i>bravura</i>.</p>

  <p>The beauty of the younger brother had not been eclipsed by his malady; his
  complexion was like amber-tinted alabaster and a faint shade of violet
  increased the melancholy shadow of his eyes; but the elder brother was
  flushed richly with warm blood and his glance was lively with a thousand
  pleasures, enjoyed and anticipated.</p>

  <p>"Already I love Verona, we shall stay here a long while, shall we not,
  Florio?&mdash;" He interrupted himself: "Look who has come into the
  garden!"</p>

  <p>Florio glanced over his brother's couch, a company of four dingy men were
  pacing in front of where the lady sat musing amid the doves; they were too
  nondescript to be respectable; all heavy, sombre, shabby, they had rather the
  air of hired bravos; Florio had noticed them at the last stopping-place,
  well, he had considerable treasure and Italy was infested with thieves...</p>

  <p>Two by two they paced up and down, talking together; the lady was munching
  biscuits which she took neatly from a silver paper; when she threw the paper
  away one of the loiterers picked it up and put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"It is very disagreeable for a gentlewoman to travel alone," murmured
  Flaminio gazing from his cushion at this scene. "Should we not offer her some
  protection?"</p>

  <p>"She needs none," replied Florio. "They are not speaking to her, and it is
  not so disagreeable to a gentlewoman to travel alone that none of them do
  it." To distract his brother he brought out his most recent purchase;
  everywhere they travelled he bought rare, costly and foolish objects to amuse
  Flaminio; this last toy was a suite of gold medals that had cost a great sum
  and had been snatched from the agent of a princely collector; there was a
  <i>Victoria Othonis</i>, accounted unique, two brass <i>Latins</i> (the Greek
  being common enough) of the same Emperor, a <i>Pax</i> and a
  <i>Securitas</i>, besides the greatest curiosities of all, a collection of
  those medals called <i>Spintriae</i>, which Tiberius struck in his delicious
  retreat at Capreae to commemorate his darling pleasures.</p>

  <p>Flaminio discovered but a languid enthusiasm for these treasures; Florio
  called in the violins and when the music had discoursed for an hour the sick
  man was asleep.</p>

  <p>The lady was alone again in the garden; when the Conde de Moncada went
  downstairs he discovered the four ill-looking fellows in the common parlour;
  too quiet, too withdrawn, one in a book, one in the <i>Gazette</i>, two in
  dice-throwing.</p>

  <p>De Moncada beckoned up the padrone hovering anxiously at his service:</p>

  <p>"Who were the four ruffians? He had seen them before&mdash;though he was
  well escorted, an attempted robbery would be disagreeable."</p>

  <p>The padrone was overwhelmed; the strangers had seemed what they
  pretended&mdash;harmless, petty merchants, but he would make enquiries...De
  Moncada cut short nervous protestations...it was no matter, he regretted
  having spoken, it was, after all, rather beneath a Moncada to express
  suspicion or anxiety.</p>

  <p>He went alone into the streets of Verona, where the rosy red and tawny
  yellow palaces threw violet shadows across the splendour of the afternoon; he
  observed, with a distant curiosity, the life he saw about him, of market,
  shop, church and street; he was so used to his own magnificent existence and
  fitted into it so perfectly that the existence of anyone placed in other
  conditions seemed to him not only gross and ridiculous, but false.</p>

  <p>De Moncada intended to carry his brother to visit the several curiosities
  of this city older than Rome; the cabinet of rarities belonging to Prince
  Moscardo, the gardens of the Marchese Giusti and the tomb of Pope Lucius, but
  now was at a stand for occupation, and out of pure idleness, crossed the
  Adige and walked about the marble amphitheatre; this Roman ruin, so vast and
  melancholy, was overgrown with wild flowers, vines and grasses; the lower
  stories were converted into warehouses, stables and haylofts; in the arena
  the tumblers in scarlet trousers performed their contortions before a ring of
  children and idlers; in the huge bare area this group appeared as small and
  as bright as insects.</p>

  <p>De Moncada walked on the broken masonry above the seats where the nobles
  of old Rome had once watched the chariot-races; it was scarcely with surprise
  that he came upon the lady of the white jennet; she was seated on the
  overturned capital of a fluted column and had plucked a bouquet of wild aster
  from the ruins; this, De Moncada knew, was a pagan flower dedicated to the
  spirits of evil.</p>

  <p>It seemed imperative that they should speak, if only because she so
  deliberately looked away from him and because the place was strange, lonely,
  delightful.</p>

  <p>De Moncada uncovered, paused, bowed.</p>

  <p>"Do you not, signora, find these solitary walks, this unprotected
  travelling, perilous?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him and blushed slowly; she had that quiet beauty which is
  pathetic in its air of resignation to the heritage of loneliness; an Italian,
  surely one of the honey-fair women of Siena with smooth, heavy hair and dusky
  gold eyes; she pleased his fastidious, alert taste.</p>

  <p>"You, signor," she answered softly, "are the first who has spoken to me in
  ten days' travel."</p>

  <p>He did not know if this was wit or innocency and asked her, smiling, if
  she intended a rebuke?</p>

  <p>"A rebuke? I am so grateful for any company." Her expression was of a
  childlike candour which caused him to mistrust her profoundly, and to linger
  in her society.</p>

  <p>"I was watching the tumblers&mdash;how far away they seem," she added.
  "How vast the arena is! How melancholy!"</p>

  <p>De Moncada told her that during the heat of summer festivals the whole of
  that mighty area used to be covered with a veil made of silk, dyed with
  purple and scarlet and spangled with stars...</p>

  <p>"Lucretius wrote a poem on the effect of this starry canopy on the people
  who sat beneath&mdash;the glare of common day being excluded, they came to
  believe themselves, beneath the rich Campanian luxury, transported into
  Heaven, and in that rosy light, felt neither the defects of others nor their
  own disgraces."</p>

  <p>The lady answered this formal speech with enthusiastic candour.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that such a starry canopy might fall over one's own life and
  actions!"</p>

  <p>"Are you, then, unhappy or distracted?"</p>

  <p>She rose; he admired her gown of striped saffron taffeta, her hat of
  Livorno straw, her comely shape and her modest <i>allure</i>, he was quite
  unprepared for her next words.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how can you, sunk in sloth and extravagance, understand such as
  I?"</p>

  <p>At this hint that he was despised the grandee frowned, and became even
  more impassive than was his wont.</p>

  <p>"If you would care to confide in me, signora, you would discover that I do
  not lack width of sympathy."</p>

  <p>But the lady turned away hurriedly, protesting that her story was too
  commonplace to endure his august scrutiny...all she would say was that her
  name was Faustina, that she travelled on urgent business of her own and that
  she begged him to put one so unworthy out of his mind...</p>

  <p>"An accomplished hypocrite," thought De Moncada, and paid her far more
  attention than he would have paid to a simpleton; "one is not a hypocrite for
  nothing, and when one is lovely, it is worth while to discover what is
  beneath the deception."</p>

  <p>But Faustina's last remark, made as she turned away, had no savour of
  hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>"You, signor, have contrived to draw the starry veil, the rosy canopy, so
  completely over your own existence that your life is entirely artificial,
  would you not sometimes care to see things in the common light of truth?"</p>

  <p>She seemed too mournful and disappointed to wait for an answer, nor had De
  Moncada any to offer to such an obvious absurdity; because he was wealthy,
  idle, elegant, extravagant, was he less a human being than the beggar nursing
  his sores and dining off black bread and onions?</p>

  <p>He watched her walking with a mournful air, along the marble ruins, the
  asters, the colour of a winter sky, in her hands, and the hem of her dress
  disturbing the fine ferns that grew round the acanthus leaves of fallen
  pillars.</p>

  <p>"She will contrive another meeting very soon," he thought.</p>

  <p>Even sooner than he had believed, and in a manner in which he had not
  considered possible; he was playing chess that evening with his brother in
  the piano nobile of "The Lily Pot" when the painted door flew open and she
  broke in upon them; her tumult of distress was as startling as her entry; it
  appeared as if she was pursued; De Moncada sprang up and Flaminio raised
  himself on his couch, scattering the glittering chess-pieces on the shining
  floor.</p>

  <p>"As you are Christian gentlemen, I entreat you to save me," stammered the
  lady with a swooning movement forward; De Moncada caught her to prevent her
  falling at his feet; he looked not at her but at his brother.</p>

  <p>Flaminio, who had been very languid all day, was now full of animation;
  his comely face was flushed to a semblance of health, his eyes sparkled with
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Did I not say," he cried, "that she was in need of our protection?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, noble cavalier," answered Faustina, "I am." She gently withdrew
  from De Moncada's support, at the same time giving him a reproachful glance.
  "I meant to tell you this afternoon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have been meeting my brother?" exclaimed Flaminio jealously.</p>

  <p>"...By chance&mdash;in the amphitheatre, he was not encouraging, but you
  signor, perhaps have a tender heart?"</p>

  <p>"I have also a useless arm," sighed Flaminio, "but I am sure that my
  brother's sword is at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"For what cause?" asked De Moncada drily.</p>

  <p>The lady had now seated herself, with a baffling mingling of simplicity
  and assurance in her air; De Moncada was alarmed by the intensity of
  admiration with which his brother regarded her; how skilfully he had
  concealed his interest in the fair, mysterious stranger, until it has been
  thus startled from him...she told her tale demurely; the daughter of a noble
  house, she had been offered a brutal choice between an old, ugly husband and
  a convent, and had contrived to flee the dilemma with one faithful Indian
  groom and jewels she sold one by one...she did not deny that she had
  deliberately taken the same route as the brothers, their splendid equipage
  had given her confidence.</p>

  <p>"That your tale has been the theme of a thousand romances does not render
  it impossible," remarked De Moncada. "But one character is missing&mdash;it
  is usual in these circumstances for the lady to elope with a lover."</p>

  <p>"I had none."</p>

  <p>"That is hard to believe."</p>

  <p>"She means," put in Flaminio eagerly, "none whom she favoured. But what,
  signora, is your destination?"</p>

  <p>"Rome. I have a widowed aunt there, the Princess Dolabella, who will, I am
  sure, afford me every protection."</p>

  <p>"We also travel to Rome," cried the younger brother with impulsive
  delight. "If we can assist you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Faustina drew her chair slightly nearer the couch.</p>

  <p>"That is what I came to entreat. I have just discovered that I am
  followed&mdash;oh, the horror of it!" She seemed too overcome to continue and
  Flaminio caught at her delicate hand in deep compassion at her distress; De
  Moncada surveyed both critically; they appeared like lovers, in youth, beauty
  and mutual tenderness.</p>

  <p>"How, signora," he asked, "can we preserve you from your pursuers?"</p>

  <p>She had her scheme ready; she had seen women in their retinue&mdash;the
  nurse, the serving girl...Might not she, poor, humble, hunted creature, be
  absorbed into their splendour? No one would look for her among the servants
  of the Spanish grandees, she could disguise herself, she would be no trouble,
  nay, she was skilful with her hands in cooking, needlework, nursing...the
  little groom, too, was a useful creature..."And you, noble cavaliers, will be
  doing a good deed that will certainly be rewarded in Heaven."</p>

  <p>Flaminio could scarcely allow her to finish her pretty speech before he
  had passionately agreed to her request...they both looked at De Moncada like
  children coaxing for an impossible favour, which, however, they are sure of
  obtaining...the elegant young man on the couch, brilliant-eyed, flushed with
  pleasure, the girl whose hand he was clasping and whose glance held an eager
  appeal...remembering her remarks made at the ruins, De Moncada smiled; before
  that smile she had the grace, or the innocency, to blush.</p>

  <p>"If this does not appear an incredible adventure to you, signora," he
  remarked, "there is no need for it to appear so to me. You will be safe from
  your pursuers in our apartments, and Leonilda, the <i>duenna</i>, will see to
  your accommodation."</p>

  <p>Flaminio added nothing to this; he kissed her hands, and joy suddenly
  filled the eye of the elder brother; the two of them had contrived, as the
  courier had observed, to be very happy together on their travels; they had
  enjoyed everything; even Flaminio's illness had not been able to overshadow
  their joy in each other and in the pursuit of life and beauty; they were
  philosophers; "If Death travels with us we will show him we are good
  company." There had been no need for this consoling angel, who with such
  practised tenderness was bending over the invalid...</p>

  <p>De Moncada went downstairs and summoned the padrone, who had a thousand
  apologies, a million regrets...the four miserable strangers proved, upon
  investigation, to be most dubious characters...he was about to forbid them
  the inn, to send for the police...</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the kind, leave these people to their designs.
  They amuse me&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>"But if your Excellency has any treasures&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am well able to protect them."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" the padrone ventured on a whisper of timid respect&mdash;"one
  little word&mdash;there is a Lady, I hear&mdash;if your Excellency will deign
  to listen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A decoy?"</p>

  <p>"No less. She travels with them, but apart, her tricks have emptied many
  pockets&mdash;such a charming creature with so well-bred an air!"</p>

  <p>"Of what use would she be to them," smiled De Moncada drily, "if she were
  not precisely that? Not a word. I will deal with the case, which I understood
  perfectly from the first." And he smiled at the recollection of the biscuits
  eaten from the silver paper, which, when flung away, no doubt contained the
  message&mdash;"Take care, we are watched."</p>

  <p>The padrone permitted himself a sigh.</p>

  <p>"No doubt the poor lady cannot help herself, they are her
  masters&mdash;she could not get away from them if she would."</p>

  <p>De Moncada went out into the garden; the fireflies danced among the
  apricot trees on the wall, the stars formed a scattered coronal over Verona,
  the dusky violet of the sky was stained by the golden lights of the city; a
  church bell was ringing, a guitar strumming; the windows were open on the
  balcony of the <i>piano nobile</i>, standing beneath, De Moncada could hear
  his brother's voice, his excited laughter; they were playing chess; their
  hands were frequently touching as they moved the pieces of crystal and
  ebony.</p>

  <p>"How shall I deal with Flaminio when he discovers who she is? I have
  bought him everything he desires, shall I not buy him also this illusion? And
  is not that the only enviable gift&mdash;illusion, the starry canopy?"</p>

  <p>When he went upstairs the game of chess was over and Flaminio lay reposed,
  half-asleep on his cushions, the yellow silk book of verse from which he had
  been reading aloud, slipping from his fingers...at the far end of the room
  stood the lady, graced with the tender shadows of lamplight which muted her
  charms to a wraithlike loveliness; she held the case that contained the
  medals of Otto and Tiberius; her fingers were on the clasp.</p>

  <p>As De Moncada knew her prey his course became clear; they must be
  accomplished rogues, since he carried with him nothing more valuable than
  that suite of medals.</p>

  <p>Flaminio roused at his entrance, beckoned to him and whispered that she
  was sweeter than Isabella, than honey, than jasmine, that she had effaced the
  stinging memory of Isabella...</p>

  <p>"You know, I have been musing about her ever since I saw her first. Is it
  not a charming, romantical episode? So strange, so delicious, I feel sure she
  will cure me&mdash;or make my last weeks delightful."</p>

  <p>De Moncada pressed his brother's hand, so thin, so hot, looked into that
  wasted, happy face and remembered all the wise, regretful doctors had said of
  that incurable malady and the fantasies it brings; when his brother slept he
  went to the corner where the lady still stood; obscured, silent, he took the
  case of medals from the cabinet at her side where, furtively, she had placed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Signora, my brother's attendants will take him to his chamber, but you
  must wait here till I return."</p>

  <p>"Yes." She gazed at him very earnestly, as if beseeching an explanation,
  he had nothing more to say; but, before he left the <i>piano nobile</i>, he
  gave instructions to his lackeys to keep the lady close until he came
  back.</p>

  <p>In the common parlour of "The Lily Pot" the four dingy men sat gloomily
  over a supper of garlic stew and sour wine; they had not that appearance of
  confidence De Moncada would have expected from the hopefulness of their
  present enterprise; they were all considerably alarmed at his entrance, the
  more so as he locked the door behind him; by this they saw he was in concert
  with the padrone, and (they feared) the police.</p>

  <p>One asked with servile insolence:</p>

  <p>"What does your Magnificence in our poor company?"</p>

  <p>De Moncada placed the case of medals on the dirty table; four pairs of
  eyes flashed to this, then to his face, implacable with the composure of the
  well-bred.</p>

  <p>"I believe that these medals are the object of your present industry? No
  doubt His Serene Highness would pay a good price for the golden Otto
  alone."</p>

  <p>He who appeared to be the leader of the quartette replied, with admirable
  presence of mind:</p>

  <p>"We can compromise no great names, but it is quite true that we could find
  a market for the medals, but&mdash;" he shrugged, "we could not get your
  Excellency's price."</p>

  <p>The others grinned at this impudence, but De Moncada said:</p>

  <p>"On the contrary you are well able to do so, you have with you a
  lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They all peered forward.</p>

  <p>"A lady?"</p>

  <p>"You take me&mdash;'tis a creature too pretty for your business." De
  Moncada glanced impressively from one to another of the expectant evil faces
  and removed squeamishly a pace away from such greasy ruffians. "I have a
  fancy to take her into my household."</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency's household?" Their amazement was amusing; they gaped at
  each other, they nudged frayed elbows into lean ribs; they mouthed plainly
  enough&mdash;"Hist, 'tis a lunatic!"</p>

  <p>De Moncada dealt with them briskly.</p>

  <p>"The case of medals is yours if you at once leave Verona and make no
  attempt to molest the lady, who is, henceforth, one of my retinue; in brief,
  I buy her from you."</p>

  <p>The leader of the four rose, and bowed before the superb presence of the
  Spanish grandee.</p>

  <p>"A cavalier of industry has his honour, ours is pledged to carry out your
  wishes in every particular&mdash;at the price of the suite of medals."</p>

  <p>"Should I see you," replied De Moncada, "anywhere near my equipage I
  deliver you at once to the police, and I have no doubt you will be broken on
  the wheel."</p>

  <p>He watched them contemptuously as they clutched at the case, tore it open
  and gloated over the treasures...Flaminio had cared so little for these
  expensive rarities...the girl was more cheaply bought...to purchase a dream
  with gold, that were cleverly done, eh?</p>

  <p>One ruffian lamented:</p>

  <p>"Yet, I regret Rosetta, 'twill take us long to train such another."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" another snarled, cringing before De Moncada. "I would sell
  twenty wenches for the Tiberius set alone&mdash;I will at once send Rosetta
  to your Excellency."</p>

  <p>De Moncada unlocked the door.</p>

  <p>"She is already in my apartments."</p>

  <p>They shot glances at each other and appeared confounded; then sly laughter
  overcame them.</p>

  <p>"We did not know, Excellency, the jade was so quick and cunning."</p>

  <p>He flung open the door.</p>

  <p>"Wretches, begone, and remember that if you ever permit yourselves in my
  sight again you are no better than dead men."</p>

  <p>They bowed, they scraped, they slobbered thanks and were indeed gone
  across the sala d'entrata into the warm gaiety of the night.</p>

  <p>De Moncada was as convinced that he would never see them again as he was
  of his own eternal salvation; he returned light-hearted to his prisoner of
  the <i>piano nobile</i>; reconciled to her situation, she was seated at his
  costly harpsichord, playing by the light of pure wax candles in crystal
  stands some music of his she had found on the keyboard&mdash;a setting of
  verses by Carlo Goldoni.</p>

  <p>"Donna Leonilda, your duenna," she smiled, "begged me to play so that your
  brother might hear in his chamber." And she sang, in a voice sweet as
  honeycomb, fine as silk, words so full of gaiety that they filled the
  gracious room with sparkles of gold.</p>

  <p>De Moncada advanced, master of the situation and of her destiny; she rose
  and did not seem frightened.</p>

  <p>"Child," he said, though he was but little the elder his gravity saved
  this title from absurdity, "I have rescued you from your odious
  employment&mdash;I have purchased your freedom and in return I expect some
  service from you."</p>

  <p>She curtsied; she was not the woman ever to say "I do not
  understand"&mdash;her method was to wait till all was clear.</p>

  <p>"The four ruffians who were your masters have gone," he continued. "I gave
  them the case of medals you were about to&mdash;remove&mdash;and they will
  not be seen again. I shall now keep you in my household and, Faustina or
  Rosetta, whichever is your name, I expect you to maintain before my brother,
  the very silly tale you told us."</p>

  <p>She asked:</p>

  <p>"Does he believe it?"</p>

  <p>"He is young, romantical, ill. It has been my pride to buy him every toy
  he requires&mdash;I wish to buy him this dream."</p>

  <p>"To draw over his common skies the starry canopy, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You're quick. You will have no difficulty in playing the part I have
  assigned to you."</p>

  <p>Her response to these commands was not what he had expected; she sat down
  on the seat before the harpsichord.</p>

  <p>"You're slow. And absurd. Did I not tell you this afternoon that your life
  is so artificial that you understand nothing?"</p>

  <p>"I understand very well that you are the accomplice of these cavaliers of
  industry. And it is impossible for us to dispute. I must ask you to play the
  part I have assigned to you, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She filled in his impressive pause:</p>

  <p>"The police, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"You could expect no more than justice. But I would give our compact a
  more elegant turn. I have saved you from a detestable existence, and you I am
  sure, are soft-hearted. I beg you to consider my brother."</p>

  <p>"I do. And I have your meaning. He is grievously ill and has taken a
  fantastic fancy for me&mdash;my foolish tale was magic to him, and not to rob
  him of that enchantment I am to continue to play a
  part&mdash;until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Moncada answered:</p>

  <p>"It is impossible that my brother can live very long," and crossed himself
  without discovering his pain.</p>

  <p>"I am all compassion," she sighed, more outwardly distressed than he. "And
  were I what you think, I would gladly play the persecuted damsel to give a
  noble cavalier a little ease. But, unfortunately, signor, you have wasted
  your case of medals, your time and your patience. I am not the partner of
  these thieves."</p>

  <p>At that De Moncada became angry; he thought that he deserved at least
  candour.</p>

  <p>"How have you so much impudence? I found you with the case in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Pure idle curiosity, I assure you," she replied sadly. "Your brother was
  reading poetry and I was&mdash;bored."</p>

  <p>De Moncada permitted himself a smile.</p>

  <p>"Come then, with your next invention. If you are not these men's decoy,
  who are you?"</p>

  <p>"You would never believe me if I told you the truth."</p>

  <p>"I already know the truth," but he was a little puzzled, a little shaken
  by her steadfast expression; to strengthen himself he added with grandeur. "I
  am not accustomed to make mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Alas! you are not accustomed to have them pointed out."</p>

  <p>They were interrupted by the <i>padrone</i>, escorted by the lackeys,
  still insisting on being brought into His Excellency's
  presence&mdash;pompous, important, with deep reverences to the lady; with
  much parade he handed to De Moncada the case of medals&mdash;His Excellency
  would forgive the intrusion, but he must deliver this personally&mdash;the
  case had His Excellency's name and arms&mdash;eh, a fortunate chance!</p>

  <p>Pale with chagrin De Moncada demanded:</p>

  <p>"Where has this been obtained? You did not dare to inform the police about
  these men?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, but they were already well known in that quarter and were
  arrested as they were about to leave the city; this, with other stolen
  property, was found on them&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>De Moncada was about to explain, in deep vexation&mdash;"I <i>gave</i>
  them the medals"&mdash;when the padrone added:</p>

  <p>"And with them was the little minx of whom I ventured to warn your honour,
  the sly Rosetta&mdash;"</p>

  <p>De Moncada, being quite unable to speak, the lady replied:</p>

  <p>"The noble cavalier is grateful to you for your zeal&mdash;I congratulate
  you on the activity of the police in Verona."</p>

  <p>The tone in which she said this caused both to look at her; she seemed to
  command the situation, and under cover of her serenity the padrone took his
  leave; the young man stared at her and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Is it possible I am a fool?"</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that any of us are not?"</p>

  <p>"But I thought 'twas you the padrone pointed out&mdash;and the silver
  paper&mdash;was there no message in it?"</p>

  <p>Plainly she did not understand his allusion; he told her the episode of
  the biscuit, and she forebore to laugh, but answered:</p>

  <p>"How many different tales I could tell you and how doubtful you would be
  of them all!"</p>

  <p>"I hardly deserve the truth&mdash;but of your charity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not lower thy Spanish pride, cavalier, 'tis that which I from the
  first, admired in thee."</p>

  <p>At this familiar address he came nearer, forgetting his late discomfiture;
  lovely were the wax lights in the pleasant chamber, the fireflies danced
  without under the stars, the night flowers were prodigal of their perfume;
  the young man felt that till this moment his life had been of an intolerable
  formality, filled with pedantries and follies; she put her hand lightly on
  his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"What did you say to me to-day in the amphitheatre&mdash;' Beneath that
  Campanian luxury all seemed transformed '? Such a starry veil, shot with many
  rich colours could I weave for thee&mdash;dost thou remember <i>Civita
  Nova</i> and the tower on the sea shore?"</p>

  <p>"I remember." He was enthralled; for the first time in many months he had
  forgotten his brother; she held out hopes to him as the sirens in the wall
  paintings held out branches of rosy coral to the plumed heroes; he, as they,
  paused to take the gift.</p>

  <p>"A woman looked down on thee as thou went by in the blue afternoon, the
  sea was turning gold as she came down the stairs with a little Indian
  groom&mdash;'Stay, cavalier, stay!'&mdash;but thou would'st not pause."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I never knew!"</p>

  <p>"So I followed thee. I am rich, free, a princess. I do what I
  please&mdash;of all my suitors I chose thee. But thou! Where is thy nobility?
  In thy eyes I was a thief&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He implored her pardon, all his grandeur forgotten...yet knew that he
  could never hope for forgiveness; he was worse than a fool, he accused
  himself bitterly of every stupidity, of every meanness; all the painted
  sirens looking at him seemed to smile in unison at his surrender.</p>

  <p>She assured him, with gentle sighs, that this was too late&mdash;"One
  misses by a hair what a world of regrets will never regain."</p>

  <p>This was the one moment of the young man's life beside which all the
  others seemed a crowded nothingness; the lady leant towards him and kissed
  him; the fireflies and the stars seemed to dance into the lonely chamber and
  the sirens on the walls to catch them on their branches of coral...</p>

  <p>She broke his enchantment with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou have thy starry canopy withdrawn?"</p>

  <p>She drew away from him; still laughing she emptied her pockets on the
  harpsichord...his jewels, his brother's watch, the case of medals..."Was it
  ever so easy to fool a man!" She had stolen the last under his very
  eyes..."Though I do not work for these four ugly ruffians, you were correct
  as to my profession."</p>

  <p>The candles burnt clear on a cold world; the night air was bitter; the
  impossible pleasure, the incredible happiness had, in vanishing, left an
  acrid perfume behind, the ashes of illusion reeked in the nostrils of De
  Moncada; but his breeding enabled him to preserve his composure even in face
  of her mockery.</p>

  <p>"One is fortunate if one can even kiss one's chimera&mdash;why did you
  tell me? You might have escaped with your plunder."</p>

  <p>She answered with what he knew was not the truth.</p>

  <p>"I could not resist showing you how clever I was," and she turned,
  empty-handed, to the door, knowing the kiss had secured her from
  punishment.</p>

  <p>Doña Leonilda opened the folding doors' that led to the bedchamber of the
  younger brother.</p>

  <p>"The Conde Flaminio is very ill&mdash;he is light-headed and asks
  continuously for the lady."</p>

  <p>"Doña Faustina, a noble orphan who travels in our charge as far as Rome,"
  said De Moncada, with a grand gesture towards the lady at the door, "she
  will, out of her great compassion and gentleness attend you to my
  brother."</p>

  <p>The duenna, wiping a tear, hurried back to her patient; the lady
  hesitated, her mockery vanished in distress...she had never met such a
  foolish man nor one who had made her behave so foolishly...sharp regrets
  stung till she sighed in pain.</p>

  <p>"Signora, my brother is waiting."</p>

  <p>Without giving him a glance she passed between the folding doors the
  duenna had left open; De Moncada heard the joyful cry with which his brother
  greeted her; he carefully put away the riflings she had returned: "The dreams
  of an Emperor, the pleasures of a Tiberius lie now in a little yellow
  coin&mdash;the arena of Verona bereft of the silken veil that gave illusion
  to thousands is grown with weeds and used by mountebanks&mdash;I believed I
  had clasped a divinity and found I embraced a pickpocket who wanted my
  watch...without such changes and deception love would be very dull."</p>

  <p>The grandee listened to a pleasant voice singing very low to the sick man;
  it seemed that the painted sirens hid their faces, that the heroes sailed
  away and that the false flames of the fireflies withered in the beams of the
  moon which began to blaze over Verona.</p>

  <p>"Surely her behaviour means that she loves me&mdash;she has all the arts
  that create illusion&mdash;what more could I demand of Venus? Surely she will
  help me to draw the rosy veil over the dying eyes of my brother&mdash;what
  more could I ask of the Holy Virgin?"</p>

  <p>The moon rising above the towers of Verona sent a pure radiance that
  shamed the wax lights in the pleasant chamber; the sirens faded into a mere
  design of rose and gold while the Spanish grandee added to himself:</p>

  <p>"I am indeed fortunate."</p>

     id="ch-05-5"></a>AN ANECDOTE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Told to the Cardinal Archbishop, Prince Louis de Rohan,
  at Strasbourg, of the Maréchal le Duc de Pillars and the Revolt of the
  Camisards.</i> [CEVENNES, FRANCE, 18th Century.]<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Monseigneur the Maréchal de Villars rode into the town of Lodéve, after
  riding through devastated Languedoc, in a contemplative mood. Although this
  was his own country it was as strange to him as if it had been the centre of
  the newly-discovered Indies; he had been sent to quell the revolt of the
  Camisards, those French Protestants who, for six years, had defied the
  authority of His Most Christian Majesty. It was, of course, a very
  extraordinary thing that it was necessary for a Maréchal de France, one who
  had contended on equal terms with the greatest generals of the age, who had
  served with glory for ten years in Flanders and was one of the most
  consummate politicians and courtiers at the Court of Versailles, to be sent
  to quell the rebellion of a handful of heretics and peasants. There were
  those who were surprised that Louis Hector, Duc de Villars, had accepted such
  a task&mdash;even to please the aged and querulous King, who regarded him
  with close affection, even in the face of the rewards and flatteries that
  same affection promised in the case of success; but M. de Villars was one of
  the most amiable, as well as one of the most able of men, and, remarking
  "Another ribbon with a jewel at the end will incommode nobody," he had taken
  his three thousand dragoons and, after tedious and slow marching, established
  his headquarters at Lodéve, in the midst of that gloomy range of desolate
  mountains, The Cevennes, where the desperate and frantic Protestants made
  that last stand which disturbed with a civil war a kingdom that had too many
  other wars to confront.</p>

  <p>M. de Villars (his fine countenance thoughtful) had ridden through these,
  to him, unknown regions, so wild, sombre and remote from what he called
  civilization; he had passed burnt villages, ruined churches, razed granges,
  and smouldering farms, and turning in his saddle, had made this ironic
  comment "that but for the hills it might have been Flanders so complete was
  the devastation." His predecessors in authority had not been
  merciful&mdash;torturing and burning, the rack, the wheel, and the gibbet had
  been for six years tried as a means to bring the Camisards to reason; most of
  the inhabitants of Languedoc were in the galleys, in prisons, in exile, but
  there still was the obstinate remnant, led by a certain Captain Cavalier, who
  had shown himself a bold and resolute leader with the power of inspiring
  confidence in his men. Perhaps not more than six thousand of these fanatics,
  ensconced in the woods and caves of the gloomy mountains where the Rhone
  divides le Bas Languedoc from the Province of Dauphiné; mystical, desperate
  heretics who had witnessed and survived the atrocities committed by Du
  Chaila, Archpriest of The Cevennes, ferocious, exalted avengers of innocent
  blood who had helped to drag Du Chaila out of his house and murder him one
  howling winter night, obstinate rebels who were resolved at no cost to submit
  to Roman Catholic government; a Maréchal de France was to subdue this handful
  of untrained heretics, of rude peasants.</p>

  <p>"Who is this Cavalier?" asked M. de Villars indifferently.</p>

  <p>No one knew; some said he was a baker's boy, some a farmer's lout; in that
  devastated and desolate country there was no one to give him exact news of
  Captain Cavalier...the few wretched people left on the ruined land fled at
  the approach of the spreading armies.</p>

  <p>De Villars' instructions at Versailles had been precise enough: "Get
  Cavalier, and the revolt is quelled." And the Maréchal had wagered a thousand
  <i>louis d'or</i> that he would get Cavalier and quell the revolt and be back
  at Versailles in three months...and that, <i>mon Dieu!</i> was too long an
  exile...</p>

  <p>Established at Lodéve he disclosed his plans to no one, but he stopped the
  persecutions instantly; there were no more arrests, the hangman rested,
  gibbet and wheel waited in vain for fresh prey; after a we k or so of this
  indulgence, the tormented people who survived began slowly to creep again
  about the ruins of their devastated homes. M. de Villars, amiable and
  composed in Lodéve, waited and watched, accepting boredom with good breeding,
  and took the opportunity of adding a few chapters to his "Mémoires" on the
  arts of war. It was a hot August day of sultry, brazen heat when a man
  requested permission to see the Maréchal de Villars; this stranger was at
  once admitted to the soldier's presence; this stranger, who had said he was a
  native of The Cevennes (his accent proved this at least to be true) and that
  he was a Roman Catholic gentleman, bearing the name of La Fleurette.</p>

  <p>The Maréchal de Villars received him in the sombre, ill-lit parlour with a
  serene courtesy that should have put him at his ease, but he appeared rather
  overwhelmed by the presence of the Maréchal, who was one of the handsomest,
  most extravagant and charming of men at the Court of Versailles, then in the
  prime of his years and the height of his glory, and adorned in all the
  bravery of the most sumptuous Court in Europe, laced uniform, orders,
  tassels&mdash;as carefully arrayed as if he was in Flanders, in the company
  of ruling Princes.</p>

  <p>La Fleurette, on the contrary, wore a coffee-coloured suit of a provincial
  cut, a plain neck-cloth, carelessly dressed hair, and a hat without buckles
  or plumes; his lean face was dark and earnest, and he had powerful, nervous
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Monseigneur," he began defiantly, overriding his own embarrassment, "I am
  a Roman Catholic&mdash;I have suffered at the hands of these Camisards, these
  rebels, for every one severity which has been visited on them by the
  Government they have retorted with two, or even three atrocities, they are
  robbers, murderers, ravishers, and they are kept together by this man who
  calls himself Captain Cavalier."</p>

  <p>"So much I knew," agreed the Maréchal pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"It's extraordinary," exclaimed La Fleurette, walking up and down
  uneasily, "that a Maréchal and peer of France should be sent against such a
  horde of ruffians, and "&mdash;he paused, significantly, and added with a
  certain ferocity&mdash;"do you believe, Monseigneur le Maréchal, that you
  will succeed in capturing this Captain Cavalier, or in coming to terms with
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," replied M. de Villars, "both my training and experience have
  taught me to believe nothing. Do you know anything of this Captain Cavalier?"
  he added indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I know a great deal. I have wormed myself into his confidence. He
  believes me one of his supporters now, and I have come here to betray him
  into your hands."</p>

  <p>"For what reason and for what reward?" asked M. de Villars, who had heard
  this manner of offer a great many times in the course of his numerous
  campaigns.</p>

  <p>"The man is ruining the country. But for him the others would submit; the
  terms he asks are impossible, His Majesty would never grant them. Why, the
  bold ruffian dares to demand the release of all the Protestants from the
  prisons and galleys, and the guarantee of liberty of religion in The
  Cevennes!" La Fleurette laughed fervently and harshly, his quick eyes
  averted.</p>

  <p>To this outburst M. de Villars replied, with a pleasant smile: "Is this
  Cavalier a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>La Fleurette appeared startled, he was taken aback, and hesitated, and
  then said: "No, he is a peasant."</p>

  <p>"But, I think, a noble and generous one?" added the Maréchal indulgently.
  "Tell me how you propose to deliver him into my hands."</p>

  <p>"A woman baits the trap," answered La Fleurette sombrely. "He will come
  to-morrow night to the Château of Castelnau, which is outside the
  town&mdash;you may have seen it, Monseigneur. The lady is a Roman Catholic
  and a Loyalist; but she has, at length, by agreement with me, consented to
  receive this rebel-lover of hers who has so long solicited her in vain.
  Captain Cavalier will be alone with the lady and her servants, all Loyalists,
  in the château to-morrow night. If you come with a few of your guards, you
  can surprise him."</p>

  <p>M. de Villars smiled, he flicked a speck of dust from his brocaded cuff
  and remarked, quietly, "I shall be there."</p>

  <p>"I should advise you to come yourself," added La Fleurette, "and not to
  bring too many soldiers, for that will attract suspicion; nor is there any
  need for a considerable force, Cavalier will be undefended."</p>

  <p>"I shall come myself," replied the Maréchal, who seemed amused at the
  other's rustic simplicity.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," added La Fleurette, and this time, violently: "If you do not,
  I and some others who are in this will think that you are afraid...Cavalier
  is a man...he is never afraid...we should like to know that you are his
  equal."</p>

  <p>"I will certainly come myself," replied M. de Villars, and, after a
  moment's pause and reflection, M. La Fleurette was ushered out with a certain
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>The Maréchal had the curiosity to go to the tall, narrow window and watch
  his strange visitor cross the courtyards, pass the sentries and the groups of
  lounging soldiers, mount a shaggy-looking horse and ride through the quiet,
  hot streets of Lodéve. M. de Villars reflected: "I have three thousand
  dragoons quartered here, and he knew it&mdash;brave, no doubt, as he said
  himself."</p>

  <p>It was a night of suffocating heat and purple thunder clouds riding
  against the moon, which hung above the gloomy mountains of The Cevennes as M.
  de Villars rode up to the Château of Castelnau; he halted awhile outside the
  gates of the garden; all was quiet, all looked, even by the moonlight, as
  every residence in The Cevennes looked, ruined and deserted; beyond the
  gardens were dense woods.</p>

  <p>M. de Villars was admitted instantly, at his first light knock on the
  door, and one ragged, abased creature led his horse away, while another
  conducted the soldier to a decayed and dismal room with tarnished furniture,
  lit only by the coarse rays from a broken lamp; La Fleurette was seated at
  the rough table with a pile of papers under his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Monseigneur," he said, 'rising; his weather-beaten face was
  pallid, his lips strained and his eyes bloodshot. "How many soldiers have you
  brought?"</p>

  <p>"None," replied the Maréchal serenely, seating himself immediately by
  right of his rank.</p>

  <p>"None? But have you not come here to capture Captain Cavalier?"</p>

  <p>"I believe," replied the Maréchal, "that Captain Cavalier and I can come
  to terms without the aid of a troop of horse."</p>

  <p>La Fleurette stared at him with savage incredulity. He snatched up the
  lamp and held it closer, while he scanned the calm and handsome features of
  M. le Maréchal de Villars, who endured this scrutiny with the most amiable of
  glances and smiling serenity.</p>

  <p>"You have come here alone!" gasped La Fleurette, "two miles outside the
  town, in this lonely part, without even a couple of guards?"</p>

  <p>"You may see for yourself," answered de Villars negligently; "you are, I
  perceive, of the type that only personal evidence will satisfy."</p>

  <p>La Fleurette set down the lamp. "I could scarcely credit," he muttered,
  "that any man, even a fine gentleman, could be such a fool. If I told you
  that five hundred of the most resolved Camisards were in the woods round this
  house, and in an inner chamber were their most trusted leaders&mdash;Captain
  Cavalier's officers, Ravenal, Conderc, Rustalet&mdash;that you have walked
  straightly, deliberately, into a trap&mdash;a simple, banal sort of a
  trap...By heaven!" he added, in an access of excitement, "I had not believed
  in a deed so easy!"</p>

  <p>M. de Villars did not reply; baffled by his look of amusement La Fleurette
  hastily left the room, locking the door behind him.</p>

  <p>A quick scrutiny, a swift enquiry, showed him that the Maréchal had spoken
  the truth&mdash;he had brought no soldiers, not even a valet with him. La
  Fleurette therefore returned eagerly to his sumptuous prisoner, who had
  neither changed his attitude nor his expression, but sat pensive, as if
  slightly bored, at the mean table which held the lantern and the papers.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied, M. la Fleurette, that I am alone?"</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied," replied La Fleurette roughly. "Sign, in the name of the
  King of France, these Camisard terms, for which they have been fighting for
  six years!" He struck his hand violently on the pile of papers, "Here they
  are, carefully drafted&mdash;our demands&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Maréchal, whose splendour was strangely out of place in the sordid
  room, and whose serenity contrasted strangely with the violence of the other,
  replied coolly:</p>

  <p>"My dear Captain Cavalier, I shall obviously sign nothing."</p>

  <p>"You know me, then?" cried he who had called himself "La Fleurette."</p>

  <p>"I know you, Captain Cavalier."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, since you know me," said the Camisard leader sternly, "I may
  tell you, M. de Villars, who are so great a soldier, so brilliant a
  politician, that you have walked into a very simple trap&mdash;there is no
  lady in this Château, it is the meeting place of the leaders of what you term
  'the rebellion'. We planned this desperate scheme to get hold of you; we
  thought we could dispose of your troop of horse and hold you prisoner until
  you signed our terms, but I never hoped it would be as easy as this..."</p>

  <p>"It is not so easy," replied M. de Villars, "though not, I hope, too
  difficult. Of course, I shall not sign."</p>

  <p>"You are in my power," replied Captain Cavalier harshly.</p>

  <p>"Precisely for that reason I shall not sign. And you, my dear Cavalier,
  will not endeavour to force me. On the contrary, you will permit me to ride
  <i>back</i> to Lodéve, exactly as "&mdash;he rose as he spoke&mdash;"I
  permitted <i>you</i> to ride <i>out</i> of Lodéve yesterday."</p>

  <p>"But you did not know who I was," protested Captain Cavalier.</p>

  <p>M. de Villars turned away his face with a look of amusement.</p>

  <p>"I brought your description with me to Languedoc, my dear Captain
  Cavalier; your movements, too, have been watched; the Government has its
  spies. I knew you yesterday, and I guessed your trap...not so difficult; I am
  now in your power, precisely as you were in mine yesterday; then, by simply
  lifting my finger, I could have sent you to the rack or the wheel; now, by
  lifting a finger you can send me to something equally unpleasant. But, of
  course," added the Maréchal carelessly, "it would be impossible for you to do
  so."</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Captain Cavalier roughly and fiercely, "I am not a fine
  courtier, I am not a peer of France, I am not even a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"But I," M. de Villars gently reminded him, "treated you as one, Captain
  Cavalier."</p>

  <p>They looked steadily at each other in the uncertain light, and the glance
  of M. de Villars bore down that of Captain Cavalier.</p>

  <p>"It's I who have been the fool," muttered the rebel sullenly and
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said the Maréchal amiably, "merely a little impetuous."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here?" questioned Captain Cavalier, baffled and
  humiliated, "why put yourself in my power?"</p>

  <p>"That we might come to a direct and personal understanding. It is possible
  in no other way," replied the Maréchal. "I have always liked to meet my
  opponents face to face. It is my office to quell this rebellion, yours to
  maintain it. I have never failed in any task yet that has been set me, and
  this is by no means the most difficult of my tasks."</p>

  <p>"A threat?" demanded Captain Cavalier, "and from a man in my power?"</p>

  <p>The Maréchal smiled: "From the man who had you in <i>his</i> power
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>Frowning, uneasy, troubled, Cavalier pointed with a gaunt finger to the
  papers he had prepared. "Sign those," he said, "and the war is over. I meant
  that you should sign them, with one pistol at your head and another at your
  ribs."</p>

  <p>"But, by now, you will have perceived, my dear Captain Cavalier," replied
  the Maréchal with his gracious smile, "that that was rather a crude error of
  judgment&mdash;slightly...provincial! You will perceive also that it would
  have been perfectly useless. No force or menace would induce me to sign what
  I did not wish to sign."</p>

  <p>"What is to prevent me," muttered Captain Cavalier, "from giving the
  signal to have you delivered to those who would have no scruples or nice
  feelings in dealing with you&mdash;those who would tear you limb from limb,
  as the representative of the King and the Pope?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to prevent you," declared the Maréchal delicately, "but
  it would be without precedent for one General so to treat another."</p>

  <p>"I am no General," replied Cavalier sullenly and uneasily, "I am a mere
  peasant of Languedoc, and proud to take command of her inhabitants..."</p>

  <p>"You are a soldier," returned M. de Villars, "and, I believe, a noble and
  generous one. I have heard it said in Versailles that Cavalier has behaved
  like a gentleman, though a heretic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You heard that at Versailles?" asked the rebel, looking up across the
  thick, hot shadows of the narrow room.</p>

  <p>"I have heard at Versailles, and elsewhere nothing but honour of you,
  Cavalier; I should like to see you on my staff, when next year I open the
  campaign in Flanders."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here?" muttered the rebel, baffled and overwhelmed
  before the serene glance, the pleasant voice, the commanding presence.</p>

  <p>"To make your better acquaintance, my dear Cavalier," replied the Maréchal
  suavely, "that object being achieved, it is useless to prolong the interview
  to the point of tedium."</p>

  <p>With no more than this, M. de Villars rose and left the room with as much
  ease and leisure as if he had been sauntering from one gallery of Versailles
  to another, drawing on his gloves and adjusting his fringed sash after his
  usual manner.</p>

  <p>Captain Cavalier did not attempt to impede his enemy's departure; he fell
  back naturally before him and followed him down the dusty, dark stairs out
  into the hot moonlit courtyard, where he whistled, and sullenly ordered the
  ragged groom to bring the Maréchal's horse, which came pacing delicately
  through the desolation.</p>

  <p>The Camisard leaders within the house and the Camisard soldiers hidden
  without the house waited tensely for their chief's signal; it was not
  given.</p>

  <p>When the Maréchal found the long white road to Lodéve clear before him,
  and Cavalier who had escorted him a short distance on foot, was sullenly
  leaving him, he turned in his saddle:</p>

  <p>"Captain Cavalier, here is the counterpart of those papers you wished me
  to sign&mdash;the terms, I believe, are the same." He took from his breast a
  sealed packet and held it out.</p>

  <p>"Signed?" cried Captain Cavalier, halting, "already signed?"</p>

  <p>"Signed before I left Versailles," replied M. de Villars, "my instructions
  were to grant you the terms if I found you worthy of them&mdash;if I could
  trust you to keep them."</p>

  <p>The rebel leader grasped the package stupidly: "Signed before you left
  Versailles? And you never told me yesterday, or now when I might have had you
  killed for refusing to sign&mdash;I don't understand...why you played this
  part..."</p>

  <p>"Endeavour to do so," smiled the Maréchal, "it is well worth while. Good
  night, Captain Cavalier!"</p>

  <p>When the rebellion was over and peace was restored to the devastated
  province of Languedoc, when the Maréchal de Villars had returned to
  Versailles and had collected his thousand <i>louis d'or</i>, when Captain
  Cavalier had a pair of colours in His Majesty's Musketeers, someone had the
  curiosity to ask M. de Villars how he had contrived, after so many had
  failed, to subdue the obstinate and ferocious peasant and turn him into a
  loyal soldier of His Majesty?</p>

  <p>"By treating him as a gentleman," said the Maréchal de Villars
  negligently.</p>
