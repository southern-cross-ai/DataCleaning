  <h2><a name="ch-1"
     id="ch-1"></a>I. &mdash; HIS SERENE HIGHNESS EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">He had been away nearer a year than six months; he returned
  to his little court improved by his travels, his dignity softened by the air
  of a man who knows the world, his hair dressed after the fashion of Paris,
  his speech adorned with delicate allusions to kings and queens; he brought
  with him an English valet, a set of diamonds presented to him by the Doge of
  Venice (these the most notable among other gifts), and the affectation of
  French.</p>

  <p>Hesse-Homburg approved.</p>

  <p>A principality as small as this that his Serene Highness ruled over is apt
  to be unduly proud; the castle of Hesse-Homburg was built after the plan of
  Marli or Meudon, the gardens laid out in the manner of Versailles; etiquette
  was supreme, the court complete from the Lord Chancellor to the black pages;
  Mr. Denton, the English valet, was reminded, on his arrival, of a performance
  of opera-bouffe where all the comedians appear as nobles and there is no one
  left to represent the citizens, so that the King and his train constitute the
  kingdom. Indeed, Mr. Denton had seen estates in England that would have
  divided between them two countries the size of Hesse-Homburg, but his
  admirable discretion allowed no hint of his discernment to appear.</p>

  <p>There was a ball given in honour of his Serene Highness's return; the
  fountains played and coloured lights swung in the trees; ladies and gentlemen
  were painted, perfumed, pomaded, and laced into brocaded clothes; there was
  an orchestra of French fiddles on one of the castle terraces, and dancing in
  the long hall hung with portraits of the Prince-Electors of
  Hesse-Homburg.</p>

  <p>The moonlight lay over gardens and castle like the enchantment of a fairy
  tale; Prince Frederic George, the Elector's brother, found it dangerous in
  conjunction with the low appeal of the violins; the time of year was the
  turning point of spring into summer, and the scent of carnations and roses
  stirred the air; the fountains, pretty even to those who had been to Paris,
  were to Prince Frederic George magical in their silver rise and fall against
  the wet foliage that drooped over their basins. He was staring at them when
  his Serene Highness touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Now, I am at last at leisure," said that gentleman with a kind of frozen
  amiability. "Let us, Frederic, talk together."</p>

  <p>His brother bowed.</p>

  <p>"Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>They moved away from the fountains to a low seat under the laurels; the
  fiddles sounded in the distance, the plash of the water and a One rustle in
  the thick leaves; Prince Frederic George looked at his Serene Highness.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector was of a natural elegance schooled into artificial
  graces; his face was delicate, fair and faintly coloured, of a considerable
  hardness in the expression. At this particular moment he held his cane
  loosely in his long white fingers, and the blue tassels hanging from it swept
  his knee.</p>

  <p>"Now, in my absence," he said, "how have you employed the time?"</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George sat stiffly, by reason of his buckram coat and the
  folds of black velvet round his throat; he leant forward, slowly, resting a
  hand on each knee.</p>

  <p>"I have something to ask you, Monseigneur," he said, and coloured hotly in
  a way that annoyed his Serene Highness, who, even by this light, could
  perceive it.</p>

  <p>"It is of great importance;" Prince Frederic George began again, and again
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Of what nature?" questioned his brother coldly.</p>

  <p>There was a stir of satin as Prince Frederic George moved, and taking
  courage from the violins, the moonlight, and the scents of the flowers,
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"I love a lady," he said bluntly, "who, I think&mdash;" He checked
  himself, and his fierce blush deepened.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector's china blue eyes were cruelly unsympathetic.</p>

  <p>"Ah?" he answered. "Did Von Halzburg tell you of my approaching
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"No, Monseigneur." His brother looked startled.</p>

  <p>"We have kept it secret"&mdash;the other deigned a hard, sweet
  smile&mdash;"until it was finally arranged. Of course, the country was
  expecting it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Prince Frederic George. He felt in a delicate way that
  it had become still more difficult to speak to his immovable brother now.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" He raised the dark, honest eyes that were at such variance
  with his foppish dress.</p>

  <p>"I decided on a lady not unknown to you," answered his Serene Highness.
  "One who satisfies me with regard to fortune, person, and rank, our
  neighbour's daughter, the Princess Sophia Carola of Strelitz-Homburg."</p>

  <p>The violins were hushed, leaving the fall of the fountains to sound more
  clearly in the stillness.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector felt the sudden sense of a chill, of unaccountable
  discomfiture. He looked at his brother, a motionless, half-seen figure in the
  shade of the laurels.</p>

  <p>"And you?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George put his hand out along the seat, and clenched the
  smooth edge of the marble.</p>

  <p>"It is of no matter for me," he said dully.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness lifted his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As you please. Your love affairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The other caught him up with unceremonious quickness.</p>

  <p>"My love affairs!" His emphasis implied that the expression was blasphemy;
  then he lowered his voice again. "Your pardon, Monseigneur, I have no love
  affairs."</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector smiled; he was in no way interested. The violins began
  a prelude to the dance, a throbbing invitation that came trembling through
  the moon-cloaked flowers.</p>

  <p>"You intend to stay at Hesse-Homburg?" asked his Serene Highness. He
  turned his smooth face towards his brother.</p>

  <p>"What else?" the answer came from the thick shadows, quiet, a little
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector explained. There was very little, he said, for a
  younger son to do at home; abroad there were chances.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" assented Prince Frederic George. "Of what, Monseigneur?"</p>

  <p>"Of advancement." His Serene Highness spoke drily. "Here there can be
  nothing."</p>

  <p>The sense of dislike, of antipathy between them, seemed to loom, suddenly
  tremendous, like a tangible presence; they had always jarred on one
  another&mdash;never in such a fashion as to-night and now.</p>

  <p>"There are opportunities in Paris," said the Prince Elector, "in London,
  in Vienna&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And Hesse-Homburg is small for both of us," put in his brother. "Is not
  that what you would say?"</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness fondled the ribbons on his cane, and explained
  further, with the same even politeness, with the same hard eyes coldly
  stressing his words.</p>

  <p>He spoke of what he intended with his kingdoms, of the advantage of the
  match with the heiress of Strelitz-Homburg, of his chancellor Von Halzburg,
  of new appointments; he spoke at some length, always quietly.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George was not listening. When his brother ceased
  speaking, he turned with a weary slowness.</p>

  <p>"I shall stay in Hesse-Homburg, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>A fine flush rose in the Prince Elector's cheek.</p>

  <p>"As you wish," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness can find some appointment for me?"</p>

  <p>His brother would give no more than: "I will speak to Von Halzburg."</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George rose at this, bowed, and turned off down the
  well-set parterre, his hat in his hand. The Prince Elector looked after him
  with narrowed eyes, knowing that he hated him and not knowing why.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George walked towards the castle and the music of the
  violins. Such an extraordinary and terrible thing had been contained in his
  brother's brief words that he felt that the world had been altered by it.</p>

  <p>Sophia Carola was the betrothed of the Prince Elector; the elder was to
  have everything, even that, and for him there was nothing but silence.</p>

  <p>He walked up the steps and along the marble terrace, and, lifting his
  eyes, gazed into the mystic landscape that fell away beneath the glamour of
  the moon into unfathomable distances.</p>

  <p>He had never spoken to the Princess, nor to any other, of this deep secret
  of his; now, he never could. He did not question his brother's right nor his
  own helplessness; the etiquette, the formal courtliness inborn and inbred
  made him accept his fortune quietly with no more than a curious wonder at the
  pain in his heart, more intolerable than he could have believed possible.</p>

  <p>He walked up and down the terrace aimlessly, taking no heed of the people
  who passed him; they seemed to him like visions of the moonlight that he
  could put his hand through, such an unreality had come over the world.</p>

  <p>Presently he went in, avoided instinctively the rooms where they were
  dancing, and turned into a little circular antechamber softly lit with
  candles. The walls were painted with a gilt trellis through which roses
  climbed; the high ceiling was covered with pale pink clouds; in one corner, a
  sconce of candles either side, stood a gold bracket bearing a cupid, by
  Pigalle; behind it was a mirror.</p>

  <p>The Prince leant lifelessly against the wall, his soul as bound by
  conventions and the ceremonies of his position as his body was disguised by
  brocaded clothes and his face by powder and patches.</p>

  <p>The mirror reflected his slack figure in the stiff pink satin, his
  handsome face under the rolled grey curls, his hands either side of him
  resting against the white and gold wall.</p>

  <p>He was neither thinking nor lamenting; apathy had mastered him. When he
  raised his eyes to the Cupid, it had no meaning for him. He heard through the
  half-open door the sound of a distant music and voices, faint like echoes; he
  turned his head, and noticed dully the window open into the night and the
  setting moon. After a while he was aware of people entering the adjoining
  chamber, but he did not change his position. He heard a lady sing in a fine
  low voice. Harp and lute accompanied her. Presently he caught her words
  rising with the music:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  (Haste while the sun is high!)<br>
  Sumner gilds the heavy grain.<br>
  And the lark hangs in the sky.<br>
  <br>
  "When shall the morning some again?<br>
  'Tis only once for churls and kings.<br>
  Present joy's worth after pain,<br>
  And youth is heir of many things."</p><br>

  <p>The Prince moved from the wall, his check flushed, his lips stirred; he
  listened with his soul in his dark eyes.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  The sun once set shall rise no more.<br>
  So short a time to lose or gain.<br>
  Haste, ere the first glow shall be o'er."</p><br>

  <p>The Prince looked at Pigalle's Cupid, at his own face mirrored behind it,
  and his breath came unevenly.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  This day, this day alone is thine.<br>
  Up&mdash;for thy little space to reign,<br>
  Ere Death shall say, 'The night is mine'"</p><br>

  <p>The song ceased; the Prince went to the window and held back the rose silk
  curtain.</p>

  <p>The setting moon was showing in bars and gleams of silver behind the pine
  trees, and In the cast a slow pearl colour flushed the luminous sky. There
  was a sound of birds waking in the thick leaves, and the steady fall of the
  distant fountain.</p>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?"</p>

  <p>"The morning!" It was his heritage, his right; he was young; it was his
  hour, his chance; his horse waited in the stable, she lived only a few miles
  away&mdash;what was there to keep him?</p>

  <p>The once so potent reasons seemed follies now. What were his brother, the
  formalities, the conventions of the Court? Life was an adventure, a romance,
  and this day slowly breaking&mdash;his. He let the curtain fall; Pigalle's
  Cupid seemed smiling now; he left the antechamber.</p>

  <p>The rooms were empty, save for the tired servants putting out the candles.
  They stared to see the Prince still up, but he was only aware that the dawn
  shone brighter through every window that he passed.</p>

  <p>When he reached the hall he called one of the men, wearily carrying in the
  chairs from the terrace.</p>

  <p>"See that my horse be brought here&mdash;quickly."</p>

  <p>His masterful manner enforced his extraordinary command; he cared nothing
  what they thought of him, nor what tales were carried to his brother. He sent
  one of the sleepy black pages to fetch hat and cloak, and waited, leaning on
  the balustrade, looking into the garden. When he heard his horse's hoofs
  clatter on the pathway his heart gave a great bound; he put over his ball
  dress the cloak the negro brought, flung on the hat, and descended the wide,
  shining steps. The man there helped him to mount, then waited with a
  hesitating look.</p>

  <p>The Prince glanced at the castle; there was a light in his brother's room;
  beholding it, triumph, hatred, exaltation fired his blood.</p>

  <p>"Any message for his Serene Highness?" asked the servant.</p>

  <p>"None," answered the Prince, still looking at the light in the window. "I
  ride for my own pleasure to-night. If the Elector question you, tell him
  that&mdash;"</p>

  </div>

  <p>He put spurs to his horse; with no backward look at the castle, but with
  ardent eyes on the marvellous dawn ahead of him, all flaming opal now, he
  rode through the park into the open country, and took the long white high
  road to Strelitz-Homburg. And he sang under his breath:</p>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  Tis only once for churls or kings;<br>
  Present joy's worth future pain.<br>
  And youth is heir of many things."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a>II. &mdash; A RIDE ACROSS THE BORDERS</h2>

  <p class="first">It had been a perfect day: gold and blue from the first lift
  of the sun till this moment, when it neared the west. The hours had been full
  of enchantment for the Prince. He rode now down a quiet little village, and
  stopped at an inn, where he was an object of much wonderment.</p>

  <p>The gathered rustics saw a gentleman with an air of wild gaiety
  dismounting from a noble brown horse; his hair was almost shaken free from
  powder, and he wore no hat (having flung it disdainfully aside as he rode
  through the tempered sunshine of the glorious woods); his cloak, of an
  exquisite blue colour, showed satins beneath; the rustics marked the knots of
  gold ribbon at his knee, the red-heeled shoes he wore&mdash;and scented an
  adventure.</p>

  <p>The Prince, on his side, saw a low, thatched house with long shadows
  slanting under the caves, and the swallows in a row on the signpost. He
  entered the parlour, that looked over the great garden behind, and found it
  sweet beyond words.</p>

  <p>The walls were white, the ceiling was low; a great brown clock, curiously
  carved, ticked loudly; there was a long shelf filled with tankards and bright
  glittering glasses; huge deep chairs, their wooden arms polished with much
  use, stood about, cushioned in faded velvets. The window, with its diamond
  pane of thick greenish glass, was set wide, and the tall pinks nodded against
  the wide sill.</p>

  <p>A romance indeed!&mdash;and this, the fitting resting-place after a ride
  through fairyland. The Prince had not found ever anything so beautiful as he
  found this place. He went to the window; he saw a multitude of flowers that
  he did not know the names of, beyond the frail blossoms of apple trees, and
  beyond them the towers of the Castle of Strelitz-Homburg.</p>

  <p>He had crossed the borders; he was in her country.</p>

  <p>Presently he went out into the garden, and walked slowly, quiet with
  happiness, among the flowers. Hesse-Homburg and his brother were in another
  world. In his incongruous ball dress, with his cloak falling from his
  shoulders and his bright hair for once unloosed, he wandered among the uneven
  paths, looking at the flowers, stooping now and then to lift their heads in
  his hands. Once he brought his lips to the open roses.</p>

  <p>At the end of the garden was a row of beehives; behind them a wooden
  paling shut off the orchard. A few white sheep rested under the apple trees,
  and the fallen blossoms lay delicately on the tall grass.</p>

  <p>The Prince looked beyond this to her castle walls.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  'Tis only once for churls or kings.<br>
  Present joy's worth future pain,<br>
  And youth is heir of many things."</p><br>

  <p>He would not let his May of life slip, he would not live to say, "Once I
  might have gone to her and put my fortune to the test, but I was afraid."</p>

  <p>Slowly through the flowers he went back, and because of something in his
  face they served him silently, though they wondered who this was that rode in
  dancing shoes and bore himself so carelessly.</p>

  <p>He took his meal alone in the low, fragrant parlour. The clock struck five
  in deep tones, a tortoiseshell cat jumped in at the window and rubbed itself
  against one of the empty chairs; a murmur of voices came softly through the
  half-open door.</p>

  <p>The Prince ate a little of the fresh white bread they brought him, then
  rose and shook out his hair afresh, and tied it with its long black ribbon.
  As he did this his cloak slipped and fell to the ground, and he stood
  revealed in his glimmering rose pink, with a great knot of dull crimson on
  one shoulder. The diamonds winked in his sword-hilt and in the brooch under
  his radiant face.</p>

  <p>The little fair-haired maid entered, and stood amazed. He turned with a
  sudden smile, and asked for some of the roses from the garden, and that his
  horse might be saddled. Her blue eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Have you run away?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Prince, "I have run away."</p>

  <p>"It is like a fairy tale," she answered. She picked up his cloak timidly,
  and gave it to him; then she was gone, light of foot, and he saw her pass the
  window, her plaits gleaming in the still sunshine. She came to his saddle bow
  when he had mounted with her hands full of flowers, and he rode away with her
  gifts of roses, white, pink, and red, tied with his handkerchief and hanging
  to his pommel.</p>

  <p>The way lay first through a little pine wood, then a narrow lane bordered
  with fields of young wheat winding into open meadow land, where the hawthorn
  was wonderful, and so at last into a broad white road with the castle gates
  and their guardian lions majestic ahead.</p>

  <p>He rode up to the entrance and past it to where the wall rose only to his
  horse's knees, and he could look over it and behold the sweeping park land
  beyond. And in the first glance he gave through the trees he saw her.</p>

  <p>She was with a company of ladies coming slowly down a shaded glade. She
  wore a lemon-coloured silk; she was not very near, but he knew her at once,
  even though her face was hidden.</p>

  <p>He dismounted, fastened the reins to a bough of a beech tree, and vaulted
  over the wall. For a moment he stood with his hand on his heart, looking at
  her across the long, level shadows and fading sunshine; then, as if he had
  called her, she turned from the others and came slowly towards him.</p>

  <p>He had not been daunted by the difficulties of his adventure, nor was he
  surprised by the ending to it&mdash;he found it only natural that she should
  come as if she knew he waited.</p>

  <p>He watched the little group of ladies disperse in the distance, and marked
  how the sunlight flickered through the leaves on her dress. She seemed to be
  in deep thought; her wide straw hat shadowed her face, and thy green ribbons
  on it fluttered idly on her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Carola," said the Prince.</p>

  <p>She stopped instantly and looked up; her hands, that had been locked
  behind her, fell apart.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, and she looked at him blankly.</p>

  <p>Her exquisite fair face held no expression; she seemed not to know him.
  The Prince laughed.</p>

  <p>"Carola!" he said again, and came towards her.</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;your Highness," she stammered. She stood motionless, fixing
  him with her beautiful eyes. He saw a miniature of his brother hanging on a
  chain round her long white throat, and it sent the blood into his face.</p>

  <p>"You know why I am here," he said. "To take you away. I have ridden all
  day&mdash;all day. God let me find you." He stepped up to her in a tumult of
  feeling. "I love you utterly."</p>

  <p>Never moving, and with no change in her face, she answered him:</p>

  <p>"You have heard of my betrothal?"</p>

  <p>"It is why I am here, Carola."</p>

  <p>She moved away, still with her eyes on him, and put her hand out against
  the smooth bole of the beech tree near. The last sunlight filtering through
  the foliage crept round her gleaming bodice and slender waist and lay in the
  folds of her long silk skirt. The Prince stood watching her, suddenly very
  pale.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Your brother," she said. "You&mdash;your Highness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have not come to speak of him," he answered. "What is he to
  us?&mdash;it is our day and our chance. I have thought you cared&mdash;I have
  known you cared."</p>

  <p>"For you?" she cried, and shrank against the tree.</p>

  <p>"For me," he answered. "I have come for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what have I done?" she said softly. "What have I done?"</p>

  <p>"You have made me love you. Are you sorry for it, Carola?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand; the light MI full on his disordered hair, his pale
  face, his tumbled dress, his intense eyes.</p>

  <p>"It will be for always," he said between his quick breaths. "For all our
  lives. We have this moment only&mdash;take that thing from above your heart,
  and come with me."</p>

  <p>"You hate him?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hate him&mdash;and you&mdash;you do not love him. We have had
  enough of lies. This morning in the dawn I saw the truth, and came to find
  you; the day has been paradise because it held the promise of this moment.
  Why don't you answer me?"</p>

  <p>"You speak madness," she said. "I must not listen. Go back. If they
  discovered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have told you that I love you," he answered passionately. "Can you
  think of anything else?" And then the mood, the impulse that had brought him,
  found vent in wild words; yet true words, eloquent and from the heart. He
  spoke of their cramped life, he laughed at the laws and conventions that
  bound then both, he set his teeth at his brother's name, he entreated her, he
  conjured her to listen to him&mdash;"in the name of God before it is too
  late."</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to interrupt. Her great bewildered eyes were fixed on
  him, her colourless face did not change; mute, with parted lips, she
  listened. He stepped before her at last. The moment of supreme crisis had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to say?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>He waited, and, so intent were they with one another, they did not see a
  lady coming silently across the grass toward them.</p>

  <p>"Why are you silent?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>She made a little movement, turned her head, and gave a low cry of
  terror.</p>

  <p>The lady had reached them; she looked from one to the other, and there was
  silence. It was the Margravine; the Prince returned her gaze defiantly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him, at his loosened hair and pale features, at his court
  dress, dishevelled with riding; she looked at her daughter very sharply, and
  her eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"What is the explanation?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>She was a gaunt woman, handsome, hard-eyed, and large of make; etiquette
  was her god; it was known she could be terrible.</p>

  <p>The young Prince faced her with loathing in his bearing; it was she who
  had contrived her daughter's marriage.</p>

  <p>"Madam, you can see," he said. "I want your daughter for my wife. I have
  come from Hesse-Homburg to fetch her."</p>

  <p>Again her shrewd eyes measured him.</p>

  <p>"You are daring," she remarked. "Carola is promised to your brother."</p>

  <p>"But I love her," he answered her sternly; "and before God, he shall not
  have her."</p>

  <p>The Margravine turned to her daughter. "And you?"</p>

  <p>The Princess shivered. "Go back," she said to the Prince. "It is&mdash;it
  is impossible."</p>

  <p>"My daughter shows some wisdom." The Margravine spoke with a cold smile.
  "Go back to Hesse-Homburg, your Highness."</p>

  <p>He turned on her passionately.</p>

  <p>"No, she shall come with me."</p>

  <p>Sudden wrath flashed in the Margravine's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Where? Who are you, a younger son, to woo your brother's betrothed? What
  can <i>you</i> give your wife?"</p>

  <p>The colour rushed to his check as though she had struck it. This had not
  occurred to him; no practical matters had disturbed the dream that had
  brought him here.</p>

  <p>"My daughter is your brother's betrothed," said the Margravine steadily.
  "Had she been free, I should have called you mad to forget her dignity and
  yours as you are doing now, to come here like this." She pointed a scornful
  finger at his dress. "To assail a princess with the language of a lovesick
  page. Take such homage, sir, to a lady who is free and of a lower birth."</p>

  <p>He stared at her, unable to find words. At the agony in his eyes her
  colour rose a little.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she said more kindly. "This is a boy's fairy-tale romance.
  Love"&mdash;and she lifted her shoulders&mdash;"where will love take you, my
  friend? It would make outcasts of both of you, marry you under a hedge, house
  you in a ditch, bring you to what? I think your Highness has not thought
  seriously of what you would offer my daughter."</p>

  <p>The Prince spoke very faintly.</p>

  <p>"In truth, madam, I have been mad."</p>

  <p>Things in a moment had changed. The Margravine had swept away like cobwebs
  his romantic visions. He felt sick and ashamed before her scorn.</p>

  <p>"I have been mad," he repeated.</p>

  <p>She watched him keenly, not sure whether he were still dangerous or
  no&mdash;smiled dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Go back to Hesse-Homburg," she said, "before there is any question. We
  wish for no scandal, my friend."</p>

  <p>He flushed at that, and fixed his mournful eyes on the Princess. "Neither
  your daughter nor anyone knew of my coming, madam."</p>

  <p>The Margravine laughed good-humouredly now. She was pleased with her
  success.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I understand."</p>

  <p>"You have cured me, madam," he answered her quickly. "I have to ask your
  pardon for my folly."</p>

  <p>He looked at the princess. Save for that one broken appeal to him to go
  she had neither moved nor spoken since her mother came. She leant against the
  beech, her terrified eyes always on him, her hands clenched at her side.</p>

  <p>"God make you more fortunate than I have been," he said unsteadily.</p>

  <p>She came a step forward. The Margravine was between them instantly, and
  spoke to him with her hand on her daughter's wrist.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness, I have been lenient to a most extraordinary degree," she
  said rapidly. "I shall forget it, I shall speak of it to none."</p>

  <p>He read the threat, the command in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am going," he answered. "You have taught me to remember the wretched
  beings we are, madam, and our paltry laws." He lifted his tragic young face
  and looked at the setting sun. He thought of the metaphor of the song. "The
  day is over," he said bitterly. "Madam, good-night."</p>

  <p>The Margravine felt her daughter's hand quiver, and her clasp on it
  tightened.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," she answered. "We must all some time be a little
  foolish."</p>

  <p>The Prince leaped the wall, and went up to his horse. The two women
  watched from under the trees, and saw him untie the bunch of roses at the
  saddle. He turned his head and looked at the Princess with a wild smile; then
  cast the flowers on the ground, mounted, and rode over them away into the
  soft twilight.</p>

  <p>The Princess made a little sound in her throat. Her mother turned to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I did not know that you had this fiery lover."</p>

  <p>"Let go of my hand, madam," she answered wildly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! are you mad also? Are you not thankful that I came to save you from
  this boy's folly?"</p>

  <p>The Princess wrenched her hand free.</p>

  <p>"God forgive you," she murmured, and wrung her fingers together. "You have
  sent him away. What have you done? He is gone!"</p>

  <p>"And you lament it," cried the Margravine, her eyes flashing. "I shall
  think this was not chance."</p>

  <p>The girl turned on her mother, suddenly animated and flushed.</p>

  <p>"It was," she cried, "my chance. Do you know what he offered me? And I was
  a coward."</p>

  <p>She tore the Prince Elector's picture from the chain round her throat, and
  hurled it into the long grass.</p>

  <p>"Oh! mother, what have you done?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" The Margravine caught her by the arm. "Do you want me to be
  silent? If you behave like a fool I must speak to the Prince Elector; he will
  not be tender with either of you."</p>

  <p>The Princess shuddered, and put her hand to her eyes. "I will be
  quiet."</p>

  <p>The Margravine picked up the miniature from the grass.</p>

  <p>"You have broken the chain," she said. "Come in, it is nearly dark."</p>

  <p>The Princess allowed herself to be led away. She said no more, gave no
  sigh nor backward look.</p>

  <p>That evening she wrote a letter, and sent it away secretly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3"
     id="ch-3"></a>III. &mdash; PRINCESS SOPHIA CAROLA BREAKS A PRECEDENT</h2>

  <p class="first">A cascade was being constructed in the gardens of the castle
  at Hesse-Homburg. His Serene Highness had seen such an ornament on has
  travels, and under his personal direction the workmen piled the smooth slabs
  of rock one upon the other, sloped away the bank, and dug the ground for the
  basin into which the water was to fall.</p>

  <p>It was at the end of a box-edged walk, and would be, when complete, a fair
  imitation of the original in France. The water conducted from a neighbouring
  stream was to fall over the rocks a height of eighty feet and plash into a
  vast fern-grown basin; a winding path was to lead gradually up the bank
  against which the rocks were set, so that the summit of the cascade could be
  reached. There was to be a little temple there, furnished with a seat and
  shaded with trees, so that it would be possible to sit and look down on the
  water's straight descent and the swirl in the pool below.</p>

  <p>The work was expensive and difficult. The Prince Elector marked with
  pleasure how well it slowly progressed. He came every day and stood for a
  while watching the men at their labour; often, he said nothing, but stood
  with his cane under his arm, fondling the ribbons on it, as his habit was;
  but the men worked the better for his keen eyes upon them.</p>

  <p>To-day he spoke: "You will have it finished for my wedding?"</p>

  <p>The head mason answered him: "Yes." The Prince Elector passed on down the
  trim walks, his long fingers playing with the red tassles on his cane, and
  arrogant satisfaction showed in his contained face; he was pleased with
  himself and with his world.</p>

  <p>Before he had reached the orangery he met Von Halzburg, his chancellor,
  and the two paced up and down together, discussing the affairs of
  Hesse-Homburg. On their parting, the Prince Elector returned slowly in the
  direction of the castle, and perceived Mr. Denton coming obviously in search
  of him.</p>

  <p>It was drawing near to evening, and cool and pleasant in the gardens. The
  Prince Elector seated himself leisurely on a bench near the fountains, and
  waited for Mr. Denton to come up to him. It had been raining that day, and
  the trees and flowers were fragrantly wet and fresh. His Serene Highness
  marked with approval the pleasant flutter of the leaves against the paling
  sky. Mr. Denton approached with his noiseless step. The Prince Elector,
  turning from contemplation of the sunset through the foliage, rested his
  clear gaze on the valet.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen his Highness my brother?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He has just returned, sir."</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector's delicate brows frowned.</p>

  <p>"He did not say where he had been?"</p>

  <p>In a subtle way his manner implied his sense of something extraordinary in
  this behaviour of his brother; in a subtle way Mr. Denton made light of it in
  his reply.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; he did not think it of enough importance."</p>

  <p>The master gave him a quick glance, but the Englishman's quiet, alert face
  told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"I have a letter for you, sir," said Mr. Denton.</p>

  <p>"One of the servants of the castle of Strelitz-Homburg desired me to give
  it to you immediately."</p>

  <p>He handed the Prince Elector a scaled packet, and awaited his orders.</p>

  <p>"From whom is this?" asked the Prince&mdash;he did not know the
  writing.</p>

  <p>"The man did not say, sir; only that it is secret and immediate."</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness frowned; he disliked informality or any hint of the
  mysterious.</p>

  <p>"There is an answer wanted?" He lingered over the breaking of the
  seals.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, sir; the messenger has returned."</p>

  <p>"Very well." The Prince made a motion of dismissal; Mr. Denton bowed and
  left.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness handled the letter a moment, opened it slowly, and
  glanced at the signature. It was from the Princess Sophia Carola. There were
  only a few lines, all in her own hand. As the Prince read them a curious
  hardness came over his face, his lips tightened, and his eyes shone
  unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>But he folded the letter quietly, put it in his pocket, and began to walk
  up and down in front of the fountains.</p>

  <p>The placid evening faded into twilight, the bats came out and circled
  round the bushes, in the windows of the castle small yellow lights appeared;
  still the Prince Elector walked to and fro, his eyes downcast, his mouth set
  sternly. Suddenly, as he turned, a man stepped out from the shadow of the
  laurels, and he found himself face to face with his brother.</p>

  <p>For a second a spasm of hatred crossed his face and his eyes flashed aide,
  then they narrowed again, and he spoke quietly.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you have returned?"</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George, correctly dressed, pomaded and powdered, raised
  his hat, and was turning off without a word when his brother stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>The younger man flushed slowly and swung round on his heel so that he
  faced the other.</p>

  <p>"Where does your Highness please to think I have been?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>There was a direct challenge in his words, a recklessness in his bearing
  of how that challenge might he answered. The Prince Elector clenched his
  hands on the red-tasseled cane.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I know," he said; "perhaps, also, I want to hear the tale you
  will tell me."</p>

  <p>"I owe you no explanation," answered Prince Frederic George. "I am free to
  ride where I will&mdash;that much at least is owing, even to a younger
  son."</p>

  <p>"While you are at my court you obey me."</p>

  <p>"Had I your commands to stay in Hesse-Homburg?" flashed the other.</p>

  <p>They stood very close together against the dark, rustling laurels.</p>

  <p>"For two nights," said the Prince Elector, "you have not slept at home.
  You must have ridden out as you were&mdash;in your ball dress, without
  servants. You made yourself a matter of comment to my people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His brother interrupted hotly.</p>

  <p>"What are your people to me? I did as I wished, and am responsible to no
  man."</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness was very white. He moistened his lips, and pressed his
  handkerchief to them.</p>

  <p>"Take care what you say," he answered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Something in his tone stung Prince Frederic George into open wrath; his
  sore heart and galled spirit could endure no more.</p>

  <p>"I'll not choose my words to you!" he cried, and his dark eyes gleamed
  dangerously.</p>

  <p>"You young fool!" His Serene highness lifted a face showing livid in the
  twilight. "You'll answer me civilly, and you <i>will</i> choose your
  words&mdash;yea, and your actions, too."</p>

  <p>"Neither one nor the other," panted the other, rigid with anger. "What
  have you ever done for me that I should consider you?"</p>

  <p>"Where did you ride from, yesterday?" asked the Prince Elector. "Answer me
  that!"</p>

  <p>His brother laughed recklessly.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven, I will not!"</p>

  <p>"It was to Strelitz-Homburg."</p>

  <p>"Well, if it were?"</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness stepped back from him.</p>

  <p>"Do you deny it?" he asked through drawn lips.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" The blood flamed in Prince Frederic's face, but he held
  his head proudly high. "Yes; whatever spy you have had at work told you
  right. I rode from Strelitz-Homburg."</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector flung out his hand, caught some of the laurel leaves,
  and crushed them in his cold fingers. It symbolised his arrogance.</p>

  <p>"And whom did you go to see?" he asked in a quivering voice.</p>

  <p>His brother flung defiance at him.</p>

  <p>"Since you know&mdash;do you think I am to be trapped into lying?"</p>

  <p>"I think that you will not be bold enough to tell me the truth," breathed
  the Prince Elector.</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic laughed.</p>

  <p>"The truth! What have we to do with the truth? We live shams and act lies.
  Let the truth go, your Highness."</p>

  <p>The elder man held in his passion with a painful effort.</p>

  <p>"You dare me very far. Will you dare to tell me that you went to see my
  betrothed wife?"</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George drew back against the laurels; his eyes
  narrowed.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;who told you? Yes; if you wish to make words about her name.
  That is the truth for you. I went to see her."</p>

  <p>"This to my face!"</p>

  <p>"This to your face. Who told you?"</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector put a shaking hand over the pocket where the letter
  lay.</p>

  <p>"The Margravine wrote to me." He watched the effect of his lie.</p>

  <p>Pale with scorn of all of them, Prince Frederic George flung up his
  head.</p>

  <p>"She spoke me false, then. Well, it is over now. What are you goading me
  for?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to discover the truth," breathed the Prince Elector.</p>

  <p>"The truth!" Again his brother flung the word at him contemptuously. "Am I
  to bare my soul to feed your scorn? You can guess the truth."</p>

  <p>"You love her," said the Prince Elector in a still voice. "Well, I do not,
  but she is to be my wife. Do I put it plainly?"</p>

  <p>"You put it like the cold devil you are!" cried the other. "What right
  have you to use these words? What right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector interrupted, with a flash of vehemence:</p>

  <p>"How far has this gone between you and her? Enough of your heroics. Answer
  me that&mdash;do you think "&mdash;he drew a sharp breath&mdash;"that she
  favours you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! be satisfied," answered Prince Frederic George wildly. "She had been
  mounted on my horse, and we both of us miles across the borders, if
  she&mdash;But I will not talk of her to you. I say it is over. Will you still
  goad me?"</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness withdrew his hand from the letter in his pocket. He
  had discovered what he wished to know. His forehead was damp, his lips dry
  and trembling, but his eyes flashed triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Why, I can smile at your madness," he said steadily. "If by your own
  confession, she carts nothing, you tease wasted your knight-errantry and your
  love-making."</p>

  <p>His brother caught him by the shoulder with sudden force.</p>

  <p>"Be silent." he commanded hastily. "Don't you see? don't you understand?
  You drive me to violence."</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector felt himself overpowered: his brother was by far the
  stronger man. Still, he did not move nor abate his mocking tone.</p>

  <p>"I always knew you were a fool; but you will keep your folly from my
  affairs. Take your hands off me."</p>

  <p>Prince Frederic George saw the furious eyes of the man he held gleaming at
  him, and he let go his hold suddenly, afraid of himself.</p>

  <p>"And I," he said hoarsely. "I always hated you and your pasteboard
  royalty! By God! had you not been the elder, you had not flouted me now, I
  could have won her&mdash;ay, and kept her. I am as fine a gentleman as you,
  had you taken your chances fairly. Oh I I loathe your shams and pretences,
  your empty titles and tea-cup kingdoms. Let me go before I prove on your body
  who is the better man."</p>

  <p>Every word of the poor mute letter lying in his packet rose red before the
  Prince Elector's eyes. He put his hand instinctively over it again, as if
  afraid that it might proclaim aloud the lie he was acting.</p>

  <p>"You will leave Hesse-Homburg," he said passionately. "You will go to
  France&mdash;to Rome&mdash;to hell, so that I will not see your face
  again."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of me?" answered his brother proudly. There was a sound of
  the rustling laurels as he crushed back against them.</p>

  <p>"I have had enough of you for what you have done to-day. I will never
  forgive you This is an end of it between us!"</p>

  <p>Through the deepening dark that divided them Prince Frederic George
  answered:</p>

  <p>"Do you think I would stay to see her cross your threshold? Do not fear
  that I shall mar your festival. You have made this spot cursed to me. God
  give you joy of your choice, my brother!"</p>

  <p>With a firm step he turned away. The Prince Elector saw his tall,
  indistinct figure pass before the dark laurel edge and disappear behind the
  fountains. Alone in the dark and the silence, his Serene Highness could not
  restrain a sound of rage and bitterness. With shaking fingers he pulled out
  the Princess's letter, and his eyes grew evil as he stared at it&mdash;a
  white blur in the twilight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-4"
     id="ch-4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE BALL IN THE HALL OP MIRRORS</h2>

  <p class="first">The Prince Elector was at Strelitz-Homburg to fetch his
  wife. The Margrave gave a ball to celebrate his daughter's betrothal, and in
  the Hall of Mirrors his Serene Highness met the Princess alone for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>He had been talking with the Margravine; it was before the ball had begun,
  and the room was empty when he entered it. As he crossed the polished floor
  his own white satin-clad figure was reflected to right and left of him in the
  mirrors. Only a few candles as yet were lit&mdash;the light was soft and
  pleasant, the place very still. The Prince Elector gave a little start as he
  saw her enter, and close the door behind her. Yet he had known that this
  moment must come, he had been sure that she must seek him out and speak. He
  had her letter in his pocket, and his answer ready.</p>

  <p>The Princess came slowly down the room and crossed to a gilt settee placed
  in a corner. He, looking at her, could for the moment think of nothing but
  her beauty. She wore a dress of a deep rose-pink, cut very low, and heavy
  with gold embroidery; her fair, smooth shoulders were reflected in the mirror
  behind her; in her piled-up, powdered hair was a great white rose. She held a
  fan of white feathers that she waved slowly to and fro, and her gorgeous blue
  eyes were intent on the Prince Elector.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness," she said in a low voice; "did you receive my letter?"</p>

  <p>He had been at Strelitz-Homburg four days, and had not passed more than a
  few formal words with her in the presence of others. Her question, expected
  as it was, gave him a curious shock; it angered him, too, more than he had
  thought it would.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," he answered.</p>

  <p>She dropped the feather fan into her lap.</p>

  <p>"Have you a reply to it?" she asked. "I have been waiting."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1304021h-images/AMomentsMadness-03.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>His anger grew unaccountably, for her bearing was gentle and she was
  putting so obvious an effort on herself to speak at all that it should have
  moved his pity. But her very bright fairness and beauty, repeated by the
  mirrors about him, stirred him to cruelty.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I have an answer," he said. "What do you think it is?"</p>

  <p>A delicate colour came into her face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have hopes," she said simply.</p>

  <p>His fine nostrils distended. He crossed the room to the side of her gilt
  settee.</p>

  <p>"Of what, madam?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>She leant forward, breathing fragrance.</p>

  <p>"That you will not do this great wrong to me&mdash;who have done no wrong
  to you, your Highness."</p>

  <p>He thought of his brother's handsome face, and could not trust himself to
  speak.</p>

  <p>The Princess gave him a trembling smile, with hope written on it.</p>

  <p>"Ah! You will have thought me bold and strange&mdash;but I had no hope
  save in your generosity."</p>

  <p>He was still silent.</p>

  <p>"We are almost strangers, your Highness." Her sweet voice was very low.
  "While you were away I saw so much of him. I&mdash;but he never spoke to me.
  I did not know&mdash;until he came."</p>

  <p>"Ah! until he came," said the Prince Elector softly. Her great eyes grew
  apprehensive.</p>

  <p>"I should never have dared; but he told me&mdash;I saw it all, then I
  thought you would set me free." She laid her hand pleadingly on his satin
  sleeve. "Your Highness, your Highness, what am I to be to you&mdash;and to
  him?"</p>

  <p>He stepped back, lifting his hand to the lace on his breast, and with
  cruel eyes fixed on her appealing fairness.</p>

  <p>"I have your answer." He pulled a paper from his bosom.</p>

  <p>She rose expectant, trembling between hope and fear, and clasped the back
  of the settee. Against the wall, behind the Prince Elector, was a sconce of
  candles. He turned to them, and she saw her writing on the paper in his hand.
  With a little quiver of dread she realised that it was her letter he held. As
  she watched, he twisted it up, thrust it into one of the candles, cast it
  flaming on the ground, and set his heel on it.</p>

  <p>"That is your answer," he said, looking at her over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>She went piteously pale, but her eyes were dark and brilliant.</p>

  <p>"Which means?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Which means that what you wrote there and what you have said since is
  alike folly we had best forget, madam."</p>

  <p>The Princess moved from the couch and took a few swift paces down the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You have not understood me," she said in a bewildered way.</p>

  <p>"Do not put it any more clearly," he answered bitterly, "for, believe me,
  I understand."</p>

  <p>"But it is not possible!" she cried. "You cannot be so cruel!"</p>

  <p>His unflinching blue eyes chilled her speech. She came back to the couch
  and leant against it weakly.</p>

  <p>"But I might have known," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness, swinging the diamond star that hung on his breast by
  a black ribbon, crossed over to her.</p>

  <p>"I have been very patient," he said. "I can endure no more words on this
  subject."</p>

  <p>She was still incredulous of his attitude.</p>

  <p>"But do you&mdash;can you&mdash;realise what this means to me?" she asked,
  with her hand on her bosom.</p>

  <p>He smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"I am not so obtuse, madam&mdash;and what of myself? Your talk insults
  me."</p>

  <p>She moved away from him against the cold, shining mirrors.</p>

  <p>"Insults you?" She pulled desperately at the feathers III her fan. "I
  never promised you anything&mdash;you know that. It was done for me. I only
  ask you to be merciful."</p>

  <p>"And I, madam"&mdash;the Prince Elector raised his head and looked her
  straight in the eyes&mdash;"I desire you to be silent on this matter."</p>

  <p>The Princess drew a sobbing breath.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to go on my knees to you? I&mdash;I&mdash;find it
  difficult to speak."</p>

  <p>"I want you only to leave the subject, madam, lest you strain my tolerance
  too far."</p>

  <p>"Your tolerance!" The word stung her through her pain. "What manner of man
  are you to speak so to me?"</p>

  <p>"The man who is to be your master, at least, madam." His anger was fast
  overmastering him; his delicate face was drawn and hard.</p>

  <p>"Ah! You have little tenderness for me!" she cried in pain and wonder.</p>

  <p>"It is enough that I have chosen you for my wife. It is enough that I will
  forgive your moment's madness!"</p>

  <p>"Forgive!" she echoed. "I think, your Highness, that I will not forgive
  you!"</p>

  <p>She sank on the couch, for she trembled so that she could not stand, and
  caught at the arm with nervous fingers, while her accusing eyes faced him. He
  shrunk under their accusation.</p>

  <p>"I would not treat the meanest thing in my power as you are treating me,"
  she said wildly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he turned on her, his fine, cold manner cast aside.</p>

  <p>"I'll endure none of your schoolgirl airs and graces, madam. You do not
  know what you say. You have had my answer, and I will listen to no more."</p>

  <p>Her anger rose to meet his.</p>

  <p>"I know well enough what I say&mdash;and, to your shame, you know it too,
  Prince."</p>

  <p>"Cease!" he cried hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid. I always disliked you. I knew in my soul&mdash;I knew
  that I should appeal in vain."</p>

  <p>She rose, shaking.</p>

  <p>"Take care what you say to me," he said.</p>

  <p>"I say this to you," she panted; "I love your brother&mdash;in these words
  I say it plainly to your face!"</p>

  <p>"And I answer you, madam, that you will be my wife, notwithstanding. As
  for him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What of him?" she broke in.</p>

  <p>"He will not trouble us. I have sent him from Hesse-Homburg."</p>

  <p>He saw the terror in her eyes, and he smiled unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Gone? He&mdash;is gone?"</p>

  <p>"Did you imagine that I was <i>quite</i> so accommodating?" he sneered.
  "He is gone, madam; and, while I live, he will not return!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" she cried.</p>

  <p>She seemed utterly broken. She fell across the couch and sank into the
  cushions. Her breath, her very life, seemed to be struck out of her trembling
  body.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said his Serene Highness. "We have had enough of these fooleries."
  He bent over the settee. "Are you going to behave like a kitchen wench
  deprived of her swain?"</p>

  <p>She sat up, armed with pride, and put her hands to her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I shall learn my part in time, your Highness."</p>

  <p>He drew back, pressed his handkerchief to his lips, and watched her as she
  struggled for self-control. It was pleasant to him to think of his brother
  riding away with an empty heart and an empty future, while she sat there
  vanquished, his&mdash;hating him, perhaps&mdash;but his.</p>

  <p>After a little she turned to him and spoke in a steady voice: "I must ask
  your Highness to forgive me that I so far mistook you as to speak as I have
  done. I see very clearly my own folly."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you do see reason now, madam."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said. "I see reason now, your Highness."</p>

  <p>"There is someone coming," said the Prince Elector. "They are bringing the
  music. You have nothing more to say to me, madam?"</p>

  <p>Her intense eyes flashed over him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, your Highness."</p>

  <p>He moved away to the window. He was more angered and shaken with this
  scene she had made than he cared to admit to himself, but it was balm to his
  wounded pride to think of Prince Frederic George wrapt in loneliness,
  picturing with a furious heart his brother's wedding festival, and not
  knowing where the bride's heart lay. Ah! <i>there</i> was the triumph his
  brother did not know.</p>

  <p>The musicians came in one by one, carrying the harps, flutes, and violins.
  The room was lit, making it one glitter from end to end, every fiance
  reflected a dozen times.</p>

  <p>The Margravine entered and spoke to her daughter. The guests arrived; the
  Princess received them gracefully. Her mother, sharp-eyed, could detect no
  confusion or distraction in her bearing.</p>

  <p>She opened the ball with the Prince Elector. She had no word to give him
  as they walked through the minuet, and he felt her fingers cold as they
  touched his. But her frozen courtliness was all that was expected from her,
  and he was satisfied to have the thought of his brother, who did not
  know.</p>

  <p>She danced half through the evening, then found an excuse to evade the
  gentleman who would have led her out, and escaped on to the balcony. She had
  no object in coaling here, save that her desperate heart might draw some
  comfort from the quiet; but she had a sudden inspiration as she saw Mr.
  Denton mounting the steps from the garden. She had noticed the man, and liked
  his quiet presence: it scented to her that he could be faithful. As he came
  along the balcony she leant forward and, on the impulse of her inspiration,
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where his Highness is&mdash;Prince Frederic George?" she
  said, and hardly knew that the words were formed before they had been uttered
  beyond recall.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton stopped instantly. The light falling through the open window of
  the ballroom revealed her pale and beautiful in her glimmering dress, her
  lovely eyes half-defiant, half-pleading.</p>

  <p>"Do you know?" she repeated, and her tone was between fear and
  haughtiness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam." He was immovable, respectful&mdash;the perfectly trained
  servant.</p>

  <p>"He has left Hesse-Homburg?" asked the Princess, too proud to disguise her
  interest, speaking intensely, and with no affectation of indifference.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton replied as before:</p>

  <p>"He left the castle at the same time as his Serene Highness, madam. He is
  staying now at Hartheim, while he makes ready to go abroad."</p>

  <p>So&mdash;he lingered! He was still in the country&mdash;near&mdash;with
  what hopes, perhaps!</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton bowed and passed on.</p>

  <p>At Hartheim, a village only a few miles away. She reached out her hands
  across the balcony, fired by the thought of his near presence, as he had been
  by hers when he rode out across the summer fields to find her.</p>

  <p>His very name was on her lips, but she caught it back; the Prince
  Elector's soft footfall was behind, he stepped up to her side.</p>

  <p>There was a curious silence between them. She would not speak to him, She
  put her fan to her lips, and stared across the dark garden. He pulled a leaf
  from the creeper on the stone and tore it delicately.</p>

  <p>"Do you hate me?" he asked at last, smiling and bending a little closer.
  She half-turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Was it not your wish," she said, "that we should speak of neither hate
  nor&mdash;love?"</p>

  <p>The fragments of the torn leaf fluttered from his hand.</p>

  <p>"For me," continued the Princess, "I shall be silent on these matters, for
  after all, your Highness," and her voice grew reckless, "what has it to do
  with us?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you decide so," he answered. "Let us go in, madam."</p>

  <p>She made a little motion with her hand unseen by him, as if she cast a
  message into the dark or waved a signal at Hartheim, a few miles away.</p>

  <p>As she stepped into the candlelight she laughed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-5"
     id="ch-5"></a>V. &mdash; A WILD ADVENTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">Her ladies had put the Princess to bed and left her.</p>

  <p>She lay very still, staring at the great round moon that hung in the
  square of the window. Then, when every sound in the palace was hushed, she
  rose very cautiously and lit a candle. By the pale light of it she saw her
  own face in the mirror and wondered, so strangely her fair eager features
  showed against the darkness of the background.</p>

  <p>Quickly and noiselessly she dressed herself in the darkest clothes she
  could find, took the candle, and left the room.</p>

  <p>She dared not think either of the joy or of the madness of what she did.
  Her whole being was strung to silence. She descended the stairs,
  light-footed, one cold hand on the wide, smooth rail; the other, holding
  steadily aloft the candle that cast a waving circle about her feet. As she
  passed the windows a great bar of moonlight lay across her path, and she took
  her breath fearfully, glad to escape into the darkness, with only her own
  little candle.</p>

  <p>She reached the bottom of the stairs. Her straining eyes had seen nothing,
  her anxious cars caught no sound. She paused a moment to take her bearing;
  the place seemed so different in the dark, the very stillness confused her.
  The hall before her was glowing with moonlight falling through the tall
  window that bore the arms of her family, and the shadow of the dark shield
  was cast at her feet.</p>

  <p>Her intention was to go through the ballroom and escape by one of the
  windows on to the balcony, so across the garden and park and out on the high
  road there where the wall was low.</p>

  <p>She was about to move when the palace clock struck two, and she waited
  fearfully for the echoes to die away. But, before the last tremor of sound
  had vanished, a door near by unclosed and a man stepped out.</p>

  <p>The Princess had the courage to repress the cry of dismay that rose to her
  lips, the courage to put out her candle and draw back into the shadow of the
  stairs. The man spoke:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, madam?"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Mr. Denton. She realised, with a fainting spirit, that
  it must be the Prince Elector's room from which he came.</p>

  <p>"His Highness is asleep, madam," said Mr. Denton, in his usual respectful
  ordinary tones.</p>

  <p>At that she came forward a little. The moonlight showed her green laced
  hunting dress, her long curls tied in a knot at her neck, her snow-white face
  lit with her great wild eyes. Now that she was discovered she was quite
  calm.</p>

  <p>"Have you been watching for me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam."</p>

  <p>"This is your master's doing." She made a desperate step in the direction
  of the ball-room door; quiet, respectful as always, Mr. Denton was in front
  of her.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is going to Hartheim?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Princess stood silent; her bosom rose and fell tempestuously, she
  looked at the ground, then she looked up.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am going to Hartheim."</p>

  <p>It was in this man's power to prevent her, to rouse his master, but she
  would not stoop to lie or plead.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me pass?" she panted, with a fair show of courage.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton bowed and opened the door for her.</p>

  <p>"Have you a horse, madam?"</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;she glanced at his impassive presence in a bewildered
  way&mdash;"I?&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness cannot walk four miles alone in the middle of the night,"
  said Mr. Denton, speaking with great deference.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I had not thought of it," she answered, the full difficulty and
  recklessness of her undertaking coming home to her. "There was no one I could
  trust," she added half to herself, "but I ant not afraid."</p>

  <p>"I could get you a horse, madam," suggested Mr. Denton.</p>

  <p>"You!" she exclaimed, "the Prince's servant!"</p>

  <p>"I would always rather have served his brother, madam."</p>

  <p>She stood silent for a moment, considering Mr. Denton, then she spoke:</p>

  <p>"Very well, serve me now. It is the same thing, as you know, I think," she
  smiled proudly; "follow me to Hartheim."</p>

  <p>As far as his manner ever showed anything, Mr. Denton showed pleasure that
  she had so quickly understood and trusted him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You risk a great deal," she said curiously; "remember that."</p>

  <p>"It is no matter at all, your Highness."</p>

  <p>He followed her into the great deserted ball-room and deftly unfastened a
  window. The Princess stepped out into the moonlight and descended the steps
  into the garden; Mr. Denton fixed the window with noiseless precision and
  came down after her.</p>

  <p>"Where can you get horses?" asked the Princess, standing among the rose
  bushes; "the stables are locked."</p>

  <p>"If your Highness could walk across the park, there is a farmhouse on the
  high road where I could procure them."</p>

  <p>"How?" she questioned.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton explained himself deferentially.</p>

  <p>"I could say I had His Highness's orders to ride with important papers,
  and that he did not wish to rouse the palace for my horse. They know me,
  madam."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, "where is this horse?"</p>

  <p>"A few yards from the gates, madam."</p>

  <p>"But they will be fastened," answered the Princess; "we must get over the
  wall where it is low and walk to the farm along the road."</p>

  <p>She started across the moonlit garden at a quick pace, Mr. Denton a few
  steps behind. She had no sense now that she was doing a wild extraordinary
  thing, she hardly realised the strangeness of this foreign servant's
  devotion; her thoughts were all ahead of her body on the long, white road to
  Hartheim. They left the garden and entered the park. The great trees stood up
  huge and majestic against the silver sky; a group of delicate deer were
  browsing in the moonlight, and the hares fled through the long grass at their
  approach. It seemed to the Princess that they took hours to traverse the
  well-known glades, but as they reached the low wall she heard faintly the
  palace clock striking half-past two.</p>

  <p>Out on the winding ribbon of the high road now, with the full moon hanging
  ahead of them, the Princess gathered up her skirts out of the thick white
  dust, and led the way along the park well in the direction of the great
  gates. On the other side of them was a low hedge full of sweetbrier and
  honeysuckle, making the air heavy with sweetness, and beyond that were young
  cornfields, a wondrous colour under the moon.</p>

  <p>As they came near the gates the Princess saw facing than a farmhouse
  standing a little back from the road, in an orchard of pear trees.</p>

  <p>"Is that it?" she whispered over her shoulder to Mr. Denton.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam."</p>

  <p>"I remember," she answered. "They would know me; will you go up alone and
  try to get the horses?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton bowed.</p>

  <p>"I will wait here," said the Princess, and seated herself on the bank
  beneath the hedge.</p>

  <p>She felt neither fear nor dread, but a great dreamy joy. It was beautiful
  to feel the soft grass and the tall wild flowers when she put out her hands,
  to smell the clover, the thyme, the roses, to see the dim fruit trees bending
  over the twisted fence, and the moon, cold, far away and pure, hanging above
  them. It was glorious to think of riding through the wonderful night, framing
  as she went the words that were to blot out her tongue-tied silence.</p>

  <p>She heard the sound of the gate in the fence opening and Mr. Denton's
  steps up the path, then his loud knock on the door. There was a pause; he
  struck again and the Princess held her breath. It seemed as if the Prince
  Elector, in his sleep, must have heard this knock. She found herself glancing
  at the distant towers of the castle.</p>

  <p>Then came voices, and her courage rose again. After a little she saw the
  yellow light of a lantern carried across the orchard and dark figures moving
  under the trees. Little clear yet distant sounds came through the night, the
  sound of bolts drawn, voices, chains rattling, and at last the clatter of
  moving horses. At that her blood leapt; she stood up, suddenly finding
  waiting unbearable, but she kept herself cautiously back in the shadow, lest
  anyone coming should see her.</p>

  <p>The lantern again passed under the trees, and this time only a single
  figure with it. Presently Mr. Denton, leading two horses, came round by the
  road. They were both saddled for men; Mr. Denton explained that he had let
  the farmer suppose that the companion waiting for him was of his own sex.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter," said the Princess, smiling.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton helped her to mount the rough country horse and she caught up
  the reins, seating herself as best she could on the ungainly saddle; she was
  a fine rider, as she should be, and with a sure seat. Mr. Denton mounted.</p>

  <p>"You know the way?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"I think so, madam."</p>

  <p>The Princess laughed.</p>

  <p>"I know I do, very well."</p>

  <p>She touched up the horse and they took the long, straight road to
  Hartheim. In a little while they came to a village and clattered through it.
  The Princess saw the little white houses, the orchards, the church spire swim
  past, and they were out on the open road again. Mr. Denton rode a pace behind
  silently. A sudden thought occurred to the Princess.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where His Highness stays?" she asked under her breath. Until
  this moment she had not reflected on it that she did not know.</p>

  <p>"There is only one inn, your Highness&mdash;the sign of the Peacock."</p>

  <p>He fell behind again, and they rode on through the moonlight. It was not
  long before they gained the summit of a hill, and looked down on a little
  cluster of houses round two cross roads.</p>

  <p>"Hartheim," said the Princess faintly.</p>

  <p>They slowly descended the hill.</p>

  <p>There was no one abroad in the village street, not a sound, save their own
  horses' shoes on the smooth road.</p>

  <p>"This is it, madam," said Mr. Denton. He drew up before the house, where
  the sign swung over the door.</p>

  <p>"What are we to do now?" murmured the Princess through white lips. Her
  strength had gone from her suddenly. She sat stiffly on the huge saddle, her
  hair shaken down by the rough riding, her eyes gleamed in the moonlight,
  steadfast yet afraid.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton dismounted and knocked. She held herself rigidly, the breath
  coming sharply through her cleft lips.</p>

  <p>The door was soon opened. Being on the high road between Hesse-Homburg and
  Strelitz-Homburg, mine host was used to travellers.</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton spoke in a low voice to the man who opened to him. She could
  not tell what tale he was offering; she waited, and when the servant came to
  take her horse's head, she slipped from the saddle. Mr. Denton held the door
  open for her; she passed into the passage, and sank on the bench beside the
  tall clock. A candle guttering in the wind from the open door stood on a
  shelf; she saw the stairs ascending into darkness.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Where is he?" she said. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Her body was numb, but her heart on fire.</p>

  <p>"I will ascertain, madam," answered Mr. Denton. He was rather pale.</p>

  <p>Mine host descended the stairs; the Princess leant against the wall; the
  tall clock struck 'three with a silvery chime.</p>

  <p>"His Highness Prince Frederic of Hesse-Homburg is here." said Mr. Denton;
  "he arrived about four days ago."</p>

  <p>"Yes "&mdash;the landlord raised his candle high and stared behind it at
  the lady's face&mdash;"he came here."</p>

  <p>The Princess spoke:</p>

  <p>"Will you rouse him? On a most pressing matter, at once."</p>

  <p>The man set the candle on the self.</p>

  <p>"He left here this morning early," he answered. "He is gone."</p>

  <p>"Gone!" Her head whirled. "He is gone!"</p>

  <p>She sprang up from the bench and ran out into the road, the two men
  following her.</p>

  <p>"He is gone!" she repeated. "Where?"</p>

  <p>The landlord nodded towards the servant.</p>

  <p>"He went to the cross roads," said the old man. "I do not know which one
  he took."</p>

  <p>"Oh, too late, too late!" whispered the Princess. She fell back against
  the lintel of the door; she turned her face to the sky.</p>

  <p>"We must go back," said Mr. Denton. "Quick, madam, or we shall have lost
  all for nothing."</p>

  <p>"I will ride after him," she returned desperately.</p>

  <p>"God help us! We do not even know which way he went."</p>

  <p>It was hopeless. She looked down the pitiless dim white rood with
  despairing, tearless eyes; she let Mr. Denton, whose movements were quick and
  eager now, help her to mount, and made no complaint. Back along the road they
  had come, with the moon waning behind them now, and the dawn slowly filling
  the sky.</p>

  <p>"We did our best, madam," said Mr. Denton.</p>

  <p>She made no answer with her lips, but her hand motioned him to silence.
  She was going back with every footfall of her horse nearer the Prince
  Elector, nearer the castle and her old life, further from him and her hopes.
  Why had she not gone wildly in search of him? Again, like a coward she had
  turned back. What had he said: "This is our day, our chance," and she had not
  taken it that day; and now she could not. Their chance was over; perhaps she
  would never see him again.</p>

  <p>She lifted her haggard eyes to the brightening sky, and the slow tears
  rolled down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>They reached the farmhouse, and she dismounted in silence, while Mr.
  Denton, framing what excuse he might, led the horses back.</p>

  <p>Every moment the light gathered strength; every moment the dangerous
  nature of her position increased; she might be seen, someone might discover
  that she left her room. Soon the servants would be abroad, people pass up and
  down the road. She thought of all these things in a vague way, but she was
  too sad for fear; before her was that picture of the cross roads branching
  apart under the moonlight, of the old man holding the guttering candle, under
  the sign of the Peacock; in her ears echoed his words:</p>

  <p>"He went to the cross roads; I do not know which one he took."</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton joined her, and she preceded him in silence across the park. He
  looked to right and left anxiously; this was the most unlooked-for and
  perilous part of the enterprise, but she walked rapidly with unseeing eyes.
  The birds were awake in the garden, and the colours of the flowers visible in
  the pearly light. When they gained the balcony and the gray ball-room, the
  sun was beginning to rise in pale gold.</p>

  <p>The Princess turned to Mr. Denton:</p>

  <p>"It was not meant to be," she said. "Yet, thank you!"</p>

  <p>She never asked him to keep her secret nor hinted that she dreaded his
  knowledge of what she had tried to do; and that was his reward.</p>

  <p>She turned across the shining floor. Her skirts, wet with dew and stained
  with dust, made a little sound of rustling in the stillness. Mr. Denton held
  the door for her; she passed out into the corridor and up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Walking with a mechanical caution, she gained her room, locked the door,
  put away her tell-tale clothes, and all cold and numb, went on her knees
  beside the bed. The long rays of the early sun struck through the window, and
  played in her dishevelled gold hair.</p>

  <p>"How I have dreamed to-night!" she whispered her throat, "how I have
  dreamed!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-6"
     id="ch-6"></a>VI. &mdash; A BLUE MOTH AND A WEDDING NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">The Prince Elector brought his bride home towards the
  evening of a mid-June day. The villagers had decorated the road to the castle
  with arches of flowers. A fete was held in the gardens, and a great banquet
  given to the country people under the trees.</p>

  <p>The Princess, very sweet to look upon in her fine white riding dress, rode
  a chestnut horse at her husband's side; her manner was quiet and gentle. As
  the cavalcade reached the park gates the village children came across the
  grass and offered her a great bouquet of wild flowers. She thanked them in a
  voice that faltered a little, and the procession continued its slow progress
  under the great trees. The air was full of the golden-dusty evening sunshine.
  High up the leaves showed spaces of pale bright sky; it seemed to the
  Princess very far away when she looked up at it. On the steps of the palace
  the officials of the kingdom were drawn up to receive her. As the bride
  dismounted and set her fool on the ground, the bells sounded, and a hundred
  swords flashed into the air in salute from the guards gathered about the
  steps.</p>

  <p>Standing on the shallow, sunny steps, the Princess listened to the
  chancellor's speech. She held the flowers she carried up to her face. Once
  she glanced furtively at her husband. Seeing nothing on his delicate features
  but a cold self-satisfaction, a faint colour came into her cheeks, and she
  looked away again.</p>

  <p>In a few soft words she made answer to her welcome. She gave the
  chancellor her hand to kiss, and all of them standing there and looking at
  her pure loveliness had an instant and secret feeling that she was too good
  for the Prince Elector, but she herself hardly knew any eyes were on her at
  all&mdash;she went through the duties mechanically, her thoughts running on
  one theme.</p>

  <p>"This is where he lived. He must have come up these steps
  often&mdash;often; he must have touched the doorway in passing as I touch it
  now; these people, now speaking to me, have spoken to him; this is his home
  that I have driven him from. Where is he now? Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>Before the hour of the great banquet she contrived a few words with Mr.
  Denton, the first since that night that was so strange and terrible a thing
  to remember. She would have liked to let silence cover it for ever, but she
  reflected that this man, unpaid, unbesought, was keeping her secret, and that
  she owed him some recollection of his services.</p>

  <p>She called him inside the antechamber where she awaited her husband
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Have you in any way suffered for what you did once for me?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No, madam," and Mr. Demon bowed respectfully. "I explained it with regard
  to the horses. I think the landlord at Hartheim is safe, madam."</p>

  <p>She winced at the name.</p>

  <p>"Safe?"</p>

  <p>"No one is likely to question him; I think he did not recognise your
  Highness."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of you," she answered. "I should not like you to stiffer
  any loss because of me&mdash;and will you take this, to pay, at least, for
  the horses? I have had no chance before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held out a purse in a little trembling hand as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not, your Highness," said Mr. Denton deferentially.</p>

  <p>"I can do nothing else for you," she answered rather piteously.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter at all, madam."</p>

  <p>The Princess moved away suddenly, hearing a step. Mr. Denton bowed and
  withdrew.</p>

  <p>It was the Prince Elector who entered from the inner door, gravely
  smiling. The Princess leant her arm against the mantelpiece, and stared at
  her reflection in the mirror above it. She was in white and gold, gleaming,
  fair from head to foot. She stood quite still; there was nothing to be
  guessed from her face.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness began talking. He spoke of the gardens he was laying
  out, the new wing of the palace he was building; he told her of the cascade
  he had made, and that the water should flow down it to-night for the first
  time; told her also of the general prosperity and magnificence of his
  kingdom. She answered him when he paused for it, but she gave him no more
  than a few bare words, and never moved or turned her head.</p>

  <p>He knew well enough what she was thinking of. He knew that, by banishing
  his brother from the country, he had only outwardly triumphed, and that the
  other man was there still, in her thoughts, in her heart. As he walked up and
  down, speaking quietly, casually, he meditated some means of delicate
  revenge, some way by which he could stab this resignation of hers that galled
  him by its new passiveness.</p>

  <p>Sounds of the preparation of the banquet came to them&mdash;voices and
  snatches of music. The Prince continued to walk up and down speaking, the
  Princess to stand mute and to tolerate him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a gorgeous moth fluttered in through the open window; it was a
  sparkling blue colour, and it came straight to the Princess and settled on
  her arm. She looked up now with a little exclamation; the moth rose from her
  arm and flew away. She made a movement after it, towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Come into the garden," said the Prince Elector, "and I will show you the
  cascade."</p>

  <p>The moth fled into the darkness as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I will follow your Highness," she answered. She picked up her scarf, put
  it about her shoulders, and passed beside him into the summer night.</p>

  <p>The gardens were lit with coloured lamps that east gleams of curious warm
  light on the trees and flowers. The stars were out, but there was no moon. As
  they walked down the long, bordered paths the Princess saw the blue moth now
  and then, flitting before her. Neither she nor her husband spoke. They passed
  the grove of laurels and the fountains that were not playing yet, and came to
  the foot of the cascade. It was finished; the smooth slabs of rock grown with
  ferns rose up from a basin surrounded with plants, and at the side a gradual
  path led to the temple at the summit.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector explained that when the water was turned on it would
  fall straight over the great height of rocks and form a pool of what was now
  a bare stone basin. He told her with what difficulty and expense the water
  had been brought, and added that the results corn. pared fairly with the
  cascades he had seen abroad.</p>

  <p>"Will you mount to the top?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"As you will," she answered.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness gave her a quick glance and set his lips.</p>

  <p>The trees shading the winding upward path were all hung with red lamps,
  casting a rosy glow over the two figures as they' ascended, but when they
  reached the summit there was no light save the stars.</p>

  <p>The Princess drew back instinctively from the edge of that sheer drop, and
  shuddered at the height at which she found herself.</p>

  <p>His Serene Highness showed her the temple, finely carved within and
  without. It was not possible to see in this light the fineness of the
  workmanship. She assented to its beauty, not turning her head to the carving,
  nor to him. Suddenly he swung round to her with a complete change of tone and
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Madam, do you think I will endure this?"</p>

  <p>She drew herself up now.</p>

  <p>"You have no pity, no shame, to speak to me like this." Her head dropped
  into her hands, and she sat very still.</p>

  <p>Her husband stepped to her side.</p>

  <p>"Why," he mocked, bending over her, "it is a pity he should not know of
  this desertion of yours&mdash;is it not, madam?"</p>

  <p>She looked up.</p>

  <p>"Not know?"</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector laughed.</p>

  <p>"'Does she favour you?'" he quoted. "I had your letter in my pocket, but I
  asked him that. 'Oh! rest assured she does not care,' he answered me. If
  <i>she</i> had cared, she had been on my horse before me, and we miles away.'
  But you were not so courageous, madam. He does not know?"</p>

  <p>The Princess sat rigid. This was a new and terrible thought&mdash;he
  thought she did not care! All his life he would think that, and she would
  never be able to tell him. Her silence that day had been mistaken&mdash;her
  cowardice! Yes, she had been a coward, and this man was telling her
  so&mdash;this man who knew her heart. He was mocking her with her lost
  chance.</p>

  <p>"You do a dangerous thing," she said in a stifled voice. "What object have
  you in maddening me?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said quietly. "It does sting you&mdash;you thought that he
  knew&mdash;that kept you calm."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I could tell him yet!" she cried passionately.</p>

  <p>He flung up his head.</p>

  <p>"Then, by Cod, I could have my vengeance on both of you! You are my wife
  now."</p>

  <p>She stared at his figure, black against the misty starlight. He moved, and
  she passed from the temple out into the air again, as if she stifled.</p>

  <p>"You can never speak, I think," said his Serene Highness; "and why should
  you wish to? He never knew, and you can forget." He could hear her quick
  breathing.</p>

  <p>"You insult me," she said thickly. "I trusted you once, and you use what I
  told you as an insult. I appealed to you, and you mock me with it? Why do you
  hate us both? You never cared for me. You might have set me free, but you
  were jealous that it should be he. You hated him. Why?" Her voice
  strengthened. "Because you have a lackey's soul, and are not fit to hold his
  stirrup! You!&mdash;you who had my letter and let him think I did not
  care!"</p>

  <p>He made a movement forward, and caught her arm. "Curse your tongue!" he
  said under his breath. "Remember who I am."</p>

  <p>She shuddered at his touch, shrank away. Then, maddened and reckless,
  flung him off and made a blind step back. They were both on the edge of the
  cascade&mdash;a thing of stone, without movement, blind, dumb, deadly. His
  Serene Highness staggered unaccountably. Her whole strength could not have
  sufficed to throw him over, but he had caught his high heel on a loose stone
  and lost his balance.</p>

  <p>"Take care!" shrieked the Princess, forgetful of everything save that she
  could see him staggering backwards. She flung out her hand, and then,
  screaming, fell back with it over her eves. She had seen him grasp at the
  bushes, seen his ruffles, mere patches of white, as he tossed up his
  arms.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It was all over in a second, incredibly soon. In one horrible flash she
  could see the whole ghastly thing. There was no hope for him. She turned sick
  at the thought of the smooth face of the rock&mdash;the hard stone at the
  bottom. In her horror she used his name, called him by it. "Charles!" she
  shrieked. "Charles!"</p>

  <p>She dragged herself on her knees to the edge of the cascade, and, clinging
  to the plants, peered fearfully down. Nothing save red lights and
  shadow&mdash;nothing! He had made no sound&mdash;he could not have fallen.
  She sprang up, expecting to see his figure at her side, expecting to hear his
  mocking voice&mdash;to see the cruel gleam of his eyes. Nothing.</p>

  <p>"Charles!" she cried again, and ran wildly down the path.</p>

  <p>At the bottom she turned, hardly daring to look, hardly knowing what she
  did, or what had happened. By the red glow of the gala lamps she saw him
  lying out in the stone basin, his arms flung wide.</p>

  <p>In his bridal clothes that glittered white and silver&mdash;lying there
  with a mocking expression on his upturned face&mdash;or was it only the
  flicker from the swaying lamps? He was dead.</p>

  <p>She could neither cry out now nor speak. In a slow, fascinated horror she
  gazed on him. He was dead! It seemed impossible, beyond the mind to bear,
  that anyone should die so suddenly.</p>

  <p>Her first cry had brought people from the grounds near. One or two,
  loitering in the shrubbery, came hurrying up. They saw two white figures lit
  by the trembling little lamps; he, motionless, with the light flickering to
  and fro on his upturned face; she staring down from the edge of the
  basin.</p>

  <p>"The Prince!" cried one.</p>

  <p>"He fell from the cascade," she said, her voice faint and strange. "He is
  dead, I think. Oh, yes, I think he is dead."</p>

  <p>As she spoke a blue moth fluttered out of the darkness and settled on the
  dead man's face. She gave a little cry, for, in an extraordinary way, the
  sight of the blue wings reminded her of what this meant to her.</p>

  <p>She was free.</p>

  <p>A whispering, panic-stricken crowd came and went. They stooped over the
  Prince, hurrying each other with stretchers and lights. The old Chancellor
  came up to the Princess, where she stood mute.</p>

  <p>"Will not your Highness come in?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"Madam," he answered solemnly, "he is dead. We must send for the
  Elector."</p>

  <p>"The Elector!" she echoed, as she watched them lifting the dead man.
  "There is your Elector!"</p>

  <p>The Chancellor took her hands in his.</p>

  <p>"My child," he said gently, "he is dead. Prince Frederic George is the
  Elector now."</p>

  <p>The people, the lights, the dead Prince in his white satins, the
  Chancellor's pale face, the blue moth fluttering away, all swirled together
  before her vision into a flaming darkness.</p>

  <p>His brother's wife a few hours&mdash;his brother's widow for always. He
  the Elector, and coming back to Hesse-Homburg, and she&mdash;she could never
  tell him now he did not know.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-7"
     id="ch-7"></a>VII. &mdash; A BROKEN CUPID</h2>

  <p class="first">It was raining steadily; low clouds hung over the palace and
  the gardens; there had been no sun all day, yet the air held a sweetness only
  possible in midsummer, and the wet flowers were very fragrant. The Princess
  sat at her open window and watched the falling rain.</p>

  <p>To-day the new Elector was coming home.</p>

  <p>There was only one royal residence in Hesse-Homburg, so he and she must be
  ever under the same roof, yet for ever separated. Etiquette and the articles
  of her marriage treaty forbade her return to her family. His position
  rendered it impossible for him to reside anywhere but here. As she stared out
  into the wet garden she pictured the life that was before her. She was young;
  there might be many years of it&mdash;empty days following one another
  unbroken by aught save those formal occasions when she would meet him in the
  presence of his Court and pass a few ceremonious words.</p>

  <p>All! better never to see him again than to see him thus&mdash;his
  brother's widow!</p>

  <p>She tried piteously to hope that use would dull her feeling, that as long
  as years passed by she would so school herself that she would cease to care.
  She had heard it said that custom would ease any pain.</p>

  <p>Her day&mdash;her chance&mdash;both were over&mdash;utterly indeed. She
  had no morrow to look forward to down the dreary vista of her future, nothing
  save her grave at the end of it.</p>

  <p>She found herself picturing all that might arise. He did not know; now she
  could never tell him. What if he were not so faithful to an unreturned
  passion, as she must be? Perhaps he would bring a wife to the castle;
  Hesse-Homburg would think it strange if he did not, and she must endure
  that&mdash;his wife!</p>

  <p>Then she fell to thinking on her tomb, and wondering how long she might
  live. In death there would be no escape for her; they would put her in the
  old church, beside Prince Charles Augustus&mdash;there would be no word of
  the man she loved upon her grave.</p>

  <p>"Princess Carola Sophia of Strelitz-Homburg, wife of Charles Augustus,
  Prince Elector of Hesse-Homburg, born 1748, died &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Died when? she wondered. She had heard people could live a long time with
  a broken heart.</p>

  <p>Moving heavily from the window, she picked up a little hand-mirror and
  looked at herself. The mourning she wore emphasised her pallor; to herself
  she did not look beautiful, but infinitely sad.</p>

  <p>How did he look now&mdash;he, riding back to his kingdom? Gradually this
  thought obtained possession of her. He was coming home today.</p>

  <p>She left her room, and went about the empty, silent palace, looking into
  the gorgeous rooms that had been the dead Prince's pride.</p>

  <p>Her restless steps led her into one new to her. A harpsichord stood in the
  corner, and a harp in a silk case. The Princess seated herself on the
  music-stool, and began turning over the books of music lying about.</p>

  <p>The rain splashed against the long windows, and the trees shivered without
  in the soft breeze. The Princess began to play an aimless melody. Nameless
  memories clutched at her heart. The patter of the raindrops seemed to gather
  into the sound of his horse's hoof, the sighing trees to form his voice; he
  was coming back&mdash;to-day&mdash;to-day. The loneliness was balm to the
  wild regret of her thoughts. She played softly, and pictured a woman younger,
  fairer than herself coming through a soft glade lit by the setting sun, and a
  man waiting for her by a low wall, a man in a pink ball dress, his brown hair
  free, his eyes ardent. He spoke, and, while he spoke, the woman stood mute,
  like a coward, like a frightened child. Then he rode away, trampling
  underfoot the roses he had flung from his saddle.</p>

  <p>She played more loudly now. She saw a moonlit night, a little village
  sleeping under the stars, an old man standing by the horses' heads, a
  guttering candle in one hand.</p>

  <p>"He went to the cross roads; I do not know which one he took."</p>

  <p>The rain beat more fiercely on the window; the gusty grey clouds gathered
  and spread. The Princess ceased playing for a while, her hands fell in her
  lap, she stored before her.</p>

  <p>Then she recommenced a mournful fantasy of melody. As she played she
  pictured a man lying still in the red light of the gala lamps with a mocking
  face upturned; he wore a white bridal dress, all glimmering and silver, and
  he was dead.</p>

  <p>She stopped again. Oh! the intolerable day, the beat of the rain, the sigh
  of the trees, and the thought of him riding nearer&mdash;nearer! She picked
  up the music again, turned it over; the words of one song caught her
  eyes:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  Haste while the sun is high.<br>
  Summer gilds the heavy grain.<br>
  The lark hangs in the sky."</p><br>

  <p>With trembling fingers she played the air.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?.<br>
  'Tis only once for churls and kings.<br>
  Present joy's worth future pain.<br>
  And youth is heir of many things."</p><br>

  <p>Oh, folly!&mdash;oh, bitterness unbelievable! It was only once
  indeed&mdash;never again would the glory come for her!</p><br>

  <p class="poem">When shall the morning come again?<br>
  This day, this day alone is thine.<br>
  Up for thy little span to reign<br>
  Ere Death shall say, 'The night is mine.'"</p><br>

  <p>The Princess bowed her head over the keys. In her ears were the steady
  drip of the rain and the tap of the jasmine against the window; in her heart
  utter loneliness and desolation.</p>

  <p>After a while the sting of it became intolerable. She rose, walked down
  the long room, and opened the door at the end.</p>

  <p>She found herself in a little antechamber facing Pigalle's Cupid, who
  smiled at her from his solitude. The Princess advanced into the room and shut
  the door. In her black dress, with her sad, serious face and subdued bearing,
  she was a strange figure in the gay little room, its walls painted with
  spring flowers and its ceiling showing gay summer skies and lazy floating
  clouds. Laughing masks bound with bright ribbons hung on the gilded trellis
  of the panels, and on the white door was the figure of a little lady holding
  a pink parasol and framed in a wreath of roses.</p>

  <p>It was all new and untouched, barely finished; the dead Elector's taste,
  the dead Elector's orders&mdash;he, fresh from Versailles and the salons of
  Paris, had planned this, watched its progress, and approved. A pang came over
  her, so reflecting. When he was alive she had found his arrogant, selfish
  absorption in the imitation glories of his kingdom hateful; now it seemed as
  pitiful as terrible that he had built his death into the sham cascade he had
  been so proud of; the very paltriness of his aims and desires, the very
  prettiness of the room she was in now, served to emphasise the bitterness of
  his end.</p>

  <p>She looked up to the gilt Cupid on his gilt pedestal; a little dust had
  gathered on his shoulders and head; not many weeks ago the Elector had
  brought him from France and set him there, yet already he was neglected.</p>

  <p>The Princess shuddered. It seemed a portent&mdash;that dust lying lightly
  on the shoulders of love. Would not that be the most terrible thing of
  all&mdash;that they should grow cold&mdash;that, living so near, they should
  forget&mdash;that he should live comfortably with another woman, and give her
  pleasant, easy greeting when they met&mdash;and she should come to smile at
  moments such as these? Better to die&mdash;oh! better far to die in the
  summer time, while love was young and sweet, than to live to see him age and
  fade, not caring.</p>

  <p>She set the window open, and leant her sick head against the mullions.</p>

  <p>The rain was over; the clouds had broken in a great rift over the sky of a
  stainless blue; glimpses of pale watery sunshine shone in the raindrops that
  hung on flowers and bushes; the air was redolent of the perfume of wet earth
  and the scent of pinks and roses; the distant landscape, the park land and
  hills seen through and beyond the trees, were infinitely far away, soft and
  peaceful, as if they lay under a silver haze.</p>

  <p>How long the day was!</p>

  <p>Because of his brother's sudden tragic death he was coming quietly. There
  would be no triumphal entry, no public welcome. Would he come to see her
  to-day or to-morrow? Would he avoid her altogether?</p>

  <p>Once the new Elector established, she would not he free of the palace as
  now; she must stay in her own apartments. At this, her tortured thoughts took
  another swift turn. From her room, from any of her rooms, could she see him
  come and go? Could she see him ride away, and watch for his return? There was
  a chamber commanding the avenue; one of her ladies had it now; but she could
  change. Her wan face flushed at the thought. All their formalities could not
  rob her of that; she might, unseen, sometimes gaze on him and know by his
  bearing whether he were merry or sad, sick or well&mdash;beguile the dull
  days by watching for him, and cheat herself with imagining that she might
  welcome him on his return. She lifted her eyes to the west; a faint gold
  began to stain the clouds. The sun was setting.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"When shall the morning come again?<br>
  This day. this day alone is thine:<br>
  Up for thy little span to reign.<br>
  Ere Death shall say 'The night is mine!'"</p><br>

  <p>Her lips shaped the words of the song. She was standing very still. Then
  suddenly there came the measured distant sound of horses. The blood rushed to
  her heart. Now that the moment had come, terror amounting to panic seized her
  weakness. She could not fare it. She could not.</p>

  <p>With a distracted idea of hiding herself or flying any she turned into the
  room.</p>

  <p>The beat of the hoofs came nearer. She turned back wildly to close the
  window, that she might not hear them, and, in her eager, unconsidered
  movement, the end of her lace scarf caught the smiling Cupid and hurled him
  from his gilt pedestal on to the ground. He lay at her feet in half a hundred
  fragments&mdash;the biscuit statuette that the dead Elector had brought so
  carefully from France.</p>

  <p>The sight of it in a strange manner quieted her. She let the window stand
  open, and put her hands to her brow.</p>

  <p>If she could not control herself better than this, it augured ill for the
  future. If she had no more pride or dignity than this, she was unworthy of
  her own traditions. If she could not face the meeting now, when she had been
  all day preparing for it, she could never face it. She turned her eyes from
  the broken Cupid at her feet, and resolutely glanced at herself in the
  mirror.</p>

  <p>He did not know; then he should not read it from her face! She saw herself
  pale, but not too pale for a woman widowed on her wedding eve and with her
  husband only a week in his grave. She bit her lips to bring some colour into
  them, and smoothed her hair at the temples where the loose curls had strayed.
  Then, with an unfaltering step, she went out on the stairway.</p>

  <p>The Prince's household were gathered there, and two of her own women
  looking for her. She beckoned them to her. They noticed nothing remarkable in
  her demeanour. She held herself very erect, and advanced to the head of the
  stairs. He was coming up. Behind him followed officers and gentlemen. He wore
  a long travelling cloak, and carried his hat in his hand.</p>

  <p>He had not looked up before he was face to face with her.</p>

  <p>The Princess felt that in this instant she must conquer or be conquered,
  betray her secret or for ever guard it. With a supreme effort she lifted her
  eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Hesse-Homburg, your Serene Highness," she said in a low, clear
  voice. "Even though the occasion of your coming be sad for you and me."</p>

  <p>He slowly flushed. She could read an extraordinary disappointment, wonder,
  question in his tired eyes, in his haggard young face.</p>

  <p>"We have to condole with each other," he answered unsteadily. "Yet thank
  you, madam, for your welcome."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand; he bent over it, and his lips brushed her
  finger-tips; then she curtsied, and passed away in the direction of her
  apartments.</p>

  <p>He did not look after her, nor did she turn her head to Bare at him. In
  the heart of each the name of the other was crying aloud.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-8"
     id="ch-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; PRINCE CHARLES AUGUSTUS INTERVENES</h2>

  <p class="first">The slow, rich time of summer had ripened into autumn. It
  was fair, cloudless weather. Day after day the deep gold sunlight lay over
  the harvest fields, the yellowing trees, the garden with its few late
  flowers, over the castle of Hesse-Homburg where the Elector's standard hung
  heavily in the warm air.</p>

  <p>The Prince Elector and the Princess had lived side by side in the castle
  for three years, and the life of the little court and the little kingdom went
  on about them in the even round of work and pleasure.</p>

  <p>Once a day, attended by his gentlemen, he went to pay her his formal duty.
  He found her always surrounded by her company, in her little rose-pink
  drawing-room. A few conventional words would pass between them, and he would
  retire to live through the hours until he might come again. Generally she was
  sewing or making knots; very often she never lifted her eyes to him; not once
  had she smiled even faintly. Her ladies had the idea that she disliked her
  husband's brother. It was only natural, they thought, that she, Princess of
  Hesse-Homburg for a few hours, should feel bitterly towards the man who had
  stepped into her husband's position.</p>

  <p>The court had resumed an old-fashioned quiet. Prince Charles Augustus had,
  for a brief while, introduced the spirit of novelty, of display, of stately
  gaiety, but that was over; the artists, the workmen, the opera singers were
  dismissed; the great white and gold half-unfinished ball-room, the little
  gilded antechambers, were shut away and neglected.</p>

  <p>The French gardens planned by the dead Elector were left incomplete, and
  Prince Frederic George had been seen to tear up and burn with his own hands
  some elaborate drawings illustrative of an enlarged and gorgeous palace that
  he had found in his brother's desk.</p>

  <p>Those who had known Prince Frederic long could not fail to notice a great
  change in him&mdash;a change not of manner only, it appeared to be deeper
  than that; his very character had altered.</p>

  <p>He had never been studious or inclined to gravity, but rather of a gay and
  careless nature, apt to spend his time in pleasant idleness. He had written
  poetry, been fond of music and the dance, and an eager pursuer of such
  diversions as the little state afforded.</p>

  <p>Now, serious and cold beyond his years, he gave all his time to the
  affairs of his kingdom, which he administered with a painful attention to
  justice and the wellbeing of his subjects. He cut down his personal expenses,
  and relieved some of the taxes his brother had imposed; such leisure as he
  had he employed in serious studies.</p>

  <p>Balls, concerts, and hunting parties were unknown; the beautiful park,
  owned by the Electors and closed for centuries, was thrown open to the
  people, who were suffered to wander to the very garden gates of the palace.
  The nobility grumbled at the dulness of the court, and the idlers who had
  been attracted by his brother's hint of profusion mocked at the Prince for
  his lack of taste and sober life. Yet, none the less, the young Elector held
  a charm; no one could dislike him. His very quiet, his very reserve showed a
  self-containment dignifying his demeanour and attracting attention. His
  coldness, his aloofness were tempered by a great sweetness, and there was a
  pathos in the gravity of one so young that was curiously winning.</p>

  <p>The Princess, too, had altered. Her companions at the Court of
  Strelitz-Homburg had known her as a laughter-loving girl of high spirits,
  quick and keen with the joy of living; now, in the full pride of her youth,
  she appeared to have resigned herself utterly to the dull life of a dowager
  Princess in a small German court. She showed no regrets for old lost
  gaieties, no fret at the meagre, empty days. Her ladies found her a
  sympathetic confidante, a tender friend. She spent her time in pretty useless
  sewing and in playing on the harpsichord. Those who were daily with her did
  not notice how the character of her beauty had changed, how frail and white
  she looked, her eyes too bright and her smile too ready.</p>

  <p>Once in the three years since her husband's death, the Margravine, her
  mother, came to see her, impelled by curiosity.</p>

  <p>Remembering that scene in the park, when she had come on them gazing at
  each other with their souls in their eyes, she could not but wonder how they
  were meeting this unlooked-for situation.</p>

  <p>But her daughter quelled her; the Margravine dare not question that gentle
  dignity, and found her curiosity overawed before the Princess's proud, still
  eyes. So she returned as she had come, wondering, thinking, and
  congratulating herself she was the only one who knew what lay behind the
  change that had fallen on the life and youth of Hesse-Homburg.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Denton knew.</p>

  <p>He stayed on in Prince Frederic George's service, quiet, unobtrusive,
  light-footed, almost like part of the furniture, but he knew.</p>

  <p>The Princess had not spoken to him since the night of her
  arrival&mdash;her wedding night; but on one rare occasion, meeting the Prince
  Elector by accident, Mr. Denton was in attendance. She was returning from a
  drive, and, as her little chariot swept up to the palace doors, the Prince
  was on the steps and Mr. Denton behind him, holding his coat. He lifted his
  hat gravely; she bent her head and looked, not at the master, but at the man.
  Her eloquent eyes flashed one entreaty, one command. "You will be
  silent."</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton made a little movement of deference that answered her
  assuredly: "Yes, madam."</p>

  <p>She was content with it; she trusted Mr. Denton.</p>

  <p>Among all the curious thoughts that came to her in her great loneliness,
  this was the most curious of all&mdash;that the Prince was ignorant of her
  strange ride through the moonlight; that he did not know by how little she
  had missed him&mdash;for ever.</p>

  <p>This glorious burning autumn, she fell a little sick and languishing; for
  the first time, in three years, she could not see the Prince when he came to
  wait on her. Being told this, the Elector went away with a sense of shock
  numbing him; dismissing all his companions, he walked into the woods beyond
  the gardens. The leaves had mostly fallen from the trees and lay thickly
  about their roots; wild creepers coloured in gold and scarlet, amber and
  bronze, trailed and twisted over the Prince's path. A blackbird was singing,
  and the sky was intensely blue.</p>

  <p>The Prince walked on steadily until he came to a low, dark pool, set under
  the trees quietly in a little hollow with the great ferns about it; there he
  stopped, and, seating himself on the great bole of a tree, stared down at the
  water.</p>

  <p>The formal conventions, the rigid rules by which he had these three years
  lived, the things that had bound yet supported him, seemed to have suddenly
  failed, to have become as nothing. She was sick, and he might not see
  her.</p>

  <p>He knew now what that one sight of her every day had meant to him; that,
  with that to mark the hours, with that to look forward to, to look back on,
  life was bearable; without it, it was unbearable.</p>

  <p>Wrath and rebellion gathered slowly in his heart; such a fierce hatred of
  the chains that bound him that he shivered as he sat.</p>

  <p>Why should he be silent&mdash;why? What right had God or man to ask this
  life of him?</p>

  <p>He lifted his eyes from the dark water to the thick interlacing boughs of
  the beech overhead through which he could see strange little bright shapes of
  sky. He clenched his hands and set his teeth&mdash;a wave of indescribable,
  intense feeling came over him.</p>

  <p>He found that he was resolving to speak to her&mdash;resolving to break
  through the intangible bonds that held him, to put her once more to the test
  as he had done before, to hear her speak to him with the veil torn away
  between them. And even as he resolved this, he went from hot to cold in an
  extraordinary horrible manner and turned slowly, so that he faced the end of
  the long, sloping roots on which he sat.</p>

  <p>For he knew absolutely, surely, that the dead Elector was standing there,
  defying him, daring him to put his resolution in effect. All these long three
  years this shadow had been between them, and the Prince knew that it was
  there now, though he could see nothing hut the mysterious depths of the wood,
  hear nothing but the little sharp rustle of the leaves overhead.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said hoarsely. "Well, how long did you think that I could bear
  it?" The sound of his voice frightened him; he clenched his hands tighter,
  but he did not lower his head, nor turn his eyes from the spot where his
  brother stood menacing, cruel. A little shower of dead leaves fluttered about
  him. He spoke again, straightening himself as he sat.</p>

  <p>"I am going to her," he said through his teeth. "Yes, you may threaten me,
  but I am going to her."</p>

  <p>Still his brother was there, immovable.</p>

  <p>The Elector rose.</p>

  <p>"You never loved her. What can you know about it? I am going to her
  now."</p>

  <p>The silence of the wood, that was utter silence, yet seemed to stir with
  strange half-heard noises, encompassed him; and, as he moved slowly over the
  dead leaves, he knew that his dead brother was before him, facing him. The
  Elector put his hands to his throat; he felt stifled, overpowered in an
  unequal struggle. The little breeze that played through the leaves and
  touched his brow seemed to burn as if it blew from flames. Still he walked
  on, slowly but steadily, in the direction of the palace.</p>

  <p>"I am going to her," he repeated through his set teeth. "You&mdash;you are
  not to be <i>always</i> between us; you cannot frighten me."</p>

  <p>It was a struggle between the living and the dead. His brother was
  striving to hold him back; their two spirits were in the shock of an
  encounter as if their bodies wrestled. Still he pursued his way, with wide
  eyes and hands loosening his cravat or clutching at his side. And, now and
  then, he spoke in a low, thick voice to that presence that was ever fronting
  him.</p>

  <p>"Not always&mdash;you cannot prevent me!" He stopped with sudden mad
  fierceness, and the dead man stopped, too, and waited across the path.</p>

  <p>"You never cared!" repeated the Elector; "you had not died and left her if
  you had cared. Stand out of my way. Had you loved as I love, you had not
  died!"</p>

  <p>It was growing dark; the shadows thickened sombrely about the trees; the
  wind increased in strength and rustled mournfully in the boughs; the haunted
  man gave a groan and continued his way down the lonely, darkening path. The
  dead Elector came to his side, keeping measure with his steps, menacing,
  compelling. He put his hands before his eyes, he held his ears.</p>

  <p>It was of no avail; he could see nothing when he looked round, he could
  hear nothing when he listened yet he knew that his brother was beside him,
  keeping measure with him, step by step. When he hid his eyes and held his
  ears, it made no difference; spirit and spirit met. At last, he came out of
  the wood into fields lying lonely and mysterious under the twilight sky. He
  could see the distant palace and the lights twinkling in her rooms.</p>

  <p>"I am going to her," he muttered. "I am going to tell her."</p>

  <p>A great weariness overpowered him; his steps Ragged, his head fell forward
  and his hands grew slack. But the dead Elector was unwearied; again before
  him, preceding him, across the dim fields, invisible to the senses, patent to
  the soul.</p>

  <p>Gradually it became unbearable: the Prince shivered, and his courage fell
  from him.</p>

  <p>"Will you leave me?" he muttered, his eyes straining before him. He
  stopped, baffled by the pitiless presence. If it should <i>never</i> go!</p>

  <p>The rising wind ruffled the low grass; the sun was setting in a golden
  grey hair, distantly, beyond the palace; a flight of birds flew homeward
  above the roof and turrets. Still the two brothers faced each other.</p>

  <p>The living man fell to his knees.</p>

  <p>"I will not speak. Go! take yourself away. I will not speak!"</p>

  <p>He saw his brother's eyes gleaming with the old, cruel triumph; a shiver
  took him from head to foot; then he knew that he was alone&mdash;at a
  price!</p>

  <p>He sank face downwards in the soft grass.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-9"
     id="ch-9"></a>IX. &mdash; HER SERENE HIGHNESS EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">The stars were out most brilliantly above the snow. The fir
  trees rose up dark and stately against them, calling to mind the legend of
  St. Wilfred, who thus, by seeing the stars hanging low and shining through
  the boughs of the fir, discovered God's Christmas tree, which men must
  imitate as best they may.</p>

  <p>The Elector rode along the little village street, and looked in at the
  open church door.</p>

  <p>A warm, beautiful light shone across the snow-clad churchyard and fell
  tenderly on the graves. The windows showed clear and golden in the dark form
  of the building. There was the sound of the feet of little children and their
  hushed voices as they moved to and fro within. They were decorating the
  church; to-morrow was Christmas day.</p>

  <p>Presently the organist, a young man with blonde hair, came along the
  street, followed by two of the bell-ringers. The foremost carried a lantern;
  in the swinging light it cast the Elector could see the dark, muffled figures
  passing up the churchyard path. They laughed as they went, in a light-hearted
  fashion; then, one by one, entered the church. 'the Elector, wrapped in his
  heavy cloak, sat his horse motionless, his eyes always fixed on the open
  church door.</p>

  <p>Presently the low music of the organ filled the still, cold air; paused,
  began again, and died assay in stately mournfulness.</p>

  <p>The Elector rode slowly on. The organ broke into triumphal melody; the
  children came running out of the church, and chased each other joyously down
  the snow-covered path. Their dark footprints showed behind them in the
  glittering white. Then someone shut the door, and the children ran into the
  distance. There was nothing but the starlight on the graves and the little
  murmur of the wind in the fir trees shading them.</p>

  <p>The snow rose in little clouds from the hoofs of the Elector's horse as he
  quickened his pace, and the wintry air was sharp on his face, grave and set.
  Between the white-roofed houses, where candle-light fell through the tiny
  square windows and glistened strangely on the snow-hung eaves, he rode back
  towards the lonely palace.</p>

  <p>What had taken him abroad to-night he did not know. The unrest of long
  unhappiness was in his heart, driving him aimlessly up and down under the
  stars.</p>

  <p>He wondered what she felt to-night&mdash;how the world seemed to her. He
  was fiercely glad that she did not care as he cared; it saved her the pain
  that was breaking his heart. Did she find life intolerably long as spring,
  summer and winter came and went with nothing to mark them? Did she guess that
  he never ceased to think of her, day and night% She had given him no sign, no
  look, to bridge the great silence that divided them. Of late he had not often
  seen her; she had sent excuses at the hours of his visit, and he tortured
  himself wondering if she had wearied of the mere sight of him. That would,
  indeed, complete his misery.</p>

  <p>He cleared the village, and rode towards the palace gates. A party of
  people coming gaily along the road saluted him cheerfully, not knowing who he
  was, and he answered them, with a pang of envy at their happiness. As he
  neared the gates a horseman, leaving them, came swiftly towards him, passed
  him, stopped, and, drawing rein quickly, turned his horse's head.</p>

  <p>"His Highness?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Denton. The Prince drew rein.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked with a curious thrill.</p>

  <p>"I have a letter for you from her Serene Highness, sir."</p>

  <p>"For me?"</p>

  <p>Under the lamp that swung above the great gates, master and man saw each
  other pale and wild-eyed in the light of it.</p>

  <p>"For me?" repeated the Prince fiercely. He held out his hand. "How did you
  come by it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir," said Mr. Denton in a strange voice, "her Highness came to the
  door of her room. She desired me to come to her. She gave me this. I rode out
  to find you."</p>

  <p>"She spoke to you!" cried the Prince. "Give me the letter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Denton handed him a scrap of paper, such as silk is wound on, folded
  over and fastened with a green wafer.</p>

  <p>So ghastly was the young man's face, so distraught and terrible, that the
  valet put his hand on his arm imploringly.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, sir&mdash;," he began.</p>

  <p>The Elector did not hear him. By the yellow flicker of the lamp be read
  her letter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I have always wanted to tell you; I have always wanted to
  come to you, but <i>he</i> has prevented me. Now I think it must be near the
  end, for he lets me alone to-night. I think that you have not heard me say
  how utterly I love you&mdash;I think you do not know. I have always been
  faithful&mdash;I asked him to set me free. I came after you when you were at
  Hartheim, but I was too late. It has been my fault&mdash;I was a coward; I
  lost my chance, and he does not know pity. Still, he lets me alone to-night.
  It is so strange to speak at last. I have put my lips to this paper where you
  must touch it when you break it open. Good night, my
  love&mdash;good-night&mdash;good-bye."</p><br>

  <p>He crushed the letter up against his heart, and fell to laughing. The
  tears were running down Mr. Denton's face.</p>

  <p>"Her Highness is a dying woman, sir," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The Elector continued laughing terribly.</p>

  <p>"Dying! Dying!"</p>

  <p>"Of a broken heart, sir," said Mr. Denton. "She asked them to bring her a
  little Christmas tree, and light it and put it in the window, and leave her
  with it."</p>

  <p>"What do you talk of?" cried the Elector passionately. "Death? What is
  death to us now?"</p>

  <p>He struck his spurs into his horse, and galloped down the avenue to the
  palace, Mr. Denton alter him in an awestruck, silent sorrow. The Elector
  sprang from his horse beneath the palace walls.</p>

  <p>He had drawn rein below the snow-covered stair that led to her balcony.
  There was a light in her window above; not a sound to break the winter
  stillness. Mr. Denton dismounted, and held the horses' bridles. The Elector
  scaled the balustrade and mounted the spotless stairs. The light breaking of
  the snow beneath his feet was the only noise.</p>

  <p>He put out his hand. The window was ajar, and the fir tree covered with
  candles stood in the estrade. By the delicate glow of it he saw into the
  room. As he looked, the bells clanged suddenly into noisy music. He stepped
  through the window into her room. She was not there. He felt his brother's
  presence, mocking, triumphant.</p>

  <p>The whole palace seemed to rock and sway with the swinging peal of the
  bells. He crossed to the empty bed.</p>

  <p>The cold, white, fragrant room was filled only by the holy light of the
  little tree. It served to show him what be had come for.</p>

  <p>He passed to the other side of the bed, and saw her, as he knew he would,
  lying along the floor, white as the snow without, save for the gold twist of
  her hair that trailed along the carpet.</p>
