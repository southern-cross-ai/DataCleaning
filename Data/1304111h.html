<p>The journey of about 1,054 miles from Adelaide to Bond Springs
was of an uneventful character. The camels to be used upon the
expedition, belonging to Messrs. Chewings, were in readiness at
the Peake, which is the present terminus of the railway line from
Adelaide, and as the greater portion of the stores were lying at
Bond Springs, having been left there by the first expedition when
recalled to Adelaide, the camels were not burdened with stores.
From the Finke to Bond Springs the weather was extremely hot, the
thermometer for several days recording 172&deg; in the sun, and
upon one occasion 178&deg;. The sand was so intensely hot that
the camels were unable to stand still during our short halt for
midday meals. The heat, dust, and flies by day, and the ants by
night, during the last 100 miles of the journey, made life
anything but agreeable, and we were thankful when we sighted our
temporary home at Bond Springs We could now fairly anticipate
that the hot season would be succeeded by cool weather, and that
our journey to the westward would be in the cool season. The
stores left at Bond Springs were found to be thrown together in a
disgraceful state, and I was much grieved on examining the flour
to find our principal article of food for the next four months to
be both wevilled and maggotty. During our stay here several men
came in from the alluvial goldfields, about seventy miles to the
eastward. The largest nugget I saw weighed about 5dwts. These
diggers were not particularly sanguine of the success of the new
field. The water was fast drying up, and rations were at a
ruinous price. At the new township of Stuart there were four
stores, and a publichouse was in the course of erection.</p>
<p>At Alice Springs I had the pleasure of meeting with a veteran
explorer in the person of John Ross, aged 72 years, who is still
hale, active, and strong. Took a number of photographs of the
station and neighborhood during my stay here. Having completed
the re-packing of the stores, and all the preliminaries having
been arranged for a four months' journey, on March 13th, I went
down to the Alice Springs telegraph station to forward dispatches
and to receive any letters or parcels that might have arrived by
the mail which reached there last night. Returned to Bond
Springs, which is twelve miles north of Alice Springs. I felt
much disappointed that a supply of seeds and dates promised by
the Conservator of Forests had not arrived. A blunder appears to
have been made by the Railway Department in misdirecting the
parcel. The opportunity now afforded for planting date palms in
Central Australia is passed. The experiment would have been both
valuable and interesting, as I was anxious to have tested certain
localities where I knew good soil and permanent water existed.
Date palms in fruit at permanent watering places would prove an
inestimable blessing to the famished and wearied traveller in
tropical Australia; and nothing would have given me greater
satisfaction than to have been favored with the pioneer work of
so philanthrophic an undertaking.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, March</i> 14<i>th</i>, 1889.&mdash;Bond Springs.
The party, consisting of myself, David Beetson, Fred. Warman, a
black-tracker (Billy, from the ranks of the native police at
Alice Springs), and a small native boy, left the Bond Springs
station at 1 p.m. Previous to starting we were all most
hospitably entertained at dinner by Mr. R. Taylor, the manager.
During our two weeks' stay this gentleman assisted me in every
possible way that could be prompted by a kindly nature and a
lively interest in the cause of our work.</p>
<p>Our caravan consisted of twelve camels&mdash;four for riding,
two for carrying water, the remaining six carried loads
(averaging 4cwt. each) of provisions estimated to last for nearly
four months. They had considerably improved in condition during
the journey from Crown Point, and marched off with their burdens
with ease. I had decided to follow the north slopes of the
MacDonnell Range westerly to Glen Helen station. Travelled three
miles west to low, well-grassed, stony hills; then, on a bearing
of N. 45&deg; W. for two miles, I now made the tedious ascent of
the hills and steered a course west for three miles, which took
me to the telegraph line. From here I followed the foot of the
main MacDonnell Range for eight miles, on a bearing of S. 76&deg;
W., when the Painta Spring was reached at dusk. Travelled
seventeen miles through splendidly grassed country, the timber
consisting chiefly of bloodwood, mulga, and various
leguminos&aelig; of stunted but healthy growth. Magpies and crows
were the only birds seen. Bar. 27.820in., ther. 102&deg; in the
shade at 1 p.m.; the weather was cloudy and sultry, followed by a
smart thunderstorm at 4 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, March</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 1, Painta
Springs.&mdash;As soon as daylight appeared I proceeded to
examine the surroundings, and found the Painta Spring to be a
well about 12ft. deep, and blasted out of solid rock at the foot
of the ranges, which are of no great elevation at this point. The
water, which is of the most excellent description, is raised by
means of a windlass and bucket; a line of troughs makes it a very
complete and convenient watering place. The overhanging rocks are
shaded by beautiful fig trees, which unfortunately were not in
fruit; near the well, a handsome specimen of the Zamia palm is
growing, but whether indigenous or not I cannot say. Upon my
arrival at Alice Springs on the 28th February, I placed my two
aneroids beside the standard mercurial barometer at the telegraph
station, and Mr. McKay, the officer in charge, kindly adjusted
them to it and made hourly comparisons, and up to the time of my
leaving on March 12th they were quite consistent; but the short
journey here has so affected them that, with the thermometer at
100&deg; in the shade, they show a difference of .420. I propose
after this to give the readings of the most consistent, besides
keeping a daily record of the differences. Weather cloudy, bar.
27.620in., ther. 102&deg; in the shade at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, March</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 1, Painta
Springs. Bar. 27.729in., ther. 94&deg;.&mdash;While at Bond
Springs, Fred Warman was bitten by some venomous insect upon the
cheek; this swelled up and became so inflamed that it seriously
affected his eyesight. I therefore decided not to move the party
for a few days, and resolved upon examining the ranges in the
vicinity for minerals, sketching in details, and making myself
acquainted with the country to the westward as far as
practicable. Upon these short journeys I took the black tracker
Billy, leaving Warman, Beetson, and the small boy (Weei) at the
main camp. Following up the range in a westerly direction for
seven miles I came to a pass, which appeared to be much used by
cattle. Continuing for two miles I entered upon a saltbush plain,
which appeared to be hemmed in on all sides by hills of
considerable elevation. A small gum creek traversed it in a
northerly direction, which, forcing itself through the range,
emptied itself upon the Burt Plain. Travelling south-westerly, in
four miles I had crossed this plain, and was face to face with
ranges that I found it difficult to travel over with my present
light equipment, and which would be quite impassable for the
heavily-loaded camels of the caravan. After about three miles of
severe stony travelling, I reached the watershed, and a long
leading valley took me, in about four miles, to a gum creek
flowing southerly towards the Jay Creek. Here I turned the camels
out for the night. There was the most luxuriant feed imaginable,
and a little water found in the sand was abundant for all
requirements. The afternoon and evening had been close, heavy
thunder clouds obscured the sky, and there was every indication
of a thunderstorm. The following morning broke bright and clear,
every sign of rain having vanished. I now took up a
south-westerly course, and travelled for six miles over low
granite hills, showing basalt, gneiss, and schistose slates. The
ranges now became more rugged and precipitous, and, finding it
would be quite impossible to bring the caravan this way, I turned
north-westerly upon this bearing. I travelled for nine miles over
very rough country, the camels with difficulty keeping their feet
upon the steep slopes and stony uneven surface. I then struck a
small ti-tree creek, following this down I was glad to find
myself upon the Burt Plain and good travelling ground.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, March</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;I returned to the
main camp at Painta Springs. Having now abandoned the idea of
penetrating the ranges to the southward, I started the following
day (21st) to examine the different gorges and inlets of the
range, with the hope of finding a watering-place west of the
Painta. Travelled north-westerly for two days without making any
discoveries of water that would be of any service. I was now
forty miles west of my main camp, so started to return. It
appears evident that I shall not find the travelling here by any
means easy.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, March</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 2, Painta
Spring. Bar, 27.680in., ther. 58&deg;&mdash;The morning broke
bright and clear though there are still some rain clouds to the
S.W. The evening was cold, and I had to get up during the night
to renew the fire: it is the first time this season that we have
cared to be near the fire at night The packs having been all
rearranged and weighed we cleared away from the Painta Spring at
10.45, taking a N. 85&deg; W. course along the foot of the range.
The travelling is simply perfect, level as a bowling green, the
weather delightfully cool, so we kept steadily on till dusk when
we camped, having travelled eighteen miles. The largest camel
that I have, and the one that has caused so much delay and
trouble ever since I left the Peake, lay down several times
during the day, and by continually breaking his nose rope, caused
much loss of time. Kangaroos, wallabies, crows, and crested
pigeons seen to day. Travelled about seventeen miles over level
ground on the Burt Plain. Timber, principally bloodwood and
mulga, and also noticed a few native orange trees (Capparis).</p>
<p><i>Sunday, March</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 3, Burt
Plain. Bar. 27.820in., ther. 63&deg;.&mdash;Light S.E. wind.
Camels not far distant, for their bells are distinctly heard in
the still morning air. Started away at 8.45, upon a bearing of N.
86&deg; W.; this course kept us close to the foot of the range,
at 1.15 turned direct west towards a dark hill, the most westerly
point visible. A remarkable feature in this day's journey was the
great number of large ant hills. These structures are built by a
small brown ant, and are of all sizes from the tiny edifice just
started to the largest size which are 4ft. high, and as much in
girth at the base, tapering towards the top. They are of very
irregular size and shape, and take the form of slender spires,
minarets, and domes, made of the soil from the immediate
neighborhood; they are consequently a bright brick red color, and
being very numerous give a singular appearance to the landscape.
The large ones are immovable, but the small to medium size topple
over or break in two when pushed. Heavy thunder clouds passed
over from the west in the afternoon, and one or two light showers
fell which made it much cooler. Travelled twenty-two miles over
plains of a red sandy light soil with good loamy soil in places,
on which I noticed several varieties of acacia and an occasional
orange tree. Camped at 5.15.</p>
<p><i>Monday, March</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 4, Burt
Plain. Bar. 27.835in., ther. 66&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;At this
point the highest peak of a detached range bears N. 22&deg; W.
distant about two miles, so that the travelling to-day will be in
a valley between the main MacDonnell Ranges which are here about
1,200ft. above the level of the plain, and those which appear to
be tending to the north-west. Started from camp at 8.45, N.
83&deg; W.; at three miles came across a crabhole full of water
from yesterday's rain, at which I gave all the camels an
opportunity to drink which very few availed themselves of. The
grass and herbage here was most luxuriant. The morning was fine,
cool, and pleasant, but the afternoon close and oppressive; at 3
p.m. so sharp a shower fell that all were glad to get inside
their jackets. Travelled nineteen miles, saw a few kangaroos of
the red variety. Camped at 5.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, March</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 5. Bar.
27.900in., ther. &deg;70 at 6 a.m.; cloudy, but cool all
night&mdash;This camp is very prettily situated at the entrance
of a little glade, and the range being less abrupt, grassy, and
more sloping, gave it quite a picturesque appearance. The camels
wandered away a considerable distance, and while awaiting their
arrival I made the discovery that the quicksilver from an
artificial horizon bad leaked out and was scattered all over the
boxes. Fortunately I had a spare one, and though I collected all
the quicksilver I could a great deal was lost. The camels were
brought back to their duty at 8.30, and, having spent the night
in wandering about in their hopples, they presented a very sorry
appearance. Started at 9.20, N. 80&deg; W. At noon the view to
the westward was obstructed by ranges. At 2.45 our course took us
through a small gap in the hills, which, by the way, have now
lost their imposing and mountainous appearance, though to the
southward the heights are to be seen towering above the nearer
hills. Fifteen miles from last camp we travelled west down a
rough, rocky gorge, which gradually developed into a gum creek
that turned away to the N.W. Camped at 6.30, closed in by ranges
on all sides. It was too dark to take notice of our new
surroundings, but they did not look very bright; the camels when
let go looked much disturbed. Noticed the bean tree growing among
the rocks upon the slopes of the hills. Travelled eighteen miles.
Trees and shrubs seen to-day were mulga, bean tree, ti-tree, and
grevillia.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, March</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 6, West
MacDonnell Ranges. Bar. 27.800in., ther. 61&deg; at
dawn.&mdash;The camel bells were so quickly out of hearing last
night that it gave me some cause for uneasiness. At midnight
Fred. Warman and I started after them. They were making away for
water, and had I left them "till morning they would have had such
an advance of us that the start would have been much delayed.
After much trouble and stumbling about in the darkness they were
all collected and brought back, but it was 3 o'clock before we
retired to rest. They have now been four days without water. At
dawn they were all collected again. It is evident water must be
found for them soon, or the consequences to some of them will be
serious. Started Billy away to examine a gorge about a mile or so
to the S.E., while Warman and I examined the one where the camp
is situated. Billy returned first, with the joyful intelligence
that he had found a sufficiency for present purposes. Saddled up,
and travelled up a gum creek to its source, and there found among
the rocks a small soakage in the sand. The camels were unloaded,
and three or four at a time taken up to the water. They drank
greedily, returning a second time for more; fortunately there was
abundance. This was to me a valuable and most opportune
discovery, and, though not a valuable water for a stockholder, a
traveller coming from the eastward will always gladly avail
himself of the rest and refreshment that it offers. Botanical
specimens and rock specimen No. 1 collected. Bar. 27.820in.,
ther. 102&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, March</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 6. Bar.
27.820in., ther. 72&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;The morning broke
cloudy and cool, a most agreeable change to yesterday's
temperature, but later in the afternoon the glass rose to
98&deg;. I went to the top of one of the highest peaks near the
camp, and took angles to the most prominent features. A large
high range about twelve miles Billy tells me is Mount Sonder,
bearing 174&deg;. Another very high point, which I should take to
be it, bears 281&deg; 10', distance about fifteen miles. Billy
has not been in the neighborhood since he was a boy and admits to
a little uncertainty about it. A very distant range with a
wedge-like gap between them bears 355&deg; 40'. Ranges are all
around, but offer no very distinctive peculiarities. This water
is situated some little distance up the gorge or glen, and the
approach to it is somewhat obstructed by the boulders and stones
in the bed of the creek. Remained here all day for the benefit of
the camels. Botanical specimens collected. Bar. 27.80in., ther.
100&deg; in the shade at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, March</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 7. Bar
27.80in., ther. 72&deg; at 10 a.m.&mdash;I walked up the gorge to
the waterhole and found it much diminished in volume, but there
is no doubt plenty more in the sand. The camels were absent
without leave, and we did not leave this bright little spot till
10 o'clock. After rounding the point near the camp, I took up a
course of N. 30&deg; E. for two and a half miles, when we crossed
the Gum Creek, at the head of which our camp was situated. We
were now clear of the ranges, and turned N. 45&deg; W. for nearly
two miles, when we passed between two little hills. Here I turned
N. 60&deg; W. four miles. We were now in the old position again,
<i>i.e.</i>, with a wall of ranges close to us (south) on one
side, and plains on our left of apparently indefinite extent. At
1.30 we changed again to N. 75&deg; W. for three and a half
miles; at 2.45, N. 80&deg; W. for seven miles; at 5.20, turned S.
70&deg; W. one and a half miles, and at 6 o'clock camped for the
night. The country travelled over to-day was very similar to that
passed over all the way from the Painta Spring, though it is not
half so well grassed; indeed it may be said that the surface of
the ground is entirely covered with a herb known as buckbush.
While this is a valuable food plant for camels, I am not aware
that it is so for either cattle or horses, in fact I think it is
quite the reverse. The ranges are abrupt, stony, and entirely
destitute of timber, excepting perhaps a few stunted pines, and
an occasional bean tree will be found at their base and lower
slopes. This tree is that from which the natives procure fire by
friction, and is extremely light and tough, and should be
valuable for many purposes. The ranges appear to be falling off
in height, and the fact of being able to do a little southing
leads me to believe that I shall soon be able to get through them
to the south. We had just got the camp fire strongly ablaze when
we were visited by a heavy thunder shower that wetted us through.
It passed off in half an hour, and the rest of the evening was
pleasant though cloudy; this was to be regretted, for I was
anxious to observe for latitude. Travelled twenty miles on all
courses. Trees, principally bean trees, grevillia and mulga. A
few kangaroos of the red species. and an emu were seen. Camped at
6 p.m. on an open sandy grass flat at foot of the range. Obtained
specimen of the bean tree, from which the natives make their
shields and procure fire.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, March</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 8. Bar.
27.920in., ther. 72&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;Started at 8.25 on a
bearing of S. 70&deg; W. and in 3&frac12; miles struck a gum
creek which apparently came from the southward; where we first
met with it the country had been burnt for a considerable
distance by the blacks, and many tracks of them were noticed in
the creek channel. We followed this creek in its windings south
for four miles; its course is through a country that is very
pleasing to the eye; the apparently well grassed hills (in
reality it is spinifex) the flats dotted with bloodwood which is
almost an ornamental tree, the verdure all around give to the
scene a most pleasing aspect. This creek, I think, must be the
Halleem of Colonel Warburton(?). By midday we had followed it to
its source; here I found a nice little pool of water, which,
however, we did not avail ourselves of. I now turned on a course
of S. 54&deg; W., but the bearings here must be regarded at best
as very approximate to-day, for the hills I have now entered into
are most difficult to make any headway in; kept on this bearing
for about two miles and then turned south for four miles, when we
found ourselves clear of the hills and upon a well grassed flat
that appeared to extend a considerable distance to the south;
camped at 5.30. The travelling has been slow owing to vexatious
delays and the difficulties and obstacles met with, and has been
extremely hard upon the camels. Travelled 14 miles. Saw a few
fairly-sized gum trees and a few acacias; on the creek, magpies,
eaglehawks, jays and crows seen. Rock specimens, Nos. 4 and 5,
collected. Bar. 27.60in., ther. 98&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, March</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 9. Bar.
27.670 in., ther. 72&deg;.&mdash;Started at 8.40; continued south
for two miles when we struck a cattle pad with dray track on it;
followed it up to the east for one and a half miles; it then
turned N. 85&deg; E. for two miles; here the track became so
faint that we abandoned it and turned S. 25&deg; E. for six miles
when, striking a gum creek, I turned east for three miles, the
creek splitting up into narrow channels. I turned S. 40&deg; E.
for two miles, here I struck a very decided cattle track upon
which were a number of fresh tracks; followed this for four miles
east; at 4.30 reached a clay-water channel with some very nice
waterholes in it which were now quite full; around this spot
mallee timber was observed for the first time upon this journey.
The principal, and I may say the only, timber seen, has been
mulga and bloodwood, the exceptions being bean trees and dwarf
pines and grevillia. Travelled 21 miles, which may be described
as wide open valleys well grassed and with occasional clumps of
mulga; hills and ranges upon both sides. Camped early, 4.30, but
not soon enough for a heavy thunderstorm with rain broke overhead
while we were unloading; it looked so threatening that I had
everything put under the tarpaulins, the tent rigged, and
everything made snug for the night. Two emus were seen to-day.
Botanical specimens collected.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 10. Bar.
27.720in., ther. 72&deg;.&mdash;Cloudy, close, and dull at
daybreak, much rain, with thunder and vivid lightning during the
night. A dog was heard barking this morning, which probably
belongs to some blacks' camp; but to judge from the number of
cattle and horse tracks seen last evening, I think we cannot be
far from the station. Owing to there being but very poor feed for
the camels they rambled away, and we did not get away from this
camp till 9.30. Started on a bearing of S. 75&deg; and had not
been travelling many minutes before we saw two natives
approaching; it appears they had heard the camel bells during the
night; these were soon joined by several others, until we had
quite a large escort to take us to the station, which we reached
in three miles. The manager, Mr. MacDonald, was away, but the men
showed us the best place to camp, which was a few hundred yards
down the creek. The station is situated upon a small gum creek
that runs into the Davenport creek. There is, thanks to last
night's rain, plenty of surface water in the creek; when these
fail, the station is dependent for water upon a native well
soakage. Botanical specimens collected. The natives here at this
time number about 40&mdash;men, women, and children.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, April</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen Station.
Bar. 27.760in., ther. 76&deg;.&mdash;At 6 a.m., bright, fine, and
clear. Started with Fred and Billy to make the ascent of Mount
Razorback; it lays N. 4&deg; W. from the station, distant about 4
miles. Leaving Fred at the foot with the camels to do some
prospecting in the neighbourhood, while Billy and myself prepared
for the ascent, we found it steep and in many places precipitous;
composed largely of quartzite; fragments of white quartz were
loose upon the surface, and a few quartz crystals were found.
After an hour of severe climbing, the summit was reached; the
view was not so extensive as would be supposed; Razorback is
certainly a misnomer, for there is a large area of flat country
upon the summit. A high range, that I am told is Mount Zeil (of
Giles), bears 235&deg; 30', distant about 4 miles; it is several
hundred feet higher than Mount Razorback. Mount Sender bears
111&deg; 30', distant about 8 or 9 miles. By aneroid measurement
Mount Razorback is 1,831ft. above Glen Helen station. While I was
recording these observations, Billy was hard at work building a
small cairn to commemorate our visit. We then commenced the
descent, which was almost as puzzling to me as the ascent. I was
extremely glad to reach the bottom, and once more to walk upon
level ground Rock specimen No. 8 collected.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen Station.
Bar. 27.700in., ther. 66&deg;.&mdash;Cloudy and cold during the
night: light east wind this morning. Preparing letter for the
mail which leaves here on Saturday. Repairing camel saddles.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, April</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen. Started
from the camp with Fred and Billy to make the ascent of Mount
Sonder, travelled easterly down the creek for three miles, and
than turned a little northerly towards the mountain. Directly we
left the alluvial flats of the creek, we entered upon low stony
hills covered with mulga scrub; as we neared the range, these
became very dense, until we arrived at its base, where there was
a large gum creek that appeared to take its rise at the western
end of Mount Sonder, which is called the Redbank Creek. This
certainly is a most beautiful and picturesque spot; the creek
really is one of the sources of the Finke, and is fringed on both
banks with large and splendidly-grown gums: it winds round the
base of Mount Sonder, and flows southerly for four miles, when it
joins the Davenport creek. Leaving Fred in charge of the camels,
Billy and I made the ascent of the mountain; it was a moderately
cool day, but it took us three hours climbing to reach its
summit. Mount Sonder appears to have three separate peaks, the
most easterly one looks to be almost inaccessible; upon the most
southerly one of the three I built a small cairn of stones, and
took the following bearings:&mdash;Mount Razorback bears 292&deg;
30', Mount Zeil 314&deg;; the most westerly high point of a
range, which is locally called Haast's Bluff, bears 286&deg; 30'.
By aneroid measurement this point is 2,495ft. above Glen Helen
station. The return journey was made in much better time, but we
got a very severe shaking, so rough indeed that the jolting broke
the minute hand of my watch; it was after dark before we reached
Glen Helen station. Saw a couple of emus to day.</p>
<p><i>Friday, April</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.715in., ther.
68&deg;.&mdash;Was too much done up to-day to do anything but
camp duties. Worked out my observations of yesterday. Tested
several mineral specimens that were collected, without any
results. Got the photographic apparatus unpacked and ready.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, April</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen. Bar.
27.500in., ther. 74.&mdash;Steady rain set in at daylight. Went
up to the station hoping to do some writing, but the rain drips
through the thatched roof to such an extent that it is almost as
bad as being outside. While at the Alice Springs I heard of the
discovery of silver ores in this neighborhood, and was anxious to
see them; but I never saw any one who had any specimens, nor
could I find out who had made the discovery. When I was at Mount
Sender I saw where a little work had been done, but could find no
trace in any specimens that I brought from there. Mr. Mac Donald,
the manager, gave me several specimens this morning, but not in
any one of them could I find traces of anything but iron.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, April</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen. Bar.
27.810in., ther. 72&deg;.&mdash;Took several photographs of
natives&mdash;men, women, and children. Two women and one man
were blind. Mr. MacDonald took Beetson for a ride to Mount
Sonder. Fine day, high easterly wind. Mr. MacDonald sent letters
away by a blackfellow, to meet the mail at the Mission
Station.</p>
<p><i>Monday, April</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Glen Helen. Bar.
27.820in., ther. 62&deg;:&mdash;Not altogether satisfied with my
short visit to Mount Sonder, I decided to visit the spot again,
and to spend a few days there prospecting. Started soon after
midday, and travelled down the Davenport creek for four or five
miles, almost to its junction with the Redbank. Then striking a
little northerly across some bald stony hills we reached the foot
of Mount Sonder, where we camped amidst the most charming and
romantic mountain scenery. As soon as the camels were unloaded, I
went with Fred, to the mine or silver workings. I found they had
followed the underlay of a reef of clay slate for 18ft., going
through an ironstone crust on the surface, under which were
various colored clays, all charged with iron. A gypsous earth
seems also to have been met with. Some of the small ironstone
knolls in this neighborhood have quite a purple appearance. Upon
close inspection they are found to be a decomposed shale stained
on the surface with iron. Others present quite a charred and
blacked look, having all the appearance of manganese, for which I
at first took it. In describing the rock formation of this part
of the MacDonnell Range, I should say that the main ranges are
composed of sandstone and quartzite. The lower hills at their
foot, and towards the alluvial flats, through which the creeks
flow, are composed of clay slates and shale with occasional hills
of ironstone.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, April</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 11. Bar.
27.975in., ther. 40&deg;.&mdash;All of us out prospecting.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 11. Bar.
28.975in., ther. 46&deg;.&mdash;Prospecting all day, and
observing for latitude till midnight, which I made 23&deg; 35'.
Billy brought in some beautiful specimens of iridescent ores of
iron; seen in the sunlight they are very brilliant.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 10, Mount
Sonder. S. latitude 23&deg; 35' 46"&mdash;Interviewing the most
intelligent natives I ascertained the native names of the
principal local geographical features to be:&mdash;Mount Sonder,
Oorichipima; Mount Razorback, Ooratunda; Mount Giles,
Um-bat-thera; Davenport Creek, Indianana; Haast's Bluff Range,
Nyurla; Mount Zeil, Willatrika; Mount Crawford, Mareena; creek
under Mount Sonder, Oorachilpilla. Oora means fire, and it is
somewhat singular that Mounts Sonder and Razorback and the creek
at the foot of Mount Sonder should all commence with this
word.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, April</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 11. Bar.
27.910in., ther. 55&deg;.&mdash;I went up the creek this morning
with the camera, and took some photographs of this wild romantic
spot. A walk of a little over a mile took us nearly to the head
of the gorge. Beautifully clear water was running over the pebbly
bed of the creek. As we approached the gorge the hills upon each
side formed into perpendicular cliffs, and the creek channel
became a chaotic mass of boulders, around and under which the
water found its way. A little further, and the cliffs upon each
side met, and all further progress was stopped by a large deep
pool of water, with perpendicular cliffs, several hundred feet
high, upon either side; there is a strange fissure in the wall,
if I may so describe the mighty cleft in the range; it is the
opposite side of the pool, and, of course, quite unapproachable,
and it is down this cleft that the water comes from its unknown
source, fills the pool, which, always overflowing, runs down the
creek for a mile or more. There is a strange wild beauty about
this place, which tempts one to remain and admire its lovely
wonders. Several cranes were hovering about, and these had
brought to the bank a fish from the water, and were discussing it
when disturbed by our approach. It was much larger than any I
have seen at these inland waters, and must have been nearly 2lbs.
in weight. Returning to camp, I went with Mr. MacDonald six or
seven miles in a south westerly direction to examine the country
there, but found no indication whatever of mineral deposit.</p>
<p><i>Friday, April</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started away from this
camp for Glen Helen. A gumtree branded T/89 marks the spot where
we camped, I kept further westward and under the main range. Left
the stony hills and porcupine grass in about two and a half
miles, and soon after crossing a gum creek had trial holes put
down, intending to pan off the stuff from the bottom. Camped at
Glen Helen.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, April</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.600in.,
ther. 60&deg;.&mdash;Beetson and Fred were sent down to the trial
holes. Washed several dishes of dirt without any results. Bar.
27.650, ther. 90&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, April</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.600in., ther.
70&deg; at 6 a.m.&mdash;Sultry, with high warm east wind,
changing to north from midday. Bar. 27.525in., ther. 86&deg; at 3
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, April</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 10, Glen
Helen Station. Bar. 27.600in., ther. 66&deg;.&mdash;Cloudy with
light north wind, heavy showers of rain fell during the night and
kept up till sunrise. I hoped to have made a start to day but the
uncertain weather and everything being thoroughly wet, I decided
to postpone it till to-morrow. I should have much liked to stay a
fortnight prospecting in this neighborhood, but T have received
so little encouragement that, perhaps, the interests of the
Association are best served by moving on; at any rate, it is with
these views that I decide to do so. Bar. 27.500in., ther. 80&deg;
at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, April</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 12. Bar.
27.580in., ther. 56&deg; at dawn.&mdash;Very heavy dew during the
night, but a most lovely morning. Our arrangements all completed,
we packed up and started. Mr. MacDonald kindly gave me all the
fat of a bullock that he killed last night. Many and various have
been the attentions that we have received from this kind-hearted
gentleman during our stay near his homestead, among others was a
liberal supply of fresh milk sent down to our camp every morning,
besides which, upon hearing that my watch was broken, he very
generously lent me his for the journey. It will be understood
that a timekeeper is a most important item in the outfit of such
a party; observation for position would be almost impossible
without one. Started away upon a bearing of S. 82&deg; W.,
following the tracks of some cattle that Mr. MacDonald was
sending out to the Arumbara Creek; kept upon this bearing for
twelve miles and then turned N. 60&deg; W. for six miles, when we
arrived at the cattle yards and camped with Mr. MacDonald and the
men. Travelled eighteen miles, principally through mulga scrub.
Bar. 27.625 in., ther. 78&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 13. Bar.
27.745in, ther. 46&deg;.&mdash;Mr. MacDonald decided to travel
with us for the first day, and he had with him a native boy who
knew of a pass that would take us through the wall-like range
that lay to the southward, and which looked as formidable as that
which we followed for so many days to the northward. Started away
at 1 a.m. on a bearing of N. 75&deg; W. for four miles, this took
us down the Arumbara Creek, which at this point took a turn to
the northward towards the range that is called Haast's Bluff, the
outline of this range is most striking, being a series of
irregular peaks; the native name for it is Nyurla, it is of the
most singular form. I cannot see how it can be identical with the
Haast's Bluff of Giles, for there is certainly nothing of that
kind to be seen. I then turned upon a bearing of S. 75&deg; W.
for three miles, this took us over low stony hills covered with
spinifex, and to take advantage of a favorable spot to get
through a line of hills that lay upon our course I turned south
for ten miles: we were again face to face with a wall-like range.
I decided to waste no time in searching for a pass so turned S.
70&deg; W., we were now in a stony valley with a bold bluff range
of over 1,000 feet immediately south of us. Mr. MacDonald's
blackboy was now further in this direction than he had ever been
before, and did not like the idea of going any further. From him
I learn that this bluff is called by them Mareena, at its N.E.
end is a spring called Enditta, but as this is in an inaccessible
spot I did not waste time in visiting it. Camped at the foot of
the bluff, travelled six miles upon the last bearing. Travelled
fifteen miles rough, stony, hilly ground, covered with spinifex
the whole way, with trees of bloodwood, mulga, and gum; magpies
and crows seen this morning. Bar. 27.510in., ther. 82&deg; at 3
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, April</i> 18<i>th</i>&mdash;Camp No. 14, Mareena
Creek. Bar. 27.560in., ther. 65&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;I omitted
to mention that a small rock hole, containing a little water, was
found near this camp. Mr. MacDonald, with some difficulty,
managed to get his horses up to it. Mareena Bluff is quite
inaccessible from this side, but I should think a splendid view
would be obtained from the top. While the camels were being
brought up I ascended a lower line of hills that lay to the
northward, from here I observed Mount Sonder N. 87&deg; E.,
distant about 35 miles. Mount Razorback N. 76&deg; E., Mount Zeil
is hidden behind some hills close by. The rock formation of these
hills is sandstone and quartzite. Collected rock specimens 21 and
22, started at 9, continued up the valley upon a bearing of S.
70&deg; W. for five miles. Seeing a small water channel between
my position and the bluff, I went to examine it and soon found
that water would flow to the southward, so that we were now on
the southern slope of the MacDonnell Ranges, and I hoped that
nothing new would impede my progress to the westward. Turned S.
17&deg; W. for two miles to avoid some rough hills, and then
followed down the Gum Creek south for about 3 miles and camped.
My position now, if I am right, is on the Missionary Plain, and
this is Rudall's Creek of Giles. The last three miles has been
over very well grassed country, open, with occasional clumps of
mulga and colalya gums. Several red kangaroos were observed, but
Billy was not successful with his rifle. This has been a very
short stage, but the stones had crippled two of the best camels,
so I camped early for their benefit. Mr. MacDonald returned to
Glen Helen at midday. Bar. 27.570in., ther. 85&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, April</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 15, S. lat.
23&deg; 41' 25", Bar. 27.600in., ther. 42&deg; at
sunrise.&mdash;By observation I found the latitude of this camp
to be 23&deg; 41' 58". Started upon a bearing of S. 82&deg; W. at
8.40, travelled over well grassed mulga flats till 11, when we
entered into porcupine sandhills rising towards low dark scrubby
hills, which I take to be the Gardiner Range of Giles; these lay
across our course and were met with at 1 p.m. The sandhill and
porcupine then gave way to mulga scrub, which, not being
specially dense, was a pleasant relief from the spinifex
sandhills; this only continued for five miles when we were again
in sandhills with spinifex, two little hills with pines on them
being right on our course. Camped at 5 p.m. in oak sandhills and
spinifex, there was not anything for the camels to eat, so at 7
p.m. they were tied up for the night. Travelled twenty miles. A
few kurrajong and ironwood trees met with, no animals or birds
seen. Bar. 27.675in., ther. 34&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, April</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 16. Bar.
27.680in., ther. 41&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;Latitude 23&deg; 43'
43". The camels were let loose a little before dawn, and they
made such use of their time in travelling that they have made it
a lesson for me to keep a closer watch on them in the future.
Started at 9, continued on yesterday's bearing for five miles
when we reached the little hill seen yesterday. I found it to be
an isolated knoll of sandstone about 300ft. above the level of
the surrounding country, and hemmed in upon all sides by spinifex
sand hills; not a blade of grass anywhere. I left the camels to
make their way round its eastern base while Billy and I made the
ascent; its irregular surface is covered with dwarf pines, and
among the interstices of the rocks numerous rock wallabies were
seen. The view to the west and south-west was one apparently of
spinifex sandhills; to the N. and N.W. the southern slopes of
MacDonnell Range extended for many miles. The country seemed so
dry that I deemed it advisable to give the camels a drink before
starting for Glen Edith, and with that view I turned N. 5&deg; E.
towards the main range where I did not anticipate any difficulty
in obtaining a sufficiency for one night. For five miles we
continued upon this bearing when we crossed a gum. creek which
had a westerly course; two miles from here it became so stony
that I sent Billy on ahead to look at the gorge that I had been
steering for, not thinking favorably of it from this spot. I now
turned S. 45&deg; E. to get away from the stony slopes of the
range into the valley, through which I thought the gum creek
would flow; this we reached in four miles much to the relief of
ourselves and the camels, for the stony ground and the very dense
mulga scrub of the last few miles were tedious and tiring to the
last degree, there was very good feed for the camels but no
water. I think this must be Carmichael's Creek of Giles, if so,
the sandstone hill seen this morning would be Mount Solitary.
Just before dusk Billy returned with the intelligence that a
large rock hole in the gorge that he visited had just gone dry.
The trees met with to-day were mulga, mallee, banksias, and
various leguminos&aelig; and an occasional kurrajong tree. Bar.
27.700in., ther. 88&deg; at 3 p.m. Camped at 5.30.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, April</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 17,
Carmichael's Creek. Bar. 27.750in, ther. 51&deg;.&mdash;A keen
easterly wind blowing, but mild during the night; heard a few
crows this morning, I trust it may be a sign of water being near,
for I do not like the idea of doing any more easting. The camels
were let go a little before dawn and spent the time more to their
own advantage than yesterday. Started at 8.35 on a general
bearing of N. 66&deg; E., but in these dense scrubs and the
continued turnings off to examine different gorges for water it
is impossible to follow an exact course, but I may explain that I
am following the slopes of the MacDonnell Range easterly to find
the gorge where this creek rises; examined many places during the
day, in some water was found high up in ledges of rocks quite
unapproachable for camels, but which are of course available for
natives and birds; continued upon this bearing for five miles and
then turned east for three miles; from this point I turned N.
10&deg; W. for two miles to examine a favorable looking spot, but
without success. I now turned S. 60&deg; E. for three miles to
get the camels off the stones; the mulga scrubs upon this course
were very dense, and caused incessant delays, and hoping to free
myself from them, I turned S. 70&deg; E. for one and a half miles
and again emerged upon the alluvial flats through which the creek
flows. Here we found abundance of feed for the camels near the
gum creek, upon which we camped. These mulga flats are
intersected by small gum creeks, and are park-like and very
attractive to the eye, and in a rainy season, with water
everywhere, and abundance of rich green herbage, which is
withered and black to-day, I can imagine a traveller dwelling
with pleasure upon such a charming spot, and almost pardon any
vagaries of his pen in describing its richness and beauty, which
are, however, of a very transient character. Bar. 27.580 in.,
ther. 72&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, April</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 18. Bar.
27.575in., ther. at dawn 39&deg;.&mdash;The valley between the
MacDonnell Range and what I take to be the Gardiner Range at this
point cannot exceed nine or ten miles, and a few miles further
west it is still less. Started up the creek at 8.15, N. 20&deg;
E., and very soon left our last night's beautiful surroundings,
and plunged into a region of mulga scrub and stones towards the
foot of the main range again. This continued for two miles,
thence N. 25&deg; W. two miles up a stony watercourse with scrub,
stones, and spinifex everywhere, N. 40&deg; W. to a gorge which
was a disappointment. From here turned S. 20&deg; W. one mile to
a gum creek which seemed to emerge from the range at a promising
place. Turned N. 10&deg; E. to enter the glen. We had no sooner
done so than two emus were observed stalking down the glen, this
looked hopeful, for if water was accessible to them it would be
to us. Billy went on ahead on foot and soon called out "Water!
all right!" It was 11 a.m. when we struck the water, and the
seventh day since the camels had any, and they drank greedily.
This water does not lay any claim to permanence, in fact it is
only a tiny pool from last December rains, the ground is very
stony and the hills on either side are covered with spinifex. A
few bean trees and gums are the only timber, the only attraction
the place has is the little pool of beautiful water. Variation of
compass, 2&deg; 27' E. Bar. 27.260in., ther. 84&deg; at 3
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, April</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 18, Glen
Farewell. Bar. 27.290in., ther. 52&deg;; S. latitude 23&deg; 37'
24".&mdash;Bright fine morning. The camels were not brought up
till nearly mid-day. I suppose they wandered away to be off the
stones, let them have the rest of the day to themselves. Went up
the gorge to see if any more waters existed, was away some hours
and returned to camp not having seen a drop, except where the
camp is. The rock formation of this part of the MacDonnell Range
is quartzite and sandstone. Collected rock specimens, 26, 28, 29.
Botanical specimens were collected. With the hope that this will
be the last appeal that I shall make to the MacDonnell Range, I
call this Glen Farewell. In ail probability it will not be
visited again, but should any future traveller pass by it will be
recognised as being a wide glen of easy access, about two miles
from its entrance to its head; about half way is a gum tree
marked T/89 on the N. side which is near the waterhole. I had the
casks filled up with this most beautiful water and have all in
readiness for the next water, whenever it may happen to be.
Weather fine. Bar. 27.310in., ther. 98&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 19. Bar.
27.400in., ther. 51&deg;.&mdash;Fine, still, clear, no dew.
Watered the camels at mid-day, and because they were wanted to
drink, very few would do so. Started at 2.25 intending only to be
clear of the stones and scrub so as to have a clear course for
Glen Edith to-morrow. Upon leaving the glen the creek splits into
two small chanels; taking the most westerly, I started upon a
bearing of S. 20&deg; E. for five miles: at this point the creek
has forced its way between two low hills that would not be
readily seen above the surrounding scrubs of mulga, from here I
took up a bearing of S. 55&deg; W. for two miles, when being
clear of stones and scrub I camped. To the eastward of Glen
Farewell there seems to be a wide gap in the MacDonnell Range, or
it may be that the range turns to the northwards. On the east
side of this apparent gap are three or four bluffs or
escarpments, of which Mareena Bluff is the most easterly. Bar.
27.755in., ther. 88&deg; at 5.30.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, April</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 20. Bar.
27.775in., ther. 44&deg; at 6 a.m.&mdash;Started at 8.20 on a
bearing of S. 80&deg; W., to keep midway between the MacDonnell
and Gardiner Ranges, in one mile struck a small gum creek flowing
south, in four miles a much larger one with a sandy bed and a
well defined channel flowing westerly&mdash;this must be
Carmichael's Creek; there is no doubt the source of this creek is
in the Gardiner Range, and those following southerly from the
MacDonnell Range flow into it. I should have liked to follow this
creek to its source, for I think good water will be found there.
In seven miles from our camp we were face to face with spinifex
and oak sandhills, so leaving the valley of Carmichael's Creek I
took up a bearing of S. 67&deg; W. for Glen Edith, and in seven
miles reached the foot of Mt. Solitary. Collected rock specimen
No. 31. Travelled over spinifex and oak sandhills "with broad
valleys, in which were clumps of mulga and kangaroo grass. Camped
at 5 p.m., having found a fairly good feeding patch for the
camels. Travelled twenty-one miles. Bar. 27.875in., ther. 75&deg;
at 5 p.m.</p>

latitude 23&deg; 47' 17". Bar. 27.900in., ther. 61&deg; at
dawn.&mdash;Cloudy all night. A considerable amount of moisture
in the atmosphere this morning. Started at 9 a.m. on the same
bearing as yesterday, S. 67&deg; W. for six miles, continued in
undulating oak and spinifex country, the sandhills, then became
closer and mallee and mulga took the place of the oak timber. At
this point a peaked hill, which I take to be Mount Peculiar,
bears N. 8&deg; E. distant about thirty-five miles. Turned S.
80&deg; W. to avoid a sandstone ridge, kept on this bearing for
three miles and then turned on a bearing of S. 48&deg; E.,
continued along the foot of sandstone ridge for three miles, and
then turned N. 10&deg; E. for one mile and camped on spinifex
sandhills with oaks. I think I am now in the neighborhood of Glen
Edith, for Mr. Gosse in his diary mentions a sandstone cliff such
as I met with before turning on the last bearing. Bar. 27.750in.,
ther. 78&deg; at 6 p.m. No birds or animals seen to-day.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, April</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 21; S.
latitude 23&deg; 48' 25". Bar. 27.825in., ther. 62&deg;.&mdash;I
was awakened at dawn by the sound of heavy thunder to the
westward. Called all hands to get saddles and boxes together for
the rain was commencing; had everything snug and breakfast over
when the rain set in so steadily that I decided to remain for the
day and had the tent put up; it rained steadily until midday.
Fred Warman and Billy started off on foot to look for Glen Edith
and later in the day I went out on a camel to try and find it;
noticed a number of native tracks going south-westerly, and shall
follow them up to-morrow. Unfortunately, I have not got Mr.
Giles' journal, otherwise I should find it easily enough, for I
feel sure I am not a great distance away from it. Noticed a few
swamp hawks hovering over the camp, but which flew off to the
eastward.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, April</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 22. Bar.
27.725in., ther. 62&deg; at dawn&mdash;Slight east wind, clear
and fine. Started at 9 a.m. on a bearing of S. 40&deg; E. to
intersect the black's tracks seen yesterday. After travelling one
mile turned upon the tracks S. 15&deg; W.; at two miles sandstone
hills, about which we rambled in endeavoring to find the tracks,
turned east as Billy had evidently lost the tracks among the
stones; in three miles reached the sandstone cliff spoken of by
Mr. Gosse in his diary, but I imagine this must be quite its
eastern extremity. A few specimens of a species of mulga that is
rarely met with were growing here, their straight, elegant, and
slender tapering stems twenty feet high, with light
horizontal-lying limbs, like a Norfolk Island pine, presenting a
very beautiful appearance; the singular oak and spinifex
undulations here set in and continued for five miles. The rest of
the day was spent in working a passage through dense mulga scrub
and porcupine sandhills, trending N. and S. Camped at 5 p.m.,
having travelled twenty-one miles. At this point the Gardiner
Range is distant six miles to the N.W., and it is quite evident
that I have missed Glen Edith and the probabilities are that we
were close to it the night we were overtaken by the rain. Bar.
27.575in., ther. 74&deg; at 5 p.m. No birds or animals seen
to-day.</p>
<p><i>Monday, April</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 23, Glen
Edith. Bar. 27.580in., ther. 62&deg; at dawn.&mdash;Started at 8,
returning upon my tracks to the point where the unusual mulga
trees were seen, which is the eastern extremity of the cliff
spoken of by Mr. Gosse; kept along the foot of this for six miles
when Billy left us to reconnoitre, he soon came back from the
southwards telling us that he had found it, but that there was
not much water. Turning down a small watercourse that ran to the
southwards among low sandstone hills we arrived at Glen Edith,
but not until Billy had taken me right Tip to the "Tarn" could I
see any spot likely to hold water. Everything here is in
miniature&mdash;the hills, the creek, the Glen, and I am sorry to
say the water; at present it is eighteen inches deep, five yards
wide, and twenty yards long; and by the time twelve camels have
had one drink, not much will remain. The weather is moderately
cool and after the first drink they may not come for more for a
day or two, but it is evident more will soon be required. The
camels were unloaded at a spot where traces of an old fireplace
were observed, and where were several marked trees. It took a
long time to water the camels only two being able to water at one
time, the waterhole or tarn being pinched up between two large
masses of rock, leaving only one end available for watering at.
Round about this very pretty little spot are a number of white
gum trees, the largest may be three feet in diameter, while on
the rocks are dwarf pines. I looked about for a long time before
I could find a tree that would be likely to be marked by Mr.
Gosse, for I knew that he used rather large characters, but Fred
found one which showed a long narrow strip of exposed and
blackened wood, by very carefully chipping upon the new bark,
which showed a faint line where the bark had been taken off when
the tree was first marked, and by exercising the greatest care
the overgrowth of wood and bark was removed upon each side
leaving the tree branded and fully exposed as upon the day it was
done. The tree marked by Mr. Giles, <i>Glen Edith</i>, with date,
was so grown over and rotted away that the overgrowth came away
in small fragments; the tree branded CARMICHAEL showed the whole
name with the exception of the two first and last letters. Mr.
Chewings' tree marked in 1886 was, of course, quite complete, no
overgrowth worth mentioning having taken place. A small tree
marked by Mr. Gosse with a broad arrow was so overgrown that only
the shaft of the arrow remained. Of any seeds of plants that may
have been sown by former travellers in this fertile spot no
traces are to be found now, nor in the many places that I have
visited after former travellers have I ever found any traces or
evidence of the seeds having germinated. I can only reiterate my
regret that I had no seeds of trees or dates to experiment with
here. Camped at 2.20 p.m. Since noon the weather has been sultry
and oppressive with every indication of a change. Bar. 27.680in.,
ther. 89&deg; at 3 p.m. An observation made this evening gives me
S. lat. 23&deg; 49' 36".</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, April</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 23, Glen
Edith. Bar. 27.700in., ther. 66&deg;.&mdash;Cloudy with light
easterly wind. Writing up journal, plotting, and engaged in many
camp duties; took some photographs in the afternoon. Many of the
camels have very bad backs, and others have to be attended
to.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.660in., ther.
66&deg;.&mdash;The sun came out in good force at noon, placing
the mercury up to 90&deg; in the shade. The camels drank a great
deal, and seriously reduced the water supply. Took several views
with the camera.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.660in., ther.
74&deg;.&mdash;Light N.E. wind. The night was close and
oppressive, and rain seemed inevitable, but the morning broke
clear and warm; thermometer in the dense shade of a pine-tree
went up to 94&deg;. I shall leave the main camp here and start
away to-morrow with Billy and three fast camels to make a flying
trip to the S.W. with the hope of finding another place to bring
the party to. I expect to be away eight or nine days, and in that
time I hope that the camels which have sore backs may be
improved.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.600in., ther.
64&deg;. -A light shower at 11 o'clock last night called us all
out to cover up. It lasted only a few minutes, and the morning
broke bright, clear, and cloudless, with a N.E. wind. Started
with Billy and three fast camels at 8.30, taking ten days'
provisions. Travelled over oak and spinifex sandhills, and at 5
p.m. reached the foot of Sandstone Kange, that is easily seen
from Glen Edith; course, S. 68&deg; W., distance twenty miles.
The sandhills passed to-day ran nearly east and west until we
approached these hills, they then became irregular and much
higher, and continued right up to the foot of the range, which
present an abrupt escarpment towards the north. All the afternoon
heavy clouds had been accumulating, and at sundown it was gloomy
and threatening, so much so that I put up my small tent that I
fortunately brought with me. I was preparing for bed when a few
drops fell, and the night was as dark as pitch. For an hour after
this it was most oppressively close and still, steady rain then
set in. About midnight I sent Billy (the black-tracker), who was
my only companion, to bring in the saddles. Returning in the
darkness he stumbled against the tent prop, and down it came.
Billy was very prompt in replacing the prop, but I was in an
unenviable position for a little while. The small tent, meant
only for one, had now to cover Billy, myself, and the three camel
saddles. I woke at intervals to hear the rain pouring steadily
down.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.625in., ther.
61&deg;.&mdash;At daybreak I was up, but not out, for it was
pouring hard. Owing to the mishap of last night the tent was
leaking in several places. Billy started a fire, and during a
temporary lull we managed to get our breakfast, but we were
prisoners in the tent the whole day, owing to the incessant
rain.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.660in., ther.
64&deg;.&mdash;I deem myself the most fortunate of travellers to
have heard the sounds of running water in such a country as this.
At daylight' this morning water could be heard running from the
hills and gorges, discharging streams of beautiful clear water
into the thirsty sands. The only reading that I have is Mr.
Gosse's diary, and if it rains much longer I shall know it off by
heart. Steady rain fell uninterruptedly the whole day; the camp
could not have been pitched in a better place for such an
occasion; upon the lee side of a high sandhill, abundance of
firewood ten yards in front, and running water in every
direction.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.600in., ther.
57&deg;.&mdash;Raining all last night, and a close prisoner in
the tent all this day from the same cause; the rain was driven
before a gale of wind from the N.E. last night, which made it
intensely cold; fire beaten out by rain.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.600in., ther.
64&deg;.&mdash;The rain could, not have been so heavy and
incessant last night, for at dawn this morning, though it was
still raining, there were a few live embers m the fire heap;
these were soon worked into a brisk fire. The rain ceased at 7
a.m., but then came a fog or mist, so dense that nothing could be
seen till 10. At noon I went out with the camels for a short
journey round the foot of the hills, half a mile from the camp;
came to a strong stream of water in a mulga channel; followed it
down one and a half miles, when it was quite lost in the
sandhills. I thought it strange, that after all this rain, the
ground was nowhere in the least soft, showing, I imagine, that
there must be a considerable depth of sand. Keeping along the
foot of the range in a N.W. direction I ascended a hill, hoping
to get a view to the south-west; but higher hills lay in that
direction, which time would not allow me to visit; returned to
camp by a slightly different road at 6 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.622in., ther.
59&deg;.&mdash;Started away from the camp, where I have so
unexpectedly been kept a prisoner for four days and five nights
by incessant rain; took up a bearing of N. 76&deg; E. I am not
very sure that this bearing was adhered to, for Billy mounted
upon a very fast camel went ahead, and as both knew exactly where
they were going, I was more than employed in keeping up to them.
Arrived at Glen Edith at 2.30. Up till eleven o'clock we had been
travelling in a dense fog, but this cleared up, and the rest of
the day was bright and fine. I found upon my arrival that the
waterhole has been quite filled, though strange to say the creek
had not run: all our belongings were out on the rocks drying. No
damage worth mentioning had been caused by the wet, although the
canvas tarpaulin had been found to be next to useless; so my
companions sought shelter under the large overhanging rock at the
back of the waterhole, under which they were perfectly dry during
the whole of the rain.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 27.650in., ther.
58&deg;.&mdash;A very bright clear morning; making preparations
to start away to-morrow; took observations for latitude,
variation, and time.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 24, Bar.
27.550in., ther. 66&deg;.&mdash;Light showers until 10 a.m.;
weighed up and arranged packs: camels did not turn up till late;
started at 12.30 on a bearing S. 84&deg; W. Travelled over
spinifex and oak sandhills till 5.30; during the afternoon there
was very heavy thunder with most vivid lightning, and the sunset
was very grand; the setting; sun tinged the huge thunder clouds
with many shades of bronze and gold; upper currents of air
twisted these enormous volumes of cloud into many fantastic and
swiftly-changing forms and varying tints. We were sitting down to
our evening meal when the rain came down m torrents, the supper
was abandoned and all the tinware in a few minutes was full of
water; it lasted only half an hour but everything was soaked; the
ground and our blankets were soaked, and the fire beaten out.
Travelled fifteen miles through desert oak, mallee, and
mulga.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 25. Bar.
27.780in., ther. 66&deg;.&mdash;A heavy rain squall turned me out
at 2.30 this morning; dawn broke at last threatening and gloomy;
the camels rambled away, and when brought up, three of them were
found to be suffering from the effects of some poisonous plant,
the symptons being a trembling of the limbs, frothing at the
mouth, falling down, and inability to chew the cud; the usual
remedies were applied, in two cases effectually, so we saddled at
10; it soon became evident that the third one would cause serious
delay, so left it behind with a man to bring it along as it was
able. Travelled upon the same bearing as yesterday, viz., S.
84&deg; W. for two miles, when I decided to turn towards the
hills, where I had been overtaken by the rain; here I knew there
would be water, and hoped that a days rest would recruit the
camels. Turned S. 35&deg; W. towards a creek that was running
when I was there last week; reached this in five miles; camped at
1 p.m. The sick camel arrived later in the afternoon; put
everything out to dry. It has been quite a summer's day, the
ther. 89&deg; in the shade Fred went down to look at the camels
at dark, he found them still trembling and quite unable to stand.
I think the best remedy is to keep them moving. These hills have
been named Watson's Range. Bar. 27.631 in., ther. 84&deg; at 3
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 26. Bar. 27.775
in., ther. 59&deg;.&mdash;I was turned out by a smart shower at 3
o'clock this morning, but it cleared away in an hour; camels were
not brought up till 9, the poisoned ones still looking very bad,
having eaten nothing during the night. Saddled them all up and
started at 10.30 N. 45&deg; W. for three and a half miles, then
turned S. 60&deg; W. one mile up the creek, then turned south
still following up the running water for two miles; this brought
us to the top of the Range. I now turned S. 64&deg; W., and in
five miles reached the southern slope of the range. I now
directed my course towards a singular looking hill seen from the
top of the Watson Range, and after travelling for eight miles
upon this bearing S. 83&deg; W., I camped for the night. The last
three miles of the day's travelling being over well-grassed open
country with occasional clumps of mulga. Secured specimens of the
poison plant. Bar. 27.800 in., ther. 70&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 27. Bar.
28.100in., ther. 44&deg;, cold south-east wind.&mdash;Started at
8.40. This camp is situated at the south-eastern end of a line of
hills running towards the N.W., and presenting a line of cliffs
to the southward. To examine a remarkable part of this range I
turned upon a bearing of N. 37&deg; W., travelled over open
spinifex sandhills for ten miles, then turned northerly for half
a mile when we came to a gum creek running south-westerly; I was
in hopes of obtaining sufficient to fill my kegs, but was very
agreeably surprised to find a stream of beautifully clear water
coming from a glen in the hills. I have never seen such
magnificent bean trees as those growing on the banks of this
creek, besides gum trees of majestic proportions luxuriating in
the richest brown loam imaginable. There were grasses, shrubs,
and undergrowth of the most vigorous growth, low pine clad
sandstone hills on either side, completing a landscape only too
seldom, met with in Central Australia. We had travelled but a
short distance it is true, but it was impossible to pass this
spot without examining it in detail, besides my ailing camels
would benefit by a day on such magnificent feed; so at the
entrance to the glen we turned them out. Travelled thirteen
miles. Collected rock specimens Nos. 38. 39, and 40. Bar.
28.000in.,* ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m. Heard some curlews in the
evening.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 27, Gill's
Creek: S. latitude 23&deg; 49' 25" E. long. 130&deg; 33'. Bar.
28.010, ther. 50&deg;, S.E. wind.&mdash;Last night was too cloudy
and overcast for observing; the poisoned camel is no better, the
animal cannot raise any cud, though repeatedly and continually
trying to do so, and eats but very sparingly; all the other
functions appear to act well, quantities of green frothy saliva
occasionally escape from the nose and mouth; this is especially
noticeable when the head is held down either ta drink or in the
act of laying down. I shall let it rest here for two days, I can
then do no more. Went up the glen with Billy ta explore its
beauties and wonders, walked for three miles up the creek, for
the last two miles we had walls of sandstone rock about 80 or 100
feet high on either side, the creek channel being about a chain
wide, running water the whole way. The creek in many places
formed into pools or rock ponds; these were two and three chains
in length and ten and twelve feet deep, and so shaded by rocks on
every side that they cannot be looked upon as otherwise than
permanent for caravan purposes. I have called this "Gill's
Creek", after Mr. Thos. Gill, of Glen Osmond, and hon. treasurer
to the S.A. branch of the Royal Geographical Society, and the
range from whence it takes its rise, the "Cleland Hills", after
Dr. W.L. Cleland, of Parkside. Making our way up the cliff we
found ourselves upon sandstone hills, and soon found another
ravine down which water was running into the main channel.
Returned to the camp well satisfied with my day's ramble.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 28.010in., ther.
39&deg;, S.E. wind, cold, and heavy dew.&mdash;By observation I
find this place to be in lat. 23&deg; 49' 25", E. long. 130&deg;
37'. Went up the east branch of the creek; found running water
for over two miles, with perpendicular walls upon either side.
The channel is obstructed with enormous boulders of rock, and
does not form into deep pools like the one we travelled up
yesterday. Altogether there is nearly twelve miles of running
water in the different channels that empty themselves into Gill's
Creek. The glen at the head of this creek I have named "Glen
Emily", after my sister. I do not think this water is always
running, but it will continue to do so for some months to come.
Billy went down the creek with his rifle, and returned with a
fine kangaroo. This materially relieves our stock of meat, which
is not so well supplied as I should like it to be. I took several
landscape views of this interesting spot, and at the entrance to
the glen marked a gum tree T/5.89 Rock specimens Nos. 41 to 47
collected.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 28. Bar.
28.055in., ther. 45&deg;.&mdash;I would have much liked to stay
another day or two amidst such beautiful surroundings, but, as
the camels had recruited and were on the way to recovery. I
decided to journey on to the westward. During my stay here I had
prospected in the creek channel for minerals and put down several
trial holes, but without success. The rock formation is sandstone
and quartzite, and, though most diligent search was made, no
trace of mineral-bearing stone was discovered. Any future
traveller that may approach this spot will, if far enough to the
south, observe a line of cliffs facing the southward; at their
westerly end one more prominent than the rest stands further to
the south; at the foot of this will be found Gill's Creek.
Started away at 9.45, steering S. 40&deg; W. for about one and a
half miles to clear the hills, then taking up a due west course
we were soon in spinifex sandhills. The Cleland Hills could be
seen stretching away in a W.N.W. direction. Between us and them I
could see what appeared to be a grass valley running parallel
with the hills. The little isolated hill that I saw from Watson's
Range is three or four miles S. 40&deg; W. of Gill's Creek, and
from this point is very plainly visible. At five miles we reached
a sandstone ridge running north and south, and an extensive view
of the country to the W. round to W.S.W. was obtained, and
appeared most unpromising&mdash;apparently nothing but a sandy
waste, by no means where good quarters or easy times might be
expected. Travelled over oak and spinifex sandhills till 5.30,
and then camped, surrounded by poison-bush on all sides. Watched
the camels the whole time they were loose, and tied them up for
the night. Travelled twenty miles. Bar. 28.290in., ther. 78&deg;
at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May</i> 17<i>th</i>.-Camp No. 29. Bar. 28.310in.,
ther. 41&deg;. Calm, fine, heavy dew.&mdash;Started at 8.40 N.
86&deg; W., glad to get away from this poison-infected spot. At
five miles the Cleland Hills were still to be seen to the
northward: at six miles a low sandstone formation was seen to the
southward; at ten miles the sandhills were not quite so
formidable. We here entered a flat piece of country, about two
miles across; a few claypans and good grass. A surface covered
with gypsous earth and spinifex then set in, which made the
travelling very heavy. Having crossed this we were again in
spinifex sandhills. For three or four miles these had been swept
by fire, and were perfectly bare. I camped in these burnt
sandhills, being so far fortunate to find a small patch with feed
on it that had escaped the fire; but the area was so small that
the camels were brought up at 8 p.m., and tied up for the night.
Travelled twenty-four miles. No animals or birds were seen
to-day.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 30. Bar.
28.125in., ther. 60&deg;.&mdash;From a high sandhill near this
camp took circumferenter readings to a low bluff at the west
extremity of the Cleland Hills, 57&deg;. A range running in a
N.W. direction, with isolated hills at their S.E. extremity,
bears 8&deg;, distant about twenty-five miles. In the centre of
this range is a high point, at least 1,000ft., which I have named
"Mount Lyell Brown". after the Government Geologist, and the
range I have called after Mr. A.T. Magarey, the hon. secretary to
the South Australian branch of the Royal Geographical Society. A
high range, distant about forty miles, I have named "Mount
Rennie", after Professor Rennie, of the Adelaide University,
bears 320&deg;. Started at 8.15 on a bearing of N. 83&deg; W. At
nine miles we came upon a limestone formation, upon which there
was a little saltbush. The hungry camels snatched greedily at
these choice morsels as they passed along. Had there been any
extent of it I should have turned them out, bvit we were soon in
dense mulga and spinifex again. It will be seen that the camels
have been tied up every night since we left Gill's Creek.
Whatever their capabilities may be of going without water, it is
quite certain they cannot do without food, and I hope to find
something for them to-morrow. Camped at 4.40, upon what looked to
be a good place for them; there was but very little for them
after all, and at dusk they were again brought up for the night.
Bar. 28.200in., ther. 76&deg; at 5 p.m. Neither birds nor animals
seen to-day. Travelled twenty-six miles.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 31; S. latitude
23&deg; 52' 36". Bar. 28.180in., ther. 64&deg;. Cloudy, dull,
close.&mdash;The appearance of the camels this morning was
pitiable, and it was evident that food must be got for them
to-day. Mount Rennie, bearing N. 4&deg; W., distant about fifteen
miles, looked too abrupt to expect to find water at. Hills to the
N.N.W. looked doubtful. Upon a bearing of S. 28&deg; E. a cluster
of bare red rocks were observed, and to these I directed the
caravan, as being the most certain place of finding what I
require. These appeared some eight or nine miles away. One of
them presented a good slope of bare red rock, and after the late
heavy rains I made sure that I should get feed and water for the
suffering animals. After travelling over mulga flats, with grass
and spinifex and dwarf mallee for nine miles, we arrived there,
spinifex and oaks growing right up to them. They appear to be
being fast covered up with sand; but no water was to be seen.
Billy seemed to think there was some; so, giving him a camel, he
started off to search, while I went on the rock to take some
bearings. Billy soon returned, telling us that he had found a
native well. Upon going to see it I found a small hole about 3ft.
deep, with spinifex growing all round it. There was not the
slightest clue to guide anyone to it; but the native's unerring
instinct or wonderful keen sight directed him straight to it. It
was evident a quantity of work would have to be done before any
camels could be watered at it; but we set to work and opened it
out, boxed it up with wood and stones, and by nightfall three of
the worst looking camels had been watered. From the tops of these
rocks I took particular notice of a noble-looking bluff, that
must be over sixty miles distant. It bears N. 54&deg; W. It has a
most inviting appearance, and I hope to find in its neighborhood
a change from the monotonous sandhill country that I have been in
since leaving the MacDonnell Ranges. Bar. 28.200in., ther.
86&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp 31, native well at
Sandstone Rocks; S. latitude 23&deg;, 52'. 36". Bar. 28.320in.,
ther. 56&deg;.&mdash;Cold south-east wind. The well filled up to
sixteen buckets during the night; these were baled out into the
tarpaulin, and more slowly drained in. From the top of the rocks
near the camp I observed a long high range bearing S. 19&deg; W.,
distant about sixty miles. Mount Rennie bears N. 10&deg; W.; it
is a flat-topped hill, about 1,000ft. above the plain, and has a
low isolated hill quite close to its N.W. extremity, while a
series of low ridges lay to the eastward of it. The little well
made sufficient water to satisfy all the camels by taking them up
three at a time; the sandhills hereabouts are covered with shrubs
and herbage, such as they like, but there is not a blade of grass
anywhere around. Black's fires were observed to the southward;
these were so close that I thought they would have called upon
us, but they kept away. Bar. 28.300in., ther. 65&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 32. Bar.
28.300in., ther. 50&deg;.&mdash;Light south-east wind. The camels
rambled away during the night, and we did not leave here till
11.15. Travelled upon our tracks to Camp No. 30, and then started
upon a bearing of N. 28&deg; W. towards some low hills, where I
hoped to form a depot; the country travelled over was of a firm
sandy nature, with sandhills running N. and S., about a quarter
of a mile apart, all thickly clothed with spinifex, occasional
oaks, and a few white gum trees were met with, but for the most
part it was destitute of timber. The tall bleached stalks of the
spinifex waving in the wind, the unbroken silence, and absence of
animal life, all contribute to make up a wild weird picture of
desolation. Travelled fifteen miles. Bar. 28.500in., ther.
66&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 33. Bar.
28.525in., ther. 38&deg;.&mdash;Started at 10 past 8 upon a
bearing of N. 25&deg; W. From this camp Mount Rennie bears N.
13&deg; E., distant about six miles; it has a bare appearance,
without any gullies or ravines down which water would fall or
accumulate. The first four miles the sandhills were steeper and
closer together; these fell away, and the country opened out into
extensive fields of spinifex, not a particle of any other
vegetation; then again occasional forests of Casuarina were met
with, but spinifex was everywhere; at 11, turned N. 26&deg; W.
for an appearent break or fault, in the rock formation. Still
travelling over fields of spinifex; these continued up to the
foot of the hills, which were reached at noon; here was a tiny
rivulet, but not a particle of feed of any kind for the camels. I
now directed the caravan along the foot of the hills for three
miles in a north-westerly direction when we entered into a broad
open valley, in which was found a strong stream of water running
to the southward; there was good feed for the camels, and while
they were unloaded I rode to the head of the valley to
reconnoitre. In the middle of this valley there is a singular
mass of rock, around the base of which is now running a stream of
beautiful water; reaching the head of the valley, I obtained an
extensive view to the north of spinifex sandhill country, with a
few low hills in the distance; to the N.W. I obtained a good view
of the high range that was first sighted at the sandstone rocks
and native well; from here it seems to be the eastern end of a
very high range that extends to the westward. I am very sanguine
of valuable and important discoveries being made there, and my
hopes are raised by visions of better grassed and more hospitable
country than that I have just passed over. It is possible that a
watercourse from that range may flow into Lake Amadeus, a problem
which I hope to solve in a few days time. The beautiful valley in
which this camp is situated I named Laura Vale, after the
daughter of my companion, David Beetson. Although there is now a
mile or more of running water, I can only express my regret that
I cannot speak positively of its permanence. There do not appear
to be any large rockholes in the gorges, which makes me feel
doubtful of its lasting through the summer. Found an emu's nest
with eight eggs, which were passably fresh. Marked tree T/5.89 at
this camp. Bar. 28.300in, ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 33, Laura
Vale. Bar. 28.300in., ther. 38&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;The camels
appeared to be doing well on the herbs and shrubs A rest was
necessary, as many of them are suffering from sore backs, and
these require careful treatment; I therefore propose to stay here
until Saturday and examine the hills, which indicate a
metamorphic formation. Tested several specimens collected, and
found no indications of metals. Bar. 28.255in., ther. 64&deg; at
3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Laura Vale. Bar.
28.275in., ther. 38&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;Had emu egg fritters
for breakfast to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Her
Most Gracious Majesty. Went up to the hills to collect further
specimens and to determine the height of the highest point, which
I found to be 281 feet above the plain. They are composed
principally of a coarse red sandstone and quartzite, chiefly in
large boulders piled in many curious and fantastic shapes, among
which there are chasms and ravines which dip into the little
creek that winds its way into the valley. Our camp is situated a
quarter of a mile from the gorge, on the edge of the little clear
stream which is only about a foot in width and the same depth.
There are no evidences of it having ever extended beyond its
present narrow limits A few bloodwood trees, some kangaroo grass,
a richer soil for a few feet on either side, together with a
fresh appearance in the shrubs alone tell of the presence of
water. It has probably been running since May 3rd, when we
experienced the fall heavy of rain at Glen Edith; its course is
southerly and it is lost in the sandhills about two miles
distant. To the eye this is a very fertile valley with open
forest and quite parklike in appearance, the waving white
spinifex appears as long rich grass, the strangely shaped hills
are covered with dwarf pines, the dark foliage of which contrasts
with the deep red color of the rocks. Horses would have but
little feed here, and since leaving Gill's Creek we have not seen
an acre of grass land. A quarter of a mile from the glen, and at
the point of a limestone rise on the creek channel, I have marked
a tree T/5.89. I hope the next traveller passing along this way
will find the water supply as good as it is now. From the highest
point of the hill I took the following bearings:&mdash;The range
to which I am steering bears 296&deg; 30'; Mount Rennie, 103&deg;
30'; a range, abrupt at each end, running east and west bears
340&deg;, distant about forty miles; another low range bears
307&deg; 45', distant twenty miles; an isolated hill about forty
miles distant, 336&deg; 30'; Mount Lyell Brown, in the Magarey
Range bears 68&deg; 30', distant about forty miles. Beetson
planted a few seeds of the date palm, and peach, melon in the
rich soil close to the running water at the camp, and as they
will be protected from the frost by the long kangaroo grass it is
possible they may survive. Mr. Ernest Giles, when at Glen Edith
many years ago planted several kinds of seeds, but no results of
his labors are to be seen there to-day. The insect kingdom so
largely represented in these regions must devour the seeds before
they germinate. I can account for the failures in no other way:
but as his were planted in October, when the young plants would
have the full force of a summer sun to contend with in their
infancy, that may be the reason of their failure. Seeds planted
after a strong heavy rain and at a more seasonable time of the
year may succeed, but I have tried planting at all seasons and at
all times with but the same disappointing result, even if one
germinates and flourishes and cast its seed, these are greedily
devoured by the myriads of ants that infest the whole interior.
Took several photographs to day. Rock specimens collected, Nos.
49 to 57. Bar. 28.210 in., ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, May</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 34. Bar.
28.250in., ther. 48&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;Started at 10 past 9
on a bearing of N. 65&deg; W., in three miles we were clear of
the hills and then entered upon extensive spinifex plains with
dwarf acacias and occasional clumps of mulga. Camped at 5.15
after travelling twenty-one miles; a few mulga bushes around the
camp were cut down for food for the camels. No sign of any animal
life met with to-day. Bar. 28.500 in., ther. 66&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, May</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 35. Bar.
28.540in., ther. 52&deg;.&mdash;Strong east wind, cloudy.
Hastened away from this wretched camp at 8.20. buoyed up with the
hope that the mountains now so close to us may be the threshold
of a more promising country. Travelled for nine miles over' the
same flat firm spinifex country, when we came to a sandhill. One
mile from this we were on stony country, where there were a few
casuarina; turning northerly for two miles reached the eastern
extremity of the range, here there was a small area covered with
bloodwood trees and very beautiful grass. I cannot tell how
frequently and how eagerly the glasses have been directed towards
this feature, each time with the hope of detecting a dark line
that would indicate the timber of a water-course; we have now
arrived at the base of the bold, abrupt, and rugged bluff,
evidently over 1,000 feet above the plain, but as yet no sign of
a creek or even a drop of water. There is the most luxuriant
green-feed for the camels, upon which they would do very well
without water for a day or two, but they required food and rest
quite as much as water, and as those requirements are to be met
with here I decided to turn them out, and while the unpacking was
being done I hurried on to reconnoitre. Travelled along the foot
of the range over very stony ground, to the south was a part of
the range and a broad valley which I could see was clothed with
spinifex. Ascending a hill I obtained a view to the westward
round to south, but no sign of any watercourse to reward my eager
gaze. Returned to the camp after a two hours ramble with feelings
of bitter disappointment; it was too late to attempt the ascent
of the main range. A few small gullies I had crossed, in which I
eagerly searched for water, expecting to find running streams,
were, with the exception of two small pools, quite dry. This
range was sighted from camp 30 and from its height, apparent
extent, and imposing appearance, I naturally anticipated it would
give birth to a series of creeks that would run into Lake
Amadeus. The question now arises, which way shall I proceed? From
my hurried view of the horizon to the west there appeared to be
no inducement to travel westward. From the summit of the range
to-morrow I anticipate a very extensive view, and shall be guided
in a great measure by what I then see. Where we are camped there
are about twenty acres of beautiful pasture land, and it seems as
if we had been guided to the only spot where any fertility
exists. Fred. Warman in his rambles amongst the rocks discovered
a little stream running for a few yards, from which we hope to
fill our kegs, so that all anxiety for water is now over.
Distance travelled to-day about twelve miles through dwarf
mallee, banksias, and acacias from four to six feet in height,
with occasional clumps of mulga and a few dwarf oaks. Bar.
28.410in., ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, May</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 35. Bar.
28.420in., ther. 51&deg;.&mdash;The morning broke cloudy and
threatening with a strong; north-easterly cold wind. At 9.20 a.m.
started to make the ascent of the mountain, taking Warman and
Billy. Weei followed from choice, and so did Warman' s little
dog. Walking for a mile over the stony slopes at the base of the
range we came to an almost precipitous ravine, which being the
only place accessible, without walking another mile or two along
the base, I decided to try this The ravine was a mass of enormous
boulders that had fallen from the cliffs many hundreds of feet
above us; two or three monsters containing some thousands of tons
each had, from their excessive weight, rolled far into the valley
below. During our ascent pines were met with, growing and
apparently thriving amidst the wreckage. Gazing up at the
precipitous and almost overhanging masses of rugged and broken
cliffs, dozens of huge pieces seemed ready at any moment to fall
and overwhelm us. Two little pools of water were met with whilst
ascending, but, if permanent, they can be of no use to anything
but birds. On reaching the top of the ravine and looking down it
appeared dangerously steep. From here a more gentle gradient led
us to the summit of the mountain, a distance of about half a
mile. Arriving at the highest point, which is at its eastern
extremity, a strange wild panorama of desolation met our view: to
the north round by west, and south-west, the distant horizon was
unrelieved by a hill or range of any kind whatever, spinifex
plains extended as far as the eye could reach. The distant
horizon was unbroken by an eminence of any kind, to the north
round by north-west spinifex plains extend in a continuous line
to what might be taken as a true horizon. The western end of a
salt lake bore 261&deg; 30', while its eastern extremity bore
226&deg; 30', with low hills on its south shore. The lake does
not appear to be of any great width, and I cannot think it to be
in any way connected with Lake Amadeus. Mount Rennie bears
114&deg; 30', a high point in an important range south bears
90&deg; 45' (I much regret that this range did not lay nearer my
course, for it is one of the most important features that has
been discovered). The rock formation seen to-day appears to be a
close, grained granite, of a pink color, and quartzite. The bold
abrupt cliff which Mount Leisler presents to the east is reddened
and rugged from exposure to the elements for untold ages. Upon
the summit and in some places forming part of the cliff are
enormous masses of conglomerate fragments of quartz and round
pebbles, all cemented together apparently from pressure. Rock
specimens, Nos. 58, 59, and 60, as well as a collection of stones
found in great numbers at the base of the mountain were secured,
from which the geologist will probably be enabled to give us some
interesting particulars. I find the latitude of this point to be
in 23&deg; 20' 09", but owing to the continued dull weather I
have been unable to observe for variation of needle. This range I
name the Kintore Range, after His Excellency Lord Kintore, our
new governor, as a lasting remembrance of the first year of his
appointment as a colonial governor. The highest point of the
range I have named Mount Leisler, in grateful remembrance of Mr.
Louis Leisler, of Glasgow, who so generously provided me with
funds in my endeavors to open up the country between Fowlers Bay
and the Musgrave Ranges. The height of Mount Leisler above the
plain is 1,462ft. A pile of stones six feet high is built upon
its highest and most easterly point, and in the grass valley at
its foot and at our camp a bloodwood tree is marked T/5.89. From
the top of Mount Leisler the Magarey Range is distinctly visible,
and north of it is a conspicuous range bearing 83&deg; 45', which
I have named the Henty Range, after Francis Henty, Esq., of
Victoria, and the highest point of that range I have named Mount
Russell, after T. Russell, Esq., of Toorak, Victoria. A high and
very imposing range appears in the dim distance upon a bearing of
41&deg; 30', the highest point of which I should say must be
fully 2,000ft., this I have called the Campbell Range, after the
Hon. Dr. Campbell, M.L.C., and chairman of the board of directors
of the association, and the very high point of that I name after
the Hon. Dr. J.A. Cockburn, M.P., Chief Secretary and Premier of
South Australia. A line of hills bearing N. 25&deg; E. and
distant about twenty miles, I have named after Mr. Ecclestone Du
Faur, of Sydney, who for very many years has endeavored to
unravel the mystery attached to the last resting place of Dr.
Leichardt; the highest point in that range T have named after
David Lindsay, Esq., F.R.G.S., the Northern Territory explorer.
The ascent of Mount Leisler occupied over two hours, though both
Warman and Weei accomplished both the ascent and descent in far
less time than I did. I notice again with surprise the presence
of swamp hawks, or bromley kites, about our camp. I have always
been under the impression that they only frequented well watered
country, I have certainly never met with them away from it. With
feelings of bitter disappointment I retraced my steps to the
camp. My wanderings through dreary and desolate regions to find
the goal of my long cherished hopes in a still more desolate
waste was a sad frustration that I had little anticipated. I
omitted to mention an important range of hills that was observed
from the summit of Mount Leisler, they bore 178&deg; and were
distant about fifteen miles; these I named the Davenport Hills,
after Sir Samuel Davenport, K.C.M.G., &amp;c., president of the
South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, May</i> 28<i>th</i>&mdash;Camp No. 35, Kintore
Range, foot of Mount Leisler. Bar 28.330in., ther. 58&deg;.
Weather cloudy and dull, with N.E. wind.&mdash;I am loth to leave
this range without making a further examination to ascertain
whether any permanent water exists here. Instead of starting
to-day as I intended, I sent Warman and Weei in a southerly
direction, whilst Billy and I proceeded to the north. We
travelled over the stony slopes of Mount Leisler; for two miles
these are covered with dense mulga scrub, which made our
travelling tedious and slow, we then emerged into an open valley
with bloodwoods and a few white gums, this raised my hopes for it
appeared like a watercourse, which it was, but perfectly dry. A
few small grass patches of an acre or two were now met with,
surrounded with spinifex. The watercourse where we left it
appeared to be trending towards the lake, but it is doubtful if
it extends so far; the probabilities are that, when its waters
flow, they are lost in the sea of sand. Leaving the dry creek we
turned easterly to examine a high range, l,200ft. above the
plain; we reached its western base in two miles, and travelled
along its northern slopes for two miles; a few little runnels
full of stones leave its almost perpendicular sides, but there is
no formation whatever for holding water; both here and at Mount
Leisler the stones are shivered by some convulsion of nature,
apparently at no very remote period, into fragments that are now
to be found at their base, the water falling percolates through
these and is lost for ever, though, doubtless, it fulfils more
important designs beneath the surface, which we cannot
comprehend. We returned to the camp at 4 p.m., having ridden all
day over most dreary and desolate country. The natives visit this
place apparently to light their signal fires, the great height
above the surrounding country being particularly favorable for
such operations&mdash;the remains of some are to be found right
on the summit of Mount Leisler. The native population must be
very small indeed, as not a vestige of a camp has been seen
anywhere. The high mountain visited to-day, which is northerly
about four miles from Mount Leisler, I named Mount Strickland,
after Sir Edward Strickland, the president of the New South Wales
Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia; it is
l,200ft. above the surrounding plain. Warman was also
unsuccessful in his search for water. We may therefore conclude
that this range is <i>absolutely waterless</i>. Our kegs have
been filled from a rain waterhole on the south side of Mount
Leisler, but the supply is not sufficient for our requirements
for a week at any time. Light rain commenced to fall on my return
to camp; put the saddles under a tarpaulin, for there is every
indication of a wet night.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, May</i> 29<i>th</i>&mdash;Camp No. 35, Kintore
Range, foot of Mount Leisler.&mdash;A steady rain fell all night,
and at daylight heavy showers fell at intervals. As there is no
appearance of the weather clearing up; there is nothing to do but
make everything as snug as possible and wait till the rain
ceases. Our tent accommodation is not of the best, but with props
and stays we endeavor to keep ourselves and provisions
dry&mdash;though by no means successful with regard to ourselves.
At nightfall the cadences of the wind, as alternately they pass
gently and mournfully by the mountain over us, and in other moods
of fury and rage they scream and roar around its rugged
weather-beaten cliffs, do not cheer us in our present situation;
and if we accept the position of the huge boulders around its
base as evidence of the fury of the storms frequenting this spot,
then the elements do not rage in vain: but we are satisfied with
the present surroundings, without wishing for ocular
demonstration of such phenomenal disturbances.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, May</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 28.075in., ther.
58&deg;.&mdash;Furious squalls of wind and heavy rain beat
against our slender shelter nearly the whole night. The
surroundings of the camp at day-light were dismal&mdash;mud and
puddles everywhere, the fire a blackened beaten-out heap of ash,
and still raining. At last a fire was made, and a pot of hot tea
having been passed round which with a warm at the fire cheered us
up a little, although there is no possibility of getting away to
day. The rain continued until 4 p.m. Mount Leisler and the hills
around have been enveloped in fog, mist, and rain for two days.
An estimate of the rainfall may be gathered from the fact that a
2lb meat tin (Conrad's), measuring 4in. diameter and 5&#8539;in.
deep, had caught 2&frac34;in. of water. Notwithstanding our well
chosen position, the rain found its way amongst our provisions,
but altogether no special damage was done. The camels have
benefited by the few days' rest upon the very luxuriant grass
flat at this camp.</p>
<p><i>Friday, May</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No 36, sandhills at
south end of low hills. Bar. 28.210in., ther. 60&deg;, bright,
fine, and clear.&mdash;Everything out drying this morning, and
upon this and other accounts we did not get away until 11.45. The
ground was very soft in many places. Started on a bearing of S.
82&deg; W., which in two miles took us clear of the surrounding
hills. At this point we found a brisk little stream running, the
result of the late rains; the water continued to run for a
quarter of a mile, and was then lost in the sands. From here we
took up a bearing of S. 80&deg; W. towards the south point of low
hills; travelled over spinifex plains for six miles, then desert
oaks and an occasional sandhill were passed. Camped at 4.45 at
the south end of stony hills, on a sandhill where there was
fairly good feed for the camels, having come about nine miles
from Mount Leisler. From this point Mount Leisler and the Kintore
Range form a noble and imposing spectacle, but instead of
offering rest and shelter to the weary traveller through these
dreary wastes, it must always be viewed as a beacon of warning,
like the lighthouse at sea which warns the mariner of points of
danger. So the only practical result of my visit to Mount Leisler
is that this mountain will fulfil a useful purpose by warning the
future traveller to avoid its dry and waterless surroundings.
Even in times of heavy rains it would be far better to try any of
the lower hills or ranges in the locality. Bar. 28.400in., ther.
64&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 37. Bar.
28.470in., ther. 44&deg;.&mdash;Morning fine and bright. The dew
was so heavy last night that everything was saturated. As the
camels were at hand, we got away at 8.15. Our waterkegs when I
left Mount Leisler, were not so full as they should have been,
and before entering into the sandhill country I was anxious to
replenish them; so with this view I started the caravan towards
the line of low stony hills that were about ten miles distant,
and bearing N. 55&deg; W. travelled over spinifex country, and
upon reaching the foot of the hills found a little running stream
that was the result of the rains that fell while while we were at
the Kintore Range. While the kegs were being filled, I went to
the top of the low range to take angles. Observed a range of
hills bearing N. 80&deg; W., distant about thirty miles. These I
named after the Minister of Education, &amp;c., the Hon. J.H.
Gordon, M.L.C. Another line of hills bearing N. 25&deg; E.,
distant about twelve miles, I named after Mr. Charles Winnecke,
F.R.G.S.. of Adelaide. The Du Faur Hills appear about thirty
miles away. I carefully and repeatedly scanned the western
horizon, but no distinctive features appeared above the oak
forests that extended in that direction. The kegs being filled I
started upon a bearing of S. 64 W. for the lake; travelled
through oak forest for eight miles, and reached the north shore.
At the point we struck the lake the eastern end was distinctly
visible, so that I think it can form no part of Lake Amadeus. The
view across the lake was much distorted by mirage. A range of
hills appeared upon its south shore, distant about thirty miles.
The lake seemed to extend indefinitely to the southwards upon
either side of this range, and the whole surface appeared to be
covered with water. The range of hills upon its south shore, and
which are distinctly seen from the Kintore range, I have named
after Mr. J L. Bonython, a member of the Council of the South
Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society. As I gazed
on this apparently extensive lake, I could not but contemplate
the fact that our party were the first and only Europeans whose
eyes had ever beheld its silent shores. Was this Lake Amadeus? If
not, to where does it extend? The mirage of the wilderness is apt
to deceive the traveller, and although I have doubts of the
eastern boundary as it now appears, I feel certain that this
forms no part of Lake Amadeus. From Camp 30 (the native well at
Sandstone Hills) I looked repeatedly in a south-west direction
without being able to detect the peculiar appearance the horizon
has when a salt expanse intervenes, and which may be best
described as a "blink" (to adopt an Arctic explorer's word) and
this would have been more particularly noticeable having a high
range on the horizon in that direction. The view of the lake,
though somewhat dreary and lifeless, formed nevertheless a pretty
landscape, or would be so to one who knew not that the water was
brine, and that it was a country abandoned by man and beast. I
was very glad indeed to notice several clay-pans full of water,
and where we struck the lake there was good saltbush, samphire,
and other salsol&aelig;. Following westerly round its shores, and
trying to make a short cut, we got into the mud, and the
floundering out was a long process. It is by far the best way,
when traversing such a lake, to go round everything, no matter
how far it looks. Spinifex and dense oaks grow to the very edge
of the lake. No track or sign of any animal life. The lake seems
a mass of channels, islands, and peninsulas. Travelled till 4.45,
and camped in a small patch of saltbush; the camels were let out
for the night. Travelled twenty-one miles on all courses, which,
after striking the lake, were N. 70&deg; W., one mile; S. 60&deg;
W., two miles; N. 20&deg; E., two miles; N. 80&deg; W., three
miles; S. 30&deg; W., one mile; N. 80&deg; W., two miles. Bar.

<p><i>Sunday, June</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 37. Bar.
28.580in., ther. 40&deg;: S. latitude 23&deg; 22' 14"; E. long.
128&deg; 27'.&mdash;This was a bright and lovely morning, the
bristling spinifex was glistening in the bright sunshine with
heavy dew drops, the strange silence of the solitude of the
desert is unbroken, not a note of a bird or even a sound to
indicate that any living thing exists here, nor any sign or trace
to show that animal life has ever visited this spot. The lake at
this point is an enormous expanse of brown mud, save here and
there some sheets of water towards the centre. As there was very
good saltbush feed here I decided to remain. Owing to the wet
weather the camels' saddles require constant altering, and many
of their backs are now in a dreadful state. My position is now in
the province of Western Australia; my immediate movements will be
guided, of course, by the distance this lake extends to the
westward, but I do not think it goes much further in that
direction, whatever it may do to the southward. I have now soon
to decide whether it be advisable to continue westward, or lo
follow round the lake, and so determine its outline to the
southward. I see no feature of interest to induce me to continue
west unless prepared for one hundred miles or more of oak forest,
spinifex, and sandhills, for I feel sure that no alteration will
take place until the watershed of the River Murchison is reached.
As a geographer, I would much like to continue on until the west
coast is reached, and so decide beyond all doubt, and for ever,
the nature of the country, but my instructions direct me to
endeavor to discover minerals and pastoral areas, and as neither
may be hoped for in the west, it is most probable that I shall
complete the circuit of this lake and then travel eastwards
towards Lake Amadeus. Bar. 28.560in., ther. 77&deg; at 3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 38; S. latitude
23&deg; 23' 13". Bar. 28.515in., ther. 40&deg; at
sunrise.&mdash;Very heavy dew, morning fine, bright, and clear.
Started at 8.35, N. 40&deg; W. for two miles, then turned N.
60&deg; W., skirting some samphire swamps which is much better
travelling for the camels. In one mile upon this bearing the
spinifex sandhills that have hitherto run down to the edge of the
lake gave way, and extensive saltbush flats appeared, upon these
were numerous clay pans near which the ground was soft and boggy
from the recent rains, the grass and herbage was green and most
luxuriant; these flats were lightly timbered with mulga and
prickly acacia. Continued on this bearing for five miles when
spinifex sandhills with oaks again set in. Not seeing anything of
the lake I turned S. 15&deg; W., and in three miles met with
samphire swamps, continued among these for two miles when further
progress was entirely stopped, for we were in a labyrinth of salt
swamps in which the camels were several times bogged, and I was
compelled to return for three miles upon my tracks; then being a
little clear of the swamps I turned S. 80&deg; W., this course
took me over open spinifex country with oaks, and in four miles
camped in a clump of oak timber; travelled fourteen miles, having
lost much time among the samphire swamps. Bar. 28.505in., ther.
68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 39, S. lat.
23&deg; 26' 47", E. long. 128' 12". Bar. 28.480in., ther.
56&deg;.&mdash;Started at 1.20 upon a bearing of S. 40&deg; W.,
but I had only gone over one sandhill when I observed that
further progress in that direction was stopped by a labyrinth of
salt lagoons. Upon the higher ground, which might be termed the
islands, I noticed the vigorous growth of casuarina or oak
timber. Some little time was lost in endeavoring to cross a salt
arm, only a few yards across, and which seemed firm under foot,
but the moment the first two camels of the caravan were on it,
down they went in the blue mud underneath. After a long struggle
they were got out, and I stood away on a bearing of N. 64&deg;
W., in about eight miles I reached a low stony rise, at the foot
of which, a broad sandy flat appeared, upon which I noticed a
number of white gum trees growing. From the top of this rise I
obtained an extensive view to the west and north-west. I noticed
a line of hills just on the eastern extremity of the Gordon
Range, which is about eight miles off. These hills were distant
about eighteen miles, their most southerly end being marked by
two distinct hills close together and higher than the rest. I
have named these the Dovers Hills, after my cousin, W. Dovers,
Esq., of Bombala, New South Wales. Upon a bearing of N. 45&deg;
W., distant about twenty-eight miles, I noticed another range,
which I named after the Hon. J.H. Angas, M.L.C., one of the
directors of the association. Upon a bearing of S. 82&deg; W., I
noticed a line of hills running north and south, the highest
point being at their northern end. I have decided to go no
farther in that direction, so prepare to turn upon a bearing that
will take me to the south-western shore of the lake. This line of
hills, the most westerly feature seen, I named the Baron Hills,
after the Baron Sir Ferd. von Mueller, K.C.M.G., F.R.S.,
President of the Victorian Branch oi the Royal Geographical
Society, whose name is justly entitled to stand forth
conspicuously at the limit of my most western travels; as the
baron has been for 20 years the most steadfast and energetic
promoter of Central Western Australian exploration. I much regret
that one of his most ardent wishes, a travelling stock route from
Central Australia to the North-West Coast, has, in this journey,
received another check; nothing would have been more gratifying
to me than to have been in a position to have given proof of this
being practicable. At 11.45 I turned upon a bearing of S. 60&deg;
W. There is a large area of burnt ground here, leading me to
infer that a good water will be found in either in the Gordon
hills or else at the lake close by. I continued upon this bearing
for about three miles, and then turned south, for it is now
evident that the extreme western end of this salt depression has
been reached; we were occasionally turned off our course half a
mile by salt reaches. At 4.30 arrived at one, near which there
was a large cane-grass clay pan, which will last a month or more
of such weather as we now experience. Here there was a profusion
of splendid feed for the camels, and as one of them is ailing I
shall stay here to-morrow. From some remark of Billy's, I think
he must have seen a spring in the early part of the day, and
to-morrow I propose to return and examine the spot. Oaks and
melaleuca were the only trees seen. Three ducks and eight cranes
were seen on the clay pan, these flew away towards the
south-west, but afterwards returned and hovered about the clay
pan. Bar. 28.560in., ther. 62&deg; at 5 p.m. The night set in
dark and threatening, so had everything packed and under cover in
case of a downpour.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 39, at Cane
Grass Claypan. Bar. 28.600in., ther. 54&deg;.&mdash;Cloudy. A few
drops of rain fell last night. Started with Billy to visit the
position spoken of yesterday, but saw no indication of a spring.
There were some very fresh-looking acacias at the spot, but no
sign of water; these trees had misled Billy. From here took up a
westerly bearing to see if any more swamps lay in that direction;
travelled till noon over heavy sandhills, with oaks and spinifex,
that further travelling in that direction with my objects was
undesirable. The country to the west appears to have formed so
decidedly into spinifex sandhills, that it would be useless my
entering into it unless prepared for one hundred miles of such
country. With feelings of regret, I now turned my steps south. My
duty and instructions told me to go no further west, and, however
much in the interests of geographical science I longed to proceed
in that direction, there was no inducement for me to risk the
attempt. Returned to the camp over the same country, which has
recently been burnt by the natives, who appear to visit this
locality while water exists in the clay-pans. Although a sharp
lookout was kept, no natives were seen. Reached the camp at 2
p.m. Bar. 28.500in., ther. 64&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 40. Bar.
28.580in., ther. 48&deg; at 6 a.m.&mdash;Weather fine and clear.
Left this camp at 8.30 on a bearing of S. 34&deg; W., for in my
rambles yesterday I could still see traces of a low-lying
samphire swamp country. Travelled over oak and spinifex sandhills
for four miles and then turned S. 15&deg; E. towards a line of
hills that were timbered in some places with pines and in others
by mulga scrub; these hills appeared to me to be either being
fast covered up with sand, or else were gradually being laid bare
of sand. I have named these after Mr. Turner, of the Adelaide
University. Upon this bearing gypsum earth mounds were met with;
oaks, ti-trees, &amp;c., and little mallee were the only trees
seen at this spot; at three miles turned on a bearing of S.
60&deg; E. towards a low stony isolated hill; travelled over some
very nicely-grassed mulga flats with many claypans in which was
plenty of water; reached the hill in four miles, from its summit
a good view was obtained, the most southerly end of the Angas
Hills about forty miles distant, on a bearing of N. 35&deg; W.;
the Gordon range, N. 10&deg; W., and the Baron range, 275&deg;,
about fifty miles distant. Continued upon the same bearing for
two miles, and then turned S. 76&deg; E.; in two miles we reached
a pretty mulga flat with rich grass and large claypans; there
were a number of native camps here the first seen since leaving
Laura Vale, giving evidence of a large native population
occasionally visiting this locality. Travelled till 4.40 p.m.
over mulga flats well grassed and with occasionally belts of
scrub; two or three very large claypans were passed, besides many
smaller ones, all containing water. It was a great relief to the
camels being for one afternoon off the spinifex, and they walked
along grandly and at night were let loose upon splendid feed,
green herbage. I observed to day a great number of ant tunnels
made of the resinous substance at the root of the spinifex; they
appear to be built for protection, either from fire or the fierce
heat of the summer sun, and are to be seen on the sandy surface
of the ground extending from one spinifex bush to another; at the
end and in the root of the spinifex is the nest; the longest
tunnel I have seen measured about twenty feet long; upon picking
up the tunnel and, of course, thereby breaking it, the busy
insects are seen hurrying to and fro, carrying their eggs, seed,
or material; even on piece of ground recently burnt, I have
noticed that the ant tunnels and nest remain uninjured. I have at
last gained the extreme western end of this salt lake formation,
and the character of the surrounding country is such that it
leads me to think it will never be again visited; but for the
claypan water, it would have taken more than double the time to
accomplish its examination, and then not without considerable
risk. It is now beyond doubt that no streams run into this lake
from the west or north-west, and the inference is that in about
one hundred miles or less to the west the sandhill formation
would gradually merge into the elevated plateau of gravelly
undulations, met with by Giles's Expedition of 1874. I now turn
my back on the west with feelings of disappointment, and as I
have some interesting problems to solve to the eastward, the time
allotted to me for being in the field will be pretty well
occupied in determining the outline of the lakes, although I
cannot but now think that Lake Amadeus will not cover anything
like the extent it is supposed to. The quondong tree was met with
to day; no animals or birds were seen. Bar. 28.575in., ther.
58&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday June</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 41. Bar.
28.600in., ther. 36&deg; at sunrise; heavy dew; weather still
cloudy.&mdash;Left camp at 3.45 a.m. on a bearing of N. 5&deg; E.
Travelled over well-grassed mulga hills; in three miles came to
some old wurlies; several claypans and good grass with saltbush
were found at this point. I now turned on a bearing of S. 75&deg;
E. expecting to meet the south shore of the lake, for from the
appearance from the spot where we first struck the lake it seemed
to be almost at the Bonython, towards the western end of which I
have been steering. Soon after leaving the natives' camp, we
entered into a dense mulga scrub, which in three miles opened out
into spinifex undulations with limestone. At mid-day, from a low
hill, I obtained a good view of the lake, its south shore, to my
great surprise, was five miles to the north of us. I immediately
changed my course to S. 20&deg; E. to reach the western end of
the Bonython Range. Arrived at these hills in about two and a
half miles, but was unable to find any good camping place, there
being no water and very poor feed for the camels. Being anxious
to fix their position and height, also to take bearings, I
decided to turn out the camels, although we had only travelled
fourteen miles. So soon as the camels were unloaded I went with
Billy to the highest point, which, by aneroid measurement, I
found to be 800 feet above the lake. An extensive view was now
obtained, Mount Leisler bearing 50&deg;, the east end of the lake
50&deg; 30', the farthest point across the lake 17&deg;, the west
end of body of the lake 351&deg;, but several reaches or arms lay
beyond low hills bearing 33&deg; 30', distant about 30 miles; the
Gordon Hills 318&deg;. From S. 20&deg; E. to S. 40&deg; W., low
hills appeared from ten to fifteen miles distant, the intervening
country being desert oak sandhills, showing many places that have
been built by the natives. The Davenport Hills bear from 69&deg;
30' to 79&deg; which is their lowest point. The rock formation of
the Bonython Hills is a limestone and calcareous rock, they run
for nearly five miles in an east and west direction and are two
miles through from north to south and appear to be perfectly
waterless; even the late heavy rains have been absorbed, as no
indications could be found of any of the little gullies having
had running water in them. Collected rock specimen 70, which
shows formation of these hills. This morning passed over a few
miles of really splendid pastoral country, grass, saltbush, and
mulga, with claypans full of water. No birds or animals seen
to-day. Occasionally saw the smoke of fires of the natives, but
no sign of the natives themselves. Bar. 28.425in., ther. 58&deg;
at 5 p.m. I should have mentioned that this range is easily seen
from Mt. Leisler, both from that point and where I first struck
the north shore of the lake it has a most attractive
appearance.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 42, S. shore
of Lake Macdonald. Bar. 28.500in., S. lat, 23&deg; 35' 52", ther.
54&deg;. Cloudy and still like rain.&mdash;Much disappointed last
night in fixing the position of the hills; clouds were heavy all
night and as this is anything but a pleasant camp we hurried away
at ten past eight on a bearing N. 35&deg; E. The south side of
the lake is only five or six miles off, and I shall camp there,
for I do not wish to leave this important feature without fixing
its position. Travelled over stony slopes covered with mulga for
two miles, then entered into a desert oak and sandhill country
which cut short the career of any little water channels that
leave the range. In six miles we reached the south shore of the
lake, here there was abundance of camel feed, and after a short
search I found a claypan which would meet all our requirements
for one day. Being a cloudy dull day, it was most favorable for
observing the outline of the lake. In a northerly direction, the
opposite shore was just visible. East and west the distance is
about the same. On a bright day this would be very much altered
by the "mirage of the desert sea", and as with me, when on its
northern shore, the Bonython Hills appeared to be an island, the
lake extending far beyond the reach of vision east and west of
the hills, so making it appear very much larger. The day was
occupied by me in mapping and posting up. Several of the camels
have very bad backs, and their saddles required attention. Saw
two swamp hawks and one crow; no animal life. The lake I estimate
to be about fifteen or eighteen miles east and west, and about
twelve miles irom north to south; of course this does not include
the miles of arms thrown out from its western side. The water in
the lake is apparently very shallow, no streams whatever run into
it. Having now satisfied myself of the insularity of this lake, I
named it Lake Macdonald, after Mr. A.C. Macdonald, the energetic
secretary of the Victorian branch of the Royal Geographical
Society of Australasia. Bar. 28.725in., ther. 62&deg; at 5 p.m.
(at level of bed of lake).</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 43. Bar
28.760in., ther. 46&deg; (at level of lake bed).&mdash;Left this
camp at 8.45 a.m. to trace the lake to its eastern limits, which,
to judge from appearances, cannot be far, but appearances here
are rather delusive. Taking up an easterly course we travelled
for four miles on its south shore, the lake here being but a
quarter of a mile in width. Here it abruptly ended, and we were
face to face with the high spinifex sandhills and forests of well
grown desert oaks. I had now travelled the three sides of the
lake, the south side having no samphire swamps or marsh land on
its boundary, whilst the eastern side appears to be bounded by
spinifex sandhills. Having arrived at the eastern extremity of
the lake I now determined to proceed in search of Lake Amadeus,
and altering my course S. 82&deg; E. I was also anxious to
determine the position of a range of hills which I had named the
Davenport Hills. The sandhills here which are high fortunately
tended in an east and west direction, so that we were able to
keep in the valleys. At about nine miles, and from the top of a
high sandhill. Mount Leisler bore N. 26&deg; E., and the north
end of the Davenport Hills N. 50&deg; E. From this point the
country opened out into spinifex plains with an occasional
sandhill, the forests of desert oak fell away into occasional
clumps, and with the exception of a few stunted acacias and
banksias the landscape was white with the long bleached straw
stems of the spinifex. This continued to the foot of the hills
which we reached in about sixteen miles from our camp on the
lake. Ascending a little hill I obtained a view to the east and
south, observing a line of low hills to the eastward I continued
on the same course to reach them. Passed over the same open
spinifex country, and camped at 4.40 p.m. amongst a few oaks and
bloodwood trees. There was but scanty feed for the camels, and at
7 o'clock they were brought up for the night. Saw the smoke of
two fires to-day but no sign of the natives. The Davenport Hills
which I visited to-day are about 500ft. above the plain, and are
a very prominent feature, being about eight miles long from east
to west. Rock specimen No. 71 collected from these hills.
Estimated distance travelled, nineteen miles. Bar. 28.525in.,
ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 44. Bar.
28.525in.. ther. 62&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;A few smart showers
fell during the night, and at daybreak blankets and everything
about the camp were saturated; saddled up and started at 8.30
a.m. From the top of a sandhill at the camp I had obtained a good
view of the hills to the eastward, and could not form a very
favorable opinion of them, and as they were considerably out of
the course I wished to take I decided to leave them unvisited.
Some low hills lay to the south, and towards them I directed the
caravan upon a bearing of S. 5&deg; E. The rain cleared off soon
after we started, but it continued cloudy all day. Passed over
open spinifex plains dotted with a few oaks and dwarf acacias. In
three miles heavy sandhills running east and west set in, which
puzzled some of the camels and retarded our progress. In six
miles from the last camp reached the west extremity of a low
sandstone ridge, where Billy found a small cleft in the rock, and
full of water. Here we replenished the kegs, which was all I
required, the hole was 5ft. deep and about 2ft. wide. Several
native camps were seen here, and the water must last these people
for a considerable time. In a cave close by were the idle or
playful drawings on a stone wall representing and signifying
nothing in particular. The vertebr&aelig; of a few snakes were
lying near the black cinders of a fire, showing upon what the
people at times look for sustenance. Turning a little to the
eastward to get through the hills we resumed our journey, and in
two miles noticed the fresh tracks of three natives going to the
westward, and soon after noticed a wurlie made to shelter two men
from the rains that probably fell when we were at Mount Leisler.
At this point I obtained a very distant view to the south and
south-west, which presented nothing whatever but high spinifex
sandhills with an occasional knoll of sandstone. Directing the
caravan to one of these which lay S. 15&deg; E., and where I
hoped we should obtain a little feed for the camels for the
night, we continued over very heavy sandhills. In about thirteen
miles I turned S. 40&deg; E. to a more inviting looking ridge,
which we reached in about sixteen miles. This was a most dreary
and inhospitable spot, huge sandhills in confused and irregular
masses tumbling right up to the foot of the cliff which must soon
be buried by them. Ascending the cliff with Billy he pointed out
to me a particular burnt patch, it was not the only one by any
means, there were dozens, but Billy seemed convinced that water
was there, and as it lay south I directed the caravan thither; in
about nineteen miles we reached a mulga hollow at the foot of,
and on the west side of sandstone knolls. Numbers of native
wurlies were soon discovered, and a grassy glade dotted over with
mulgas. Little stone runnels, now dry, intersected this pretty
little piece of woodland. Billy soon found a native well, and
after that a rock waterhole. From the number of wurlies and
encampments, this is evidently a place of frequent resort by the
natives, none were here now, and at 4.40 p.m. we tm-ned the
camels out upon pasture they love best. I find the well is
similar to the one found at Camp 31, and about five feet deep to
the water; it is now filled up with sand and is only used, I
imagine, when the rock water has dried up, and as that has such a
noble catchment area of rock sloping into it, it must be a rare
thing for the blacks to have to appeal to the well, their
requirements for water being confined to what they actually
drink, using none for either washing or cooking. This reservoir
must be viewed by them as permanent. Rock specimens No. 72
collected from the rock formation of banks south of the Davenport
Hills. Bar. 28.110in., ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 44; S.
latitude 23&deg; 53' 10". Bar. 28.150in. ther. 58&deg; at
sunrise. Dense fog this morning, which did not lift until
mid-day.&mdash;I deem the position of this spot of sufficient
importance to fix its position, and as it was too cloudy last
night, I have decided to stay here to day in the hope of a
starlight night. On a careful examination of the rock water, I
find it is about 6ft. deep. 10 yards long, and 5 yards broad, and
is situated about 200 yards southerly from the well. It is on the
top of a stony rise, with nothing to indicate its presence until
you are at its brink, sandstone rock being all round. The
peculiarity of these hills&mdash;ridges I think would be the more
descriptive word&mdash;is that they are nearly surrounded and
covered with mulga scrub. Several smaller rock holes are in the
vicinity, and at the foot of their western slope the traveller
will find some few hundred acres of excellent grass land, good
feed for horses or camels, which in this region is almost as
scarce as water. Several little channels and runnels have only
just stopped running, although it is now a fortnight or more
since the rain, showing, I imagine, that, although the upper rock
is split or broken up into confused and irregular masses, there
lies below an unbroken surface, which, dipping to the west and
receiving the rainfall from the rocks overlying them, discharges
the water into the little creeks to the westward, where the
sandhills immediately swallow it up. Directly around this
locality are small outcrops of white sandstone, the exposed
surface of which is reddened from decomposition, giving them
almost a purple appearance, which is heightened by contrast with
the sombre foliage of the mulga that grows round about them. The
pine trees usually found on sandstone banks are not found here.
The smoke of native fires were seen around, but no natives put in
an appearance. These rocks and reservoirs I have named the
"Warman Rocks", after one of my companions on this and other
journeys in the interior. Owing to the continued clouded weather
I have been unable to fix my position during the past two or
three days, but this morning took observations, and found my
latitude to be 23&deg; 53' 10". Bar. 28.100in., ther. 78&deg; at
5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 45. Bar.

appearance of rain.&mdash;These banks of sandstone rim north and
south. Mount Leisler bearing N. 10&deg; W. Started at 8.10 a.m.,
on a bearing S. 46&deg; E. In three miles sighted what I have
always called Blood's Range; this range was seen from Camp 31. It
has a bold and imposing outline from this point, with a gap or
pass at its eastern end. The western portion of the range, which
forms one side of this pass, is by far the highest peak. From
this point we lost sight of everything, and appeared to enter at
once into a low-lying tract of sandhill country, with oaks and
spinifex. It was in vain I ascended the highest sandhills that
lay near our line of march, the line of vision being intercepted
in less than a mile. We passed the whole day in forests of oak
and spinifex. The country seemed to be swept of every kind of
bush; the white stalks of the spinifex contrasting strangely with
the tall straight dark stems and foliage of the oaks. The
sandhills were low and somewhat distant from each other, and the
ground being tolerably level, we made about twenty-one miles.
Camped at 5 p.m. without feed or water for the camels, so they
were tied up all night. No animals or birds of any description
were seen to-day, our route being through the centre of Lake
Amadeus, as now shown on the maps. Bar. 28.450in., ther. 72&deg;
at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 46. Bar.
28.580in., ther. 58&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;Last night was
threatening and cloudy, with a shifting wind. A few showers
fell&mdash;just sufficient to make us turn out and cover up our
belongings. Started away on a bearing of S. 46&deg; E., the
sandhills running east and west, with wide valleys between them.
In nine miles turned S. 30&deg; E. Here the sandhills became
higher and more confused, with poison bush everywhere. At sixteen
miles from last camp crossed some small samphire swamps; at
seventeen miles passed a saltpan on the east side of which were
some claypans with water in them. Wishing to make a good day's
stage, these were passed. From the appearance of the country I
anticipated meeting with more, and that probably I was
approaching the western extremity of Lake Amadeus. At this point
the sandhill formation ceased, and flat sandy country with grass,
saltbush, and mulga were passed over. Here there were quondong,
prickly acacia, and quite a patch of good country for stock, but
apparently quite waterless. At 4.30 camped, having travelled
twenty-one miles. Upon such good country I deemed it safe to let
the camels go for the night. I was anxious to obtain an
observation for latitude, but the night turned out cloudy, as,
indeed, it had been all day. Bar. 28.650in., ther. 62&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 47. Bar.
28.600in., ther. 52&deg;. Light southerly wind, light
clouds.&mdash;My riding camel, "Tooroo", made a mistake last
night and wandered away by himself. This caused considerable
delay, and I did not start from this very pleasant camp until 10
o'clock. Taking up a bearing of S. 15&deg; E., we continued over
well-grassed saltbush and mulga flats for two miles, when we
again entered into spinifex and oak sandhills entirely destitute
of any other vegetation. It is over such tracts of country as
this that the traveller must push his way, for there is
absolutely nothing whatever that animals can eat. Continued on
this course for eight miles, and was distant from what I take to
be Blood's Range, of Giles, about ten miles, and it was quite
evident that no lake, or arm of one, lay between us. At this
point I turned S. 50&deg; E. The same country continued on this
bearing, but the sandhills were farther apart and running
regularly east and west, with wide valleys between them, in which
were occasional clumps of dense mulga scrub. Camped at 5 p.m.,
having travelled twenty miles. There was but little feed here for
the camels, so at dusk they were tied up for the night. The night
set in dark with heavy clouds banking up from the west, and, most
strange for this time of the year, heavy thunder and very vivid
lightning. Had the saddles stacked and under the tarpaulins. No
timber being at hand, I could not put up my tent. Bar. 28.325in.,
ther. 61&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 48; S.
latitude 24&deg; 33' 21", var. 0&deg; 26'. Bar. 28.400in., ther.
52&deg;.&mdash;Heavy rain commenced at 8 o'clock last night, and
continued with great violence till 3 a.m. this morning, violent
squalls of wind and rain being followed at intervals by steady
soaking rain. My companions managed to secrete themselves among
the saddles under the tarpaulin, but, this being so thin and
worn, it offered but indifferent shelter; the fire was beaten
out, and I passed a very wretched night. At 3 a.m. I rolled
myself up in a blanket and slept till dawn, when I let the camels
go for an hour or two. We were all wet through; but, a fire being
lit and a pot of tea passed round, we were soon in better
spirits. An idea of this rainfall may be gathered from the fact
that a 2-lb. meat tin was quite two-thirds full this morning, and
a tin dish more than half full. At 9' 15 we started away on a
bearing of 90&deg;. At two and a half miles turned S. 75&deg; E.
to examine a peculiar and abrupt outcrop of rock. Travelling over
spinifex and oak sandhills with a bald stony hill to the north of
us. Continued on this course for two miles, and then turned N.
70&deg; E. for the south side of the rock, which we reached in
seven and a half miles from our last camp. Billy went on foot to
examine the north side, while I continued on the south side. In a
quarter of a mile reached some old native encampments, where
there was a small stream of water running for a few yards into
the sands. These, of course, were the result of last night's
rainfall I decided to stay, for the camels required rest and all
our belongings wanted drying. There is fairly good feed here for
camels, and some rough grass for horses; but the area of such is
small. Billy returned from his ramble round the rock, and reports
having found a rock reservoir of considerable dimensions. Later
in the day he managed to bag a brace of rock wallaby. Any such
small game help to eke out our now slender supply of meat. Bar.
28.350in., ther. 54&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 48, Sandstone
and Pine Rock. Bar. 28.500in., ther. 32&deg; at
sunrise.&mdash;Everything was white with frost this morning.
Employed during the day drying plants and clothes, taking
observations for latitude, variation, and time. From this camp
there is an extensive view of hills and ranges to the south and
south-west. The lofty peaks of Blood's Range in the clear morning
air assume a variety of tints, while the numerous ravines and
gorges suggest innumerable little streams of water running their
limited extent into the sandhills of oak and spinifex. The peaks
of Blood's Range have such an imposing appearance that I propose
to visit them to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 48. Bar.
28.500in., ther. 33&deg;.&mdash;I found my work so much in
arrears that I decided to remain here to-day. In the afternoon
Billy, Weei, and myself went to examine the rock and the
reservoir. The rock is about eighty or one hundred feet high and
perhaps half a mile long from E. to W., and is composed of
sandstone and quartzite and covered with well-grown pine trees;
at its eastern end I noticed a few white gums and bloodwood trees
growing, while the south side is abrupt showing many little bays
and cliffs of brown rugged rock, its northern side slopes more
gradually and spinifex grows nearly to the top. Upon its
north-eastern slope is the water hole; this I find to be in solid
rock, it is quite eight feet deep, ten yards long, and one yard
wide, there are other pockets containing water in the
neighborhood but they are very small. This water is so sheltered
from the sun that I should imagine the dusky denizens of these
regions would look upon it as a permanent water, but a team of
really thirsty camels would make serious inroads with its
contents. It would be difficult to get stock up to it, and the
surest and safest way would be to carry it down to them. I
noticed here many of the ant tunnels upon the ground, and secured
several pieces of this tunnel work and a few of the builders; put
them all into a tin box with the hope that they may prove of
interest to any who value such specimens. I can only regret the
loss of the jar of methylated spirits at Bond Springs, for many
specimens of the insect kingdom could have been preserved during
this journey. There is a large quantity of poison bush around the
rock, but the camels, taught, I suppose, by experience, do not
touch it. Bar. 28.360in., ther. 75&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 49. Bar.
28.360in., ther. 36&deg;.&mdash;Fine, bright, and clear. The
camels separated into several mobs during the night and were not
brought up till late. The water at this camp ceased to run during
the night; had a longer stay been necessary I should have had to
move round to the reservoir on the other side of the hill.
Started away at 10.30 on a bearing of S. 68&deg; W., for the
first two miles travelled over mulga flats where there was a
little rough grass growing, nor was there any spinifex, but this
very soon set in. Travelled over flat sandy country with
occasional sandhills which continued until 5 o'clock, when 1
camped, the stoppages and delays were so many owing to the
perversity of one camel saddle that only twelve miles were
travelled. Bloods Range appears to be four or five miles distant,
the highest point of which I have named Mt. Harris, after Mr.
Charles Hope Harris of the Survey Department; a high point to the
east of Mt. Harris, and only separated from it by a deep ravine,
I have named Mt. Carruthers, after Mr. Carruthers of the
Trigonometrical Survey Department, who is now engaged in an
important survey of: the Musgrave Ranges and whose labors we hope
will soon extend to this point, and enable the intervening
country to be accurately laid down. As seen from the sandstone
rocks and native well at camp No. 30, a distance of seventy
miles, Mt. Harris and Mt. Carruthers seem to be quite separate,
having a narrow pass between them&mdash;and perhaps it would
appear so if seen from the south. Bar. 28.280in., ther.
64&deg;.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 50; S.
latitude 24&deg; 37' 36". Bar. 28.350in., ther.
36&deg;.&mdash;Bright, fine, cool. Started away from this camp at
8.30. The camels were tied up all night, for there was nothing
for them to eat, but I hope to get good quarters for them at
Blood's Range, although from this point there does not seem to be
any watercourse on this side of it; the sandhills around here for
a considerable distance have been burnt by the blacks, leading me
to hope that some water discoveries may be made to-day. Travelled
upon a bearing of S. 68&deg; E. and in four miles reached the
foot of the range. I was again doomed to meet with disappointment
for no sign of water was to be seen anywhere, nothing worthy of
the name of a water channel left the range, nor were there any
places where water would lodge, the country at the foot of the
range was nothing but spinifex and stones; having brought the
camels close under the range it was a difficult matter to find a
small space clear of stones for them to lay down upon while I
made the ascent; this being at last found, Fred, Billy, and I
made the ascent, leaving Beetson and Weei with the camels. It
took us an hour to reach the summit, but the view from there well
repaid our exertions. I recognised the familiar outline of Mt.
Olga in the dim distance, bearing 121&deg; 50', it must be at
least seventy miles away; the east end of a low range bears
100&deg; 30', the east end of the Petermann Range bears 147&deg;
30' beyond which is a very distant peak (probably Stevenson's
Peak). The most easterly end of a line of hills bears 322&deg;,
the western end 311&deg; 30'. I have named this South' s Range,
after Mr. South, the warden of goldfields and superintendent of
police at Alice Springs, to whom I am much indebted for obtaining
for my service the black tracker, Billy from the ranks of the
native police; a more willing, intelligent, industrious and
skilful native it would be impossible to have. The Petermann
Range appears as a long low range without any points of special
interest; it appears to be not more than six miles away, the
intervening country being oak and spinifex sandhills, all showing
evidence of having been recently burnt. This part of the range on
the south side appears very precipitous without any sign of a
creek from any point. I find, by aneroid measurement that Mount
Harris is 1,422ft. above the level of the plain. Descending from
the hill we reached the camels at 1.20, having been occupied
three hours. Having partaken of a light lunch, for which the
climb gave us a very keen appetite, I stood away easterly for one
and a half miles to get off the stones, and then turned S.
64&deg; E. for three miles and then turned east to follow the
foot of the range, hoping at every mile to meet with a
watercourse. Kept on this bearing for four miles, travelling over
level spinifex sandy country with occasional oaks. Arrived at the
end of the range, where there was a small patch of bushes and
feed for the camels and in a beautiful clump of oak timber,
called a halt for the night. The outline of Mount Harris from
this point is one of imposing grandeur, but my experience has now
taught me that it is not to such features as these that the
traveller in these regions must trust for assistance, far more
reliable are the small rocks met with in the heavy sandhill
country; these may be difficult to find, and are often found
quite by accident, but I think at most of them the temporary
requirements of a light party will be found in the small rock
reservoirs and native wells, which seem to be the only form of
water supply in this country. Bar. 28.200in., ther. 62&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 51, Pine
Rocks. Bar. 28.325in., ther. 36&deg;. Cold, S.E.
wind.&mdash;Started on a bearing of N. 45&deg; E. towards a low
stony range, travelled over spinifex sandhills for three miles
and then followed along the foot of the range upon a bearing of
S. 80&deg; E. for five miles. I was not in a position to start
from here to Lake Amadeus for I thought it probable that some
difficult country would have to be travelled over; the camels
having had but very little feed and no water since leaving the
rocks are not in good trim for such an undertaking. The little
sandstone rocks were not many miles away and plainly visible, so
I decided to give them a day there before starting for the lake,
turned upon a bearing of N. 20&deg; W. and in six miles reached
the rock, forming a camp on the north side close to the
reservoir. Bar. 28.550in., ther. 75&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camps Nos. 48 and 51.
Bar. 28.625in., ther. 36&deg;. Fine cold east wind.&mdash;Took
two photographic views of the north side of the rock. The
reservoir is not to be seen in it. It lays about half way up the
slope, and a little westerly of a white gum-tree marked T/6.89.
The camels walked nearly up to the water, and it was carried down
to them in buckets. Had they been really thirsty, this would have
been a very tedious undertaking. It is most lovely weather, and
this is a very pleasant camping place, the camels so well
contented that they are never out of sight of the camp. From the
reservoir this morning I noticed a range bearing N. 74&deg; E.,
that I had not observed before; either I had not noticed it, or
from unfavorable conditions of the atmosphere it was not in
sight, and as Mr. Giles' position of Mt. Unapproachable was not
an observed one, it is quite possible this may be it. I shall
take a course to-morrow a little south of this hill, which must
take me to the lake. Bar. 28.600in., ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 52. Bar.
28.63in., ther., 42&deg;. Light clouds, cold east
wind.&mdash;Started away at 8.30 on a bearing of 90&deg;. Passed
through mulga scrub in broad sandy flats between sandhills, the
spinifex not being so thick as we have been accustomed to lately.
This soon gave out, and dwarf mallee was passed through. I
noticed a few white gums on the sandhills at midday, and we soon
entered into an undulating sandy country, which was quite a
forest of those gum and oak trees, very pleasing indeed to the
eye, calling to mind the forest country of many parts of
Victoria, the waving stems of the spinifex being well taken for
pasture. But there was no sign whatever of animal life, and, to
make it still worse, it is a country evidently avoided by the
blacks, for though we have not seen any during the whole journey
we are quite sensible of their proximity at times; but no sign of
a piece of burnt ground has been passed during the day. The
sandhills in the afternoon were distressing to the camels and the
spinifex seemed matted together. There is absolutely nothing
whatever but this and the white gums, and after a long day's
march it is hard to have to tie the camels up all night with
neither food or water, but this has been their fate so very
frequently upon their journey that they take it as a matter of
course. Travelled twenty-one miles over such country that I wish
never to meet again. Bar. 28.610in., ther. 56&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 53; latitude
24&deg; 30' 43". Bar. 28.650in., ther. 36&deg;.&mdash;The night
was cold and I noticed a slight dew this morning. Started at 8.45
upon a bearing of 90&deg; and soon came to a small salt pan;
turned one mile N.E. to avoid this and continued on our course.
At this point the sandhills became very much higher and running
into each other in a confused and irregular manner and covered
with white gums and oaks, at eight miles I ascended a high
sandhill and observed an extensive tract of salt lake running
easterly and westerly; this, however, appeared of no width, not
exceeding a mile at its widest part, and as I wished to deal with
its western extremity I turned the caravan in that direction.
Upon the north side of the salt lake was a low line of hills of
peculiar appearance, having either been recently burnt by the
blacks, or else they are masses of bare red rock. I now turned N.
15&deg; W., travelled over spinifex sandhills for one and a half
miles and reached the shore of the lake, the width was only a few
chains, but I noticed a long wide arm extending northerly towards
the range. Travelled along the south shore for two miles west,
which brought us to the west extremity of the lake, turned N.
25&deg; W. one and a half miles, still keeping close to the lake,
then turned N. 53&deg; E. and camped close to edge of what I
think must be Lake Amadeus. Bar. 28.675in., ther. 61&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, June</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 54. Bar.
28.680in., ther. 24&deg;.&mdash;Upon rising this morning soon
after dawn everything was white with frost, blankets hard and
stiff, and a considerable thickness of ice in a tin dish that had
been left out with some water in it; fortunately there was
abundance of firewood, so we did not feel the cold so much as we
should otherwise have done. Started away at 8.50 upon a bearing
of N. 52&deg; E. towards some bare looking rocks and a gap in the
range that runs east and west, and whose western end may be said
to mark the western extremity of Lake Amadeus, I have called it
Long's Range, after my brother-in-law, Mr. John Long, of
Richmond, New South Wales. In a direct line, this gap was about
five miles from our last camp, but meeting with an arm of the
lake that made me turn a little westerly, we did not reach the
gap until I had travelled considerably more than that distance. A
small water channel runs from the western end of the range into a
long salt arm that extends to within a mile of the hills, and at
the head of this arm, and upon each side of the creek, there is a
nice piece of country well grassed with saltbush and cotton bush,
and several clay pans, which were full of water. I find the range
to be the same formation as the little rocks at Camp 48, their
bare reddish appearance being caused partly through having been
recently burnt by the blacks and partly from large masses of bare
sandstone. No water was found, though I judge there must be a
native watering place at the western end; but it was not our good
fortune to find it, Ascending the highest point available, I was
surprised to get no view of the lake. To the southward it
appeared at two or three points, but only as a very narrow
channel; to the north-east a group of low hills was observed,
being not more than five miles distant; all the country in that
direction seems to have been recently burnt. Mount Olga was
distinctly visible, bearing S. 23&deg; E., and Mount Harris S.
67&deg; W.; a low, flat-topped hill bore S. 82&deg; E., distant
about twenty-five miles. Descending from the hill (which was of
no great height), I continued along the foot of the range for
three miles upon a bearing of N. 86&deg; E., and then turned east
for three miles. I was now anxious to meet with the lake, for
near its shore was my only chance of obtaining food for the
camels. Turned upon a bearing of S. 50&deg; E. Travelled on
spinifex and oak sandhills for five miles, and then turned south.
In one mile I came upon a beautiful salt and cotton bush fiat,
and a little further on found some large deep claypans full of
water. This was an opportunity not to be missed, and though it
was still early in the afternoon (4.15) I had the animals
unpacked, and they were soon hoppled out upon the first pasture
they have had upon this journey. They were all ready for water,
and drank greedily. Bar. 28.680in., ther. 56&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 55; S.
latitude 24&deg; 35' 18", K. long. 130&deg; 31'. Bar. 28.750in.,
ther. 26&deg;. Keen east wind.&mdash;Started at 8.30 on a bearing
of S. 60&deg; E. After passing through a belt of dense mulga
scrub we entered upon a saltbush plain, with good grass, now
quite green. Numerous large claypans full of water sparkled in
the bright morning sunlight. Near the claypans the ground was
still soft from the rains, and in one or two places the camels
got bogged. In these claypans both polygonum and cane grass were
observed&mdash;not the tall vigorous variety met with in
Riverina; but it was quite a new feature to us, accustomed for so
long to nothing but the odious spinifex. Continued upon this
bearing for eight miles, when we found ourselves at the head of
an arm of the lake. I now turned towards the flat-topped hill
seen from Long's Range. Travelled upon bearing of N. 76&deg; E.,
and in six and a half miles reached the hill. From the top Mount
Olga bears nearly south; the shore of the lake is about two miles
off to the southward, cotton and salt bush country intervening.
The lake here appears to be less than four miles across, and is
seen stretching away to the south-east beyond the limits of
vision. Upon Mr. Giles' map little hills such as these are shown;
and, as he speaks of a saltbush country, the conviction is forced
upon me that the west extremity of Long's Range is his Mount
Unapproachable, and this is verified by the bearing of Mount Olga
and from the fact that no signs of any hills or ranges are to be
seen towards the south-east. Having satisfied myself upon those
points, I decided to go no further to the eastward, but to return
to the west end of the lake, traverse its south shore, and from
there start to Mount Olga. Returned on my tracks for six miles,
and camped upon an arm of the lake. Bar. 28.725in., ther. 77&deg;
at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, June</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 55; S.
latitude 24&deg; 35' 18", variation 1&deg; 41' E. Bar. 28.715in.,
ther. 27&deg;. Cold, frost, clear.&mdash;There being very
excellent feed here for the camels, a day's rest for them is
desirable, and I decided to remain here for their benefit and
endeavored to sketch in a portion of the outline of the lake; but
anything more irregular than its north shore line cannot well be
drawn, and nothing but an actual traverse could delineate its
numerous estuaries, bays, peninsulas, gulfs, and islands. Took a
very careful circumferentor bearing to Mount Olga from this camp,
and find it to be 174&deg; 30': and I am satisfied that I am east
of Mount Unapproachable. It cannot be looked upon as otherwise
than providential that Giles was prevented from reaching the west
extremity of this lake; for when we reflect upon the character of
the country that awaited him had he done so, instead of it taking
him, as he anticipated, into a more fertile country, it would
have been into difficulties that might have ended in disaster,
perhaps death. At this point the oaks and spinifex come down to
the edge of the lake, the opposite shore being at least three
miles distant. Two wild dogs were observed upon the shore of the
lake this morning. Bar. 28.625in., ther. 60&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, June</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 56. Bar.
28.600in., ther. 31&deg;.&mdash;Returned upon my outgoing tracks
for one mile. I then started upon a bearing of N. 80&deg; W. In
three miles reached a saltbush plain with claypans and grass. I
obtained a good view of a portion of the lake, which is here two
miles wide. Continued through oak forests with occasional clumps
of white j-um trees, the sandhills running irregularly, but not
of any great height. There were some large patches of ground that
the blacks had burnt, and upon these we travelled whenever
opportunity offered, for it is an immense relief to the camels to
be off the spinifex if only for a few yards. At nine miles the
west extremity of Long's Range was observed, and to avoid meeting
with the arms of the lake, that extend nearly to its foot, I
turned upon a bearing of N. 65&deg; W. for seven miles. At this
point we came upon a flat saltbush country, with grass, mulga,
and claypans. Turned N. 56&deg; E. for three miles, and hit our
outgoing tracks near the foot of Mount Unapproachable. It was
noticed that the tracks of four blacks had our been on trail, but
they only continued there a short distance. The last seen of
their tracks they were evidently making for the hills. Camped at
a claypan at the extreme western end of the lake. Bar. 28.525in.,
ther. 64&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, June</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 57; S.
latitude 24&deg; 39' 16". Bar. 28.510in., ther.
46&deg;.&mdash;The camels all drank well last night, and as there
was abundance of feed for them they looked very well when brought
up for duty. I intend to follow down the south shore of the lake
to-day, so followed my tracks for three miles to the point where
we first struck the lake, the camels marched grandly along upon
the clear flat clean ground upon the shore of the lake. I then
took up a course of S. 52&deg; E., which I thought would allow of
my continuing if not upon the shore at any rate within sight of
it, with some few diversions to avoid certain inlets. This
continued for eight miles. I was anxious to hug the lake as close
as possible, for the spinifex sandhills to the south I could see
were rather .alarming. After rounding rather a deep inlet, I
turned S. 42&deg; E. I kept pretty nearly upon this course for
five miles, but was continually being turned by the
irregularities of the shore line, and once or twice the camels
were bogged; so turned east, which course took me into very heavy
sandhills, indeed&mdash;hills and hollows alike covered with
white gum trees, quite a forest. Continued for four miles, and
then turned north-east for the shore of the lake, which I reached
in one mile. Followed down the lake for half a mile and camped,
after a tedious heavy day's work for the camels. It is worthy of
remark that while the north shore of this lake opens out into
rather extensive flats of saltbush, cotton-bush, grass,
clay-pans, and mulga, the south shore is bounded by high
sandhills of the most forbidding character, entirely destitute of
other grass than spinifex, and without any surface of clay,
which, forming into shallow pools, would allow water to
accumulate. The white gum trees before alluded to appear healthy,
but are not of such sort to be of much service for ordinary bush
purposes. Bar. 28.455in., iher. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, June</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 58. Bar.
28.575in., ther. 48&deg;, cloudy, calm.&mdash;One of the camels
(Darby) was brought up looking very bad, and my riding camel
(Tooroo) looks anything but bright. It seems only too likely that
they have eaten some poisonous herb. Darby has always been in
trouble ever since we left the Peake, and though he is the
largest camel of the lot he is by no means the strongest. Lately
he has carried only about 150lbs. weight, and for the last two
days he carried two empty casks. This day I am sure will be a
severe one, but as there is neither food nor water for them here
I must move them on with the hope that they may reach Mount Olga,
where I have promised them a full week's rest. While they were
being saddled up I took a walk down to the lake and ventured upon
its surface. I should have said that water is only to be seen in
a few places, even after the heavy rains of this winter. Its
surface is white with a thin coating of salt, and I was surprised
to find that for fully half a mile it was quite firm to walk
upon, and I think, had it been desirable, that I could have
walked to the opposite shore, not more than two miles distant. I
found upon removing a few inches of yellow sand from the surface
that I came upon fragments of gypsum. I imagine that salt springs
would be found upon many parts of its surface, which alone
account for any water that is occasionally seen upon it. Started
away at 8.35 on a bearing of S. 10&deg; E. for Mount Olga. My
camel was so bad that I had to take a place in the rear of the
caravan, so that having a track beaten down it would be easier
for him. Billy now rode on ahead. He does not keep well on any
course, but for the present I must let him go his own way.
Travelled over high spinifex sandhills for five miles, when we
were turned off our course by a salt pan of about a mile in
length. The sandhills now were less severe, and the whitegum
timber disappeared, its place being taken by occasional clumps of
mulga and a few few oaks. Camped at 5 p.m. in open spinifex
sandhills with but scanty feed for the camels. They were let go
to make the best of it for two or three hours, but Darby returned
to camp of his own accord and lay down, and my camel Tooroo laid
down without attempting to go and feed. At 8 o'clock Fred and
Billy collected all the others, and they were tied up for the
night. Mount Olga from here presents a most wonderful appearance.
Bar. 28.500in., ther. 58&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, June</i> 30<i>th</i>&mdash;Camp No. 59. Bar.
28.575in., ther. 30&deg;.&mdash;Let the camels go a little before
daybreak. It was a bitterly cold night. From this camp a range
that I take to be the McNicholl's Range of Giles bears S. 41&deg;
W., distant about six miles. At its eastern extremity is a large
dome-shaped mass of bare red rock of most singular appearance. It
is evidently a hill similar to Mount Olga, and would well repay a
visit. The scrubs look to be very thick around its base, but
with, two sick camels I think it best to push on to where I know
there is good quarters where they may recruit. The dome-shaped
rock at the end of McNicholl's Range I have named Mount Currie,
after John Lang Currie, Esq., of Victoria. Started away at 8.20
upon a bearing of S. 17&deg; E., Mount Olga being now in full
view. Seen for the first time from any point this mountain must
always strike the traveller as being a strange and wonderful
object, and our wonder and amazement increases as it is
approached. Travelled over spinifex sandhills for eleven miles,
and then reached stony ground with mulga scrub and occasional
patches of grass. Continued on until 4.30, the last few miles
being over mulga flats splendidly grassed. This camp is situated
two miles north of the Mount. The stony nature of the ground on
ahead prompted me not to tax my weak camels too much, and there
being very luxuriant feed for them here I camped, having
travelled twenty-one miles. I took some views with the camera
from this point, but the distance is too great for my small
apparatus. The sick camels went away feeding directly they were
let loose, but they evidently require some nursing. Bar.

<p><i>Monday, July</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 60, Mount Olga.
Bar. 28.325in., ther. 36&deg;. Fine, clear, cold east
wind.&mdash;Started at 8.50, and at one and a half miles was at
the foot of this stupendous mass of bare rock, proceeding round
its west extremity I passed a beautifully grassed flat, timbered
with blood wood and mulga. There was a stream of clear water
running southwards for nearly a mile from the range; passed this,
and in another mile reached Mr. Giles's camp under the abrupt
wall of the mountain. Here was another beautiful stream of water,
but as it was not so favorable a camping place as the first
stream we crossed I returned, and the camels were soon let go
upon the most luxuriant pasture; they did not move much during
the day, and when tired of feeding they rolled about on it, and
toward evening strolled off down the flat. Bar. 28.150in., ther.
54&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 60, Mount
Olga. Bar. 28.310in., ther. 40&deg;.&mdash;A very strong
southerly wind sprang up during the night, and the morning was
piercingly cold. Upon collecting the camels this morning the two
invalids were missing. Billy went after them, and in about an
hour he returned. They were most wretched looking objects. I
cannot attribute their indisposition to any cause but poison, for
the other camels are all extremely well, but the symptoms are
different to those which were poisoned near Glen Edith. There is
now a heaving of the flank and a difficulty of breathing, and
each inspiration is followed by a wheezing noise, a very slight
discharge from the nose, and they resolutely refuse the daintiest
morsels of food offered them. My camel Tooroo seems the least
affected of the two. Employed during the day mapping, posting up
diaries, repairing clothes and boots. Bar. 28.315in., ther.
48&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, July</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 60, Mount
Olga. Bar. 28.325in., ther. 26&deg; at sunrise.&mdash;It is
doubtful if the two invalid, camels will ever leave here. Darby
has certainly eaten nothing since he arrived, and he is rapidly
falling away in condition. I think the suggestion cannot be too
often repeated, viz., that future travellers in these regions
should be supplied with some simple remedies for these cases of
vegetable poison. Tooroo has borne the full brunt and burden of
the journey, for being always in advance he has had the roughest
of travelling; he has carried me bravely throughout, and it is
sad to see the noble creature stricken down and helpless. Every
advantage has been given to the other one, for being always in
the rear the camels in advance have made the way smooth for him.
Our camp is situated at the entrance to a defile in the mountain,
upon one side is a perpendicular wall of rock a quarter of a mile
long; walking up this defile or gap it is found that walls of
solid stone are upon each side, and all is stone underfoot, and
along this pavement a little stream of water runs the whole
length of the gorge. The whole mountain is a mass of coarse
conglomerate, the stones varying in size from that of a pea up to
6in. in diameter, only in two or three instances were any found
that would be termed a boulder. Of the many hundreds of stones
examined during a long ramble not a fragment of quartz was
observed.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 60, Mount
Olga. Bar. 29.290in., ther. 48&deg; cloudy, cold.&mdash;All the
camels were brought up but one. Darby has answered his last call
and is now at rest. He appears to have died without any pain, for
there is not any sign on the ground of a struggle. Tooroo is
gradually becoming weaker, and rambles about unfettered by
himself. I leave here on Monday. I may take him with me as far as
Ayers' Rock, but he will most likely be left here, where there is
such splendid pasture and water for him. The other camels are in
splendid heart, racing after each other, kicking, and playing
directly their hobbles were taken off. Desirous of knowing
something of the wash that comes from this mountain I took a tin
dish to the creek and panned off some of the drift. Not receiving
any encouragement I tried further down the creek. Noticed a fine
black sand in the bottom of the dish, which being tested proved
to be as pecular ore of iron. Bar. 28.225in., ther. 58&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, July</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mount Olga. Bar.
28.280in., ther. 42&deg;.&mdash;Had one man engaged prospecting
down the creek. Engaged the greater part of the day with the

<p><i>Saturday, July</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mount Olga. Bar.
28.075in., ther. 30&deg;.&mdash;Tooroo does not improve and looks
a most pitiable object. My one regret is that I am unable to do
anything for him. I went down the creek prospecting, selecting a
spot lower down the little water channel than where Fred worked
yesterday. The others engaged in mending saddles and preparing
for a start on Monday. Geological specimens Nos. 79 to 84
collected.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, July</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mount Olga. Bar.
28.100in., ther. 38&deg;.&mdash;Beetson and Warman went for a
ramble round the foot of the mount. Beetson returned with
material for several sketches of the most striking points of
interest. Noticed several blacks' fires close by, and I thought
we should have had the pleasure of their company, but none came
within sight. The little streamlet that here leaves the mountain
runs over a stone pavement for 200 or 300 yards, shaded by the
smooth and perpendicular cliffs. We imagine what a cool, clean
retreat this must be from the blinding rays of the summer's
sun&mdash;"The shadow of a great rock in a weary land." Being
cold winter weather we seek the sunshine and watch for the sun's
rays to reach us. As the great shadow is gradually withdrawn from
the plain it reaches its base about 9 a.m. Went up the gorge to
take some photographs, and in one or two small hollows was some
crystal clear water about three or four inches deep. The bottoms
of these little rock basins had all the appearance of the most
exquisite mosaic work. The water rushing from the surrounding
slopes in times of rain had forced out every particle of sand and
foreign matter and left the many-colored conglomerate perfectly
clean, and seen through the clear water was a most beautiful
sight. Some years ago I attempted the ascent of this mountain and
failed. I know the country around for over 100 miles. Its height
is already determined (1,500ft.), and no object would be gained
by attempting it again. To reach that point all that would be
required "would be a rocket and line to draw up a rope ladder,
and then a mortal with sufficient nerve to make the ascent. It is
quite evident that this place has not been visited by whites
since Giles and I were here in 1874. I leave behind two camel
packsaddles and four boxes, and being on stony ground and in
perpetual shade they will remain there a long time without
injury.</p>
<p><i>Monday. July</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 61. Bar.
28.050in., ther. 33&deg;. Fine, bright, clear.&mdash;After having
been to see Tooroo, I decided to leave here to-day. It is evident
his recovery will take a very long time, for, in addition to his
internal ailment, he is suffering from an injury to one of his
hind legs. Upon this he was never strong, and I think that in one
of the bogs at Lake Amadeus he must have again injured it. A more
beautiful and luxuriant spot could not be found for him to
recruit in, and I sincerely hope he may recover. Started easterly
at 12.15, taking the south side of the range. Travelled over
well-grassed mulga flats for five miles; at seven miles
occasional patches of spinifex were passed over. Camped at 4.30,
having travelled ten miles. Bar. 28.300in., ther. 74&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 62. Bar.
28.300in., ther. 32&deg; calm, bright, and fine.&mdash;Started
away at 8 a.m., Ayers Rock being five or six miles away.
Travelled over sandy flats covered with mulga scrub, passing
occasional spinifex sandhills, and soon reached the grass flats
at the foot of the rock. Passed round the south base of this
mountain of unbroken, unfractured stone. At 11.30 I unsaddled
upon the spot where I camped fifteen years ago, when here with
Giles. After dinner we went out to explore and admire this wonder
in solid granite. Many and varied are the wonderful shapes it
assumes. In one place the graceful curves and lines upon this
vast expanse of rock resemble an enormous curtain turned into
stone. In one or two places large caves are to be found near the
foot, and these in a measure spoil the otherwise regular and
graceful lines chiselled by nature upon its face. The rock
formation is a coarse-grained grey granite, the surface all over
bearing a reddish color from exposure to the elements, smooth as
glass, and almost polished. It appears to me to be quite
inaccessible, except at the one point where Mr. Gosse and his
companions made the ascent. Bar. 28.375in., ther. 62&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, July</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 62. Ayers'
Rock. Bar. 28.555in., ther. 36&deg;, a keen easterly
wind.&mdash;To-day I made a diligent search for Mr. Gosse's
marked tree, taking Billy with me. For two hours or more we
wandered about, closely examining every tree. I remember it was
an unusually large bloodwood, but its exact locality I could not
recollect; but quite close to his camp I saw the charred stump of
such a tree, and upon the ground was observed a long line of ash
and charcoal, and it became evident beyond doubt that this was
Mr. Gosse's tree. At the time of the fire there must have been a
very high wind, for its destruction is most complete, not a twig
or spray being left. Being such a large tree, it was probably in
some part a little decayed, and this would accelerate the work of
destruction. I was sorry for its loss, as it would have been
interesting to have compared the overgrowth with that from Glen
Edith. Bar. 28.430in., ther. 62&deg; at 4 p.m. Rock specimens
Nos. 85 to 88 collected.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 62, Ayers'
Rock. Bar. 28.600in., ther. 48&deg;.&mdash;Strong, variable, and
very cold winds, cloudy. Took several photographic views of the
Rock. Collecting specimens.</p>
<p><i>Friday, July</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 63. Bar.
28.600in., ther. 48&deg;.&mdash;Cold easterly wind. Started away
towards Mount Connor, on a bearing of 98&deg;, at 9 a.m. Soon
after starting one of the camels, "Moochar", went dead lame, had
to slow down all day to give him a chance: it seems to be a
contraction of the back sinews, he is a grand camel, and I trust
he is not going to lay up; their loads now are very light indeed,
so that cannot be the cause of it. Travelled fifteen miles. Bar.
28.55in., ther. 54&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday July</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 64. Bar.
28.650in., ther. 45&deg;.&mdash;Keen easterly winds. Started at
8.30. "Moochar" does not appear much better this morning. Made
other arrangements for his benefit, and to-day he will only carry
the little boy, Weei. Travelled upon the same bearing as
yesterday, over spinifex sandhills, with broad firm flats between
them, these were covered with mulga, and in some places were very
scrubby with quantities of dead wood laying upon the ground, this
made travelling difficult. It has been very cold to-day, too cold
to ride. Many of us are almost barefooted, so walking is a luxury
denied us. Several fresh tracks of blacks were passed this
morning, and their fires were quite close to us. Camped at 4.30,
having travelled twenty miles. Bar. 28.725in., ther. 50&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, July</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 65. Bar.
28.710in. ther. 29&deg;.&mdash;A bitterly cold night, had to turn
out several times to make up the fire, bedding all frozen hard.
Started at 8.30, Mount Connor being in full view. Travelled over
grass flats covered with dense mulga scrub, between these were
spinifex sandhills; at noon reached a low sandstone ridge,
covered with dense mulga, and is marked by a low abrupt cliff
that stops the caravan approaching any nearer to Mount Connor.
Followed up this low ridge in a northerly direction, and in five
miles Billy, who was walking on ahead, cried out "water!" I think
I never saw water in a more unlikely looking place, it was in a
native well, at the foot of this cliff of fractured and riven
sandstone; there are several native encampments in its vicinity,
otherwise there are no indications whatever. I decided to take
advantage of this discovery, so had the camels turned out while I
ascended the little ridge to view the surroundings. I find that
this little spring is about half a mile from the most easterly
end of this low ridge, and about a mile and a half north of Mount
Connor. I notice an attractive range about thirty miles distant,
its outline and general appearance being very similar to Gill's
Range. Its western extremity bears N. 8&deg; E.; its eastern end
N. 22&deg; E. A salt lake formation bears N. 15&deg; E. This may
possibly be the eastern extremity of Lake Amadeus; another salt
channel bears 3&deg;. I intended to have travelled easterly from
here towards the Goyder Springs, but this range, with a lake
apparently close to it, has altered my plans. I shall visit these
features, for neither are marked upon any plans that I have. The
peaks of the Musgrave Ranges appear so temptingly close, and I
should much like to go down there before going to Erldunda, but
while there are new features to discover I must deny myself the
pleasure. Bar. 28.680in., ther. 46&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>

25&deg; 26' 55". Bar. 28.650in., ther. 32&deg;.&mdash;Cold
easterly wind, with frost. I had to get up several times during
the night, owing to the extreme cold. At 2 a.m. the thermometer
went down to 29&deg;. The camels wandered away during the night,
and were not brought up till midday. I noticed large flocks of
martens flying about overhead; decided to remain here the rest of
the day. Bar. 28.580., ther. 62&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 66. Bar.
28.575in., ther. 32&deg;, cold east wind.&mdash;The camels seem
to quite dislike this place. They rambled away again last night
and were not brought up till midday. Started away at 1 p.m. upon
a bearing of N. 15&deg; E; travelled over spinifex sandhills with
mulga scrub between them. Native poplars were noticed on the
sandhills; this class of country continued for eight miles, when
the sandhills fell off and we entered upon firm flats with
nodules of limestone with dwarf acacias and saltbush. In another
mile reached the south-east end of a small salt lake. Here I
fixed the camp for the night, there being splendid feed for the
camels. Travelled ten miles. Bar. 28.700in., ther. 56&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, July</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 67; S.
latitude 25&deg; 5' 40". Bar. 28.750, ther. 26&deg;.&mdash;We had
but a slender supply of firewood last night. At dawn the boxes,
bedding, pillows, &amp;c., were white with frost. At present the
bed of this lake is covered with salt water, and, sparkling in
the bright sunshine, looks quite attractive. Started away at
8.50. Rounded the lake in two miles upon a bearing of N. 40&deg;
E. Then turned N. 14&deg; E., which taking us away from the
little lake soon brought us into spinifex sandhills. Kept on this
bearing for two miles, and then turned N. 8&deg; E. towards a gap
in the range I was steering for. Soon after starting on this
bearing struck the south-west arm of a salt channel about half a
mile wide and five miles long. Two miles further on struck the
south end of another salt lake which had water in it. Travelled
upon the east shore for three miles. Here the travelling was flat
and free from spinifex, and was a great relief to the camels.
Upon reaching the north end I expected that we should enter into
spinifex sandhills again, but was agreeably surprised to find a
country covered with dwarf acacias and leguminos&aelig;. The
surface was strewn wdth nodules of limestone, and for the first
time upon the journey a bluebush was seen. I noticed also a dwarf
pittosporum that I had seen on the south shore of Lake Amadeus.
The country continued of this description for four miles. We then
entered in a level country with mulga scrubs and the usual coarse
tussock grass. This, however, was now quite green. Perhaps to
celebrate our advent this very dreary-looking country was attired
in its best, but I think these dense mulga scrubs are
particularly dreary and monotonous travelling, more especially so
when the unknown feature for which you are steering loses that
attractive appearance that it had a few miles further back, and
as each succeeding mile brings you closer it becomes more certain
that you will meet with disappointment and accumulating
difficulties. At thirteen miles from our last camp I turned N.
45&deg; E. to examine a place where I thought I observed a
difference in the timber, and in two miles approached a stony
water channel in which were growing a few very stunted gumtrees.
I followed this up towards the range for a mile, and then came to
some small pools of very beautifully clear water. The range for
which I had been steering was about two miles ahead of us, and
did not look by any means inviting, stony and fringed with a belt
of dense mulga scrub. I could not see any place where water would
be likely to accumulate. Of course the water where our camp is
situated is only from recent rains, and will not last much more
than a week. Bar. 28.550in., ther. 56&deg; at 4 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, July</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 68; S. lat.
25&deg; 5' 40". Bar. 28.525in., ther. 32&deg;.&mdash;A central
point of Mount Connor bears 200&deg; 35' from this camp, but as
it presents only an extensive fiat surface I should say that is
the bearing of its centre. Started at 8.30 on a bearing of N.
40&deg; W. towards the western end of the range, thence west for
two miles; I was now at the western extremity of the range,
having travelled over stony slopes and through dense mulga since
leaving camp. I now turned northerly for two miles over the same
class of country. Before turning easterly I ascended a slope of
the range and observed low hills to the west, about four miles
distant south-westerly, and, separated from these by a small gap,
is another line of hills; to the northward were spinifex
sandhills. I now turned upon a bearing of S. 84&deg; E. to
traverse the northern slopes of the range; travelled through
dense mulga scrub for four miles and then turned S. 76&deg; E.,
in five miles upon this bearing reached the eastern end of the
range. No watercourse will be found to run from either the north
or south slopes of this range; it does not appear to be much
frequented by the blacks, nor do I think any water exists there.
Directly I left the range the country improved, and at sundown I
turned the camels out upon a grassy mulga flat where was the most
luxuriant herbage for them. Travelled eighteen miles, being much
delayed owing to the difficult nature of the ground I have named
this the "Kernot Range", after Professor Kernot, of the Melbourne
University, and the highest point at its western extremity, Mount
Thompson, after the Hon. H.M. Thompson, of Victoria. Bar.
28.550in., ther. 57&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, July</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 69. S. Lat.
25&deg; 5' 40". Bar. 28.455in., ther. 32&deg;&mdash;Started on a
bearing of 96&deg;, passed over flat firm mulga country,
occasionally coming to little hollows where the new growth of
herbage was very luxuriant; in three miles turned our bearing of
92&deg;, at this point two low isolated hills bore north, distant
about three miles; here we came across a claypan with water in
it, the blacks have placed boughs round one end of it to entrap
emus. I noticed splendid cotton bush growing at this spot, the
first seen since leaving the settlements. I found this ridge to
be composed entirely of sandstone laying horizontally; after
three miles of very rough stony hill travelling, and were again
upon a flat well-grassed country. At fifteen miles from the last
camp turned upon a bearing of 98&deg;, this just took us clear of
the east end of a line of low hills also composed of white
sandstone, the outer surface of which is reddened by exposure and
consequent decomposition. At sixteen miles from last camp resumed
on a bearing of 96&deg; and travelled over a country that was
entirely new to us. For months we have been accustomed to nothing
but sandhills and spinifex, here we had an open flat, firm
surface, nicely timbered with mulga and ironwood, and clothed
with saltbush, cotton-bush, and bluebush, but there was not so
much grass as I should have liked to have seen; kangaroo and emu
were seen occasionally, this class of country appears to extend
for a considerable distance to the southward. A range of hills of
about 800 feet elevation lay about two miles to northward of our
line of march and appeared to extend a considerable distance to
the eastward. I hoped to have intersected some creeks running to
the southwards from it, but none were met with. At 4 p.m. I
reached a low limestone knoll from which I obtained an extensive
view to the south and south-west; to the eastwards isolated low
hills, such as this I am now on, were dotted here and there
leading me to infer that in that direction I may soon come upon a
table land country. At 4.30, meeting with an exceptionally rich
patch of herbage and bush for the camels, I turned out, having
travelled twenty-four miles. Mount Connor is rather indistinctly
seen from this camp, bearing 235&deg; 10'. I have named this the
"Basedow Range", after F. Basedow, Esq., M.P., of Adelaide. Bar.
28.410in., ther. 58&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday. July</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 70; latitude
25&deg; 6' 35". Bar. 28.430, ther. 39&deg;.&mdash;The camels
looked very well indeed this morning. Started away upon a bearing
of N. 44&deg; E. at 8.45. I adopted this course that I might
examine a favorable-looking part of the range, and soon after
leaving camp passed some black gunyahs, where they had been
camping in time of rain, a claypan being near at hand that had
supplied their requirements. Passed over a few low stony hills,
well clothed with grass, saltbush, and bluebush, and in two and a
half miles reached the foot of the Basedow Range. I find it
composed of a white sandstone, the surface of which had become of
a brown color owing to exposure. It is covered with mulga scrub.
From its summit the view to the northward appears to be one of
saltbush and cotton-bush country, flat, and timbered with mulga.
The horizon, however, is not a very distant one, which leads me
to suppose that probably a sandhill country will be met with in
that direction. Descending from the hill I travelled upon a
bearing of 94&deg;. Passed over very splendid pasture country
until midday, and then turned the camels out, as I had numerous
camp duties to attend to. The weather was delightful and the
surroundings most charming. Bar. 28.550in., ther. 61&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, July</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 71. Bar.
28.740in., ther. 52&deg;.&mdash;Started at 8.30 S. 60&deg; E.,
towards a waterhole that Billy discovered yesterday while out
kangaroo hunting. Passed over cotton and saltbush plains for
three miles, when we reached a very extensive cotton-bush plain
that extended to the foot of the Basedow Range, about four miles
distant. Here Billy took us to a number of claypans, a few of
which contained water. After filling up the kegs I started again,
upon a bearing of 94&deg;. Passed over good pastoral country for
three miles, and then turned one mile southerly to examine a
clump of box timber. Here was a small and very shallow waterhole,
but it was dry. Numerous kangaroo were about, and two turkeys
were seen, and numerous crows. Resumed our course of 94&deg;. At
nine miles I was not very well pleased to meet with spinifex
sandhills again. At nineteen miles I obtained an extensive view
of the horizon to the south and south-east. This tract of
sandhill country appears to come from the northward between the
eastern end of the Basedow Range and the western end of a range
that I take to be the Erldunda Range, and it does not appear to
extend far to the southwards, for I can observe low flat-topped
hills and an apparently open country in that direction. Camped at
dusk in spinifex sandhills with a range of sandhills bearing N.
55&deg; E. from us and distant about six or seven miles. There
being no feed here, the camels were tied up for the night.
Travelled twenty-five miles. Bar. 28.800in., ther. 60&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, July</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 72, Erldunda
Station. Bar. 28.845in., ther. 25&deg;.&mdash;Started away upon a
bearing of S. 76&deg; E., at 8.45. Owing to a slight change of
country near the camp I was under the impression that I was out
of the spinifex sandhills, but I was soon convinced to the
contrary, although the sandhills had occasional flats of firm
ground between them which were looking fresh and green with grass
and herbage. I continued in country of this character for eight
miles, when Billy called out that he had seen an old horse track.
At mid-day I came across two old dray tracks. Calling Billy up to
consult him, he decided that they were the station drays carting
in posts, and he said the station was close by. The sandhills now
became farther apart, and the intervening country being better
grassed, with occasional clumps of box timber. Horse tracks
became quite numerous, and of recent date. At sixteen miles the
station buildings were in sight, and soon after we arrived and
received a most cordial welcome from Mr. Tomlin. Mr. Warburton
was away on the run, but he arrived in the evenings and
entertained us with a kindly welcome and the warmest
congratulations upon our safe arrival. The evening was devoted on
the one hand to questions as to what had been going on in the
world, and on the other by relating the leading incidents of our
journey, which, as a brother explorer, Mr. Warburton could
thoroughly understand and realize. Travelled sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, July</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 72, Erldunda
Station; S. latitude 25&deg; 12' 57".&mdash;I learn from Mr.
Warburton that the most prominent point in the Erldunda Range is
called Ippia by the blacks, and that the highest point in the
Basedow Range is known as Mount Ebenezer, having been so named in
memory of the late Mr. E. Flint, of the Alice Springs telegraph
station. The Basedow Range is easily seen from any of the
sandhills near the Goyder Springs, though they seem never to have
been visited. This group of springs lay south-westerly from here,
distant about twenty-five miles.</p>

<p><i>Friday, August</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Camp No.
73.&mdash;After a stay of ten days at Erldunda we prepared to
take leave of Messrs. Warburton and Conway, who have shown us
every possible attention and kindness during our stay, but before
leaving it may not be out of place to offer a few remarks upon
the short history of this very distant station. Erldunda Spring
was discovered by Mr. Warburton about five years ago, and was but
a small native well at which one horse could barely find a
sufficiency. By the industry and untiring energy of these two
gentlemen this was soon opened out and the supply of water at
some seven or eight feet was found to be practically unlimited. A
double length of magnificent troughing was accurately and
substantially laid down and the run stocked. As time,
opportunity, and circumstances offered buildings and yards were
erected and a horse paddock a mile square securely fenced. There
is now a compact, substantial, and most comfortable homestead. As
illustrating the capabilities of the spring I may say that during
my stay there I saw 400 head of cattle watered there in half an
hour. A year ago the station was attacked by blacks, and Messrs.
Warburton and Park had a narrow escape from the shower of spears
that were thrown in the short, sharp skirmish. During my stay
reports were brought in by friendly blacks that a large body of
blacks were collecting at the Goyder Springs intending to make
another attack upon the place, and there was a feeling of
insecurity and uneasiness that the pioneer settler is only too
often subject to. At midday, everything being in readiness, we
started away, taking the track that for some few miles goes
towards the Goyder Springs. Travelled over sandy country for
eight or nine miles upon a bearing of S. 66&deg; W., and then the
dray track was lost. We now turned upon a bearing of S. 66&deg;
W., and entered upon an extensive salt and cotton bush plain,
where we camped. The herbage and grass were most luxuriant, the
evening air being laden with the delicate perfume of many wild
flowers around. Travelled thirteen miles. As we were unloading
the camels a herd of cattle that had been to the Goyder Springs
passed us and camped a mile or so to the N.E. of us, being on
their way to Erldunda. For the first time upon this journey
noticed the beautiful Clianthus Dampieri (Sturt pea) in bloom.
Bar. 28.875in., ther. 56&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, August</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 74; S. lat.
25&deg; 28' 59". Bar. 28.850in., ther. 16&deg;.&mdash;As will be
seen by the thermometer, this was by far the coldest night that
we have experienced. Started away at 7.50, Billy volunteers to
act as guide, being now in the country that is known to him. He
seems to think this to be his post by every possible right of
precedence, and as he promises to go straight I allow him to do
so, though I would have preferred taking up the course myself.
Billy did not go straight or anything like it, but the outcome of
all his eccentricities, when plotted up, resulted in a general
hearing of S. 40&deg; W. for five miles, S. 36&deg; W. four
miles. Here we reached a long narrow salt lagoon trending east
and west; near here was a claypan at which I replenished the
kegs, albeit the water was very sufficiently yellow and thick.
Continuing westerly for three miles, we reached the west
extremity of the salt lake; following this down for half an hour
and then came to a gully, down which in times of rain water would
run from the adjacent sandhills into the lake. Some two or three
chains away from the lake and up this gully was a small hole
surrounded by rushes and shaded by a small acacia bush. This was
the spring, evidently a very good one; the water is of most
excellent quality, and it simply requires deepening to water any
quantity of stock. From this spring we travelled S. 58&deg; W.
for two miles and arrived at Koolida Spring. Here are four or
five mound springs with tall reeds round them; they are situated
upon the south-western end of a small salt lagoon. The springs
are choked up with black mud and reeds, but a small stream of
beautiful water runs from them into the lake. Continuing upon a
course of S. 30&deg; W., we reached the Elinburra Springs in one
and a half miles, the most southerly spring of the Goyder group
and by far the best of them all. Like all the rest, it is
situated at the edge of a salt lagoon, and three strong streams
of beautiful water run into the lake. The adjacent country is of
an undulating character and to the southward is especially well
grassed. From a low limestone hill a few hundred yards westerly
from the spring I expected to have been able to take a bearing to
Mount Connor, but was disappointed, no hills being in sight but
the Basedow and Erldunda Ranges, the former bearing 321&deg; 10',
and the latter 20&deg; 50'. Travelled sixteen miles. Bar.
28.650in., ther. 64&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 75; S. lat.
25&deg; 36' 46". Bar. 28.600in., ther. 22&deg;.&mdash;Started at
9 on a bearing of S. 65&deg; 30' E. I was not by any means well,
and I availed myself of Billy's knowledge of the country to
travel in the lead and keep the course while I took a place in
the rear, where the travelling is much easier than in the lead,
there being actually nothing to do but sit still and be carried
along. For five or six miles travelled over really very splendid
and well-grassed country; limestone rises occasionally appeared
and these were well clothed with saltbush and bluebush. Mulga
scrub and a poorer class of country then set in; at eleven miles
entered into a settled sandy mulga scrub country with occasional
sandhills. From one of these I observed a low range of hills
bearing S. 9&deg; E., distant about twenty-five miles; this is
possibly Ayers' Range. Billy, who is now in his native land,
tells me there are "many pretty places there", and that there is
a trig, station on one of the hills. Continued on until 4.30,
having travelled twenty-one miles, for the most part through flat
mulga scrub country with coarse grass. Billy also tells me that
we shall not meet with any more spinifex, which is indeed joyful
news. Bar. 28.400in., ther. 68&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Monday, August</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 76. Bar.
29.310in., ther. 42&deg;.&mdash;Last night was mild and pleasant,
a most agreeable change from the biting frosts that we have
experienced of late. Started upon a bearing of S. 68&deg; E.
After travelling for six miles through dense, though exceedingly
well-grassed mulga scrubs, we emerged into more open country,
rich in every variety of pasture. From the top of a low sandstone
ridge that was here met with I obtained a more extensive view of
the eastern horizon than I have had for a long time.
North-easterly is a line of hills of considerable height, though
apparently of no great extent. Upon a bearing of S. 55&deg; E. I
observe some masses of bare red rock, apparently granite, and I
decided to visit them with the hope of finding some feature of
value and interest; travelled over flat, well-clothed pastoral
country, which is now looking its very best. Bright flowers
blossom all around: their varied hues and delicate tints present
a brilliant and ever-varying panorama of splendour. It was a
scene specially attractive to us, so long accustomed to the
sombre and irritating spinifex. In six miles we were close to the
rocks, and here the growth of grass, crowfoot, and other plants
was most luxuriant; eclipsing all by the brilliance of their
blossom was the vetch, a pea so plentiful in the Musgrave Ranges,
and which here grows in large patches of an acre or two. In color
the flower is a bright carmine, and forms quite a feature in the
appearance of the landscape. The camels while walking on them
snatch up huge mouthfuls as opportunities offer. Arriving at the
rocks I found many traces of blacks, but no water. Turned south
for half a mile to examine another mass of bare granite. Before I
had time to get near it Billy, who was on ahead on foot, had
found all there was to find, and that was a fair-sized rock hole
containing sufficient for our night's requirements, and to
replenish the kegs. The camels have been tied up every night
since leaving Erldunda, and were entitled to a little
consideration, so they were let go upon such feed that it has
never been their lot to graze upon since we have had them. Camped
at 3.35, having travelled eighteen miles. Bar. 28.160in., ther.
73&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, August</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 77. Bar.
28.175in., ther. 48&deg;.&mdash;Started at 7.45 on a bearing of
S. 88&deg; E. Travelled over well-grassed flat mulga country for
five miles, then turned S. 65&deg; E.; and in nine miles upon
this bearing struck a small water course with a few gumtrees on
its banks. I noticed that there was a quantity of soda on the
sand in the creek channel, which led me to think some water might
be in the neighborhood. I therefore called a halt for half an
hour so that a search might be made. Beetson and myself decided
to go up the creek; Fred and Billy went in the opposite
direction. We soon heard Billy calling out, and we returned to a
spot only a few yards down the creek from where we crossed it,
and there was a group of four or five native wells or springs in
the creek. Surrounded as they are by very splendid pastoral
country, this position will some day be of value. From here I
turned upon a bearing of S. 30&deg; E., and in four miles struck
a large gum creek flowing to the southwards. The bed was level
and sandy, and there being so little drift it was not easy to
decide which way the water flowed I imagine this must be the
Krichauff of Mr. Giles's journey in 1873. In less than two miles
crossed another and still larger creek, which I imagine would
flow into the other. At the first creek I turned upon a bearing
of S. 56&deg; E., and continued travelling over flat,
well-grassed mulga country till 5 o'clock, when I camped.
Travelled twenty-four miles. Bar. 28.400in., ther. 75&deg; at 5
p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, August</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 78; S.
latitude 25&deg; 57' 42". Bar. 28.450in., ther. 23&deg;; cloudy,
calm.&mdash;While Fred and Billy were out after the camels they
noticed tolerably fresh camel tracks and a man driving them on
foot. I imagine they must belong to a survey party. Started upon
a bearing of S. 82&deg; E., and very soon, after noticed a trig,
station upon a low scrubby hill, and in five miles reached its
foot. Here it may not be out of place to express the hope that
ere long this valuable work may be extended, and that these
beacons, emblems of accuracy and precision, will be seen upon the
mountain tops to the 129 meridian, and this vast territory
accurately placed upon our maps. I regret not having gone up to
examine the trig, to compare with my latitude of last night, but
it was so early in the day that I was anxious to push on. Passed
on the south side of the trig, hill, between it and some isolated
rocks or ridges, a little southerly from it. We now entered upon
a tableland country, well clothed with every variety of herbage.
At nine miles from last night's encampment reached a small sandy
channel running to the southward, in which was a strong water
soakage. Billy tells me it is called Imbunyerra, and that he has
been here before. To avoid certain rough-looking hills I turned
upon a bearing of S. 60&deg; E. Travelled for five miles over
very rough hilly country, which gave us much trouble and caused
many delays. At last found a leading channel, down which we
travelled for two miles on a general bearing of S. 45&deg; E. In
the sandy channel of a small creek Billy found some water, and
though it was still early I turned out, for the camels want
water. Travelled sixteen miles. Bar. 28.475in., ther. 75&deg; at
5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, August</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 79. Bar.
28.475in., ther. 36.&mdash;I found such a multitude of duties
requiring immediate attention that a start was not made till
noon. Started upon a bearing of S. 55&deg; E., which, just took
us clear of some low bluff hills. In three miles turned S.
65&deg; E., and at once entered into the thickest mulga scrub
that I have ever met with. This, with the stony nature of the
ground, made progress slow. Occasionally from a higher point a
peep would be obtained of the country to the north and southward,
but as far as the eye can reach it appears the same. Appearances
are not more deceiving in anything than in judging of country
from a distance. The only real way to find out what it is like is
by going to see. At 4.30 I reached a small flat, which was
traversed by a small sandy channel. Upon either bank, growing in
the wildest luxuriance, was the most beautiful herbage, and as
there seemed to be more stones and scrub on ahead I accepted it
for the night's bivouac. Travelled fourteen miles. Bar.
28.600in., ther. 69&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Friday, August</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 80. Bar.
28.725in., ther. 35&deg;.&mdash;A very lovely morning. Started at
7.30 on a bearing of S. 60&deg; E. At eight miles turned S.
50&deg; E., and in eleven miles from last camp struck a sandy
water channel, down which at times tremendous bodies of water
must flow with great violence. Evidence of such is to be seen in
the scooped-out earth and sand, the bended and broken trees, the
piled-up driftwood and debris. This channel apparently comes a
great distance from the westward, and we having travelled from
that direction and not having seen any hills 200ft. high I cannot
but wonder where the great fall can be that gives the water so
fierce an impetus. This little mulga channel soon swelled out
into a broad sandy creek bed, in which were several little pools
of water. Some few gumtrees also appear as we follow it down, but
these though nearly all young are not of very vigorous growth.
Continuing down the creek on a bearing of S. 80&deg; E. for three
or four miles it is joined by another creek coming from the
northward. From the junction it takes a more southerly course. I
now left the creek and stood upon a bearing of S. 45&deg; E.,
travelling over stony, scrubby, undulating country for five
miles, and to avoid some awkward-looking, scrubby hills I turned
on a bearing of 90&deg; and in three miles reached a small hollow
where there was a little feed for the camels, which they were
turned out upon for an hour or two, and then made fast for the
night. Travelled twenty-two miles, for the most part over poor
and scrubby country. Bar. 29.125in., ther. 62&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, August</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 81. Bar.
29.175in., ther. 24&deg;.&mdash;Calm, bright, beautiful morning.
Started away at 7.30 on a bearing of N. 10&deg; E. over stony,
scrubby hills. At six miles the country opened out into a wide
valley, through which ran a small boxtree watercourse. In this a
few small pools of water were noticed. Horse and cattle tracks
now became quite numerous, showing that we were again approaching
the settlements. At nine miles struck a cattle path that took us
upon a general bearing of N. 80&deg; E. At seventeen miles from
our last camp a hut and cattle yards were observed about a mile
south of our course. Here I turned S. 45&deg; E. to a myall water
channel, in which were several large pools of water. The country
now became more stony, and but for the cattle path being so well
trodden and cleared of stones our progress would have been much
slower. At 5 p.m. observed the buildings of Eringa station, and
knowing that camels are often a cause of annoyance where there
are horses I camped just in sight of the place. There was no feed
for the camels, and though they have had an extra long day I was
compelled to tie them up for the night. Travelled twenty-four
miles. Bar. 29.500in., ther. 58&deg; at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday, August</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camp No. 81, Eringa
Station.&mdash;Went Tip to the station, and there had the
pleasure of meeting Mr. T. Magarey, the manager of Crown Point
Station, on the Finke. Later in the day I was introduced to Mr.
Treloar, the manager, who offered us a most kindly and hospitable
welcome, and sent down to our camp some of the produce of his
garden in the shape of some of the finest cauliflowers that I
have ever seen. Later in the day Mr. Treloar showed me round the
garden, where I saw cabbages, turnips, and many other vegetables
of splendid growth. We then went for a row upon the water, which
is over a mile long and 30ft. deep. Four thousand head of cattle,
besides a number of horses, find water here; and this is only one
of many fine sheets of water on this run. Mr. Magarey started
away for the Charlotte Waters telegraph station; and the
following day Mr. Gillen, the telegraph master, sent out a
special camel messenger with a note saying that the rations that
should have been at Erldunda were lying there. My intention was
to have travelled down the Stevenson Creek until I reached the
telegraph line at the Macumba Creek; but this intelligence
decided me to journey to the Charlotte, and there place myself in
communication with the directors of the association.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, August</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started away from
Eringa Station at 11 a.m., and travelled along the road towards
the Charlotte. The camels, finding themselves once more upon a
well-beaten road, stepped out with a will. Travelled over the
well-known stony tableland country, now looking very fresh and
green, and camped at a myall watercourse. Travelled fourteen
miles.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, August</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bar. 29.500in.,
ther. 33&deg;.&mdash;Started at 7.15, and at twelve miles reached
the Charlotte Waters telegraph station, when we received a most
cordial welcome from Messrs. Gillen and Byron. Sent a message to
the secretary of the association acquainting him' of my arrival,
asking for instructions as to my future movements. Took the
camels a little way down the creek and there formed a camp,
awaiting dispatches; which arriving in a few days, I directed the
caravan down the telegraph line towards the terminus of the
railway.</p>

<h3>LIST OF PLANTS COLLECTED DURING MR. TIETKENS' EXPEDITION INTO
CENTRAL AUSTRALIA, 1889.</h3>
<p align="center">By Baron Sir F. von <span class=
"a">Mueller</span>, F.R.S., &amp;c., and Professor R.
<span class="a">Tate</span>, F.L.S., &amp;c.</p>
<p align="center">[From the transactions of the Royal Society of
South Australia, 1890.]</p>
<p align="center">[Read April 1st, 1890.]</p>
<p>Last year Mr. Tietkens was placed in charge of a party by the
Central Australian Exploring and Prospecting Company, Adelaide,
to explore the Macdonnell Range and the country to the west and
south of it. The period of exploration embraced the months of
April to August, and the plants which form the subject of this
report were collected by Mr. Tietkens and his assistants during
that time.</p>
<p>As Mr. Tietkens' map and journal are not yet published, the
approximate position of each locality referred to in this report
here follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Proceeding northward from Charlotte Waters the localities
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>Crown Point, on the River Finke, about forty miles north of
Charlotte Waters. Horse-shoe Bend, twenty miles north of Crown
Point. Orraminna, forty miles south of Alice Springs. Emily Gap
(in the Macdonnell Range), eight miles south of Alice Springs.
Burt Plain or the tableland on the north of the Macdonnell Range,
the scarped front of which constitutes that range. (See East,
Trans. Roy. Soc. S. Aust., vol. xii., p. 47, 1889.) Bond Springs,
ten miles north-east of Alice Springs. Painta Springs, fifteen
miles north-west of Alice Springs.</p>
<p>Thence along the Macdonnell Range are:&mdash;Mount Sonder,
long. 132&deg; 20', lat. 23&deg; 35'; Mareena Bluff, Mount
Razorback, Glens Helen and Farewell being adjacent thereto. Glen
Edith, long. 131&deg; 10', lat. 23&deg; 50'.</p>
<p>Thence about west to the boundary line with West Australia.
Watson Hills, about midway between Glen Edith and Gill's Creek,
in Clelands Hills, long. 130&deg; 30', lat. 23&deg; 48'.
"Sandstone Rocks", long. 129&deg; 35', lat. 23&deg; 50'. Laura
Vale, six miles from Mount Rennie, in long. 129&deg; 15', lat.
23&deg; 35'. Mount Leisler, in the Kintore Range, long. 128&deg;
25', lat. 23&deg; 30', sixteen miles from north-east of Lake
Macdonald.</p>
<p>Lake Macdonald&mdash;Thence returning by way of Lake Amadeus
to near Charlotte Waters, there are -Warman Rocks, south-east of
Lake Macdonald, long. 128&deg; 54', lat. 23&deg; 55'. Mount
Harris, in Blood's Range, long. 129&deg; 27', lat. 24&deg; 40'.
Mount Olga is seventeen miles north of west from Ayers' Rock,
which latter is in long. 130&deg; 50', lat. 25&deg; 30'; Mount
Conner, long. 131&deg; 30', lat. 25&deg; 30'. These island-like
elevations are situated about half a degree to the south of Lake
Amadeus. Basedow Range, long. 132&deg; 10', lat. 25&deg; 5'.
Between here and Charlotte Waters are Erldunda, Goyder's Springs,
Ayers' Range, and Eringa, the last thirty miles west of Charlotte
Waters.</p>
<p>The collection numbers 250 species, and compares not
unfavorably with the joint results of Giles and Gosse in their
several expeditions to this region. Nevertheless, the whole
collection is somewhat disappointing, and adds but scantily to
the records of the Australian flora. This is all the more to be
regretted as the season of 1889 was exceptionally favorable, and
the part of the region traversed was a novel one for botanical
research. Much of the material has been gathered without due
discrimination as to flower and fruit, and consequently much time
has been lost in the determination of the species, otherwise we
might have had a much larger array of species.</p>
<p>The collection is characteristic of the Eremian region, and
the high land of the Macdonnell Range does not seem to possess
any other type of vegetation, though it offers several specific
differences, and some few generic, as compared with the low-level
tracts which stretch southward from its base.</p>
<p>The following species are new to the Australian
flora:&mdash;Eriostemon argyreus, n. sp.; Sida podopetala, n.
sp.; Calotis latius-cula, n. sp.; Goodenia fascicularis, n. sp.;
Ipomea racemigera, n. sp.; Teucrium grandiusculum, n. sp.;
Eremophila Tietkensii, n. sp.; and Eriocaulon graphitimum, n.
sp.</p>
<p>The following species are additional records to the flora of
extra-tropical South Australia*:&mdash;Hybanthus miniatus, F.v.M.
Phyllantus minutiflorus, F.v.M. Extends from Port Darwin to the
Upper Victoria river.</p>

Sonder. Bentham already doubted the mutual specific distinctness
of B. urticifolia, B. linearis, B. tenella, B. grandis, and B.
ramosissima. Recently Schumann (Flora von Kaiser Wilhelm's Land,
117) proposed to unite them under the name B. urticifolia; but
that appellation becomes particularly misleading when applied to
the whole complex of forms, because even the typical plant,
delineated by Bauer (Endl. Iconogr., 78) shows no leaves which
could be compared to those of a nettle. Far apter among R.
Brown's specific designations would be that of B. gracilis as
collective, unless the B. Browniana (Schinz in den Verhandl. des
Bot. Ver. v. Brandenb. xxi., 194) just described from S.W.
Africa, should prove conspecific with the Australian plant, as it
would seem from the notes offered, in which case the name would
be very eligible also for the species established by R. Brown.
The name Buechnera seems first to have been correctly written by
Murray in the 13th edition of Linnaeus' Syst. Veg. (1774); the
genus was dedicated to the celebrated physician Andreas Elias
Buechner, F.R.S., who was president of the Acad. C&aelig;s. Leop.

<h3>DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES.</h3>
<p align="center">By Baron Sir F. von <span class=
"a">Mueller</span>, and Professor R. <span class=
"a">Tate</span>.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Eriostemon Argyreus</span>,
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Very lepidote all over, with narrow or elliptic-lanceolar
leaves, but gathered without any flowers or fruits. Allied to E.
anceps as far as foliage is concerned. Central Australia.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Sida Podopetala</span>, F.v.M.
and Tate.</p>
<p>Extensively bearing a close but short indumentum; leaves
rather small, on short petioles, from orbicular to
lanceolar-ovate, irregularly denticulated except towards the
base; stipules linear-filiform, early deciduous; penduncles
mostly axillary and solitary, articulated near the flower, as
long as the latter; calyx comparatively large, its lobes deltoid,
shorter than the tube or nearly as long; the latter semiovate or
finally almost semiglobular, faintly many-streaked; petals
yellow, nearly equilateral, by about one-third longer than the
calyx, slightly bilobed, the upper half much dilated, the lower
half cuneated, and to wards the base densely ciliolated; staminal
tube short; styles numerous, only connate near the base;
ovularies much beset with very short hairlets, connected into a
much depressed mass, and this surrounded by a conspicuous,
somewhat crenulated disk. Central Australia.</p>
<p>This plant has the aspect of an Abutilon, but its ovularies
are uniovulate. The width of the expanded flowers is somewhat
more than an inch. The form of the petals is rather exceptional
in the genus, they being somewhat suddenly contracted into the
long, almost stalk-like basil portion.</p>
<p>This species differs from S. cleisocalyx in broader and
pointed leaves, in longer peduncles, and in organization of the
flowers, though S. cleisocalyx may be dimorphous and is known to
us as yet in the clandestinely flowering state only; the fruits
of the two may also be different. From S. platycalyx our new
plant is separated by narrower leaves, by the calyces being not
provided with very prominent ridglets, and further by the petals
emerging beyond the calyx.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Calotis Latiuscula</span>,
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Erect, rather robust, beset with short scattered hairlets;
leaves comparatively large, those of the branches simply sessile
or with broad base somewhat clasping, from cuneate to elliptic
lanceolar, flat, indented towards the summit or quite entire;
headlets of flowers arranged in almost corymbous panicles, on
slender peduncles: involucral bracts nearly lanceloar; floral ray
yellow; solid portion of fruit almost broader than long; spinules
generally nine to ten, beyond the base disconnected, few much
shortened, the others about as long as the seed-bearing portion
of the fruit or somewhat longer. Central Australia.</p>
<p>This plant has also been gathered near the Finke river by the
Rev. H. Kempe. The leaves are in form similar to those of C.
cymbacantha, while the fruits are much like those of C.
lappulacea, but the headlets and leaves are much larger.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Ipomea Racemigera</span>,
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Imperfectly beset with short hairlets; leaves small, on rather
long stalks, cordate, from the conspicuously bilobed lower
portion gradually narrowed into an acute apex, without any
incisions or denticles, on the surface nearly glabrous; racemes
as long as the leaves or longer with several flowers; pedicels
much shorter than the calyx; outer sepals almost cordate towards
the base, gradually acuminated; corolla small, hardly half
exserted; stamens three times shorter than the corolla; style
short; ovulary glabrous. Glen Helen.</p>
<p>Branches slightly verrucular-rough. Leaves on the only and
fragmentary specimen available, 1&frac12;in. long. Racemes
possibly in amply developed inflorescences cymously arranged.
Corolla white. Fruit unknown.</p>
<p>This is nearest I. chrysides, but that plant has a cymous
inflorescence, blunt sepals and a yellow corolla; the fruit of
the two may also be different. In. aspect the plant is also not
unlike Hewettia bicolor.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Goodenia Fascicularis</span>,
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Dwarf, herbaceous, depressed, stoloniferous, almost glabrous;
radical leaves linear or cuneate-lanceolar, often somewhat
indented; stem-leaves quite linear, entire, the uppermost
frequently fasciculated; flowers axillary and terminal, solitary,
rather small; peduncles about twice as long as the flowers,
bractless; lobes of the calyx very narrow, about as long as its
tube; corolla yellow, beset as well as the calyx with appressed
hairlets outside, all the lobes almost equally bilobed, the two
upper outward scariously appendiculated; style much shorter than
the corolla, bearing hairlets at and towards the summit;
stigma-cover much broader than long; fruit ovate-globular, only
its summit emerging; seeds surrounded by a conspicuous membrane.
Basedow Range.</p>
<p>Near G. heteromera, G. filiformis, and G. O'Donellii.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Teucrium Grandiusculum,</span>
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Beset with spreading, very short, somewhat glandular hairlets;
upper leaves sessile, flat, equally green on both sides, from
rhomboid to cuneate-ovate, entire towards the base, thence
serrated; floral leaves similar in form, but smaller and crowded;
flowers all axillary, solitary, on short stalklets, much
exceeding the floral leaves; lobes of the calyx fully as long as
the tube or even somewhat longer, semilanceolar, pointed; corolla
rather large, white, outside imperfectly beset with minute
hairlets, its middle lobe hardly double as long as the adjacent
lobes, about twice as long as broad; stamens and style nearly
equalling the corolla in length; fruitlets almost ellipsoid,
upwards slightly beset with hairlets. Central Australia.</p>
<p>Only the upper part of the plant seen. Leaves thus measuring
1in. and gradually less in length. Corolla usually about
two-thirds of an inch long, the upper lobes almost as large as
the lateral lobes. Fruitlets nearly one-eighth of an inch
long.</p>
<p>The plant when out of blooming has the aspect of a Scaevola.
The flowers are larger than those of any other Australian
species.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Eremophila Tietkensii</span>,
F.v.M. and Tate.</p>
<p>Branchlets robust; leaves rather large, greyish from an
extremely short vestiture, elongate or narrow-lanceolar, entire
but somewhat flexuous, gradually narrowed to the apex, slightly
decurrent into the rather conspicuous petiole; flowers axillary,
solitary; pedicel about as long as the calyx, thickened upwards;
segments of the calyx lanceolar, much narrowed towards the base,
overlapping at the margin, nearly glabrous, soon scarious,
reticulate-venular, somewhat dotted; style glabrous; ovulary
imperfectly beset with glandular very minute hairlets,
ovate-globular, but the summit conically contracted; ovules four
in each cell. Central Australia.</p>
<p>Leaves from two to three inches long, half to two-thirds of an
inch broad, without any lustre; thinly keeled; the lateral
venules few and faint or concealed. Calyx-segments nearly
two-thirds of an inch long. Corolla and fruit unknown. Allied to
E. Clarkei, E. Oldfieldii, and E. graciliflora, but not
combinable with any of them.</p>
