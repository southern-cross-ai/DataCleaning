<h3>Published in <i>The Tattler</i> (Brownwood High School paper),
December 22, 1922</h3>

<p class="first">"GET ME," I told the foreman of the ranch where I
was spending my vacation, "a tame and peaceful bronc, for I would
fain fare forth among the hills to pursue the elusive bovine and,
as thou knowest I have naught of riding skill, therefore I wish a
quiet steed and if it be aged I care not."</p>

<p>The foreman gazed at me thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I have just the cayuse for you," he said.</p>

<p>"Hi Alkali! Bring forth Whirlwind!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" I said hastily, "for doubtless he is a veritable
whirlwind and such I will not mount."</p>

<p>"Not so," quoth the foreman, "he is named thus in delicate
sarcasm, for he is lazy as a tenderfoot and as gentle as a
kitten."</p>

<p>Alkali led the horse out, Utah Jack, the top hand, Two-Gun
Ghallihan, and all the rest of the disreputable gang following. The
steed was a shabby, sleepy, mild appearing buckskin of no great
size. He dozed as he stood and slumbered as I saddled him.</p>

<p>The saddle was a high, double-rigged affair with a bulging fork
and before I swung into it, the foreman tied a coiled lariat to it.
Then, solemnly he buckled about my waist a belt from which swung a
long, black holster in which reposed a single action Colt
.44-40.</p>

<p>"For rattlers," he explained, solemnly.</p>

<p>I mounted. My noble steed stood still, slumbering. I invited him
to go forward. He remained stationary. I touched him tentatively
with my spurs. He turned his head and gazed at me strangely.
Indignant I jabbed him viciously with the spurs, at the same time
using words.</p>

<p>That brought results! I thought at first that a cyclone had hit
me but it was only the kittenish pranks of my gallant charger. He
bucked. He pitched. He sun-fished. He swapped ends. He rose on his
hind legs and danced. He rose on his front legs and capered. He
placed his hind and fore feet together and spun around and around
with such rapidity that I was dizzy. He leaped high in the air and
came down stiff-legged with a force that jolted my very intellect.
He seemed to be changing the whole landscape.</p>

<p>How did I stay on? There was a reason. Not my fault that I
stayed on. I wanted off as bad as he wanted me off. I felt as if my
bones were falling apart. I could scarcely hear the delighted yells
of the cowpunchers. Yet I stayed. Even when my steed dashed at full
speed under a tree limb which just cleared the saddle horn. I
remained but the branch did not. I remained even when my frolicsome
charger lay down and rolled on the ground in spite of my protesting
screams. He arose and began to do some entirely new tricks when
something snapped. It was the two girths breaking simultaneously. I
described a parabola and landed on my head some twenty yards away
with the heavy saddle on top of me. My erstwhile steed emitted a
paean of victory, danced a scalp-dance on my prostrate frame and
galloped away over the horizon.</p>

<p>"General Jackson fit the Injuns" remarked the foreman as he
helped me up. "You&rsquo;re the ridin&rsquo;est critter I ever see.
They ain&rsquo;t another guy on the ranch that coulda stayed on
Whirlwind that long."</p>

<p>Shaking off his hand, I staggered up and drew the gun he had
given me. "For rattlers!" I gasped and if he hadn&rsquo;t fled and
I hadn&rsquo;t missed and the gun hadn&rsquo;t been loaded with
blanks anyway, I&rsquo;d have massacred him.</p>

<p>But what I did not tell him was that my gun belt got hung over
the saddle horn and the lasso came loose and tangled me up so I was
tied to the saddle and couldn&rsquo;t get off to save my life till
the saddle came too.</p>

"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkshaw_the_Detective">Hawkshaw the
Detective</a></h3>

<p class="first">HAWKSHAW, the great detective, was smoking a stogy
reflectively when the Colonel burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Have you heard&mdash;" he began excitedly, but Hawkshaw raised
his hand depreciatingly.</p>

<p>"My dear Colonel," he said. "You excite yourself unduly: you
were about to tell me that the Queen&rsquo;s necklace, valued at
fifteen million shillings, was stolen from her boudoir and that so
far Scotland Yard has found no trace of the thief although they
have ransacked London."</p>

<p>"You are a wonder, Hawkshaw," exclaimed the Colonel admirlingly.
"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Deduction, my dear Colonel," replied Hawkshaw, surreptitiously
concealing the newspaper in which was a full account of the
robbery.</p>

<p>"Have you been to the palace?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have," was the reply. "And I brought the only clew to be
found. This cigar stub was found just beneath the palace
window."</p>

<p>Hawkshaw seized the stub and examined it carefully.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he exclaimed. "The man who stole the necklace was a very
tall, lank, gangling person, with very large feet and cross-eyed.
He wears a number 5 hat."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed the Colonel, "and how may I ask do you
deduce that? How do you even know that a person who smoked that
cigar stole the necklace?"</p>

<p>"The stub is flattened on one side. That proves that its smoker
had a large foot. He stepped on it and it would take a great deal
of weight to even dent a cigar like that. I know that its smoker is
the thief because it is a long stub and anyone who could stand one
whiff of that cigar would smoke it entirely up. He would be that
kind of man. He evidently dropped it in his haste to make his
getaway."</p>

<p>"But that hat? And his tallness and cross-eyes?"</p>

<p>"Any man that would smoke a cigar like that would wear about a
number 5 hat. As for the tallness and cross-eyes I will explain
later."</p>

<p>Just then there came a tap at the door. The Colonel opened it
and an old man entered. He wore large green glasses, was a great
deal stooped and had white hair and a long white beard.</p>

<p>"You are the famous detective?" he addressed Hawkshaw. "I
believe I have a clew to this theft. I passed along the opposite
side of the street about the time the robbery was supposed to have
taken place. A man jumped out of the palace window and walked
rapidly up the street."</p>

<p>"Umhum," remarked Hawkshaw, "what kind of man was this?"</p>

<p>"He was about five feet tall and weighed perhaps three hundred
lbs.," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Umhum," commented Hawkshaw, "would you mind listening to my
theory?"</p>

<p>"I would be delighted," answered the old man as he seated
himself in the best chair.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" began Hawkshaw, rising and walking to the middle
of the room so that he could gesture without knocking the table
over. "At the time of robbery was committed a man was returning
home from a fishing trip on the Thames. He carried a fishing pole
on his shoulder and as he walked along he looked into the windows
of houses he had passed while seemingly gazing straight ahead for
he was very cross-eyed." (Here the visitor started.) Hawkshaw went
on, "The gentleman at last arrived in Windsor and passing the
palace saw the necklace lying on the mahogany table. The window was
open and though it was high off the ground he saw a way to get it.
He was (and is) a very tall man and he had a long rod and line.
Standing on tiptoes he made a cast through the window as if casting
for trout. He hooked the necklace at the first throw and fled,
dropping his cigar in his flight. He also stepped on the cigar. He
eluded the police easily and thought to elude me by coming to me in
disguise and seeking to divert suspicion in another direction."</p>

<p>And with that Hawkshaw leaped upon the old man and gripped him
by the beard and gave a terrific jerk. The old man gave a yell as
he was jerked erect and yanked across the floor. Hawkshaw turned
pale. He had made a mistake in identity? He placed a foot against
the old gentleman&rsquo;s face and grasping the beard firmly in
both hands gave another jerk. Something gave way and Hawkshaw and
his victim sprawled on the floor, Hawkshaw holding in his hands the
false beard and wig. While the impostor was trying to rise,
encumbered by his long coat the detective sprang nimbly up and with
great dexterity kicked the huge green glasses from his face.</p>

<p>The "old man" was revealed as a tall, gangling man with huge
feet and cross-eyes!</p>

<p>As he rose Hawkshaw advanced toward him with a pair of
handcuffs.</p>

<p>"You are under arrest," he said.</p>

<p>The man stepped back and drew a glittering butter knife from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I am a desperate man! Beware!" he said fiercely.</p>

<p>At that moment the Colonel recovered from his amazement enough
to push the muzzle of a howitzer against the villain and he was
soon handcuffed.</p>

<p>"Call the police, Colonel," directed Hawkshaw, taking the
necklace out of the fellow&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>"Curses!" hissed the villain, "tricked, foiled, baffled!
Curses!"</p>

<p>"But, Hawkshaw," asked the Colonel a few hours later, after they
had collected the enormous reward that had been offered for the
recovery of the necklace. "But Hawkshaw, how did you know that was
the man?"</p>

<p>"My dear Colonel," answered Hawkshaw as with a smile he lighted
a stogy, "I smelt the fish on his hands."</p>

<h2><a id="juv3" name="juv3">THE SHEIK</a>
</h2>

<h3>Published in <i>The Tattler</i> (Brownwood High School paper),
March 15, 1923</h3>

<p class="note">The book mentioned in the Introduction is Edith
Maude Hull&rsquo;s romance novel <i>The Sheik</i> (1919), filmed
two years later under the same name and starring Latin sex symbol
Rudolph Valentino.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="first">THE OTHER DAY I ambles kinda aimless into a
book-store. She&rsquo;s a new range for me so when the clerk comes
up and says "What can I do for you, me good man?" I says, "Lady,
you can trot out the latest edition of &lsquo;Relentless Rupert,
the Red-handed Avenger of the Spanish Main.&rsquo;&nbsp;"</p>

<p>She gives me the once-over kinda scornful. "We don&rsquo;t keep
no such low brow stuff," says she. "Whyn&rsquo;t you read
somethin&rsquo; inspiring and romantic? Now here&rsquo;s a very
popular novel called &lsquo;The Sheik.&rsquo;&nbsp;"</p>

<p>"Indeed?" says I.</p>

<p>"One fifty," says she.</p>

<p>I slips her the fish and a half and does a lam. The book has got
a picture on the cover of a Oriental gent on a cayuse doin&rsquo; a
lam across the prairie. I read a book once called "Huloo Himalaya,
the Horrible Hindoo," which was about a Oriental gent and I thought
mebbe this was like it. But nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;. This Sheik
was a heavyweight champeen of Africa which is braver than most
birds, because he kidnaps a Jane which all others run from instead
of after. He&rsquo;s a regular bear-cat, caveman stuff,
<i>sabe</i>? And this dame falls in love with him for it. Of course
they marry and live happy forever after.</p>

<p>"Well," says I thoughtfully, crammin&rsquo; the book into the
stove, "I&rsquo;m out one and a half cartwheels and she&rsquo;s a
touchin&rsquo;, inspirin&rsquo; romance but she ain&rsquo;t
authentic; she ain&rsquo;t true to life. Not none. Now, me,
I&rsquo;ll write a book which is true to life. Th&rsquo; misguided
public needs it. It&rsquo;s me duty." So here goes.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Scene: The Desert.</i>
</p>

<p class="first">A THUNDER of horse-hoofs! A medley of yells.
Oriental yells! Venus Herring was in full flight across the desert.
She looked back. A tall handsome Arab on a magnificent mule was
pursuing her! Frantically she kicked her burro in the ribs. She was
spurred to greater efforts by the Arab&rsquo;s barbaric war-whoop,
"He-ya! Uneeda Takhoma Nabisco!"</p>

<p>She turned in her saddle and fired her elephant-gun. A miss! She
fired the other barrel. Another miss! Horrors! She could hit a barn
at three steps, flying. Why could she not hit that Arab?</p>

<p>As the Oriental drew up alongside, she swiped at him with the
stock of her rifle but he was wearing a high silk "Stove-pipe" hat
and the blow bounced harmlessly off.</p>

<p>The next moment he had walloped her across the head with the
handle of his spear and dragged her off her burro. He slung her
across his saddle and galloped away. She struggled and
screeched.</p>

<p>"Sit still, you little idiot!" he shouted, banging her nose
against the saddle horn.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Scene: The Sheik&rsquo;s Tent.</i>
</p>

<p class="first">"I AM the Sheik Ahmed!" announced the Arab,
throwing Venus into a corner.</p>

<p>"Amid what?" she asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Don&rsquo;t get fresh with me kiddo," he warned
[.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] the Sheik Ahmed ben Ahmed ben Whoopitup.</p>

<p>"I love you!" he continued, dragging her around the tent by the
hair. "You shall be mine!" slamming her down on the floor and
masterfully kicking her in the face.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, my dear," he ordered passionately massaging her
features with a pair of brass knucks.</p>

<p>"Never, you vile scoundrel!" she exclaimed, throwing a table at
him.</p>

<p>"Aha, you would, would you?" he cursed. "Evidently you
don&rsquo;t know who I am!" catching her by the neck and reaching
for a horse-whip.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Scene: Inside And Outside The Sheik&rsquo;s
Tent.</i>
</p>

<p class="first">VENUS HERRING yawned and reached for another
bon-bon. How long had she been in the Sheik&rsquo;s village? Three
weeks! Ye gods and little fishes! And not a movie the whole
time.</p>

<p>Outside, she could hear the Sheik&rsquo;s wild desert-raiders
engaged in some game. She could hear the click of the galloping
dominoes and the voices of the men, "Come seven!" "Phoebe, Ah
imploah&rsquo;s yo&rsquo; to save de family jewels!" "Yo&rsquo;s
faded." "Roll &rsquo;em, boy roll &rsquo;em."</p>

<p>She rose and stepped to the tent door. The Sheik was playing
marbles with the Frenchman, Gaston. (pronounced Gas-town.)</p>

<p>He scowled when he saw her.</p>

<p>"Beat it back into that tent," he ordered. "The sun will ruin
your complexion and I&rsquo;m not going to ride fifty miles to get
you another either soon."</p>

<p>"Villain!" she exclaimed, retreating in time to dodge the saddle
he hurled at her.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Scene: Outside And Inside The Sheik&rsquo;s
Tent.</i>
</p>

<p class="first">VENUS looked out the tent door. The Sheik was
striding up and down before the tent, speaking aloud:</p>

<p>"The bread Burns," he soliloquised, "the potatoes are Browning,
the sausage is a Longfellow; on the stove there is Bacon. What are
these Wordsworth?"</p>

<p>He entered the tent. He was in high spirit. He had been playing
keeps with Gaston and won seventeen taws. Then he had played
tiddledywinks with the Sultan of Turkey and had beaten him
forty-seven times, hand-running.</p>

<p>However, he scowled when he looked at Venus.</p>

<p>"I&rsquo;s tired of you," he announced. "I&rsquo;m going to send
you back to England."</p>

<p>"Ahmed!" she cried "Why, you couldn&rsquo;t do that?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he queried coolly.</p>

<p>"Please don&rsquo;t," she begged.</p>

<p>"You annoy me," he answered, hitting her with a chair.</p>

<p>She stepped to the door. "Gaston, come here!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, ma&rsquo;mselle, but why?" was the reply.</p>

<p>"To act as referee," she answered and turning she swung for the
Sheik&rsquo;s jaw. He warded and knocked her through the tent with
a left-handed punch. She returned and drove the Sheik across the
tent, hitting him with a right upper-cut, a left-hook and an
over-hand swing.</p>

<p>Just then Gaston tapped the gong.</p>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>Round Two</i>
</p>

<p>Venus leads with her right. The Sheik countered and let drive a
swing which Venus ducked, and slammed him with a right-and-left.
They clinched and Venus hammered the Sheik on the back of the neck
until he fainted. He rose at the count of eight and fought on the
defensive the rest of the round. The gong.</p>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>Round Three</i>
</p>

<p>Venus swung with her left. The Sheik side-stepped, feinted and
knocked Venus down with a left-uppercut. She got up at the count of
seven and clinched. They broke away and exchanged blows until the
gong.</p>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>Round Four</i>
</p>

<p>The Sheik leads with his left. Venus side-stepped and hit the
Sheik with a straight right, giving him a black eye. The Sheik
lifted Venus off the floor with a hay-maker. As she came down she
hit him with an over-hand swing, staggering him. Before he could
recover she swung for his jaw and knocked him out for the
count.</p>

<p>"Ah, ma&rsquo;mselle," exclaimed Gaston, "I take great pleasure
in presenting you the championship belt of the Sahara Desert."</p>

<p>"The pleasure is mostly mine," she responded. "Now, beat
it."</p>

<p>The Sheik opened his eyes, saw Venus and climbed the
tent-pole.</p>

<p>"Use discretion and be a nice girl," he begged.</p>

<p>"Come down from there," she commanded, knocking him from his
perch with a table.</p>

<p>"And you won&rsquo;t send me away?" she asked, wreathing her
fingers in his hair and poising a rolling-pin.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," he responded.</p>

<p>"My hero!" she exclaimed. "My Desert Lover!"</p>

<p class="first">"BE MINE, MY LOVE!" pleaded young Reginald
Adjernon Lancelot Montmorency to the beautiful Gwinivere de
Readycash, the lovely and accomplished heiress, daughter of old
Readycash, the multi-millionaire.</p>

<p>"Alas," she sighed; "It cannot be. My father does not like you.
Only today he mentioned you and made some remarks about you in a
language I took to be Greek for I could not understand it. And
there is the duke de Blooey from Montenegro. He is courting me and
father likes him because he can play checkers."</p>

<p>"I will call the scoundrel out," whooped Reginald passionately;
"he shall fight a duel with me!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" begged Gwinivere, clinging to her lover&rsquo;s
necktie; "you must not! I beg you!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my love!" replied Reggie, with great relief; "I knew
you would say so or I would not have&mdash;I mean it is a good
thing for the duke that I love you too much to disobey your
command. I will not force him into a duel."</p>

<p>He was silent for a few minutes, then "But what are we to
do?"</p>

<p>She chewed a cud of gum meditatively for several seconds. "Why
not ask father for me?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"I will," he exclaimed. "This very hour! I will be masterful
with him! I shall say, &lsquo;Sir, I am your new son-in-law. No
arguments now!&rsquo;&nbsp;"</p>

<p>"But don&rsquo;t harm him, Reggie!" she begged; "remember he is
my father."</p>

<p>"I will not touch him," he promised magnanimously; "I will quell
him with the power of my eye."</p>

<p>He rushed from the room. As he strode toward old
Readycash&rsquo;s study, he rehearsed the speech he would make. "I
will say, &lsquo;Sir, I am going to marry your daughter. Be silent,
sir! I have decided to do this and I will not be balked by a gouty
old father-in-law. I want you to understand that from now on I am
the master of this house. You may write out a check for ten
thousand dollars for our honeymoon.&rsquo; If he refuses and talks
impudently I may forget he is my future father-in-law and handle
him roughly."</p>

<p>He was now at the door of the study. He paused before it.
Glancing around, he found several cushions on chairs and sofas.
These he placed on the floor in front of the door. Then after
several attempts, he put on a bold front and knocked timidly on the
door. A deep, gruff voice from within said, "Come in!"</p>

<p>Reginald pushed open the door and entered cautiously. Old man
Readycash glared furiously at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it&rsquo;s you, eh? What the &mdash;&mdash; do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Why," replied Reginald, "I, er, you, er, that is, your girl, I
mean my girl, what I meant to say is that I, er she, you, er, that
is to say you."</p>

<p>"No doubt," old Readycash answered dryly, "have you anything
else to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Reginald with dignity, "you have a daughter&mdash;a
girl."</p>

<p>"Remarkable," exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>"As I said, sir," continued Reginald, ignoring the interruption,
"you have a daughter."</p>

<p>"I have several," was the reply; "also seven old maid sisters. I
will introduce them to you, if you like."</p>

<p>Reginald shuddered. "I ccccame ttto aaask yyou ffor your
daughter&rsquo;s, your daughter&rsquo;s, your
daughter&rsquo;s."</p>

<p>"My daughter&rsquo;s what?" roared old man Readycash.</p>

<p>"Hand!" gasped Reginald.</p>

<p>Old Readycash rose. "Would you just as soon take my foot?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Reggie fled. As he neared the door he was struck from behind by
a force that lifted him from his feet and propelled him
irresistibly through the door which was opened just then by a
well-dressed gentleman with a monocle and mustache. Reggie lit on
this gentleman and they rolled across the hall, until stopped by
the wall.</p>

<p>"Sapristi!" exclaimed the duke de Blooey (for it was he),
leaping to his feet. "Caramba! Le diable! Tamale! Asparagus tips! I
will have your life for this!"</p>

<p>Just at that moment old Readycash charged out of his room. "You
young villain!" he yelled at Reggie, "what do you mean by knocking
down my guests?"</p>

<p>Reggie fled toward the stairs. At the top step he felt the same
force that had sent him from the presence of Readycash. The young
man soared gracefully into the air and floated down the stairs.</p>

<p>"What!" yelled old Readycash; "you still here? Get out of my
house! And as for you," turning to the girl, "you shall marry the
duke this very day."</p>

<p>"But father," began Gwinivere.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" yelled old Readycash, brutally; "do you want me to
whip you?"</p>

<p>The duke seized her by the wrist. "Aha, me proud beauty," he
exclaimed, diabolically; "I have you in my power at last!"</p>

<p>"Unhand me, villain!" she cried.</p>

<p>At that moment the door flew open and two men rushed in. One was
a tall, thin man and the other a short stocky man.</p>

<p>They rushed upon the duke, knocked him down and handcuffed
him.</p>

<p>"Aha," exclaimed the tall man, "a duke now, are you, eh?"</p>

<p>"What does this mean, sir?" asked old Readycash.</p>

<p>"This man is a crook in disguise," the tall man answered. "I
have followed him half across the world. You see before you," he
continued, kicking off the duke&rsquo;s mustache and monocle,
"Booze Bill, the Bowery Bum! One of the slickest crooks on
record."</p>

<p>"Curses," hissed the duke. "One thousand curses. Ay, one
thousand five hundred curses!"</p>

<p>"As for you, sir," the stranger continued, to old Readycash,
"your daughter wants to marry this young man," indicating Reggie,
"and you give him your consent and your check for &pound;10,000.
Also a check for the same amount to me as a token of your gratitude
in preventing you from marrying your daughter to a villain. If you
do not I will send you to jail for 2,000 years. I used to drink my
beer at Dinty Moore&rsquo;s saloon when you were bartender there
and you often shortchanged me." Then to the short man, "Take the
prisoner outside and call a cab, Colonel; I will follow
presently."</p>

<p>"But, who are you?" asked old Readycash, as he reached for his
checkbook and Reggie and Gwinivere fell into each other&rsquo;s
arms, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"I?" answered the stranger with a smile; "I am Hawkshaw, the
Detective."</p>

Detective</a></h3>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<p class="first">A BLAZING SUN blazed out of a blazing sky and
blazed down blazingly on a blazing expanse of blazing, barren sand,
in a blazing desert.</p>

<p>Naught was to be seen except sand dunes. And yet, aha! A long
caravan of camels emerged from behind a sand dune and meandered
along the ancient desert trail which was ancient before the memory
of man. Aye, it was even said that the trail had been made before
William Jennings Bryan began to run for president.</p>

<p>The Tuareg chieftain looked about him with a sneer on his
handsome face. With contempt he gazed at the sand dunes. Somehow he
felt superior to them. Presently the caravan stopped by an ancient
city, half-hidden beneath the sands of the desert. It was almost
ruins. A very ancient city; it had been deserted long before
Congress began to discuss the immigration problem, even.</p>

<p>The Taureg dismounted from his camel and entered his tent. A
slave girl offered him a chaw of Beech-nut from her own private
plug. He kicked her with a harsh tone of voice.</p>

<p>Seating himself on an expensive divan from Bokhara, he reflected
meditatively.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="first">"ONE MILLION DOLLARS," mused the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Exactly, my dear Colonel," returned Hawkshaw, the great
detective, wittily.</p>

<p>"But what details of the crime?"</p>

<p>"As follows," Hawkshaw replied. "The night watchman of the
Stacksuhkale bank, London, was knocked unconscious and a million
dollars in American thrift-stamps as well as one million pounds of
sterling and a box of fine cigars were taken."</p>

<p>"The villain!" exclaimed the Colonel indignantly. "And cigars as
expensive as they are.</p>

<p>"How are you going to go about finding the guilty person?" asked
the Colonel.</p>

<p>"In the following manner," answered Hawkshaw. "Let us first
begin by deduction. Let us say, for example, that three persons
have robbed the bank. You, I, or the Khedive of Egypt. Now it is
impossible that you could commit the robbery because at the time
the robbery was committed you were playing a foursome of
tiddledy-winks with the duke of Buckingham."</p>

<p>"That&rsquo;s true but how did you know?" exclaimed the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"My dear Colonel," answered Hawkshaw, "I saw the crumbs on your
opera hat. Now, as for myself, I could not have done the robbery
because I was in a theatre in Drury Lane. I almost distinctly
remember the play even. It was called &lsquo;The Store-keeper of
Venice&rsquo; and was written by a fellow named Shooksbeer or
something, who is a native of Algeria.</p>

<p>"Then, consider the Khedive of Egypt, he could not have
committed the robbery because he was on his sugar-moon, I mean his
molasses-moon, with his 999999999999999999th wife, hunting social
lions, lounge-lizards, zebras and other big game, in the wilds of
Schenectady, New York. And, having eliminated myself, you and the
Khedive, do you see what this points to?"</p>

<p>"No," the Colonel answered.</p>

<p>"It indicates that the robbery was done by someone else!" said
Hawkshaw, dramatically.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the Colonel in admiration. "Awhaw!
Wonderful!"</p>

<p>"I shall now," Hawkshaw continued, "go into the street and
arrest everyone I meet. To each I shall put the question:
&lsquo;Did you rob the Stacksuhkale bank or did you not?&rsquo; and
I shall be governed by their answers."</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="first">"CURSES!" hissed Alexichsky
Grooglegoofgiveimoffaswiftsky&shy;kickovitchinsky&shy;therearo&shy;vitchsky.</p>

<p>"Curses!" Alexichsky, etc., hissed again even more hissier than
before. "This nation of England shall fall or my name is not
A&rsquo;sky Majlmp." (Giving the correct pronunciation of the name
Alexichsky, etc.)</p>

<p>The anarchist, with great stealth, then placed a bomb under a
girls&rsquo; school.</p>

<p>"There," he hissed, "that be a defeat to the accursed
burgwassol!"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* burgwassol: bourgeoisie ]</p>

<p>After going several blocks he stopped with an enraged look in
his coat pocket.</p>

<p>"Ten billion imprecations!" he hissed, "I forgot to light the
fuse."</p>

<p>He walked on through London.</p>

<p>Presently the anarchist came to a palatial mansion in the slums
which was the clubhouse of all the anarchists in London.</p>

<p>He walked up to the door and rang the old fashioned
doorknocker.</p>

<p>"Giff der pass-vord," hissed a voice from within.</p>

<p>"The wages of sin are a mansion on Riverside Drive," answered
the anarchist. The door swung open and he entered. There were
several members of the Anarchist Club in the club room, engaged in
anarchist past times, such as swinging ginger-ale, playing marbles
for keeps, growing whiskers and cussing the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Feeling in a reckless mood, Alexichsky spent a nickel for
ginger-ale and offered to bet three cents either way on the next
Olympic games. One of the club members, Heinie Von Shtoofe, then
made a speech.</p>

<p>"Vass iss?" he began eloquently. "Vot iss der nation goming do
evn der cost of hog-iron, I mean pig-iron iss gone up two cents on
der vard, alretty yet? Und vot for iss so may Irisher loafers
getting chobs ven vhite men like me can&rsquo;t, yet? I haf meet a
Irisher on der street und I say, &lsquo;Get oudt of mine way, you
no-good bumf!&rsquo; Und look at der black eye vot he giffs me. Dey
say dot Irishers is such goot fighters, Bah! Dot makes me tired
feel. Vhy, over to Gretchen&rsquo;s vedding, dot drunken
O&rsquo;Hooligan come in und tried to raise it a rough-house und me
und my cousin, Abie, und Ludvig und Hands und four or five others,
vhy ve pretty threw dot Irishman right oudt of der house! I vont
never go to Ireland."</p>

<p>The anarchists applauded and then Alexichsky proposed a toast,
"Down with everything! Long live Lendnine and Lopesky and hurrah
for Russia!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br>
"Brittania Rules the Waves"</h3>

<p class="first">AS ALEXICHSKY the anarchist walked down Piccadilly
Circus, he glanced about hoping to see a bank that he could
rob.</p>

<p>As he came into another street, two men accosted him, one a
tall, thin man, and the other a short, stocky man.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Hawkshaw, for it was he, "Methinks yon unshaven
Russian with the cannibalistic face has the guilty look of a
first-class criminal."</p>

<p>The detective stopped Alexichsky, "Wait a moment, my friend,
pause while I gaze on your un-handsome visage and ask you a
question or three or four."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Alexichsky, having swiftly selected a
fiendish sneer from his extensive collection of mocking smiles,
derisive leers, glares, dirty looks, unholy mirth, chuckles,
diabolical stares, etc.</p>

<p>"Did you rob the Stacksuhkale bank?" asked Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>"No," answered Alexichsky.</p>

<p>"Dern it," said the Colonel, "Baffled again."</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Hawkshaw, "My Russian friend, you are under
arrest."</p>

<p>The Russian was seized by policemen and Scotland Yard
detectives.</p>

<p>Brittania (<i>sic</i>)rules the waves," said Mr. Hawkshaw,
"another triumph for Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>He addressed Alexichsky, "I knew you were telling a falsehood
because when you denied robbing the bank, you raised an eyebrow and
wiggled your toes. Also, I had suspicions of you when you asked the
inspector of Scotland Yard if they found a set of burglar&rsquo;s
tools in the Stacksuhkale bank. You said they were yours and if
they were found to deliver them to the Anarchist&rsquo;s Clubhouse.
I delivered them myself, disguised as a rear admiral of the Swiss
army. Then when I saw the million dollar notes and thrift-stamps in
your vest pocket, I took a chance and arrested you."</p>

<p>"Curses," cussed Alexichsky.</p>

<p>"The way you robbed the bank was in the following manner," said
Hawkshaw. "You came to the bank, disguised as a king of the South
Sea islands. You climbed up the fire escape and down one of the
marble pillars of the bank front. Then, having taken an impression
of the keyhole with wax, you filed out a key to fit, from a cigar
made in Dusseldorf, Germany. Then you entered and robbed the bank.
Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"No, the watchman had left the door open and I went up the back
steps and walked in," answered the Russian.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<p class="first">The Eskimo floundered through the deep snow and
kicked an iceberg out of his way. Reaching his igloo, he
unharnessed his team of whales from his sled and entered the
igloo.</p>

<p>Snow covered the land, yards deep. Here and there mighty
icebergs reared up toward the sky.</p>

<p>For it was mid-summer in northern Alaska.</p>

How&rsquo;d you get in?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY:<br>
I walked!</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">BERTIE:<br>
All the way?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY:<br>
Naw. It was this way. I&rsquo;d grab every train that came along,
then when the conductor would come for my ticket, I&rsquo;d tell
him I&rsquo;d lost it. They&rsquo;d kick me off, but I&rsquo;d be
that much further down the line. I did that seven times and made
four miles that way. But finally one of &rsquo;em stopped the
train, &rsquo;stead of throwin&rsquo; me off while it was
runnin&rsquo; like the rest had done.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">BERTIE:<br>
That was kind of him.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY, bloodthirsty:<br>
Yeah, I&rsquo;ll say so! They stopped in a yap town and had me
pinched. They put me in the hoosegow and I&rsquo;d be there yet
only the cop was a Prohibition officer and was so drunk he did not
lock the door. Then I walked about twelve miles till I caught a
ride on a wagon.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">BERTIE:<br>
That shows that there&rsquo;s always people kind and ready to
assist even a hobo. Why didn&rsquo;t you ride on it?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY:<br>
Because the bird driving the wagon saw me and kicked me off. Then I
walked and walked and walked, and then I walked some more. I got
blisters on my feet till it felt like I was walking on
watermelons.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">BERTIE:<br>
Did it rain all the time?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY:<br>
Naw, sometimes it sleeted or snowed. The roads were so rotten that
I waded three miles down a creek thinking it was a road. I
didn&rsquo;t find my mistake till a farmer came and beat me up for
trespassing on private property. Once I got lost and walked
seventeen miles in the opposite direction before I found out
different. (<i>He waxes eloquent</i>) Gaze on me; a living example
of the injustice of the American railroad corporations. I wore out
my shoes and swiped these off a sleeping hobo; I lived on standpipe
julep* and garbage. My clothes are worn out and I lost the ring for
which I paid Woolworth a week&rsquo;s salary. And they call this a
free country!</p>

<p style="text-indent:0">TOMMY:<br>

ataletics musical entertainments missionaries or vot have you? Ha,
a feller come by me which says, "Dough you should give by the
missionary fund which is educating the Chinese and the Zulus to
wear hose-supporters and play golf and be Rotarians yets." I says,
"How much money would you be satisfied by?" He says, "Anyways a
dollar yet." Oy, Oy, such extravagance, a cheaper missionary they
should have. What if the Zulus get educated it goes no money in my
pocket yet. Better they could spend some money educating with
civilizing these Irish already. You know Zara, it don&rsquo;t pay
none to tell a strange things, so when a big Irishman says to me,
"And what moight your name be?" (You know, Zara, these couldnt talk
English no more like nothing) I thinks, "None of your business that
aint any." So I says, "I come from the same part of Ireland vot you
come from, yet." And the big loafer pokes me on the nose.</p>

<p class="letter">But I am proud of my nationality Zara, I&rsquo;m
American citizen, even if I was born in Czecho-Slavakia, or was it
Ukrania or Sweden? I don&rsquo;t just remember. But confidentially
Zara, colletch would be good business if it wasnt so expensive yet.
The other day it went by a teacher about the plagues of Egypt yet,
which she said, "all of the Egyptian went broke on account of the

<h2><a id="juv9" name="juv9">THE THESSALIANS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Yellow Jacket</i><br>
(the newspaper of Howard Payne College),<br>
January 13, 1927</h3>

<p class="first">Some acting clubs might have it over the
Thessalian Artists for fancy stuff, but when it comes to straight
acting, no fakes nor hitting in the clinches, we took the celluloid
frying pan. Hipurbilee Jones was our manager and the old fellow was
as slick as any in the country. We put on a few performances at
Millford and then started on a tour of theatrical engagements. It
was high class stuff, no second rate vaudeville; we played
Shakespeare, Marlowe, Goethe, and some of the moderns. Also we put
on some original plays designed by our leading lady, Miss Arimenta
Gepps. Two of these, "Was it Love?" and "The Crimson Red Scarlet,"
always went over big and we used one of them for our last
night&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>Things didn&rsquo;t always run so smooth though, and just now
I&rsquo;m thinking about a performance we gave in a bush league
town in Nevada. "One Night Only" it was billed, and it was a good
thing for us. We were playing "The Woman of the Mask" an original
play of four acts, written by Ephraim Jube, our poetical "heavy."
It was a hot sketch, full of mystic doings, secret loves and sudden
murders, all about kings and lords, with countesses and princesses
mixed in with reckless profusion.</p>

<p>The town "Opery House" as the yokels called it, was filled to
the guards. Everything was going fine except that some windows were
out and the wind kept whistling through and blowing the false
whiskers off Alonzo Chub who was the King of Keramusa in the play.
But altogether the play was a success with the exception of a scene
in the second act when Chub&rsquo;s crown accidentally fell off and
landing on the leading lady&rsquo;s toe, caused her to make some
remarks that weren&rsquo;t a part of the dialogue.</p>

<p>As the fourth act commenced, old Hipurbilee Jones came bustling
up behind the scenes, saying that we&rsquo;d have to make a night
run, as the town had only one train a week and that left just
twelve minutes after our performance was concluded. He&rsquo;d had
all the luggage loaded on except what we were using and as soon as
the curtain fell, we were to hurry up to change our costumes and
beat it for the station. We never liked to stay in a town any
longer after a show than we had to, owing to the short-changing
proclivities of Hank Jepson the ticket seller, and also to habits
of Somolia States, the property man, who had a way of collecting
pocket books when the owners weren&rsquo;t looking. So we told
Belle Jimsonwee, our star dancer, to quit taking so many encores
between acts, and Hipurbilee went off saying he&rsquo;d have the
critters put on the train. The company had a small menagerie which
was used sometimes in light comedies, including a rattlesnake, a
couple of pink mice, some guinea pigs and Aurelious, the scentless
skunk.</p>

<p>Came the dawn of a new act; the fourth to be exact. Now in this
act a little light comedy was to be instilled by the king&rsquo;s
jester soaking the villain with a stuffed shillelagh. Naturally,
the aforesaid shillaily had been misplaced, and as time approached,
we were forced to find some substitute. The jester wanted to use a
section of curtain pole, but Ephraim waxed oratorical on the
subject and as usual, Somolia States rose to heights of
ingeniousness and procured a three foot length of bologna sausage.
It was to be concealed behind a screen and at the moment of use,
the jester would reach back, seize it and massage Ephraim
Jube&rsquo;s poetic cranium with it. Meanwhile the rest of us were
scurrying hither and yon, mostly yon behind the scenes, packing
used costumes and so on. The moment came, the audience leaned
forward expectantly, scenting amusement the jester made a grab for
the bologna and swung for Ephraim&rsquo;s jaw&mdash;a cat had
wandered in and was nibbling at the sausage and when the jester
brought it forth, she was clinging to the other end. As the bologna
described the arc intended, she lost her hold and with the screech
of a lost soul, went sailing through the air, completing her flight
in the mayor&rsquo;s face, who sat on the front row. A pitched
battle ensued, from which the cat fled, routed but victorious and
the mayor got up and used language and made some wise cracks about
law suits. However, we stopped the play long enough for the leading
lady to apologize in her most bewitching manner and the old coot
smirked and bowed and sat down again, whereupon we went on with the
play. But Alonzo Chub made it a point of honor never to let a play
go without pulling some bonehead. This time he was helping Somolia
do up a stage carpet behind the scenes, and he backed out onto the
stage into an impassioned love scene. Unknowing, he stood there
like a yap, with his back to the audience, engrossed in his task,
and totally unaware that he was out on the stage. Somolia started
to roast him, when a budding genius in the audience put a hornet*
in a nigger-shooter&dagger; and let &rsquo;er go. The hornet buzzed
through the air a lot faster than he&rsquo;d ever flown, he hit
Alonzo&rsquo;s pants and hit end-on. Alonzo let out a squeal,
climbed halfway up the screens, made a few impassioned gestures and
left via the window. His shouts of "Fire!" came floating back for
seven blocks. The audience rose as one man and applauded
generously, and about that time a masked figure came running out on
the stage. "Holy cat!" said Algernon Repples, the hero, "What does
she mean? This ain&rsquo;t the time for unmasking?" For the great
scene that revealed the masked lady came just before the curtain
fell.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* hornet: a small wad of paper; &dagger;
nigger-shooter: a slingshot.]</p>

<p>"You gotta, now." say Somolia, so Algernon, rushes forward,
jerks off the mask and reveals the bibulous and hilarious
countenance of Augustus Buff, scene shifter, who was lit like a
power-plant. Just at that moment a feminine yowl from behind the
screen announced that Miss Arimenta Gepps had discovered that she
had been euchred out of an act, and was letting her artistic
temperament go on the rampage.</p>

<p>Somolia likewise gives a yell and Algernon swings on Augustus
who takes a nose dive into the orchestra, completely ruining two
fiddles and a mouth organ.</p>

<p>And amidst the confusion a small demure critter saunters in the
door and starts promenading up the aisles.</p>

<p>Somolia allows that it&rsquo;s Aurelious, the violet scented
skunk and goes burning the breeze down the aisle to chase him out.
But a few feet away, he stops with a most curious expression on his
face. Then he &rsquo;bout-faces and heads the other way. For it
wasn&rsquo;t Aurelious, no, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The town people had bragged that the opera house could be
emptied in three minutes but this time the record was broken by two
minutes and thirty seconds.</p>

<p>And any one who&rsquo;d been on the streets, might have been
edified by the sight of a company of high-class actors breaking
Nurmi&rsquo;s* best records three jumps ahead of a ravening mob
that wanted to lynch us, or such absurdity.</p>

<p class="footnote">[*The Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi (1897-1973)
who was the world's best middle and long distance runner at the
time of writing. ]</p>

<p>The train pulled out just as we climbed aboard and I doubt if
any of us ever go back there. In fact, I think it very improbably.
Very.</p>

<h2><a id="juv10" name="juv10">YE COLLEGE DAYS</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The Yellow Jacket</i><br>
(the newspaper of Howard Payne College),<br>
January 20, 1927</h3>

<p class="first">"YES" said the ancient Grad, manufacturing a
cigarette of T.N.T. and igniting it with a stick of dynamite.
"There&rsquo;s no doubt but the present day college student has it
over the boys and girls of my day for advantages. But I doubt if
they take advantage of them as they should.</p>

<p>"Now I don&rsquo;t believe there ever was a peppier flock of
students than we were at Killem Kollege. Talk about class spirit!
It was rather rough going for the freshmen the first few terms. But
we never made them go to the expense of buying green caps, no, we
simply scalped them, so they could be properly classified. I
remember one freshman thought to fool us&mdash;but we sand papered
his head each week.</p>

<p>"Fact, it took a tough freshman to complete a term in Killem
Kollege, and had it not been for the loyalty and support of the
surrounding country and the alumni association, I don&rsquo;t know
but what the school might have had to shut down for lack of
students. But new ones constantly came in to replace those who had
spoken insolently to upperclassmen.</p>

<p>"Speaking personally, I had little difficulty in my freshman
year at college, having spent my last seven vacations in the
revolutionary armies of Central America and Mexico, and having
attended a prep school personally conducted by John L. Sullivan I
had been champion tiger trainer in my class, and held medals for
sharp-shooting and for outdoing elephants in feats of strength, so
I was prepared to enter Killem Kollege with the best. However, a
rather hectic time was had of it."</p>

<p>He displayed a cork foot and wig, remarking, "Relics of my
freshman days.</p>

<p>"Back in those days," he continued, "there was intense rivalry
between colleges. Ah, it would have done your soul good to have
seen the preparation for a coming football game: the yell meetings,
the cheerings, the rifle practice, the sharpening of swords and
greasing of pistols.</p>

<p>"And then the game. And the parade of triumph after the carnage!
How we would march about the streets, displaying the tokens of
victory on spears&mdash;the scalps of the opposing team.</p>

<p>"I especially recall the game with Slaughterem University. They
sent a special boat loaded with students. With our usual courtesy,
we met them at the wharfs and such as survived the reception
committee were disposed of by the main student body at the football
field. It was a hotly contested battle, that football game. And I
must commend the school spirit of the girls&rsquo; pep squad, who
rushed out on the field between halves and slaughtered the wounded
of the opposing team, with meat axes.</p>

<p>"The score was, I think, Killem Kollege forty slain, seventy
wounded, Slaughterem University, a hundred slain, thirty wounded.
They outplayed the Killem team the first half, maintaining a long
range barrage, but the second half the Killem team made a flank
attack and getting into close range brought into play their light
field-pieces which they used so effectively that the enemy was
completely routed.</p>

<p>"Lynchum and Burnum always gave us something of a battle, one
year their students took possession of one half of the field in
full force, and kept up a hot rifle first on Killem team from the
bleachers, until a bomb thrown by our yell leader effectually
silenced them. Thereupon we won the game.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a great deal of rivalry. I recall, one day in a
class of philosophy, the professor glanced out the window and
exclaimed: &lsquo;Gentlemen, barricade the doors and man the
windows; the botany class of Kannibal Kollege are upon us. Girls
will kindly stand by to load rifles, and let us dispose of these
visitors with as much expedience as possible, so we may continue
our study of the tenets of the Golden Rule.&rsquo;</p>

<p>"At another time we were returning from a successful raid on a
neighboring college, when the senior class of Slaughterem
University made a sudden night march and the next morning were
shown barricaded in the administration building, holding the
college president for ransom.</p>

<p>"Upon our refusal to pay the ransom, they hung him from the
cupola, affording great amusement to all of us. However, we merely
blew the building up, instead of storming it, levying funds from
the surrounding villages to rebuild it.</p>

<p>"Killem Kollege always had a large attendance, but the exact
total shifted continuously, owning to the intense class spirit, the
hot rivalry between fraternities, and the number of debating clubs.
The attendance of the freshman class was dependant entirely almost,
on the price of ammunition."</p>

<p>He took up an advertizing card, yellow with age, and read:
"Tonight the Bandits and Buccaneers debating clubs will hold their
weekly debate, the subject to be debated upon, &lsquo;Resolved that
cordite powder is more effective than British powder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>"The rules of the debate are as follows: debaters will stand
back to back, march twelve steps in opposite directions, turn and
fire at the word. There will be seven judges and in the event of a
dispute, they may fight it out between themselves. The survivors of
the debate will debate again next week, the subject being,
&lsquo;Whether the bayonet is more effective than the sabre in hand
to hand combat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>"That was a great debating team," said he. "I believes that was
the night we burned the freshman president at the stake."</p>

<p>He was silent a while, then shrugged his shoulders, "I suppose
I&rsquo;m too old fashioned, for the college today. Still I
don&rsquo;t feel just exactly as if I&rsquo;d been according the
proper treatment by the members of the faculty. The president and I
had had words in regard as to the disposal of some college
funds&mdash;buying a cannon for the boys&rsquo; dormitory, I think,
and I went to the college for the first time in several years. In a
way, it was like old times. Several fresh scalps adorned the campus
posts. From the girls&rsquo; dormitory came the shrieks of a new
girl who was being skinned by some upperclass girls. Two members of
rival fraternities were exchanging shots from behind trees across
the campus; and as I entered the college boundaries, members of the
faculty, mistaking me for the dean of a neighboring college, opened
fire on me from the windows of the fine arts building.</p>

<p>"After reloading, I made my way to the administration building.
But I must say that I was not met with the cordiality a man has a
right to expect from a college from which he graduated, and to the
treatment of which he has always contributed.</p>

<p>"I am not referring to the various attempts made upon me as I
walked up the steps of the college, nor to the fact that I was
forced to dispose of the janitor before I could enter. I simply
considered that such trifles but reflected the sound loyal
principles upon which the college had been founded. No, I did not
especially object to those little attentions, nor to the fact that
I was forced to demolish three machine guns nests before reaching
the wing of the building occupied by the president. But when the
president himself suddenly leaped upon me from a secluded corner
and swung for me with a broad axe, hacking down a door when he
missed, I considered it no less than a breach of etiquette. I think
the position of president is still vacant. Doubtless I am hasty in
forming my conclusions, but until I have been formally apologized
to by the college, I shall refrain from taking any part in its
activities."</p>

<h2><a id="juv11" name="juv11">CUPID <small>VS.</small> POLLUX</a>
</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Yellow Jacket</i>, February 10, 1927</h3>

<p style="text-indent:0">AS I am coming up the steps of the
fraternity house, I meet Tarantula Soons, a soph with an ingrown
disposition and a goggle eye.</p>

<p>"You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; for Spike, I take it?" said he, and
upon me admittin&rsquo; the fact, he gives me a curious look and
remarks that Spike is in his room.</p>

<p>I go up, and all the way up the stairs, I hear somebody chanting
a love song in a voice that is incitement to justifiable homicide.
Strange as it seems, this atrocity is emanating from Spike&rsquo;s
room, and as I enter, I see Spike himself, seated on a divan, and
singing somethin&rsquo; about lovers&rsquo; moons and soft, red
lips. His eyes are turned soulfully toward the ceiling and he is
putting great feeling in the outrageous bellow which he imagines is
the height on melody. To say I am surprized is putting it mildly
and as Spike turns and says "Steve, ain&rsquo;t love wonderful?"
you could have knocked me over with a pile-driver. Besides standing
six feet and seven inches and scaling upwards of 270 pounds, Spike
has a map that makes Firpo look like an ad for the fashionable man,
and is neitherto about as sentimental as a rhinoceros.</p>

<p>"Yeh? And who is he?" I ask sarcastically, but he only sighs
amorously and quotes poetry. At that I fizz over.</p>

<p>"So that&rsquo;s why you ain&rsquo;t to the gym training!" I
yawp. "You big chunka nothin&rsquo;, the tournament for the
intercollegiate boxin&rsquo; title comes off tomorrow and here you
are, you overgrown walrus, sentimentaliin&rsquo; around like a
three year old yearlin&rsquo; calf."</p>

<p>"G&rsquo;wan," says he, tossin&rsquo; a haymakin&rsquo; right to
my jaw in an absentminded manner, "I can put over any them palukas
without no trainin&rsquo;."</p>

<p>"Yes," I sneers, climbin&rsquo; to my wobbling&rsquo; feet, "and
when you stack up against Monk Gallranan you won&rsquo;t need any
trainin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s a cinch."</p>

<p>"Boxin&rsquo;," says the infatuated boob, "is degradin&rsquo;. I
bet she thinks so. I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll even enter
the tourneyment or not."</p>

<p>"Hey!" I yells. "After all the work I&rsquo;ve done
getting&rsquo; you in shape. You figurin&rsquo; on throwin&rsquo;
the college down?"</p>

<p>"Aw, go take a run around the block," says Spike, drawing back
his lip in an ugly manner.</p>

<p>"G&rsquo;wan, you boneheaded elephant!" says I, drivin&rsquo; my
left to the wrist in his solar plexus and the battle was on.
Anyway, at the conclusion, I yelled up to him from the foot of the
stairs "where the college will be too small for you."</p>

<p>His sole answer was to slam the door so hard that he shook the
house but the next day when I was lookin&rsquo; for a substitute
for the heavyweight entries, the big yam appears, with a smug and
self satisfied look on his map.</p>

<p>"I&rsquo;ve decided to fight, Steve," he says grandly. "She will
have a ringside seat and women adore physical strength and power
allied to manly beauty."</p>

<p>"All right," says I, "get into your ring togs. Your bout is the
main event of the day and will come last."</p>

<p>This managing a college boxing show is no cinch. If things go
wrong, the manager gets the blame and if things don&rsquo;t, the
fighters get the hand. I remember once I even substituted for a
welterweight entry who didn&rsquo;t show up. Just to give the fans
a run for their money, I lowered my guard the third round and
invited my antagonist to hit me&mdash;&shy;he did&mdash;&shy; they
were four hours bringing me to and the fact that it was discovered
he had a horseshoe concealed in his glove didn&rsquo;t increase my
regard for the game. They&rsquo;ve got the horseshoe in the museum
now, but it isn&rsquo;t much to look at as a horseshoe, being bent
all out of shape where it came in contact with my jaw.</p>

<p>But to get back to the tournament. The college Spike and I
represented had indifferent fortune in the first bouts; our
featherweight entry won the decision on points and our flyweight
tied with a fellow from St. Janice&rsquo;s. As usual, heavyweights
being scarce, Spike and Monk Gallranan from Burke&rsquo;s
University were the only entries. This gorilla is nearly as tall
and heavy as Spike, and didn&rsquo;t make the football team on
account of his habit of breaking the arms and legs of the team in
practice scrimmage. He is even more prehistoric looking than Spike,
so you can imagine what those two cavemen looked like when they
squared off together. Spike was jubilant, however, at the chance of
distinguishing himself in an athletic way, he having always been
too lazy to come out for football and the like. And this girl was
there in a seat on the front row. The bout didn&rsquo;t last long
so I don&rsquo;t know a better way than to give it round by round.
What those two saps didn&rsquo;t know about the finer points of
boxin&rsquo; would fill several encyclopedias, but I&rsquo;d had a
second rate for giving Spike some secret instructions on
infightin&rsquo;, and I expected him to win by close range work,
infightin&rsquo; bein&rsquo; a lost art to the average amateur.</p>

<h3>ROUND 1</h3>

<p>Spike missed a left for the head and Monk sent a left to the
body. Spike put a right to the face and got three left jabs to the
nose in return. They traded rights to the body, and Monk staggered
Spike with a sizzlin&rsquo; left to the wind. Monk missed with a
right and they clinched. Spike nailed Monk with a straight right to
the jaw at the break. Monk whipped a left to the head and a right
to the body and Spike rocked him back on his heels with a straight
left to the face.</p>

<h3>ROUND 2</h3>

<p>Monk missed a right but slammed a left to the jaw. They clinched
and Spike roughed in close. Monk staggered Spike on the break with
a right to the jaw. Monk drove Spike across the ring with lefts and
rights to head and body. Spike covered up, then kicked through with
a right uppercut to the jaw that nearly tore Monk&rsquo;s head off.
Monk clinched and Spike punished him with short straight rights to
the body. Just at the gong Spike staggered Monk with a left hook to
the jaw.</p>

<h3>ROUND 3</h3>

<p>Monk blocked Spike&rsquo;s left lead and uppercut him three
times to the jaw. Spike swung wild and Monk staggered him with a
straight right to the jaw. Another straight right started him
bleeding at the lips. Spike came out of it with a fierce rally and
drove Monk to the ropes with a series of short left hooks to the
wind and head. Monk launched an attack of his own and battered
Spike to the middle of the ring where they stood toe to toe,
trading smashes to head and body. Monk started a fierce rush and a
straight left for the jaw. Spike ducked, let the punch slide over
his shoulder, and crossed his right to Monk&rsquo;s jaw, and Monk
hit the mat. Just as the referee reached "Nine" the gong
sounded.</p>

<p>Monk&rsquo;s seconds worked over him but he was still groggy as
he came out for the fourth round. I shouted for Spike to finish him
quick, but be careful.</p>

<p>Spike stepped up, warily; they sparred for a second, then Spike
stepped in and sank his left to the wrist in Monk&rsquo;s solar
plexus, following up with a right to the button that would have
knocked down a house. Monk hit the mat and lay still.</p>

<p>Then Spike, the boob, turns his back on his fallen foeman and
walks over to the ropes smilin&rsquo; and bowin&rsquo;. He opens
his mouth to say somethin&rsquo; to his girl&mdash;and Monk, who
has risen meanwhile, beating the count, lifts his right from the
floor and places it squarely beneath Spike&rsquo;s sagging jaw. The
referee could have counted a million.</p>

<p>But afterwards Spike says to me, sitting on the ring floor,
still in his ring togs, he says, "Steve, girls is a lotta hokum.
I&rsquo;m offa &rsquo;em," he says.</p>

<p>Says I, "Then if you&rsquo;ve found that out, it&rsquo;s worth
the soakin&rsquo; you got," I says.</p>

was astonished to note various celebrities, viz: Harvey Stanford,
Geeo, and other constellations equally scintillant in the college
sky, risking their lives, limbs, manners and morals in a dare-devil
game which has begun to find favor in the eyes of the students, and
which is known as pitchin&rsquo; horseshoes. To the uninitiated, I
might say that this game consists in securing a metal article of
clothing which at one time adorned the pedal extremity of an equine
quadruped, first; next, the deluded victim of this vice, firmly
clutching said implement, brandishes it in a most reckless manner
and having whirled it above his head a few times, shuts his eyes
and hurls it in the general direction of a small peg or stake set
in the grass for that purpose. Having exhausted all the horseshoes
in the neighbourhood in that manner, the gamesters recollect them
from the stake, from the trees and the ankles of passersby, and
continue in the same manner. The science of the game consists in
making rash statements, disallowing your antagonist&rsquo;s claims,
and arguing at the top of your voice.</p>

<p>Naturally, afterwards, as I took my siesta, I dreamed, and was
wafted into the future several years. Just what part of the world
was the scene, I do not know, but I found myself stealing
stealthily along a deserted street, somewhere, glancing askancely
anon and ever, there and here. Then from a dusky side street, a man
emerged and approached me. As he drew near I was astonished to
recognize a former schoolmate, Travis Curtis by name. There was a
sly and furtive look upon his somewhat haggard countenance and I
observed to my surprise that he had grown older in the twenty years
that had elapsed since he had fled to Europe with the Republican
campaign funds. Approaching me, he fixed me with a shifty eye and
hissed the magic word, cautiously, "Limeade!"</p>

<p>I started, naturally, for the 98th Amendment had made it illegal
to even think about such depraved beverages. However, my friend had
turned and was gliding down another street, evidently expecting me
to follow, so I did so, and after traversing a number of dingy side
streets, he stopped at a disreputable looking tenement house. There
he whistled a jazz tune outlawed by the 74th Amendment, and the
door swung slowly back. A face I recognized as belonging to Lloyd
Nixon peered out warily: "Give me the pass word!" he hissed.</p>

<p>"Dancing Lessons" came the blood curdling and entirely illegal
reply. (See Amendment No. 29) The door keeper stepped back and we
entered. We passed through a shadowy hallway, and then to my
amazement entered such a place as I had never dreamed existed in
the modern world. Carefully curtained so no light would betray its
being, a great hallway flaunted the vice of a bygone age before my
scandalized vision. Upon one side a cold drink fountain ran the
full length of the house, and there leering youths served smuggled
coco cola, lemon phosphate and cream sodas to the debauched mob
that swarmed about it like lost souls. Turning from this sodden and
shameful scene, I saw various couples engaged in games long ago
forbidden. Ah, it was a harrowing sight. Just as if the world had
been transported back to those days of vice and sin some twenty
years ago before the Prevention of Everything League made the world
safe for Democracy by abolishing golf, soft drinks and hair
nets.</p>

<p>Here and there I saw acquaintances of mine: Honk Irving was
drinking a lemon milkshake in a most abandoned manner; Driscoll
Smith was eating candy; and as I looked a bar-tender set a rare
bottle of hair tonic upon the bar and Carl Macon with a hideous
leer, seized it and applied it to his beard, laughing fiendishly.
There in a corner sat Harvey Stanford and Vic Urban engaged in a
game of&mdash;I shudder to repeat it&mdash;Checkers! Vice was free,
brazen and unchecked, and I thought of how some of them had
appeared twenty years ago, proud, strong handsome young men, just
launching their ships upon the seas of Destiny&mdash;and now,
depraved slaves of chocolates, sodas and tiddlywinks, followers of
secret sins and forbidden vices! Just then somebody sprang upon the
bar, and shouted something, whereupon the inhabitants of that
Unknown Temple of iniquity rushed to the center of the house with
yowls and yells of depraved delight&mdash;the crowning Vice was
about to be perpetrated&mdash;a horseshoe tournament was taking
place. That was too much. Swiftly I fled through the window,
wondering if my immortal soul had become contaminated. Then I
awoke, firmly resolved to vote a wet ballot next year.</p>
