<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>The maps and botanical plates (split into four) have been
relocated close to their subjects.</p>
<p>The footnotes to Chapters 7 and 11 and Appendix 5 have been
placed at the end of the chapter to assist continuity, which has
been hindered by the great lengths of both paragraphs (and poem)
and notes.</p>
<p>Click on the <span style="color: #FF0000;">red bracketed
number</span> to go to the footnote; click on the <span style=
"color: #0000ff;">blue footnote number</span> at the beginning of
the note to return to the text.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, each footnote is placed at the end of the paragraph
in which it occurs. A footnote in Chapter 4, under the present scheme,
would need to have been inserted more than 600 lines later. A
paragraph break has been made to insert it.</p>
<p>Some of the blank species' names in Chapter 12 (shown as
[blank]) may be found in the table at the end of the book.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Such</span> of the following papers and maps
as are official documents, are made public by the liberal
permission of the Noble Secretary of State for the Colonial
Department, and of the Honourable Commissioners of His Majesty's
Navy. Such of them as are part of the Transactions of the
Philosophical Society of Australia are printed by the permission
of their respective authors; for I am sorry to add, that that
infant society soon expired in the baneful atmosphere of
distracted politics, which unhappily clouded the short
administration of its President, the present Governor of New
South Wales. Let me hope that it is only a case of suspended
animation, and that our little society will be resuscitated by
the new colonial government; for much every way is expected from
the gubernatorial experience and decision of mind of the
Governor-elect, the wisdom and learning of the Archdeacon, and
the natural science and business-talent of the Colonial
Secretary, whom the Linnæan Society will miss as <i>its</i>
Secretary. (The present legal officers of the colonial government
I had not the good fortune to meet; but I hear from all quarters
of the sound judgment of the Chief Justice, and the professional
knowledge of the Attorney General.) Let me hope that the progress
of Australian discovery will still be stimulated by association,
and fostered by power. In maritime geography, our Government may
again avail itself of the able services of Captain King, who is
anxious to complete his survey of the Australian coasts; and in
interior geography, Mr. Oxley would engage; in the winters of
three years, to fill up the map of New South Wales, from Cape
Moreton to Cape Howe&mdash;and that without prejudice to the
duties of his office as Surveyor General. Such indeed is his
ardour to finish what he has so successfully begun and continued,
that he would sooner resign that valuable and important office
than suffer another to bear away from him the honours of New
Holland Interior Discovery. Of wood like all this, surely the
Mercury of a scientific body might be made.</p>
<br>
<p>The zoology of New Holland is a still more untrodden field
than the geography and the geology. The little glossary of its
animal kingdom at the end of this volume is all that I have been
able, with the assistance of the museum and my friends of the
Linnæan Society, to compile. Some valuable papers upon the
ornithology of Australia have recently appeared in the
"Zoological Journal", and one still more comprehensive is now in
preparation for the Linnæan Society; but this science is no
longer the study of dried birds: dead animals tell few tales:
Australia is the land of contrarieties, where the laws of nature
seem reversed: her zoology can only be studied and unravelled on
the spot, and that too only by a profound, philosopher. Such an
one is among us; and every circumstance now seems to point him
out to a government, which is taking advantage of the peace of
the world to turn its attention to national collections of
science and art, as the public zoologist of our colonies in
Australia. There is no delicacy in naming a man, who will rank
with Cuvier and Lamarck,&mdash;I mean the author of "Horæ
Entomologicæ." Ever since the establishment of these colonies,
our government has employed a botanist in New Holland; and it is
to such public munificence that we owe the masterly labours of
Brown. England has always encouraged professors of botany at
home, and employed botanical collectors in her colonies; hot in
zoology, no public instruction can be obtained in this country,
and many of the private specimens, that are introduced into it,
are suffered to be purchased from to by foreign public, museums.
It is sorely a national disgrace that <i>we</i> should conquer
and acquire colonies, and that <i>other nations</i> should reap
the honour of their zoological history. At this moment, the
interior provinces of India, the spicy groves of its islands, and
the terra incognita of Borneo, ape traversed in all directions by
foreign naturalists, employed by different European powers, to
gather that scientific harvest, which the valour or policy of
England has rendered accessible. To show that I have only
expressed the general feeling upon this subject among men of
science, I will refer to a note in the "Horæ Entomologicæ", p.
467, and to the "Zoological Journal", No. 3, p. 309, and No. 4,
p. 463.</p>
<p>The most important discovery, which the following pages
record, is certainly that of the navigable river in Moreton Bay,
four hundred miles to the northward of Port Jackson, since this
is the direction in which it is desirable to extend the colony of
New South Wales. The honour of this discovery has fortunately
fallen to the lot of Mr. Oxley, to indemnify him for his double
disappointment in the termination of the rivers Lachlan and
Macquarie. The wonder is, not that he has discovered it; but that
this adventure should have been reserved for him; for the master
of one of the vessels belonging to the colonial government had
been to Moreton Bay only a few months before Mr. Oxley, for the
very purpose of survey; and Captain Cook, as long ago as the year
1770, suggested, that "some on board having, in addition to a
small space where no land was visible, also observed that the sea
looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of
Moreton Bay opened into a river": and Captain Flinders, in the
year 1799, in an expedition from Port Jackson for the express
purpose of exploring this bay, says, that in Glasshouse Bay, the
bay within Moreton Bay, "above the sixth island, the east and
west shores, from being nine or ten miles apart, approach each
other within two miles, and the space between them takes the form
of a river; but the entrance was too full of shoals to leave a
hope of penetrating by it far into the interior, or that it could
be of importance to navigation; under which discouragement, and
that of a foul wind, all further research at the head of
Glasshouse Bay was given up:" but he adds, that "he judged
favourably of the country on the borders of what seemed to be a
river falling into the head of the bay, both from its thick
covering of wood, and from the good soil of the sixth island,
which lies at the entrance." It was in neither of these openings
that the Brisbane was at last discovered, but at the first
islands; but these inflammatory descriptions were enough to
provoke perpetual curiosity in the whole of Moreton Bay. This
part of the coast did not lie within Captain King's instructions
from the Admiralty. When such a river as the Brisbane has been
discovered, after the skilful and investigating Flinders has
pronounced it "an ascertained fact that no river of importance
intersected the east coast of New Holland between the 24th and
39th degrees of south latitude," it seems advisable for the
colonial government actually to enter by boats every inlet of
its neighbouring coasts; and encouragement is held out even to
private adventurers, like Mr. Berry, to take nothing upon trust,
but to explore with their own eyes every creek and cranny of the
coast, that may lie in the way of their little vessels. The
increase of the colonial coasting trade, to the northward, in
coals and timber, and to the southward an opening of the
spermaceti whale fishery to small colonial craft, by repealing
that port regulation which says that no ship, having made sail,
shall again come to anchor within the heads or harbours of Port
Jackson and the Derwent, which repeal can only be made when fewer
of the convicts are kept at or near Sydney and Hobart-town, would
be highly favourable to the discovery of rivers, the want of
which is the only defect in the colonies, of New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land: "Thou hast given me a south land; give me also
springs of water."</p>

Sydney, 10th Jan. 1824.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="a">Sir,</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 15%;"><span class="a">I have</span> the
honour to report to you, for the information of his Excellency
Sir Thomas Brisbane, my proceedings, in the execution of the
instructions contained in your letter of the 19th September
last.</p>
<p>I sailed from this port in his Majesty's cutter Mermaid on the
23d October, and on the 5th November following I anchored in Port
Curtis, after a tedious passage, occasioned by adverse
north-easterly winds and strong southerly currents.</p>
<p>From the description of the islands forming the N.E. side of
this port, by Captain Flinders, I considered that the purpose of
my mission would be best answered by commencing the examination
of the country on the S.W. side, or mainland, and I now
respectfully submit, for his Excellency's consideration, the
result of a minute examination of the S.W. coast of this port,
extending from the north head of Bustard Bay to Mount Larcom, and
in which I was occupied sixteen days.</p>
<p>Port Curtis is a very difficult harbour for shipping to enter.
Numerous sand shoals extend off from the mainland nearly to
Facing Island, and these are not distinguishable until nearly low
water, the rapidity of the tides causing the water to assume the
same turbid appearance in the deep channels as on the banks. The
best and most marked channel for large ships is the one close to
Facing Island, which must not be approached nearer than five
fathoms. From that depth the water shoals suddenly to the bank or
reef which surrounds the island, and which does not show itself
except at low water. When Gatcombe Head bears north, the channel
widens considerably, and ships may anchor in security. A S.E.
wind and ebb tide however cause a considerable sea, and there
being no coves in which small vessels can lie out of the set of
the tides, it cannot be considered as a good harbour for vessels
of small burthen.</p>
<p>The coast of the mainland is covered with mangroves, extending
in some places more than half a mile back, and the shore at low
water is rendered almost inaccessible by extensive mud-flats.
South-shore Head is the only point where a landing could be
effected at any time of tide. The country between South Trees
Point and Mount Larcom is broken into low stony ridges: in the
valleys the soil is a poor sand; and in a space of eight miles
about four I did not see two hundred acres of even tolerable
land. The stony ridges terminate in mangrove swamps on the
harbour, and the whole of this range is bounded in by steep rocky
hills, covered with quartz and coarse sandstone. Near to South
Trees Point, the hills appear at a distance somewhat better, as
they are thinly timbered, and thickly covered with grass: the
principal rocks are of slate and the whole surface is spread with
small pieces of quartz, granite, and a sort of shale.</p>
<p>On the west side of South Shore Head, a small rill discharges
itself into a salt-water creek, accessible in boats at high
water, when the stream can be approached within a quarter of a
mile; and nearly four miles west from this, is another smaller
one, but it is lost among the mangroves.</p>
<p>On the banks of the first stream a few acres of the best land
I saw are to be found; and a low range communicates with the
harbour at South Shore Head.</p>
<p>Both the streams I have mentioned derive their source in the
rocky hills to the S.W. Their course is very short; but
insignificant as they are, they appear from the flood-marks to
be, in the rainy season, the channels of considerable torrents.
With the exception of these rivulets, I saw no other fresh water,
and as the country was strictly examined between the head of the
inlet round South Trees Point (which proved to be an island half
covered at high water) and Mount Larcom, I feel satisfied no
other waters exist in that tract, except during the rainy season,
when a few ponds (dry when I saw them) in some of the valleys
will necessarily be filled.</p>
<p>The timber in the tract of country above described consists
entirely of a diminutive species of eucalyptus, quite useless for
any domestic purpose, and fit only for firewood. Neither did the
view obtained of the more distant country warrant the probability
of any timber of a better description being found, as I saw
nothing but rocky hills, on which it was impossible for any thing
like timber to grow.</p>
<p>South from Gatcombe Head we discovered a rapid mountain
stream, which received the name of the Boyne. The entrance is
nearly blocked up by sand-banks. At high water there may be from
ten to twelve feet in the channel. About three miles from the
entrance the rapids begin. It is however navigable at high water
for large boats about four miles further, when the river becoming
fresh, navigation is stopped. Between this point (marked A on the
map) and the entrance, I did not see any fresh water. The country
was, alternately on either shore, low forest hills of a better
description than before seen, but so stony as to be almost
incapable of cultivation. The intermediate flats were composted
of a good light sandy soil, apparently much flooded, since
between this point and the entrance flood-marks were observed
twenty-five feet above the usual level. From the hill marked A,
the anchorage under Facing Island was seen, and signals from
Gatcombe Head might be distinguished. A flat of good land extends
a short distance to the N.W. from this hill, and is bounded by
other broken ranges of stony hills, affording very good
pasturage. To the south the country rises into lofty rocky
ranges; but to the S.W., though considerably elevated and broken,
it seemed as if capable of affording good pasturage.</p>
<p>From point A the river was examined twelve or fourteen miles
further, the whale-boat being dragged over a succession of
rapids, separating deep and picturesque reaches of the river.
Much rich alluvial land was seen, and the hills, though very
stony, were covered with grass. The floods appeared to rise
between forty and fifty feet, and all the flats bore marks of
being deeply flooded. No fresh water was found except in the
river, which, when confined within its natural banks, is in some
places an eighth of a mile wide, the outer banks much wider, but
both insufficient to afford a channel to the great accumulation
of waters, which, according to every appearance, is periodically
discharged by this river from the mountains in the vicinity. The
hills rest on a granite base, though in two or three places,
where the bulks had been washed away by the torrents, large
masses of blue slate rock were discovered. The timber was
universally small and useless. A few large trees growing on the
flooded lands can scarcely be called an exception, as they
consisted of an inferior species of eucalyptus; and a few, acres
on two or three spots on the bends of the river were covered with
vines and brush, among which the light timber trees common to
Port Hunter were seen, as were also some coarse cedar trees, of
little value or utility.</p>
<p>The flat flooded lands on the banks of the river are of no
great extent: the soil is a deep rich sand, and capable of
producing any crops suitable to the climate. Many of the hills,
though very stony, did not seem unfit to be applied to the
cultivation of coffee, while the general openness and grassy
nature of the country would seem well adapted for gracing, if the
apparent scarcity of water, away from the river, did not greatly
diminish the chance of its profitable application to that
purpose.</p>
<p>Facing Island, which protects Port Curtis from the sea, is so
scantily supplied with good water, at least at this season
(November), that, independently of its being generally unfertile
and destitute of useful timber, it did not appear to be capable
of affording a subsistence for more than half a dozen families.
There were many indications of mineral substances found on the
island; and some trifling specimens were procured which seemed to
contain copper and tin.</p>
<p>Having viewed and examined, with the most anxious attention,
every point that afforded the least promise of being eligible for
the site of a settlement, I respectfully submit it as my opinion,
that Port Curtis and its vicinity do not afford such a site; and
I do not think that any convict establishment could be formed
there that would return, either from the natural productions of
the country, or as arising from agricultural labour, any portion
of the great expense which would necessarily attend its first
formation. In short, it did not appear to me that the country,
taking it in an extended sense, could either afford subsistence,
or supply the means of profitable labour, for a large
establishment; and even in one on the smallest scale, the
greatest difficulties would arise from the scarcity of timber for
building, and of bark and shingles for covering. The station the
best watered, and of easiest access, is the inlet to the west of
South Shore Head; and for agricultural purposes, the station
marked A on the map of the River Boyne.</p>
<p>The coast between the Boyne River mid the north head of
Bustard Bay affords two other inlets, the easternmost of which,
called Rodd's Bay by Captain King, is of considerable extent,
with good anchorage and shelter for vessels of all descriptions.
The country was examined in the vicinity of this last, but no
permanent fresh water being found, nor any timber fit for
building, and the general character of the country being
precisely similar to that surrounding Port Curtis, it will be
needless to enter into a detailed description of it. It was
equally destitute of any inducement to form a settlement on its
shores.</p>
<p>The length of time consumed in the examination of Port Curtis,
the winds prevailing almost constantly from the N.E., the
approaching rainy season, and the excessive heat of the weather,
induced me to defer the examination of Port Bowen to a more
favourable season, when greater time could be devoted to it. I
therefore returned to the southward, and entered Moreton Bay on
the 29th November, anchoring the vessel close to Point Skirmish,
at the entrance of Pumice-stone River.</p>
<p>Pumice-stone River had been so thoroughly examined and well
described by Captain Flinders, that I conceived it would answer
no useful purpose to go over the same ground; but considering the
west shore of Moreton Bay as only cursorily examined, I
determined to trace it entirely round, in the hope to find, in
such an extensive inlet, some opening which would render an
apparently fine country of more utility and value than it could
be expected to be, if the accounts of the scarcity of fresh water
here were correct.</p>
<p>Our first day's survey terminated a little above Red Cliff
Point. The shores are in general low and covered with mangroves,
off which extend considerable mud-flats, dry at low water; but to
this remark the shores in the vicinity of Red Cliff Point are an
exception. The water is here deep within a short distance of the
shore, and the country about it is open forest, of an indifferent
quality of clay land, with an admixture of sand. A few miles
behind Red Cliff Point, to the west, the country again becomes
low, and is apparently wet, but soon rises into open
forest-hills. There was no want of permanent fresh water, though
not in streams; and in an inlet marked B is abundance of good
timber of the eucalyptus and pine species.</p>
<p>Early on the second day (December 2d), in pursuing our
examination, we had the satisfaction to find the tide sweeping us
up a considerable opening between the First Islands and the
mainland. The muddiness of the water, and the abundance of
fresh-water mollusca, convinced us we were entering a large
river; and a few hours ended our anxiety on that point, by the
water becoming perfectly fresh, while no diminution had taken
place in the size of the river, after passing what I have called
Sea Reach. Our progress up the river was necessarily retarded by
the obligation of making a running survey during bur passage. At
sunset we had proceeded up the river about twenty miles. The
scenery was peculiarly beautiful&mdash;the country on the banks
alternately hilly and level, but not flooded&mdash;the soil of
the finest description of brush land, on which grew timber of
great magnitude, of various species, some of which were unknown
to us. Among others a magnificent species of pine was in great
abundance. The timber on the hills was also good; and to the
south-east, a little distant from the river, were several brushes
or forests of the common Australian cypress-tree (Callitris
Australis) of large size. Up to this point the river was
navigable for vessels of considerable burthen, if not drawing
more titan sixteen feet water. The tide rose about five feet,
being the same as at the entrance.</p>
<p>The next day the examination of the river was resumed; and,
with increased satisfaction, we proceeded about thirty miles
further, no diminution having taken place either in the breadth
or the depth of it, except that in one place, to the extent of
about thirty yards, a ridge of detached rocks stretched across,
having not more than twelve feet at high water. From this point
to Termination Hill, the river continued of nearly uniform size;
the country being of a very superior description, and equally
well adapted for cultivation and for grazing; the timber
abundant, and fit for all the purposes of domestic use or
exportation, while the pine-trees, if they should prove of good
quality, were of a scantling sufficient for the topmasts of large
ships. Some were measured upwards of thirty inches in diameter,
and from fifty to eighty feet without a branch.</p>
<p>The boat's crew were so exhausted by their constant exertions
under a vertical sun, that I was most reluctantly compelled to
relinquish my intention of proceeding to the termination of
tidewater. At this place the tide rose about four feet six
inches, the force of the ebb-tide and current united being little
greater than the flood-tide&mdash;a proof of its flowing through
a very level country. Nothing, however, indicated that I should
speedily arrive at that termination; and being upwards of seventy
miles from the vessel, with not more than another day's
provisions (not having expected to make such a discovery), I
landed on the south shore for the purpose of examining the
surrounding country. On ascending a low hill rising about 250
feet above the level of the river, which I called Termination
Hill, I obtained a view of its apparent course for thirty or
forty miles, and saw a distant mountain (which I conjectured to
be the "High Peak" marked on Captain Flinders's chart) bearing S.
1½° E. distant from twenty-five to thirty miles.* Round from this
point to the N.W., the country declined considerably in
elevation, and had much the appearance of an extended plain,
formed of low undulating hills and vales, well, but not heavily,
wooded. The only elevations of magnitude were some hills seven or
eight hundred feet high, which we had passed to the northward.
The appearance of the country, the slowness of the current even
at ebb-tide, and the depth of water, induced me to conclude that
the river will be found navigable for vessels of burthen to a
much greater distance, probably not less than fifty miles. There
was no appearance of its being flooded, no mark being found
higher than seven feet above the level, which is little more than
would be caused by the flood-tide at high water forcing back any
unusual accumulation of waters in rainy seasons.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This cannot be the case, because Mr. Oxley
places Termination Hill within six miles of the position that
Captain Flinders has assigned to his "High Peak". The mountain
must therefore be some part of the range to the north-west of
Mount Warning.&mdash;<span class="a">P.P. King</span>.]</p>
<p>The nature of the country, and a consideration of all the
circumstances connected with the appearance of the river, justify
me in entertaining a strong belief that the sources of the river
will not be found in a mountainous country, but rather that it
flows from some lake, which will prove to be the receptacle of
those interior streams crossed by me during an expedition of
discovery in 1818; but whatever may be its origin, it is by far
the largest fresh-water river in New South Wales, and promises to
be of the utmost importance to the colony, as it affords
communication with the sea to a vast extent of country, a great
portion of which appeared to me capable of raising the richest
productions of the tropics.</p>
<p>Proceeding S.E. from the river, we found a gently undulating
country of good soil, declining in elevation towards the south,
the peak before-mentioned being the only high land in the
direction from N.E. to south.</p>
<p>As the position of the entrance of the river was to be fixed,
and the channels examined, I lost no time in returning down the
river with the ebb-tide, and at sunset stopped at the foot of a
hill about ten miles down it. This was ascended in the morning,
and the view from it was more extensive than I had anticipated.
The high mountain-range, of which Mount Warning is the nucleus,
appeared gradually to lose itself to the westward; and with the
exception of the peak before-mentioned, which is the termination
of the north end of the Mount Warning range, there was scarcely
an elevation above the low undulating level. If any range of
hills of ordinary magnitude had had place within fifty or sixty
miles, it must have been seen.</p>
<p>So much time was spent in examining the country about "Sea
Reach", that it was dark when we got to the entrance of the
river, which from respect to His Excellency the Governor, under
whose orders the bay was examined, was honoured with the name of
the Brisbane River. The whole of the next day was spent in
sounding the entrance and traversing the country in the vicinity
of Red Cliff Point, and we did not reach the vessel until late in
the night of the 5th December, amply gratified by this discovery
of this important river, as it afforded every reasonable ground
for expecting that the most beneficial consequences would result
to the colony by the formation of a settlement on its banks.</p>
<p>I feel it impossible to enter into a nautical description of
so extensive an inlet as Moreton Bay. The draught given of it by
Captain Flinders, so far as it comprehends the track passed over
by him, is extremely correct, but the whole extent of the bay is
no by means included in his map. There are numerous sand-banks in
the bay, divided and separated by deep-water channels of various
depth and magnitude. It would require many months to make a
complete marine survey of it, and this would prove of little
service unless the channels were buoyed. I do not think, however,
that there would be any difficulty in taking a ship, whose
draught of water does not exceed eighteen feet, as high as Red
Cliff Point, being about twelve miles above Mount Skirmish, which
is the N.W. point of the bay. Above Red Cliff Point to the
entrance of the river, the channels would require to be well
ascertained before vessels of large size could proceed up the
river. There is, however, no great danger, as the shoals are of
soft mud, and the water quite smooth. A narrow sand-bank appeared
to me to extend across from Cape Moreton, at the entrance of the
bay, to the mainland. On this bank I did not find more than three
fathoms at low water; but as the distance across is full twelve
miles, many deeper channels may have escaped my observation.</p>

<br>
<small>[Click on map to enlarge.]</small></p>
<p>Pumice-stone River affords good anchorage for vessels not
drawing more than twelve feet water. The best channel is close to
the mainland. There is plenty of fresh water in the vicinity of
Point Skirmish; and though the soil is poor and sandy, the
country is covered with good timber. Among other species, the
<i>Callitris Australis</i> is most abundant. It grows close to
the shore, and can be procured of considerable size, adapted to
most of the purposes requisite in buildings.</p>
<p>Should a settlement be formed in Moreton Bay, the country in
the vicinity of Red Cliff Point offers the best site for an
establishment in the first instance. It has an easy communication
with the sea, there is not that difficulty experienced in
effecting a landing which other situations in the bay present,
and the country to the west of the point will communicate with
the interior. It is about ten miles to the north of the entrance
into Brisbane River, and must be passed by all vessels intending
to enter it. Red Cliff Point must, however, be viewed more in the
light of a naval post or depôt for stores than as being well
adapted for a principal settlement. The Brisbane River presents
so many superior situations, that although a post at Red Cliff
Point may, in the first instance, be indispensable, yet the
country on the west side of the river, at the termination of the
Sea Reach, appears to me a much better site for a permanent
establishment. The river is not fresh there, but there is plenty
of fresh water: the country is open, and no obstacles exist from
swamps or hills to prevent a ready communication with the
interior, either by the banks of the river, or at a distance from
it. The water is deep close to the shore, and vessels of
considerable burthen could load or unload close to the bank. From
a hill near this last station, the entrance of the bay can be
seen; and by clearing a few trees, communication by signal may be
held with Red Cliff Point. The ground is dry and of moderate
elevation, and it receives the full force of the sea breeze.</p>
<p>The bay abounds with what are called in the colony mullet,
whiting, king-fish, and flat-fish. The natives, in the
intercourse we had with them, appeared to possess a most friendly
disposition. They are very numerous, and are, to a certain
extent, superior in their domestic habits to the savages
inhabiting the more southern coasts. For a more detailed
description of these people, I beg to refer you to the
information obtained by Mr. Uniacke during my absence from the
vessel, and which is appended to the accompanying Journal.</p>
<p>There are several islands in the upper part of Moreton Bay, to
the southward of the entrance into Brisbane River, two of which
are formed of dry good land, with water on them: the others are
mere mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>We had little opportunity of making any nautical corrections
of the present excellent charts of Captain Flinders. We, however,
discovered that the land of Point Lookout is an island, and that
Moreton Bay extends as far south as 28°, where it communicates
with the sea by a shoal channel through a sandy beach navigable
for boats.</p>
<p>We had also the satisfaction to discover that the high lands
of Mount Warning discharged their waters into the sea, by means
of a considerable stream, which empties itself close to Point
Danger. Across the entrance there is a bar, having twelve feet
water on it at half-tide: there may probably be fourteen feet at
high-water. I had not time to proceed up it beyond a few miles;
but this was sufficiently far to perceive that the river had its
source to the west of Mount Warning. The country appeared good,
and abounded with fine timber.</p>
<p>I derived an additional source of satisfaction in the
discovery of this river, since it established the point that the
Brisbane River did not receive its waters from the lofty ranges
of the sea-coast, and that as its course had passed the N.W.
extremity of the coast-ranges, it must derive its waters from
some part of the S.W. interior.</p>
<p>From the observations of others, added to my own limited
knowledge of the winds and weather on this coast, I think that
considerable difficulty will be experienced by vessels bound to
the northward from October to February; and this difficulty
increases after passing Break-sea Spit, when the N.E. trade-wind,
varying occasionally to the S.E., undoubtedly prevails, at this
season blowing with great strength. To the southward of Break-sea
Spit the winds are more variable, being much influenced by the
direction of the coast, which to that point is nearly north and
south. The currents to the south of Break-sea Spit, at a distance
of fifteen or twenty miles from the shore, set strong to the
south. Near the shore there is little current, and I have there
found it setting to the north. In older to make a good passage
during the summer season, I would recommend vessels to keep the
land close on board. There are no hidden dangers, and, besides
being out of the strength of the current, considerable advantage
is obtained by being within the influence of the land-winds,
which commonly blow off it during the night. As a proof of the
general tendency and set of the currents, a log of cedar with a
staple in it was found on the seashore on Moreton Island, which
must have come from Port Macquarie, being set along shore by a
current from the southward; and close to it a cask and New
Zealand canoe, which were recognised as belonging to the Echo
whaler, which was shipwrecked on Wreck Reef about three years
ago. On my return from Moreton Bay, at a distance of twelve or
fourteen miles from the coast, the vessel was set fifty-eight
miles to the south in twenty-two hours, and a current of nearly
equal strength accelerated our return from Port Macquarie to
Sydney. The existence of this southerly current at this season,
and the situation of its greatest strength with respect to the
coast, are points well known to the masters of vessels sailing
out of this port.</p>
<p>I have the honour to transmit herewith a Journal of my
proceedings, together with a corrected map of Moreton Bay,
including Brisbane River; and also some alterations in the
coast-line about Point Danger. The alterations and additions are
coloured red. Detached draughts of the inlets in the vicinity of
Port Curtis also accompany this Report.</p>

<br>
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">On</span> Tuesday October 21st, 1823, Mr.
Oxley, Lieutenant Stirling of the Buffs, and I, embarked on board
the colonial cutter Mermaid (Charles Penson, master), about noon,
and proceeded down the harbour; but the wind proving
unfavourable, we came to under Point Piper, where we remained
till the next day at midnight, when a moderate breeze springing
up we got under way and ran out of the harbour. Early on the
morning of the 25th we came to an anchor off Port Macquarie,
distant north from Sydney 175 miles. This place had been settled
about two years before, as a penal establishment; but the
excellence of the soil, the fineness of the climate, and its
convenient distance from Sydney, made Government anxious to throw
it open to free settlers, in case we should be successful in the
object of our expedition.</p>
<p>Messrs. Oxley, Stirling, and myself, immediately went ashore,
the sickness endured by the two former making them very anxious
to leave the vessel. The line of coast before us was very
beautiful, consisting of a succession of small headlands richly
clothed with wood; while the darkness of the foliage was
pleasingly relieved by the verdure of the grass, which here and
there appeared in small open patches.</p>
<p>About a mile to the north lay the entrance of the river
Hastings, beyond which was a long sandy beach extending six or
seven miles, and terminated by a bold headland called Point
Plomer. Across the entrance of the river is a sandy bar with
about eleven feet at low water. With the wind at S.E. there are
heavy rollers on it, making the approach to the town difficult
and dangerous. We landed on the rocks to the south of the
entrance, and found Captain Allman, the commandant, awaiting our
arrival, with Lieutenants Wilson and Roberts, and
Assistant-surgeon Fenton, all of the 48th regiment. They
conducted us to Government House, where we breakfasted, and then
walked out to see the place, accompanied by Captain Allman.</p>
<p>Considering that the site on which the town now stands was two
years ago coveted with immense forest trees, and thick
brash-wood, it is quite incredible to what a state of perfection
the place had been brought by the indefatigable activity of the
commandant.</p>
<p>The Government House stands nearly in the centre of the town,
on a handsome esplanade, open to the sea. To the northward, on a
rising ground, which commands the whole town, are the military
barracks, calculated to hold 150 men, each of the married men
having a small cottage and garden. On the right of the hill are
two handsome cottages, which are used as officers' quarters. The
remainder of the town, which is extremely dean, is entirely
occupied by the prisoners, who are kept as distinct as possible
from the military, and who have each a small but neat hut,
constructed of split-wood, lathed, plastered and white-washed,
with a garden attached. The sites of the streets, intended to be
built as the population of the town Increases, are regularly laid
out and fenced: the spaces between them are at present occupied
as gardens and plantations of maize, sugar-cane, &amp;c. the
latter of which appears to thrive remarkably well, and will (I
doubt not) at some future period form a lucrative article of
export from this establishment. We dined at the Government House,
and a few of us walking down to the beach after dinner, were
highly amused by a dance among the natives. These people are a
much finer race than those in the neighbourhood of Sydney, many
of them being upwards of six feet high. Their features are also
more expressive of intellect, and their limbs better formed than
any I had before seen. Some of the more civilized are victualled
from the king's store of the settlement, and, in return, perform
some of the duties of constable, in a more efficient manner than
any European possibly could. Whenever (as frequently happens) any
of the prisoners attempt to escape into the woods, they are
instantly pursued by some of this black police, who possess a
wonderful facility in tracing them; and being furnished with
fire-arms, they seldom fail to bring them back alive or dead, for
which they are rewarded with blankets, spirits, &amp;c.&mdash;but
should the runaways even escape the black police, they are almost
sure to perish by hunger or the hostility of the other
Indians.</p>
<p>Having spent another day very pleasantly with Captain Allman
and his officers, we left Port Macquarie with much, regret,
having been entertained there in a style which was far superior
to any thing we could have expected in so recent an
establishment, and which could only be exceeded by the extreme
kindness and polite hospitality of every officer connected with
the settlement.</p>
<p>We met the boat at the rocks where we had landed, and with
some little difficulty, on account of the surf, reached the
cutter at two o'clock on Monday, 27th October. The wind being
fair, we immediately got under way, and continued our course to
the northward till Friday afternoon, when it shifted, and came on
to blow so hard, that we determined to run in shore and look out
for anchorage; this we found under the lee of a small island off
Point Danger (so named by Captain Cook), about a mile from the
land. While running down for this place, we perceived the mouth
of a large river about a mile and a half to the northward; and
next morning at daylight the master was despatched in the
whale-boat to ascertain the possibility of taking the vessel into
it. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Stirling and I landed on the island
with our guns. The rock which formed the base was evidently of
volcanic origin: it was of a dark colour, full of small holes and
extremely hard, while on the western side were many regular
circular cavities, some of which were about four or five yards in
diameter at top, and tapered down gradually towards the bottom,
which was usually filled with round stones. One of these holes,
in particular, had a communication underneath with the sea, and
at every returning surf threw up considerable quantities of water
with a loud noise. The superincumbent rocks were basaltic, and
those of a small rock to the N.W. of the island, as well as those
of a bluff headland, immediately opposite on the main, were
inferior only in extent to the Giant's Causeway in the north of
Ireland. In ascending to the top of the island, we sank nearly
knee-deep at every step in the bird-holes that undermined the
surface. The inhabitants of these subterraneous dwellings were
sooty peterels, mutton-birds and red-bills, the last very good
eating. We shot many of them, as the young ones were full fledged
and got up in numbers round us, when disturbed by our filling
into their holes. On the top of the island we were surprised to
see some hundred pelicans seated quietly near their young, who,
with the eggs, covered a considerable space. They did not appear
at all intimidated, although they must have heard the reports of
our guns several times. However, on our giving them a volley,
which they did not seem to care more for than if it came from
pop-guns, they slowly took flight, screaming frightfully. These
birds were at least five feet high, and from the peculiar
formation of the trill, the effect of such a multitude, drawn up
as if in regular order, was very singular. Having taken a few of
the young ones and eggs, we were proceeding to the place where we
landed, when we observed what appeared to be part of a wreck on
the N.W. point of the island. We immediately proceeded towards
it, not without expressing a hope that it might prove the vessel
of that unfortunate and universally lamented navigator, La
Perouse, who is generally supposed to have perished somewhere in
these latitudes, having never been heard of since he left Port
Jackson in the year 1789. It appeared to be the larboard quarter,
with part of the stern and quarter-deck of a vessel of at least
three hundred tons. The plank, which was of oak, was not yet
totally destroyed. Though we formed a variety of ingenious
conjectures on the subject, we could find nothing about the wreck
by which we could at all determine what she had been. We then
returned on board, where we found the master had arrived before
us: he reported that he had examined the entrance and found two
fathoms on the bar at low water, with deep water and secure
anchorage further in. As the river appeared to run from the
southward, and parallel with the shore for some distance, it was
agreed that the mate should go after breakfast with a boat into
the river, until opposite to where the vessel lay, when we were
to join him by land and proceed to the examination of the upper
part of the river. In the mean time Mr. Oxley and I landed again
on the island, to take an observation and examine the wreck more
closely; but nothing further was discovered by which we could in
any way identify her. We however picked up a piece of slate with
part of a name deeply scratched on it, and also part of a case of
mathematical instruments. Mr. Oxley then ascended the hill, while
I walked towards the S.E. end of the island, accompanied by a
native black of the name of Bowen, whom we had brought from
Sydney. After spending some time in sauntering about, during
which I found a quantity of fine sponge, and a large patch of
excellent rock spinach, of which I took a great bundle on board,
on approaching a small reef at the S.E. end of the island, I
observed, to my great satisfaction, upwards of a dozen large
turtles lying asleep on a small beach: I instantly despatched
Bowen for assistance, and on Mr. Penson, the master's coming up,
we were fortunate enough to secure seven, some of which were very
large, two of them weighing above four cwt. The largest was so
very unwieldy that we were obliged to cut its throat on the spot,
otherwise we should not have been able to have brought it on
board at all. Mr. Oxley and I then returned to the ship, and,
after taking some refreshment, landed on the main, to proceed
with the examination of the river: the part of it where we found
the boat extended over a large flat, being in many places above a
mile broad, interspersed with numerous low mangrove islands, and
very shallow, except in the channel, where we found from nine to
two fathoms water.</p>
<p>The country on either side was very hilly, and richly wooded,
and the view altogether beautiful beyond description. Having
wandered out of the channel, we with some difficulty proceeded
about four miles, when the river assumed a different appearance,
being contracted to a quarter of a mile in width, with five
fathoms water all across: the banks also wore a different aspect,
being free from mangroves: the soil seemed rich, and the timber
evidently improved in size and quality. The scenery here exceeded
any thing I had previously seen in Australia&mdash;extending for
miles along a deep rich valley, clothed with magnificent trees,
the beautiful uniformity of which was only interrupted by the
turns and windings of the river, which here and there appeared
like small lakes, while in the back ground, Mount Warning (the
highest land in New South Wales) reared its barren and singularly
shaped peak, forming a striking contrast with the richness of the
intermediate country.</p>
<p>On the right bank of the river were standing one man and
several women and children, all perfectly naked. They did not
appear so timid as the Indians usually are, but remained quietly
while we landed to search for fresh water, the river being still
brackish. The man was curiously scarified all over the body, the
flesh being raised as thick as my finger all over his breasts. He
talked very loudly for some time, using much gesticulation, and
frequently pointing to the other side of the river, where we had
observed a number of native huts. We could not however obtain
from him any information with regard to the object of our search;
so after giving him some biscuit, which he tasted and instantly
spat out again, we left him, and as it was now late, proceeded
towards the vessel, resolving the next day to return and follow
the river as far as circumstances would allow. We saw no weapons
of any description among these people, with the exception of a
stone hatchet hanging at the back of one of the women, which was
of wretchedly rude formation. It was now agreed that the mate and
crew should remain with the boat in the river, where we had
joined them, all night, and that Mr. Oxley and I should return on
board to sleep, and come back with Mr. Stirling at daylight.
However, just as we were preparing to land, the wind suddenly
shifted to the S.W.; and as it seemed likely to continue steady
in that point, Mr. Oxley thought it imprudent to lose the
advantage of it, and therefore deferred exploring the river
further till our return. The signal was accordingly made for the
boat to return on board, and all hands were employed in getting
the vessel under way. In the mean time a number of natives,
amounting to about 200, collected on the shore opposite the
vessel, and we could perceive with the glass that they had all
spears. They continued quietly watching us till they saw the
square-sail hoisted and the vessel under way, when they set up a
loud shout, and continued dancing and shouting while we were
within hearing. The little island under which we lay received the
name of Turtle Island, in gratitude for the abundant supply of
that fish which we procured from it. We also gave the name of the
"Tweed" to the river. The latitude of our anchorage is 28° 8' S.
and its longitude 153° 31' 30" E.</p>
<p>The night we left Turtle Island we experienced a very severe
gale, but as it was in our favour, it did not much annoy us; and
when it ceased, the next day, it fell quite calm, and the sea
appeared perfectly alive with fish. The bonitoes, skip-jacks, and
other fish, were leaping in every direction as far as the eye
could reach, while immediately round the vessel were several
large sharks, but we were not fortunate enough to catch any.</p>
<p>The next day, Thursday, November 6th, at noon, we came to an
anchor in Port Curtis, inside Gatcombe Head. Mr. Oxley
immediately went away with the master in the long boat to sound,
while Mr. Stirling and I went ashore at Facing Island in search
of fresh water, from the want of which we had suffered severely
during the last week, as all our water casks were old rum and
wine casks, which, not having been properly washed out, had
tainted all the water, so as to make it totally unfit for use: we
found water in small quantities in a little glen, opposite the
vessel, but unfortunately it was not well tasted; however, as no
other could be procured, the casks were sent ashore to be filled
with it.</p>
<p>As the weather was intensely hot (the thermometer standing
night and day at between 85° and 95° in the cabin), we ventured
to bathe in defiance of sharks, and then returned on board to an
early dinner, after which, at three o'clock, Mr. Oxley, Mr.
Stirling, and myself, quitted the vessel with two boats, taking
with us three days' provisions. Captain Flinders had visited this
port in 1801, but was not able, from want of time, to examine it
closely, which was the reason of our present visit to it. We
directed our course to South Shore Point,* about six miles from
the vessel, but found the mangroves so thick as to render our
landing extremely difficult: we therefore steered for a sandy
beach about two miles farther on, where, as it was low water, we
landed at about six o'clock with some difficulty, and immediately
pitched our tent and kindled a fire, the men making a comfortable
little hut for themselves with the boat-sails, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Qu. Head?&mdash;<span class="a">P.P.
King</span>.]</p>
<p>At daybreak next morning we were all stirring, having been
persecuted all sight by musquitoes and sand-flies; and, after
breakfast, at about six o'clock, we started across the country,
leaving a corporal and three men in charge of the tents. The
direction we took was about S.S.E. by compass, and the country we
passed over the most unpromising I ever saw, being a succession
of very steep hills, barren, and covered with sharp loose quartz
stones; the only vegetable production being coarse grass and
stunted gum-trees (eucalyptus).</p>
<p>We saw a few kangaroos, but could not get near enough to shoot
them; and, after a most fatiguing march of about six hours, in
which time we had hardly advanced twelve miles in a direct line,
we stopped on the bank of a small rivulet, which, with another
hardly equal to it in size, constituted all the fresh water we
met with. In the course of our walk, we did not see a single
native, nor were there any marks of their having lately been
there. Near the river we found a grave at the foot of a large
tree, the bark of which had been stripped off about six feet in
height all round, and the wood deeply engraven with a variety of
rude symbols, among which we could distinguish some resembling
the print left on soft ground by the foot of the kangaroo, the
emu, and other animals. This was doubtless the grave of some
great hunter.</p>
<p>After resting about an hour, we returned by the same track,
one of the men having marked the trees with an axe as we
proceeded; and at half-past five o'clock we reached the tents,
the whole party completely exhausted. Indeed, the extreme heat of
the weather and the ruggedness of our road made it certainly as
bad as a walk of forty miles in England.</p>
<p>The next day about ten o'clock we started in the boat to
discover the mouths of the rivulets we had passed the day before,
and after rowing about two miles, we came to the mouth of a
creek, up which we proceeded about six miles, when we found fresh
water, but in so small a quantity as to be totally useless for
the purposes of colonization. We then returned to our tent, where
we spent another uncomfortable night, and next day struck our
encampment and returned to the ship.</p>
<p>On our arrival on board, the master reported that he had
discovered a fine fresh water river, emptying itself by an
outlet, which was visible astern of the vessel to the southward.
From his account, Mr. Oxley was induced to defer our departure to
Port Bowen another day, in order to have an opportunity of
viewing it himself. Accordingly Mr. Stirling and he started early
the next day, while I remained behind to collect specimens of
minerals on Facing Island for the governor. Late in the evening
they returned, having proceeded up the river to above where the
tide reached; and Mr. Oxley deemed it of sufficient consequence
to remain three or four days more, in order to examine the
country more minutely. Accordingly, the next morning early we
again left the vessel, taking three days' provision, and
proceeded with one boat about twelve miles up the river, when we
pitched our tent on a bank about forty feet above the level of
the water. The soil here was of the richest description, and
calculated to grow cotton, sugar, indigo, and all other Indian
productions. There were however marks of the flood having reached
at least 15 feet higher than the level of our encampment, owing
to which the whole surface was covered about two inches deep with
drift sand. Indeed the floods here, in the rainy season, must be
tremendous, as we observed in many of the trees, at least sixty
feet above the level of the water, the wrack which had been
deposited by successive inundations. On the banks we saw three or
four different lands of timber; but the small quantity rendered
them unimportant. The river was covered with multitudes of teals,
widgeons, and wild ducks; and on the banks I shot two swamp
pheasants (a pretty black bird not unlike the English pheasant in
shape *) a very beautiful species of small dove, not known at
Sydney, and a kind of owl that none of us had seen before.
Shortly after dinner we prepared to go to rest; with an intention
of proceeding further up the river at a very early hour the next
morning. But unfortunately rest was entirely out of the question.
Soon after dark our tent was filled with musquitoes of a largo:
size than we had before seen: their noise alone would have been
sufficient to banish sleep, but their sting was intolerable. In
spite of all the precautions we could take, by covering ourselves
completely with our cloaks, and every thing else we could lay
hold of, although the thermometer stood at 94° all night in the
tent, these little tormentors continued to persecute us in the
most unrelenting manner till morning. We turned out the moment it
was light, and went down to the river to bathe. Here we found the
sandflies to the fall as troublesome as the musquitoes; and
seeing that our only remedy was to leave the place as soon as
possible, we despatched our breakfast, and getting into the boat,
proceeded about six miles further up the river. Not having seen
any natives since our first entrance into Port Curtis, we did not
think it necessary to place a guard over the tents, which we left
standing, intending to return and pass another night in the same
place. The country through which we passed this day was similar
to what we had seen the day before. The timber was however
becoming larger and more plentiful. In many places, the right
bank of the river was composed of a remarkably fine slate, while
the left was a hard close-grained gray granite, and the soil
every where rich and fertile. Before we returned we ascended a
high hill on the left, from which we had a beautiful and
extensive view of the river for many miles, through a rich brush
country, the banks in many parts well clothed with timber. A very
lofty range of hills formed a fine termination to the scene. On
our return we were fortunate enough to shoot a brace of wild
ducks, and catch a good dish of perch, with which, and many other
descriptions of fish, this beautiful river abounds. We also saw
several fresh-water tortoises.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Qu</i>. Cuculus
phasianus?&mdash;<span class="a">Editor</span>.]</p>
<p>It had originally been our intention to remain another day in
this neighbourhood, for the purpose of examining the country at a
little distance on either side of the river; but the torment we
suffered from the musquitoes was such, that we resolved to return
to the vessel the next morning. Accordingly, after spending
another most wretched night, we struck our tent, and proceeded
down the stream.</p>
<p>On arriving at the mouth of the river, we found it wanted
about an hour and a half to low water; and as Mr. Oxley wished to
see the bar at the entrance at that time, we landed and kindled a
fire for the purpose of dressing our dinner; after which we once
more embarked, and reached the vessel at about half-past four
o'clock.</p>
<p>As we had intimated our intention to leave Port Curtis as soon
as we returned from the examination of the river, Mr. Penson sent
the mate that morning to sound the channel at the entrance; and
his not returning at night caused a considerable degree of
anxiety on board, especially as there was a dangerous reef to the
northward, about a mile and a half distant, among the breakers of
which we feared he might have gotten. However, about half-past
three o'clock on the following afternoon, he made his appearance,
having been down the coast about twelve miles to the S.E., where
he had discovered a large harbour, of which he gave such an
account, as determined Mr. Oxley to abandon altogether the idea
of going to Port Bowen, which, on account of the prevalence of
northerly winds in this quarter, would have consumed more time
than we could well spare; besides which, the increasing heat of
the weather made us gladly avail ourselves of an excuse for not
proceeding any farther to the northward.</p>
<p>To the river which we discovered here Mr. Oxley gave the name
of the Boyne; but from the excessive floods to which it is
subject, I fear it can never be turned to account for the
purposes of colonization.</p>
<p>The next morning (Saturday, Nov. 15th) we got under way, and
stood out of Port Curtis. We found considerable difficulty in
getting out, from the number of sand-shoals which lie across its
entrance, and which have never been properly surveyed. They are
apparently formed by the tremendous torrents which periodically
descend down the Boyne river, from the range of mountains at the
foot of which it flows. However, we at length found the channel,
which, though narrow, will be sufficient for all the purposes of
navigation, when thoroughly known and buoyed. It carries from
five to seven fathoms all the way in.</p>
<p>We now stood away to the S.E. for the port above-mentioned as
having been seen by the mate; and having entered it by a channel
about half a mile wide lying between two sand-shoals, we came to
an anchor at four o'clock P.M. in five fathoms water, in a place
perfectly land-locked, and sheltered from every wind. The next
morning Messrs. Oxley and Stirling went in a whale-boat to the
entrance of the port, to take angles for the purpose of laying
down a chart; while I set off, accompanied by Mr. Penson, to
discover, if possible, whether any fresh water fell into the
harbour. We were not, however, successful; and after spending
four hours in examining the different creeks, all of which ended
in mangrove swamps, we returned to the vessel without having been
able to procure a drink of fresh water. In all parts of the
harbour, we saw a great many green and black snakes playing about
in the water, while the number and boldness of the sharks
exceeded credibility. They were continually striking at the oars,
and one large one very nearly pulled the steer-oar out of Mr.
Penson's hand.</p>
<p>In the course of the day I shot a very beautiful and uncommon
kind of duck, which some of our crew had before seen in New
Zealand, where it has the name of the Paradise Duck. The head and
neck were white, the bill red, the back a glossy-dark green, and
the wings regularly striped with blue, yellow, green, and white,
its flesh, however, was dry, and very fishy.</p>
<p>On our return, the mate had discovered a large pond of fresh
water, about half a mile below where the vessel was lying: and as
all the water we had on board was quite unfit for use, we
resolved to start it, and fill the casks at the above-mentioned
pond.</p>
<p>The following day was spent in watering, white the master went
in the small whale-boat to sound the passage, and the next
morning, the water being completed, we got under way at high
tide, and stood out of the harbour. At ten o'clock we anchored in
the road on the edge of the S.E. bank in three and a half fathoms
water: the boats were immediately sent away to sound. Messrs.
Oxley and Stirling went on shore to take observations, while I
went out shooting, but without success, the only birds I saw
being crows. The next day it blew very fresh, and the people were
employed getting firewood, while the sounding went on as before.
The latitude of this harbour, by observation, is 23° 59¾'S., and
its longitude by chronometer 151° 34' 45" E. It had been called
Rodd's Bay by Captain King.</p>
<p>The next morning (Friday, Nov. 21st) we weighed anchor at
eight o'clock A.M., and ran out of the road with a moderate
breeze at S.S.E., and continued working to the eastward till the
Sunday afternoon, when at six P.M., the water suddenly shoaling
to four fathoms and a half, we came to an anchor for the night.
Next morning at six o'clock we weighed and stood to the N.E., and
at half past nine the water had the appearance of being shoal
a-head, and all round; we therefore hove to, and sent the boat to
sound. It proved to be a reef of rocks of considerable extent,
running out from Break Sea Spit, to the N. by W. The least water
found on it by the boat was two feet and a half. We then bore
away N. by W., and crossed the reef in five fathoms and a
quarter. Towards evening it commenced raining and blowing
extremely hard from S. by W. We treble-reefed the mainsail, which
was notwithstanding shortly afterwards split, and nearly blown to
pieces before we could furl it. We then set the trysail and
spit-fire jib, and lay to till Saturday morning (Not. 29th), the
sea running tremendously high, and the cutter labouring very
much, and making so much water, that we were obliged to pump her
every hour. After continuing to blow thus for six days, the wind
fell, and on the Saturday at noon, having gotten an observation,
we found that the current, which here sets to the south, had,
notwithstanding the storm, drifted us nearly twenty miles per day
to windward, so that at six o'clock P.M. we came to an anchor in
Pumice-stone River, Moreton Bay, within 150 yards of the shore,
in the very place where Captain Flinders had anchored twenty-two
years before, on discovering the harbour, which, I believe, has
not been since visited by Europeans. Scarcely was the anchor let
go, when we perceived a number of natives, at the distance of
about a mile, advancing rapidly towards the vessel; and on
looking at them with the glass from the mast-head, I observed one
who appeared much larger than the rest, and of a lighter colour,
being a light copper, while all the others were black. This I
pointed out to Mr. Stirling, so that we were all on the look-out
when they approached; and to our surprise and satisfaction, when
opposite the vessel, the man hailed us in English. The boat was
immediately launched, and Messrs. Oxley, Stirling, and I, went
ashore in her. While approaching the beach, the natives showed
many signs of joy, dancing and embracing the white man, who was
nearly as wild as they. He was perfectly naked, and covered all
over with white and red paint, which the natives make use of. His
name, it appeared, was Thomas Pamphlet. He had left Sydney on the
31st March last, in an open boat, to bring cedar from the Five
Islands, about fifty miles to the S. of Port Jackson. There were
three others with him, but the boat being driven out to sea by a
gale of wind, they had suffered inconceivable hardships, being
twenty-one days without water, during which time one of them died
of thirst; and they had at length been wrecked on Moreton Island,
which forms one side of Moreton Bay, in the upper part of which
we were now lying. He was so bewildered with joy that we could
make very little out of his story that night; so having
distributed a few knives, handkerchiefs, &amp;c. among the
friendly blacks, we returned on board, taking him with us. He now
informed us that his two surviving companions, Richard Parsons
and John Finnegan, after having travelled in company with him to
the place where we found him, had, about six weeks before,
resolved to prosecute their way towards Sydney; that he had
accompanied them about fifty miles, but his feet becoming so sore
that he was unable to travel further, he had resolved to return
to the blacks, with whom we found him, and who had before treated
him with great kindness; that a few days after they parted,
Parsons and Finnegan having quarrelled, the latter also returned,
and had since remained with him, but had been absent the last
fortnight with the chief of the tribe on a hunting expedition;
and that Parsons had not been heard of since his departure. Mr.
Oxley, on hearing that Finnegan was gone towards the south end of
the bay, resolved to seek him on Monday morning, and hoped by
keeping along the shore, and occasionally firing a musket, to be
able to find him also. But on Sunday afternoon, at low water, a
man was observed walking out on a sand-bank from the opposite
shore towards us, and holding in his hand a long stick with a
skin on it; upon which I took the whale-boat and pulled towards
him, when it proved to be Finnegan. Both he and Pamphlet
concurring in a story they told us of a large river, which they
had crossed, falling into the south end of the bay, Messrs. Oxley
and Stirling started next morning in the whale-boat, taking
Finnegan with them, and four days' provisions, in order to
explore it I remained behind to shoot rare birds; and this gave
me an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the natives, who
are both in their dispositions and manners far superior to those
in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and indeed to any that I had yet
seen.</p>
<p>The principal station of the tribes, with whom we found these
poor men, was about two miles higher up the Pumice-stone River
(so called by Captain Flinders, from the immense quantities of
that substance found on its banks) than where the vessel lay; but
as they depend principally on fish for their support, they have
several huts, at a distance of three or four miles from each
other, to which they migrate from time to time as the fish become
scarce. Their huts are built of long slender wattles, both ends
of which are stuck into the ground, so as to form an arch about
three feet and a half or four feet high. These are strongly
interwoven with rude wicker-work, and the whole is covered with
tea-tree (melaleuca armillaris) bark, in such a manner as to be
quite impervious to the lain: thus forming a spacious and
commodious hut, capable of containing from ten to twelve people.
In their journeys the women are obliged to carry heavy burthens,
consisting of whatever rude utensils they may possess, together
with a large quantity of fern-root, which forms a part of their
daily food, and not unfrequently two or three children besides.
The men carry nothing but a spear, and perhaps a fire-stick; and
their only employment consists in catching fish; this they do
very expertly with a kind of hoop-net, which they use in the
following manner: They go out in equal parties of four, six, or
eight, each man having two nets. They then walk along the beach
till they perceive the fish near the shore, which (from constant
practice) they are enabled to do at a depth of four or five feet.
As soon as this takes place, a little boy, who accompanies each
party, creeps towards the water on his hands and knees; the party
then divide, forming two lines, one on each side of the boy, at a
distance of two or three yards, and as soon as the fish are
sufficiently near, the boy throws among them a handful of sand,
so as to distract their attention, when the men instantly rush
into the water, forming a semicircle round the fish, each man
standing between his two nets, which he then draws close
together. In this manner they are seldom unsuccessful, and
frequently catch more than they can consume. As they never travel
without fire, the moment the fish are out of the water, they
commence roasting and eating them, which they do without cleaning
or any other preparation; and when they have satisfied
themselves, should any remain, they carry them home for their
women and children, who have been employed during the day in
procuring fern-root, which they call <i>dingowa</i>, and a part
of which they give the men in exchange for fish. When Pamphlet
arrived among them, they had no more idea that water could be
made hot than that it could be made solid; and on his heating
some in a tin pot which he had saved when wrecked, the whole
tribe gathered round them and watched, the pot till it began to
boil, when they all took to their heels, shouting and screaming;
nor could they be persuaded to return till they saw him pour the
water out and clean the pot, when they slowly ventured back, and
carefully covered the place where the water was spilt with sand.
During the whole of our countrymen's stay among them, they were
never reconciled to this operation of boiling.</p>
<p>The women weave a strong neat kind of net with rushes; with
one or two of these each native is furnished to carry fish,
dingowa, or any thing else they may pick up. The nets used for
fishing are made by the men from the bark of the kurrajong
(hibiscus heterophyllus), a shrub which is vary common in the
swamps. It is difficult at first sight to distinguish them from
nets made of hemp. They have also nets of a much larger size,
which they use in taking the kangaroo.</p>
<p>Both sexes go perfectly naked; nor are the females at all
abashed at appearing in that state before a stranger. They do not
seem to have any ornaments, though they were much gratified with
strips of red cloth and bunting, with which we decorated their
heads; and some of the scarlet tail-feathers of a black cockatoo,
which I gave them, had nearly produced a quarrel among them.
Several articles of clothing were also given them, but they were
invariably taken off and hidden as soon as they arrived at their
camp; nor did we see ever any article again after they once
became possessed of it.</p>
<p>Each individual of this tribe above the age of six years had
the cartilage of the nose perforated, and many of them
(especially the children) wore large pieces of stick or bone
thrust through it, in such a manner as completely to stop the
nostrils. This operation is always performed by the same person,
whose office is hereditary, and confers some privileges, such as
receiving fish, &amp;c. from the others. It was held in this
tribe by a fine intelligent young man, who was called the Doctor
by our men. His father held a similar situation in another tribe
on the south side of the river.</p>
<p>These tribes are distinguished from each other by the
different colours they use in painting their bodies. Those on the
north side blacken themselves all over with charcoal and bees'
wax, which, with wild honey, they procure in abundance; and those
on the south side paint themselves with a sort of red jaspar,
which they burn and reduce to a powder. Other tribes make use of
a white pigment, with which (having previously blackened
themselves) they daub various parts of their body. Their chief
appeared to possess an unlimited authority over them; he was a
tall, middle-aged man, with an intelligent countenance. He had
two wives, which (though it sometimes occurs) does not seem to be
common among them. However, only one of them lived with him as a
wife; the other was employed, while he ate or slept, in going
among the other huts and collecting from their inhabitants fish,
fern-root, &amp;c.&mdash;a tribute which was daily paid to him
without murmuring, although the rest of the tribe in consequence
occasionally fell short themselves. The chief possesses nets both
for fish and kangaroo, but seldom uses them except for his
amusement. Neither does his head wife ever go out to gather
fern-root with the rest of the women. The same practice of
scarifying themselves with sharp shells prevails here, as at
Sydney; but most of these Indians were cut more deeply, and all
with great regularity. The women here, as at Sydney, all lose the
first two joints of the little finger of the left hand; but the
men do not extract a front tooth on their approach to puberty, as
is invariably the case in the vicinity of Port Jackson. The
amputation of the finger is performed by the same person who
bores the noses.</p>
<p>Pamphlet and Finnegan, while among the Indians, were regularly
painted twice a day, and were frequently importuned to allow
themselves to be further ornamented by scarifying the body and
boring the nose; but on their signifying that they did not wish
it, the natives always desisted; nor was any violence used
against them during their whole residence.</p>
<p>On only one occasion, during our stay, did the Indians show
the least inclination towards pilfering, although they were
constantly begging for every thing they saw. Our men had been
employed on shore all day cutting timber, and several natives had
been with them in the afternoon. Upon returning in the evening,
it was found that somebody had stolen the best falling axe we
had: this, as we had originally but two, we could ill spare; and,
on Mr. Penson's informing me of the circumstance, I resolved to
recover it if possible. I accordingly took the jolly-boat, and,
with Mr. Penson and Bowen, pulled up to their encampment. On
landing, several of them came out to meet us, and to them I
endeavoured to make known our loss by signs. They soon teemed to
understand me, and signified that they would accompany me to the
place where it was hidden, which several of them accordingly
prepared to do. However, I observed that they dropped back one by
one, so that by the time I had advanced half a mile, there were
only one old man and one young man left with me; one of these I
was determined to secure till the axe was restored. I had some
difficulty in making them keep up with me, as they were
continually foaming pretences to get into the bush; but I at
length succeeded in bringing them opposite the vessel, Here the
old nun made signs that he and I should stop till the young man
brought the axe, and we accordingly halted while the other was
soon out of sight in the wood. I then happened to take my eye a
moment off my companion, when he darted into the bush with
amazing celerity, and was out of sight in an instant. We now
supposed that our friendly intercourse with them was at an end,
and that we should not again see the axe; but at eight o'clock
next morning we found a number of them on the beach, abreast of
the vessel, shouting and elevating the axe, which, on my going on
shore, was delivered to me by the old man who had shown such
speed the evening before. So this incident, instead of
interrupting our good understanding, rendered our mutual
confidence more strong; for several of the natives ventured on
board that day for the first time, whereas they had always before
refused to do so with signs of fear. From this time forward not a
single day passed, on which we had not ten or twelve of them on
board at a time. They seemed very curious, inquiring the use of
every thing they saw, but it was longer before we could persuade
them to eat any thing with us. However, when they once began, it
was by no means an easy matter to satisfy them. Our rats and
goats struck them with particular astonishment. We could not
prevail on them to approach the latter, of whose horns they
seemed to have a great awe. They were, however, continually
caressing the cats, and holding them up for the admiration of
their companions on shore.</p>
<p>I could not ascertain that these people had any idea whatever
of religion. They do not stand in awe of either good or evil
spirits; nor did the Englishmen we found with them ever observe
any thing like religious ceremony or prayer among them, during
all the time of their residence.</p>
<p>The women are far more fortunate than those in the
neighbourhood of Sydney, where they are abused in the most cruel
way by the men; and where the marriage ceremony consists of
seizing the bride and beating her till she is senseless. Pamphlet
assured me that, during his residence among these natives (nearly
seven months), he never saw a woman struck or ill-treated except
by one of her own sex. Indeed, save among the women, he never saw
a quarrel in that or any other tribe he was with. The women that
I saw were far superior in personal beauty to the men, or indeed
to any natives of this country whom I have yet seen. Many of them
are tall, straight, and well formed; and there were two, in
particular, whose shape and features were such as no white woman
need have been ashamed of.</p>
<p>This tribe amounted in number to about thirty men, sixteen or
seventeen women, and about twenty children. Their quarrels with
neighbouring tribes are frequent, and often end fatally. As some
of them were witnessed by Pamphlet and his companion, it may not
be uninteresting to insert here the description which they gave
me of two, at which they were present, and which I took down at
the moment. That which Finnegan describes may be considered as
the most faithful, as he witnessed it only two days before we
found him, and the particulars were then strongly impressed on
his mind; I give it nearly in his own words.</p>

<h4>ACCOUNT OF A FIGHT AMONG THE NATIVES OF<br>
MORETON BAY, WITNESSED BY JOHN FINNEGAN.</h4>
<p>"The natives at Pumice-stone River having a quarrel with
another tribe, at the distance of five-and-twenty miles to the
S.W., they were about to set off for the latter place in order to
decide it; and as I was then living with the chief of the
Pumice-stone River tribe, he insisted on taking me with him. We
accordingly set out early one morning, travelling from ten to
fifteen miles daily. Our party consisted of ten men, eight or
nine women, and fourteen children, the king, his son, and myself.
The men carried the nets, and the women were loaded with
fern-root, &amp;c.; all parties, men and women, being armed with
spears. On the third day we halted, and all the men went out
fishing. After eating a hearty meal, they commenced painting and
decorating themselves with feathers. The king himself covered me
all over with charcoal and bees' wax; and, when all were dressed,
we again went forward, and in a short time arrived at a number of
huts, which had been erected for the occasion. They were so
numerous that I could hardly count them; and each tribe (for
there were many tribes assembled to see the fight) appeared to
have their huts distinct from the other. On our arriving within a
small distance of the encampment, we all sat down; and as soon as
we were perceived, the assembled multitude began to shout, and
immediately my companions were visited by several of their
friends, and all began to weep piteously. Shortly afterwards the
chief of the tribe on whose ground we were came to us, and having
conversed for some time with our chief, he pointed out a place on
which we might build huts for ourselves. The women of our party
then immediately commenced building, and in less than two hours
had finished five or six commodious huts, in which we all rested
that night. The next morning a large party, including our chief
and several of his men, went out kangaroo hunting. They were not,
however, very successful, having only caught one large kangaroo.
They, however, gave me a great piece of the hind quarter, of
which they made me eat very heartily; and here I will observe,
that at all times, whether they had much or little, fish or
kangaroo, or any thing else, they always gave me as much as I
could eat. The same evening at sunset, the whole party, carrying
fire-sticks, went away about a mile and a half to where the
battle took place the next day, the chief leaving me with his
wife and two children in the hut. He however returned some time in
the night, for I found him at my back when I woke in the morning.
The next day, after breakfast, the ceremony of painting was gone
through afresh, and we marched in regular line, our tribe having
been joined by several strangers, all of whom seemed much
rejoiced at my accompanying them. We shortly arrived at a level
piece of ground, in which had been dug a circular pit about forty
feet in diameter. I was now left in care of the chief's wife at a
short distance from this pit; but being anxious to view the
fight, in spite of her endeavours, I went up towards it. She,
however, followed me, calling out and weeping; upon which one of
the men of our tribe came to me, and taking my hand, led me up to
the pit. I there saw a woman of my tribe, and one of another,
fighting desperately with sticks. The battle did not, however,
last long, as they appeared to be quite in earnest; and in five
minutes their heads arms, &amp;c. being dreadfully cut and
swelled, our woman was declared the conqueror, and other not
being able any longer to oppose her. The victory was announced by
a loud shout from all parties, and the amazonian combatants were
immediately carried away by their respective friends. The man who
had brought me to the pit still continued to hold my hand, and I
observed his whole body tremble like an aspen leaf. The chief's
wife now came again to me, and endeavoured by every means in her
power to force me away; but finding I still refused, she went for
her husband, who immediately came, and taking away my spear,
forced me out of the crowd. He then called several other chiefs
around me, and showed me to them. This caused great talking and
laughing among them, from surprise at my colour and appearance.
The king then addressed them at some length, apparently asking
them not to hurt me, which they gave me to understand by signs
that they would not. I was then delivered up to our chief's wife
once more, who led me back to the place where we were left
before. I had however a good view of the pit, round which the
whole crowd still remained. I now found that, while I had been
engaged with the chiefs, another fight had taken place in the
pit, for I presently saw a man carried out by his friends, who
were of our tribe, bleeding profusely at the side from a
spear-wound. He was brought down to where I was, and place on two
men's knees, with some kangaroo-skins spread over him; the men,
women, and children howling and lamenting, much in the manner of
the lower Irish. They supplied him with water from time to time,
but his wound was evidently mortal, and in less than an hour he
expired. The chief's wife then took me away a short distance from
where he by, and the whole party set to work immediately to skin
him; but from the distance at which I stood, I could not perceive
the maimer in which they did it. In the mean time two more men
had entered the ring to fight; and here it may not be amiss to
observe, that previous to each fight the same ceremony is used
that is described by Thomas Pamphlet in the combat which he
witnessed. The third fight was now going on, while our party were
engaged in skinning their deceased companion; when it appeared,
from a tremendous shout, that some unlooked-for event had
happened in the pit. I afterwards learned that the spectators
judged that foul play had taken place between the combatants. The
crowd upon this drew away from the pit; and our party,
accompanied by those tribes that were friendly to them, formed
themselves in a line, while their adversaries did the same
opposite to them. The battle then became general. Several from
each side would advance, and having thrown their spears, again
retire to the line, in the manner of light infantry. Others would
get behind the trees, and there watch an opportunity to burl
their spears with greater effect In this manner the fight
continued upwards of two hours, during which time many retired
from the line severely wounded, and another man of our party was
killed. What number may have been killed on the other side I had
no means of ascertaining. Our party now began to give way, which
being observed by the women and children with whom I was, they
made signs to me to accompany them; and with the exception of
those who were employed in skinning the body, we made off. Not
being able, however, to run as fast as the rest, I was soon in
the midst of the opposite party, who, however, notwithstanding my
fears, did not attempt to hurt me, but merely laughed and pointed
at me as they passed by, showing the same marks of wonder as the
chiefs had done in the morning. I then walked back to the huts
which we had left that morning, but found nobody there. However,
I sat down by the fire, and towards evening they began to return,
a few at a time. Just before dark I saw a large crowd approach,
who (it seems) were bringing the bodies of the two men who had
been killed. They had them down about twenty rods from the huts,
and began a great lamentation over them. The first body was
completely flayed, but they had not yet had leisure to don the
other. I attempted to approach, but was immediately prevented by
all hands, and forced to return to the fire. Shortly afterwards
our chief and his wife came back, and instantly commenced packing
up their nets, &amp;c. in order to depart. Two large fires were
lighted where the bodies lay, in which, as I judged from the
noise as well as the offensive smell, they wore both consumed.
Immediately after this our whole party decamped; and having
travelled more than half a mile, we stopped for the night. Very
early next morning we again started, and travelled all day with
great expedition, without ever halting or eating any thing. Among
our party were four women and three men wounded, the latter very
severely. They however contrived, though with difficulty, to keep
up with us. I had observed, during this day's march, two men, one
of whom belonged to our tribe, and another to a tribe which was
friendly to us, each of whom carried something on his shoulder,
but did not keep the same path with us, walking through the bush
at a little distance abreast of us. Being curious to know what it
was they carried, I attempted several times to approach them; but
as soon as this was observed, I was invariably brought back by
the others, who made signs to me not to go near them. We
travelled that day about eight or ten miles, and towards evening
arrived at the edge of a large swamp, where we halted, and huts
were instantly erected by the women, who were afterwards obliged
to go out and procure fern-root for the whole party, the men
never providing any thing but fish or game. I lodged as usual
with the chief, at a little distance from whose hut I observed
the two men hang up their burthens, which I again attempted to
approach, but was (as before) prevented. Here we remained two
days, during which a large fire was kept constantly burning
underneath the trees on which these mysterious burthens were
hanging. On the evening of the second day, I once more attempted
to find out of what they consisted, though I strongly suspected
they were the skins of the two men who had been killed. The old
chief, on seeing me go near them, ran after me, calling loudly to
me to return; but I persevered, and at last reached the place. I
now saw that my conjecture was right: the two skins were
stretched each on four spears, and drying over the fire. The skin
of the head was divided into two parts, and hung down with the
hair on it. The soles of the feet and palms of the hands were
also hanging down, and the nails still attached firmly to the
skin. Several of the men and women were sitting round the fire
under the skins, and now invited me to sit down with them, which
I did. They then gave me some kangaroo-skin to decorate my arms
and head, and seemed to wish me to sing to them; but on my making
signs that it was not proper to do so while the remains of our
friends were not buried, they seemed surprised, and afterwards
told me by signs that they were much pleased at my refusal. After
sitting with them about half an hour, the chief's wife came and
brought me back to the hut. Shortly afterwards, all the men
dressed themselves in kangaroo-skins, and one of them in an old
rug jacket which I had, and with one or two of the women, held a
consultation round the fire, each person having a fire-stick in
his hand. After conversing about half an hour, two of the party
separated from the rest, and having taken down the skins, set off
at full speed through the bush; the rest followed, shouting and
making much noise. After this I saw nothing more of the skins,
nor do I know what became of them. In about three-quarters of an
hour the party returned; and the man who had taken my old jacket
gave it me back. The next morning we returned towards the
Pumice-stone River by the same path which we had travelled to the
fight, and the natives followed their usual occupations of
fishing and hunting as if nothing had happened."</p>
<p>The fight which Pamphlet described as having been witnessed by
him was not fortunately so sanguinary; and as the termination was
very different from that above described, I shall insert it
here.</p>

<h4>ACCOUNT OF A FIGHT WITNESSED BY THOMAS PAMPHLET.</h4>
<p>"About the time of our first arrival at Pumice-stone River,
the young native whom we called the Doctor, and who used to bore
the noses and scarify the skins of the rest of the tribe, had
been wounded in the knee with a spear, while out on a hunting
expedition, by a native of another tribe, at a distance of fifty
miles to the northward. As the spear had broken in the wound,
there was a good deal of inflammation in his leg, when he applied
to me to cure him. This I effected by extracting a large splinter
from his knee, and in a short time he was quite recovered. As
soon as his cure was effected, and he was able once more to go
out fishing and hunting, he sallied forth, accompanied by several
of his tribe, in order to take satisfaction of the man who had
wounded him; and having a great liking for me, on account of my
having cured him, he insisted on my going with him.</p>
<p>"The spot appointed for the combat was a small ring, about
twenty-five feet in diameter, about three feet deep, and
surrounded by a palisade of sticks. The crowd assembled to see
the fight amounted to about 500 men, women, and children; and the
combatants, followed by those who were friendly to them
respectively, approached the ring in single file, and drew up in
a regular manner on opposite aides of the circle. The whole
assembly were well armed, many of them having five or six spears
each. The two combatants then entered the ring, and having laid
down their spears in opposite rows; point to point, began walking
backwards and forwards, talking loudly to each other and using
violent gestures, as if to inflame their passions to a due height
The women had previously been driven away, and the most profound
silence reigned in the rest of the assembly. After about ten
minutes spent in this way, they commenced picking up their spears
with their feet, keeping their eyes fixed on each other, so as to
prevent either from taking advantage of the other's stooping. In
this manner they proceeded till they had each three spears, which
they stuck in the ground, ready for immediate use. At the moment
when they commenced thus picking up their spears, a tremendous
shout burst from the spectators, who immediately relapsed into
their former silence. All now being ready, one or two of the
friends of each party spoke across the ring for a few minutes;
and as soon as they ceased, the Doctor threw his spear with all
his force at the other, who, however, succeeded in warding it off
with a kind of wooden shield called an <i>elemong</i>, into
which, however, it penetrated three or four inches. The other
then threw in his turn; but his spear was also warded off in the
same manner. The third spear which the Doctor threw penetrated
quite through the shoulder of his adversary, who instantly fell,
when one or two of his friends, jumping into the ring, pulled out
the spear, and returned it to its owner; and the tournament
concluded with loud huzzas from all parties. They all then
retired to huts, which had been erected for the occasion, and the
next day they again met at the ring, in order to give the friends
of the wounded man an opportunity to avenge his quarrel. But it
appeared that no one wished to do so, as each had now wounded the
other, and a reconciliation took place between the two tribes,
which was announced by shouting. dancing, &amp;c.; and a parcel
of boys were selected from each party, and sent into the ring to
wrestle: after which both tribes joined in a hunting expedition,
which lasted a week; but my feet being sore, I was consigned to
the care of the women."</p>
<hr class="2">
<br>
<p>Messrs. Oxley and Stirling had named Thursday, the 4th
December, for their return to the vessel; but after waiting
dinner till past seven o'clock, we gave them over for that night;
and were employed on the following day in completing our wood and
water, so as to be ready for sea the next morning. On Friday
evening, at son-set, I went ashore and made-a huge fire, in order
to serve as a beacon for the boat, which, however, not having
arrived at ten o'clock, I went to bed, somewhat uneasy, lest same
accident should have happened: however, after I had been in bed
about an hour, Mr. Penson came down to let me know that he had
heard and seen a gun fire. On this I rose, and just before
midnight the boat came alongside, having rowed with very little
intermission since five o'clock in the morning. They were all
much fatigued, particularly Messrs. Oxley and Stirling, who had
not been well before they left the vessel, and now appealed quite
exhausted, from constant exposure to a hot sun for twelve or
fifteen hours daily in an open boat. Our hardships were rendered
less tolerable from our having been so shamefully robbed by our
servants, in consequence of which these gentlemen had no wine or
spirits to take with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley told us, that after losing the first day in the
examination of a large creek, which Finnegan mistook for the
river, they had on the following day entered the river itself, by
an entrance three miles wide, and had proceeded above fifty miles
from the mouth. The water was fresh about eighteen miles up, even
at high water, and where they left off, the tide still rose four
feet and a half. This magnificent river, the further examination
of which they were obliged with reluctance to postpone to a more
favourable opportunity, was, at the termination of their
progress, above half a mile wide, and eight fathoms deep; and
from an eminence near it they obtained a view of its course,
meandering for nearly thirty miles through a rich flat country,
clothed with large timber, among which was an unknown species of
pine in considerable abundance, which front its size, and the
apparently excellent quality of the wood, will probably prove a
valuable acquisition to the colony, it being well calculated for
ships' spars. The soil on both banks was a rich black loam, and
in every part the wild indigo was growing in abundance.</p>
<p>Having been thus successful beyond our expectations in the
main object of our expedition, and the cutter being ready for
sea, we got under way in the morning of Saturday, 6th December,
with the last quarter of flood tide, and the wind at N.E., in
order to work out of the bay; but while we were on the last tack
that was necessary to clear Moreton-head, the wind suddenly
chopped round to the southward, and came on to blow with great
violence. The gale continued till Monday afternoon, though it was
less strong than that we encountered off Break-sea Spit, and then
it moderated as suddenly as it commenced. The wind then veering
to the N.E. we stood away before it, having been driven about
twenty miles to the northward during the gale.</p>
<p>The next morning, about eight o'clock, we were within a few
miles of Turtle Island; and Mr. Stirling and I, who had, ever
since we left it, been anticipating the pleasure we should feel
in bringing back a quantity of turtle to our friends in Sydney,
with much difficulty prevailed on Mr. Oxley to come to with the
cutter under the lee of the island. We then went ashore; but,
owing to the late gale, the breakers ran so very high, and the
tide was so far in, that though we saw numbers of turtle swimming
round the island, not one of them was able to land. However, we
procured a large quantity of mutton-birds' eggs, together with
several birds, and a large bag of spinach, with which we went
back to the cutter, and immediately got under way. The eggs are
excellent, and are with difficulty distinguished from hens'.
Indeed, one of our men assured me that he had often sold them in
Sydney market for hens' eggs. They afforded us a dish of
excellent pancakes, which, with the spinach, were a real treat to
us, as we had been long without any vegetables; and Mr. Oxley,
Mr. Penson, and some of the men, had become badly afflicted with
the scurvy. The breeze continuing fair and steady, we ran on for
the remainder of the day, and through the night, with all sail
set; and next day at ten A.M. we expected, according to our
reckoning, that we were off Smoky Cape, about forty miles to the
north of Port Macquarie. It was, however, so hazy that we could
not distinguish the land at that time; but in a quarter of an
hour, on its suddenly clearing up, we found to our surprise that
we were passing Port Macquarie, having thus in twenty-two hours
run 205 miles, of which distance, as the cutter never exceeded
seven and a half per hour by the log, the current must have
drifted us about fifty-six miles.</p>
<p>We immediately hauled in for the shore, and the sea breeze
shortly afterwards setting in, Mr. Stirling and I were enabled to
land at about one o'clock, Mr. Oxley being unable to move from
the swelling in his legs. We were received with the same
hospitality which we had before experienced from Captain Allman
and his officers, who immediately supplied us with fowls,
vegetables, and every thing in their power, which they thought
would be acceptable to us. We dined with Captain Allman; but
having promised Mr. Oxley to return to the vessel by four
o'clock, P.M., we took a reluctant leave of our friends, and,
accompanied by Mr. Fenton, returned to the cutter. Here, to our
great satisfaction, Mr. Fenton was with some difficulty enabled
to persuade Mr. Oxley to go on shore and remain for the night.
Accordingly we all returned, and after spending a pleasant
evening, and enjoying a good night's rest, on Thursday at noon we
once more got under way, and on Saturday evening, December 13th,
at six o'clock, we had the pleasure of coming to an anchor in
Sydney Cove.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">We</span> left Sydney, March 21st, in a large
open boat, of twenty-nine feet six inches extreme length over
all, and ten feet beam, belonging to William Farrel and Richard
Parsons, for the Five Islands, to take in cedar. The crew
consisted of Richard Parsons, John Finnegan, John Thompson, and
myself. We had a considerable quantity of provision, flour, pork,
&amp;c. for the purpose of buying cedar, and four gallons of
water and five of rum. About four o'clock the same evening, when
within seven or eight miles of our destination, a violent gale
came on from the west, which forced us to lower all sail, and
keep the boat before the sea. The night came on with heavy rain
and increasing wind, but we did not lose sight of land till shut
out by darkness. The gale continued with unabated violence for
five days, when it moderated; but the sea continued to run so
very high, that we were still obliged to keep the boat before it,
without being able to carry any sail till the eleventh day, viz.
2d April, when the sea being much fallen we made sail, supposing
that the current had drifted us to the southward, and that we
were then off Van Diemen's Land. We had no compass, but we
steered by the sun, as near as we could guess, a N.W. course,
expecting very soon to make the land in the neighbourhood of the
Five Islands, our original destination. Our small stock of water
was totally expended on the second day, and the rain we caught in
the commencement of the gale was so spoiled by salt water, that
we were forced to throw it away. Our sufferings were dreadful for
the following thirteen days, having nothing to drink but rum. We
were almost unable to speak, and could with difficulty understand
each other. John Thompson, a Scotchman, the best hand in the boat
(having been an old man of war's man), had become quite delirious
from drinking salt water, and was totally useless to us. On the
fifteenth day (6th April), a heavy shower of rain fell, and our
sails being lowered and spread, we caught about a bucket and a
half; but from the sails having been so much drenched with
salt-water, it was almost useless to us. On the eighteenth day
(9th April), a light mizzling rain fell, when we caught a
bucket-full, which was much better. Thompson recovered a little
on getting some of it, but still continued severely purged and
otherwise affected by the salt water he had drank. We still
continued steering the same course, N.W. as we imagined, till the
nineteenth day (10th April), when about eleven o'clock A.M. John
Finnegan having gone up to the mast-head, said that he saw land
right a-head, which he declared to be the headland of Port
Stephen, he having formerly worked there; but not being able to
credit him, I went up to the mast-head myself, and, after looking
earnestly for some time, was unable to determine whether it was
land or a cloud: however, we determined to steer for it; but
towards evening we lost sight of it entirely. Thompson was at
this time very bad, and Finnegan had become quite deaf; while
Parsons and myself, though not so bad, were hardly able to speak
or move: a dreadful lassitude came over us, and it was with much
difficulty we could keep our watch of two hours each. We
continued in this state till the twenty-first day (12th April),
when at daylight, it being my watch, I distinctly saw land
a-head, which, as the morning advanced, appeared to be three or
four islands. We made all sail for them. Thompson, on hearing
this joyful news, apparently revived a little; we had been
obliged to bind him hand and foot, three or four days before, to
prevent his jumping overboard, being completely deranged: his
feet were now untied, when he immediately came aft to me,
imagining we had already been on shore, and entreated for God's
sake I would give him fresh water. When he found I was not able
to comply with his request, he became worse; raving in the most
incoherent manner, saying he had just dined with his family in
Scotland, &amp;c.: he then lay down near the well, and in the
course of an hour expired. We now stood on for the land till
about ten o'clock, P.M. when, expecting to get on shore at
daylight next morning, we hove the boat to, being then, according
to our judgment, about an hour's run from the shore. We saw
plainly the natives round their fires, and intended to keep clear
of them, if possible, the next day. About midnight the boat
struck on a reef of rocks, but being light, the heave of the sea
carried her over it without damage; and when daylight broke, we
found we had drifted so far to sea that the land was barely
visible: however, we had a fine fresh favourable breeze and
smooth water, and again steered for the same land, and by sunset
were within two or three miles of shore, but a little to the
north of the place where we hove to the night before. We were,
however, fearful of venturing on shore on account of the natives,
whom we again distinctly saw; we therefore kept on through the
night, steering north. In the morning the wind was light and the
water smooth, and we were close in with the shore. I now saw
plainly a run of fresh water trickling through the beach, and
proposed to take the boat's running rigging and make it fast to
the keg, and swim ashore with it, by which means they could haul
the fresh water on board; but this was objected to by Parsons,
who being half owner of the boat, was afraid of her being lost:
we therefore continued our course all day, and towards evening
Parsons declared he was dying, and that he must have fresh water
if the boat was lost. We therefore looked out for a place to run
her ashore or land, but the breakers and swell prevented us; so
we continued our course all that night under easy sail.
Thompson's body had continued on board all this time, as we
constantly expected to be able to land and bury it: it now,
however, began to grow offensive, and we consulted whether we
should not throw it overboard. This was agreed to after some
altercation. He was then searched, and in his waistcoat we found
his ticket-of-leave sewed up. Parsons then bound a handkerchief
over his face, and he was thrown overboard. He had been kept so
long that he swam as light as a cork on the water. We continued
the whole of this day, the twenty-fourth (15th April), running
along shore to the northward, without being able to effect a
landing; and during the night we ran on the same course under
easy sail. The next morning Finnegan, who was at the helm, said
he saw a bight in which we could anchor, with a stream of fresh
water running in it. We accordingly steered into it, the water
being tolerably smooth, and let go our anchor at about half a
quarter of a mile from the shore, and payed out about forty
fathoms of cable to let her drift, further in. I then stripped,
and having made the running rigging fast to the keg, jumped over
and attempted to swim for the shore; but I was so weak and
exhausted, that, what with the little surf, and what with the
keg, I was in the water near an hour and a half before I could
succeed in landing; but no sooner did my foot touch the ground
than I ran to the fresh, water, and lying down by it, I drank
like a horse. I then returned to the beach for the keg, which I
again left and rap bade for another drink. This happened three or
four times; and when I attempted to fill the keg, I was quite
unable to do it, from weakness and the quantity of water I had
swallowed. In the meantime it began to blow very fresh from the
eastward, and my companions called loudly to me to come on board
to assist in hauling the boat off; but the surf ran so high, and
my weakness was such, that I did not dare to venture again into
the water: I therefore called to them, as the breeze freshened,
to cut the cable and let her run ashore. This, after some time,
they did; and with the help of a little swimming, both got safe
on shore. The boat grounded on the sandy beach, and in less than
five minutes her bottom was stove in. The eagerness of my
companions for fresh water even exceeded mine. I had brought on
shore a pint tin pot to fill the keg: Parsons emptied this
thirteen times in succession; while Finnegan lay down in the
water, and drank to such excess that his stomach could not retain
it, but threw it all up again. This he repeated four several
times. We had all of us stripped off our clothes for the purpose
of swimming on shore, and the surf now ran so high, that it was
impossible to approach the boat for the purpose of getting them;
so that we were all perfectly naked, with the exception of an old
rug jacket that Finnegan picked up next morning. The beach on
which the boat struck was a low sand, surrounded by sand-hills,
which did not even afford fire-wood; but had it been ever so
abundant, we had not the means of kindling a fire; we therefore
ascended the hill, and lay down on the sand to pass the night. It
was raining heavily, and I being the weakest was placed in the
middle between my companions. We suffered much throughout the
night from cold and hunger; and next morning, when day broke, we
found the boat had gone to pieces, and that some few of the
things in her had drifted ashore. We then went down to the beach,
and found three bags of flour, two of which were totally spoiled;
but the salt-water had not penetrated above two inches into the
third. We therefore emptied those which were spoiled, and each
took from twenty to thirty pounds of good flour, being as much as
we thought we were able to carry. We still imagined we were far
to the southward of Port Jackson. Four or five days before we
were wrecked, we saw many flying-fish and dolphins, and caught
one or two of the former; but it never struck us on that account
that we were to the northward of Port Jackson. Accordingly, after
making a wretched meal of flour and water, which we mixed in a
bucket that had drifted ashore, we set out along the beach in a
northerly direction, and continued to walk, as expeditiously as
our weakness would allow, till near dark. We then observed a
native path striking into the bush, which apparently cut off a
bluff head before us: this we determined to follow, and in a
short time we saw before us a black woman and child, carrying
water in a bark vessel. Fearing that if we were seen, this woman
would alarm her tribe, we concealed ourselves till they had
passed, and then continued our journey. There were several large
huts near where we saw the woman; but the men were probably
employed in fishing, as we did not see any. After proceeding
about a mile, we reached the beach on the other side of the head;
and on leaving the bush saw a large hut, near which was a boy
amusing himself by throwing a spear at some crows. There were a
great number of native dogs round the hut, but they did not
appear to notice us. After a short time the boy turning round saw
us, and instantly ran into the hut, from which a man now made his
appearance. He hastily snatched a spear from the side of the hut,
and then took hold of the child with the intention of running
into the bush; but a very large woman ran out, and throwing the
child on her back, instantly disappeared. I now called to the man
to stop, when, to our astonishment, he answered in good English,
"What do you want? Do you wish to kill me?" and then followed the
woman. This circumstance convinced us that we were in the
neighbourhood of some English settlement, and gave us great
spirits, as we had now hopes of shortly reaching some place where
our wants would be relieved. It will be afterwards seen that we
were wrong, and we could never account for this Moreton
islander's being able to speak English, while the natives of
Moreton Bay appeared never to have seen a white man before.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Captain Flinders encountered them in 1799; but
Pamphlet must have been in a delirium when he thought the native
spoke English. [Not a true paragraph break.]]</p>
<p>I then desired Finnegan to go into the hut and fetch some
fire, which he did; after which we proceeded, intending to stop
at the first fresh water, we fell in with. This happened in the
course of a mile: it was a shallow pool about six inches deep.
Here we made a fire, and having mixed some flour and water, made
cakes of it, and set them down to toast. While thus employed we
saw some native dogs, which appeared to have followed us from the
hut; and shortly afterwards I saw a man's head peeping over the
bank behind us, and then two or three more. We beckoned them to
approach, which, after some time, they did, when we offered them
some cake, which they pretended to eat, but immediately spat it
out again. Their number now amounted to about twelve; and they
began to feel us about the breast and shoulders in a manner that
greatly alarmed us: we therefore prepared to move again, as soon
as we had finished our meal. They now became very urgent that we
should return with them to the huts we had first seen; but we
persisted in proceeding to the northward. They had nets on their
backs, with which they made signs that they would catch fish for
us; but when they found we were obstinate, some of them prepared
to accompany us, and one or two of them took up our bags of flour
to carry for us. We proceeded about a mile with them, when we
came to another set of huts, into which our conductors invited
us; and on our consenting, they appeared quite happy, dancing and
singing around us. They then made a fire, near which I lay down
to sleep with my bag under my head, while one of the natives
remained, as if to take care of me, and keep up the fire. My
companions went into one of the large huts, where every sort of
attention was shown them, and passed the night there. In the
morning, after having breakfasted on some of our cakes, we again
set out, accompanied by our kind friendly natives, who brought us
down to the beach, and again seemed very anxious that we should
return the way we came, but they did not offer to use any kind of
force. We, however, determined to proceed to the northward,
supposing that that course would ultimately lead us to Port
Jackson; and when they found we would not return, some of them,
as before, accompanied us on our way. After proceeding about
three miles, they led us into the bush, where we found more huts.
Here again they wished us to remain; but after sitting with them
about an hour, we proceeded much against their wish, accompanied
by one of their number. We walked along the beach, and passed
several more huts, but the inhabitants did not appear to take any
notice of us. At the last of these huts our guide left us,
pointing out another station at some distance, and making signs
that, by proceeding, we should fall is with a canoe. He also took
us to a rising ground, where he indicated a point of land at some
distance, which (as the place where we were appeared to be an
island) we imagined to be the main land. We then proceeded till
about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, when we found near
the beach four or fire large huts, apparently deserted; and there
being a good run of water near them, we resolved to pass the
night there. The next day, finding that the natives did not
appear, we determined to remain till the following morning, in
order to refresh ourselves a little. We then again proceeded on
our journey, and continued travelling along the beach for the
following five days, without meeting any natives, or any thing
worth notice. Our feet being sore, we were not able to walk far
at a time, and we helped out our flour from time to time with
cockles and other shell-fish, which we met with in our way. On
the fifth day we arrived at a high sandy point, where we found
our further progress stopped by a channel about three miles wide,
through which the tide appeared to run very rapidly. We were now
certain that we had been thrown on an island, and our thoughts
were therefore directed towards the means of reaching the main
land. At the back of the sand-hill, we found a small well of
fresh water, which had been dug by the natives; near this we made
a fire and passed the night. We observed fires on the opposite
shore, and early the next morning we kindled a large one down on
the beach, which being seen by the natives, one of them passed
over in a large canoe. As he approached, however, we retired
behind the hill; and when he had hauled up his canoe, he made
directly for the fire. We then made our appearance, but no sooner
did he observe our colour than he ran back to his boat, and
jumping in, pushed rapidly off, shouting and roaring with all his
might. In the meantime, another canoe was launched from the
opposite side with two men, who met the first about half across
the channel, and they then both paddled towards the place where
we were sitting. When they had landed, we were unwilling to
approach them, lest they should again be frightened, and
therefore remained sitting quietly by our fire. The three men
then approached cautiously towards us, and, having examined us at
a distance, returned to their boats, and made signals with gome
pieces of bark to those on the opposite shore, when two more
canoes pushed off, with five or six men in each; and, as soon as
these had landed, the whole party, to the number of fourteen,
approached us. They were perfectly naked, and had neither spears
nor any other kind of weapon with them. They still appeared shy
of coming near us, but at last one man came close to the fire,
and on our making signs, two or three more followed his example,
and in a short time the whole party had formed a circle round us.
Parsons happened to have a pair of scissors, which had belonged
to Thompson, and their beards being very long, he commenced
cutting them, which appeared to delight them greatly. They
remained an hour with us; and on rising to go away, we got our
bags on bur backs, and prepared to accompany them. This however
they did not seem inclined to permit, but ran down quickly to
their boats. We then endeavoured, to secure one of their canoes,
but they were too quick for us, and jumping in, pushed them
rapidly away. We now began to despair of being able to quit the
island, and returned very unhappy to some deserted huts, which we
had seen about three miles before we arrived at the point. Here
we passed the night, and next morning returned to the point, in
hopes of being still able to persuade the natives to take us
across the channel. On approaching it, our joy was excessive at
seeing the large canoe, that had appeared first on the preceding
day, lying on the beach without any person near it. On looking
round, however, we saw two natives, who were apparently
proceeding towards the place where our boat had been lost, for we
now found we had walked nearly round the island. They did not
appear to notice us, but kept on their way, upon which we
proceeded with all speed to secure the canoe. On examination, we
feared that it would not carry us all three with our bags,
&amp;c.; so, having consulted awhile, I agreed to remain behind,
and let Parsons and Finnegan cross over, when it was stipulated
that one of them should return and fetch me. They accordingly
pushed off, and I retreated to the top of the hill, from whence I
was able to see them the whole way across. On the canoe's
approaching the shore, I could perceive a great number of natives
walking out in the water to meet them, which made me very
apprehensive that they were about to destroy them; and when they
had landed, the whole crowd got round them and moved in towards
the bush, which at last hid them from my sight I remained looking
out till evening, expecting to see the canoe every minute, but in
vain. I therefore returned to the little well, where we had
passed the first night, and having kindled a fire, spent a very
wretched night, being greatly alarmed lest my companions should
have met with some misfortune. In the morning, I returned to the
beach and made a large fire, in hopes that, on seeing it, the
canoe would return for me. However, I was again disappointed, nor
was I able to perceive a single native on the shore the whole
day. I now began to lament my hard fate, in being left alone in
this desolate place, where, after the little flour I had was
expended, I must expect to perish either by hunger or the
hostility of the natives; and I returned to the well, fully
convinced that I should never again see either of my unfortunate
companions. The next morning, in walking along the shore, near
the point, I saw a large cask, which had drifted ashore from some
vessel. Conceiving it might contain some provisions or spirits, I
set to work to get some of the hoops off; but when I had
succeeded, I found, to my disappointment, that it contained only
six other casks, one inside the other. They appeared quite fresh,
and had not been long in the water: they seemed to be intended to
hold oil. While thus employed, I gave many an anxious look to the
opposite shore. I was proceeding up the hill again, when I saw
the canoe put off with two persons in it, whom, on its nearer
approach, I ascertained to be Finnegan and one of the natives. On
reaching the beach, the native took his nets on his shoulder, and
marched off in the same direction as the two who had before left
the canoe; but before he went, he made signs fox me to go back
with Finnegan. Finnegan now told me that nothing could exceed the
kindness with which they had been treated by the natives, who had
lodged them in a large hut by themselves, and given them as much
fish as they could eat, but that they could not before persuade
the natives to let the canoe come over for me; and it was only by
accident he was now enabled to come with the native I had seen,
who was going to visit his friends on the island. The tide was
how running out of the channel with great rapidity, and I wished
Finnegan either to pull along shore for some distance, or to wait
till the tide slacked; but he obstinately persisted in pulling
straight across without delay. I was obliged to comply, and we
pushed off; but no sooner had we left the shore than, in spite of
all our efforts, the current took us out to sea. We still
continued paddling for about an hour and a half, by which time we
had drifted out close to the breakers, which wore very heavy all
round us; and, as we had no hope of the canoe's living if she
once got among them, we redoubled our efforts but to no purpose:
we were soon in the midst of them; but, contrary to our
expectations, the little canoe rode it out much better than a
larger boat would have done. We soon got clear of them, and were
now in the open sea beyond them. The tide still continued very
strong, and we did not relax our efforts to gain the opposite
shore, where we saw the natives, and Parsons in the midst of
them, running along and watching our progress. At last, after
about five hours' hard paddling, the tide turned, and we readied
the shore in safety, eight miles from the place where we had
originally intended to land. We found Parsons and a number of
natives waiting on the beach, and were received by them with many
demonstrations of joy. They lifted the canoe into the bush, and
presented us with several roasted fish, and then conducted us to
their huts. They placed us in a very large well-built hut by
ourselves, and supplied us with fish, water, &amp;c. very
liberally. Here we remained for a week or ten days, during which
time we were most hospitably treated by the natives. They would
not, however, suffer us to approach the huts in which their women
were, for the first five or so; days; and at night five or six of
the younger men would sleep in front of our hut. But they
afterwards became less vigilant, and we used to pass through
their huts among the women as we pleased: Having now recovered
our strength in some degree, and being much refreshed, after
consulting together, Parsons and I resolved to continue our
endeavours to reach Sydney; but we had some difficulty in
persuading Finnegan to accompany us. He said that the blacks were
so friendly that he wished to remain with them, sooner than
encounter the difficulty and danger of attempting to return to
any of our settlements. At length, however, he consented to go;
and accordingly, early in the morning, about the tenth day, we
set oat in a westerly direction, in older to get round the large
bay, of which the island that we had originally been thrown upon
forms the eastern boundary. We had saved as much of our flour as
possible, so tint our stock still amounted to about forty pounds,
the greater part of which Parsons carried. Finnegan carried the
rest, and a stick of fire; while I bore an axe and a tin pot,
which we had saved from the wreck. The natives had pointed out an
inlet to us at the distance of twelve or fourteen miles, Where,
they informed us by signs, we should find a canoe, in which they
directed us to cross to an island, that was just visible, towards
the bottom of the bay. After we had proceeded about ten miles,
the fire went out, at which Parsons, who was a very violent,
passionate man, declared he would kill Finnegan, and struck him a
severe blow with the handle of the axe, and would in all
probability have murdered him had I not interfered. Finnegan new
begged for mercy, and said he would make all haste back to a
place where we had passed a native foe, about three or four miles
back. Accordingly he departed; but after waiting at least five
hours, on his not making his appearance, we resolved to return
ourselves. We left our flour, &amp;c. in the bush, and retraced
our steps to the fire. It was nearly extinguished, but after some
difficulty, I succeeded in making it burn. Here we stopped an
hour, in hopes that Finnegan would appear; but, on the approach
of evening, we thought it best to return to the place where we
had left our provisions. We therefore set forward, each carrying
a stick of fire this time, lest one should fail us. However, just
as we had reached the place, to our mortification and sorrow,
both sticks became extinguished, so that, our flour being the
only food we had, and having no fire to dress it, we determined
to take two or three pounds of it with us, and go back once more
to the fire, which we had taken the precaution of making up,
before we left it. The night was far advanced when we readied it
a second time, and having made a cake of our flour and eaten it,
we lay down far the night. In the morning we baked the remainder
of our flour; and, after remaining two or three hours, in
expectation that Finnegan would still come, we again walked on to
the place where we had left our provisions, each this time
carrying two large sticks of fire. We justly concluded that
Finnegan had returned to the natives, whom we had left the day
before, and therefore took no further concern about him, but
pushed on with what expedition we could towards the place where
the natives had given us to understand we should find the canoe.
About four o'clock, P.M., we arrived at some huts in the
immediate vicinity of the place they had pointed out, but were
too much fatigued to look for the canoe that night; and having
found water in a swamp hard by, and lighted a fire, we made a
cake for supper, and slept in the huts. From this time forwards,
we always took the precaution of lighting a fire at every two or
three miles as we travelled, that we might not again experience
the same inconvenience. Next morning, we proceeded to search for
the canoe, and found it exactly in the place where the natives
had given us to understand we should. We then took it down to the
wpter, in order to ascertain if it would carry us both; but it
had been so long exposed to the heat of the sun, that it 'opened
in several places, and would not float with one of us. This was a
dreadful disappointment, as the beaches began to be covered with
mangrove trees so thickly, as to prevent our proceeding along
them, and, having no shoes, we were unable to walk through the
bush. Therefore, after having consulted a short time, we
determined on going back to the blacks, especially as we expected
to find Finnegan there. We accordingly took our flour, &amp;c.
and immediately set out on our return. By night-fall we had
arrived within three or four miles of their huts; here we found a
fire and fresh water, and remained all night. Next morning, the
tide being high, the mangroves prevented us from walking on the
beach. We were therefore obliged to remain till towards low
water, when, just as we were about to start, we saw Finnegan,
accompanied by two natives, approaching us. It appeared that
these men had left their nets at the huts where we found the
canoe, and were fearful lest we should take them. They were
bringing Finnegan with them, that we might not hurt them; but as
soon as they saw us, they made signs to him to return with us.
This however we would not allow, as we were very much enraged at
his leaving us, in the way he did, without fire, and were
resolved to have nothing move to do with him. We therefore made
him proceed with the natives to the canoe-huts, while we went on
in the other direction, towards the huts where we had lived with
the natives. About half a mile before we reached them, We saw the
natives fishing: they had been very successful; and on seeing us
they immediately put a quantity of whitings on the fire, not
Would they allow us to proceed till we had filled ourselves with
them. They then conducted us to bur old quarters, and having
kindled a fire, they left us some fish, and went out again to
catch more. We now set about making ourselves as comfortable as
we could, when just at night-fall we were surprised by the return
of Finnegan and the two blacks with their nets. They had
travelled the distance in one day, which it took us three days to
perform, and had forced him to keep up with them. He was
dreadfully fatigued; but his two companions, after leaving him,
went but and procured fish and fern-root for him and themselves.
We now became reconciled to him, and were all as friendly as
ever, resting ourselves for the next three days in the hut, where
the blacks regularly brought us fish and fern-root, which latter
they called <i>dingowa</i>. We now consulted whether we had
better take one of their canoes by night, or endeavour to make
one ourselves; and having decided upon the latter, we made choice
of a tree, and immediately fell to work to cut it down and form a
canoe. We worked from sunrise to sunset for nearly three weeks,
having no other tool but the hatchet; and during the whole time
the natives brought us food, where we were at work, and likewise
left fish in our Inst daily. During the whole of this time,
Finnegan refused to work with us, which the blacks observing,
frequently took the axe out of our hands and offered it to him,
making signs that he should use it, and, on his continuing to
refuse, they no longer brought him food, though to us they
continued a liberal supply. He was consequently obliged to
procure fern-root, &amp;c. for himself. At the expiration of
three weeks, our canoe being complete, the natives would not
allow us to launch it, but did it themselves; and when they saw
it afloat, with Parsons and me in it, their joy and admiration
knew no bounds: they leaped, danced, and roared, following us up
and down the beach. Being now satisfied that it would answer our
purpose, we landed, and the natives rolled the canoe up again on
the beach, not allowing us to touch it. The remainder of the
evening was spent in making preparations for our departure,
Finnegan still refusing to go with us, notwithstanding our
entreaties that he would. The natives having given us a quantity
of fish, &amp;c., Parsons and I set out the next afternoon with
the flood-tide. We had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile,
when the natives, perceiving that Finnegan did not accompany us,
hastily launched a canoe, and two of them embarking, he was by
the rest forced to follow, when they paddled quickly towards us;
but we had gotten round a sand-bank that lay off some distance
from the shore. They therefore pulled to the bank and made
Finnegan land on it, where they left him, and went back to the
huts. As he was unable to swim, he would have been drowned when
the tide rose, if we had not pulled back for him, as we
immediately did. Being once more all together, we made the best
of our way for the island before-mentioned, to which the blacks
had advised us to steer, and about eleven o'clock at night we
reached it. We immediately secured the canoe, and made a good fire,
which was scarcely done when it began to rain, and continued to
pour incessantly during the night. The next morning, the rain
having cleared off, we proceeded to the opposite side of the
island with the canoe, where we procured some fern-root, with
which we pushed off for the other side of the bay. The tide being
strong, we did not reach the shore till after dark, when we found
six or seven huts and some fire. We could hear the natives, who
appeared to have just left this place, making much noise, a
little to the southward, where they were fishing, but they did
not come near us that night. The next morning we went up to a
rising ground at the back of the huts, from which we could
command a good view of the country. From this place we saw
another point far to the northward, but the distance appeared so
great, and the shore appeared to secede so far, that we were
afraid to venture across in our canoe; we therefore returned to
the huts, and having drawn up our canoe on the beach, we set out
to walk round the bay. The mangroves were so thick that we could
not long keep the shove, but followed a native path which seemed
to lead in the direction we wished to proceed in. On the third
day we arrived on the bank of a huge river, at a place where it
was evident the natives use to cross over; but it was too wide
for us to attempt to swim, and we could not find a canoe; we
therefore resolved to go up the river until we should find some
means of crossing it. Accordingly we travelled on for nearly a
month, being very much impeded by the number of salt creeks,
which we were obliged to walk round, as neither of my companions
were able to swim sufficiently well to attempt crossing them. At
last we readied the bank of a creek, on the opposite side of
which we saw two canoes; one of these I was resolved to procure.
I accordingly swam across, but I found myself so weak (as we had
now lived for a month on fern-root), that it was with great
difficulty I reached the other side. I loosed the canoe, and
brought it back to my companions. It was, however, so small that
it would not carry more than two of us at a time. I therefore
took Parsons over the main river first, and then returned for
Finnegan; but we found the brush so thick and the country so
rough, that it was impossible for us, naked and shoeless as we
were, to travel it. I was therefore obliged to take them back in
the same manner, to the plape we had left. We then commenced our
return the way we had come; but we had not in returning any thing
like the difficulty which we experienced in coming up, since,
whenever we came to a river or creek, instead of travelling seven
or eight days in order to get round it, we were enabled to cross
it in the canoe. We thus continued for two or three days, Parsons
and Finnegan walking, and I paddling down in the canoe, till on
the opposite side of the river we found another canoe; and being
all now able to float down the river, we agreed to rest where we
wore a few days, in order to lay in a stock of fern-root. While
thus employed, we fell in with a party of blacks, who were going
to fish with their nets, and on our asking them they gate us a
good meal of fish; but the next day they seemed anxious that we
should leave them; and upon our not doing so, as readily as they
wished, they made an attempt to seize our canoes. We were
fortunate enough, however to get them out of their reach, and
proceeded on our journey. In two days afterwards we reached the
mouth of the river, where, on a sand-bank at the entrance, I was
so lucky at to kill five large sting-rays, which afforded us some
good meals. The river, as high up as we reached, was brackish,
and a very strong tide ran in it: it was above a quarter of a
mile wide where we turned back. We now left the smaller canoe,
and my companions walked along the beach, while I, in the other
canoe, pulled along the shore. In this manner we continued our
course to the northward for three days, and on the evening of the
third day reached the point which had been originally pointed out
to us by the blacks on the island, where our boat was lost. This
was the 101st day after we left Sydney, Parsons and I having kept
a strict account thus far; but from this time forward we totally
lost our reckoning. I had brought Parsons across the last bay in
the canoe, and had promised to go back immediately for Finnegan;
but he, having walked a little distance further along the shore,
found a canoe, in which were twenty or thirty large fish. This he
immediately seized, and we had scarcely landed, when we perceived
him paddling towards us. On his approach, he called out to us to
make a good fire, as he had plenty of fish; upon which we ran
down to the shore, and as soon as he boded, having hauled up the
canoe, we canoed the fish to some empty huts which we found hard
by. In the mean time, the natives who owned the canoe began to
call out, and at length followed Finnegan across in another canoe
to the number of about ten. By this time several of the natives
of the side on which we were, being alarmed by the noise, had
joined them, and they all proceeded towards the huts. We had now
for several weeks lived almost entirely on dingowa, which being
but a poor kind of food, together with the fatigue of travelling
so far under a burning sun without clothes, had weakened and
emaciated us very much, and we resolved to run every risk sooner
than lose the fish we had thus obtained: we therefore placed them
under some bark, and I took my axe and Finnegan a stick, being
determined not to lose them without a struggle. However, when the
natives approached, they seemed at once struck with our miserable
condition; and instead of attempting to repossess themselves of
the fish, some who had their nets with them instantly set to work
to procure more for us; and one or two fetched us as much
<i>dingowa</i> as they could carry. The next night they took us
to their huts, where they entertained us in the same hospitable
manner as the blacks, with whom we had before lived, had
done.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">(<i>Continued by John Finnegan, Pamphlet being
sick.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p>We had resided with these blacks about four or five days, when
Pamphlet, having gone out fishing with them one day, came back
and said it was useless to remain there any longer, as he had
seen the head of Jervis's Bay at a distance of about fifteen
miles, and, therefore, proposed to go to it the next day. To this
Parsons agreed; but as I had every reason to fear violence from
Parsons, who had once or twice attempted to kill me, I resolved
to remain where I was for the present, till I had fairly gotten
rid of him, and then to attempt to travel by myself. They
accordingly set out the next morning, and I remained behind, with
the chief of the tribe, who had been very kind to me ever since
our arrival here. However, the next evening Parsons and Pamphlet,
being unable to procure food, returned to the huts. Here we all
remained for about a month; during which time we were distributed
in different huts among the natives, the old chief always keeping
me with him, whale every one of the tribe contributed to our
support, one bringing fish, another <i>dingowa</i>, and so on; so
that we were as comfortable as we could expect to be in our
situation. At the end of a month we again grew anxious to get
home, if possible, and accordingly resolved to make one more
effort. Having collected a great quantity of fish and
<i>dingowa</i>, we set out one afternoon, and pursued our course
northward along the beach for about ten miles: here we intended
to pass the night; but just as we had made our fire, four of the
blacks, with whom we had been living, came up with us, and used
every entreaty to make us return with them. However, we imagined
that they only followed us in consequence of our having promised
them the axe and some other things, which we had not given them;
and that in all probability more of their tribe would arrive
before morning; we therefore drove them away, and proceeded about
a mile further, and there rested for the night. We resumed our
journey very early next morning, and in the course of the day
were overtaken by a black man and woman belonging to the tribe we
had left. These people also tried to prevail on us to return, but
without success; and after accompanying us about a mile, they
strode into the bush and left us. Towards evening we came to a
river, which appeared too considerable for us to attempt to
cross; we therefore rested on the bank that night, and next
morning went up it about a mile. Here we found a canoe, and
brought it down to the place where we had slept, and in the
afternoon at low-water we crossed the river in it, and rested on
the other bank that night. The next morning we proceeded on our
journey, and in the course of the day fell in with another
smaller river, on the bank of which were a number of huts. Here
we found an old black man, who was unable to move, both his legs
and arms having been broken at some distant period, and never
having been set. There were also three women, with some children,
all eating fish, with which, on our arrival, they instantly
supplied us. Here we stopped for three days, when, having
observed a woman crossing the river at low-water by walking, we
did the same, and again proceeded on our journey. The same day we
fell in with another river, up the bank of which we walked two
days, and on the second evening met some natives, among whom we
were surprised to see a man belonging to the tribe with whom we
had tarried so long: he was one of the four who had followed us
the day we left them. This man, when we first arrived among his
tribes was laid up with a spear-wound in the knee, and was cured
by Pamphlet, by extracting part of the spear that had broken in
the wound. He had in consequence become much attached to
Pamphlet, and now again urgently entreated him to return with
him. To this Pamphlet, whose feet had become extremely sore, at
last consented. His friend was then on his way to a great meeting
of natives, where he was to fight the man who had wounded him.
Accordingly the next morning, Pamphlet and he set out together
for the fight, while Parsons and I pursued our journey. The next
day we crossed the river, and continued travelling for two days
longer, when, arriving at the bank of another river, a quarrel
arose between Parsons and me, on which he opened his knife and
swore he would murder me. I then ran into the bush, and he
followed me: however, I succeeded in getting away from him, and
travelled till evening with great expedition up the bank of the
river. At night-fall I met a party of blacks crossing the river
in three canoes, and endeavoured by signs to make them understand
that I wished to cross too. This they would not allow, but made
me turn bade with a fishing black and his wife, who, after four
days, brought me to the place from whence I had at first set out.
Here I found Pamphlet, and was again received by the old chief
with the greatest kindness, he seeming quite delighted with my
return.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>Resumed by Pamphlet</i>.)</p>
<p>The day following Finnegan's return, the old chief being about
to go with several of his tribe to a fight at some distance, took
Finnegan along with him. He was very anxious for me also to
accompany him, but on my making signs to him that my feet were
still very sore, he permitted me to remain behind without farther
solicitation. I now daily accompanied the men of the tribe on
their fishing excursions, and was always supplied by them in the
most liberal manner. They would not even follow me to roast the
fish, or pound the dingowa, which they gave me, but always
brought them ready dressed. One day, however, the old man in
whose hut I lived having caught several large fish, did not give
me any, as was usual with him; and on my asking for some, he
refused me rather gruffly. Upon this, fancying they might be
getting tired of me, I resolved to leave them, and accordingly,
taking my axe, I set out at once, in order to attempt, if
possible, to rejoin Parsons. I had not, however, gone far, when I
was followed by four of the young men, who made use of every
persuasion in their power to entice me back, to which I at last
consented, the more readily as each of them brought two spears,
and I was not quite certain what use they would have put them to,
had I persisted in my refusal. After this I lived with them in
the same manner as before, expecting Finnegan's return every day;
but having now lost our reckoning for some time, I cannot form
any idea how long I remained, or what time Finnegan was away. At
last, one evening, as I was sitting by the fire and the blacks
were roasting fish for me, I heard some natives shouting on the
beach and calling me; upon which I rose and walked slowly towards
them; but what was my astonishment and delight, when I saw a
cutter under full sail standing up the bay, about three miles
from where we stood! I instantly made towards her with all the
speed I could, followed by a number of the natives; but before I
had run half the distance, she came to an anchor within half a
quarter of a mile of the shore. On coming abreast the vessel I
hailed her, and was immediately answered; and shortly afterwards
a boat pushed off from her, from which landed Mr. Oxley the
Surveyor-General, Lieutenant Stirling of the Buffs, and the
recorder of this narrative. I now learned, to my great surprise,
that I was at least five hundred miles to the northward of Port
Jackson, instead of being, as we always imagined, to the
southward of Jervis's Bay. I was taken on board the vessel that
evening, where, after I was cleaned, I was decently clothed and
humanely treated; but my head and heart were so much affected by
this unexpected turn of fortune, that I was unable to answer any
questions that were put to me that night. The next morning,
however, I became more collected; and in the course of the day my
satisfaction was greatly increased by the return of Finnegan, who
experienced the same kind treatment that I had previously done. I
now found that upwards of eight months had elapsed since I left
Sydney; consequently, I had spent nearly five of them with these
hospitable natives of Moreton Bay. Their behaviour to me and my
companions had been so invariably kind and generous, that,
notwithstanding the delight I felt at the idea of once more
returning to my home, I did not leave them without sincere
regret.</p>
<p>Mr. Oxley and Mr. Stirling set out the following morning,
taking Finnegan with them, in order to examine the river which we
had been so long in attempting to cross; and on their return, in
five or six days, the Mermaid cutter got under way, and we all
set sail for Sydney.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">On</span> Monday the 31st March, 1823, I set
out with my people for the settlement of Bathurst. In the
afternoon we crossed the Nepean River, and encamped at the foot
of the Blue Mountains, about two miles beyond the settlement of
Emu.</p>
<p>At daybreak of the 1st April we resumed our journey over the
mountains. Upon reaching Springwood, about noon, we rested our
horses awhile, and then continued onward until sunset, when,
having travelled twenty-four miles, we halted, and pitched our
tents at a swamp, which afforded us abundance of tolerable water,
although the supply of grass or herbage for our horses was
exceedingly small. The thermometer had a considerable range in
the course of the day. At six A.M. the mercury stood at 66°, at
eleven at 83°, from which it fell at seven P.M. to 68°. Much rain
fell in the course of the night.</p>
<p>The morning of the 2d, however, although a little cloudy, had
every appearance of a fair day. The thermometer, at seven A.M.,
when we continued our journey, showed 70°, rising to 75° at three
P.M., when we reached Blackheath, another day's stage. A
southerly wind, that had been blowing fresh all the day, at
length brought up some heavy black clouds, which, in passing to
the N.W., drenched us with ruin, ere we could pitch our tents. At
night again, heavy rain, with thunder and lightning, set in for
the night, continuing with alarming fury until daybreak of the
3d, when the storm partially subsided, leaving me, however,
undetermined to advance, since frequent showers were filling, and
a thick mist covered the whole of the mountains in the vicinity.
About eight A.M. the thermometer stood at 59°, and the clouds
breaking to the westward, I was induced to make an effort to
reach Cox's River in the course of the day. The air was
exceedingly moist and raw, and every way disagreeable for
travelling. We descended the pass without accident, and arrived
at Cox's River early in the afternoon, when I again rested my
horses for this day, having in view a fatiguing stage to-morrow,
that would occupy the whole of that day. The thermometer was
stationary at 60° throughout the afternoon, falling 2° at eight
P.M.</p>
<p>4th. The morning was exceedingly cloudy, and much rain fell in
the hilly range before as to the Fish River, which we crossed at
two P.M.; and upon advancing four males beyond it, to Emu Valley,
we encamped for the flight, when rain again set in, with a fresh
S.E. breeze.</p>
<p>Saturday, 5th. Raw, moist atmosphere; wind at S.E.; the
thermometer, at seven P.M., was 59°. Having despatched my cart
and pack-horses on their last stage to Bathurst, I rode forward,
in order to reach that settlement early in the forenoon, to
secure a ration of fresh beef from His Majesty's store for myself
and people, who did not arrive at the plains until sunset.</p>
<p>6th to the 14th. The weather has been between these periods
extremely unsettled and variable.</p>
<p>On Monday the 14th, I superintended the packing of my
provisions, reducing my heavy luggage to pack-horse carriage, and
issuing to each of my five men a complete suit of warm winter
clothing.</p>

Plains.</span><br>

<p>Tuesday, 15th. Morning very foggy, with every indication of a
warm day. Took my departure, from Bathurst with five heavy laden
pack-horses and five men, with provisions for ten weeks,
purposing to explore the country north from the Cugeegong River,
as far as the extensive clear tracts of level land called
Liverpool Plains. The vegetation of the line of country to the
Cugeegong River (whose left bank we reached in the afternoon of
the 18th) assumed a very different appearance from that which I
observed in November 1 last. Few plants were in flower; but the
late trains had caused a great exuberance in those species, that
clothe the lower lands and are generally valuable to the grazier.
Having crossed the Cugeegong at my old ford, I pitched the tents
on a flat, upon its right bank, which, from the near approach of
the hills to the river, afforded me greater security for my
horses. Weather clouded, with a thunder squall to the westward in
the afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday, 19th. A very fine morning. Since it is very probable
that I may, in my return from my proposed long tour, penetrate
through the broken mountainous country to the eastward of my
present encampment, whence the Cugeegong derives its origin, I
have determined to trace the river upwards to a small cleared
flat, void of timber, named the Plain of Daby, in order to make
such observations upon the country as will be useful to the
colonial government, and enable me fully to recognize certain
leading features of it, should I be obliged to return southerly
through it to Bathurst, at the close of this journey. I
accordingly retarded the Cugeegong, directing my people to
proceed forward with the horses up its left bank. Steep, abrupt
hills, inclining sharply to the water, soon, however, obliged me
to quit the river altogether in search of a better and more
moderately rising country for my heavily laden beasts. At length,
after pursuing a route varying S.S.E. and E. for four hours, I
found it only possible to proceed forwards by climbing a main
range, from which I found all the minor rocky hills diverged.
About four P.M. a favourable and easy descent induced me to quit
the range, when I soon entered the valley discovered last year,
crossed the pretty swamp-oak creek that runs through it, and in
an hour I got among my old marked trees, leading me to the
junction of the creek and the Cugeegong River, as well as to the
spot where I had forded the latter last December. As the day wea
dosing in upon me, and my horses were much fatigued, I halted on
a flat near the river for the night, sending three of my people
up, the stream, in search of a safe shoal, to lead the
pack-horses over, to the north or right bank. The night,
throughout was very chilly, although my thermometer continued
stationary at 46°.</p>
<p>Monday, 21st. Morning foggy. Thermometer, at seven A.M. 46°.
Resuming our journey easterly, we pursued our route as near the
bank of the river as the rocky hills, clothed with an
uninteresting brush-wood and callitria pyrimidalis, would allow
us, occasionally passing through some grassy valleys, thinly
clothed with, a stunted timber of the few ordinary kinds of
eucalyptus. The Cugeegong, in these stages of our ascent,
presents some pretty, basins of deep stagnant water, from which
it occasionally dwindles to a small glassy creek, whose channel
is wholly choked up with reeds (arundo phragmites) and typha
minor. Grossing at one of these narrows, our course was E.N.E.
over a fine grassy country, occasionally seeing the river
meandering below us; when, having effected twelve miles, and rain
again foiling, we were induced to encamp on a fine reach of the
Cugeegong, about four miles west of the plain of Daby. In this
day's stage I observed no signs of inhabitants, and no animals of
any description. Granite is frequent on the hills and in the bed
of the river; limestone being also abundant on the higher lands,
as well as on the immediate banks of this stream.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 22d. Heavy rain continued throughout the fore part of
the day, obliging us to remain within our tents. In the
afternoon, I sent two men to the eastward, to a swamp observed
from a ridge in the route of yesterday, and suspected to be the
flat named by the natives <i>Daby</i>. In the evening they
returned, reporting that they had crossed the plain, or flat,
which was about three miles and a half distant from our tents,
and that on the western edge of it an extensive grazier, residing
at Bathurst, had recently erected a hut and stock-yard. The wind
continued fresh from the east, with exceedingly clouded weather.
Thermometer, at eight A.M., 52°, and at four P.M. 55°.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 23d. Much wind during the night, and cloudy weather
continued this morning. At eight A.M. we proceeded E.N.E. through
a timbered grassy country about four miles, when we entered the
open bare lands of Daby, through which the Cugeegong winds from
the eastern broken country, being joined on the western side of
the plain by a creek of running water, proceeding from the
northern rocky semicircle of hills. The Cugeegong here preserves
an uniform width of twelve yards, the banks being low, muddy, and
abounding in reeds; end thus it divides the heart of the flat
lands of Daby from east to N.W. Daby, of whose fine pasturage
much has been said at Bathurst, may be described as a tract of
several miles in length, from S.E. to N.W., well covered with an
abundance of grazing herbage, thinly wooded, having patches
perfectly bare of tree or shrub, and of an exceedingly rich,
black, moist, loamy soil, adapted to all the purposes of
agriculture. Amidst these line patches of land there are portions
somewhat elevated above the ordinary level of the flats, which
are composed wholly of a loose deep sand, and productive (in
conformity with the general character of the continent) of
several curious and interesting plants. A double hill, bearing
east from my tent, induced me, by its rocky aspect and elevated
appearance, to ascend it, as well to examine its botanical
productions, as to take a few cross bearings of the principal
points of this irregular country. Several small kangaroos were
skipping around the rocks, of which the higher parts of the hill
are formed: they were, however, too active to allow us to shoot
them, instantly retreating into the deep recesses of the
summits.</p>
<p>24th. My horses had been so negligently shod at Bathurst, that
the shoes of two were falling off already; and I was obliged to
despatch a man back to the settlement for a supply of spare shoes
and nails.</p>
<p>The man having returned to me on the afternoon of the 26th,
the shoes of all my houses were secured, and some repairs to
their pack-saddles being effected, I determined to proceed
northerly on Monday, 28th. The exceedingly broken sub-mountainous
structure of the country at N.E., N. and N.N.W., obliged me to
commence my route from the plain of Daby, on the Cugeegong,
considerably to the west of north, in part over a rising open
forest land, tolerably well watered, lightly timbered, and
occasionally interspersed with confined brushes. Availing myself
of the country's at length allowing me to travel north, I
descended to a grassy valley, bounded by rocky hills of moderate
ascent, which I traced, as it declined at north by west along the
margin of a swamp; when, having effected ten miles, we halted in
a vale beneath a part of the boundary hills, which was studded
with limestone of an excellent quality.</p>
<p>29th. Throughout the following seven miles the country is a
succession of wet valleys and dividing ridges; the former
declining westerly towards the Cugeegong, into which it was
evident that the waters that had collected and formed in each a
swamp, drained the land at due north, and more especially to the
east of that point, continuing broken and very irregular. The
timber was the same as that of the river, with occasionally a few
iron-bark trees, on the brushy descents from the hills. The
general disposition of the leading ridges, at nearly right
angles, with a direct north course; rendered the succeeding ten
miles of the journey rather fatiguing, especially as the ascents
to the summits of the intersected ranges were exceedingly steep,
rocky, and otherwise difficult; and the interjacent narrow
valleys continuing to dip westerly, showed us that their only
point of easy access is from the bank of the river. An extent of
apple-tree (angophora lanceolata) flats at length succeeds, with
little or no interruption during four miles, to the base of a
ridge of hills lying east and west; and although this part of the
country abounds in kangaroos of large size, it appeared wholly
unfrequented fay natives, no traces whatever (such as had been
every where obvious on the trees in our previous route) being
observed in the whole extent. This circumstance may, however, be
reasonably attributed to the absence of water, none being found
by our expedition until we had reached the foot of some rising
grounds, bounding these flat lands to the north. The timbers are
of apple-tree, iron-bark, stringy-bark, and box of ordinary size.
The rocks were chiefly of a decomposing sandstone, with a
pudding-stone studded with pebbles of quartz and jasper. A few
detached blocks of: granite were also observed in a swampy
vale.</p>
<p>30th. Upon leaving our encamping ground under a hill named
Mount Burchell, and passing through a boggy tea-tree (melaleuca
linariifolia) swamp, at the immediate base of the above-mentioned
boundary hills, whose waters it receives; and upon penetrating
thence about a mile through a body of honeysuckle (banksia
integrifolia) brush, our route was effectually stopped by the
broken precipitous aspect of the country. Perpendicular ridges,
faced with rode, overhanging ravines of considerable depth,
occupied a range of the compass from north to E.S.E. By dint of
much labour we attained the summit of a grassy range at N.N.W.;
and I hence beheld not only the frightful irregularity of the
country easterly, to whose verge we had approached, but had a
bird's-eye view of a very promising land, extending forty-five or
fifty miles before us, to the base of a range of mountains lying
east and west, and which bounded my view to the north; the
intermediate country, although billy, appearing very practicable.
Having taken a set of important bearings of points above the
horizontal summit of this extensive range, which I considered
might possibly constitute the grand southern boundary of
Liverpool Plains,* we descended to a rich grassy valley winding
to the N.W.; and having traced it about four miles, creased a
fine erode running to the westward, and forming the boundary
limit, north of the extensive vale, which it abundantly and
permanently waters.</p>
<p class="foot">[* An inference drawn from the observations of a
Mr. Scott who (with Lieutenant Lawson) in searching for Liverpool
Plains last year, having penetrated to the base of a lofty
impassable range of mountains, returned, considering that he had
passed either to the east or to the west of those extensive
cleared tracts of country.]</p>
<p>May 1st Onward northerly, about three miles, once the ranges
of hills, which were generally disposed N.N.W. and S.S.E., would
not allow us to pursue a course better than N.N.W., we travelled
over a continuation of low grassy hills and vales, thinly
timbered with the usual species of eucalyptus; when upon
penetrating through a narrow patch of iron-bark brush, the
country at once became open, the soil rich and loamy, the general
surface nearly level and but slightly wooded, enabling us to
advance due north about five miles, with no other interruption
than that of passing a large muddy watercourse descending
westerly, which, although nearly dry and choked with reeds at
this season, is evidently a considerable rivulet in the rains, as
we gathered from the wreck of wood and stubble upon its banks.
Another mile, north by east, brought us to the base of a rocky
sterile range of bare hills, which appeared to extend themselves
far to the eastward, whence another creek of like form and
importance with that we had passed rose, receiving, as it
advanced westerly, the drained waters of the broken rocky ridge
at whose foot it ran. Although the country to the westward, in
continuation of the thinly wooded forest land over which we had
travelled, appeared perfectly open, moderately timbered, and
every way adapted to travelling, as far as I could observe from
the higher rocks of the bold range, its northern boundary, yet
having already made more westing in my northerly course, in
consequence of the general disposition of its main ridges, than I
had originally intended, I penetrated through an uninteresting
brush-wood of the irregularly-surfaced rocky ridge, and then
proceeded N.N.E. about two miles over a diversified tract, in
part a sterile siliceous scrub, connected with the ridge, and in
part a patch of thinly wooded grassy flat, indifferently watered,
and named by the aborigines Nandoura, which again immediately
becomes invested with considerable sandy brushes of
honeysuckle.</p>
<p>2d. From the small flat of Nandoura, an uniformly bad country
extends nine miles, the greater portion of which consists of a
level forest, intersected by deep, muddy, reedy creeks and
stagnant holes of water, clothed with a small useless timber of
box and blue gum; the soil being for the most part a stiff
tenacious day, producing a wiry grass, interspersed with tufts of
rushy and harsh plants of cypeaceæ, decidedly indicative of a
permanently wet tract of country, from whose nearly level surface
the rains are but partially drained.</p>
<p>3d. Low stony ridges, covered with a very dense, lofty brush
of underwood, and heavily timbered with tapering iron-bark,
occasionally intersected our route.</p>
<p>4th. And as the country at length obviously declined to the
N.E. and east, in the direction of some prominent points in the
belt of mountains before us (of which bearings had been taken in
the earlier stages of our journey), we fully hoped we were fast
approaching the verge of a more open and improved tract of land,
although at a lower level than the miserable desolate country
through which we were penetrating.</p>
<p>6th. Pursuing a steady course N.E., we, in two miles, passed
the confine of these uninteresting, unprofitable washes; and upon
reaching the brow of the ridge of forest hills, we at once
descended to a fine tract of good country, watered by a stream,
whose winding channel could be easily traced by the particularly
dark verdure of the swamp-oak (casuarina paludosa) on its banks,
several miles in a N.E. direction. This small river (which I
since learnt is the Goulburn of Lieutenant Lawson, whose marked
trees we have repeatedly intersected in our route from the
Cugeegong) presented to us at this period a stream thirty-six
feet wide, flowing to the S.S.E. and S.E., within an ample outer
reedy channel of fifty yards in breadth, which should seem to be
filled in some seasons of heavy rains, wherein its waters are
swollen to a perpendicular height of twelve feet above the
present ordinary level, as appears by the lodgment of stubble in
the branches of the stupendous swamp-oaks on its margin. The
Goulburn evidently takes its rise in the south face of the
mountainous ranges, which were distant from us from ten to
fifteen miles, and which extend (as far as could be observed)
from N.W. to about E.N.E.; and the river having watered some
beautiful open grazing lands on its left bank, winds S.W. to the
rocky bases of the hilly ridges, by which we had descended to
this truly fine country, and thence it takes a decided bend to
the S.E. Its rocks are of a sand-stone, often coloured with oxyd
of iron; and although fragments of a compact whin were met within
its channel, they appear to have been rolled down from the lofty
northern ranges in the vicinity. The large cod and bream (as they
are called) of the waters falling westerly, which by reason of
their voracious nature are easily taken by the angler, have not
been observed in this river, the deep clear pools of which
abounded with a short, thick, black fish, not to be tempted by
our baits.</p>
<p>Upon taking a retrospect of my irregular route (exceeding
eighty miles) from the Cugeegong River to this stream, I would
observe that, although portions in my latter stages are barren
and unimprovable, the interjacent valleys, in the hilly part of
my tour, afford excellent cattle pasturage, and will probably ere
long be every way worthy of the consideration of the grazier,
their respective points of entrance being evidently from the
banks of the Cugeegong, or country in a north line from
Mudgee.</p>
<p>Goulburn River is distant, by the most practicable route, 125
miles north from Bathurst, and about sixty-five or seventy miles
N.W. from the head of Paterson's River (a branch of Hunter's
River), a good meridional altitude of the sun placing the ford,
by which we passed it, exactly in the parallel of 32° south, its
presumed longitude by estimation being 149° 54'.</p>
<p>7th. Along the left bank of this interesting stream, to the
N.E., an extent of nine miles of rich grazing tracts meets the
eye, consisting of clear open levels or small plains, and grassy
hills of the most easy acclivity, which to the S.E. are bounded
by ridges of forest land, thinly clothed with timber. The level
tracts, immediately bounded by the river, occasionally break into
small plains, whose areas comprise from 100 to 150 acres, clear
of tree or shrub, and with the downs, or open gently rising
grounds, furnish all the grasses and herbage of the Cugeegong and
other western rivers, with the addition of a tall luxuriant
species of danthonia, or kind of oat-grass, not remarked on other
streams.</p>
<p>The soil of these limited plains, or more level lands, is of a
moist alluvial nature; whilst that of the small downs, especially
near the southern extremity of this beautiful tract of country,
is rich, loamy, and dry, possessing every advantage of local
situation to call forth the diligence of the agriculturist; and
being admirably adapted to the formation of artificial meadows
for sheep, or wheat lands, as far as the boundary rocky hills to
the S.E. Viewed collectively, the lands on Goulburn River offer
an eligible situation for the establishment of a very profitable
and convenient agricultural and grazing farm, inasmuch as it will
be centrically distanced between the located pasture-lands on
Hunter's River, and our future stock stations on Liverpool
Plains. Their only possible line of communication will, by reason
of the structure of the country, be found to intersect the
Goulburn, at or about the ford by which we passed that
stream.</p>
<p>8th. Leaving Goulburn River, our course to the N.E. led us
about seven miles over a part of the hilly ridge, forming the
lateral branches of the northern belt of mountains before us,
which appeared to extend very far to the eastward; and upon
descending to a narrow, rich, grassy valley, we reached another
water, having all the characters, in point of breadth, depth,
velocity, and tendency, of the Goulburn. This small stream, which
was discovered last year by Lieutenant Lawson during his tour
with Mr. Scott, was then named the Wemyss, as a compliment to our
Deputy Commissary-General, and together with a third stream,
which I have now named Scott's Rivulet, flowing through an open,
clear apple-tree flat, about a mile east of it, rises in the
northern barrier, and pursues a course through a very
considerable level, wooded country to the S.S.E. and S.E.</p>
<p>9th. Continuing our route N.E. along the margin of Scott's
Rivulet, towards some very conspicuous points in the mountain
barrier, distant about fifteen miles (of which bearings had been
originally taken in the earlier stages of these journeys), the
country again becomes hilly, and in other respects resembles the
land to the westward of Wemyss's River. It, however, becoming
more lofty, irregular, and broken by deep narrow valleys, as I
approached within five miles of a lofty point in this barrier of
mountains, which I have named Oxley's Peak, I deemed it prudent
to halt, and having encamped, to examine the country around me
from the most commanding eminence to which I could ascend, being
fully satisfied that the distance to which I had penetrated from
Bathurst, and the course by which I had conducted my little
expedition, ought to have brought us to the verge of those large
plains, to whose vast extent Mr. Oxley has in his Journal made
special reference.</p>
<p>10th. It was with no small difficulty, and by a penetration to
the centre of this formidable barrier, in which I crossed
numerous streamlets proceeding from the many branching, steep,
walled ravines around me, whose union formed the pretty rivulet
which ran past our tents to the S.S.E., that I was enabled to
reach the summit of a mount, which I have named M'Arthur's (after
my respected friend Hannibal M'Arthur, Esq.), and which commands
a most extensive view on all sides, amply repaying me for the
fatigue experienced in attaining these pinnacles of the
barrier.</p>
<p>The country to the westward of our line of route from the
Cugeegong appeared open, level, and moderately timbered, compared
with the course I had pursued thence to Goulburn River; as did
also the lands bearing from S.E. by south, to south, through
which that stream, together with other waters which we had passed
to the east of it, flows. The view between those points extends
for a distance of between forty and forty-five miles to ranges of
hills of ordinary elevation, which border upon that extreme point
of Paterson's River, situate N.W. from the point of Howe's line
of intersection, as seen in Mr. Oxley's large chart, published by
Arrowsmith. This entire extent of southern country, on whose
ample surface small patches of plain were remarked, seemed as if
it would afford to the farmers of Hunter's River (upon passing
the hills in their own immediate vicinity) every facility of
communication with the N.W. interior by the way of Goulburn
River. To the S.E. the land is irregular and ridgy; and thence
more east to N.E., and even N.N.E., it gradually rises to a bold
and mountainous feature, the declination of the country being
uniformly south. Upon looking north and N.N.W., I was gratified
with a most extensive view of those considerable plains, which
have been in part the object of my search, whose expanse of
cleared surface we should ere this have traversed, had the
structure of the country been favourable to our northerly
advancement. The greater body of Liverpool Plains hereabouts lie
N.N.W., from which narrow lateral branches extend several miles
to the east, between some detached woody ridges, variously
disposed on the general surface. These strips stretch themselves
again south to the immediate base of the barrier ranges on which
I was stationed. A few detached mounds of conical and rounded
figures were scattered on the greater or main patches of plain,
beyond which the expanse of level country continues for a
distance which I could not justly estimate, on account of the
haze that hung over it. The rock of the more elevated parts of
this mountainous range is a compact whin, generally disposed in
horizontal strata, although, on the summit of the point whence I
had taken a set of hearings of the country around, it assumed a
basaltic form, being disposed vertically in cubical masses: the
bases are sand and pudding-stone. Although there appeared no
difficulty in passing along the winding declivities of the
northern face of the mountains to a branch of Liverpool Plains
immediately beneath me, the ascent, nevertheless, to this station
from my encampment was so exceedingly steep and precipitous, as
to render it totally impossible to lead my packhorses over them.
I therefore determined (since the moderate appearance of the
ranges east favoured my intention) to trace their south base in
that direction in search of a pass, by which not only my horses,
but the cattle and sheep of the farmer, might pass without
danger, to those extensive pastures situate on their northern
side.</p>
<p>11th to 16th. However, after pursuing an easterly course five
days, in which we effected about thirty-five miles of very severe
hilly travelling, all further advancing was totally stopped by
the mountain ranges; and their lateral wings becoming bluff and
fronted by perpendicular rocks, which formed a chain of deep
precipitous ravines from N.E. to nearly S.S.E., an outlet to the
flat southern country at south by west, and S.S.W., was the only
direction left us to pursue. Exhausting as may easily be
conceived to be a journey, whose course had uniformly met at
right angles the lofty lateral branches of this collection of
mountains, it nevertheless was not without its interest and
importance; since it determined the extent northerly of the
interjacent valleys, as well as the number, size and general
appearance of the creeks or rivulets, which water them at so high
a stage, immediately beneath the main barrier, and at only a mile
or two from their origin.</p>
<p>From Goulburn River to our most eastern point of penetration,
no fewer than nineteen large creeks, or swamp-oak rivulets, very
distinct at their respective points of rising, fall from the
southern declivities of these mountain ranges, and with a
considerable rapidity descend south and S.S.E. to the fine level
country, which, from all the points in every stage of our eastern
route, was seen at those bearings. Several of these waters
constitute at once rivulets, which in some periods of heavy rains
are swollen to a width varying from eight to twelve yards, the
evidences of which were obvious in the stubble that had lodged
itself on the branches of the swamp casuarinæ, which clothe and
shade their banks; and of these one stream, proceeding from a
point of the mountains to which several ravines converge,
exhibited all the proofs of being, in the wet season, so
considerable as not only to fill its ample channel (exceeding
ninety feet in breadth), but to inundate the fine grassy open
meadows on either bank. Heavy logs, the wrecks of successive
floods, were heaped upon one another, seven feet above the then
ordinary level, or two feet higher than the outer bank.</p>
<p>Since the whole of these streams have one common tendency
southerly, towards the extreme or western point of that trunk or
main branch of the Coal River, which had been formerly
intersected by Mr. Howe, in his journey north from Windsor,
little or no doubt can exist of their constituting its principal
sources, especially as the body of water, which the confluence of
these rivulets might be supposed to form, agrees with the
magnitude of Hunter's River at that particular stage of its
ascent. The principal valleys, which generally lie north and
south, stretch themselves, from the immediate base of the
mountain ranges, to the moderate country southerly, whence they
ace easily accessible, are copiously watered, and furnish
excellent cattle food, whilst their boundary hills afford
generally an ample range of sheep pasture.</p>
<p>Having failed in our attempts easterly, to discover any part
of moderate elevation in this extensive line of bold mountainous
land, by which I might have passed to the northward, and with a
view of returning to my encampment on Goulburn River, whence I
had determined to explore the continuation of this mountainous
barrier westerly, I descended south, purposing upon reaching the
open forest to pursue my journey west, at such a distance from
the lateral grassy ranges proceeding from the mountains, as would
enable my people and horses (both of which had been harassed in
the course thus far to the eastward) to travel with ease and
despatch.</p>
<p>19th. In about eight miles of progressive descent S.S.E.
through a fine thinly-wooded grazing forest, we intersected a
small river, formed evidently by the junction of several of the
mountain streams, and winding to the E.S.E. through a beautiful
flat tract, wooded chiefly with angophora or apple-tree. Its
outer banks were forty yards wide, although the breadth of the
stream at this season did not exceed sixteen feet, by an extreme
depth of two fathoms; but as the land in its vicinity is entirely
alluvial, and exceedingly rich, and the marks of floods were
observed eighteen feet above the surface of the water, it is
evidently swollen to a very considerable extent when heavy rains
fall upon the mountains. Upon passing this stream at a pebbly
ford, we continued our journey south about three miles, through a
level grassy country, moderately wooded with several trees of
apple and gum, and bounded to the west by a steep abrupt ridge of
hills, extending south from the barrier ranges from which we had
retreated; the country to the east, as far as S.E., still
continuing in bold, lofty, hummocky ranges. In the hope that the
steep rocky chain of hills westerly, which occasionally presented
perpendicular stony heads to the S.E. would terminate, or become
so moderate, that we might shape a direct course across the
country to Goulburn River, we travelled as near its base as the
small broken water-gulleys proceeding from it would allow.</p>
<p>20th. Journeying onward south about sixteen miles, through a
rather indifferent country, occasionally breaking to an open
grazing forest, and again becoming brushy, barren, and confined
by much underwood, we at length were enabled progressively to
advance west, by penetrating an abrupt, broken, narrow tract of
country, consisting of bold steep ridges, bluff heads, and
unconnected, irregularly-formed, stony elevations, separated from
each other by small sharp grassy valleys, through which my
pack-horses were able to travel without difficulty. Doubtless the
whole once formed a line of connexion with the lengthened range
of precipitous hills, whose base we had traced southerly
twenty-five miles, and which at this stage terminated in
perpendicular rocky crags of sand-stone, in a rapid state of
decomposition. From some points of the rising grounds in the
latter part of our route to this broken tract, I observed the
considerable expanse of open moderately-timbered country, which
we were leaving to the east and S.E., to be bounded in the far
distance by low forest hills, and seemingly to afford every
facility to a penetration to the coast line.</p>
<p>21st. Quitting these narrow passes, we traced a fine rich
valley about three miles in a north-westerly direction, when we
readied the bank of another river, flowing gently to the
southward between the hills that bounded the fertile flat on
which we had encamped. It is evidently formed of a union of
several of the mountain rivulets, and although its stream did not
exceed twenty feet in breadth, by the depth of one fathom, I
could not but be forcibly struck with the obvious proofs of the
immense floods that at certain periods descend from the northern
ranges, and overflow the high outer banks, which are at least
eighty yards apart. Heavy logs, the wreck of successive freshes,
were heaped upon each other on the secondary banks of this river,
whilst the stems of several sturdy swamp casuarinæ inclined so as
to form an angle of about 45° with the bed of the river; and
those, that had withstood the enormous weight and pressure of
many terns of flowing water, bore on their limbs a mass of small
timber and stubble at least twenty feet above the ordinary level
of the stream. There existed no proof of these great floods
occurring periodically. If they did, they would render a country
apparently so intersected by mountain streams scarcely habitable.
On the contrary, their occurrence seems manifestly rare, from the
decayed appearance of the wreck that proves their existence at
all. Large water-worn pebbles of quartz, jasper, jade, and their
aggregate masses, were frequent in its channel, but no rocks of
any description were observed on the higher banks, which, with
the lands on either side, are of alluvial decomposition. This
fine stream has received the name of Blaxland's River; and, with
others flowing from the N.W., in all probability constitutes in
twenty miles Paterson's River.</p>
<p>22d. A series of unconnected rocky ridges of considerable
elevation, and crowned with pine, lying in no regular order, and
separated from each other by small grassy valleys, obliged me to
pursue a north course, upon quitting our encampment on this
river; and having with much labour accomplished eleven miles, by
reason of the irregularity of the country, which often opened to
fine clear grassy hills, we at length intersected a stream which,
possessing all the character of its banks, current, and general
appearance, induced me to consider it the Blaxland, ten miles
nearer to its source.</p>
<p>Upon tracing its banks upwards, I observed, in some deep
pools, that were formed at the extremity of its narrow reaches,
the same species of small fish that had previously been seen in
the Goulburn. Our attempts, however, to secure them by the hook
were here also unavailing, for on the least alarm they darted
from our sight to the darker recesses, beneath the overhanging
muddy banks. Upon resuming our journey, we pursued a course west
from Blaxland's River, through a moderately hilly tract of forest
country and intermediate valleys, grooved with pebbly
water-courses. Having advanced about five miles, several points
of the mountain belt, set at other stations to the westward, were
again fully recognized, and their bearings being again taken
determined our position, in the line of route in which we were
travelling.</p>
<p>The country at length becomes more open, less woody, of a good
loamy soil generally, and clothed with the usual grasses. The
hills also are of a very easy acclivity, bounding rich valleys,
which afford good cattle and sheep pasture. Continuing our route
west northerly, over some low hills, which at length declined to
swelling open grassy downs, we reached a large swamp-oak rivulet,
winding round the base of a ridge of hills on its western side to
the very open lower southern country.</p>
<p>26th to 28th. Upon the left bank of this fine limpid stream,
which I have named Smith's Rivulet, we were detained four days,
in consequence of the alarming sickness of one of my people; and
although my anxiety for his recovery, as also my general
attention to him, in order to effect that recovery, did not
permit me to proceed far from our encampment, to examine the
country around, I nevertheless ascended a lofty ridge bearing
about west from our tents, and took a set of valuable bearings to
all the leading points on the northern ranges, having a tolerable
view of the country around me. From S.S.W., by way of south, to
S.S.E. the land appears (with the exception of a few low wooded
ridges) perfectly level, for an estimated distance of thirty-five
or forty miles, to the base of a long-backed range lying east and
west, and being evidently connected with the broken mountainous
land in the vicinity of Daby, upon the Cugeegong River. The open
downs, or grassy easy declivities, which extend along the east
bank of Smith's Rivulet, are traced, round the bases of the hills
whereon I was stationed, to the level southern country, where
they are circumscribed by the land becoming wooded; and beyond
this, on the general level, are observed two small plains, lying
relatively north and south, each appearing about a mile in
diameter.</p>
<p>The mean of four meridional altitudes of the sun placed the
situation of our encampment on Smith's Rivulet in 32° 2' 6" south
latitude, the presumed longitude being about 150° 24' east.</p>
<p>29th. Resuming our journey to the westward, we passed along
the foot of some forest hills to a wide thinly-wooded valley,
extending several miles N.W. and north, towards the base of the
mountains, from which a large stream, similar to Smith's Rivulet,
descended, meandering through the bosom of the very pretty vales,
along which we travelled upwards of two miles. A hilly irregular
tract of forest country succeeds about five miles, whose higher
ridges are rocky, and occasionally covered with a brush of
plants, uninteresting even to the botanical traveller.</p>
<p>Upon passing these, however, we gradually descended to a level
open tract, not so permanently watered, or productive of such
tolerable timber, as the country through which we had passed of
late; and upon pursuing an uninterrupted route west about six
miles (part of which was over clear grassy downs lying N.E. and
S.W.) we at length crossed Scott's Rivulet, and in another mile
N.W. passed Wemyss's River at the very spot where we had three
weeks before forded it</p>
<p>30th. In order to avoid the more difficult lofty ridges in our
former route from Goulburn River, we commenced our journey from
our encampment on this stream, two points to the south of west,
and having travelled about eight miles of generally a hilly
irregular country, we intersected our old marked trees, near the
open flats of Goulburn River, by which we returned to our
original position on that stream, after an absence of twenty-four
days, in which period I had ascertained the nature and
importance, to the grazier, of the country a degree to the east
and north from the base of an impervious belt of mountains,
towards the western extremity (at present known) of Paterson's
River, in a south direction; as also, the number and magnitude of
the several streams that (rising in the south face of those
barren ranges) descend and flow through a declining southern
tract of country, and which, from their tendency, are (on
reasonable grounds) presumed to constitute the principal sources
of the trunk or main branch of the Coal River.</p>
<p>June 1st. Although my provisions were very considerably
reduced, on my return to our encamping ground on this river, as
were also the conditions of my people and horses, and although I
ran a risk scarcely warranted by prudence, since I could not
foresee what swollen waters might interrupt our quick return to
Bathurst; nevertheless, conformably with the plan I had digested,
upon failing in the discovery of a passage north to Liverpool
plaids in my route easterly, I reduced the weekly ration of
myself and people, determining to employ a period of seven days
in exploring, in a north-westerly direction, the continuation of
these mountains, which appeared to extend their blackened ranges
westerly for an unlimited distance.</p>
<p>2d. Having given the people and horses a day's rest, we
proceeded upon our new route to the N.W. over a rising open
forest, but observing, upon an advance of a mile, a most evident
break of the main ranges of hills at north and N.N.E., I was
induced to alter my course to that direction. A route thus
commenced I was enabled to maintain with little variation during
the succeeding eleven miles, through several narrow but rich,
well-watered valleys, and over some very moderately-rising minor
hills, without much labour to my pack-horses, all of which had
become thin and debilitated.</p>
<p>3d. The summits of the leading hilly ranges appeared very
rocky, and thinly timbered with stringy hark, box and blue gum;
whilst their acclivities, from the grafting valleys which they
bound, were well covered with a grassy herbage, constituting dry
walks for sheep. At length, an irregular series of lofty
mountainous ranges, peeping over one another northerly, as far as
the eye could see, and extending from the eastward towards the
N.W., obliged us to climb some steep hills, and pursue a western
course across some narrow valleys and lofty forest ridges, lying
north and south, at right angles with that route.</p>
<p>4th. Upon accomplishing a laborious journey, though not
exceeding seven miles, a lateral branch of the mountain range
trended to the S.W., and being faced by a very narrow deep
ravine, whose bottom I could not perceive, totally prevented our
further procedure in that direction. From the point at which we
had halted, we observed the country from east to north, and
thence to N.W., to be a vast collection of bold lofty ranges,
occasionally in series one behind the other, and again divided
and terminating in steep precipitous heads, which overhung deep
yawning glens and sharp rocky ravines. In this route westerly, we
passed the lofty ranges which separate the eastern and western
waters; for, upon descending to their intermediate valleys, we
remarked the rivulets which ran through than to incline most
decidedly to the S.S.W. and S.W., being the first streams we had
observed to have that tendency during the last four weeks.
Seeing, therefore, the country from east, by the way of north, to
almost west, was closed against us, and that there appeared no
probability of discovering, by further perseverance westerly, any
passage through this formidable barrier, I had almost determined
to quit its blackened ranges altogether. However, upon observing
some patches of open plain, bearing S.S.W. in the only direction
left us to pursue, I resolved to descend to them, and from thence
I should be able to see distinctly that tract of country, over
which I could proceed a day or two longer with tolerable ease to
my pack-horses, and which would best meet the views of my
expedition prior to my return to Bathurst, a route I should be
obliged very soon to pursue, as well on account of the condition
of my men and horses, as of the very reduced provisions which we
had to subsist upon.</p>
<p>5th. I accordingly conducted my party through a fine rich
valley, watered by a creek, issuing from the ravine, and wooded
with apple-tree, blue gum, and swamp oak, and having traced it
about seven miles, it broke into small open plains perfectly clear
of timber, which lying N.N.E. and S.S.W. appeared to extend
between some rising grounds three or four miles. The steep range
of forest hills that limited the valley on its western side, upon
extending to this strip of plain, which I have named Duguid's,
becoming exceedingly low and moderate, induced me to advance to
the westward over it, through an open grazing forest, which soon
brought me within sight of another heavy; bold, lateral range,
constituting the boundary of a valley, much more ample at its
entrance from the forest, and more promising, in its trending, to
the object of my research, than any recess towards this belt of
mountains that we had yet explored. The aggregate body of these
mountainous ranges evidently inclined to the N.W., and their
respective principal branches descended generally S.S.W. parallel
to each other, forming valleys more or less spacious, through
which the waters rising in the southern declivity of this belt
escape to the interior, bearing S.W. and W.S.W. from us.</p>
<p>The difficulties with which we had to contend in every stage
of our journey, more especially during our near approaches to
these mountains, considered with the observations I have of late
made on the arrangement of their main or aggregate, body, and its
respective parts, fully convinced me that the only practicable
mode of continuing their examination, with a view towards
discovering, a passage through them to the northward, would he by
travelling on the broad base, formed generally in the lower
country at the southern extremities of their lateral branches,
exploring at each stage those large valleys that open upon it,
and which, by their general tendency, might afford the hope of
ultimate success. Thus impressed, and deeming the valley south of
us well worthy our examination, I continued our journey to it
over a fertile flat of apple-tree, the soil partly of a loose,
rich, vegetable decomposition, and partly of a still alluvial
nature, particularly along the margin of a fine brook, which ran
through the vale from the N.E. Upon an inclining plane, we were
enabled without difficulty to trace this valley to the N.N.E.
about eight miles; when finding it became very contracted and
sharp, by reason of a converging disposition of its boundary and
other minor ranges, I was induced to halt and ascend a high point
of the western range above us, being folly satisfied, from the
northing we had made since we left Goulburn River, that we could
not be many miles distant from the southern limit of Liverpool
Plains. To my utmost gratification, upon tracing the line of
mountain ranges, which continued very far to the N.W., a very
considerable depression in the bade of the main ridge, distant
about three miles, afforded me a clear, although limited, view of
a part of the open plains north of this extensive barrier; on
which I immediately recognized and identified several detached
round mounts, that had been previously seen from the summit of a
lofty pinnacle (Mount M'Arthur) situate in these mountains to the
eastward of us.</p>
<p>6th. Having again taken their bearings, as also those of
several points around me, I descended to my people, and lost no
time in shifting my encampment to an open valley immediately at
the base of the mountains, and within two or three mites of this
apparently practicable passage to the northern country.</p>
<p>7th. Upon proceeding to examine it, I found that, from the
level of the valley, the ascent through a close, lightly-timbered
forest was exceedingly gentle and gradual to the highest part of
the gap or pass, which was distant from our encampment about two
miles; and the declivity on the northern side of the ridge,
although less moderate (its face being grooved by small
water-gulleys) was nevertheless found practicable, and not to
exceed a mile to the open wooded country at its base. This was
observed to be timbered with large and stately box, and watered
by a rivulet, which meandered through the forest northerly,
forming in its progress the western boundary of a considerable
extent of plain, about eight or nine miles north from the highest
part of the pass, which on either side is overhung by bold, lofty
heads of the mountain range. Having directed a line of trees to
be marked from our encampment through the passage to the verge of
the nearest plain, I climbed to the summit of the eminence on the
east side of the pass, and thence had a most beautiful and
extensive view of the country before me. From the northern base
of these mountains, a level, open forest land extending from
W.N.W. to north, to the foot of a long-backed range lying east
and west, and distant sixteen or twenty miles; its ridge towards
the western extremity being exceedingly hummocky and irregularly
pointed.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of this woody country is distinctly
traced, by the line of swamp-oaks on its banks, the small rivulet
which rises in these mountains and runs direct north, its line of
course forming, with the forest, the western verge of the nearest
or most southern extensive patch of clear plain, whose visible
extent easterly from my station was limited to the N.N.E. by
detached, steep ridges of hills, between which, however, on their
northern sides, these cleared levels evidently stretch
themselves, and communicate with several patches perceived under
some rising grounds as far to the eastward as N.E. This southern
plain, whose breadth to a slight boundary line of apple-trees on
its northern side is estimated at ten miles, presents a
considerable expanse of brown grass and herbage; and, excepting a
small clump and a few scattered trees on its south-western angle,
is perfectly clear of brush or shrub. Upon extending the view
beyond it north, the plain or open level country continues very
many links, its general surface being sparingly studded with a
few detached mounts, or an occasional line of small trees,
through which a few sharp points were barely discernible on the
distant line of horizon. It was a subject of regret to me that
the exhausted state of my provisions, as also the generally
debilitated condition of my people and horses, would not permit
me to advance northerly to explore these vast levels. I was
therefore obliged to content myself with the simple discovery of
a practicable passage through a bold range of mountains to them,
but for which those unlimited, seemingly abundantly watered,
grazing levels would be entirely closed against us from the
southward.</p>
<p>8th. A good altitude of the sun at noon gave me for latitude
of my tent in the valley 31° 43' 45" south, my longitude by
estimation continuing about 149° 30' east.</p>
<p>9th. In my journey to Bathurst, from which the difference of
latitude alone gave me a distance exceeding 100 miles, I fully
purposed intersecting the Cugeegong River as near the
stock-stations of Mr. Cox or Lieutenant Lawson, as the structure
of the intermediate country would permit me, since in the event
of any failure of my provisions that might take place from
detention by swollen riven in my route, my party might procure a
sufficiency of aid from those establishments to carry them
forward to the southern settlement without distress. We therefore
proceeded on our homeward-bound route along the vale, which we
found declined to the S.W., and consisted of rich grazing flat,
watered by a swamp-oak creek, and bounded by a steep ridge of
hills on its S.E. side, the mountain-range overhanging it to the
N.W.</p>
<p>At about eight miles the vale, which had not throughout its
extent from the pass exceeded a mile and a half, at length opens
to a clear patch of plain, extending to the west along the base
of the mountainous range about two miles and a half, and skirted
over its S.E. side by a moderately-timbered forest of apple-tree,
box, and some white gum; the creek which had, in its progress
through the vale, received some small addition to its stream,
being traced immediately under the range on the west verge of the
beautiful open level tract, which I have named Harrison's
Plain.</p>
<p>Perhaps no situation, from its local advantages, is more
eligible for a general grazing establishment than Harrison's
Plain, inasmuch as it not only offers its open downs, which
comprise at least a space of cleared land exceeding 700 acres,
free from wet bottom, and therefore favourably adapted to
sheep-pasture, but it commands a very beautiful and extensive
cattle range, exceeding eight miles throughout the vale, to the
pass over the mountainous range to Liverpool Plains.</p>
<p>10th. Desirous, under our present circumstances, of pursuing
as direct a route southerly as the trending of the ridge of hills
to the eastward would allow us, we stretched across part of the
plain to the skirts of the wooded land, and thence advanced to
the south and west, about eight miles, through an uninteresting
forest, occasionally rising to low rocky ridges, covered with a
scanty underwood. At length a strip of iron-bark brushy forest
obliged me to direct out course more to the westward, when we
immediately descended to a fine open wooded flat, connected with
those fertile grazing lands which appear confined to a narrow
limit between the line of forest which we have penetrated, and
the foot of the ranges N.W. from us, which still continue to
stretch themselves very far to the westward southerly. Upon
accomplishing fourteen miles from the northern extreme of
Harrison's Plain, we again halted upon a creek, which, receding
from the foot of the western range, assumes at this stage the
character of a deep-banked, but narrow, rivulet. A level, clear
tract of land, devoid of trees, between it and the
above-mentioned range, about a mile wide, and extending north and
south three or four miles, I have named Alcock's Plain, in
compliment to another gentleman of His Majesty's Treasury, that
to the northward bearing the name of one of its secretaries.</p>
<p>11th. Upon prosecuting our journey south about a mile through
a flat forest, we reached the edge of another beautiful open
plain, where the creek, having taken a more westerly course, had
stretched itself again beneath the western ranges, which we here
observed of moderate elevation trending in the line of W.S.W.
This plain, which I have dedicated to a friend, the worthy
director of His Majesty's gardens at Kew, extends apparently six
miles to the W.S.W., is bounded on the north by the mountainous
range, and on the opposite point by a broken ridge of sand-stone
rock, covered with pine and brushwood, and so extremely abrupt as
totally to prevent me from pursuing my direct course. We were
therefore obliged to pursue a route considerably to the west of
south, stretching from one angle of the forest to another on the
skirt of the plain, whose greatest breadth, clear of timber, does
not exceed a mile. Upon quitting the verge of Aiton's Plain, we
penetrated through a barren forest of box, abounding in brushes
of the native indigo (indigofera australis) and the blue vine
(kennedia monophylla), and upon passing several low gravelly
ridges proceeding from the rocky pine-range, which continued
unbroken to the S.W., we at length reached the foot of a detached
rocky head, which I ascended to observe the appearance of the
country around:</p>
<p>The barrier of mountainous land which has extended from the
pass thirty miles to the S.W. in one uninterrupted impassable
range, continues to the west an estimated distance of forty-five
or fifty miles, and constitutes the northern boundary of a very
considerable tract of level, open, wooded country in that
direction. To the west of Aiton's Plain, and simply separated
from it by a line of apple-trees, is another of somewhat larger
dimensions, which I have named Hawkins's Plain, upon whose north
side the creek that has followed us from the northward runs,
continuing under the mountainous range to the westward. Upon
looking to the S.S.W. and S.W., the country, although broken and
ridgy, appeared very practicable for the prosecution of our
journey. Since, therefore, we had already gone farther to the
west, in consequence of the disposition of the ridges of hills,
than I had originally proposed, I rejoined my people, and
continued our journey to the S.S.W. about six miles, over a very
barren, irregular forest, interspersed with dense patches of
brush, especially on some lateral, low, rocky ridges, connected
with the pine-range still bounding us to the S.E.</p>
<p>12th. A low, heavily-timbered flat, abounding in pools of
water and bog-plants, and evidently subject to occasional
inundation, brought us, in another mile from the dry barren
grounds, to the margin of a small river, whose muddy steep bank,
clothed with tall reeds, in many places concealed the deep waters
which ran through its channel to the west.</p>
<p>Tracing its right or north bank to the eastward, about a mile
and a half, over a fine, rich, alluvial forest-land, timbered
chiefly with apple-tree and blue gum, and affording an excellent
grazing run for cattle, we at last succeeded in fording to the
opposite bank, and thence we were enabled to shape a more direct
course towards our point of destination than we had hitherto been
enabled to do. This small river, which, from its relative
position, may be presumed to be formed by an union of three
northern swamp-oak creeks, that were intersected previously to
the discovery of the pass, is about twelve yards in breadth, of
various depth, not exceeding two fathoms at the time we passed
it; but subject in seasons of heavy rains to be flooded to a
height of ten feet, when the whole of the forest-lands, from its
banks to a pine-ridge a mile distant, is laid under water. This
river is called Pubo-batta by the aborigines. I have, however,
called it Lawson's River, after the commandant of Bathurst, who
first intersected it in January, 1822, to the westward of the
point at which we had passed it.</p>
<p>Continuing our journey S.S.W. we passed through an open
forest-country, productive generally of an useless,
ordinary-sized timber, of apple-tree, box, and some blue gum, and
very indifferently watered, since in the space of five miles a
very shallow siliceous water-channel alone interrupted the dull
level sameness of the forest, in which I remarked a few detached
small pools of discoloured water.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>. A rugged bushy pine-ridge, lying east and west,
and extending in such direction as far as we could perceive
through the timber of the forest, at length interrupted our
progress southerly. However, having passed it, with some
difficulty, to a low declining valley, and finding some stagnant
pools of water resting on the stiff tenacious clay of the country
around, I encamped, as much to obtain some bearings from a rocky
head of the pine-ridge, as to give my debilitated pack-horses
(almost wholly without shoes) a little rest, although in a place
affording them very indifferent pasture. Having taken bearings of
a hummocky, lofty range of hills at S.S.E., and apparently
distant from twenty to twenty-five miles, which I satisfactorily
recognised as being situate near Mudgee, on the Cugeegong River,
we were induced to prosecute our journey with as little loss of
time as possible, especially since the louring, unsettled state
of the weather had rather impressed me with the apprehension of
being detained by the rains.</p>
<p>14th. As some heavy showers began to fall, we were able to
effect only three miles and a half, through a continuation of
uninteresting open forest, furnishing a heavier timber than the
lands we have passed, but equally destitute of living streams. A
few scattered native cypresses (callitris pyramidilis) of
blighted growth, together with occasional clumps of honeysuckle
(banksia integrifolia), tended in some degree to diversify the
too prevalent sameness of the scenery around.</p>
<p>Continuing our journey S.S.E. about three miles, we entered an
extensive iron-bark forest, the deep siliceous soil of which,
resting on a stiff clay, being rendered extremely rotten and
boggy by the showers that had fallen the preceding night, showed
us that after two or three days of heavy rain, this tract of
country would be totally impassable. However, having struggled
through its confined brushes, we readied a somewhat improving
tract of land, mote open, less timbered, and of a firmer surface,
but still very badly watered; only one creek of any importance,
filled with a stagnant-putrid water, being met with in a route of
about twelve miles and a half. This brought us to the
neighbourhood of some elevated lands, observed from the
pine-ridge I had ascended, one stage to the southward of Lawson's
River.</p>
<p>Observing some rocky hills bearing from south to S.W., we
prosecuted an irregular route easterly over some rising grounds,
and along a ridge of broken, low hills, upon which were scattered
large blocks of granite, whose decompositions being washed into
the narrow intermediate valleys, formed a base, over which our
horses travelled with confident firmness. Having effected about
ten miles, we descended a ridge S.E. to a very wet valley, when,
to our surprise, we crossed several recently trodden
cattle-paths, which, as they led over some rocky hills to the
east, I did not deem it prudent to follow. Their discovery,
however, satisfactorily proved to me our near approach to the
Cugeegong River.</p>
<p>We therefore continued a S.E. course, but had scarcely
proceeded a mile, before I had to regret leaving the higher
grounds for the valley, although the former were broken and
rocky, and consequently injurious to the ill-protected feet of my
pack-horses. The rains which had recently fallen had so
super-saturated the deep soil, that my horses were sinking in
above the knee in these boggy grounds, thus rendered by the
partial rains as soft as a quick-sand. At length we managed to
struggle about two miles to a broad but shoaly creek, evidently
the channel by which these wet lands are drained into the
Cugeegong; and upon crossing its stream, which flowed to the
westward, we halted, both man and horse being fairly worn out
with the excessive fatigues of the day.</p>
<p>15th. Calculating that a course south, about four or five
miles, would bring us to the river, we quitted our fires on the
creek at an early hour; but had not proceeded a quarter of a mile
over the open forest, before our hones fell under their small
loads in the boggy soil, obliging us to return to the firmer
grounds on the creek. Most unexpectedly, as we were tracing it
westerly, we overtook a stockman of Mr. Cox (an extensive grazier
on the Cugeegong), who was in search of strayed cattle, and from
him we obtained the information of the discharge of the creek
into the river about three miles below his master's station.
Learning that every part of the forest-land south from us was
perfectly impassable, by reason of the heavy rains that had
lately fallen upon the country around, we continued winding along
the creek W.N.W. and N.W. about five miles, when it united with
the Cugeegong at a beautiful, clear, fertile flat, named Gurran
by the aborigines.</p>
<p>We continued our journey south up the bank of the river, over
rich alluvial flats, covered with strong grasses and luxuriant
nutritious herbage, constituting a permanent pasture for cattle.
The late rains had swollen the waters of the Cugeegong to a level
with its extreme banks. The declivity of country nevertheless was
so exceedingly moderate, that its current was barely discernible.
This exordinary fulness of the river afforded me but little hopes
of being able to cross its stream until its waters had
considerably subsided. However, upon arriving at the part
immediately opposite the hut and stock-yard of Mr. Cox, we were
shown a good ford three feet and a half deep, by which we safely
crossed this considerable stream, and encamped at that
gentleman's station.</p>
<p>16th. Here I rested my people and horses from the fatigues of
their journey, and we procured such comforts, particularly
vegetables, as this recently-formed establishment afforded.</p>
<p>I have now traced my long-protracted journey throughout all
its stages, to the left or south bank of the Cugeegong River,
having ascertained (for the information of the colonial
government) the structure and agricultural importance of the
country situate at the spring-heads of those streams which
constitute Hunter's River, the character of the lands westerly to
the pass, through a formidable range of mountains that forms the
southern boundary of Liverpool Plains, as also the route by which
the only line of communication can be opened to them from the
settlement of Bathurst; the measured distance between these open
tracts of country being 160 miles.</p>
<p>The mean of four meridional altitudes of the sun, taken during
the period of four days' rest at this station, places it in lat.
32° 32' 54", my estimated longitude being 149° 39' east.</p>
<p>20th. We pursued our journey to Bathurst up the left bank of
the Cugeegong, which consists chiefly of rich alluvial flats,
wooded generally with the apple-tree, with little or no
interruption by rocky, brushy patches, about twenty-four miles
S.E. to the point at which the beaten path intersects the river.
These fine grazing grounds vary in depth to the boundary ranges
from one to three miles, as the hills approach or recede from its
banks, and occasionally open into plains perfectly clear of
timber, and therefore affording excellent situations for stock
runs.</p>
<p>22d. Heavy, clouded weather, proceeding from the southward,
with every indication of a long continuance of rain being about
to meet us, I lost no time, upon reaching the beaten route to
Bathurst, at the point where it intersects the Cugeegong, in
advancing to the settlement, and we arrived there on the evening
of the 27th, showery weather having prevailed ever since the
20th, on which day we resumed our journey from Mannar, the native
name of Mr. Cox's stock-station.</p>
<p>27th. Upon our arrival at Bathurst, we learned that rain had
fallen during the last six weeks on the plains, and that the
Macquarie River had been flooded so considerably as to inundate
the wheatlands on its upper bank, a circumstance never before
witnessed since the establishment of the settlement.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Previously</span> to laying before this
Society a few collections of new, and corrections of old,
materials, on a topic to us most near and interesting, I wish to
guard my humble paper against any expectation that its title may
excite, of a complete and satisfactory dissertation upon a
subject which has been so little investigated, and which is so
difficult of investigation. Of the aborigines of New South Wales,
the manners and language are fast decaying; and of those of Van
Diemen's Land, they have never, from the unsociable disposition
of the males, been properly made known to us. Much also remains
to be learnt of the numerous islanders of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, before we can be said to have materials enough to
elucidate the great mystery of the peopling of the world; and It
is to be hoped that the institution even of this Society will, by
collecting and digesting all the physiological facts which lie
within its reach, contribute in some degree, however
inconsiderable, to solve the mighty problem.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the most philosophical division of the
varieties of the human species, is that of Professor Blumenbach,
into the Caucasian, the Mongolian, the Ethiopian, the Malayan,
and the American; but, with no more light than that which the
residence of a few years in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
has afforded me, I am of opinion that the professor is wrong in
classing the natives only of the <i>north-west</i> coast of New
Holland, and of the island of Van Diemen, in the Ethiopian or
negro variety, and the rest in the Malayan, together with the
more civilized and enlightened natives of the Indian Archipelago
and the South Sea Islands; and I think that all the aborigines of
Australia are of Ethiopian origin. I am fully aware of the
distinction between the natives of New Holland and those of Van
Diemen's Land, although I never before heard of any reason for
exempting the New Hollanders of the north-west coast from this
distinction; and I cannot learn any from our associate, Captain
King, who has seen more of that coast than perhaps any European:
but I do not think the difference between the New Hollander and
the Islander of Van Diemen by any means sufficient to class the
Australians into two varieties, like those, of the Birmanese and
the Great Andamaners,<a name="FNanchor_7_1" id=
"FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#fn7_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or
the Malays and the negro races of the Indian Archipelago.<a name=
"FNanchor_7_2" id="FNanchor_7_2"></a><a href="#fn7_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> The skull, the genius, the habits, of the
Australians appear to me, as far as I have been able to
investigate the subject, to have, in all of them, the degenerate
Ethiopian character, like that of the Andamaners, and the negro
races of the Indian Islands; and Professor Blumenbach, and after
him Professor Lawrence, have proved that the accidents of
straight or woolly hair, in different families or tribes, are
very insignificant marks of diversity, and do not at all render
it necessary, with Colonel Symes, on the origin of the Great
Andamaners,<a name="FNanchor_7_3" id="FNanchor_7_3"></a><a href=
"#fn7_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Mr. M'Leod, on that of a
woolly-haired Philippine Island near Luconia,<a name=
"FNanchor_7_4" id="FNanchor_7_4"></a><a href="#fn7_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> to call down the trenchant machinery of a
wrecked African slave-ship, to "account for the
ph&oelig;nomenon", or "explain the historical mystery".</p>
<p>The difference between the Birmanese and the Great Andamaners,
the Malays and the Papuans, the New Zealanders and the
Australians, is radical, and constitutes a variety in the human
species. The origin of each race must be looked for much higher
up than in a wrecked slave-trader, and the difference lies much
deeper than (like Sampson's strength) in the hair. "The
distribution of organic beings on the globe (says Baron Humboldt)
depends not only on very complicated climatic circumstances, but
also on geological causes, with which we are entirely
unacquainted, because they are connected with the original state
of our planet."<a name="FNanchor_7_5" id=
"FNanchor_7_5"></a><a href="#fn7_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
Birmanese, the Malayans, and the New Zealanders, are all
susceptible of civilization. The Birmanese are referred by
Blumenbach to the Mongolian variety of our species, and their
civilization is of great antiquity: the Sumatrans, Javanese, and
other East Indian islanders of the Malayan variety, have also
their religious antiquities; and the South Sea islanders are
evidently, from their persons, their aptness for civilization,
and their language, of Malayan origin likewise; hut the Great
Andamaners, the Papuans, and the Australians, like their
superiors, the American Indians, have never yet shown a
disposition to lead any other life than that of the hunter and
fisher, or to acknowledge any other government than that of the
strongest, and any other law than that of nature.<a name=
"FNanchor_7_6" id="FNanchor_7_6"></a><a href="#fn7_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> After the attempts of more than thirty years,
by the constant neighbourhood of colonies of Englishmen, to
civilize the natives of New Holland and Van Diemen's Land, they
are exactly in the same state in which we found them; and, I am
afraid, the following history of the Ethiopians of the Indian
islands will equally apply to those of Australia:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The brown and negro races of the Archipelago may be
considered to present, in their physical and moral character, a
complete parallel with the white and negro races of the western
world. The first have always displayed as eminent a relative
superiority over the second, as the race of white men have done
over the negroes of the west. All the indigenous civilization of
the Archipelago has sprung from them; and the negro race is
constantly found in the most savage state. That race is to be
traced from, one extremity of the Archipelago to another; but is
necessarily least frequent where the most civilized race is most
numerous, and seems utterly to have disappeared where the
civilization of the fairer race has proceeded furthest, as in
Sumatra, Java, and perhaps Celebes; just as the Caribs and other
savages of America have given way to the civilised invaders of
Europe. The negro races of the Archipelago increase in numbers in
the inverse ratio of improvement, or, in other words, as we
proceed eastward. In some of the spice islands, their extirpation
is matter of history. They are the principal races in seine of
the islands towards New Guinea, and nearly the sole inhabitants
of the portion of that great island itself which, from its
physical character, we have a right to include within the limits
of the Archipelago.</p>
<p>"The east insular negro is a distinct variety of the human
species, and evidently a very inferior one. Their puny stature
and feeble frames are not to be ascribed to the poverty of their
food or the hardships of their condition; for the lank-haired
race, living under circumstances equally precarious, have
vigorous constitutions. Some islands they enjoy almost
exclusively to themselves, yet they have in no instance risen
above the most abject state of barbarism. Wherever they are
encountered by the fairer races, they are hunted down, like the
wild animals of the forest, and driven to the mountains or
fastnesses, incapable of resistance."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
"FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#fn7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p>The difference between the New Hollander and the Van
Diemen's-lander is slight in the skull, and slighter still in the
colour, genius, or habits. M. Péron says, that the Van Diemen's
Islander has a large head, especially remarkable for the great
length of the diameter from the chin to the sinciput, and that
that of the New Hollander is fees bulky and compressed in the
back part, white that of the Van Diemen's Islander is elongated
in the same direction. The great difference consists in the hair,
which is either straight or curled in the former, and woolly in
the latter. The difference, in Africa, between the neighbouring
tribes of the Hottentots and the Kaffers (both Ethiopians) is
infinitely greater; the former being short, yellowish, with high
cheek-bones and flat noses, and the latter being tall, deep
brown, with the high forehead and prominent nose of Europeans. It
is language and grains, and not shape or colons, that are the
only tests of affinity of the human race. Language (says Mr.
Horne Tooke) cannot lie; and from the language of every nation,
we may with certainty collect its origin. The similitude and
derivation of languages (says Dr. Johnson) afford the most
indubitable proof of the traduction of nations, and the genealogy
of mankind. They add physical certainty to historical evidence,
and often supply the only evidence of ancient emigrations and of
the revolutions of ages, which have left no written monuments
behind them. But neither the analogy nor the diversity of
language (says Baron Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id=
"FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#fn7_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>) can
suffice to solve the great problem of the filiation of nations.
They afford only simple probabilities. Mr. Marsden, the author of
the History of Sumatra, and Mr. Crawford, of that of the Indian
Archipelago, have traced what they call the Great Polynesian
language, from Madagascar to New Guinea and the South Sea
Islands.</p>
<p>"In the general character, particular form and genius of the
innumerable languages, spoken within the limits of the Indian
Islands (according to Mr. Marsden) there is a remarkable
resemblance, while all of them differ widely from those of every
other portion of the world. This observation extends to every
country, from the north-west extremity of Sumatra to the western
shores of New Guinea, and may be even carried to Madagascar to
the west, the Philippines to the east, and the remotest of Cook's
discoveries to the south.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id=
"FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#fn7_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
original clothing of the Sumatrans is the same with that found by
navigators among the South Sea Islands, and in Europe generally
called Otaheitan cloth."<a name="FNanchor_7_10" id=
"FNanchor_7_10"></a><a href="#fn7_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>"One original language (says Sir S. Raffles<a name=
"FNanchor_7_11" id="FNanchor_7_11"></a><a href="#fn7_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a>) seems in a very remote period to have
pervaded the whole archipelago, and to have spread (perhaps with
the population) towards Madagascar on one side, and the islands
in the South Sea on the other; but in the proportion that we find
any of these tribes more highly advanced in the arts of civilized
life than others, in nearly the same proportion do we find the
language enriched by a corresponding accession of Sanscrit terms,
directing us at once to the source whence civilization flowed
towards these regions."</p>
<p>Now we cannot find the smallest vestige of this language in
the thousand Babel tongues of the New Hollanders and Van Diemen's
Islanders. And so it is with the Ethiopian races of the Indian
Archipelago.</p>
<p>"The negro races (says Mr. Crawfurd<a name="FNanchor_7_12" id=
"FNanchor_7_12"></a><a href="#fn7_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>)
who inhabit the mountains of the Malayan peninsula, in the lowest
and most abject state of social existence, though numerically
few, are divided into a great many distinct tribes, speaking as
many different languages. Among the rude and scattered population
of the island of Timor, it is believed that not less than forty
languages are spoken. On Ende and Flores we have also a
multiplicity of languages; and among the cannibal population of
Borneo, it is not improbable that many hundreds are spoken.
Civilization advances as we proceed westward; and in the
considerable island of Sambawa, there are but five tongues; in
the civilized portion of Celebes not more than four; in the great
island of Sumatra not above six, and in Java but two."</p>
<p>Mr. Crawfurd, in one of his pages, has given us a specimen of
the Great Polynesian language, in which I find that the words for
<i>eye,</i><a name="FNanchor_7_13" id=
"FNanchor_7_13"></a><a href="#fn7_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
<i>die, bird</i>, and <i>board</i>, are exactly the same, and no
fewer than ten other words nearly the same, as those in the
Church Missionary Society's New Zealand Grammar.</p>
<p>"That the New Zealanders are of the same race with the people
of the tropical isles (says Mr. Nicholas<a name="FNanchor_7_14"
id="FNanchor_7_14"></a><a href="#fn7_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a>) I think is unquestionable; and so striking a
resemblance do they bear in their manners and customs, as well as
in the conformation of their bodies, to the natives of Otaheite,
of the Society Isles, of the Marquesas, the Fejees,<a name=
"FNanchor_7_15" id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#fn7_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> the Tonga or Friendly Isles, and of Easter
Island, that it is impossible not to consider them the offspring
of the same primitive stock. They are likewise identified with
them in their superstitions and their systems of theogony, which
are only modifications of a common belief, originally assented to
by the whole of them, and altered in the lapse of time according
to caprice and circumstance. But what appears conclusive on the
subject is, that all these islanders speak one general language,
the variation in the words being only dialectical, while in many
of them no difference is perceptible."</p>
<p>Of this similarity Mr. Nicholas has given an example in his
vocabulary, where the New Zealand and Tonga words are compared.
He then proceeds to deduce the South Sea Islanders from the
Malays, and adopts Dr. Francis Buchanan's and Sir Stamford
Raffles's derivation of the East Indian Islanders from the Tartar
stock.</p>
<p>"To judge from external appearance, that is to say, from
shape, size, and feature (says Dr. Buchanan<a name=
"FNanchor_7_16" id="FNanchor_7_16"></a><a href="#fn7_16" class=
"fnanchor">[16]</a>) there is one very extensive nation that
inhabits the coast of Asia. It includes the eastern and western
Tartars of the Chinese authors, the Calmucs, the Chinese, the
Japanese, and other tribes inhabiting what is called the
peninsula of India beyond the Ganges, and the islands to the
south and east of this, as far at least as New Guinea."</p>
<p>Professor Blumenbach sees physiological reasons to divide this
"nation", as Dr. Buchanan calls it, into two varieties of the
human species, which he calls the Mongolian<a name=
"FNanchor_7_17" id="FNanchor_7_17"></a><a href="#fn7_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a> and the Malayan. Mr. Nicholas then endeavours
to trace the connexion between the South Sea and the Indian
Islanders; and here I think he tries to avail himself of
resemblances which are too general and unimportant, and even
descends to the absurd fancy, that the Mosaic account of the
creation may have been transmitted from Egypt to Asia, and so
(between Siam and China) through the Indian Archipelago to New
Zealand, because the people of the latter islands are generally
impressed with the belief that the first woman was formed of one
of the ribs of a man, and because <i>heevee</i> is their word for
<i>bone</i>. This is like the fancy of many of the New
Englanders, that the North American Indians were the descendants
of the ten tribes of Israel, because in some of their songs they
could distinguish the word <i>hallelujah</i>. All our religious
emigrants and missionaries are apt to assimilate the manners and
superstitions of their respective savages to Judaism, the Old
Testament being the ancient history with which they are most
familiar. The great principle of Polynesian religion, the
<i>taboo</i>, is manifestly of Asiatic origin.</p>
<p>"But it is among the Batta nation (says Mr. Nicholas), a
people who inhabit that part of Sumatra bordering on the Straits
of Malacca, and who have preserved their genuineness of character
from the first period of their origin to the present time, that
customs and institutions obtain, which in the aggregate resemble
those in New Zealand almost to identity."</p>
<p>Now it unfortunately happens that the Battas are not of the
Malay, but of the negro race of Indian Islanders,<a name=
"FNanchor_7_18" id="FNanchor_7_18"></a><a href="#fn7_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> so that Mr. Nicholas, instead of exalting the
New Zealanders to the rank of Asiatics by the laboured parallel
which he draws, is only demonstrating them to be Ethiopians. But,
in spite of their advocate, I believe the New Zealanders not to
be of the savage negro, but of the civilizable Malay race; and I
adopt the following paragraph from Mr. Crawford, as the truth of
the whole matter:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The common circumstance of affinity between all the
languages, both of the Indian Archipelago and Australasia, is the
Great Polynesian. I think it will be found that the languages
nearest to Java, in geographical position, or which possessed in
any respect the easiest intercourse with it, will, in the ratio
of these advantages, be found to contain words of the Polynesian.
They are abundant in the Malay and other cultivated tongues of
the west, decrease as we go eastward, and most where there is
most barbarism; until in the distant islands of the South Sea a
few straggling words only are found in the languages of the more
civilized tribes, and even these do not reach the dialects of
such abject savages as those of New Holland."<a name=
"FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#fn7_19" class=
"fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p>"In whatever way" (said the acute Bishop Watson, long before
these lights were shed upon the subject<a name="FNanchor_7_20"
id="FNanchor_7_20"></a><a href="#fn7_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a>) "the islands of the South Sea may have
become inhabited, the similarity (I do not say the identity) of
the languages spoken in them all, toads us to believe that they
have all had one common origin, and the tame (I conjecture) will
come, when the mother language of all the various dialects spoken
in these islands, will be discovered in some part of Asia."</p>
<p>Mr. Crawfurd has now proved, with great learning and
ingenuity, that the parent seat of this great Polynesian language
was Java: and Professor Blumenbach, with equally probable
physiological reasoning, has traced both the Indian and South Sea
Islanders to the Malayan variety of the human species. The only
object of the present paper is to exclude the Papuans, the New
Hollanders, and the natives of Van Diemen's Land from this class,
with which both he and Mr. Lawrence have confounded them, and to
place them among the negroes of the Indian Archipelago; and in
that arrangement I am fortified by the following passages from
Dr. Prichard's Inaugural Disputation on the Varieties of the
Human Species, pp. 85&mdash;89, and from Captain Tuckey's
Maritime Geography, vol. iii. pp. 315, 316.</p>
<p>"India is inhabited by a mixed race, made up of the aborigines
and of others, whom the pursuits of war and conquest have at
various times brought there. The religion of Bramah seems to have
been introduced from the north, and at later periods vast numbers
of the Mongols have entered and conquered the country. These
mixtures have effaced the peculiar characters of the original
inhabitants, which we must therefore seek for in the islands
protected by their situation from such visits. The islands of the
Indian Sea, as well as those of the Pacific, contain two races of
men, differing in many respects. One of these approaches, and in
some instances equals, the blackness of the negro: the hair is
curled and woolly, the body slender, the stature short, the
disposition barbarous and cruel. The other is more like the
Indians of the continent, lias a fairer skin, larger limbs and
stature, better proportions, and exhibits some marks of humanity
and civilization. According to Forster,<a name="FNanchor_7_21"
id="FNanchor_7_21"></a><a href="#fn7_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> the former, who are aborigines, have occupied
the middle and mountainous parts of many islands, leaving the
coasts and plains to the more recent colonists. They occupy the
highest parts of the Moluccas, the Philippines, Formosa and
Borneo, all New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and New
Caledonia, Tanna, Mallicollo (New Hebrides), New Holland and Van
Diemen's Land [and, according to the preface to the London
Missionary Voyage, Louisiade, Solomon's Isles, Santa Cruz and the
Fejees<a name="FNanchor_7_22" id="FNanchor_7_22"></a><a href=
"#fn7_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>]. The more recent nation
occupies Sumatra and the other islands of the Indian Sea,
Otaheite, and the Society Islands, the Friendly Islands,
Marquesas, Ladrones [or] Marian and Caroline Islands, New
Zealand, Sandwich and Easter Islands [to which may be added
Navigator's Islands<a name="FNanchor_7_23" id=
"FNanchor_7_23"></a><a href="#fn7_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>].
The language of all the latter resembles the Malay; and there can
be no doubt that they spring from that race, and have spread by
their ships over those distant spots. The black people are every
where barbarous, and, according to Forster, have languages not
agreeing with each other. In neither case can we perceive any
traces of the influence of climate.<a name="FNanchor_7_24" id=
"FNanchor_7_24"></a><a href="#fn7_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The latter race, scattered in various parts of the vast island of
New Holland, which has such variety of temperature, everywhere
retains its black colour, although the climate at the English
settlements is not much unlike that of England, and in Van
Diemen's Land, extending to 45° south latitude (it is well
understood that the cold is much more severe in the southern
hemisphere, at an equal distance from the equator than in the
northern), they are of a deep black colour, and have curled hair
like the [African] negroes."</p>
<p>"In the inhabitants of this Grand Archipelago we find two
great races, totally differing in physical appearance and in
moral character: these are the Malay, and the Papua or Oceanic
Negro. The Malay is no longer considered as aboriginal of the
little peninsula of Malacca, into which, by his own tradition, he
is only a comparatively modern emigrant from Sumatra and Java.
Neither is this rare confined to the archipelago, to which we
have assigned its name, but is diffused throughout the vast
Polynesia, from the Mariannes to the solitary Easter Island, and
from Owhyhee to New Zealand. Throughout this immense extent the
Malay physiognomy cannot be mistaken, and the Malay language is
universal, with no greater variations than are found in European
languages derived from the same root. The wide dispersion of this
race, in islands sometimes separated by many hundred leagues of
sea, has been a subject of much difficulty to the learned; some
supposing it from America; but both the physical appearance and
language contradict this idea. Others suppose the Malays to be
the aborigines of a continent submerged, while others have
attempted to trace them to an ancient civilized people of Java,
connected with India.</p>
<p>"The second race, the Papua or negro of the Grand Ocean, is
distinguished by the obtuseness of the facial angle, the
thickness of the lips, the hair frizzled without being woolly,
the members disproportionately long and very slender, and the
sooty complexion. This race occupies New Guinea and the
neighbouring islands (except the Freewill Islands of Carteret),
New Holland, New Caledonia, and the Fidgi Islands. Remnants of it
are also found in the Philippines, by the name of <i>Ygolotes</i>
and <i>Negritos</i>, and in the Moluccas, where they are called
<i>Haraforas</i> and <i>Alfurezes</i>; the <i>Googoos</i> of
Sumatra seem also to be of the same race. The physical
conformation of the Papua, and particularly the squareness of the
head, distinguish him from the African negro, and authorize the
supposition of his being indigenous in these countries. With
respect to language, it affords no ground far reasoning, every
tribe having a jargon radically differing from each other."</p>
<p>The inference to be drawn from the above analogies is
certainly, that the Australians will never be civilized, and that
the South Sea Islanders will; and experience is every day
fulfilling the reasoning. We have now lived among the former for
more than thirty years; and the most persevering attempts have
always been made, and are still making, to induce them to settle,
and avail themselves of the arts of life; but they cannot be
fixed, nor is it possible by any kindness of cherishing to attach
them. They have been brought up by us from infancy in our
nurseries, and yet the woods have seduced them at maturity, and
at once elicited the savage instincts of finding their food in
the trees, and their path through the forest,&mdash;propensities
which civil education had only smothered.<a name="FNanchor_7_25"
id="FNanchor_7_25"></a><a href="#fn7_25" class=
"fnanchor">[25]</a> They have been removed from their native
country, and in a foreign land have they robbed and run away from
their fosterer and only protector.<a name="FNanchor_7_26" id=
"FNanchor_7_26"></a><a href="#fn7_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
They have quick conceptions, and ready powers of imitation; but
they have no reflection, judgment, or foresight. They have no
wants but such as are immediate; and they have, therefore never
become either builders, or cultivators, or mechanics, or
mariners; aw had they ever any civil government or religious
superstition, like the Otaheitans, the Sandwich Islanders, and
the New Zealanders. They are the only savages in the world who
cannot feel or "know that they are naked;" and we are taught in
the Scriptures that the eyes of man cannot be opened to what we
call a civilized or artificial life, knowing good add evil, till
he acquires a sense of (perhaps false) shame or "fear", as it is
called in the Bible. The Payaguas and Mbayas are abominated by
the other South American Indians, because they are unacquainted
with modesty. They have plenty of clothes, but they make a bad
use of them (says the historian of the Abipones<a name=
"FNanchor_7_27" id="FNanchor_7_27"></a><a href="#fn7_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a>), for they cover those parts of the body
which may be exposed, and bare those which modesty commands to be
concealed. This is precisely the consequence of giving clothes to
the Australians; and twenty years' daily commerce with European
ladies and gentlemen fails to shame them. The women, however,
(adds Martin Dobrizhoffer) of both nations wear that degree of
clothing which modesty rebukes; and even the negroes of the
Philippine Islands (according to Zuniga) cover the fore part of
the body with a piece of bark. Now in Australia they are both
naked, the man and his wife, sad are not ashamed, with the
exception on the part of the women of the sitting posture,
mentioned by Labillardière. And it is therefore I am of opinion
that our savages will never be other than they are. An
intelligent and experienced member of the committee of our Native
Institution (the Rev. Mr. Cartwright) feels this impediment to
their civilization so strongly, that he would compel them not to
come into our towns naked; but I doubt the practicability both of
the means and the end. True,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Without black velvet breeches,
what is man?"</p>
<p>but how could they he "whipt from tithing to tithing", because
their breeches are black epidermis? Modesty is an innate feeling,
that no human power can inculcate&mdash;no government and general
order legislate. Yet not for this cause let us relax our efforts
in their favour; nor let us ever deny them a compensation for the
game which we have scared from the confines we have
usurped&mdash;"the native burghers of this desert city." Still
less let us treat them as our Malayan brother-colonists do the
aboriginal negroes of the Indian Islands, of whom Mr. Crawfurd
says, that "whenever they are encountered by the fairer races,
they are hunted down like wild animals of the forest, and driven
to the mountains or fastnesses, incapable of resistance."<a name=
"FNanchor_7_28" id="FNanchor_7_28"></a><a href="#fn7_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> Let us continue to them the chance of
receiving the comforts of civilization and the blessings of
religion, as an indemnification for the new vices and diseases
which they imbibe from us too readily. And if, even with all our
cultivation, the result should be the same as that of the poor
persecuted Ethiopian, who is "found guilty", by the Indian
islander, "of a skin not coloured like his own", and if decay or
extermination of the simple race of Australia should be the
gradual end of our colonization,&mdash;</p>

Voyage of the Alceste, p. 205. After all, I suspect that Mr.
M'Leod has confounded the woolly-haired pigmies of the interior
of Luconia, the <i>negrettos di monte</i>, with this imaginary
island.&mdash;See Blackwood's Mag. vol. iii. p. 577. De Zuniga,
in his History of the Philippine Islands, is of opinion that,
from their common flat nose and their dialects of one common
language, the origin of both the Indians and the negroes of these
islands is nearly the same: but surely the Malay nose is very
different from the Negro; and I doubt the fact of the resemblance
of the two languages; and so does Mr. Maver, his translator; but
he seems to confound the aboriginal negroes with the Tagalese.
Zuniga's theory is, that both the Indians and the Negroes
(especially the latter) are of South American and not Malayan
origin. Now, no two things can be more different than the
Ethiopian and the American varieties of our species. The Malayan
is nearer to the American, and the Mongolian so similar, that the
peopling of the western world has generally been attributed to
the Tartars of the north-eastern parts of Asia. To derive the
Indian Islanders from America is going back again, and reversing
all the scriptural and philosophical pre-eminence in antiquity of
the East: it is to make population circumnavigate the globe. But
I will give the Spaniard the benefit of his argument, however
unphysiological:&mdash;</p>
<p>"No doubt can be entertained that the radical language, from
which all these dialects spring, prevails from Madagascar to the
Philippines, with local shades of difference. It is spoken too in
New Guinea, and in all the islands to the southward, in the
Marianas, in the islands of San Duisk [a strange corruption of
Sandwich], in those of Otaheite, and in almost all the islands in
the South Sea, as far as the isle of Pasquas, which is not more
than 600 leagues distant from the coast of South America. On
observing that the proper names of places, about the middle of
the continent of South America, are very similar to those of the
Philippines, I endeavoured to procure a vocabulary of this
country, and did not fail to examine with great diligence and
attention the few words of the language of Chili which Ercilla
mentions in his Araucana, and which I found perfectly conformable
to the language of Tagala. The name <i>Chili</i> is a derivation
from this language: the cormorant is called <i>cochile</i>, and
this is a name which the Malays give to the sons of their kings.
<i>Chilian</i>, which is a town of Chili, is a compound from the
language of Tagala, in which language the termination <i>an</i>
gives the signification <i>town</i>. Thus, from <i>Cachile</i> we
draw <i>Cachilian</i>, meaning a town where there are cormorants.
<i>Mapocho</i>, which is the situation where the city of Santiago
stands, is another word of Tagalic composition, signifying a
town, and <i>pocquiot</i> being a kind of herb, we form the name
of <i>Mapocquiot</i>, a town in which there is abundance of this
herb. In Chili, they frequently double the syllables in forming a
word, as <i>ytayta, biobio, lemolemo, coloco</i>. A great many
other words are either actually of Tagalic derivation, or
assimilate closely to that language. In examining the structure
of these two languages, we are compelled to conclude that they
flow from one and the same source; and I dare affirm that the
Indians in the Philippines are descended from the aborigines of
Chili and Peru, and that the language of these islands derives
itself immediately from the parent source, those of the
neighbouring islands being dialects of this. Many will urge the
absurdity of this supposition, on the plea that the more
immediate vicinity of the Philippines to Malacca must have
occasioned them to be colonized by the Malays, as our historians
generally assert. I do not deny that these islands could easily
have been peopled by the Malays; but how could they colonize the
Isles de Palaos and Marianas, which are distant more than 300
leagues? And it is still more improbable that they colonized the
islands of San Duisk [Sandwich] and Otaheite, which are distant
2000 leagues from the Philippines.* All these people, however,
have the same language, the same manners and customs, and
consequently the same origin as our Indians. There is, in my
opinion, this other reason for supposing these latter islands
could not be peopled from the westward, viz.&mdash;that in all
the torrid zone the east wind generally prevails ** which, being
in direct opposition to the course from Malacca and the adjacent
islands, it is fair to conclude that the inhabitants of all the
islands of the South Sea came from the east, sailing before the
wind; for we have seen it often happen that the Indians from the
Palaos have arrived at the Philippines precisely under these
circumstances. On the contrary, we have no instance on record of
any of the Philippine Indiana having been, even by accident,
carried by the winds to the islands to the eastward. Indeed, we
know the reverse of this to be true, since at times the most
experienced pilots, in attempting this navigation, have been
compelled to return without falling in with the islands they went
in search of, from the necessity there is, in the voyage, of
being provided with proper nautical instruments. Here, therefore,
we appear to have found the most probable solution of our
difficulties, that is, that the first settlers came out of the
east (we may presume from the coast of South America), and
proceeding gradually to the westward, through the Pacific Ocean,
studded as we find it with islands at no very great distance from
each other, and of coarse of easy access before the wind, it
follows that to whatever point in an eastern direction we can
trace the Tagalic language, we may conclude that at that point
emigration must have commenced." <i>History of the Philippine
Islands, Manilla</i>, 1803, vol. i. c. 2.</p>
<p class="foot">[* But the whole Pacific, from Malacca to Easter
Island, is thickly studded with islands, for
stepping-stones.&mdash;B.F.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** But <i>see postea</i> p. 219, note.]</p>
<p>"At Watteo, Captain Cook met three natives of Otaheite, who
had been driven by the winds and currents thus far to leeward in
attempting to pass in a canoe to Uliatea. Captain Cook, after
relating their story, observes: 'The application of the above
narrative is obvious: it will serve to explain, better than a
thousand conjectures of speculative reasoners, how the detached
parts of the earth, and in particular how the islands of the
South Sea, may have been first peopled, especially those that lie
remote from any inhabited continent, or from each other.' But
this fact, as well as others of the same nature, proves directly
the contrary of the inference deduced from it by Captain Cook,
namely, the peopling of Polynesia from the west; for in all these
instances, the natives have been driven from east to west by the
trade-wind and equatorial currents, and hence the real
consequence would seem to be, the derivation of the Polynesian
race from America; a consequence, however, which every physical
and moral feature of these people forbids us to adopt."

The best and latest account of the North American Indians is
given by Mr. Hodgson of Liverpool, in the Missionary Registers
for November and December, 1821. The American Board of Missions
have two schools or native institutions in actual work, viz.
Elliott among the Choctaws, and Brainerd among the Cherokees; the
former consisting of 80, and the latter of 200 (Mr. Hodgson says
80) children; and the Board are forming other missionary
settlements among the Indians; but what are these among a
population of 258,969, as the Indians of the United States alone
are still stated to be? It is like the poor four black children
that composed the Australian Native Institution(!) in 1823. But
it is more promising to learn, that in 1819 the Council of the
Lower Towns of the Choctaws devoted their third of an annuity of
6000 dollars for seventeen years, which they have been receiving
since 1816 from the United States, for the sale of a tract of
country, to the establishment of a school in their district; and
this example was followed in March, 1820, by the Six Towns, and
in June by the Upper Towns; 6000 dollars being thus appropriated
annually to this object by the nation. Mr. Hodgson adds, that one
of these districts had before requested the United States not
only to forbid the introduction of ammunition into the nation,
that the banter may be compelled to work, but to send their
annuity in implements of husbandry; that at a recent general
council of the chiefs, 1000 dollars in money, and upwards of
eighty cows and calves, were subscribed for the use of schools;
and that the total contribution of the Choctaws to this object
exceeds 70,000 dollars. When the farmer and his family begin to
cut the corn themselves, the fields will be cleared. On the other
hand, the national council of the Creek Indians refused to
receive a mission. The Cherokees are said to be making
considerable advances in civilization. They have divided their
country into districts, have kid a tax on the people to build a
court-house in each district, and have appointed four circuit
judges; and are rapidly adopting the laws and manners of their
white brethren. The English language has been adopted as the
official one, in which the national records are kept, and is
universally gaining ground among the nation. Not a few
individuals, and those of influence, have altogether discarded
the Indian language and customs. It is a circumstance uncommonly
favourable, that so great a proportion of those who have already
become Christians consists of mothers of families; because,
according to the manners of the Cherokees, with these resides the
principal influence on all the other members of a family, both as
to external arrangements and their way of thinking. By marriage,
the husband is considered as in some degree adopted into the
family of his wife, and the wife's brothers are regarded as, in
some respects, entitled to more influence over the children than
their own father. "As few of the Creeks are rich enough (says Mr.
Hodgson) to purchase many negroes, all the drudgery is performed
by the women, and it is melancholy to meet them, as we
continually did, with an infant hanging on their necks, bending
under a heavy burthen, and leading their husband's horse, while
he walked before them, erect and graceful, apparently without a
care." Christianity is the only religion that has ever equalized
women with men; and if, with all this bodily slavery to the men,
and mental influence over them, the women of North America do not
introduce Christianity with civilization in her hand, they do not
deserve to other than they are.</p>

"#FNanchor_7_23">[23]</a> "At first we perceived no difference
between the language of the people of Navigator's Islands and
that of the people of the Society and Friendly Islands, the
vocabularies of which we had with us; but a closer examination
taught us that they spoke a dialect of the same tongue. A fact
which may tend to prove this, and which confirms the opinion of
the English respecting the origin of these people, is, that a
young Manillese servant, who was born in the province of Tagayan,
on the north of Manilla, understood and interpreted to us most of
their words. Now it is known that the Tagayan, Talgal, and all
the dialects of the Philippine Islands in general, are derived
from the Malay; and this language, more widely spread than those
of the Greeks and Romans were, is common to the numerous tribes
that inhabit the islands of the South Sea. To me it appears
demonstrated, that these different nations are derived from Malay
colonies who conquered these islands at very remote periods; and
perhaps even the Chinese and Egyptians, whose antiquity is so
much vaunted, are moderns compared to these. Be this as it may, I
am convinced that the race of woolly-haired men, still found in
the interior part of the islands of Luconia and Formosa, were the
aborigines of the Philippine Islands, Formosa, New Guinea, New
Britain, the New Hebrides, Friendly Islands, &amp;c. in the
southern hemisphere, and of the Carolines, Ladrones, and Sandwich
Islands in the northern. In New Guinea, New Britain and the New
Hebrides, they were not to be subdued; but being vanquished in
the islands further east, which were too small to afford them a
retreat in their centres, they intermingled with their
conquerors; and hence originated that race of very black people,
whose complexion still remains a few shades deeper than that of
certain families in the country, who probably made it a point of
honour not to contaminate their blood. These two very distinct
races appeared striking to our eyes at the Navigator's Islands;
and I can ascribe them to no other origin.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it may be objected that it would have been very
difficult for the Malays to pass from the west to the east, to
arrive at these different islands; but the westerly winds are at
least as frequent as those from the east, in the vicinity of the
equator, in a zone of seven or eight degrees north and south; and
they are so variable, that it is very little more difficult to
make a voyage to the eastward than to the westward." <i>La
Pérouse's Voyage</i>, chap. xxv.</p>
<p><a name="fn7_24" id="fn7_24"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_7_24">[24]</a> "All former navigators, and especially
Captain Cook in the Endeavour, found the immense continent of New
Holland very thinly inhabited. The diminutive size of its
inhabitants, the peculiarity of their customs and habits, their
total want of cocoa-nuts, cultivated plantations and hogs,
together with the most miserable condition of their huts and
boats, prove beyond all doubt that the South Sea Islanders are
not descended from the natives of New Holland. But, what is still
more convincing, their language is totally different, as
evidently appears from the examination of a vocabulary obligingly
communicated to me by Captain Cook. We have therefore nothing
left but to go further to the north, where the South Sea Isles
are, as it were, connected with the East Indian Isles. Many of
these latter are inhabited by two different races of men. In
several of the Moluccas is a race of men who are blacker than the
rest, with woolly hair, slender and tall, speaking a peculiar
language, and inhabiting the interior hilly parts of the
countries: in several isles these people are called
<i>Alfoories</i>. The shores of these isles are peopled by
another nation, whose individuals are swarthy, of a more
agreeable form, with curled and long hair, and of a different
language, which is chiefly a branch or dialect of the Malayan. In
all the Philippines, the interior mountainous parts are inhabited
by a black set of people, with frizzled hair, who are tall,
lusty, and very warlike, and speak a peculiar language, different
from that of their neighbours. But the outskirts, towards the
sea, are peopled with a race infinitely fairer, having long hair
and speaking different languages. They are of various
denominations, but the Tangales, Pampangos, and Bissayas, are the
most celebrated among them. The former are the more ancient
inhabitants, and the latter are certainly related to the various
tribes of Malays, who had overrun all the East India Islands
before the arrival of the Europeans in those seas. Their language
is likewise in many instances related to that of the Malays. The
isle of Formosa or Tai-ovan has likewise, in its interior hilly
parts, a set of brown, frizzly-haired, broad-faced inhabitants.
The isles of New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland, have
certainly black-complexioned inhabitants, whose manners, customs
habits, form, and character, correspond very much with the
inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, belonging to the second
race in New Caledonia, Tanna, and Mallicollo; and these blacks in
New Guinea are probably related to those in the Moluccas and
Philippines. The Ladrones and new-discovered Caroline Islands
contain a set of people very much related to our first race.
Their size, colour, habit, manners, and customs, seem strongly to
indicate this affinity; and they are, according to the account of
some writers, nearly related in every respect to the Tagalese in
Lucon or Manilla; so that we may now trace the line of emigration
by a continued line of isles, the greater part of which are not
above one hundred leagues distant from each other. We likewise
find a very remarkable similarity between several words of the
fair tribe of islanders in the South Sea and some of the Malays.
But it would be highly inconclusive, from the similarity of a few
words, to infer that these islanders were descended from the
Malays; for as the Malay contains words found in the Persian,
Malabar, Braminic, Cingalese, Javanese, and Malegass, this should
likewise imply that the nations speaking the above-mentioned
languages were the offspring of the Malays, which would certainly
be proving too much. I am therefore rather inclined to suppose
that all these dialects preserve several words of a more ancient
language, which was more universal, and was gradually divided
into many languages now remarkably different. The words,
therefore, of the language of the South Sea Isles, which are
similar to others in the Malay tongue, prove clearly, in my
opinion, that the eastern South Sea Isles were originally peopled
from the Indian or Asiatic northern isles; and that those lying
more to the westward received their first inhabitants from the
neighbourhood of New Guinea."&mdash;<i>Forster's

<p><span class="a">During</span> a former residence in this
country, I was induced to visit Hunter's River, to which my
journey was made by sea, and from which I returned in the same
way; but the vessel being forced to put into Broken Bay, I walked
across to Port Jackson.</p>
<p>The line of coast presents in general an aspect of bold
perpendicular cliffs of sand-stone, lying in horizontal strata.
These cliffs, however, are occasionally interrupted by sandy
beaches, behind which the country is low and flat, the high land
appearing to retire considerably. On a near inspection, these
spaces, now occupied by sandy beaches, seem, at no very remote
period, to have formed the entrance of bays and arms of the sea.
In many places they are even now so partially filled up, that we
still find extensive salt-water lagoons, separated from the ocean
only by a bank of sand, through which the water yet occasionally
forces a passage. The strata of sand-stone consist of beds lying
one upon the other in the most regular manner, so that they have
evidently never undergone any deviation from their original
relative situation. It is true that the beds are not invariably
strictly horizontal, but this arises perhaps from a gentle
yielding of the substrata. Some of these beds, although perfectly
horizontal, and of regular thickness, consist of thin laminæ,
which incline at a considerable angle to the north-east. This
sand-stone may generally be called silicious. It is rarely
argillaceous, chiefly in this state over coal: it is then soft
and very decomposable. Among the coal metals we occasionally meet
thin beds of what may be called calcareous sand-stone.</p>
<p>The country immediately to the south of Hunter's River is (as
is well known) an extensive coal-field. The cliffs on the
sea-shore present a most interesting section of the coal-field
strata. There in one day more information may be obtained, than
in other places in many years. I traced the strata for nine
miles, when they abruptly terminated by suddenly bending
downwards, and sinking below the level of the sea. From this
place a long sandy beach and low land extend to the entrance of
Lake Macquarie (called also Read's Mistake). The south head of
Lake Macquarie rises into high cliffs, in which the coal strata
again present themselves. Dr. Hutton would have given much for a
single day's walk along this shore. Here we see at one glance the
progress of some of the most interesting operations of
nature&mdash;the work of many ages. It appears as if the crust of
the earth had been broken, and a bold and regular section forced
upwards, and presented to our examination. Between the coal-beds
we find strata of sand-stone and beds of slate-clay with
vegetable impressions; sometimes (but more rarely) indurated
clay-stone. Embedded in these strata, there is found abundance of
argillaceous iron ore. This is occasionally cellular and in
layers; but for the most part it appears in the form of
petrifactions of trees and branches, irregularly dispersed. Near
the southern termination of the coal-field (that is, where I have
mentioned its sinking beneath the level of the sea), two large
beds gradually approach, and at length meet. They do not,
however, incorporate, but run parallel; and at this place there
is a mass of highly indurated pudding-stone, which reaches from
the surface of the coal to the top of the cliff. The coal-cliff
abruptly terminates at the entrance of Hunter's River, then
forming what is called coalhead. On the north side of the river,
a sandy beach and low land extend to the vicinity of Port
Stevens.</p>
<p>The coal is decidedly of vegetable origin: the fibre of the
wood is often quite distinct.</p>
<p>The vegetable impressions in the slate-clay under and over the
coal are no less worthy of an attentive consideration. I have
seen some of these subterranean plants in full flower, so that a
skilful botanist might ascertain even their species. I think that
I have been able distinctly to recognise the leaf of the zamia
spiralis.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, what I now advance consists of mere hints,
thrown out to induce some adequately scientific person fully to
investigate this very curious and untrodden field.</p>
<p>I afterwards, found, by examining the ravines, that the
sand-stone strata extended from the sea-coast to the river Nepean
on the west. In many of these ravines I found indications of
coal, viz. coal-field schistus with vegetable impressions,
argillaceous iron ore, the same calcareous stone formerly
indicated, and even fragments of coal. Through that extent of
country, the sand-stone seems, to spread like a level platform;
and although the country rises in hills and ridges, these seem to
consist of a mass of clay, the surface of which has been worn
into inequalities by the action of water. Consequently the higher
portions, which contain most of the original soil, are more
fertile than the bottoms of the valleys, unless these have been
covered by alluvial depositions. This clay is generally at the
surface red, and impregnated with iron: in some places, however,
it is white and saponaceous, appearing under the form of
beautiful pipe-clay; and I have seen this white clay contain
nodules of calcareous stones resembling stalactites, and
evidently formed by aqueous deposition. At the depth of a few
feet it generally assumes the appearance of schistus, impregnated
with sulphate of alumina and sulphate of iron.</p>
<p>Beyond the Nepean River the sand-stone strata are forced
upwards, and extend from north to south, forming the range of
hills known in the colony by the name of the Blue Mountains.
Towards the north shore, these mountains are sterile and ragged.
Towards the south, however, the sand-stone is in many places
covered or displaced by whinstone, which sometimes assumes the
form of common, at other times of porphyritic, trapp. In the
latter state it shows itself throughout the verdant,
well-watered, and very desirable pastoral district of
Argyleshire. In this county, wherever the soil lies upon
sand-stone, we find it consisting of the common Australian clay.
Over the whinstone, again, it invariably consists of light black
mould. On advancing further to the south, both granite and
primitive lime-stone ase found. I have however seen neither, and
am therefore unable to speak more fully on the subject.</p>
<p>As I have lately had an opportunity of examining some parts of
the coast, as far south as Mount Dromedary, I shall annex a short
account of such further observations as I have been able to
make.</p>
<p>It was Lieutenant Johnston's and my first intention to have
entered Shoal Haven River. We found it, however, opening into the
sea through a sandy beach, and with a chain of breakers across
the entrance, in the same manner as when it was examined several
years ago by Mr. Oxley. We therefore stood towards the little
haven three miles to the southward. A low sandy beach extends
from the river to Shoal Haven. There is, however, a high rocky
point on the south side of the entrance; and this protects the
little passage from the southerly winds, and prevents it from
being filled up.</p>
<p>This high land extends some miles along the coast, and is at
length terminated by a shoal lagoon. It consists of sand-stone
lying upon indurated blue slate-clay, covered with the usual
Australian soil. I almost think it was originally a barrier
island to on extensive bay behind, now occupied by low alluvial
land. At high water this place seems at first of some
consideration, being rather extensive, and presenting many arms.
At other times it seems merely a collection of mud banks, the
tops of which are covered with mangroves, and with shallow
channels. At the top of one of the arms, it is separated from
Shoal Haven River by a narrow isthmus, not two hundred and fifty
yards broad, and across this we hauled the boat to examine the
river.</p>
<p>The land at the back of Shoal Haven, and south of the river,
is low and swampy, so as in some places to be incapable of
producing trees. There is, however, a more elevated border along
the immediate bank of the river. Behind this it sinks into a
lagoon, which seems, at no distant period, to have been the bed,
or at least a channel or branch, of the river, then opening into
Shoal Haven. Indeed even now it is hardly elevated above the
level of the sea at high water. At a distance of about eight
miles from the sea, the shores of the river become high, and
consist of perpendicular sand-stone cliffs. This appeared to be
the original mouth, which formerly discharged itself into a large
bay, sheltered by an island. This bay is now filled up, and
presents the appearance of low alluvial land, swamps, and
lagoons.</p>
<p>We went up the river more than twenty miles, when we were
stopped by a long rapid. At this place the river might be about
one hundred and fifty yards wide, and was flowing perhaps double
that distance over small, rounded, water-worn stones, which it
hardly covered. The tide flows thus far, which may be considered
the termination of the inland navigation. For some distance
below, the alternate projecting points consist of alluvial land.
They are, however, of small extent, often bounded behind by the
steep precipices, which formed the ancient shore of the river,
and seem, from the marks left by the floods, exposed to dangerous
inundations. I ascended one of the cliffs near this place. The
sandstone was little compact, hardly fit for the purposes of
building, and although it did not entirely resemble
pudding-stone, still it consisted of, or at least contained, the
fragments of older rocks, viz. lumps of quartz, fragments of
primitive clay-slate, &amp;c. Here I collected some alum, almost
pure, which had oozed from the crevices of the strata. At the
season of the year when we visited Shoal Haven River (January),
we found the water hardly fresh, a few miles below the rapid, and
indeed the upper part of the river more resembled a long lagoon
than any thing else, having little current, and a very
inconsiderable rise and fall of tide.</p>
<p>Not finding a convenient watering-place in Shoal Haven, we put
into Jervis's Bay, and anchored under the shelter of Bowen
Island, where we readily supplied ourselves. I found that the
heads of Jervis's Bay and Bowen Island consisted of the same
horizontal strata of sand-stone observed in otter places.
However, as we entered late in the evening, and went out early
next morning, I had hardly an opportunity of making further
observations at that time.</p>
<p>On leaving Jervis's Bay we proceeded to the southward, and in
the course of the forenoon entered with our boat a small opening
beyond the deep bay, south of St. George's Head. We found the
entrance defended by a reef, under which small craft might
receive shelter. At this time these was a depth of four feet at
low water over the bar. The inlet runs in a northerly direction,
and terminates at the distance of about five miles, in a large
salt lagoon, which lies to the south and west of Jervis's Bay.
The shores of the inlet are generally low, and are either sandy
or swampy. New the lagoon, however, on the western ride, there is
forest land. The creek, through its whole extent, seems separated
from the sea merely by a sandy flat of recent formation.</p>
<p>The same afternoon we attempted to enter an opening to the
north of a point of land, lying newly east of the Pigeon House,
and which was described to us by the natives as the entrance of a
river. We were glad, however, to return in safety, without
effecting our purpose, after having the boat nearly filled in
attempting to pan the bar. After this we proceeded direct to
Bateman Bay, which we entered in the evening, and came to an
anchor late at night under Snapper Island. Next day I proceeded
up the river Clyde, in company with Lieutenant Johnston, its
discoverer. The general appearance of the river agrees very well
with his description. He was, however, surprised to find it quite
salt, in situations where he had found, on his former visit,
about a month before, excellent fresh water. (It was then very
rainy weather.) At a short distance below what he calls the fast
rapid, the river was fresh, and most likely will continue so
about that place at all seasons. At this place, however, the
navigation ceases, and we could only proceed a few miles farther
in the boat at high water. Thus far the direction of the river is
northerly, with an inclination to west: the fresh-water run,
however, comes chiefly from the southward. Throughout, the river
winds in a beautiful manner among the hills, which slope
gradually to the water's edge. These hills are moderately wooded.
The white gum (eucalyptus [blank]) is the most prevalent.
Generally the soil is rather barren, and is covered with low
ferns, prickly shrubs, and a kind of dwarf palm, called
<i>burrawang</i> by the natives (zamia spiralis). As we advance
up the river, the alternate projecting points, on either side,
consist of rich alluvial soil, but are of small extent. The
general course, as I have said, of the river, or rather inlet, is
northerly with an inclination to west, and it ceases to be
navigable about ten miles south of the hill called the Pigeon
House. None of the supposed branches are of any moment, being
merely salt-water inlets, which terminate at a short distance
among mangroves. It is barely possible that some of than may have
a small run of fresh water at their heads. Fresh water is scarce
at the lower part of the river. Indeed we found merely one small
spring, and that was not only indifferent, but below high-water
mark. The river itself is free from shoals, but is rendered
comparatively useless, from a bank at the entrance, over which
there is only ten feet of water. Snapper Island may afford
shelter for a few snail vessels.</p>
<p>At the spot where the river ceases to be navigable,
(accompanied by Mr. Hume and Thomas Davison) I took a journey of
four days into the interior, with a view to examine the country.
Generally we found it very hilly, consisting of steep ridges,
divided by narrow valleys, 60 narrow indeed that they frequently
ought rather to be called ravines. They are, however, very rich,
and generally well watered, overgrown with tall ferns (filices),
fern trees (alsophila australis), palms (corypha australis, and
seaforthia elegans), stately mimosas, and magnificent flooded
gums (eucalyptus [blank]) The sides of the hills are too steep
for the plough, but the soil is well adapted to the culture of
the vine. We did not find a piece of good pasture, or what is
called good forest land, in the whole district.</p>
<p>The geological character of the country is different from
those parts of New South Wales which I had formerly examined. The
only rock consists of a kind of coarse argillaceous schistus,
containing mica, of various appearances, resembling, at Snapper
Island, imperfect clay-slate, but in most other places assuming
the appearance of grey wacke. It lies in a vertical position, and
the strata extend from south-west to north-east. I found that it
equally traverses the bed of the river and the summit of lofty
ridges, and contains innumerable veins of quarto of all
dimensions. On travelling towards the westward, we found the
ridges gradually to ascend, and at length the summits were topt
with sand-stone. My visit did not admit of accurate observation;
but so far as I was able to judge, these ridges seemed first to
rise to the level of, and then to rest like abutments against,
the table-land of Argyleshire. On descending, which we did by
following the course of a ravine, we again found the old rock;
but although it still followed the same line of bearing, its
character appeased to change. It was hardened into compact
clay-stone, and the veins were more twisted, as if it had been
softened by the action of intense heat, and in many places the
quartz assumed the form of agate or rock flint. Following the
course of the ravine, it brought us to a small river ten or
twelve miles west of the Pigeon House, in the bed of which we
found masses resembling clay, porphyry, and jasper. This river
led us to the foot of the Pigeon House, which we ascended. There
is first a steep ridge, formed of the schistus already mentioned,
but more abounding in mica&mdash;(indeed I found some specimens
of almost pure mica slate). At the top of the ridge there is a
lofty terrace of pudding-stone. The country upon this assumes the
form of table-land, and the soil is a poor day, covered with
stunted bushes. The cone of the Pigeon House rises upon this
plain. It consists of horizontal sand-stone, and the dome, which
crowns the whole, consists of enormous masses of the same
material. At the foot of the cone we found a run of water. Actual
observation can alone determine the point, but I considered from
appearances that we had here attained the level of Argyleshire.
On descending from the Pigeon House, we again crossed the river I
have before mentioned, now become a considerable strata, and
flowing slowly to the eastward through a rich valley; but at this
place it seamed affected by the tides. From hence we regained the
Clyde, and rejoined our vessel.</p>
<p>On leaving Bateman's Bay, we proceeded with the vessel about
twenty miles to the southward; and on our return attempted to
enter an opening which is indicated in the chart about sewn or
eight miles to the southward of the bay. Here, however, was such
a fall of tide, as rendered it at that time to tally
impracticable. We therefore landed outside on a point, and walked
across, when we found the water extending among the hills in the
shape of a salt lagoon. We passed a night at anchor wider the
small island at the entrance of Bateman Bay, which is capable of
affording shelter to small vessels from easterly winds.</p>
<p>The outer island of Bateman Bay is of the same formation as
Snapper Island, consisting of as imperfect day-date of a blue
colour with white layers. These white layers are generally in a
state of decomposition, but the blue part is highly indurated,
and the strata are twisted in all directions; so that it is
Impossible to describe them. They appear as if they had been
exposed to intense heat. The shores of the bay, on the contrary,
consist of a soft red clay-stone, lying, as was said, in a
vertical position, which gradually gets more indurated as we
advance up the river, and at length assumes the form of
grey-wacke slate.</p>
<p>Our progress was delayed by southerly winds, and I had a
better opportunity of examining the appearance of the coast on
our return than before, We now succeeded in entering the mouth of
the river which we had crossed at the foot of the Pigeon-house.
The banks are alluvial, beyond which there is some tolerable
forest-land. We could only proceed upwards for about four or five
miles, when our further progress was stopped by large trees lying
across the bed of the river. West these impediments removed, I
think it would be navigable for boats to the foot of the
mountain.</p>
<p>About four miles to the northward we entered another opening.
Most of the prominent inlets along the coast are on the north,
side, of rocky points. This, however, was on the south side of a
point of whinstone. The entrance was very shallow; but at a
distance of several miles, we found deep water surrounded by high
land, shewing us the process of filling up an ancient
harbour.</p>
<p>A few miles to the northward of Bateman Bay, the vertical
strata disappear, and are succeeded by horizontal sand-stone,
which continues with interruptions to Jervis's Bay. These
interruptions consist of long sandy branches and projecting
points of whin. I landed on several places, under the shelter of
those points, and walked for miles, along the shore. I found the
country uniformly fertile and well-watered, wherever the basis
consisted of this rock. I was not inclined at the time to
attribute this formation to a volcanic origin, even although I
found plenty of pumice-stone lying upon the beach, because as
this had evidently been tin-own up by the water, it might ham
floated from New Zealand; but, on farther reflection, I cannot
help thinking that these points are of ignious formation, or
rather that the matter of which they are formed has been
projected from under the sand-stone in a liquid state.</p>
<p>We again entered Jervis's Bay, where we were detained several
days by unfavourable winds, so that I had an opportunity of
examining, many parts of it. Although it receives no rivers, we
found fresh water in abundance at the driest season of the year.
On the north side, the soil is low, sandy, or swampy, and in many
other places indifferent. I found however good land, both forest
and alluvial. The access to the bay is safe and easy; and
although it is not such a magnificent harbour as Port Jackson,
still it affords good shelter and safe anchorage, and as superior
to many of the best frequented ports in the world. The port of
Cadiz, which his been renowned from the earliest ages, is not to
be compared to it; and in the progress of colonisation, there is
no doubt it will hereafter be the seat of an important
settlement.</p>
<p>I shall now conclude with a few general observations, chiefly
arising from the foregoing facts.</p>
<p>1st. The extant of country, to which I have adverted, is
bounded on the west by a range of high land, generally at some
distance from the seashore, which, however, advances to the very
coast to the southward of Port Hacking, when it farms what is
called the Five Island or Illawarra Mountain; but which, on
reaching the northern bank of Shoal Haven River, again recedes to
the Westward.</p>
<p>2d. This range bounds the waters or rivers which fall into the
sea on the eastern coast.</p>
<p>3d. These rivers do not flow direct to the coast, but a great
part of their course is parallel with it, running to the
north&mdash;witness the Clyde,* Pigeon-house, Nepean, and
George's River. Has this course any connexion with the extensive
vertical strata which I found extending to the north-east at
Bateman Bay, and which seem to form the basis of the country?</p>
<p class="foot">[* The salt water inlet of the Clyde runs
northerly, but the fresh water runs chiefly from the
southward.]</p>
<p>4th. The rivers seem progressively to increase in magnitude as
we advance northerly; thus, Clyde, Pigeon-house, Shoal Haven,
Nepean, Hunter's River, and, I believe, the Hastings may be added
to the climax.** George's River, indeed, which is hemmed in by
the Nepean, is less than Shoal Haven; but its course is also
northerly.</p>
<p class="foot">[** And now the Brisbane.&mdash;<span class=
"u">Editor</span>.]</p>
<p>5th. A clay soil; having little attraction for moisture, is
the general characteristic of this part of the country. The
absence of springs depends upon the impermeable quality of the
soil; and the scarcity of running water is cawed equally by this,
and by the shape of the country.</p>
<p>6th. One of the most celebrated English agriculturists has
remarked that the softest fleeces are produced from sheep
depasturing on a clay soil. This not only corresponds with the
past experience of New Holland, but gives great hopes for the
future.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the geography of plants. Equal
attention ought to be given to the soils which they delight to
inhabit. This is not the place for such discussions. Still, as
being intimately connected with my present subject, and so
important, that there can be no successful cultivation of
exportable commodities in this colony. Without attention to it, I
cannot conclude without adverting to it.</p>
<p>The plants produced on our day soil contain generally little
or no alkaline salt, perhaps because it does not exist in the
soil. Tobacco abounds in alkaline salt. It is not therefore
proper for such soils, and, although the plant will vegetate in
them, its 'quality must be inferior. The clay soil is equally
unfitted for the vine, because the roots will penetrate to the
aluminous schistus, which will either poison the plant, or
communicate an inferior flavour to the grape. Again, the vine
will grow luxuriantly in the mere alluvial soil, and the fruit
will be large, but the juices watery. The truth of these remarks
is beautifully exemplified by this country in a state of nature,
where in the midst of iron-bound gum-tree forests, we meet with
circumscribed spaces, in which plants of a different description
are growing with tropical luxuriance.</p>
<p>As this country is so peculiar, and has so many apparent
disadvantages in the midst of some seeming advantages, it becomes
our duty to improve the latter, and to obviate the former. It is
therefore perhaps happy that its colonization has been deferred
until the present time, when the sum of human knowledge, both
moral and physical, is so extended, that these attempts may be
made upon just and rational principles, the result of which may
be expected to be very different from such as originate in mere
experiment, or (what is still worse) from such as are the
offspring of a false theory.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">In</span> offering to this Society the present
paper, I must beg leave to remark that, if it cannot be expected
in any science that the most learned themes shall excite general
interest, but if, on the contrary, they rather lose popularity in
proportion as they are rich in intrinsic value, this is most to
be feared of astronomical tracts, in which conciseness and
simplicity constitute the highest perfection of style, and by far
the most essential points are expressed in algebraical formulæ,
which to non-mathematicians are less intelligible than
hieroglyphics, and where a very few figures often comprehend the
whole fruits of many years' uninterrupted tedious labour. The
entertaining topics of this science, that please without
requiring theoretical knowledge, are so much exhausted, the
wonders of the heavens have been so often profaned by
astronomical book-makers, that I should be sorry here to follow
so sacrilegious an example; the more so as I conceive the object
of this Society to be the promotion of the knowledge of subjects
peculiar to this new part of the world, and not to dwell on
matters that may be equally well discussed in the old one. In
this view, Australia offers to astronomy as ample a field for its
researches, as to any branch of natural philosophy. I shall
endeavour therefore to enumerate the advantages which astronomy
can derive from an observatory in New South Wales, on account of
its geographical position, pointing out those subjects which
demand our particular attention.</p>
<p>The most obvious object in astronomy, that entirely depends on
locality, is parallax. Every body knows that parallax is the
change in the apparent place of an object, produced by a change
in the place of the observer. The trees of a wood, through which
a traveller passes, are continually changing their relative
situation; those which are the farthest remote being the least
affected. Thus travelling from the northern zones to this
southern hemisphere, we observe a similar phenomenon amongst our
fellow-travellers the planets, which disappear with the
infinitely distant fixed stars, whilst this is most conspicuous
in our satellite the moon. The position of a fixed star,
therefore, not being altered, either by our moving from one spot
on the earth's surface to another, or (which gives us a striking
idea of their immense distance) by the whole earth performing
with us her twelve months' voyage of six hundred millions of
miles round the sun, we may consider them as permanent fixed
points, and, by a comparison of them with the planets, discover
the changes in the apparent situation of the latter. An observer
in the north will find a planet's distance, from the identical
fixed star, different from what an observer in the south would
find it at the same moment. This difference is the parallax, the
quantity of which depends on the distance of the two observers on
the earth's surface, and may be determined with the greater
accuracy, the greater this distance is. Hence already appear the
material advantages of the geographical position of New South
Wales in astronomical regard. A small disadvantage arises from
the great difference of meridians, which allows us not to make
simultaneous observations with Europeans. This disadvantage is,
however, more than compensated by our being for the same reason
enabled to observe all such eclipses, and other phenomena of
short duration, as cannot be observed in Europe. The observations
of parallax are particularly precious during the nearest or
perigean distance of the planet, happening at the time of its
opposition or inferior conjunction. Such opportunities, where a
planet, in passing between us and a fixed star, covers it, are
still more valuable; and, most so of all, are the very scarce
occasions, when inferior planets cover others, or pass over the
sun's disk, as these may serve to corroborate the parallax of
each other and that of the sun.</p>
<p>As the parallax of an object depends entirely on its distance
from us and the dimension of the earth, it is evident that, from
the same observations which tend to determine the parallax, we
may also deduce the absolute distance of the sun and planets from
the earth, by a simple computation of a triangle, of which the
distance of the two observers in the northern and southern
hemisphere of the earth is the base, and the planet the summit.
In all these cases the advantage of an observatory in the
southern hemisphere is obvious. Merely for the purpose of
observing the transit of Venus over the sun's disk, expensive
expeditions were sent to different parts of the earth. By the
English government, Captain Cook was sent to Otaheite, Mason and
Dixon to the Cape of Good Hope, Dimond and Wales to Hudson's Bay.
By the French government, the Abbé Chappe d'Autrouche was sent to
Tobolsk in Siberia, and Père Pingré to Rodriguez, one of the
Mauritius Islands. The Spaniards sent Medina to California on the
west coast of America. From Germany, went Père Hell to Wardehuus
in Lapland; and many, other expeditions were undertaken. We shall
have, this year the benefit of observing in New South Wales, on
the 4th day of November, the transit of a planet over the sun's
disk, without the inconvenience and expense of travelling.</p>
<p>As we can, from the dimensions of the earth, draw conclusions
upon the planetary system, so we may reciprocally, from
observations of the heavenly bodies, infer the figure of the
earth. All astronomical observations rely on the laws of
gravitation. If the earth were a perfect sphere of homogeneous
mass, the plumb-line would always tend towards its centre, and
coincide with the radius sector. Similar arcs would be contained
between two parts of a meridian measured on the earth's surface,
and the corresponding parts of the celestial meridian,
intercepted between the points, where the direction of the
plumb-line, upwards produced, meets the heavens. But experience
proves the contrary. Actual mensuration on the earth's surface
accords not with difference of latitude determined by
astronomical observations. Hence it follows that the plumb-line
does not always tend towards the centre of the earth; but two and
two plumb-lines in different places on the earth will, produced
downwards, intersect each other in different points, which are
the centres of the curvature of the earth in these respective
places of its surface. This curvature varies, and from several
measurements of this kind it appears that the greatest curvature
of the earth is about the equator, and that it flattens towards
the poles. The many expeditions which for this purpose have been
sent to South America, Africa, Norway, and many other parts of
the world, are well known. The result of these is, that the
length of the polar axis is to the diameter of the equator as
303:304&mdash;very few figures, that have, however, caused
immense exertions, profound speculations, and laborious
calculations, and are of the greatest consequence in all
astronomical operations. This subject is at the present moment
again particularly engaging the attention of all astronomers in
Europe. A chain of triangulation, from the north of Denmark and
Norway, is continued down to the south of Italy, with the view of
determining, by a comparison thereof with the astronomical
observations, the real shape of the earth; but these results
would only imply parts of the northern hemisphere. It is not
improbable, however, that the southern half is differently
shaped; since, being proportionably covered with more water, it
ought, in order to balance the northern half, to be of greater
bulk; and this is moreover corroborated by the results of the
measurements of La Caille at the Cape, and Lambton in the East
Indies, which do not accord with the northern ones. La Caille
even deduced from his observations, that the radii of the
parallels in south latitude are less than the corresponding ones
in north latitude. The determination of these points forms,
therefore, another subject for astronomical researches in this
country, the extensive plains of which offer favourable
opportunities for measuring base lines.</p>
<p>Besides laborious mensurations, simpler processes may lead to
the same point. The shape of an ellipsoid depends evidently on
the distance of any point on its surface from its centre. Are all
these distances or radii sectores alike? then the body must be a
sphere. If not so, are, in strict theoretical sense, three radii
sectores, with the included arcs, sufficient to determine the
ellipse, if it be one? but this is not probable, nor can the
exactness of a few observations be relied on; and it is only by
various observations in different parts of the world, that an
approximation to the truth may be obtained. Now we have the means
of ascertaining the relative length of the radii sectores, or
distances from the centre of the earth, by the length of the
pendulum. For the squares of the distances from the centre of the
earth are inversely as the force of gravity; and the force of
gravity is known by the number of vibrations of one and the same
pendulum, in equal intervals, in different parts of the
world&mdash;or by the length of the pendulum, making in a given
interval a certain number of vibrations. So as we advance more
towards the poles, and our distance from the centre decreases,
the same pendulum must in the same intervals make more
vibrations, or the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds must
increase. The length of such pendulum at New South Wales is
therefore of great importance, and may serve to determine the
figure of the earth.</p>
<p>Again&mdash;The greater part of the European observatories
have remarked a difference between the latitudes obtained by
circumpolar stars, and those by solar observations. An anomaly
has also been discovered between the obliquity of the ecliptic
deduced from the summer, and that from the winter solstice. The
most probable cause of this inconsistency appears to be the
incorrectness of the hitherto-established laws of refraction. If
this be the case, we might expect greater anomalies in the
southern hemisphere, and particularly in so unusual a climate as
that of New South Wales; and observations of the above kind are
desirable in this country.</p>
<p>A variety of interesting pursuits offer themselves in this
yet-so-little-known part of the heavens. What a number of
celestial bodies may, during centimes, have been roaming about in
this wide field, that never rose to the arctic regions!
Henceforth, none can escape. Sentinels being placed at the Cape
of Good Hope and in Australia, no stranger can pass through the
southern hemisphere without being hailed. Had these been on their
posts thirty years ago, Enke's discovery of the periodical comet,
which we expect to see this year, would not have been so long a
secret, it being chiefly in high southern latitudes that it is
visible. The comet that surprised us in 1819 below the north
pole, would have been seen long before in the southern
hemisphere. The comet which we in Europe observed in February of
the last year but for a short while, it absconding in the sun's
rays, would, after its perihelian passage, have been seen by
antarctic astronomers as bright as that of 1811.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The comet, which in January and February,
1821, was seen by Europeans in the Pegasus, was a little south of
Sydney seen by the Honourable Judge of the Supreme Court, Barron
Field, Esq. From his observations, the comet's mean place, on
April 3d, 1821, at 7h. in the afternoon, follows:<br></p>

<p>To enumerate all the advantages which astronomy may derive
from a fixed observatory in New South Wales, would be an endless
undertaking. To an astronomer, immediately after his departure
from Europe, sailing down the Atlantic Ocean, with every step he
takes in latitude, the heavens present a new scene. Thus, as he
mounts over the earth's curved back, which till then interposed
itself between him and the heaven's southern zones, he gradually
sees down into a new field, richly sown with unknown stars, which
to register and class is his pleasant duty. In this we follow,
under much more favourable circumstances, a noble example first
given in 1677 by Edmund Halley in St. Helena, but particularly by
Nicolaus de la Caille, who (badly supplied by his government, and
worse fitted out with instruments) formed with indefatigable
exertions, at the Cape of Good Hope, from the year 1751 to 1754,
a catalogue of 10,035 southern stars, inclosed within the tropic
of Capricorn, determined the parallax of Mars and the moon, the
length of the pendulum, measured a degree of the meridian, made
magnetic observations, besides many other works, each of which
would have immortalized him. But infinite is the task, and beyond
human power. Neither Halley, La Caille, nor any of their
successors, could or can complete it. Much is, and must be, left
to do.</p>

<br>
<big>THE MARITIME GEOGRAPHY,</big><br>
<br>
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p><span class="a">A period</span> of nearly three centuries has
now elapsed since the first discovery of the continent of
Australia, the Terra Australis Incognita of ancient geographers;
and until within the last fifty years comparatively little has
been done towards investigating its various productions, or the
nature of its interior. The records of the visits of the early
Spanish and Dutch navigators merely acquaint us that "it was for
the greatest part desert, but in some places inhabited by wild,
cruel, and black savages;" and although their labours comprised
the discovery of its northern, western, and south-western coasts,
yet it was not until the year 1770, that the productions and
fertility of its eastern and most valuable shores were made known
to Europe by the immortal Cook, whose persevering and laborious
examination of its reef-bound coast, in a crazy ship, and amidst
a labyrinth of dangers, has justly placed his name in the
foremost page of the annals of Australian geography.</p>
<p>This coast, to which he gave the name of New South Wales,
extends chiefly in the direction of the meridian; and, being
contained between the parallel of 10° and 39° south latitude,
promises, from the variety of its climates, to afford the
productions common to both inter and extra-tropical countries;
whence a reasonable anticipation of the future weal of this
extensive dependency of Great Britain may be justly entertained;
but hitherto little has been effected to give a solid foundation
to this speculative hope. Several voyages have been made round
the continent in search of rivers, by means of which only a
knowledge of its internal resources can be obtained; but none of
important size or consequence have yet been found.</p>
<p>It is now thirty-five years since the colony at Port Jackson
was first established; and during this period, explorative
enterprise and perseverance have not been wanting; nor have
dangers or privations deterred many zealous travellers from
prosecuting their researches for the discovery of rivers.</p>
<p>These labours have been partially rewarded in the finding of
large tracts of fine country, which will materially hasten the
period of agricultural prosperity, towards which the colony is
making such rapid strides. Mr. Oxley's Journals have already, in
a great measure, acquainted us with the general features and
character of the country four hundred and thirty miles to the
westward of the colony, between the parallels of 30° and 35° 30';
and his track in 1817 would have crossed any river of importance,
had such existed to the northward of the former parallel, or to
the southward of the latter. The coast-line has been traced with
care by Captain Flinders and others as far as the tropic; and to
the northward of this, we did not detect in the whole extent of
coast (a distance of eight hundred miles), any opening, rivulet,
or creek, running twenty miles in an inland direction from the
sea. The absence of a river in this vast extent of mountainous
country would appear a paradox, did we not know that the
mountain-streams of this coast generally empty themselves into
large lagoons of water, which are formed at the back of the
beaches, and communicate with the sea by shoal channels of from
three to seven or eight feet in depth, through which the stream
of tide usually, runs out with great vapidity. Witness the lakes
between Ports Stephens and Macquarie.</p>
<p>The south coast of this country is barren, and in every
respect useless and unfavourable to any purposes of colonization.
The nature of the rocks is generally calcareous; but in many
parts from the South-west Cape to Wilson's Promontory in Bass's
Strait, the basis of the rock is granite, which occasionally
protrudes above the surface of the ground, and is covered with a
crust of calcareous stone, on the top of which is a shallow sandy
soil.* The two gulfs, St. Vincent and Spencer, are described by
Captain Flinders, who first discovered and examined them. They
contain salt water to, their heads. At the top of the latter is a
range of elevated hills, one of which (Mount Brown) is three
thousand feet high; but from the summit no rivers or lakes were
seen. Captain Flinders says of the view from this hill, "In
almost every direction the eye traverses over an uninterruptedly
flat, woody country, the sole exception being the ridge of
mountains extending north and south, and the water of the gulf to
the south-westward." ** He farther remarks of this place; "Mr.
Brown found the stone of this ridge of craggy mountains to be
argillaceous, of a reddish colour, smooth, close-grained, and
rather heavy." Very little good soil was found.</p>

p. 113.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Flinders's Voyage to Terra Australis, vol. i.
p. 159.]</p>
<p>To the eastward of this, as far as the entrance of Bass's
Strait, the coast is very sandy, and generally low and barren;
and the country in the vicinity of the strait is high, rocky, and
sandy.</p>
<p>Previously to my employment by the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, to complete the survey of the coast of this country,
the south and a part of the east coasts, as far as the latitude
22°, had been examined with care by Captain Flinders. That
officer had also surveyed the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and the greater part of Van Diemen's Land, when the wreck of his
ship, and his extraordinary and infamous detention by General
Decaen at the Isle of France, prevented his completing a work so
ably and indefatigably commenced. During the time of his being
engaged in this survey, a French expedition, under the command of
Captain Baudin, was employed on the same service. He sailed along
the outside of the islands, which fringe a great extent of the
north-west coast, but seldom saw any part of the main-land. The
completion, therefore, of Captain Flinders's survey was the
object of my mission; and in this task I have been employed for
the last four years. My instructions have led me "to examine the
hitherto-unexplored coast from Arnhem Bay, near the western
entrance of the Gulf of Carpentaria, westward and southward, as
far as the North-west Cape, including the opening or deep bay
called Van Diemen's Bay, and the cluster of islands called
Rosemary Islands, and the inlets behind them; the chief object of
the survey being to discover whether there be any river in that
part of the coast, likely to lead to an interior navigation into
this great continent."</p>
<p>In my way to the northward I sailed up the east coast, and
commenced a careful examination of its shores from the point
where Captain Flinders left it; but as this was contrary to the
tenor of my instructions, I could spare but little time to land;
and, with few exceptions, merely traced the coast, by which means
alone I could investigate whether there were any rivers or
openings between the latitude of 22° and Torres Strait, a
distance of more than seven hundred miles. For the greater part
of this space the sea-beach was seen by me; but nothing like a
river or opening of any consequence was observed. Whenever I did
land, my visit was confined to the neighbourhood of the
sea-coast, and there the soil appeared to be generally very
shallow, and the timber email and stunted. But in some parts,
particularly about the parallel of 17° of south latitude, the
country was well wooded, and bore a verdant and pleasant
appearance. To the northward of Endeavour River, in 15° 27' S.,
all semblance of fertility ceases; and the remainder of the coast
to the North Cape, which is about three hundred miles, is low,
sandy, and barren. At this spot also the granite rocks ceased to
appear. In latitude 14° S. is a projecting group of islands,
called Flinders Group, to the westward of which is Princess
Charlotte Bay, which Lieutenant Jeffrey, who commanded the
colonial hired armed brig Kangaroo, describes as having a rich
appearance, and very like the country of Van Diemen's Land. I
could not see it in so favourable a point of view. The bay is
deep, and gave me hopes of finding a river; but, upon
examination, I found the bottom shoal and covered with mangroves.
It is not improbable that there is a rivulet at the bottom of the
bay; but even if there is, it must be of trifling size.</p>
<p>Immediately to the westward of the North Cape, which bears the
name of Cape York, is the Gulf of Carpentaria, the shores of
which measure a space of nine hundred miles, the gulf itself
being four hundred miles deep and three hundred broad. The
eastern side is low and sandy; the western has many fine
harbours, and is bordered by some large islands; but the land in
the vicinity of the coast is low and very barren. Wellesley's
Islands, a group at the bottom of the gulf, "abound with iron
ore: the soil even in the best parts is far behind fertility; but
the small trees and bodies which grow there, and the grass in
some of the less covered places, save the larger islands from the
reproach of being absolutely sterile." * The principal rock
formation in the gulf is of a close-grained sand-stone.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Flinders's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 145.]</p>
<p>At the north-west head of the Gulf of Carpentaria my survey
commenced; but its great distance from Port Jackson, and the
inadequacy of the vessel I had to perform it with, have
considerably protected its completion. A brief sketch of the
nature of the soil, and productions of the coast, may not be
uninteresting to this Society; and, as the subject has been
naturally expected from me, I have ventured a few observations
upon it, which I now submit to the candour and liberality of my
friends.</p>
<p>The north coast, properly so called, is of small extent, and
is comprised between Cape Van Diemen and Torres Strait. From Cape
Wessel, which is the projection that forms the north-west head of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and is the extremity of a group of
islands of low, rocky, and barren character, as far as Cape Van
Diemen, the coast is low, and the shore an unvaried sandy beach,
occasionally broken by projecting rocky heads. In this place,
however, the coast is very much intersected, and is strewed with
many very fine ports and harbours. About midway between the capes
is a river, which I called Liverpool River, and which I ascended
for forty miles, without finding the land at that distance from
the sea one atom better than that near the coast. Fresh water,
however, was met at the distance of nine miles from the sea; but
no hills were seen, from which any large body might be expected
to be collected. The country was low and flat, and bore the
appearance of being, during the rains, occasionally inundated. In
an examination of this river we saw no animals excepting the
alligator, which was common. A few birds were seen, and on the
banks of the river we observed that called the native companion
(Ardea antigone, <i>Linn</i>.). Here also we saw a large tribe of
natives; but our numbers being few, I did not court an interview.
We passed a night near the head of the river, and were tormented
beyond description by the incredible number of musquitoes, which
generally abound near mangroves; and with these trees, for the
first fourteen miles from its entrance, the banks of this river
are impenetrably lined.</p>
<p>To the westward of this river are Goulburn Islands, which I
have visited every voyage, from, the circumstances of their
forming a fixed point of my survey, and offering a convenient
place to wood and water at. The natives here, although not
numerous, are very hostile; and have, on every visit, attacked
us. On one occasion Lieutenant Roe, my assistant-surveyor, had a
very narrow escape for his life. He suddenly found himself
surrounded by them, but happily succeeded in reaching our party
in safety, although the Indians threw many spears at him, and
almost compassed the cutting off of his retreat.</p>
<p>Near these islands, in April, 1818, just as I had completed my
wood and water, and was making preparations for departure, I was
surprised by the appearance of a fleet of Malay proas, which were
running along the coast, fishing for trepang or bêche-de-mer. Two
hundred of these vessels visit this coast every year, leaving
Macassar in the month of January, and returning in June or July.
The particulars of their fishery are described by Flinders and De
Freycinet; but the limits of their fishing-ground have not yet
been clearly defined. They certainly visit the western ride of
the Gulf of Carpentaria: I have seen their traces as far to the
west is 125° east longitude; but there is a considerable
incurvature of the coast between Cape Van Diemen and Cape
Londonderry, into which I do not think they penetrate. They are
at constant war with the natives, and are frequently attacked by
them; but having fire-arms, and being generally the more
numerous, they have the decided advantage. This hostility made me
very cautious of communicating' with the natives of this savage
and sterile coast, nor, as it proved, without good reason, for we
seldom visited them without some misunderstanding or rupture
taking place, from which we did not always escape harmless.</p>
<p>Near the western extremity of the north coast, in the ancient
charts, is a deep opening called Van Diemen's Bay. Some Dutch
ships entered it without finding its bottom, and therefore merely
speculated upon what it was likely to be. I found it an extensive
strait, separating two large islands from the mainland, the
north-westernmost extremity of which bore the name of Cape Van
Diemen. In this strait is a considerable gulf, trending to the
eastward, at the bottom of which I found some rivers, meandering
through a vast plain of low level land, bearing the marks of
great inundations. The soil is alluvial, but I think generally
shallow, and appears to be sprinkled over a stiff tenacious blue
clay. Here and there was a group of trees, among which the
palm-tree was occasionally seen, towering above the burnt-up
foliage of the stunted gum-tree. In the rivers alligators were
very numerous; but not so large as those which frequent the
islands of the Indian Archipelago. The largest we saw was about
fifteen feet long. The outlet of this strait (Clarence Strait) to
the south-west appeared to be dangerous and intricate. In the
centre of it is a group of low mangrove isles. Hence the coast
trends to the south; but continues to bear the same low and
sterile character as far as Cambridge Gulf. This is a deep and
extraordinary salt-water inlet, extending for upwards of sixty
miles through a circuitous channel, which, being narrowed in some
places to the width of half a mile, causes a rising tide. Here
the coast assumes a new appearance: high, bold, precipitous
ranges of detached hills suddenly rise from a level plain, which
is so low as to be covered occasionally by the high spring tides.
These waters are so quickly evaporated by the great heat, as to
leave the saline crystallizations encrusted upon the surface of
the ground, which gives it the appearance of being covered with
snow, and by reflecting the rays of the sun not only oppressed us
with the intense heat, but severely hurt and weakened the eyes.
This extraordinary gulf terminates in many shallow, muddy,
salt-water inlets, which, in the rainy season, would doubtless
furnish plenty of fresh water; but at the time of our visit
(September) they were as salt as the open sea. An equally
extraordinary quadrangular, fortress-like mass of hills, Mount
Cockburn, rises abruptly from a low plain about three miles from
the bank of one of these streams; this I should have visited, had
not the great heat of the weather prevented me. It bore all the
appearance of a regular fortification, and would be quite
impregnable to any military force. Westward from the gulf the
coast assumes altogether a new feature, and is much intersected
by numerous fine ports, bays, and some rivers. One of the rivers
(Prince Regent's) runs inland for upwards of sixty miles, and
terminates in a fresh-water stream. In this part of the coast the
tides are not only rapid, but rise as much as thirty feet on the
springs. The country, however, is not a bit better than to the
eastward, but rather worse. In the vicinity of Goulburn Islands
there were in patches something like soil, and here and there a
little gross; but in this part the country is a universal mass of
rocks, heaped one upon the other, and the interstices filled with
spinifex, a prickly useless grass, of a powerfully aromatic
smell.</p>
<p>The geology of this part of the coast consists of a siliceous
sand-stone, of a very hard nature and "fine grain: much of it was
coloured by a ferruginous oxide, and in one part we detected a
small quantity of native iron, imbedded on the same quartzose
rock, with copper pyrites.</p>
<p>At the west extremity of this projecting part of the
north-west coast, in longitude about 128° east, the high rocky
land is changed to a low sandy country, and so continues to the
North-west Cape. In many parts it is so low as not to be visible
from a greater distance than twelve or fourteen miles.</p>
<p>There is a considerable gulf at the western extremity of the
high land, which is not yet determined; but I rather imagine it
to be a strait. I penetrated about fifty miles up it, on the
inner aide of what I suppose to be an island; but I was obliged
to leave it, for want of provisions and other reasons. It is
sufficiently interesting in appearance to cause me to expect more
from it than any other part of the coast that I have yet seen. In
some parts of it the tide ran at seven knots, and, where no
islands or land contracted its stream, at three knots, and rose
from twenty-six to thirty feet. At this place we experienced
great heat: on board the vessel the thermometer ranged between
87° and 92° in the shade, but in the boat near the shore the
temperature was at 120°.</p>
<p>From the intricate nature of the entrance of' this opening, we
ran considerable risk in exploring it, both going in and out. The
islands and shoals are numerous; and the channel by which we
unwillingly entered it was not more than a hundred or a hundred
and fifty yards wide, with the stream rushing through it
prodigiously strong; A rock in the middle also increased the
danger, and, gave us great cause of alarm, since the ship became
completely ungovernable; but providentially the current carried
us by, four yards clear of the rock. The widest channel is, in
some parts, not more than two miles from shore to shore.</p>
<p>From hence to Depuch Island, a distance of about three hundred
miles, I have not seen any part of the coast; but De Freycinet
describes it to be low and sandy. From longitude 117° to the
North-west Cape, in about 114°, the coast is also low and sandy,
and in some parts rocky. Dampier's Archipelago, one of the
islands of which is the Rosemary Island of that celebrated
navigator, is a group more elevated than the main land, and among
these islands there are many favourable places for anchoring. In
the rainy season they would probably supply abundance of water,
but there is no wood. The only tree we saw was a ficus, and that
of very small size. It was here that I had my first and most
interesting communication with the natives. They appealed to be
warlike and numerous; but, like the rest ef the inhabitants of
this vast island, naked, black, spare-made, large-headed, with
curly hair, and scarred about the body. Their principal weapon
appeared to be the spear. We were well received by this tribe,
but were driven away by another not far from them. We were
doubtless the first European visitors to this part of the coast;
for Dampier landed only on the outer island, and did not
communicate with the natives hereabouts.</p>
<p>Between this archipelago and the North-west Cape, is a group
of low, rocky, barren isles, which the French expedition, under
Commodore Baudin, named Montebello Islands; and these are, as I
trust I shall be able to prove by the publication of my Journals,
neither more nor less than that redoubtable danger in the Indian
Ocean&mdash;"The Tryal Rocks", which so many ships have searched
for, and of which so much has been said and written.</p>
<p>Hence to the North-west Cape the coast is fronted by a range
of low sandy islets; and at the back or east side of the Cape, it
tends to the south for upwards of forty-five miles, and forms a
deep bight (called Exmouth's Gulf) containing little short of
absolute sterility.</p>
<p>Between the North-west Cape and Cape Leeuwin, is the West
Coast, which extends for nearly eight hundred miles in the
direction of the meridian. It is fronted by a rocky shore, and
inaccessible to boats, except in a few places. The only openings
in it are Black Swan River and Shark's Bay, both of which are
described by De Freycinet. During the examination of this part of
the coast, we experienced an almost continual gale of wind, which
rendered our approach dangerous. We saw enough of it, however, to
satisfy us of its arid and barren nature. The coast about Shark's
Bay is high and rocky, and of a reddish colour. At one part,
where we landed, namely in Dirk Hartog's Road, at the entrance of
the bay, we found the rock to be a calcareous sand-stone.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>GENERAL PRODUCTIONS OF THE INTERTROPICAL PART OF
AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<br>
<p>Fish is extremely plentiful in all parts, but not very easily
caught with hook and line. Turtle is also abundant within the
tropic, and of large size. It is both of the green and the
hawk's-bill species; and from the latter, great quantities of
tortoise-shell might be procured. Water-snakes were seen in all
parts near the coast; but I do not think they are venomous. The
longest we saw did not measure more than four feet. The manatee,
that Dampier describes, was not seen by us, unless on one
occasion, when an animal entirely different from the turtle was
seen on the surface of the water, but disappeared so suddenly as
to prevent our forming any opinion of what it was like.
Shell-fish seemed to abound, from the large quantities of broken
shells that are thrown upon the beaches. At Shark's Bay, we found
great numbers of various kinds; and on the reefs of the east
coast there is also abundance, but not in any great variety. The
only land animals seen by us were kangaroos, kangaroo-rats, dogs,
opossums, and a large vampyre bat. The traces of emues were met
with; but the birds themselves were not seen. There are no edible
fruits of any importance. The cabbage-palm and the betel-nut were
occasionally met with, and the sago-palm is abundant on all parts
of the north coast. Two species of nutmeg were found, but they
are not fit for use. We saw no trees fit for naval purposes,
excepting in the vicinity of the tropic, on the east coast, where
the Norfolk Island pines grow, but not to large dimensions. In
appearance they seem not worth a trial, but experience has fully
proved their value as masts, provided a tree is chosen of the
exact size of the spar wanted, for it-loses its strength by
reducing it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>NATIVES OF NEW HOLLAND.</h4>
<br>
<p>The coasts of this continent, in proportion to its great
extent, are very thinly peopled,&mdash;a circumstance that is
perhaps occasioned by the enmity and warfare that exist between
the neighbouring tribes. Each tribe speaks a different language
from the other; and in a comparative vocabulary of the languages
of four different parts of the coast which I formed, the only one
of forty words that is similar in all is that for <i>the eye</i>.
Not thus dissimilar, however, are their weapons. The spear is
universal, as is also the throwing-stick; the <i>boomerang</i> or
<i>woodah</i>,&mdash;a short crescented weapon, which the natives
of Port Jackson project with accurate aim into a rotatory motion,
which gives a precalculated bias to its forcible fall,&mdash;was
also seen at Port Bowen on the east coast, and at Goulburn Island
on the north. Some of the natives have been described to use the
bow and arrow; but I have never seen any weapon like it among
them. The canoes of the several tribes differ both in
construction and material. In some parts, particularly about the
colony at Port Jackson, they are made of one piece of bark, tied
up at each end. Farther north, at the tropic, they are hollowed
out of the trunk of a soft-stemmed tree (erythrina indica), and
are so narrow as to require an outrigger to prevent their
oversetting. On the north coast they are made out of the bark of
trees,* neatly and firmly joined by strips of the stem of the
flagellaria indica, a small climbing plant. Farther to the
westward, at Hanover Bay, the natives cross the water upon a
raft, made of short logs of dead mangrove trees, which when
decayed are very buoyant. At Dampier's Archipelago, instead of a
canoe, the natives also use the decayed mangrove, but it is only
one log, on which "they sit astride, and move it along by
paddling with their hands, keeping their feet upon the end of the
log, by which they probably guide its course. Such are the shifts
to which the absence of large timber has reduced these simple
savages. They show that man is naturally a navigating animal; and
this floating log, which may be called the marine velocipede, is,
I should suppose, the extreme case of the poverty of savage
boat-building all over the world." ** MS. Journal.</p>
<p class="foot">[* So at Van Diemen's Land is the catamaran; and
Dr. Falconer (On Mankind! p. 287,) says, that the Canadian
savages form boats from the bark of trees, in which, however
fragile in appearance, they perform long
voyages.&mdash;<span class="u">Editor</span>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Their mode of fishing in the Red Sea is
somewhat strange. They throw in the water a part of the trunk of
the doomt-tree, perhaps ten or twelve feet long, at each end of
which is a piece of wood attached in a horizontal direction, so
as to prevent the tree from turning round. At one of the ends a
small pole is stuck upright to serve as a mast, on the top of
which there is a piece of wood horizontally fastened, as that
below. A woollen shawl thrown over it, and fastened at each end,
and to the piece of wood horizontally fixed below, forms a kind
of sail, and the two fishermen mount on the large trunk, like on
horseback, and by way of a cord attached to the middle of the
sail, they take the wind, more or less, as is
required."&mdash;<i>Belzoni's Researches in Egypt, and Nubia</i>,
p. 327.]</p>
<p>All the Indians that we have seen on the coast of New Holland
have long curly hair, which they dress in various fashions, and
often daub it over with the oil of the whale or the seal, by
which means it becomes clotted and entangled. Their bodies are
also smeared over with this oil, mixed with a red or white
pigment, which gives them not only a hideous appearance, but a
very disagreeable smell.</p>
<p>The natives of King George's Sound are the only Indians that
we have seen clothed; and these wear a mantle of kangaroo-skin
over their bodies, leaving the right arm only bare.</p>
<p>The spear-throwing-stick seems a universal weapon, except at
Van Diemen's Land; for we have seen it, although differently
shaped, in all parts of this continent, namely, on the south-east
coast, at Port Jackson, on the north-east coast at Endeavour
River, at Hanover and Vansittart Bays, on the north-west coast,
and on the south-west coast at King George's Sound.* The spears
also generally differ, and in many parts they are very large and
unwieldy. In the southern parts of New Holland, where the
grass-tree (xanthorrh&oelig;a hastile) grows, the spears are
generally made of its flower-stem; but where these plants are not
found, the natives make their spears of other trees, which are
hardened and straightened over a slow fire.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The natives of Pumice-stone River, Moreton
Bay, with whom, during our stay among them, we were on the most
friendly terms, and whose manners and customs we had uncommonly
favourable opportunities of observing, form (I believe) another
exception; for among them we never saw the throwing-stick; and
when shown to them by our Port Jackson native, their attempts to
use it were extremely clumsy. Nor did they make use of any
contrivance in lieu of it, but invariably threw their spears from
the hand.&mdash;<span class="u">J. Uniacke</span>.]</p>
<p>The savages are very careless and indifferent about presents,
excepting in those parts where they are accustomed to be visited;
and in some places they have shown themselves neglectful of
knives or axes, even after the use of these instruments has been
explained to them; and whereas in other parts they have evinced a
great desire to possess those obvious improvements upon sharp
stones or shells.** Articles of dress they justly despise, on
account of the warmth of their climate; but at King George's
Sound they were happy to receive any thing which they could use
as clothing. The demand, however, at this place is only of late
date; for Captain Flinders found all his presents to these very
people thrown away, and left upon the bushes near his tents.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Ferrum est quod amant</i>, is the
universal character of savages; but the natives of the Marquesas
long neglected our iron tools, and they belong to 'the same race
as the Friendly and Society Islands. See London Missionary
Voyage, pp. 134, 135. So the natives of Navigator's Islands would
barter with La Pérouse for nothing but beads. See his Voyage,
chapters xxiii, xxiv, and xxv.&mdash;<span class=
"u">Editor</span>.]</p>
<p>These are all the observations which I have had time to make
before my departure from the colony; but I trust that, upon the
publication of my charts and journals, I shall have an
opportunity of presenting the Society, on my return hither, with
a more detailed and satisfactory paper.</p>

<big>THE RIVERS,</big><br>
<br>
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">That</span> the two principal interior rivers
of New South Wales, namely the Lachlan and the Macquarie, should
both terminate in swamps or shoal lakes, instead of finding their
way to the sea, has caused as justly the surprise of the physical
geographer, as the disappointment of the political economist. The
river Lachlan is, with its sinuosities, the longer of the two,
and yet it does not receive a single auxiliary stream, after it
issues from the mountains, whence it has its source. The
Macquarie, in the first place, is formed by the union of the
Campbell and the Fish Rivers, and is fed in its course by five or
six others; and, although the Campbell can never lay claim to the
"very considerable magnitude" that Governor Macquarie assigns to
it,<a name="FNanchor_11_1" id="FNanchor_11_1"></a><a href=
"#fn11_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and although the river
Macquarie itself is scarcely so large as the Fish River, yet a
great body of water must run through them all somewhither; and
the Macquarie, at about the equal division of its course, is two
hundred feet wide. It is certainly very strange that all this
running water should end in a vast swamp. Yet a similar flatness
of country is found in South America, spreading the rains into
shallow lakes, which evaporate before they form rivers. Such is
the celebrated lake of Los Xarayes, in the vice-royalty of Buenos
Ayres, the length of which is sometimes three hundred and thirty
miles, and the breadth one hundred and twenty; but, although it
spreads over so large a space, it is not navigable in any part
except for canoes and small craft. So too the interior of North
America is filled with fresh-water lakes; and there are internal
seas, lakes, and marshes in Asia, as well as in Africa and
America.</p>
<p>The Lachlan, at about the equal division of its course,
instead of displaying its greatest size and vigour, like the
Macquarie, is lost in a marsh, as it is again at its termination;
so that there is very little probability that that river can ever
reach the sea. But the Macquarie was found to shoal suddenly, and
to spread unexpectedly, wherefore the sanguine have not yet given
up all hope of its ultimately finding its way to the sea-coast.
The country along, the banks of the Macquarie being chiefly good
pasture, our stock-keepers will, one day, ascertain whether there
is any channel out of the shoal-lake, in which Mr. Oxley found
that river to terminate, like the Niger, according to Major
Rennell. The Quarterly Review says, that "the circumstance of the
freshness of the water would decide the question of the
termination of the river in a mediterranean sea, or of its course
being resumed beyond the expanse of waters." There is no doubt of
the freshness of the lake. If it had been salt, Mr. Oxley would
have mentioned so singular a change from the waters of the river,
and a quality so different from the lakes of Wagara, in which the
Niger is supposed to terminate. How could the boat-party, which
was victualled for a month's voyage on the lake, have existed, if
the water had been salt? But I cannot agree with the Quarterly
Reviewer in his criterion, and am rather disposed to adopt the
theory of that great practical geographer, the Baron Humboldt, as
propounded in his Personal Narrative, even before the cases of
the Lachlan and the Macquarie were known to him: "It is probable
(says he) that in the lapse of ages, several rivers of Soudan and
of New Holland, which are now lost in the sands, or in inland
basins, will open themselves a way towards the shores of the
ocean. We cannot at least doubt, that in both continents there
are systems of interior rivers, which may be considered as not
entirely developed, and which communicate with each other, either
in the time of great risings, or by permanent
bifurcations."<a name="FNanchor_11_2" id=
"FNanchor_11_2"></a><a href="#fn11_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
This is no new theory: the Baron quotes it from Carl Ritter; and
it may be found in an excellent article on rivers, in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica.<a name="FNanchor_11_3" id=
"FNanchor_11_3"></a><a href="#fn11_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
"Herodotus, whom Strabo has not disdained to follow, relates a
tradition that Thessaly was originally one vast lake, without
visible outlet, till an earthquake, rending Olympus from Ossa,
formed the colony of Tempe."<a name="FNanchor_11_4" id=
"FNanchor_11_4"></a><a href="#fn11_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The Edinburgh Review says, "it does not appear why Mr. Oxley
turned back"; and this just after it has quoted the following
words of his Journal: "there was no channel whatever among the
ocean of reeds which surrounded us." Our associate, Mr. Oxley,
although his health is broken by these two long and unsuccessful
expeditions, which make such sport to Reviewers, is anxious to
see how the end of the Macquarie may look in a different season;
but economy is now the order of the day, and liberal science must
bend to national distress and political system. Yet I cannot help
thinking, that since money can be found for Arctic and African
explorations, and as Great Britain expended no less a sum than
34,296<i>l</i>. in making surveys of North America, the labour of
a few convicts and spare horses might still be afforded by the
Crown, to see what becomes of the last drop of its own singular
New Holland rivers, the Lachlan and the Macquarie,&mdash;alike in
their apparent terminations, but totally different in every other
character, not a single auxiliary stream falling into the former,
in a sluggish and winding course of four or five hundred miles,
whereas the latter is fed by half a dozen other rivers, and its
course is less winding: the one spending the rains in flooding a
barren country, instead of improving even its own channel; the
other running a wide and deep course, as long as its supplies
last, and "ever while it lives flowing between its banks", and
fertilising them, as a river should do.</p>
<p>Supposing the Lachlan to run to the nearest point of the sea,
namely at Cape Jervis on the south-west coast, it would give a
fall of only a foot and a third per mile for the whole river.
Supposing the Macquarie to find its shortest way, namely to near
Smoky Cape on the east coast, it would have more than two feet of
descent for every mile. One foot for every mile is as great a
descent as the Thames has for its last forty miles, and perhaps
for its whole course, taking the Isis to be two hundred feet
above the sea's level; and it is clearly shown in the
Encyclopædia Britannica, that the beds of rivers by no means form
themselves in one inclined plane, but that the continued track of
a river is a succession of inclined channels, whose slope
diminishes by steps, as the river approaches to the sea.<a name=
"FNanchor_11_5" id="FNanchor_11_5"></a><a href="#fn11_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> But Mr. Cunningham the botanist says he has
collected ample materials to demonstrate, that the river Lachlan
falls in a dip of inland country to the N.N.W. of the granitic
hills near Lake George, from which hills it rises, 1400 feet in
120 miles, which is nearly twelve feet per mile. The current of
the Macquarie Marshes (as the Edinburgh Review calls them) was
still northerly, and it is not probable that a river, the regular
course of which has been north-westerly for three hundred miles,
should suddenly turn due east;<a name="FNanchor_11_6" id=
"FNanchor_11_6"></a><a href="#fn11_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and Mr. Oxley (if we are to rely upon the Surveyor-General's
heights) makes the Macquarie fall 437 feet in little more than
fifty miles, namely, from near the head of the Fish River to
Bathurst; and 750 in about fifty miles, namely, from the head of
the Campbell to its junction with the Macquarie. Sir Thomas
Brisbane makes a fall of 1140 feet from the Fish branch to
Bathurst, which is impossible in a distance, of only thirty miles
without cataracts, and must be attributed to some error in using
the barometer. So that, as far as the fall of the Macquarie
waters has been ascertained, it is highly improbable that either
the Lachlan or the Macquarie should ever reach the ocean.</p>
<p>I have now before me a letter, which Mr. Oxley did me the
favour to address to me, dated from the banks of the Macquarie,
in lat. 31° 49' 40" S. and long. 147° 52' 15" E., a fortnight
before the river was dispersed, and many days before it gave any
symptoms of failing, which letter runs in these words:</p>
<p>"I was in great hopes that, at a distance of nearly 250 miles
from Bathurst, I should have been enabled to communicate to you
some certain information as to the termination of this river; but
I am just as much at a loss to conjecture it, as I was the day I
quitted Sydney. It has in no respect disappointed me as to its
continued magnitude and permanency, independently of rain; but
its course has been so much to the westward, that I have little
hopes it can find its way to any part of the east coast. My
present opinion, founded upon a careful examination of the
character of the country it waters, is, that it will terminate in
an interior sea; for such a stream, running, as it doubtless has
run, for ages, would of itself suffice to fill up any vacuum that
the sea-coasts of Australia surround."</p>
<p>I know not what is the least average fall that rivers running
into the sea require. Great rivers will have a gentle motion, in
spite of the obstructions of viscidity, adhesion, and friction,
by an almost imperceptible declivity. According to Azara,<a name=
"FNanchor_11_7" id="FNanchor_11_7"></a><a href="#fn11_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> the great river Paraguay does not fall a foot
per geographical mile of latitude, between the parallels of 16°
24' and 22° 57' S. Humboldt found the fall of the Apure and the
Lower Oronooko, from San Fernando to the Boca de Navios, only
three inches and a quarter to a nautical mile. The Apure itself
has a slope of thirteen inches to a mile, and the average descent
of the bed of the whole Oronooko is thirteen inches to the mile
of 950 toises (6 feet 4.376 inches per toise<a name=
"FNanchor_11_8" id="FNanchor_11_8"></a><a href="#fn11_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a>). The Ganges was found by Mr. Hastings, in a
course of sixty miles, to fall only four inches to a mile,
although the mean swiftness of that river is, in seasons of
drought, three miles an hour, and in those of rains six or
eight.<a name="FNanchor_11_9" id="FNanchor_11_9"></a><a href=
"#fn11_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> La Condamine and Major Rennel
suppose the mean descent of the Amazon and the Ganges scarcely
four or five inches to the mile, which is about equal to that of
the Mississippi, according to the most satisfactory estimates Dr.
James had been able to make.<a name="FNanchor_11_10" id=
"FNanchor_11_10"></a><a href="#fn11_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Major Long states 450 feet as the altitude of the head of the
Illinois above the ocean, which gives that river and the
Mississippi, into which it fells, a somewhat greater
descent.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href=
"#fn11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And the Mississippi,
according to Mr. Schoolcraft,<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id=
"FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#fn11_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
has an average descent of a little more than five inches to a
mile, although the Quarterly Review thinks this considerably
over-estimated. The average descent of the Ohio, which also falls
into the Mississippi, is nine inches per mile, as estimated by
Dr. Drake of Cincinnati.<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id=
"FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#fn11_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
The descent of the Nile, from Cairo to Rosetta, a distance of
fifty-nine leagues, is only four inches in a league.<a name=
"FNanchor_11_14" id="FNanchor_11_14"></a><a href="#fn11_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The head of the Volga, a river which is
2600 miles in length, is not more than 470 feet above the surface
of the ocean, but then it falls into the Caspian Sea, which is
306 feet below the level of the ocean; so that, if the Lachlan
and the Macquarie should ultimately end in large interior
salt-lakes, there is no saying how small an elevation, from the
ocean level, the rivers need have. Mr. Oxley had not the means of
measuring the height of the rivers either during their courses,
or at their apparent terminations&mdash;only at their
heads,&mdash;the Macquarie giving 2669, and the Lachlan 600 feet;
but another expedition, barometrically appointed, would perhaps
set the question at rest, whether these rivers, from their
heights above the surface of the ocean, can possibly fall into
the main sea.</p>
<p>If Government decline the honour of these discoveries, some
private individual will run away with it, as was the case with
the passage across the Blue Mountains; for, in spite of its want
of navigable rivers, New Holland seems destined to be one day a
great pastoral country; and cattle have a most insatiable
curiosity after</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; fresh
woods and pastures new."</p>

"#FNanchor_11_3">[3]</a> "The tracts of country, which are but
newly inhabited by man, such as great part of America, and the
newly-discovered regions of Terra Australis, are still almost
occupied by marshes and lakes, or covered with impenetrable
forests; and they would remain long enough in this state, if
population, continually increasing, did not increase: industry,
and multiply the hands of cultivators, along with their
necessities. The Author of Nature was alone able to form the
ridges of mountains, to model the hillocks and the valleys, to
mark out the courses of great rivers, and give 'the first trace
to every rivulet; but has left to man the task of draining his
own habitation, and the fields which are to support him, because
this is a task not beyond his powers. It was therefore of immense
advantage to him, that those parts of the globe into which he has
not yet penetrated, should remain covered with lakes, marshes,
and forests, which keep in store the juices of the earth, which
the influence of the air, and the vivifying warmth of the sun,
would have expended long ere now in useless vegetation, and which
the rains of heaven would have swept into the sea, had they not
been thus protected by their situation or their cover. It is
therefore the business of man to open up these mines of hoarded
wealth, and to thank the Author of all good, who has husbanded
them for his use, and left them as a rightful heritage for those
of after days. The earth had not, in the remote ages, as in our
days, those great canals, those capacious voiders, always ready
to drain off the rain-waters (of which only part is absorbed by
the thirsty ground), and the pure waters of the springs from the
foot of the hills. The rivers did not then exist, or were only in
torrents whose waters, confined by the gullies and glens, are
searching for a place to escape. Hence arise those numerous lakes
in the interior of great continents, of which there are still
remarkable relics in North America, which in process of time will
disappear and become champaign countries. The most remote from
the sea, unable to contain its waters, finds an issue through
some gorge of the hills, and pours over its superfluous waters
into a lower basin, which, in its turn, discharges its contents
into another; and the last of the chain delivers its waters by a
river into the ocean. The communication was originally begun by a
simple overflowing at the lowest part of the margin. This made a
torrent, which quickly deepened its bed; and this circumstance,
increasing its velocity, would extend this deepening back to the
lake, and draw off more of its waters. The work would go on
rapidly at first, while earth and small stones only resisted the
labours of nature; but these being washed away, and the channel
hollowed out to the firm rock on all sides, the operation must go
on very slowly, till the immense cascade shall undermine what it
cannot break off, and then a new discharge will commence, and a
quantity of flat ground will emerge all round the lake. The
torrent, in the meantime, makes its way down the country, and
digs a canal, which may be called the first sketch of a river,
which will deepen and widen its bed continually. The water of
several basins, united and running together in a great body, will
have a much greater velocity with the same slope, than those of
the lakes in the interior part of the continent, and the sum of
them all united in the basin next the sea, after having broken
through its natural monad, will make a prodigious torrent, which
will dig for itself a bed, so much the deeper as it has more
slope and a greater body of waters. The formation of the first
valleys, by cutting open many springs, will add to the mass of
running waters, and contribute to drain off the waters of these
basins."</p>

time to time the velocity of the stream, and the extent of the
section in breadth and depth.&mdash;<i>Humboldt, Personal

Encyclopædia Britannica) what is the velocity of a river of which
yon tell him the breadth, the depth, and the declivity? If the
waters of our rivers, which are two, three, and four hundred feet
lower than their sources, ran with the velocity due to that

<p align="right"><small>H.M. Store-ship,
Dromedary,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
at sea, 26th June,
1821.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honourable Gentlemen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="a">In</span> compliance
with your instructions, bearing date 21st July, 1819, I beg leave
to state, that on my arrival, at Van Diemen's Land, in the River
Derwent, I took the earliest and every opportunity of inspecting
the different woods round Hobart Town, but could not find any
mahogany, cedar, or pine; nor could I find any person who had
seen any of these woods, within ten miles round that
district.</p>
<p>I found the stringy bark (eucalyptus [blank]) growing in great
abundance, and the best in quality of any timber that came under
my inspection, and most easy of access. It is a very hard,
straight-grained wood, and very durable, if cut from ten to
twenty inches in diameter. The greater part, above these
dimensions, is generally rotten at the heart. It grows from sixty
to seventy feet in height, and is used in the colony for
lower-masts and top-masts for small vessels, also for plank
quarter, and most excellent studding-sail booms for any vessels,
and for capstan-bars and hand-spikes. As it grows on land
belonging to the Crown, there will be no expense of purchase. The
whole expense will be that of cutting down and shipping: a cargo
of it, in my opinion, may be obtained in three months.</p>
<p>I found also the red (eucalyptus resinifera of Smith) and blue
gum (eucalyptus piperita of Smith), the Banksia, the black-butted
gum (eucalyptus [blank]), the iron-bark (eucalyptus [blank]), and
the beef-wood or oak (casuarina); but they are so scarce and hard
of access, and given to be rotten at the heart, that I make no
hesitation in saying, that none of these species of wood will
ever be of any use to the country for naval purposes.</p>
<p>Having examined the districts about the Derwent, the second
master and myself proceeded to Adventure Bay to inspect the
timber, having been informed that the cedar (of the cedreleæ,
allied to flindersia) and pine (podocarpus aspleniifolia of
Labillardière, qu. dacrydium? <i>Brown</i>) were growing there in
great abundance. But to our disappointment, after two days'
journey by land and water, and a walk of twelve miles through the
heart of the wood, we found no more than eight or nine trees of
the former and five or six of the latter, and those so difficult
to be obtained, that it would be necessary to make a road for
each tree before it could be got to the water's edge. We also
found the stringy bark here in great abundance, and of equal
quality to that of the Derwent, but with the same defect as the
before-mentioned trees.</p>
<p>The Huon River pine (dacrydium [blank]) is of most excellent
quality; but whether in abundance or no I could not ascertain, as
all the accounts I received, from the several persons to whom I
applied for information, were contradictory, except in this one
point, that the river was so shoal that none but small vessels
could get up it</p>
<p>After making inquiry and personal inspection, the
above-mentioned is all I could ascertain of the timber of Van
Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>On my arrival at Port Jackson. I proceeded in my inspection
info the different species of wood growing there, and which might
be of service, and found the stringy bark most abundant
throughout the colony&mdash;of good quality, and easy of access
in the districts about Liverpool, as it could be floated down the
river, and taken in at Botany Bay. The mahogany found here
(eucalyptus robusta?) is a very hard wood and heavy, but is very
scarce.</p>
<p>The blue gum is found in great plenty at Lane Cove, up the
Paramatta River, the place from whence the government at Sydney
is supplied with timber; and is also found at Middle Harbour, and
generally throughout the colony. It is a hard-grained heavy wood,
and is preferred to any other for the building of colonial
vessels, for timbers and plank. It grows from thirty to forty
feet in height, and from one to two in diameter.</p>
<p>The iron-bark is found in great abundance throughout the
colony, and not very difficult to be obtained and brought down
the river, from Liverpool. It is similar to the stringy bark as
to quality, and is used in the colony for pumps, two of which are
at this time in use on board the Dromedary. It grows from thirty
to forty feet in height, and from one to three in diameter.</p>
<p>The black-butted gum is found in Lane Cove and throughout the
colony. It is not a very hard wood, will float in the water, and
is used for the different purposes to which timber can be
applied. It is not very difficult to be obtained.</p>
<p>The box (eucalyptus [blank]) is found abundant throughout the
colony. It grows from twenty to thirty feet high, and from one to
four in diameter. It is used chiefly for railing: it is very
straight. The large trees are always rotten at the heart.</p>
<p>The beef-wood or oak is found at Lane Cove and Middle Harbour.
It is used in the colony for shingles, railing, and furniture;
but will never be of any service as to naval purposes. It grows
from ten to fifteen feet high, and from one to two in
diameter.</p>
<p>The cedar, which grows principally at Newcastle (Hunter's
River) and at the Five Islands, is generally allowed to be the
most valuable wood for inside work of ships and houses, of any
found in New South Wales. It grows from thirty to forty feet
high, and from one to three in diameter. It is brought from
Hunter's River and the Five Islands in small vessels, as the
navigation of these places, being difficult, will not admit large
ones.</p>
<p>The rose-Wood (of the meliaceæ&mdash;trichilia glandulosa?)
grows in the forests with the cedar, at Newcastle. It is very
hard, and much given to dry-rot It is ornamental, and fit for
furniture only. It resembles the English laurel.</p>
<p>The Hunter's River pine is rather a hard wood, and very much
given to dry-rot, and can be obtained in the same manner as
cedar.</p>
<p>The flooded gum (eucalyptus [blank]) is very lofty and
remarkably straight-grained, from two to three feet in diameter,
and fit for any kind of work either in ship or house-building. It
is to be found at Iron Cove, on the Paramatta River.</p>
<p>The white cedar (melia azedarach) is a very tough and
straight-grained wood; it is found at the Five Islands and Port
Stephens, and is fit for any purpose.</p>
<p>All the woods growing in New Holland are much given to the
heart-rot and shakes, on an average from six to ten.</p>

<p align="center"><big><i>DICOTYLEDONES.</i><br>
<br>
I. THYMELEÆ</big>, <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>The plants of this natural family, whose prevalence forms a
feature in the Flora of the Cape of Good Hope, constitute at
least ten distinct genera; and of these two only have been
observed upon our southern continent, viz. <i>Pimelea</i>, and
the European genus <i>Daphne</i>. Although some few of the
<i>Pimeleæ</i> have been discovered in the equinoctial portions
of Australia, the greater number have been found to exist in the
parallels of our colony and the southern parts of Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>1. <span class="a">Pimelea</span> <i>ligustrina,
Labillardière</i>.</p>
<p>A tall shrub, found in shaded subhumid situations. Banks of
the Fish River and ravines near Bathurst.</p>
<p>2. <span class="a">Pimelea</span> <i>linoides</i>, allied to
P. <i>linifolia, Smith</i>.</p>
<p>Involucris 4-phyllis: foliolis laté ovatis acutis glabris
capitulo subbrevioribus, perianthii tubo villosisissimo: ore
4-punctato, staminibus exsertis stylum subæquantibus, foliis,
oblongo-lanceolatis apicibus callosis obtusis internodio plus
duplo longioribus. Frequent in permanent bogs and margins of
cascades, on the Blue Mountains.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>II. PROTEACEÆ</big>, <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>It to a remarkable fact in the geography of plants, that
nearly the whole of this beautiful order is confined to the
southern hemisphere, where it is very extensively scattered,
without limitation to any particular latitude, <i>Embothrium</i>
having been found in the higher parallels of South America; and
with respect to situation, it does not simply exist on or near
the shores, at a moderate elevation above the sea, for some
plants have been traced to a perpendicular height of 4000 feet in
Van Diemen's Land; and to a species of the above-mentioned genus,
the Baron Humboldt has given its natural spot of growth a mean
height of 9300 feet above the level of the ocean.</p>
<p>The Australian part of this extensive order comprises at least
twenty-three distinct genera, of which only <i>Persoonia</i> and
<i>Cenarrhenes</i> (a genus of Labillardière, till very lately
imperfectly understood) produce drupaceous fruits, the remaining
larger portion bearing dry capsules, more or less woody.</p>
<p>To the species of the several genera already published by Mr.
Brown, many new plants, more recently discovered in the interior
of our continent, and particularly on its north-western shores
during the late voyages of Captain King, remain to be added; and
of any individual genus, <i>Grevillea</i> has received the most
considerable accession of unpublished species, belonging chiefly
to Mr. Brown's first and fourth sections, the one having
ecostated coriaceous folliculi, containing seeds winged only at
the apex, the other remarkable for its round woody capsules,
containing two orbicular seeds, winged quite round the margin,
"semina undique latiùs alata", as in the section
<i>Cycloptera</i> of Mr. Brown.</p>
<p>3. <span class="a">Hakea</span> <i>propinqua</i>.</p>
<p>Foliis filiformibus indivisis teretibus mucronatis fructu vix
æqualibus, capsulis subrotundis gibbosis obtusis nodosis,
perianthiis glabris, pedunculis incanis. A large shrub, at about
eighteen miles on the Blue Mountains. This species is nearly
allied to H. <i>nodosa, Brown</i>.</p>
<p>4. <span class="a">Hakea</span> <i>microcarpa, Brown</i>.</p>
<p>This species, which was originally discovered on the banks of
rivers in Van Diemen's Land, is very frequent, from Cox's River
to a very considerable distance around the settlement of
Bathurst.</p>
<p>5. <span class="a">Grevillia</span> <i>rosmarinifolia</i>.</p>
<p>Foliis linearibus strictis acutis mucronatis: margine

Cox's River. Collected on Mr. Oxley's first expedition in
1817.</p>

hills, country north of Bathurst. Flowers in December</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>III. DIOSMEÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>This natural family, which originally formed a section of M.
Jussieu's <i>Rutaceæ</i>, until it was defined as a distinct
order by Mr. Brown, is a tribe of plants, which, from several
striking points of character, uniform in every genus of the
order, as well as from its geographical extent (chiefly indeed in
the extra-tropical regions of this continent) forms a peculiar
feature in the vegetation of Terra Australis. The genera of the
colony are seven, viz. <i>Boronia, Corræa, Eriostemon, Phebalium,
Zieria, Crowea</i>, and <i>Philotheca</i> of Rudge, which last
scarcely appears generically distinct from Eriostemon. Of all
these (<i>Crowea</i> and <i>Philotheca</i> excepted) Port Jackson
furnishes the botanist with several species, even yet for the
most part unpublished.</p>
<p>10. <span class="a">Zieria</span> <i>abcordata</i>.</p>

handsome shrub, found in bare rocky situations. Blackheath, Blue
Mountains.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>IV. LABIATÆ,</big> <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>I have already observed, in a report upon the herbaria formed
during Captain King's respective voyages, and transmitted by me
to England, that the mass of this and another order
(<i>Verbenaceæ</i>) very nearly allied to it, seems, in
Australia, to exist on its eastern shores, within and beyond the
tropic; and that the species in those herbaria are referable to
ten well-established genera. Among these <i>Premna</i> and
<i>Vitex</i> are most remarkable on the north-west coast.</p>
<p>Of the European portion of <i>Labiatæ</i>, also indigenous to
our colony, are to be found six remarkable genera of plants,
confined indeed to Terra Australis, whose characters are formed
from the structure of the antheræ, in some of which these organs
are in part barren and defective, whilst in <i>Prostanthera</i>
each has a calcarated appendage.</p>
<p>18. <span class="a">Prostanthera</span> <i>linearis,
Brown</i>. Margins of shaded woods, Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>19. P. <i>violacea, Br</i>. Blue Mountains.</p>

Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>21. P. <i>denticulata, Br</i>. Pine Hills near Bathurst.</p>
<p>22. <span class="a">Westringia</span> <i>angustifolia, Br</i>.
A suffruticose plant, growing with the preceding.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>V. SCROPHULARINÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>The plants of this order are inhabitants of the alpine regions
of the higher latitudes of Europe, as well as of the shores of
every country within the tropics which has been visited by the
botanist. Several Linnæan genera of this order exist in the
equinoctial parts of Australia, as also at the southern extremes
of Van Diemen's Land, where a species of the genus
<i>Euphrasia</i> is traced to the summits of its highest
mountains.</p>
<p>The order is divided into two sections, comprehending species
having two or four antheriferous stamens.</p>

<p>The <i>Solanaceæ</i> have been characterised by a plicated
monopetalous corolla, having as many stamens (generally five) as
there are divisions of that floral envelope; nor was it until M.
J.J. Labillardière, the naturalist who accompanied General
D'Entrecasteaux, had discovered his <i>Anthocercis</i>, upon the
south-western shores of this continent, that there existed any
deviation from a corresponding number of the respective parts of
the fructification of any genus of the order. The didynamous
stamens, with the bare rudiment of a fifth, together with the
form of the embryo, now constitute a section of the order of
which the genera appear to be limited to our Australian
continent.</p>

<p align="center"><big>VII. TREMANDREÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>A small order in Terra Australis, consisting of two genera of
plants only, the one proposed by Mr. Brown, under the title of
<i>Tremandra</i> (being the type of this little family) and Sir
J.E. Smith's long-established <i>Tetratheca</i>, remarkable for
the terminal bursting of the four distinct cells of its
antheræ.</p>

<p>Foliis quinatis senisve verticillatis linearibus falcatis

declivities, Blue Mountains.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>VIII. MAGNOLIACEÆ,</big>
<i>Decandolle</i>.</p>
<p>This important family was first considered, by Mr. Salisbury,
as distinct from the <i>Dillenaceæ</i>, with which it had been
till recently associated, in the ternary disposition of the
several parts of the flower, as well as the want of astringency
in its bark, which is highly aromatic and stimulant; and although
M. Decandolle has adopted this separation, it was Mr. Brown who
clearly defined the extent and affinities of the two
families.</p>
<p>The family of <i>Magnoliaceæ</i>, although extensive in Asia
and America, is limited to two plants in Terra Australis, named
in honour of the Dutch voyager Tasman, the one a native of our
colony, and the other of the southern extremity of Van Diemen's
Land (which he first discovered), where it occupies the place of
the celebrated Winter's-bark, (<span class="a">Wintera</span>

America.</p>

<p align="center"><big>IX. POLYGALEÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Polygaleæ</i> are limited in Terra Australis to three
genera, of which M. Labillardière's genus <i>Comesperma</i> is
the most striking; differing from <i>Polygala</i> of Linnæus and
other authors, in the shape of the capsule, and the tufted
villous appendages attached to the seed.</p>

<p>M. Decandolle, in his learned enumeration of the species of
this family, has divided it into two tribes differing from each
other, in the apices of the filaments being dilated to receive
the antheræ, or narrow, and even sub-attenuated; as well as in
the shape of these organs. To that section, with simple stamens,
therefore, the Australian portion of the order has been referred,
whose number is no less than seventy, of which the greater part
exists in various exposed situations of our colony, and
constitutes three genera.</p>

<p align="center"><big>XI. EPACRIDEÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>Upon comparing the floras of countries lying in the same
parallel, it is interesting to observe in several families of two
distant continents, so situated, a striking affinity and even an
identity of genera, common to both. Where, however, the same
genera have not been met with, in two widely divided countries,
situated in the same latitude, the place of a tribe abundant in
the one is often occupied by another equally extensive family,
having a striking affinity to each other, not only in the
structure of their respective parts of fructification, but also
in the physiology and physical properties of the vegetables
themselves. Thus the Cape of Good Hope (in the parallel of Port
Jackson) affords in its <i>heaths</i> (properly so termed) a
striking as well as a beautiful feature in the flora of the
southern extremity of the African continent; and although the
genus Erica does not exist in Terra Australis, the extensive
family named <i>Epacrideæ</i> (recently so constituted), which
has been referred to the <i>Ericoideæ</i> by Jussieu, forms a
numerous and nearly-related substitute, occupying a large space
in our colonial flora.</p>
<p>Exclusive of several unpublished plants of recent discovery,
nearly one hundred and forty species of this order (which are
remarkable for the harsh dry nature of their foliage) have been
described by Mr. Brown, two-thirds of which bear drupaceous
fruits, containing a definite number of seeds, and hence
constitute a section of the family named <i>Stypheleæ</i>, whose
maximum is, with the capsular fruited division (the
<i>Epacrideæ</i> properly so denominated), in the parallel of our
colony. The whole tribe is, with the exception of two plants in
the Banksian Herbarium, which are natives of the Sandwich
Islands, entirely confined to the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p align="center"><big>XII. LEGUMINOSÆ,</big> <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown has considered this order, from its extent and wide
distribution in almost every country, as a grand class, divisible
into at least three principal families; viz. The <i>Mimoseæ</i>,
as left by Linnæus, now constituting several genera: the
<i>Lomentaceæ</i>, and the <i>Papilionaceæ</i>, the last being in
part decandrous, or having ten stamens distinct from each other,
and in part diadelphous, with filaments united at their base.</p>
<p align="center">1. <i>Mimoseæ</i>.</p>
<p>This leading division of the <i>Leguminosæ</i> is so extremely
abundant in Terra Australis, as to give a peculiar character to
the vegetation. They belong almost wholly to the genus
<i>Acacia</i>, as formed by Professor Willdenow, are mostly
aphyllous, and generally diffused over every part of the
continent that has been examined. A few, indeed, appear to be
limited to solitary spots on the north-western shores, and no one
species has been remarked so general, as to be common to opposite
coasts. Already have upwards of 130 very distinct species been
discovered, most of which are unpublished. These cannot be well
defined in any Monograph upon the family, unless reduced to
sections, characterized by the shape of the foliaceous petioles
(at present termed <i>leaves</i> by botanists), the capitular or
cylindrical inflorescence, and the form of the pod.</p>

forming, in <i>Eucalyptus</i> and the genera immediately related
to it, four fifths of the forests; but, although so generally
diffused, it is remarkable that they are scarcely to be found
beyond it. The colony of Port Jackson, and the southern
settlements in Van Diemen's Land, appear not only to produce the
greater number of the several species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, but
also considerably larger timber, than the equinoctial parts of
the continent, where (at least on the east coast) a permanent

<p>The greater portion of <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>, which are very
numerous, exist in India and the equinoctial parts of America,
nor is the order wanting in Terra Australis, nearly one hundred
species barring been remarked, for the meet part on shores within
the tropics. Some genera, however, peculiar to this country are
natives of the colony of Port Jackson, where the Linnæan genus
<i>Croton</i> is indigenous.</p>
<p>86. <span class="a">Croton</span> <i>urticoides</i>.</p>
Dioicum, stellato-tomentosum, foliis lanceolato-cordatis
sublobatis inequaliter serratis subtùs mollibus, racemis

Rivers.
<p>87. <span class="a">Croton</span> <i>rosmarinifolium</i>.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><big>XIX. PRIMULACEÆ,</big>
<i>Ventenat</i>.</p>
<p>This European order is limited to six plants in Terra
Australis, referable to three Linnæan genera, of which
<i>Samolus</i> is abundant on the sands of all its shores.</p>
<p><i>Samolus</i>, although it is allied to the <i>Primula</i>
family, differs nevertheless in the position of the ovarium and
seeds, as well as in the abortive character of one half of its
stamina, which are ten in number.</p>
<p>88. <span class="a">Samolus</span> <i>littoralis, Brown</i>.

<br>
<p align="center"><big>XX. STACKHOUSEÆ,</big> <i>Brown</i>.</p>
<p>This very small family, which consists of two genera (one of
which still remains unpublished), was formed by Mr. Brown, upon
Sir J.E. Smith's genus <i>Stackhousia</i>, long since announced
to botanists in the 4th vol. of the Linnæan Transactions. The
<i>Stackhouseæ</i> are peculiar to our Australian continent, over
which (as far as has been explored) they are sparingly scattered,
being more frequent in the vicinity of the colony.</p>

<p align="center"><big>XXI. CARYOPHYLLEÆ,</big>
<i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>Almost every country beyond the tropic of Cancer in the
northern hemisphere abounds in the several genera of this very
extensive class of plants, which M. Jussieu has arranged under
seven sections, characterized by the number of their stamens and
styles.</p>
<p>In the southern hemisphere, the order appears to exist only in
about four of the genera of Europe, and these seem to be limited
each to a solitary species.</p>

species, viz. Linum angustifolium.&mdash;<span class=

<br>
<p align="center"><big>XXII. ROSACEÆ,</big> <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>This order, which has lately been very judiciously relieved by
Mr. Lindley of one of its sections as left by Jussieu,
<i>Pomaceæ</i> being constituted a separate order, is but barely
represented in Australia; the following species, with three or
four of <i>Rubus</i>, being the only plants of the order whose
indigenous existence I am aware of.</p>
<p>91. <span class="a">Acæna</span> <i>ovina</i>.</p>
<p>Incano-hirsuta, foliolis profundè incisis pinnatifidis;
laciniis oblongis obtusis, spicis oblongis; inferioribus

lands, Bathurst, &amp;c.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>XXIII. UMBELLIFERÆ,</big>
<i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>This natural family appears to occupy portions of every
country in the temperate climates of the northern hemisphere.
Those genera which have been remarked in our southern regions are
very few, and found to deviate most remarkably from the usual
structure of the order, hence constituting genera peculiar to the
country.</p>
<p>92. <span class="a">Eryngium</span> <i>ovinum</i>.</p>
<p>Foliis bipinnatifidis; laciniis linearibus spinoso-rigidis

Plains at Bathurst, &amp;c.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><big>XXIV. COMPOSITÆ,</big> <i>Jussieu</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Compositæ</i>, like the preceding order, has its
maximum in Europe, although about 800 species have already been
discovered in Terra Australis, being about one-eighth of the
number that has been described of the family generally. In our
colony, as well as in Van Diemen's Land, the most interesting
genera are <i>Aster, Bellis, Calotis, Cassinia, Cacalia</i>, and
<i>Eupatorium</i>, four of which are frequent also in Europe,
<i>Calotis</i> and <i>Cassinia</i> being peculiar to New South
Wales.</p>
<p>93. <span class="a">Elichrysum</span> <i>albicans</i>.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><big>XXVI. ORCHIDEÆ,</big> <i>Juss. and
Br</i>.</p>
<p>It is singular that the parasitical portion of this beautiful
family, which abounds in every country within the tropic, on the
continents of Asia, Africa, and America, should exist so
extremely sparingly in that of Terra Australis, whose extent
within that circle exceeds 700 miles of latitude. The
observations, however derived from two years' experience in South
America, upon these sumptuous plants, so far as regards their
habits and situations of growth, enable me in some degree to
account for their partial existence upon our north-west coast. On
those shores generally it may be attributed to their geological
structure, to the absence of primary mountains, or land above an
ordinary elevation, and hence to the absence of lofty dense
forests. These are necessary to that shade and permanent
atmospheric moisture, which constitute essential requisites to
the existence of almost the whole of the tribe.</p>
<p>The terrestrial part of the order may, indeed, be considered
of rather rare occurrence, and the individuals of which they are
composed are seldom found abundantly in one spot. Yet we reckon
about 100 species, the maximum of which have been observed in the
colony and Van Diemen's Land, and constitute genera peculiar to
our continent.</p>

<p>P.S. As a supplement to the foregoing "Specimen" of the botany
of Bathurst, I have great pleasure in being able to give an
account of a new and highly interesting plant of the natural
order <i>Bignoniaceæ</i>, which was discovered by me towards the
close of the year 1823, in the Blue Mountains. The exact habitat
is among shady forests, abounding in the tree-ferns (<i>Dicksonia
antarctica</i>, Labill. **), about twenty-two miles from the
entrance of the new route which has recently been traced out by
Mr. Bell, junr.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This beautiful tree-fern, which was
originally discovered at the southern extremity of Van Diemen's
Island, where alone it has hitherto been observed, I found also
very general in the dark forests on the mountain named by the
Aborigines Tomah, which is distant from the Hawkesbury ford, at
Richmond, about twenty miles. Some of the caudices or trunks of
these trees are thirty-five feet in height, and measure from
twelve to sixteen inches in diameter at their base. The
stupendous size and extraordinary windings of the climbers within
these shades, particularly a cissus with quinate leaves, whose
supple stems measured from twenty to twenty-four inches in the
circumference, the weight of parasitical orchideæ, filices,
&amp;c. borne by them, as they swing to the violent winds of
these elevated lands, added to the grandeur and magnificent
appearance of the tree-ferns, failed not to picture to me and
impress me with that exuberance of tropical scenery, which in New
South Wales is occasionally to be observed in the higher
latitudes (particularly at the Five Islands). Upon entering the
dark shades of these forests, the traveller is forcibly struck
with the change of appearance of the timbers, from the eucalypti
of the open country, to species of other genera not to be found
in situations of dry exposure.]</p>
<p>The plant in question appears to constitute a new genus of the
older <i>Bignoniaceæ</i>; and from the circumstance of its having
a berried fruit, it belongs to the division "fractu baccato", and
consequently ranges near to <i>Mitraria</i> of Cavanilles.</p>
<p>The name now proposed for the genus is intended to commemorate
that of a gentleman who has, in his judicial capacity, much aided
the advancement of the colony of New South Wales to its present
flourishing state; and whose important researches there, in
various branches of physical science, will materially tend to
confer that interest upon our distant settlement which it so
richly deserves, and which yet remains in a great measure to be
appreciated.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p>22d <i>May</i>, 1823. Set out in company with Brigade-Major
Ovens from Bong Bong (Mr. Throsby's farm), taking with us Joseph
Wild (a constable of the district of Argyle, well known as a
bushman on similar excursions to the one we were about to take),
for the purpose of showing us the way to Lake George; and as he
was also known and much respected by the natives, we considered
he would be an useful attendant beyond the hitherto explored part
of the country. Towards evening crossed the Wollondilly River,
where we halted for the night&mdash;distance twenty miles. Fine
clear weather&mdash;wind west. Passed through a country partly
brush and partly forest.</p>
<p>23d. Weather cloudy. Passed Messrs. H. and C. M'Arthur's
stock-station. Diverged from the road to visit the Sugarloaf
Rocks&mdash;a curious mass, which, although perfectly firm, has
the appearance of heaps of small stones resembling worn gravel.
Crossed the Cookbundoon River twice; and rested for the night in
a barren brush at the foot of the range of mountains bearing the
same name. Distance sixteen miles. Weather squally&mdash;hail,
snow, and rain. Wind SW.</p>

<p>24th. Heavy squalls of wind, with occasional snow during the
night. At daylight, fine weather with sharp frost Therm, at 10
<i>a.m.</i>, on the top of Cookbundoon Range, 34°. Passed through
a barren country, and encamped at Mulwarry, the commencement of
Goulburn Plains, after again crossing the Wollondilly. Distance
fifteen miles. Wind SW. At sunset moderate.</p>
<p>25th. At daylight drizzling rain. Wind west At noon in the
middle of Goulburn Plains. Passed over Goulburn Plains, twelve
miles in extent; but they should rather be called downs than
plains. Soil partially good and bad&mdash;white flint-stone and
granite in places. Encamped for the night about four miles to the
SW. of the plains. Distance twenty miles. Wind still westerly,
and weather unsettled.</p>
<p>26th. Cloudy at daylight. Wind west. At noon drizzling rain.
Passed up a valley by a chain of ponds for about five miles,
leaving behind the last and most distant stock-station from
Sydney in this direction, and then through gulleys and over stony
ranges to Lake George, where we encamped on the banks of a creek
for the night. Killed three emues on a plain near the lake, which
afforded excellent coursing, equal if not surpassing the same
sport with the hare in England; and which were very acceptable,
for having calculated on them and kangaroos, as the principal
part of our food, and the whole of that of our greyhounds, we had
provided ourselves with but little salt meat; flour for the
purpose of making what are termed <i>dampers</i> (<i>i.e</i>. a
flat cake, being merely a mixture of flour and water, baked in
wood ashes) forming our chief stock. Distance sixteen miles. Wind
still west, and blowing very hard.</p>
<p>27th. Raining hard at daylight, which continuing with great
perversity at 10 <i>a.m.</i>, and promising to last throughout
the day, induced us to remain stationary. Sent the cart back, it
being impossible, from the trackless and mountainous state of the
country, for it to proceed further, and we being provided with
three pack-horses to carry our provisions and the trifling
luggage we had with us. Latitude of this encampment (which is on
the east bank of the lake about eleven miles north of the south
end) by sun's meridian altitude, 35° 6' 1" south. Both uplands
and meadows on this side of Lake George very rotten, and riding
bad. Killed two emues and three ducks. Saw an immense quantity of
the latter, and black swans, on a lagoon near the lake. Sunset
fine; wind still westerly.</p>
<p>28th. At daylight rain&mdash;detained all day by the rain.
Ceased raining at sunset.</p>
<p>29th. Pine weather at daylight. Longitude of our encampment,
by chronometer (the rate of which owing to our detention I have
been enabled to ascertain on the spot with its accustomed
exercise in the pocket) and simple altitude, 149° 46 21" east
from Greenwich, bring 0<sup><small>h</small></sup>
5<sup><small>m</small></sup> 50<sup><small>s</small></sup>,6 or
1° 27' 39" west from the government-house at Sydney, which
differs somewhat from that assigned to the same spot by Mr.
Oxley; but as his is probably (from various circumstances) nearer
the truth, I have retained his position of Lake George on my
sketch of this tour. Proceeded on our journey. In crossing the
creek on which we had encamped, one of our pack-horses was nearly
drowned, owing to the bottom being soft: he became frightened,
and fell on his ride: another was afterwards bogged. Passed
through a rotten, boggy country to the SE. corner of the lake,
making about a SSE. course ten miles. Whole distance about
fifteen miles. Wind west</p>
<p>30th. At daylight fine weather&mdash;calm&mdash;sharp white
frost. Passed through an inferior country, a little to the
southward of the lake, and by a considerable
plain&mdash;afterwards over stony ranges. Sew an extensive plain
to the southward, and the Morumbidgee Mountains to the SW.
partially covered with snow. Made about SW. fifteen miles, but
from our zig-zag track in all about twenty miles.</p>
<p>31st. Cloudy with small rain. Passed through an indifferent
country and over stony ranges, and encamped by the side of the
South Fish River (as called by our attendant Joseph Wild), on the
edge of Lime-stone Plains, having crossed that river about three
miles east of the plains. Killed two kangaroos on the way with
the greyhounds, but they did not show so good a course as the
emues, neither are they such good eating. At 8 p.m. cloudy. Made
about west ten miles&mdash;in all about fifteen.</p>
<p>1st <i>June</i>. Daylight, foggy. Crossed Lime-stone Plains,
and travelled through a fine forest country to a beautiful small
plain, which we named Isabella's Plain, after Miss Brisbane. It
is situated about six miles from the others S½W. per compass, on
the right bank of the Morumbidgee. Went up the bank of that river
four miles, searching for a crossing-place without success, in
doing which we passed through a fine forest country, and encamped
for the night on the right bank. Killed an emu. Made about SSW.
eighteen miles.</p>
<p>2d. At daylight, cloudy with showers of small rain. Passed
through a fine forest country, intersected by stony and lofty
ranges; in crossing one of which we observed, considerably to the
westward of us, a very singular and remarkable rock, of an oblong
form, standing erect and alone on the summit of another range.
Saw several pine-trees, of about two feet diameter, growing on
stony ranges. Encamped by a small run of water in a fine forest
vale, not being yet able to cross the Morumbidgee. Killed a
kangaroo. Made about south eight miles&mdash;in all eleven.
Latitude of this night's encampment, by meridian altitude of
Arcturus 35° 33' 12", and by moon's meridian altitude 35° 33' 13"
south.</p>
<p>3d. Fine weather at daylight. Passed through a forest country,
and near several stony ranges, to a rather extensive plain, which
proved to be the commencement of a very long chain of down
country. Crossed this plain, or rather these downs, and encamped
a little more than a mile beyond, on the bank of a gulley. Killed
an emu. Made about S½E. twelve miles, and SSW. one mile, but in
all about fifteen miles. Latitude by moon's meridian altitude 35°
44' 5" south.</p>
<p>4th. Foggy, with a sharp white frost. Passed through a chain
of clear downs to some very extensive ones, where we met a tribe
of natives, who fled at our approach, never (as we learned
afterwards) having seen Europeans before; however, we soon by
tokens of kindness, offering them biscuits, &amp;c. together with
the assistance of a domesticated native of our party, induced
them to come nearer and nearer, till by degrees we ultimately
became very good friends; but on no account would they touch or
approach our horses, of which they were from the first much more
frightened than of ourselves. From these natives we learned that
the clear country before us was called Monaroe, which they
described as very extensive: this country we named Brisbane Downs
after (and subsequently by permission of) his Excellency the
Governor. The toil was of various sorts, some good and some
indifferent&mdash;the hills for the most part stony. The country
is tolerably well watered. Made about S. by W. ten miles.</p>
<p>5th. Foggy at daylight. Proceeded along the Morumbidgee to a
convenient resting-place on its right bank. Killed an emu. Rode
to the top of a hill, and observed a continuation of downs to the
southward clear of timber, Made about S.E. by E. four
miles&mdash;in all six. Found lime-stone and iron-stone where we
encamped, the fount in great abundance.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is in about this meridian, that limestone
has also been discovered in latitudes 31° 15', 32° 20', 32° 30',
32° 48', 33° 12' and 33° 35'.&mdash;<span class=
"u">Editor</span>.]</p>
<p>6th. Crossed the Morumbidgee. Rode to the southward and
observed the same sort of down country to a very considerable
extent, say, forty miles to the southward of our encampment,
bounded on the west by the snowy range of mountains, and on the
east by what may probably turn out (when the country hereafter is
more explored and better known) to be the coast range of
mountains. Found iron-stone in considerable quantities in the
neighbourhood of the lime-stone. Caught a considerable quantity
of fish in the river, resembling the rock-cod of Port Jackson.
Found bullrushes growing on the banks of the river. Day very
fine. Latitude, of encampment by sun's meridian altitude 35° 58'
40" south, and longitude by chronometer 149° 7' 10" east from
Greenwich, and 0<sup><small>h</small></sup>
8<sup><small>m</small></sup> 14<sup><small>s</small></sup>,6, or
2° 3' 39" west from the government-house at Sydney, which I feel
satisfied is not very wide of the truth, and which will place the
northern part of these downs from Port Jackson, south 39° 15'
west, 164 nautical miles. We now regretted much that our
provision had become so short as to preclude the possibility of
our penetrating further south, to ascertain the real extent of
the country before us, which we were naturally anxious to do,
from its interesting nature connected with the subject of
sheep-grazing, so essential to the staple produce of the colony.
That these downs are very considerably elevated above the level
of the sea I have no doubt, and can only regret an accident which
prevented Sir Thomas Brisbane's lending me a barometer, whereby
that point might have been set at rest.</p>
<p>7th. Hazy morning. Set out (on our return) intending to pass
by Lake Bathurst, and persuaded one of the natives to accompany
us to show us the way; but he left us in the night, when we had
encamped, which we did about four miles to the south of where we
lay on 3d June. Distance twenty miles.</p>
<p>8th. Hazy at daylight. Shot four ducks. Proceeded still on our
old track; but about half-past 10 <i>a.m.</i> we were fortunate
enough to fall in with two natives, who, like the others we had
met, were much frightened; indeed more so than those, for they
fled like deer the instant they saw us, and being pursued by us
on horseback, ran with great agility to the tops of trees, whence
it required no small degree of persuasion to remove them; but
succeeding at last in getting them down, we compelled one of them
to go with us to show us the way to Lake Bathurst, they being
invariably well acquainted with the best passes in the
hills&mdash;the other returned to his tribe not far off in the
bush; Passed through a fine forest country, and some scrub, but
all well watered, and tolerably good soil. Met with large rocks
of limestone. In one place the rock formed a natural bridge of
one perfect Saxon arch, under which the water passed. Encamped
for the night on the banks of a run of water, which we supposed
to be the rise of the South Fish River. Made about eighteen miles
NNE.</p>
<p>9th. At daylight, small rain. Passed through a little scrub
and some fine forest country, but had innumerable gulleys to
encounter near the South Fish River, on which we eventually
encamped close to the place where we crossed it in our outward
journey. The native, whom we pressed yesterday, contrived to slip
away from us, in coming over one of the steep hills. Wind NW.
fresh. Made fifteen miles.</p>
<p>10th. At daylight, white frost. Passed over a fine
forest-country bounded by stony ranges, to the sooth end of Lake
George. Killed a kangaroo and two emues. Made about NE. eighteen
miles.</p>
<p>11th. At daylight slight frost. Passed through a rotten forest
country to the Mulwarry Creek. It is worthy of remark that all
the country about Lake George, and between it and Lake Bathurst,
is very rotten, making the riding bad, and unsafe for
pack-horses. Distance eighteen miles.</p>
<p>12th. Cloudy at daylight&mdash;sharp white frost. Reached
Goulburn Plains, and encamped on the same spot as we did going
out. At noon, rain. At sunset, heavy rain and strong wind from the
west. Distance twenty-four miles.</p>
<p>13th. At daylight rain. At 8 <i>a.m.</i> it cleared up, when
we proceeded and encamped to the west of Stony Range. Distance
twenty-six miles.</p>
<p>14th. Reached Bong Bong again, a distance of twenty-five
miles. Reckoning our present distance from Port Jackson at 83
miles, our outward journey hence at 197, and our homeward
hitherto at 164, our whole excursion will have been 527
miles.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>NARRATIVE OF A VOYAGE TO NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>
<hr class="2">
<p style="text-indent: 5%; margin-left: 25%; font-size: 90%;">
&mdash;&mdash; Quæ fuit durum pati,<br>
Meminisse dulce
est.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Seneca</i>.</p>
<p class="poem">The sullen passage of thy weary voyage<br>
Esteem a foil, wherein thou art to set<br>
The precious jewel of thy
home-return.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">It</span> was on the 28th day of August, 1816,
that I embarked at Gravesend; and, sailing the following morning,
we soon reached the Downs, where we could not come to anchor, the
wind blowing hard on shore. In the evening of the 31st so violent
a gale came on, that several coasting vessels were wrecked in the
night, and even our own topmasts were damaged. The gale lasted
all night, and in the morning it was our lot to pick up from
their boat five men and a boy, the crew of a sloop laden with
Portland stone from Weymouth. The vessel, which could not be
lightened, soon afterwards went down in our sight. We now found
ourselves near Cherbourg, and therefore tacked to make for
Spithead, to repair our tops. The wind by this time abated; the
morning of the 2d day of September dawned calm and fair, and we
found ourselves off the Isle of Wight. It was not till the next
morning that ire could attain an anchorage in St. Helen's roads,
where we eventually waited for a fair wind twelve days, lodging
on shore, like Henry Fielding, upon his Voyage to Lisbon, but not
like him meeting with so many entertaining adventures, or rather,
not like him gifted with so humorous or philosophic a mind to
discover or create them.</p>
<p class="poem">"O reader! had yon in your mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such states as silent thought
can bring,&mdash;<br>
O gentle reader! you would find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A tale</i> in every
thing."</p>
<p>On the 16th day of September we weighed anchor for the last
time; and it cost us three or four days more to pass the Land's
End. We posted rapidly through the Bay of Biscay in a gale, but
not before the abatement of the wind gave us full proof of the
heavy swell of this far-famed caldron. The great boil was of
coarse more mountainous after than during the storm; and this
must be that misery infernal which Shakespeare meant by the
words&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"imprison'd in the viewless
winds,<br>
And blown with restless violence round about<br>
The pendent world."</p>
<p>On the 26th September we emerged from this eternal sea-quake,
and on the 30th made the island of Porto Santo; and soon
afterwards Madeira came in sight. We sailed between these islands;
and, though we touched at neither, the very neighbourhood had the
refreshing effect of the first stage&mdash;the first inn. In the
morning we lay to in Funchal Bay, with the intention of landing
for an hour, but were refused that permission because we had
procured no bill of health for half a guinea from the Portuguese
consul in London. We were forbid from a fort on the Loo or Ilheo
(Island) Beck. After a sultry row of ten miles bad: to our ship,
we made away from this inhospitable island with a fresh breeze,
which continued for the next two days. In the morning of the 3d
October we passed the island of Palma&mdash;the loftiest land we
had yet seen; audit was not till the 6th that we crossed the
tropic of Cancer. On this day the first flying-fish
(exoc&oelig;tus volitans) were seen, sparkling from the waves in
shoal-flights, and descending into them again as rapidly. They
can only fly while their finny wings are wet. A day or two
afterwards we first witnessed, in the dark of night, alongside
the vessel, that phosphorescent appearance of the sea, which is
attributed by men of science to luminous animalcula. On the
evening of the 9th the island of St Jago was in sight (one of the
Cape de Verds), and intending to water at Port Praya, we bore up
off the land till daylight the next morning, when we
unfortunately passed it, mistaking it for Mayo, that which we
took for St Jago turning out to be Fogo. We were therefore fain
to pursue our courses, there being no convenience for watering at
Fogo. Thus were we again disappointed in not landing. This day we
saw many bonitoes (scomber pelamis) and albicores (scomber
thynnus) leap out of the water to the height of five feet, where
they turned in the air, and fell into the sea again. On the next
day the island of Brava was in sight; and on the 13th October the
thermometer attained its greatest height during the voyage,
namely, 83°.</p>
<p>My journal now presents no other record than that of a calm
for a fortnight upon the burning line. A calm is the very bane of
a ship. There are few quarters from which the wind can blow, that
a sailor cannot make some course upon; but a calm is death. Dr.
Donne had felt what it was to be becalmed on the line, before he
wrote thus:</p>
<p class="poem">" Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous
rage<br>
A stupid calm, but nothing it doth suage.<br>
The fable is inverted; and far more<br>
A block afflicts now, than a stork before.<br>
Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves on us;<br>
In calms, Heav'n laughs to see us languish thus.<br>
As steady as I could wish my thoughts wane,<br>
Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there,<br>
The sea is now, and as the isles, which we<br>
Seek when we can more, our ships rooted be.<br>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
In one place lay<br>
Feathers and dust to-day and yesterday."</p>
<p>We were now almost constantly visited by that elegant and
companionable little bird, called by the sailors Mother Carey's
chicken. It is the procellaria pelagica, or stormy petrel; but we
found it by no means the fore-runner of storms. It is black with
a white rump, and flies close to the waves like a swallow. Its
legs are long like a lark's, and it rests its tired body by
literally treading upon the sea, with its wings expanded, whence
it is called petrel, after St. Peter. It does not swim. It is
delightful to see it evade the rise of every wave, which it never
suffers to wet it, closely as it flies to the sea.</p>
<p>On the 26th day of October we fell in with a Spanish or
Portuguese insurgent pirate. In answer to our account of
ourselves, she gave us something like Scrub's budget of news she
showed no colours, but said she came "from sea", and was bound
"to sea"; which put me in mind of the Devil's answer to the same
question (in Job) "from going to and fro in the earth, and from
walking up and down in it."</p>
<p>On the next day we were gratified by a sight of the fish,
called by the seamen the Portuguese man of war, and described by
Captain Cook as the holothuria physalis of Linnæus. It is a
species of zoophyta of the medusa kind.</p>
<p>On the 28th October we met the Millwood of New York, bound
from Canton to Europe with tea, which afforded us the opportunity
of writing home.</p>
<p>On the 4th November we crossed the equinoctial line, and were
afterwards favoured by fair winds to Rio de Janeiro. On the 12th
we had the good fortune of another means of writing to England,
by meeting two transports from Rio; and on the 18th in the
morning, we saw the coast of Brazil, as we stood in the bay of St
Anne.</p>
<p>The next day we saw, for the first time, two large albatrosses
(diomedia exulans). This bird had long possessed a great interest
in my mind from the conspicuous part it plays in Mr. Coleridge's
wonderful ballad of "The Auntient Marinere" The idea of this tale
is doubtless taken from the following passage in Captain George
Shelvocke's Voyage (1719):</p>
<p>"We had continued squalls of sleet, snow, and rain; and the
heavens were perpetually bid from us by gloomy, dismal clouds.
One would think it impossible any thing could live in so rigid a
climate; and indeed we all observed we had not the sight of one
fish, since we were come to the southward of Strait le Maire, nor
one sea-bird, except a disconsolate black albatross, who
accompanied us several days, hovering about us, as if he had lost
himself; till Simon Hatley, my second captain, observing, in one
of his melancholy fits, that this bird was always hovering near
us, imagined from his colour, that it might be some ill omen;
and, being encouraged in his superstition by the continued series
of contrary tempestuous winds, which had oppressed us ever since
we had got into this sea, he, after some fruitless attempts, at
length <i>shot the albatross</i>, perhaps not doubting that we
should have a fair wind after it."</p>
<p>The poet has certainly worked this hint up into an awful and
beautiful poem; but landsmen make a great mistake when they
attribute to sea-birds the habit of resting upon the ships they
follow. It is only the poor land-bird, accidentally blown off the
shore, that is glad to rest "upon the masts or shrouds:" no
albatross would "come for food or play to a mariner's halloo." It
is out of the albatross's power to rise from a ship's deck: it
has always great difficulty in rising from the sea, and begins by
scrambling along the waves. Its wing has no fewer than five
joints to spread, and get under way:</p>
<p class="poem">"Parva motu primo, mox sese attendit in
aurae."</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"As he makes wing, he gets
power."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson has fallen into a similar mistake in the following
passage of his "Isle of Palms."</p>
<p class="poem">"But sea-birds he oft had seen before,<br>
Following the ship in hush or roar,<br>
The loss of their resting-mast deplore,<br>
With wild and dreary cries." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* I would not be pedantic, and am aware that Mr.
Campbell's line&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Doom'd the long isles of Sydney Cove to
see,"</p>
<p class="foot">is just as good as ever, after the reader is told
that there are no long isles even in Port Jackson, and none at
all In Sydney Cove. But merely descriptive</p>
<p class="poem">"Authors, before they write, should read,"</p>
<p class="foot">if they have not had an opportunity of seeing.
Mr. Campbell himself, in his Poetical Specimens, has selected a
passage from the late Mr. Headley's poems, In which that tasteful
young student undertakes to describe New Zealand. To be sure he
calls upon Fancy to conjure up the picture; and a pure
fancy-piece it is:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Lo! at her call, New Zealand's wastes arise,<br>
Casting their shadows far along the main,<br>
Whose brows, cloud-capt in joyless majesty,<br>
No human foot hath trod, since time began:<br>
Here death-like silence ever brooding dwells,<br>
Save when the watching sailor startled hears,<br>
Far from his native land, at darksome night,<br>
The shrill-ton'd petrel, or the penguin's voice,<br>
That skim their trackless flight on lonely wing<br>
Through the black regions of a nameless main."</p>
<p class="foot">Surely Mr. Headley might have learned from
Captain Cook that New Zealand is well peopled, if not that the
penguin flies not, but swims; and from what book of natural
history or voyages did he get "the shrill-ton'd petrel?" The
"nameless main" is the South Pacific Ocean.]</p>
<p>On the same day we saw also several dolphins (coryphæna
hippurus), one of which we caught with a hook and line, and
killed. It was the most beautiful creation I ever saw&mdash;its
colours shifting into an endless variety of blues, greens and
yellows&mdash;its back blues and greens&mdash;its belly yellows,
orange, or gold, spotted with blues and lilacs&mdash;its fins
like a peacock's neck&mdash;in short, it is the "very, very
peacock" of fishes. Nothing but the last scene of a pantomime can
approach its brilliancy, and then it is as much superior to that
as nature is to art. So died our coryphæna hippurus; and so
moralizes the noble poet of our times, in one of his "sullen
fits":&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem" style="text-indent:10%;">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"parting
day<br>
Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues<br>
With a new colour, as it gasps away,<br>
The last still loveliest, till&mdash;'tis gone, and all is
grey."</p>
<p>The likeness of this idea occurs in the following weak, cold,
wire-drawn passage of Falconer's "Shipwreck"; but the
condensation, the application, the point are all Lord
Byron's:</p>
<p class="poem">"But while his heart the fatal jav'lin
thrills,<br>
And flitting lite escapes in sanguine rills,<br>
What radiant changes strike th' astonish'd sight!<br>
What glowing hues of mingled shade and light!<br>
Not equal glories gild the lucid west,<br>
With parting beams all o'er profusely drest."</p>
<p>These sights consoled us for the loss of land this day; and on
the next, the new world was again in view. On the following
morning (21st November) we were brought in sight of the harbour
of Rio de Janeiro, and came to anchor there in the evening. It
was under a glowing sunset, with a light fair breeze, that we
glided into this sublime and beautiful harbour. The hilly points
of land, past which we sailed, were covered over with (to us)
exotic vegetation; and the wooded mountains in the distance were
obviously uneuropean: it was like sailing in a ship of heaven,
into a new planet</p>
<p>It comes not within my plan to copy full, true, and particular
accounts of countries, from histories, or voyages and travels.
Suffice it to say, that on the following morning, I went on shore
for nearly a fortnight, daring which time I saw enough of America
to appreciate its grandeur and fertility, and of the Portuguese,
to estimate their pettiness and barbarism, and how unworthy the
least enlightened nation of Europe is of colonizing such a fine
country. I made one considerable excursion into the interior,
namely, to the waterfalls of Tejeuca, distant three leagues. The
party was made by my friend the Chevalier Langsdorff, the Russian
Consul General. The whole ride lay along narrow passes round
romantic mountains, in many parts very steep and precipitous.
Magnificent aloes and warm orange-trees, with their fruit,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Like golden lamps in a green
night,"</p>
<p>grew spontaneously; and frequent streams refreshed, And
cascades illustrated, the landscape. We took our breakfast under
the first, and our dinner under the second, waterfall. The former
meal was made before the cottage of two intelligent Frenchmen,
who had commenced a coffee-plantation here: the scenery and
properties made me fancy myself on the stage of a theatre. A
French nobleman, who is building a house in the neighbourhood,
came walking down the passes of the waterfall to join our party:
it was</p>
<p class="poem" style="text-indent:4%;">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"much like the back scene of a
play<br>
Or melodrame, which people flock to see,<br>
When the first act is ended by a dance,<br>
In vineyards copied from the south of France."</p>
<p>We could see him zig-zag towards us ten minutes before he
arrived,&mdash;I had almost said came on the stage. Our outward
journey was performed under 85 degrees of heat in the shade,
which seemed to be enjoyed by the monkey, the snake, the parrot,
and the humming bird; bet ear homeward took place under a cool
moonlight, and was attended by the sparkling of fire-flies and
the flinging of crickets.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 4th December, we quitted the English
hospitality, Portuguese music, and tropical heat of Rio, and
returned on board of ship. On the next morning at daylight we got
under way, and were towed out of this beautiful harbour: in the
evening we lost sight of Cape Frio.</p>
<p>The next morning early we crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and
proceeded on our course to Australia with a fair wind. We now
came into the principality of whales, and were almost constantly
attended by albatrosses and petrels. In the evening of the 21st,
a calm, which we attributed to our propinquity to the island of
Tristan da Cunha, which the rain prevented us from seeing,
brought no fewer than eight albatrosses to swim and feed at our
stern.* They bit the bait, but avoided the hook, of lines which
were thrown towards them; but on the 2d day of January, 1817, the
crew were fortunate enough to catch nine large ones by similar
means. One measured ten feet from wing to wing's extremity. On
this day we doubled the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Aleutians assured Mr. Langsdorff that the
albatross cannot fly in a calm, and may then be taken by the
hand, either by land or by water. (See his Voyages and Travels,
part it p. 106.) I believe the tale: the bird is the mere
creature of storm, and has no more power over itself than a paper
kite or an air-balloon: it la all wing, and has no muscle to
raise itself with; it must wait for a wind before it can get
under way.]</p>
<p>We were now visited by what sailors call the Cape pigeon. It
is the small blue pintado, mentioned by Mr. Anderson, in his
observations on Christmas Island in Cook's Voyages. That great
circumnavigator himself, in his Second Voyage, also describes
"the brown and white pintado, which we named Antarctic petrel,
because it seems, to be a native of that region. It is
undoubtedly of the petrel tribe, and is in every respect shaped
like the pintado, differing from it only in colour. The head and
fore-part of the body of this are brown, and the hind-part of the
body, tail, and the ends of the wings, are white." In the
Edinburgh Elements of Natural History, the only pintado is called
the procellaria Capensis (from the Cape of Good Hope), and is
described as "white with brown spots", from no later an authority
than Dampier's Voyages.</p>
<p>On the 8th day of January we saw a strange sail, being the
only vessel, except one whaler, which we had seen since we left
Rio de Janeiro. If my meagre narrative has made so much of birds
and fishes, how much more interesting is the sight of a ship full
of human creatures; especially in a latitude where</p>
<p class="poem" style="text-indent:10%;">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"ships
are rare;<br>
From time to time, like pilgrims, here and these,<br>
Crossing the waters."</p>
<p>At day-break the next morning, the ship which we saw yesterday
was only ten miles astern of us, and another vessel appeared
still nearer to us. The wind being very light, we lay to till the
first ship came up, and spoke her. She proved to be the Galatea
of Boston, from Gibraltar to Calcutta. In the evening, the other
ship came near enough to show American colours also.</p>
<p>The next morning both the vessels were considerably ahead of
us, and passed out of sight in the course of the day.</p>
<p>In the evening of the 18th we were near the site of the island
laid down in the charts as Necklegel, but did not see it.</p>
<p>We had now reached so cold a latitude, that on the 28th the
thermometer's greatest height was 52°, being the lowest degree to
which it fell on this voyage.</p>
<p>On the 1st day of February, a gale of wind, from the
south-west, afforded me an opportunity of verifying the equal
truth of Dr. Donne's "Storm".</p>
<p class="poem">"Then, like two mighty kings, which, dwelling
far<br>
Asunder, meet against a third to war,<br>
The south and west winds join'd; and, as they blew,<br>
Waves, like a rolling trough, before them threw:<br>
Sooner than you read this line, did the gale,<br>
Like shot, not fear'd till felt, our sails assail."</p>
<p>Oh the 9th we saw the smaller gull, which I took to be Captain
Cook's chocolate-coloured albatross; and on the 11th I counted no
fewer than twenty albatrosses about us.</p>
<p>On the next day an innumerable shoal offish, which the sailors
called <i>black fish</i>, were rolling along with the ship, like
porpoises. I could not find it described in the Edinburgh
Elements of Natural History, and was at a loss whether to call it
a whale, a physeter, or a dolphin. From its size and bottle-nose,
I should take it to be the balæna rostrata; but then some of the
crew, who had been whalers, said that it produced spermaceti, as
the physeter only does; and its motion more resembled that of a
porpoise (delphinus). It was quite black, except that it had a
grey patch on the back: it had one fistula behind the head, and
an adipose dorsal fin. It was about fifteen feet long.</p>
<p>On the 15th, a phosphorescent sea and Portuguese men of war
betrayed a warmer latitude; and at day-break of the 17th! the
south coast of Australia came in sight, being the first land we
had seen for seventy-three days. It was cliffy and woody, and had
a look of home. It was now calm, and we lay off Cape Bridgewater.
Clouds of smoke rose from the shore, supposed to be fires kindled
by the native Indians. Captain Cook observed similar fires on
this coast.</p>
<p>On the next day the land was out of sight. A single penguin
came swimming round the ship, and looking up at us with wonder
and pleasure, like a savage man. It was cruelly shot for its
curiosity. It is the link between a fish and a bird. It cannot
fly: its wings have no feathers, but resemble, and are used like,
fins: it swims under the water just like a fish. Its tail has
rigid, unplumed feathers, and is wedge-shaped. I could not find
this species exactly described in the Edinburgh Elements of
Natural History, our only authority on board. The aptenodyta
patachonica ** comes nearest to it. I describe our penguin as
follows: back and throat black; belly and breast white; wings
black above and white below; feet black below and white above;
nails black; fourth or inner toe very small and detached; bill
light brown: a yellow mark behind the ears.</p>
<p class="foot">[** I have since found from Wood's Zoography that
this is the aptenodyta patachonica of Linnæus and Buffon; but I
have also seen a very different species of penguin from Macquarie
Island, with an aquiline beak, and the yellow, colouring a horned
crest, instead of being behind the ears. The irides of this
species are brown instead of red.]</p>
<p>On the 19th, we passed King's Island barely in sight, and
entered Bass's Strait. All this day, greater numbers of porpoises
had been sporting along than we had ever seen before. From close
observation, I judged them to be the dolphin of the ancients, the
delphinus delphis of Linnæus; for what we call the dolphin is of
soother genus, the coryphæna hippurus. The porpoise appears to
roll round, out of the water, as if it were one of the wheels of
Neptune's car&mdash;I say <i>appears</i>, for it does not roll.
Ovid's words are right: it leaps out: his description is as
correct as it is beautiful:</p>
<p class="poem">Undique dant saltus, multâque adspergine
rorant,<br>
Emerguntque iterum, redeuntque sub æquore rursus;<br>
Inque chori ludunt speciem, lascivaque jactant<br>
Corpora, et acceptum patulis mare naribus efflant.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right"><i>Metam</i>. lib. iii. v.
683&mdash;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Natural History says that the dolphin is very
accurately figured on some ancient coins of Magna Græcia. In the
gem of Cupid riding on the dolphin, the fish is a mere chimera;
and in the notes to the <i>Delphin</i> Virgil (one should not
quote any other upon such a subject) it is said (Æn. lib. v. v. 5
94) "quem falsò incurvo corpore pinxêre veteres, nisi fortè sic
apparet propter impetum ac velocitatem motûs, cùm erumpit e mari:
* verè enim dicitur a Plinio (lib. 9. 8) velocissimum omnium
animalium, non solùm marinorum; ocyor volucri, ocyor
telo&mdash;tanta vi exsilit, at pleramque vela navium
transvolet.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I dare say Dr. Franklin never read the notes
to the Delphin or any other edition of Virgil, yet my sagacious
brother-journalist (ut me collandem) has made exactly the same
remark in his pleasing Journal of a Voyage to Philadelphia in
1726 (See his Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 321): "Every one takes notice
of that vulgar error of the painters, who always represent this
fish monstrously crooked and deformed, when it is in reality as
beautiful and well-shaped a fish as any that swims. I cannot
think what could be the original of this chimera of theirs (since
there is not a creature in nature that in the lent resembles
their dolphin), unless it proceeded at first from a false
imitation of a fish in the posture of leaping, which they have
since improved into a crooked monster, with ahead and eyes like a
bull, a hog's snout, and a tail like a blown tulip."]</p>
<p>The next night a strong gale blew us through the strait. At
daybreak of the following morning Round Island was in sight, and
we passed it close on the left, for the sake of avoiding a
dangerous sunken rock, called Crocodile, over which we saw the
sea breaking, about four miles to the right, near the Slipper
Islands. We passed, also on the right, the Twins or Curtis's
Islands and the Seal Islands; and, on the left, two or three more
rocks called Barren Islands. Behind, on this side, stretched
Wilson's Promontory, on the main land of New South Wales. Kent's
Island we did not see.</p>
<p>At two o'clock on the following morning we found ourselves
close in shore on the east coast of New South Wales, and
continued coasting all day with a fair breeze. The land exactly
accords with Captain Cook's description: "the sea shore was a
white sand, but the country within was green and woody." We again
saw columns of smoke. In the forenoon we passed Ram Head, and in
the afternoon doubled Cape Howe. On the rocks we saw many seals.
In the evening we passed the Green Cape, so called from the turf
upon it. The country is thus accurately described by Captain Cook:
"it is of a moderate height, diversified by hill and valley,
ridge and plain, interspersed with a few lawns,** of no great
extent, but in general covered with wood: the ascent of the hills
and ridges is gentle, and the summits are not high." <i>First
Voyage</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is now ascertained that these are mere
marshes.]</p>
<p>The next morning found us off higher hills and a long table
mountain. We saw several fires on the coast. At noon we passed
Mount Dromedary, off which lies Montague Island. The land was
more distant to-day, and showed ranges of higher hills, one
behind the other, like the waves of the sea. We passed Bateman's
Bay and Point Upright; and in the evening brought the peaked
hill, which Captain Cook likened to and called the Pigeon-house,
in sight</p>
<p>Early the next morning we doubled Cape St. George. The land
was still distant, but we saw Hat Hill. In the evening, having
run our distance by the log, we lay to all night off Botany Bay;
and at daylight of the 24th of February, made sail for Port
Jackson, and anchored in Sydney Cove in good time in the morning;
and thus ends the narrative of a voyage of one hundred and
fifty-two days at sea, during which we traversed 15,335 miles by
the log.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus have I extracted all the honey of my voyage for the
reader: the sting remains with me. I am not ungrateful enough to
forget all the beautiful sunsets and moonlights of the first half
of the voyage, nor the frequent reliefs to the eye which the
sight of islands afforded: but no landsman can form an idea of a
three weeks calm near the line; and if the first half of the
voyage was too hot, the second was too cold and cloudy; so that
we had no sunset or moonlight scenes at all; and then we saw not
any land for seventy-three days, nor any ship for forty-four.
Thus deserted, the albatross, "the bird that loved the man", took
pity on us; and from Rio de Janeiro we were hardly ever without
him: we were also visited by sea-hens and Cape-pigeons; and
during the whole voyage, I do not think I missed my favourite
little petrel for a week together.</p>
<p>Having passed so many months with sight of "nothing lovely but
the sea and sky", it might be expected that I should not close my
narrative without some observation or reflection upon those
kindred immensities. But I have little to add to the facts above
recorded, from which it will be abundantly seen how interesting
is the sight of the smallest fish or bird, and therefore it may
be presumed</p>
<p class="poem">"How like a load on the weary eye<br>
Lie the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky!"</p>
<p>As the profound author of this quotation, has anticipated my
next feeling on board of ship, I had better have recourse to his
words:</p>
<p>"I observed a wild duck, swimming on the waves&mdash;a single,
solitary wild duck. It is not easy to conceive how interesting a
thing it looked, in that round, objectless desert of waters. I
had associated such a feeling of immensity with the ocean, that I
felt exceedingly disappointed, when I was out of sight of ail
land, at the narrowness and <i>nearness</i> (as it were) of the
circle of the horizon. So little are images capable of satisfying
the obscure feelings connected with words!"</p>
<p>The flat sea (as Milton calls it) can be seen only for five or
six miles round; but when a headland is in sight (and the Peak of
Teneriffe may be seen one hundred and eighty miles off) the ideas
of vastness and distance are restored.</p>
<p>I have only one or two other remarks to make. The panorama of
an ordinary sea is mere sameness; but when there is a heavy swell
and the wind blows, it is sport to see the head of a huge wave,
as it rises into the wind's sweep, dashed off into atoms like
dust, and converted into foam. On ordinary occasions, the only
amusement of sailing is to look over the ship's quarter, and
watch the recurrent foam that follows the stern, in sight and
sound exactly like a water-fall. As the sea settles after each
dash, the froth veins and clouds the dark water, and gives it the
precise resemblance of marble, whence the epithet in Virgil is
peculiarly happy:</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Et quæ marmoreo * fert monstra
sub equate pontus.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Carystian marble was sea-green. <i>Salmas.
ad Hist. Aug</i>. p. 164.]</p>
<p>A beautiful effect is produced by: the sun's shining through
the spray, at a ship's side: a perfect rainbow is seen in the
dark sea, on the other side of the spray, and may be fancied to
lie some fathoms deep.</p>
<p class="poem">"An Iris sits amidst th' infernal surge,<br>
Like Hope upon a death-bed; and, unworn<br>
Its steady dyes, while all around is torn<br>
By the distracted waters, bears serene<br>
Its brilliant hues, with all their beams unshorn;<br>
Resembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,<br>
Love watching Madness with unalterable mien."</p>
<p>And now I have exhausted all the pleasures of shipboard, which
(to my thinking) are few indeed and small, compared with its many
and great pains. Some allowance must certainly be made, in
weighing this opinion, for the wearisome length of this voyage,
broken only by one landing, performed in a heavy and uneasy ship,
and ushered in by a storm, in the Channel. But when all this is
done, a cabin is a small room, that serves for parlour and
bed-room, and pantry and storeroom, never secure, from pitching
and roiling at an angle of forty-five degrees from nature's
level, each way; so that I cannot think that even a pennyless,
disabled sailor would live twelve months in a house on shore
which should be subject to the same motion&mdash;no, not if he
were paid a hundred pounds for it, and had a sick wife and large
family. He that would go to sea had need have neither ears nor
nose; for booms and bulkheads will creak, and provisions will
emit their odour. Were a man, like the king of the Black Isles in
the Arabian Nights, marble from the girdle downwards, he ought
with impunity go to sea as a passenger; but he who has the
misfortune to have a stomach; and legs unused to balance his body
on moving boards, had better stay on <i>terra firma</i>.</p>
<p>A sailor does not live in <i>præsenti</i>, but only in
retrospection and anticipation; his conversation is, "Where was I
this time last year?" and "How soon shall we reach such a place?"
The bachelor critic in Gil Blas maintained that the wind was the
most interesting circumstance in the tragedy of Iphigenia; but I
am sure it is the only important topic of discussion on board of
ship.</p>
<p class="poem">Nequicquam Deus abscidit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prudens Oceano dissociabili<br>
Terras, si tamen impiæ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non tangenda rates transiliunt vada.</p>
<p>Man was never meant to cross an ocean; and, as Sir Philip
Sidney well says of a ship: "That dwelling-place is unnatural to
mankind; and then the terribleness of the continual motion, the
desolation of the far-being from comfort, the eye and the ear
having ugly images ever before it, doth still vex the mind, even
when it is best armed against it"</p>
<p>To conclude&mdash;the greatest pleasure of a sea-voyage is the
end of it; and I may venture to assert that the cry of
<i>Land!</i> was never yet heard without joy, even by one of so
roving a spirit that he would go to sea again the next day. Even
such a one does not love the sea for itself, but only as the
vehicle of seeing various countries. And truly, the sight of a
foreign land or town is, for the first twenty-four hours,
enchanting, though a great part of the pleasure must be set down
to the account of getting out of shipboard upon dry ground. But
no sight can be cheaply purchased by even a month's restless
imprisonment at sea; and when all lands are seen, none is like
<i>home!</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>JOURNAL OF AN EXCURSION ACROSS THE BLUE<br>
MOUNTAINS OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 7<i>th October</i>, 1822. This spring month
is the fittest to make this excursion in. The winter nights are
too cold, and the summer days too hot In the autumn the flowers
are not in bloom.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the travel commence at Emu Ford over the
river Nepean, a branch of the Hawkesbury. Crossing this stream is
always a work of such time and trouble, and sometimes of such
difficulty and danger, that the traveller should send forward his
cart or baggage-horses, to overcome it, half a day before he
rides or rows through it himself. The ferry is the property of
government, who have hitherto delayed * either to provide a punt
themselves, or to suffer the stockholders of the colony to build
one by subscription. The consequences are frequent losses of
cattle in swimming, and injury of sheep in boating, over.
Although the river was not unusually high, we were obliged to
unload our cart before it could be drawn through the ford; and
thus lost several hours in transporting the baggage by. one small
boat, and in reloading the cart.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Since this was written, a punt has been
established by government at Emu Ferry.]</p>
<p>On the banks of the Nepean, I saw almost the only deciduous
native tree in the territory, namely, the white cedar (melia
azedarach), the common bead-tree of India,** beautiful in itself
and congenial to me from that singularity. All the other
indigenous trees and shrubs, that I have seen, are evergreens;
the eternal eucalyptus, with its white bark and its scanty
tin-like foliage, or the dark casuarina tell, and exocarpus
funeral; all as unpicturesque as the shrubs and flowers are
beautiful:&mdash;the various, justly called proteaceous, banksia,
and the hesperidean mimosa,*** the exquisite epacris, the curious
grevillea, xanthorrh&oelig;a, the sceptre of Flora, telopea the
magnificent, and thysanotus the lovely. New South Wales is a
perpetual flower-garden, hot there is not a single scene in it of
which a painter could make a landscape, without greatly
disguising the true character of the trees. They have no lateral
boughs, and cast no manes of shade; but, in return, it is to this
circumstance, which causes so little vegetable putrefaction, that
the healthiness of the climate is mainly to be attributed. "A
part of their economy (says Mr. Brown the botanist), which
contributes somewhat to the peculiar character of the Australian
forests, is, that the leaves both of the eucalyptus and acacia,
by far the most common genera in Terra Australis, and, if taken
together, and considered with respect to the mass of vegetable
matter they contain (calculated from the rise, 86 well as the
number of individuals), nearly equal to all the other plants of
that country, are vertical, or present their margin and not
either surface towards the stem, both surfaces having
consequently the same relation to light." **** Can this
circumstance be partly the cause of their
unpicturesqueness&mdash;of the monotony of their leaf? Or is it
merely their evergreenness? "In the Indies (says Linnæus), almost
all the trees are evergreen, and have broad leaves; but in our
cold regions, most trees cast their foliage every year, and such
as do not, bear acerose, that is, narrow and acute, leaves. If
they were broader, the snow which falls during winter would
collect among them, and break the branches by its weight. Their
great slenderness prevents any such effect, and allows the snow
to pass between them." ***** But snow is not unknown to the
eucalypti and acacia? of New Holland; and may not the
verticalness of the broad leaves of some of them answer the same
snow-diverting purpose as the acerose-leavedness of European
evergreens? Yet the foliage of the eucalypti is always scanty;
that of the acaciæ acerose; and the snow of Australia is apt to
melt. Be this as it may, no tree, to my taste, can be beautiful
that is not deciduous. What can a painter do with one cold
olive-green? There is a dry harshness about the perennial leaf,
that does not savour of humanity in my eyes. There is no flesh
and blood in it: it is not of us, and is nothing to us. Dryden
says of the laurel,</p>
<p class="poem">"From winter winds it suffers no decay;<br>
For ever fresh and fair, and every month is May."</p>
<p class="foot">[** I met with this tree also in the
Brazils.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** I do not mean that the mimosa belongs to
Linnæus's natural order <i>hesperideæ</i>, though the eucalyptus
does: my epithet is merely classical; I would say
<i>golden</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Flinders's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 587.]</p>
<p class="foot">[***** Sup. to Encyc. Brit., <i>Art</i>.
Botany.]</p>
<p>Now it may be the fault of the cold climate in which I was
bred, but this is just what I complain of in an evergreen. "For
ever fresh" is a contradiction in terms; what is "for ever fair"
is never fair; and without January in my mind, there can be no
May. All the dearest allegories of human life are bound up in the
infant and slender green of spring, the dark redundance of
summer, and the sere and yellow leaf of autumn. These are as
essential to the poet as emblems, as they are to the painter as
picturesque objects; and the common consent and immemorial custom
of European poetry have made the change of seasons, and its
effect upon vegetation, a part, as it were, of our very nature. I
can therefore hold no fellowship with Australian foliage, but
will cleave to the British oak through all the bareness of
winter. It is a dear sight to an European to see his young
compatriot trees in an Indian climate, telling of their native
country by the fall of their leaf, and, in due time, becoming a
spring unto themselves, although no winter has passed over them,
just as their fellow-countrymen keep Christmas though in the
hottest weather, and, with fresh fruits about them, affect the
fare and sometimes the fireside of old England. "New Holland
(says Sir James Smith) seems no very beautiful or picturesque
country, such as is likely to form, or to inspire, a poet. Indeed
the dregs of the community, which we have poured upon its shores,
must probably subside and purge themselves, before any thing like
a poet, or a disinterested lover of nature, can arise from so
foul a source. There seems, however, to be no transition of
seasons in the climate itself, to excite hope, or to expand the
heart and fancy." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sup. to Encyc Brit., <i>Art</i>. Botany.]</p>
<p>Yet let me do justice to the evergreens of New Holland. It is
to the scantiness of their foliage that the grazier owes the dry
wholesomeness of the native grasses, however thin; and it is to
the undecaying and aromatic, myrtaceous, perennial leaf that the
colonists attribute the healthiness of their climate. No miasmata
come from the marshes or fallen leaves of Australian forests.
Intermittent fevers are unknown here. An opinion has obtained in
North America that evergreens increase cold. In New South Wales
the cold is found to be increased by clearing the land of them,
although they certainly retain the night air so long in the
valleys, that the hills are warmer than those in the winter. In
the summer the hills are cooler from the sea-breeze. I should
therefore say, build on a hill. The climate of New South Wales is
becoming generally cooler, as the colony gets cleared of timber.
While I am comparing the trees of America and Australia, it is
important to agriculture that I should mention that the stumps of
the eucalypti, from the quantity of gum they contain, do not rot
in the ground soon after the trees have been cut down, as those
of the American and Norfolk Island timbers do. They must be
laboriously grubbed up, or burnt out by piling the surrounding
sods over them, like a kiln.</p>
<p>At Emu Plains or Island (for it is sometimes insulated by the
washings of the mountains, when the Nepean is flooded) there is a
government agricultural establishment of 350 men and a few women,
with a good brick house for the superintendant, and wooden huts
for the convict labourers. Here are grown for the benefit of the
crown, wheat, maize and tobacco; but experience everywhere proves
the loss at which government raises its own supplies. These
plains are not naturally cleared; but they will very boob be free
from stumps by the labour of these convicts, and will then leave
a rich tract of arable land for favoured grantees.</p>
<p>It is this river, whether we call it Hawkesbury or Nepean,
that is the Nile of Botany Bay: for the land on the banks owes its
fertility to the floods which come down from the Blue Mountains,
and which have been known to swell the waters nearly a hundred
feet above their usual level; and as these floods are uncertain
and often destructive of the growing crops, I once thought that
government (if it is to farm at all) had better have kept the
whole of this precarious garden in its own hands; since it ii
only public foresight that would provide against the loss of a
harvest, and only public wealth that could support it. After the
flood of 1817, the government ration was reduced from eleven to
three pounds of wheat per week; but since that period so much
wheat has been grown in the fine districts of Appin and Airds,
and in the island of Van Diemen's Land, that the colony is now
almost independent of these flood-farmers; and they are yearly
going out of fashion, for the benefit of the state. Nothing can
be more uncertain than the heavy rains of the climate. Sometimes
(but not of late years) the country is worse afflicted with long
droughts, in which the woods take fire and consume the grass, and
the cattle have perished for want of water. Often do the rains
descend, and the floods come, when the Hawkesbury corn is in the
ground, and the colony has sometimes suffered from the
improvidence of these farmers, in not building their wheat-stacks
out of the reach of the devouring waters. The extraordinary
fertility of these flooded lands, which have borne a crop of
wheat and a crop of maize in each year for the last
five-and-twenty years, has naturally induced their tenants to
rely too much upon this lubber-land sort of farming, just as the
inhabitants of Vesuvius cannot be induced to abandon that
mountain after a lava-flood from its volcano, and see nothing in
present ruin but the prospect of future riches. "So the Ohio
(says Mr. Birkbeck), with its annual overflowings, is unable to
wash away the inhabitants of Shawnee Town." ** But it is surely
impolitic to grant away such precarious and hotbed lands. In so
indifferent a general soil as that of New South Wales, a better
system of agriculture should be taught; and what encouragement is
given to the general firmer to bedew his land with the sweat of
his brow, when he sees that of his idle neighbour on the banks of
the river irrigated by the flood, and producing as good a crop,
with no other labour than that of hoeing and strewing? It is only
upon the chance of the flood's devouring, instead of feeding,
that the general farmer can calculate for occasional
remuneration; and when this calamity happens, the river farmer,
whose rapid gains induce him as rapidly to spend, is found
entirely unprovided, and his whole district is reduced to
subscription and beggary. This, in itself, is not one of the
least of the political evils of such a system. It is an
encouragement to future improvidence, and fosters a disposition
too literally to take no thought of the morrow, but to consider
and imitate the gigantic lily (doryanthes excelsa ***)&mdash;a
disposition which must be supposed to be already too natural
among the small settlers, who have emerged from the condition of
convicts. Another good reason against granting away this land,
and suffering it to be cleared, is, that the floods wash the
fallen timber into the channel of the river, and obstruct the
navigation. The removal of the trees from its banks has not only
contributed to choke the river by their falling in, but has
occasioned derelictions on one side and alluvions on the
other.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Notes on a Journey to America, p. 113.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** My pedantry is sanctioned by the authority
of Captain Parry's interesting Voyage, where he begins his
scientific researches in his third page in Yarmouth Roads, by
catching "several fine cod (gadus morbua)."]</p>
<p>But we shall never get our cart up Lapstone Hill at this rate;
and it is so steep and long, that we wore obliged to shift our
baggage twice in ascending it, notwithstanding Governor
Macquarie's Government and General Order of the 10th of June 1815
says, that "the facility of the ascent to Spring Wood excited
surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to give the
traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to
encounter." I found Lapstone Hill as difficult as any in the
journey, except Mount York; and we did not reach Spring Wood
(twelve miles and a half from the river), where alone there is
space enough in the forest to encamp upon, till after 9 o'clock
at night. There is little or no grass here, and the timber
consists principally of those species of eucalyptus called by the
colonists stringy and iron-bark. Here is stationed an acting
corporal's party of the 48th regiment, in a small barrack.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 8<i>th October</i>. Set forward at half an
hour after 9 o'clock, <i>a.m.</i> and halted on a mossy sand-hill
above Jamison's Valley, two miles beyond the King's Table-land,
at 5 o'clock p.m., having travelled sixteen miles this day. This
station is now called <i>The Burnt Weatherboarded Hut</i>, and
was Governor Macquarie's second depôt for making the road. The
timber now became more dwarf, and we were actually crossing the
Blue Mountains. We found the pass very alpine and difficult,
rocky, sandy, stony, flowery. The views were very grand. The
night was stormy, but little rainy&mdash;all in the sublime. "The
power of hills was on me," as Wordsworth says. I could not sleep
for thinking of our situation, and walked forth from my tent. The
air was refreshing. All were asleep from fatigue, with large
fires of piled wood at their feet, the gleams of which (for they
had been suffered to go down) gave a picturesque effect to the
tent and cart, and to the tethered horses, which were patiently
standing on the bleak and bare hill. A little more than thirty
years ago, this land was inhabited by savages only, and these
bills had, from the beginning of time, formed an impassable
barrier between their tribes. The spirit of British government
had now come from the antipodes, and, with nothing but a colony
of convicts, had, in that short time, penetrated upwards of a
hundred miles into the interior of the country, and established a
township there, to which the unarmed might travel as safely as
from London to Bristol. The very sleeping grooms beneath me had
been thieves and robbers, and the blasted heath looked like New
Hounslow; but our persons and property were inviolate.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 9<i>th October</i>. Moved at 8½ <i>a.m</i>.,
and arrived at the bottom of Cox's Pass down Mount York at 5½
<i>p.m</i>. (twenty-one miles and a half). The ridge of mountains
(or rather rocks), along which this passage could alone be
effected, is very difficult and desolate. The trees (still
eucalyptus) are stunted and burnt, with the exception of one
light species called the ash, of which good white-coopers' work
might be made, and perhaps ships' smaller spars. The King's
Table-land is as anarchical and untabular as any His Majesty
possesses. The Prince Regent's Glen below it (if it be the glen
that I saw) is not very romantic. Jamison's Valley we found by no
means a happy one. Blackheath is a wretched misnomer. Not to
mention its awful contrast to the beautiful place of that name in
England, <i>heath</i> it is none. <i>Black</i> it may be when the
shrubs are burnt, as they often are. Pitt's Amphitheatre
disappointed me. The hills are thrown together in a monotonous
manner, and their clothing is very unpicturesque&mdash;a mere sea
of harsh trees; but Mr. Pitt was no particular connoisseur either
in mountain scenery or in amphitheatres. Mount York (as Governor
Macquarie named it) redeems the journey across the Blue
Mountains, for it leads you to the first green valley. The
earliest burst of the Christian transalpine country, as seen from
the beginning of this mountain, is very beautiful. The sight of
grass again is lovely. The view from the commencement of Cox's
Pass down to it, is finer still. This <i>Big Hill</i>, as it is
alone called, should have been named Mount Pisgah, for it affords
the first view of the promised land of Australia, after the
wilderness of the Blue Mountains. In Van Diemen's Land they have
a river Jordan, and plains of Jericho; but the river is so called
(I suppose) because it may be occasionally passed over on dry
ground; and the plains are not equal to Bathurst Plains. After
three days' starving among the mountains, your cattle now get
plenty of green grass. Encamp then at the first bite; for there
is water enough, and the station under Mount York is very
picturesque into the bargain, <i>que ne gâte rien</i>. This
valley, which leads to Cox's River, is called the Vale of Clwydd,
but (like all colonial Windsors and Richmonds) does not at all
resemble its godmother in Old North Wales.</p>

<p>Henceforward, the country being perfectly open, the road is
little more than what they call in North America a <i>trace</i>,
made by chipping a <i>blaze</i> of bark off each side of a line
of trees.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 10<i>th October</i>. Did not proceed till
half past nine o'clock, <i>a.m</i>., but performed twenty-one
miles this day, and encamped on the banks of the Fish River at 7
o'clock, <i>p.m</i>. This is the first stream that flows
westerly, Cox's River falling into the Nepean. The journey to-day
was all beautiful. Cox's River (five miles from his pass down
Mount York, which might be avoided by an easier and shorter road
to the north of it) is worth going to spend a few days at, of
itself. It is a pretty stream, and rich in the botanical and
picturesque. Here the first granite is seen, though (I ant told)
there is granite at the Five Islands; and here I saw four new and
beautiful grevilleæ, viz. the cinerea, rosmarinifolia,
acanthifolia and sulphurea. From the over-hanging rocks of Cox's
Pass, I had before gathered the epacris ruscifolia, and an
elegant epacrideous flower, called dracophyllum secundum.</p>
<p>Here we met a few Indian natives of Bathurst. They resembled
the natives of the coast in appearance, but did not speak the
same language. They seem, however, to have advanced towards
civilization one degree further than the poor forked animals of
the warmer climate, inasmuch as they possess the art of very
neatly sewing together, with the sinews of the kangaroo and emu,
cloaks of skins, the hide of which they also carve in the inside
with a world of figures. They use these cloaks for the sole
purpose of keeping themselves warm, and have as little sense of
decency as the natives around Sydney; for in the middle of the
day, when the weather is warm, they throw back their cloaks
across their shoulders. They appear to be a harmless race, with
nothing ferocious in their manners or countenance. They are
perfectly cheerful, laughing at every thing they see, and
repeating every thing they hear. For the rest, little can be
added to Captain Tench's and Colonel Collins's accounts of the
natives of New South Wales. Their numbers are diminishing. Not
that they retreat before the settlements of Europeans: this they
cannot do: the different tribes (few as their numbers are) would
resist the invasion of each other's territory. Thirty or forty
miles will reach the circumference of each family's
peregrinations. The tribes about our first settlements are as
ignorant of the country beyond the mountains as the colonists
were; and such is the sterility of the greater part of Mr.
Oxley's first interior route, that he met with only twenty-two
Indians in a journey of five months. Of the persons of the
natives of New South Wales, I think Colonel Collins has given too
unfavourable a picture. Their faces have generally (in my
opinion) too much good-nature to be absolutely hideous, and (to
my taste) they do not imitate humanity so abominably as the
African negroes. Their hair is not woolly; their heads are not
dog-like; nor are their legs baboonish. The figure of many of
them is very good; and, as for their leanness, how can they wax
fat in so poor a country? From the neighbourhood of our
settlements we have scared the kangaroo and the emu, and left
these poor lords of the creation no created food but a few
opossums, and a tenancy in common with us of fish. Together with
their numbers, their customs and manners are in a state of decay.
The ceremony of extracting one of the right upper front teeth
from the jaw of adults (so fully described by Colonel Collins) is
nearly obsolete in the neighbourhood of our settlements, and the
custom is by no means universal in the island. But the
<i>corrobory</i>, or night-dance, still obtains. This festivity
is performed in very good time, and not unpleasing tune. The song
is sung by a few males and females who take no part in the dance.
One of the band beats time by knocking one stick against another.
The music begins with a high note, and gradually sinks to the
octave, whence it rises again immediately to the top. I took down
the following Australian national melody from Harry, who married
Carangarang, the sister of the celebrated Bennilong; and I
believe it to be the first that was ever reduced to writing:</p>
<div align="center"><a name="tune1" id="tune1"></a><img alt=""
src="1304421h-images/tune1.jpg"><br>
<a name="tune2" id="tune2"></a><img alt="" src=
"1304421h-images/tune2.jpg"></div>
<p>The dancers breathe in chorus like paviours, and the general
step consists in opening the knees with a convulsive shake to the
music; but occasionally they thread the mazes of each other,
without any confusion. They stripe themselves down the waist, and
paint their faces with white clay and red ochre, and in
compliment to European delicacy, wear boughs round their loins.
The glare of the large fires gives a picturesque effect to the
savage scene, and the dance works up the performers to a sublime
enthusiasm. I have been thus minute, because in a few years,
perhaps, even the corrobory will be no more, so sophisticated do
the Indians become from their pernicious association with the
convicts, who sow the seeds of drunkenness in the prolific soil
of savage indolence. A rum, or even sugar-cask, filled with
water, furnishes these poor creatures with an intoxicating
liquor; and the invasions of civilization are reproached with the
introduction of a new vice, which operates as an inflamer of all
their old ones. It is a melancholy sight to witness the drunken
quarrels and fightings of the simple natives of Australia, in the
streets of Sydney,&mdash;a people to whom civilization can never
bring the comforts of food, raiment and shelter, and the
blessings of religion, as an atonement for the vice and disease
which it necessarily carries along with it. That these
unfortunate beings were comparatively ignorant of the crime of
evil-speaking before we came among them, is proved by the broken
English words of scurrility and execration with which they
pollute their native tongue. The effect of this would be
ludicrous, were not the cause pitiable. Truly Botany Bay is a bad
school for them; but they have not learnt of the convicts to lie
or to steal. Perhaps it is better that their name should pass
away from the earth. They will not serve, and they are too
indolent and poor in spirit to become masters. They would always
be drones in the hive of an industrious colony. Nevertheless they
are not without the stamp of their Maker's image, cut in ebony
(as old Fuller says) instead of ivory. They bear themselves
erect, and address you with confidence, always with good-humour,
and often with grace. They are not common beggars, although they
accept of our carnal things in return for the fish and oysters,
which are almost all we have left them for their support. They are
the Will Wimbles of the colony; the carriers of news and fish;
the gossips of the town; the loungers on the quay. They know
everybody; and understand the nature of everybody's business,
although they have none of their own&mdash;but this. They give a
locality to the land, and their honest naked simplicity affords a
relief to the eye from the hypocritical lour of the yellow-clad
convict. The warlike features of the tribes which surround our
settlements are now quite effaced. The savages are forbidden to
enter the towns with their spears, and they cheerfully comply
with this requisition. They have a bowing acquaintance with
everybody, and scatter their <i>How-d'ye-do's</i> with an air of
friendliness and equality, and with a perfect English accent,
undebased by the <i>Massa's</i>, and <i>Missies</i>, and
<i>me-no's</i> of West Indian slavery. They have been tried to be
brought up from infancy as servants, but they have always run
away to the woods. Our government has also instituted a small
school for the education of native, black children. Some of their
parents (particularly of half-casts) have no objection to their
being clothed, and fed, and taught; but they cannot endure the
thoughts of their being made servants. The children learn almost
as readily as Europeans; but their parents will steal them away
when they grow up, and they will not willingly return among us. A
few pairs have beet? married and housed out of the school, but
they will not settle.* Their instinctive relish for the vermin
and range of the woods cannot be eradicated. "Sir (said Dr.
Johnson, holding up a slice from a quartern loaf), this is better
than the bread-fruit;" but the savages of Australia, although
extremely fond of bread, will never lose their more exquisite
relish for a fine fat grub. "Poor Tom! that eats the swimming
frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water;
swallows the old rat, and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle
of the standing pool. But let us talk with this philosopher." If
he is the most independent who has the fewest wants, the
houseless Australian is certainly our superior: "he owes the worm
no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no
perfume:" he looks upon us as "sophisticated": but he always
treats our persons with respect, although he holds our servants
very cheap, and looks down with a kind of stoical pity upon the
various articles of comfort to which we have made ourselves
slaves. He has no notion of that inferiority to us, the
oppression of which feeling reduces the New Zealanders and South
Sea Islanders almost to despair; and he despises the comforts of
civilization, although he has nothing of his own but his "hollow
tree and liberty", without even the "crust of bread". What then
must be his opinion of our servants? men and women, who sacrifice
their liberty and independence for the second-rate comforts of
civilization, which they earn by submitting to perform menial
offices for those who enjoy the first-rate, and by ministering to
their artificial wants; for even which first-rate comforts the
naked native has a contempt With us masters, all he contends for
nevertheless is equality. He acknowledges the British government,
and even accepts from the governor grants of his own patrimonial
land. Some of the Indians have also seriously applied to be
allowed convict-labourers, as the settlers are, although they
have not patience to remain in the huts which our government has
built for them, till the maize and cabbages that have been
planted to their hands are fit to gather. So the Spaniards
succeeded at length in domesticating many of the negroes of the
Philippine Islands, and converting them to Christianity, to which
they made no objection as long as they received subsistence; but
when they were obliged to labour tax the maintenance of their
family, they returned to the mountains. We have now lived among
the Australians more than thirty years; and yet, like the North
American Indians, or the negroes of the Philippine Islands, they
have adopted none of our arts of life, with the exception of
exchanging their stone hatchets and shell fish-hooks for our iron
ones. They will never become builders, or cultivators, or
mechanics, or mariners, like the New Zealanders or the South Sea
Islanders, nor indeed till they cease to be at all, will they
ever be other than they are.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Sydney Gazettes used to make a great
puffing about Governor Macquarie's Native Institution. Since his
departure the school has been very properly removed from the town
of Paramatta, to a remoter situation in the interior, on the
Richmond road; but when I visited it in 1823, there were but four
children in the school of the whole Indian blood, and four
tenants of the settling-huts erected for them by government; and
of these last (although it was the day of the committee's
quarterly meeting) only one was at hone; but I was told they
attended more numerously once a fortnight to receive their cation
from the government store. The few children of the half blood are
the results of "casual fruition." Great as is the disproportion
of white women to men, there is no instance of even a convict
permanently living with a black woman; so that there will be no
class of creoles in Australia.]</p>

<p>After leaving Cox's River, we ascended a very steep hill
called Mount Blaxland, and saw Wentworth's and Lawson's
Sugar-loaves, as Governor Macquarie called them. They are mere
hummocks,&mdash;lumps of sugar. These three gentlemen, namely,
Messrs. Gregory Blaxland, William Wentworth (the author of the
inflated and convict-party Description of New South Wales,
though, by the by, his discovery of the transalpine country is
the only thing it does not mention), and Lieutenant Lawson of the
Royal Veteran Company, are exclusively intitled to the merit of
exploring this pass, over the barrier mountains of the colony,
and therefore ought to have been more substantially rewarded,
than by a mere grant of one thousand acres each of the country
they discovered, and the sugar-plum of a name. In this attempt
Lieutenant Dawes, Captain Tench, Hacking, Ensign Barrallier of
the 102d regiment, the enterprising Mr. Bass, and Mr. Caley the
botanist, had successively failed. When Messrs. Blaxland,
Wentworth and Lawson returned home only for want of provisions,
then Governor Macquarie sends forth Mr. Deputy Surveyor Evans,
who very naturally sees the next high hill, and calls it Evans's
Peak or Crown, and pushes on to Bathurst Plains; and the journals
and geographies talk of the discoveries of Mr. Evans and Governor
Macquarie.</p>
<p>A change now takes place in the botany of the country. The
banksia integrifolia reappears; and we took leave of the banksiæ
serrata and ericæfolia, in a very stunted state, on the
mountains. Henceforward, the anguillaria dioica is the most
common flower all the way; but the most universal on both sides
of the mountains is a species of euphrasia.</p>
<p>The quiet of a beautiful night on the banks of the Fish River
led me to remark on "rural sounds". The notes of the birds of New
Holland are rather cries than songs, but many of them are
pleasing and plaintive. Some are harsh and vulgar, like those of
the parrot-kind, the cockatoo, the coachman's whip-bird, the
bellbird (which I call the creaking-wheel-bird), the
razor-grinder, and the laughing jack-ass (a species of
kings-fisher *); but a sort of cuckoo-noted bird sings at night,
something between the voice of the English cuckoo and the bark of
the watch-dog. The river treated us with a frog-concert all
night,&mdash;a constant common croaking,
<small>&chi;&omicron;&alpha;&xi;,
&chi;&omicron;&alpha;&xi;</small>, timed by bass-notes, like a
deep sheep-bell, or the human voice. The Fish River is not so
picturesque as Cox's; but it is a full and rapid stream, with
rippling falls, and equally rich in flowers. The fish would not
bite, but we shot a wood-duck for breakfast. Here we killed a
brown snake, about six feet long.</p>
<p class="foot">[* To which I would have given the name of alcedo
onocrotalus; but I am informed that it Is the dacelo gigantea of
Dr. Leach, or the great brown kingsfisher of White.]</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 11<i>th October</i>. Having rested till noon,
we proceeded to a settler's farm at O'Connell Plains, also on the
Fish River (fourteen miles). The country is new very open,
lightly timbered with dwarf trees; clothed with good grass, and
well watered. Passed Sidmouth Valley, now granted to a cisalpine
settler,&mdash;a pretty stock-farm. O'Connell Plains is the first
naturally-cleared land that the New South Wales traveller sees,
and it strongly reminded me, both in its brown soil and tufty
grass, of the "High Plains" of Van Diemen's Land, only it is much
better watered.</p>
<p>It is singular that the geology and botany of Australia should
run in parallels of meridian; but such is the fact, within
reasonably isothermal latitudes. This was constantly observed by
Mr. Oxley, in his expeditions into the interior of this country.
The eucalyptus cordata, the mimosa derwentea, the hakea
microcarpa, and the epacris ruscifolia of Van Diemen's Land, I
found perpetually recurring on this side of the Blue Mountains of
New South Wales, being, more than Cumberland county, in the
longitude of the river Derwent. How came the world planted and
animalled, to say nothing of manned? Why planted in longitudinal
furrows? Are the artificial measurements of the globe by man
recognised by Him "who hath weighed the mountains in scales, and
the hills in a balance?" The evisceration of passage-birds cannot
account for the transportation of seeds. Nonsense. As well might
the roc of the Arabian Nights convey beasts and men from one
country to another. "The distribution of organic beings on the
globe (says Baron Humboldt) depends not only on very complicated
climatic circumstances, but also on geological causes, with which
we are entirely unacquainted, because they are connected with the
original state of our planet." ** "New Holland contains about
forty European phænogamous plants, and the greater number of
those plants, which are found equally in the temperate zones of
both hemispheres, are entirely wanting in the intermediary or
equinoctial region, as well in the plains as on the mountains.
How can we conceive the migrations of plants through countries of
such a different climate, and which are now covered by the ocean?
How have the germs of organic beings, which resemble each other
in their appearance, and even in their internal structure,
unfolded themselves at unequal distances from the poles and the
surface of the seas, wherever places so distant present some
analogy of temperature?" *** The more we study the distribution
of organised beings on the globe, the more we are inclined, if
not to abandon the ideas of migration, at least to consider them
as hypotheses not entirely satisfactory. I am inclined to think
that these problems cannot be solved, and that the task of the
philosopher it fulfilled, when he has indicated the laws
according to which nature has distributed vegetable forms."

<p>This farm is a beautiful English-looking spot&mdash;meadow and
river. Here the fish bit readily. They consist, both in the Fish
River and in the Macquarie, into which it runs, of only two
kinds,&mdash;the one a fresh-water tasted, perch-like fish, and
the other more cod-like, and sometimes growing to the size of
twenty pounds weight.</p>
<p>A bird is frequent here, called the spur-winged plover. It has
a dull yellow lappet-like hood, and is armed with a claw of the
same colour, on the shoulder of each wing. It is a species of
jacana (parra, <i>Latham</i>).</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 12<i>th October</i>. Rain, which came on last
evening, set in to-day, and detained us at this farm till noon,
when the weather cleared up, and the evening proved beautiful.
Our road now lay over a succession of plains, still more clear
and fine than O'Connell Plains. These are called Macquarie Plains
and Bathurst Plains, in the former, the Fish River joins the
Macquarie. Arrived in good time at the township of Bathurst. Here
we set up pur rest, and pitched our tent for the Sabbath, on the
naturally cleared land of the winding banks of the Macquarie,
which are here and there edged with a few swamp-oaks
(<i>casuarina paludosa</i>). I could hardly believe I was
travelling in New Holland this day; so different&mdash;so
English&mdash;is the character of the scenery&mdash;downs,
meadows and streams in the flat&mdash;no side-scenes of
eucalyptus: but by "the white daisy of the sod", I suppose Mr.
Evans must mean either the gnaphalium or the aster, for I did not
observe the bellis of Australia here. The scarcity of wood now
takes away the American log-appearance of the cottages; they
build of turf here, and roof with straw or reeds, instead of
wooden shingles. You may see as far as the eye can reach.
Stockmen, cattle and sheep occasionally form your horizon, as in
Old Holland&mdash;a Paul Potter or Cuyp effect rare in New
Holland. At sunset we saw wooded hills, distant enough to display
that golden blue or purple which landscape-painters love. The
smoke of the little village of Bathurst is seen for males off,
which that of no other town in Australia is. These things may
seem trifling to an English reader; but by an American or
Australian, accustomed to travel through the eternal valley of
the shadow of monotonous woods, the charm of emerging into any
thing like European scenery will be duly appreciated.</p>
<p>At Bathurst, saw what is called the native turkey. It is the
New Holland vulture of Dr. Latham; and is one of the most
remarkable birds found in Australia, appearing to form a
connecting link between the rapacious and gallinaceous orders.
Quarts pebbles now form the surface of the geology.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 13<i>th October</i>. An English
sabbath-morning:&mdash;heavy mist slowly rolling away, lingering
with a light cloud across the tops of the hills. The principal
chaplain of the colony (the Rev. Samuel Marsden) who happened to
be here on a visit, performed divine service in the government
granary (a large brick building) to about sixty people, including
soldiers and convicts. After service, I visited a few of the
small settlers' huts, and found the parents cleanly, and the
children even expensively, drest. Rum, the bane of colonies, has
scarcely yet found its way over the mountains; and happily the
town of Bathurst is not yet large enough to support a
public-house. The afternoon proved stormy, and the night
rainy.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 14<i>th October</i>. Cloudy morning, with
constant rain all day, which confined me to my tent from my
intended excursions round Bathurst The river is rising
rapidly.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 15<i>th October</i>. Morning windy and cloudy,
but the day proved fair. The Macquarie very high, and still
rising. Left Bathurst at half-past ten o'clock for the
stock-location of a cisalpine settler at King's Plains,
twenty-five miles to the south-west, through Queen Charlotte's
Valley, and arrived there before sunset;&mdash;a beautiful ride
through fertile plains (Evans's), or thinly and dwarfly wooded
grazing-land, richly watered with creeks and swamps (which horned
cattle love), emptying themselves into the Macquarie River. These
(after the late rains) assumed the appearance of rapid streams or
boggy land; but the spring grass promised all the better, and the
water soon drains off the undulations of this beautiful country.
The waters abounded with fine black ducks, two of which formed
our supper; and we saw a pair of that species of bittern, called
by the colonists the native companions (ardea antigone), fly
elegantly over our heads.</p>
<p>Procured a cod-fish from a creek of the river Macquarie, which
we crossed in our way, weighing nineteen pounds. This is truly a
land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="poem">"Here we behold the large sleek neat,<br>
Unto the dewlaps up in meat."</p>
<p>The settlers' convict-servants (stockmen and sheep watchmen)
do little but drone about their filthy turf-huts, and have as
much milk, fish, mutton and flour, as they can eat and drink. The
stockmen do not see their cattle once in six months perhaps; and
the shepherds are proportionally negligent. The settler, who would
live on his own farm, could not fail to thrive in a country like
this.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 16<i>th October</i>. The day perfectly fine.
Rode completely over this stock-location. These occupations (with
the exception of a reserve of ten miles on the south side of the
river *) are freely accorded by the present government of New
South Wales to cisalpine settlers, whose grants of land are
surcharged by the increase of their cattle and sheep, and whose
home-runs are now hemmed in by neighbouring grantees. They
consist of a ticket of occupation, at six months' notice to quit,
of two miles of pasturage each way from a centre. This is a most
liberal feature in the administration of Sir Thomas Brisbane. In
Governor Macquarie's time, although the cattle and sheep, to the
eastward of the mountains, were dying from drought and there were
grass and water in abundance across the mountains, no settler was
permitted to take, his cattle over the Nepean, or even to cross
it himself on a visit, without a written pass from the governor.
The following order upon the subject was issued by Major-General
Macquarie:</p>
<p class="foot">[* Since this was written, the whole of the south
side has been reserved.]</p>
<p>"The military guard, stationed at the first depot on the
mountains, will receive full instructions to prevent the progress
of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes to
visit the country only. The necessity for the establishing and
strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious, to every one
who will reflect on it, to require any explanation here."</p>
<p>I have reflected, but I cannot see the necessity. If the
intention of the regulation was to prevent the escape of
convicts, the Report of the Commissioner of Inquiry into the
colony records only one instance of such an attempt, and that was
by a party of fifteen, in search of a supposed Dutch settlement
on the west coast, who overpowered the guard, and wandered in the
ravines of the mountains for five days, having nothing to eat but
the provisions they had brought with them, till they were taken.
Fugitives for the purpose of bushranging would not have crossed
the mountains where there were no settlers to plunder. The fact
is, that the transalpine country was treated by Governor
Macquarie like a gold or diamond mine, and reserved till
government should be pleased to use it itself. Some of the wild
ill-bred cattle of the crown were sent into the manger to play
the part of dog; and the consequence is, that many have now
strayed away hundreds of miles on the Lachlan River and to the
north of Bathurst, and will spoil the improved breeds of the
transalpine settlers for ever, just as the two bulls and five
cows, which strayed away from the Port Jackson camp in the year
1788, and were discovered at the Cow Pastures in 1795, have, in
the persons of their innumerable wild progeny, adulterated the
fine breed of Mr. M'Arthur. It is high time that effectual
measures should be taken to eradicate these animals from the face
of the country. Some from the Cow Pastures have been caught for
the government stores; but as they lose all their flesh in taming
for the slaughter-house, they had better be shot in the woods,
and salted down on the spot, if that will pay the expenses of men
and horses to hunt them. They used to be preserved politically,
under a notion that they would always be a resource against
famine; but the colony has long got beyond all danger of that
kind, and they now merely serve to seduce away some and debase
the breed of others of the settlers' better stock, and to hold
out a temptation to the many convicts, who have a passion for a
bush-ranging life, to commit a capital crime by stealing the
calves.</p>
<p>The country which I rode over to-day is of the same
description as that of yesterday. Saw hundreds of ducks in the
streams, black, musk and wood-ducks; also another pair of native
companions; and quails, snipes, cockatoos, parrots and
parrakeets, without number.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 17<i>th October</i>. Still settled fine
weather. Bode to the stock-locations of two more cisalpine
settlers, ten miles to the westward, and back. All fine grazing
country for both cattle and sheep, but more swampy than this
station, from the circumstance of the waters not being drained by
creeks.</p>
<p>Saw this day the first and only kangaroo. These
stock-settlements are great enemies to this beautiful and unique
species of game. The stockmen hunt them, and the cattle and sheep
supplant them. In a few years, the kangaroo will be as rare as
"the native burghers of this desert city" themselves. So the
beaver and wild deer of North America are becoming extinct; and
thus is man necessarily advanced from the hunter to the pastoral
state. And these stock-keepers will be the best and cheapest
explorers of the country. The great graziers are obliged each to
go beyond the other;** so that, in no long time, the land on the
banks of the Macquarie being chiefly good pasture, it will be
certainly known whether there is any channel out of the
shoal-lake, in which Mr. Oxley found that river to
terminate.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Cox has already formed a station seventy
miles to the north of Bathurst, and Mr. Cunningham, the botanical
collector for Kew Gardens, has discovered and ably laid down a
fine tract of country, abounding in well-watered plains and
good-timbered land, still farmer to the north of that settlement,
and a pass, through a ridge of mountains which stretch east and
west, to Liverpool Plains, discovered by Mr. Oxley in 1818. This
latitudinal dividing range is situated on the other side of a
stream, named by Mr. Lawson, who last year failed in his attempt
to make Liverpool Plains, the Goulburn, and in many parts the
mountains resemble the Blue Mountain ranges. The pass will be
found to the NW. of the Goulburn; and Mr. Cunningham has marked
trees from his last encampment, twelve miles north, through it,
to the southern large link of the chain of Liverpool Plains,
which extend NNW. forty-five miles at least, being bounded only
by a faint blue horizontal line at that bearing. Thus has Mr.
Cunningham effected a clear, interesting, well-marked route for
the grazier to Liverpool Plains from Bathurst, which he estimates
at 140 miles throughout its course, in the discovery of which the
spring heads of the Coal River streams, as well as the country
above Mr. Howe's track W. and NW. have been examined.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Government has, since this was written,
formed a small establishment of convicts at Wellington Valley on
the river Macquarie, eighty miles beyond Bathurst; but nothing
can be expected from the incapacity of its commandant.]</p>
<p>Returned by the huts of a sheep-location, and found them
deserted by reason of a recent plunder on the part of the native
Indians. These, and a few accidents more serious, will happen
till the natives become mere domesticated among the settlers
themselves (their servants don't know how to treat them); but
their thefts are generally confined to a tomahawk or an axe, the
temptation of possessing which is too irresistible for black
human nature. But the aborigines of this new country very rarely
appear in combined numbers; and are easily scared by guns,
horses, or even English dogs*.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By the latest intelligence from the colony
(16th August, 1824) it appears that the natives of Bathurst have
been for more than two months in a state of hostility with the
settlers, insomuch that martial law was about to be proclaimed.
Temporary quiet (says my reverend correspondent) may thus be
restored; but in order to establish a permanent peace, a
missionary is necessary. In this opinion I entirely concur, and
earnestly recommend the measure to the Church Missionary Society.
The natives would gladly receive one, and would be flattered by
his constant communion. I do not promise that they would be
civilized or christianized, but they would certainly be
conciliated and humanized: and, at least, a right understanding
would be brought about between the savage hunter and the
half-savage stock-keeper,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"This child but half knows it,
and that not at all."</p>
<p class="foot">It will be to be regretted if the local
government adopt violent measures. One of my letters attributes
the commencement of these hostilities to a similar mistake on the
part of the new commandant of Bathurst, who imprisoned one of the
chief savages in irons for a month, for some offence, and then
turned him loose to his revenge.]</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 18<i>th October</i>. Cloudy and windy morning,
but the rain kept off for the day. Returned to Bathurst, by a
shorter route, through another of Evans's Plains, to the westward
of Queen Charlotte's Valley. The first half of this division was
highly romantic, the creek winding at the base of hills through
large, scattered and piled masses of rock, forming little falls
and strong ripples. The second half lay over Evans's clear
plain;&mdash;a fine country, but not so well watered or so
beautiful as Queen Charlotte's Valley. Dined at a large settler's
farm, on the other side of the Macquarie River, near Bathurst
There was an English air of neatness about the homesteads and
paddocks. Some of these were matted with English grasses, and
stocked with fine-woolled sheep, and lambs as big as sheep.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 19<i>th October</i>. The rain came on to-day,
and kept me under canvas.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 20<i>th October</i>. Still rainy and windy. The
principal chaplain again performed divine service, to a
congregation of about an hundred people, and preached an
excellent extempore sermon.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 21<i>st October</i>. Cloudy, windy and cold,
with squalls of hail. Departed from Bathurst, on my homeward
journey at nine o'clock, <i>a.m.</i> and arrived at Sidmouth
Valley in good time (twenty-four miles). The hills, which shut
this valley in, are really picturesque in their outline and
shadows,&mdash;lightly wooded to the top, showing there like a
fringe. This farm is watered by a swampy creek from the Fish
River. I returned hither by a different and longer route than
through O'Connell Plains, namely, without crossing the Macquarie
River, over the Campbell River (Governor Macquarie's seventh
encampment). This is a rapid stream, running through a beautiful
country, on which Lieutenant Lawson, the present commandant of
Bathurst, has a farm. The Campbell and Fish Rivers together form
the Macquarie; but (strange to say) the latter is scarcely so
large as the Fish River alone. The Campbell can never lay claim
to the "very considerable magnitude" that Governor Macquarie
assigns to it; but a great quantity of water runs through them
all somewhither. Stranger still that it should all end in a vast
swamp!</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 22<i>d October</i>. Fine weather
again&mdash;clouds passing away. Proceeded at nine o'clock,
<i>a.m.</i>, and arrived at six, <i>p.m.</i> at Cox's River
(twenty-three miles)&mdash;a delightful botanical and picturesque
encampment. Found the stream pretty full and rapid, from the late
rains, as was also the Fish River, which we passed on this day.
There is a corporal's party of the 48th regiment stationed here,
as well as at Spring Wood.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 23<i>d October</i>. Clear night, with heavy
dew, hoar-frosted in the beautiful morning. Found a fifth
creeping grevillea here. Rode to a waterfall a mile up the river;
but there is no height for the water to fall from, and the fresh
was not so great as the hollow rocks seemed to indicate it
sometimes is. It was late before I proceeded, and we were obliged
to unlade the cart in ascending Mount York, so that the sun set
when we arrived at about the thirty-seventh mile-tree from the
Nepean (eighteen miles and a half), and encamped at a place
called Marsden's Valley, from the circumstance of that
gentleman's having lost some cattle here, as they were being
driven over the mountains.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"And lose a substance to preserve
a name."</p>
<p>I found the grevillea acanthifolia in the swamp at Blackheath,
and also at the watering-place in this valley. Admired the view
of Pitt's Amphitheatre from this side of Blackheath much more
than before. The sun was declining at the back of it; and the
shade softened its monotonous harsh bosom ("stern, rugged nurse")
into misty blue or mountain grey. There is a bold rocky hill for
the fore-ground; and Cox's River was seen winding in the arena of
the amphitheatre in several places. This river has been traced
into the Nepean by the Warragumba. Altogether the effect of this
day's journey, on a clear afternoon, was much finer than I
thought it, when I was outward bound on a sultry day. Thomas
Moore may be of a different opinion, but (for me) I prefer
"evening's best light" to the "wild freshness of morning."</p>
<p>A mild, calm, moonlight evening.</p>
<p>The telopea speciocissima, xanthorrh&oelig;a hastile, the
common banksiæ, and many other Port Jackson plants, end exactly
at Mount York, the last of the Blue Mountain Range; and there is
a visible change in the botany and geology from cisalpine to
transalpine.</p>
<p>Good water, but little grass at this encampment: but there is
no grass on the whole road over the mountains, whatever Governor
Macquarie may say about "the traveller's assuring himself of good
grass at all <i>his</i> encampments"&mdash;nothing but rocks, and
stones, and trees, and flowers:&mdash;yes, there is water enough.
The traveller must therefore take corn for his horses with
him.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 24<i>th October</i>. Last night the wind rose
high and roared among the trees, till I thought some of them
would fall upon the tent. Morning cloudy and
windy&mdash;afternoon calm and close. Set out in good time, and
arrived at Spring Wood considerably before sunset (twenty-four
miles and a half). Made two diversions from the road: one to
Pulpit Hill (by which the old road passed), a hill crowned by a
rock, more like an elbow-chair, a cathedra than a rostrum; and
the other along the stream, through the swamp called Jamison's
Valley, to a small cascade below the King's Table-land. The fall
was not worth seeing;&mdash;a falling off even from Cox's fall.
The water, being small now, only slid down a sloping rock; and
even after rains, the step is so short that nothing can be made
of it. The scenery is very barren, and the ground very boggy. The
most curious thing is the red, shealing, cylindrical,
honey-combed nature of the sandstone-rock in the cliffs above and
along the stream. But I am since told, that I did not go far
enough to see the chasm or fissure in the rock, down the
precipice of which there is a slender waterfall of great height
(a thousand feet, according to Governor Macquarie's notions),
which he called Campbell's Cataract; and that the whole of the
table-land next to this chasm appears as if it had undergone a
violent volcanic eruption; the stones seem to have been once in a
state of fusion, are formed into masses, and have the appearance
of melted sand and iron-stone. I found the grevillea acanthifolia
in this stream also. The King's Table-land should be called the
Mountain-pass Ridge. It is the only passage that Messieurs
Blaxland. Wentworth and Lawson could have effected. This day was
not clear; and though Pitt's Amphitheatre had the benefit of a
mist, yet the fine distant view from this elevation of Windsor,
Prospect Hill and the Colony, was lost in the hazy horizon.</p>
<p>Spring Wood, which I was too late in my outward journey to
see, appeared to-day a fine forest of tall trees, with some
little grass between, after the barren dwarf-treed, underwooded,
shrubberries, to which I had been accustomed on the mountains.
The spring runs at the foot of a picturesque rocky dingle, about
a mile off.</p>
<p>The telopea was now in even finer bloom than on my outward
journey; and I should not have omitted to mention the many large
ant-hills of small ants which occur on the mountains. They are
built of fine clay, and, like hay-cocks, are five or six feet
high.* If you damage one on your way out, you will find the
industrious society will have repaired it by your return. They
are perfectly different from the iron-stone gravel formicatories
of the large ants of the country on the other side of the Nepean.
By the way, some of these cisalpine ants, which make their nests
under ground, frame little round clay lids to their entrances,
with which they close the holes in wet weather.</p>
<p class="foot">[* My friend Mr. Swainson, who is matter of
almost every branch of natural history, informs me that this is
doubtless a new species of tomes, and that the white ants of
Africa build their nests precisely in the same way.]</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 25<i>th October</i>. The rain came in the night
with wind. Took my final departure this morning, and reached home
soon after noon, having travelled 300 miles in less than three
weeks. It now only remains for me to express my thorough
satisfaction, that this fine transalpine country will be the
making of the colony of New South Wales, and will give it a
decided superiority over that of Van Diemen's Land. "The general
description of these heretofore unexplored regions (says Governor
Macquarie) given by Mr. Evans (himself the deputy surveyor of Van
Diemen's Land), is, that they very far surpass in beauty and
fertility of soil any that he has seen in New South Wales or Van
Diemen's Land." If they had not been discovered, grassing, from
which alone the state can derive an export, must have come to a
stop. Here is an opening for English emigrants for centuries; and
I have not a doubt that, in spite of the want of navigable
rivers, New Holland will be a second America. True the mountain
road is very difficult, but the track to Bathurst, to the
southward, by way of the cow-pastures, is much longer, and in
many parts (I am told) as bad, Mr. Cox's original road, across
the mountain-ridge, has been already greatly improved in many
places by Mr. Lawson; and a man, who has been long the overseer
of the road-gang at Cox's Pass, and whose name ought to be
mentioned (George Palmer), offers to avoid that pass, and save
ten miles, with the twelve months labour of forty convicts. It is
also said, that a shorter road has been projected from
Richmond;** and, after all, if the sheep be brought to be and
shorn at Cox's River; and a canal of twenty miles be cut from Emu
ford to the head of the Paramatta river, there will be only 56
miles of land-carriage, which the wool will well repay; and, in
the opinion of some well-informed colonists, such a
junction-canal would drain off any future flood in the Hawkesbury
and Nepean rivers. It is fervently to be hoped that the present
local government will feel the real value of this new country,
and the public importance of improving every access to it.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Since this was written, Mr. Archibald Bell,
jun. of Richmond Hill, has, after one unsuccessful attempt,
effected a passage from that part of the country to Cox's River,
which as the pass across the mountains trends so much to the
northward, will not only be the readiest route tram the
Hawkesbury and Hunter's River, but will be as near from
Paramatta, as the old road over the mountains by way of Emu ford,
and infinitely less difficult and sterile. Mr. Bell is entitled
to the sole merit of this discovery, and the route has since been
surveyed by a gentleman from the surveyor general's office. Mr.
Bell travelled N.W. from Richmond, about 14 miles to Picture
Hill, and thence due W. to Tomah, which is a round hill seen on
the right from the Burnt Weather-boarded Hut on the Bathurst
road. On going W. about half-way up this mountain, he turned to
the S. and after proceeding about a mile in that direction, found
an excellent passage down it. He then proceeded round the side of
an opposite hill, about a mile and a half in a W.S.W. direction,
and then bore W. for the remainder of the day, and N.W. the next
day, till he reached Cox's River. He found no rocky ground till
after leaving Tomah, and the whole distance of it did not then
exceed eight or nine miles. The greatest difficulty he had to
contend with was the thick brush in the first put of his way to
Tomah, so much so, tint in one place he was forced to cut his way
through three miles. He left a good track all the way he went,
and was never obliged to unlade his baggage-horses. The whole of
Mount Tomah is covered with ash and sassafras treat, of a
prodigious size. It is only after leaving Tomah that the country
assumes, for five miles, the appearance of the Bathurst road in
point of grass; but even far that space, the feed is better than
near the Weather-boarded Hut on that road. After that distance,
excellent grass continues with little variation for the rest of
the way; and there is plenty of water the whole way. The distance
of this route from Richmond to Cox's River may be estimated at
about 35 miles.]</p>
<p>If this matter were put into the hands of the
surveyor-general, and two or three commissioners, of whom Mr.
Lawson should of course be one, the expense to the crown of the
labour required from convicts might be greatly lightened; and
individual subscription, or toll, would be cheerfully contributed
to so good and great a public work. It is quite clear, from his
shutting it up, that Governor Macquarie never saw this country in
its proper light, but was only vain of the sound of it, as
connected in all possible changes, with every branch of his name.
From the physical science and political economy of the present
local government, better things are expected. If free emigration
is to be encouraged hither, at Bathurst the settler may
immediately live upon the fat of the land, and in time export his
fine wool. But then the wool of New South Wales must, upon its
importation into England, be exempted from the duty on foreign
wool.* The policy of this exemption is, at least, as old as
Bacon, who in his Essay upon Colonization, says, "Let there be
freedom from custom, till the plantation be of strength; and not
only freedom from custom, but freedom to carry their commodities
where they may make the best of them." If Great Britain wishes
her colonies to consume her manufactures, she must not drive
them, by heavy duties on the export of their raw material, to
manufacture for themselves.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Since this was written, the duty on Australian
wool has been reduced for ten years to one penny per lb. by
statute of 3 Geo. IV. c. 96, s. 6. but as other foreign wool has
been since put on a level with it, the argument is still good for
the abrogation of this penny.]</p>
<p>If convicts are still to be transported hither, the only
chance of their reformation consists in scattering them widely
over the country, and giving them pastoral habits. Convict
transportation is but a bad system of colonisation; and Governor
Macquarie, by his preference of the convict to the free, made it
worse for the plantation, and totally inoperative as the penalty
of felony, or the penitentiary of vice. "It is a shameful and
unblessed thing (says the wise man just quoted) to take the scum
of people, and wicked, condemned men, to be the people with whom
you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth the plantation; for
they will ever live like rogues, and not fell to work, but be
lazy and do mischief, and spend victuals, and be quickly weary,
and then certify over to their country, to the discredit of the
plantation." The evils and expense of the transportation-system
would certainly be lessened, by placing the convicts more in the
service of farming and grazing settlers, out of the reach of the
temptations and evil communications of great towns, the
establishment of which was too much the policy of the late
governor. The solitary life of a shepherd, or a stockman, would
gradually soften the heart of the most hardened convict; but
instead of this, Governor Macquarie's system was to keep them
congregated in barracks, and employed at a ration of a pound and
a half of meat, and the same quantity of flour, <i>per diem</i>,
upon showy public buildings, many of them works al mere
supererogation. Of wretches possessed of no better means of
reformation than these, it could not be expected that industrious
colonists should ever be made. When their period of
transportation expired, or was remitted by favour, they would,
therefore, take their grant of land, and allowances for settling,
and sell them the next hour for spirits. It is true that this was
abuse, but it was an abuse inseparable from such bad policy; and,
perhaps, the best criterion for estimating policy is to say that
that is good which is open to few, and that bad which is exposed
to many, abuses. If government will encourage a better system of
colonization, New Holland will soon be a happy and thriving
province; for, with such a climate and soil, and so many
Englishmen as it contains already, thriving and happy it will be
sooner or later. Eventually, no doubt, from its distance from the
parent country, and its extent in itself, it will be an
independent state; and the same mountains, which now obstruct the
passage of the colonists, will be an impenetrable barrier to a
foreign foe, should such an one ever cast an envious eye upon the
colony of New South Wales. Of a parent foe, after the warning of
America, I will not suffer myself to contemplate the possibility;
and I am sincere and sanguine in my hopes, that the enlightened
eye of that parent will see the public policy of encouraging free
emigration to the fine country beyond the Blue Mountains of New
South Wales.</p>
<p>It may give weight to the above observations to add, that the
writer of this journal has himself no intention of occupying land
or settling in that country, and is possessed of no more sheep
than a pastoral poet. Non hic colonus domicilium habeo; sed,
topiarii in morem, hinc inde florem vellico, ut canis Nilum
lambens.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h4>JOURNAL OF AN EXCURSION TO THE FIVE ISLANDS AND<br>
SHOAL HAVEN, ON THE COAST OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>
<p><i>Saturday, October</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1823.&mdash;Rode
from the neighbourhood of Liverpool, through the district of
Airds (in which are the small church and court-room of Campbell
Town), to Appin, to breakfast; and thence to Illawarra, or the
Five Islands, to dinner, a distance of sixty miles south of Port
Jackson. The range of the Blue Mountains, which divides the east
coast from the western interior of New South Wales, terminating
with the cliffs of the Five Island coast and Shoal Haven, the
road from Appin presents the same rocky, sterile country, as the
Blue Mountain pass, and the same flora, with the additions of the
doryanthes excelsa, or gigantic lily, and the crinum australe: on
the Five Island beach is also found granite, as at Cox's River.
Passed the source of the Nepean River, forming a small cataract,
under which the stream hides itself in a picturesque glen; and,
indeed, it afterwards finds a subterraneous passage through the
sandy rocks to the Cow Pastures. The descent from this range of
mountains to the sea-shore is very precipitous, grand, and even
tropically luxuriant in point of vegetation. Here may be seen,
for the first time in this colony, the cabbage palm (corypha
australis) towering above all the trees of the forest, to the
height sometimes of 100 feet, with its bunches of leaves only at
the top, flabelliform, peltate, round, and fan-like. These trees
once also characterized the neighbourhood of Port Jackson; but
they haye long been exhausted, the spungy trunks having been used
for splitting into hut-logs, and the large leaves for thatch; for
thus simply were even the officers of the first fleet, the
Romuluses of the colony, lodged. The absence of these trees has
taken away much from the tropical character of Sydney, which can
only be restored by the garden-cultivation of them, together with
the banana and the New Zealand bamboo, for the climate is not hot
enough for the cocoa-nut. The jungle sides of this Illawarra
Mountain were also enriched with the arborescent fern (alsophila
australis), the trunk of which, not growing so tall as the palm,
lifted none of the beauty of its large feathery leaves out of the
reach of our sight.</p>
<p>These rare productions of the vegetable kingdom are, in all
other countries, strictly tropical; and these "weeds of glorious
feature" have no business beyond the latitude of 23½° from the
equator, and yet here they are in 34½°. But this is New Holland,
where it is summer with us when it is winter in Europe, and
<i>vice versâ</i>; where the barometer rises before bad weather,
and falls before good; where the north is the hot wind, and the
south the cold; where the humblest house is fitted up with cedar
(cedrela toona, according to Mr. Brown); where the fields are
fenced with mahogany (eucalyptus robusta), and myrtle trees
(myrtaceæ) are burnt for fire-wood; where the swans are black and
the eagles white; where the kangaroo, an animal between the
squirrel and the deer, has five claws on its fore-paws, and three
talons on its hind-legs, like a bird, and yet hops on its tail;
where the mole (ornithorhynchus paradoxus) lays eggs, and has a
duck's bill; where there is a bird (meliphaga) with a broom in
its mouth instead of a tongue; where there is a fish, one-half
belonging to the genus raia, and the other to that of squalus;
where the pears are made of wood (xylomelum pyriforme), with the
stalk at the broader end; and where the cherry (exocarpus
cupressiformis) grows with the stone on the outside.</p>
<p>At the foot of this range of mountains is scattered the red
cedar tree, of which the colonists make their furniture, and with
which they fit up the insides of their houses. It is a genus of
cedreleæ, allied to flindersia, according to Mr. Cunningham. The
procuring of this timber occupies many sawyers and boatmen from
Port Jackson. The cedar planks, as they are formed by sawyers at
the pit, are carried on men's backs up to the mountain summit,
whence carts (approaching by a narrow road cut through the forest
on the ridge) convey the planks to all parts of the colony, or
they are carted to the shores of Illawarra, and navigated to Port
Jackson in large open boats. The government has not (by reason of
its ample supply from Hunter's River and Port Macquarie) secured
any portion of these cedar grounds to itself, simply compelling
each person to take out a permit from the colonial secretary's
office, which must specify the number of feet of timber required,
and without which protection, the horse and cart, or boat, and
the cedar, are liable to seizure by any constable. In a new run
in the wild forest, the sawyers have to perform the preparatory
labour of clearing their path, and a fell for the trees, which
would otherwise be prevented from reaching the ground by
amazingly strong vines (scandent or volubilous plants). They then
pit the stew, cut into short cylinders of from eight to twelve
feet in length, and saw them into planks of one or two inches
thick. For these they receive of the cartmen 22<i>s</i>. for
every 100 feet, from which sum is to be deducted 6<i>s</i>. per
100, paid to the carrier from the pit to the cart, leaving
16<i>s</i>. to be divided between the pair of sawyers. The
cartmen, after carrying an average load of 300 feet in the plank
upwards of 60 miles to Paramatta, over a road, in part very rocky
and difficult, obtain 45<i>s</i>. or 50<i>s</i>. per 100 feet,
from builders, carpenters, &amp;c. It is to be regretted, that so
few of the timbers that grow on this mountain are known.
Excepting the red Cedar, the wild apple (achras australis), the
plum (cargillia australis), the sassafras (cryptocarya
glaucescens), the rosewood, so called from its scent, not colour
(a genus of meliaceæ *), and the turpentine tree (tristania
albicans), the wood-cutters had no names for the many trees of
gigantic growth which cover this mountain.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quære, trichilia glandulosa?]</p>
<p>Illawarra is a fine district of good gracing, and some
excellent arable, land, close to the sea-shore; insomuch that,
though distant and difficult from Sydney by land, it was settled
in Governor Macquarie's time, when he refused to let anybody go
on the other side of the Nepean. As a marine situation, it is
very beautiful. The Five Islands show like one large and two
small ones, and look picturesque seaward, while the back ground
presents a line of hills, among which the Hat Hill of Captain
Cook and Mount Molle are conspicuous.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 19<i>th October</i>.&mdash;Rested, or only
walked over the miles of Illawarra farm, the property of David
Allan, Esq. late commissary-general of the colony, who had the
merit of setting the example of settling the Five Island
district. The creek ravines still presented a tropical luxuriance
of vegetation&mdash;palms, ferns, and vines, or parasitical
trees, the last festooning and twining their branches in all
directions, and greatly relieving the tall leafless monotony of
the gum-trees. Epidendra also built their nests among them, the
asplenium nidus, the acrostichum alcicorne, and the dendrobium
semulum. There is also a large-leaved tree, the slightest touch
of which brings away hairs like cowhage: it is an undescribed
species of urtica.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 20<i>th October</i>. Rode to Shoal Haven,
thirty-six miles still further to the south, six or seven of
which were through a mass of vegetation, requiring pioneers to
penetrate it. The vines or lianas wreathed the trees, like the boa
constrictor, and festooned the way, as if they were placed for
one of Astley's equestrians to leap from the horse over them, or
hung dangling like the ropes in a belfry. The valley reminded me
of Humboldt's descriptions of South American vegetation. The
ground was unequal, to boot; so that travelling through the
jungle was extremely difficult and fatiguing. Here we first saw
the seaforthia elegans, a palm equal in size to the cabbage-tree,
with pinnate, ferny, or cocoa-nut leaves, from whose broad
membranous leaf-stalks, or the spathæ of the flowers, the natives
make their water-buckets, simply by tying up each end, like their
bark canoes; in the same manner the dairy farmers make milk-pails
and cream-pans; and of the leaves they make hats and
thatch;&mdash;the cedar, both white and red; and another smaller
fern-leaved palm-tree, yet undescribed, of great beauty, its
trunk more ligneous, and its leaves more palmy than the common
arborescent fern. Our way through the dark dingle crossed the
same fresh-water creek fifteen times. The crinum here
re-appeared, together with a large arum.</p>
<p>In the first part of our journey this day, we crossed the
shallow entrance from the sea of Illawarra Lake, a large opening
a little to the south of the Tom Thumb's lagoon of Captain
Flinders. The lake was illustrated by natives in their canoes,
looking very characteristic and beautiful, now that the progress
of English civilization has disarmed this part of the coast of
those savage dangers with which it threatened Captain Flinders
and Mr. Bass, when they were here in the Tom Thumb open boat. The
view was so picturesque&mdash;the lake, the hills, and the
Indians, "the spirit of them all",&mdash;as to deserve a painter.
Our route admitted of two or three long gallops along the sands,
which afforded great reliefs to the tedium of the forest-paths
and the fatigue of the jungle. Although we set out almost at
sun-rise, yet it was nearly sun-set before we arrived at Shoal
Haven, where Mr. Alexander Berry has taken his grant of land on
either side of the Shoal Haven river. This is the gentleman who
first learnt at New Zealand the fate of the ship Boyd, which was
cut off by the savages in the year 1809, and who brought away the
very few survivors of that massacre.** He has, since his final
settling in this colony, explored the geology of this coast with
great ardour, from Port Stephens to Jervis's Bay, and read before
the Philosophical Society of the colony an excellent paper upon
the subject.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Constable's Edinburgh Magazine, vol. ii. p.
403.]</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 2l<i>st October</i>. Ascended with Mr. Berry
the mountain called by the natives Coolingatta, under which he is
building his house. From this considerable, but well-grassed
eminence, we saw, as in a map, the sea, the river, and the coast,
from Cape George, which is the south head of Jervis's Bay, to
Black Head or Point Bass of Captain Flinders, a fine point of
grazing land (some of it naturally clear), which we had passed in
our way the day before, including Bowen Island off the bay, Crook
Haven (the Shoal Haven of the charts) and Shoal Haven River. The
mist prevented us from seeing the Pigeon-house Hill of Captain
Cook, still further to the southward. The entrance of Shoal Haven
River from the sea is dangerous even for boats, and that of Crook
Haven, three miles to the southward, or the real Shoal Haven of
Flinders, is not very safe. One of the arms of Shoal Haven is
separated from Shoal Haven River by an isthmus not a hundred and
fifty yards broad; and across this Mr. Berry has cut a canal,
being the first canal in Australia. "The land at the back of
Shoal Haven (says he), and south of the river, is low and swampy,
so as in some places to be incapable of producing trees. There
is, however, a more elevated border along the immediate bank of
the river;" and this he has cultivated. He has been up the river
more than twenty miles, when he was stopped by a long rapid. At
this place the river was about a hundred and fifty yards wide,
and was flowing perhaps double that distance over small
water-worn stones, which it hardly covered. The tide flows thus
far, which may be considered the termination of the inland
navigation. So much for Shoal Haven River. Although I am afraid
that these grants of land will hardly ever repay Messrs. Berry
and Wollstonecraft for their out-lay upon them, yet whoever
extends the settling of New South Wales further than any body has
gone before him is a benefactor to the colony. I am afraid, in
this case, that man has taken possession before Nature has done
her work. Immense swamps and lagoons have only been just left by
the sea, and the forest land is yet indifferent for grazing; but,
though the cedar grounds end before Shoal Haven, the sea is open
for any exportable produce that can be raised on patches of
alluvial soil, on the alternate projecting points of the river;
and Mr. Berry need not be alarmed lest any occupation of the
immediate back country should shut in his cattle-run.</p>
<p>Returned to Illawarra this day, though very rainy and stormy.
Overtook some natives, the women (as is usual among all savages)
carrying the children and baggage, and the men nothing but a
spear and a firebrand. The men led our horses through the
difficulties, while we dismounted, and both men and women kept up
with our horses a whole stage, upon the promise of sharing our
luncheon at the end of it.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 22<i>d October</i>. Rested this morning, and
in the evening went to see the natives fish by torchlight. They
make torches of bundles of bark, beaten and tied up, and with the
light of these scare the bream into motion that lie among the
rocky shallows, when they either spear them with the fiz-gig, or
drag them from under their hiding-places with the hand, bite
their heads, and throw them high and dry on the shore. The sight
is very novel and picturesque&mdash;the torch being flashed in
one hand and the spear poised in the other&mdash;though there
were but few natives here at this time, the majority being absent
feasting upon a whale which chance had thrown upon the coast. The
Indians, however, by no means attribute this to chance, but to
the kind providence of the spirits of their fathers, whom they
believe to be transformed into porpoises (dolphins) after death,
like Bacchus's pirates in Homer, and who, in that shape, drive
the whales on shore. With this view, the natives obsecrate the
porpoises by songs, when they see them rolling. I found also that
the aborigines of New Holland were strictly divided into two
classes, the hunters and the fishers; and that they did not date
to encroach upon each other's mode of gaining a livelihood. Red
Point of Captain Cook was the scene of our torch-fishing. Much of
the rock was flat, and veined in squares, as if it had been
paved, seemingly the effect of iron and fusion. Captain Flinders
says, the cause of its being named Red Point escaped his and Mr.
Bass's notice, but it was plain to us that the iron gave it a
reddish appearance.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 23<i>d October</i>. Returned to the
neighbourhood of Liverpool this day, though very showery. The
ascent of the Illawarra Mountain was very steep and difficult,
the worse for the rain that had fallen. We were obliged to climb
dismounted. The hill appeared to me worse than the pass up Mount
York on the Bathurst road; but the route that avoids it is not
preferred.</p>
<p>So much for the country of Camden, which contains the
celebrated Cow Pastures of New South Wales, and is full of
excellent grazing land, at the back of the mountain ridge, and
well watered, which Governor Macquarie's good agricultural
districts of Appin and Airds are certainly not. The country at
the back of that is called by Mr. Berry "the verdant,
well-watered, and very, desirable pastoral district of
Argyleshire."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>NARRATIVE OF A VOYAGE FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>
<p>I embarked for England on the 4th of February, 1824, and
sailed from the heads of Port Jackson with a south-east wind,
which continued more or less fool till the evening of the 12th,
when it came round to the north-west.</p>
<p>On the two following days we saw flying-fish, though our
latitude on the last of them was 37° 22', which is a higher
southern parallel than this tropical animal was perhaps ever seen
in before. We had the wind now from the southward, and next from
the westward, as it prevails in these latitudes at this season,
and as we wished it to be for the purpose of making an eastern
passage home round Cape Horn. But the wind being right aft, with
a heavy sea, caused a great rolling of the ship.</p>
<p>On the 18th Captain Cook's Strait between the two islands of
New Zealand was in sight, and we passed Cape Farewell in the
course of the day, and were at night off the Brothers. It was
calm in the night, and the strait being so narrow that we could
see the land on both sides, the sea was smooth and the ship
steady in the day. The land we saw consisted of barren hills or
sand. We observed no signs of inhabitancy. These are not the
fertile parts of New Zealand. The mountains were even topt with
sand, which we at first took for snow.</p>
<p>The next day Entry Island was in sight, and we passed through
the strait; and on the following day, we left New Zealand out of
sight. Having cleared the land, the sea ran high, and the ship's
rolling became heavy again.</p>
<p>On the 21st we crossed the longitude of 180°, and entered the
western hemisphere, as it may strictly be called, though the maps
do not divide till 20° more; but having lived more than seven
years in the eastern hemisphere, one is anxious to forestal a
change.</p>
<p>On the 25th albatrosses were numerous, and on the 26th stormy
petrels. On the 28th we saw eight of the former swimming, which
they seldom do, and on the 29th the latter were in great
variety.</p>
<p>From this time to the 17th March the weather was generally wet
and windy, and the vessel being very deeply laden and uneasy,
shipped the salt water almost constantly; so that we were
imprisoned in our cabins, which were necessarily darkened. This
was the worst of doubling Cape Horn; for on the 28th of March,
the day on which we actually passed the longitude of it, and left
the Pacific for the Atlantic ocean, the weather was fine, and the
ship steady; and the next day the sea was calm and the sky
beautiful, with Staten Island in sight twelve leagues to the
north, looking even green. So was it fine weather for the three
following days, but on the last of these the wind came foul.</p>
<p>On the day we doubled Cape Horn, we met a ship about five
miles off: the thermometer at this time stood at 44°, being the
lowest fall on the voyage.</p>
<p>On the 25th came heavy rain with a squally night, and the sea
being against the wind caused a great rolling and pitching of the
ship. So the deck was generally wet and our cabin dark again till
the 4th day of April, when the dead lights were removed for good;
and the worst of our passage was over.</p>
<p>This week we made two Thursdays&mdash;in order to accommodate
our reckoning to that of this hemisphere, having gained a
revolution of the earth, by going back to the sun round the
world&mdash;two first days of April; so that this being
leap-year, I shall have lived 367 days in one year, a thing which
few people can understand, and still fewer say. If the Emperor
Titus had been up to this, he might have indemnified himself for
his celebrated loss.</p>
<p>On the 5th day of April, the thermometer stood at 75°, being a
change of 30° in a fortnight.</p>
<p>On the 12th we were so fortunate as to meet his Majesty's ship
Tamar, Captain Bremer, bound from England to New South Wales:
this was the only vessel we visited during the whole passage, we
being bound from New South Wales to England, and a man of war not
having sailed from England to New South Wales for twenty years
before. An old acquaintance of mine, an officer of the ship,
boarded us, and gave us a few newspapers of January and February
last, which we should not have seen in New South Wales for three
months more. Here be fruits! first profits of the voyage
home!</p>
<p>The Tamar was bound to New South Wales on secret service; but
on my arrival in England, I found the secret very well known to
be the intended establishment of a commercial factory at Port
Essington, a discovery of Captain King of His Majesty's surveying
service, on the north coast of Australia. The treaty with Holland
having shut us out of all the islands of the Indian Archipelago,
into which British goods are not admitted by the Dutch without
payment of a very high duty, our government has, by assisting in
the formation of this factory, anticipated any foreign occupancy
of this part of the Australian coast, from whence the Malays, who
visit it every year from Macassar to fish for trepang for the
China market, may be supplied with our manufactured goods. It is
hoped that the Malays will soon induce Chinese emigrants to
settle at Port Essington, and keep up this trade in British
goods. The port lies very handy, not only for the Moluccas, but
for the Caroline and Philippine Islands, and even for China.</p>
<p>On the same day on which we met the Tamar, we crossed the
tropic of Capricorn; and I saw the Great Bear again for the first
time for more than seven years:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem" style="text-indent: 8%;">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; The northern team,<br>
And great Orion's more refulgent beam,<br>
To which around the axle of the sky<br>
The Bear revolving points his golden eye,<br>
Who shines exalted on th' ethereal plain,<br>
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.</p>
<p>On the 15th we met a brig ten miles off, and on the 17th
another standing to the south-west. These were proofs of our
drawing towards the coast of Brazil; and on the 20th the land was
in sight, the city of St. Salvador in the Brazilian province of
Bahia, latitude 12° 59 9 longitude 38° 28', according to one
reckoning; 38° 21', according to another. Two ships were in
sight, also standing for the harbour of Bahia; and in the
afternoon we came to anchor there.</p>
<p>We found Bahia in the possession of the Brazilians, and the
Portuguese either expelled or hiding themselves. The Brazilians
of the coast are not such finely made men as the negroes of this
province, who are celebrated for the beauty of their figures; but
the South Americans, notwithstanding the diminutiveness of their
forms, will be a great people,&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"A little body with a mighty
heart."</p>
<p>The very children in the streets are singing
<i>Liberty</i>.</p>
<p>The imperial flag was hoisted on the fort, and flying on the
ships of war. I wish they had chosen a prettier mixture of
colours. They are light green and yellow, with an unmeaning coat
of arms.</p>
<p>I went on shore this evening, and called, as is the etiquette,
upon the British consul, who lives at Vittoria, in the upper or
new town, on Cape St. Antonio, on which is another fort. This is
almost entirely an English settlement, and delightfully situated,
with lanes, at least clean, if not trim, and gardens, or rather
shrubberies, to each house, down to the sea. The mango, and other
tropical trees, struck me with their rich leafiness, after the
barrenness and dryness of Australian foliage. I found the white
cedar, the melia azedarach, or common bead-tree of India, growing
here, as well as at New South Wales; and I particularly admired
the splendour of that species of acacia, called poinciana
pulcherrima, or the Barbadoes flower-fence.</p>
<p>The lower town of Bahia, in which the English merchants have
only compting-houses, is vary close and disgusting, rather from
filth and the manners of the Portuguese, than from the mode of
building; for narrow streets ensure shade, and declivity of
ground commands the sea-breeze every where by its nature, and
would command cleanliness with a very little art. There are many
British merchants and shop-keepers settled here, corresponding
principally with Liverpool. They are, as they are all over the
world, the wealthiest and most respectable people in the place,
and in favour with all parties, royalists, imperialists, and
republicans.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, I went on shore till my ship should sail,
to enjoy the hospitality of my countrymen at Vittoria; for I had
no other claim to it than that of common country, but that was
enough. Mrs. Graham, in her late Voyage to Brazil, repays the
hospitality of the English at Bahia, by saying that "society is
at a low, very low scale here among the English", and that "the
ladies are quite of the second rate even of colonial gentility."
Now, though there are about twenty English merchants here, there
are but six married English ladies, and one single one; and when
Mrs. Graham was here, there was, in exchange for one of these,
the consul's daughter, whom this genteel authoress has the
indelicacy to name at full length. It does not appear that Mrs.
Graham meant to include Miss P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; in her
criticism, but the number of six is too small to scatter censure
harmless among; and one of those six must have been Miss
P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 's married sister, whom Mrs. Graham also
mentions. I can only say that I had the good fortune to be either
more grateful or less fastidious. But I should have thought that
a very small share of gratitude, and a very considerable one of
fastidiousness, might still have left the guest of Mrs.
J&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; entirely satisfied of her unaffected
good-breeding, and of the perfect politeness of such of her few
countrywomen as I had the pleasure of meeting under her roof.</p>
<p>At our consul's house I saw an Indian of the Botocudi (from
the interior of the country) who had been to Vienna to see the
world, and was staying at the consulate, on his way back to his
own tribe. He had a large, round, cake-shaped piece of wood,
inserted in a long slit in his under lip, something like the
natives of the Port des François on the northwest coast of North
America, figured in the Atlas to La Pérouse's Voyage; and a
similar piece in a slit in each ear. I have since learnt that
there was a Botocudi with his wife and child exhibited in London
in the year 1822.</p>
<p>The weather favoured our little <i>relache</i>; and our ship
completed her watering on the 23d of April I had therefore no
time to visit the interior of the country, to which, indeed,
there are no good roads; but I perambulated the city of Bahia
with great diligence, both in caderas, and on horseback. The
streets are too steep for carriages, although the hill on which
the town is built is not 600 feet high (as the books say), but a
little more than 200, <i>teste</i> Captain Sabine. The caderas,
or curtained chairs, which are used as much by gentlemen as by
ladies, are carried obliquely, with only one pole, from the top
of the chair, on the shoulder of each of two negroes, so that
each may see his way before him, and the sitter enjoy the
thorough breeze and see before him too, if he chooses to open the
curtains.</p>
<p>As it was the season of the carnival, and this city was once
the ecclesiastical metropolis of Brazil, we expected to witness
the masquerading holydays of the Roman Catholic religion. But the
revolution had left priests at a heavy discount. We found the
saint-cupboards in the streets shut up; and the carnival was
forbidden by the governor, for fear of political riot.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 25th, I visited the public garden in the fort of
St. Peter, presenting a fine terrace to the sea. I found the
garden neglected, probably in consequence of the late siege of
Bahia by the Brazilians. The remains of an earthwork, thrown up
by their troops, are in the neighbouring square. I copied the
following inscription from an obelisk in the garden,
commemorative of the Prince Regent of Portugal's first landing
here, on the emigration of the royal family from the mother
country. I wonder the Brazilians have not pulled it down.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Joanni<br>

<p>In the afternoon, I re-embarked, refreshed with oranges and
limes (though they kept not long), and pleased with Bahia,
although I did not find it so musical and romantic as Rio de
Janeiro. To be sure, the Portuguese were either away or shut up;
and the indolent guitar was silenced by the trumpet of
freedom.</p>
<p>There is a large opera-house here, and there wad to be a
performance that night; but our countrymen did not speak highly
of Brazilian taste, or of the ripeness of the revolutionists for
elegant amusement</p>
<p>The climate of Bahia is not oppressive to a visitor; but it
must be tiresome to a resident to have the thermometer all the
year round from 75° to 86°. Winter rains induce the lower degree,
and the higher is always relieved by a sea-breeze.</p>
<p>The oranges of Bahia are particularly fine. When the king of
Portugal lived at Rio de Janeiro he would eat no other. They are
seedless in the main core. The seeds are in a little perfect
sub-orange at the top of the other, which gives the fruit
somewhat of a pear-shape, with the seed-chamber divisions
indicated in the rind of this little top-orange. The ant is the
great enemy of this fruit-tree. Its armies will strip an
orange-tree in a night&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Shake down its mellow hangings, nay its
leaves,<br>
And leave it bare to weather.</p>
<p>I saw some of these little animals walking away with large
bits of leaves. No remedy of girthing the trunk with any thing,
however poisonous or offensive, has yet been discovered. They
surmount all difficulties. Fire at night is the only thing that
drives them away for a time.</p>
<p>The only manufactory at Bahia, except that of leather, is of
red pottery. The various water-vessels are peculiarly adapted to
this warm climate, from the porousness of the clay of which they
are made; and the excellent water that is poured from them, after
they have been placed in the sea or land breezes, drinks
deliriously cool.</p>
<p>We sailed from Bahia in the afternoon of the 26th of April
with a south-east wind and showery weather; and so the wind and
weather continued, and prevented us from clearing the land till
the 3d day of May. In addition to this foulness of wind, we now
found a foul ship; for the vessel having been some days stagnant
in harbour, an infernal sulphuric stench came from the hold, and
from the bilge-water, which, attracting the lead from the
salt-water-stained cabin-paint, rendered the between decks, which
were always wet and dirty, perfectly uninhabitable. Was it the
hides of the cargo that generated this horrible smell, and
produced this sulphuretted hydrogen, which, combining with the
oxygen of the paint, formed sulphate of lead? In Mr. White's
Voyage to New South Wales, I find that a similar nautical misery
on board of one of his convict-ships (containing no cargo), is
attributed solely to "the bilge-water, which had risen to so
great a height, that the pannels of the cabin, and the buttons on
the clothes of the officers, were turned nearly black by the
noxious effluvia. When the hatches were taken off (be says, as in
our case), the stench was so powerful, that it was scarcely
possible to stand over them." But this evil was cured by pumping,
whereas, in our ship, the leaky oil-casks seemed constantly to
renew the offensiveness of the bilge-water. The wind being no
longer aft, this odour was blown into the stern cabins for the
rest of the voyage, and rendered the ship more disagreeable in
the trade-winds, than in rounding Cape Horn. Scouring was
useless; the black-lead was soon afterwards reproduced; and
without going so far as to feel a stain (as Burke says) like a
wound, it is not to be conceived by the ladies and gentlemen of
England, who live at home in ease, how distressing is the
constant sense of uncleanness on board of ship. I am told that
this stench and these stains are the consequences of many
cargoes, particularly of sugar: and yet masters of ships (from
pure indifference to every thing but navigation) take no measures
to prevent them, either by the use of unpainted cabin-linings, or
by ventilating the holds. He that cannot eat and drink any thing,
drest in any way, at any time, out of any thing, touched by any
thing, mixed with any thing,&mdash;and this under the sight of
any dirt, the smell of any stench, the sound of any discord, and
the feeling of any motion, should not go to sea. I write this
while I am at sea, because the touch of shore is apt to put to
flight the memory of all these miseries, however keen at the
time; and I am determined to have my revenge of shipboard; and to
tell landsmen what truth will utter, and what sailors will not. I
said I would write a pamphlet against the sea. I am in a mood to
chide the tempest, to rebuke the waves, like King Canute. If my
outward ship was heavy and uneasy, my homeward was heavy, uneasy,
wet, and filthy.</p>
<p>On the day after we left Bahia, the French merchant-ship,
which sailed with us, and the Dutch one, which left the harbour
the day before, were close in sight; and on the next day a brig
was near us, supposed to be an English merchant vessel that
sailed from Bahia on Sunday. On the following morning, the French
ship was close in sight again; and on the next day, a vessel was
still visible.</p>
<p>On the 5th of May, we saw a Portuguese man-of-war, not a ship,
but a species of zoophyta of the medusa kind; and in the evening
we passed the high pyramidical peak of the island of Fernando
Norhonha, distant six or seven leagues to the eastward, rising
like a spire.</p>
<p>On the 8th we crossed the line in the longitude of 32° 30',
and were becalmed for only two days, with rain for only one,
after which we got the north-east trade-wind till the 2d of June,
when we were in the latitude of 35° 55' and in the Florida Gulf
Stream. On the 13th of May the wind was light, with heavy rain
all day; and on the next evening, which was showery, we saw a
lunar nun-bow, a phenomenon which I have witnessed only once
before, and which many people die of old age without seeing.</p>
<p>On the 22d, being in latitude 20° 7', the sun was vertical at
noon, but the thermometer was only 75°. This is a wonderful
sight, and yet thousands, who visit the tropics, notice it not.
Shine, but no sun, till you look over head; and, what is more
awful, like the goblin in the Lay of the last Minstrel,</p>
<p class="poem">Your form no darkling shadow throws<br>
Upon the vessel's deck.</p>
<p>A vertical sun is as much a miracle to an extra-tropical
inhabitant, as snow and ice to an inter-tropical one.</p>
<p>On the next day, at evening, we met a brig; and much sea-weed
was seen all day, supposed to have drifted from the Gulf Stream.
It seemed to be all of one sort, namely the fucus natans.</p>
<p>On the 24th of May, we crossed the tropic of Cancer; and on
that and the three following days the seaweed was very abundant.
When gathered, snail crabs and shrimps came up among it.</p>
<p>On the 30th of May, the wind being light and the weather fair,
we saw half a dozen dolphins, with their ultramarine-blue bodies,
and their orange-green tails; but they would not bite a bait. We
also passed a brig.</p>
<p>Eight weeks have now elapsed, during which we have had the
thermometer standing from 75° to 83°, both night and day. From
this time the heat fell to a common English summer
temperature.</p>
<p>On the next day, which was rainy and cloudy, instead of
dolphins, stormy petrels were very numerous under the stern of
the ship; and on the following day came a strong breeze and a
high sea, producing heavy rolling. We passed a schooner, showing
English colours. The day after, the sea was still high and the
wind fresh at north-west, with heavy rain in the evening, which
latter continued the next day. With the exception of one day we
had now a fair wind, till we entered the English Channel. On the
4th of June we passed a brig, which afterwards overtook and spoke
us; namely, the Nocton Packet, from the island of St. Thomas to
England. On the next day, the wind was stronger, and the ship
more uneasy and wet than ever: we were out of the Gulf Stream,
and on the following morning we passed the islands of Flores and
Corvo, the two north-westernmost of the Azores, or Western
Islands. Flores looked verdant; but Corvo is little better than a
lofty rock: both however are inhabited.</p>
<p>We were now drawing near home, and the converging of outward
and homeward bound vessels. On the 9th day of June we passed a
ship, and on the next day met a large one; on the 13th we met a
brig, and saw two or three other small vessels in the chops of
the Channel. The next day, a vessel was in sight, and the sea was
green, the ship being in soundings. We were out of blue water.
The following morning several vessels were in sight: in the
afternoon we saw the land, Start Point, in Old England; and late
at night we discerned the Portland Lights. On the next day, we
were off Portland and St. Alban's Heads; but the wind was foul; a
mortifying circumstance with home in sight. An Isle of Wight
pilot came on board; and we had that island in sight all day. The
next morning the weather was wet, and the land out of sight. At
noon of the 17th of June we tacked towards England, and made St
Catherine's, on the Isle of Wight, at three o'clock p.m.; when
the wind continuing obstinately foul, I went on shore in a
pilot-boat, and landed at Portsmouth at the same hour the next
morning. The sea was smooth and the sail pleasant. We came round
the Needles, and up the Solent or West Channel of the Isle of
Wight, and as we kept close in shore all the way, the transition
from a sea-voyage to my land-journey up to London was broken by
thus coasting along this beautiful island. And so ends this
tedious journal of a voyage of 131 days at sea!</p>
<p>The boundless ocean! If it be meant to give the effect of a
view of "sea without shore", it is quite a mistake to describe it
as the boundless ocean. It appears to be completely bounded; and
that too at the very short distance of three or four miles, all
around. The melancholy main is in my mind the happiest epithet
that poetry has ever applied to the sea.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">Where all above is sky, and ocean
all around,</p>
<p>sounds very sublime till you get on board of ship; and then
reality gives you a small circle of a dozen tiers of waves all
around, capped with a low dome of sky, about the size of St
Paul's cathedral; for it is a very just observation of Dr. Reid,
"that when the visible horizon is terminated by very distant
objects, the celestial vault seems to be enlarged in all its
dimensions." * It must therefore follow that when the horizon is
bounded by a circle of waves three miles off, the zenith shuts
down over our heads into a smaller segment of a sphere than that
of an apparent hemisphere. But enough of the sea.</p>

The purblind view, which men of this "dim spot"<br>
Can take of <span class="a">Thee</span>, the God of suns and
spheres!<br>
What desert forests, and what barren plains,<br>
Lie unexplor'd by European eye,<br>
In what our fathers call'd <i>the great South Land</i>!<br>
Even in those tracts, which we have visited,<br>
Though thousands of thy vegetative works<br>
Have, by the hand of Science (as 'tis called)<br>
Been murder'd and dissected, press'd and dried,<br>
Till all their blood and beauty are extinct;<br>
And nam'd in barb'rous Latin, men's surnames,<br>
With terminations of the Roman tongue;<br>
Yet tens of thousands have escap'd the search,<br>
The decimation, the alive-impaling,<br>
Nick-naming of <span class="a">God's</span>
creatures&mdash;'scap'd it all.<br>
Still fewer (perhaps none) of all these flowers<br>
Have been by poet sung. Poets are few,<br>
And botanists are many, and good cheap.<br>
When first I landed on Australia's shore,<br>
(I neither botanist nor poet truly,<br>
But less a seeker after facts than truth),<br>
A flower gladden'd me above the rest,<br>
Shap'd trumpet-like, which from a leafy stalk<br>
Hangs clustering, hyacinthine, crimson red<br>
Melting to white. Botanic science calls<br>
The plant <i>epacris grandiflora</i>, gives<br>
Its class, description habitat, then draws<br>
A line. The bard of truth would moralize<br>
The flower's beauty, which ought first my eye;<br>
But, having lived the circle of the year,<br>
I found (and then he'd sing in Beauty's praise)<br>
This the sole plant that never ceas'd to bloom.<br>
Nor here would stop:&mdash;at length first love and fair,<br>
And fair and sweet, and sweet and constant, pall,<br>
(Alas, for poor Humanity!) and then<br>
The new, the pretty, and the unexpected,<br>
Ensnare the fancy. Thus it was with me,<br>
When first I spied the flowret in the grass,<br>
Which forms the subject of this humble song,<br>
And (treason to my wedded flower) cried&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem2">Th' Australian "fringed violet"<br>
Shall henceforward be my pet!<br>

He had not let this touch suffice,<br>
But had pronounced it (I am certain)<br>
Of Juno's eye the "fringed curtain"&mdash;<br>
Pick'd phrase for eye-lid, which the poet<br>
Has us'd elsewhere; and he will know it,<br>
Who in his dramas is well vers'd;<br>
<i>Vide</i> The Tempest, ad the first&mdash;<br>
But I am wandering from ray duty,<br>
First to describe my fringe-ey'd beauty.<br>
'Tis then a floss-edged lilac flower,<br>
That opens only after rain,<br>
Once, and never blows again;<br>
Shuts too at early tuning's hour,<br>
Soon as the sun has lost its power,<br>
Like a fairy's parasol<br>
(If fairies walk by day at all);<br>
Or, it may quicker gain belief,<br>
To call it her silk neckerchief<br>
Dropt before she blest the place<br>
With her last night's dancing grace:<br>
For surely fairies haunt a land,<br>
Where they may have the free command<br>
Of beetles, flowers, butterflies,<br>
Of such enchanting tints and dyes:<br>
Not beetles black (forbidden things),<br>
But beetles of enamel'd wings,<br>
Or rather, coats of armour, boss'd,<br>
And studded till the ground-work's lost:<br>
Then, for all other insects,&mdash;here<br>
Queen Mab would have no cause to fear<br>
For her respectable approach,<br>
Lest she could not set up her coach.<br>
Here's a fine grub for a coach-maker,<br>
Good as in fairy-land Long Acre;<br>
And yery-long-indeed-legg'd spinners,<br>
To make her waggon-spokes, the sinners!<br>
And here are winged grasshoppers;<br>
And, as to gnats for waggoners,<br>

That we are now in her dominion;<br>
Peri or fairies came from th' east,<br>
D'Herbelot tells us so, at least;<br>
And we dream all those self-same dreams,<br>
Which (from Mercutio) it seems<br>
We owe to Mab's deliv'rancy,<br>

Puck talks of putting round the earth,<br>
In forty minutes' time, a girth:<br>
Ob'ron, though he "the groves may tread<br>
Till th' eastern gate, all fiery red,<br>
Open on Neptune with fair beams,<br>
And turn to gold his salt-green streams:"<br>
Yet chooses he, "in silence sad,<br>
To trip after the night's shade:<br>

Swifter than the wand'ring moon:" <a name="FNanchor_22_3" id=

That she has here:&mdash;I've else judg'd wrong.</p>
<p class="poem2">Enough then of the fairies and the flower;<br>
And, as mistaking Puck must sure have squeez'd<br>
The juice of that same little purple flower,<br>

Into my sleeping eyes, to make me change<br>

violet-coloured eye-lids woe attributed by the Greeks to the
Goddess of Beauty, as none of Shakespeare's commentators have
remarked. This charm was artificially created. The first who
practised it was Jezebel (2 Kings, ix. 30). The margin of the
Bible reads, "she put her eyes in antimony." To effect this (says
Mr. Gifford), an impalpable violet-coloured powder was taken up
with a silver needle, and applied to the inner surface of the
lids. This was supposed to give the eye a lascivious lustre
altogether irresistible. From the east, the practice travelled to
Greece and Rome. Anacreon, Ovid, and Juvenal allude to it. At
this day the women of Syria, Arabia, and Babylonia paint their
eyes black.</p>
