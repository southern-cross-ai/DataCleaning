<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; IT LURKS AT NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">OFFICER JOHN HAYDEN shrugged big shoulders as if
the stiff cloth of his tunic bothered him, but his uneasiness had
nothing to do with the fit of his uniform. Something in the
wee-hour stillness of Exterior Street was getting him, something
ominous in the black loom of the freighters squeezed between pier
sides, in the continual lap-lap of greasy water against their
hulls, distinct in the silence. The bay seemed to have a million
tongues tonight, and each one whispered a warning.</p>

<p>A warning of what? Hayden's narrowed eyes slid along the
deserted expanse of cobbles he patrolled. Illuminated patches
hugged the wide-spaced street lamps closely. Between them shadows
lay heavily...</p>

<p>The officer's unquiet glance roved to the right, skimmed blank
facades of dingy warehouses, paused hesitantly at the black maw of
an alley. He knew he ought to take a look in Acre, yet a curious
reluctance restrained him. Anything, almost anything might be
hidden in that tar-barrel murk!</p>

<p>Hayden shrugged again. "Hell of a cop I am," he muttered
half-aloud. "Ye'd think I was a rookie doin' his first
twelve-to-eight tour." He swerved toward the alley mouth, digging
into a pocket for his flashlight; but his other hand took a tighter
grip on his nightstick... There was a prickle of cold across the
back of his neck as he sensed, rather than saw, a flicker of
movement within the alley toward which he slowly thudded.</p>

<p>His torch-beam shot out. Crazily-leaning wooden walls leapt into
being. The light-disk danced along scummed flag-stones, broken and
up-ended, probed a pile of heaped refuse, moved further
back&mdash;and was suddenly notched by a heavy-soled shoe, the blue
hem of a trouser-leg. It stopped, quivered a bit, moved again, held
in the center of its luminance a prostrate, oddly twisted form in a
police uniform! The body lay face down in the alley filth; one arm
was flung over the sprawled figure's head, and at its end a
revolver barrel snouted.</p>

<p>Hayden's jaw hardened. His stick beat a rapid tattoo on the
sidewalk, then he was plunging forward, cat-footed, toward the
thing in there while his flash-beam stabbed into emptiness
beyond.</p>

<p>The cop reached the unmoving form of his comrade, stood
half-crouched above it. His eyes followed the lance of his light.
Neither sight nor sound betrayed any living presence in the alley,
but through the multifarious salty odors of the sea-breeze a
faintly acrid tang stung his nostrils, a pungency that was somehow
alien, exotic. It pulled his gaze down again to the body at his
feet, and something he had been unable to see from the alley mouth
struck the blood from his lips.</p>

<p>The fallen cop's hand, the fingers that gripped the butt of his
useless gun, were brown, shriveled&mdash;had the texture and sheen
of old parchment! The nails were blackened, curled oddly
outward.</p>

<p>"God!" Hayden groaned, and dropped to his knees in the slime. He
touched the strangely discolored hand with a tentative thumb,
snatched it away as a crackle like that of dried tissue paper came
startlingly loud in the silence. But the sere feel of withered skin
clung to his fingertips, and the hardness of bone beneath. "God,"
the cop said again, in a hushed, shocked voice.</p>

<p>A hot spot of wrath burned in Hayden's skull at the same time
that his skin crawled with unacknowledged fear. There was no
whisper of sound in the alley as he pulled air into tightened
lungs; but he felt eyes upon him&mdash;hot, inimical eyes. His
light toured the narrow passage; slid along blank, windowless
walls; skimmed mildewed, debris-strewn paving. There was nothing
there, nothing!</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he grunted. "Why in hell don't Fred come? He oughta
heard my raps and snapped into it pronto." Officer Fred Kane's beat
ended only half a block from here and the two always timed
themselves to relieve the tedium of the dawn patrol with mumbling
talk. Hayden fumbled for his whistle; his dropping glance went
almost furtively to the body's shriveled hand. And he gasped!</p>

<p>A tiny movement, when he had touched it perhaps, had pulled back
the sleeve, revealing flat silver links of a wrist-watch band and
the watch itself. Hayden stared pop-eyed at the odd, octagonal
timepiece and his mouth worked. He knew that watch, had compared it
numberless times with his own. It belonged to Fred Kane, to his
buddy, his side-partner through half a decade of sidewalk pounding!
But only an hour ago he had been chatting with Fred...</p>

<p>The policeman forced his arm to move, his hand to touch the
flattened shoulder of the corpse, pressing it so that the head
rolled limply and he could see its face. Its face! Good God! That
which stared sightlessly at him was the face of no human thing!</p>

<p>The skin, brown and shriveled like that of a long-dried apple,
had fallen into cheek-hollows, as if there were no flesh beneath.
Blackened lips were retracted from stained teeth. The nose-tip was
gone, the nostrils had vanished and their cartilage had shrunk
tightly closed. Lid-less eyes were glazed white marbles in deep
black pits. This was the face of a mummy, long dead, of a cadaver
exhumed from an age-eroded tomb! Horror rocked the stalwart
policeman back on his heels. He whimpered in his throat, fought
nausea.</p>

<p>At that moment voices sounded behind him. He exploded to his
feet, whirling as his free hand plunged to the holster for his gun!
From the darkness of the alley, came the gruff rumble of a man's
voice, the shrillness of a woman's.</p>

<p>The woman's: "No! No! Not again! Don't make me..."</p>

<p>Hayden's flash-beam searched for the voices, lashed into a
billow of blackness, a swirling cloud of black vapor rolling toward
him. Tendrils reached out for him, coiling ebony tendrils,
monstrously alive! The cop's scalp tightened, the cold breath of
fear beat on him, and the woman screamed "Help!" Screamed shrilly,
agonizingly from beyond the cloud!</p>

<p>Hayden swayed a lightning instant, terror of the black mystery
clamping his limbs. Then, snarling, white-faced, he plunged into
the impenetrable mist.</p>

<p>He plunged, and his skin was suddenly a living flame that
seared. Black fire scorched his face. A lightless blaze charred his
eyes, nostrils, mouth! He drew flame into bursting lungs, his
trigger-finger jerked spasmodically. Shot-Shot-crash pounded within
the lethal cloud. And the flare of his gun was drowned in black
vapor that swirled, thinned, and was gone.</p>

<p>Somewhere a woman laughed stridently, hysterically. Laughed till
the sound of her mad cachinnation was drowned in the roar of a
motor leaping away from the dark alley where two mummies
lay&mdash;two horror-faced mummies in the blue uniform of the
Granport police force.</p>

<p>Grim-visaged young Dan Lorraine, captain of the freighter
<i>Lomand,</i> twisted with a weather-reddened hand the doorknob of
Praying Joe's, hottest spot on Granport's waterfront. Erstwhile
hot-spot, that is&mdash;for the usual tumult was silent behind the
portal he was opening and the flaring neon sign above him lit with
its red glare a deserted, eerily hushed street. Dan's yellow
eyebrows knitted in puzzlement.</p>

<p>The door came open on a cavernous, dim-lit, low-ceilinged hall.
The sailor's footfall thudded loudly, echoing, and a white-aproned
bartender pounded across the floor toward him, a bulldog automatic
jumping from a hip pocket. The man's face was a hard mask, but his
little eyes glittered oddly, and his ordinarily florid features
were filmed with a sickly green cast. Were it not for the
thick-necked, jutting-jawed bull's head topping gorilla-like
shoulders, Dan would have thought that fear lurked in Praying Joe's
tiny orbs. Then recognition dawned on the dive-owner's face.</p>

<p>"Hell!" Joe grunted. "Dan Lorraine. Didn't know you was in."</p>

<p>The ship-captain watched Joe slide his gat back to its covert.
"Yes," he growled. "I'm in, and I'm going out again on the dawn
tide." He rolled past the saloon-man to the bar, got a foot up on
the brass rail. "Whisky sour, Joe, and be damn quick about it."</p>

<p>In seconds the concoction slid across the mahogany, and Dan had
gulped it down with a shudder. "Lousy as ever," he grunted. He let
his eyes wander through the big cafe and came back to Praying Joe.
"What," he said heavily, "is the matter with you and this whole
rotten town?"</p>

<p>Joe swiped a foul-smelling rag across the wood-top, leaving a
greasy film of dampness. His heavy face glowered. "What's eatin'
yuh, pal?" he said at last. "What makes yuh think anything's wrong
wid Granport?"</p>

<p>"Think!" the seaman exclaimed. "I damn well know it." He threw a
big-thewed arm out in a sweeping gesture, indicating the dim-lit,
nearly empty room, the few furtively whispering, tight-mouthed men
who were its only other occupants, the vacant stage beyond the long
bar. "Nice, lively spot this after ten months slogging the waves
with the everlasting stink of Patagonian hides in your nose.
Praying Joe's, the rip-roaringest dive on the waterfront, gloomy as
a funeral parlor&mdash;and the rest of the port just like this.
Nobody on the streets except the cops, and they going around in
pairs with their hands on their gun butts, eyeing a fellow like he
was a public enemy number one. Half the theaters closed, the rest
empty. Hell&mdash;when I came in you went green-gilled and grabbed
out your gun as if you thought I was Stan Kanio himself prowling
for a stick-up."</p>

<p>The aproned one's eyes jerked to the tables and back. "Stan
Kanio's not stickin' this joint up, nor any other. He's six foot
under."</p>

<p>Lorraine straightened, interest momentarily brightening his
broad-planed, wind-wrinkled features. "Oh, yes? Your dumb police
force got him finally, did they?"</p>

<p>The bartender spat into the sawdust on the floor. "Not so dumb,
Dan, not so dumb. They blasted him at the docks, caught him
flat-footed wid a bag in each hand."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh." Lorraine's mouth twisted wryly. "Never gave him a
chance, I suppose. Shot him like a dog when he couldn't pull his
gat."</p>

<p>"Well," Joe shrugged, "they wasn't takin' no chances." He seemed
relieved at the turn of the conversation. "His moll got away,
somehow, in the rumpus. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it isn't Kanio that's scared Granport gutless," Dan
interrupted. He pushed thick fingers through his shock of yellow,
rumpled hair. "What is it then? What are you afraid of, you and the
rest of the burg?" His fingers were magically around the
saloon-man's wrist, jamming him up against the counter. "Spit it
out or, by God, I'll break your arm." The captain's narrowed eyes
burned with a cold blue flame as they probed the other's tiny
orbs.</p>

<p>Joe gulped and licked white lips. "Gripes," he whined. "No call
for yuh gettin' tough. I thought yuh knew. Dere ain't nuttin' else
in de papers but de mummy death."</p>

<p>"The what?" Dan leaned forward, his eyes glowing. "I've just
landed, haven't seen a paper. What's that you said?"</p>

<p>"De mummy death. Two weeks it's been gain' on now, cops bein'
found all over town all dried up like dem mummies in de museum. Dey
ain't got no noses, deir ears is all dried up, deir
faces&mdash;cripes&mdash;I seen one an' I ain't slep' fer t'ree
nights with it lookin' at me in de dark." The saloon-man spilled
whisky into a glass and threw the fiery liquid down his throat.</p>

<p>"You saw one. How&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yeah! I seen one an' I wish I hadn't. Tim Rollins it wuz, he
wuz at me side door slucin' his t'roat wid a schooner o' lager when
a dame steps up ter him. 'Officer,' she sez t'rough her veil.
'Officer, dere's a man in de hallway o' Number Twenty-six. I t'ink
he's dead.' Her voice wuz soft an' she talked like a toff.</p>

<p>" 'Dead drunk, more likely," Tim sez an' he finishes his drink
before goin' over. I watched him go up the stoop, an' inside de
hall. Sudden-like I hears a yowl like nuttin' human. I wuz too damn
scared ter do anythin' fer a minute, den I grabs me gat an' beats
it over. Dere he wuz&mdash;Oh Gawd&mdash;don't ast me ter tell yuh
what he looked like!..."</p>

<p>"And the woman?"</p>

<p>"She wuzn't anywhere aroun'. I didn't see her go, an' nobody
else did." The narrator's voice was a husky whisper now, a whisper
in which ancestral terror quivered. "An' I didn't see her come
neither, dough I wuz standin' right next to Tim, lookin' out. She
wuz dere one minute, nowheres de next." His next words were barely
audible. "If yuh wuz ter ast me, I t'ink she wuzn't no woman at
all."</p>

<p>"A man? But you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor no man, neither." Save for its network of wormlike red
capillaries, Joe's face had gone fish-belly gray and his eyes were
livid. He looked past Dan, seeing things that were not of the real
world. "Nor no man," he repeated solemnly.</p>

<p>The sailor was all alive now, his big frame athrill with a
tremor of excitement. His grip on the other man's wrist relaxed.
"Wait," he said. "Wait. You said this mummy death takes only cops.
What's everybody else scared about then?"</p>

<p>"Gees, guy, don't yuh get it? Here's a harness-bull paradin' his
beat. Dere's a holler fer help somewheres, er someone comes runnin'
up tellin' him about a prowler climbin' a fire-escape. Eight
chances outen ten it's straight enough, but de udder two chances is
dat it's de mummy death baitin' him. W'addya t'ink de cop's gonna
do?"</p>

<p>"He's not going to be in any too great hurry to go looking for
trouble," Lorraine answered, musingly. "He'll stop to think it
over, to question his informant."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. An' in de meantime de prowler gets away, or de
stick-up's finished. Dat's what's happenin' in Granport de last two
weeks, an' dere's plenty takin' advantage o' de set-up. Dey've even
cleaned two banks, wid de squad-cars showin' up a half hour
late."</p>

<p>"So that's it," Dan said softly. "So that's the layout. The
police force paralyzed by fear, and the crooks running wild."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE MURDER GUN</h2>

<p class="first">THE pall of fear lying over Granport was almost
tangible as Dan Lorraine, somewhat later, rolled through gloomy,
vacant streets on sea-legs that were only a trifle unsteady. He was
on his way back to the <i>Lomand</i>, a bare three hours' shut-eye
ahead of him before he must turn out to sail on the dawn tide. This
morning he had swallowed wrath as he read the radio that would take
the freighter down to New Scotia with not twenty-four hours'
lay-over. He had raged at the stevedores emptying her holds, had
glowered through the business of obtaining clearance at the Barge
Office. But the port toward which he had strained his weather-worn
eyes all through the long coastal trip was a place accursed, a city
shuddering under the threat of a nameless horror. He was glad, now,
that everything was ready for a speedy departure.</p>

<p>A high board fence loomed at his right, huge white letters
proclaiming that behind it lay Morrison's Ship Chandlery Yards. Dan
glanced up and down the street. No one was in sight. He wheeled
swiftly, pulled aside a loose board whose location he had
discovered earlier in the evening, and squeezed through. Trespass
or not, this was a short cut to the <i>Lomand's</i> berth and he
was in no mood to take the long trek around. Dan was fed up of
Granport.</p>

<p>Piled anchors, huge mounds of rope, all the various
appurtenances of the seafaring trade, were shadowy in the dimness.
The captain sniffed the tarry, familiar odors luxuriously. He was
through the store yard. Behind this other fence was Exterior
Street, and across its cobbles were Pier Nine and the
<i>Lomand.</i> With the surefootedness of the sailor, Dan ran up a
leaning scantling that braced the barrier, swung a leg
over&mdash;and froze to the spot.</p>

<p>Approaching footsteps thudded along the sidewalk beyond the
fence. He was a trespasser, and it would be troublesome if his
unauthorized presence in the store-yard were discovered. In
Granport's present state of mind it might be worse. Dan pulled his
leg back, crouched so that only the top of his head and his eyes
were above the fence-top.</p>

<p>There they were, two policemen flat-footedly pounding pavement
toward him about half a block away. They were on either side of the
roadway, hugging the curbs well away from the shadows that lay
along the pier entrances and the chandlery-yard fence. Dan could
see their grim-set faces distinctly, their hands hovering near
holsters buckled outside their uniform coats rather than within as
was the usual custom. Their heads jerked ceaselessly from side to
side in quick, fearful scrutiny of every possible source of lurking
peril. Lorraine's scalp tightened as the tensity of their bodies,
their stiff-legged walk, conveyed to him across intervening space a
contagion of the icy fear quivering within them. He knew, without
being told, the terror that animated them, the depths of courage
they were dragging to be here at all. Death&mdash;violent
death&mdash;was a commonplace to them; their business was to face
it. But the mummy death...</p>

<p>If they spied him up here those ready guns would leap from their
holsters, unquestioning, and crash leaden death into him. Any
movement to retreat would make sound enough to bring them after him
on the jump. His only safety lay in their passing him unnoticing.
Dan crouched lower, holding his breath. The thump of the
patrolmen's brogans came nearer, nearer...</p>

<p>Dan's left foot started to slip, skidded off the narrow
scantling!</p>

<p>His fingers dug into their hold on the fence-top. The toes of
his right foot worked in their shoe, ape-instinct striving for a
prehensile grip that civilized leather defeated. If they'd only
walk faster! He could hold on only seconds longer. Then he'd have
to twist, to drop, and...</p>

<p>The distant thrum of a speeding motor shocked the night silence.
Even as Lorraine's remaining foothold gave way the sound
crescendoed, was a roar of thunder beyond the fence. The sailor
dared a contortion that banged his toe-caps alarmingly against
wood, but brought his legs up and under him again. The sound was
like artillery fire in his ears. A shout from the unseen street
heralded it, and the blast of a police gun.</p>

<p>Dan held on grimly. That bullet had missed. He waited for
another. It would be useless now to jump and try to run...</p>

<p>But the second shot did not come. There was instead the squeal
of brakes, the scrape of skidding rubber, and a bellowed, "Stop,
damn you! Stop!"</p>

<p>The <i>Lomand's</i> captain pulled his head above the fence-top.
A big gray sedan was halted fifty feet from his vantage point,
nosing toward him, so that it was evident to him that it had been
roaring along the wrong side of the street. The near officer was
just putting a thick-soled boot on its running board, the other was
turning, starting to come across.</p>

<p>"Where's the fire?" the cop began. "Want the whole street for
yourself? Whatcha doin' here this time o' night anyway? Gimme yer
license."</p>

<p>"Oh, officer," a girl's fresh voice came from the front of the
sedan. "I was just&mdash;"</p>

<p>Black smoke belched from the open rear window, enveloped the
officer in a mushroom of murky haze! The engine roared into action,
the car leaped out of the ebony cloud. Smoke belched from it again,
billowing toward the second cop. Dan saw a form catapult out of the
first cloud, thrown from the outleaping running-board, a sprawling
form whose face, instantaneously, was brown-charred, shriveled like
a dried apple!</p>

<p>Then Dan had leaped from the fence-top, had crashed down on the
car roof and was sliding off, sliding down over the side and toward
the cobbles that reeled past as the auto gathered speed in a swift
surge of power.</p>

<p>The captain's leap had been instinctive, automatic, an explosion
of his muscles undirected by his brain, touched off by the horror
he had witnessed. But now he was clawing at smooth metal that gave
no grip, was squirming overside and down?&mdash;down to be dashed
against leaping rock by the swift speed the death-car had attained
in seconds...</p>

<p>The wind of its passage beat at him, whistled a doom-message in
his ears. His feet went over the edge, his legs were following,
slowly but inevitably. The rain-gutter caught at his belt for an
instant, let go. He slid further as the auto twisted, and roared
into some quiet street leading away from the water-front. Its speed
slackened, and with that slackening his toes found purchase on a
door handle, purchase enough for the sea-trained man to clamp knees
on a doorpost, hold himself tight against the car side, and dip,
finally, to firm footing on the running-board of the gray
sedan.</p>

<p>He clung to sill and fender of the still fast-moving motor, and
brought his head down to peer through its front window. A woman was
driving the murder-machine. He glimpsed her reddish, luxuriant
hair, her tip-tilted nose, mouth muffled by the turned-up fur of
her coat. She was turning to look at him, her eyes startled...</p>

<p>Dan's gaze was jerked away from her by the sound of a rear
window opening.</p>

<p>The window was down, and a hand was pushing through it A hand
that held&mdash;not a gun, but something gun-like, with a
three-inch barrel that seemed to swallow light!</p>

<p>"The black-gas projector!" Dan thought. "The mummy death!"
Terror flared in him.</p>

<p>The woman's voice screamed through his terror, "No, Pete. No!
He's not a cop! No! Please!"</p>

<p>"Hell," a man's voice growled, irresolute. "You can't let him
go, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not letting him go." She whirled to Dan. "Here you!" she
snapped, her voice crackling as no woman's voice should,
virulently. "Get in here or I'll let him blast you!"</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but obey. Lorraine managed to get the
front door open, to crawl into the car, beside the woman. The sedan
leaped into high speed, flinging him backwards into the seat. Hands
clutched from behind, forcing him down, forcing his cap down over
his eyes so that he could not see. Rough hands fumbled rope around
him, bound his arms to his sides, pulled cloth tight over his eyes.
The thrumming roar of the motor in front of him crescendoed ever
higher as the murder car sped through streets he knew to be
night-bound and deserted, sped to a fate he could only imagine. He
shuddered...</p>

<p>Dan felt the car sway as it swerved, swerved again. The cold
night air of open country came in to him now, but his throat was
parched, dry with fear. The fearful speed of the sedan slackened;
he could hear rustling foliage scrape as it pushed its way through
some narrow country lane, bumping and swaying. His eyes ached under
the pressure of their blindfold, and the fur of the woman's coat
irritated his cheek, his hand. But he sensed the warmth of her
body, and a little of his fear seeped away.</p>

<p>The car slowed. A hand groped along his side. A throbbing
contralto voice said in his ear, "No gun, Pete! He has no gun." The
hand slipped inside the flap of his pea-jacket, pulled the ship's
papers out of his pocket. He heard them rustle. Then, "Captain of
the <i>Lomand,</i> are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Lorraine muttered. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Seventy-five-foot freighter, Diesel engined." She was evidently
reading from the documents. "Five men in the crew. All cleared to
sail."</p>

<p>There was a snort from the back. The man's voice husked,
chuckled evilly, "Too bad her captain won't sail with her..."</p>

<p>"I wonder..." the feminine voice mused. "I wonder..."</p>

<p>The voice in the rear hardened to cold threat. "What's the idea,
Marge? Thinking of letting the mutt go?"</p>

<p>"Well, Pete,"&mdash;tentatively&mdash;"he's not a cop."</p>

<p>"Forget it. He knows too much; he's seen your face, and the car.
I'm not taking any chances, and don't you forget it."</p>

<p>"Hell!" She laughed abruptly, and there was something in the
sound of it that made Dan shudder. "That's the last thing I'd do.
Only reason I didn't let you blast him back there was because I've
never really seen how the mummy death worked. We've always had to
beat it before the smoke cleared away. I've only been able to read
about it in the papers afterwards and&mdash;and I'm curious."</p>

<p>"Oh." Pete's tone was relieved. "I was beginning to
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that. Look... Here's a good spot&mdash;let's do it
here." Brakes squealed, the car skidded, stopped.</p>

<p>"Oke. I'd like to work it right, just once, myself." Sadistic
eagerness quivered in the gruff tones of the man. The door behind
grated, then the one at Dan's right. His scalp tightened and he was
cold all over. The sound of peepers crashed in to him from
countryside stillness, and the far-off, melancholy hoot of a train.
There were people on that train, he thought, for whom there would
be a tomorrow...</p>

<p>"Come out of there," Pete growled. Dan felt steely fingers
clutch his arm, lurched out under the impulsion of their pull. His
foot caught in the running board and he crashed down into slimy
mud. The woman laughed and a heavy shoe thudded into his side. "Get
up, you dog. Get up and take it."</p>

<p>The seaman's arm struck fender-metal. He pulled himself erect,
stood swaying. His throat worked, but the sound that squeaked out
was not what he was trying to say. He bit his lips. Nothing he
could say would do any good&mdash;they wouldn't listen. He heard
the click of a cocked trigger...</p>

<p>"Wait, Pete. Wait," said the woman harshly. "Let him see what's
coming. It'll be funnier that way."</p>

<p>"Cripes," the other protested. "You're nuts." But a hand worked
at the knot back of Dan's skull and the blinding cloth pulled off.
The seaman blinked; sight came back and he saw light from the
car-roof tangle in the auburn net of the woman's hair. She had slid
over to the seat he had occupied. Dan saw an oval, piquant face, a
tiny mouth parted minutely, scarlet as a flower of evil. Avidity
quivered in that white face, excitement danced in gray eyes wherein
little lights flickered.</p>

<p>"Walk up the road, ten paces, then turn around." White teeth
gleamed between ruby lips as she said it. A sense of unreality
flooded Dan. Impossible that this girl&mdash;she seemed no
more&mdash;was staging his end in the black death that would blast
him to a charred, faceless mummy.</p>

<p>"Get busy. We can't wait here all night."</p>

<p>Dan shrugged, turned away and started off. As he did so he
glimpsed at his feet a huge, apelike shadow from which jutted a
thick arm and the silhouette of a grotesquely enlarged gun.</p>

<p>"One... two... three..." Meticulously he counted the steps of
his death march. "Four... five... six..." Headlight glare made the
thick foliage on either side of the road seem artificial, stagey.
This was all stagey, unreal. His numbed brain hadn't fully grasped,
yet, that it was he, Dan Lorraine, who was about to die. "Seven...
eight..."</p>

<p>If he jumped sidewise, into that thicket... an honest-to-God
revolver might miss, but the gas-gun would belch its cloud about
him before he could reach concealment. Why make further sport for
the fiends who played with him? "Nine..." The last step. Despair
dropped its black pall over Dan. "Ten." He whirled to meet the
black death smoke...</p>

<p>The scene before him photographed itself on his mind.
Pete&mdash;half-crouched at the car side, his head monumental on
tremendous shoulders, his nose a blob of unshaped dough on a
pallid, dead-white face, his shaggy eyebrows penthouse eaves over
tiny, glittering black eyes&mdash;was stabbing the club-like
gas-gun at him for the kill. Dan tensed to take it.</p>

<p>But above the snarling killer a white arm arched abruptly out.
Metal gleamed, vanished into the man's back. Blood spurted from
between thick lips, burbled over yellow fangs! Pete crumpled.
Marge's quick hand flashed out, caught the gas-gun from him as he
thudded to the earth. The girl slid lithely out.</p>

<p>"God!" Dan grunted. "God!" Had she been acting a part, playing
for a chance to save him...?</p>

<p>But her eyes blazed at him, a vulpine fury banished beauty from
her countenance. "You," she snapped. "You!" Get back here. Quick.
Or..." The weapon lifted, was steady in a slim hand. "Or I'll
finish you myself."</p>

<p>Her voice was thinned by excitement, shrill. Dan started back
toward her. The elation that had pounded in his veins when he saw
Pete go down under the girl's knife was replaced by a new fear as
he drew closer and saw the lines of cruelty at her mouth corners,
the shadows lurking beneath her eyes. He recalled how swiftly, how
surely, her dagger had gone to its mark, remembered that this was
the woman who had acted as lure for the mummy death, and shuddered.
It was not for his sake that she had intervened to save him, not
for his sake that she had plunged the knife into Pete's back!</p>

<p>"Can you drive?" she asked as he reached her. "Can you drive a
car, sailor?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He could scarcely get it out. "Yes." He fancied that the
red on her lips was the stain of blood.</p>

<p>"Then get under the wheel. Hurry." Some urgent need for haste
crackled in her voice, and the black nose of the murder-gun snouted
at his midriff.</p>

<p>Dan fought for control. "I can't drive with my arms tied."</p>

<p>"We'll fix that," she murmured. She glanced swiftly down at her
victim, sprawled face down in the mud. Dan started to move; her
eyes flashed warningly back to him and he froze.</p>

<p>Her knees bent, the fingers of her free hand closed about the
knife-handle projecting from Pete's blood-soaked back, jerked at
it. It resisted her pull. Her little foot lifted; one sharp heel
was planted between the shoulder-blades of her victim, and she
tugged again. The knife came free, sliced through the ropes binding
Lorraine's arms.</p>

<p>"Now get busy," Marge said, without a quiver in her even voice.
"Hop to it."</p>

<p>Somehow, Dan got into the car, though his limbs were water-weak
and his brain quivered with revulsion. The girl, Marge, slid in
after him, supple as a panther. The door slammed, the light behind
clicked out.</p>

<p>"Go," her voice lashed in the sudden darkness. "Straight ahead."
Dan felt the hard muzzle of the gas-gun pressing against his side.
The car leaped into motion, almost of itself.</p>

<p>Close-planted trees flicked by as the gray sedan's headlights
bored a tunnel through darkness. Almost at once&mdash;they couldn't
have gone more than a quarter-mile&mdash;the girl snapped out,
"Slow." Her hand darted to the dashboard and the headlamps clicked
off, on, off, on, and off again.</p>

<p>"To the right," she whispered. "Here."</p>

<p>A darker opening loomed against the dark of the bordering trees.
Dan tooled the sedan into it, feeling as if he were driving through
the gate of his own tomb. Gravel crunched under the wheels, and a
curving driveway glimmered palely in starlight.</p>

<p>Something showed in the driveway ahead, the dark figure of a
man. Dan braked. The fellow held a stubby shotgun at ready; a
vagrant light-gleam showed his gash of a mouth and his prognathous
jaw. "Marge?" he called.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam." The woman's tone was light, pleasant. "The boys been
here yet?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, and gone. The junk ought to pay twenty grand, I figger.
But dey had to bump the watchman."</p>

<p>"Swell! Come here a minute."</p>

<p>"What...?"</p>

<p>"I've got something for you. Come here, will you?"</p>

<p>The man lowered his weapon, strode forward, swerving to the
right.</p>

<p>Then abruptly the guard vanished in a swirling black cloud that
billowed over him, over the car-front! Marge laughed, and the
gun-pressure was back in Dan's side. "Hope he likes that present,"
the woman giggled. "But I'm afraid he won't thank me for it."</p>

<p>The wheel-rim was hot to Dan's hands and his skin crawled. "Good
Lord!" he grunted. "You didn't give him a chance."</p>

<p>Marge laughed again. "No. I didn't," she agreed. "No more than
I'll give you if you try any tricks."</p>

<p>The death cloud thinned rapidly, was gone. A shape of horror was
draped over the sedan's hood, a faceless thing whose cavernous
eye-pits stared with sightless reproach at the windshield.</p>

<p>"Drive on!" the woman snapped.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Dan yammered. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drive on!" Her voice was relentless, urgent, and the evil
weapon stabbed meaningly into the seaman's ribs.</p>

<p>Dan's foot went down on the pedal. The car jerked forward, and
the shriveled mummy slid from its perch. The rear wheels of the
sedan bumped over something and Dan heard the crunch of bone.</p>

<p>The driveway curved again, a vague structure loomed blackly to
the left. "All right," Marge whispered. "Here." Dan braked,
switched off the ignition.</p>

<p>"Now listen, sailor," Marge said. "We're going in there and
we're going to attend to some things. Remember I'm not taking my
eyes off you or my hand from this gun. If you behave you'll be all
right; if you don't you'll get the same dose Sam did. It doesn't
matter to me, either way. Understand?"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking her earnestness, her intent to do that
which she threatened. Dan knew he was helpless, was in the power of
an implacable captor who thrilled with the lust to kill, to kill
horribly with her over-sized weapon that belched a noiseless black
cloud and stripped its victim of all human semblance. She had the
face of a woman, beautiful, infinitely desirable, but her soul was
that of a devil incarnate. He had seen her kill ruthlessly,
horribly, had heard her laugh as she killed.</p>

<p>"Dan nodded. "I understand," he muttered. "Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Come on, then." She slipped something metallic into his hand.
"Here's the key. You'll walk ahead and open up."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; KILLER'S KISS</h2>

<p class="first">THE door to the house slammed to behind Dan
Lorraine, shutting out even the vague starlight, and the sound
reverberated in hollow emptiness. The air here was heavy with dust,
with darkness. Dan hesitated, heard the scrape of fabric against
fabric behind him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a warm, soft body was pressed against his, moist palms
were against his cheeks, pulling his head down. Lips brushed his
lightly, tingling! Then, almost before he was aware of her, Marge
had slipped away, and her light laugh rang out. "You're a dear
boy," she thrilled. "You're just like&mdash;" Her voice broke,
queerly, into a sob.</p>

<p>Blood pounded in Dan's temples. He was a sailor, just in from a
long voyage. And he was young, virile. For an instant he
forgot&mdash;many things&mdash;flung out an arm, groping for her.
Then he dashed the back of his palm across his mouth to erase the
taste of that kiss, swore under his breath.</p>

<p>A switch clicked and a single bulb spilled dingy yellow light
over drab, damp-streaked walls; a splintered, bare floor. A window
was covered by black cloth, clumsily nailed. On a wooden kitchen
table there were chipped plates, a half-cut loaf of bread, some
slices of ham on greasy paper. Dan looked at these and his spine
prickled as he realized that the man for whom it had been intended
would never finish that meal.</p>

<p>Marge was at the further wall, facing him. Her fur coat was gone
and a filmy, gossamer frock only half concealed the rounded,
voluptuous curves of a youthful body. Long lashes drooped
sensuously over her lustrous gray eyes, and a tiny smile just
touched the wings of her lips. But the grim gas-gun was firmly
gripped in one hand, while the other fumbled, oddly, behind her
back.</p>

<p>Something grated, and Dan was startled to see the solid-seeming
wall move. A panel lifted like the curtain of a marionette theater,
and a square black hole gaped behind the woman.</p>

<p>Light filtered into the wall-hole, edged a trunk-like box, steel
bound. Marge gestured to it with her weapon. "Get it out. Quickly.
We haven't much time... tide's full in an hour."</p>

<p>The box was heavier than Dan had thought. It scraped out and
thudded to the floor. He turned to her. Her under-lip was caught by
pointed little teeth, her eyes glared feverishly. "Take it out to
the car." She snapped the command.</p>

<p>Dan heaved the case to his shoulder, staggered out. What was she
up to, where was she taking him, taking the chest? What was in
store for him when she no longer needed him? The black gas? Why go
all through this if that were so? Why not drop the thing, turn on
her, take a chance on one good blow before the mummy death claimed
him? Yes... His muscles knotted.</p>

<p>"Put it in the back seat." No, not now... It would be suicide,
and Dan didn't want to die. Not like that, anyway&mdash;not as
those policemen had died, and the guard out here... He'd get a
break later. He'd wait for it.</p>

<p>"And now, Dan darling, for our honeymoon." Saccharine sentiment,
mocking, slurred her contralto. "Drive me to your ship, my
dear."</p>

<p>Lorraine twisted, his fists clenching. "My ship!" He had been
overawed, powerless under the incongruous threat of her somehow
reptilian beauty and the doomful omen of the gas-gun. But when she
menaced his craft... "I'll be damned if I will!" he said.</p>

<p>Her face was a white mask, a Medusa's head that turned him to
stone, and the black gun, lifted, was a tunnel of doom. Only her
eyes were alive. Gazing into them Dan saw hell itself leering at
him. Suddenly the strength went out of his limbs. "All right," he
gulped.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">COUNTRY roads ran under the wheels of the car,
endlessly, and as endlessly the treadmill of his thoughts ran
through the seaman's brain.</p>

<p>The small houses at the edge of Granport flicked past, then they
were in the city. Two police officers on a corner looked at the
gray car curiously, and never knew how near death had passed them
by. The car vibrated to the cobbles of Exterior Street, curved into
the shadows of the pier where the <i>Lomand</i> lay, slithered to a
halt. Marge whispered, and Dan called, choking, "Ahoy the
<i>Lomand!</i> Turn out the crew. We sail at once. And get down
here for a trunk out of this car."</p>

<p>"Mister Carem's not aboard, sir."</p>

<p>The gun poked into Dan's side. "The mate's joining us at New
Scotia," he said quickly. "My wife's taking his bunk till
there."</p>

<p>His crew was well trained. In minutes Dan was moving along a dim
deck to the after house, Marge close beside him. Bill Hallam, the
thick-necked boatswain, had peered curiously at the woman Dan
introduced as his wife, had mumbled evasive congratulations. Then
he had gotten the mysterious box out of the rear, had slung it
easily to his shoulder. He was padding behind them now. Below deck,
the Diesels thrummed.</p>

<p>Fine fellows, these men of his, shipmates for the five years he
had owned and commanded the <i>Lomand.</i> Friends rather than
subordinates. Dan felt oddly hopeful, despite the gas-gun that he
knew still threatened him from the concealment of Marge's wrap.
They'd sense something was wrong, he was sure, would soon realize
that he was not master of his own ship. Only one familiar with the
sea could prevent his giving some sign to them that he needed
help.</p>

<p>That remark of his about New Scotia, for instance... Once out of
the harbor the helmsman would become aware that the course he laid
would not take them there. Lorraine grinned covertly. The she-devil
had overreached herself by pirating his vessel. He had been wise to
wait...</p>

<p>The <i>Lomand</i> was designed for compactness and a minimum
crew. Perched on her high stern, the after house included the
officer's cabins, the chartroom and, in a recess, jutting forward
from the latter, the wheelhouse and bridge-telegraph. Midship was
the single well-deck with its derricks, and forward the bow rose to
the tiny fo'c'sle. Below were the cargo holds and the engine room.
No bunkers were needed; the Diesel's fuel was carried in the skin
of the ship's double bottom as ballast. A trim ship, well
found...</p>

<p>Dan grimaced inwardly as Hallam thumped the heavy chest down on
the floor of the chartroom.</p>

<p>"Send Hal Keegan forward to take the wheel, and prepare to cast
off."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye sir." The sailor turned on his heels, went out into
the dark. Dan turned to the woman.</p>

<p>"You're doing fine." She smiled slowly. "Get out of the harbor
and I'll tell you what to do next. I'm going into this room." She
indicated the mate's cabin&mdash;"but don't forget I'm keeping the
door and my ears open, and the gun ready."</p>

<p>Grizzled Keegan came in, his weatherworn eyes devoted. Dan
gestured him to the wheel, picked up his megaphone. "Stand by to
cast off," he ordered.</p>

<p>His heart had lightened momentarily as the routine of leaving
port proceeded along its familiar course. Then his eye fell on the
chest, and he remembered the girl sitting in the darkened cabin,
the gas-gun with its charge of horrible death clutched in her slim
fingers. Fear tightened once more around his heart. What wild
scheme was brewing in her distorted, evil brain? Where was she
taking his ship, his crew?</p>

<p>Riding light, the <i>Lomand</i> pitched a bit to the swells as
her prow cut across choppy water. The sky had thickened. Except for
the channel lights the dark was impenetrable, velvety. Silver
Head's white-green-white winked by.</p>

<p>"Hold her head Nor' nor'east," ordered Dan. He jerked away from
Keegan's "Aye, sir," as he felt a touch on his arm.</p>

<p>"Where are we, darling?" Keegan would scarcely notice the
mocking tone.</p>

<p>"Out of the harbor&mdash;on the open sea."</p>

<p>"Then you have time to talk to me. Come back here, please."</p>

<p>Her right hand was hidden under a long cape. Dan knew what it
held. He stepped back into the gloom.</p>

<p>"What course do you want me to lay?" he whispered. Anywhere but
south-by-east, he prayed, the direction of New Scotia. Keegan had
gumption, would obey the orders without a word, but when he was
relieved he'd carry the news forward of the captain's aberration.
And then&mdash;maybe things would happen.</p>

<p>"Wait." Reflection from the binnacle-lamp just edged her face
with luminance. Dan saw uneasily that she was looking at the
helmsman, five feet away, and that her eyes glittered strangely.
Her arm came out from under the cloak&mdash;and abruptly Lorraine
knew what she was about to do. He started toward her...</p>

<p>Black smoke poured from the gun's orifice&mdash;not at him, but
at old Hal, intent on the compass! It blotted out the light there,
billowed around the stalwart figure of the old tar. The ship yawned
as shriveled hands let the wheel twirl.</p>

<p>Feet pounded along the deck below and someone called, "Is
anything wrong, sir?"</p>

<p>Dan was voiceless with horror, staring at the prostrate,
distorted form of his old shipmate sprawling out of
the&mdash;death-cloud. The gun swept around to him. "Tell him no.
Quickly!" Marge snapped, and her face twitched with fierce threat.
"Or I'll blast you, and him, and all the others!"</p>

<p>"No, Bill. Hal slipped, that's all. You can turn in now."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir." The shadowy form turned away.</p>

<p>"Take hold of it, quick. Fix it!"</p>

<p>No denying the urgency in her command. Dan leaped to the wheel,
twirled it back till the swinging compass-card showed the ship was
back on the course he had set. "What did poor Keegan ever do to
you? Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to be alone with you..." Another kaleidoscopic
change had come into the strange woman's tone. It throbbed now with
languor, with tingling promise.</p>

<p>Dan kept his gaze steadily ahead, while his brain raced. He had
been weak, a fool. He should have let her kill him back there at
the house. His great body shook to the pound of his heart. He must
find some way to circumvent her, to save his crew from her
murder-lust.</p>

<p>"I didn't want anyone else in here," she said. "Look, you can do
something to that thing so you don't have to hold it, can't
you?"</p>

<p>That suited him, it would leave him free for the desperate
attempt he meditated. Deftly he adjusted the requisite fastenings
and turned.</p>

<p>Marge had retreated to his cabin, had snapped on a light within.
She was just within the doorway. Her free hand went to her neck,
her fingers jerked at a collar fastening. The long, dark cloak that
had covered her slipped to the floor. Dan gasped, his cheeks burned
hotly.</p>

<p>Bared white shoulders sloped to a heaving chest that swelled in
turn to rounded breasts. An abbreviated, silken garment made
pretense of concealing deep, voluptuous hips, and its lacy lower
edge frilled along the tops of white thighs whose flat muscles
pulsed...</p>

<p>The shaken man forced his eyes away, forced them up to the
woman's face... Her perfect lips were half-parted with strange
ecstasy; the pink membrane within her flaring nostrils was
startling against the dead whiteness of her skin. Her eyes had
darkened, were narrowed and slumberous, alight with promise.</p>

<p>Dan's fingernails cut into his palms, his tongue licked dryness.
"God!" he groaned.</p>

<p>Triumph twitched minutely at the corners of Marge's mouth.
"Dan," she husked. "Dan. Come..."</p>

<p>In his wrists, his temples, Lorraine's pulse throbbed painfully.
At the inner bend of his great arms the very skin ached with
longing for her. Step by step he went toward her, and desire blazed
in his shaken soul, blotted out memory, fear...</p>

<p>One little cell in his reeling brain noted that the black gun
still swung at the end of one nude arm, that one finger was still
curled about its trigger.</p>

<p>He was within the warm aroma of her, the fire within him leaped
to meet her fire. She was in his arms, pressed close to him. They
were one flame, swirling...</p>

<p>For a single instant Dan's vision cleared. He was facing outward
through the door of the cabin. Light lay in a broad band across the
dark chart-room floor, just reached the prostrate form of Keegan.
From the brown, parchment horror of that which had been the old
sailor's face two black pits stared up at his captain, and
shriveled lips seemed to move...</p>

<p>"Dan," the woman on his breast sobbed. "Dan, my love. You will
take me far away&mdash;and I will make you rich. We will be so
happy, Dan, together. So happy. Kiss me, Dan." Her head turned
upward, he saw deep down into the depths of her eyes where passion
burned. Her hot lips sought, found his...</p>

<p>Dan's palm drifted slowly down the coolness of her arm that hung
loosely along her side, felt its skin quiver to his touch. Her
wrist-pulse pounded...</p>

<p>Dan's fingers touched cold metal. They clenched and jerked...
The barrel of the gun was in his hand, was free!</p>

<p>The muscles of his other arm exploded, flung the girl from him.
She reeled across the cabin, stopped herself, twisting. She
haunched and sprang at him, like a white panther, her hands
clawing, her eyes a blaze of silent fury.</p>

<p>The leap was unexpected, lightning like. Dan had no time to
reverse the gun, to use it if he could. He slashed it as a club at
the woman's head. She twisted in mid-air, dodging it, and thudded
against him. Her nails raked across his cheeks.</p>

<p>Dan staggered back, the gun jarred from his insecure grip by the
impact. He glimpsed it skidding across the floor, out of the
hatchway, and the woman swarmed over him, snarling, biting,
scratching, a naked maelstrom of fury.</p>

<p>They crashed about the cabin. Dan recovered himself, got a grip
on the woman, thrust her away from him.</p>

<p>"You fool," she snarled, gasping. "You damned fool!" Her face
was contorted, fiendish. Her nails ripped for his eyes, and his
jerked-back head barely avoided them. He rolled, bringing her under
him, got his hands on her arms, holding her down, helpless.</p>

<p>"Fool!" she spat at him. "You're throwing away what a hundred
men would have given their lives to get!" She writhed under his
grip, but it held.</p>

<p>Dan's hand lifted, fisting, but murderous fiend as she was, he
could not crash it down into a woman's face. Her head lifted, her
teeth clicked viciously a half-inch from his arm. He slapped her
cheek, open-handed. Her head thumped against board. She was
motionless...</p>

<p>Lorraine lifted himself, glanced around. A coil of light
sounding-line hung from a hook on the bulkhead. In seconds his deft
sailor's hand had trussed her arm, her leg.</p>

<p>As he finished, her eyes opened. Tears glinted in them. Her
voice was like a little child's grieving. "I thought," she sobbed,
"you would take me away to peace&mdash;and love..."</p>

<p>Dan did not reply. Abruptly he realized that a strange silence
brooded over the vessel, that the quiet thrum of the Diesels was
stilled. Queer! He strode across the chartroom floor to the
engine-room speaking tube, jerked its mouthpiece.</p>

<p>"Tom," he called. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>He listened. No answering voice came from the tube. "Tom! Joe!"
he yelled. "What the hell's the matter?"</p>

<p>Dead silence answered him.</p>

<p>The <i>Lomand</i> was drifting, no way on her. From somewhere in
his subconscious Dan pulled recollection of a distant shout,
sometime during his struggle with Marge&mdash;a shout of terror. He
plunged to the after house entrance, looked out over the dark,
silent deck, toward the black loom of the forecastle.</p>

<p>"Hallam," he bawled. "Bill!"</p>

<p>He might have commanded a ship of the dead, for all the response
he got. Icy fingers clutched his heart. What had occurred aboard
while he had been engrossed with melodrama in his own quarters,
what had happened to his crew?</p>

<p>Minute sound, an almost unhearable thud, came to his ears,
pulled his eyes to the oblong of the engine-room hatch, somber
against the glimmer of the deck.</p>

<p>Dan pounded down the after house companion, to that dim opening.
He peered down into darkness, his scalp tightening.</p>

<p>"Tom," he bawled, and listened. Only the swash of bilge-water in
the <i>Lomand's</i> scuppers answered him. The ship lurched
drunkenly, and Dan heard the thump of something soft below.</p>

<p>The smell of grease stung his nostrils, of hot oil. And another
odor, sweetish, vaguely familiar. The smell of blood. Dan
swallowed, let himself down the ladder. There was a switch just
here... He found it, clicked it on.</p>

<p>Dan was staring, white faced, at what lay on the grating at his
feet. A stocky form in blue dungarees, supine, limp. A head pulped,
smashed beyond human recognition as a human head. A bloodstained
spanner, and a sloshing pool of gore in which lay all that was left
of Tom Bailey, engineer!</p>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; DEATH IN COMMAND</h2>

<p class="first">DAN LORRAINE pulled the back of his hand across
his forehead, but he didn't know it. An iron band was around his
brow, and shivers ran through his stalwart frame. The woman, Marge,
couldn't have done this&mdash;she had neither opportunity nor
strength. Who, then...?</p>

<p>An eerie feeling that something lurked in the gloom, that
someone was watching him warily, came dully through the murk of
Dan's stunned brain. His eyes shifted, tried to probe the mystery.
There was nothing to see back there but darkness. The captain
half-crouched, moved forward around the corner of the motor.</p>

<p>A thin thread of yellow luminance sifted through crossbars,
pistons of the Diesel. It fell across a black heap ominously
motionless, slumped over a guard rail. Dan moved closer, his spine
prickling. A white face looked up at him&mdash;the face of Joe
Neill. But beneath its chin was the black-shirted <i>back</i> of
the oiler! Lorraine rocked back on his heels. <i>Some tremendous
force had twisted Joe's head clear around on his shoulders!</i></p>

<p>In the dead man's unblinking eyes was mirrored horrors;
soul-shattering fear. From the corner of his mouth saliva
drooled...</p>

<p><i>What was that?</i> Dan whirled to the scraping, furtive sound
at his left.</p>

<p>He stared at the blank, sheer wall of the engine-room bulkhead.
It was from there the sound had come! Whatever, whoever had slain
these men this brutally must be in the cargo hold beyond!</p>

<p>There was an entrance to the hold right ahead, little used.
Dan's eyes found its dim outline, stared at it. It was closed. His
fingers opened, shut. He was weaponless; the killer was powerful,
merciless...</p>

<p>Dan got the flat of his hand on the bulkhead panel, shoved
sidewise. Dim luminance spilled only a little way into the hold
ahead; beyond was Stygian gloom. Dan's hand came up, jutting to
simulate the blunt barrel of an automatic.</p>

<p>"Come out of there," he boomed. "I've got you covered."</p>

<p>His voice plunged, reverberant, into emptiness. Its drum-thump
ceased, and nothing happened. But far forward, where the hull of
the vessel pinched in to its knifelike prow, something moved.</p>

<p>A chuckle came out of the blackness. "Come and get me," someone
husked.</p>

<p>Distorted, strangely blurred, Dan knew that voice! It belonged
to a man whom he had seen killed! His mind flung back to the two
dead men behind him. Tom Bailey, an all but headless corpse! Joe
Neill, his head twisted as nothing natural could have twisted it!
In God's name, what was it that hid in the blackness?</p>

<p>Again that gruesome, grim chuckle! Dan lunged, suddenly, lunged
through the open hatch and into blackness. Darted, at a lumbering
run, toward that unearthly chuckle!</p>

<p>"I'll get you," he howled defiantly.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> The heavy bulkhead door had crashed shut behind
him, shutting off light! Dan whirled around.</p>

<p>A mocking, hoarse laugh sounded hollowly, like the laugh of a
dead man, come back for vengeance!</p>

<p>Fiend from hell, or living madman, ghost or human, Dan was shut
in with the killer, shut in a pitch-dark hold, closeted with weird
and horrible death. For death was here&mdash;death turned
pirate&mdash;death that had conquered the <i>Lomand,</i> all but
its master, and hunted that master now. Panic seized Lorraine,
swept through him like an icy flood, and ebbed.</p>

<p>Of course. His lips twisted, he almost shouted aloud. If he
could not see the killer in that absolute darkness neither could
the other see him. And this was his ship. He knew every inch of it.
Craftiness born in utter fear came to the sailor's aid. If that
which stalked him were human at all, the advantage was on his side.
<i>This was his ship!</i></p>

<p>Softly, softly, with never a sound, Dan moved through that
darkness. Silently, though every nerve was taut, every muscle
quivering.</p>

<p>At last his foot found the ladder rung that was his goal. He
whirled, darted up the companion! His hands, lifting above his
head, struck the hatch-cover he knew was there, thrust it up and
over. A final lunge and he was out on the deck. The hatch-cover
crashed down again and Lorraine's quick fingers had battened it
down.</p>

<p>Now the other, the engine-room hatch, the only other way out for
the killer. Dan lifted, whirled aft to dash to that. And saw a
white form flick across the window of the after house.</p>

<p>Good Lord! Marge was on her feet, was free! Marge! Killer too!
And the gun, the gas-gun was somewhere there, on cabin floor or
companionway. If she found that! Dan swerved in his run, sprang up
the bridge companionway, plunged through the door of the
chart-room.</p>

<p>The woman, still unclothed lifted to him from her searching
stoop. "You," she snarled. She backed to the further wall.
"You!"</p>

<p>Dan's eyes flicked around the cabin, saw cut rope on the floor,
saw the sharp blade of Tom Keegan's knife.</p>

<p>He started in. He must overcome her, truss her up again, get
back to the engine-room hatch and fasten that before the other
killer could find his way up and out. "Come here, you
she-devil."</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> Something thudded against his skull from behind.
The world exploded in whirling stars. Dan tottered, sank to one
knee, shook his head to clear it. He wasn't out, but he hung there,
not up, not down, and his legs, his arms would not obey the frantic
commands of his brain.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across him. Great Jupiter! It <i>was</i> Pete,
huge, repellant, his face blood-bathed. Pete whom they had left,
weltering in mud and gore, miles back across the tossing sea! His
lips were drawn back in a bestial snarl, his eyes blood-shot. And
in his hairy hand the thick black muzzle of the gas-gun snouted!
The gas-gun&mdash;Pete, ghost or living man, had found it!</p>

<p>But Pete wasn't looking at him, the gun was not pointed at him.
Its black muzzle was aimed at Marge; at Marge, standing statuesque
in her near-nakedness.</p>

<p>Miraculously, the fear was gone from her face. She was smiling,
actually smiling...</p>

<p>"Hello Pete," she said, quite calmly. "Where did you come
from?"</p>

<p>"From hell." The man's voice was hoarse, pain-shot. "By way of
the big trunk on the back of your car, and the stinking hold of
this lousy ship. I came from hell, to take you back with me."</p>

<p>Oddly enough Dan found that he could think quite clearly, though
his limbs were paralyzed. The man, sorely wounded, had dragged
himself a quarter of a mile to the hangout, had gotten into the
car-trunk while the two were inside! But Marge was talking...</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, Pete," she said, "but not there. Look..." Her
movement, as always was lightning quick. She had bent, flung back
the lid of the iron-bound chest, had lifted again. "Look, Pete, the
loot's all here..."</p>

<p>The man's red eyes strayed to the chest, but the gun remained
cocked, steady on Marge. Dan looked too, saw bundles of green
bills, a coruscating heap of gems, flashing a blaze of color. "It's
all here, Pete, all that your mob collected while we kept Granport
dazed, and we won't have to split it."</p>

<p>The big man grunted. "No. <i>I</i> won't have to split it.
You're through, double-crosser. You're through. You're going to get
the mummy death you gave the cops."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Marge said sharply. "Wait!" Dan could see her breast
heave, but her face was calm, steady. "That isn't for me, Pete. Not
for me. It was for the cops that hauled me into their back room and
gave me the third degree trying to get a line on Stan Kanio. For
the cops that blasted down Stan when he was all through and going
away with me to run straight. But it's not for me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes it is," Pete growled. "I'm going to use it on you and
then I'll laugh while you lie there, your pretty skin brown paper,
your eyes white marbles." His mouth twisted. "White
marbles&mdash;they won't haunt my dreams any longer..."</p>

<p>Marge moved a little, and a sinuous wave ran through her body.
Dan saw Pete's eyes flame. "Oh yes, they'll haunt you, Pete.
They'll haunt you, and my lips that you might have kissed, and my
body that might have been yours&mdash;if you hadn't destroyed it.
Look!"</p>

<p>Her white arms rose and fell, her hair dropped, a cascade of red
gold, snaked along her white, glorious shoulders, slid lower till
it half-cloaked the glow of her body. The semi-concealment
enhanced, somehow, the lure of her, the blood-heating aura that
shimmered about her. "You can't destroy this..." she purred, and
came closer to Pete. "Not this..."</p>

<p>Lorraine could see the terrible struggle in the blood-smeared
visage above him, the killer-lust fighting with that other lust the
white form of the woman engendered. "You can still have it, Pete.
You can have me and the loot your mob gathered while the cops
shivered for fear of us."</p>

<p>She moved slowly closer, while Pete's thick lips worked. "You'll
double-cross me again," he growled.</p>

<p>"I won't!" She was very close to him now. "Wasn't I straight
with Stan in those police back rooms? Wasn't I straight with Stan
even after they murdered him? You wanted me,
Pete&mdash;and"&mdash;her eyes were veiled&mdash;"I wanted you, but
I told you you had to wait till I had avenged him, till I'd made
them pay for what they did to me. And now"&mdash;her fingers
touched the gun in his hand&mdash;"if you don't use this we can
both have what we wanted..." Her hand closed around it. "Or you can
pull the trigger and have only the loot. Go ahead, Pete." Her voice
throbbed, challenging. "Pull it."</p>

<p>"I can't," Pete groaned. "I can't&mdash;God help me!" She had
the gun now. "Marge&mdash;" His big-thewed arms spread wide. "Come
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leaped back. "I'll come&mdash;like hell!" The fiend was in
her eyes again. "You devil... I found out yesterday that it was you
that tipped the police to Stan's getaway, so they'd kill him and
leave me for you. Well... I did a bum job with the knife, but this
won't fail."</p>

<p><i>"No, Marge. No!"</i> the man shrieked.</p>

<p>The black discharge of the gun caught him as he jumped. A single
scream came from within the ebony cloud, and the thud of a falling
body.</p>

<p>The woman slipped around the edge of the thinning cloud. Her
eyes darted to Dan, still half-crouched. "Now you!"</p>

<p>Dan exploded from his crouch. His fist flailed the gun from her
hand, he crashed into her.</p>

<p>They catapulted across the cabin, crashed against the bunk. Dan
heard the sickening snap of bone, felt the woman's form go limp
beneath him. He pulled himself away, saw gray eyes glazing in a
white face, saw blood dyeing red lips.</p>

<p>Those lips moved. "Stan," she whispered. "Stan dear. Wait for
me... I'm coming to you. And the cops can't get us there..." The
great glazing gray eyes looked up into Dan's face, a smile touched
the pain-tortured mouth. "Stan!... You've come for me." A white arm
swung up, swung around Dan's neck, pulled his head down. "Kiss me,
Stan dear..."</p>

<p>And with pity strong within his heart, he kissed her...</p>

<p>The bloody lips against which his own were pressed went suddenly
cold. The form within his arms quivered, was still.</p>

<p>Looking up, Dan Lorraine saw, through a porthole, drab dawn
break in a clouded sky.</p>
