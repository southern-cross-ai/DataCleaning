  mind-shattering secret it harbored&mdash;until the gates of hell yawned wide,
  and the maimed and ravished form of her dearest friend became the mute,
  terrible omen of what was in store for her own horror-shaken body...</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; TRAPPED BY THE CLOUDBURST</h2>

  <p class="first">ELISE GORNOFF whirled as she glimpsed the sudden swoop of
  some black, phantasmal thing from the corner of her eyes. A soundless scream
  constricted her throat...</p>

  <p>But there was nothing there! Nothing at all was in the huge, beam-ceiled
  living room of the house on Phantom Island, save the black shadow-shapes that
  always lurked here, more fearsome now because of the approaching storm's
  lurid murk... Then for a single, searing instant, the age-darkened grain of
  an oaken wall seemed to writhe, as though something were melting into it!</p>

  <p>A rumble of thunder from the leaden sky faded, and the black surge of
  terror in the girl's veins ebbed. Her delicately modeled mouth quirked in a
  brief smile of bitter self-mockery.</p>

  <p>She was silly, childish, to be so startled. There were no evil wraiths on
  Phantom Island, despite the old wives' tales that had kept island and house
  uninhabited until Serge Gornoff had brought his bride here. Two hundred feet
  across the west branch of the River was Waterville, a bustling, congested
  city. There was nothing to fear...</p>

  <p>Wood scraped against wood, beyond heavy portieres that cut off her view of
  the hall beyond. Elise's heart thumped. They were coming out of the
  mysterious room whose entrance was a secret panel in that hall's oak-lined
  wall. Serge was coming out of it, and Nikita and Pavel. Their dull footfalls
  broke the cowering stillness of the house.</p>

  <p>In what dreadful ritual did they engage in that room she was forbidden to
  enter, forbidden even to mention? The old, futile indignation flared up in
  Elise. She was Serge's wife! Even though he were fifteen years older, she was
  his wife and had a right to share his secrets. A better right than the two
  servants, even though they had accompanied their <i>barin*</i> on his flight
  from the vast, dim Russia that had rejected him and his class. She should
  long ago have demanded to know... But she was afraid to know.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Russian <b>&#1073;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1085;</b>:
  pre-Revolutionary term for "lord" or "master."]</p>

  <p>The curtains swung apart, and Serge Gornoff came through them. "My dear,"
  he said. He moved across to Elise, his feet whispering on the rug. The girl's
  throat pulsed at the sight of his tall, distinguished figure, and her love
  for him was a dull pain in her breast. "You are beautiful, here in the
  dimness. Like a white flame. A lonely flame." His ascetic face was lined with
  weariness, not of the body so much as of the soul, and pain dwelt deep in the
  dark-wells of his eyes. At his temples a hint of white edged the iron
  lustrelessness of his hair.</p>

  <p>"I am always lonely, Serge." Elise swayed toward her husband, gave him
  both her hands. His were icy, but they closed on her slim fingers and clung
  with a strange fierceness, as if he were afraid that she would be taken from
  him.</p>

  <p>It was this savage possessiveness of his love that had made her marriage a
  long agony of loneliness. He had isolated her on this island, had cut her off
  from all her old friends in a semi-Oriental seclusion...</p>

  <p>"Tonight it will not be so lonely here, when our guests come."</p>

  <p>The girl's heart thumped suddenly with warm gratefulness. He was actually
  looking forward to their arrival. He was human, after all... Thunder, nearer,
  deeper, growled in the heavens.</p>

  <p>Gornoff glanced at the lurid, glowering oblong of the window. "Or perhaps
  they will not come." He seemed disappointed. "This is no pleasant place in a
  storm."</p>

  <p>"That isn't stopping them. I watched them cross the footbridge from the
  mainland, a while ago. They're climbing up the hill, through the woods. They
  <i>are</i> coming..."</p>

  <p>A voice from the hallway interrupted her. "They come, <i>panya."</i> Elise
  turned to face the bent figure in the archway. Nikita's grey, stringy hair
  straggled across her hook-nosed, witch's face. <i>"But they not go
  away..."</i></p>

  <p>With an exclamation of sudden anger Elise sprang across the room.
  "You...!" Her fingers dug into fleshless bone of the woman's arm. "What do
  you mean?" Wrath choked her voice. Wrath and icy, sudden fear. "What...?"</p>

  <p>"Elise." Gornoff s voice was suave, unexcited. "You forget
  yourself..."</p>

  <p>The girl whirled to face him, her grip on the hag unrelaxed. "No, Serge.
  I've just remembered myself. I've just remembered that it is I who am
  mistress here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A vast, rumbling torrent of sound cut her off&mdash;a roaring that
  battered against the house from without. The stone-walled edifice, the very
  ground beneath it, shuddered under the tremendous detonation...</p>

  <p>Gornoff, in the window bay, stood taut and quivering against the glare of
  blue lightning. <i>"Bozhe moy,"</i> he grunted. "Good Lord! The River..."</p>

  <p>Elise, her passion suddenly puny against whatever cataclysm had loosed
  that detonation, found herself standing beside him. There was no rain as yet,
  but a roaring, solid gale pressed the forest down; and beyond it&mdash;beyond
  and below&mdash;a twenty-foot wall of water rushed down the river
  channel.</p>

  <p>It thundered down on the footbridge. There was no longer any bridge, there
  were only a few tumbling sticks of timber harried by a chaos of rushing,
  foaming water. The base of the island was engulfed. The low river-bank
  streets of Waterville across the incredibly widened stream vanished.</p>

  <p>"A cloudburst in the hills!" Gornoff exclaimed. "Look." Elise turned in
  the direction of his pointing finger. The northern sky was menacing midnight
  black. "We're cut off from the mainland. Your friends will have to stay here
  longer than they thought."</p>

  <p>"Cut off!" The girl gasped. Was that what Nikita had meant? But how could
  she have known...? "Serge! They're in the woods. Will they...?"</p>

  <p>"Here they are." A wind-tossed figure appeared at the edge of the clearing
  before the house, then another; but something in her husband's tone pulled
  Elise's gaze away from them, to his face. Fingers of icy fear squeezed her
  heart. That patrician face was darkened by virulent hatred. The eyes were red
  embers...</p>

  <p>"Serge! I..."</p>

  <p>No, she was mistaken. It was only that the black pall over the sky had
  thrown a shadow across Serge's countenance, only that his pupils had mirrored
  a lurid streamer of angry sunset that had broken through the clouds in the
  west.</p>

  <p>"What, Elise? What were you saying?"</p>

  <p>"I... I forgot to tell you. Beside my sister Naomi, the Falks, and Dick
  Tyler and May Bailey&mdash;I asked Hugh Rayne too."</p>

  <p>They were struggling across the clearing, clinging to one another against
  the wind's blast, the girls shrieking with bewildered laughter at their own
  helplessness...</p>

  <p>"Rayne... Oh yes, the young man who I displaced in your affections."</p>

  <p>Why did Serge say it so slowly, so gloatingly...? "I thought perhaps that
  being here with Naomi, he would decide to like her as well as he once thought
  he liked me. I thought..."</p>

  <p>Gornoff didn't seem to hear her. "That makes it perfect," he was saying.
  "Perfect."</p>

  <p>What did he mean? Elise moistened her lips, and felt a weird, vague fear
  at her husband's words. Suddenly she knew she shouldn't have asked Hugh Rayne
  to come to this house. She shouldn't have asked any of them. It was a trap.
  It was a place of black menace&mdash;and Serge Gornoff...</p>

  <p>"Elly. Elly dear." A small, slender girl burst through the drapes,
  pattered toward her sister. Naomi Wilson was blonde as Elise was dark, her
  red lips made for kissing. "Isn't it a shame. Hugh couldn't come with us. He
  said he'd get over later, but now he won't be able to... what? What's that
  you said?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, dear. Only that I am glad that <i>you</i> got here safely." But
  Elise lied. What she had said was, "Thank God&mdash;thank God."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; SOUVENIR OF MURDER</h2>

  <p class="first">DICK TYLER and Wally Falk had wanted to go back to
  Waterville. The flood, they feared, had spread wide destruction in the
  low-lying slums along the riverfront, and help would be needed. But there was
  no boat on Phantom Island, and even if there had been it could not have lived
  in the seething torrent the river had become. So perforce they had to remain,
  to May Bailey's palpable relief.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're losing a chance to be a hero, Dick," she said, grinning
  impishly. "That's all right with me. I look swell in black, but grandma's
  wedding dress is a dream, and it would be a shame not to wear it."</p>

  <p>Wally Falk laughed, curtly, bitterly, at that, and Elise Gornoff caught
  the flicker of a strange look in Ida's hazel eyes as, slitted between long,
  dark lashes, they had flitted from her husband to May. There had been rumors
  about those two, Elise had recalled...</p>

  <p>After dinner, in the living room, Elise became poignantly conscious once
  more of gnawing, baseless dread. The night lay black against the window
  through which she stared, and the sound of rain on the glass was like pale,
  blind fingers fumbling at the pane. The wind rose, moaning...</p>

  <p>"Like a woman wailing for her demon lover," Naomi quoted, pressing close
  to her. "That's how I feel tonight. I wish&mdash;oh Elly&mdash;I wish that
  Hugh had come."</p>

  <p>"He's grand, isn't he," Elise murmured, "with his broad shoulders and his
  laughing eyes, and his tousled red hair one always wants to smooth?"</p>

  <p>"Elly," Naomi laughed teasingly, her voice louder than she intended. "I
  believe you're still in love with Hugh. Is that why...?"</p>

  <p>Elise didn't hear the rest. She had a sudden feeling of harsh, inimical
  eyes upon her, and whirled about to find her husband watching her, his face
  contorted into a mask of almost maniacal rage.</p>

  <p>The girl gasped&mdash;and the look was gone. Had she imagined it? Had he
  heard... Pavel, simian-armed, barrel-chested bulked between the parted
  curtains. His clothes were wet with the rain.</p>

  <p>Serge swung around, as if instinctively he knew the man was there. Pavel
  beckoned. Gornoff's feet whispered across the rug. The drapes swung shut
  behind the two.</p>

  <p>Tiny chills scampered Elise's spine. Definitely there had been something
  furtive about the way Pavel had signaled Serge... Nonsense. He acted only as
  a well-trained menial should... But there was a sound of wood scraping on
  wood, out there in the hall.</p>

  <p>They were going into the secret chamber! Even with guests in his house
  Serge couldn't keep out of there! Was it <i>because</i> there were guests in
  the house...?</p>

  <p>"Elise," Ida Falk called from the floor where she was curled, a small
  bundle at Wally's feet. "I wish your husband would tell us some more stories
  about Russia's glorious past. He..."</p>

  <p>"I'll do better than that." Serge's voice announced his return. "I'll
  bring you a voice from that past." He had a book with him, a tome so huge it
  took both his hands to carry it. The leather with which it was bound was
  scuffed, ragged, and greenish with age. "Perhaps it will tell us things the
  old Boyars knew, things that men have forgotten." His wife had never seen
  that volume before. Had it come from the hidden room?</p>

  <p>Gornoff placed it on a table, carefully. "All the world has heard of
  Rasputin," he continued. "The last Tsar and his family were completely under
  his uncanny dominance; and it was because of him the dynasty ended in the
  scarlet of fire and of blood. All Russia called him the Mad Monk. He was not
  mad. He <i>was</i> a monk. But he <i>did not</i> serve God."</p>

  <p>They were sitting up now, Ida, and May, and Hal, and Wally. Something in
  Serge's low accents, a green flicker of flame in his black eyes, was gripping
  them. Naomi moved closer, and Elise's hand went out, as if to snatch her baby
  sister back from the brink of some yawning, invisible chasm...</p>

  <p>"Rasputin&mdash;his body at least&mdash;was killed one frosty midnight by
  a group of nobles more loyal to the Tsar than the Tsar himself." Gornoff's
  voice quivered with some obscure, remembered emotion. "Those who killed him,
  too late, were executioners&mdash;not assassins. Nor looters. There was only
  one thing missing from the contents of his house where so many men&mdash;and
  women&mdash;had lost their souls. This book."</p>

  <p>He smiled. That smile was a grimace of nickering mockery, making almost
  satanic his thin, sardonic face. "There is one section that appears to be the
  basis of that modern pastime of numerology you have all played with and
  laughed at. Would it amuse you to test the ancient method?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, what fun!" May exclaimed, her eyes sparkling. "Let's!"</p>

  <p>But Elise wanted to scream, "No!... <i>No!"</i> And wondered distractedly
  why she felt such an impulse.</p>

  <p>"We shall start with you." Pencil and paper lay on the table beside the
  book.</p>

  <p>"M-a-y-B-a-i-l-e-y." Serge was jotting down the letters, performing some
  abstruse calculation. "Your number is one-two-four." He opened the book, ran
  a finger down a crackling, parchment page. "Here it is."</p>

  <p>Gornoff's fleshless lips moved silently, as though he were translating.
  Then: "Beneath a shimmer of sunlight on rippling waters, a warm spring wells,
  wherein love may find quiet nurture..."</p>

  <p>"How in hell...!" Tyler ejaculated. "You couldn't know that." His arm was
  around his sweetheart, drawing her close to him. "I'm the only one who knows
  what this kidding little nuisance really is."</p>

  <p>Again that flitting lip-movement of evasive irony. "The hand that wrote
  that is dead a thousand years. The truth is eternal if one only knows where
  to look for it. When Miss Bailey's mother named her, she fastened upon the
  babe her nature&mdash;and her fate. Her fate... There is more. Listen. 'But
  too soon death's frost will clutch the green-gleaming lake, and still its
  laughter forever.' "</p>

  <p>"I told you I was a cold proposition Dick," May laughed. "Watch out."
  There was no humor in her laugh...</p>

  <p>"I say," said Wally Falk, starting forward. "This thing's likely to make
  one or two of us damned uncomfortable. Why don't we try it on someone who
  isn't here. Someone we all know..."</p>

  <p>"Hugh Rayne," Naomi breathed. "Please, Serge. Work it out for Hugh
  Rayne."</p>

  <p>Gornoff shrugged. "Very well." His pencil was busy again. Elise could not
  be quite sure, but she thought a tiny muscle twitched in his sallow cheek. He
  finished his calculations, turned a page or two... read...</p>

  <p>Suddenly he closed the book with a bang, his lined features bleak, his
  lips drained of blood. "Perhaps we had better do something else."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Naomi demanded. "What did it say, Serge?"</p>

  <p>His hand was trembling. "I had rather not."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," exclaimed Dick Tyler. "You can't leave us up in the air like
  that. Read it."</p>

  <p>"There was very little there," said Ida Falk, peering over Gornoff's
  shoulder. "Only five words. All the other numbers had a lot after them."</p>

  <p>"What did it say, Serge?" Elise bit her lip. She didn't want him to
  answer&mdash;but she had to know. She had to know what the esoteric volume
  had said about the man she was planning to mate with her sister.
  "Please."</p>

  <p>"If <i>you</i> ask it," Gornoff bowed, "my dear." He opened the book
  again. Quickly, too quickly, he found the right page. Almost as if he had
  kept a finger between the leaves to mark it. Was his reluctance only
  feigned?</p>

  <p>He read the guttural, harsh syllables aloud, the meaningless Russian. And
  then he translated.</p>

  <p>"Six&mdash;sixty-six&mdash;" he said, tonelessly. "The number of the
  beast."</p>

  <p>The words were followed by a sudden, queer hush&mdash;a silence in which
  dread seeped into the very bones of the listeners, penetrating skepticism as
  the chill of an early spring rain pierces even the thickest clothing...</p>

  <p>Naomi whimpered. "The beast. What... what...?"</p>

  <p>Dick Tyler answered her. "I know. I remember it from comparative religions
  at college." His fresh, young voice seemed to affront the brittle silence.
  "The beast is the incarnation of the great antagonist, the avatar of evil. He
  roams the earth in the dark and the tempest, seeking those whom he must
  destroy. The old chiromancers had a word to evoke it. It&mdash;it's on the
  tip of my tongue. I've got it. It's..."</p>

  <p>"Stop," Elise shrieked. "Don't say it. Don't..."</p>

  <p>Nikita suddenly appeared beside Gornoff. She laughed her cackling,
  senseless laugh. It ended in some gibberish&mdash;a single word...</p>

  <p>An earth-splitting, stunning thunderclap seemed to wipe out the lights in
  the room. Utter blackness fell solid-seeming in its impenetrability. A cold
  wind blasted past Elise, a draught from some frozen hell. An invisible form
  brushed against her arm, wet and shaggy, and an unshod foot thudded on the
  floor somewhere in front of her. A man cursed...</p>

  <p>Then the scream rose out of the blank darkness, a livid crescendo of
  uttermost terror, of excruciating, unearthly anguish. It stabbed into Elise's
  quivering heart like a lance, rasped her taut nerves... It ended,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>Before the girl could move, before she could throw off the nightmare
  paralysis that held her, the thing brushed by her again. Its brief touch was
  revolting to her skin, the clammy touch of something long dead and mossy with
  rottenness. An odor of noisome putrescence trailed after it&mdash;and was
  gone as that icy draught shut off...</p>

  <p>It had been a woman who screamed&mdash;a girl! Was it Naomi? <i>Was
  it..</i>.? There was a bubbling sound in the darkness that was worse than the
  scream. There were no intelligible words, but its meaning was clear, too
  dreadfully clear...</p>

  <p>"Light," a voice shrieked. "Light..."</p>

  <p>A match sputtered. Its tiny flame flared, steadied. The darkness withdrew
  a little from white, staring faces&mdash;from a crumpled heap on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Elise could not make out the color of the shreds of flimsy fabric torn
  from a once-white, lacerated body. The same dark-glistening, viscid fluid
  that obscured it made the writhing face a gory mask. But the hair&mdash;it
  was close cropped, tawny! Relief, damnable, selfish relief caught in Elise's
  throat. It was not Naomi who lay there, contorted in incredible anguish. It
  was...</p>

  <p>"May!" The name wrenched from Dick Tyler in a great sob, and he was down
  on his knees beside his sweetheart. "Almighty God! <i>May!"</i> His hands
  were suddenly gloved with red as he gathered her in his arms.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;" Wally choked&mdash;"What happened? Who...?" Rain lashed
  Elise, from behind. She realized that the window was open.</p>

  <p>"Here," she called, not aware that her cry was a shrill, eldritch shriek.
  "Out here through this window&mdash;it went..."</p>

  <p>They rushed at her, pell-mell, went past her, snarling like a pack of
  rabid hounds. Dick, with his scarlet, clawing hands, led them, his face a
  mask of death save for the eyes from which a terrible wrath blazed. They
  clambered out through the window, went pounding across the clearing.</p>

  <p>"Keep together," Elise heard Serge command. "Keep together for
  protection..." The rest was lost in the threshing of heavy bodies in the
  wood's underbrush.</p>

  <p>Nikita was standing in the archway, and there were two lit candles in her
  gnarled hands. Their radiance fluttered across her countenance. It was a face
  out of some delirium, a harpy's face...</p>

  <p>May was not dead. Even that mercy was denied her. Red bubbles rose on her
  torn lips, as she tried to form words. She was saying something&mdash;but
  what it was no sane mind could have conceived!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">ELISE GORNOFF fought her way out of the cloak of black
  horror that enveloped her. "Stop the blood," she croaked. "We've got to stop
  it..."</p>

  <p>Those ghastly wounds were jagged-edged, shredded... They had been made by
  no knife, by no conceivable weapon a human being would use.
  Fangs&mdash;claws&mdash;had torn May Bailey&mdash;mangled her. The fangs and
  claws of some ravening, giant animal whose presence on the island had
  hitherto been unsuspected... Some beast...</p>

  <p>Beast... The words Gornoff had read from the ancient, occult book flooded
  back into Elise's numb brain: "The number of the beast!" The nape of her neck
  bristled with ancestral fear...</p>

  <p>A shout from outside brought her whirling around to the window. A shout:
  "Here he is"&mdash;and the pound of running feet. Without conscious volition
  she went out through the doorway. The wind pounded her. The rain stung her.
  Blacker against black, figures were visible at the edge of the woods.
  Drenched, gasping, Elise reached them.</p>

  <p>The men were stooped over a dark form, inert on a crushed bed of tall
  grass... The sky went blue with livid lightning...</p>

  <p>"Rayne!" Wally Falk exclaimed. "It's Hugh Rayne!"</p>

  <p>Incredibly it was Hugh Rayne! Sprawled there senseless, rain drenched.</p>

  <p>"The beast," a voice squealed, unrecognizable, and Dick Tyler leaped at
  the prone man. His darting hands were red with May's blood, against the pale
  glimmer of Hugh's face... Snatching fists grabbed Dick, were dragging him
  away...</p>

  <p>"He's the beast," the squirming youth shrieked. "The book said so..."</p>

  <p>"Wait." Serge's injunction was even-toned, calm as ever. "We must make
  sure. He cannot get away, and..."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't he." Sudden recollection prompted Elise's denial "I felt the
  killer pass. He was shaggy, repulsive."</p>

  <p>Was she sure? Faint, almost intangible, that same odor of putrescence hung
  about her even in the driving rain. But another lightning flash showed her
  Hugh's drenched raincoat, and it was of smooth rubber. There was a blue
  bruise on his forehead, under his wet-plastered red hair.</p>

  <p>"You felt him!" Serge's voice. "Elise! It might have been you instead of
  May!" A strange note in it. Was it of fear? Or threat?</p>

  <p>Rayne groaned, checking the fevered speculations in Elise's brain. He
  quivered, thrust big-thewed arms against the ground, shoving himself up to a
  sitting posture. "What...?" he mumbled thickly. "What's going on...?"</p>

  <p>"What's <i>your</i> story?" Wally Falk demanded, somewhere above Elise.
  His tone was sharply authoritative, as she had heard it once in court. He was
  cross-examining Hugh, making him talk while he was still half-stunned, and
  incapable of fashioning a plausible lie. "What happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know exactly." Rayne pressed a hand to his forehead.
  "Someone hit me... jumped me out of the dark. The house lights had just gone
  out... I couldn't see who it was..."</p>

  <p>"How did you get here? The bridge is gone."</p>

  <p>"Worried about you folks. 'Phone line out. Stole a boat... Guy's fist was
  like a club. My head's still ringing..."</p>

  <p>Relieved breath hissed from between Elise's teeth. It was like Hugh to
  have risked his life if he thought his friends needed help. An electric flare
  washed the macabre scene with blue light, and she saw there was no blood on
  his hands or his clothing. The storm could not have washed it entirely
  away... But a furtive doubt lingered.</p>

  <p>Wally Falk voiced it. "How on earth did you mange to keep a boat afloat in
  that freshet?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I... It was hell. I..."</p>

  <p><i>"Who's there?"</i> Dick, spinning, shrieked the challenge.
  "Who...?"</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tyler." Gornoff murmured. "Steady. There's nothing..."</p>

  <p>"Someone's in the brush. Watching us. I heard... <i>Listen."</i></p>

  <p>The blackness was grotesque, ominous with gigantic forms felt rather than
  seen. Were they only the trees? Only... Someone, <i>something,</i> breathed,
  heavily, close by.</p>

  <p>The men half-crouched, tensing to meet an attack, cowering in a grisly
  fear. Elise tried to turn, to dash back to the shelter of the house, but her
  limbs were water-weak, would not obey her. Serge left the group, walking
  stiff-legged into the terrible darkness.</p>

  <p>"Gornoff," Rayne exclaimed, surging to his feet, "you..."</p>

  <p>A groan came out of the midnight murk into which Serge had gone. "Pavel!"
  he exclaimed. "It's Pavel..."</p>

  <p>That released the others from the terror that held them rigid. But as they
  got to where Serge Gornoff was standing above his servant they huddled
  together again, huddled as sheep do scenting the prowling wolf near their
  byre.</p>

  <p>"Pavel!" Gornoff said again, sharply, and the Russian sank to his knees
  beside the prone figure of his servant. Nikita, Elise thought, must have lit
  a lamp in the house, for yellow light sifted now through the trees. She saw
  that Pavel clutched a gnarled, thick club in one ham-like fist.</p>

  <p><i>"Pan,"</i> he husked, <i>"gdye..."*</i></p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Russian: "Sir, ... where?"]</p>

  <p>"Talk English," Serge snapped. "They all want to know."</p>

  <p>"Lights go out, master. I look kitchen window, see someone,
  something&mdash;how you call?&mdash;gray, run away from house. I run after,
  hit with club. Hit hard, he no hit back. But everything go black... Then you
  say my name."</p>

  <p>"Was it this man you hit with your club?" Wally thrust Hugh Rayne forward.
  "Was this he?"</p>

  <p>Pavel peered at Hugh, hesitation, doubt in his uncouth, broad-sculptured
  countenance. Then, "No. Other big. Big. Like... man-monkey."</p>

  <p>"That's what the fellow jumped me seemed like. A white ape, man-size." Did
  Rayne snatch at the suggestion too eagerly? "Smelled like one too. I remember
  that now. It was the smell I noticed first, just before he hit me."</p>

  <p>Elise's spine prickled. The thing that had attacked May had carried a
  fetid odor with it, and bristly fur had scraped her as it passed. Was there
  truth in the old, grisly legends about Phantom Island...? She thought of
  something.</p>

  <p>"Serge! The girls are alone in the house. Shouldn't we...?"</p>

  <p>"Get back to them!" Falk interjected. "Good Lord! We're fools, leaving
  them alone..."</p>

  <p>They were running across the clearing. Someone boosted Elise through the
  open window. Her wide-eyed glance searched the desecrated room for her
  sister, found her.</p>

  <p>Naomi's face was ghastly, her dress blood-smeared. "Elly!" she gasped. "Do
  something for May. Do something..." It was May's blood that was on the blonde
  girl. She was all right, unhurt. May was on the couch, they must have lifted
  her there. Her hand was shoved with fierceness of unendurable torture against
  raw, glistening flesh. Ida Falk was dabbing her with an ineffectual
  handkerchief, a wisp of fabric dyed carmine...</p>

  <p>"Where's Nikita?" Serge demanded. "Where's that woman?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know." Naomi's pupils were dilated, so that the blue of
  her eyes had given place to black in which hysteria flared. "There was a
  scraping noise from inside, and she went into the hall. She hasn't come
  back."</p>

  <p><i>"Bozhe moy!"</i> Gornoff exclaimed and lurched out through the
  curtains, Pavel close behind him. That room again, Elise thought,
  inconsequently. Always that damnable room.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;who did that to her?" asked Hugh Rayne in a shocked voice. All
  this was happening in seconds, was overlapping. "Who did...?"</p>

  <p>"You ask that!" Dick shrieked, whirling to the red-headed man, springing
  at him, gore-gloved hands clawing. <i>"You..."</i> Rayne lifted startled arms
  to protect himself. Elise threw herself between them.</p>

  <p>Wally grabbed Tyler, pinning the frantic lad's arms to his sides. "Stop
  it, Dick," Elise cried, her voice choked with grief and terror. "You're
  keeping us from helping May. May needs our help, and we can't give it to her
  if you act like this."</p>

  <p>"May!" Dick moaned. He stumbled blindly toward the couch.</p>

  <p>Serge Gornoff came through the portieres, gaunt, unsmiling. The lamplight
  glinted on something silvery in his hand. Elise saw that it was a hypodermic
  syringe. Serge went to the couch. Just as Dick reached it, the gleaming
  needle sank into May Bailey's lacerated arm. There was something ghoulish in
  the way Gornoff stabbed the torn flesh, something that prickled Elise's spine
  with a queasy chill. But the dreadful moaning stopped.</p>

  <p>"We cannot telephone for a doctor," Serge said, "and if we could it would
  be impossible for one to reach us. But fortunately I have some smattering of
  medicine... Elise&mdash;if you will wash out these wounds with hot water and
  bandage them..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Serge." It was a relief to have something to do. A relief not to
  have to think...</p>

  <p>"I've got this window locked," said Wally, turning away from it. "How
  about the others, and the door? There's a chance the&mdash;whatever it
  was&mdash;will come back."</p>

  <p>"An idea. If it will avail anything." Serge's brooding glance rested
  briefly, significantly, on Hugh, turned back to Wally Falk. "You and Pavel
  make the rounds down here, Mr. Falk. I shall go upstairs, with Mr. Rayne. I
  have a gun, the only one in the house."</p>

  <p>"We'd better leave that here with the girls, hadn't we?" Rayne suggested.
  "I don't know yet what it's all about, but if there's any danger..."</p>

  <p>"No." Gornoff answered flatly. "The danger will not be here." If
  <i>you</i> are not; he might as well have gone on to say, thought Elise. He
  still suspected Hugh... Or was he trying to build up suspicion of him in the
  minds of the others? Suspicion that had its beginnings in that eerie sentence
  in the book&mdash;the book that only Serge Gornoff could read?</p>

  <p>He picked up one of the candles, Wally the other. As the three men
  trampled out through the portieres, Elise glimpsed Pavel in the hall. He was
  standing in front of the place where the secret room was concealed by its
  sliding panel. Had he just come out of it?... The curtain swished back into
  place.</p>

  <p>A shiver ran through the girl's slender body, as she realized that there
  was left in this room only three frail, helpless women, and a moaning youth
  whom grief and horror had made worse than helpless.</p>

  <p>The chimney of the lamp was already blackened by soot, so that its light
  was dim, and the great chamber again a place of eerie, threatening
  shadows.</p>

  <p>Ida snatched at her arm. "Elise," she chattered through blue lips, "I'm
  scared, in..."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be frightened of any more," said Elise. She had found
  some new well of courage from which to draw. "We've got to take care of May.
  I'll go and get some hot water from the kitchen. Nikita always has a kettle
  on, for her interminable tea."</p>

  <p>"I'll go." Naomi jerked out. "I know where it is." Before her sister could
  object, the girl's slender form slipped through the archway drapes. Elise
  started to follow.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me alone here," Ida whispered fearfully.</p>

  <p>Elise swung around, read in the wide hazel eyes confronting her the tale
  of nerves jangled to the breaking point, ready to abdicate to shrieking
  madness.</p>

  <p>"All right," she said, quietly, trying to calm the other by her own forced
  calmness. "I won't. Help me get the clothes off May so we'll be ready when
  Naomi gets back."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Ida whimpered. "We've got to..." The effort she was putting forth
  to control herself showed in the throb of the pulse in her corded throat, in
  the way her small fists were clenched, nails digging into her palms.</p>

  <p>"Dick." Elise put a gentle hand on the sobbing man's shoulder. "Go over
  there and sit down. You're in the way."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, moving jerkily, like an automaton. Elise bent to the
  couch...</p>

  <p>Running footsteps pounded. Upstairs. Through the muffled sound of fists
  pounding on wood, of heavy soles kicking at a door. Wally's voice roared:</p>

  <p>"Hugh! Gornoff!" And then it broke into shrillness. "They're in there.
  They must be in there. What's happened to them?" Shrill and jittery.
  "Gornoff!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; VANISHED!</h2>

  <p class="first">WALLY FALK'S thin cry was a flailing whiplash, striking
  terror to Elise's heart. Serge! Something had happened to Serge! In that
  searing instant her doubts, her fear of him were gone, and her love was
  reborn in a terrible fear for him. She whirled, and ran up the dark obscurity
  of the broad staircase outside.</p>

  <p>A splintering crash met her on the landing above. Lightning glimmer was
  blotched by two hulking forms lurching through a door they had battered down.
  Elise threw herself after them, past the ripped casing. An acrid tang was
  sharp in her nostrils.</p>

  <p>The smell cut her lungs with tiny slicing knives, vertigo swirled in her
  head. She gasped, pulling in air, cold and wet and refreshing. Her vision
  cleared and she was aware of Wally Falk at a window, of curtains bellying in
  with the draught that had cleared away the choking fumes.</p>

  <p><i>"Barin,"</i> Pavel groaned, bending over something on the floor.
  "<i>Barin...</i>"</p>

  <p>There was light in the bedroom, dancing light from a candle to which Falk
  had touched a match flame. Serge was sprawled on the floor, and Hugh Rayne.
  Their faces were dough-yellow in the flickering candle-light...</p>

  <p>"We were through downstairs, came up here to look for them," Wally
  whispered, his aplomb shattered at last. "They weren't in any of the other
  rooms, and the door to this one was locked."</p>

  <p>"Are they&mdash;are they...?" Rayne rolled, staggered to his feet and she
  did not need to finish her question. Serge pulled in a single, gasping
  breath, sat up. The revivifying air had worked swiftly.</p>

  <p>"What happened, Serge? What happened?"</p>

  <p>They seemed unhurt. Only dazed, bemused...</p>

  <p>"Rayne went into this room first, and I was close behind him. He stumbled
  against me. My candle went out. I smelled something&mdash;and that was all I
  knew till this moment."</p>

  <p>"Gas," Falk supplied. "Some kind of gas. I got a whiff of it as the door
  gave way, felt it getting me. That's why I jumped to fling this window
  open."</p>

  <p>"That's it." Rayne said thickly. "That's what knocked us out. But I
  thought I saw someone in here before I caved."</p>

  <p>"Door locked," Pavel put in. "No key."</p>

  <p>"Someone asphyxiated us and locked us in," Gornoff mused, maintaining a
  calm, strange demeanor&mdash;uncanny under the circumstances. "But he did not
  harm us. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe the&mdash;whoever it was that attacked May&mdash;was hiding up here
  while we were looking for him outside." Falk suggested. "Maybe he's still in
  the house."</p>

  <p>"He is still in the house." Gornoff<i>'s</i> eyes rested on Rayne,
  voicelessly accusing him once more. "There is no doubt of that."</p>

  <p>"We went through all the rooms downstairs, and all up here but this one."
  Falk had collected himself again, but under his left eye a little muscle
  twitched and would not be still. "No one passed us on the stairs."</p>

  <p>"There is another set of stairs, in the rear." Gornoff said. He bent and
  picked up something from the floor. "He could have avoided you that way."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand how he got so strong a concentration of gas in here,"
  Falk pondered, "without making it airtight, first."</p>

  <p>"This is how," said Gornoff, straightening. He held out a palm on which
  some sharp slivers glinted. "He broke a globe or ampoule of thin glass just
  as we came in, probably smashed it against the jamb. And..."</p>

  <p>"Elise! Elise!" Ida was calling from below. "What's happening up there?
  What...?"</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Ida," Wally called, striding through the door. "No one's
  hurt."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you come down? Why is everybody leaving me alone down
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Alone!" Elise was suddenly cold. She swung around. "Isn't Naomi there?
  Didn't she come back...?"</p>

  <p>"Naomi? No. Isn't she up there?"</p>

  <p>"Up here...?" Comprehension exploded in Elise's skull. "No..." Naomi had
  not returned from the kitchen <i>and the backstairs led right down into
  it!</i></p>

  <p>Elise ran through the dark passage outside, threw herself down the
  light-less well at its other end. "Naomi!" The cry tore her throat.
  <i>"Naomi!"</i></p>

  <p>No answer! The kitchen, lit only by red glow from the range, was starkly,
  appallingly empty, and there was no one in the dining room she could see
  through the open door.</p>

  <p>Had Naomi opened that door? Had she gotten that far? There were no signs
  of a struggle anywhere...</p>

  <p>"The door's locked from the inside," Wally Falk said. "The window hasn't
  been opened." Elise hadn't been aware they had followed her, but the men were
  here, were scattering through the ground floor rooms. Rayne called in from
  the dining room that the windows there, too, were tightly barred.</p>

  <p>"She is in the house, then," Gornoff growled. "She must still be somewhere
  in the house."</p>

  <p>"Find her. Do something to find my baby sister." Elise choked, sobbing.
  There was no strength any longer in her limbs. There was no reason in her
  mind. There was only the vision in her eyes of Naomi as she might now
  be&mdash;a bedraggled, mangled ruin of a body such as lay out there on the
  couch. "Find her, if you love me."</p>

  <p>"Falk!" Gornoff snapped. "Come back upstairs with me. Pavel, you take
  Rayne down into the cellar."</p>

  <p>They were gone. Elise could hear trampling feet upstairs, could hear dull
  noises made by the searchers below. They were hunting the house for
  Naomi...</p>

  <p>They were searching the house&mdash;but they weren't looking for Naomi
  where she must be. Where Elise knew now she must be.</p>

  <p>Serge Gornoff had told them where to search. But he hadn't told them of
  the secret room in the long hall on this very floor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly something snapped in Elise's brain, and the girl laughed madly.
  Serge was fooling them all...</p>

  <p>"Elise!" Her wild laughter, that had brought Serge back down the stairs to
  her, choked off. "Why are you laughing like that?"</p>

  <p>"I was laughing at what a fool I have been," screamed Elise, "loving you,
  trusting you&mdash;like a fool!" She leaped at him, her curled fingers
  clawing for his eyes. "Give me back my sister. Give her back..."</p>

  <p>His hands caught her wrist, and they were manacles of steel holding her in
  an inescapable grip. "I am trying to find her for you," he said, still with
  that curious, frightening quiet of his&mdash;that calm which nothing seemed
  to break. "I am searching for her."</p>

  <p>"You lie," Elise shrieked. "You lie. She's in the forbidden room. You know
  she's in there. That's why you didn't say anything about it. That's
  why..."</p>

  <p>She checked, terrified even in her rage. She had broken through his
  unnatural calm at last. His face was suddenly colorless. It was like marble,
  its expression stiffly menacing and demoniac wrath burned deep in his eyes.
  The basilisk glare held her, paralyzed. Even if her life had depended on it,
  she could not have moved.</p>

  <p>Words seethed from his stiff, white lips. "So it was for that, you asked
  your lover here. To spy upon my secret. You have failed twice, and you will
  not succeed the third time."</p>

  <p>"What...?" the accusation shocked her into speech. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>But she knew...</p>

  <p>"He tried to scare everyone out of the house with his attack on the girl.
  That failing, he suffocated me with his gas, slipped down here to force the
  door. Your sister interrupted him. He disposed of her somehow, heard Pavel
  and Falk start upstairs, got back up there in time to lock the room and
  pretend to have met the same fate as I. Now you..."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Elise screamed at her husband, her love for him metamorphosed to
  virulent hatred. "That is very plausible&mdash;but it doesn't fool me. It was
  you who played that trick on <i>him.</i> You hate all my friends because
  <i>you</i> have no friends. You hate Hugh because of mad, uncalled for
  jealousy. When you consented to my having visitors here you made your plans.
  Your plans for murder, with suspicion pointing at him. That's why you were
  disappointed when you thought he was not coming. That's why you brought in
  the book when Pavel told you, that because he was unselfish and brave, Hugh
  had managed to reach the island. It's you..."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you wench..." Gornoff's right hand let go its hold on his
  wife's wrist, and rose to strike her in white passion...</p>

  <p>A thunderous thud that shook the house with its impact stopped that
  blow.</p>

  <p><i>"Bozhe moy!"</i> Gornoff gasped, whirling to face the hall door from
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>A scream sliced through the house, piercing, agonized. "Wally!"</p>

  <p>It cut off. Gornoff darted out into the hall from which that thud, and the
  scream, had come. Elise got to the doorway, and halted. At the foot of the
  broad front stairs Ida stood as rigid as a statue, the lamp from the living
  room held high in her paralyzed hand. Its light sifted down on the thing at
  her feet, on the thing at which she stared, open-mouthed, her face frozen by
  ineffable horror after that first ear-piercing scream.</p>

  <p>As Gornoff reached it, Elise saw what that thing was. A bundle of clothes,
  collapsed like a pricked balloon. Pulp oozing from it. Quivering, smashed
  pulp that had been a man once. No fall could have done that to him. He had
  been <i>hurled</i> down from above, with incredible force!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; SATAN'S EMISSARY</h2>

  <p class="first">WALLY FALK lay smashed against the floor as a rotten apple
  might be smashed wantonly against a wall. His pulped body had burst through
  his clothing. But unholy joy throbbed in Elise Gornoff's breast.</p>

  <p>Serge hadn't done that. Serge had been in the kitchen with her and he
  hadn't done that thing!</p>

  <p>Instantly the fierce elation was quenched by a surge of quivering
  self-disgust that this should be her first reaction, and then a new terror
  probed her brain. If not Serge, who? <i>Wally had been alone up there!</i>
  The others, Pavel and Hugh Rayne, were in the cellar...</p>

  <p>Were they? Either was strong enough, powerful enough to have lifted the
  lawyer and flung him down...Had one overcome the other, slipped upstairs to
  attack Wally?</p>

  <p>Elise Gornoff prayed that this was so. The alternative was...
  unthinkable.</p>

  <p>A door burst open, under the slant of the stairs, and Pavel lurched out of
  it. Pavel&mdash;and Hugh, behind him. Both dust-covered, smear-faced with the
  dust and soot of the basement. They caught sight of Gornoff bending to the
  grisly mass, rushed toward him...</p>

  <p>Elise caught hold of the jamb to keep from falling. None of the three
  could possibly have been above. Someone&mdash;or some <i>thing&mdash;</i>else
  prowled the house. Some fiend incarnate, unseen, perhaps unseeable, had
  mangled May Bailey, murdered Wally&mdash;and carried Naomi off to its grisly
  lair!</p>

  <p>"Naomi!" the shuddering girl whimpered. "Naomi."</p>

  <p>What macabre doom had befallen her? Where was the laughing-eyed, endearing
  sister, whose chubby hand she had held in her own, teaching her her first
  toddling steps?</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it," Ida wailed; her voice knife-edged with sheer madness.
  She whirled, dashed through the portieres.</p>

  <p>"She's gone mad," someone gasped. "She'll kill herself." They were gone,
  hurtling through the portieres after the hysterical girl. Elise was alone in
  the dark hall, alone with that horror...</p>

  <p>Alone and unwatched in the hall where the panel was behind which lurked
  that secret room. Out of the swirl of terror encompassing her, the girl
  remembered her earlier thought. Naomi might be in there. She might...</p>

  <p>This was her chance, her only chance. She needed no light to find the
  spot, to grope for the shrewdly simulated knots in the graining that were the
  open sesame, knowledge of which she had nursed in her bosom, not daring to
  use. She thumbed them. That too familiar scrape of wood on wood grated at her
  feet, and she felt the apparently solid fabric slide aside.</p>

  <p>The noisome odor of putrescence swept toward Elise from out of the dark
  void that was opening in front of her. Her nerves tensed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a scratching, mewling fury pounced out upon her. Slicing claws
  ripped her face. Bony fingers knotted on her throat. A form battered against
  her, flinging her back&mdash;a skeleton clothed in swirling, sleazy fabric.
  She was on the floor of the hall. She was whirling over and over in a
  snarling, primordial battle with a harridan who bit and scratched and yowled.
  She was fighting back; biting, gouging, clawing; civilization stripped from
  her; fear blasted out of her. She had become a primitive woman, battling for
  her life...</p>

  <p>Desperation and rage against the evil mysteries in this place, coupled
  with her youth and natural strength, soon gave Elise the advantage over her
  grisly antagonist. She clenched a scrawny, dry-skinned throat with her hands.
  Tightened her grip.</p>

  <p>A clutch fastened on her shoulders, dragging her up and away from her
  victim. The throat she throttled came up with her; then fingers tore her grip
  away. Elise's vision cleared. She saw candlelight dancing on Nikita's
  prostrate, gasping form, realized that it was Gornoff who had separated them.
  That Pavel and Rayne were gaping at her. Saw Dick Tyler's white face, to
  which some semblance of intelligence had returned.</p>

  <p>"What on earth?" Hugh groaned. "What now?"</p>

  <p>"I come from pantry," Nikita gasped. <i>"Panya</i> try to kill me."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" Elise flared. "You jumped out at me from the secret room.
  You've got Naomi in there and..."</p>

  <p>"What room, my dear?" Gornoff's countenance was ashen, bleak as the visage
  of a soul condemned to eternal torment. "What room do you mean?" His low
  voice was still steady, still controlled, but there was a quiver in it now,
  as though he were holding on to himself only by the exertion of an
  indomitable will.</p>

  <p>"You know what room. That one." Elise tore herself from his grasp, whirled
  about to point toward it. "The one you never let me enter. That's where
  Naomi..." She gasped. The wall was solid-seeming as though there never had
  been an opening there! "You've closed it!"</p>

  <p>"I closed nothing, my dear. I do not know what you are talking about."</p>

  <p>"You don't know... I'll show you, then. I'll show you." She flung herself
  at the panel, thumbed the swirls in the graining that would open it.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened. Nothing at all.</p>

  <p>"You've locked it," she screamed. Her fingers fumbled at the borders of
  the panel, she was trying to dig with her nails into interstices that didn't
  exist. She pounded madly on unyielding wood.</p>

  <p>"Naomi! Naomi!" she shrieked. "Let me in to her! Let me in to my
  sister."</p>

  <p>Then she couldn't pound any more because Dick and Pavel were holding her
  arms, were pulling her away from the wall. "God!" Hugh Rayne grunted, drawing
  a shaking hand across his forehead. "She's..."</p>

  <p>"Hysterical." That was what Serge said, but he meant&mdash;mad. "No
  wonder, with all that has happened."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I will be all right, now," she muttered.</p>

  <p>A terrible weariness welled up within the girl, the languor of defeat and
  despair. May, Naomi, Ida. The gruesome night had taken them all. She was the
  only woman left within this infernal house. Nikita, scrambling to her feet,
  was not a woman. She was a sexless avatar of weird hate, a witch-woman who
  had evoked some monstrous entity that ravaged and slew, and made of the
  storm-beleaguered house a shuddering enclave of hideous evil.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right now," Elise said again, repeating the words in the voice of
  a dazed child. "Serge. Hugh. Dick. I shall be all right, if only you will
  find Naomi. If only you will find my little sister for me."</p>

  <p>There were tears in her eyes as she looked from one to the other of them,
  tears that burned like acid. "Please find her. Please." And in her breast
  there was leaden despair. Could they help her? <i>Would they?</i> Dick Tyler
  was a white-faced, quivering non-entity, his grief and his fear making him
  less than a man. Pavel was&mdash;Nikita's mate. The
  others&mdash;Serge&mdash;Hugh&mdash;the finger of suspicion had pointed to
  each in turn. "Find my baby sister. If you love me..."</p>

  <p>The tiny green candle-flames of hell flickered again in Gornoff's brooding
  orbs. His lips whitened. But it was Rayne who spoke first. "We can't leave
  her alone," he groaned. "She's likely to..."</p>

  <p>"I shall take care of that," Gornoff interjected, and his hand came out of
  his pocket. It held the hypodermic syringe with which he had given May Bailey
  relief, the plunger only half-down. Before Elise could jerk away, before she
  could shriek her protest, he had bared her arm and plunged the gleaming
  needle into it.</p>

  <p>The steel slid sickeningly in, and the syringe plunger squeezed down. A
  warm tingle spread up Elise's arm from the wound, tracing the punctured
  artery. Nausea twisted at the pit of her stomach, twisted in her brain. The
  hall blurred...</p>

  <p>An unintelligible voice muttered something. She was being lifted, she was
  being carried somewhere. Oblivion blotted consciousness...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">NAUSEA twisted at the pit of her stomach. The blackness in
  which she lay was charged with some deadly threat, with shadow shapes that
  took forms of unearthly menace, and dissolved, and reformed again to swoop
  down upon her...</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the terrible gloom a pinpoint of light pulsed&mdash;steadied.
  It was the soot-dimmed wick of a kerosene lamp, and the vague light it gave
  did little to dissipate the gloom of the raftered living room of the old
  house on Phantom Island. Slowly the understanding came to Elise that she was
  slumped in a high-backed, high-armed chair, carried there no doubt after the
  narcotic had taken her senses from her.</p>

  <p>She was faced anglingly toward the front of the room, perhaps to avert her
  gaze from that which lay on the couch and babbled. But whoever had placed her
  so had forgotten the oval mirror on the wall. Darkly in that mirror she could
  see what was behind her.</p>

  <p>She could see the body of May Bailey on the couch. She could see Dick
  Tyler, a statue of pallid fear standing against the dark folds of the archway
  portieres, his white fingers clutching a weapon of some sort, half-lifting it
  as though every muscle, every sinew of his quivering frame were ready to lash
  out at an unseen antagonist. There were beads of cold sweat on the youth's
  pallid forehead, and there was no color, no color at all, in his face.</p>

  <p>Otherwise the murk-walled room was vacant. Of Ida Falk there was only a
  wet stain on the window curtains to show what had become of her.</p>

  <p>Elise tried to speak to Dick, but it was as though her vocal chords had
  become paralyzed. No sound came from her lips! They had not even opened. She
  was incapable of speech&mdash;but she had to get his attention somehow. She
  had to know what was going on. If she got up out of the chair, showed him
  that she was awake...</p>

  <p>She couldn't. She had no control of a single muscle. The opiate, whatever
  it was Serge had injected into her veins, held her in a weird catalepsy, in
  which she was fully conscious but incapable, utterly incapable of movement.
  Her brain was alive; fiercely, poignantly alive; but her body was dead.</p>

  <p>It was then that madness swooped down on Elise Gornoff, like a black,
  enveloping cloud. She could feel her reason slipping away from her under the
  impact of the horror with which she was surrounded and submerged in.</p>

  <p>She knew she must not give way to it. If she went mad Naomi would be
  alone, utterly alone and without hope, in this house of dreadful doom.</p>

  <p>But Naomi perhaps was dead. God grant that she was dead. Even terribly,
  like Wally Falk. God grant that she was not lying somewhere, torn, shredded,
  mangled, like May Bailey...</p>

  <p>Or that a worse fate had not overtaken her.</p>

  <p>She must think of a way out&mdash;for herself and for Naomi. She could at
  least force herself to think, to trace out the truth in the chaotic delirium
  of the night's happenings. Then, when and if the effects of Gornoff's dose
  wore off, she might know what there was for her to do. It would be by
  thought, and thought alone, that she would be able to fight off the grisly
  madness that threatened her.</p>

  <p>Think... Who of those in the house might be responsible for what was
  occurring there?</p>

  <p>Not any of the girls. Not Dick. Not Wally Falk.</p>

  <p>Nikita was somehow involved in it. But Nikita alone could not have done
  the things that had been done. She had neither the strength nor the
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>Pavel? He might have attacked May, stunned Hugh Rayne. But he was in the
  cellar with Hugh when Wally... Those two had been in the cellar then, and
  Serge had been in the kitchen with her...</p>

  <p>Inevitably, then, there was someone else in the house. Some one or
  <i>something</i> else. Was it some thing of demoniac terror, materialized
  from the storm and the ancient legends of Phantom Island, from the ancient,
  weird past of the island that had kept it uninhabited...?</p>

  <p>The secret room was bound up in the mystery, and the brooding, almost
  tangible fear that had tormented Serge, that she had sensed was dogging him
  from the first day she had met him. It had been that sense of torment, of
  inescapable dread that had drawn her to him. Something in that room that he
  had hidden from her, hugging his dread secret to himself as the Spartan boy
  hugged the wolf that gnawed at his vitals.</p>

  <p>What did she know of that room? Only that something fearful went on in
  there. Only that he had brought the syringe, and the liquid it contained,
  from there. He had brought the book from there...</p>

  <p>The book! Wait... What was it he had said about the book? "There was only
  one thing missing from Rasputin's house, where so many men and women had lost
  their souls. This book." How had it come into Serge's possession? Was he one
  of those men who had invaded that lair of iniquity, bent on purging Russia of
  him who was consummating her downfall? They had been nobles, the story went,
  princes and barons...</p>

  <p>"He was not mad. He was a monk, but he did not serve God." Serge had said
  that. And he had said, "They killed him&mdash;his body at least&mdash;"
  <i>Only his body,</i> he had meant! Rasputin, the dark essence of evil that
  had consummated the ruin of a nation, had not been killed. <i>Could not be
  killed...</i></p>

  <p>Those who were known to have been members of that midnight band of
  patriots, were known also to have died, horribly... Elise knew at
  last&mdash;knew as surely as though he had told her&mdash;what it was from
  which Serge Gornoff had fled his Russia. What terror it was he had fled from
  and which had pursued him across half a world.</p>

  <p>And she knew what it was he had been doing in that hidden room.
  Frantically, desperately, with feverish hope and icy despair, he had been
  combing that book of Satan's secrets for some formula to use against the
  vengeance of Satan's servitor. Against the time when the monk, who was not
  mad and who did not serve God, should find him out at last.</p>

  <p>What an agony of hellish fear his life must have been! No wonder he had
  turned pale when Pavel had come in to tell him that someone inexplicably had
  attained the island, despite the flood and the storm. No wonder something
  transcending terror had gripped him when that very book had informed him that
  that man bore the <i>number of the&mdash;beast!</i></p>

  <p>In that instant blackness had smashed down and the terror had begun. They
  had found Hugh Rayne outside the window. Stunned. Or pretending?</p>

  <p>But Elise had known Hugh all her life. He could not be...</p>

  <p>What if Hugh Rayne had been drowned in the flood? What if that which had
  come to the house out of the night and the storm were Hugh Rayne's body
  indeed, but animated by some other spirit? Some grisly temporary tenant of
  that body, which, for its own dark purposes had...</p>

  <p>Elise never finished the thought. A flicker in the mirror stopped it, a
  slither of cautious stealthy movement. In the splotched glass, the portieres
  were stealthily moving behind Dick Tyler. Slowly, with infinite stealth, they
  drew minutely apart&mdash;and a hand slid soundlessly through the aperture.
  Or was it a hand? The silvery fingers were curled, claw-like, and they ended
  in long, sharp talons that were brown and granular with dried blood. The
  wrist, the arm behind, were shaggy, bristling with hair of a gleaming,
  startling <i>whiteness.</i></p>

  <p>A scream formed in Elise Gornoff's breast&mdash;but it found no utterance.
  Held rigid and voiceless, she could not warn the youth. She could not...</p>

  <p>The claw struck, swift and silent as a snake. It fastened on Dick's
  throat. The nails dug into quivering flesh. Little scarlet jets spurted from
  the wounds they made. Little fountains of scarlet death...</p>

  <p>Dick hung, a limp, doll out of which the scarlet sawdust had run, beneath
  the silver-grey hand. The curtains bellied inward to the pressure of an
  unseen form. The claw opened and the flaccid body dropped from it, straight
  down, no stiffening to it at all. The drapes moved apart.</p>

  <p>The killer slid into view.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; NAOMI'S FATE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE thing that swayed in the doorway was an apparition out
  of the depths of such a hell as man in his most macabre imaginings could not
  have devised. It was a silver, wraith-like obscenity against the somber
  background of the drapes, a huge hulk clad in a black monk's robe that hung
  open to reveal a pelt of bleached, shaggy bristles, the precise shade of
  those blind things that wriggle under wet rocks in the dank depths of a
  light-less forest. Its furred legs were columnar, its arms thick-thewed and
  powerful as those of a gorilla. It had no neck&mdash;and it was faceless.</p>

  <p>There was only hair where the thing's face should have been&mdash;curled,
  colorless hair that made of its head a shaggy monstrosity. And yet, in some
  manner, the creature must have been able to see. For that featureless head
  moved, while it swayed momentarily in the archway, as though it were scanning
  the room. Its claws, the one scarlet with new blood, the other brown with
  old, opened and closed beside its ponderous thighs, opened and closed as
  though still avid for the feel of quaking flesh within their grasp, as though
  hungry for the feel of screaming life ebbing from beneath their terrible
  grip.</p>

  <p>Elise Gornoff was unable to move. But she cowered within the chair,
  cringing from the horror of that which was in the room with her, while blind
  terror ran riot in her veins.</p>

  <p>A sound came from out of the depths of the thing's throat&mdash;a sound
  that was a hollow, deep-chested chuckle, as his unseen gaze found and rested
  on the shrinking, pitiable girl on the couch. A lascivious chuckle of glee at
  the sight of his handiwork.</p>

  <p>He liked what he had done! Red fury exploded in Elise's brain. Her fingers
  curled in a small fist...</p>

  <p>Her fingers had curled! They had moved! <i>The dread paralysis was
  fading.</i> Too late! A sob gurgled, far back in her throat...</p>

  <p>The pale monster heard it! He launched into movement, into padding, swift
  movement. He reached the chair whose high back had hidden her, might have
  kept her safe had it not been for that single, uncontrollable sob. He reached
  the chair, and swung about in front of it. And again he laughed. That laugh
  was a hideous, hissing whisper, more fearful than any growl. An arm lashed
  out, its hand clutching...</p>

  <p>Elise jerked backward, with the newly found small strength that had
  returned to her, and the talon that had aimed to rip her throat caught in the
  neckline of her frock instead. It ripped the fabric, tearing it away from the
  girl's gleaming skin, exposing the swelling curves of one dimpled
  breast...</p>

  <p>The white-furred monk was suddenly motionless. Elise felt his inscrutable
  gaze on her, devouring her, sliding over her body, that of it which was
  exposed and that which seductively was still half-concealed. Clearly as
  though he had spoken she knew the thoughts in its brain.</p>

  <p>And then the beast lashed out again. One hot palm clamped over her lips to
  stifle a beginning scream. The other arm slid around her waist, pulled her
  against the bristling, repulsive body. The gagging hand slid away and a
  lipless, hairy face nuzzled her lips.</p>

  <p>Somewhere, far off, there was the sound of thumping footfalls. Were Serge
  and Rayne coming, in time to save her? Would they get here in time?</p>

  <p>The girl's small fists beat frantically on the monstrous, noisome chest
  against which she was hugged. Waves of repulsion shuddered through her.
  Overpowering even her terror was the sense of defilement with which the
  thing's touch sickened her.</p>

  <p>His body was no longer pressed tight to hers. She had won. The fury of her
  defense had driven him away from her, and gained for her the few moments time
  needed for rescuers to reach the living room. The sound of their slow
  footfalls were nearer. They were in the hall...</p>

  <p>The gagging hand slapped across her mouth again.</p>

  <p>The Monk chuckled. He slung her effortlessly up from the floor, swung
  around, and in a single lightning-like surge of movement was out through the
  window, was dropping lightly to the ground. Elise dangled from his arms like
  a broken puppet, knowing it was useless to attempt to call out, useless to
  attempt to struggle. The white thing was carrying her off to his lair in the
  woods...</p>

  <p>But Elise's captor was not headed for the woods. He was loping around the
  house, keeping close to the foundations. He went around a corner, and
  abruptly he was climbing. Straight up the rugged stone wall he climbed, over
  a decorative ledge...</p>

  <p>The ledge was not wholly ornamental. It protruded from the wall just
  sufficiently to hide from below an aperture in the stone, a window Elise had
  not known was there. Her captor thrust her through that window, held her
  suspended while he squirmed in after her. They dropped into a dim glimmer of
  light.</p>

  <p>This was a room, narrow but long. A lamp on a table gave it light. There
  was a padlocked cupboard, a chair. The further end was closed off by a
  ceiling-high partition of steel bars.</p>

  <p>And behind that cell-like wall Elise could see in that one fearful glance
  a bed. A tousled bed, and on it&mdash;was it joy or consternation that burst
  in a white glare of fire within her brain&mdash;on that bed lay Naomi, stark
  naked.</p>

  <p>Elise twisted about, realizing for the first time that the beast no longer
  held her. He was crouched against the wall opposite that through which they
  had entered. He seemed to be listening.</p>

  <p>The scarred, unfinished wood of that wall told the girl what it was. The
  inner side of the panel in the hall! She was in the secret room, at
  last...</p>

  <p>A bundle of rags at the thing's feet moved. A bony hand flung out from it
  in a spasmodic, involuntary movement. A wisp of fabric fluttered away from a
  cadaverous face&mdash;Nikita's face!</p>

  <p>Something clinked on the floor, falling out of the old woman's clothing. A
  key! The clink jerked the white monk around. He bent swiftly, snatched up the
  key. He swayed for a moment, his faceless visage turning, now to the panel,
  now to Elise, now to the bars that intervened between him and the nude,
  unconscious form of the girl for whom Elise had searched so long. Back and
  forth, back and forth, as though the possession of the key he clutched in his
  blood stained claw enforced upon him the necessity for some decision with
  which his mind could not cope.</p>

  <p>Elise knew what the dilemma was with which the white-haired thing
  struggled.</p>

  <p>She was here, ready to his hand, to his lust. The other was behind the
  bars, to get at her he must go there, must fit the key into its lock. But it
  was the other, Naomi, who had first inflamed him.</p>

  <p>He seemed suddenly to come to a decision. He loped, with that uncannily
  soundless shuffle of his, down the length of the room. His hand fumbled at
  the lock in the cell door, and metal clinked against metal as he struggled to
  fit it in.</p>

  <p>Elise's desperate glance darted about the chamber, searching for a weapon.
  There was none. And if there had been, with her feeble strength, what good
  would it have done?</p>

  <p>But she <i>had</i> a weapon. Woman's strength. Her body.</p>

  <p>"Look," Elise screamed. "Look at me." With a single frantic tug of her
  shaking hands she tore from herself what little clothing there was left to
  cover her. "Look."</p>

  <p>The beast twisted about, growling.</p>

  <p>She stood there, a white, flowerlike glow in the dimness, her arms
  outstretched to him, every inch, every luscious inch of her perfect body a
  separate seduction. The very nausea that pulsed within her, the very
  revulsion which drove the blood from the surfaces of her sculptured figure,
  to leave it pallid and gleaming, made her ineffably, ineluctably
  desirable.</p>

  <p>"Come to me," she whispered. "Come."</p>

  <p>And he was coming. Slowly, as if to tantalize with anticipation his
  boiling blood, as if to savor to the last poignant drop the lust that drove
  him, the white beast came.</p>

  <p>Five feet remained between them, four. His breath reached Elise, the
  leprous stench of his body, the putrescent odor of a sepulcher. Three feet...
  Two. "God forgive me. God..."</p>

  <p><i>"Panya!"</i> Nikita's screech was a cry from hell itself! The old woman
  was somehow on her feet, was lurching between them. "No. No!" There was a
  whip in her hand. It lashed out.</p>

  <p>A roar of rage, bestial, overwhelming, blasted from the beast. He leaped.
  His claws fastened on the screaming old woman. She whirled aloft. Smashed
  sickeningly against the stone wall under the window&mdash;became a pulped,
  red horror...</p>

  <p>Elise was in the monk's arms. His bristles rasped her skin. His harsh
  palms stroked her flanks...</p>

  <p>The world exploded in a splintering crash, in a chaos of shouting voices,
  of smacking blows. Elise was flung out of the maelstrom, hurled against the
  wall, slid unnoticed to the ground. Somewhere near her a woman screamed,
  shrilly, unendingly. Pavel's face appeared out of the mad tumult that whirled
  in the center of the room. Hugh's. They <i>were</i> obliterated by the
  silvery hair of the Devil's Monk.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Serge Gornoff reeled out of the whirlwind, his chest bare, gory,
  his countenance a writhing mask of satanic fury. He bent, snatched up a long,
  ragged splinter of wood from the shattered panel, leaped in at the
  combatants, leaped out again.</p>

  <p>The wood in his hand dripped blood that spattered on the stone floor of
  the secret room. There was sudden silence in the chamber, a silence that
  hurt. The swaying mass split. Pavel and Hugh staggered back from it. The
  white monk lay, a shuddering, writhing, incredible form, on the floor. His
  robe was torn from him and his chest was no longer white, but a mass of
  matted, gory hair.</p>

  <p>"Nikolai! Nikolai!" Serge Gornoff was on his knees beside the dead
  monster. He was lifting the shaggy head in straining arms. "Nikolai." The
  name was a heartbroken cry wrenched out of a strong man's soul by unutterable
  grief. "I had to&mdash;do it."</p>

  <p>Somehow, in that moment, the monk's head was no longer faceless. Elise saw
  that the eyes, the features, had been obscured by a wiry, overgrown beard, by
  hair that had grown straggly and wild to fall down over his forehead and meet
  that beard.</p>

  <p>"Elly. Elly." Naomi's voice. "Get me out of here."</p>

  <p>The key was still in the lock. It was Elise who first got to the door, who
  turned the key. Naomi, quivering, shuddering as though never again she would
  be free of hysterics, was in her sister's arms.</p>

  <p>"Elly. It was awful. He caught me in the kitchen and carried me into this
  room. The old woman saved me. She was in here and she made him let me go. She
  locked me in here. Then I heard you calling me, and that other door started
  to open, and she jumped out. He tried to get at me then, and he couldn't. But
  he was so maddened by his efforts that he knocked her out and I thought he
  would get the key from her. Some noise outside distracted him, he listened at
  the panel, and then went out.</p>

  <p>"A little while later I saw him push you in at the window. I fainted
  then... Who is he, Elly? What is he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gornoff. It's about time you explained that to us," Hugh Rayne
  rasped, his face white, strained.</p>

  <p>Serge looked up, his countenance was like a bed of burned out ashes from
  which the fire had died. "My brother," he said simply. "Baron Nikolai
  Gornoff. The man who fired the shot that killed Rasputin."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I don't understand..."</p>

  <p>"Pavel drove the car in which Nikolai fled from the scene of his crime. He
  brought Nikolai to me, white-haired, a raving maniac. The book&mdash;I showed
  you outside&mdash;was clutched in his arms.</p>

  <p>"I hid him in our castle till the Bolshevist uprising forced me to flee. I
  brought him here then, with Pavel and Nikita, smuggled him into the country
  as the alien Chinese are smuggled. He became violent, but I had to keep him
  hidden. If I had revealed his presence, then we should both have been
  deported to Russia, and you know what fate we should have encountered. The
  only one he would let enter his cell was Nikita, but he wouldn't allow her to
  cut his hair. He had the idea that Rasputin's soul had entered his body, that
  he must take revenge on everyone else for that assassination of which he
  himself was guilty.</p>

  <p>"I tried every way I could learn to cure him. One way was treatment with a
  certain asphyxiating gas. It must have been an ampoule of that which he used
  to knock the two of us out. When May Bailey was attacked I knew that somehow
  Nikolai had gotten loose. Even then, even in spite of all the terrible things
  he did, I tried to keep the secret. I must have been&mdash;a little mad
  myself by then."</p>

  <p>"But I can't understand how he got free."</p>

  <p>"Nikita." It was Pavel who spoke. "Nikita. The <i>panya,</i> the mistress,
  struck her. She do it&mdash;for get even."</p>

  <p>"But it was she who saved me at the last," Elise broke in. "Pavel&mdash;I
  don't understand."</p>

  <p>"She not save you," the Russian said slowly, painfully. "She save
  the&mdash;how you say&mdash;honor of the House of Gornoff."</p>

  <p class="cp">Extract from the Flood Edition of the <i>Waterville Evening
  Star</i>,<br>
  printed on the presses of the <i>Haynesburg Daily Clarion:</i></p>

  <p class="quote">It was learned this morning that a party of four who were to
  be the week-end guests of Mr. and Mrs. Serge Gornoff at their home on Phantom
  Island were caught by the flood on the bridge to that island and swept away.
  They were Mr. and Mrs. Walter Falk, May Bailey and Richard Tyler, all of this
  city. Their bodies were recovered, so smashed by the debris carried down on
  the face of the freshet that they were identified only with difficulty.</p>

  <p class="quote">Miss Naomi Wilson, sister of Mrs. Gornoff, was miraculously
  able to reach shore, and was rescued from a tree to which she was clinging by
  Mr. Hugh Rayne, of Waterville, who was to have been one of the party but was
  delayed on business and managed to reach the island only with great
  difficulty later in the evening. A relieving touch is given to the tragedy by
  the announcement of the engagement of the two young people to be married.</p>

  <p class="quote">After the solemnization of the ceremony, which will be
  private, the Gornoffs and the Raynes plan to take up their abode on the
  mainland.</p><br>

  <h3>*</h3>

  <p>Far better, that pitifully tragic lie which blamed the flood&mdash;than
  that the whole ghastly truth be published for the world to read...</p>
