<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE KNIFE FROM
NOWHERE</h2>

<p class="first">THE road was wide and well-surfaced, as it would
have to be for the trucks I had seen back there in Roton, the huge
green tank trucks that brought their loads of Neosite fifty miles
to the nearest railroad. But on either side the light of my
headlamps sprayed out into a blank nothingness, and when the way
curved their beam swept over flat swampland, vacant and desolate.
The humid air, too, was heavy with a rank miasma, an odor of
putrescence. I felt seeping away from me the elation with which I
had started toward the biggest job of my career, the
superintendency, no less, of the plant whose cheap and
super-efficient product was driving other motor fuels from the
market. I tried to shrug off my growing depression, but it weighed
on me more and more heavily as the car that had been waiting for me
at the shipping point bored on into the night.</p>

<p>The highway lifted in a gradual rise whose crest was sharply
defined against the pale glimmer of an overcast sky. A chemical
engineer should have no imagination, but I had to fight off an
eerie feeling that there, just ahead, was the end of the world;
that beyond was sheer emptiness. My skin prickled as I saw a
formless black excrescence on that ominous skyline, a black and
brooding blob of too solid shadow...Then I neared and the
anomalous bulk took on human contour. Almost involuntarily my foot
lifted from the gas pedal, shifted to the brake and slowed the car
to a stop. I leaned out.</p>

<p>The fellow my headlight revealed was seated on the ground at the
roadside, his long thin arms clasped around gangling, up-bent
knees. I judged him to be young, about eighteen, but there was
ageless vapidity in his leathery, hollow-cheeked face, dull
incuriousness that was not youthful in the lackluster eyes with
which he met my own. I could read not even the intelligence of an
animal in his countenance; somehow it was flat and featureless as
the very swamp from which he appeared to have sprung.</p>

<p>"How far to Newville, buddy?" I called to explain my halt.</p>

<p>He looked at me, unblinking. He didn't reply, but the narrow rim
of his forehead wrinkled under his stringy, unkempt black hair. I
repeated my question in a louder voice, as if mere noise could
penetrate his stupidity.</p>

<p>"Five er ten mile." His husky voice was quite inflectionless and
his lips scarcely moved.</p>

<p>"Thanks." I couldn't keep the sarcasm out of my tone. "That
tells me a lot." I might as well have spared the effort; he seemed
already to have forgotten my presence, was staring unseeingly
through my car. I trod on the starter button...</p>

<p>Then, from somewhere beyond, a moaning wail sounded&mdash;low,
muffled, but vibrant with an agony that was somehow
uncomprehending. Like the plaint of a hurt cat it welled in a
crescendo of suffering.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I gritted. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Mom."</p>

<p>The youth showed not the slightest flicker of interest.</p>

<p>I tried to peer into the blank wall of darkness past my
headlights. "What's the matter with her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothin'. It's 'Lije. He's dyin'."</p>

<p>"'Lije?"</p>

<p>"M' brother." There was a slight tinge of expression in his tone
this time, of exasperation at my continued questioning.</p>

<p>I switched the car lights off. The wail came
again&mdash;unutterably sorrowful. The blackness faded. I saw a
bulk of darker shadow, ahead and to the left of the road, and a
pale rectangle of flickering yellow luminance that might be a
window. "Maybe she needs help," I said sharply. "A doctor."</p>

<p>"Ain't no doctor kin stop the Peelin's. Ain't no doctor nigher'n
Roton anyways." He sat like a clod, motionless, uncaring.</p>

<p>I slid to the ground and made for what was now defined as a
crazily leaning hut. Maybe I wouldn't do any good, but I couldn't
go on without finding out. I'm not built that way.</p>

<p>My feet sank into soft, sucking mire, found a narrow path of
muddy but firmer ground. There was no lock on the drab door of
unpainted rough boards and I pulled it open. A stench of decayed
food, human filth, was febrilely warm around me. There was another
scent, pungent and foul, that I could not identify. I stepped into
a cluttered, grimy room where one feeble candle flickered on a
debris strewn table. The beastlike wailing twisted me to a
corner.</p>

<p>The woman was on her knees, crouched over what was at my first
glance a flat pile of dirt-colored rags. The garment she wore was
pulled tight over the abject curve of her back and I could trace
the humped line of her spine showing through. Her hair was
scraggly, streaked black and gray; and broken, black-rimmed
fingertips curved claw-like over the thin lines of her
shoulders.</p>

<p>Apparently she had not heard my entrance. I moved toward her, my
lips parting to speak. And froze as I glimpsed that over which she
moaned.</p>

<p>It wasn't a face on that pallet of rags, not such a face as even
the foulest of nightmares could present. Nor was it a skull. That
at least is bone, clean and dead. This was stripped clear of flesh,
except where some blackened shreds still clung, but the bared
muscles were there, and white threadings of nerves, and there was a
quivering of agonized life over the blurred surface. The eyelids
were gone. From the dark pits they should have covered, sightless
balls stared a chalky, translucent white. Seared lip edges were
eaten raggedly away from a yellow, rotted grin. And the head had
neither nose nor ears. The rest, mercifully, was hidden from sight
by a dirt-crusted, tattered blanket.</p>

<p>I must have made some sound, though I was not aware of it, for
the woman turned. Had it not been for the other, her countenance
might have inspired horror in me, so lined with suffering, so
emaciated it was. Strands of bedraggled, grimy hair fell across her
brow, and from behind them her eyes glittered, rat-like. Something
like a rat, too, there was in the furtive startlement of her
expression, in the snarling lift of her thin lips.</p>

<p>"What d'yer want?" she squeaked.</p>

<p>"Your son told me you were in trouble," I managed to
speak&mdash;steadily, I hoped. "Is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Who're you?"</p>

<p>"Thorndal's new superintendent. I was&mdash;" The blaze of hate
in her face cut me off. She leaped to her feet and shrieked:</p>

<p>"Thorndal! Git out! Thet's whut yer kin do. Git out o' here.
He's done ernough ter me, he an' his devils!" She snatched up a
carving knife from the table. "Git out 'fore I fergit I'm a
God-fearin' woman an' use this on yer."</p>

<p>I dodged to the door. "But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But nothin'. Ye'll git th' other too&mdash;Zeke'll be thar
tomorrer! But he ain't yers yit. Not ternight." She lunged at me,
the knife sweeping in a long arc, and I dived out, slamming the
ramshackle panel behind me. I missed the path, and as I floundered
through the patch of swamp between hovel and road the door flung
open behind me. "I hope yer mother has to look at yer," the virago
shrilled after me, "a month from terday." Cackling, obscene
laughter rattled in the dark.</p>

<p>I lurched into my car, kicked blindly at the starter. The
roadside watcher, Zeke, had not moved, had not even turned his head
to the clamor. But he spoke now, above the roar of my motor, and I
throttled down to listen to him.</p>

<p>"Thar wuz a nut loose on yer license plate," he said. "I fixed
it."</p>

<p>Gears rasped and I hurtled away from there as if ten thousand
devils from Hell pursued me.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; EYES OF PITY</h2>

<p class="first">THE road along which I fled curved in a long line,
dipped, and rose again. The land to the left rose with it, and here
and there a tree showed, gaunt and somehow solitary against the
brooding quarter-light of the horizon. I realized that the ground
must be firmer here, firm enough to support the stills and gigantic
retorts shown on the blueprints Andrew Thorndal had displayed to
me.</p>

<p>He hadn't told me much about the process in the interview at
which I had been engaged, at a salary startling in these days of
slow recovery. There were non-patentable steps, he had explained,
in the manufacture of Neosite that his competitors would pay hugely
to purloin. "I'll go over the whole thing thoroughly when you get
out to Newville," he had rumbled. "Where I can make sure the
secrets won't be blabbered."</p>

<p>There had been a challenge, and a threat, in his steely eyes
when he had said that across our luncheon table at the Chemist's
Club in New York. I had met the challenge frankly. "My first
principle is loyalty to my employers, Mr. Thorndal," I had
responded. "Through self-interest if nothing else. A man in my
profession who does not adhere to that policy finds his career
ended very quickly."</p>

<p>The full lips had hardened grimly under his close-clipped gray
mustache. "Stick to that, Sutton," he said, "and we'll get along.
Otherwise&mdash;we're pretty well cut off from the world at
Newville and I have my own methods of dealing
with&mdash;traitors."</p>

<p>Cut off was right! I had asked him why there was no railroad
spur to the plant. Even then it seemed to me his reply was evasive.
Newville was surrounded by a thirty-five mile stretch of bottomless
swamp land; there were no other factories or towns in the region.
But the tremendous production of his own industry would have
rendered a one-track branch line profitable, and the well-built
highway along which I was now journeying could not have presented
any lesser engineering difficulties than the building of a
railroad. I wondered now whether his isolation was not
deliberate.</p>

<p>And my thoughts returned to the scene I had just left. The
flesh-stripped face of the dying man had not vanished from my
inward vision; it will, I am afraid, never entirely disappear. What
disease could have produced that condition? I am somewhat of an
amateur physician&mdash;one has to be in the outlands to which my
work takes me&mdash;but I could think of none. It wasn't
leprosy&mdash;that turns the sloughing tissue an unholy white. Cold
rippled along my backbone. <i>Was it a disease at all?</i></p>

<p>A cluster of lights came into view ahead. This must be Newville,
the small town Thorndal had built for his truck-drivers and skilled
mechanics. My headlight picked up a barrier across the road,
striped black and white for visibility, a tall, green-uniformed
figure standing in front of it. I skidded to a stop, and the guard
came alongside my running-board. There was a revolver in the hand
he lifted to the sill of the open window to my left, and his
heavy-jowled visage glowered forbiddingly.</p>

<p>"Who are yuh, and what do yuh want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I flushed at his overbearing manner, but one doesn't argue with
a man whose gun snouts at one's diaphragm. "Stanley Sutton,
officer," I answered. "I'm the new superintendent at the
works."</p>

<p>"Where's yuhr pass?"</p>

<p>I remembered a card Thorndal had handed me at our parting and
which I had inattentively stuffed into my wallet. I got it out. The
man scrutinized it, handed it back. "That looks okay," he muttered.
"Yuh're to park yuhr car in the garage an' wait there for
orders."</p>

<p>"I thought I was to put up in the town. Why&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin'." A secretive veil appeared to drop across
his face. "That's what I was told to tell yuh, an' that's all I
know about it." He didn't seem to be much impressed by my new
dignity. "The garage is straight on, 'bout a quarter mile. All
right, Joe."</p>

<p>He stepped back and a dim-seen figure to one side bent and
seemed to be operating a lever of some kind. The barrier lifted
jerkily, and I let my clutch in. Surely the guarding of a secret
process did not require an armed road patrol a mile or more from
the plant where it was being carried on. What was I getting into? I
fought down a sudden impulse to turn the car around and make for
Roton and civilization.</p>

<p>Would God I had obeyed that impulse!</p>

<p>I had no difficulty finding the garage to which I had been
directed. It was the first building I reached, stretching about
five hundred feet beside the highway and correspondingly deep. As I
rolled up to it I glimpsed rank upon rank of vehicles
within&mdash;tanks like those I had seen at Roton, enclosed vans,
platform trucks, six- and eight-wheeled trailers, all painted a
distinctive, vivid green. A number of green-uniformed guards
lounged in front of the structure; hard-faced individuals whose big
hands were never far from their holstered guns. There was an
electric feeling of tensity about the place, a brooding expectancy.
But it left untouched the overalled attendant who slouched up to
meet me.</p>

<p>He seemed of a different race. He was painfully thin, lax-jawed
and dull-eyed, cut from the same pattern as the lout whose sodden
indifference to his brother's terrible fate had appalled me more
than his mother's agony. They were typical of the natives of this
region, I found&mdash;an inbred, moronic species hardly fit for the
most unexacting of common labor, dregs of humanity. The man
regarded me bovinely.</p>

<p>"I'm Stanley Sutton," I said. "I was told to bring this car
here."</p>

<p>"Yeh. Yer ter wait."</p>

<p>"For whom? How long?"</p>

<p>"Dunno." The infinitesimal motion of his knife-blade shoulders
might have been a shrug. "Mister Mowrer 'phoned ter tell yer ter
wait."</p>

<p>"Who's Mowrer?"</p>

<p>"Unh?"</p>

<p>"Who is this Mowrer?" I repeated, slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Boss's secatary."</p>

<p>There was evidently nothing to be gotten out of the creature. I
slid out of the car to stretch my legs. The guards had clotted in a
knot, were pretending elaborate unconcern, but I knew, as one does
know those things, that I was the subject of their low talk, their
furtive inspection. This was natural enough; I was destined to
assume a rather important place in the community. Yet there was
something other than appraisement in the one or two glances I
managed to intercept, something very like compassion, it seemed to
me. Nonsense! Why should anyone pity me when I had just been given
a position men of twice my age might well envy?</p>

<p>A distant thrumming came to my ears, rose swiftly to a booming
roar. From a side road a long-hooded, black Lancia thundered up,
halted in a cloud of dust. Its door flung open and Thorndal popped
out.</p>

<p>"Sutton!" he bellowed. "Glad you're here!" His big hand engulfed
mine. "Waiting long?"</p>

<p>"Just arrived." I am no mean height, yet his massive, iron-gray
head loomed above me. There was physical power in the spread of his
shoulders, the hugeness of his frame; and his face, sculptured in
broad, powerful strokes, was eloquent of a mental strength that
explained in some part his swift conquest of an industry that was
the stamping-ground of financial giants. Just now his countenance
was lined with weariness, the hard glitter of his brown eyes was
somewhat dulled, but the dominant virility of the man still showed
through like the luminance of an inward blaze. Somehow, other men
faded in Andrew Thorndal's presence like a candle in the glare of a
thousand-watt airport lamp.</p>

<p>"Get your bag and get in!" The moment of greeting past, he was
brusque, commanding. "Snap into it."</p>

<p>His big car was filmed with the dust and mud of a long journey.
Thorndal slid under the wheel. I evinced no surprise at this; one
didn't expect this man to be driven by a chauffeur. The Lancia
leaped into motion.</p>

<p>"Pleasant trip?" asked Thorndal.</p>

<p>"Good enough." We were purring along Newville's Main Street; as
we passed there was a perceptible tightening in the bearing of the
few men on the narrow sidewalk, even of the shambling, vacant-faced
natives. I could see no women.</p>

<p>"Can't say the same. Roads were rotten from Akron. Had to
straighten something out there and the damn fools kept me longer
that I expected. But this car's good for a hundred or more when
she's pushed, so I was able to meet you as I planned."</p>

<p>"I rather imagined I was to put up in town," I said.</p>

<p>"No. You'll stay at the house."</p>

<p>Newville's trim houses dropped behind and the road was bordered
by trees that arched overhead and made our path a tunnel of
blackness.</p>

<p>"I want you where I can watch you," he added. "You might get
notions."</p>

<p>He smiled without humor, and once again I felt as if the coils
of a web were tightening around me. All these elaborate precautions
must be intended to conceal something more than a mere secret
process...</p>

<p>And then an uneasy question obtruded itself. Jimmy Haynes, my
classmate at Tech and my predecessor here, was of course acquainted
with all I was about to learn, all that Thorndal was going to such
elaborate lengths to prevent me from communicating to the outside
world. How had the manufacturer made certain of Haynes' silence? I
realized now that no one had heard from the little man since he had
gone, as I was going, to assume charge of the plant at Newville.
<i>Where was he now?</i></p>

<p>Something nicked the outer edge of the Lancia's beam, was
revealed as a man in the center of the road, waving in a signal to
stop. Thorndal grunted, but did not slow. The car hurtled at the
figure.</p>

<p><i>"Look out!"</i> I yelled. "You'll hit&mdash;" But at the last
instant of catastrophe the man leaped aside; we flicked by.
Something thudded against the tonneau side and glass crashed. "Good
God," I jerked out. "You almost killed him!"</p>

<p>My employer's mouth was a straight, cruel slash. "His fault," he
said. "No business getting in my way."</p>

<p>"But you can't&mdash;" I caught myself.</p>

<p>Thorndal's voice was a low growl. "Can't what?"</p>

<p>"You can't kill a man for getting in your path."</p>

<p>"I can't, eh? I wouldn't advise you to try it." His eyes were
smoldering. "You might as well learn right now, young man, that
getting in Andrew Thorndal's way is dangerous. Especially in
Newville."</p>

<p>I didn't answer that. What could I say? I didn't want to talk
anyway. Something beside the callous ruthlessness of my chief was
making the pit of my stomach squirm.</p>

<p>For the second time in an hour I had seen a man from whose face
the blackened flesh was sloughing in rotten decay, baring the
quivering, raw muscles beneath. And there had been no covering at
all on his waving hand, only gray sinews lacing skeleton
fingers!</p>

<p>A red light showed ahead; the Lancia skidded, stopped. I saw two
guards advancing, and behind them a high fence of copper wire in
parallel strands. It came out from the right, crossed the road and
disappeared to the left. But it was the square white sign hanging
from it, man-high, that caught my eye. The letters on it were a
staring red:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign"><b>danger<br>
this fence is<br>
electrically charged<br>
it is<br>
death<br>
to touch it</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>"Evening, Mr. Thorndal," one of the uniformed men was saying.
"I'll have the current off in a minute. Had any trouble on the way
up?"</p>

<p>The magnate's voice was sharp. "Why? Expect any?"</p>

<p>The fellow shuffled his feet uneasily. "No, sir. Only there's
been someone hangin' around in the woods off there, and a couple of
stones were thrown at Miss Thorndal's car when she came in last
night."</p>

<p>"What? What's that? Nan here?" There was no doubt about it,
consternation was vibrant in his tones. "How did she pass the outer
lines?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I dunno. Guess they didn't dare stop her."</p>

<p>"Look here," snapped Thorndal, "the orders are that no one gets
in without a pass. No one, do you understand, my daughter or the
devil himself. Tell Captain Daley that. No! Tell him to call me at
once. I'll flay the hide off him."</p>

<p>The man saluted, awkwardly. "Yes sir. I'll pass the word." The
tiny red light at the top of the fence blinked out. "Power's off,
sir." I thought there was resentment in the guard's eyes, but his
swarthy face was masklike. A panel opened in the fence, gate-like,
and gears clashed.</p>

<p>"The brat," Thorndal muttered to himself. "I told her to stay
away from here! Well, she'll go back in the morning or I'll know
the reason why."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; GOD OF VENGEANCE</h2>

<p class="first">GRAVEL crunched under our wheels. I was aware of a
house ahead, of windows warmly lighted. We rolled to a stop, a door
opened at the head of a short flight of stone steps, and a man came
out. Despite his livery he shambled down the stairs, his long arms
lax at his side, and there was something queerly robot-like in his
movements.</p>

<p>"Take Mr. Sutton's bag to the room Haynes had," Thorndal
snapped. Then he turned to me. "Come on in, Sutton, and I'll
introduce you to your new quarters." I thought the weariness in his
face had deepened in the last few minutes. Certainly there was a
hint of worry in his eyes.</p>

<p>There was a priceless Ispahan on the floor of the entrance hall,
something baronial in the lift of the curving staircase toward the
rear. I thought of the hovel back on the road, where a faceless man
lay dying. A door to one side opened and someone came out, peering
through thick spectacles.</p>

<p>"Hah, Mowrer!" Thorndal rumbled. "Got those papers ready?"</p>

<p>The secretary was a gray little man, bent and shriveled. "Yes,
Mr. Thorndal," he answered. "They are on your desk. Glad to see you
back safely. Were you...Did they..."</p>

<p>"No. I couldn't do anything with those imbeciles. They insist
there has been absolutely no change in the composition they're
using on the suits. By the way, this is Stanley Sutton, our new
superintendent. My secretary, Carl Mowrer."</p>

<p>Mowrer mumbled some sort of acknowledgment of the introduction,
turned back to his superior. "Johnson reports ten additional
laborers incapacitated, sir," he said. "And there's three died
today."</p>

<p>Thorndal's face hardened. "The devil! That means more slowing up
of production while they break in new hands."</p>

<p>"It is annoying, sir." Was I mistaken, or was there a faint hint
of irony in the little man's bland voice? "Hampden is waiting in
the study to see you. I told him you would be too tired for
business tonight, but he insisted. Said he had something you would
want to hear about immediately. Shall I tell him to come back in
the morning?"</p>

<p>"No. I'll talk to him now. Take care of Sutton for a minute."
The manufacturer wheeled eagerly to the door from which Mowrer had
come, slammed it shut behind him.</p>

<p>The secretary sighed, and turned to me. His jaw jerked sidewise.
"So you've come to take Jim Haynes' place, eh...You're not
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?" I echoed wonderingly. "Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of him and his devil's brew. Hasn't he told you how Neosite is
made?"</p>

<p>"No. He's told me nothing."</p>

<p>The fellow's gnarled fingers twined nervously with one another.
He moved closer to me and peered up into my face. "You're young,"
he muttered. "Too young. Go away. Go away before he tells you.
He'll let you go now. He won't after you know. You'll want to run
to the end of the world. But it will be too late then. Too late!"
Suddenly he was laughing, soundlessly but horrible. "Too late!"</p>

<p>I grabbed his thin arm, dug my fingers into it. "For the love of
Peter," I gritted. "What's this all about? What's going on
here?"</p>

<p>"Mowrer!" It was Thorndal's voice from the study door, but
brittle, menacing as I had never hear it. "Come here." He had an
opened letter in his hand and his face was livid with repressed
rage.</p>

<p>"Yes sir." The old man's eyes were fixed on the letter Thorndal
held. Suddenly his cheeks were the color of death. "What is it,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Did you write this?" He thrust it at Mowrer. "Did you?"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did I get it? What do you think I pay Hampden for? Did you
think he wouldn't know that you gave it to a truck-driver to mail
in Roton?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you have another think coming. So it was you, not Haynes,
that Tri-State Oil was dickering with!"</p>

<p>The man made a little helpless gesture.</p>

<p>"You were going to sell me out for a hundred thousand, and they
were willing. But they balked at sending a plane in to get you
out." Thorndal's voice rumbled lower and lower, till it was like
nothing so much as a volcano about to erupt. Mowrer was almost
groveling before him. "Speak up! I want you to admit it with your
own lips."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it was the only way I could escape from here. And I
had to <i>get</i> away&mdash;" his voice rose shrilly&mdash;"before
I went completely mad. I had to get away from this hell..."</p>

<p>Did Thorndal flinch, infinitesimally? You couldn't tell it from
the deep, deadly murmur of his tone, as he said: "You'll taste real
hell, Mowrer, now. They need men in the nitration room. Go to
Johnson and tell him I said you were to work there."</p>

<p>I felt let down. All this to-do, and then a mere demotion!
What...</p>

<p>Then Mowrer shrieked, "Not that! Oh God! Not that! Jail me! Kill
me! But don't send me there!" His lips were absolutely colorless,
his eyes stared horror. He dropped to the floor and squirmed to
Thorndal's feet. "Don't make me work in there!"</p>

<p>The tycoon shoved him away with a heavy shoe. "You should have
thought of that before you tried to double-cross me." His face was
granite, his eyes contemptuous. "You'll go into that room tonight,
and if you make any more fuss you'll go without a suit."</p>

<p><i>"Without a suit..</i>.<i>"</i> Suddenly, so quickly I did not
see how he managed it, Mowrer surged to his feet, was swarming, an
infuriated midget, over Thorndal's huge frame, his clawed hands
scoring scarlet furrows across the magnate's cheek. The big man
staggered under the unexpectedness of the onslaught, tore blindly
at the whirlpool of mad fury the other had become. I heard a
maniacal, snarling whimper, saw Mowrer's nails go for the big man's
eyes. I saw a knife flash in his other hand. And sprang.</p>

<p>I grabbed, caught the knife wrist, jerked it back till the
little man screamed in agony, got an arm around his neck and
clamped it tight. Mowrer's feet lashed out, struck Thorndal square
in the belly&mdash;and then I had ripped the maddened man away from
his astounded victim. I tripped, stumbled backward, crashed to the
floor with the mewling, screaming fellow atop me.</p>

<p>A whistle shrilled, and I was threshing about the floor,
scarcely able to hold the armful of explosive energy terror had
made of the meek, near-sighted clerk, fighting to keep the gleaming
knife out of my flesh, the clashing teeth from my skin. The tramp
of heavy feet was all about me. I saw green uniforms, felt Mowrer
ripped from my hold, and I lay gasping, exhausted.</p>

<p>Thorndal was dabbing a white handkerchief at his scratched face.
Little lights crawled in his dark eyes, but there was no expression
on his countenance save two white spots that came and went on
either side of his nostrils. The secretary was limp in the grasp of
two burly guards.</p>

<p>"Take him to the nitration room," Thorndal said grimly. "And
tell Johnson he is to work without a suit."</p>

<p>Mowrer lifted his head. He had lost his glasses in the struggle,
his pupils were tiny, the whites of his eyes bloodshot. But there
was no fear in those blurred orbs. Hate peered from them, hate and
an awful threat. Words dripped from his twisted mouth...</p>

<p>"There is a God, Thorndal, a God of Vengeance," he said. "He
knows what you do, and prepares His punishment. Even the least of
His creatures may be His instrument to that end. Even I." Then his
look dropped to me.</p>

<p>"And you, poor fool," he said. "You have made your choice. I
shall not forget you when the time comes. Pray, if you can, for you
are doubly doomed."</p>

<p>"Take him away," Thorndal gestured imperatively. Mowrer went
steadily toward the door, proudly erect between his captors. Torn,
bleeding, disheveled, he dwarfted us all in that moment. The
hatchet-faced manservant let them out.</p>

<p>I got to my feet, painfully. Thorndal stared at me, for a
moment, as if he were seeing me for the first time. Then he
spoke:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you saw that, Sutton. You'll know better than to try
to fool me now."</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded overhead.</p>

<p>"Dad. Daddy! What's happened?" I twisted to the flute-like voice
from the stair head. "What was all that noise?" The girl came
running down the stairs, filmy draperies streaming out behind her,
white face anxious. I saw full-curved, red lips, great lustrous
eyes, a coif of ebony hair. "Ohhh, you're bleeding!"</p>

<p>"Nan!" There was a throaty tenderness in his ejaculation. He
held his arms out to her and she nestled within them.</p>

<p>"But Dad&mdash;that's an awful scratch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that." He pushed her away from him but still held a
tight grip on both her arms, just above the elbow. It seemed to me
his glance drank her in thirstily. Then suddenly his face was
granite once more, his eyes hard. "Why did you come here, Nan? You
know I forbade you to."</p>

<p>It was the gruffness of his tone, rather than the words, I
thought, that brought the hurt look to her face. "I know. But I was
lonesome for you, and Bill Lannon was motoring up this way. So I
came along. He's upstairs. You'll like him."</p>

<p>The white spots of rage were visible again, at the outcurve of
his nostrils. "You brought someone here." He said it slowly,
icily.</p>

<p>She was petulant now, in the way girls have when trying to avoid
the consequences of a transgression. "But Daddy, he's swell," she
said. She half-turned, and called, "Billy...oh, Billy. Come down
and meet my father."</p>

<p>"Coming."</p>

<p>He was a typical playboy, the fellow who rattled down the
staircase, meticulously dressed, his little blond mustache waxed,
his hair slicked back. His round face was insipid, his blue eyes
insolent. He reached the lower floor, halted.</p>

<p>"This is Bill Lannon, Dad," said the girl. "Isn't he nice?"</p>

<p>Thorndal grunted. Lannon bowed. "I have been very anxious to
make your acquaintance, sir," he said. "Nan's father, I was sure,
must be exceptional."</p>

<p>That to the man who had swept like a meteor across industry's
sky! Could the chap possibly be so arrant an ass? He looked at the
girl fatuously, and I knew I disliked him heartily. But I didn't
realize, then, why I did.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Dryly. "I hope you find the sight worth a long trip
for a short stay. A very short stay...Nan is leaving here at once,
and you also."</p>

<p>The chap looked bewildered. But Nan flashed around to her father
with something of his own spirit. "Dad," she said. "You can't do
that! You can't chase us out the minute we've gotten here."</p>

<p>Thorndal's mouth was grim, but I fancied there was anxiety mixed
with the smouldering wrath in his eyes, as he answered. "I can't
have you stay here, Nan, not even one night. There's
something&mdash;I am too busy. And you know I don't allow visitors
in Newville."</p>

<p>"I know. I shouldn't have come. But you're not going to send me
right away. Without even a chance for one little chat with you,
Daddy..."</p>

<p>He weakened. "All right. You may stay overnight, with the
understanding that neither of you is to set foot outside this
house."</p>

<p>The girl's lips firmed, but she knew when not to press an
advantage. "All right, Dad. I won't go outside tonight and I won't
let Bill." I noticed she said nothing about the morning. "We'll
just sit around the fire in my sitting-room and talk. Come on
up."</p>

<p>"Not now," he said. "I must go over matters with Mr. Sutton, my
new superintendent." She looked at me for the first time, coolly.
My heart skipped a beat. "We have lots to do before I can
rest."</p>

<p>"I'm Nan Thorndal, Mr. Sutton," she said then. "I was wondering
how soon Dad would see fit to introduce us."</p>

<p>I muttered something, I'll be hanged if I know what. She rattled
on. "You must join us after you're through. Mr. Haynes and I were
great pals till dad exiled me to Florida a month ago."</p>

<p>"We were classmates at Tech," I told her. "But he kept away from
the rest of us. Sensitive about his appearance, I imagine."</p>

<p>"He did look rather like a queer old gnome, with his tremendous
head and shriveled-up little body. But how could he have been your
classmate? He must have been forty-five at least."</p>

<p>"No. He was no older than thirty."</p>

<p>"Come on, Sutton," Thorndal interrupted. "Let's get to work. You
two run along."</p>

<p>He watched them scurry up the stairs, and his mouth twisted. I
don't think he realized that he spoke aloud. "I'd give ten years of
my life if she weren't here."</p>

<p>From somewhere outside there was a shriek, muffled shouts, the
dull thud of a shot. Thorndal hurtled to the outer door, slammed it
open and lunged out into the night. I followed.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away, across a sloping lawn, a line of red
lights marked the fence, and I could see slumped forms in a dark
knot just beneath one of them. As I dashed after my employer's
running form an excited murmur came from the group, a shocked
oath.</p>

<p>There was something hanging from the wire, a quivering shape
outlined by a faint blue haze of electricity. My scalp tightened
and my throat was dry. The shredded face seemed to be grinning at
me through black lips, and the hand that was clamped to an upper
wire was nothing but muscles and bones. It was the man Thorndal had
tried to run down. Fire smoldered in the tattered jacket that
covered the twisted torso of the tortured corpse. I sickened, then
looked again. The man had an enormous head, and his body was
shriveled, tiny.</p>

<p>I moved further away from the lethal barrier as the ground
seemed to heave-under my feet. Could there be anyone else with
precisely the deformity that Jim Hayne's had? Anyone else with that
gnome-like shape?</p>

<p>My employer's voice was devoid of emotion. "What happened here,
Lansio?"</p>

<p>One of the men in green uniforms who stood on the other side of
the fence answered him: "I see him come out from the woods. He got
knife in hand. I holler. He no answer. Holler 'gain. He start
running. I shoot, get him in leg. He fall 'gainst wire. That
all."</p>

<p>The red lights were gone, suddenly, and the body slumped to the
ground, horribly. Someone pulled it away and the lights came on
again. Thorndal turned on his heel. "We'll never get through at
this rate," he grumbled. It seemed to me he was watching my face,
speculatively.</p>

<p>What was it the woman had shrieked after me, back on the road to
Newville? "I hope yer mother has to look at yer a month from
terday."</p>

<p>I tried to say something, but the words stuck in my throat. I
wanted to tell him I was going away from there. He could have his
job. But that would mean I should never see Nan Thorndal again.</p>

<p>I followed Andrew Thorndal into the house, into his study, sat
down in the chair he indicated and watched while he got paper from
a drawer, adjusted an automatic pencil. And all the time I was
thinking of Mowrer's warning: <i>"After he tells you it will be too
late."</i></p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "I AM THE LAW!"</h2>

<p class="first">I LISTENED to Thorndal's voice, flowing on and on,
and watched his busy pencil jot down chemical equation after
equation. There seemed nothing particularly intricate about the
synthesis of Neosite so far, nothing that any ordinarily skilled
chemist might not deduce from an analysis of the product itself.
What was the dread secret?</p>

<p>"From here," he rumbled, "the liquid is piped to the nitration
room. This is where my new technique comes in. As the nitric acid
is poured in I also add one-tenth of a per cent of&mdash;" He named
a certain organic compound. "The resultant reaction is this, rather
unexpectedly." Letters and symbols formed a new line on the
scribbled sheet.</p>

<p>I emitted a low whistle and pointed to a cabalistic inscription.
"I've never run across this gas." It was a by-product. "But from
its formula I should judge it to be extremely caustic."</p>

<p>"It is. The fumes that fill the nitration room dissolve flesh
like water does salt."</p>

<p>"You take no chances, of course. The nitration is performed in
an auto clave."</p>

<p>He looked at me rather queerly, I thought. "No," he
answered.</p>

<p>My skin crawled. "Then how do you guard your laborers?"</p>

<p>"By suits and masks made from a special rubber compound I have
devised. They are fairly efficient."</p>

<p>"Fairly!" I was trying to match the unemotional steadiness of
his tone. "Not perfectly!"</p>

<p>"No. We have had occasional failures. In the past two weeks they
have grown in number, inexplicably. That's why I went to Akron. I
thought the trouble lay in the manufacture of the suits. But it
isn't there." There was just the slightest trace of cloudiness in
his eyes. "We've lost twenty men from the nitration room in the
past fortnight. Breaking in new ones is hampering production."</p>

<p>"Twenty men!" I couldn't keep the horror out of my voice any
longer. "Good God&mdash;they must die horribly!"</p>

<p>"They do." He said it with an utter lack of expression, but his
eyes were smouldering coals. "I'm afraid that stupid as are the
people around here they will soon refuse to work for us, even with
increased pay."</p>

<p>I pushed against the tabletop with my hands, pushed myself to my
feet. "Look here, Mr. Thorndal," I gritted through cold lips, "I
may need the money and the job you've offered me. But I can't be
mixed up in this. I'm resigning."</p>

<p>His mouth twisted. "Not any more, young fellow. You know too
much. You're going to stay here and work for me&mdash;as
superintendent or in the nitration room alongside Mowrer."</p>

<p>There was sodden, brooding silence in the somber room. His head
lifted slightly, so that his agate eyes held mine, and his mouth
was a hard, straight line. I thought of the armed guards outside,
the death-dealing wires.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "I'll continue as superintendent." After a
while his vigilance might relax, I might see a chance to get away.
"But I shall try to find a way to protect the workers."</p>

<p>The corners of his lips lifted in a satiric smile. "Try. But
make damn sure you don't make it cost more than the expense of the
labor turnover if you want me to adopt it. I won't raise the price
of Neosite, and I won't cut my profit."</p>

<p>I shrugged. "After all, there isn't a bridge or a skyscraper
built without a couple of deaths. There are fatal accidents in
every factory." I must make him believe I had capitulated without
reservations. "It is the price of progress."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking," Thorndal exclaimed, and there was
satisfaction in his tone. "Sit down and we'll go on with our
work."</p>

<p>I was searching for a weak point in the defenses, a loophole
through which I might escape. And I found it!</p>

<p>The basic material of Neosite was crude oil, brought into the
plant by pipeline from Pennsylvania fields. The huge underground
tube was indicated clearly on the maps. But there was another
similar but fainter tracing, angling off to the south.</p>

<p>"Another pipeline," he explained. "For emergencies. It connects
up with the Texas tube. It's empty, never been used."</p>

<p>I talked about something else, disinterestedly. But my pulses
throbbed. There was the road to freedom! I noted carefully that its
entrance was just below a window of the nitration room.</p>

<p>At last we were finished. Thorndal looked at his watch. "Three
a.m., by George!" he said. "I'll show you your room." Upstairs, he
added: "If you get any ideas during the night, remember Mowrer." He
opened a door at the other end of the hall and disappeared.</p>

<p>Enough illumination came in from outside for me to undress, and
I didn't switch on the light in the room. My pajamas were folded
across the pillow; I got into them mechanically and stretched out.
I was dog-tired, physically and mentally, but I could not
sleep.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, and Nan Thorndal drifted across my imagining,
her white grace in poignant contrast to all the horrors I had seen,
gayety and fervor for living dancing in her eyes.</p>

<p>The loathsome triangle of a snake's head rose behind her, peered
over her shoulder. I saw its forked tongue darting, saw that it was
poised to strike. It hissed warningly. Its eyes were like
Thorndal's, glittering hard...The hissing grew louder&mdash;I
tried to yell a warning to the girl&mdash;and woke trembling.</p>

<p>But the hissing continued, low, insistent. It was somewhere in
the room. There was a faint odor too, rank, pungent, like the
unfamiliar stench in the hut where 'Lije lay dying. It had grown
darker; the ceiling was only a faint, pale glimmer. I forced my
head around, against the paralysis of inexplicable fear that held
me&mdash;forced it around to the seeming source of the sibilant
noise. And saw a green-glowing mist billowing along the floor!</p>

<p>It came from the gloom of the further corner, a thin veil of
iridescence rolling ominously; its advancing edge sharply defined.
It was coming swiftly toward my bed. Before I could gather my
sleep-bemused faculties and guess its meaning, the ominous tide was
lapping at the legs of my couch, was reaching tenuous, hungry
filaments up toward me.</p>

<p>A sound at my door&mdash;someone breathing heavily&mdash;snapped
the spell that gripped me. I gathered myself&mdash;launched myself
in a flying leap that sent me almost to the exit. In the instant it
took for me to grasp the doorknob and get the portal open, my bare
feet were immersed ankle-deep in the green vapor. Then I was
through, had crashed the door behind me and leaned, gasping,
against the wall. Agony seared my feet where they had dipped into
the gas, the excruciating torture of a burn from boiling acid.</p>

<p>Something scattered to my right. I twisted, saw someone flick
down the curving stairs. I had only a glimpse of him in the wan
light of the single burning lamp. I shouted something
unintelligible, started after him&mdash;and whirled to the boom of
Thorndal's voice. "Sutton!"</p>

<p>He was gigantic in the dimness, and he was much too near to have
come all the way from his room since I had slammed the door! Red
rage exploded in my skull.</p>

<p>"You devil," I squeezed out through a tightened throat. "What
are you trying to do&mdash;kill me in my sleep?" I took a step
toward him, my hands fisting, and stopped as pain shot up my legs
from my scorched feet. The pain was growing worse.</p>

<p>His face was a frozen mask, but there was a red glow in his
eyes. "What do you mean?" he rumbled, speaking low. "What's going
on here?"</p>

<p>Doors were opening along the hall. "You know damn well what I
mean," I snapped. "The gas in my room&mdash;if I hadn't wakened in
time I'd be dead!"</p>

<p>Behind him Nan came out into the hall, a pastel-shaded negligee
tightly clasped around her exquisite form. She was sleepy-eyed,
pale.</p>

<p>"Gas in your room." There was no surprise in his calm voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. The green hell-gas. Look!" I lifted one foot. Already the
skin was black. It was like a skin-tight shoe.</p>

<p>"Get in there and wash it off!" He jerked a thumb at a bathroom
door, just across from my bedchamber. "Use plenty of soap. If
you've had only a touch that will stop it. Hurry!" The impact of
his authoritative command, my terror that in moments the flesh
would peel from my extremities, drove anger from me. I dove into
the room he indicated, snapped on the light and twisted bathtub
spigots in frantic haste. But I left the door open, listened and
watched as I flinched from the sting of the soap I had snatched
up.</p>

<p>"Dad." Nan asked. "What...?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. Just an accident. Sutton was fooling with
something Haynes left in there and burned himself. Go back."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I'm frightened, Dad. I want to stay with
you."</p>

<p>"Please go to your room." His voice was commanding, but his eyes
devoured her. The outer skin was peeling from my feet and ankles as
I rubbed the lather in, and the soap burned like fire. "You will be
in the way here," he said. "I'll come to you later. Go,
please."</p>

<p>She sighed, vanished. Lannon came into sight, in orchid pajamas.
Not a hair was out of place on his head or fix that tiny, pointed
mustache of his. But his insipid face was colorless, and he
clutched a pearl-handled pistol in one white hand. "Is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>The big man ignored him. He was looking at the floor, at the
threshold of the room I had quitted in such haste. I swung my legs
out of the tub, reached for a jar of cold-cream. The burning was
gone from my feet and ankles, but they were raw, tender. The salve
relieved the pain somewhat, and I stood up gingerly, peered to see
what it was Thorndal watched.</p>

<p>Along the lower edge of the door green smoke was seeping
out.</p>

<p>Thorndal's head lifted. "That's got to be shut off or it will
fill the home. Here you&mdash;" He turned to address someone beyond
my vision, "Go in and see what you can do."</p>

<p>I hobbled out of the bathroom and looked to see whom he was
ordering into that death-filled room, that chamber of horror. It
was the robot-like servant, uniform trousers hastily pulled on over
a drab, grimy union-suit in which he evidently slept. The man
shambled forward as I came out, his vacuous eyes fixed on his
master's. Was it ignorance or mechanical obedience that was sending
him un-protesting to terrible death?</p>

<p>"My God!" I ripped out. "You can't let him go in there. The room
must be filled with the stuff by now. Why, it's murder!"</p>

<p>Lannon's jaw was dropped, his mouth gaped stupidly. Thorndal
looked at me and his gaze was basilisk. "Keep out of this, Sutton,"
he said icily.</p>

<p>The man's hand was on the door-knob, but my cry seemed to have
penetrated his dull intellect. He said, fumblingly: "Is it the
Peelin' gas, boss? I don't know as I want ter go in." There was
something pathetic in his irresolution. Evidently defiance of
Thorndal's orders was quite beyond his conception.</p>

<p>"Go in and turn it off," the latter snarled, and jerked the door
open. The ominous hissing flashed out, and the room was fogged with
the green haze of death. "See it?" Thorndal shouted. "A drum in the
corner." His big hand struck Jever's back, thrust him in. The door
slammed behind the man, and a muffled scream sounded from
within&mdash;a scream of anguish. I thought I heard stumbling
footsteps going across the floor. Then there was the thud of a
falling body.</p>

<p>Thorndal's ear was against the panel. "The hissing's stopped,"
he said. "He shut it off before he dropped."</p>

<p>"Good Lord," I yammered. "It's murder. Murder!"</p>

<p>The other's eyes were bleak. "Not murder, Sutton. Justice.
Someone had to cut the gas off or we'd all be killed. Jevers could
be spared the best. And besides he had it coming to him. He helped
Mowrer get his double-crossing messages out."</p>

<p>My pulses hammered. "You have no right to take the law into your
hands!" If it meant that I would meet the same fate I had to say
it. "You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> the law in Newville. Get that fixed in your mind,
young man. <i>I am the law."</i></p>

<p>With an effort I shrugged and turned away. If I ever got out of
here alive I would show him there was another law, stronger than
his.</p>

<p>Thorndal's voice broke in upon my thoughts. "Where's that
nincompoop Lannon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He was here a minute ago," I answered heavily. "Right
here."</p>

<p>"I want to tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>A room door had opened; the playboy bustled out. He had gotten
into clothes, and he had a heavy bag in his fist. His cheeks were
the color of putty.</p>

<p>"Hey, you! Where do you think you're going?" growled
Thorndal.</p>

<p>"Away. I'm going away from here."</p>

<p>Thorndal moved toward him ominously. "Oh, no, you're not," he
said grimly. "You're staying right here. You've seen too much."</p>

<p>Hysteria leaped into Lannon's voice; I swear there were tears in
his eyes. "Don't touch me," he quavered. "Keep your hands off
me!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole. But if you're
looking for trouble just put a foot outside this house. You'll get
it."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" The bag dropped from his nerveless fingers. "I
should never have come here."</p>

<p>"That's the first sensible thing you've said," Thorndal
commented dryly. "Now, get back in your room and stay there."</p>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE LIVING DEAD</h2>

<p class="first">THROBBING pain rendered sleep impossible, and I
sat in the new room I had been given, my feet on a pillow and my
chin cupped in a hand whose elbow rested on the windowsill. The sky
had cleared, and below my vantage point the lawn sloped, moonlit,
to the circling line of red pin-points marking the
electrically-charged fence that had already taken a life that
night.</p>

<p>Somewhere a clock struck four. Two hours to daylight yet. Three
hours till I should have to go into that factory where horror
stalked&mdash;till I should have to face Andrew Thorndal again.</p>

<p>For I knew now that it was a battle to the death between us. I
must smash him, smash his fiendish mill&mdash;or die. As long as
his power remained I was a prisoner, a slave, sending other
helpless slaves to incredible tortures.</p>

<p>What kind of man was he? Incredibly hard, ruthless, murderous.
And yet he was sane. In all his long exposition of the intricate
manufacture of Neosite, in the hours that I had studied him, there
had been no hint of anything to the contrary. He was no madman, but
merely one utterly without human feeling, driving straight to his
objective of the production of his motor fuel cheaply and in
quantity, without regard to what sacrifice that objective
entailed.</p>

<p>And when he discovered a spy, a traitor, he sent him to death as
spies and traitors are sent to death in war&mdash;utterly without
compunction.</p>

<p>My brow knitted. All this seemed logical&mdash;devilishly
logical. But why had he tried to kill me with gas hidden in my
room? That was not like him. If he trusted me, there was no reason
for such an attempt. If he did not, he would not hesitate to shoot
me down like a dog&mdash;or send me to the nitration room. I was
utterly in his power. There was no need for deception, for the
planting of an opened drum where it would take me in my sleep.</p>

<p>He had not bothered to deny my accusation. But somehow I could
not believe him guilty of that abomination. <i>Someone else had
tried to kill me!</i> Who, and why? <i>Would he try again?</i></p>

<p>My scalp tightened. The struggle against Thorndal that had been
forced on me was alone a titanic task. What could I do against
another enemy, unknown, striking at me invisibly from the
night?</p>

<p>At this unpleasant point in the whirligig of my tired mind I
became conscious of a furtive murmur, voices too low to be
intelligible. This was curious!</p>

<p>I looked along the house-side, and saw that someone was squatted
on the slanting verandah roof, two windows away.</p>

<p>Could it be that the secret enemy was lurking in that chamber,
unknown even to Thorndal? It would have been easy enough to steal
along the slanting boards and slip a tank of gas into the room
where I had been sleeping. Holy Moses! Maybe it had not been
intended for me at all; perhaps it had been meant for Thorndal
himself. No&mdash;he slept at the end of the hall; no possibility
of a mistake. For Nan, then! My blood curdled. Perhaps the plotters
were planning even now to rectify their error!</p>

<p>The man on the roof moved, just then, and slid over its edge. He
was a shadow flitting across the lawn. A patch of moonlight caught
him, momentarily, and I saw that he was tall, painfully thin, his
hatless head a high, hairless dome. He went into shadow again, and
vanished.</p>

<p>And then I saw something that drove the puzzle from my mind. The
long arc of red lights blinked out! Dim forms appeared suddenly
from the black cluster of the bordering woods, all along the fence,
and suddenly there were silent, shadowy struggles everywhere. Not
one of the surprised guards had time to shout or shoot. Even at
this distance I sensed the venomous quality of those struggles.</p>

<p>Almost before I realized they had begun they were over, and a
swarm of dark, distorted forms were climbing the wire barrier that
was no longer impregnable. They were running across the lawn, queer
distorted shapes, more fearful for the silence of their coming. The
foremost reached the swath of moonlight and I saw that he was
Mowrer, had Mowrer's slight figure at least, though the face I
glimpsed was as black as coal, black as my feet had been after an
instant's contact with the green gas.</p>

<p>Thorndal's victims had risen at last, were coming to take their
vengeance. Let them come! Swift elation rose in me, then vanished.
Nan! What would they do to her if they won into the house? Nan!</p>

<p>I plunged for the door, slammed it open, and yelled, "Thorndal!
Thorndal! They're coming!"</p>

<p>He must have slept lightly or not at all, for he was out of his
room almost before I could turn towards it. "What is it?" he
snapped. "Who's coming?"</p>

<p>"Mowrer and a gang from the plant! They've killed the guards
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had popped back through his door, was out again instantly
with guns in his hands. Nan appeared, and Lannon, his blue eyes
popping from his head. There was a crash from below and through the
upper windows came a shrill tumult of cries, the arid yells of a
bloodthirsty mob.</p>

<p>"Here, Sutton, take this," Thorndal shouted, and tossed a gun to
me. "Watch the stair head."</p>

<p>He twisted to Lannon, handed a revolver to him. "Get back in
your room and guard the porch roof."</p>

<p>"Give me one, Dad. You know how well I can shoot." Nan was pale
but calm. There was something of her father in the set of her
little jaw. He looked at her, and obeyed.</p>

<p>"God bless you, girl! You watch the porch, too; I don't trust
that milksop."</p>

<p>She smiled bravely, jerked open the door of her bedroom and
disappeared within. The bedlam from below was terrific now;
something was thudding against the entrance door in great crashes
that shook the building, and there was the smash of breaking
glass.</p>

<p>Behind me there was the sound of moving furniture. "Here, help
me with this," came Thorndal's voice. He was hauling a huge
chifforobe out of a room close by. I sprang to his aid and got it
across the stair head. It filled the space, would shield us well
enough, while at either flank there was just sufficient space for
us to see past and shoot I crouched at one side, Thorndal at the
other. And the entrance portal crashed in!</p>

<p>They poured through and filled the lower hall, a howling,
shrieking mob. It was dark down there and I could see them only
dimly, but the foul stench of their putrescence swept up to me, and
the pungent aroma of the green gas. A black shadow leaped for the
stairs and my gun spat. He fell&mdash;crashed down, and sprawled in
the dimness.</p>

<p>"Too dark," I grunted. "Too dark down there," Gun-flash answered
my shot and bullets thudded into our barricade. "I can't see to
shoot."</p>

<p>"There's a switch here," my companion growled. "Wait."</p>

<p>A click, and light flooded the milling crowd. It was greeted by
a volley of shots and shrill, weird yelpings that made a madhouse
chorus. Thorndal's weapon thudded, but for a horrified instant I
could not fire.</p>

<p>Down there, in that luxuriously furnished lobby, some grotesque
nightmare had spilled its creatures in an affrighting, obscene
throng. Not one of them was human-looking. Not one. They ranged
from some who were merely blackened by the first touch of the gas,
through gibbering, mad-eyed beings whose cheekbones protruded and
whose lips were frayed, to the incarnate horror of the dead-alive
from whom all flesh had vanished. Cheekless, noseless, earless
corpses, they still jerked about in a simulation of life, with a
shimmering play of exposed muscles and flickering nerves whose
agony was horribly visible.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the thought of Nan, in that moment, I
should have thrust the barricade aside and thrown down to them the
man who had made them what they were, thrown him down to them and
plunged after. But she was there, somewhere behind, and I could not
abandon her to their vengeance. I dared not think what her fate
would be.</p>

<p>The chifforobe was jerking under the impact of their shots. They
surged on.</p>

<p>My finger squeezed trigger and I felt the gun jump in my hand.
Flayed figures fell, twitching, on the steps. Thorndal's weapon
thundered beside me, took its deadly toll. But still they came on;
mouthing, grimacing figures from Hell! They came slowly because
they had to clamber over the contorted bodies of the fallen.
Slowly, because my lead and Thorndal's was hurtling into them,
driving them back. I saw one gaunt skeleton topple, his open mouth
gurgling a scream, his tongue only a blackened stump in the dark
cavity of his throat.</p>

<p>Where was Mowrer? He had led the charge across the lawn, but I
could see him nowhere now. The question flicked across my
horror-numbed brain, and then the hammer of my gun clicked on an
empty shell. A raw, featureless face stared through my firing slit,
its eyes twin pits of damnation. The chest rocked under the impact
of the attackers, toppled. I sprang backward...</p>

<p>And from somewhere behind a shriek ripped high above the
triumphant clamor of the mob. A woman's shriek. <i>Nan!</i></p>

<p>I whirled, and hurtled down the long corridor, Thorndal's
berserk roar ringing in my ears. I was conscious of Lannon's white
face, his open mouth shouting something I did not hear, and then I
was hurling myself into the room where I had seen the girl go.</p>

<p>The window framed struggling figures. I glimpsed Nan's flailing
arms, the ex-secretary's face, black save where mad eyes rolled
whitely under lashless lids. I leaped to them. Someone loomed at my
side. I dodged&mdash;felt the breeze of a club that just missed my
head&mdash;flung a fist at the dim-seen form. It thudded
sickeningly against moist flesh. I heard weakened bone crunch, and
twisted again to the window. It was open, empty. I lunged to it,
thrust head and shoulders out.</p>

<p>"Help," Nan screamed from the roof-edge. "Dad! Bill! Help!" She
was still fighting at the roof-edge, against Mowrer and another
dark, tall form. I shouted something unintelligible, lifted a leg
to the sill. A shot barked&mdash;to my right. Something crashed
against my skull&mdash;crashed me into oblivion.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; FREE?</h2>

<p class="first">I THINK the first thing of which I was conscious
was the pain in my feet. It seemed as if they had been rasped with
sharp files and salt rubbed into the wounds. Then the racking pain
at the back of my skull obtruded itself, and the weight that lay
across my chest. I opened my eyes. My sensations were still purely
physical&mdash;I recall that. Thought was not yet functioning at
all. There was a roar in my ears and a lurid red light was all
around me. I felt warm, although I was clothed only in pajamas, and
I hurt all over.</p>

<p>Something was digging into my back and I tried to turn over. I
could not move! The blow that had knocked me out had paralyzed me.
I realized that I was still on the porch roof, that something lay
across me, pinning me down, that I could not stir. And that the
roaring I heard, the dancing red light, and the unnatural warmth
could mean only one thing. Fire! The house was on fire and I could
not move!</p>

<p>Flames licked along the upper window-sash, just within my
vision, tiny jets of yellow, and red, and lucent green. Acrid sting
of smoke was in my nostrils, and heat beat at me. Glass crashed
somewhere and the voice of the blaze was deafening. I smelled hair
burning. My own? I turned my head toward the window and saw a red
face on the sill, black flesh peeling away from it, its scant hair
frizzling in the heat. Soon my hair would frizzle like that, and
the fire lick across my body. What a way to die!</p>

<p><i>I had turned my head!</i> Did that mean the paralysis was
gone? I heaved up, throwing off the body that lay over me.
Something clattered on the roof, a cudgel. There was a bullet wound
in the back of the corpse's neck and blood still seeped from it. I
was on my feet, the hot tin roofing doubling my agony. A flame
licked out from the window, almost caught me. I leaped from the
porch-roof, doubling my feet under me, ducking my head between my
shoulders, taking the fall on my back and rolling as I had been
taught in gym-class at Tech. But the impact knocked the breath from
me.</p>

<p>I struggled erect. Every move I made was painful, the grassy
stubble was a torment, my head was a gigantic, whirling globe on my
shoulders. I limped toward the fence where the danger lights no
longer glowed, trying to gather my incoherent thoughts. Someone had
shot the fellow who had stunned me just as the cudgel fell. I had
been left for dead, I was free to escape from this infernal place,
from this Hell on Earth. <i>I was free to escape!</i></p>

<p>I reached the fence, crawled between copper strands. A mound in
the road attracted my attention and I bent to it. Shredded bits of
green cloth told me what lay there had been a uniformed guard two
hours ago, filled with life. I looked away quickly to save my
sanity.</p>

<p>I stood there, swaying. I was free to escape, I told myself; but
something inside me denied it. I couldn't go away from here. There
was something I must do. What was it? I put out a hand to the wire
to steady myself&mdash;and remembered.</p>

<p>Nan! Nan Thorndal! Mowrer had her, he whose eyes had glared with
such hate at her father, at me. He who had led the ravening throng
of the green gas's victims to their long overdue uprising, he who
had proclaimed himself God's instrument for vengeance! Would his
crazed mind extend that vengeance to her? Had he not left the
direct attack to the others while he stole behind our defenses and
snatched her from her room?</p>

<p>I groaned, and shuddered with cold, despite the heat-blast that
rolled across the lawn from the blazing house. What was he doing to
her, what unimaginable torture was he inflicting on that lissome,
slender, dreamy-eyed girl? What had he done to her, where had he
taken her? I looked around wildly, and saw the looming bulk of the
plant, saw that most of the windows were darkened, but that four
were alight, near the ground. And against their staring oblongs,
dark figures moved.</p>

<p>I cudgeled my brain for the plans Thorndal had shown me. And
cursed as I got a glimmer of what Mowrer's scheme must be. That was
the nitration room, the place where the gas was born that stripped
men's flesh from them and killed them too slowly. Good Lord! Had he
taken her there?</p>

<p>I dove across the road, was swallowed up in the shadow, and
started toward those yellow windows, calming myself to coherent
thought as I forced my way through underbrush that tore at my
scantily covered body and slashed my already lacerated feet. I must
have traced a trail of blood through those woods, but I did not
feel it then. I was racked by a greater torture, hag-ridden by the
vision of Nan Thorndal in Mowrer's power, in the power of his
fiendish horde. Nan Thorndal&mdash;whom I knew at last that I
loved, had loved from the moment I had seen her.</p>

<p>What could I hope to accomplish, weaponless, almost naked,
weakened by all that I had passed through? I did not know, knew
only that I must get to her, get to Nan, help her or share her
fate.</p>

<p>Dread hammered at me for speed, but I could not go fast. I was
too weak, the brush too thick. So I moved slowly, and had time to
think.</p>

<p>Mowrer might be insane, but his attack had been well worked out.
The stealthy gathering of his forces in the woods, their sudden
silent onslaught the instant the power was off in the wires...</p>

<p>Hold on! How had that come about? The master switch was on the
lower floor of the blazing building. That I knew from the
blueprints. <i>Someone in the house had cut the current!</i> Jevers
was the only servant who slept in&mdash;Thorndal had told me
that&mdash;and Jevers, I realized grimly, could not have been the
one. There was left, as far as I knew, myself, Thorndal and Nan,
and Lannon.</p>

<p>Was there someone else, someone unknown even to the
manufacturer? The same one, perhaps, who had planted the gas in my
room? The one who had engaged in that midnight conversation with
the prowler of the high-domed, bald head? Where had the latter
gone, anyway&mdash;of which party was he? What had that furtive
talk been about, and with whom?</p>

<p>A vast roaring twisted me toward the burning home, a tremendous
crash. The roof had fallen in, the walls were toppling, crashed
even as I looked, and the triumphant flames soared heavenward in a
furious outburst, a geysering of lurid, blazing gases, of great
beams exploding upward, of cascading sparks and fluttering,
whirling embers. Through the split open building-side, I saw the
curving staircase shatter and drop into the roaring lake of avid
light, saw a body wrapped in flame swirl in that inferno, a human
torch. I shuddered to think that if my coma had lasted a bare ten
minutes longer my corpse too, or my still-living body, would have
been enveloped in a fiery shroud.</p>

<p>There was an open space between the edge of the woods and the
long low building that was my goal, a space shielded from the
fading glow of the ashes so that sightless dark lay there.</p>

<p>A grotesque, twisted shadow flitted across one luminous
aperture; thin shoulders, and a profile that showed no irregularity
marking nose or chin. I crouched, shivering a little in the
before-dawn chill.</p>

<p>One advantage alone I had&mdash;Mowrer's ignorance of my
continued existence, his belief that I was dead.</p>

<p>An oath, deep-voiced, came faintly to me from within, and the
intonations of a protesting feminine voice. The pall of dread
lifted from me ever so slightly as I realized that Nan was still
alive. But the sounds stirred me into action. I started across the
clearing, moving gingerly to spare my feet and avoid untoward
noise. The footing here was soft earth, a blessed relief after the
torture of grassy stubble and twig-covered forest ground. My
burning soles felt cool iron, and I bent to it.</p>

<p>Groping blindly, I felt that a metal disk was embedded in the
ground, some three feet in diameter. By sheer luck I had blundered
across the manhole cover to the unused pipeline, the steel-lined
tunnel I had forgotten&mdash;but that now, I realized, must make an
essential part of my plan.</p>

<p>Weakened as I was, blinded by darkness and hampered by the
necessity for avoiding noise, it was a gigantic task to move the
iron plate. But at last I managed it. Then I turned once more to
the nitration room windows, just beyond.</p>

<p>They were frosted, as I have mentioned, blocking vision. But I
could hear sounds, the padding of many feet, someone speaking in a
high shrill voice, the noise of pouring liquid. A hairline of
brighter light along the sill showed that the window was not quite
tightly shut. I bent to see if I could peer through.</p>

<p>And someone leaped on me from behind! An arm slid around my
neck, clamped tight. A knee dug into the small of my back. "Got
you!" the garrotter grunted, and I could not breathe. I twisted
desperately, flailing fists backward at empty air. But his grip was
iron, the dig of his knee into my kidneys excruciating. "Mowrer!"
he shouted. "Mowrer!"</p>

<p>My eyes were popping from their sockets, my lungs bursting.
Dimly I knew that dark figures were crowding about me; the
secretary's blackened face danced dizzily before me in the
window-glow. The choking arm relaxed, but hands gripped my arms, my
legs. I was lifted from the ground.</p>

<p>"Two birds at one throw," I heard Mowrer's gloating voice. "Grab
Johnson, too, and bring him in."</p>

<p>"But I'm on your side." It was my captor's voice, thin-edged
with hysteria, "I'm on your side, Mowrer. I caught the fellow for
you."</p>

<p>Johnson! Where had I heard that name? Oh, yes. The one in charge
of the nitration room, of Thorndal's hellhole!</p>

<p>"On my side!" said Mowrer. "Only because you can't help
yourself...You can't get past my watchers where the road
bottle-necks into the swamp and you think you can escape punishment
this way. Nothing doing, friend Johnson. You have a long roll of
misdeeds for which to answer."</p>

<p>There was no way out then&mdash;except through the pipeline!
Good thing I had opened that manhole! Much good it would do me now.
I was done for.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help myself," Johnson protested. "I only obeyed
orders."</p>

<p>"You'll obey my orders now. Mine, and His whose instrument I
am." There was the exaltation of the religious fanatic in Mowrer's
voice, and the cold cruelty of the triumphant oppressed! No hope
for mercy there, or justice. "Take him, men."</p>

<p>I couldn't see what was happening in the dark, but there was the
sound of a scuffle, and the wordless wail of one in mortal fear. A
nightmare sound! "Gag him!" Mowrer ordered implacably. Then those
holding me started to move, and I saw the dark wall of the building
drifting by.</p>

<p>Up steps, through a huge door, a vast space, shadowy, eerie with
towering tanks and weird machines, half-seen. I closed my eyes to
shut out the sight of my bearers, to shut out the unholy vision of
those horrible faces; more horrible now for the flare of triumph,
the little crawling lights of sadistic anticipation in their
lidless eyes. A door opened. They lifted me over a threshold, and I
heard the door shut again. Heard Nan scream, "Mr. Sutton. Oh God!
They've caught you, too!" I forced myself to look, then.</p>

<p>I was in a long room, ablaze with the uncanny blue of
spluttering mercury lamps. A line of iron pillars marched down the
center of the loft, and there were three forms bound to the
columns: Nan, her fear-distorted face staring white in the
luxuriant frame of her Stygian hair; Lannon, his mustache still
ludicrously pointed and immaculate against the fish-belly gray of
his cheeks; and Thorndal! Lashed immovably to an iron post,
helpless, his clothing was half-ripped from his great frame, there
were angry red weals on his hairy torso, and blood dripped from a
cut over one ear. But he was poised, defiant, his massive head was
proudly erect and his rough-sculptured features were overlaid by a
brooding thunder-cloud of wrath. Lightning flickered in his eyes as
he saw me.</p>

<p>"Tie them up!" Mowrer's command crackled in the sudden silence
that followed Nan's outburst.</p>

<p>Skinless, dreadful hands fumbled ropes around me, pulled them
ungently tight, and I sagged, unable any longer to stand, supported
against the metal stake by those ropes alone. A knot of
gargoylesque figures about the next column to mine disintegrated,
and I had my first view of the man who had taken me and had in his
turn been nabbed. Johnson, foreman of the nitration room, was the
tall, high-domed individual who had crouched on the porch roof and
whispered secretively to someone within the house!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; JURY OF THE
DAMNED!</h2>

<p class="first">THERE were perhaps a score of them in the long
room, chattering among themselves like so many apes.</p>

<p>Now and then one would laugh, a cackling, lascivious laugh that
sent new tremors of detestation through me. Mowrer was bent over a
huge rectangular vat that spread along the farther wall of the
loft, watching a great pipe gurgitate into it a flood of viscous
black liquid. He was talking to someone whom I could not make out.
Above him there hung from the beamed ceiling a smaller glass tank,
and it was filled with an iridescent fluid that I knew to be
Thorndal's secret reagent. From it a pipe dipped down and ended
just over the larger tank, and the corrugated wheel of a valve was
within easy hand reach.</p>

<p>My eyes clung to that wheel and my blood curdled, for I knew
that when it was turned the contents of the tank above would pour
into the black fluid&mdash;and the green gas of death would boil
up to dissolve the flesh, the muscles and very bones, of any who
might be in that room and unprotected! In an hour anyone immersed
would be tracelessly dissolved!</p>

<p>My eyes sought Nan's, a wordless message passed between us. My
pulse leaped, the blood hammered in my veins, and emotion surged
within me&mdash;wonder that the miracle I read in her veiled glance
could have occurred. Then a grinning, lipless skull passed between
us and our peril was recalled to me full force. My brain raced. Was
there any way in which I could kill her, swiftly, before the gas
seared that young beauty?</p>

<p>"Enough," Mowrer spoke crisply. Someone grimaced with bared
facial muscles and pulled a lever over. The stream of oil cut off
with a sucking sound. I could just see the surface of the black
pool, two feet below the level of the floor. It heaved like some
foul prehistoric monster, and noisome colors rippled over it.
Mowrer turned slowly, and the man with him. My throat contorted in
a soundless shriek.</p>

<p>His body was shriveled, tiny; the skull, all that remained of
his head, gigantic. God Almighty! I had seen him dead, hours
before, clamped rigid to wires vibrant with lethal lightning, seen
that deformed body alight with a blue aurora that was blasting
every cell within it! And now Jimmy Haynes walked across the floor,
his skeleton hand on Mowrer's arm, his sightless eyes deep pits
wherein white marbles rolled!</p>

<p>Was the little old man, whom Thorndal had condemned, indeed the
instrument of God's vengeance? Had he been infused with power to
raise the dead? Was this concourse of inhuman figures a gathering
of the damned, raised from the grave to visit retribution upon
their slayer? The solid walls rocked around me and the floor,
heaved beneath my feet...</p>

<p>There was a desk on the dais near the entrance to this corner of
Hades, and two chairs had been placed behind it. Those two went
directly there, Mowrer guiding the other with infinite tenderness.
They sat down. There was something appalling in their slow
progress, an awful threat in their grim, still faces. To my
tortured vision Haynes was Beelzebub himself, the ebony-skinned
Mowrer his chief disciple.</p>

<p>In response to a motion of the secretary's hand the others
ranged themselves to one side, intent, listening. Utter silence
clotted in the room. The foul odor of rotting bodies was stench in
my nostrils, and the mercury lamps added the last touch of horror
with their ghastly light and the huge shadows they cast across the
floor. It seemed to me that vast black wings beat overhead...</p>

<p>"Andrew Thorndal!" Mowrer's tones had lost their shrillness, the
thinness that had spoken of age and pain. They had a husky quality,
were hushed, though clear and penetrating, as if he were himself
appalled by that which he was about to do. "Andrew Thorndal! That
you may not hereafter complain you were unjustly condemned, a jury
of those you have wronged will hear you. Have you anything to
say?"</p>

<p>An instant Thorndal's nostrils flared, then he was speaking,
calmly, steadily: "With what am I charged?"</p>

<p>"With exploiting for your private profit the people of a
countryside. With condemning to torture and death men too dulled
and stupid to withstand you."</p>

<p>"They were starving when I came, were clothed in rags. I gave
them work, money with which to buy food and clothing."</p>

<p>The voice of the accuser was implacable. "You lured them into
your power," he said. "You gave them suits that at first protected
them, but when you had set up your fences of death and your cordons
of armed guards so they could not escape, the suits failed. You
cheapened them, to save a few paltry cents in the cost of the only
defense they had against the hell-gas you devised."</p>

<p>"No!" The syllable blasted into the room. "No! The suits failed,
but that was not my fault. They were the same. I swear to you they
were the same. I do not know why they failed." I felt that he was
not answering Mowrer then. He was answering something within
himself, some question that had robbed him of sleep, that had
clouded his eyes even when I brought the subject up in our first
talk an eternity before.</p>

<p>Mowrer returned to the attack. "If that were so," he demanded,
"why did you not shut the plant till you had determined the reason
and remedied it?"</p>

<p>Thorndal looked at him unbelievingly. "Shut down! Why I could
not do that. We could not meet the demand as it was. Tri-State Oil
had their backs against the wall. Another month and they would have
folded up. Neosite would have been in every car and airplane tank
in America. Close and give them a chance to say the supply of
Neosite was unreliable, could not be depended upon! That's what
they wanted; that's why I had armed guards on the road, so they
could not send their agents in to shut me down. They tried it,
persistently. I had to go ahead. Had to!"</p>

<p>Good Lord! This general of industry, this master of men, was
himself a slave, a Frankenstein to the monster of his own creation!
In a flash I saw it. He had given himself to the service of
Neosite, and Neosite had become a Juggernaut riding down and
crushing out every atom of humanity in him! He would sacrifice
himself to Neosite as he had sacrificed the poor, maddened
creatures around us, without the least hesitation. Somewhere deep
within me was born a tiny spark of pity for the man.</p>

<p>But not so with Mowrer and the others. The prosecutor broke the
silence with, "That is your only excuse?"</p>

<p>"That is all." Thorndal's brown eyes had retreated again into
lethargy. Something like contempt hovered about his lip corners. "I
have nothing more to say."</p>

<p>Mowrer half-turned to the hulk in whom I had recognized Haynes.
"Andrew Thorndal has condemned himself from his own mouth. Need I
say more?"</p>

<p>The gigantic head moved slowly in negation. Then a whisper came
from its mouth, an awful sibilance of sound that was like nothing
save one's imagining of a voice from beyond the grave, a voice from
the fleshless lips of a skeleton dead so long that even the worms
had lost interest in it. Yet the words were clear: "You have heard
charge and defense. What is your will?"</p>

<p>And that jury of the dying, those who still could talk among
that jury of the damned, roared their answer: <i>"Guilty!"</i> Like
the yapping of wild dogs it was, like a fiends' chorus from
Hell.</p>

<p>Haynes nodded. "Andrew Thorndal," he whispered. "You will die as
they died. It is my regret that you will die more quickly."</p>

<p>Mowrer stopped, spoke again: "Nancy Thorndal! You have danced
while men died that you might clothe yourself in silks, have given
yourself to pleasure while mothers' hearts were wrung with despair
that you might drink fine wines..."</p>

<p>I shouted something, and Thorndal's voice thundered: "She knew
nothing about it. Let her go, you devils!"</p>

<p>"'The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the
children...'"</p>

<p>"Jury," said Haynes. "What is your will?"</p>

<p><i>"Guilty!"</i>
</p>

<p>God! Even they could have spared her. I ripped curses at them,
but I might have been crying in a desert for all the attention
anyone paid to me.</p>

<p>And the inexorable voice of the judge came back from the dead,
husked the sentence, "You shall die in the gas."</p>

<p>"Stanley Sutton!" The farcical trial went on. "You were warned
and persisted. You aided Andrew Thorndal and defended him from me
and from his other victims. You shot down the messengers of
vengeance."</p>

<p>"Go to hell," I snarled. "What's the use of my saying
anything?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Die in the gas."</p>

<p>I didn't care. If Nan were to go that way I was satisfied to go
with her...</p>

<p>"Randall Johnson! You were foreman of the nitration room and
sent men to their death without compunction. You sat at this desk
in the only suit that functioned and watched them labor in the
shadow of their doom."</p>

<p>The tall man turned to his accuser. "I helped you in your plot,"
he said. "When nobody could get through the fence I told the guard
something was wrong in here and I must see Thorndal at once. They
passed me through and I shut off the current that would have held
you back."</p>

<p>So it was he who had done that! But that did not tell why he had
been engaged in a covert confab with someone else on the bedroom
floor. Nor could it have been he who planted the tank of gas in my
room. I wished now that I had not awakened then. At least I should
not have had to watch Nan die.</p>

<p>Mowrer was pondering Johnson's plea. He raised his head now.
"No!" he said. "We used you, but that did not win for you
absolution from your sins." There was a murmur of approbation from
the macabre group of listeners. "You were in our power and you
thought to bribe us with your offer of aid. Your guilt is too black
to be washed white by one act of repentance, if repentance there
was."</p>

<p>Thorndal was looking at the bald man with burning eyes. If he
were free, I thought, he would tear him to pieces with his bare
hands.</p>

<p>Again the ritual of reference to the jury, the chorused
"Guilty," and Haynes' eerie voice pronouncing sentence: "You will
die in the gas."</p>

<p>Johnson sagged against his lashings, and his eyes were the orbs
of death. "No," he whimpered. "I can't face it." He surged up as
far as his lashings would permit and screamed, "Oh, God! Don't let
them do it!"</p>

<p>A lank creature whose face was a red blob yelled, "Shut up, yuh
rat. Yuh held a gun on me when I wanted ter git out o' here."</p>

<p>Mowrer, ignoring Johnson's screams, peered near-sightedly past
the four of us who had been condemned. "You, there," he said. "What
is your name?"</p>

<p>"Wuh&mdash;William Lannon." The popinjay's jaw shook visibly as
he answered.</p>

<p>The little man who had brought about this holocaust turned to
Haynes. "I know nothing against this man," he said. "His presence
here is pure accident, and he did not fire at us when we attacked
the house. But he must die that God's work that we do may go
unpunished by man's blundering law. We dare leave no witness."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" Lannon's voice rang out. "I won't say anything. I
swear it by everything that is holy to me. I won't say anything if
you let me go."</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause. Then Haynes projected toneless
words into the room: "You swear silence as to all that has
passed?"</p>

<p>"I swear by my dead mother's name, by my only hope of
salvation." He was cringing, pleading. "No one knows that I came to
Newville. No one will ever know if you will only let me out of
here." He slavered at the mouth in his eagerness.</p>

<p>Someone called, "Let the poor fool go! He ain't done
nothrn'."</p>

<p>Haynes considered a moment, then nodded. Mowrer pointed to one
who was less burnt than the rest. "Release him," he ordered.</p>

<p>"No!" It was a squeal so shrill that for an instant I could not
locate its source. "Stop! I'll be damned if he'll go free and leave
me to suffer." Johnson was yammering those words, straining at his
ropes, his bound hands clawing at his sides. "Listen to me!
Listen."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Mowrer clipped.</p>

<p>"Johnson! Don't tell them!" Lannon screamed, wild-eyed. "For
God's sake, don't."</p>

<p>"Silence!" Haynes husked. "Silence. We shall hear him."</p>

<p>That voice from the dead struck Lannon dumb. But his mouth
remained open in a soundless scream, and the terror in his eyes was
an awful thing to witness. Yes, even in that chamber of horrors
there could be a greater horror: his naked soul revealed in those
staring orbs. My scalp tightened as I guessed what Johnson had to
tell.</p>

<p>That one was speaking, malevolence vibrant in his now steady
tones: "His name ain't Lannon. It's Rand, Morton Rand, and he's a
vice-president of Tri-State Oil."</p>

<p>An inarticulate roar from Thorndal blasted the man's next words,
a thunder-sound of fury.</p>

<p>"Silence," came the command of the judge who had been dead and
was now alive. "Silence!"</p>

<p>"He got me, no matter how," Johnson went on. "A hundred grand
they paid me&mdash;to put Neosite on the fritz. A hundred grand.
For that I smeared oil on the rubber safety suits, so that they'd
be porous an' let the gas through. I didn't put it on my
own..."</p>

<p>"You lie, damn you. You lie!"</p>

<p>Lannon's shriek set off a cataclysmic tumult of noise.
Thorndal's boom, "You dogs! You cowardly dogs!" Johnson: "It's the
truth. I can prove it." Mowrer mouthing: "God's vengeance. God's
wrath upon him." And the agonizing screams of the victims of the
gas: "Kill! <i>Kill! KILL!!!</i>"</p>

<p>Only I was silent, horror-stricken at the lengths to which greed
could go&mdash;I, and Nan. I saw that she had fainted, her head
lolling, her silk-clad body erect only by virtue of the lashings
that held it to the steel column next to mine.</p>

<p>They surged down the long room toward Lannon, those men whose
tortures of the damned had been his procuring&mdash;a wave of
maddened fiends. I saw one, faster moving than the rest, clutch a
fleshless hand in the man's blond hair, and closed my eyes lest I
see him ripped limb from limb. Someone scattered by me, and I heard
Mowrer's voice: "Stop! Stop men! That death's too good for him! I
claim him for the vengeance appointed by God!"</p>

<p>There was a scream, the spat of blows, and the sounds died away.
When I looked again they were going back to their places, and
Lannon&mdash;or Rand&mdash;was still bound to his post, still
alive. Alive, but his face was a raw, bleeding mass, one side of
his mustache had been literally torn out by its roots, his torso
was bare and scored with deep, gory furrows.</p>

<p>The blind Haynes had not moved from his seat. He waited till
they were quiet again, and then rasped out: "Go on!"</p>

<p>Johnson's features were twisted now with bitterness. He looked
odd with that towering, hairless head of his, his long neck with
the Adam's apple moving up and down as he talked. "I thought the
first touch of the gas would scare the men out, or make the boss
quit," he was saying. "But things went right on, an' I had to obey
orders and keep on making Neosite. Last night I caught sight o'
Rand drivin' up to the house, an' knew he'd come to see what was
what. Afterwards he told me he'd gone to the beach where Miss Nan
was and kidded her into bringing him to Newville."</p>

<p>"Afterwards! Then you talked to him?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Three times. The first was through the fence, right after
the boss got home. Rand told me Thorndal had brung a new super that
looked smart, wanted me to fetch him a tank o' gas so's he could
scare Sutton off..."</p>

<p>Scare me off? Murder me! Rage was cold within me as I realized
the viciousness of the man...</p>

<p>"...I brung it to him the second time, when the current was cut
off so's they could take Jim Haynes' corpse off the wire, an' the
third was when you made me go. I wanted to tip Rand off, to tell
him not to fight you an' he'd be all right." Johnson had been
pouring out his amazing confession in a rush of hurried words, but
suddenly his voice broke into a high, venomous shrillness. "I
risked my neck for the devil, but I'll be damned if I'll let him
get scot-free while I die for what I've done. He's the cause of it
all. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough! We've heard enough." Mowrer's voice was surcharged with
pent fury; it was the voice of doom. "He shall not escape.
'Vengeance is mine! saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p>And in a dread antiphony Haynes husked the sentence, "He shall
die in the gas."</p>

<p>If ever a man deserved death Morton Rand did. But we others...
Nan...</p>

<p>"Men!" I twisted to the sudden bellow from Thorndal. "Men!
Listen to me!" His eyes were blazing, his face alight with
inspiration. "Listen!"</p>

<p>There was a rustle. Someone shrilled, "No! We've heard enough
from you!" But Thorndal went on, roaring down all opposition:
"Listen! The suits are good! You know it now&mdash;I knew it all
the time. The suits are good and we can make Neosite safely. We can
make Neosite and sweep Tri-State off the map. I'll raise your
wages, I'll treble production. I'll give you pensions&mdash;build
schools&mdash;Newville will be the wonder, industrial city of the
world!"</p>

<p>A hissing started, venomous. High-pitched cries from blackened
lips: "No!&mdash;Stop talking.&mdash;We've had
enough!&mdash;Murderer!&mdash;Torturer!&mdash;The gas&mdash;<i>Turn
on the gas!"</i></p>

<p>Thorndal roared on, unhearing, uncomprehending. He was mad with
renewed hope, not for his safety, not for his daughter's, but for
his Neosite...</p>

<p>"Hell! I don't want to make any money out of this. I'll give all
the profits to the workers, run the thing for nothing! Just let me
go on making it. You can't kill it! You can't kill Neosite, the
best damn fuel that was ever invented, the fuel of the future. It
will revolutionize transportation if you give it a chance. Listen
to me..."</p>

<p>"Silence, Thorndal." The impact of Haynes' awful voice got
through him. "Silence!"</p>

<p>Thorndal stopped, and for the first time there was consternation
in his face, realization of defeat. Not make Neosite! He just
couldn't understand it.</p>

<p>The whisper of doom from the dead man's lips came again. "No,
Andrew Thorndal," he said. "Though it was not your fault that the
suits failed, yet when they did fail you drove on despite that
failure, despite the black death it brought on those over whom you
cracked the whip of your will, the dumb, helpless creatures you
enslaved. For this you merit the death you gave them, you and
yours, you and all your works. The sentence of the court
stands."</p>

<p>And Mowrer's harsh accents put a period to hope: "'Vengeance is
mine, saith the Lord Jehovah. Vengeance is mine!'"</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE DEATH-WHEEL
TURNS</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS watching Nan with anxious eyes, praying that
she would not revive till the gas had done its foul work. The room
was clear now of that awful company. We five were alone, bound to
the steel columns that were to be our stakes of martyrdom, alone
save for one ghastly figure. Haynes stood with his skeleton hand on
the fateful valve-wheel, Haynes who was dead already and so was not
afraid to die again. He stood there, the muscles that criss-crossed
his skinned head taut with some inner tension, his grotesque skull
canted as though he were listening through the tiny orifices where
ears had once been. What sound was he listening for, what awful
sound heralding our doom?</p>

<p>Somehow I could not believe that this was the end. There was no
hope, and yet my brain still struggled for some way out.
And...inspiration flashed on me! Perhaps&mdash;now that he was
alone...</p>

<p>"Haynes!" I cried. "I'm Sutton, Stan Sutton, from Tech. Your
classmate. You can't kill me, Jim Haynes!"</p>

<p>The figure there at the wheel started, turned toward me his
black sockets wherein sightless white orbs rolled. "Who calls Jim
Haynes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Stanley Sutton! We've studied together. Remember Prof. Carlon
and the campus songs? Remember the night we licked Yale? Remember
commencement and the two <i>cum laudes,</i> you and I?" Was I
getting it across? Tech has a strong hold on her grads; was it
strong enough to stop him? "You wouldn't blast Stan Sutton with the
green gas, Jim."</p>

<p>His rotted teeth moved in signal that he was about to speak, and
I stopped, held my breath. His voice came, that hushed, spectral
voice of his that had pronounced sentence of death in the court of
the damned.</p>

<p>"Jim Haynes is dead," it said...Then the awful thing was
true..."Thorndal killed my brother Jim and I watched him die." I
rocked back against the pillar. Once, once only, I had heard Haynes
speak of a twin brother, Sam. "Now Thorndal dies, and his child,
and his minions who have done his will."</p>

<p>Haynes&mdash;Sam Haynes&mdash;turned, and twisted the
valve-wheel! The iridescent fluid gushed from the pipe-mouth in a
six-inch stream, struck the black pool and spattered. Some of it
reached me, wet my clothing and the rope that was wound around me.
A drop hit my hand, stung. It was an organic acid, I recalled,
caustic almost as the green gas it produced.</p>

<p>"I'm coming," Haynes squalled. "I'm coming, Jim," and plunged
into the black pool, disappeared beneath its surface! He shrieked
as the acid burned him, and his struggles mixed the reagent with
the processed oil it would change to Neosite. As by magic the fluid
cleared, turned pink, then a milky-white. I stared at the faint
green mist that formed on its surface, that spread rapidly, that
boiled up in manifold tiny bubbles from the depths below. The green
gas was rising in a lifting tide of death.</p>

<p>God! It rose so slowly, so deathly slow. It would be hours,
hours before it reached the level of our heads. I had shuddered at
the thought of swift, searing extinction by that burning mist, but
I had not envisioned the dragged out torture that was in store for
us. Now the awfulness of our fate burst upon me full force. Tied,
helpless to move, the green gas would creep up on our tormented
frames, inch by slow inch, corroding our flesh, searing deep to
bone as it rose, while still we lived, while still we were
conscious of every agony, every torture of that slow advance!</p>

<p>The tendrils spread, coalesced, formed a thin pool on the stone
floor, a pool that rolled nearer, gradually nearer with its
terrible threat. I pulled my eyes away from it, sought Nan again.
She was awake! She was staring at the green gas and her eyes were
pits of terror.</p>

<p>"Nan," I called. "Nan!" And, forgetting they were bound, I tried
to raise my arms to her.</p>

<p>Tried to! Almighty God! They came up! The rope snapped, and my
arms lifted!</p>

<p>I gazed at my hands unbelievingly, saw white marks of acid burns
on them. The reagent that had splashed on me&mdash;the iridescent
acid...I glanced at the frayed rope-ends, moist and blackened...
The acid that had spattered on them had eaten through the thongs
binding me&mdash;had freed me!</p>

<p>"Nan," I gibbered, laughing hysterically. "Nan, it's all right.
I'm loose! Heads up, Nan!" I worked frantically at my lashings and
got them off, leaped to her and liberated her. There was a long
shelf under the windows, a shelf on which bottles were arrayed. I
lifted her to that. "Stay there till I get the others untied," I
said. She should be safe there, safe for thirty minutes at least,
so slowly was the gas coming.</p>

<p>Thorndal was exultant as I plucked at his ropes. "Good work,
Sutton," he said. "Good work! We'll get out of here and start all
over again. We'll build another Neosite factory somewhere else and
you shall be my partner. You'll run the plant and I'll attend to
distribution."</p>

<p>My hands dropped away from the knots. "Nothing doing, Thorndal.
Swear to me there will be no more Neosite or I'll leave you
here."</p>

<p>"No more Neosite! Man! You're crazy!"</p>

<p>"I will be crazy if I let you start making that hell's brew
again."</p>

<p>"Hurry, Stan. Oh, hurry!" Nan called to me from her perch.
"Look, the gas is near you. It will burn you and dad!"</p>

<p>I twisted. There it was, inches away from my feet, the burned
feet whose pain I had forgotten in the blazing excitement of all
that had happened. It was spreading all through the long room, but
there was time yet. I turned back to Thorndal. "Well, what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"No! I'll never promise that. If I did there would be no reason
for me to continue living." He was honest, at least. He could have
given me the promise I demanded, and broken it later.</p>

<p>"Then you'll stay here."</p>

<p>I turned away. And Nan screamed, "Stanley! Stanley Sutton! What
are you doing? You're not going to leave my father. You're not!"
She started to scramble down from her refuge.</p>

<p>"Get back there! Get back, I say!"</p>

<p>"Not unless you untie dad. If you don't, I shall."</p>

<p>I stared at her determined little face, so like Thorndal's now,
and weakened. "All right, Nan," I answered. "Get back." I don't
know whether I would have gone through with my bluff, but I had
been determined to extort the promise from him. The first touch of
the gas would have&mdash;But she had settled that. It took me
seconds to complete the job.</p>

<p>"Fine," Thorndal grunted, stretching. "Get Nan away. I'll take
care of the others."</p>

<p>"All right," I snapped. I was beginning to fear someone would
come back to see why Haynes had not emerged, for surely they could
not have known of his contemplated suicide. "We're going out the
window..." I rattled my plan, then leaped for the shelving, thrust
up the window. It screeched in its disused grooves.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight now. I saw the round black hole from which
I had removed the cover...My eyes lifted, and far beyond the woods
I saw figures turning to the sound of the window's opening. They
started to run back, but one remained behind. I saw a rifle lift to
his shoulder, saw the flash of its firing. "Come on, Nan," I
gasped. "Quick."</p>

<p>She clung to me, frightened. "We can't get away, Stan," she
said. "They'll catch us."</p>

<p>"Come on!" I got an arm around her, thrilling even in that
instant to the warm softness of her body, and jumped. It was only a
step to the opening to the oil pipe, but a bullet whistled
uncomfortably close to my head as I took it, half-dragging Nan with
me. Then I was kneeling, peering down into the pit. It looked dry,
clean. "Down here, Nan," I said. "It's our only chance."</p>

<p>She hung back. "Dad. He isn't..."</p>

<p>"He's freeing the others. He'll be right along. Hurry!" Another
bullet spat dust a foot from us. "Slide in and I'll lift you down.
Quick!"</p>

<p>She was sitting on the well-curb, her feet within. I took her
hands, swung her down. Her face lifted to me, a pale oval in the
dimness of the shaft. "I can't reach bottom with my feet," she told
me.</p>

<p>"I'll drop you. It's only a foot or two." I let go, and heard
her thud to the bottom. "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a tunnel, Stan. I can stand almost straight in
it."</p>

<p>"I know." I looked up. The running men were nearer, and the one
with the rifle was aiming more carefully.</p>

<p>"Is dad coming?"</p>

<p>I glanced back. Thorndal was heaving through the window and
something metallic gleamed in his hand. I slid into the bore, hung
from its rim by my hands. "Look out, Nan!" I cried, and let go.</p>

<p>The hole was deeper than I thought, ten feet at least, its sides
smooth. The shock of my landing sent pain shooting up my legs. The
light-disc above darkened and I ducked back into the conduit.
Distant shouts came to me, and Thorndal dropped down the well.</p>

<p>"I have a gun, Sutton," he said. "It was in the lab and I knew
we'd need it. Cartridges, too, this time. We can stand them off
indefinitely here."</p>

<p>"Johnson! Lannon! Are they coming?"</p>

<p>"Coming?" he snarled. "Hell! That double-crosser and the hound
who bought him? They won't bother us any more. They're stewing in
the tank."</p>

<p>My mouth opened, closed. I couldn't say anything. They deserved
it, but only Thorndal could have done that. My mind flashed back to
the scene in the lobby when Mowrer had been dragged off to the
nitration room at his command. He hadn't changed. All he had
endured was powerless to change him!</p>

<p>Sunlight streamed down the shaft, and dust motes danced in it.
Then a shadow fell blackly down.</p>

<p>"Keep back," Thorndal shouted. "Keep back or I'll shoot!" He
backed away from the bottom of the well, crouching, the bulldog
revolver snouting...</p>

<p>There was a muffled clamor above, the shrill voices of the
gas-blasted men whose doom we had escaped. The shadow flickered
away, returned. And suddenly a twisted shape thudded down!</p>

<p>The thunder of Thorndal's gun deafened me. Nan screamed, and her
father's full-chested bellow echoed in the pipe behind: "One down!
Any more coming?" There was a note of triumph in his tones, the
exultant lift of a fighting man at the smell of battle. I moved
back to where Nan knelt, got an arm around her. The man Thorndal
had shot was a crumpled heap in the light. He rolled his flayed
face toward us, the ligaments quivering. His eyes glazed, and he
didn't move again. We waited, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>"They're licked, Sutton," Thorndal growled. "They don't dare
come down. We've got them licked!"</p>

<p>I could distinguish Mowrer's high-pitched voice, crisp with
command, and doubted Thorndal's statement. They couldn't come down
to pursue us, but he would find a way to get at us. He was
indomitable, implacable. He would not allow us to escape his
revenge so easily. Thus my thoughts, but to Nan I whispered, "We've
won, darling. We've won! They can't touch us now." The term of
endearment came naturally; I had not forgotten the message of her
eyes.</p>

<p>"That horrible face!" She shuddered. "I can't stand it. Stan,
it's driving me mad."</p>

<p>"Here. Hide your eyes against my shoulder."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; NIGHTMARE FLIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">MINUTES dragged. The huge pipe in which we had
found refuge stretched back behind us into blackness, its steel
walls rusty. I knew that it stretched so for miles, till it met the
pipeline from the Texas oilfields.</p>

<p>"Sutton," Thorndal called, without turning his head. "About two
miles back this pipe comes to the surface and lies along the top of
the swamps. There's another manhole there, for cleaning purposes.
You and Nan make for it, and get help from Roton. I'll hold the
fort here."</p>

<p>"That will take hours. You can't keep vigilant forever. They'll
catch you napping and grab you again; come after us. I'll stay here
with you, and Nan will go for help."</p>

<p>She stirred in my arms, pulled away. "No!" she said. "No! I
couldn't go through all that long dark alone. And besides, I won't
leave dad and&mdash;and you, Stan."</p>

<p>"Good God, girl!" I burst out. "You must. It's the only way, the
only way we'll ever get out of here."</p>

<p>"You go, dear." Ineffably sweet, that word on her lips. "You go.
I'll watch here with dad. I can shoot."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>There were ominous clinkings at the surface. "Sutton!" Thorndal
exclaimed. "They're sticking a big pipe down the manhole, one of
the conveyor tubes from the processing room. What do you think
they're up to?"</p>

<p>My scalp prickled. "It's some devilment...Mowrer isn't beaten
yet!"</p>

<p>"By God! He'll be beaten before I'm through with him! Beaten to
a pulp!" Thorndal banged his free hand against the steel side of
the pipe in an ecstasy of defiance. "Beaten to a pulp."</p>

<p>"Shhh!" Nan hushed him. "What's that sound?" We fell silent,
listening intently. I heard a dull throb, throb; thought it was the
sound of blood in my ears. Then I was certain it was not.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a pump," I whispered. "But it can't be! What would
they be doing with a pump?"</p>

<p>"I'm frightened," the girl breathed in my ear. "Stan,
I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter!...Look!"</p>

<p>There was a green glow, suddenly, in the aperture. We watched
Thorndal's bulking frame silhouetted against it. He leaped back,
cursing. I smelled an unmistakable odor. A trickle of the emerald
vapor crept lazily into the thin cylinder of sunlight that still
came down from the world above.</p>

<p>"Run!" I shouted, choking. "Run!" And even as we turned to flee
the first great gush of the death-gas billowed forth to follow us!
Mowrer had found a way indeed! Bullets were of no avail against the
weapon he had devised to confound us!</p>

<p>We ran into the pitch blackness of that long tube, and the green
glow of horror rolled after us, aided by the down-pitch of the
tube, spurred by the throb, throb of the pump, the echoing thud of
which followed us mercilessly.</p>

<p>I can't remember much of that nightmare flight, except that the
steel was sharply curved, and its roof so close down that I was
half-stooped over as I ran, that the soles of my feet were torn
once more by rust and my scalp bruised again and again by some
inequality overhead. Nan was somewhere in front, I next, then
Thorndal&mdash;cursing, cursing in a rumbling monotone as he ran.
His voice thundered as it echoed through that long tube, the pump
throbbed, the green gas followed us with its deadly luminance. We
stumbled onward through an infinity of lightless constricted space,
an eternity of time.</p>

<p>How long, I thought, how long can we last? We may go on and on,
but finally we must drop, and the gas will roll over us, over Nan,
and Thorndal and me, and blacken our bodies as had been intended
from the first.</p>

<p>It seemed to me I could hear Mowrer intoning his awful refrain:
"'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Under my tortured feet the pipe curved, slanted upward. The
ascent slowed us, but it slowed the gas still more. We drew ahead
of the threatening glow, and I began to hope that perhaps we should
beat it. If only we were far enough ahead when we reached the
manhole of which Thorndal had spoken, that we might have time to
get it open before the misty death caught us!</p>

<p>"Faster," I gasped. "Faster, Nan!" I could barely make out the
pale glimmer of her, ahead.</p>

<p>And suddenly she was gone! Her shrill scream echoed back to me,
but I could not see her. "Stop, Stan," she cried. "Oh, stop!"</p>

<p>I skidded to a halt. "Nan! What's happened? Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here!" Her voice came from my feet, from below me! "Here.
There's a deep hole here; I slid into it. The other side's
vertical. I can't get out."</p>

<p>"A sump hole." Thorndal was right behind me. I could feel his
hot breath on my neck. "A depression to clear the oil of
sediment."</p>

<p>I threw a fearful look over my shoulder. The gas was distant,
but it rolled toward us implacably. "Watch out, Nan," I said. "I'm
coming down for you."</p>

<p>"No, Stan. It's not far across. You and dad can jump over. Don't
come down here."</p>

<p>I took a cautious step, another. The conduit floor flattened
out, slanted steeply downward. I pushed my feet over the edge,
skidded, bumped into Nan's soft body. I must have fallen ten feet,
at least.</p>

<p>"Oh, Stan! You did come! Now you can't get out, either. Feel
here..." She seized my hands, placed them against the opposite wall
of the sump-hole. It was straight up and down, slick.</p>

<p>"All right," I grunted. "I'll lift you out."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me. I can climb like a fly. I'll follow
you."</p>

<p>Of course, I lied. I could get her up, but I would have to stay
behind. The gas would reach here in moments, would pour over the
lip of the depression and swallow me.</p>

<p>"I'll be all right," I assured her. "Hurry! Up on my shoulders,
then grab the top and pull yourself up. Quick!" I must not give her
time to think, to argue! "Up with you!" I got hands around her
waist, swung her to my shoulders. She scrambled erect, I felt her
heels digging into me. Then they were gone.</p>

<p>"I'm up, Stan. Come on."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Nan; I'll be with you in a minute. Go ahead,
Thorndal, jump across. It's only three feet."</p>

<p>"Stan! You can't get out. Oh, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Run, Nan, run. If you love me, run."</p>

<p>She was safe...And Thorndal could save himself. It was an easy
leap.</p>

<p>"Watch it, Sutton," Thorndal said. Good Lord! What was he doing?
Why didn't he jump? The question had scarcely framed itself in my
mind when he was at my side. "Up with you, boy."</p>

<p>"Mr. Thorndal, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up. She's my daughter and you saved her life. It should
have been I...It will be. Up with you&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>No time for futile argument. Perhaps it was just that he should
be the one to go. Rand and Johnson had paid the penalty of their
crimes; why should Thorndal escape? Protesting nevertheless, I let
him hoist me to his shoulders, lifted myself erect and pulled
myself out of the death-trap!</p>

<p>I glanced back. The awful glare of the gas was
close&mdash;terribly close. In seconds now it would pour down into
the hole where Thorndal was.</p>

<p>"Nan's away," I told him. "She's safe! Maybe I can find
something to help you out, maybe I can save you yet!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, boy. Take good care of her. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>I twisted to start off.</p>

<p>"Stan!" It was Nan, only yards ahead. "Stan! There's something
queer here. Hurry!"</p>

<p>I was at her side. The roof of the pipe lifted here; I could
stand up straight. I felt overhead&mdash;felt a flat plate. My
pulse hammered.</p>

<p>"It's the manhole, Nan!" I cried. "The manhole in the swamp.
We're saved! We can get out!"</p>

<p>"Thank God! Oh, thank God!"</p>

<p>I got the flats of both hands against the cover, heaved.
Superhuman strength must have flowed into me then; the heavy disc
lifted at once, slid sidewise. Blessed sunlight struck down!</p>

<p>"Up with you, Nan&mdash;up!"</p>

<p>I grabbed her, literally threw her out of that damned pipe. And
just as I did so a scream shrilled to me, a strong man's scream. I
looked back. The gas had reached the pit where Thorndal was, was
folding over its edge in a lazy, slow settling of doom.</p>

<p>I got my hands on the manhole rim, chinned, scrambled out. The
oozy, scummed surface of the swamp was Eden to my eyes. Nan had
slid down the tube's surface, was ankle-deep in mud.</p>

<p>"Father!" Her eyes widened in sudden realization. "Where's
father?"</p>

<p>How could I tell her? I pretended breathlessness, pretended I
could not speak. The great pipe was covered with wooden slats
here&mdash;bound to it by wires that were rusted by the moisture of
the morass. One was right at hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;my brain was working lightning fast&mdash;perhaps
I could get the wire off. I jerked at it&mdash;it snapped. And I
was down again in the pipe, the wire coiling after me.</p>

<p>The sump-hole was half-filled with green vapor when I reached
it. But Thorndal&mdash;a shrieking, fear-gibbering wretch&mdash;was
still alive. The wire held, I got him out, just as the gas filled
the pit and eddied over its edge.</p>

<p>I had to guide him to the manhole, to lift his hands to the rim.
I thought it was because he was numbed with fear. But when he was
in the light again I saw that the eyes in his blackened face were
burned white. He was blind!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SOAP and hot water saved his skin. But he is a
sightless, doddering old man in our home now, Nan's and mine. Our
children love their grandfather, he plays with them so gently,
tells such nice stories in this thin, quavering voice.</p>
