  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">BENEATH them was a dull grey-green carpet, laced with white
  patterns that changed every second, dissolving one into the other, to appear
  in newer and more fantastic arabesques. Beneath, too, but nearer, were flying
  wisps of cloud torn to shreds by the fury of the pursuing sou'wester. Ahead
  was a more solid sky barrier, the purple and black vanguard of the storm.</p>

  <p>The pilot shot a casual, but interested, glance at the clouds above, a
  tumbling, rolling mass of grey vapour that trailed bedraggled streamers
  behind.</p>

  <p>Then he looked round at the small mechanic, a grimy youth, with a face
  like Fate. And the pilot grinned.</p>

  <p>He was driving into the teeth of a gale, and the humming whistle of his
  wires had risen to a shriek that sounded clear above the throaty roar of his
  engines.</p>

  <p>He watched the blue blur of his tractor screw, only turning his head once:
  the wink of the Dungeness light came up to remind him that the minutes of
  daylight left to him were few. Night would come inkily and unpleasantly when
  he met the purple cloud bank now only a few miles ahead.</p>

  <p>The forerunner of the greater storm came in the character of a terrific
  blast of wind that lifted the machine fifty feet in the air and dropped it as
  suddenly. The left wing went down and the machine slipped a thousand feet, a
  terrifying sideways toboggan down an airy chute. The one passenger gripped
  tightly at the rail and set his teeth, the small mechanic did not move. His
  eyes were glued to the leather-covered head of the pilot... then the airplane
  righted herself</p>

  <p>Below came the matted lights of Folkestone, and no sooner were they over
  land than the nose of the machine dropped and the roar of the engines
  ceased.</p>

  <p>Not too soon did her wheels touch earth.</p>

  <p>The rain was lashing down, stinging the faces of the men, drumming on the
  canvas wings audibly. The airplane came to a standstill and the pilot,
  unstrapping himself leisurely, swung to the ground and wiped the rain from
  his face with a movement that was peculiarly deliberate.</p>

  <p>"Peace hath her vic-tories, no less renooned than war-r!" he said, in that
  queer Glasgow accent which is neither Irish nor Scotch, but has the
  fascinating qualities of both.</p>

  <p>The passenger was stamping his feet on the soddened ground, unconscious
  apparently that the rain was still pouring down. The force of the storm, as
  experienced from the firm surface of the earth, was mild by comparison with
  the howling tornado which is produced when a 100 m.p.h. Liberty engine bucks
  against a 70 m.p.h. gale.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Mr. George Jackson scarcely realised that more than a gentle
  shower was falling.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" he said, relieved; then, looking round with eyebrows gathered in a
  frown, "This isn't Croydon?"</p>

  <p>"It's the airth," said the little man gently, and looked up at the sullen
  skies.</p>

  <p>"It's no' so bad," he said meditatively. "It's a wee bit saft, but no'
  what ye'd call tu-mool-tuous. But the airth is better till yon clood's
  awa'."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas MacTavish, whom his associates called "Tam"&mdash;most of them
  being wholly ignorant of his surname&mdash;had chosen the Claybury Aerodrome
  for his descent in preference to one nearer London, for reasons not wholly
  unconnected with a significant noise made by his engine. He had guessed the
  trouble and chose the first available landing, for he took no uncommercial
  risks.</p>

  <p>He stood looking after the passenger as he squelched across the soddened
  field, and on Tam's face dawned the shadow of a smile.</p>

  <p>The little mechanic had heaved himself from the fuselage and was walking
  round the machine, a look of anguish on his face.</p>

  <p>"What's hurting ye, Angus?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>The youth's name was not Angus; it was, in fact, Henry Jones, and Tam had
  discovered him in a London slum and had elevated him to the dignity of
  apprentice aviator.</p>

  <p>Henry Jones shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This old bus has seen her best days," he said, and clicked his lips
  discouragingly. "I never did think much of these Bristol machines," he added,
  with gloom. "You mark my words, boss, one of these days there'll be
  TROUBLE!"</p>

  <p>Tam eyed him tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Ye miserable little devil," he said. "Ye never saw an airplane till I
  introduced ye to the 'Pride of Glasgow.' Get up, noo, and taxi across to the
  hangar."</p>

  <p>With a deep sigh Henry Jones climbed into the pilot's seat, and if his air
  was one of magnificent unconcern, his hands trembled and his eyes glittered
  with bottled excitement.</p>

  <p>"And take yer hands off the control, will ye?" roared Tam, who had seen
  the rudder move.</p>

  <p>Henry Jones started guiltily.</p>

  <p>"Noo," said Tam, "run along to the hangar, and if ye lift her so much as
  an inch from the ground, I'll take ye by the scruff of yer neck and the seat
  of yer pants, and there'll be sair hearts in Limehoose!"</p>

  <p>He pulled on the propeller, and, with a splutter that rose to a roar, the
  converted Bristol fighter skimmed along the ground towards the low-roofed
  hangars, Tam walking behind, his eyes glued to the wheels.</p>

  <p>Only once did the machine lift, and he grinned, for it was Henry Jones's
  dearest dream that some day be would lift the "Pride of Glasgow" with his own
  hands and send her zooming to the blue.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the passenger had reached the office and had been greeted
  without enthusiasm by the lean-faced manager.</p>

  <p>"A car into town? Yes, I think I can manage that; you'll have to see the
  passport officer here."</p>

  <p>"Who's the passport officer?" snarled Mr. Jackson.</p>

  <p>"I am," said the other calmly; "and your bag must be examined by the
  Customs officer."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jackson looked round.</p>

  <p>"I am also the Customs officer," added the manager modestly.</p>

  <p>"If that fool pilot hadn't come down here I shouldn't have wanted a car,"
  said the passenger, and the manager fixed him with a cold and steely eye.</p>

  <p>"That fool pilot," he repeated slowly, "was a gentleman who has so many
  decorations for good flying that he has to brace his coat to hold them. He
  was, in fact, the greatest aviator and the greatest fighter that the war
  produced on our side, and if he came down here you may be sure there was an
  excellent reason for his falling short of his objective&mdash;and in the
  circumstances," he added, "I should imagine that you are very lucky to be
  here at all."</p>

  <p>The passenger grumbled something under his breath, and walking to the fire
  warmed his hands whilst the manager telephoned.</p>

  <p>"He isn't attached to a company, is he?" he asked across his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Tam is not attached to anybody but his machine," said Major Burton. "Tam
  is a one-man, one-machine, company; in fact, he is the only genuine aerial
  taxi-driver in Europe."</p>

  <p>He explained that on his demobilisation Mr. Thomas MacTavish had purchased
  an airplane from the War Disposal Board, had erected an hangar in a field
  near his house at Horsham, and had set up in business for himself. His modest
  advertisement in the Times had brought Tam many clients. It had been
  instrumental in arousing the interest of Mr. Jackson, and was the foundation
  of the pretty little scheme which he had evolved.</p>

  <p>"Is the weather likely to change?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Major Burton nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think you will have fine weather to-morrow," he said. "Are you going
  back by air?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jackson said cautiously that he thought he was; then remembering that
  there was no need for mysteries, and that the pilot would probably disclose
  the nature of the engagement, he became more communicative.</p>

  <p>Major Burton watched his visitor depart, and greeted Tam as he came into
  the office to register his arrival and pay his landing fees.</p>

  <p>"Your passenger's gone, Tam," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh ay," said Tam. "I've a wee bit of a repair to be done, Major Burton.
  Do your high-class mechanics work after hours?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say they would for you, Tam," laughed Burton good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"I've a mechanic of me own," said Tam, looking reproachfully at the
  diminutive figure of Mr. Henry Jones. "But he's no' so cairtain aboot his
  diagnosis. Maybe 'tis the engine that's wrong, says he, and maybe 'tis the
  wings. Likely enough 'tis the strut, or a malformation of the nacelle, or
  probably the tractor is losing its pull," he went on mercilessly, "or the
  carburation is faulty."</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry Jones gurgled protestively and hotly.</p>

  <p>"When Angus fails me, Major Burton, sir," said Tam, with a gesture of
  despair, "I feel that the re-sources of science are exhausted. There is a
  strike of brains, ye ken, Major Burton, sir. I'm thinking that there's a
  little watter in the petrol tank, but Angus is no' in agreement wi' me."</p>

  <p>He stripped his leather coat and appeared dry from shoulder to shoulder to
  a point below his knee, and there the wetness showed black and shining.</p>

  <p>"Who's your gentleman friend, Tam?" asked Major Burton.</p>

  <p>"Ma client?" said Tam. "Well, I'm no' so sure. He's engaged me for the
  roond trip. I picked him up at Tremblay in France, in accordance with
  telegraphic instructions confirmed by letter, enclosing payment on
  account."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been bilked?" laughed Burton, as he sat down to make out a
  receipt for the money which Tam had laid on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Major Burton, sir, I am a Scot," said Tam solemnly. "If the passengers no
  pay when they start, it's ma practice to get it oot of them when we're aboot
  sixteen thousand feet up, and the' Pride of Glasgow' is displaying alarming
  tendencies to fall into a tail spin."</p>

  <p>"I ask 'em for it," said Mr. Henry Jones, husky with importance.</p>

  <p>"Angus is my ticket collector, cashier, and portable scientist," said Tam,
  and then dropping his bantering&mdash;"Major Burton, sir, do you know High
  Barnet?"</p>

  <p>The Major nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's in the north of London."</p>

  <p>"Is it likely there's a place there where I could park ma wee greyhoond of
  the skies?" asked Tam.</p>

  <p>"An aerodrome?"</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, it'll have to be more private than an aerodrome."</p>

  <p>The Major pondered.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are any number of fields in High Barnet," he said.</p>

  <p>"So he said&mdash;in fact, be gie me the exact field, but I think I'll go
  up to-morrow and have a bit of a squint," said Tam.</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his side-pocket, produced a fat pocketbook, and after some
  delay extracted a paper which he examined.</p>

  <p>"Here's the hoose&mdash;High Lodge, Barnet. And this is the field that ma
  client said I could come doon in; but to come doon and to get up are two
  different things, Major Burton, sir, as it's an impairtinence of me to tell
  ye."</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't he let you go to the nearest aerodrome? Have you got to pick
  him up?"</p>

  <p>"At dawn on the 23rd," said Tam dramatically. "'Tis an elopement, I'm
  thinking, and I'm seriously considering whether I'll put Angus into a suit of
  white satin or whether I'll be content with gieing the old bus a new coat of
  luminous paint. Don't forget your rosette, Angus."</p>

  <p>"But, seriously," said the Major, "of course your queer business opens the
  way to all sorts of remarkable possibilities. Is it an elopement?"</p>

  <p>"I'm no' so sure," said Tam cautiously. "It would be a graund adventure.
  Canna ye see me waiting in the field, tense wi' excitement? Canna ye see
  Angus here, with a graund boquet of roses stuck in his dairty shairt, and a
  plug hat on his heid, and the bride dashin' across the field in white satin,
  wi' a veil of old Brussels lace, and boots to match? Canna ye no' think of
  them leaping into the fuselage wi' the outraged father dashin' after them?
  Then up we go, and the old man runs to his hangar, and in a few minutes he is
  following us in his gold-plated DH. 7. Angus puts the machine-gun on
  him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no," protested his sometime superior; "you're not at war now!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," said Tam reluctantly, "but it would no' be so difficult to
  manoeuvre overhead and crash him wi' a big chunk of wedding-cake."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"But I'm thinking," he said, shaking his head regretfully, "that 'tis no'
  an elopement. The man's face is verra seenister, and I'm glad he paid in
  advance."</p>

  <p>Tam, late of the Scouts, had no other call to London than his business.
  His wife and their one baby were visiting relations in Connecticut, and his
  house was being run by an elderly but thrifty Scotch lady, of whom Tam was in
  awe, but Henry Jones in absolute terror, for she had views on ablution which
  were wholly at variance with Henry's philosophy of life.</p>

  <p>Tam was not usually curious about the business of his clients. His
  interest began and ended when he bad picked them up and set them down at
  their destination but he was curious about Mr. Jackson. The fact that he,
  although a nervous man, had insisted upon taking the trip in the most
  unfavourable weather conditions, that he had given exact instructions as to
  where Tam was to wait for him, that he had chosen the hour of dawn for his
  forthcoming departure, and his strange avoidance of the London aerodromes,
  all pointed to romance.</p>

  <p>Tam found High Lodge without difficulty. It was an old-fashioned Georgian
  house, with great windows looking out upon a park-like expanse of country, a
  very large proportion of which seemed to be belonging to the property. Tam
  had some trouble in making his observations, for a high wall surrounded not
  only the house but the grounds; but he was gratified to discover that the
  trees were few and no difficulties about taking off.</p>

  <p>Here he might have ended his investigations, and have returned to
  Claybury, but for the fact, as he discovered from examination of the rough
  plan which the man had drawn him, that he was to make his landing at a point
  where he would be screened from the house and observation by a belt of tall
  elms. For it was in the park that his machine had been ordered to
  rendezvous.</p>

  <p>Tam scratched his chin. He had had a few curious adventures since he had
  gone into business as an aerial taxi-man, but never before had he hesitated
  to carry out the services which were demanded of him. He walked round the
  front of High Lodge in time to see a tall, pretty woman saying good-bye to an
  elderly man whose car was at the door.</p>

  <p>The front of the house, in spite of the extent of the demesne, was within
  a dozen yards of the roadway. Probably the extra ground had been acquired
  after the house had been built.</p>

  <p>Tam watched the car drive away, and was standing looking after it when a
  hand fell on his shoulder, and he turned round to meet the suspicious eyes of
  a man who had "detective" written all over him, from the top of his Derby hat
  to the square toes of his heavy boots.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Weel," said Tam slowly, "I want a Rolls-Royce car, a hoose in Berkeley
  Square, a new suit of clothes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None of that," said the other sharply. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I want ye to take your hand off my shoulder before I hit ye in the
  stomach," said Tam; and the man smiled but dropped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anybody in that house?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I canna tell ye till I know who's in the hoose," said Tam.</p>

  <p>The man bit his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "I'm sorry I startled you."</p>

  <p>"Ye didna startle me," said Tam, "but will ye tell me, sir, why the police
  are watching this place?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better go to the station and ask the sergeant," said the other
  shortly and a little unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>Tam walked away more thoughtful than ever. He did not ask the station
  sergeant, nor did he make a call at the local lock-up. He pursued his
  inquiries in his own peculiar way, and he discovered that the owner of the
  house was a Mrs. Lockyer. He discovered, too, that she had recently divorced
  her husband. A villain he was, by all accounts. (His informant on this point
  was a lank youth who wore spectacles and delivered fish. Tam had trailed him
  after he had emerged from the servants' entrance of the house, a gateway
  about fifty yards along the road.) Apparently Mrs. Lockyer was a rich woman,
  and she had married a mysterious Mr. Lockyer abroad. Too late she discovered
  that her husband was a man extraordinarily well known to the police of four
  countries.</p>

  <p>"Why," said the spectacled young man impressively, "he didn't dare appear
  in court when she divorced him. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Ye don't say!" said Tam. "And what are the police agin' the hoose
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's threatened what he'll do to her," said the fish man. "The
  cook told me that he says, if she don't send him money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He explained the presence of the police to Tam's entire satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He went back to Claybury, having made first a very careful note of the
  topographical features of the country, which meant no more than that he had
  carefully located the waterways, the pools, and the reservoirs, for it is by
  water that airmen find their way in the half darkness.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock the next morning Tam left the Claybury aerodrome and drove
  the nose of the "Pride of Glasgow" at such an angle as left Henry Jones a
  little breathless. Up, up, up he went into the purple night, until the ears
  of Henry Jones buzzed, and he found himself breathing more quickly; until the
  fingers of Henry Jones were numbed and blue, despite the fur gloves he
  wore.</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous!" muttered Henry Jones, and referred to the unnecessary height
  to which Tam was climbing.</p>

  <p>Beneath them now was a sparkle of lights that winked incessantly, and
  through the lights ran the grey streak of the Thames&mdash;a ribbon half an
  inch broad and apparently without break, for they were too high even to see
  the line of the bridges distinctly. The eastern horizon from that height was
  rimmed with the orange light of the coming sun, and the sky was a faint
  grey.</p>

  <p>Tam found his water-marks and turned when he was over the city of London,
  moving north.</p>

  <p>The light increased, though it had not yet touched the earth. He had to
  locate his landing, and he circled above the district where he would descend,
  waiting for the light to show him more clearly the exact spot. Then he
  suddenly shut off his engine and came down in a long noiseless, glide,
  touching earth at a spot which had been invisible to him until he was two
  hundred yards above it, yet so excellently accurate was his landing that the
  machine came to a standstill within fifty yards of the spot he had chosen the
  day before. He climbed down slowly. The ground was good for his purpose, the
  spot he had chosen was, he knew, as good as any he would have found if he had
  been permitted to prospect the park at his leisure.</p>

  <p>He strolled to the end of the tree belt, and looked toward the house. The
  big windows showed grey in the dawn-light, but the house was silent and there
  was no sign of life.</p>

  <p>It was nearing six o'clock when he heard a scream. It was faint, and might
  easily have been confused with a high note of a ship's syren, for at this
  hour of the morning distant noises sounded plain and near at hand.</p>

  <p>Tam's eyes narrowed. He took his gloved hands from the deep pockets of his
  leather jacket, stripped them, and pushed back the leather ear-pieces of his
  helmet, but he heard no other sound.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw a figure coming rapidly across the grass from the
  direction of the house. It was running, and it carried something in its arms.
  Tam drew a long breath, and his lined face twisted in a set grin. The runner
  was breathing heavily as he came up.</p>

  <p>"Here you are," he said breathlessly. "Take this: where's the boy?"</p>

  <p>"Get up, Angus," said Tam curtly, and Henry Jones climbed into the
  machine.</p>

  <p>"Be careful," said Mr. Jackson in gasps. "Don't be frightened of it; it
  won't bite you."</p>

  <p>A little wail came from the bundle of clothing he thrust up at the
  startled boy, and Jackson chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Now get away as quick as you can."</p>

  <p>"Oh ay," said Tam. "But where are ye taking the bairn?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jackson's face was white and ugly, and he had in his hand a small but
  useful automatic.</p>

  <p>"To a safe place!" he said, and Tam looked at the pistol. A man who would
  abduct his own child in order to get a pull to squeeze money from its mother
  would not hesitate to commit a worse crime. He pulled hold of the propeller
  and leapt up as the machine was on the move. He threw one glance back as he
  came level with the end of the tree belt and saw another figure before the
  house.</p>

  <p>He was heading now for the wall, but with a push of his stick he sent the
  "Pride of Glasgow" skimming away from the house along a great stretch of
  grass-land.</p>

  <p>There were trees to be dodged, and yet another wall to be faced; within
  fifty yards of this latter the nose of the machine shot up, and she roared
  higher and higher into the air.</p>

  <p>The passenger was sitting behind him, and presently Tam felt a touch and
  took from Mr. Jackson's hand a sheet of paper on which he had scribbled:</p>

  <p>"I will give you a hundred pounds extra for this job."</p>

  <p>Tam nodded, and glancing over his shoulder saw Henry Jones squatting on
  the floor with a baby in his arms, and inside Tam was one great chuckle of
  merriment.</p>

  <p>Higher and higher drove the machine, and now they were flying over open
  country. With the sun came a gusty wind which sent the "Pride of Glasgow"
  seesawing from side to side. Then Mr. Jackson grew alarmed. Tam felt the grip
  of his hands on his shoulders and heard his hoarse voice in his ear.</p>

  <p>"You're going westward!"</p>

  <p>Tam nodded. Then something touched his cheek; it was the freezingly cold
  barrel of the automatic.</p>

  <p>"Eastward!" roared the voice.</p>

  <p>Tam nodded, but still the rising sun threw his shadow upon the instrument
  board.</p>

  <p>Again the grip of the hands on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"If you land anywhere but in France I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>Tam nodded.</p>

  <p>The minutes grew to an hour. The sun was up now, flooding the land with
  light, but still Tam kept his westward course. Once the man glimpsed the sea
  to his left, and they sighted a busy port crowded with ships. Tam, glancing
  backward, saw the change in the man's white face and the almost diabolical
  glitter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Westward, westward, still westward, until there came beneath them a great
  stark plain, sparsely fringed with tiny green squares which represented the
  farms of those who won a livelihood in this hardy soil.</p>

  <p>And then the "Pride of Glasgow" dipped. They were heading straight for a
  little township, the principal feature of which was an ugly yellow starfish
  of brick. Nearer at hand, Jackson saw that the starfish was made up of five
  buildings radiating from a common centre, and he traced about these the black
  line of a wall.</p>

  <p>There was only one clear space within that wall, and it was a limited
  space, into which none but an airman of Tam's extraordinary courage and
  resource would have dared to drop. The tail of the machine missed the top of
  the high buildings by inches; the wheels crunched to a gravel path, and the
  "Pride of Glasgow" came to rest with her tractor screw touching the steel
  bars of a great gate.</p>

  <p>"And here we are!" said Tam, turning round; "'tis the safest place I ken
  for a wee bairn! Noo start yer shootin'."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jackson, white and shaking, had no words, and when the warders of
  Dartmoor Convict Gaol lifted him from the fuselage and greeted him as an old
  friend, he looked dazedly from Tam to the unshaven convicts at work in the
  yard, their heads furtively turned to witness this great excitement which had
  come into their dull lives, and suddenly collapsed.</p>

  <p>Tam took the baby gently from Henry's cramped arms. She was sleeping
  peacefully.</p>

  <p>"Laddie or lassie, I dinna ken what ye are from yer wee face," said Tam.
  "Ye'd better say good-bye to yer papa. I dinna think ye'll see him again for
  a lang time."</p>
