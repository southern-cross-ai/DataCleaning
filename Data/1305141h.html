  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>1. &mdash; THE LADY CALLED NITA</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">THE lady, called by her intimate friends Nita, stopped at
  the end of the crowded path which leads to the bandstand.</p>

  <p>"Mary, I do not think you need come any farther. Take a park chair and
  wait for me. I may be an hour&mdash;I may be longer. If you see me
  with&mdash;with the gentleman, you will not recognise me by a sign."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"If you think I am being followed, then you may warn me. But I do not
  think that is likely. M. Goucouldis has no idea that&mdash;er&mdash;the
  Prince has any entanglements. But if it should be so that I am watched, then
  very likely his&mdash;agents&mdash;will try to get into touch with you. In
  that case you will tell them that I am Mademoiselle Lemair from Paris. That I
  am the daughter of M. Lemair, the leader of the Popular Party of Sergovia. If
  your questioner has a fit at this, send for a policeman: I understand that
  the English police are trained in first aid."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>It was not an unlikely contingency that the agent of M. Goucouldis, Prime
  Minister and Chancellor of the Kingdom of Sergovia, would grow a little faint
  at even second-hand contact with the daughter of M. Lemair. For M. Lemair's
  was a name that is only whispered in Sergovia. For fifteen years he had been
  exiled from his native land, and though his followers were numerous, they
  were, under the iron régime of the Chancellor, a trifle inarticulate. What
  was known as "The Law of 1909" was a comprehensive measure, so framed that it
  was humanly impossible for a member of the Popular Party to eat, drink or
  sleep within the confines of the kingdom. The Law of 1909 was a modernised
  version of the Ten Commandments, created for the preservation of the ruling
  dynasty, and M. Goucouldis was at once its author and avenging angel.</p>

  <p>It might be explained, lest the Chancellor be shown in an unfavourable
  light, that the Law of 1909 merely replaced the Law of 1903, which made it a
  penal offence to be a Constitutionalist, and was designed to preserve an
  altogether different dynasty, and that the high priest of the Popular measure
  was M. Lemair. In Trans-Balkania, policies are poles apart, and the warmth
  and comfort of an equatorial toleration is an unknown experience.</p>

  <p>On this particular night of July, M. Goucouldis had many worrying
  thoughts, but the spectre of M. Lemair did not intrude its grisly shape. It
  was disturbing to him that he was in London, away from his comfortable villa
  and his subservient bridge partners; more disturbing that he was in
  attendance upon his Prince; most disturbing of all that his Prince at that
  moment had dispensed with attendance.</p>

  <p>"Diplomacy," said the Chancellor oracularly, "is the art of stating
  unpleasant facts inoffensively. It is an unpleasant fact that His Serene
  Highness refuses to marry; it is a pleasant interpretation of his obduracy
  that he is wedded to the interest of Sergovia and its people. He may be
  secretly married already; he may be in love with the unattainable&mdash;God
  knows. In a court like ours I think that it would be impossible that such
  secrets could be kept. And what constitutes the unattainable to a Serene
  Highness, I would ask you? Not any woman in this world. Dear no!"</p>

  <p>The English of M. Goucouldis was of the best, except that in the matter of
  idioms he was occasionally at fault. He was a tall, melancholy man, big
  headed, big nosed, hard mouthed. His blue-grey beard was stiff and
  uncompromising, his tired eyes held something of tragedy. For he had spent
  seven years in a fortress prison in the busy days of the Slavola dynasty,
  when the Popular Party held office, and had seen good men die for their
  patriotism. That was far away and long ago. The Michaeloffs were firmly
  established on the throne of Sergovia&mdash;there had not been a revolution
  in fifteen years. In these days he could appear publicly wearing the hated
  cerise and green ribbon of Sts. Michael and Sofia, without fear that a
  fanatic's bullet would spit a viperish protest against his unorthodoxy.</p>

  <p>Nowadays the rival Churches of Sergovia dwelt together in
  harmony&mdash;had joint conferences to reconcile the Nestorian theory with
  that of the Monophysites, and were tolerant of Orders named after unqualified
  saints.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor stared out over the darkening park. From somewhere beyond
  the flaming rhododendrons came the soft "humph-humph" of an
  euphonium&mdash;the band was playing, and in the gloom, starred now with
  yellow lights, London was finding relief from the hot work-day.</p>

  <p>"It is not easy to watch a Serene Highness," he grumbled, "and in London
  especially. In Germany it would be simple, but for the moment Germany is ...
  And all the time Paul is growing older, and there appears ever before my eyes
  the nightmare of <i>mésalliance</i>! <i>Sa</i>! At nights I wake up in a
  sweat, dreaming that I must announce to the Diet that he has contracted
  marriage with some little dancer from the&mdash;the Lyceum? No&mdash;Gaiety?
  These things happen. A Serene Highness is human. He loves and desires; before
  him is the barrier of virtue and principle. There is no way past but a little
  door called 'marriage'... it so often happens. And John is so very English.
  Here he was educate', here he was for his boyhood, here he imbibed democracy
  and similar new movements. Where does he go to-night, you think? To the
  opera. Ha, ha! If I laugh, excuse! He is there!"</p>

  <p>He pointed his strong, stubby finger toward the yellow lights.</p>

  <p>"He promenades to the band. Perhaps with an equerry&mdash;more likely
  alone. And a man of romance, you understand? In spite of English training,
  the cricket game, and the box-fighting! To him the Caliph of Bagdad who
  wandered incognito amongst his subjects is an adorable figure. But how could
  any caliph make a <i>mésalliance</i>? Or if he did, having so many wives, it
  would be a matter of percentage&mdash;five per cent, of frightful marriages
  would hardly be noticeable in a well-arranged harem... and there was always
  the bow-string and the sack and the Tigris&mdash;or is it the Euphrates? I
  have got so mixed in my geography since the English have been in
  Mesopotamia&mdash;they alter things so."</p>

  <p>His <i>vis-à-vis</i> on the balcony of the Grand Knightsbridge Hotel was a
  sympathetic Excellency from the Balkans en route to report to Washington his
  success in the matter of a commercial treaty&mdash;a dried-up little man with
  big white teeth which he showed permanently. Joshua Higginbotham was the most
  easily amused Excellency that had ever occupied an European Embassy.</p>

  <p>"Wa-al," he drawled, flicking off the ash of his cigar, "romance has its
  place&mdash;especially in court circles. I guess the people like it. It looks
  fine in two-inch type across the front page&mdash;sort of makes the whole
  world kin. Did you expect to meet the Duchess here in London?"</p>

  <p>Goucouldis nodded.</p>

  <p>"She is here. Of the most exclusive family, poor but royal. The most
  desirable of all the matches, though one hears stories of her levity. But
  that is youth. They say that she plays pranks, has something of the same
  peculiar obsession of my Serene Highness."</p>

  <p>He reached out blindly for a cigar, found it by touch, and did not speak
  until he had puffed the end to a glowing red.</p>

  <p>"There is sufficient romance for him. Marriage with a lady of such
  ingenuity would supply him with an interest in life beyond the ordinary."</p>

  <p>"The Duchess Marie&mdash;I have heard of her. She is the girl who worked
  for three months in a West End milliner's."</p>

  <p>M. Boucoulclis grunted.</p>

  <p>"She desires to shock. That was a passion of her sainted mother, to tease,
  to alarm. Did not that same sainted mother once run away to Siberia and live
  alone in a tent, with twenty <i>sotnyas</i> of Cossacks of the Don searching
  for her? Yes, she is full of pranks. But marriage will steady her. And the
  Michaeloffs are wealthy. Better to be a Crown Princess of Sergovia than a
  pensioned Duchess of Lemberg. If the accounts I have of her be true, they are
  made for one another, John and she. And such a marriage would have enormous
  effects in Sergovia: it would end for ever the poisonous propaganda of the
  viper Lemair, who from his foul Parisian gutter issues a vile and scurrilous
  sheet which still circulates in Sergovia, in spite of the efforts of my
  police."</p>

  <p>They smoked in silence, and then the American asked:</p>

  <p>"What are the chances of a <i>mésalliance</i>?"</p>

  <p>For a second the hard mouth of M. Goucouldis relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Happily, none," he said, with a comfortable sigh. "By the constitution,
  no marriage of a Prince of the House is recognised unless it bears the
  approval of my signature&mdash;or the Chancellor for the time being. When I
  framed the constitution I foresaw everything. In the prison at Albana one has
  time to think."</p>

  <p>He stared wistfully out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I could wish to know what my Prince was doing," he said.</p>

  <p>His Prince at that moment was most harmlessly occupied. He sat in a park
  chair, his hands folded on his lap, listening and yet not listening to one of
  those descriptive pieces which bandmasters love to concoct from the popular
  and half-forgotten airs of yesterday, his eyes searching every passer-by. He
  was young, good-looking, and the girls who paced arm-in-arm to the tempo of
  the music voted him distinguished-looking.</p>

  <p>Presently he saw what he sought, and, springing out of the chair, went
  rapidly towards the slim figure that had come out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I was so afraid you weren't coming," he said.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly as she fell in by his side and walked slowly back the
  way she had come.</p>

  <p>"Really afraid?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Really afraid," he repeated. "My time in London Is so very short that I
  am simply terrified at the prospect of missing any opportunity of meeting
  you. You're not English?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Or American?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm neither English nor American."</p>

  <p>"I knew you weren't," he nodded. "I haven't been able yet to place you. If
  you were French, I think I should detect your accent."</p>

  <p>"Does it matter what I am?" she asked carelessly, slipping her arm into
  his as they turned into a by-path and solitude. "Now tell me what you were
  going to tell me last night."</p>

  <p>It required some courage, but John of Sergovia was not lacking in that
  quality. She listened without interruption until he had reached a period of
  protestation.</p>

  <p>"Your Duchess may be rather nice," she said softly, "and you may be very
  happy with her."</p>

  <p>"Happy!" he said scornfully. "Could I be really happy with anybody but
  you, Marie?"</p>

  <p>"They tell me she is very pretty."</p>

  <p>"She's freakish," he said impatiently. "Even Goucouldis admits that. And
  she has no dignity. Have you not heard of her escapade at Tranter's? To act
  as a shop-girl! I could not submit to be married to a buffoon, however
  attractive and charming she might be. No, I am going to tell Goucouldis that
  in no circumstances will I marry the Duchess."</p>

  <p>"That is definite?" she mocked him, and in another instant she was in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>Presently she pushed him away.</p>

  <p>"You're mad," she said. "Do you realise what it would mean to you if you
  were to marry a woman unknown... unknown to you... a chance acquaintance? I
  might be anything&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"You're everything to me," he breathed. "I've loved you from the very
  first moment I saw you."</p>

  <p>"The very first moment you saw me"&mdash;she laughed quietly&mdash;"was in
  the river. John, dear, it is all very romantic, and it began beautifully with
  a handsome young man rescuing a not unattractive young woman from imminent
  death&mdash;not that I should have died, because I can swim like a fish, and
  the river was so shallow that I could have walked ashore.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There are no buts," he said almost savagely.</p>

  <p>"There's a big but. If you marry me"&mdash;she was watching him
  closely&mdash;" you may lose your throne. And at this moment, Johnny, there
  are so many dethroned monarchs in Europe, and they are so
  undistinguished!"</p>

  <p>"I'd lose the world for you," he said, gripping her by the arm, "the world
  and all hope of heaven! Don't you know what you are to me, Marie?"</p>

  <p>"And your Duchess?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Curse my Duchess! Suppose" he began, but she put her hand on his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," she said gently, "suppose your Duchess isn't such a fright as
  you think&mdash;I do so want to be fair to her. Suppose her vulgar escapades
  are just expressions of her high spirits&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll suppose nothing," he said doggedly. "Marie, I've applied for a
  marriage licence at the registrar's."</p>

  <p>Her mouth was an O of amazement, but he went on:</p>

  <p>"We'll be married to-morrow. Goucouldis has to go to the Foreign Office to
  a reception, and I'll have two hours free in the afternoon. I want you to
  come to dinner to meet him afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what you're doing?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I know what I am doing. Will you?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose I was somebody terrible&mdash;suppose I was a girl called Lemair?
  M. Lemair has a daughter!"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not the militant Sergius?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I were... well, suppose I were she... would you prefer me to your
  Duchess?"</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"If you were the daughter of the most bloodthirsty of revolutionaries," he
  said solemnly, "I would prefer you to my Duchess!"</p>

  <p>A patrolling policeman saw them five minutes later, sitting on a garden
  seat, and discreetly looked the other way.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">M. Goucouldis was a very patient man up to a point. He was
  also a very discreet man, and, knowing something of the ways of young men,
  did not press his inquiries too far.</p>

  <p>He was dressed for the Foreign Office reception when Prince John met him
  in the private dining-room for a <i>tête-à-tête</i> meal.</p>

  <p>"Your Serene Highness will be glad to know that our dear friend, the
  Duchess, is in London: she has been here for a week," he said.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said John indifferently.</p>

  <p>He had only known Marie for a week. How wonderful it seemed! A
  week&mdash;seven days&mdash;a hundred and sixty-eight hours&mdash;and yet it
  was as though he had known her for all eternity.</p>

  <p>"I have written to her illustrious uncle, the Prince Paul of Georgia,
  requesting the honour of an interview."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Duchess?" asked John, with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>"I have not met her, but there is no question of her charm. Her
  photographs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Every one of her photographs looks different," said John contemptuously.
  "I shouldn't know her if I met her. Chancellor, you are romantic!"</p>

  <p>"Romantic?" demanded the astounded Minister, against whom such a charge
  had never been brought.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are! You are for ever weaving stories and imagining tender
  situations! You have jumped to the conclusion that because the Duchess is
  eccentric she must necessarily be a desirable wife for me. You think, because
  she loves to move incognito, she would be a fit mate for one who is also keen
  on hiding his identity. I'll bet you've thought how wonderful it would be if
  I met her thus, and, ignorant of one another's identity, we fell in
  love!"</p>

  <p>M. Goucouldis blinked.</p>

  <p>"I have thought nothing so absurd, Highness," he said, and knew that he
  lied.</p>

  <p>Since his charge turned the conversation in the direction of a race
  meeting he wished to attend, he did not return to the subject.</p>

  <p>John went out before the Chancellor took his departure&mdash;otherwise the
  adventure might have had a different ending.</p>

  <p>M. Goucouldis went into his own private suite to finish his preparations
  for the reception, and there he found an agitated Chief of Sergovian Police.
  One glance at the sallow face of the man brought the Chancellor's heart into
  his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he snarled, "what is this bad news?"</p>

  <p>"It is about the girl&mdash;the lady," stammered the officer.</p>

  <p>"The girl he was talking with last night? Remember this, Sava, that His
  Serene Highness is a young man, and his flirtations are of no great
  consequence. I tell you this for fear you exaggerate the importance of any
  little recreation which His Highness may enjoy during his stay in this dismal
  city. Moreover, I seem to remember that you told me that they walked and they
  talked and they parted. That is how all flirtations should end,
  Sava&mdash;with a walk and a talk and a parting."</p>

  <p>"I have traced the woman and her maid."</p>

  <p>"If she had a maid with her, that is all the more proper," said
  Goucouldis. "Well&mdash;and having traced her, what do you find?"</p>

  <p>"She is Mademoiselle Lemair," blurted the man.</p>

  <p>For a second Goucouldis could not take in the awful 'significance of the
  discovery.</p>

  <p>"Lemair?" he said incredulously. "Lemair? Which Lemair?"</p>

  <p>"Sergius Lemair."</p>

  <p>The Chancellor staggered back and held on to a chair for support.</p>

  <p>"Sergius Lemair?" he croaked. "You're mad! You're trying to frighten me,
  you scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>"Excellency, I swear that I have taken every care to learn the truth,"
  pleaded the man. "She lives in a large flat in Cumberland Place, and her
  servant told me that her name was Lemair, and that she was the daughter of
  Sergius Lemair of Sergovia."</p>

  <p>M. Goucouldis sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible," he said, dry-lipped, "terrible! It is a plot! Oh, for
  one glimpse of Her Serene Highness the Duchess, for all her pranks and her
  shocks! Go quickly, find if His Highness has left the hotel, and ask him if I
  may wait upon him."</p>

  <p>The Chief of Police departed, and returned with the announcement that
  Prince John had left a few minutes before.</p>

  <p>All that happened on that afternoon seemed like a nightmare to the
  distracted diplomatist. It is said that he shook hands with a Foreign Office
  footman, and addressed a waiting chauffeur as "Your Grace." It seemed an
  eternity before the exigent rules of etiquette released him to hurry back to
  the hotel. The Prince had not returned, but ominous news came from his valet,
  who had been ordered to pack two suit-cases and reserve a compartment on the
  Continental Mail, which left that night.</p>

  <p>At six o'clock came the Prince, flushed, exalted, bright-eyed. M.
  Goucouldis pulled himself together with an effort. He brought to his
  dissimulation the experience and training of a lifetime, and outwardly there
  was no evidence of the horror which consumed him when he knocked at the door
  of the Prince's suite and walked in, to greet his master with a profound
  bow.</p>

  <p>"I have to tell Your Serene Highness that the Minister for Foreign Affairs
  was most sympathetic in regard to the question of our frontier, which will be
  adjusted... "</p>

  <p>"I've got something to tell you of much more interest than the demarcation
  of our frontier," said John, "and I've a feeling that I'd better tell you
  without any preamble. Goucouldis, I was married this afternoon to the most
  beautiful woman in the world!"</p>

  <p>The Chancellor's face was a mask.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness has taken an extraordinary step, one which is not usual
  without conference with Your Highness's officers of state," he said.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter which concerns me much more than my officers of state,"
  said Prince John briefly.</p>

  <p>His jaw was set, there was a look in his eyes which did not encourage the
  Chancellor's continuance; but Goucouldis had very much at stake, and princes
  to him were at best but pieces in a game.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is aware that, by the constitution of 1909, no marriage of
  the ruling Prince of Sergovia is recognised unless the marriage certificate
  bears my signature, or the signature of the chief officer of state, for the
  time being?"</p>

  <p>The Prince looked at him oddly, took a cigarette from his case and lit it
  before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am fairly well acquainted with the procedure," he said coolly. "But be
  that as it may, my marriage is irrevocable, and if the Diet does not
  accept&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not a question for the Diet, Your Highness," said the other
  suavely. "If I approve the marriage, the Diet approves. We are fortunate in
  possessing parliamentary institutions, even more fortunate in the fact that
  they count very little."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"I am bringing my wife to dinner to-night, Goucouldis," said John quietly.
  "Whatever views you may have upon the wisdom or unwisdom of my marriage, I
  trust that you will not communicate your disapproval to the lady of my
  choice. She was a Mademoiselle Lemair."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you knew, did you?" The Prince laughed. "What a sly old devil you
  are! Isn't she lovely? Am I not the most fortunate man in the world!"</p>

  <p>The Chancellor was thinking rapidly; all the resources of diplomacy were
  not yet exhausted. Mademoiselle Lemair, patently an adventuress, might prove
  a more tractable subject than her husband. Moreover, he had most thoughtfully
  provided for such a situation as this, for in the constitution it was decreed
  that, if an undesirable wife voluntarily renounced her husband (for a
  consideration not stated), the marriage was <i>ipso facto</i> annulled. The
  Chancellor was no seer, but he had had a long and bitter experience of the
  matrimonial adventures of Sergovian princes, and this clause in the
  constitution had been accepted without comment by other Sergovian statesmen,
  who remembered a certain dancing-woman, taken from a low cabaret and elevated
  to the throne, in the 'seventies.</p>

  <p>"I shall be most happy to meet Her Highness," he said, almost pleasantly.
  "But at the same time I must ask permission to explain to her, in my own way,
  the consequences to Your Highness which must necessarily follow this
  act."</p>

  <p>John looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"If by any chance you are thinking of inducing her to sign a renunciation,
  you may save yourself a whole lot of trouble," he said.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor spread out his hands in a gesture of self-
  depreciation.</p>

  <p>"I am an old man, Highness," he said. "Surely it is within my province to
  give advice to those who are younger and more inexperienced?"</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock when the new bride arrived, a tall, radiant being,
  dressed a little more daringly than the old-fashioned Chancellor cared to
  see; a dark-eyed, smiling girl, who met the challenge of his glance without
  faltering.</p>

  <p>"A snake," he said to himself; "a green-and-yellow snake!"</p>

  <p>Yet he was most friendly and most deferential through the meal that
  followed. It was not until the end that John of Sergovia began to feel
  uneasy. He took the Chancellor aside.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary that you should see the Princess?" he asked. "We are
  leaving by the eleven o'clock train&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is very necessary, Highness," said the old man sorrowfully; "necessary
  for your happiness and for the happiness of Her Highness."</p>

  <p>She was a Lemair all right! The boldness of her, the ready wit of her, the
  mercenary cunning of Sergius Lemair's daughter were all too apparent. Perhaps
  she shared some other of her father's qualities. He was a man not
  unsusceptible to the influence of money&mdash;the Chancellors of Sergovia
  seldom are. His price would be high, his daughter's price even higher; but
  the house could stand even their exorbitant demands.</p>

  <p>John went upstairs to change, and the girl and the old man were left
  alone, and he thought he saw her bracing herself for the coming struggle.</p>

  <p>He walked to the door and closed it after the Prince, and then came slowly
  back to the writing-table, on the side of which she was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Highness, I am a very plain man, with only one tongue. You must realise,
  both from your associations with your illustrious father, and your knowledge
  of my country, that this marriage is disastrous to Sergovia."</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of Sergovia," she said quietly. "Does it occur to you
  that I may really love the Prince?"</p>

  <p>That possibility had not occurred to the Chancellor, and he dismissed such
  an unlikely factor with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>"I will not tell you that it is my earnest desire, and the desire of my
  colleagues, that this marriage should be instantly dissolved," he said. "I am
  a plain man, as I remarked before, and I talk the language which is
  understandable in every country."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a paper and laid it on the table. One glance told
  her that it was the carefully prepared renunciation which she had expected to
  see, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"You will sign this, Highness," said the Chancellor, "and you will name
  your own price."</p>

  <p>She looked up from the paper to him.</p>

  <p>"The gold isn't coined that would buy my signature," she said.</p>

  <p>And then, in a softer tone:</p>

  <p>"Do you realise what you are doing?" he mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Very well indeed I understand," she said.</p>

  <p>She walked to where she had left her bag, opened it, and took out a long
  slip of paper, which she brought back to the table and laid before him. He
  saw that it was her marriage certificate, so recently written that the ink
  had not yet darkened.</p>

  <p>"Your name across that certificate would make our marriage legal," she
  said softly. "Am I not a desirable princess for the people of Sergovia, or
  must they have"&mdash;she spoke deliberately &mdash;"a young and unknown
  Duchess, rather freakish in her habits... rather inclined to shock... even
  hardened Chancellors, with her disguises and masquerades?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her and gasped.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I met your Prince by accident," she said. "I had no design, no intention,
  of making him love me or of loving him. It was one of those queer strokes of
  fate that cannot be accounted for.... I told him my name was Nita. And the
  fun of this very vulgar flirtation so appealed to me that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're the Duchess!" The trembling finger pointed at her almost in
  accusation. "What a fool I've been!... Romance, of course... you wanted to
  shock me, you&mdash;you&mdash;Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>His trembling hand took up the pen, his signature scrawled across the
  marriage certificate. She blotted it carefully.</p>

  <p>"Romance, of course!" he babbled on. "I ought to have known that something
  like that would have happened.... How wonderful! And to think that I was
  worrying my head because I couldn't arrange a meeting with the Duchess, and
  all the time she was arranging matters ever so much better than an old
  blunderer like myself could have done! It is wonderful!"</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang at that moment, and a well-known voice called
  Goucouldis.</p>

  <p>"My friend, I have arranged that meeting for you with the Duchess. She is
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here!" shrieked Goucouldis. "You're mad! I beg your pardon, Highness. I
  mean... the Duchess is here."</p>

  <p>"Then she's in two places at once," said the jovial voice.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor dropped the receiver and turned his ashen face to the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am Marie Lemair," she said. "Didn't you read the marriage
  certificate?... why, Chancellor, I really believe that you are romantic after
  all!"</p>

  <p>"Married . . and approved!" he said hollowly.</p>

  <p>"And your father..."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Father will be pleased," she said, "and Sergovia will be pleased. Be a
  dear and say that you are pleased too."</p>

  <p>But the Chancellor could say nothing.</p>

     name="story2"></a>2. &mdash; THE MAN WHO MARRIED HIS COOK</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Royal Magazine</i>, February 1921</h3>

  <p class="first">ONE afternoon in May, in such a season as the mind of youth
  turns upon tender matters, Professor Tremlow interrupted his study of
  <i>Dactylopterus volitans</i> and sat staring in his absent way at a piece of
  yellow paper outspread upon the desk before him.</p>

  <p>He remained in this attitude for the greater part of ten minutes, then he
  rose, walked slowly across the threadbare carpet which covered the floor of
  his study, and gazed upon himself in the mirror which overhung the
  mantelpiece. Whether he remained staring at the lined face, the horn-rimmed
  spectacles, and the thin grey-shot beard for more than a second is doubtful.
  It happened that perched upon the frame was a peculiarly interesting specimen
  of May-fly. He did not think of this tiny stranger as a May-fly, but
  automatically placed it within the <i>pseudo-neuroptera</i> sub-order of
  <i>Orthoptera</i>.</p>

  <p>He was back at his desk before he realised that he had not taken stock of
  himself, and sighed. He got up again and walked to the mantelpiece, forgot
  what he had risen for and pushed the bell which was embedded in the wall.</p>

  <p>His one man-servant answered and found the professor with his short-
  sighted eyes glued to the treatise he was writing.</p>

  <p>"You rang, sir?"</p>

  <p>Professor Tremlow blinked up.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" he said, startled. "What do you want, Thomas&mdash;William?"</p>

  <p>"Ernest, sir," said the patient butler. "You rang?"</p>

  <p>"Did I?" The professor sat up and screwed up his forehead.
  "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;cook&mdash;tell the cook I want to see her."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said Ernest, and went kitchenwards hoping.</p>

  <p>"Wants <i>me</i>?" said Mary Ann, paling a little.</p>

  <p>She was a plump, red-faced woman, with small eyes, and had kept her family
  for ten years on the overplus from the professor's kitchen. She bad a
  conscience, it seemed, for there had been butchers' bills throughout
  Lent.</p>

  <p>"It's my day out, too. How did he know I was back?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd knows!" answered Ernest piously.</p>

  <p>She slipped off her best coat and put an apron over her best skirt, patted
  her hair before the kitchen mirror, and pattered out.</p>

  <p>"If Willie knew what I know about the grocer's account," said Ernest to
  the kitchen-maid, "he'd take that old geezer and kick her into the middle of
  next week."</p>

  <p>The professor's name was William, and did Ernest but know, he was at that
  precise moment planning to kick his cook into the middle of next
  week&mdash;figuratively.</p>

  <p>The professor swung round in his chair as the cook came in, the chair
  having been designed for such an operation, and he glared at Mary Ann Dobbs
  in so ferocious a manner that the poor woman had a cold feeling in her
  stomach and speculated frantically upon who had turned traitor. Was it the
  coalman or the religious Mr. Smith, the grocer? Such is the sceptic tendency
  of modern thought that she had unjustly condemned a good Christian man when
  the professor spoke.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;Martha&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Mary Ann, sir," smirked the cook apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, Mary Ann. I knew it was a Biblical name. Er&mdash;sit down, Mary
  Ann."</p>

  <p>In all the ten years she had preyed upon the professor be had never asked
  her to sit down, and she obeyed quakingly.</p>

  <p>"You have been with me several weeks now," he began. "When was it you
  came?"</p>

  <p>"Ten years ago last February," said Mary Ann gently.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, indeed," said the absent-minded professor. "Yes, of course, it
  was ten years ago."</p>

  <p>He ruminated, looking down at his boots for some time, and then:</p>

  <p>"Clara," he said, "I have decided to get married."</p>

  <p>She gasped. That meant an end to all her forays and barratries.</p>

  <p>"I have decided to get married," said the professor, in a tone of
  surprise, as though he had only just realised what a remarkable decision he
  had reached.</p>

  <p>"I want somebody who is faithful to me, Alice&mdash;Clara, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Mary Ann," murmured the cook faintly.</p>

  <p>"Somebody who knows my ways," said the professor. "I am not a young man, I
  am not a rich man, Mary," he said, and added, "Ann" with an effort.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the wondering Mary Ann.</p>

  <p>"I cannot give you the&mdash;er&mdash;affection and demonstrations of
  affection which are peculiar to the youthful mammal."</p>

  <p>"Me, sir?" Mary Ann got up, her mouth open, and the professor nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I can give you my name. I can make you
  Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tremlow," squeaked Mary Ann, mouth and eyes at their widest.</p>

  <p>"My lawyer shall come down&mdash;I have been trying all day to remember
  his name&mdash;and he shall fix&mdash;er&mdash;a mutual deed of gift. That
  will be&mdash;er&mdash;more satisfactory, Annie&mdash;Clara, I mean."</p>

  <p>Mary Ann said nothing, but swallowed hard.</p>

  <p>"I believe in community of interest," said the professor. "Er&mdash;that
  is all, Clara&mdash;" and he waved her out of existence.</p>

  <p>Mary Ann went down to the kitchen like a woman in a dream and gave the
  kitchen-maid notice.</p>

  <p>Next day came a lawyer who fixed deeds of gift and settlements, bestowing
  upon the Mrs. Tremlow-to-be one-half of the professor's fortune, amounting to
  nearly £500, some well-worn furniture, and his copyrights in three volumes
  dealing with the science of Zootomy.</p>

  <p>She, for her part, gave him a half-right in two silk dresses, certain
  other articles of wear, a cameo brooch and two gold drop ear-rings, and such
  other property as she might acquire.</p>

  <p>They were married by a horrified cure of souls, and Ernest gave the
  professor away. He would have preferred giving the new Mrs. Tremlow away.</p>

  <p>A week later, despite his attachment to the house and fortune of Professor
  Tremlow, Ernest came to the professor's study and asked for his wages.
  Mechanically the professor paid him a full month, not realising that he had
  paid him a full month only the week before.</p>

  <p>"I'm going, sir," said Ernest, with a tremor in his voice.</p>

  <p>"That's right; shut the door," said the professor.</p>

  <p>"I am leaving your employment, sir," said Ernest.</p>

  <p>Professor Tremlow looked round in astonishment. If Ernest had said that he
  was developing into a chrysalis, the professor would not have been
  astonished, because such things happen.</p>

  <p>"Going, Thomas?" he said mildly. "Going to leave me, Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Ernest, not troubling to correct his master. "I can't
  stand the missus."</p>

  <p>The professor looked at him over his spectacles and through his
  spectacles. He lifted his glasses to his forehead and looked at him under his
  spectacles. Then he sighed and turned to the table.</p>

  <p>"She's a good cook, Thomas; a very good cook. I think you will admit
  that?"</p>

  <p>"She's roasted us all right," said Ernest bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You must be patient&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know your name&mdash;you must
  be patient, William, isn't it? She's a woman of character, is Mary
  Ann&mdash;er&mdash;I'm married to her? You should study patience; study the
  bees, Thomas!"</p>

  <p>Ernest choked.</p>

  <p>"She's a proper bee, she is," he said, with a trace of venom. "She's made
  this 'ive 'um."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a great pity&mdash;a very great pity&mdash;Snellgrove is your
  name, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Marshall, sir&mdash;Ernest Marshall."</p>

  <p>The professor nodded.</p>

  <p>"I knew it was something to do with tobacco."</p>

  <p>And then it was that Mrs. Tremlow flounced in, and Mrs. Tremlow, at the
  sight of Ernest, trembled with wrath.</p>

  <p>"What are you nosing and prying around my 'usband for?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have come for my wages, madam," replied Ernest, emphasising the "madam"
  so that it was almost an offensive word.</p>

  <p>Her little eyes screwed up till they were almost invisible.</p>

  <p>"You're leaving, eh? A lady can't go into her own kitchen but the servants
  give notice." She jerked her thumb to the door. "Push off!" said Mrs.
  Tremlow, and followed him to the door. "Go 'ome and take your mother out of
  the workhouse!" she advised him humorously. "If I had a face like yours, I'd
  have the gas cut off."</p>

  <p>The professor, roused by voices pitched higher than the ordinary,
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying good-bye, my love?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow had come stalking back, fists on hips, triumphant.</p>

  <p>"My brother is coming to-day," she said brusquely, and rather wondered how
  he would take the news.</p>

  <p>Professor Tremlow accepted the tidings in the same spirit as he would have
  accepted the news that there was a rainbow in the sky or that a flight of
  locust had fallen upon the kitchen garden.</p>

  <p>"How interesting!" he said vaguely. "So you have a brother, and I think
  you told me you had a mother too! That's remarkable."</p>

  <p>He took up his pen and wrote a few words, and she watched him in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Look here," she said desperately. "Willie!"</p>

  <p>"Willie?" said the professor in amazement.</p>

  <p>"That's your name, isn't it?" she was not quite sure of herself.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it is," said the professor; "but you may continue to call me
  Mr. Tremlow as heretofore."</p>

  <p>She seated herself upon the identical chair on which she had received the
  marriage proposal.</p>

  <p>"I can't make you out," she said. "Of course, I know these things happen
  in books, Willie&mdash;Mr. Tremlow&mdash;a gentleman marrying beneath
  himself, so to speak&mdash;but I don't understand why you married your
  cook."</p>

  <p>"Ah yes," nodded the professor; "a very good cook."</p>

  <p>"Mind you," said Mrs. Tremlow, "I'm not expecting you to gush over my
  relations. They ain't the kind of people you would gush over, anyway; but
  Tom's a very nice-spoken young feller, and you needn't see him if you don't
  want to."</p>

  <p>The professor did not reply. He had reached the interesting stage in his
  monograph on <i>Chocrocampa tersa</i> where the caterpillar develops into the
  <i>pupae suspensae</i>, which is analogous to that stage in the cinema film
  where the murderer is discovered to be, not the masked butler, but the
  bishop, whom nobody suspected, except the people who had seen the film
  before.</p>

  <p>She had other things to say about her relations, for she felt it wise to
  prepare him for Tom, who had not reached the stage of sartorial refinement
  where he was prepared to abandon his variegated choker and adopt the white
  dicky of civilisation. But she missed her chance.</p>

  <p>A tall man was ushered into the room by the new housemaid, and he greeted
  Mrs. Tremlow with that geniality which is part of the stock-in-trade of the
  family lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Tremlow," he said, with a smile, "you are settling down, I
  see. Have you got quite used to the new life?"</p>

  <p>The professor turned his head.</p>

  <p>"Bless my life, Still!" he said, and looked at his watch. "It's half- past
  five, and you said you weren't coming until Tuesday. You know my cook?"</p>

  <p>"Your wife, Willie," said Mrs. Tremlow, with gentle savagery.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the professor hastily. "My wife, to be sure."</p>

  <p>"I have met you lots of times, Mrs. Tremlow," said Still, putting down his
  bag and snapping open the catch.</p>

  <p>Mary Ann smiled archly.</p>

  <p>"You're the gentleman who used to like my apple fritters," she said.</p>

  <p>"A very good cook," murmured the professor, his pen poised in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I see I am not going to get anything out of you," laughed Still, and
  walked to the long French windows which afforded a view of the professor's
  restricted demesne.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you were surprised, Mr. Still," Mary Ann joined him and lowered
  her voice, though there seemed no necessity for this precaution. "It was a
  bit of a surprise to me."</p>

  <p>"I expect it was," said Still, who had been concerned in so many divorce
  cases, criminal conspiracies, and actions to restrain nuisances that he was
  surprised at nothing.</p>

  <p>Mary Ann coughed, feeling that her own condescension called for a word of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"He's a bit old in the tooth, you understand, Mr. Still, but I've lost a
  lot of chances through being too particular."</p>

  <p>Mr. Still was staring out into the garden.</p>

  <p>"Your husband is under sixty," he protested in a spirit of loyalty to his
  client. "His father lived to eighty-nine and his grandfather was ninety-
  three when he was killed in a wrestling match."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"You're a ray of sunshine, ain't you?" she said, and Still laughed.</p>

  <p>"He is very much in love with you, isn't he, Mrs. Tremlow?" he asked, as
  he began to sort out the contents of his bag.</p>

  <p>Mary Ann sniffed.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that. You see, it is a sort of morganatic marriage."</p>

  <p>"A what?" asked the startled lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Mrs. Tremlow, whose knowledge of the English language was
  hazy, "he might be Johnny Morgan, so far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>Still shot a swift glance toward the bowed head of the professor, and Mary
  Ann sniffed again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't worry about him," she said. "When he gets into his books, he's
  as deaf as a bat."</p>

  <p>"I'm rather glad of that, Mrs. Tremlow, for I want to speak very plainly.
  May I?"</p>

  <p>"Plain speaking is my vice," said Mary Ann truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to be frank," the lawyer was half serious and half
  humorous. "I have known you led the professor a&mdash;er&mdash;well, not the
  cheeriest of lives as his cook. When I came down here two years ago to look
  into his affairs, I found that you had been
  systematically&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say overcharging him," said Mary Ann placidly. "It sounds better. Well, I
  admit that. A girl has got to look after herself in this world, Mr. Still,
  and I hadn't any idea that I was going to get my chance. A girl throws away
  lots of opportunities."</p>

  <p>"A girl," said the puzzled Mr. Still. "What girl are you talking
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Me," said Mrs. Tremlow, with some asperity.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I suppose so. You used to twist him rather round your finger,
  Mrs. Tremlow."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow smiled proudly.</p>

  <p>"And yet," mused the lawyer, "he knew this and married you?"</p>

  <p>Mary Ann drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "love's a funny thing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Still scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't shown any other form of&mdash;er&mdash;I mean he hasn't been
  hearing voices at night or acted strangely in any way?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the bridling Mary Ann. "If you mean to
  suggest that my husband is off his rocker&mdash;pardon the
  vulgarity&mdash;daft&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean anything of the sort," the lawyer was balancing a paper in
  his hand. "Here is the deed of gift, Mrs. Tremlow, a fair copy, whereby he
  transfers half his property and fortune, which by the way amounts to very
  little, to you. Was that your idea?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was and it wasn't," Mrs. Tremlow was on safe ground. "He's a bit
  near, Mr. What-d'ye-call-it, you understand. A bit difficult to get money out
  of, so I didn't object when he made over his bit of property to me. Being a
  lady now," she coughed, "I've got to live up to my station, if you
  understand, and he's that absentminded he would see me walking about the
  house without anything on and take no notice."</p>

  <p>"That is his salvation," said the lawyer earnestly. "I mean
  his&mdash;er&mdash;ability to abstract himself from the humdrum mundane
  affairs of life and bury himself in science."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on the professor's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tremlow," he said, and the professor looked up with a start.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Still," he said. "When did you come?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow made a clucking noise with her tongue to express her good-
  natured tolerance.</p>

  <p>"Here are the deeds we settled the other day. This is your wife's, which
  she had better keep, and this is yours, in which she transfers half her
  property to you. You quite understand that you have given over to Mrs.
  Tremlow half your worldly possessions. You will see the schedule
  attached."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the professor, glancing at the paper and thrusting it
  into a pigeon-hole. "Good-bye, Still. I hope you have a pleasant voyage."</p>

  <p>The lawyer shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"My train doesn't go for an hour," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it doesn't," said the courteous professor, applying himself
  again to his paper. "Trains never do go for an hour."</p>

  <p>Still shrugged his shoulders, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"All right, then, I'll go along," he said. "Good-bye, Mrs. Tremlow."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, love," said the professor.</p>

  <p>"Ain't he the most absent-minded man you ever saw in your life?" asked
  Mary Ann, in tones of admiration as she stood upon the front-door step of the
  house. "He's always telling me to be careful how I cross the road because
  it's so dark. He don't know the war's started, let alone over."</p>

  <p>Still offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"I think you ought to have a very quiet and peaceful life, Mrs. Tremlow,"
  he said. "I don't think you will have a very luxurious life, because the
  professor's income is not as large as it was."</p>

  <p>"We'll manage," replied Mrs. Tremlow determinedly, meaning thereby that
  she, at any rate, would manage.</p>

  <p>He walked down the flagged path to the garden gate and collided with a
  young man who was coming in. He was a burly young man in a ready-made suit,
  and his hair, as the lawyer saw, for in the collision the stranger's hat had
  been knocked off, was parted symmetrically in the middle, so that one long
  but well- plastered curl dipped over his forehead and then, as though
  repenting Its rashness, curled backward to his almost shaven head.</p>

  <p>"Whinecherlookwhereyagoin?" said the young man rapidly, and Mr. Still, who
  understood the language, for his practice had extended even to the lower
  courts of judicature, replied courteously after his kind.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the newcomer Mrs. Tremlow had come rapidly down the three
  steps from the door.</p>

  <p>"Why, Tom?" she said, holding out her hand. "Well, I am glad to see you.
  How did you leave mother?"</p>

  <p>"She's all right," said Tom in a tone of disgust, as though the matter of
  his mother's good health were a sore point with him. "I want&mdash;"
  began Tom.</p>

  <p>"Come and see my husband, Professor Tremlow," said Mary Ann, shivering
  with pride. "He's a real gentleman, Tom, though he's a bit over the age
  limit."</p>

  <p>She dragged the reluctant young man into the study, and it happened that
  the mind of the professor was momentarily disengaged.</p>

  <p>"Willie, this is my brother Tom." She introduced the young man with a
  certain defiance.</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;er&mdash;brother? Glad to see you. Sit down, will you? Have
  you any sisters?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow looked sidelong and significantly at her relative.</p>

  <p>"Absent-minded," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"So you're married?" said Tom, who was a slow thinker and on whom the news
  had just dawned.</p>

  <p>"Married? Of course I'm married," said Mary Ann with a toss of her head.
  "I sent you a bit of the wedding-cake."</p>

  <p>A light broke in upon Tom, whose other name was Dobbs.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's what it was!" he said ungraciously. "But what did you get
  married to him for? Did you get my telegram?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's better than nothing," said Mary Ann tartly, "and I didn't get
  your telegram."</p>

  <p>Tom looked at the professor who had resumed his work.</p>

  <p>"Don't take any notice of him," said Mrs. Tremlow, lowering her voice. "He
  don't belong to this world in a manner of speaking, though from what I've
  heard from his lawyer to-day&mdash;" she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tom grudgingly, "I don't think you've done a bad thing. After
  all, you had to marry a gentleman of position, and I don't know any other
  gentleman of position who would have married you, with your disposition."</p>

  <p>"Don't you say anything against the professor, Tom," said Mrs. Tremlow
  virtuously. "As soon as I was married he handed over half his property to me
  and I handed over half of mine to him, so you might call it a love
  match."</p>

  <p>"I might and I might not," said the careful Tom.</p>

  <p>He was a slow thinker, as has been remarked before, and suddenly he rose
  and clasped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"You gave him half yours?" he said in a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes. What's up?" asked the alarmed Mrs. Tremlow.</p>

  <p>"When did you marry?" said Tom in a deep-set voice.</p>

  <p>"Last Friday."</p>

  <p>"And last Wednesday I sent him a wire," emotion prevented his continuing
  for a moment, "asking him," he went on, "to break the news to you that old
  Uncle Joe in Australia had died and left you £100,000. You was always his
  favourite, Mary Ann."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tremlow grasped the window for support. The room spun round and
  round, and then her shaking knees brought her to her husband's side.</p>

  <p>"Willie," she said, and her voice was very shrill and squeaky, "he sent
  you a wire telling you I was worth £100,000!"</p>

  <p>The professor looked at her and looked at her brother, then he looked at
  his boots, and then he looked at the ceiling, and then he scratched his
  nose.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear," he said, in a tone of surprise. "Yes, yes, I remember."</p>

  <p>"But you&mdash;you didn't tell me," wailed his wife. "No, I didn't,"
  admitted the professor. "Absent-minded, my love, absent-minded. Take your
  brother down to the kitchen and give him a good time, Mary Ann. You know the
  way."</p>

     name="story3"></a>3. &mdash; MR. SIGEE'S RELATIONS</h2>

  <h3>First published as "Change," <i>Ideas</i>, March 17, 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. ALBERT SIGEE'S attitude toward his lawless relations is
  one which has been a source of constant puzzlement to me.</p>

  <p>I know that he regards their peculiar brilliancy with something akin to
  pride. I know, too, that he retails the exploits of his innumerable brothers,
  cousins, and uncles with that modest reserve which may be taken as a sign of
  approval, yet, notwithstanding these indications of his goodwill, I have
  never yet met, in the little bird and beast shop over which Mr. Sigee
  presides, a single member of the family other than Albert himself.</p>

  <p>It would seem that ample opportunity exists, did Mr. Sigee desire to
  employ an odd man or so. Were he fired with the reformer's zeal, and anxious
  to provide honest, if casual employment for his larcenous relatives, he might
  set their minds on the dignity of labour, at little cost to himself. For
  there are bird-cages to be mended, hutches to be manufactured, aquaria to be
  tended, dogs to be cleaned, and a thousand-and-one odd tasks to be
  performed.</p>

  <p>"Relations are best apart," said Mr. Sigee philosophically. (I had
  ventured to question him on the matter and this was his answer.)</p>

  <p>"I've got an uncle," he went on carefully, scraping his short clay
  pipe&mdash;"when I say uncle, he's a sort of first husband to my Aunt
  Bella&mdash;who's one of them fellers that's all for harmony. One of the
  pleasantest chaps the police have ever had to deal with is my uncle&mdash;
  Mr. Downs, the inspector, told me so hisself.</p>

  <p>"S'pose a couple of splits call at his 'ouse one night about twelve.</p>

  <p>"Down comes his daughter Em, with a shawl over her, an' opens the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Emma!' sezs the chief split; 'father in?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' sez Em, 'want him?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, Emma,' sez the split, an' in they go, into the old man's room,
  sleepin' away as peaceful as a perfec' angel.</p>

  <p>"He wakes up an' sees the splits.</p>

  <p>"'Good evenin',' he sez, as polite as can be; 'd'you want me, Mr.
  Simmonds?'</p>

  <p>"'A little matter of a pony an' cart wot was left outside the "Blue Lion
  ",' sez the split.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, that? ' sez my uncle, gettin' up an' dressin'. 'I thought it was
  somethin' serious.'</p>

  <p>"All the time he's dressin' he's as polite an' talkative as possible.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid I've kep' you out of bed,' he sez. 'I wish I'd known; I'd
  have walked round to the station an' explained matters. Em,' he sez, 'send my
  breakfast round to the station to-morrer, an' if I'm put away, see that I get
  my tea before the van goes&mdash;six o'clock, ain't it, Mr. Simmonds ?'</p>

  <p>"'Five,' sez the split; 'five o'clock when the Black Maria goes.'</p>

  <p>"'You surprise me,' sez my uncle; 'what changes we see goin' on all round,
  don't we, Mr. Simmonds?'</p>

  <p>"'Hurry up, father,' sez Em; 'I'm gettin' cold.'</p>

  <p>"It got to be quite a sayin' in the 'R' division that a child could take
  Ropey&mdash;that was my uncle's name at the time&mdash;an' they used to give
  the job to a young split who wanted gentle practice.</p>

  <p>"He used to go so quietly that some of my cousins thought he wasn't quite
  right in the head, an' when he came out after doin' six munse for a ladder
  larceny, they got up a sort of friendly lead to get him enough to go away
  into the country. They arst me to go, an' I went&mdash;that's why I say
  relations are better apart.</p>

  <p>"The friendly lead was held in a little pub called 'The Frozen Artichoke,'
  in Camden Town, an' my brother Ern got some cards printed. 'Many can help
  one, but one can't help many,' the card sez, an' asked one an' all to rally
  round George Ropey (better known as 'Ginger'), who had recently suffered a
  severe bereftment. What they didn't put on the card, an' what they might have
  put, was: 'One can't help many, but he can help hisself.'</p>

  <p>"For they helped theirselves pretty handily to a silver watch an' chain
  that was give me by a seafarin' man in liquor.</p>

  <p>"I won't go so far as to say that any of my relations did the 'click,' but
  a few days after that my father got run for bein' in possession of a silver
  watch an' chain, an' not bein' able to give an account of where he got it
  from.</p>

  <p>"I was, in a manner of speakin', tore between love an' duty, for if I
  claimed the watch, I'd own up to my father bein' a thief; an' if I didn't,
  he'd get a month.</p>

  <p>"'Honour thy father,' sez I to myself, so I let him do the month. I'd have
  let him do six munse.</p>

  <p>"Well, to go on about my uncle with the gentlemanly manner:</p>

  <p>"About a year ago he come roun' to see me about Emma. She's a nice perky
  little girl, an' she knows just about as much as most respectable people know
  when they get to be a hundred.</p>

  <p>"'Bert,' sez my uncle, 'I've been thinkin' about Em. She's a good
  girl.'</p>

  <p>"'You've been thinkin' too deep,' I sez; 'in fact, you've been
  dreamin'!'</p>

  <p>"'She's a good girl,' he sez, very firm, 'an' she'll make some man a good
  wife.'</p>

  <p>"'I dessay,' I sez; 'it's not for me to deny miracles.'</p>

  <p>"'What do you say?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Nothin',' I sez, 'except if I happen to see a likely chap goin' cheap
  I'll buy him&mdash;there's nothin' in the monkey-house just now except the
  baby chimpanzee, an' it struck me he was feelin' lonely.'</p>

  <p>"'What do you say to yourself?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'My prayers mostly,' I sez, 'an' my private opinion of me pore
  relations.'</p>

  <p>"'Plain and plump,' sez Uncle Ropey, 'will you marry my girl?'</p>

  <p>"'Not,' I sez, 'so long as I keep from drink and am responsible for my
  actions.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, lend us a shillin',' sez my Uncle Ropey, an' we parted good
  friends&mdash;me an' the shillin'.</p>

  <p>"I didn't see him again for a week or more, an' then him an' young Ern
  came in to see me.</p>

  <p>"'Thought we'd look you up, Bert,' sez my brother. 'I don't think brothers
  ought to lose touch of each Other,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'No more do I,' I sez; 'but if you've come to touch me, it's me early
  closin' day, an' I've just paid the rent.'</p>

  <p>"Ern said he'd got a chance of makin' a couple of quid honest on a
  profitable deal, an' all he wanted was half a sovereign for stock money.</p>

  <p>"'What race does it run in?' I sez. I've lent stock money to Ern before
  now, an' seen the profitable deal stop to kick at the wrong side of the
  winnin' post. But Ern took his oath that this was real toil-and-trouble
  business, buyin' and sellin' a horse.</p>

  <p>"'I can get it for half a sovereign,' he sez; 'it belongs to a butcher who
  thinks it's got spavins.'</p>

  <p>"He was so serious about it an' told me so much about this butcher, an'
  the butcher's brother who got married to a girl down in Essex, an' what sort
  of a house the butcher lived in when he was at home, that I parted with the
  ten.</p>

  <p>"I was a bit surprised the next day, when Ern came back an' brought the
  money back in silver an' offered me a couple of shillin's interest. But I'm
  not the sort of feller to take interest from a brother, so I sold him a
  chaffinch for the two bob&mdash;it was worth two bob to a man who likes birds
  that don't sing.</p>

  <p>"A few days after that him an' Uncle Ropey came again. It 'appens they'd
  seen a kind of cart that they could buy for a pound an' sell for three
  pounds, an' would I be so kind?</p>

  <p>"I noticed that when they come the second time they stood at the door an'
  did most of their talkin', an' I had to ask 'em to come in, because I didn't
  want my shop to get a bad name.</p>

  <p>"Although this place is only a little 'un, I do a big trade, an' it's a
  poor day when I don't take a couple of pounds, an' so I had the money to hand
  over.</p>

  <p>"Next day, punctual to the minute, they brought back the money&mdash;eight
  half-crowns&mdash;an' asked me to have a drink.</p>

  <p>"Three days later I saw Ern walk past the shop very quick, an' I gave him
  a bit of a nod, an' he sort of hesitated.</p>

  <p>"He didn't come in, but stood outside.</p>

  <p>"'How's business?' sez Ern.</p>

  <p>"'So-so,' I sez; 'where's uncle?'</p>

  <p>"'He's round the comer,' sez Ern, very eager; 'he's talkin' to a man about
  a set of 'arness he wants to buy&mdash;the chap won't take less than two
  pounds, but I know where we can sell it for five.'</p>

  <p>"'Go an' see how he's got on,' I sez, an' away he nipped, an' presently
  back he come with Uncle Ropey.</p>

  <p>"'It's all right, Bert,' sez Ern; 'we can get it for two&mdash;can you
  lend us the money?'</p>

  <p>"So I fished out two sov'reigns, an' Ern had tears in his eyes when he
  took 'em.</p>

  <p>"'You're a true brother, Bert,' he sez, 'an' you've helped me to get an
  honest livin'&mdash;honesty's the best policy,' he sez; 'ain't it,
  uncle?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez Uncle Ropey. 'I've always said that Bert was the pick of the
  bunch.'</p>

  <p>"They went away tellin' me how I'd saved 'em from sinkin' to the level of
  the rest of the family.</p>

  <p>"About eleven o'clock Em come an' knocked me up.</p>

  <p>"'Father's pinched,' she sez, 'an' so's young Ern.'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'For passin' counterfeit gold,' she sez; 'two Sovereigns.'</p>

  <p>"She shook her head very disgusted.</p>

  <p>"'It's father's own fault,' she sez, 'an' it comes of not keepin' his
  word. He said he was goin' to pass all the snide money on to a
  mug&mdash;borrer a good sovereign and return eight snide half-crowns and let
  the mug do the circulatin' act.</p>

  <p>"'What surprises me,' she sez, 'is their tryin' to pass gold. Dad always
  works silver&mdash;he gets it from a man in Middlesex Street.</p>

  <p>"'Where d'ye think he got the bad quids from?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"'I dunno,' I sez; 'probably from the mug.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>4. &mdash; THE KNIGHT WHO COULD NOT KNEEL</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">DANIEL GREE was grey and old and broken.</p>

  <p>May Excels was young and beautiful. This is a bald claim, yet such a claim
  could be made with greater detail and less accuracy. Of her nose one had the
  vaguest recollection, which is as it should be. A woman whose nose one
  remembers is not beautiful. She may be pretty, piquant, and saucy, noble and
  commanding, but if you remember her nose she is not beautiful. Her eyes were
  big and lustrous, violet of hue; her hair jet black, and her eyebrows painted
  by Nature when the good lady was in her finicking miniature mood. She was so,
  I say, radiant and beautiful, and Daniel Gree was grey and old and
  broken.</p>

  <p>How dare he lift his eyes to her? As a matter of absolute fact he did not
  lift his eyes at all, for he was on the hefty side of six feet, and she was
  just the right height for a girl, which is about your size.</p>

  <p>He was grey and old and&mdash;</p>

  <p>Well, he was nearly twenty-six, and in certain lights the hair at his
  temples was almost greyish.</p>

  <p>And as for being broken, would not you be broken if you loved the daughter
  of a millionaire and she loved you, and her father, with a passion for
  titles, had his eye on the scion of a noble house as a prospective son-in-
  law?</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it, May," said Daniel Gree desperately. "I feel that if I'm
  not made a duke in a month or two I shall go really grey. I am old and
  broken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And stout? "she suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, not stout," he denied indignantly. "I am just old and grey and
  broken."</p>

  <p>"I expect that is why it is," she said thoughtfully, "father thinks the
  disparity in our ages is too great."</p>

  <p>"Why!" he gasped, "there is only five years between us. When I said
  'old,'" he went on carefully, "I was referring rather to the care-harrowed
  soul than to the arithmetical standard of years. May, what am I to do?"</p>

  <p>They were sitting on a bench in Hyde Park, and her pretty forehead was
  puckered with the tremendous character of the problem.</p>

  <p>"If you could only earn a title, Danny," she said, "I am sure father
  wouldn't mind your humble birth"&mdash; she arrested his exasperated
  protestation&mdash;"you see, dear, father was a foundryman before Mr.
  Carnegie made him a millionaire, and grandfather used to peddle laces, so
  naturally pa is rather particular. I don't think he'd mind your being the son
  of a clergyman, because he's really awfully broad-minded, but you're so
  terribly American."</p>

  <p>"My great-great-grandfather was on Washington's staff," he said, with a
  hint of gloom.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't mention that," she said gently; "not to father, anyway. One
  has to live these things down. Now, if your father had made his appearance in
  New York about the same time that the Archduke Orth
  disappeared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's he, anyway?" he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"The Archduke Orth was, or is, the relative of the Austrian Emperor," she
  recited, "who, having incurred the displeasure of his parents, sailed for a
  foreign land. It is believed by some that the ship on which he sailed was
  sunk, but authentic evidence exists that he reached American soil."</p>

  <p>Daniel Gree looked at the girl suspiciously. "Where did you learn this
  little piece?" he asked rudely, for he loved her and there was no necessity
  for conventional politeness.</p>

  <p>"Miss Zimmerberger taught me that," she said, "when I was at the Pittsbury
  Preparatory College."</p>

  <p>He was silent, then : "We Moors of old Castile&mdash;" he began
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Moors?"</p>

  <p>"Moor or less," he said gloomily, "we are descended from Christopher
  Columbus."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't a Castilian," she scorned; "he was an Italian!"</p>

  <p>His eyes met hers in pained reproach.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say 'descended'?" he asked, with exemplary patience. "Dearie,
  let us think these things out. Maisie," he said, looking down at her
  tenderly, "I've reached that stage of love where I cannot live without you. I
  know it is absurd," he went on; "I know that life will go on as heretofore
  even if you are snatched from me by the rapacious hands of Fate; that I shall
  stand on the corner and watch your wedding cortege depart for Paris without
  batting a lid&mdash;I didn't take a degree in Philosophy for nothing."</p>

  <p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

  <p>I feel the same," she said. "If papa forces me to marry that dreadful
  Baron&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Count," he corrected.</p>

  <p>"There are two," she said. "I was thinking more of the Baron because he is
  the least objectionable; besides, he does parlour tricks and can produce a
  rabbit out of a tall hat at a moment's notice. One would never be quite bored
  with him if one kept a silk hat handy, and oh! he can smash eggs in a paper
  bag and produce guinea-pigs."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" the young man nodded, "an evolutionist."</p>

  <p>"Where was I?" she went on. "Oh yes, I remember&mdash;I say, if I am
  forced to marry either, I shall be heart-broken&mdash;I am perfectly certain
  I shall do something dreadful... cry, and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Will you, really?"</p>

  <p>His voice implied doubt.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall!" she said indignantly; "do you think I am
  heartless?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply.</p>

  <p>Side by side they paced the path, patterned with shifting arabesques of
  light.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get a title?" she asked suddenly. "You can easily find one
  here in England&mdash;it would be splendid!"</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands gleefully, but awoke no responsive spark of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I'd have to become English," he said, "and it isn't so easy. Now, in
  Italy I could buy the Red of High Resolve for the price of a taxi fare."</p>

  <p>She shook her pretty head.</p>

  <p>It must be English," she said, with a definite air. "Daddy is just mad on
  real titles, and the Baron's chance would die the death before the glory of
  Sir Daniel Gree! Doesn't it sound lovely?" she demanded, with shining eyes.
  "Oh, Danny, <i>do</i> try!"</p>

  <p>They were in an unfrequented part of the Park, amidst trees that offered
  some sort of privacy. The awakening vigour of spring was in her blood, the
  bursting green of the trees, the call of the wild fowl on the little lake,
  the very wildness of life in her heart.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she raised two hands and laid them upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My boy!" she whispered, as she lifted her warm lips to his.</p>

  <p>"Mark me down as a duke," he trembled, as he left her at the Park gate,
  "and be careful of your skirt the next time you see me, for I shall be
  wearing my knightly spurs."</p>

  <p>Daniel Gree was a man with a large imagination. He was a dreamer of
  dreams, and in moments when finance did not absorb his attention (he was the
  London representative of a great American Finance Corporation) he was highly
  romantic.</p>

  <p>Now the imaginative man has a pull over all other types of men in that he
  is bound by no earthly ties and is chained to no age or clime.</p>

  <p>Picture Daniel a perfectly dressed young man, with the shiniest of silk
  hats and the best fitting of morning coats, striding along the Mall, swinging
  his ebony stick. An ordinarily pleasant-looking young man deep in thought,
  you guess, and place him in the category of thinkers who are deciding whether
  it shall be a devilled sole at Simpson's or a chop at the Charlton Grill.
  Yet, at that precise moment, Daniel has a sword strapped to his side and a
  white topee on his head.</p>

  <p>He is facing a horde of Phillipinos with flashing eyes, or rescuing a
  beautiful lady from the clutches of an Arab slaver. Or, influenced by the
  latest book he has read, he is a calm commissioner holding palaver with his
  unruly cannibals.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly certain," said Daniel to his unimaginative broker that
  morning, "that one of these days I am going to have an adventure which will
  alter the whole course of my life."</p>

  <p>"Run over by a motor bus or something?" asked Joyson.</p>

  <p>"An adventure," continued the enthusiastic Daniel, "which, in the flash of
  an eye, will change my whole status, will introduce me to another sphere of
  action, change my outlook on life, and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will," agreed the other. "I've often thought you'd get
  married sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Your views on life," said the exasperated Daniel, "are appallingly
  commonplace."</p>

  <p>"I'm a commonplace man," admitted the other placidly; "in the city we deal
  with realities&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Daniel waved him to the devil in one comprehensive gesture. It was not
  a morning for business. He dealt with two urgent letters, and an hour after
  his arrival in his office he was returning westward.</p>

  <p>A pale sun shone through the misty blue of a London sky, and the branches
  of the trees which tinged the embankment were just speckled with green. The
  flower-beds in Temple Gardens were yellow with crocus and daffodil, and there
  was in the air the electrical magic of spring, and Daniel's heart sang a wild
  barbaric song, which careless youth and healthy manhood can alike interpret,
  and which May Excels might equally have understood. The spirit carried him
  through the day; it brought in the trail of its splendour fragmentary visions
  in which he figured heroically; it enlarged his love of humanity and brought
  for him the adventure which would not come, yet which, with every passing
  moment of time, seemed the more inevitable.</p>

  <p>He was passing New Scotland Yard when a man came hurrying out.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said the stranger, disentangling himself.</p>

  <p>He was a big florid man, jovially stern of demeanour, and his attitude of
  politeness was tinctured with authority.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," said Daniel curiously, "where the devil are you going in such a
  hurry?"</p>

  <p>The stranger held out a big hand.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gree, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Gree it is," agreed the other. "Is it murder, bank robbery, or the
  activity of the Woman's Suffrage Party which hastens the laggard feet of
  law?"</p>

  <p>Detective Superintendent Mosser smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to catch 1.18 for Newbank," he said.</p>

  <p>They had met on more occasions than one, for it was part of Daniel's
  business to check the circulation of illicit bonds which were at that time in
  circulation in Europe, and such work brought him into touch with the heads of
  the police department.</p>

  <p>"And what is happening at Newbank?"</p>

  <p>The detective explained. A new hospital was to be opened by His Royal
  Highness the Prince of Midlothian. His Highness journeying down from
  Yorkshire would stop at Newbank Station, would receive an address of welcome
  on the platform from the Mayor and Corporation of Newbank, would press an
  electric button which would open the doors of the new hospital at
  Canbury&mdash;a town some five miles away.</p>

  <p>"And you will be there&mdash;how wonderful," said the admiring Daniel. "I
  suppose nothing would happen if you failed to turn up?"</p>

  <p>The genial police officer smiled. Then he groped into an inside
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"It will be interesting in a way," he said, as he pulled out a card. "I
  mean, to an American&mdash;you'll see a man knighted&mdash;the fellow that
  gave the hospital&mdash;if you'd like to see it I can give you an admission
  to the platform."</p>

  <p>"Is that a ticket?" asked Daniel quickly. "Yes&mdash; I'd like to go," he
  went on, as he grasped the pasteboard and looked awe-stricken upon its prim
  surface. "To what does this entitle me? Not to a knighthood&mdash;gee! Don't
  say it does!"</p>

  <p>"It entitles you to refreshments," said the practical servant of law. "You
  ought to catch the 2.15 to be in time&mdash;good morning."</p>

  <p>Daniel watched the departing figure, saw it suddenly stop and walk slowly
  back. There was a puzzled frown on the detective's face.</p>

  <p>"Gree?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gree," corrected Daniel reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking about you&mdash;I suppose you're not related to
  <i>the</i> Gree?"</p>

  <p>"I'm him," said Daniel, without regard to the niceties of grammar. "There
  is only one real Gree, all other Grees being spurious imitations. Look for
  the Gree label, without which none are genuine. I will injunct any
  unauthorised Gree with great severity&mdash;who is <i>the</i> Gree?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said the unsatisfying Mr. Mosser, and went off with
  rapid steps, remembering that N.W.R. expresses wait for no man.</p>

  <p>Daniel looked at the ticket, then he stole a furtive glance at a little
  portrait which he carried as near his heart as made no difference.</p>

  <p>"If I can't be a knight, at least I can learn how they are made," said he
  firmly; and after a hasty lunch he boarded the 2.15.</p>

  <p>Newbank, in the language of the local reporter, was <i>en fête</i>. It was
  <i>en fête</i> in italics and <i>en fête</i> in the black headlines of the
  <i>Newbank County Chronicle</i>.</p>

  <p>Flags were flying in the streets, and the station platform was a blaze of
  bunting and gilt-work. Flowers real and flowers so artfully artificial that
  you could not distinguish them from real unless you had paid for them were
  "displayed in lavish yet ordered confusion" (I look over the shoulder of Mr.
  Mansem, reporter-in-chief to aforesaid <i>County Chronicle</i>, and quote him
  word for word as he writes so busily in the waiting-room), and the precincts
  of the little station were alive with notable people in their most notable
  clothes.</p>

  <p>Daniel, feeling terribly commonplace amidst such magnificence, had the
  foresight to hunt up the reporter.</p>

  <p>"Say, Bud," said Daniel, dropping his hand upon the scribe's shoulder,
  "put me wise to the programme."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansem, a fierce young man in gold-mounted spectacles, glared up at
  his interrupter.</p>

  <p>"You'll find the programme in the paper." He jerked his head to an open
  sheet on the table.</p>

  <p>"Son," said Daniel gently, "before I became a degraded financier I was a
  newspaper boy&mdash;just like you; doing stunts at three cents a line, and
  never failing to describe a strawyard blaze as 'a holocaustic and terrifying
  conflagration.'"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansem looked at him with a new interest.</p>

  <p>"It's a hospital five miles away&mdash;eccentric sort of devil built
  it&mdash;there he is."</p>

  <p>The waiting-room opened out into a smaller room into which only first-
  class passengers were admitted (so said the laconic legend on the door), but
  through the glass panels of which the occupants of the common or third-class
  room might view their betters without extra charge. The smaller saloon was
  beautified by the addition of palms and flags. There was, too, a draped
  pedestal, and on that was the electric switch with which, by the pressure of
  his august finger, His Royal Highness would unseal the distant hospital.</p>

  <p>The solitary occupant of the room at that moment was a shy-looking man,
  with ragged whiskers and an antiquated frock-coat, who looked horribly ill at
  ease.</p>

  <p>"I'm about the only person here who knows him," the reporter went on. "He
  hates this business&mdash;a sort of recluse, y'know, but immensely
  wealthy."</p>

  <p>"Is he the man who is to be knighted?" asked Daniel keenly.</p>

  <p>The reporter nodded.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't want to be," he said simply; "he just told me he hates the
  idea of kneeling&mdash;he has rheumy knees or something."</p>

  <p>Didn't want to be knighted! Daniel raised his eyes to heaven. Here was a
  gentleman&mdash;for a gentleman he was, undoubtedly, despite his
  whiskers&mdash;who had an opportunity for which Daniel would have cheerfully
  paid one-half his fortune.</p>

  <p>There he stood, that impious man, with honour hovering above him and he
  didn't want&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I'm going to have a chat with him," said Daniel resolutely.</p>

  <p>The reporter looked alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Be careful; Gree is an awful bear&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Gree?"</p>

  <p>Daniel gasped.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me his name is Gree&mdash;what is his front name?"</p>

  <p>"Dan Gree," said the other.</p>

  <p>In two strides Daniel was across the room. In two more he was through the
  door and confronting the confused philanthropist.</p>

  <p>"My name is Gree," he said rapidly. "I believe we're related&mdash;one of
  my ancestors emigrated to England at the time of the <i>Mayflower</i>; he
  didn't want to be mixed up with the Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;how are you?"</p>

  <p>He shook hands desperately with elder Gree; he talked him silent, giving
  his namesake no chance to disclaim relationship. The antiquated Mr. Gree
  found himself on terms of confidence before he realised that he had even met
  this pushful stranger.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could get out of it," he said, apropos of the coming trial. "I
  can't tell you how horrible I feel; I hate crowds.... I think I shall
  faint... when he comes. Besides, I can't kneel"&mdash;he rubbed his knees
  aggressively&mdash;"I've got a twinge of rheumatism and I shall look a
  fool&mdash;oh, confound it!"</p>

  <p>"Remember," said Daniel solemnly, "that your cousin is by you to help you
  up&mdash;and if you only introduce me to His Royal Highness, I shall ask no
  other reward for my service."</p>

  <p>From outside came the far-away "bang!" of fog signal. In this simple and
  inexpensive manner did Newbank salvo royalty.</p>

  <p>"My heaven!" said old Gree fretfully, "here comes that damned train!"</p>

  <p>He looked round hopelessly for some means of escape. There was a door
  giving way to the station courtyard and the key was in the lock.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it!" wailed the recluse. "I didn't expect this when I built
  the infernal hospital. I can't kneel&mdash;and I won't kneel!"</p>

  <p>He tried the door furtively, snapped back the lock, and peered cautiously
  forth. The courtyard was deserted, for the public had chosen places of
  vantage where they might secure a better view of majesty.</p>

  <p>His Royal Highness, a tall, agreeable young man, stepped out from his
  saloon and listened with the utmost gravity whilst an agitated town clerk
  read an address of welcome, which clearly indicated that Newbank was one of
  the loyalest, true-heartedest, and most noble township on the Red Map; that
  the coming of His Royal Highness was something in the nature of a phenomenon,
  which would at once place Newbank in the forefront of the world's cities, and
  solidify that empire upon which the sun never sets if it can possibly avoid
  the necessity.</p>

  <p>His Royal Highness expressed the extraordinary pleasure it gave him to
  step out of his saloon and meet the bald-headed representative of a free and
  enlightened borough. He didn't say so in as many words, but be probably
  thought as much.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry we are late, Mr. Mayor," he said, as, entirely surrounded by
  the municipality, he made his way along the platform. "Mr. Gree is here, I
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"I am told so, Your Royal Highness," twittered the mayor; "but... very shy
  man... this is the saloon, Your Royal Highness. . . "</p>

  <p>"It is a pity I cannot visit Newbank," said the Prince; "but the train is
  late... is this the electric button? Thank you... "&mdash;he laid his hand on
  the switch&mdash;"I have pleasure in dedicating the Gree Hospital to the
  service of humanity, and I declare the hospital to be open."</p>

  <p>He pressed the button and simultaneously the thunder of guns on Newbank
  Common announced the completion of the ceremony.</p>

  <p>The Prince looked round with a smile and beckoned his plumed aide-de-
  camp.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gree?" he asked inquiringly, and a dozen voices whispered urgently,
  "Mr. Gree!"</p>

  <p>A young man, rather pale, but immensely self-possessed, pushed his way to
  the front. A chief reporter and a certain Detective Superintendent who saw
  him stood hypnotised into inaction at the sight.</p>

  <p>"Will you kneel, please?" smiled the Prince.</p>

  <p>Daniel sank on one knee upon the velvet cushion that had been thoughtfully
  placed for the purpose. A sword glittered over his head, the damasked blade
  touched his two shoulders lightly.</p>

  <p>"Rise up, Sir Daniel Gree," said His Royal Highness.</p>

  <p>He shook hands with the new knight, uttered a few pleasant things, and
  made his way back to his saloon, leaving Detective Mosser staring helplessly
  at the pale but triumphant young man.</p>

  <p>"Gree!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Sir Daniel&mdash;if you please," said the new knight sternly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"The strange error by which the wrong Mr. Gree was
  knighted," said the <i>Newbank County Chronicle</i>, "has been rectified by
  the bestowal of a baronetcy Upon the founder of the Gree Cottage Hospital.
  The accolade, having once been given, is irrevocable, and the younger Sir
  Daniel Gree is free to enjoy the title of Knight Bachelor."</p>

  <p>Daniel read this with infinite scorn. "Knight Bachelor, indeed!" he said;
  "we'll show 'em!"</p>

  <p>He was speaking to the future Lady Gree, under the approving eyes of her
  father.</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>5. &mdash; HER FATHER'S DAUGHTER</h2>

  <h3>First published as "A Girl Among Thieves," <i>Nash's Illustrated
  Weekly</i>, January 17, 1920</h3>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">IN the old days, the Howarths and the Mandrilios "worked"
  Europe independently of one another, and Tony Mandrillo would have laughed at
  the suggestion of co-operation between the rival "firms."</p>

  <p>A sordid phrase this to describe the operations of world-famous robber
  barons who descended from their fastnesses at irregular intervals and passed
  through Europe, from Lisbon to Bukharest, leaving behind them a trail of
  "smashed" banks and police theories.</p>

  <p>Yet in some respects the illustration of two rival commanders would more
  nearly describe the relationships between Teak Howarth and Antonio Mandrillo.
  Portuguese Joe could stand for a liaison officer known to them both, yet,
  strictly speaking, under the command of neither.</p>

  <p>The difference between Tony Mandrillo and "Teak" Howarth was the
  difference between the general and the guerilla leader. Tony planned his
  raids years in advance, worked out every detail of the robberies he
  contemplated, so that he knew to a minute where he would be on any given day.
  "Teak" Howarth usually came unexpectedly from somewhere in the south (it was
  generally conceded that he was an Australian) and made his plans as
  opportunity offered.</p>

  <p>The war had seriously interfered with the operations of both gangs.
  Mandrillo had kicked his heels in Brazil during the period of the conflict.
  Teak had kicked the heels of the enemy, having been successively private,
  sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and private again of Australian infantry. The
  startling reduction from captain to private is explained by the fact that
  Teak as a captain fell foul of a certain provost-marshal and was dismissed
  with ignominy from the service. This despite certain great happenings which
  brought honour to Sergeant T. Howarth, A.I.F.</p>

  <p>He enlisted again in another battalion, and was in line for promotion when
  the war ended. And when the war ended, Teak left his battalion without so
  much as "by your leave," and actually spent Armistice Night in Paris, having
  reached that capital by the first available train.</p>

  <p>He was technically a deserter, but such matters did not interest him. He
  was on his way south to meet "Boobu" Clark and another amiable partner who
  had been waiting in Oporto cursing the war (at least Boobu had been) and
  every other circumstance which interfered with the opening of a certain bank
  strong- room, the plans of which had been passed and approved by Teak on his
  last leave, when he and Boobu met under the auspices of the Young Men's
  Christian Association and completed the final details.</p>

  <p>It was an unhappy circumstance that Tony Mandrillo had also marked down
  that bank, being in possession of certain facts concerning its weakness, the
  habits of its manager, and such-like. Had Portuguese Joe been in Europe, he
  would have exchanged confidences with Teak, and the matter could have been
  amicably arranged; but Portuguese Joe was back in Rio, sick unto death. And,
  moreover, Portuguese Joe had warned both Mandrillo and Teak Howarth that the
  Banco Commerciale was a nut that would never be cracked.</p>

  <p>The first that Tony Mandrillo knew of Teak's presence was revealed to him
  in a special edition of the <i>Corresondentia</i>, the front page of which
  was suffering from a very bad attack of typographical hysteria.</p>

  <p>Mandrillo read the news in his comfortably appointed sitting-room at the
  Briganza Hotel, and forthwith summoned his principal lieutenant. His
  annoyance was justified, because his raid on Europe had barely paid expenses
  and would certainly show a deficit when the cost of the <i>Pealigo</i> came
  to be added to the profit-and-loss account.</p>

  <p>From his room at the Briganza he could see the <i>Pealigo</i> lying at
  anchor in the Tagus, a trim steam-yacht of 600 tons. And at the sight of it
  he passed into a mild condition of irritation. He was a pleasant-looking,
  broad- shouldered man with a slight moustache and suspicions of a growing
  beard&mdash;you might take him as a type of a successful Portuguese merchant
  with Anglophile tastes.</p>

  <p>He puffed at the short brier which he held between his strong, white
  teeth, and thought hard. He was not blaming Teak Howarth. At the same time he
  was not prepared wholly to exonerate him. He felt rather that the blame was
  his own, but that admission did not make him feel any more kindly towards his
  competitor.</p>

  <p>Silva, his dapper assistant, came in quickly, closing the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked in English&mdash;it was one of Mandrillo's affectations
  that he spoke no other language.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the newspapers?" asked the chief shortly.</p>

  <p>"I've glanced at them. Who did it?"</p>

  <p>Mandrillo grunted.</p>

  <p>"Teak," he said. "Who else? Nobody but Teak would work that way. If he
  left his name and address on the safe you couldn't be more certain that it
  was he. Look at the account of it! The watchman gassed&mdash;Teak used to use
  ammonia before the war. The front of the safe burnt out&mdash;all the work
  done on Sunday afternoon&mdash;that's Teak's method all over."</p>

  <p>"Did he take much?" asked the interested Pedro Silva.</p>

  <p>"More than I thought was there," said the other gloomily. "About £100,000,
  mostly in American gold certificates. The Banco Commerciale held this stock
  as part of its reserve."</p>

  <p>Silva sat by the table and drummed his fingers thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, that settles that," he said. "The best thing we can do is to get
  away. When is the girl due?"</p>

  <p>"She went on board this morning."</p>

  <p>Silva looked at his compatriot oddly.</p>

  <p>"She took some persuading," Mandrillo went on; "but I guess she's tired of
  sitting in a Lisbon <i>pension</i>. Anyway, she's going."</p>

  <p>"What is the idea&mdash;about the girl?" asked the other, and Mandrillo
  shrugged away the question.</p>

  <p>"Have you told her her father is dead?" persisted Silva.</p>

  <p>It was not a discreet moment to cross-examine Mandrillo, as Silva was to
  discover. The big man had a tongue that stung, a vocabulary that was both
  extensive and vitriolic.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Silva easily, when he had finished. "Maybe she
  knows, for she's a clever girl&mdash; only I was pretty fond of Joe, and I
  don't like to feel that his daughter is running any extra risk."</p>

  <p>"The matter does not concern you," said Mandrillo. "The only thing you
  need worry about is that this swine Teak Howarth has galvanised the police
  department into life, and they'll be sneaking round here, making
  inquiries."</p>

  <p>"Damn the Portuguese, anyway!" said Silva cheerfully. He had the true
  Brazilian's contempt for the mother-country. "Our own loot is on board, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Loot?" sneered Mandrilo. "Such as it is!"</p>

  <p>He went walking that afternoon and was duly pointed out by the loafers on
  the Grand Square as the rich Brazilian who came occasionally to Lisbon; a man
  of unnumbered millions whose wealth rivalled that of the late Administrator
  of the Tobacco Monopoly&mdash;the Portuguese equivalent for Croesus&mdash;as
  he progressed towards the Alemida.</p>

  <p><i>En route</i> he called at the police office, because the chief of the
  police was known to him. It was Mandrillo's practice to know chiefs of
  police, who, as a rule, are most communicative persons. This time the chief
  was not in his usual cheery mood. He was depressed to the depths, and his
  hands, which usually flickered so expressively, rested on a desk which was
  covered with documents.</p>

  <p>"There has been a great tragedy," he explained to Mandrillo. "Ah, these
  foreign anarchists!"</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong?" asked the Brazilian innocently.</p>

  <p>"The Banco Commerciale was robbed last night of millions!" wailed the
  policeman. "By a stranger, an <i>estranjero</i>, you understand. Everybody in
  Lisbon is suspect&mdash;everybody!"</p>

  <p>He looked significantly at the Brazilian millionaire.</p>

  <p>"Nobody must leave, either by train or by boat, until we have discovered
  the paltry-minded villain who abused our hospitality."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it was an <i>estranjero</i>?" asked Mandrillo, who was
  interested.</p>

  <p>"Because he left behind him tools of foreign make," said the chief of
  police curtly. "This is a tragedy for me, my friend. To-day the Minister of
  the Interior has called for my resignation."</p>

  <p>He wept noisily.</p>

  <p>Mandrillo continued his stroll to the Alemida, where all that was
  fashionable in Lisbon promenaded or took the air at this hour. He sat down on
  one of the benches and surveyed the passing stream of fashion. He was not
  interested, either in local beauties or in local opulence, and was impressed
  by neither. He was interested in a slim young man who wore a Stetson hat and
  a striped shirt, and who, lolling back in a victoria, smoked a long cigar
  with the air of one who was at peace with the world.</p>

  <p>Mandrillo saw him coming and turned to the edge of the broad sidewalk,
  lifting his finger with an almost imperceptible gesture. The young man
  stopped the <i>cocher</i> and bent forward with a flashing smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, if it isn't my old friend Mandrillo!" he said. "Welcome to
  Lisbon!"</p>

  <p>He edged aside to make room for his guest, and Mandrillo stepped into the
  victoria. The hard-faced Australian positively beamed upon the other.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing all these years, Tony?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Cut out all that polite stuff," said Tony Mandrillo. "There's going to be
  bad trouble for you, Teak."</p>

  <p>The other sucked at his cigar and did not immediately reply.</p>

  <p>"Where is Boobu Clark?" asked Mandrillo unnecessarily, since the weeping
  chief of police had told him.</p>

  <p>"Dead," replied Teak Howarth shortly; "the watchman shot him."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" began Mandrillo.</p>

  <p>"They'll find the body all right," replied the other, grimly anticipating
  the question. "I locked it in one of the safes. All the keys were in the
  strong-room. You know the Portuguese method?"</p>

  <p>Mandrillo nodded.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, they found the body this morning."</p>

  <p>"It is rather awkward," said Teak, scratching his chin. "Boobu had all the
  plans to get away. This is foreign land to me. Have you got your yacht here?
  Of course you have."</p>

  <p>Mandrillo nodded, and waited.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Teak Howarth, after a while. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Mandrillo squared round at him.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you straight, Teak," he said. "I'm willing to get you out, but
  you've got to pay me Boobu Clark's share."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Teak, after consideration. "I'll promise
  anything. I'm mighty keen on getting away."</p>

  <p>It wanted more doing than Mandrillo had imagined, and it was five days
  before the <i>Pealigo</i> steamed past the batteries at the mouth of the
  Tagus and set her nose for the shining west.</p>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">"Will you tell me, please, what is that land?"</p>

  <p>Teak Howarth turned as if shot. He stared down into the brown eyes
  upturned to him, and lugged off his hat.</p>

  <p>The girl laughed musically at his surprise.</p>

  <p>"You didn't expect to see me?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth," said Teak, "I didn't."</p>

  <p>"And you don't know me?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got a glimmer of an idea I've met you before," he said, "but when,
  where, or how, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"I was a little girl," she said, "and I saw you at our house in Rio."</p>

  <p>"I've got you," he cried quickly.</p>

  <p>"You're the daughter of Portuguese Joe!"</p>

  <p>She nodded, still smiling.</p>

  <p>"Why, you've grown out of all knowledge," he said, "and your English is
  quite perfect. Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>"I've been to a school in England," she said, "and then I was in a convent
  in France. And now&mdash;why, now I'm going to Rio!"</p>

  <p>She was prettier than he could ever have expected the dark-skinned little
  child he knew to be. She had slipped from childhood to womanhood at an age
  when most English girls are at their gawkiest.</p>

  <p>She prattled on, and Teak listened, a thoughtful look on his face. She was
  taking some wonderful mantillas back to Brazil with her. Would Senhor Howart'
  see them some day, and if the ship was wrecked, would he help save these?...
  Teak grinned.</p>

  <p>Women made little appeal to Teak, who held that no man can live two
  crooked lives at once and be a success at either. He listened with an odd
  little pain at his heart as the girl talked of her father and his business
  successes. Did she know that the name of Portuguese Joe was inscribed in
  every police record in Europe, or that the five years he was absent from
  Brazil on urgent business in Europe were passed on the bleak downs of
  Dartmoor?</p>

  <p>He questioned her as to her friends in Brazil and her relations in that
  country. Apparently she had had nobody but her father, and Teak Howarth was
  more worried than ever.</p>

  <p>That afternoon there was a little gathering under the awning on the
  diminutive quarter-deck of the yacht. Tony Mandrillo occupied the place of
  honour. Ferrera, the Dago skipper, who was captain aboard and confederate
  ashore; Soper, Mandrillo's Scottish engineer, steeped in sin; Pedro Silva,
  and Teak Howarth&mdash;this was the party.</p>

  <p>The <i>Pealigo</i> was one day, out of Dakka, where the boat had called to
  coal. The sea was like oil, the cloudless sky a bowl of hot blue, and there
  was scarcely a breath of air. All the conditions were against a pleasant
  ending to the inquisition which Teak in his masterful way, and in face of
  Silva's warning glances, had initiated.</p>

  <p>Mandrillo pulled at his pipe and listened in silence.</p>

  <p>"No," he said at last, knocking out the ashes and speaking with great
  deliberation, "she doesn't know that her father is dead, and what's more, I
  am not going to tell her."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward little silence.</p>

  <p>"But what is the general idea?" asked Teak. "She was safe enough in
  Portugal or in England. Joe had a balance at the Bank of Lyons, and so far as
  I can find she hasn't a friend in the whole of South America. Why are you
  taking her out?"</p>

  <p>Mandrillo refilled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"On this ship," he said slowly, "nobody says 'why?' or 'wherefore?' to
  me."</p>

  <p>Teak Howarth leaned back in his cane chair and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Little God A'mighty!" he said, and made no attempt to keep the contempt
  out of his voice. "All that pirate king talk never did interest me, Tony.
  What are you going to do with the girl?"</p>

  <p>Another awkward pause, then:</p>

  <p>"I am sending her to the Villa Francisca," he said shortly, and Teak
  whistled.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had not been interested in the manner in which Tony Mandrillo
  occupied his leisure hours. He was neither prude nor moralist, and had never
  regarded the notorious country estate of Senhor Mandrillo in any other light
  than a likely cause for the Brazilian's ultimate downfall. For all men in
  this crooked game know that the clever ones are undone by women and
  fools.</p>

  <p>But now&mdash;it was different. This girl with the brown eyes was entitled
  as by an inheritance to the protection and the loyalty of the pack which ran
  with her father.</p>

  <p>"Villa Francisca," he said slowly. "That doesn't seem right to me, Tony.
  I've never run in with your gang, and I've always heard you spoken of as a
  high-class lot, and Portuguese Joe was running with you, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>He looked first at Mandrillo, who stared back, and then at Pedro Silva,
  who shifted uncomfortably and did not meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Put that little girl ashore, Tony," he said gently. "I've offered to
  share fifty-fifty, but you can make it sixty-forty with the sixty in your own
  favour. Let her go back to Portugal or England, or wherever her school
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mandrillo interrupted him by rising.</p>

  <p>"We're going to Rio, Teak," he said, "and you be very glad that you're
  getting your fifty-fifty."</p>

  <p>The menace in his tone was unmistakable, but Teak laughed. A few minutes
  later he went down to the hot little cabin that had been apportioned him, and
  bolted the door before he drew his suitcase from beneath the bunk and opened
  it.</p>

  <p>Teak looked for a long time, then closed the box, relocked it, and pushed
  it back beneath the bunk. Then he sat down and considered the position. The
  two long barrelled revolvers and the cartridge belt and the Colt automatic
  which he had put on the top of the money had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Presently he went out of the cabin and went in search of Mandrillo; and
  Tony evidently expected him, for his first words were:</p>

  <p>"There'll be no gun play on this ship, Teak; we're going to Rio, and
  there's nothing on the earth or on the sea that can put us back. Do you
  understand that?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Teak.</p>

  <p>"And the girl goes too," Tony went on; "and if it comes to a rough house,
  it'll be worse for you and worse for her."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Teak, and Mandrillo smiled.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're thinking out some way of inducing me to go back to the
  last port," he said. "You've got a reputation for ingenuity, Teak, but the
  scheme isn't discovered that will make me put back."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," said Teak, who did not fail to observe that Mandrillo was
  armed. "But I'm giving you this little bit of information to go on with. I
  did not take a red cent from the Banco Commerciale."</p>

  <p>Mandrillo gaped at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"You didn't get a red cent?" he replied incredulously. "You're lying! You
  are trying to kid me to get back to the coast to put you off."</p>

  <p>Teak chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's your ship," he drawled. "You can search my cabin, and if you
  find more than ten dollars set, you are welcome to it. I haven't even got my
  beautiful guns," he added whimsically.</p>

  <p>"But you said you'd give me fifty-fifty!"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," said the other coolly. "That works out at about five
  dollars. I didn't say I robbed the bank. You said that. I didn't tell you
  anything except that Boobu Clark was killed."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you mean?" demanded Mandrillo. "What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>Teak rolled his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other.</p>

  <p>"It means that somebody was there before me. Honest, Tony, I thought it
  was you."</p>

  <p>The other looked at him searchingly, but Teak's eyes did not flinch.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mandrillo slowly, "there will be plenty of time to
  investigate this matter before we get to Rio."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," pleaded Teak, "I should greatly appreciate the loan of
  one small gun."</p>

  <p>Mandrillo laughed unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>Teak saw no more of the girl and, apparently, it was only by accident that
  he had seen her at all, for she was kept almost a prisoner in her cabin. That
  night he crept from his bunk on a foraging expedition, and was challenged at
  the end of the alleyway by one of the Portuguese deck-hands. Mandrillo was
  taking no risks.</p>

  <p>The next morning he greeted Tony with a sunny smile.</p>

  <p>"You've won, Tony," he said.</p>

  <p>Tony looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"This'll be a pleasant voyage for you, Teak, if you behave yourself," he
  said. "You invited yourself on board this ship. Nobody asked you to come. Get
  it into your head that I'm the only boss here and what I say goes, and we'll
  talk real business&mdash;which is money."</p>

  <p>This conversation took place on the little navigating bridge, and Ferrera,
  a smile on his pendulous face, was the audience.</p>

  <p>"It's not a bad little packet," said Teak Howarth. "You've got her up
  regardless, Tony."</p>

  <p>Tony nodded, pleased. He had spent a great deal of money on the
  <i>Pealigo</i>, and she was one of the fastest of her class. Teak stared into
  the binnacle, watching the compass dial turn slowly from side to side.</p>

  <p>"What happens," he asked, "suppose your compass goes wrong? Have you a
  means of checking it? I read in the paper the other day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He told a long and not too convincing story of a ship that had gone on the
  rocks, but Mandrillo saw nothing in this sudden interest beyond a desire to
  make conversation.</p>

  <p>"Ferrera has another compass, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>Captain Ferrera nodded.</p>

  <p>"But how do you test your compass?" asked Teak curiously.</p>

  <p>Ferrera explained at length. He was a good seaman and a born navigator. To
  illustrate his lecture on the art of compass-testing he disappeared into his
  little wheel-house and came out in a moment with a small square case of
  boxwood, which he opened, disclosing a second compass.</p>

  <p>Teak took it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Are these all the compasses you have on the ship?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ferrera grinned.</p>

  <p>"That is all that is necessary, Senhor Howarth." And then be stared at the
  other open-mouthed, for Teak, with a twist of his wrist, had flung the
  compass into the sea. Then, before he could realise what was happening,
  before Mandrillo could pull the gun from his pocket, Teak had lifted an iron
  pin from the rail and had sent its point smashing through the face of the
  binnacle into the compass bed.</p>

  <p>Twice, three times he thrust, and then Mandrillo, purple in the face, had
  his gun in position, and Teak's hands went up.</p>

  <p>"You're a hell of a navigator, Ferrera," he said. "Get to Rio without a
  compass, will you?"</p>

  <p>They pushed Teak Howarth back into his cabin, and the method of the men
  who handled him was not gentle. Then followed a council of war, and curiously
  enough it was old man Soper whose advice was followed.</p>

  <p>"If ye shoot him there's going to be trouble, and if he goes over the side
  one night there's going to be trouble," he said. "These deck-hands of yours
  are bound to talk, Tony, and I'm not going into the collar for you or twenty
  like you. Keep him in his cabin and starve him sick. By the time we reach
  Rio&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the time we reach Rio?" sneered Tony. "How are we going to get to
  Rio?"</p>

  <p>"Get back to the coast," said the old man. "We can navigate down to
  Benguela without a compass by keeping the coastline in sight. Or better
  still, I know a creek south of St. Paul de Loanda that's got thirty fathoms
  of water. It's as good as Lobito Bay but not so healthy. We could put the
  ship in there and send overland to St. Paul for new compasses. You can buy
  all you want there in the ship chandler line."</p>

  <p>"Why not go into St. Paul?" asked Ferrera, troubled. "I do not like these
  African creeks."</p>

  <p>"Ain't I telling you that this is the same as Lobito?" nodded old Soper.
  "Thirty fathoms of water, and you can bring the ship right alongside the
  spit. Go into St. Paul and you'll be overrun with consuls and port
  officials."</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Silva put his head into the door of the
  captain's cabin, where the conference was being held.</p>

  <p>"There's a sort of red fog on the sea behind us, and the wind seems to be
  blowing all ways at once, Ferrera. What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>Ferrera's yellow face went green.</p>

  <p>"Mother of God!" he breathed. "That! And without a compass..."</p>

  <p>Mandrillo leapt to his feet with a roar.</p>

  <p>"I'll settle with Teak!" he shouted, and as he spoke the <i>Pealigo</i>
  lay over gently on her side as though she were tired.</p>

  <p>Mandrillo never got nearer to Teak than his own cabin, where he lashed
  himself to his bunk. For thirty-six hours the <i>Pealigo</i> dipped and
  bucked and pirouetted dizzily in the very vortex of one of those rare red
  storms which are born in the primeval forests of the African tableland and
  shriek down a hundred ravines, finally uniting their furies in far-off
  seas.</p>

  <p>At the fifty-ninth minute of the thirty-sixth hour the <i>Pealigo</i> took
  a harder knock than any, and a haggard Ferrera, lashed to his wheel-house
  stanchions, saw beneath the tumbling clouds, scarcely palm-high, the lather
  of white breakers upon a shore...</p>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">Mandrillo reached dry land, or land which was dry an hour
  after the wind dropped and the sun shone out, his sole possessions consisting
  of a pair of duck trousers and belt, and a packet of cigarettes which were in
  a waterproof cover in the trousers pocket. Therein he was so many cigarettes
  ahead of Teak, though he was one knife to the bad.</p>

  <p>All that was left of the <i>Pealigo</i> littered the beach. Silva and old
  man Soper, the remnants of the ship's company, had gone with a providential
  native guide on an eighty-mile trip along the coast to the nearest white
  man's town.</p>

  <p>They sat opposite to one another, and between them smouldered a small fire
  which the natives had lit for them. Mandrillo was smoking, and he was
  amazingly polite.</p>

  <p>"That's the end of the adventure, Senhor Howarth," he said, flicking off
  the ash of his cigarette, "and I hope you like it."</p>

  <p>Teak laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"There have been worse ends," he said. "I remember after we cleared the
  Bank of Borneo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. Mandrillo's eyes were staring past him and upward, and those
  eyes held a certain savage hunger which the Australian had seen before.</p>

  <p>The girl was standing by a palm, looking disconsolately out to sea. They
  had found her a hut on a little hillock, and it had been Teak who bargained
  for the gay shawl that now covered shoulders which had been wholly bare when
  he dragged her through the surf. She might have drowned, for she had clung to
  her infernal box of mantillas to the last. (Teak had not remembered the
  mantillas until after he had ravished the shawl.)</p>

  <p>He turned his head back to the man, and there was danger in the cold grey
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Tony," he said, "you know just where I stand about money, but give me
  twelve months and I will pay you your share and the cost of your yacht."</p>

  <p>Mandrillo smiled and pulled at his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"If you had left us one compass, Ferrera could have got away," he said
  softly. "I don't understand you, Teak. I have worked with you and against
  you, and I have never seen this mushy side of you before. I think something
  must have happened in the war." His eyes were watching the other, and he saw
  Teak shift uneasily. "Something must have happened in the war," he went on,
  "to put ideas into your head. Five years ago you'd have sold the girl for a
  bunch of gold pesos. There's a reason for all this gallant old knight
  stuff."</p>

  <p>Suddenly his face became fixed and he stared at Teak.</p>

  <p>"I remember. They made you something. I remember seeing your portrait in
  one of the London papers when I was in Brazil. That's how I knew you were in
  France. Sergeant T. Howarth, V.C. Now what in hell is 'V.C.'? Virtuous
  Crook?"</p>

  <p>He dodged the straight blow that the white-faced man aimed at him, ducked
  in under his guard, and with one swift jerk snatched the knife from the
  other's belt. For a moment they swayed, locked together, breast to breast,
  the muscles on their backs rippling like the muscles of two great Andalusian
  bulls. Twice Mandrillo struck and twice missed, and then the watching natives
  saw the blade fly from the hand of Tony Mandrillo.</p>

  <p>Swiftly down the little declivity came the daughter of Portuguese Joe,
  with set face and wide eyes. She circled the struggling men until she came to
  the place where the haft of the knife stuck up from the sand.</p>

  <p>She plucked it forth and stood for a moment hesitating, then she slipped a
  carefully calculated half-inch of the point between Mandrillo's ribs and he
  wrenched back with a yell.</p>

  <p>"Let up," she said tersely. "Haven't you had enough fighting and
  wrecking?"</p>

  <p>She bent reproachful eyes upon Teak, and for the first time he saw that
  they held real and genuine laughter.</p>

  <p>"You are very nice, Senhor Howart'," she said, "and I know my youth and
  innocence have appealed to you, and Senhor Mandrillo is a very wicked man.
  But you are both wrong. I know my poor father is dead. He was dying when I
  left Rio six months ago. He sent for me to give me his blessing and&mdash;the
  plan of the Banco Commerciale. May he rest in peace!" She crossed herself.
  "It was a very good plan. I was in the bank before you"&mdash;she nodded to
  the dumb-stricken Teak&mdash;"and I was only worried because I was not sure
  how I could get away. I don't think I should have got away at all, only
  Senhor Mandrillo was so wicked&mdash;wicked. There is a beautiful little box
  in my cabin," she said. "Do you remember my mantillas?" She turned her
  laughing eyes to Teak. "It floated," she said. "I spent all last night
  putting lifebelts round it. It was very wrong of you"&mdash;she shook her
  head sadly&mdash;"very wrong of you, Mr. Howart'. You nearly lost me that,
  and lost your share and Tony's share. Wait, I will show you."</p>

  <p>She turned and ran lightly up the little sandy hillock, and the eyes of
  Teak Howarth and Tony Mandrillo met.</p>

  <p>"Portuguese Joe always said&mdash;" began Teak.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;that that bank couldn't be cracked," finished Tony, and they both
  shook their heads.</p>

  <p>"Joe was a rare fellow for keeping things in his family!" said Teak.</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>6. &mdash; THE DRAMATIC BUTLER</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN Barbara Long called at No. 704 Avenue Road, which is on
  the fringe of Regent's Park, she had no other idea in her head than to escape
  the drudgery of office work, and secure a secretaryship which would give her
  sufficient leisure to follow her art course, and supply her with a modest
  salary that would eke out an even more modest income from her dead father's
  estate.</p>

  <p>No. 704 Avenue Road was a substantially built, if small, house, designed
  in the pleasing style which came into favour in the late Victorian period. It
  had its tiny garage, which, she subsequently learnt, was solely occupied by
  the butler's motor-cycle and side-car. The windows were specklessly
  curtained, and the garden was bright with sulphur-coloured chrysanthemums the
  day Barbara called.</p>

  <p>A popular work of reference told her that Mr. Harbord Brownwill was a
  lawyer, that his age was seventy-five, and that his recreations were none. He
  was a member of no clubs, and he had either no heir or his property, being of
  the portable kind, was not, in the opinion of his biographer, of sufficient
  importance to justify the inclusion of heirship into the brief history of
  him.</p>

  <p>She rang the bell and met, for the first time, Mr. Jennings, the butler. A
  man in the irreproachable livery of his trade, middle-aged, melancholy,
  eminently respectable. Later she was to meet that thin and vinegary woman his
  wife, and Mr. Brownwill's house-keeper and nurse.</p>

  <p>"The job?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her dubiously, scratched his chin, gazed vaguely past her to
  the trim box hedge that ran parallel with the garden wall.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss&mdash;will you come in?"</p>

  <p>He ushered her into a drawing-room that was furnished with some luxury.
  And only then did he ask her name, and brightened visibly when she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"That's the name!" he nodded. "Mr. Brownwill said, 'Take her on&mdash;if
  she's agreeable.' Wait a minute, miss; I'll see him."</p>

  <p>She gathered that Mr. Brownwill, because of his age and eccentricities,
  was not visible, and waited until the soft thud of the butler's feet came to
  her from the floor above. Listening, she heard the rumble of voices, and
  presently he came back.</p>

  <p>"Five pounds a week&mdash;hours, ten till three?" he asked rather than
  stated.</p>

  <p>And there and then began Barbara Long's acquaintance with the House with
  the Dramatic Butler.</p>

  <p>That he had dramatic tendencies she learnt right away, but she had to wait
  some months before The Man on the Bus came into her life and she witnessed
  Mr. Jennings' star performance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jennings had three rooms at the top of No. 704 Avenue Road, and the
  walls of these apartments advertised the one interest he shared in common
  with his painfully silent wife. For they were devotees of the drama and great
  admirers of the acting profession.</p>

  <p>He showed the photographs to Barbara then and subsequently.</p>

  <p>'"They're art, and, in a manner of speaking, they're class," said Mr.
  Jennings soberly. "It's a bit melancholy livin' in the same house as an
  invalid, and they sort of take you out of yourself."</p>

  <p>That Mr. Brownwill was something of a trial, Barbara came to know. She had
  never been inside the room where be lay ("grouchin' an' cursin' something
  fierce," said the mournful Mr. Jennings), and only his vinegary wife and
  himself had any association with him.</p>

  <p>"He's nearly eighty an' worries my life out," said the butler. "He won't
  have a doctor, he's got no lawyer an' no relations except a grandson&mdash;a
  wild feller... I don't know a wilder. I've never seen him, but Mr. Brownwill
  often talks about him."</p>

  <p>Only once had Mr. Brownwill spoken to her. There was a house telephone
  connecting the rooms, and she was in the midst of copying an interminable
  lease when the bell rang and a harsh voice asked her to "send that woman
  Jennings to me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Brownwill," she answered, guessing the identity of the
  caller.</p>

  <p>"Are you Miss Long?" growled the voice, and, when she had answered:
  "Humph! Got all you want?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

  <p>That was all: the receiver was hung up and never again was she called.</p>

  <p>Her work was light. A business letter or two, the substance of which was
  conveyed to her by Mr. Jennings, the finished copy being taken away for
  signature by Mr. Jennings and posted by him; an enormous number of old deeds
  to copy, and a weekly visit to a city bank to cash a cheque, comprised her
  duties. She never saw the interior working of the establishment. There was a
  housemaid, who had some secret trouble, for her eyes always seemed red from
  weeping, and once she arrived to see a hired charwoman departing. But the
  housework was finished before she came in the mornings, and the establishment
  seemed to run very smoothly without a very large staff.</p>

  <p>She had been in her position six months, and the first green was showing
  on the limes in the garden one morning when Mr. Jennings came in, as was his
  custom, to bid her good morning and give her the letters that were to be
  answered.</p>

  <p>His task completed, Mr. Jennings lingered at the door of the little
  library and looked pathetically at the girl, who was feeding a sheet of paper
  into her typewriter.</p>

  <p>Barbara had not known many butlers, but she was satisfied that Mr.
  Jennings was as near being the ideal family retainer as she was likely to
  meet.</p>

  <p>"Let him have those letters as soon as you can, miss&mdash;he's a bit
  tryin' this mornin'."</p>

  <p>He sighed heavily and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Short-tempered&mdash;invalids get that way. An' the language! For an old
  gentleman he's wonderful! Did you write to Miss Alma Devinne, miss?"</p>

  <p>Barbara Long smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Jennings. She telephoned me yesterday. She is having some new
  photographs taken and will send you one."</p>

  <p>He nodded, his sad face lighting.</p>

  <p>"That will be a hundred and forty-two," he said proudly. "I don't suppose
  there's a better collection in London. I'd have been in the profession if I'd
  had my way. So would Mrs. Jennings."</p>

  <p>Barbara kept a straight face. The mental picture of Mrs. Jennings on the
  stage was not without its humour.</p>

  <p>"I saw <i>Twisted Lives</i> last night," he went on. "What a play! That
  bit where the young gel accuses her uncle of murder...! And the scene where
  Rudolph gripples Ernest and flings him down the well&mdash;wonderful! Mrs.
  Jennings is seeing it to-night."</p>

  <p>"Gripples" was a new verb to Barbara.</p>

  <p>"You like melodrama, Mr. Jennings?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Love it," he said, with an ecstatic sigh. "Makes you think&mdash;puts
  ideas in your head&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the butler's face clouded; he hesitated, and, closing the door,
  came towards her; hesitated again, and, putting his hand in his pocket, took
  out a key. She recognised it as the key of the big safe that stood in one
  corner of the library.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ask you a favour, Miss Long. Could you keep this key... sort
  of 'ang it on a chain or strong ribbon or something... I mean so that it
  never leaves you day or night?"</p>

  <p>Barbara stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You want me to keep it?" she asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's a letter in that safe in a red envelope... sealed up." He was
  breathless, almost incoherent. "If anything happens to me... get it out."</p>

  <p>Barbara was incapable of speech. There was a suppressed eagerness an
  almost vehement sincerity, in his voice. She could not believe that his
  passion for the dramatic was wholly responsible. She took the key a little
  reluctantly, and slipped it on to the ring which held the key of the
  house&mdash;for nowadays she let herself into No. 704.</p>

  <p>"I've got another," he assured her, and showed her the duplicate.</p>

  <p>With a deep and mysterious nod, as though he were emphasising something
  that he had forgotten to tell her, he went softly from the room.</p>

  <p>It was on the afternoon of this day that Barbara met the young man on the
  bus. She was unaware of his existence, though he sat at her side, for her
  mind was occupied by an advertisement which decorated a passing omnibus,
  which showed the picture of legs and feet, and was an absurdly incongruous
  continuation of the human heads and shoulders that appeared above the
  advertisement. She was going to the theatre that night with a girl who lived
  at her boarding-house, for two free stalls for a none too successful play had
  come her way.</p>

  <p>And then the young man on the top of the bus suddenly stood up. He might
  have chosen, thought Barbara Long, a more secure foothold than the toe of her
  patent shoe.</p>

  <p>She uttered a little squeak of warning, and he turned a guilty and
  startled face to hers.</p>

  <p>"I'm so awfully sorry!" he said.</p>

  <p>She thought he was blushing, but afterwards saw that the blush was
  permanent, and wasn't red at all but the sort of brown blush that a tropical
  sun lays on the faces of all who go out of doors on a summery day.</p>

  <p>"Please don't worry&mdash;you didn't touch my toe. I was silly to make a
  fuss."</p>

  <p>But there was a distinct dent where his heel had rested.</p>

  <p>"Sorry... awfully. But I saw a man I wanted to kill!"</p>

  <p>He said this without a smile, and without evidence that he was talking for
  effect. Somehow she knew that he <i>had</i> seen a man he wanted to kill.</p>

  <p>He was about twenty-seven, she judged, with a straight nose, a determined
  mouth and chin, and the greyest and most beautiful eyes she had ever seen in
  a man.</p>

  <p>For his part, there was no need to analyse her attractions feature by
  feature. She was very pretty, very alive; he thought that she might also be
  very capable. Naturally, every woman looked beautiful to him, for he had come
  back from a land where white women are few, and pretty white women who live
  within calling distance are to be counted on the thumb on one hand.</p>

  <p>Now, Barbara Long had the sixth sense of the business girl&mdash;she knew
  instantly the man you can talk to and the man whose conversation must be cut
  short. And she had no qualms about talking to this grey-eyed stranger.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to kill him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I shan't, of course!" he said. "I have a wholesome respect
  for the law. Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Otherwise, she gathered, the unknown would be in some peril.</p>

  <p>"You've been abroad, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>He looked surprised, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've been abroad. If I hadn't, I shouldn't want to kill anybody. A
  sleek fellow that"&mdash;he winced, as though he remembered something that
  hurt him&mdash;"and I'm a fool&mdash;I believe the best of everybody. I'm
  seeing him to-night, and I've got the feeling that any self-respecting fly
  would have if he were invited to dine with a spider."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"That sounds fearfully dramatic."</p>

  <p>They got down together at the corner of Addison Road. He helped her with
  her drawing-board, but made no attempt to improve the acquaintance. She had
  made errors and had profited by them, and she would have been amazed if he
  had asked her the conventional questions: where she lived, did she like the
  pictures, etc.; and yet, being human, she rather wished it was possible that
  he could have asked such questions without losing caste.</p>

  <p>The boarding-house at which Barbara Long lived was in the Earl's Court
  Road, and it differed in no respect from any other boarding-house, except
  that it was run on the lines of a business girls' club. Her room was a large
  one, sparsely furnished with such salvage of her father's furniture as had
  been saved from the sale which followed his death and the liquidation of his
  many debts.</p>

  <p>She had her tea and, going up to her room, dressed leisurely&mdash;and all
  the time she could not get out of her head the memory of that brown face and
  those miraculously grey eyes. She wondered who he was, and the identity of
  the sleek man against whom he harboured homicidal plans.</p>

  <p>She chose, from a recently replenished wardrobe, her best gown in honour
  of the occasion, for she had not been to a theatre for months. Then she
  remembered, with a twitching lip, Mr. Jennings. She should have asked that
  great connoisseur of the dramatic his opinion of the play, she thought, as
  she gathered from a locked drawer the few jewels which her mother had left
  her.</p>

  <p>Going down to dinner, she learnt that the girl who was to have accompanied
  her had retired to bed with an influenza cold. Nevertheless, the prospect of
  going alone did not greatly perturb Barbara. In a sense it was a relief, for
  she had thoughts enough to occupy her.</p>

  <p>Her landlady was talking to her across the table.</p>

  <p>"Did Louise give you the message, Miss Long?"</p>

  <p>"Message?" asked the girl in astonishment. "No; what was it?"</p>

  <p>The landlady uttered a weary exclamation of impatience and Louise, the
  unlovely handmaiden of the house, was summoned from the nether regions.</p>

  <p>"He telephoned after you come in, miss," she said. "I thought you was
  out."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pennings."</p>

  <p>"Jennings?" corrected Barbara quickly. She had never before received a
  message from the butler.</p>

  <p>"That's right, miss&mdash;Jennings. He said something about, would you
  come&mdash;I couldn't hear him very well, because there was a lot of wuzzy
  noises on the 'phone. But that's what he said&mdash;'Tell Miss Long to
  come.'"</p>

  <p>"Did he say when?"</p>

  <p>Louise considered, a frown on her vacuous face. "To-morrow?" she
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't have been then," said Barbara, rising. "I'll telephone
  him."</p>

  <p>She got on to Avenue Road, but there was no answer. She tried again, still
  without success, and, returning to the dining-room, finished her dinner.
  Going upstairs, she got her cloak and allowed herself the unaccustomed luxury
  of a taxicab. Probably it was some letter that Mr. Jennings wanted typed for
  the night post.</p>

  <p>When she got to the house she found the hall in darkness, but she knew her
  way, and, passing into the dark passage, switched on a light and turned into
  the library. She had expected to find Mr. Jennings waiting for her, but the
  room was empty. She went back to the door and listened. Not a sound broke the
  stillness of the house. Perhaps there was a message on the desk? But no sign
  of writing was there. The telephone was there&mdash;the receiver off the
  hook. She understood why her call had not been answered.</p>

  <p>What should she do? Even as she considered, she heard a key turn in the
  lock of the front door, and Mr. Jennings' voice.</p>

  <p>"Come in, sir, come in," it said. "There's nobody in the house but Mr.
  Brownwill and me, and we can say what we have got to say without a soul being
  any the wiser."</p>

  <p>What should she do? Behind the blue velvet curtains in the corner of the
  room was a door leading to a smaller room where she had her luncheon. She
  slipped behind the curtain as Mr. Jennings ushered his visitor into the
  room.</p>

  <p>But here a new difficulty awaited her. The door into the small room was
  locked, and she was in the position of an unintentional eavesdropper.</p>

  <p>Her first inclination was to walk boldly into the library, and there was
  no reason why she shouldn't, because she had been sent for and her presence
  was explainable. But a natural reluctance to appear at a moment when Mr.
  Jennings and his friend were to engage in a conversation which "nobody could
  hear," restrained her.</p>

  <p>"The secretary goes home at three," said Mr. Jennings' voice. "I thought
  you might want to come and talk it over again, so I telephoned her not to
  come to-morrow."</p>

  <p>So that was the message that had been sent and which the bungling Louise
  had muddled!</p>

  <p>"Sit you down, Mr. John; please, sit you down," said Jennings. His voice
  was shrill with anxiety; but for certain peculiar intonations she would not
  have recognised it.</p>

  <p>"How is my grandfather?" asked a deeper voice.</p>

  <p>Where had she heard it before? she wondered. She dare not look for fear
  her presence were discovered.</p>

  <p>"Very poorly, very poorly," sighed Mr. Jennings.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the old gentleman isn't very long for this world."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then the stranger said:</p>

  <p>"Jennings, I'm going to ask you a straight question. Have all the letters
  I sent been given to my grandfather?"</p>

  <p>"Every one of them," said Mr. Jennings fervently. "Every one of them, Mr.
  John."</p>

  <p>"You lie!"</p>

  <p>And now curiosity overcame her: she drew the curtains softly aside and
  saw&mdash;the young man of the omnibus!</p>

  <p>He was in evening dress; nevertheless, she recognised him. As she looked
  she could see that his head turned towards the curtained recess and she drew
  back in a panic.</p>

  <p>"None of my letters has reached him," said "Mr. John" sternly. "You've
  always hated me, Jennings, and you never lost an opportunity of telling lies
  to Mr. Brownwill about me. Three months ago I sent him a letter with a line
  of Greek, which told him that I thought the letters were being intercepted
  and asking him to reply. If he had had that letter, I should have had an
  answer."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jennings was silent. The girl heard his laboured breathing, could
  almost see the tenseness of him.</p>

  <p>"You've got a bad idea about me, Mr. John," said Jennings at last. "I've
  done all I could for you and for your grandfather, and it's hard that I
  should be insulted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to see him."</p>

  <p>She could imagine Jennings shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir, but I can't allow you to do it, sir. His last words to me
  only this day were, 'Never let that fellow into my sight. He only wants my
  money.'"</p>

  <p>Barbara was looking again. She saw the young man start up from the chair
  on which he was sitting.</p>

  <p>"That's another lie," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," murmured Jennings' apologetic voice.</p>

  <p>They were out of her sight now; they had moved nearer to the curtains, and
  the voices came louder.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, sir. I never thought that you'd say a thing like that to
  me," Jennings went on in his even, monotonous voice. "And in this room, sir,
  with your grandfather's picture looking down on you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was no picture of Mr. Brownwill in the room; that was the first
  thought that struck the girl. Evidently the statement surprised the young
  man, for be must have turned. And then to the girl's ears came the sound of a
  dull thud. She heard Mr. Jennings take a step forward and grunt.</p>

  <p>"That will do for you!" said Jennings, his voice tremulous with
  triumph.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later she heard the dining-room door closed, and, peeping
  round the curtain, almost fainted at the sight which met her gaze.</p>

  <p>Lying almost at her feet was John Brownwill, as she guessed him to be.
  There was no sign of a wound, but be was unconscious, and the explanation was
  to be found in the short club that lay within a few inches of his bead. She
  had seen the club once before, hanging in Jennings' pantry.</p>

  <p>She had hardly looked before the handle of the door turned, and she had
  just time enough to conceal herself when Jennings came in, this time
  accompanied by his usually silent wife.</p>

  <p>"Help me get him down to the cellar," he said, and his voice was sharp and
  commanding.</p>

  <p>There came from the passage without the sound of sobs.</p>

  <p>"And stop that damned girl of yours!" snarled Jennings.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you!" snapped the woman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my Gawd!" sounded a hollow voice from the hall. "We shall be hung for
  this! Oh, why did you let Father do it, Ma?"</p>

  <p>"Come in and lend a hand!" rasped Mr. Jennings.</p>

  <p>The weeping girl came awkwardly into the library and, still sobbing,
  stooped and helped support the legs of the stricken man.</p>

  <p>Barbara listened and watched, petrified with terror. She heard the
  basement door open and the hesitant steps of the bearer party pass down to
  the cellar, and then, running from her place of concealment, she fled to the
  street door. But it had been locked on the inside and the key had been taken
  away. Mr. Brownwill! He was an old man, but he might help.</p>

  <p>She flew up the stairs and tried the door of his room. It was open.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brownwill!" she whispered agitatedly, but there was no answer, and
  she switched on the light.</p>

  <p>The room was empty. It was not even completely furnished; the very bed was
  unmade. She turned out the light, her brain in a whirl, and made towards the
  head of the stairs. As she did so she heard the voice of Jennings and his
  wife in the hail below. It was Mrs. Jennings speaking.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd come in earlier: I heard the door open. This place gives
  me the creeps, Isaac. I'm always hearing noises... what are you going to do
  with him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know... got to do something," said Jennings in a low voice.
  "We've all day to-morrow to think about it. That girl isn't coming."</p>

  <p>The kitchen door opened and slammed. She must make her way back to the
  library, she decided. There was a French window which could be opened, and
  would afford her a way out of the house. Silent as death, trembling in every
  limb, she crept down the stairs into the library, and as she did so she heard
  a faint tinkle.</p>

  <p>She was still clutching her bag&mdash;the keys! And then there came back
  to her with a rush the recollection of Jennings' remarkable request. The red
  envelope in the safe! She did not hesitate; with shaking hands, she inserted
  the key, turned the knob and groped in the inside. Presently her fingers
  touched a folded packet. There was enough light from the fire to distinguish
  the colour of the envelope: it was red.</p>

  <p>She gently stirred the coals to a blaze and read the writing. It was
  addressed: "To Whom it may Concern. Proof of Innocence of Isaac
  Jennings."</p>

  <p>She was straightening up when suddenly the room blazed with light.
  Jennings was standing in the doorway, blank-faced, staring, his mouth working
  convulsively.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what are you doing here?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>And then be saw the open door of the safe and the envelope in her hand,
  and he reeled back.</p>

  <p>"Give me that," he gasped, and took a step towards her.</p>

  <p>What made her do it she could never understand. Perhaps her mind had
  suddenly tuned to his, and she read the shuddering fear in his heart, and
  jerked back her arm so that the letter was held over the fire.</p>

  <p>"Don't come near me," she breathed, "or I will burn this!"</p>

  <p>He stood blinking at her, white-faced, a picture of fear.</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;don't do it!" he articulated at last.</p>

  <p>And then she saw the woman appear from the passage.</p>

  <p>"I'll do anything! I'll do anything!" screamed Jennings. "But don't burn
  that! For God's sake, miss, don't burn it!"</p>

  <p>"Open the front door and fetch a policeman!"</p>

  <p>It was a mad request, and, like a woman in a dream, she saw him turn to
  his wife.</p>

  <p>"Get a policeman&mdash;quick," be quavered and then to her, with a
  gesticulation of terror: "Not so near the fire, miss&mdash;keep it away from
  the fire!"</p>

  <p>The woman had disappeared. From somewhere below came the dull sound of
  hammering.</p>

  <p>"Give it to me!" Jennings stretched out his shaking hand. "I'll give you a
  thousand pounds for it! I won't hurt you&mdash;I swear I won't hurt you!..."
  He was still supplicating when a tall, broad-shouldered policeman walked into
  the drawing-room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was three days later that Mr. John Brownwill dined with
  Miss Barbara Long at the Ritz, and in those three days a great deal had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"The main fact," said the bus man (as she thought of him), "is that
  Jennings will not hang! If you'd burnt that envelope I don't see what could
  have saved him from the gallows. My grandfather, who was a very morose and
  misanthropic individual, had neither lawyer nor doctor. Otherwise, he would
  have known, first that he had a swindling servant, and secondly that he had a
  pretty bad heart. He was in the habit of taking long walks at night, and in
  the course of one of these constitutionals he was taken ill and dropped dead
  in the street. The body was removed to the workhouse, and there was nothing
  in the pockets to identify him. Jennings missed him that night and went out
  in search of him, and by accident heard that an unknown man had been found in
  the street.</p>

  <p>I suppose his first impulse was to identify my grandfather, but that meant
  that he and his wife and daughter were going to leave a very comfortable job,
  and possibly there would have been exposed the fact that he had been forging
  my grandfather's name for small amounts during the year before his death. So
  poor old Walter Brownwill, worth five hundred thousand pounds, was buried in
  a pauper's grave, unknown, unclaimed. The certificate of his death and all
  particulars about that burial were in the red envelope. Jennings feared the
  day of reckoning; feared also that the time might come when he would be
  accused of murder.</p>

  <p>"After my grandfather was buried, Jennings' job was an easy one. He had
  merely to pretend that Mr. Brownwill was still in the house, and to carry on
  as though he were alive. A private secretary was engaged to strengthen his
  position. She became known to the bank, from which large sums were drawn, and
  that made things even easier for him. Unfortunately, I turned up and insisted
  upon seeing my grandfather. Jennings put me off&mdash;by the way, he was the
  fellow I saw from the top of the bus&mdash;but to-night, when I was dining
  with some people, he called me up and asked me to meet him&mdash;he said he
  had been looking for me all the evening. I met him actually outside the house
  where I had been dining, and he brought me here. And it was nearly my final
  social call! The man was a consummate actor: I can't understand where he got
  his inspirations."</p>

  <p>Barbara remembered the serried rows of signed photographs, but said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I think I owe my life to you," the young man went on quietly, "and I've
  bought you a little present. I wonder if you'll mind?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. It was a beautiful ring, and, remembering that he had
  no great experience in such matters, it was remarkable that he put it on the
  right finger!</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>7. &mdash; DIANA HELPS</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">JACK SAVERLEY had serious thoughts of asking Diana how she
  regarded such a happening. Diana's point of view would be interesting.
  Presumably she would give a more charitable verdict than he was prepared to
  offer. Of course Prendenbury was not ruined, as he so extravagantly claimed
  to be; men and women are kinder and bigger than we think they are in such
  moments of crisis. And because a man's wife is guilty of vulgar shop-lifting
  and is sent to prison for a month, they do not visit her sins upon him.</p>

  <p>Jack paused in his work and gazed thoughtfully at the primitive beauty-
  type who was shaping on the canvas before him. Mrs. Prendenbury was a great
  friend of May's.... He scratched his nose with the stick of his brush and
  smiled. May...! Still, he would like to have Diana's view. Would she look at
  the matter broadly and diagnose this mania of Ethel Prendenbury as a disease,
  as three eminent specialists had done&mdash;for Prendenbury had money and
  could afford expert evidence?</p>

  <p>Once he stopped, half intending to call Diana from the coal-cellar where
  she had been most of the morning, but the thought of May stopped him. May
  disliked Diana and was not amused when, at his urgent and insistent request,
  she had given an amazing imitation of a certain great actor in <i>The School
  for Scandal</i>.</p>

  <p>Diana had behind her the record of twenty years' honourable association
  with the stage. She was no more than a dresser, it is true, but she had
  dressed and admired the great. She was a stumpy, middle-aged woman, waistless
  and heavy-cheeked. And being no longer needed by the theatre folk she had
  served, she went out as a daily help. May hated her shrill Cockney voice, but
  Diana had moments when her voice was languidly refined. Her imitation of Mrs.
  Salter-Pasaro, that great tragedienne, was amazingly convincing; sometimes
  (when she was cleaning the silver was her favourite occasion) she gave as
  startling a representation of Miss Vivian Marsham, "than whom" (as an eminent
  critic has said) "there is no greater Desdemona."</p>

  <p>Jack Saverley tore his mind from Diana; there was a catalogue cover to be
  finished and he wanted the money. Otherwise he would have gone out, as he
  said he would, to lunch at the club. May, at any rate, thought he was there.
  She stood in the doorway of the living-room-studio, consternation in her
  face.</p>

  <p>Jack, looking up, saw her.</p>

  <p>"Hello, darling; been shopping?"</p>

  <p>"Y-yes. I thought you were going out, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"I had to finish this beastly cover," he said, rising to knock out his
  pipe and to contemplate at a distance the work of three hours. "Not so bad.
  Why don't you take your things off, duckie? Let me take that muff."</p>

  <p>She drew back quickly.</p>

  <p>"No, no. Jack, will you get me a glass of water? I am feeling a little
  faint."</p>

  <p>His jaw dropped. Now he saw how white she was, and&mdash;"I'm sorry,
  darling," he said, and flew out of the room.</p>

  <p>She waited until he was gone, then drew from her muff two small bundles
  and thrust them under the cushion of the arm-chair. Then, with a sigh of
  relief, she threw her muff to the settee and slipped from her heavy coat.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you ought not to wear these heavy clothes. It is quite warm
  to-day. I am glad I was in. You look ghastly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is nothing," she said. "It is beastly shopping. There are so many
  people about. I went into Tapperleys, and I was nearly an hour before I was
  served."</p>

  <p>"Tapperleys!" His surprise was justified, for Tapperleys was the most
  expensive shop in town. "I suppose you went to look round," he said, and his
  arm slid round her. "I wish I could afford to give you the run of every shop
  in London. I will, some day, when my fortune's made."</p>

  <p>Holding her at arm's length, his smiling eyes surveyed her.</p>

  <p>"How you manage to dress on the miserable little allowance I give you is a
  mystery to me! Oh, by the way, Tapperleys&mdash;do you know that man
  Smithers? He came here the other day with the manager of Tapperleys' art
  department. I am doing some dress designs for them."</p>

  <p>"Smithers?"</p>

  <p>"No, I remember you were out. Smithers is a Scotland Yard
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She clutched at the edge of the table, and Jack, busy at his palette, did
  not see the effect of his words.</p>

  <p>"ScotIand Yard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There has been quite a lot of shop-lifting at Tapperleys lately, and
  they employed him to hunt down the principal offender. I cannot understand
  how a woman can bring herself to commit a petty crime like shop-lifting, can
  you, May? As a normal woman, can you get into the mind of that kind of
  creature?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"N-no. Why do you talk about such horrible things?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I suppose Tapperleys reminded me." He was at work again,
  and the easel and canvas were between them. She gathered up her coat from the
  chair, and, as she did so, slipped her hand underneath the cushion. Under
  cover of the coat, she brought out the bundles she had put there earlier,
  and, wrapping them inside the coat, she walked to the door.</p>

  <p>"I am going to lie down. Where is Diana?"</p>

  <p>"Diana? I think she has gone down to the cellar. Do you want her?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, a frown on her pretty face.</p>

  <p>"No. Jack, do you think we shall ever be able to afford to have a real
  nice servant? Diana is impossible."</p>

  <p>"She's not a bad old sort," he said tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack, she's terrible"&mdash;she was always irritated by his
  championship. "Look at the dust on everything."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you are going to rhapsodise about Diana, I'm going!"</p>

  <p>Jack heard the slam of the door and grinned. Then, putting down brush and
  palette, he went out on to the landing and called a name. A second later,
  Diana's slippered feet shuffled in the hail below. Diana had never been
  beautiful. At forty-eight her plainness was accentuated. She never looked her
  best in the morning, and she was absolutely at her worst after sifting coal.
  She had been sifting that morning, and staggered into the room with a laden
  scuttle in her hand and a carboniferous deposit on her face.</p>

  <p>"That mine where this coal comes from has got a slate roof," she grunted.
  "Is the missus back, Mr. What's-yer-name?"</p>

  <p>Diana never remembered names unless they were names which graced a
  play-bill.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mrs. Saverley is back. Diana, you really must have this room dusted
  earlier. Mrs. Saverley has been complaining again."</p>

  <p>"Dusted, sir?" asked Diana incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why, I wrote my name on that shelf this morning."</p>

  <p>"Why? Ain't you got a pen and ink?" asked Diana. She hobbled across to the
  piano and ran her fingers along the top. "I don't call that dusty. Why, I
  only did it last Monday! I've lost three dusters lately. I don't want to say
  anything against anybody, but since that woman who works downstairs has been
  working d'oylies for a church bazaar I can't keep a duster by me."</p>

  <p>"She seems very respectable," said Jack, "if you mean the charlady at No.
  6."</p>

  <p>"Respectable!" scoffed Diana. "I should say she was! Why, she's buried
  three husbands!"</p>

  <p>Jack, watching her, wondered whether he should broach the subject of Mrs.
  Prendenbury and her sin.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm fastidious for artist?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Diana shrugged her ample shoulders, and applied herself to her dusting
  with great energy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "I did work for a fastidious lady once. She was
  a sword swallower at the circus. She'd spend all the night putting swords
  into her inside, and then come home and complain about the flies in the
  milk!"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I often wonder you never went on to the stage, Diana."</p>

  <p>"I did have a chance once," said Diana grimly. "Wilson Barrett was going
  to give me a part in the <i>Sign of the Cross</i>."</p>

  <p>"What part was that?" he asked, interested.</p>

  <p>"I was to be one of the early Christian martyrs that was eat by the lions
  before the curtain went up," said Diana, and he leaned back and roared.</p>

  <p>Diana came to the arm-chair, rubbed its polished back, and banged the
  cushion. As she turned this over she saw something. It was a pair of
  stockings, and she looked suspiciously at the innocent Jack.</p>

  <p>"Hello, what's that?" he asked, looking round.</p>

  <p>"Looks like stockings to me," said Diana dryly. "You ain't been painting
  anybody without their stockings, have you, Mr. What's-yer-name?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Diana.</p>

  <p>She was still examining them when they were snatched from her, and she
  turned to meet the flaming face of her mistress.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing with those?" she demanded wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" Jack reached out his hand. "I thought you said you didn't
  buy anything May?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't. These were a present from a girl I know. They didn't fit her. I
  wish to goodness you'd leave things alone."</p>

  <p>Diana had a disconcerting trick of bowing. It was no more than a stately
  inclination of head, but it exasperated May beyond all endurance. Before she
  could snap the words which were on her lips, the telephone bell rang and Jack
  answered.</p>

  <p>For a little while he spoke in monosyllables, and then she heard him utter
  an exclamation of horror.</p>

  <p>"You're mad, Frank. Yes, yes; she's just come in. It is absurd!"</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver, and turned a face, frozen with horror, to the
  pallid girl.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Jack passed his hand across his forehead as though he were in a dream.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Jack. What is it?"</p>

  <p>When he did speak his voice was broken and hollow.</p>

  <p>"They say that you have been shop-lifting, that they saw you steal
  something and identified you. They are going to search the house."</p>

  <p>Diana's eyes bulged. Her hands clasped across her broad person, she could
  only stare.</p>

  <p>Jack walked quickly to the window, and looked out.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is Smithers watching the house."</p>

  <p>He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"What is the truth, dear?" he asked gently, and in a second she was in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack, it is true!" she sobbed. "I have ruined you! Oh, I was mad,
  mad!"</p>

  <p>"True!" he gasped. "May, darling, you don't mean it! Where are the
  articles you have stolen?"</p>

  <p>"It has been going on for a long time, Jack," came her muffled voice. "I
  don't know how I can look you in the face!"</p>

  <p>Jack sprang to the door and turned the key.</p>

  <p>"We must get the stuff out of the house. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>She had flung herself face downward on the sofa, and her sobs were
  heart-rending.</p>

  <p>"In my&mdash;wardrobe," she gulped.</p>

  <p>He dashed into the room, and came back in a minute, a bundle of
  miscellaneous articles in his arms. They ranged from a fur coat to
  stockings.</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;" he began, when there came a knock at the door. He
  dropped the bundle with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Too late!" He gathered the girl in his arms and kissed her. "My poor
  little girl!"</p>

  <p>"Here!" It was Diana's hoarse whisper, and he looked round.</p>

  <p>"What about getting all these clothes out of the house?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible now."</p>

  <p>But Diana had already made her plan. She caught up the bundle and made for
  the bedroom door, pausing only to make a snatch at the lay figure which,
  adorned with hat and wig, had been his inanimate model.</p>

  <p>Again came the knock at the door.</p>

  <p>"Hush," he said gently. "Dry your eyes quickly. We have to hold this man
  until Diana gets rid of the clothes."</p>

  <p>"But, Jack, she can't," wailed the girl. "There is no way out of that
  room, and if she drops them from the window the people in the street will see
  her."</p>

  <p>A third knock, this time sharply, and after a second's hesitation Jack
  crossed the room and opened the door.</p>

  <p>A square-built man stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Mr. Saverley," he said briskly. "Morning, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Smithers," said Jack. "I think we have met before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Smithers, with his professional manner, "and we shall
  probably meet again. I've come on a very unpleasant business, Mr. Saverley."
  He added that he was not the sort of man that gloated over anybody's
  misfortune, but that the law was the law, when all was said and done.</p>

  <p>"Is this lady your wife?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jack, "she is my wife."</p>

  <p>Mr. Smithers shook his head.</p>

  <p>"H'm. Very bad business this. You guess why I've come, I suppose? I am
  from Tapperleys." This time he spoke direct to May.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil should my wife guess anything about you?" snarled Jack, and
  the man raised a restraining hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm here in the execution of my duty. I'm a police officer from Scotland
  Yard. From information received, I have applied for a warrant to search your
  flat."</p>

  <p>Jack took a step forward.</p>

  <p>"Warrant or no warrant, you'll search nothing here!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Smithers was pained. "What's the good of making a fuss? I've goto do
  duty."</p>

  <p>"May I ask why you have taken this extraordinary action?" asked Jack more
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"That's the easiest thing to explain," said Mr. Smithers. "Tapperleys have
  been preyed upon by shop-lifters for twelve months. I have reason to believe
  that your wife is one of the principal offenders. They have lost goods to the
  amount of three or four hundred pounds to her alone, and she has been
  watched. To-day she was seen taking certain articles from the bargain
  basement."</p>

  <p>"You dare to say that my wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>May's arms were round his neck; her wet face to his.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack, what is the use?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"Exactly; what is the use?" urged Mr. Smithers.</p>

  <p>He wanted everything done quietly and in order. He respected Mr. Saverley,
  who was a gentleman, and no doubt an artist. He was prepared to wait until
  Jack came to a reasonable frame of mind. He sat down to argue the legality of
  his position. Jack was content that he should talk.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smithers concluded:</p>

  <p>"What is the good of making all this fuss, Mr. Saverley? If I can't find
  the goods, why then, I owe you an apology. If the goods are there&mdash;well
  then, there's going to be trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Reahly&mdash;what is it all about? Do tell me."</p>

  <p>She had come into the room without their hearing her&mdash;a magnificent
  woman, expensively arrayed. No longer in the first bloom of youth, despite
  her golden hair and her fresh complexion, she carried herself imperially.
  Through a pair of lorgnettes she examined the company critically.</p>

  <p>"Which <i>is</i> the artist?" she asked, in the tired tone of one who had
  grown weary of thinking.</p>

  <p>"I am the artist," said Jack shortly.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad. I called in with a commission. Is this a friend of yours?
  Oh, good morning. I am so much obliged to you for opening the door." She
  surveyed the detective through her lorgnettes. "You are so like dear Lord
  Harthur Hallen that you quite startled me. Poor dear, he was took away to
  'Anwell, suffering from water on the brain, through standing in the rain
  without 'is 'at. I'm Lady Mary Goldenbird."</p>

  <p>"My God!" whispered Jack, recognising the hat and the wig.</p>

  <p>"I beg your ladyship's pardon, I am sure&mdash;but the fact is, I am a
  detective," said Smithers.</p>

  <p>"Reahly? How very extraordinary, amazingly and remarkably strange! How
  perfectly fascinating! So you're a slop&mdash;a rozzer&mdash;to use an
  Italian expression. Do you like Italy, Mr. Smithers? I think it is simply
  lovely and charming and delightful. You must come and see me in my little
  villa."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure your ladyship's very kind," said Smithers, overcome.</p>

  <p>He respectfully came to her side and lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"I hope your ladyship won't mind my making a search. Are these friends of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>Her ladyship shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly friends. I've met them at whist drives. You know the kind of
  people one meets when one is out on one's own?"</p>

  <p>"The fact is, my lady," said Smithers confidentially, "this young woman is
  suspected of shop-lifting."</p>

  <p>"Reahly? Does one lift shops? How perfectly, splendidly marvellous! I
  think I'd better go if&mdash;er&mdash; you're searching."</p>

  <p>He saw her to the door, watched her go grandly down the stairs, but did
  not see her vanish into the flat which at that time was occupied solely by
  the respectable woman who had buried three husbands, the mistress of the
  house being on a holiday.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to his search&mdash;but found nothing. For he had
  escorted the stolen property to the door.</p>

  <p>Downstairs in the respectable woman's kitchen, Diana fanned herself with a
  blond wig, and the respectable woman, seeing her rouged cheeks, was both
  shocked and curious.</p>

  <p>"To go dressing up at your time of life, Mrs. What's-yer-name!" she said
  disapprovingly; "and how 'ot you look!"</p>

  <p>"So would you if you were wearing six pairs of stockings and corsets that
  didn't half meet," protested Diana.</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"I was posin' for him&mdash;he's an artist, as I've often told you."</p>

  <p>"She's not much, is she?" asked the respectable woman disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. S.?" brindled Diana. "As nice and respectable a lady as you'd meet
  in a month of Sundays, Mrs. What's-yer-name! And a perfect lady!"</p>

  <p>The respectable woman was impressed. For Diana did not give good
  characters lightly.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>8. &mdash; CON-LACTO IS STRENGTH</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">BETWEEN the Kentish coast and the town of Ashford is a
  large, square, green field, bordered about with a white fence, and in the
  centre of the field, picked out in stones, which are limewashed every month,
  are the words:</p>

  <p class="sign">CON-LACTO IS STRENGTH</p>

  <p>Giles Broad had often zoomed Z.HLM&mdash;Q into the clouds that he might
  avoid that offensive sight. On clear days Con-lacto was plainly visible for
  fifteen miles at 10,000 feet, and Giles had got into the habit of flying low
  so that he might pass this evidence of Mr. Conway's shame and complacency so
  rapidly that the words could not be read.</p>

  <p>At least, he did until one day, when he dropped so near that he narrowly
  escaped touching the spire of Linthorpe church.</p>

  <p>Not that his passengers knew anything about their danger. They were
  usually so busy being sick, or praying for Croydon, that, death seemed a
  pleasant alternative route to comfort and stability.</p>

  <p>Four days a week Giles piloted the London-Brussels air packet of the
  Cloudway Route. It was a dull life compared with those thrilling days of war,
  when you might not cross the Belgian coast line without inviting permanent
  disablement.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he would make a wide detour and cross the old battle-fields,
  barging into the salient in his endeavour to pick out such of the places as
  had immediate interest for him.</p>

  <p>The old farm where Willaker crashed; that patch of undamaged wood which
  sheltered the most vicious of the German "Archies"; the little town where he
  brought down Muller, the German ace, after an epic fight which lasted twenty
  minutes. Muller was not killed; he sometimes met that stout and smiling
  German, and they forgathered in a low Brussels <i>estaminet</i>, and drank
  confusion to all soldiers who walked on their feet. Muller piloted a bus
  which plies daily between Amsterdam and Cologne, taking in Brussels <i>en
  route</i>.</p>

  <p>Giles drew so many pounds per month for his services. He often wondered
  whether Mr. Josiah Conway had planted that infernal advertisement in his path
  out of sheer malice and spite. Certainly it was not to convince this
  sceptical air pilot of the value of Con-lacto. Giles was beyond conviction.
  He had expressed his views with such force that he had expected to be
  forbidden the house.</p>

  <p>"And you're really marvellously lucky that you're not," said Leslie Conway
  reproachfully. "Why on earth didn't you keep off the subject of Con- lacto,
  darling? It is fearfully difficult for me as it is. Daddy sent for an
  <i>Almanach de Gotha</i> last week, and he's been hunting up Filitera's
  pedigree."</p>

  <p>Giles snorted. But this fair-haired and pretty daughter of Josiah Conway
  was used to snorts. Her father was one of the most effective snorters in the
  canned food business.</p>

  <p>"If he's in the <i>Gotha</i>, I'm a Dutchman!"</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> in <i>Gotha's</i>," she said sternly. "He's the Count of
  Filitera and the Marquis Walmer-Rotalio."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea? Is he to be the Duke de Con-lacto?" asked Giles
  savagely.</p>

  <p>"Daddy's very partial to him," said Leslie, with something of the family
  complacency. "He speaks well of Con-lacto, anyway, and he is translating some
  of our labels into Italian."</p>

  <p>Giles laughed sardonically.</p>

  <p>And yet the matter was a very serious one for him. The fact that Leslie
  Conway was the only daughter of an extremely rich man scarcely counted. He
  did not seriously blame Mr. Conway for thrusting down the throats of helpless
  invalids and innocent infants a slimy, shivery, creamy fluid that contained
  the concentrated values of the best cream plus the stimulating qualities of
  the finest cane sugar, plus Vitamine A, B, or C. And Con-lacto was the daily
  food of thousands&mdash;hundreds of thousands. It stood by many an invalid's
  bedside and reconciled him to his dissolution; it appeared in babies'
  bottles; it had been recommended by doctors, and formed the staple diet of
  infantile royalties. And because of this Mr. Josiah Conway had a castle on
  one of the upper reaches of the Thames&mdash;a great red-brick place that
  stood on a high hill and overshadowed a bend of the river. It gave him the
  right of warning trespassers that they would be shot at sight; it filled his
  massive marble garage with cars of a delicate breed, and enabled him to fish
  in Scottish rivers and shoot on Yorkshire moors, and sleep beneath the roof
  of a flat in Carlton House Terrace.</p>

  <p>"I merely stated&mdash;" began Giles.</p>

  <p>"Giles, my darling, you talk too much. I suppose you really talk all the
  time you're flying, but the noise of the engine is so loud that you're hardly
  aware of the fact. What harm would it have done you to have told Daddy that
  Con-lacto once saved your life? Instead of which, you say that the only time
  you'd ever used it was to drop a tin on to the head of a German staff
  officer; and as if that wasn't enough, you told him that immediately
  everybody in the neighbourhood put on their gas masks!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot lie&mdash;" began the virtuous Giles.</p>

  <p>"You lied on one side, why not lie on another? Giles, dear, I'm terribly
  afraid that unless something can be done I shall wake up one morning and see
  my picture in an illustrated weekly&mdash;'The Beautiful Miss Leslie Conway,
  who is to marry the Count of Filitera.'"</p>

  <p>Giles sighed.</p>

  <p>"The next time I come to dinner I'll try to make amends," he said.</p>

  <p>"If there is a next time," she warned him.</p>

  <p>There was a next time, as it happened. Mr. Conway might despise the views
  of Giles Broad on the nutritive values of Con-lacto, but he had a high
  respect for him as a pilot, and since business took him abroad every month,
  it was, he argued, very desirable that he should travel with the greatest
  assurance and safety.</p>

  <p>"But you quite understand, Leslie, my dear, that there is to be no
  nonsense with this fellow? Naturally, I do not wish wholly to determine your
  future to meet my own views of what is right and best for you. There must be
  a certain independence of selection. Just as in our business we choose only
  the milk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Daddy, let us keep to our subject," she interrupted gently. "Whatever
  Giles is, he isn't a cow."</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway agreed. He wanted to see her happy and settled. But then, he
  had wanted to see her happy and settled on every occasion that an eligible
  young man (from his point of view) had loomed on the horizon. And always, it
  seemed to Leslie&mdash;happily, for his peace of mind, Giles did not know
  this&mdash;there was an extraordinarily good reason why her own selective
  qualities should be brought into play.</p>

  <p>"He is foolish," said Mr. Conway, "and a little uncouth. Such a business
  as ours could not have been built up except on a scientific basis. Eliminate
  science from Con-lacto, and what have we?&mdash;nil, nothing! When this young
  man sneers at Con-lacto he sneers at science&mdash;at&mdash;er&mdash;Faraday
  and Lister and Newton. Such a man must have an unbalanced mind; such a man is
  no fit mate for my daughter," etc. etc.</p>

  <p>Leslie never really worried about her father's plain statements of the
  fact. The etceteras were, however, very trying. If Mr. Conway had been a
  sensible creature he would have kept off his favourite subject that night at
  dinner; but the narrow-headed and swarthy young man who sat on his daughter's
  right hand, and who spoke in such excellent English that you might never have
  dreamt his Levantine origin, was mainly responsible for the introduction of
  the topic.</p>

  <p>Giles listened and was bored. He was not only bored, but he showed that he
  was bored, which was extremely tactless. He was sitting so far away from
  Leslie, and so near to her father, that occasionally his interest
  wandered.</p>

  <p>"... Now I never travel without a case of The Food," Mr. Conway was
  saying, addressing his possible relative of the near future. "So far from
  being ashamed, I am proud of the universal benefit which I confer upon
  mankind. Why? you ask me" (the Count had not asked him). "First"&mdash;he
  ticked off on his thumb&mdash; "Vitamine A," and on his forefinger, "Vitamine
  B," and then rapidly in succession the best cane sugar, the product of happy
  cows, packed under ideal conditions...</p>

  <p>"Mr. Broad, you will perhaps agree to this. An airman's health is his
  chief asset. Now suppose, instead of scoffing, you were to make the
  experiment. A spoonful dropped into a cup of tea..."</p>

  <p>"I don't drink tea," said the very trying young man.</p>

  <p>"Or coffee..."</p>

  <p>"Keeps me awake when I'm flying," said Giles recklessly. "I take my little
  nap from Dover to Dunkirk." And, as Mr. Conway's eyes opened in horror, the
  girl intervened hastily.</p>

  <p>"Don't take any notice of Giles. Of course he doesn't sleep on duty!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway shrugged his shoulders and muttered something about
  "flippancy."</p>

  <p>When they were alone, Leslie took her lover by the ear and led him to a
  quiet corner in a very old-fashioned and earth-smelling conservatory, which
  was Mr. Conway's idea of a winter garden.</p>

  <p>"You deserve to be smacked," she said seriously "I was simply on pins and
  needles right through dinner, for fear you'd tell that ridiculous story about
  having blown up a dump with two tins of the wretched stuff! Can't you be
  good, for my sake?"</p>

  <p>Giles shook his head in despair.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with me is," he said mournfully, "I can't be a hypocrite.
  Every time I see an advertisement of Con-lacto&mdash;'Me for
  Strength'&mdash;I want to shy something at it. If it was beer it wouldn't be
  so bad: I could respect a brewer."</p>

  <p>A few days later he stood in the aerodrome discussing matrimony with
  Fred.</p>

  <p>Fred was his mechanic, tall and thin and gloomy, with a long lead-
  coloured face and pale blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"... You can reckon yourself lucky, Mr. Broad, that you're single. I don't
  know how I come to get married. A good woman, but wantin' me to live her
  life. She believes in cotton next to the skin. I never have anything but
  wool. She likes tomatoes&mdash;they make me ill... there they are every day
  on the table&mdash; tomatoes! She says I'll get to like 'em in time&mdash;if
  I'll only try! She says I ought to be properly fed. Food's poison to me.
  Every trip she brings me enough meat sandwiches t' sink a ship. I always drop
  'em out over the Channel. She means well. Oh Gawd!"</p>

  <p>A stout and charming woman was hurrying across the aerodrome and on her
  arm was a basket.</p>

  <p>"My snack!" groaned Fred; "heavy enough to break her arm."</p>

  <p>Giles strolled away discreetly; he wondered if Leslie would come every day
  with his dinner-pail.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the big car run in from the road and recognised his
  passengers. Mr. Conway he expected, but the attentive young man who walked by
  Leslie's side was an eyesore.</p>

  <p>"Who's your boy friend?" asked Giles, and, when she told him, "Good lord!
  Is he going up?" He grinned fiendishly. "I'll tell you the spot where we'll
  do one of the neatest little crashes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd. He's terribly scared. If he wasn't so fond of me he
  wouldn't make the trip."</p>

  <p>Giles watched with a sardonic smile the careful disposal of a square black
  case.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Fairy Food?" he demanded. "I can't get away from that high
  explosive!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway was looking at the sky with an anxious frown. Low clouds were
  scurrying up from the southwest; it had grown colder since the morning.</p>

  <p>"It looks a bit rough, my dear&mdash;er&mdash;Gjles," he said.</p>

  <p>Giles cocked an eye aloft and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing. We'll do Brussels in record time."</p>

  <p>The Count was already looking yellow.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there's no danger, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"None at all," said Giles curtly. He looked at his watch. "Are you the
  only two passengers, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway looked around.</p>

  <p>"There only seem to be us three."</p>

  <p>"Three?" said Giles sharply. "Leslie isn't travelling?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm travelling."</p>

  <p>He hadn't carried her for two years. Usually she was in the habit of
  coming to the aerodrome to say good-bye to her father, and the knowledge that
  she would now be behind him was not very comforting. He hurried over to the
  office and met his immediate chief half-way.</p>

  <p>"They're your only passengers, Giles. The weather report has scared the
  other people away."</p>

  <p>Giles looked up at the sky again.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it'll be all right?" he asked, with a frown.</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"The weather's pretty good over the Channel. You'll get half a gale to-
  night, which means you'll have to stay on in Brussels, but I don't think
  you'll have a very uncomfortable time."</p>

  <p>Giles scratched his chin thoughtfully. He was by no means as
  optimistic.</p>

  <p>He hurried back to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Leslie, darling, I want you to give up this trip. I don't think either
  your father or your pie-faced friend ought to go flying on a day like
  this."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Father has to be in Brussels this evening. He has a very important
  conference."</p>

  <p>"With Con-lacto?" he asked irritably, and was instantly penitent. "I'm
  terribly sorry, but I really wish you weren't coming up. It looks like being
  a very jumpy voyage, and you'll be sicker than three cats."</p>

  <p>"Don't be coarse," she said.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later he went up in the teeth of a wind of rapidly increasing
  strength.</p>

  <p>Clear of Croydon, he began to have an idea of what the weather really was
  like. The south-west was a black wall, and he noticed, as he followed the
  direction of the wind, that the clouds were moving very little slower than
  he. At one minute the countryside was plainly visible, the next it was
  blotted out by a tumbling, swirling mass of grey cloud. His wireless began to
  chatter. He picked up his number and the message: "Return to aerodrome.
  Cyclonic disturbances southwest... "</p>

  <p>The machine was now bumping and swaying alarmingly. He banked round at an
  unnerving angle, and fell into a spin, which he corrected. Fred, the
  mechanic, pulled a long face, and pointed downwards with a fiendish leer.
  Giles had an impression of hope on that long unhappy face. He decided to take
  the risk and darted down with all his engines running.</p>

  <p>At any moment something might loom out of that mist and bring him to
  destruction. He decided to take no risks and climbed up again. The machine
  steadied, though the wind had increased in strength. After five minutes it
  seemed a little clearer below, and cautiously he slid down. And then beneath
  the machine he saw the white feathers of wind-blown waves. He was over the
  sea, and instantly he turned westward toward the coast.</p>

  <p>"A cyclonic disturbance" was a mild description of the storm. It treated
  his huge monoplane as if it were a piece of paper. The speed indicator told
  him nothing; the compass jiggled furiously. Suddenly on his right flickered a
  broad, jagged crack of blue flame, and the reverberation of the thunder
  almost shivered his head.</p>

  <p>Exactly what was his position he could not tell. He sent out a wireless to
  request the direction, but received no reply. Again and again he brought the
  'plane down, always to find raging water beneath him and no sign of land.</p>

  <p>The reserve of petrol was not a very large one. He looked at his watch;
  for two hours he had alternately battled and gone with the wind. He was
  moving north all the time&mdash;he was only too conscious of this&mdash;and
  going north at a terrific rate. The third hour passed, and the mechanic made
  a report on the petrol supply that struck him cold with fear. Again he
  dipped, came almost to sea-level, and zoomed up again. Higher and higher he
  climbed, and well for him. Suddenly, out of the confusion ahead, he saw a
  white jagged cliff, cleared the crest of it with a foot to spare.... Beneath,
  he saw a level boulder-strewn plateau, ran wide of it, and, coming back into
  the wind, battled in the teeth of the gale.... The wheels struck the ground,
  just missed a devastating boulder, and came to a standstill abruptly. Only
  for a second, then he found himself going back, and restarted his
  engines.</p>

  <p>"Get out and tack her down," he yelled.</p>

  <p>He seized a tool-box and followed the mechanic. They were in a saucer-
  like depression, almost bare of vegetation, and around them circled a shrill
  cloud of gulls.</p>

  <p>The aeroplane was being slowly blown back to the end of the cliff as Giles
  trundled a boulder beneath the wheel and reinforced this with another. He
  climbed up, wrenched open the door of the "saloon," and the Count Filitera
  almost fell into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Get out &mdash; quick!" he commanded, lifted the white-faced girl clear,
  and assisted Mr. Conway to solid earth.</p>

  <p>Giles looked round. At one end of the plateau he had seen a square wooden
  hut, and, taking the girl's arm in his, he piloted her through the driving
  rain. There was need for his support, for the force of the wind was so
  terrific that they could scarcely keep their feet. And when he spoke to her
  he had to shout at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Island of some sort... quite small... I thought I saw an automatic
  lighthouse."</p>

  <p>The force of the wind was broken as they came under the shelter of the
  sloping crater. The house was closed and shuttered; there was no sign of
  life; even the squat stone chimney had its cover firmly lashed. On the thick,
  weather- beaten door was an inscription. He peered at this and deciphered the
  almost obliterated words.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be a sort of a bird sanctuary. I've read about it. And this
  is the watcher's crib."</p>

  <p>He knocked at the door, but did not expect an answer. Leaving the girl in
  the shelter of the hut, he returned to collect Fred and the tools, and in a
  very short time they had wrenched open the lock and had entered the close-
  smelling cabin.</p>

  <p>It was surprisingly well furnished. There was a bed, a table, an easy-
  chair, and on a shelf a number of books. Evidently the guardian of this
  lonely rock only spent a few months of the year in his or her enforced
  exile.</p>

  <p>The small room leading off the main apartment was the kitchen. There was a
  Primus stove, but no immediate sign of food. By the time he had finished his
  inspection Mr. Conway had supported his sick-looking guest to the hut.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, this is very unfortunate," quavered the master of Con- lacto.
  "Terribly unfortunate! I'm not blaming you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" snarled Giles, but an appealing glance from the girl restrained
  him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we can get off here?" suggested Conway.</p>

  <p>"You can swim off," said Giles, more politely. "I don't know how near the
  mainland is, but I have an idea it's somewhere in the region of nine
  miles."</p>

  <p>"But we shall be seen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said Giles coolly. "Ships give this rock a wide berth. They
  hate it so much that they never look at it. My wireless is out of
  order&mdash;at any rate, we can't possibly be rescued until this storm
  ceases, and it looks like lasting two or three days."</p>

  <p>Conway's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but we shall starve!" he stammered. Giles looked at him with
  grave, thoughtful eyes. "Con-lacto is Strength," he said gently, and saw Mr.
  Conway wince and the face of Count Filitera lengthen.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow, we can't live on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Con-lacto," said Giles firmly. "Con-lacto is Health&mdash;a Meal in a
  Table Spoon&mdash;Vitality in a Wine Glass."</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway and the Count looked at one another, and in Josiah's eyes was a
  challenge.</p>

  <p>"I agree." His tone lacked heartiness, but his voice was firm. "And I am
  very glad, my dear Giles, that you remember the shibboleth of our&mdash;of
  my&mdash;in fact, of Con-lacto."</p>

  <p>"Con-lacto Builds Big Boys," said Giles mechanically.</p>

  <p>They retrieved the case from the aeroplane and brought it into the hut.
  Leslie's search of the kitchen had been most successful, for she had found,
  not only crockery and Spoons in a cupboard, but, most wonderful find of all,
  a large tin of tea and sugar, a round box of petrified cheese, and two
  unopened tins of biscuits.</p>

  <p>"We haven't any milk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One teaspoonful in a cup of tea," murmured Giles, avoiding her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What about you&mdash;er&mdash;Giles?" asked Conway diffidently, "In the
  circumstances we can hardly expect him to live on a diet
  he&mdash;urn&mdash;loathes."</p>

  <p>To the girl's amazement, Giles nodded.</p>

  <p>"Con-lacto for me&mdash;The Food of Giants," he said, and when the tin was
  opened he took a spoonful of the viscid mass and swallowed it without a
  grimace.</p>

  <p>And only then did Leslie Conway understand how he had come to win the
  Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway took up his teaspoon and looked long and earnestly at the white
  contents of the tin.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" he said, but there was no enthusiasm in his tone. "And what
  about you, my love?"</p>

  <p>"The biscuits and the tea, I think, will sustain me," she said. "They're
  sweet biscuits, too, and a box of cream cheese."</p>

  <p>Mr. Conway dipped in the spoon and filled it.</p>

  <p>"Not for me," said the Count hastily. "I have no hunger."</p>

  <p>"This will prevent hunger," said Mr. Conway gently.</p>

  <p>The Count swallowed, shaking his face many times in the process.</p>

  <p>When Giles went back to the 'plane, the gloomy Fred had important news for
  him.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake about the juice, sir: there's enough in No. 2 tank to
  get us to land as soon as the wind drops, and she ought to be able to take
  off from here; we're three hundred feet above sea-level, and after I've
  cleared away a few of these stones there's a straight run to the edge of the
  cliff."</p>

  <p>Giles waited to consult him about another matter, and returned with his
  news. The machine was not damaged at all, except that a couple of stays had
  been broken, but Fred had put these right. Giles consulted the girl.</p>

  <p>"You and your father had better sleep in the hut. This other bird can make
  himself comfortable in the kitchen, and Fred and I will use the saloon of the
  'plane."</p>

  <p>There was plenty of water on the island; great rain-pools were forming,
  but, better than this, attached to the hut, a filter-fitted water- butt. The
  first night spent on this island was alarming enough for the two men who
  slept in the 'plane. The wind increased in fury. Twice in the night they felt
  the 'plane moving under them, and made a hurried descent to strengthen its
  moorings; but the wind dropped before dawn, and though visibility was still
  bad, and it rained heavily, much of the discomfort of the marooned party
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Giles arrived at the hut to find two of his passengers at breakfast, and
  in time to witness the revolt of one of his passengers. He heard the Count's
  voice raised before he reached the hut.</p>

  <p>"I will not have it! It is muck! I would sooner starve! Last night I drank
  it, but it nearly killed me!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear you say that," said Mr. Conway gravely.</p>

  <p>He stirred the thick white contents of the tin and his face wore a
  thoughtful expression. "I'm sorry to hear you say that about Con-lacto. Don't
  you think it would be better if you followed friend Giles's example and took
  a tin with you so that you could eat it as you wished? Have you had your
  morning ration?"</p>

  <p>"At six o'clock," said Giles promptly, "and thoroughly enjoyed it!"</p>

  <p>Leslie was staring at the smirking young man.</p>

  <p>"If I may say so, I have never felt better in my life," he went on. "There
  is something about this concoction&mdash;and Heaven forgive me for my cruel
  doubts!&mdash;that puts vim and vigour into one. At first the taste is
  curiously sickly; then, as one feels one's needs supplied, there is a
  suavity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Mr. Conway absently.</p>

  <p>He took not quite a teaspoonful, looked at it for a long time, and pushed
  the spoon with a great effort into his mouth. Giles had the impression that
  he found some difficulty in swallowing.</p>

  <p>Later in the day Giles shared a secret cup of tea with the lady of his
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Do you really like that stuff?"</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful! I'm taking back all I said against Con-lacto. Fred is
  simply raving about it; he's going to take a tin back for his wife, and force
  her to eat it."</p>

  <p>Towards evening, Mr. Josiah Conway came to Giles with a sad story.</p>

  <p>"I am perfectly sure I saw that wretched foreigner throw a tin over the
  cliff. Something startled the seagulls."</p>

  <p>"That was Con-lacto," nodded Giles. "I can imagine nothing more
  startling."</p>

  <p>"And I found him," Mr. Conway went on soberly, "sucking
  eggs&mdash;seagulls' eggs!"</p>

  <p>Giles was interested. But before he could make any comment, Mr. Conway
  rounded off his information with a query.</p>

  <p>"Very dangerous, isn't it? Are they nutritious&mdash; seagulls' eggs?"</p>

  <p>"If you get them fresh. But I don't think they can be seagulls' eggs; it's
  rather early in the season."</p>

  <p>"They are not dangerous?" asked Mr. Conway anxiously. "Would you call
  them&mdash;um&mdash;nutritious?... A little fishy, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>At lunch-time he was missing from the festive board. Leslie munched her
  biscuit and cheese and drank her tea.</p>

  <p>"Daddy's taken his Con-lacto with him. He says it tastes better in the
  open."</p>

  <p>"I saw him as I came in," said Giles firmly.</p>

  <p>He did not wish to hurt her with a too vivid description of a middle- aged
  gentleman squatting behind a rock, entirely surrounded by the cracked shells
  of eggs ravished from maternal nests.</p>

  <p>The wind dropped very gradually. There was a sea fog the second day. By
  the third day, and when the Count and Mr. Conway were not on speaking terms,
  and when the sight of a tin of Con-lacto set Mr. Conway shuddering, the sea
  mist cleared off, and far away on the west they could distinguish a coast
  line.</p>

  <p>"We'll chance it," said Giles, after consultation with his mechanic.</p>

  <p>They packed their baggage again into the air-plane, all except one wooden
  case three parts full of circular tins.</p>

  <p>"I'd better take one of these," said Giles, pocketing it.</p>

  <p>"I think you're a hero!" she breathed. "And Daddy thinks so, too. He was
  saying this morning that a man with your power of&mdash;something or
  other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Digestion?" suggested Giles.</p>

  <p>"No; it was something rather nice... ought to be a partner. And really,
  darling, there must be something in it: I've never seen you looking
  better."</p>

  <p>"Con-lacto is Health," said Giles absently.</p>

  <p>They drew the aeroplane back as far as it would go, to give them a longer
  run, and, with the passengers locked in the saloon, Fred swung the propeller
  and clambered in-board. The engine ticked over for a little while, and then,
  with a deafening roar which was music to the pilot's ears, the big "prop"
  swung to a blur. Faster and faster the machine leapt forward, nearer and
  nearer to the edge of the cliff, and just before solid earth fell away from
  under the wheels, Giles felt her lift, and with a happy sigh turned her head
  for the mainland.</p>

  <p class="first">They found a car to take them to the nearest mainline
  station. Even then Leslie was not sure whether they were in Northumberland or
  Scotland. Just before she left, Leslie went in search of the mechanic to tip
  him.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, miss," he said, waving away the note.</p>

  <p>"It's a pleasure, I assure you. After all, I've done nothing&mdash;only me
  dooty. It might have been worse if there hadn't been any
  food&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You <i>do</i> like Con-lacto, don't you?"</p>

  <p>His face was a blank.</p>

  <p>"Con what, miss?"</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;the food in the little tin. Mr. Broad said you liked
  it."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"But," she insisted, "Mr. Conway had it."</p>

  <p>"I don't remember seeing it, miss; but, as I was saying, all them
  sandwiches my missus brought come in handy after all. They lasted me and Mr.
  Broad three days, which only shows that my wife's got the rummest ideas about
  a person's inside&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Leslie did not stop to listen. She hurled a fleeting "Hypocrite!" at
  Giles as she took farewell of him. But apparently she said nothing or did
  nothing to prevent her father nominating Giles Broad as a director of
  Con-lacto Limited, and did not so much as raise her voice in protest when Mr.
  Conway suggested that it wouldn't be a bad idea if a fellow like
  that&mdash;should be a member of the family...</p>
