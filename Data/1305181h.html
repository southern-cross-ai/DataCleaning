"could'nt", etc.; some of it, largely quotes, has been
modernised.</p>
<p>It is hoped that by making few corrections, the flavour of the
book has been preserved. A few errors&mdash;typographically
convincing&mdash;have been corrected.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">But</span> for respect to prescribed custom, I
should leave this book to be ushered into public presence under
the countenance of Patrick Leslie's silent introduction.</p>
<p>A preface, however, does shape itself into an easy chair for
the scruples of the most self-distrusting occupant from which he
may address himself in tendering the payment of a debt always
incurred by ordinary men to their neighbours in the attainment of
an end.</p>
<p>For my own relief I use it, therefore, for thanking those who
have, in all courteous sympathy, helped me to a short review of
times synchronous with the detachments of story to which this
first one hundred of Australia's years of self-assertion under
the Union Jack has committed her. By tradition of the past, in a
measure, Australia's habit may be characteristically caparisoned
in the future.</p>
<p>To the late Michael Fitzpatrick (awhile Premier of New South
Wales), and then to the unreserved and hearty acquiescence of
Henry Halloran and Deputy-Surveyor-General R.D. Fitzgerald, in
obtaining for me the perusal of many official documents, a
preface gives room for my grateful acknowledgments. These may
have forgotten; I have not.</p>
<p>Among the amenities of private intercourse, I am glad to thank
Philip Gidley King for enabling me to produce Journals of Allan
Cunningham, of which a record in full had been long fallow among
his family preserves; also the widow of the noble Carron, to
whose manhood I wish to pay tribute, and by her to his memory;
and her also who has honoured me by the permission to place this
neophyte beneath the tutelary presence of the same Patrick
Leslie.</p>
<p>To the boon of a public library, its able and energetic Chief
Librarian, R.C. Walker, and his considerate, cordial, and
courteous coadjutor, D.R. Hawley&mdash;not forgetting the
politeness of the active officials therein&mdash;I have now a
chance of bearing warm testimony.</p>
<p>To the <span class="u">friend</span> to whom I dedicate this
redemption of a pledge given to himself when in life, and who
procured for me the accompanying specimens of Cook's Log and
handiwork, it is too late to address myself. Those who inherit
his cherished name may accept my meaning and regret.</p>
<p>The chagrin shared with others now gone, that the days of
"our" Darling Downs, on which we breathed a then new element, and
revelled in the elastic aspirations of the squatter of the olden
time, should fade out of the freshness of their dawn; the aim,
that objects wrought out by single enterprise should be fixed to
the right name; the fear, that as years fall farther and farther
back, the impress of many a notable occurrence, whether affecting
time, place, or person, the progress of squatting exploration or
that of locality, might fall back with them into the haze of
forgotten or irrecoverable things, or, what is more fretting,
into the fogs of future distortion and assumption&mdash;have all
spurred this "small chronicler of his own small times" to present
himself to the "some few" yet living to whom the recital may yet
bring reflection, whether of personal interest or not; and to
those who follow, mindfulness of some worthies gone before, whose
names may plead the claim of whilom companionship and attachment
in bush or town, prosperity or adversity.</p>
<p>Out of the sunny years of <span class="u">her</span> who
called our Queensland into her lot, have the purer rays been shed
upon it which have lit up the latter, the happier half of
Australia's age.</p>
<p>May not the last, the youngest branch of Australia's growth,
bud out in hope, yet more loyally grafted upon the name of
<span class="u">her</span> who gave it as the days consolidate
its own Centenary?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p style="margin-left:20%;"><small>King Arthur made new knights
to fill the gap<br>
Left by the the Holy Quest.&mdash; <em>Tennyson</em>. (The Holy
Grail.)</small></p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Assuredly</span> the gallant Pedro Fernandez
de Quiros must have been possessed by some of the "sacred
madness" of King Arthur's bard when as he first gazed, as he
thought, upon the coral-gripped coast of the new land which King
Philip of Spain had sent him to seek, he shouted in reverent joy
with doffed sombrero: "Australia del Espiritu Santo!" But was
"Australia" the utterance, or was it "Tierra"? 'Twas not for de
Quiros to discover his own error. Choosing one course for further
discovery, he directed his Lieutenant to take another in the
second ship, and so they parted in 1606. Superstitious dread
prevailed over the discipline of his own, and he was compelled by
his mutinous men to return to Peru, which he reached in disgrace,
ever attendant upon failure. His Lieutenant, Luis Vaes de Torres,
soon found that the Admiral had saluted but an
island&mdash;probably one of the New Hebrides&mdash;continued his
course westwards, bore away along the south coast of New Guinea;
unwittingly fixed his eyes upon the true "Tierra Austral"; upon
the "very large islands" which the Cape, since called York,
presented to his bewildered sight, ere he stood away to the
north, threading his way through the mazy channel which exposed
his commander's mistake.</p>
<p>Torres had unconsciously fulfilled the Holy Quest. The memory
of and monument to his name are baptised and bathed by the
isle-fretted waters which bear it.</p>
<p>In John Bull justice did a native of our own British island
stamp "Torres" with his hand of authority as hydrographer to the
Admiralty upon that strange channel which had already begun to be
the promise of a grand highway claimed by, but not destined for
the sovereignty of that flag under which Torres had sailed.</p>
<p>The most authentic registration of Queensland's birth was thus
declared from the far north; her future growth was nourished and
confirmed from the far south. Among the first forms of a new
shore brought to light, she has derived her existence from that
which was delivered last by the labour of our Yorkshire
countryman, James Cook, Into the arms of our glad motherland.</p>
<p>But through what throes has the first colony planted in this
our Australia been nursed to its stature, that it may bear its
own part, and send forth its own offspring to bear theirs on the
great stage upon which in these years of grace, 1887-8, it and
they are summoned to enact the several characters allotted to
them, and as yet rehearsed by the help of the common prompting of
religion, race, kindred, and country.</p>
<p>It is by the finger-posts of incident in colonial life that
the tracks of a community's social rise and progressive ability
may be faithfully followed and run out, irrespective of the
governing element. Whether of good or evil, worthy or unworthy,
noble or ignoble report, the course of events proves a people's
character; whereas a religious and political history, even of a
new country, compiled from a mass of wrestling opinions, can be
taught and learnt but by the commonwealth's outcome up to a
present&mdash;a present which can find no end while the world
is.</p>
<p>The former&mdash;my task&mdash;is an easy one: the latter, one
which only rare ability and genius dare challenge. Yet the one
may allure the interest and amused attentiveness of the many, who
do not care to dig up or into the thirsty ground of theory, nor
sink into the quicksands of inquiry which cannot be
solidified.</p>
<p>For instance, who that dwells in this land of bright token can
take up an almanac, and fail to exult in his secret soul that on
the 20th day of January, 1788, our fellow countryman, Arthur
Phillip, had saved it for us "Britishers" but by a few days from
becoming the rightful refuge for the Frenchman's "folies"; that
two days after he had taken possession of the country in the name
of the United Kingdom, established his head-quarters on the
bay-sporting waters of Port Jackson, and in all chivalrous
courtesy "fended off" "l'Astrolabe" and "la Bussole" with their
gallant commanders, Jean Francois Galamp de la Perouse, and his
friend Delangle, to the less hospitable shores on which they met
their sad fates? Is the fact that the same month of the same
year&mdash;1788&mdash;hailed the birth in our realm of a people's
new and giant power&mdash;the power of the press, the fourth
estate&mdash;in a dingy room at Printing-House Square, whence on
the first of its days issued forth the first cry of the infant
<i>Times</i>, now stalking forth in strength equal to a nation's
leverage, worth no grateful glance? Can the nascent glow of
Australia's poetic aspirations bear no reflective companionship
with the spark which kindled the simultaneously new-born Byron's
genius? Are all incurious to the fact that Norfolk Island was
made a dependency of New South Wales on the 13th day of the month
following, under Lieutenant, afterwards Captain, and then
Governor King?</p>
<p>Is it not worth a glance that on the 26th of September, 1791,
Lieutenant-Governor, afterwards Governor King, had arrived in the
"Gorgon", having received our territorial seal, with authority to
grant pardons absolutely or conditionally? Nothing to any
housewife that in 1796 coals were being received in Sydney from
Newcastle? nor to the admirers of sea-bred pluck that Dr. Bass
had thrown open the straits which wear his name, and returned in
his whaleboat thence to Port Jackson in February, 1798? Are there
none now who would be surprised that until December, 1800, no
copper coin was in circulation in the colony? None now living who
may read with namesake interest the first noteworthy death in New
South Wales, that of Judge-Advocate Richard Dove; none to lift up
their eyebrows at the recorded name of his successor, Richard
Atkins?</p>
<p>And then, a smart step onward on March 5, 1803, The <i>Sydney
Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, published "by
authority", coupled with the drawback&mdash;important enough in
those days&mdash;of the report brought to Sydney by him to whom
the coast of New Holland had become so much indebted for
development, Matthew Flinders, of the loss of the "Porpoise" and
"Cato", upon his arrival within the Heads on September 8th, in an
open boat.</p>
<p>Is there no sensation attendant upon the announcement of
horrors presumably lawful (in the type of the period), and
tendered in a somewhat cynical regard for authority one day of
this year: "Memorable execution(!).&mdash;Joseph Samuels, for
burglary, was three times suspended; first, the rope separated;
second, it unrove at the fastening; third, it snapped short! The
Provost Marshal, Mr. Smith&mdash;a man universally
respected&mdash;compassionating the criminal's protracted
suffering, represented the case to the Governor, who was pleased
to reprieve him"?</p>
<p>Was there no thought for defence in those troublous days of
antipodean wars? Nor for light in those days of darkness? There
was; for on the 18th of July, 1816, Governor Macquarie laid the
first stones of the tower which makes his name redoubtable, and
of the South Head Lighthouse, pulled down not long ago, and then
put up again the brightest beacon of the seas! The old Seal, too,
worn out, not probably by the frequency of pardoning, but by
ceaseless attachments to hanging warrants, was replaced by a new
Territorial Seal, sent with a warrant, by the clemency of the
Prince Regent, in the November following.</p>
<p>Why should we decline to refresh our knowledge of the stirring
times during the chaotic reign of Governor Bligh for one year,
five months, and thirteen days; or mark the record of a new era
which set in with the arrival of John Thomas Bigge, the
Honourable Commissioner of Inquiry, consequent upon Bligh's
eviction, in the ship "John Barry", with his secretary, Thomas
Hobbes Scott, on the 25th September, 1819? Or, beginning already
to creep away to the northward, to mark that a gallant officer of
the 48th Regiment, Captain Allman, whose name is still held high
in Campbelltown esteem, and in our midst, in memory of a fine old
soldier and impartial magistrate, was sent forth to establish a
penal settlement at Port Macquarie?</p>
<p>Coming apace to household names of our own years, the
preaching of his introductory sermon by Dr. Lang in Sydney, on
June 8, 1823, will surely make many prick up their ears.</p>
<p>And how strangely it sounds now that on the 8th of the
preceding month Thomas McVitie was magistrate for the week! That
the harbour of Port Jackson presented "a novel and gay appearance
on the Sunday before, as six vessels were under sail at once!
Five to go through Torres Straits, Captain Peach, of H.M.S.
"Britomart", being commodore of the squadron; that this smart
vessel saluted Point Piper <i>en passant</i>, which was promptly
answered by our respected naval officer (and postmaster), Captain
Piper"!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p class="indent3">For not this man and that man, but all men
make up mankind, and their united tasks the task of mankind. How
often have we seen some adventurous and perhaps much-censured
wanderer light on some outlying, neglected, yet vitally momentous
province, the hidden treasures of which he first discovered, and
kept proclaiming till the general eye and effort were directed
thither, and the conquest was completed; thereby, in these his so
seemingly aimless rambles, planting new standards, founding new
habitable colonies in the immeasurable circumambient realm of
nothingness and night.&mdash;<i>Carlyle</i>. (Sartor
Resartus).</p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">How</span> fast within our first half century
did the necessities of New South Wales, with respect to the
classification of her criminals, and the infliction of secondary
punishment, compel her in her apparently dismal destiny's
fulfilment to work out under such degrading associations her sad
course; blindfolded to all considerations but those by which she
could render service to the old home by relieving it of the
presence of outcasts and ne'er-do-wells. The establishment of
these very depots of guilt became the direct guidance to the
exploration of this land. Let us see. Newcastle was the first
affiliated prison-house; but on the 11th of September of 1823 the
Government cutter "Mermaid"&mdash;which plays so frequent a part
on the north coast henceforth&mdash;sailed with stores to
Newcastle, from which dependency about forty prisoners were to be
transferred to that of Port Macquarie, as the former is to be no
longer considered a "place of banishment" for our felons; and on
the 16th of October, the Surveyor-General, John Oxley, had
received instructions from Governor Brisbane, upon the advice of
Commissioner Bigge, "to proceed northward as far as Port Bowen,
Port Curtis, and Moreton Bay; to examine them, and report as to
forming in each spot, if fit for the purpose, a new settlement,
to which all the convicts not usefully employed on the old
settlements, as well as the refractory and incorrigible, were to
be removed, and employed in the clearing and cultivation of land,
&amp;c., with the view, further, of removing to them, or any one
of them, the prisoners then stationed at Port Macquarie, which
from the excellence of the soil, the fineness of the climate, and
its convenient distance from Sydney, the Governor was desirous of
throwing open to free settlers."</p>
<p>And so, accompanied by Uniacke, the Surveyor-General proceeded
to Port Macquarie, which they found flourishing after its two
years' occupation; a town laid out in "streets of straight lines,
handsome esplanade, barracks for 150 soldiers, neat commodious
officers' quarters, comfortable huts of split wood, lathed,
plastered, and white-washed, for prisoners, garden attached to
each; fruit trees, maize, and sugar-cane growing very
luxuriantly," and natives of exceptionally fine mould mixing with
the whites in a most friendly manner, who in consideration of
being "victualled from the King's store", perform very efficient
duty as a constabulary, especially in pursuing and bringing back
runaways "dead or alive."</p>
<p>Their next visit was to Port Curtis; here they were not so
well pleased: harbour difficult, vegetation scanty, timber none
but what would do for firewood. They found no fresh water nearer
the shore than twelve or fourteen miles, in a rapid river which
they named the Boyne, up which they came to a succession of
rapids, the banks "highly picturesque, the hills covered with
wood, and the plains well grassed. The result, however, was that
the place was unsuitable, and that convict labor there would be
wholly thrown away."</p>
<p>So, on return, they entered Moreton Bay, discovered by Cook,
and visited by Flinders. Dropping anchor, a number of natives
rushed down to the shore, among them one who appeared much larger
in frame and lighter in colour than the others, who, advancing to
a point opposite to the "Mermaid", hailed her in English. A boat
was sent off, and as it drew towards them, the natives showed
many signs of joy, hugging this man, and dancing wildly around
him. He was perfectly naked, daubed all over with white and red
ochre. He was soon discovered to be an Englishman, and so
bewildered that little could be made of him that night. However,
on the morrow Uniacke took down his narrative in writing, and
this is by far the most curious and interesting paper in Barron
Field's collection. His name was Thomas Pamphlet; had set out
with three others&mdash;Richard Parsons, John Finnigan, and John
Thompson&mdash;from Sydney in a large open boat for Illawarra or
the Five Islands (at that time the popular name for that place)
to get cedar; met with a violent gale which lasted live; days,
which drove them, as they imagined, to the southward as far as
Van Dieman's Land. Under this delusion they kept to the
northward, suffered terribly from want of water for twenty-one
days; John Thompson died of thirst; then were wrecked on Moreton
Island, which they still believed to be to the south of Port
Jackson. Parsons and Finnigan insisted some six weeks before upon
another attempt northwards for Sydney; he had gone with them
about fifty miles, become too foot-sore to proceed, but got back
to this tribe&mdash;Parsons and Finnigan having quarrelled, the
latter also had returned, but was away at present on a hunting
excursion with the chief. Parsons had not since been heard
of.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It will be seen, however, that in January of
next year Parsons was discovered.]</p>
<p>Finnigan came in the following day; and, guided by their
information, Oxley proceeded in the whaleboat to examine the
mouth of the river which both had assured him ran into the south
end of Moreton Bay. By sunset of that day they had ascended this
river about twenty miles. The next day the satisfaction they had
at first felt increased. Oxley felt "justified in believing that
the sources of this river were not to be found in a mountainous
country, but rather that it flows from some lake which will prove
to be the receptacle of those interior streams crossed by me," he
observes, "during an expedition of discovery in 1818."</p>
<p>In a review upon three works which were published in London in
1826, viz., by W.C. Wentworth (1824), Edward Curr (1820), and
Barron Field (1825), appears the following: "The name given to
this important river is the Brisbane. That it derives its waters
from the lake or morass into which the Macquarie falls, and from
those numerous streams which were crossed by Oxley in 1818, all
running to the northward, seems a very reasonable supposition. He
was able to trace its course forty miles from its mouth, and he
could see in the same direction, viz., in the south-west, the
abrupt termination of the coast range of mountains; and the
distance from Moreton Bay to the lake or morass of the Macquarie
is not more than 300 miles. The discovery of this river may cause
those to hesitate who so positively assert that none of any
magnitude fall into the sea from New Holland. Captain Cook
discovered Moreton Bay; it was well known to Captain Flinders,
who anchored his vessel both above and below the mouth of this
river, and passed it twice in his boats, but it was concealed
from him by two low islands."</p>
<p>Pamphlet said that nothing could exceed the kind attention
paid by the natives to the shipwrecked seamen; they lodged them,
hunted and fished for them, and the women and children gathered
fern root for them, painted them twice a day, and would assuredly
have tattooed their bodies and "bored" their noses but for their
dislike to the process. Not only did these Moreton Bay natives
deal with them so kindly, they met with similar treatment among
all the tribes with whom they had met in their wanderings to the
north. Of the habit of boiling water they all seemed to be
ignorant. Pamphlet had saved a tin pot, in which, on one
occasion, he had heated some water; it began to boil, and the
anxiously-watching savages took to their heels, shouting and
screaming. They would not draw near again till he had poured it
away; nor were they, in his sojourn, ever reconciled to the
operation. Each aboriginal had the cartilage of the nose pierced;
many wore large pieces of bone or stick (supplanted in after days
by the white man's pipe) thrust through it. The women, as at
Sydney, had all lost the first two joints of the little finger of
the left hand, but the adults had not, as at Port Jackson, one of
the front teeth extracted. The women were daily busied in getting
"dingowa", fern root, for subsistence, and making bags of network
from rushes. The men made the fishing and kangaroo nets from the
bark of the kurrajong (<i>hibiscus heterophyllus</i>). The
fishing stations and grounds of each tribe were some few miles
apart; and they would change from one to another as the fishing
or game began to fail. Their huts were of wattle bent into an
arch, interwoven with boughs, covered with the bark of the tea
tree (<i>melaleuca armillaris</i>) and impervious to rain. Some
would hold ten or twelve persons. Pamphlet declared that during a
sojourn of seven months he never saw a woman struck or
ill-treated! The men would quarrel&mdash;their fights were
frequent, often ending fatally. The common usage was for a
champion on either side to fight it out fairly in a ring made for
the occasion. He saw one, he said, of these duels. At a spot
chosen was a circle about twenty-five feet in diameter, three
feet deep, and surrounded by a palisade of sticks. The two
combatants entered it, parleyed awhile with violent gestures,
plucked their spears from the ground; one was pierced through the
shoulder; he fell, and was carried off by his friends, the
lookers-on departing with loud shouts on all sides.
Reconciliation succeeded, and that again was hailed with loud
shouts, dancing, and wrestling, after which they all joined in a
general hunt for a week.</p>
<p>Instrumental in the discovery of the river Brisbane, these
white castaways have thus appeared upon the scene. Let us now
return to Port Jackson. We shall, for the first time, hear of one
whose name became a household word, not only in this colony, but
through his sons, in years afterwards, on Darling Downs. In the
person of Sir Francis Forbes, the bench attained the honour of a
Chief Justice who, by the brilliancy of his talents, shed new
light upon its records, as his estimable character and broad
philanthropy did upon the darker pages of the history of New
South Wales. It was the beginning of a new era in colonial being.
Captain Johnson, in his good ship the "Guildford", did deliver
upon these shores our first Chief Justice, his wife and family,
on the 5th of March, 1824. The same day the formal promulgation
of His Majesty's New Charter of Justice for the Colony of New
South Wales took place at the Government House, the Court House,
and the Market Place of Sydney, and the Chief Justice took his
seat on the bench. The 11th of the August following
proclaimed&mdash;as effacing what may be termed the martial
control&mdash;a Legislative Council, established by Royal
sign-manual, as being in existence under the hand and seal of the
Governor-in Chief; and in the same month was hailed the advent of
the first Solicitor-General and Commissioner of the Court of
Requests, John Stephen, with his family, in the "Prince Regent",
and the first Master-in-Chancery, John Carter, with his family,
in the same ship.</p>
<p>Another spurt Northward, Ho! through Torres Straits this time,
encircling Queensland and all that she contains, commemorates the
month of August, 1824, for H.M.S. "Tamar", commanded by Captain
Bremer, C.B., accompanied by the "Countess of Harrington", taking
a civil and military establishment, sailed for the north coast of
"Terra Australis" on the 24th, for the purpose of founding a new
settlement in the vicinity of Melville Island, which, with Port
Essington, becomes so much identified with a Queenslander's
retrospect, that the energies expended upon that spot should not,
with the settlements themselves, be abandoned through exhaustion.
Who can forget that Port Essington, at least, was Leichhardt's
refuge?</p>
<p>Pending the Melville Island expectations, let us see again
what part Moreton Bay is preparing to take in our Australian
programme.</p>
<p>In September we find our indefatigable Surveyor-General, John
Oxley, again at work. He has sailed in the brig "Amity" with a
civil establishment, prisoners, and stores, to plant a new
settlement somewhere in Moreton Bay. As a guard, a detachment of
the 40th regiment, the officer in command Lieutenant Butler. The
Commandant-elect, Lieutenant Miller of the same regiment; his
suite completed by a storekeeper, subordinate officers of various
designations, and a number of volunteers. The King's Botanist,
Cunningham, accompanies the Surveyor-General. Upon John Oxley
falls the responsibility of fixing upon the site most eligible
for this new dependency.</p>
<p>What says October of 1824 to the credit of our country?
Liberty of the Press! thanks to Sir Thomas Brisbane. The
publication of an independent weekly newspaper&mdash;the
<i>Australian</i>, on the 14th.</p>
<p>Trial by jury on the same day obtained in the Quarter Sessions
Court.</p>
<p>Did these boons follow in the Chief Justice's train?</p>
<p>Its 21st day brought back our brig "Amity", Captain Penson,
with the Surveyor-General and King's Botanist. Our new settlement
was established for the while on the very shores of Moreton Bay,
at a spot called Red Cliff Point, on its northern margin. It was
deemed peculiarly eligible, although it had drawbacks from want
of safe anchorage. Oxley went thence up the river about forty
miles beyond the place he had ascended it in December last. He
then gave his opinion that the river communicated with the
interior waters, and it was to be regretted (it was then said),
that no proof of that being a fact had been yet obtained.
However, his party found fish hitherto known only in the western
shed, and that circumstance afforded a strong presumption of the
surmised communication. The tree now known as the "Moreton Bay"
Pine (<i>Araucaria Cunninghamii</i>), was much noticed. The
King's Botanist, Cunningham, made extensive collections, and it
is remarkable "that most of the plants were of genera hitherto
supposed to be exclusively tropical."</p>
<p>It will be remembered that by the cutter "Mermaid" last year
had been rescued two men wrecked on Moreton Island, and that they
had spoken of one, Parsons, who had left them, and not
re-appeared. About a month before the arrival of the "Amity" on
this occasion, this man had returned to his old friends at the
mouth of the Pumice Stone River. He had been wandering among the
tribes of Hervey's Bay and the coast north of Moreton Bay ever
since he had left his comrade in misfortune. For two years his
dwelling among the blacks was an interesting story. In all
respects he declared he had been well and kindly dealt with.</p>
<p>Upon her return the "Amity" passed through the southern
passage into Moreton Bay, which took its name as the "Amity Point
Entrance", she being the first craft to make use of it. The
discovery of this approach shortened the distance by about fifty
miles to the river Brisbane.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Until the loss of the steamer "Sovereign", in
1847, it was the usual entrance, except in very heavy weather;
after that catastrophe it was for many years "tabooed".]</p>
<p>The colony must have made a fresh start on the 1st of
November, when the first Court of Quarter Sessions was held in
Sydney; and Moreton Bay must have been on "tip-toe" in the
expectation of a vice-regal visit, for on the 11th the same
staunch brig "Amity" conveyed His Excellency the
Governor-in-Chief (Sir Thomas Brisbane), the Chief Justice, and
the Surveyor-General to sea <i>en route</i> to the new
settlement, followed by her tender, the "Little Mars". Captain
John Macarthur and Francis Stephen, Clerk to the Council,
completed the pleasant party; pleasant, doubtless, in spite of
the weather, which in a fit of ill-humour kept them fourteen days
on the passage. The heavy gales and thunder-storms were spoken of
as terrible day after day, and night after night. They entered
the Bay by the north passage. The Governor and Chief Justice went
up the river some twenty-eight miles, were much struck by the
size of the trees on the banks, and pleased by what they saw. The
natives were beginning to be troublesome at Red-Cliff Point, by
continual thefts of tools, &amp;c. Sir Thomas had decided upon
removing the settlement to a spot about nine miles up the river,
which would be more convenient for shipping. The Chief Justice
had named the new site Edenglassie (Brisbane?). The "Amity" went
to sea by the southern passage, and returned to Port Jackson in
four days, on the 4th December.</p>
<p>In August of the year 1824, Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir James
John Gordon Bremer&mdash;in command of H.M.S. "Tamar", and
accompanied by the "Countess of Harcourt", Captain Bunn, left
Port Jackson for the north coast of Australia, and established
the first settlement thereon at Fort Dundas on Melville
Island.</p>
<p>Melville Island and Raffles Bay were the outcome of this
attempt for a few years, and afterwards Port Essington. The idea
of such an extension may be best expressed by the concluding
paragraph of Major Campbell's journal in the appendix. Clothed in
such an opinion, common sense, which thus weighed the
probabilities of the future, would find herself much
out-at-elbows in these days of democratic hatred of Indian,
Chinese, or Islander service. If she were suffered to look at
herself in the glass, she would hardly recognise her own
features, and would shrink from the ugly mask which some
"larrikin-spirit" hand has bedaubed them with during her long
nap.</p>
<p>We know how spasmodically&mdash;spasms of mercantile and
monetary panics&mdash;the eyes of Sydney used to be fascinated by
the enticement to hook on to the chain-trace which nature has
stretched across the Indian Ocean from our neighbours in the
hemisphere opposite.</p>
<p>To Queensland the existence of a settlement on the Cobourg
Peninsula has been, I think, an unappreciated boon as yet. Not
embraced by the area of her possessions, yet in reviewing the
track by which she came to where she is, Port Essington becomes
much identified with her career.</p>
<p>It was the suggestion of a direct overland connection with it
which at times so highly stimulated the appetite for its
realisation. The occupation of Darling Downs by Patrick Leslie
gave fresh strength to the desire: the question of such a
consummation became lively in town and bush. Port Essington was
the northern magnet of which the attraction energised the
gallantry of many an ambitious heart. Leichhardt would not, I
think, have so promptly tempted the intervening wilderness but
for the refuge ready for him at the end of his way.</p>
<p>So, out of Patrick Leslie's hands sprang the baby colony into
the cradle of Leichhardt's <i>chevaleresque</i> design; that
design was sketched perspectively through the focus which
concentrated Port Essington's distinctness of welcome. The
Cobourg Peninsula may yet have a grand part to play for the
benefit of the land of the south.</p>
<p>It was admitted that the object of the Government of that day
in despatching this expedition was "to open and preserve an
intercourse with the Malay coast, so as to encourage and
facilitate the spice trade." The latitude of the proposed
dependency was about 12 deg. S., and 130 deg. E. To be conveyed
thither by Captain Gordon Bremer were Captain Barlow of the 30th
Regiment (Buffs)&mdash;upon whom the superintendence was
eventually to devolve&mdash;Ensign Everard, twenty-four
non-commissioned officers and privates of the same regiment; Dr.
Turner, medical officer; George Miller, commissariat clerk in
charge of the duties of that department: George Wilson, whose
assistant was George Tollemache; and forty-four prisoners of the
crown as workmen and mechanics. The Government colonial brig
"Lady Nelson",** John, master, accompanied the "Tamar" and
"Countess of Harcourt".</p>
<p class="foot">[** The "Lady Nelson" was a brig of 60 tons,
brought from England by Lieutenant Grant, R.N., in 1800; built
with sliding keels, came out of Deadman's Dock, London, on
January 13th, 1800; laden at Gosport on February 9th, had
freeboard but 2ft. 9in., and looked so small for such a voyage
that she got the name of His Majesty's "Tinder Box".]</p>
<p>In the following March, 1825, the "Philip Dundas" from
Mauritius, brought news to Sydney that the "Countess of
Harcourt", after landing her stores at Fort Dundas, Melville
Island, had called at the Isle of France, <i>en route</i> to
England; had reported "all well" with Captain Gordon Bremer and
the new settlement so far. Houses sent in frame from Sydney had
been put together, a fort finished and seven guns mounted,
soldiers and prisoners well "hutted", the commissariat officer
Miller, getting a store completed. The official despatch from
Captain Gordon Bremer gave the following particulars: "Having
completed everything necessary for the expedition, sailed from
Port Jackson on the 24th of August, 1824, the ship 'Countess of
Harcourt', and the colonial brig 'Lady Nelson' in company. On the
28th, passed Moreton Island with a fair wind; from this period
running down the east coast, anchoring occasionally, until the
17th of September, when we passed Torres Straits, and on the 20th
at Port Essington, of which port and the coast between 129 deg.
and 130 deg. east longitude, I took possession in the name of the
King. On the 21st, at daylight, began examining the surrounding
shores of Port Essington, and despatched four boats in search of
fresh water. On the east side the country was much burnt up, the
soil sandy and thickly interspersed with red sandstone rock,
probably containing iron; trees of no great height, mostly like
those of New South Wales; no water found this day. On the 22nd
the search was again unsuccessful, but on the western side the
soil was better, the country more open, and the trees of
magnificent height. On Point Record a hole was found fenced round
with bamboo, containing a small quantity of thick or rather
brackish water, evidently the work of Malays, as the bamboo is
not indigenous in New Holland.* Traces of natives were also found
everywhere, but none made their appearance. Our parties had
penetrated in various directions considerably into the country,
but never found any water; however, there is no doubt that by
digging deep wells it might be obtained, yet the present apparent
scarcity much diminished the value of Port Essington.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the seventh chapter of Explorations in
North Australia, which appears in the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i> of the 7th May, 1887, by the Rev. J.E. Tenison-Woods,
mention is made of bamboo as indigenous, "which," however, "only
grows on a few Northern rivers," he observes.]</p>
<p>"It is, nevertheless, one of the most noble and beautiful
pieces of water that can be imagined, having a moderate depth,
with a capability of containing a whole navy in perfect security,
and is well worthy of His Majesty's Government, should they be
pleased to extend their establishment to this coast. On the 23rd,
as water had not been met with, and the season was advancing,
weighed and made sail for Apsley's Strait. On the 24th, made Cape
Van Dieman, and on the 26th entered the Strait and anchored off
Luxmore Head, when formal possession was taken of Melville and
Bathurst Islands. On the 27th, 28th, and 29th, boats were
despatched in search of water, other parties sinking wells on
both islands, without success. The wells produced a small
quantity muddy and slightly brackish.</p>
<p>"On the 30th I had the good fortune to find a running stream
in a cove about five miles to the southward of the ship, the
south-east point of which presented an excellent position for the
settlement, as it was moderately elevated and tolerably clear of
timber. The ships were immediately moved down to this cove, which
was named 'King's Cove', after the first discoverer of the
straits and islands; the point determined on to form the
settlement 'Point Barlow': and the whole anchorage 'Port
Cockburn', in honour of Vice-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, one of
the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>"On the 1st of October parties were sent on shore to clear the
ground and lay the foundation of a fort; and as it was probable
the Malays would visit the place in great numbers, and as much
hostility might be expected from the natives, who were, as we
could judge from the number of their fires on both sides, very
numerous, I was determined to render the fort as strong as the
means of the expedition would admit. Thermometer 84 deg. to 88
deg.</p>
<p>"On the 8th, began a pier for the purpose of landing
provisions, guns, &amp;c. From this period up to the 20th the
various works were carried on with such zeal, that the pier, one
bastion, and the sea-face of the fort were completed, and I had
the satisfaction, on the 21st of October, of hoisting His
Majesty's colours under a royal salute from two nine-pounder guns
and one twelve-pounder carronade mounted on 'Fort Dundas', which
I named in honour of the noble lord at the head of the Admiralty.
The pier is composed of immense heavy logs of timber and large
masses of sandstone rock; it is sixty-four feet long, eighteen
wide, and thirteen high at the end next low-water mark, and from
the solidity of the materials will probably last many years.</p>
<p>"On the 25th of October I had been several miles up a small
river in Bathurst Island, and on my return, near the entrance,
was surprised by the sudden appearance of ten natives, who had
waded&mdash;it being low water&mdash;across the river nearly to a
dry sandbank situated in its centre. They were armed with spears,
and at first seemed disposed to dispute the passage with us. On
our approach they retired towards the shore, which was thickly
covered with mangroves, and throwing down their spears, spread
their arms out to show us they intended nothing hostile,
accompanying the action with great volubility of tongue. I rowed
towards them, but they hastily retreated. However, after some
time they gained confidence, and advanced so near as to take a
handkerchief and some other trifles from the blade of an oar,
which was put towards them. I called the river, consequently,
'Intercourse River', and the point 'Point Interview'.</p>
<p>"The same afternoon two of our men, cutting timber and reeds,
were in an instant surrounded by a party of the natives, who
seized them, but offered no other violence than wresting their
axes from them. They had probably been watching some of our
parties in the wood, for they appeared to have a correct idea of
the value and use of the axe. As soon as our men were at liberty
they ran towards the fort&mdash;an alarm was given&mdash;the
soldiers seized their arms, and the savages would have suffered
had they not hastily retreated. I immediately went on shore with
Captain Barlow, and after going some distance, came up with the
natives, in number eighteen or twenty, with whom we soon
established communication by making signs of peace. They threw
down their spears and came forward with confidence; they,
nevertheless, kept some of the youngest in the rear, whose duty
seemed to be to collect the spears ready for action. We offered
them handkerchiefs, buttons, and other trifles, which they
accepted without hesitation, but after having satisfied their
curiosity they threw them away. They made many signs for axes,
imitating the action of cutting a tree, and accompanied it with
loud vociferations, and almost inconceivable rapidity of gesture.
They were given to understand they should have axes if they came
to the settlement, and so drew them near the fort, but no
inducement could get them into the clear ground or inside the
line of cottages. They had, I found, stolen three axes, but as we
were anxious to establish friendly relations, no notice was taken
of the theft; and three others were given to them, at which they
appeared highly pleased, especially the chief, to whom a broader
one than the rest was given, and who immediately examined the
edge, and with much delight showed his fellows that it was
sharper than theirs. They retired, and made their fire about half
a mile from us.</p>
<p>"On the 27th the same party re-appeared, accompanied by a
youth evidently of Malay origin, but even lighter in colour than
those people generally are. In his manners he was exactly like
the rest, and most probably had been taken by them when very
young. They seemed very anxious that we should notice him,
thrusting him forward several times when near us. I found they
had surprised two of our men, and taken from them an axe and a
reaping hook. These articles were of some value to us; our stock
was limited, and it became necessary to check the disposition for
theft. Therefore, on their making the usual signs for axes, they
were given to understand that we were displeased and that none
would be given.</p>
<p>"The young Malay, having the reaping-hook in his hand, it was
pointed to, and after some hesitation was given up; but the axe
was gone. I retired towards the fort. Finding they could, not get
the only object that they seemed to value, and our sentinels
being on the alert with fixed bayonets, of which they were much
afraid&mdash;they retired; but it was evident from their
brandished weapons they were dissatisfied and probably meant
mischief. We saw nothing of them until the 30th, when our boat at
the watering-place was surrounded by some twenty who sprang from
the bushes, but hesitated to attack on seeing the arms the crew
had. At the same moment another party equally numerous suddenly
appeared at a cottage in a garden which had been made by the
officers at a small distance from the water. It appeared that
only one of the young gentlemen and a corporal of marines were in
the house. They attempted to retreat, but were opposed by the
natives. The affair began to look serious, and they preparing to
throw their spears the corporal fired over their heads&mdash;(I
had given positive orders that except in cases of absolute
necessity they should not be fired upon)&mdash;upon which they
drew back and offered an opportunity for retreat. The corporal
loaded as he ran, firing repeatedly until the young gentleman
reached the boat, when a shower of spears were thrown from both
parties of the natives, some of which went into the boat, and one
grazed the midshipman's back. For the sake of sparing bloodshed
which would have followed another discharge of spears, the
corporal then selected the chief for punishment, and fired
directly at him; he Immediately fell or threw himself on the
ground&mdash;which several others Instantly did on seeing the
flash&mdash;but it was most probable that he was struck, for he
did not rise so quickly as the rest, and the whole party ran Into
the wood. None have since been seen in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"These people were above the middle height, their limbs
straight and well-formed, possessing wonderful elasticity; not
strongly made, the stoutest had but little muscle, their activity
was astonishing, their colour nearly black, their hair coarse but
not woolly, tied occasionally in a knot behind, and some had
daubed their heads and bodies with red or yellow pigment. They
were almost all marked with a kind of tattoo, generally in three
lines, the centre one going directly down the body from the neck
to the navel, the others drawn from the outside of the breast and
approaching the perpendicular line at the bottom. The skin
appeared to have been cut in order to admit some substance Into
it, and then bound down until It healed, leaving small raised
marks on the surface. The men were entirely naked, but we saw at
Bathurst Island two women at a little distance who had small mats
of plaited grass or rushes round the body. Their arms were the
spear and waddy. The former is a slight shaft well hardened by
fire, about nine or ten feet long; those we saw generally had a
smooth sharp point, but they have others which are
barbed&mdash;deadly weapons. One of them was thrown at us, and I
have preserved it; it is very ingeniously made, the barbs being
cut out of the solid wood; they are seventeen in number, the
edges and points exceedingly sharp; they are on one side of the
spear only. As they had no iron implements or tools it is
wonderful that they can contrive to produce such a weapon. We saw
but few of these barbed spears, and it is probable that they cost
so much labour in making that they are preserved for close combat
or extraordinary occasions. They did not use the wommerah or
throwing-stick, so general in New South Wales. The waddy or short
pointed stick was smaller than those seen in the neighbourhood of
Sydney, and was evidently used in close fight as well as for
bringing down birds or animals for food. They throw this stick
with such wonderful precision that they never fail to strike a
bird on the top of the highest tree with as much certainty as we
could with our best fowling pieces. In their habits these people
much resemble the natives of New South Wales, but they are
superior in person, and if the covering of the women is general
it is a mark of decency and a step towards civilisation perfectly
unknown to the inhabitants of the east coast. The hallowing and
decoration of a sepulture is such an acknowledgment of a supreme
power and a future state that it appears evident that the notions
of this people on this subject are by no means so rude and
barbarous as those we have been accustomed to find amongst the
New Hollanders generally.</p>
<p>"On Bathurst Island we found the tomb of a native; the
situation was one of such perfect retirement and repose that it
displayed considerable feeling in the survivors who placed it
there; and the simple order which pervaded the spot would not
have disgraced a civilised people. It was an oblong square open
at the foot, the remaining end and sides being railed round with
trees seven or eight feet high, some of which were carved with a
stone or shell, and further ornamented by rings of wood also
carved. On the tops of these posts were placed the waddies of the
deceased; the grave was raised above the level of the earth, but
the raised part was not more than three feet long. At the head
was placed a piece of a canoe and a spear, and round the grave
were several little baskets made of the fan palm leaf, which from
their small size we thought had been placed there by the children
of the departed. Nothing could exceed the neatness of the whole;
the sand and the earth were cleared away from its sides, and not
a scrub or weed was suffered to grow within the area.</p>
<p>"The pier having been finished on the 21st, the party employed
on that service and the whole strength of the expedition was
directed to the fort, and completing the different works.</p>
<p>"On the 2nd of November commenced building a magazine. On the
7th the Commissariat store-house was finished; and by the 8th the
whole of the provisions, stores, and necessaries were landed from
the 'Harcourt', and properly secured therein. This store-house is
built of wood, well thatched, and fully equal to the occasion
until a more regular and substantial one can be built. It
contains nearly eighteen months' provisions. The fort, which
commands the whole anchorage&mdash;the shot from it reaching
across to Bathurst Island&mdash;was completed (with the exception
of the ditch) on the 9th of November. It is composed of timbers
of great weight and solidity in layers live feet in thickness at
the base; the height of the work inside is six feet, surrounded
by a ditch ten feet deep and fifteen feet wide; on it are mounted
two nine-pounder boat guns to shift on occasion, and to be put on
board the 'Lady Nelson' when it is necessary to detach her to the
neighbouring islands or for other purposes. Those guns are
provided with fifty rounds of round and grape, and are part of
the upper-deck guns of this ship. The fort is rectangular, its
sides being seventy-five yards by fifty: in this square are the
houses for the commandant and the officers of the garrison, and a
barrack for the soldiers is to be put into immediate progress.
The soldiers and convicts have built themselves good and
comfortable cottages near the fort.</p>
<p>"The climate of these islands is one of the best that can be
found between the tropics: the thermometer rarely reaching 88
deg., and in the morning at dawn sometimes falling to 76 deg.
Nothing can be more delightful than this part of the twenty-four
hours. I was obliged, by necessity, with the whole of the ship's
company, to be constantly exposed to a vertical sun, but
fortunately few have suffered, and none very severely.</p>
<p>"The soil of this island appears to be excellent. In digging a
deep well for the use of the settlement we found a vegetable
mould about two feet deep; then soft sandstone rock, occasionally
mixed with strata of red clay, until the depth of thirty feet,
when we came to a vein of yellow clay and gravel through which an
abundance of water instantly sprang, and rose to the height of
six feet.</p>
<p>"It is probable that this soil is capable of producing
most&mdash;if not all&mdash;the tropical fruits and shrubs of the
Eastern Islands. The plants brought from Sydney flourish
luxuriantly, particularly the orange, lemon, lime, banana, and
sugar-cane. Melons and pumpkins spring up immediately, and the
maize was above ground on the fourth day after it was sown.</p>
<p>"We found the stream of water first discovered to run into
several ponds near the beach&mdash;which affords to ships an easy
mode of watering&mdash;and, no doubt, valuable rice plantations
may be formed in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"Amongst the trees, some of which are of noble growth, I found
a sort of lignum vitae, which, probably, will be valuable for
block-sheaves; and several others, which appear to be calculated
for naval purposes. The forests are almost inexhaustible. A sort
of cotton tree was also found in considerable numbers, but not
being certain of its produce being valuable, I have sent a sample
to England for inspection. We likewise found the bastard nutmeg,
and a species of pepper highly pungent and aromatic. The trepang
has not been found here. The fish taken in the seine are mullet,
a sort of bass, and what is most abundant is that which seamen
call the 'Old-Wife'. Our supply of fish is very precarious, being
sometimes a week without taking sufficient for everybody. At Port
Essington, on the contrary, we always filled the seine at a
haul.</p>
<p>"The animals we have seen on this island are the kangaroo, the
opossum, the native dog, the bandicoot, the kangaroo rat, and the
flying squirrel. The birds are pheasants, quail, pigeons,
parrots, curlews, a sort of snipe, and a species of moor-fowl.
The venomous reptiles are few: some snakes have been found,
which, from the flattened head and fang, were evidently
poisonous; centipedes, scorpions, and tarantulas are by no means
numerous. The mosquito, as is usual in all new and tropical
countries, is exceedingly active and troublesome; and a sandfly
not larger than a grain of sand is so extraordinarily venomous
that scarcely anyone in the ship or expedition has escaped
without bites from these insects, which have in many instances
produced tedious and painful ulcers.</p>
<p>"Port Cockburn Is one of the finest harbours I ever saw, and
is capable of containing almost an unlimited number of shipping
of any draught of water, and is completely secured from every
wind that blows.</p>
<p>"On the 10th of November, the defences of Fort Dundas being
quite equal to an attack from much more formidable enemies than
the natives of Melville Island, I determined to proceed in the
further execution of the orders I had received from the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty. I gave charge of the settlement
to Captain Maurice Barlow, and placed Lieutenant Williamson and
his detachment, of Royal Marines under the command of that
officer.</p>
<p>"Weighed and dropped into the fair-way, and was saluted by
fifteen guns from the garrison, which was returned from this
ship.</p>
<p>"On the 11th and 12th employed getting ready for sea, and
finally sailed from Port Cockburn on the 13th, the ship 'Countess
of Harcourt' in company: the latter for Mauritius and England:
H.M.S. 'Tamar' for India."</p>
<p>I may here gratify myself at least by bearing witness, through
documents of authority, to the value of an old friend in the
public service, whose merits&mdash;at so great a distance from
the seat of authority&mdash;were so tardily and scantily
acknowledged; and when acknowledged, were so shabbily waived.
Smith, of London, had better friends there than George Miller, of
New South Wales.</p>

<p>In order to keep the doings on the north coast in sight, I
must make a hop from 1824 to 1838. Captain Sir Gordon Bremer, in
command of H.M.S. "Alligator", accompanied by Lieutenant Owen
Stanley, in H.M.S. "Britomart", the latter having arrived in Port
Jackson on the 15th July, 1838, had received instructions to make
another effort to make a permanent military depôt at Port
Essington. The gratifying intelligence was hopefully discussed
again in Sydney; commercial prospects brightened.</p>
<p>The names attached to the address presented to the commander
of the "Alligator", on the 22nd of August, may recall many a
familiar face and pleasant acquaintance. Two only, perhaps, are
yet amongst us. It was presented to Sir Gordon Bremer, on the
quarterdeck of H.M.S. "Alligator".</p>
<blockquote>"To Sir J.J. Gordon Bremer, Captain R.N., K.C.B.,
C.B., &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"We, the undersigned merchants and gentlemen, residing in this
colony, take leave to congratulate you on your second visit to
our shores, and to offer you our sincere good wishes for the
success and prosperity of the new settlement at Port Essington,
for the purpose of founding which you have been again selected by
His Majesty's Government, and to express our admiration of the
zeal and enterprise which have induced you, under many trying
circumstances, to undertake this arduous adventure.<br>
<br>
"We need hardly assure you of the deep interest we naturally feel
in the formation and progress of another dependency in this vast
continent; its welfare promoted by the auspices of our parent
state, and supported by the industry and capital of Great
Britain.<br>
<br>
"But we desire to convey to you more especially our hope that the
settlement which you are about to re-establish may speedily
emulate in prosperity this old appendage of the British Crown,
and the conviction that she will also become a very important
entrepot for the products of trade with the islands of the
Eastern Archipelago.<br>
<br>
"That your health, and that of the officers and men under your
command may be preserved through the trials always attendant upon
the formation of a new settlement, and that you may be eventually
rewarded by its complete and permanent success is the sincere
wish of<br>

<div class="quote">"Sydney, August 22, 1838."</div>
<br>
<p>In honor, it may be presumed, of the occasion, our old friend
"Isabella" becomes wedded to the new settlement, and sails
thereunto, in duty bound, as the "Essington", ahead of the squad
of vessels belonging to the expedition, in September.</p>
<p>The most interesting (being autographical) memorial of the
second attempt at consolidating an establishment at Port
Essington after the abandonment of its neighbours on the right
hand and on the left that I have preserved is that contained in a
letter from Sir Gordon Bremer to Governor Sir George Gipps. Port
Essington itself was abandoned soon after it had done one good
service to the country in sheltering and resuscitating Leichhardt
and his band. As soon as New South Wales had obtained the
gratification of her desire of years, its object was effaced. The
interest which its name once so roused lies dormant: nursing,
perhaps, but the occasion to fulfil the promise which Port
Essington once held out, the future may yet have that occasion in
store.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"Victoria, Port Essington, March
17, 1839,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>"My dear Sir George,<br>
<br>
"You will doubtless wonder that you have been so long without
accounts from me. Our communication by the 'Orontes" (the
transport) on which I dwelt as a certainty, was cut off by the
wreck of that ship on a reef some distance from the entrance of
the harbour. As usual with these sort of craft, neither
<em>lead</em> or <em>lookout</em>. The crew are still with me
here. The master and his wife are departed for Coepang, <i>en
route</i> to India. The 'Essington' schooner sails to-day for the
Islands, thence to Coepang, and finally to Sydney, but as I have
it in serious contemplation to visit you the moment the arrival
of the 'Beagle' or any despatches will open my views a little, I
forbear to send you any public letters. They must necessarily be
voluminous, and I hope to be at Sydney in ten or twelve days
after the schooner. I am anxious to confer with you on so many
points connected with this valuable and important addition to our
colonies, that I feel the necessity of personal communication.
You may remember that I sailed on the 17th September; on the 20th
October Cape York was taken possession of and the Queen's colours
hoisted. I had always supposed this to be a barren land; I was
therefore delighted to find a country actually beautiful. The
summit of the Cape is about 500 feet high; on the S.E. side the
ascent is rough and vegetation has as usual been stunted by the
constant winds, but looking down on the western, a plain about
six or seven miles wide and extending far south, presented a
scene which reminded me of some of the finest portions of India;
it seemed teeming with luxuriance. We landed in a beautiful bay
alongside a natural pier, with three and four fathoms
water&mdash;close to. The ship lay in nine fathoms about two
miles off, but she might have approached <i>ad libitum</i>. The
Albany Islands seem adapted for cattle, having even then at the
very end of the dry season abundance of grass and few trees; this
will ultimately be an admirable position for a settlement, in the
direct route through the Straits close to New Guinea, and
surrounded by a group of islands, which must possess valuable
articles of export. On the 27th I reached this place, and
commenced our anxious search for that indispensable
requisite&mdash;water. It was also important to fix on a position
suitable as to approach from ships, and for landing our guns and
stores. It was not, therefore, until the 3rd November that I had
finished my inspection of the harbour and decided on this spot.
It is a very pretty piece of land of considerable elevation. The
north head, which I call Minto Head, is seventy-six feet above
the sea, with a steep rocky point. On it I have placed a battery
of four eighteen-pounder guns, two mortars, and a block house of
twenty feet square with a pivot eighteen-pounder. The south head
is fifty-five feet high, also unapproachable from the sea; on it
there are already four eighteen-pounders. These heads form the
widest portion of a neck of land which gently falls towards the
interior&mdash;the area which is enclosed in it is just
eighty-five acres. The soil all around us is as fine as can be
imagined, indeed in many parts <i>exceedingly</i> rich from the
immense quantity of vegetable matter decomposed yearly. The trees
in our immediate neighbourhood are not large, and scarcely one is
perfectly sound; this I ascribe as much to the thick shade as to
the effects of the white ants, which are in swarms, but we find
that they diminish as we clear the ground.<br>
<br>
"It is astonishing to witness the rapid change which is daily
discoverable. Our Hospital, store-room, my own house, and
officers' quarters are finished and inhabited; they form very
pretty buildings. I have a pier extending to low water mark, 140
feet long; and it is really a surprising work. I have a
dock-yard, with boat-houses, blacksmiths' shop, mast-house, and I
am now getting on with a provision store. The marines have built
as pretty cottages as an English village can shew; several of the
officers have also their cottages, and in all I encourage the
cultivation of garden ground&mdash;we have not yet derived much
benefit from our public garden. I fear my botanist is too great a
gentleman (in his own opinion) to grow cabbages and pumpkins, but
the latter are becoming abundant in the gardens of the men. By
means of the 'Essington' we have been tolerably well supplied
with fresh meat. I hope she will come up to us again.<br>
<br>
"Port Essington is certainly one of the finest pieces of water in
the world. In the inner harbour the 'Alligator' lies in nineteen
feet at the lowest spring tide within hail of the pier. About two
miles off is the anchorage capable of containing fifty sail of
the line in seven fathoms.<br>
<br>
"As regards fresh water, we have an abundance, and of delicious
quality. I have four wells already in work, which supplied us
amply before the rains, and are now overflowing; there are
several pretty streams within a mile or two, and the flats or
meadows which almost surround us are now considerably flooded.
They would produce rice in extreme abundance, while spices,
cotton, and almost all tropical valuable articles, I am
convinced, may be cultivated with success. The climate is
certainly extraordinary; we have not had one case of actual
sickness since we came here. The 'Britomart' has buried two men;
one of them was consumptive when he left England, and would have
died; the other went off in an apoplectic fit. The heat in the
middle of the day is sometimes extreme, reaching 95 deg., but it
is the least oppressive I have ever met with&mdash;it is a pure
ethereal heat, while the nights and mornings are generally
delicious. I write to you at half-past seven, the thermometer
before me stands at 76 deg., while the last of the land wind
brings its sweets from flowers, which at this season are
beautiful. One large boat is constantly surveying. On her passage
to Raffles Bay to ascertain the condition of the old settlement,
she entered the opening between <i>Point Smith</i> and the N.W.
point of Raffles Bay, which Captain King had not opportunity to
examine. The lieutenant discovered that It is the entrance to one
of the finest harbours in Australia, which has been admirably
surveyed, and to which the officers have been kind enough to give
my name, calling it Port Bremer. The bottom and west side of this
harbour is not more than three miles from Table Head, in Port
Essington, the country between them excellent. The west side of
Raffles Bay is also not more than two miles from the east side of
the port, so that we are as it were a continuous chain of
harbours. I have no doubt that good anchorage, if not a good
harbour, is to be found in Trepang Bay. In short, the
capabilities of this noble place are daily developing.<br>
<br>
"I have just returned from a most interesting cruise in the
'Britomart', having visited the islands Moa, Letti, and Kissa (I
was twice at the latter). There was subject of infinite pleasure.
I found the Dutch missionaries very excellent men, and apparently
labouring with abundant zeal in the good cause; they are,
however, grievously neglected by the Dutch Government, having
been upwards of two years without the slightest communication,
even with Coepang. It really was a distressing thing to witness
the thankfulness with which these men&mdash;European
gentlemen&mdash;received the slop shoes and stockings I supplied
them with, together with wine, needles, thread, and, in short,
every article of comfort I could discover they required. The
population of Kissa is upwards of 7,000, 1,500 of whom are
Christians. Letti contains 6,000, of whom 900 are Christians;
while Moa, the largest and most beautiful of the islands, has
only 500 persons of our faith. Their churches are neat little
edifices, reminding me of some of the very old places of worship
in the north of England.<br>
<br>
"After leaving Kissa, I proceeded to Dilly, in Timor, where I was
received by the Governor with every possible respect and
attention. I was fortunate in this visit, as a vessel about to
sail afforded me an opportunity of writing to Mr. Bonham at
Singapore, requesting him to forward me during the N.W. monsoon
all papers, letters, &amp;c., by way of Dilly. I find the
communication perfectly easy, and you will be surprised when I
tell you that by means of the Singapore papers I had extracts
from the <em>London News</em> of the 12th September, 1838, on my
table here on the 1st February, 1839; this is easily accounted
for by the rapid flight of letters and papers from England to
Bombay, and thence to Singapore. I receive from the Dutch
residents most complimentary letters and offers of service, but
from private information I am led to think they view us with
extreme jealousy.<br>
<br>
"The desire for British calico goods, for brass wire, iron, and
other hardware amongst the islands is astonishing. They have
abundance of cattle, fruit, fowls, yams, &amp;c., and some corn.
I established a regular market. For our cotton handkerchiefs,
value 6d., two fowls; for four inches of brass wire, a good
pumpkin or melon; for four yards of coarse calico, a pig, and so
on; but they have tortoise-shell, wax, and other valuable
articles. I learned that a man saved from the schooner
'Stedcombe', wrecked on Timor coast several years ago, was seen
and spoken with in February, 1838. He told the person (who was
the master of a small schooner) that two Dutch men-of-war brigs
had visited the island; that he had endeavoured to excite the
compassion of the commanders, but they refused to listen to him
although he repeatedly told them he was an Englishman. I have, in
consequence, sent the 'Britomart' thither to reconnoitre the
place, and have directed my first lieutenant who is in her to use
his discretion in taking means to recover the man, and as the
natives are very numerous and very fierce, not to hazard an
attack. I will put them to rights in the 'Alligator', if
necessary. The 'Britomart' then proceeds to the Arra Islands,
which have probably never been visited by English vessels,
certainly not by ships of war, and I anticipate a most
interesting account.<br>
<br>
"One subject of high satisfaction to me is that we have never had
even an angry word with the natives; they are constantly about us
in numbers, and are useful to us, bringing fish, grass, honey,
and a sort of bean&mdash;their confidence in us is
astonishing.<br>
<br>
"One of them went with me in the brig, and another is now in her
on her present voyage. In conclusion, my dear Sir George, I
cannot but congratulate you, and myself, on the complete and
perfect success of my undertaking&mdash;this place cannot fail to
become most valuable; in truth, I anticipate that in a few years
it will be the Singapore of Australia. I look forward with great
pleasure to the prospect of meeting you. I have an infinity of
important matter to discuss with you. I only await the arrival of
the 'Beagle', or other vessel to determine me.<br>
<br>
"I hope that the middle of June will afford me an opportunity of
repeating that, I am,<br>

<p>Sir James John Gordon Bremer, K.C.B., created 1841; K.C. and
Knight Bachelor, created 1836; married in 1811 Mrs. C. Glasse, of
Rochester; was made lieutenant in the navy in 1805; commander in
1807; in 1812 captured the "Bon Génie", privateer; in 1813 took
an American letter of marque of 280 tons; became post-captain in
1814; was appointed to the "Comus", 22 guns, in 1816, which was
lost off Newfoundland in October of that year; to the "Tamar", 26
guns, was despatched to form a settlement on Melville Island;
returned to England in 1827; was appointed to the "Alligator", 26
guns, on the East India station, in 1837.</p>
<p>So closely is Owen Stanley associated in my first
recollections of Sydney with Port Essington, that I cannot keep
his name apart from that of the settlement, of the prospects of
which Sir Gordon Bremer makes so high an estimate in this
letter.</p>
<p>Owen Stanley had been promoted to the rank of commander on the
26th of March, 1839, and had aided, in the "Britomart", in
forming the new colony on which Sydney afterwards built such
grand hopes. He was a son of the then Bishop of Norwich, born on
the 13th June, 1811; entered the Royal Naval College 5th August,
1824; embarked as volunteer in the "Druid" frigate, 8th January,
1826, and in the following March was midshipman on board the
"Ganges", 84, then fitting for the flag of Sir Robert Waller
Otway, commander-in-chief in S. America, whence he was removed in
December, 1829, to the "Tartar", 44. In January, 1830, he joined
the "Adventure", sloop, Captain Philip Parker King, employed in
surveying the Straits of Magellan. On his return to England the
following November, he became mate to the "Belvidere", 42, and to
the "Rainbow", 28&mdash;Captains, the Honourable Richard Sanders
Dundas and Sir John Franklin&mdash;both in the Mediterranean in
1831; then to the "Kent", 78; the "Procris", 10; the "Malabar",
74; and the "Mastiff", 6, in succession, all in the
Mediterranean. In 1836, 11th May, he was appointed to the
"Terror", and on the 21st December, 1837, to the command of the
"Britomart", in which he remained until the 27th April, 1843. In
the interval, having aided at Port Essington, he made a track
survey of the Arafura Sea, &amp;c. He then became post-captain in
1844, on September 23rd, since when he commanded the surveying
ship "Rattlesnake", in which he made many valuable additions to
hydrography, especially in the examination of Simon's Bay, the
inner route through Torres Straits from Dunk Island to Bligh's
Farewell; his last work being the survey of the south-east coast
of New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago. F.R.S., F.R.A.S.
Captain Stanley died at Sydney on the 10th March, 1850. Before
his coming into Port Jackson, he had heard at Cape York of a
brother's death: on anchoring, of his father's. He was buried in
the North Shore cemetery.</p>
<p>While lying at Cape York in the preceding October, a watering
party from the "Rattlesnake" brought off a white woman and some
of a tribe who had come over from Prince of Wales Island to the
mainland. Upon coming on board, she could scarcely make it
understood that she wished to be rescued from the natives, as she
had almost forgotten the English language. Her maiden name had
been Barbara Crawford, daughter of a tinman, a Scotchman residing
in Sydney, who had arrived in the "John Barry" as an immigrant:
had married a man named Thompson at Moreton Bay, which she left
with him and some other men in a small cutter called the
"American" for Port Essington, where they wished to settle. They
were cast away on Prince of Wales Island, and all but herself
drowned. The natives had treated her very humanely for the five
years she had been with them, but refused until now to allow her
to communicate with any passing vessels.</p>
<p>Having seen the "Rattlesnake" anchored at Cape York, she
induced them to take her on board, saying she wished to shake
hands with her countrymen. Captain Stanley rewarded the blacks
liberally. From her much information was received as to the
manners and customs of the islanders of Torres Straits.</p>
<p>Port Essington had been discovered by Captain P.P. King, in
the cutter "Mermaid" (84 tons, 56 ft. in length, beam 18 ft. 6
in.), on the 23rd of April, 1818, and so-named in honour of the
"late Vice-Admiral Sir William Essington, K.C.B."</p>
<p>"As a harbour," writes Captain King, in his narrative
published in 1824, "Port Essington is equal, if not superior, to
any I ever saw, and from its proximity to the Moluccas and New
Guinea, and its being in the direct line of communication between
Port Jackson and India, as well as from its commanding situation
with respect to the passage through Torres Straits, it must, at
no very distant period, become a place of great trade, and of
considerable importance."</p>
<p>How little the pledges of success given by the reports made
about the settlements on the Northern Coast of South Australian
Territory have been redeemed, twenty-five years after the first
stick had been cut and laid for Fort Dundas, on Melville Island,
proved in a manner unpalatable to the promoters of the early
schemes for extending trade. It remains for Port Darwin, which
may claim to be one of the group, to bring about in due time the
honour so long deferred to each flattering earnest. There is
something to wonder at, and attract to the spot at which our
Mercury takes his first sub-marine plunge upon our Australian
errands. In sombre contrast with the gay colouring of Sir Gordon
Bremer's descriptions do we find the shadows which had
successively fallen upon each nest of dwelling-places, which
spoke of the building, but from which the birds had flown, in the
year 1847. On the 9th of November, Port Essington was declared by
Captain Stanley&mdash;according to Macgillivray's
Narrative&mdash;to be insalubrious; to give no hope nor promise
of improvement: men sick; provisions bad and scanty; the site of
Victoria injudicious and unhealthy. The first step had been taken
by Captain G. Bremer on the 20th September, 1824, in H.M.S.
"Tamar", at Port Essington. For want of water he at once had gone
on to Melville Island, and founded Fort Dundas, on the Apsley
Strait. Four years afterwards&mdash;31 March, 1829&mdash;this had
been deserted. Government still persisting in the desire to plant
firm foot in these quarters, Captain Stirling, in H.M.S.
"Success", had the gratification of finding a nook in the
neighbourhood which seemed to be, and proved to be free from
disadvantages which had as yet impeded the progress of the past
speculations. This had been at Port Raffles, and was denoted by
the erection of Fort Wellington&mdash;on 18th June, and when the
kernel of this Colony had begun to mature into a really
flourishing state of sound health, sudden orders&mdash;unexpected
and unaccountable&mdash;had been received for its entire
abandonment, which had been effected by the 29th August,
1829.</p>
<p>Eight years afterwards Government had a fourth time resolved
upon an establishment on the north coast with the twofold object
of affording "shelter to crews wrecked in Torres Straits, and
endeavouring to throw open to British enterprise the neighbouring
islands of the Indian Archipelago." Thus had Captain Sir G.
Bremer been again sent forth on the 27th October, 1837, to
re-form a settlement at Port Essington, whence he wrote the
letter given already. Subsequently, the "Alligator" having left.
Captain John Macarthur, with a subaltern and forty men of the
Royal Marines, was left in charge. The "Britomart" remained
several years as a tender to the military post, and was succeeded
by H.M.S. "Royalist". In October, 1845, the remains of the
original party, which had been there for seven years (including
also a small detachment sent down from China), were relieved by a
draft from England of two subalterns, an assistant surgeon, and
fifty-two men of the Royal Marines; Captain Macarthur still
remaining in charge; "and now" says Macgillivray, "after the
settlement has been established for eleven years, they were not
even able to keep themselves in fresh vegetables." And so Port
Essington was finally abandoned on November 30, 1849, when all
was removed to Sydney by H.M.S. "M&oelig;ander", commanded by
Captain the Honourable H. Keppel.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p>The year 1825 brought forth the triumphant cry, "Freedom of
the Press." Hitherto there had been a mild censorship exercised
by the Colonial Secretary; such surveillance was abolished and
the papers of the day were jubilant. And good reason there was
for gladness over the harvest of the past year: the new Charter
of Justice: the formation of a Legislative Council: trial by
jury: the liberty of the press: a quadruple alliance beginning to
equip itself for an onward march. The sinews of war were
beginning to stiffen in the young life: capital was turned
towards us substantially: the Australian Agricultural Company was
girding itself for the work of development: a new era was
dawning. The <i>Gazette</i> affirmed that "Posterity will do
every justice to the year that is gone."</p>
<p>On the 17th of March the vessel first mentioned as having been
sent to Moreton Bay for the sole purpose of supplying it,
returned in a leaky condition. Her name was the "Nancy". In the
following May we have the Rev. Thomas Hobbes Scott on the scene,
by the ship "Hercules", as our first Archdeacon, and holding his
primary visitations in the Church of St. James on the 9th of
June.</p>
<p>In the train of our civil enlargement follows the inevitable
harlequin, Agitation.</p>
<p>The unwonted summons, the novel scene of empanelling a jury
for the first time, on the 12th of last February, to dispose of a
case (such cases having hitherto been disposed of in a very
summary manner), such as that of "The King <i>v</i>. Robert
Cooper", our great Australian distiller, in whose favour a
verdict was recorded, may have been sensational enough to cause
further fermentation. In August began the exciting claim for
representative government: the question grew warmer as it
proceeded through September into October. The <i>Gazette</i> shot
out its leading articles with plenty of powder, and Governor
Brisbane had publicly avowed that the time was come when such
rights should be bestowed. Van Dieman's Land also now came to the
front: was declared independent on the 8th December.
Lieut.-General Ralph Darling was sworn in as its first Governor,
who then resigned the reins into the hands of Lieut.-Governor
Arthur.</p>
<p>But Moreton Bay had not been lost sight of in the turmoil of
Sydney emotions. Major Lockyer, of the 57th Regiment (whose name,
in the early days of Darling Downs, was a terror to the bullock
drivers, in its adoption by the creek which stopped their way on
the old road to Brisbane), had started off&mdash;for his
shooting, maybe&mdash;on the 1st of September, by that constantly
requisitioned craft, the cutter "Mermaid", in company with one of
our pilots. Gray, to explore the river Brisbane to its source.
Lockyer's journal, attached to these memoranda, can best speak
for itself. His conclusions are interesting. One extract will
amuse nowadays: "I think it very probable that the large swamp
into which the river at <i>Bathurst loses itself, occasionally
overflows</i>, and is the cause of the tremendous floods that at
times take <i>place in the Brisbane River</i>." The first payment
made for the new settlement at Moreton Bay by the Colonial Fund
startles inquiry: "Paid, Oct. 6. 1825, P. Quigley for 48 razors,
at 1s. 2½d. each, 11 Spanish dollars 60 cents"! The establishment
does not appear to have been guilty of extravagance.</p>
<p>The monotonous routine of duty at the outlying penal
settlements, at the beginning of the year 1826, had drawn
attention to its evil influence upon the military detachments so
stationed; for on the 2nd of January a general order was issued
which betrayed some cause of fear as to the result of the
distasteful duty of watching and guarding prisoners. There
existed, indeed, an apprehension lest soldiers so isolated, and
cut off from so much of social relaxation, should become
inoculated with the virus of the atmosphere which they breathed,
in functions exacted by such unmilitary demand for loyal service.
(See Appendix.)</p>
<p>More stringent regulations were established also with respect
to the Government vessels passing to and from the different
settlements, as shown by the Government Order (appended) of
February 13th, while another of the 21st instructed commandants
"at the several stations and settlements, to keep a journal" of
all proceedings of a public character. In March our old friend
the "Amity" was busied in the conveyance of the relief company of
the 40th regiment, under Captain Bishop, by one of the 57th, and
another batch of fourteen prisoners, and in the same month the
name of a young Australian, one since so much esteemed in the
annals of Queensland, and not long since snatched from her public
life, will lighten up our recollections of Maurice Charles
O'Connell, the eldest son of Colonel O'Connell of the 73rd
regiment, by his being gazetted as ensign in the same regiment,
in his 15th year. His mother was the relict of Captain Patland,
R.N., and daughter of our late Governor Bligh.</p>
<p>Five and twenty years after the establishment of New South
Wales, a road had been found through the hitherto impenetrable
barrier of the Blue Mountains&mdash;the dividing range. It was
afterwards pierced by two other routes preferable to the first,
and the western country began to be a sensational subject of
conversation and inquiry this year. Bathurst and Liverpool
Plains; the rivers Castlereagh and Peel opened large views of a
probable future and profitable venture. Strange that the
hankering after the eastern discharge for the whole water system
thus being developed existed among our folks then, and continued
to do so, until a precise knowledge of the sources of the river
Brisbane so many years afterwards. There was the relic of the
same adhesion to our sea-board, in the dragging away even of the
Condamine to Wide Bay. There was evident hope in the moot
question of this year&mdash;"Where do these streams go?" for
again and again we were promised that if "these waters should
unite in the Brisbane river recently discovered to fall into
Moreton Bay, Liverpool Plains and the country through which all
these streams hold their course will become of the utmost
importance to the wealth and prosperity of the colony."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Governor Brisbane's wish to withdraw the
"banpenal", from Port Macquarie settlement three years ago,
Governor Darling proclaimed it, with Moreton Bay and Norfolk
Island, as a place to which offenders convicted in New South
Wales "shall be sent", in August this year. (Appendix.)</p>
<p>The record that the "country was indebted" to a black native
for what was "ranked amongst the most valuable of our late
colonial discoveries," in the laying open to our view and use the
fertile banks of the Macleay recently, was somewhat in contrast
this year with the crimes imputed to those whose hunting-grounds
we had usurped. In October, Captain Logan, commandant at
Brisbane, had distinguished himself by adding another
stream&mdash;to which he had given the name of "Darling"&mdash;to
our coast waters in the southern nook of Moreton Bay; a name,
however, which has been in this case superseded by that of
"Logan". To our commandants, at least, if in any way within the
scope of their inclinations or energies, the interesting work of
exploration must have presented an agreeable distraction from the
monotony of life, whatever may have been the effects of such
seclusion upon their subordinates on these outposts. Captain
Logan was pre-eminent in pursuits which came to an unhappy end
only with his career in the public service. On this, the third of
his efforts in that district, he set forth in a boat, and came to
the mouth of the stream in question about fifty miles south of
that of the Brisbane, and ascended it until stopped by trees
lying across the channel. It was described as "infinitely
superior in point of soil and water to that of the
Brisbane"&mdash;in these days we may think such comparisons
"odious". Its "situation is immediately under Mt. Warning," and
the conclusion was justified in Sydney that we need not "yet
despair of some inlet into the interior being found out that will
solve the mysteries of these Australian water-sheds," when the
matter was reported.</p>
<p>Hitherto, Stradbroke Island had been looked upon as part of
the mainland, for we were suddenly told "that a passage for small
vessels had been discovered between Mount (Point?) Danger and
Amity Point which will in future prevent the necessity of
rounding Amity Point, since the latter now proves only to be an
island." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Evidently in allusion to the "boat passage"
between the southernmost end of Stradbroke Island and the
mainland.]</p>
<p>The closing of the year 1826 was marked by the arrival of the
first seventy-four that ever entered an Australian port, on the
19th of October: that of H.M.S. "Warspite", commanded by Sir
James Brisbane, C.B., accompanied by Lady Brisbane and the two
Misses Brisbane on their way from Trincomalee to South America.
The mention of this occurrence cannot be impertinent to any group
of events, in which interest in the name of Brisbane is
prominent, especially when intensified by the following
coincident announcement.</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="margin-right:15%; text-align:right;">"Colonial

<br>
<div style="margin-right:5%; text-align:right;">"December 19th,

"His Excellency the Governor announces with feelings of unfeigned
regret the death of Commodore Sir James Brisbane, which took
place this morning at ten o'clock.<br>
<br>
"This event, which has deprived his country of a most
distinguished officer, and the Service and Society in which he
lived of an example deserving of imitation, will be deeply and
sincerely lamented.<br>
<br>
"His health had suffered from his exertions in conducting the
Naval operations at Rangoon. When he arrived here his
constitution was evidently in a state of great exhaustion, and he
continued to decline until the moment of his final

which forms an interesting epoch in the annals of this colony:
the arrival of the first line of battle ship in the harbour of
Port Jackson, and will be handed down with it as a record to

</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In the procession were two hundred men of the Royal Marines,
the 3rd Regiment of Foot, accompanied by the band of the 3rd and
57th Regiments. The Governor and Lieutenant Brisbane were chief
mourners.</p>
<p>The dilemma as to the water-shed&mdash;say to the eastward of
the meridian 135°&mdash;necessarily perplexing at that time, must
be still interesting. At the end of this year it was thought by
some that the river lately discovered by Captain Logan, fifty
miles to the "southward of Moreton Bay," and immediately "under
Mount Warning" designated the "Darling", was the same as that of
which the late Mr. Uniacke speaks in Field's compiled work on
this colony. Uniacke accompanied Oxley in a tour to Moreton Bay,
and "it appears," said one report, "they fell in with a bay or
river to the south of Moreton Bay, to which the name of 'Tweed'
was given, but we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the
'Tweed' and the 'Darling' are one and the same, since Mr. Oxley
would never have omitted to mention so pre-eminently valuable a
discovery: for Mr. Uniacke does not pretend to give anything like
the account that Captain Logan has furnished, neither is it
advanced that they penetrated one hundred miles to discover the
source of the 'Tweed'. We think that the 'Tweed' must either be a
branch of the Darling River, or that the latter is entirely
distinct from the 'Tweed', and consequently a new discovery. We
hope, however, that the present Government will not be long
before they cause the solution of this mystery; though, with our
present information we are satisfied that Mr. Oxley never
encountered the new river."</p>
<p>The new year&mdash;1827&mdash;began with the sound intent to
advance! On its first day the first weekly came out as the first
daily newspaper in these colonies: still, however, as the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>Information had reached the Government lately that laxity of
discipline had crept into the organization of the penal status of
the country, which portended evil, perhaps alarming consequences.
A "Government Order" [in Appendix], dated March 16th, is worth
considering.</p>
<p>June introduced Captain Logan again, not as a boating man but
as a pedestrian: it seems unjust and improper to omit any portion
of his own handwriting; his sad fate consecrates his work. The
following extract from his letter, addressed to the Colonial
Secretary, Alexander McLeay, was dated July 25, 1827:</p>
<blockquote>"I proceeded up the Brisbane on the 7th of
June&mdash;as will appear by my journal&mdash;with the view of
heading the river lately discovered;" [named by him 'Darling',
now known as the 'Logan',] "reaching Mount Warning, and from
thence taking the most direct route to the Tweed. However, I
found it impossible, notwithstanding every exertion, to get
through the thick scrubs which cover the mountain in that
direction. I was, in consequence, obliged to return to the
settlement without accomplishing the object of my journey.
However, I have much satisfaction in reporting that the country
through which I travelled exceeded my most sanguine expectations
and is everywhere exceedingly well watered; and I have no doubt,
whenever it may suit the views of Government to open it for
settlers, it will be found the most desirable district for that
purpose hitherto found in the colony. After the sailing of the
'Wellington', I will take an opportunity of proceeding to the
spot from whence I saw what I supposed to be the Tweed, and from
thence endeavour to make a direct route. The distance did not
seem to me to exceed fifty miles."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Captain Logan's journal:</p>
<blockquote>"June 7. Left the settlement at four o'clock in the
morning: proceeded up the Brisbane, and arrived at the Limestone
Hills on the left branch at ten o'clock at night: distance
fifty-seven miles.<br>
<br>
"June 8. Sent the boat back to the settlement and proceeded
overland: directed my course S.S.W. in the direction of Mount
Dumaresq: the country very fine: black vegetable mould on a
limestone bottom: the timber consisted of eucalyptus, viz.,
ironbark, blue gum, box, apple-tree, and a variety I have not
hitherto seen. Men being very much fatigued halted for the night:
distance thirteen miles. Resumed at eight next morning: country
superior, for eight miles, to yesterday's: shot two beautiful
parrots&mdash;a new species&mdash;not hitherto found in the
colony: came to a large swamp, several miles in extent: skirted
it for some miles and then crossed it: came again on the
Brisbane" (Bremer?) "running N.E., crossed it, and proceeded up
the left bank: approached Mount Dumaresq towards evening: the
country now exceeded in beauty and fertility anything I had
before seen: in the bed of the river I found small specimens of
coal and crystal: distance twenty miles.<br>
<br>
"June 10. Commenced this day's journey at half-past eight
o'clock: crossed a beautiful plain two miles in width, and about
three in length, very lightly timbered, no preparation necessary
for the ploughshare: at half-past nine entered a thick scrub at
the foot of Mount Dumaresq, which continues to the summit; found
several turkeys, and a remarkable large pigeon upwards of three
pounds weight: gained the top of the mountain at three o'clock:
had a grand and extensive prospect: the Limestone Hills bore
N.N.E. I had traversed the valley of the Brisbane thirty-six
miles, and it appeared about the same in breadth: I may safely
rely that there is in this beautiful vale at least half a million
of acres excellently watered, and fit for any purpose to which it
may be applied. I could likewise distinctly see the windings of
the 'Logan' through an extensive and beautiful country eastward
from Mount Dumaresq, and only separated from the valley I had
quitted by moderately elevated ground. In descending the mountain
on the southern side, had to encounter a difficult scrub which I
could not clear before sunset: luckily found water in a ravine,
when I stopped for the night: distance this day, twelve
miles.<br>
<br>
"June 11. Resumed my descent through the scrub at eight o'clock:
after much difficulty cleared it at ten o'clock: found a branch
of the Logan at the base, running northward: the river here
passed through a large swampy plain well adapted to graze cattle:
saw a large flock of emus, the first seen in the vicinity of
Moreton Bay; the course of the river making a detour to the west,
left its bank, having changed my course to south, in the
direction of Mount Shadforth, and after a few miles' walk
recrossed the Logan, which flowed through a large plain; the
grass thereon being on fire obliged me again to cross the river;
proceeded up the left bank for some miles; the mountains towering
on each other on every side reminded me of a Pyrenæan valley; at
four o'clock killed a large kangaroo, which was very acceptable
to the men; distance twenty-five miles.<br>
<br>
"June 12. Continued my route to the south; the river branched
into several streams; we were evidently near its source; walked
for some hours over a hilly country admirably adapted for grazing
sheep; came to a creek at the foot of Mount Shadforth, and shot
an emu on the bank: ascended the mountain, which was the most
fatiguing part of the journey: it unfortunately began to rain on
my reaching the summit, accompanied by a thick fog which
prevented me from having so extensive a prospect as I expected. I
was surrounded by mountains on all sides, but I could not get a
view of Mount Warning: to continue my route to the southward
would have been very difficult and would have protracted the
journey beyond the time intended. I therefore determined to steer
eastward, and gain the low country: descended the mountain to the
eastward, and halted for the night in a natives' encampment:
distance fifteen miles.<br>
<br>
"June 13. Continued my route eastward over a very difficult and
mountainous country: at length perceived Mt. Warning, direct in
my course: on approaching the base found the principal branch of
the Logan: the stream was so rapid I had some difficulty in
passing: encamped on the right bank, and immediately commenced to
ascend in hope of reaching the summit, but could only gain a peak
not more than half way to the top: all attempts appeared to be
hopeless at the east and north sides, and it would have detained
me two days longer to have made a detour to the westward,
probably with as little chance of success. I therefore returned
to the encampment with the intention of proceeding on my journey
in the morning: distance fourteen miles.<br>
<br>
"June 14. Made another attempt to ascend the mountain on the
north side: had a very extensive view: found Limestone Hills bore
due north: recommenced my journey to the east: proceeded for some
miles without much difficulty: crossed another river which washed
the S.E. side of the mountain, and united with another a few
miles below: crossed some beautiful valleys well watered with
mountain streams: got into an extensive scrub, which prevented me
making way to the east: towards evening made a detour to north to
clear the scrub: and got into an open forest country before
sunset: distance twenty miles.<br>
<br>
"June 15. Started at sunrise, proceeded east: passed through a
fine hilly country covered with most luxuriant grass to the top
of the hills: the soil principally a black vegetable mould: this
part of the country is the best I have seen either for sheep or
cattle, and is most abundantly watered, each valley possessing a
most beautiful rivulet: passed several considerable streams which
unite with the Logan: towards evening my route eastward was
completely terminated by mountains covered with pine scrubs to
the summits: perceiving a stream running north, I determined to
follow the course for a few miles, for the purpose of finding a
more even way to cross the mountains to the sea coast: distance
twenty-five miles.<br>
<br>
"June 16. Started N.E. over a hilly country somewhat inferior to
yesterday, but well adapted to pasturage: distance fifteen
miles.<br>
<br>
"June 17. Ascended a ridge of mountains: could see nothing but
mountains to the eastward covered with pine scrubs: provisions
were nearly exhausted and the men's shoes worn out: determined to
steer northward and join the settlement: proceeded down the banks
of a river through a rich tract of country: saw several
kangaroos, but the dogs were so weak they could not run them
down: fortunately before sunset killed one: stopped for the
night: distance twenty miles.<br>
<br>
"June 18. Continued my route: passed through a rich valley:
towards midday left the valley on my right: my route now lay over
some rocky ridges: the worst country I have passed through: the
men greatly fatigued: distance sixteen miles.<br>
<br>
"June 19. Continued north the first part of the day: country was
very good: much improved in appearance to that traversed
yesterday: towards noon it became swampy: at two o'clock arrived
at the Logan, not fordable: stopped for the night: distance
twenty miles.<br>
<br>
"June 20. Made several unsuccessful attempts to cross the river:
moved up the bank about eight miles.<br>
<br>
"June 21. Proceeded up the river about two miles: crossed at a
ledge of rocks: steered north for the settlement: timbered with
finest oak: considerable number of swamps: distance twenty-two
miles.<br>
<br>
"June 22. Recommenced my route for Brisbane Town for a few miles
through a swampy country: towards midday arrived at Cooper's
Plains, and crossed Canoe Creek: reached the Brisbane opposite
the settlement at four o'clock."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Following in the wake of worthy work, <i>Palmam qui meruit
ferat</i> does the following Government Order proclaim to the
public on July 16th:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to
direct that the Island forming the southern boundary of the
eastern channel into Moreton Bay shall lie designated the "Isle
of Stradbroke" in compliment to the Honourable J.H. Rous,
commanding H.M. Ship 'Rainbow'&mdash;the first ship of war which
entered Moreton Bay.<br>
<br>
"The point of land in the Isle of Stradbroke (which is intended
as the site of a Public Establishment) [Quarantine] opposite to
Peel's Island is named 'Dunwich': and the anchorage where the
'Rainbow' lay, 'Rainbow Reach'. The channel between the Isle of
Stradbroke and Moreton Island is named 'Rous Channel'.<br>
<br>
"2nd. The Governor has been further pleased to name the river
recently discovered at Moreton Bay&mdash;immediately to the
southward of the Brisbane&mdash;the 'Logan', as a record of his
Excellency's approbation of the zeal which Captain Logan, the
commandant of Moreton Bay, has evinced in adding to the important
discovery made by Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General, of the river
Brisbane in the year 1823.<br>
<br>
"By His Excellency's Command, Alexander McLeay."</blockquote>
<p>No violence will be done to date-disciplined thoughts in
taking up awhile a publication which appeared at this time, which
tells of a coast survey by Captain Philip King, commenced so far
back as 1818, in that well-worn and worked cutter, the "Mermaid".
The following is an outline:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Captain Philip King&mdash;son of the late Governor
King of N.S. Wales&mdash;sailed from Port Jackson in 1818, with
Mr. Cunningham, the botanist, and 'Boongaree' * the native who
had accompanied Flinders. He touched at Twofold Bay and passed
through Bass' Straits to King George's Sound, where he stayed
some time; and thence to North-west Cape, carefully surveying and
laying down the coast the whole way. He then proceeded northwards
to Rowley's Shoals, Goulburn Islands, and Raffles Bay, in which
he met with a Malay fleet. At Port Essington he was attacked by
the natives in Knocker's Bay, where, as well as on the most of
the northern coast, they were found particularly hostile and
troublesome. Having inspected Van Dieman's Gulf, Melville Island,
Sir George Hope's Islands, and Alligator River, he crossed to
Coepang in Timor, of which there is an interesting description.
The inhabitants called the New Hollanders on the opposite coast
'Maregas' from their treacherous and savage disposition towards
them when fishing, for trespassing on their shores. After seven
months' absence Captain King returned to Sydney with a valuable
collection of plants, seeds, insects and minerals; then made a
trip of two months to Van Dieman's Land, and surveyed
particularly the Derwent and Macquarie Harbour. The trees at Pine
Cove are described as being well adapted to nautical
purposes.</blockquote>
<br>
<p class="foot">[* Last chief of the Port Jackson blacks, buried
at Rose Bay.]</p>
<blockquote>"In May, 1819, he again sailed, accompanied by
Lieutenant Oxley, in the brig 'Lady Nelson', to survey the east
coast. The 'Mermaid' then proceeded northward, discovering Rodd's
Bay, visiting Percy Island, and entered Endeavour river. The
natives at that place had shields in the shape of crescents made
of the coral tree. The river soon becomes shallow, and is fresh
nine miles from the mouth; the banks are low and covered with
mangroves. The track of the 'Investigator' through Torres Straits
was then followed. Liverpool river on the north coast was
discovered and examined. It forms a good port, and is four miles
wide at the mouth, but decreasing to half a mile ten miles up. It
swarms with fish, egrets, and white cockatoos. Alligators about
twelve feet long are also very common. At Cape Londonderry they
were again attacked by the natives, who were uniformly hostile.
Touching at the Isle of Suva, the 'Mermaid' then returned to
Sydney.<br>
<br>
"The vessel was there put under water to destroy the myriads of
rats and cockroaches; but the eggs of the latter were speedily
hatched on re-entering the tropics. The voyage in 1820 was nearly
over the former ground.<br>
<br>
"In May, 1821, the 'Mermaid' being found unseaworthy the
'Bathurst', of 170 tons, was fitted out for a fourth voyage.
Captain King sailed along the eastern and northern coasts.
Several affrays occurred with the natives. At one place was found
a remarkable cavern cut into regular galleries and ornamented
with drawings in red ochre of various animals, clubs and plants.
Prince Regent's River, on the north coast was explored. It
contains a magnificent cascade, 150 feet high. Alligators and
other fish were numerous, and a curious amphibious animal about
nine inches long, called a mud-fish. It buries itself in an
instant in the mud, and on land uses the pectoral fins as legs.
At Hanover Bay, Mr. Montgomery, the surgeon, was severely wounded
by the natives. The 'Bathurst' then visited the Isle of France,
and returned thence to King George's Sound. The natives there are
peaceable, eat raw seal flesh, and wear cloaks of kangaroo skins.
On the west coast optical delusions frequently occurred,
representing land and trees where none existed. The vegetation of
the islands on the coast was usually very different from that of
the mainland. In May, 1822, Captain King returned to Sydney and
sailed for England. The botanical collection is cultivated by Mr.
Alton, at Kew Gardens, and a herbarium of five hundred specimens
is in the hands of Mr. Lambert, the botanist.<br>
<br>
"Captain King is now surveying the southern coasts of America,
and is to make an attempt to reach the South Pole, which from
Captain Weddell's late discoveries, it is thought, may be
done."</blockquote>
<p>The name of Thomas de la Condamine is too familiar to a
Queenslander's ear to be passed by without saluting it, as one
perpetuated by the waters of Darling Downs. His appointment this
year as Clerk of the Executive and Legislative Council appeared
with that of Henry Grattan Douglas, as Commissioner of the Court

<p>The battle of Waterloo and all its glory had not died out yet,
for on its anniversary&mdash;18th June&mdash;the "Amity"
expedition to Port Essington had taken possession of a bay *
adjoining that place, and called it "Wellington" under a royal
salute. The British flag had been hoisted and the spot dubbed a
"fort". The "Mary Elizabeth" which, laden with agricultural
implements had left Sydney with the practical means of making
Port Essington a tropical garden, had been seen struggling on for
Torres Straits: and on Friday, October 5, in a service ever
relieving, but never relieved from weariness and <i>ennui</i>,
Lieutenant Bainbridge went to Moreton Bay to release Lieutenant
Innes, who then returned to Port Macquarie; at the same time that
the Rev. Charles P.N. Wilton, M.A., supplied refreshment to the
studious inquirer, by his publication&mdash;of which he was also
the author&mdash;of the <i>Australian Quarterly Journal of
Theology, Literature, and Science</i>.</p>

<p>October brought to light a token of the strength of the ruling
passion, which makes Strafford's motto, "Thorough", that of all
of the British birthright who <i>will</i> it: it was but a scrap
of paper found in a cave about seventy miles from Bathurst in the
western country. So much as the following was deciphered: "In
this cave the undersigned poor individual retreated, in order to

<hr class="2">
<p align="center">"SPICILEGIUM."</p>
<p><span class="a">Indirectly</span> appealing to Queensland
sympathy, the fate of the gallant La Perouse and his companions
brought out of the dark for the first time by the persevering
efforts of Captain Dillon, commanding the East India Co.'s ship
"Research", fixed first attention to the incidents of this year.
On January 2nd, 1828, Captain Dillon, accompanied by Count
Cheneau, Consul to China from France, arrived in Sydney, having
completed his mission under the auspices of the E.I. Company.
[See Appendix.]</p>
<p>The perpetual strain had now told upon our indefatigable
Surveyor-General, the discoverer of the Brisbane, the founder of
the first of Queensland settlements. On the 26th of February he
obtained leave of absence in the hope of re-establishing health.
Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell was appointed as his "locum
tenens;" and on the 25th of May Oxley died, after a long illness,
brought on by the pressure of public business. The appointment of
his successor. Major Mitchell, was gazetted on the 26th.
[Appendix.]</p>
<p>William Johnson was hung in Sydney, in March, for the murder
of Morris Morgan, at Moreton Bay, under sentence passed by
Justice Dowling. A case of the old story! The settlement's
requirements seem to have kept the coasters in lively exercise,
the names of "Lucy Ann", "Alligator", and "Isabella" frequently
recurring. Port Raffles and Melville Island were at this time "as
well as could be expected from the incessant heat of the
weather;" at the two latter places the aborigines on the North
Coast were as harassing in their attacks on the Malays as on the
white strangers.</p>
<p>On the 25th of July gas first shed light in Sydney,
<i>i.e</i>. in the shop alone of Mr. Woods.</p>
<p>Why a ship should go to the Isle of France <i>viâ</i> Moreton
Bay, who can tell? But so it was with the "Borodino", on the 29th
of August, from Sydney.</p>
<p>On the 5th September, Captain Rous and the "Rainbow" returned
from a cruise to the northward, reporting the discovery of the
Richmond in latitude 28 deg. 54 min., and the * Clarence in the
latitude and longitude of Point Danger (a manifest error
somewhere, as this is the position of the Tweed). He fell in with
five runaway prisoners from Moreton Bay, in a state of nudity.
Fraser, the colonial botanist, had also returned, speaking in
raptures of country which he had visited south of the settlement
of Moreton Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Clarence entrance, 29° 26' south latitude,
153° 23' east longitude. Tweed entrance, 28° 9' south latitude,
153° 34' east longitude.]</p>
<p>The 18th April, 1829, was the last day of the lives of two
wretched men, hung for the murder of their mate at Moreton Bay.
Their names were Thomas Matthews and Thomas Allen. The first
knocked down John Carroll, of the same gang, while the last cleft
his head asunder with his mattock. The old story told on the
gallows! It seemed that at this time the French Government had
decided upon forming settlements on our west coast, and sent
formal notice of their intent to the British Ministry. This
intimation evidently quickened ministerial movements in an
exceptional manner. Orders were instantly despatched to the Cape
of Good Hope for the immediate departure of a man-of-war with a
suitable complement of military, to "Swan" Port, and the Captain
of H.M.S. "Success", who had already urged the advantages of that
spot for settlement, was at length sent off to it with all
possible speed. [Appendix.]</p>
<p>Again, this month figured under the hangman's hand. James
Sullivan had killed his companion, Patrick McConderan, at Moreton
Bay, that he might by this method "be himself freed from
suffering worse than death." This was the old story.</p>
<p>May 12th brought to our shores, by the "Princess Royal",
Captain Sherwood, G.C. Stapylton on the staff of our surveyors,
from London the 6th of January. Poor fellow! afterwards murdered
by the blacks near Brisbane.</p>
<p>The revered name of the Rev. William Grant Broughton * on the
17th of September, emitted a gentle ray&mdash;the earnest of
advancing day upon the scene of Australia's higher life. As
successor to the Rev. Thomas Hobbes Scott, in him the
Archidiaconal grew into Episcopal dignity. His speeches, when he
threw his weight into the scale of political discussion, breathed
through his whole course the benignity of his nature, and the
truth of the charity which he exercised in thought, word, deed,
and preached abroad. He was sworn in as a member of the Executive
Council and took his seat on the 23rd, and probably from him came
the pleading under which the Governor did not think it
extravagant to issue his proclamation of the third of the
November following by which he acknowledged the propriety of
affording an opportunity "to the inhabitants of publicly
expressing their humble thankfulness to Almighty God" for the
instance of His mercy referred to [Appendix] in relief from a
long distress of drought.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Born four months after this colony.]</p>
<p>Of the early explorers of the "North Countrie", none, perhaps,
may fire the sympathies of early Queensland so truly with the
spirit of "Auld Lang Syne", as he yclept Allan Cunningham.** In
the footprints of Cunningham's perseverance did that pastoral
<i>preux chevalier</i>, Patrick Leslie, win his spurs; but for
Leslie's lead, Leichhardt, in all probability, had been loth to
lunge his longings and his life on the wide circuit of this
unknown land; and but for Leichhardt, his hearth and heart's
loved dream,*** this virgin "realm" had not so soon been led out
of her captivity in "nothingness and night" by exploit of his
knight-errantry and his squires to be enthroned Aphrodite of this
foam-sprung Tierra Austral. We are ever looking back inquiringly
upon the queenly form roused from her wilderness sleep by
Cunningham's hand and voice, and asking "how much owest
<i>thou</i> under the sun to the memory of this man's loyal
service and of his fellow rescuers"? Patient and plodding, now
again we find him, on the 24th September, 1829, in our midst,
back from the new north with <i>Io triumphe!</i> on his every
smile. "See these specimens! dead, dried, and living: plants
which that region only as yet can gladden us with: vegetation as
yet unknown. With what delight will the herbarium at home nurse
these! I have paced again that paradise, pathless yet around that
pen of punishment: that penal patch within which pity is but a
poor phantom in rags, and pain soon palsies the prison pulses.
More yet! I have set at rest the fretting question which has so
long addled our humours: I have seen enough to know that the
grand labyrinth of Oxley's western waters shuns all defiling
intercourse with this braggart stream of Brisbane which has so
tantalised our fancies with the promise of its pretentious
mouth."</p>
<p class="foot">[** Allan Cunningham. Was he not of
Dumfrieshire?]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Leichhardt told me that he had come here to
make a name for himself by success in his undertakings in
Australia, that he might so be enabled to return to his native
country and carry out his engagement to a lady to whom he was
much attached.]</p>
<p>Murders north and murders south! In 1830, two more white
savages on the 4th of February by the barque "Lucy Ann", from
Moreton Bay, to be tried, and, of course, hung; and in May the
black savages in Van Dieman's Land to be punished wholesale,
through the impressed service of their far-north fellow
countrymen! The happy expedient had been hit upon by some
merciful soul of sending "down a body of blacks, who, it is
thought, may be useful" as bloodhounds on the track of their
distant kindred; for which purpose we find that "a party of
Moreton Bay natives are now in Sydney comfortably clothed in
blankets, and preparing for their novel expedition." Now, in the
spirit of "advance", was the first suggestion of "overlanding",
for it was gazetted that the "Government were about to drive a
thousand head of cattle to Moreton Bay, for the purpose of
supplying the settlement with fresh meat." But it was never
done.</p>
<p>Port Macquarie lifted up her head with an open honest
countenance on the 15th day of August. The word went forth that
she should be no longer a prison house on the 30th of July.
[Appendix]. Another edict had presented our young industries with
the mother-land's indulgence of a reduction of the duty upon our
kangaroo-skins' introduction into her exclusive nursery, from
twenty to five per cent., as a new year's gift last
year&mdash;1829.</p>
<p>Four years had Captain Logan's commandancy at Moreton Bay
endured, and, <i>on disait</i> in October, that he would return
to head quarters by the very next craft. He certainly did return,
but not until the Government schooner "Isabella" had arrived on
the 23rd of November, bringing his dead body.</p>
<p>In those four years his "bent" had been conspicuous in his
exploring excursions by land and water. Before making way to a
success of, he had wished his closing effort in the public
service to be the completion of a map, in which should be
embodied his own and all other results which had up to the time
accrued in the examination of the surrounding district. And so,
self-reliant and a stranger to all apprehension, he set forth on
the 9th of last month&mdash;October&mdash;to make his last
<i>congé</i> to the river-god of the Brisbane. On that Saturday,
accompanied by his servant Collison, of the 57th Regiment, and
five prisoners, he set about his work, that of laying down
correctly the windings of its course between the Pine-ridge,
Lockyer's Creek, and Mount Brisbane; examining the creek which
struck out of the main channel at the foot of this mountain in a
north-easterly direction; and thence returning by the
"Pumice-stone" stream and the "Glass Houses" to the settlement.
He took two pack-bullocks, together with their requirements. On
Sunday they had travelled about fourteen miles; next day, when
nearing the Pine Range, some two hundred blacks showed in hostile
array upon a hill close to which they had to pass, rolled down
large stones on them, without doing damage however, but used no
spears. A shot fired by Collison over their heads kept them off
awhile; but they renewed their attack shortly afterwards. The
bearing of the natives towards the party throughout was unusually
threatening. On his return, and when close under Mt. Irwin,
Captain Logan, still lingering in his investigations of the
ground which he had now learnt so well, left the others, with
instructions that they should camp in a place he spoke of, where
he would rejoin them that evening. He was never seen again alive.
* [See Appendix.]</p>
<p class="foot">[* From one of the reports appended it seems that
the skeleton found in 1840 by Arthur Hodgson on his station of
Etonvale could not have been that of Captain Logan's horse, as
supposed when told of at Moreton Bay.]</p>
<p>Too significant, it may be feared, of the excessive discipline
practised hitherto in the control of prisoners at the penal
settlements appointed for secondary punishment, was the issue of
the Proclamation&mdash;to be found in the Appendix&mdash;which
bears the date of October 26, 1830. The frequent executions for
murder, the declarations, on more than one occasion, made by the
wretched culprits before the fatal "drop", had stirred up men's
minds to a general condemnation of the extreme system of
punishment which was exposed by such reiterated "last words" on
the gallows.</p>
<p>There was a prevalent rumour in the North that the terrible
occurrences which had marked Logan's end had been worked out by
the blacks under the instigation of revengeful
convicts,&mdash;possibly runaways dwelling among the very
natives, who were ever greedy in their appetite for the white
man's blood. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>. Bowing to the
principle, let the question sleep. Yet this proclamation cannot
fail to be suggestive. [Appendix.]</p>
<p>Following in the wake of past notable incidents, paddled out
the "Surprise", the first steamboat launched in Australia, on the
31st of March, 1831, and made her first trip to Parramatta under
the auspices of Wednesday, the 1st day of June following. The
12th of July added another gross record of an execution: that of
McMann's, convicted on the previous Thursday of an attempt "to
murder a fellow-prisoner with a hoe at Moreton Bay with the
avowed object of getting sent to Sydney; then to forfeit his own
life." April, just past, was noticeable through the issue of a
Government order, dated the 16th, "prohibiting the abominable
traffic with New Zealand for human heads!" On the 16th of May the
steamer "Sophia Jane" arrived from England, under the command of
Captain Biddulph, and accomplished her first trip to the Hunter
on the 19th; and on the 16th of August another mess of misery
stares us in the face, in the reception into Sydney Gaol of three
runaways from Moreton Bay, "who had reached the vicinity of Port
Macquarie, had been brought in and delivered over to Captain
Smyth by the blacks of that settlement," escaped again thence,
and reached Port Stephens, where they were seized and sent on
here for disposal. Escaping from one gaol to be shut up in
another, in spite of all the attendant risk in the way of spears
and starvation, must have been but a sorry taste of freedom for a
season.</p>
<p>This year turned out upon the waters of the Williams river
another steamer, built by Grose, of Parramatta, which was
launched on Monday, 21st November, and proceeded to Sydney to
take in her engines; while our new and useful comer, the "Sophia
Jane", received, <i>pro formâ</i>, the first two tons of coal
from the just completed "Agricultural Company's wharf at
Newcastle, the first fruits of the new workings."</p>
<p>The years 1832, 1833, and 1834 presented little body of
sensational matter directly or indirectly from the northern
district. Distinguishable from the bearing of the then present
upon the future is the satisfaction of finding that in 1833 the
"Isabella" took to Moreton Bay, for secondary punishment, no less
than twenty of that class of convicts called "specials", a class
which, having "moved once in their day in a more respectable
sphere of society," deserved, it was very fairly said, "no
distinction in treatment." Moral instruction&mdash;an advantage
of which they had had the early teaching&mdash;had been scorned:
habits of idleness, self-indulgence, and vice had left them no
power to be useful even in the enforced labour of punishment;
much less in the desire of better things: while the other class
had furnished many instances of returning to a desire of showing
practically that it was "never too late to mend." So murmured
justice. Some of the more energetic&mdash;it may be
supposed&mdash;had managed to escape in a Government boat early
this year. The "Isabella" had searched in vain for them and the
boat at Norfolk Island, and so came back again on July 18th; but
soon this fair craft told a tale of more prolific industry, for
on the 27th of August she, under command of sturdy master Hanson,
with a hold full of cedar, treenails, and specimens of Moreton
Bay wood; her deck lively with some rank and file of the 17th
Regiment, in whose charge (<i>proh! pudor</i>) were three female
prisoners of the Crown, were gladly hailed in Port Jackson. Some
trades must have been flourishing, when on the 19th of August,
1834, were sold by auction at the Commissariat Stores, by Samuel
Lyons, 8,000 bushels of maize, at from 3s. to 3s. 2d. a bushel,
and 32,000 feet of cedar, in plank, at 1½d. a foot, brought from
Brisbane by the "Harriet:" while it was hoped that the departure
of the revenue cutter, "Prince George", from Sydney on the 16th
December, for the purpose of examining "Lord Howe's" Island, and
reporting upon its eligibility for a penal settlement upon the
Norfolk Island system, might be an indication of the abandonment
of Moreton Bay, because of the facilities of escape thence, and
the prevalence&mdash;so stated&mdash;"of ague, and other
afflictions and diseases, to a fearful extent," at that place.
Spring Rice (afterwards Lord Monteagle) had moved at home for
leave to bring in a bill to establish criminal courts at Norfolk
Island.</p>
<p>The modesty of the following, which appeared in December of
1835, overpowered attention to any other memoranda which may
entitle that year to our regard. The very perusal, even now,
incenses. What an escape have we had from the closed fist of
Major Benjamin Sullivan!</p>
<p>"To the Nobility and Gentry of the British Empire and its
Colonies:</p>
<blockquote>"The distress that is year after year prevalent in
Great Britain and Scotland, partly arising from the inability of
employing fully at all seasons of the year its redundant
population, requires the serious attention of the British public.
A beautiful well-watered tract of country 'on its (New South
Wales') eastern coast, extending from the counties of Macquarie
and Cambridge to the tropic of Capricorn, particularly claims the
notice of Britons for emigrating to; possessing every earthly
requisite to induce man to occupy it; its soil being excellent,
with numerous fine rivers running through it and covered with
timber extremely valuable for ship and house building and for
cabinet work; its degrees of latitude correspond with those of
the northern, allowing five degrees for the difference of cold in
the temperature between the two hemispheres, within which, in the
northern the best wine countries are to be met with; it may
therefore be presumed thai it would be adapted for the vine,
tobacco, the sugar-cane, coffee, European and New Zealand flax,
European hemp and the mulberry&mdash;otherwise the silk-worm
tree&mdash;besides the cultivation of various fruits and grains,
and the grazing of sheep and cattle: it abounds with minerals,
precious stones, and pearls, lime, coal, iron, and copper; it is
admirably situated for pursuing to any extent the whale fishery;
and it possesses a surface, taken from its sea coast to the 150th
degree of east longitude, of upwards of 20,000,000 acres!<br>
<br>
"Private emigrants, however (particularly the poorer classes),
cannot attempt to turn such a vast extent of territory into
profit, for in endeavouring to do it many would infallibly be
ruined, while those who might be fortunate enough to succeed in
overcoming that danger, would find that many years would be
required to bring it into public estimation and importance.<br>
<br>
"Nevertheless, a joint stock company might undertake to do what
private individuals, however persevering, could not; that is, to
bring into a state of cultivation and of colonization the
aforementioned tract of country; if such were to be formed on a
plan that would not only effectually ensure to the British Crown
all due obedience, authority, and patronage, but also would give
to its proprietors ample remuneration for the risk, the zeal, and
the perseverance that would necessarily be required of them in
effecting it.<br>
<br>
"Upon that basis, the undersigned has drawn up the following
prospectus for the formation of such a company, which he humbly
submits to your notice and patronage.<br>
<br>
"The undersigned, with all due deference, has the honour to
subscribe himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I. It is proposed that a Joint Stock Company shall
be formed, to be called the 'Eastern Australian Company', with a
capital of one million pounds sterling, to be raised by twenty
thousand shares of fifty pounds each, and paid in five
instalments.<br>
<br>
"2. That the said Company shall petition the Crown to grant to it
all the territory from 24 deg. to 31 deg. 10 min. south latitude,
and from the eastern sea coast of Australia, including its
adjacent isles, to 150 deg. east longitude; or from that coast as
far westward as the dividing mountain ranges will permit, free
from all reserves and rights on the part of the Crown, save that
of the right of erecting such military and naval buildings as may
from time to time be found necessary for the protection of such
territory, and for the honour and dignity of the
Crown."</blockquote>
<p>Here follow thirty-three sections of this prospectus. Then in
all naiveté: "to the foregoing prospectus some explanations may
be considered as necessary." For a description of the territory
that it was proposed to petition the Crown to grant to such a
Company, the projector refers the reader to Wentworth's
"Australia", vol. II.; to Barron Field's "Australia"; to King's
"Australia", vols. I and II; to Cunningham's "New South Wales",
vols. I and II.; and to the annexed statement made before himself
as Resident Magistrate at Port Macquarie by runaway prisoners of
the Crown from the penal settlement at Moreton Bay, and by the
chief constable at that place.</p>
<blockquote>"The place where it would be advisable for such a
Company to commence operations from should be Brisbane Town, on
the Brisbane River, which empties itself into Moreton Bay, where
the Crown possesses at present several buildings of brick and
stone, as also cattle, all of which would be required by the
Company; therefore it is recommended by the sixth clause that
land should be purchased at a fair and reasonable valuation from
the Crown, at three years' credit.<br>
<br>
"According to the existing regulations His Majesty has directed
that none of his Crown lands shall be given away, but that such
should be sold; and that in New South Wales such sale shall not
be under the minimum price of five shillings per acre, for the
purpose of establishing a fund to assist individuals of Great
Britain and Ireland in emigrating to it.<br>
<br>
"Such a Company as the one proposed cannot expect to have land
granted to it by the Crown, but by purchase: nevertheless it may
be presumed that His Majesty would be favourably disposed towards
such a Company&mdash;and that he would therefore be induced to
command that the proposed lands should be allowed to be purchased
by such a Company, at the aforesaid fixed valuation, in the
course of fifty years, by annual instalments."</blockquote>
<p>The gallant Major then unburdens himself "to the free
inhabitants of New South Wales." It appears to have taken him
twenty months to digest the chagrin of his rejected address.</p>

<p><span class="a">There</span> is a complexity in the term
"squat" which, in justice to squatters in the present days,
should be accounted for: these take their seats among the
<i>élite</i> of Australia without a glance back at their
inheritance of the designation, with more heed than the
fashionable of Sydney or Brisbane would care to take upon the
Egyptian cradle from which their exodus was rocked. How shocking
to the modern squatter to read in a record of March, 1836, that a
petition was going round the districts of the colony praying the
legislature of the day to pass an act "for the prevention of
'squatting', through which so much crime was daily occurring,
inasmuch as squatting was but another term for sly grog-selling,
receiving stolen property, and harbouring bushrangers and
assigned servants!"</p>
<p>The Venerable the Archdeacon had returned on the 2nd of June
from London, by the good ship "Camden"&mdash;Captain
Ryan&mdash;having set sail thence on the 22nd February last, as
the Right Rev. Lord Bishop of Australia, accompanied by his
family. The See of Madras, which had hitherto enfolded Australia,
had no belt sufficient for the girth of so fast-growing a member
of its flock. The "Camden's" passage was exceptionally fast for
fifty years ago. On the Sunday following the ceremony of
installation took place at St. James' Church, and a new era for
our church set in. Followed by another change in public office,
we are told in August that "Mr. E. Deas-Thomson had received the
appointment of Colonial Secretary and Registrar of Records in the
room of Mr. McLeay, who retired from public life. If his
pension," the notice acrimoniously went on to say, "is to retire
with him, let the Whig ministers pay it out of their own pockets
by all means, and welcome! but to Mr. John Blaxland's we join our
heartiest protest against such a conversion of the public money,
if it be proposed to saddle the revenue of this future colony
with such an encumbrance as a retiring pension to Mr. McLeay.
Were Mr. McLeay's gains for the last ten years but one quarter as
enormous as they have been, we think he might gladly retire
without asking or seeking for anything more." Deas-Thomson's
appointment appeared in the <i>London Gazette</i>, and bears date
24th March last.</p>
<p>Just one year after E. Deas-Thomson's appointment, <i>i.e</i>.
in August, 1837, was a memorandum that the "'James Watt',
steamship, Captain Parsons, had sailed for Moreton Bay on account
of the Colonial Government," which became strangely hooked on in
tow of the news of a double shipwreck, which was freighted with
interest enough to catch the eye. A schooner called "Active" had
been wrecked on the 2nd of July last year, on a reef among the
"Feejee" or "Viti" group. Her crew and Captain Dixon had with
difficulty reached one of the islands, on which two
missionaries&mdash;Cross and Cargill&mdash;received them with all
kindness. After a while some grew impatient; seized a boat with
the purpose of reaching some vessels which the natives had spoken
of as trading for bêche-de-mer; had been seen by the savages of
an island which they had passed, who put off and killed them all.
Then, three more of the crew joined some Tongaese in a large
canoe in hopes of reaching Vavoa, one of the Friendly group.
About the 9th of September, those who remained received a note
from W. Stutchens, master of the brig "Elizabeth" of Sydney, to
the effect that he was lying at Eboona, under a hundred miles
away: had heard of their position, and of the murder: but that in
the teeth of such winds as had set in he could not go to their
help. Then came a message by a small craft called the "Pearl",
tender to an American ship, the "Eliza", from her commander,
Captain Wynn, which offered them all his vessel as a home as long
as she remained among the islands, and a passage to Rotumah or
Manila when he left. And the "Actives", captain, mate, and
supercargo (J.P. Wilkie) were landed on the island of Rotumah on
the 7th November, and on the 11th of this year, 1837, the whaling
ship "Duke of York"&mdash;master, Robert Morgan&mdash;called
there, took them on board in most cordial fashion, and went
swimmingly until the 14th of August, when the "Duke of York"
followed the bad example of the "Active" in getting wrecked, and
the compliment of her indwellers, thirty-two all told, took to
their whale boats, three in number, and on the 26th reached
Moreton Bay in company, where they were agreeably surprised by
finding the "James Watt" ready to start for Sydney. Before
reaching Moreton Bay they had on one occasion, when procuring
water, lost two men, murdered by the blacks. The "James Watt"
returned to Sydney on the 29th inst., bringing J.P. Wilkie of the
"Active", Captain Morgan, nineteen of the crew of the "Duke of
York", and Captain Jackson, R.N., from Moreton Bay. On Saturday,
the 23rd of September, the "Foster Fyans" brought up the
remainder of the crew of the "Duke of York" and the "Active" left
behind at the settlement.</p>
<p>In justice to the memory of Dr. Lang, I am glad to have an
opportunity of reproducing from the beginning of 1838 the record
of an event which makes its better mark on Moreton Bay history,
as the first practical effort towards applying the use of that
young settlement to a brighter purpose, and guiding its way out
of dark and dismal traditions towards one of bounden national
humanity, duty and justice.</p>
<p>The "Minerva", from Greenock, the 13th of August last, arrived
on Thursday, 25th January, 1838, with 235 emigrants, but in
consequence of typhus fever, were placed in quarantine. They had
been "selected by the Rev. Dr. Lang during his recent visit to
the mother country, and had come out under the care of the
doctor's brother-in-law. Captain McAusland. Among the passengers
were thirteen German clerics with their families, come out to
establish a mission to the aborigines, northward of this colony,
under the superintendence of the Synod of New South Wales. Two
were ordained clergymen, and the remainder, who came in the
capacity of catechists, had also been instructed in various
mechanical arts, with a view to the communication of the arts of
civilised life to the aborigines, in conjunction with Christian
knowledge. Hitherto the cabin passengers had been free from
disease, the fever having confined its ravages entirely to the
'tween decks. Orders had been issued by the Executive Government
for the immediate landing of the emigrants, and for the
occupation of the buildings recently erected at the Quarantine
Station, Spring Cove&mdash;then called the "Lazaretto".</p>
<p>On the 20th March, the "Isabella" took to Moreton Bay the Rev.
Christopher Eipper and fourteen of the Germans.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Schmidt and the remaining missionaries were to
follow by the next opportunity. Messrs. Schmidt and Eipper had
been admitted as members of the Synod of New South Wales, and
would as soon as practicable form themselves into a limb in
connection therewith, to be called the "Presbytery of Moreton
Bay."</p>
<p>Again in May, the same craft brought back most gratifying
intelligence. They had met with the kindest reception from Major
Cotton, the commandant of the settlement, who had shown a
disposition to forward their views to the utmost of his power. It
was proposed to select a site for their establishment, a short
distance from the settlement, but sufficiently near for
protection by the military. The aborigines of the northward
seemed to differ in character and disposition from those of the
south&mdash;"they expressed themselves highly gratified(!) on
learning the purport of the missionaries' visit to the
settlement."</p>
<p>The merits of Dr. Lang's beneficent work for Moreton Bay came
to light prominently on the 2nd day of the opening year; 1839. A
meeting was held in the School of Arts, in Sydney, in aid of this
mission: Roemer in the chair. Dr. Lang had in 1836, made
application to the local Government for assistance towards
establishing German Presbyterians at Moreton Bay, but met with no
favourable reply. Subsequently two more appeals were made, and at
length the Government promised a sum equal to what might be
raised by private subscriptions for the purpose. When Dr. Lang
went home, he visited Germany, and arranged at Berlin for the
selection of twenty persons, clergy and laity, who consented to
join the undertaking. They had sailed from Greenock under the
charge of the Rev. Mr. Schmidt, and, as already shown, had
arrived just a year ago, proceeded to the settlement, and been
principally engaged ever since in building their dwellings,
&amp;c. The full amount of £517 contributed and granted had been
slightly exceeded by the disbursements.</p>
<p>Financial considerations in February much exercised the
patience of the Governor&mdash;Sir George Gipps&mdash;and his
Council. There was an extraordinary session for the purpose of
"adopting measures for the tranquillity of the districts beyond
the limits of location," when Major-General Sir Maurice O'Connell
and Captain King were sworn in as members, and took their
seats.</p>
<p>His Excellency read the following speech:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Gentlemen,&mdash;I have called you together at this
unusual season of the year, in order to propose to you a measure
for the establishment of a police force beyond the settled
districts of the colony.<br>
<br>
"The vast interests which have grown up in those distant parts of
the territory, and the number of persons of all classes now
engaged in depasturing sheep and cattle beyond what are called
the boundaries of location, might be sufficient of themselves to
call for the protection of a police force; but the necessity for
it is rendered far more urgent by the frequent aggressions made
of late by the aboriginal natives upon the flocks and herds of
the colonists, as well as on the lives of their stockmen; by the
outrages which have been committed upon the aborigines, as well
as by them, and particularly by one atrocious deed of blood, for
which seven men have suffered on the scaffold.<br>
<br>
"The bill which I shall lay before you purposes to accomplish
this object, by giving to the Crown Land Commissioners, who
already perform certain functions in these districts, far more
important powers than they now possess; and by providing that
each Commissioner shall be accompanied by a moving police force,
sufficient to repress the predatory attacks of the natives, and
to keep order amongst all classes.<br>
<br>
"As it appears to me perfectly just that the persons who are
protected by this force should bear the expense of it, the bill
provides for that object by means of an assessment on cattle and
other stock.<br>
<br>
"In proposing, however, a new tax upon any portion of the people
of this colony, it is not sufficient, I think, to show that it
falls upon persons who may properly bear it: it is necessary to
prove that the tax itself cannot be dispensed with. Without,
therefore, entering into an elaborate statement of finance, which
at the present season of the year would be premature, I will
request the attention of the Council to a few facts tending to
show that it would be highly unwise in the present state of our
finances to incur any new expenses without providing at the same
time the means to defray them. The total revenue of the year 1838
(exclusive of Crown lands) was £202, 960 7s. 5d., being £26,739
12s. 7d. less than it was estimated at by Sir Richard Bourke. The
total expenditure of the same year&mdash;1838&mdash;(exclusive of
immigration) cannot yet be exactly ascertained, but it may be
taken at about £295,000, being an excess over the revenue of
£92,000. The excess of expenditure over income of the present
year must be taken, I am sorry to say, at a still higher sum. In
the financial minute which I laid before the Council on the 7th
of August last, it was estimated at £100,798 6s. 4d. Since that
time, however, new charges have arisen which have to be provided
for, and the increased price of provisions of every description
has caused all our contracts to be made at a higher rate than
that which is set down in the estimates; the excess of
expenditure over income for the year 1839, will, therefore, I now
apprehend, be much greater than what I considered probable August
last."</blockquote>
<p>His Excellency having finished, made a few remarks on the
nature of the bill which he then presented to Council. He said,
"it would be remembered that in the last Session, only a few
months since, a bill had been passed to restrain the occupation
of Crown lands; but the opinion given by two of the judges had
rendered some slight alterations necessary.</p>
<p>The bill was then read a first time.</p>
<p>On the 9th of the month following&mdash;March&mdash;the bill
came on again before the Council, and clauses postponed at a
previous sitting raised long discussion, in the course of which
the Governor suggested the probability of both increasing the
assessment and raising the price of licenses at a future time, as
the bill afforded so many facilities to "squatters" over the old
colonists.</p>
<p>The "Squatting Bill"&mdash;to which the title given was "an
Act further to restrain the unauthorised occupation of Crown
lands, and to find means to defray the expenses of a Border
Police" was read a third time, and passed on the 26th March.</p>
<p>Blacks and whites seem to have sickened Government of their
northernmost settlement by this time. No Patrick Leslie had yet
made his <i>anabasis</i> to Darling Downs. No squatter had yet
invaded the gaol-yard precincts of the Brisbane commandancy. Yet
<em>on disait</em> in April that the establishment there would be
shortly broken up. The Government, indeed, had taken up the
steamer "Sophia Jane" to proceed to it and bring back the whole
of the government machinery, with the exception of the
commissariat officer, the assistant-surgeon, and the subaltern.
So back came she on the 21st May with the Commandant, Major
Cotton, and his family, Lieutenant Aitken of the 28th Regiment,
Mr. Parker, superintendent of stock, Messrs. White, Spicer,
Sheridan, Hallan, and Mr. and Mrs. Cox with four children,
fifty-seven female and nineteen male prisoners, twenty-three
soldiers, &amp;c.</p>
<p>"Commissioners of Crown Lands" became gentlemen of mark when
the new act, in force on the 1st of June, entitled the following
cavaliers to have two stalwart policemen armed <i>cap-á-pie en
poursuivant</i> at a respectful distance: of such&mdash;the
quality of the bush&mdash;the <i>Government Gazette</i> on that
day enumerated the respected names: for Port Macquarie, Henry
Oakes:</p>
<p>New England, J.G. Macdonald: Liverpool Plains, Mayne: Bligh,
Hunter: Wellington, L.V. Dulhunty: Lachlan, H. Cosby:
Murrumbidgee, H. Bingham: Maneroo, J. Lambie: Port Phillip, H.F.
Gisborne; but their gentlemen-at-arms had not been yet fully
equipped.</p>
<p>And at length the ever misleading perplexity of one name's
"double-dub"&mdash;so common in the colony&mdash;is for the
future obviated by an act of common sense and convenience; for
the last gracious word of Sir George Gipps in December was issued
in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the 7th, directing that "in
order to avoid confusion, the river entering Shoal Bay in
latitude 29 deg. 26 min. S., commonly called the 'Big River' (a
popular description in the bush of many a water course), shall
for the future be called the Clarence."</p>

<p>"A report of observations made during the progress of a late
tour, on the face of the country, lying between Liverpool Plains
and the shores of Moreton Bay, in New South Wales; comprehending
a portion of the interior within the parallels of 28 deg. and 32

Remarks</span>.</p>
<p>"We are living in a land, the physical constitution of which
differs strangely from every other portion of our globe * with a
superficial extent that has been estimated at more than
three-fourths of that of Europe, yet furnishes (as far as a
minute examination of its various shores has been effected) no
river by which a knowledge of the capabilities of a distant
interior might be acquired, or the produce of its soil wafted to
its coasts.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Captain de Freycinet, in assigning proportions
to the principal divisions of the globe, estimates the surface of
Europe at 501,875 square French leagues, and that of Australia at
384,375, which is to Asia and America as 3 are to 7, or about
one-fourth of the superficial extent of Africa. Voy. aux Terres
Australis, p. 107.]</p>
<p>"Admitting the non-existence of rivers in so vast a country of
distant internal origin, or of magnitude approaching those noble
streams, which, rising in the more elevated regions of the Andes,
are disembogued on the shores of the American continent, we are
naturally led to the belief that no lofty ranges of mountains
traverse the central regions of this 'great southland', either in
the direction of the meridian, or transversely in that of the
parallel, but the rather, that large portions of our
intertropical interior will one day be discovered to be of low
depressed surface, subject in part, in seasons of much rain, to
extensive inundation. Indeed, it has been remarked by travellers
that, so far as their observations have extended, the high lands
of this continent are, on or at no great distance from its
shores, and navigators inform us that the more elevated ranges
occupy its eastern coast, which in several parallels they
immediately invest, and throughout a span of five hundred miles
within the tropical circle, are of primitive structure.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** King's Voyage 2, p. 570.]</p>
<p>"Fourteen years have elapsed since those enterprising
travellers, Messrs. Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth, upon
surmounting the many obstacles that lay in the way of internal
discovery in their day, passed that formidable barrier, our Blue
Mountain Ranges, and at once laid open an extensive western
country, not only to the persevering industry of the husbandman
and grazier, but to the no less laudable research of the zealous
naturalist.</p>
<p>"Almost immediately subsequent to that epoch in the annals of
our colony, expeditions were despatched to explore rivers, then
of recent discovery, in which Mr. Oxley, our able
Surveyor-General, to whom their direction was intrusted, was
engaged in 1817 and succeeding years; but the results of these
journies having tended in no small degree to check that spirit of
internal geographical inquiry, which had at those periods
manifested itself, no tour of any magnitude, with the view
towards the acquirement of a further knowledge of our interior
has, since those days to the present year, been undertaken, if we
except the laborious excursion of Messrs. J. Hovell and Hume from
the country of Argyle, across a portion of our southern interior,
to the shores of Port Philip. Of the relation of that long
journey, however, although it was performed three years since, we
have yet to learn the details. These, when published, will
doubtless prove highly interesting, not only to the colonist, but
to every well wisher of the country, since it has been affirmed
that those travellers, in the progress of their expedition,
passed through an undefined extent of beautiful country, the
richest that had been discovered at that period, "the finest in
point of soil, and incomparably the most English-like in point of
climate."</p>
<p>"Inheriting, as we have for many years, the shores of so vast
a country, when Nature's operations in her animal and vegetable
products, more especially from so many striking peculiarities,
inducing, not merely to create our surprise, but sufficient to
keep perpetually alive within us a laudable inquiring curiosity,
it is singular that at this advanced age of the colony, we should
be found in possession of so little well-founded information in
respect to the construction of our distant interior, since, in
our limited range of inquiry, although the surface of the country
has been found in parts made up of brushy waste, or noisome swamp
we have, nevertheless, been abundantly encouraged to advance on
meeting with the verdant glade amid the desert&mdash;been
gladdened at length to discover, beyond the confines of regions
scarcely tenantable by men, extensive tracts of rich pasture
land, possessing all the physical conditions requisite for the
well-being of civilized society.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">"<span class="a">Proposed Journey through the
Country lying interjacent to Liverpool Plains and Moreton
Bay</span>.</p>
<p>"To add to the scanty knowledge we have already acquired of
our interior, I had the honor to address myself to his Excellency
Lieutenant-General Darling on the subject in February last.</p>
<p>"In my communications to the Governor at that period I
respectfully submitted, that as little perhaps remained to be
done in the way of geographical research in the country bearing
S.W. from Lake George, it having been penetrated to the sea on
our south coast by Messrs. Hovell and Hume, I felt rather
desirous of explaining a portion of the unknown region lying
north from the latitude of 31 deg., to which parallel the country
had been seen by Mr. Oxley so far back as the year 1818.</p>
<p>"With these views, I had the honor to submit for his
Excellency's consideration and approval, the following proposed
plan of a journey I had long since had in contemplation: To
proceed, in the first instance, by the most direct and eligible
route from the colony to Peel's River, in the country on the
north-eastern skirts of Liverpool Plains, and situate between the
meridian of 150 deg. and 151 deg. in or about the parallel of 31
deg. S. Thence I proposed to penetrate north, in a line west of
the meridian of 151 deg. towards the shores of Moreton Bay, in
the parallel of 27 deg., with the view of ascertaining the
general features of the interjacent country; the character of its
vegetation, the nature of its soil, and the number, magnitude,
and direction of the streams, by which it was reasonable to
conclude a region comprehending more than three degrees of
latitude is doubtless watered. I further respectfully submitted
that should the condition of my horses, the state of my
provisions, and other circumstances justify it, upon my reaching
the northern point to which I might be enabled to penetrate, my
intention was, ere my return home, to occupy a portion of the
time in an excursion direct into the interior, with the
expectation of being able to gather a few facts in respect to the
presumed magnitude of those great marshes into which ('tis said)
all our western waters flow, to the eastern margin of which (in
30½ deg. south latitude) Mr. Oxley had descended in 1818. Should,
however, the circumstances of my expedition not permit of this
digression to the westward from that advanced step of my journey,
I finally submitted to his Excellency that, with the view more
fully to embody the chart, I would pursue my journey southerly
towards the colony, through that considerable range of country
lying east of the meridian of 151 deg. intermediate between my
projected line of outward route and the sea coast.</p>
<p>"As this plan of my proposed tour to the northern interior met
with the entire approbation of His Excellency, an ample
equipment, fully equal to the magnitude of the journey, and
agreeably to my requisitions, was directed to be prepared for me,
and as the various items were completed to my entire satisfaction
about the close of the month of March, I lost not a moment,
(notwithstanding the unfavourable lowering aspect of the
weather), in putting an establishment of six men and eleven
horses (of which eight were the property of the Crown) into
motion. To effect the more important points contemplated in this
journey, I provided myself with the following instruments. viz.:
a sextant, by Jones, divided to ten seconds, an artificial
horizon, a Schmalcalder's compass, a pocket chronometer, an
odometer or improved perambulator, and a mountain barometer, by
Jones, which latter I compared with others in possession of J.
Mitchell, Esq., of the General Hospital, who very obligingly
engaged to furnish me (upon my return home) with his daily
observations on the range of the mercurial column made in Sydney,
during the period of my proposed absence in the interior, in
order to enable me to compute, from data given by their
difference from my own, simultaneously noted, the mean elevation
above the level of the sea of the several stations or encampments
of my journey.</p>
<p>"Thus prepared for my winter's tour, I proposed to proceed in
the first instance with the party composing my expedition to
Segenhoe, the estate of J.P. Macqueen, Esq., M.P., on an upper
branch of Hunter's river, not more from its being in that direct
line of route which the plan of my journey had marked out than
from its proximity to the Dividing Range, over which my course
lay, and the assistance that would be afforded me by Mr.
Macintyre, the highly respectable agent and director of that
extensive and valuable farm, in passing that formidable chain of
mountains which separates the Coal river country from the great
levels of Liverpool Plains.</p>
<p>"Desirous of preserving the fresh condition of the horses in
this first stage of my journey, to enable them the better to meet
its after labours, they were despatched overland without their
loads, whilst the baggage, stores, and provisions for the use of
the expedition were conveyed round by sea to Hunter's river.</p>
<p>"Arriving at Segenhoe * on the 26th of the month, I was most
hospitably received by Mr. Macintyre, whose residence, together
with the village-like group of habitations of the farming
servants, was found eligibly situated on a tributary stream to
Hunter's, named the Page, about a mile and a half above the
confluence, and within twenty miles of the northern mountains,
the elevated points of which constitute so striking a feature of
the landscape of this most beautiful part of the Coal river
country.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A grant from the Crown, procured by influence
in England, as a means of provision for J.P. Macqueen, who had
brought himself to ruin by a corruptly contested election for
Bedfordshire.]</p>
<p>"The adjustment of the several pack-horse loads, and general
preparation for my departure being effected in the short period
of my stay at this station, I commenced my journey to the north
on the 30th March, with an establishment of six servants and
eleven horses, and with full provisions for fourteen weeks,
having determined, from the information I had obtained of its
practicability, to attempt my passage over the Dividing Range at
the head of a stream of Hunter's river, called Dartbrook, which
rises in a part of those mountains bearing to the N.W. about
thirty miles.</p>
<p>"The situation of Mr. Macintyre's house on Page's river was
found by observations to be as follows:&mdash;latitude by
meridional altitudes of the sun taken in an artificial horizon
and observed with an excellent sextant, being the mean of eight
observations taken chiefly on the return of the party to this
station in August, 32 deg. 6 min. 37 sees. S.; longitude by a set
of lunar distances, 150 deg. 57 min. 16 sees. E.; ** variation of
the needle, deduced by the mean of several sets of azimuths, 7
deg. 24 min. E.; and mean elevation above the level of the sea,
being the result of twenty-one distinct observations of the
mercurial column taken morning and evening, five hundred and
ninety-seven feet.</p>
<p class="foot">[** As this result accords nearly with the
meridian deduced by the actual survey of the country from
Newcastle, viz., 150 deg. 58 min. 45 sees. E., which (there is
reason to apprehend) places Segenhoe somewhat to the eastward of
its real position, it may be considered about its true
longitude.]</p>
<p>"On the 2nd May, having traced the narrow valley through which
Dartbrook flows, to its head immediately at the foot of the
mountains, we were joined by Mr. Macintyre, who had obligingly
tendered me his services to conduct the party over the more
difficult parts of the range, at a part by which he had himself
on a former occasion crossed those mountains to Liverpool
Plains.</p>
<p>"From the grassy hills immediately at the head of the valley,
we gained by great exertion the higher parts of the Dividing
Range, by climbing a narrow lateral ridge of so abrupt an
acclivity as repeatedly to render it necessary, rather than
endanger the lives of the horses, to disburden them of, portions
of their loads.</p>
<p>"Traversing the extreme summit of the range about two miles to
the westward, at a mean elevation of three thousand and eighty
feet above the level of the sea, a sloping grassy ridge enabled
us to descend to the head of a valley at the northern foot of the
mountains on the afternoon of the 4th, when the tents were
pitched until the morning of the following day. This encamping
ground, which was found by observation to be in latitude 31 deg.
50 min. S., and longitude (by account) 150 deg. 35 min. E., I
ascertained by barometrical admeasurement to be twelve hundred
and twenty-one feet lower than the summit of the range, or about
six hundred and seventy feet above the head of the opposite
valley of Dartbrook.</p>
<p>"Having safely passed this mountain barrier, the rock of which
I remarked was trap, we set out on our journey to the north at an
early hour on the morning of the 5th, intending to pass along the
eastern skirts of the vast lands before us, under as near as the
country would admit, the meridian of 150¾ deg. We soon descended
through the vale, at the head of which we had rested, to the more
even-surfaced open-wooded land, when on leaving a small creek
that had meandered with us from the mountain base, to wind its
course to the lower levels of the great plains,* which had just
opened to the view, we pursued our way through an extent of ten
miles of barren forest, wooded with stunted box and ironbark,
frequently interspersed with brush, which, from the languishing
state of its scanty vegetation generally, had evidently been
without water for several months.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The mean elevation of Liverpool Plains above
the sea shore (which Mr. Oxley their discoverer had no means of
determining) has always been considered much greater than recent
admeasurement has given. A series of interesting observations,
carefully made with an improved portable barometer by Jones, gave
me the following mean results, showing how much the surface of
the southern sides of these plains, which have evidently been
raised by the washings of soil from the adjacent boundary range,
is elevated above that of either the centre or northern margin.
The southern skirts are eleven hundred and twenty feet; the
central surface is about nine hundred and fifty feet, whilst the
northern limits are from eight hundred to eight hundred and forty
feet of perpendicular height above the level of the ocean.]</p>
<p>"Crossing a branch of the plains, in 38 deg. 38 min.,
stretching to the S.E. under the hills, and through which a small
rivulet wound northerly, the country before us was found to rise
to forest hills of ordinary elevation, lightly wooded with box
timber, and frequently very stony on their summits, the rock
itself being a coarse sandstone.</p>
<p>"The valleys, which were very confined, and occasionally
disposed to be brushy, as well as some intermediate patches of
level ground, furnished timbers of large dimensions, chiefly of
the apple tree and gum. Immediately to the westward of our line
of route, a chain of low thinly wooded great hills stretched
northerly, and interrupted the view of the main body of the
plains, whilst to the east were ridges, bold and precipitous,
assuming in some parts a lofty mountainous character, whence
issued several streams, which, after watering the various
valleys, intersected by our line of route, escape westerly to the
margin of the plains, where at length they unite in their course
to the north, and form Field's river of Mr. Oxley, by the channel
of which the eastern sides of those considerable levels are
drained.</p>
<p>"The hills (as already remarked) are composed of a coarse
grained sandstone, and in the valleys and heads of creeks was
remarked a breccia or pudding-stone, on which the former
reposed.</p>
<p>"On the 11th we reached the north-eastern angle of Liverpool
Plains, and passed the parallel of 31 deg. 2 min., in which
latitude Mr. Oxley had crossed Peel's river in his journey to
Port Macquarie, in 1818, and from which particular point of
intersection of that stream it was my intention to have taken a
new departure, the interior to the north of it being totally
unexplored by Europeans. The country, however, to east and
north-east of our line of route proving on examination to be by
far too broken, mountainous and rocky to permit my heavily laden
pack horses to penetrate to the channel of that stream,
conformably with the plan of my journey, their feet having
already sustained considerable injury in passing those stony
hills, which our line of route from the Dividing Range had
intersected, I determined to continue our course to the north
under the meridian at which we had arrived (about 150½ deg.),
being satisfied that as there could be no doubt of the waters of
the Peel falling internally, my course would intersect its
channel whenever the chain of lofty hills immediately to the
eastward of us, which appeared to stretch far to the north,
should either terminate, or become so detached or broken as to
allow of its escape to an obviously lower north-western
interior.</p>
<p>"Meeting with a rill of excellent water at the foot of a
grassy ridge (evidently one of the Melville Hills of Mr. Oxley),
I was induced to halt to allow my people to refasten the shoes of
several of the horses, which were nearly torn off by the rocky
irregular surface of the ground we had traversed in the progress
of our stages of the last two days. As it was early in the
afternoon, I climbed a hill distant about two miles to the N.W.,
to observe the features of the country before us. From the
eminence I had a more extended view of the broken mountainous
country at E. and N.E. than I had previously had from a lower
level, the precipitous aspect of which perfectly justifying my
abandonment of the design of attempting to penetrate east (in the
parallel 31 deg.) to the bank of Peel's river, as I had
originally contemplated.</p>
<p>"Beyond the nearest ridge of hills at those bearings, I could
perceive more elevated ranges, lying parallel with them, at
sufficient distance from each other to mark distinctly the
existence and direction of the ample vale to which the name of
Goulburn was given by Mr. Oxley in 1818. At north, the country
although hilly appeared very open to penetration, to points of
which, in the vicinity of Barrow's Valley of our able
Surveyor-General, I took bearings, and at N.W. and W.N.W. the eye
traversed a vast extent of wooded and seemingly level country,
through which Field's river of the chart winds its course to a
declining interior.</p>
<p>"At W. and S.W., I recognised points of Mr. Oxley's survey in
1818 which I had identified in my winter's excursion in 1825,
along the western side of Liverpool plains, particularly that
remarkable forest ridge which bounds Lushington Valley on the S.,
named on the chart Vansittart's Hills. Not the smallest trace of
human beings was perceived in an extensive range of country lying
between N.E. and W. by the way of N., but at S.W., large columns
of smoke, which rose from the surface of a distant region at that
bearing, showed it to be extensively fired by the natives.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 11th we quitted our resting place on
the creek, and pursuing a course to the S. of W. about three
miles, at length passed round the western extreme of the Melville
Hills, through a dry brushy tract of forest ground, and were then
enabled to shape a more direct line of route to the N.W. On this
line of course, which led us through a level wooded country,
scarcely one thousand feet above the sea coast, and alike
suffering with other parts under the severity of a long
protracted period of drought, we at length crossed the track of
Mr. Oxley in 1818, the observations at noon taken in the midst of
a dense brush of the drooping <i>acacia pendula</i>, giving us
for latitude 31 deg. 31 sees. N., which placed our position about
a mile to the north of that gentleman's line of route, after he
had forded Field's river. Upon penetrating beyond these brushes
of the grey-hued acacia above referred to, we pursued our way to
the N.W. about four miles, over a level declining country,
alternately forest ground and open plain, clothed with a
vegetation in part destroyed by the drought, the long continuance
of which was abundantly indicated by the extensive rents that had
been effected in the ground by the sun, the extremely parched
appearance of the surface, as well as the total absence of water
in channels, which evidently, from their shaded situation, afford
in seasons of ordinary humidity an ample supply. Amidst the
distressing circumstances of the country, we were not a little
surprised to observe upon reaching the skirts of the forest-land,
on the western side of a large patchy plain we had traversed, so
striking a change in the conditions of its grasses and vegetation
generally.</p>
<p>"We had evidently descended to a lower level than the spot on
which our tent had stood in the morning, and on entering the
wooded land bordering the plain, which was timbered with apple
trees (<i>angophor</i>) of large dimensions, we perceived that
the whole forest had been flooded to the depth of five feet! at
which height drift wood had been washed against the trunks of the
timber, and although the entire plain thereto adjacent, as also
other portions of the country south of it, nearly on the same
level had been at the same time subjected to like inundation, yet
the exposure of their open surface to the daily action of the
sun, for very many months, had so far parched its vegetable
products as to leave no clear evidence of the condition to which
it is at periods subjected. It was, therefore, only under
protection from the solar ray beneath the umbrage of densely
foliaged apple trees, that plants, growing even in a soil
fattened by the deposits of these floods, could assume amidst the
extremes of a dry season, the luxuriance of growth in which we
had observed them.</p>
<p>"The inclination to the S.W. of the heads of certain plants
growing in this forest marked distinctly the direction which the
current, upon the retiring of the waters of the last great flood,
had taken, showing also the point of declination of the country
at this particular part. Having accomplished twelve miles, and
satisfied from every appearance around us that we were in the
immediate neighbourhood of a water of larger magnitude than any
stream we had passed since we quitted Hunter's river, we directed
our course through the forest N.N.W., towards the base of a range
of hills, the S.E. head of which overlooked the plain we had
traversed, and in a mile came upon the left bank of a river which
bent itself round the southern extreme of these hills in its
course to the westward.</p>
<p>"The width of the channel we ascertained to be about one
hundred and fifty yards, but of this breadth about one third only
was occupied by water, which formed a succession of deep pools
and pebbly rapids.</p>
<p>"The bank on which I had encamped was about thirty feet of
perpendicular height above the low level of this river, and an
idea may be formed of the vast bodies of water that at periods
flow through its channel to the westward when it is observed that
there were marks of the floods in the forest ground four feet
above the level of the spot on which the tents were pitched.
Deriving its origin in the very hilly country to the N.E. of us,
which evidently formed a secondary dividing range, separating
this part of country from that through which Peel's river flows,
this stream, upon bending its course round the southern
termination of the ridge of hills immediately on its opposite
bank, wends its way to the westward, and in a few miles joins
Field's river in its progress north-westerly.</p>
<p>"To the stream which had not been previously seen by
Europeans, I gave the name of Mitchell's river, as a compliment
to the medical officer to whom I am so much indebted for the very
valuable details of barometrical observations, taken in Sydney
during my absence on the journey.</p>
<p>"Very recent marks of the native's hatchet on the trees and a
well-beaten path along the bank of the river, with other traces
of the aborigine, showed us that this solitary part of the
interior was not without inhabitants, and about sunset some
distant voices were distinctly heard, but neither the savage
himself or the glare of his fire was seen. In a deep pond
immediately beneath the tents our people were successful with
their hooks, several fine fish of the cod of the western waters
were taken, but so eager were the fish to seize the baited hooks
that several with portions of line attached were carried away in
attempting to lift them from their native element.</p>
<p>"The end of an eclipse of the moon, which took place in the
evening at 7 hrs. 55 min. 19 sec. apparent time, as observed with
a tolerably good telescope, gave further longitude of the
particular part of Mitchell's river whereon we had encamped 150
deg. 27 min. 15 sec. E. This served to compare with its meridian'
reduced from that of Segenhoe on Hunter's river, which gave a
difference of two minutes to the westward&mdash;viz., 150 deg. 25
min. 15 sec. E. However, as there were reasons for considering
the latter result the more correct, it has been preferred.</p>
<p>"The latitude ascertained by a solar meridional altitude
observed on the 12th was 30 deg. 59 min. 12 sec. S., and the mean
elevation of the bed of the river above the level of the sea
proved from barometrical data to be only eight hundred and forty
feet, which is nearly one hundred feet lower than the central
path of Liverpool Plains.</p>
<p>"12th. Continuing our journey to the north. Immediately on
observing the sun's altitude at noon, we were led over a
continuation of level forest ground, subject to inundation, about
two miles, when we again met the river, running from the N.E.,
and having forded it at a pebbly fall, pursued our way through a
forest of fine large blue gum. In another mile we came upon an
open plain stretching to the N.W., and bounded on the S.W. by a
continuation of the forest range, along the eastern base of which
Mitchell's river flows. Skirting this plain on its eastern
margin, and trusting to the hope of finding water, I altered my
line of route to the N.N.E., but upon advancing about four miles
through a forest country, almost denuded of grass and herbage by
long droughts and the destroying effects of natives' fires, and
without the slightest trace of water, felt obliged to return to
the river, the bank of which we reached about an hour after
sunset.</p>
<p>"Here we were again glad to pitch our tents, and as there was
abundance of grass for the horses, I determined to rest the whole
of the 13th, in order to afford them the benefit of a patch of
luxuriant pasture, such as we were apprehensive from the aspect
of the country before us northerly we could not expect to meet
with, until we again came upon a living stream.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 14th we again advanced on our journey
to the north, through a dry uninteresting forest land, broken by
watercourses, very level of surface, and thinly wooded with the
usual timber.</p>
<p>"Occasionally we penetrated smaller patches of brush, scarcely
interesting even to the botanist, and again gained a more open
surface of barren forest ground, perfectly bare of grass or
herbage, and exhibiting an arid argillaceous soil, rent in chasms
by an obviously long protracted drought.</p>
<p>"Upon completing thirteen miles, I remarked the fall of the
low ridges over which we had been travelling throughout our last
three miles, to be to the eastward, I therefore altered our
course in search of water, which most fortunately finding, we
rested for the day about five p.m.</p>
<p>"Resuming our journey at an early hour on the 15th, we pursued
a course to the N.N.W. through a heavily timbered, but parched
level country. Our sixth mile brought us to the base of a ridge
of barren forest hills, the declivities of which were deeply
grooved by the rains of former years, that had also laid bare
portions of the rock formation, which proved to be an
argillaceous schistus. Immediately on passing this ridge, the
southern flanks of which my horses climbed with considerable
difficulty, we intersected in about two miles a stream running
briskly over a rocky bed to the eastward, which in consequence of
the general steepness of its immediate banks, gave us some
trouble to pass. "Upon gaining the rising forest ground on its
north bank, I was induced to direct a halt, not knowing (in a
country so generally parched by an excess of dry weather) at what
distance water might again be found. Other inducements to rest
here were, its grasses were much fresher than those the open
forest furnished, and we had, moreover, effected about nine miles
distant to the north. The latitude of our encamping ground
reduced from the observation at noon, was 30 deg. 36 min. S., and
our barometer showed us we were upwards of a thousand feet above
our station on Mitchell's river, into which the rapid rivulet on
which we had rested ultimately falls, after meandering easterly
and southerly among the hills. To individuals accustomed to live
only amidst the charms of society, the solitary aspect of the
greater portion of this day's stage would have proved most
distressing. Scarcely a bird, not a kangaroo, emu, or native dog,
or the evidence (even of the most ancient standing) of the
wandering Indian, were remarked, until we had arrived in the
immediate neighbourhood of an encamping ground, when our dogs
gave chase to a solitary kangaroo.</p>
<p>"To us it was no less distressing to observe, as we travelled
onward northerly, to what a degree vegetation was languishing
amidst the severity of a drought of so protracted a period, that
we might with great truth say no rain had fallen to benefit
either herbage or the soil during the last twelve or fifteen
months.</p>
<p>"16-18. Our course to the north throughout the three
succeeding days led us over a hilly and in several parts broken
country, which rose progressively in elevation, until we had
attained a height exceeding two thousand feet above the sea
shore.</p>
<p>"Occasionally a narrow valley, bearing a matted grass of the
growth of two or three years, and bounded on either side by
forest hills of steep acclivity, wooded with small trees, and
grassy to their summits, afforded some diversity of feature in
the line of country penetrated, which in general was that of open
forest, furnishing the usual timbers of stunted growth, totally
inapplicable to any purpose of rural economy. The water courses
presented rocky deep channels, from twelve to twenty feet in
width, which, in seasons less adverse, assumed the characters of
respectable creeks.</p>
<p>"On the 17th, at noon, when our observed latitude was</p>
<p>30 deg. 22 min. S., we reached the bank of a stream, which
received the name of Buddle's river, and although there was but
little water in its channel, which was thirty yards wide, it
nevertheless bore evident marks of being in seasons of heavy
rains swollen to the height of twenty feet.</p>
<p>"This small river dipped to the E.N.E., and as the country
appeared at length to be much more open in that direction than
had been remarked in any part since we crossed to the north of 31
deg., it is without doubt a tributary to Peel's river.</p>
<p>"It was on the banks of Buddle's river that natives to the
number of five persons were seen for the first time during this
journey. Being myself a little in advance of the horses, I had no
sooner reached the right bank than my attention was arrested by
the appearance of smoke rising from the forest ground on the
opposite bank, and immediately I perceived four natives and a
child, who having previously observed me, were standing for the
moment in a state of extreme surprise and r alarm. I called out
to a man who stood in front of the fire, and who was armed with
short spears, signifying by signs indicative of a friendly
intention on my part&mdash;my wish to court an interview. To all
my overtures he simply made a brief reply, and then on seeing the
pack-horses descend to ford the river, he took to his heels, and
with the other adults (seemingly women), ran off up the river,
and immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>"19th. We resumed our journey at an early hour from a rocky
creek on which we had encamped, and having advanced about three
miles through a lonely uninteresting forest of tolerably level
surface, we reached the base of an abrupt ridge of barren hills,
timbered with small iron-bark, and deeply grooved by sharp narrow
gullies, which, declining in a northerly direction, fell into a
grassy bottom. Upon passing in a variety of courses over the
banks of these arid ridges, suddenly a break in the hills at the
N.W. afforded us a confined view of a level wooded country of
unbounded extent, and to which there appeared an approach by a
narrow wall before us. Descending without much difficulty to an
apple-tree flat, the valley gradually expanded, being, however,
bounded by very steep rocky ridges on its eastern and western
sides, and watered by a small limpid stream which, originating in
the congregated hills at its head, murmured over the stony bed of
a channel, which wound through its centre beneath a shade of
swamp oak. On completing our eighth mile, I observed the
meridional altitude of the sun, which gave for our latitude 30
deg. 2 min. 30 sec. S., and then continuing our journey north,
along the valley other six miles, I was induced to encamp on the
bank of the creek, on a patch of the most luxuriant pasture we
had met with since we left Hunter's river.</p>
<p>"We were not a little surprised to observe at the head of this
valley, so remote from any farming establishment, the traces of
horned cattle, only two or three days old, as also the spots on
which from eight to a dozen of these animals had reposed, at a
period so recent that the grassy blade, which was of long
luxuriant growth, had not recovered its upright position.</p>
<p>"From what point of the country these cattle had originally
strayed appeared at first difficult to determine. On
consideration, however, it was thought by no means impossible
that they were stragglers from the large wild herds that are well
known to be occupying plains around Arbuthnot's Range, S.W. one
hundred and seventy-five miles from this vale. Upon the range on
the eastern side of the valley I discovered several undescribed
plants of the most interesting description, observing also that
the rock, which was a species of flint of curious laminated
figure, like some agates, reposed on large masses of serpentine,
obvious in the lower parts, and in the base of the ridge.</p>
<p>"During our stay in the vale, which I named after a friend in
the Royal Staff Corps, Stoddart's Valley, I was enabled to
determine the position of my encampment with tolerable precision.
The result of my observations on the 20th were as follows, viz.:
latitude observed, 29 deg. 58 min. 52 sec. S.: longitude by
account reduced from the meridian of Segenhoe, 150 deg. 33 min.
E.; longitude by distances (sun west of moon), 150 deg. 37 min.;
longitude mean, 150 deg. 35 min. E.; variation by azimuth, 8 deg.
1 min. 30 sec. E. The mean of the results of barometrical
computation, which showed us a very considerable declension of
country to the north, in our last stage gave us a mean elevation
of only eleven hundred and sixty feet above the level of the
sea.</p>
<p>"On Monday, the 21st of May, we prosecuted our journey to the
north along the valley, the beauties of which were progressively
developed as we advanced. The ridges, which limited the view on
either side gradually as they stretched to the north, lowered in
elevation, and assumed the character of open forest hills, thinly
wooded with small trees, and altogether less stoney. Passing over
some fine patches of grassy flat, clothed sparingly with apple
trees of, however, robust habit, we followed the creek that
waters this extensive cattle range, about seven miles, to its
discharge into a river of large dimensions, evidently the Peel of
Mr. Oxley, which having flowed from the southward, through a very
gradual fall of country, to a level of little more than nine
hundred feet above the sea shore, at length winds its course by a
creek, through the eastern hills, and passing the northern
extremity of Stoddart's Valley, escapes (as Field's river) to a
still lower north-western interior.</p>
<p>"The channel of this river at the ford by which we passed it
exhibited a bed of gravel, exceeding two hundred and fifty yards
in breadth, which at periods of great rains is occupied to the
depth of twelve and fifteen feet, as we gathered from the flood
marks on its outer banks. The long continuance of dry weather,
beneath the effects of which an unknown extent of the interior
appeared to be suffering, had, however, diminished the waters of
the Peel to a breadth not exceeding fifty yards, and to a depth
so trifling that it was fordable in many parts. On crossing this
river, we halted on an elevated patch of forest ground on its
right bank, the day being far spent. As we descended Stoddart's
Valley to the river, we observed several of the trees had been
completely and recently barked by the natives, and on the bank of
the river opposite our encampment large bodies of smoke rose from
the fired grass and herbage, but we neither saw or heard any of
the Indians, the very recent prints of whose feet (as well adult
as child) we clearly perceived on the sands at the ford.</p>
<p>"22nd and 23rd. Quitting the right bank of Peel's river (which
we found by our barometer to be only nine hundred and eleven feet
above the level of the sea), we pursued our route to the N.N.W.,
immediately at the base of a continuation of the eastern range of
hills, which again assumed a bold and rocky character.</p>
<p>"We passed through an uniformly barren tract of wooded
country, frequently very broken and ridgy, and as the declivity
of the several gullies were of considerable dip towards the
channel of the Peel, which extended along the eastern base of a
densely wooded range, bearing west of us, we found the whole of
the day's stage exceedingly badly watered. At a distance of about
fourteen miles north from the ford of Peel's river the country
considerably improves, and by being less encumbered with useless
timber and brushwood, and therefore more open to the sun and air,
the soil, which had assumed a darker colour, was productive of a
tolerable clothing of grass and esculent vegetation. The thickly
wooded ranges, to which the name of Drummond was attached, lying
a few miles to the west of our route, was at length, as we
advanced, observed to terminate, and the country beyond its
northern extreme appeared from the higher grounds, near which we
were travelling, to be well timbered, but a level, declining
clearly to the northward and westward.</p>
<p>"At last the rocky ridge of hills which had for some days
entirely circumscribed our view at that bearing, also falling to
the ordinary level, the country assumed a picturesque appearance.
Detached hills of moderate height diversified the surface, which
being very thinly wooded with small trees, furnished on their
slopes in seasons less destructive to vegetation an abundance of
sheep pasture. To two of these hills, remarkable for their
likeness to each other, I attached the names of Carlyle and
Little, after friends on Hunter's river. They are formed of a
reddish sandstone with which the summits are crowned.</p>
<p>"To the north-east the country rises to a considerable
elevation, and a very lofty rocky range crowned with the
picturesque cypress, and from the extreme ridge of which rose a
very sharp cone, received the name of "Masterton".</p>
<p>"At noon of the 23rd we came upon the wide but shallow reedy
channel of a river, forming, however, at this season simply a
deep chain of ponds, at which the observed latitude proved to be
29 deg. 34 min. 44 sees. S. This we traced about four miles to
the N.E., and then encamped on its immediate bank, where there
were some good strips of grassy flat, affording our cattle
excellent food.</p>
<p>"The marks of the natives' hatchet (of stone) were observable
on the trees, but the few Indians that wander through these
lonely regions in quest of food appear very careful to avoid us;
the train of laden horses, the numbers of my men and dogs
doubtless alarming those who may have seen us from the hills so
much as rather to urge their flight than induce them to seek a
communication with us.</p>
<p>"24-26. On crossing the reedy channel of this river, we passed
over a low stony cypress ridge, and among a mass of vegetation
characterising the flora of the Bathurst country, I discovered a
few plants not previously met with, of, however, established
well-known genera. The rocks of this ridge are of the ferruginous
sandstone of the Blue Mountain Ranges, and as quantities of the
disintegrated parts of this formation had been washed by the
rains upon the lower forest grounds in the neighbourhood, the
surface (resting on an argillaceous subsoil) was covered with a
barren grit to the depth of four inches. At our fifth mile we
rose by an easy acclivity to the pitch of a forest ridge, when we
remarked a change had taken place in the rock formation, which
was abundantly shown by the dark colour and superior quality of
the soil. It was a trap exceedingly porous, forming amygdaloid
containing nodules of chalcedony. Upon reaching the extreme part
of the ridge, we observed before us a very moderately undulated
country, interspersed with patches of plain. A series of forest
hills and intervening valleys furnishing abundance of grass, but
perfectly destitute of water, succeeded in our course to the
north throughout the succeeding seven miles. At length we arrived
at a patch of forest ground, that had been recently fired, and as
I was induced to believe, that as the natives had evidently
passed through these woods within the last three days, water
could not be far distant, I directed a diligent search to be made
for it. In a mile further northerly to our great joy, a large
clay hole was found containing an ample sufficiency of that
precious element to meet all our demands, and although stagnant
evidently for some months, was nevertheless of a good
quality.</p>
<p>"The pasture in several parts of this day's stage was
excellent considering the distress to which vegetation generally
had been subjected by the drought of the year, and although the
timbers were uniformly indifferent and chiefly of box, the
general appearance seemed to augur that we are on the verge of an
improving country north of us, and certainly of easy access.</p>
<p>"25th. As I had been led to conclude, so we found the country,
for we had not advanced a mile before we reached a patch of
plain, of a rich black soil, bounded by low thinly wooded forest
hills, which gave the whole a very pretty picturesque appearance.
Over this plain we travelled N. by E. to the opposite piece of
wooded land, passing which we came upon a second plain,
stretching as did the former east and west several miles, their
breadth being about a mile and a quarter.</p>
<p>"It was distressing, however, to observe so much fine black
soil, sound, dry, and crumbling beneath the foot, as these plains
possess, rich moreover in grasses and herbage, languishing for
rain, and without channels of sufficient depth or capacity on
their ample surface to retain water permanently throughout the
year. A succession of open forest hills and waterless downs
characterised the face of the country to the close of a journey
of twelve miles, which terminated in a stony gully, in which
after some search we were fortunate to discover fine water,
retained in narrow rocky cavities. Upon reaching the brow of the
forest ridge, immediately over our encampment (which reduced from
the observation at noon, was in 29 deg. 10 min. S.), the hills to
the westward were observed to terminate, and a level open
country, bounded on the N.N.W. and N. only by the very distant
horizon, broke upon our view, which although it appeared for the
most part very densely wooded (probably with small stunted trees)
nevertheless exhibited patches of open plain, diversifying the
otherwise monotonous aspect of a vast expanse of surface. I could
perceive from the spot on which I made these observations the
level country as far east as N.N.E., but the terminating points
of all the eastern forest ridges, facing the west, projecting to
an intersection of that line of bearing, my further observation
easterly was prevented. The mean elevation above the sea of our
tents was twelve hundred and twenty-eight feet, which placed us
upwards of three hundred feet above the bed of Peel's river.</p>
<p>"26th. Pursuing our journey to the N.N.E., through an extent
exceeding five miles of barren forest ground, in part closely
timbered with small ironbark, and interspersed with thickets of
plants frequent on the skirts of Liverpool Plains, we at length
intersected the sandy channels of a river, which in other seasons
than the present must be highly important to the grazing flats on
its bank, forming in periods of great rains a rapid stream, ten
feet deep and fifty feet wide.</p>
<p>"The distress of the season, so often spoken of in the
narration of this journey, appeared, however, to have entirely
deprived this ample channel of its waters, and as its sandy bed
was in part overgrown by a brush of woody plants usually
affecting arid desert situations, this circumstance alone
afforded me the clearest proof of its having been dried up many
months.</p>
<p>"Amidst this dearth it was with surprise we noticed how
extraordinarily the native grasses had resisted the dry weather
on the upper bank of this dried watercourse. They were fresh,
verdant, and doubtless nutritive, affording abundance of
provision to the many kangaroos that were bounding around us.</p>
<p>"On crossing this sandy channel we continued our original
course (N.N.E.) over a plain or flat clear of trees, two miles
wide, the soil of which we found excellent, but very dry, the
surface exhibiting deep rents, occasioned by the action of the
solar ray.</p>
<p>"Apprehensive that we should not readily meet with water by
pursuing the course we had preserved steadily since we set forth
in the morning, I was induced, on passing over the brow of a
ridge and observing a hilly country to the eastward, to alter my
line of route to the E.N.E., in the hope of meeting with a
sufficiency of that element for our horses and selves, in an
advance of two or three miles, towards more elevated grounds.</p>
<p>"Penetrating about two miles, through an arid desert forest,
of a deep sandy soil, and timbered with cypress and red gum, we
reached the rocky margin of a creek, by which the waters that
fall from the hills to the eastward are conveyed to probably a
greater channel, at a lower level in the neighbourhood. I was led
to this inference, not simply from the bed of this creek forming
a succession of falls, showing me its considerable dip to a lower
country in the vicinity, but more especially from the numbers of
the white cockatoo that appeared about us on the wing&mdash;these
birds, it having been long remarked, flock about large rivers, as
well in the colony as the interior beyond Bathurst.</p>
<p>"Water being immediately found in the rocky excavations of
this creek, and grass of an ordinary quality on its margin, I
directed the party to halt and encamp. During the 27th (being
Sunday) I rested my people and horses. The morning was
exceedingly lowering, but as the day advanced it cleared
sufficiently to allow me to take the necessary observations for
the determination of our position. Their results placed us as
follows on the chart: latitude observed 29 deg. 0.0 min. 0.2 sec.
S.; longitude, by account, 150 deg. 40 min. 15 sec. E. Variation
of compass, 7 deg. 53 min. E. The mean of several observations of
the height of the mercurial column, taken morning and evening,
gave us only an elevation of eight hundred and forty-two feet
above the sea shore, which is lower than the bed of Peel's river
at our ford!</p>
<p>"We had at length gained the parallel of 29 deg., and having
consumed more than half of the original stock of provisions with
which I had quitted the colony, it became absolutely necessary
that I should at once determine, not only the distance to which I
might possibly penetrate further to the northward with the
limited means I have at command, after laying aside six weeks'
full rations for consumption during the journey homeward, but
also the precise direction of our route onward, under all the
circumstances of the reduced condition of my horses, the arid
state of the country, and the aspect of the weather, that bear
upon me, and that I must of necessity be governed by, in all my
future movements. Upon inspecting my horses, I found that
notwithstanding the extreme care of my people, the backs and
sides of several had become much galled by their saddles, and all
were much reduced and debilitated by the labour of the journey,
the parched up state of the pasturage, and the general poverty of
the country through which we had travelled. To these points of
consideration I subjoined the circumstance of the low level to
which we had descended, the barren country it presented and the
probability that by pursuing our course further north (the
declination of the country being evidently at that point of the
compass), we should descend to an arid region of that scrubby
country totally destitute of grass or esculent vegetable, where
the lives of my horses would be placed in imminent danger.</p>
<p>"Viewing all these circumstances as connected with my
situation at this encampment, and regarding the preservation of
my horses as paramount to every other consideration, I felt
bound, although reluctantly, to determine on a deviation from the
line of northern course the plan of my tour had prescribed.</p>
<p>"I, therefore, resolved to pursue my journey more to the
eastward, not only to secure to my half famished horses a more
certain and nutritive provision than that on which they had for
some time past subsisted, which it was reasonable to suppose the
higher lands in that direction would furnish, but also with the
view of connecting (upon penetrating to the meridian of 152 deg.,
and north to the parallel of 28 deg.) my sketch of those parts of
the interior through which we have travelled with the country in
the vicinity of Moreton Bay, by bearings to such of its fixed
points as I might identify, and especially to the cone of Mount
Warning. The rocks of the creek on which we had rested is a
friable freestone, of a much whiter colour than is usually to be
observed. The gully appeared to have been the resort of the few
natives of these desert regions, who have from period to period
availed themselves of the softness of the rocks, to form edges to
their mogos or hatchets of stone of a harder description. The
traces of these operations, as well of a distant period as of
recent date, were observed on the surface of the stony ledges in
various parts of the creek. Among the birds observed about our
tents we remarked a parrot of large size not heretofore seen. The
feathers of its head were snow white, whilst its body appeared of
an uniform green; the wings, which were also of that color,
presenting on their outer sides a brownish hue. Only two birds of
this species were seen at the water holes, probably the male and
female, and they proved so shy that no opportunity was afforded
to shoot them.</p>
<p>"28th, Monday. The inference I had drawn from the structure of
the creek, and the presence of the white cockatoo, of the
existence of a river in the neighbourhood, proved this morning to
be perfectly just, for we had not proceeded three miles to the
N.N.E., through a continuation of desert, before we came to the
left bank of a stream, presenting a handsome reach, half a mile
in length, thirty yards wide, and evidently very deep. Its bed,
which was of a gravel containing many large water-worn pebbles of
quartz and jasper, was skirted by lofty swamp oaks, bearing on
their branches flood marks at least twenty feet above its
channel. When, therefore, its waters are swollen to that height,
it forms a rapid river from eighty to one hundred yards in
breadth, as I ascertained by the measured distance of the outer
banks from each other, on which the gigantic swamp oaks grow.</p>
<p>"This stream, which received the name of Dumaresq's river, in
honour of the family, to which His Excellency the Governor is so
intimately connected, rises in a mountainous country to the N.E.,
at an elevation (determined in the progress of this journey) of
nearly three thousand feet above the sea shore, and after
pursuing a western course for about one hundred miles, along a
considerable declivity of country, falls two thousand one hundred
feet to the spot at which we had crossed its channel, the
perpendicular height of which above the ocean,* I found by
barometrical admeasurement to be only eight hundred and forty
feet, which is about the mean level of the northern sides of
Liverpool Plains. Tracing the left bank up, about half a mile, we
found a ford, which enabled us to cross over safely, and resume
our journey to the N.N.E.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By a reference to the chart it will be seen
that this particular part of Dumaresq's river is about one
hundred and seventy statute miles west from the coast line.]</p>
<p>"Passing over some stony ridges of trifling elevation
immediately on the right bank of the river, we penetrated about
eleven miles through an arid sandy forest ground wooded with
small iron-bark and cypress.</p>
<p>"Upon accomplishing our fourteenth mile (by the odometer) the
country continued nearly a perfect level, clothed with small
blighted timber and much scrubby underwood, but without the
smallest indication of water, which, however, could not be hoped
for in a region the surface of which we found so generally coated
with a loose reddish sand to the depth of several inches.</p>
<p>"In this situation we found ourselves at an advanced hour of
the afternoon, and as the sun was rapidly declining on the lower
levels westerly, it became necessary to determine at once on the
course we should pursue onward, since by continuing our route at
N.N.E. it appeared evident we should penetrate more deeply into
the midst of the desert. As there appeared a slight depression of
country easterly, I directed my people to the north-east, and at
the same time despatched a man at that point to search for water.
Another mile brought us to a broad, but flat, shallow sandy
channel, dipping to the N.N.E., in which was found a waterhole
just dry. With renovated hopes we traced it downwards, and
finding many proofs of the recent existence of water on the
surface, continued about one and a half miles further, when a
small pool was discovered, fringed around with the aquatic plant,
known to botanists by the name <i>philydrum lanuginosum</i>. At
this small pond, scarcely six feet in diameter, we most gladly
halted, after accomplishing a long stage of nineteen miles,
through a tract of country, in the extremes of sterility, quite
destitute of water, and in an atmospheric temperature of 75 degs.
The thermometer at sunset stood at 70 deg., and the mean results
of barometrical computation showed me that we were even lower
than the bed of Dumaresq's river: our encampment was only eight
hundred and eleven feet above the level of the ocean. Early on
the morning of the 29th we quitted our resting place, on which my
half famished horses had scarcely found a blade of grass, and
continuing our course to the N.N.E., almost immediately passed
beyond the sandy surface to that of a stiff clay, inducing me to
hope we were on the verge of a better country, although the level
continued the same. In this we were not deceived, for we had
scarcely effected two miles before we reached the bank of a small
river, falling westerly, about fifteen yards wide, presenting at
this season simply the disunited form of a chain of stagnant deep
ponds or reaches a quarter of a mile in length. Traversing the
level forest flat, through which this rivulet winds its course,
we immediately entered a thick brush of cypress and acacia, and
having penetrated, with great difficulty to the horses, about two
miles to the N.E., rain, which had been threatening since
daybreak, began to fall, with every appearance of continuing
throughout the day. Totally ignorant of the extent of this
thicket, which towered over our heads to the height of
twenty-five feet, or to what distance we should be obliged to
travel before we again found water, I deemed it prudent to return
to the rivulet we had left, and encamp. This we effected just
about noon, in time to square an observation of the meridional
altitude of the sun, between the showers, which placed us, in
consequence of our extraordinary stage of the preceding day, as
far north as 28 deg. 45 min. ¾ sec.</p>
<p>"30th. The fineness of the morning, after a continued rain
throughout the preceding night, invited us to advance forward at
an early hour, our burdened horses having, moreover, been
materially benefited by the grazing they had met with on the
margin of the rivulet on which we had rested. The remarks I had
already made on the seeming extent of the northern brushes, led
me to hope that an E.N.E. course would carry us perfectly clear
of those almost impervious thickets. On this course, however, we
had not proceeded two miles before we discovered, with more than
ordinary concern, that their greater body stretched across our
line of route to due east.</p>
<p>"There was therefore no alternative left us but to enter them,
with the hope that by pursuing steadily our course we should more
readily reach a clearer open forest, on their north-eastern side.
It was nine o'clock when we passed their southern margin, and
although their breadth did not exceed two miles, such were the
difficulties to the baggage horses, that we were nearly three
hours in effecting a passage through to a patch of clear forest
ground, through which we were enabled to pursue our way to the
north-east upwards of a mile, when we were most agreeably
surprised to meet with a rivulet bending from the eastward to the
north-west, the forest ground on either side furnishing a richer
and altogether more luxuriant growth of young grass than we had
met with at any stage of our journey. It was a subject of great
astonishment to us to meet with so beautiful a sward of grass,
permanently watered by an active stream, after traversing that
tract of desert forest, and penetrating brushes the extremes of
sterility in its immediate vicinity. The presence of a fine piece
of pasturage on the banks of a beautiful stream, in parts fifteen
yards in width, to which I gave the name of Macintyre's Brook,**
after my friend at Segenhoe, again induced me to cherish the hope
that we were on the confines of a better country. We had,
however, difficulties new and fresh to encounter ere the labours
of the day were closed.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The situation of our point of intersection of
Macintyre's Brook on the chart is as follows: latitude, 28 deg.
44 min. S.; longitude 150 deg. 48 min. E., the elevation of its
head above the level of the sea being not more than eight hundred
and ten feet.]</p>
<p>"Leaving Macintyre's Brook, which occupied us some little time
in fording, owing to its depth and extraordinary rapidity of its
current, we resumed our course to the N.E. Compact thickets of
like description with those we had passed again stretched from
east to west, over a surface of country so truly level as to
afford us, as far as we could observe, not the slightest rise
whence any observation might have been made of the extent of
these jungles, or the direction, supposing them to be strips and
not extensive bodies, in which they were disposed in these arid
regions. Finding ourselves thus hemmed in, and altogether with a
very discouraging prospect before us, I nevertheless determined
to persevere on my course to the N.E., bearing, however, in mind
that should we fail in our endeavours to effect a passage through
them to more open grounds, after a few hours' exertion, we could
at least return on our track to the brook, where our horses would
rest on good pasture, and on the bank of which we might
subsequently pursue our way to the eastward; although, perhaps,
on a course in the first instance not better than E.S.E. As these
thickets from their very margin presented a density almost
impervious to pack horses, I directed an active man to follow me
with an axe, to remove every obstacle that might prevent their
passing forward in the course I endeavoured steadily to pursue.
In many parts the quantities of fallen timber were considerable,
and the stems of an acacia (fifteen feet high) were so closely
grown together, and interwoven with other plants, as to present
at first view a barrier altogether impenetrable. However, a
laborious circuitous route enabled us to avoid those intricacies,
and as we subsequently came upon small patches much thinner
brushed, and more open to the sun and air, whereon the wearied
horses were allowed to breathe, we were encouraged in no ordinary
degree to advance forward. Thus we continued until an advanced
hour of the afternoon, when having cut a passage about four miles
for the horses, we were rejoiced to reach an open clear forest,
through which we pushed our way to the N.E. without further
inconvenience. Meeting with a chain of ponds in about three
miles, I was exceedingly glad to rest, as both men and horses
were sinking beneath the labours of the day. The course and
distance made good, notwithstanding the difficulties of the
stage, being E. 41 N., magnetic eleven miles.</p>
<p>"31st. The day's stage to the northward and eastward was
extended through a rising wooded country, consisting of stony
hills of moderate elevation and narrow shallow valleys, often
brushed with the prevailing acacia of the country, and very
indifferently watered.</p>
<p>"At our fourteenth mile we came unexpectedly on a patch of
good grass on a flat heavily timbered with blue gum, where, upon
finding a sufficiency of water, I halted. From the summit of an
open elevated forest ridge, which I climbed in the earlier period
of this day's stage, an extensive view was afforded me of the
country at all points. At an estimated distance of, perhaps,
eighty miles, I perceived an apparently low detached range,
stretched east and west, from N. 2 deg. W. to N. 12 deg.; and,
somewhat more easterly, another range, pointed in the centre,
bearing N.N.E., was remarked, the country around them being
exceedingly level. Hence, looking easterly, the country appeared
to rise progressively, and ridges of more than ordinary elevation
extended towards loftier ranges, which may probably be perceived
from the coast line. From W.S.W., by the way of west, and thence
to north, the eye became fatigued by traversing a vast expanse of
level internal country, without the slightest rise of surface to
relieve the sameness of the scene, and bounded only by the
horizon.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This afternoon we crossed, to the eastward,
the meridian of Parramatta, in latitude reduced from the
observations at noon, 28 deg. 33 min., which placed us three
hundred and sixty-six statute miles due north from that
town.]</p>
<p>"June 1&mdash;3. Onward we pursued our course to the E.N.E.,
and throughout a space exceeding twenty miles penetrated for the
most part a barren and altogether an uninteresting country,
frequently of broken stony irregular surface, forming low ridges
clothed with a scrubby vegetation, which occasionally dropped
into slight concavities, scarcely to be denominated valleys,
equally sterile. But even in the midst of a line of country so
generally destitute of vegetable product sufficient to sustain
animal life, we were fortunate enough to meet with small isolated
spots on which to rest, providing us some little grass or
herbage, and water for our burdened horses. On the evening of the
2nd we halted on the margin of a stony gully, and, giving my
people and horses rest during the following day, I determined our
position on the chart as follows: lat. observed, 28 deg. 17 min.
49 sec. S.; long., by account, 151 deg. 22 min. E.; variation of
the compass, 7 deg. 36 min. E.</p>
<p>"The mean elevation of our encampment above the level of the
sea, one thousand four hundred and four feet.</p>
<p>"4th. During last week we penetrated in a north-eastern course
a country rising progressively in altitude, yet exceedingly bare
of esculent vegetation; nevertheless, situated as we were, we
could not possibly pursue a better line of route. I, therefore,
on the morning of the 4th continued our journey in that direction
by ascending a succession of rather heavily timbered forest
ridges, of easy acclivity, but rough and stony, to the feet of
our enfeebled horses.</p>
<p>"At our third mile, whilst in the act of passing over the brow
of one of these hills, the voices of natives were distinctly
heard. Almost immediately we perceived several of these Indians
in motion among the timber, not, however, before they had had,
for some moments, the first gaze of surprise at us, as the trunks
of the trees, being as black as their bodies, had prevented our
perceiving them as quickly.</p>
<p>"I happened to be accompanied by only one of my people, others
being with the pack horses at another part of the rising ground
beyond the natives, where the acclivity was more moderate. On my
calling to the pack horse leaders, the natives stood and viewed
us at the distance of about one hundred yards, occasionally
retiring behind the trees, and again walking about in great
uneasiness. The spot was ground on which they were bivouacing
with their women and children, whose respective voices we
distinctly heard; they therefore could not leave their tires with
that precipitation which their great alarm, induced by our
presence, would evidently have urged. The instant, however, my
people replied to my call from the gully whence they were
ascending to me, the agitation of the natives became extreme,
they therefore, having already hurried away the gins (women) and
little ones, ran off with the utmost despatch through the brushy
woods to the north of us. I could have wished to have brought
about a communication with these Indians had the whole of my
party been with me, or had we met each other on more open ground
than a close brushy forest, for I felt perfectly satisfied that
as soon as their fears had been removed by our pacific overtures
to them, they would have proved themselves of friendly
disposition, as they neither made me any reply, or appeared in
the least disposed to place themselves in menacing attitude, or
exhibited their weapons to deter us from approaching them. Under
the circumstances, however, of our meeting, I deemed it prudent
so soon as I perceived them to stand still until they had made
their little arrangements to depart. I would have advanced
quickly upon them, but the consequence might have been serious to
us, as we had no arms at the time, and these people might have
disputed the ground with us on the score of the women and
children, whom Nature teaches even the savage it is a duty in
man, as a husband and parent, to protect. Before my people had
joined me they had passed the fires of these Indians, which were
seven in number, and about them they recognised the bones of
bandicoots and the bustard (of which bird the feathers were
strewed around), upon the flesh of which these savages had been
feasting.</p>
<p>"Upon joining again, we continued our journey, and immediately
quitting the more open forest ground entered a dense brush of
acacia, dairesi&oelig;, &amp;c., the wand-like stems of which,
indurated by fire, proving a serious annoyance to us. By dint of
great bodily exertion to man and horse, we penetrated about four
miles through a body of thicket ten feet high, and upon making
the open forest ground on its eastern skirts we traced a narrow
valley, falling easterly, in search of water. We followed the
vale about a mile and a half, when meeting with water in a
stagnant state, I was obliged to halt, although on a spot
furnishing but little grass, it being after sunset, and my horses
were greatly distressed by the length and difficulty of the day's
stage.</p>
<p>"5th. The smokes which we had for the last two days observed
to rise from the country to the northward and eastward of us,
considered with the frequent screeching in that direction of the
white cockatoo (a bird loving to inhabit forest land in the
neighbourhood of rivers), fully satisfied me that we were on the
verge of a desirable country. At our usual hour of departure in
the morning we hastened from the spot on which we had passed the
previous night, pursuing our way in an E.N.E. direction.</p>
<p>"Beyond a patch of stony forest ground of rather open
character, we crossed (at our second mile) a rocky creek dipping
easterly, having some clear pools of water in its channel, and
grass on its margin. From the pitch of a ridge immediately above
this watercourse, we had a most agreeable though confined view of
an extensive range of open country, lying in the direction of our
course, which from its ample feature and prospect, I doubted not
would in its examination abundantly reward all our labours in
penetrating to it through a considerable tract of desert country,
stretching back to the southward of the parallel of 29 deg. A
hollow in the forest ridge immediately before us allowed me
distinctly to perceive that at a distance of eight or nine miles,
open plains or downs of great extent appeared to extend easterly
to the base of a lofty range of mountains, lying north and south,
distant by estimation about thirty miles. With the fullest
expectation of being able to reach the western margin of these
downs at an early period of the day, we proceeded forward with a
quickened pace, through an open grazing forest, to our eighth
mile, when our observed latitude proved to be 28 deg. 11 min. 10
sec. S. Already had the land become much thinner of timber, and
we had not advanced half a mile further, before we came upon a
patch of open plain, skirted by a low ridge of forest hills on
its western side, and by a closely wooded forest ground on the
opposite point.</p>
<p>"On climbing a low stony ridge in our way, it was really with
the greatest satisfaction that we perceived we had approached
within two miles of the Downs, and as small patches or strips of
mist extended throughout their whole length, and a line of swamp
oak stretched along their south-western extreme, it was clearly
shown us that these extensive tracts of timberless land were not
wanting in water. Upon accomplishing a journey of thirteen miles
(the last one extending over a commencement of the great plains)
we arrived at the left bank of a small river, about fifteen yards
in breadth, having a brisk current to the N.W. There was in all
parts of its channel, in the neighbourhood of the spot at which
we had made it, very deep water, which affording every
encouragement to my people to employ a period of the afternoon in
fishing, I sent them away along the left bank, furnishing each
with hooks and lines.</p>
<p>"In the meanwhile I obtained some sets of lunar distances with
the sun, the mean results of which gave me for the meridian of my
tent 151 deg. 39 min. 45 sec.; but as the accurately measured
distance between it and the north-easternmost encampment of this
journey (the situation of which was determined by several
observations aided by correct bearings, to certain fixed points
on the coast line) upon being reduced, placed the position of my
encampment 1¾ min. to the eastward, its situation may be stated
as follows: longitude 151 deg., 41 min. 30 sec. E.: latitude, by
observation at noon of 5th, 28 deg. 9 min. 37 sec. S.: its mean
elevation above the sea shore, by the barometer, being one
thousand four hundred and two feet.</p>
<p>"The anglers caught several fine cod, and whilst thus
successfully occupied on the bank of the river, three natives
were remarked in the adjoining forest ground on the opposite bank
firing the dried herbage of these woods; they did not, however,
venture to approach towards my people, but without manifesting
the least alarm, walked leisurely away to the more distant parts
of the forest."</p>
<p>"6th. Immediately after noon of the 6th we quitted our resting
place, and proceeding up the river about half a mile, crossed to
the opposite bank, at a ford previously discovered by one of my
party. From this stream, which I named Condamine's river in
compliment to the officer, who is Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency
the Governor, we entered upon the extensive downs before us,
pursuing our way to the E.N.E., along their southern margin.
During the afternoon of the 6th and following day, we travelled
throughout their whole extent, to the base of the mountainous
land that bounds them on their eastern extreme, and in the
progress of our journey made the following general observations
on their apparent extent, soil, and capability. These extensive
tracts of open country, which I subsequently named (by
permission) Darling Downs, in honour of His Excellency the
Governor, are situate in or about the mean parallel of 28 deg. 8
min. S., along which they extend east eighteen miles, to the
meridian of 152 deg. On their northern side they are bounded by a
very gentle rise of lightly wooded ridge, and on their opposite
margin, by a level forest of box and white gum of ordinary
timber. A chain of deep ponds, supported by streams from the
lofty ranges Immediately to the eastward, passes along the
central lower flats of these downs, throughout their whole
length, and uniting in seasons of heavy rains, falls westerly
into Condamine's river. Their breadth varies in different parts
of their lengthened surface, appearing at their western extremity
not to exceed one and a half miles, whilst towards their eastern
limits it was estimated at three miles. The lower parts, by a
deeply grooved water course, form flats, which In consequence of
their permanent moisture furnish a very considerable range of
cattle pasture, at all seasons of the year&mdash;the grasses and
herbage exhibiting generally in the depth of winter an
extraordinary luxuriance of growth. Among the mass of excellent
vegetation produced on these flats, no plant appeared more
striking In its growth than a species of rib-grass (<i>plantago
Struthionis</i>) which I had formerly described, the leaves of
which measured from twelve to fifteen inches in length.</p>
<p>"From these central grounds rise downs of a rich black and dry
soil, which extend several miles to the eastward, and, as they
furnish an abundance of grass, and are conveniently watered, yet
perfectly beyond the reach of those irrigations which take place
on the flats in wet seasons, they constitute a most valuable
sound sheep pasture, the permanently dry nature of which may be
inferred from the fact of there being a difference of three
hundred feet between their upper or eastern limit and Condamine's
river, as shown by the mean results of barometrical
admeasurement.</p>
<p>"Towards the close of the afternoon of the 7th, having gained
the forest ground on the eastern verge of the downs, we continued
our course to the northward and eastward about one and a-half
miles, through a truly beautiful apple-tree forest, abounding in
kangaroos, when, upon reaching the base of a remarkable
flat-topped mount, forming the termination of a portion of the
lateral range to which I had taken a bearing when twenty-five
miles to the S.W., I encamped on the bank of a narrow creek,
furnishing plenty of water, and upon a patch of the finest meadow
pasturage I have seen in New South Wales.</p>
<p>"Here I gave my wearied horses two days' rest, some having
been reduced to a state of extreme debility, and all having
suffered considerably in condition by the severity of the journey
from Liverpool Plains.</p>
<p>"Whilst, therefore, they were recovering a degree of strength,
by rest and good sound pasture, I was busily engaged examining
the dark brushes which clothed the adjacent mountain from its
base to its very summit, the vegetation of which appeared
altogether tropical.</p>
<p>"The morning of the 8th proving exceedingly fine, I set out
from the encampment, accompanied by one of my party, to ascend
the table mount above our tents, from the elevated summit of
which I had promised myself an extensive prospect around. After
pushing our way through a mass of dense thicket investing the
foot and flank of this eminence, we gained an open spot on its
flat summit in about two hours, and were gratified exceedingly by
the extensive view afforded us of the country from north by the
way of west, and thence to S. and S.S.E. to the more remarkable
points of which bearings were taken.</p>
<p>"At N.N.W., and especially at N., the country presented a
broken and irregular surface, forming a series of heavily
timbered ridges, extending laterally from the more elevated chain
of mountains immediately to the eastward, and which, stretching
in the direction of the meridian, appeared to constitute the main
or dividing range of this part of the interior.</p>
<p>"From the N.W. to west, and thence to south, the eye surveyed
a vast expanse of open country, tame and uninteresting in the
distance, but exhibiting within a range of twenty miles every
feature of hill and dale, woodland and plain, to diversify the
ample outstretched landscape.</p>
<p>"Large cleared patches of land lying to the north of Darling
Downs were named Peel's Plains, whilst others, bearing to the S.
and S.E. of my ample undulated surface, were entitled Canning
Downs, in honour of the late Right Hon. George Canning. The
extent of these downs easterly we were unable from the point on
which we stood to observe, but on the south they were bounded by
a lofty ridge of hills, lying nearly east and west, which was
named Harris Range.</p>
<p>"Directing the view to the N.W. beyond Peel's Plains an
immeasurable expanse of flat country met the eye, on which not
the slightest eminence could be observed to interrupt the common
level, which, in consequence of the very clear state of the
atmosphere, could be discerned to a very distant blue line of
horizon, verging on the parallel of 27 deg. and meridian of 151
deg.</p>
<p>"Extremely gratifying as it was to take a bird's eye survey of
so extensive a range of pastoral country as appeared beneath us
(the discovery of which had recompensed us for the privations we
had met with in our journey, extending by admeasurement three
hundred and forty statute miles from Hunter's river), still the
question arose in my mind from what point so fine a country could
be approached, seeing that at E. and N.E., in the direction of
Moreton Bay, a very lofty range of mountains immediately bounding
us constituted a barrier very difficult to be passed.</p>
<p>"As all observation easterly towards the coast-line was thus
prevented, we descended to the tents, heavy weather having come
on from the north.</p>
<p>"This flat-topped eminence, which I observed formed the
north-western angle of a body of lateral hills, extending from
the leading range of these mountains, was named Mount Dumaresq,
and along its northern side a grassy valley, stretching from the
Great Downs north-easterly to the immediate foot of the main
range, received the appellation of Millar's Valley.</p>
<p>"Rain having set in, it continued almost without intermission
for forty-eight hours, until the morning of the 10th inst., when
fair weather was again restored to us, and we quitted our
encamping ground with the intention of penetrating towards the
higher points of these mountains, from the summits of which I
expected to obtain bearings to fixed points on the coast, so
extremely important to me at this stage of my journey. Pursuing a
course to the south at the base of a thickly-wooded ridge,
stretching from Mount Dumaresq, about four miles to a second hill
of tabular figure, we passed round its foot, and altering our
course to north-east entered a very beautiful grassy vale,
bounded by lofty lateral ridges, and like Millar's Valley,
leading directly to the base of the principal range.</p>
<p>"Advancing about five miles up this vale, which I named after
Captain Logan, the present Indefatigable commandant of the penal
settlement at Moreton Bay, I again halted on a small brook
meandering through to the south&mdash;a remarkable double-headed
mount of the main range, bearing N.E. by E. about ten miles.
Dense brushy forests, clothing the bases of the lateral ridges
immediately overlooking our encampment, were productive of a
number of curious plants not before known; and it was in these
shades I first clearly and satisfactorily recognized the pine
(<i>araucaria</i>) which I had formerly observed in greater
numbers in the dark brushes of the Brisbane River.</p>
<p>"As the ridges in the neighbourhood appeared likely from their
considerable elevation to afford me a commanding view of the
country at all points of the compass, I determined to occupy two
or three days in this vale, taking such observations as were
necessary to enable me to determine my present position on the
chart, whilst my horses were acquiring a degree of strength to
meet the further labours of my journey.</p>
<p>"11th. A sharp frost; the thermometer at seven o'clock sank to
30 degrees. Having directed the occupations of the people during
the day, I proceeded (accompanied by one of my party) to climb
the steep ridge immediately above us. In an hour we gained its
summit, but found other ranges not to be seen from our tents,
although of greater elevation, interrupted our view to the
eastward; we continued upon a gradual ascent from one tier of
ranges to another and generally in a north-eastern direction,
until about 3 p.m., when we gained the loftiest point of the
lateral range, immediately connected with the main ridge of this
stupendous chain of mountains, which even towered above us at a
distance of about two miles.</p>
<p>"Some hollow parts, however, of this extreme ridge enabled me
to overlook portions of the country in the vicinity of Moreton
Bay, as also most distinctly to perceive distant lands situate at
the base of the Mount Warning Ranges, the cone of which we
clearly saw crowning that group of mountains at an estimated
distance of seventy-six miles. To this lofty pinnacle, as also to
another fixed point near the coast-line, accurate bearings were
taken, ere some fresh breezes brought up clouds and heavy rain
from the southward, which soon veiled those extensive regions
from further observation.</p>
<p>"The cone of Mount Warning bore east 9 degrees south seventy
miles by estimation; High Peak, of Flinders' chart, north 50
degrees east, about twenty-five miles. The spot on which the
tents stood in Logan Vale, bearing west 44 degrees south about
five miles.</p>
<p>"Had the weather continued favourable it would have been
important to have examined the main range, with the view of
ascertaining how far a passage could be effected over it to the
Brisbane river country, from which point only the very
interesting pastoral country lying on the western side of these
mountains appears at all accessible. A very singular deeply
excavated part of the range, bearing from my station on the
lateral ridge N.N.E. was, however, remarked, to the pitch of
which the acclivity from the head of Millar's Valley seemed very
moderate, and as this gap appeared likely to prove on examination
a very practicable pass through these formidable mountains, I
determined to employ a day in exploring it.</p>
<p>"These mountains, to the western base of which we approached
from a sterile southern region, form the dividing range in this
part of the country, and give rise to waters falling as well on
the coast, as westerly to the distant interior; and as the
barometrical observations made on the lateral range gave a result
of three thousand seven hundred and thirty-five feet, and the
extreme ridge appeared at least three hundred feet higher, its
elevation above the level of the sea may be considered about four
thousand one hundred feet.</p>
<p>"The forest ridges, which were heavily timbered with stringy
bark of great bulk, were found clothed to their summits with
grasses of the most luxuriant growth, and being well watered by
numerous trickling rills, originating between the shoulders of
the hills, constitute a very spacious range of the richest cattle
pasture.</p>
<p>"Upon examining the hollow back of the mountain ridge, it was
found to be very rugged and difficult, large masses of rock
having fallen down from the lands on each side into the gap,
which was overgrown with strong twining plants. Immediately to
the south, however, the range presented a very moderate surface,
over which a line of road might be constructed without much
labour, as the rise from Millar's Valley proved by no means
abrupt, and the fall easterly from the range to the forest ground
at its base appeared of singularly easy declivity. Looking
north-easterly the eye wandered with pleasure over a fine open
grazing country, very moderately timbered, with patches of clear
plain, and detached wooded ridges to diversify the surface; and
in no part did there appear the slightest obstacle to prevent a
communication either with the southern shores of Moreton Bay or
the banks of the Brisbane river.</p>
<p>"In taking a general view of the very superior country at
which the labours of my party terminated northerly, it was
gratifying to observe the range of luxuriant pasturage,* this
subject of our discovery, in its plains, rising downs, open
woodlands, valleys, and even elevated forest ranges has thrown
open to our most extensive flocks and herds, in a genial climate
and at an elevation of one thousand eight hundred feet above the
sea shore.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The vapours that rise from the surface of the
sea upon being blown over by easterly winds to the higher points
of these mountains, becoming condensed and falling in light
refreshing showers, on the adjacent lower country, would seem to
account for the bright verdure of the grasses and generally
vigorous growth of vegetation in the depth of winter.]</p>
<p>"Its timbers, moreover, add to its importance. The summit and
flanks of the ranges produce great abundance of well-grown
stringy-bark, whilst the lower ridges furnish stately pine of the
species already well-known on the Brisbane, varying from sixty to
eighty feet in height, and as small saplings of the red cedar
were observed on the margin of the brushes investing the base of
the hills large trees of this valuable wood are doubtless to be
met with in their more distant recesses. Although neither coal
nor limestone were found in this tract of country, a quarry of
freestone, seemingly well adapted to building, could be easily
opened on the bank of a creek about two miles south of the Logan
Vale. In fine, upon the consideration that we are occupying a
country in which (in the absence of navigable rivers) an
expensive land carriage must ever be resorted to in the
conveyance of produce of the inland to the coast, the value of
this extensive range of pastoral country is not a little enhanced
by its proximity to the sea shore, and the seeming facility with
which (we may reasonably conclude from the moderate appearance of
the interjacent country to the eastward of these mountains) the
fleeces of its growth, as well as the general produce of its
soil, will at some future time be borne down to the shores of
Moreton Bay. The base of these mountains is a compact whinstone;
on the higher ridges was observed amygdaloid of the trap
formation, with nodules of quartz; whilst the summit exhibited a
porphyritic rock, very porous, containing numerous minute
quartzose crystallizations.</p>
<p>"The situation of the tents in Logan Vale was determined as
follows:&mdash;latitude, by meridional altitude of the sun, 28
deg. 10 min. 45 sec. S.; longitude, deduced by the mean of
several sets of lunar distances with the sun and fixed star
(Antares) compared with that given by account, and corrected by
bearings taken to fixed points on or near the coast line, 152
deg. 7 min. 45 sec. E. The variation of the magnetic needle was
found to be 8 deg. 18 min. east; the mean elevation of the spot
above the level of the sea, as derived from barometrical
measurement, was one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven
feet, and its distance from the penal settlement on the Brisbane
river was estimated at seventy-five statute miles to the
south-west.</p>
<p>"Although very recent traces of natives were remarked in
different parts of the vale, in which we remained encamped about
a week, only a solitary aborigine (a man of ordinary stature) was
seen, who in wandering forth from his retreat in quest of food
chanced to pass the tents.</p>
<p>"Immediately, however, upon an attempt of one of my people to
approach him, he retired in great alarm to the adjacent brushes,
at the foot of the boundary hills, and instantly disappeared. It
therefore seemed probable that he had not previously seen white
men, and possibly might never have had any communication with the
natives inhabiting the country on the eastern side of the
Dividing Range, from whom he could have acquired such information
of the existence of a body of white strangers on the banks of the
Brisbane, and their friendly disposition towards his countrymen
as might have induced him to have met with confidence our
overtures to effect an amicable communication. In the progress of
our journey northerly, it was remarked that the plants of those
portions of the interior lying between the parallels of 32 deg.
and 28 deg. differ but little from the characteristic vegetation
of the temperate parts of this country generally&mdash;the many
unpublished species which were discovered in the course of the
journey, belonging for the most part to genera, characterising
the flora of the colony and country immediately adjacent. Upon
reaching the parallel of 28 deg. S., however, under the meridian
of 152 deg., a very decided change takes place in the vegetable
productions; the brushes which densely invest the base and sides
of the lateral ranges, being on examination found to be of plants
hitherto only observed at Moreton Bay, and in the intertropical
parts of this continent.</p>
<p>"As I had now occupied several days in a partial examination
of the very interesting country around me, I became exceedingly
desirous to resume my journey. As my horses, notwithstanding the
benefit they had derived from rest and good pasture during our
stay in Logan Vale, were all much debilitated, and my stock of
provisions considerably reduced, I felt reluctantly compelled to
relinquish the tour I had originally contemplated towards the
western marshes, especially as the appearances of the weather at
the change of the moon had led me to apprehend a period of heavy
rain was about to succeed the protracted season of drought. I
therefore determined to prosecute my journey homeward in the
meridian (152 deg.) to which I had penetrated, with as much
dispatch as the nature of the country and the low condition of my
horses would permit. Moreover, on resolving on this line of
course, I considered I should ascertain what the country is lying
equi-distant between the coast line and my outward tract from
Hunter's river, and upon my daily observations, geographical and
otherwise, should on my return to the colony be more fully
enabled to embody the chart of that part of our interior
comprehended within the parallels of 28 deg. and 31 deg.</p>
<p>"Accordingly upon quitting Logan Vale, on the morning of the
16th, we commenced our journey to the southward through a fine
open forest country, abounding in excellent pasture and tolerable
timber, and watered by a reedy creek falling westerly, evidently
into Condamine's river. In about nine miles we reached the
north-eastern skirts of Canning Downs, which, in pursuing our
course to the south, we crossed at a part where their breadth to
the opposite margin did not exceed two miles. These downs,
however, the extent of which could not be estimated, as only a
limited portion of them could be seen whilst traversing their
undulated surface, stretched several miles to the westward of our
line of route, and throughout this length are watered by a deep
channeled brook, originating in the dividing range to the
eastward, which ultimately forms one of the branches of
Condamine's river. Towards the close of the day, having continued
my journey to the south, through a heavily timbered forest of
box, gum and casuarina (oak), but slightly elevated above the
mean level of the downs, which were found by barometrical
measurement to be fifteen hundred feet above the sea shore, I was
induced to rest my horses at a chain of small ponds, furnishing
some tolerable grass on their edge, having made a stage of
fifteen miles from Logan Vale. The observations made on the
following day (Sunday) at the encampment, placed us on the chart
in latitude 28 deg. 21 min. 17 sec. S., longitude 152 deg. 0.2
min. E., an azimuth giving us 6 deg. 8 min. easterly
variation.</p>
<p>"Early on the morning of the 18th we again set out on our
journey to the southward, and immediately on quitting the dry
forest ground, came upon a marshy plain, which appeared to extend
several miles to the S.E., having a deep swamp oak creek winding
through its centre from the towering ranges immediately on our
left. Passing this creek with some difficulty we pursued our
course to the S.S.E., through an undulated rising forest of iron
bark and red gum, in many parts of which we remarked the traces
of natives, of, however, no recent date. Penetrating about six
miles through a singularly uninteresting tract of wooded land,
productive of diminutive timber, we at length perceived before us
a broken and mountainous country, and around us a change of
geological structure to a formation not previously met with in
any stage of our journey. The rock was a very hard granite, with
the quartz, which was remarked greatly to preponderate, unusually
large.</p>
<p>"Finding abundance of water in a stony gully, the tents were
set up in a sandy spot shown by the barometer to be elevated
about three hundred and fifty feet above Canning Downs. During
the 19th and 20th June we prosecuted our journey among a group of
primitive mountains, which appeared to expand before us into
lofty precipitous ranges, extending far to the southward.
Immediately on quitting our encamping ground on the morning of
the 19th, we descended between large isolated blocks of granite,
to the channel of a small rivulet flowing over a pavement of the
same formation with a rapidity that clearly demonstrated a very
considerable dip of its bed towards a deep ravine, the bendings
of which we could distinctly trace southerly among the mountains.
Crossing this stream, our course led us again to its bend, among
the undulations of the rocky surface of the valley through which
it urged its rapid course, and having a second time forded it
with great difficulty to the horses, I directed my course to the
hills immediately bounding the vale to the eastward. Again we
were interrupted in our progress by a narrow but deep creek of
turbid water, flowing from that point to the brook. Finding it
was impossible to cross its channel, we were obliged to seek a
practicable ford in the rocky bed of the brook, which, a third
time passing, we climbed the lofty forest hills on the western
side, and having gained their extreme ridge, we found the
travelling through a forest of large stringy bark remarkably
easy. My horses had, however, laboured hard among the hills in
the earlier periods of the day: I was, therefore, glad to rest
them about four o'clock, at a rill of water we had discovered
falling over some granite rocks into the glen beneath.</p>
<p>"On the following morning intending to pursue our course to
the southward throughout the day as far as the acclivity of the
hills among which we had penetrated would allow the horses to
travel, we resumed our journey. After traversing a succession of
forest ridges, of comparatively easy acclivity, about seven
miles, a bold mountainous country appeared before us, extending
from S.E. by the way of S. to W.S.W. At noon, when our latitude
by observation was 28 deg. 35 min. 30 sec. S., we had gained a
commanding point on a range exceeding two thousand five hundred
feet above the sea shore, whence a clear and extensive view of a
curiously irregularly featured country to the eastward was
afforded me.</p>
<p>"In that direction bearings were taken to some very remarkable
detached cupola shaped mountains, distant from fifteen to twenty
miles, and beyond these singular eminences a moderately undulated
tract of open country was perceived extending apparently to the
western foot of the Mount Warning Ranges, the faint blue outline
of which could be distinctly traced, although its very elevated
cone (which was probably enveloped in clouds) was not
discernible. Continuing on the back of the range in a
south-westerly direction another mile, I was obliged to close the
labours of the day at an early hour, as the horses, having been
pushed beyond their strength, were sinking beneath their burdens,
amidst the difficulties of a brushy underwood, with which parts
of these elevated ridges were found most denselv clothed. At the
close of the day, the mercurial column had sunk lower at this
encampment than had been observed at any other station of the
journey, since we passed the dividing range at Hunter's river.
The data it furnished on being computed gave a mean elevation of
two thousand five hundred and ninety-two feet above the sea
shore, which at Cape Byron bore as deduced by the observed
latitude at noon E. 5 deg. N. true, ninety-three statute miles.
At this elevated encampment on the range we were confined to our
tents by continued rains, during the three following days, and
although our detention on the summit of a ridge of mountains,
surrounded by difficulties, was exceedingly unpleasant to us, it
was nevertheless a relief to me to observe our horses had
acquired great freshness and activity by the rest our stay had
afforded them, and the excellent grazing these elevated regions
furnished. The wind having veered round from the eastward to the
W.N.W., on the evening of the 23rd the weather broke, and a clear
sky succeeded; at night, however, clouds again rose from
eastward, and rain fell in heavy showers, continuing until about
midnight, when the wind again shifting to the westward and
blowing almost a gale, the water-charged clouds, which were
suspended over the mountains, were drawn back to the coast, and
established fine, and settled weather followed. We therefore, on
the morning of the 24th, most gladly broke up our encampment,
proceeding in the first instance about half a mile to the E.S.E.,
in order to cross a brook in the neighbourhood. This stream we
found exceedingly swollen and rapid, by the waters that it had
collected from the higher grounds during the late rains; we,
however, forded it without difficulty, and leaving it to tumble
its accumulated waters over large blocks of granite into the
bosom of a neighbouring glen, we proceeded our journey southerly,
over a succession of lofty ranges heavily timbered with gums,
beneath the shade of which fern and underwood were interspersed,
rendering the travelling exceedingly harrassing to my horses.
Upon gaining a greater elevation, we passed from these shaded
forests to open scrubs, and spongy swamps overflowed by late
rains, which, in aspect, were very similar to those of our Blue
Mountain ranges, and the plants, although the rock was granite,
were for the most part of alike description. At noon of the 25th,
I found the latitude of a bleak barren spot upon these mountains,
two thousand nine hundred and nine feet above the level of the
ocean, to be 26 deg. 44 min. 48 sec. S.; its longitude, reduced
from the meridian of Logan Vale, being about 151 deg. 58 min. 45
sec. E. From this point we continued our journey about five
miles, nearly on the same level, and over equally barren ground,
when, upon descending slightly in a swampy valley, the tents were
again set up; our barometer at sunset showing us that we were on
a level but a few feet lower than our station at noon.</p>
<p>"26th. At an early hour we proceeded to leave this marshy
valley, southerly, with some expectation of its leading to a more
open and moderately-surfaced country in that direction. We had,
however, scarcely advanced five miles ere a most wild
chaotic-featured region effectually stopped our progress to the
southward. Large detached masses of granite, of almost every
shape and figure,* studded the foreground of the romantic scene
that suddenly burst on the view at the head of this vale, and
beyond, a deep ravine formed a crescent, from E. to S.E., which,
it was perceived, was itself backed by a rugged range, the rocky
point of which appeared at least two hundred and fifty feet in
height above the level of the valley.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It appeared at first difficult to understand
how those detached blocks of granite were originally formed, of
which some presented immense spheroidal figures; others, those of
water-worn boulders, whilst here and there stood one (nine-pin
shaped) so nicely poised on its small base, that the traveller
might be induced to suppose that it would have required but his
individual effort to have upset its equilibrium. It may be
conceived that these rounded masses, and the rock on which they
rest, were at one period united in one body; that by the
incessant operation of the elements upon this body during ages,
it had become cracked through, and its scattered fragments had
formed various figures. Of these, some may have become disunited
in a solid angular form from the mountain masses, and in time
might have their angles cut off by atmospheric attrition, and
thus it probably is, that to the constant action of the elements,
the various curious appearances of rocks in the valleys of
mountainous countries are to be attributed.]</p>
<p>"Upon ascending a stony head, which commanded a considerable
view around us, I remarked that this rocky broken country
extended from E. to S. and thence by W. to N.N.W., but that at N.
there appeared an apparent opening, by which it was probable we
should be enabled, without much distress to our horses, to
extricate ourselves from the labyrinth of difficult precipitous
country around us. A stream of fine water, originating in a
neighbouring rocky ridge, and running through a valley tending
towards this apparent break of the ranges, led me to follow it,
and in about eight miles, having passed round the northern
extremity of a lofty ridge, we shaped a course to the westward,
southerly, through a brushy, barren forest, producing small
timber of stringy bark, honeysuckle, and cypress, and exhibiting
in various parts numerous and very recent traces of natives.
Towards the close of the afternoon of the 27th, having continued
our course to the W.S.W., we descended to an open level valley,
bounded on the west by forest hills, very thickly timbered, and
apparently grassy to their summits. In this confined valley we
met with a small rivulet, rising evidently in the elevated rugged
country we had left, and winding its course to the N.W. This
stream, we immediately perceived, could be none other than
Macintyre's B rook, which was discovered in the progress of my
journey northerly, in a sterile country, at so low a level as
eight hundred feet.</p>
<p>"The very considerable declination of the country lying
between this valley and that barren region (distant to the
westward only sixty miles) was shown by our barometer, which, at
the spot at which we again encamped, gave its mean height above
the ocean two thousand two hundred and fifty-four feet.</p>
<p>"28th. On the southern and western sides of the valley ranges
of forest hills rose to an elevation of three hundred feet, but
as they were very thinly wooded, and appeared generally grassy, I
apprehended no difficulty in passing them in our route to the
south.</p>
<p>"Fording Macintyre's Brook, therefore, we succeeded without
difficulty in accomplishing about seven miles along a
continuation of the valley, when we reached the base of the
forest ridge bounding it at S.W., which ascending, we found
exceedingly rugged and stony.</p>
<p>"During other five miles of the day's journey we were occupied
in climbing from one range of hills to another, when on
descending to a narrow valley providing both grass and water, I
halted at an early hour of the day, several of the heavier laden
horses whose feet had suffered much from the rugged nature of the
ground, requiring to be reshod.</p>
<p>"Our latitude at noon (28 deg. 55 min.) showed us we were
progressively making our way to the southward, and our barometer
gave us three hundred and thirty feet of elevation above our
morning's encampment on Macintyre's Brook.</p>
<p>"About an hour before sunrise on the morning of the 29th the
chill of the atmosphere was felt much more intense than we had
previously experienced at any period of our journey. The
thermometer had sunk to 25 degrees of Fahrenheit, and ice to the
thickness of a quarter of an inch crusted the surface of stagnant
pools in the neighbouring water course.</p>
<p>"Encouraged more by the hope of passing to the southward of
the parallel 29 deg. at an early hour of the day, than by the
appearance of the country before us, we quitted our encamping
ground at sunrise, pursuing our journey to the south about five
miles to some low wooded ridges of barren stony character. From
the summit we beheld a very broken hummocky and in part
mountainous country immediately investing us at S.E., and south,
whilst at S.S.W. and West a succession of rather lofty forest
ridges met the eye. Another mile over a very broken surface
brought us to the edge of a deep glen at least one hundred yards
wide, with perpendicular rocky wall-like sides&mdash;which
extending from the eastward to the west as far as could be
perceived, from the spot at which it was intersected, appeared to
cut off communication with the country south of it.</p>
<p>"Skirting this formidable ravine to the N.W. about a mile, a
moderate declivity was fortunately discovered, by which the pack
horses were conducted safely to the bottom of the glen, when we
found a river, about forty yards in breadth, pursuing its course
to the westward, over a very rocky bed. Our latitude derived from
observation taken at noon on the upper edge of the ravine, was 28
deg. 59 min. 56 sec. S., which is nearly the parallel of our
encampment on the 27th May; and upon setting up the barometer, on
the margin of the Glen river, the bottom of this ravine was found
to be one thousand and ninety-four feet lower than the site of
our last encampment in the valley.* The passages over the river
having been effected with some difficulty and with some danger to
the horses, in consequence of the extremely rocky and irregular
character of its bed, we climbed by an easy acclivity the hills
on the southern side of the glen on the morning of the 30th, and
then resumed our course to the S.W., over a succession of
elevated ridges and barren valleys, timbered chiefly with small
iron-bark.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The mean height of this valley above the
seashore by the barometer to be two thousand five hundred and
eighty-seven feet; the mean elevation of the bed of the glen
proved to be one thousand four hundred and three feet.]</p>
<p>"At our sixth mile we descended from the hills to a valley of
considerable extent, which was found watered by a fine river,
exceeding fifty yards in breadth, abounding in water fowl and
running sluggishly to the westward. Crossing this stream at a
pebbly fall, to its left bank, I again called a halt; and, as the
grazing around us, and particularly on the margin of the river,
was excellent, I determined to afford my horses, all of whom
exhibited debility in a greater or less degree, an entire day's
rest.</p>
<p>"This stream, which rises in the granite mountains, situate to
the N.E., at an elevation bordering on three thousand feet, we
immediately identified (from its magnitude and tendency) with
Dumaresq's river, which we discovered in our outward journey
upwards of fifty miles to the westward, where the mean elevation
of the interior watered by it was ascertained in May last to be
eight hundred and forty feet above the seashore.</p>
<p>"The observations made at this encampment on Dumaresq's river
fixed its situation on the chart as follows: latitude, 29 deg. 1
min. 14 sec. S.; longitude, 151 deg. 31 min. 30 sec. The
variation of the magnetic needle was 8 deg. 26 min. E., and the
mean height above the level of the sea one thousand and forty
feet.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** The results of barometrical measurement gave
two hundred feet as the difference of level of the two points at
which the channel of Dumaresq's river was intersected in this
journey; the gradual fall of the interjacent country is therefore
clearly shown.]</p>
<p>"As the hills bounding the valley on its southern side were by
far too lofty and broken to permit me (in the state of debility
to which my horses were reduced) to pursue a direct course
homeward, I determined upon tracing the vale westerly a limited
distance, being encouraged to hope from the aspect of the country
in that direction (as observed from a hill immediately above our
tents) that in a few miles the ridge would be found sufficiently
moderate to allow me to pursue my journey to the southward
without interruption.</p>
<p>"With these views we resumed our labours on the morning of the
2nd July along the left bank of the river, which, in its course
to the N.W., through the vale, waters some fine flats, timbered
with robust apple trees, and furnishing a considerable patch of
fine cattle pasture. In about three miles a stream, flowing from
the north through a break in the mountainous lands at that
bearing, falls into the river, which at length, bending to the
S.W., assumes in its increased breadth more regular depth and
frequent length of its reaches, a character fully entitling it to
be considered equal in magnitude to any of the rivers hitherto
discovered interiorly. The valley continues in a south-westerly
direction about seventeen miles, and thereabouts fine grassy
flats extend along the banks of the river, on which were remarked
blue gums of very large dimensions. The banks themselves are in
some parts quite perpendicular, from ten to fifteen feet in
height, and of a red-coloured clay; and where this character
occurred the breadth of the river (we remarked) exceeded one
hundred yards, was evidently of considerable depth, and teeming
with fish of the western waters, particularly that species
denominated 'cod', of which several were caught weighing from ten
to fifteen pounds. Several emus were observed on the lower flats
of the river, but our dogs, who had run many hundred miles in the
course of this journey, in pursuit of a daily fresh meal for us,
were too much reduced in strength to maintain a long, chase;
they, nevertheless, killed one of those gigantic birds, an old
male of great bulk, having the feathers of the back nearly
black.</p>
<p>"At length, observing the valley to take a decided bend to the
north-west I left it and the river altogether, with the intention
of directing my course to the south-west; however, upon passing
some low forest ridges in that direction, to a patch of plain
(the latitude of which I ascertained to be 29 deg. 12 min. S.), a
lofty, broken, and exceedingly rocky country again appeared,
extending from S.E. to S.W. We were therefore obliged to direct
our steps once more to the north-west, and after traversing a
succession of barren wooded ranges about five miles, we descended
upon a thinly timbered forest country, through which we continued
our journey without difficulty to the southward.</p>
<p>"In no part of this lengthened journey were the proofs of the
long drought, that had prevailed in the interior, more manifest
than in these lonely woods, the soil of which was remarked to be,
for the most part, a cold, hungry clay, seemingly incapable of
producing good grass or esculent herbage at any season. In many
parts of an extent of country, exceeding fourteen miles, the
ground (on which were interspersed small patches of brushwood,
scarcely in a state of existence) was rent by the sun into wide
chasms, and the several pebbly channels that were intersected in
the progress of the expedition, and which doubtless in ordinary
seasons contain water, had evidently been dried up many
months.</p>
<p>"Onward, however, to the southward and westward, we crossed,
on the afternoon of the 5th, a stream about fifteen yards in
breadth, having a current to the westward, to which in passing I
gave the name of Anderson's Brook, in compliment to my very
respectable friend, of the medical staff of the colony. Beyond
this stream a singular sameness of character prevails throughout
the forest ground for about three miles, when the timbers
progressively became larger and of more regular growth.</p>
<p>"At noon of this day (5th) our latitude was 29 deg. 24 min.
0.9 sec. S., and at its close, having effected a long and tedious
stage, we rested ourselves on a well-watered patch of tolerable
grass. Our barometer showed us that we had travelled during the
whole of the day on nearly a plain surface, the difference of
level in about fourteen miles being found to be only seventy-five
feet.</p>
<p>"Pursuing our way to the westward, southerly, on the morning
of the 6th, through an open space about three miles, we reached
the right bank of a deep river, in breadth about thirty yards,
and tending to the N.W.</p>
<p>"This river, which originates in the mountainous country at
N.N.E. and bore evident signs of being a channel by which vast
bodies of water are carried off to the interior, exhibited at
this season little other than a chain of large canal-like ponds,
separated from each other by shallows of the gravel of which its
upper banks were formed. Upon these it was remarked large bodies
of drift-wood had been deposited by those considerable floods
which, it was evident, rise in seasons of prolonged rains to the
perpendicular height of thirty feet above the low level at which
we noticed it. This water, which was named Burrell river, is
doubtless augmented by Anderson's Brook a few miles further to
the westward, and eventually it falls into Peel's river.
South-easterly from Burrell's river, the travelling continued
excellent for about twelve miles, the country being a gently
rising open forest, productive of timbers of a large dimension,
In passing the eastern extremity of a cypress ridge granite was
again observed, in large blocks, and towards the termination of
our day's stage masses of granulated quartz were strewed in
various parts of the forest ground. From a spot somewhere to the
southward of Burrell river (situate on the chart in lat. 29 deg.
27 min. 15 sec. S., and long. 151 deg. 0.2 min. E.) I had an
extensive view of the line of country lying east towards Shoal
Bay.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The entrance of Shoal Bay, which lies
equidistant from the settlements of Port Macquarie and Moreton
Bay, is placed by navigation in latitude 29 deg. 26 min. 30 sec.
S., and longitude 155 deg. 21 min. 15 sec. E. The distance,
therefore, of Burrell river directly west from its shore is
estimated about one hundred and thirty-five statute miles.]</p>
<p>"Of the capabilities of this indentation of our coast line,
which was discovered and partly examined by Captain Flinders in
1799, but little is known, as it appears not to be visited by
vessels, because probably its title may have induced those
passing to entertain an unfavorable opinion of it. If, however,
the country environing its shores should be discovered upon
further examination to be well watered and sufficiently capable
of improvement by cultivation to induce the Government at any
future period to colonise it, it will be interesting to know that
upon passing any hills that may be in the neighbourhood of the
coast, there exist in all probability no obstacles to prevent a
ready and direct communication with the western interior, since
upon taking a survey of the country at east, from the rising
ground in the vicinity of Burrell river, which its elevation of
sixteen hundred feet above the sea shore enabled me to do to a
distance little short of seventy miles, the land, although fully
timbered, appeared open, of a gently undulated surface, and
seemingly of a very gradual fall towards the coast."</p>
<p>Latitude, south 29 deg. 27 min. 15 sec!! Standing here
Cunningham could cast a glad glance back upon his achievement. He
was wont, his own quiet words show, to weigh the Future in scales
with the Past and Present. His own planting had borne early
fruit: what might not the coming hour? He did not know that by
patient hand of duty to his country, king, and ruling passion, he
had lifted a small corner of a veil which was draping the
imperishable effigy of a name and fame to which the sovereign
people of his own race would one day testify in unexampled
loyalty bred of love.</p>
<p>But he was now retreating from the borders within which he had
just stirred the slumbering Lady of the Manor of Darling Downs.
No need to carry him back in triumph over homeward bound space
again! The laurel of his hopes, which he had yet to win and wear,
dangled before his eyes all the way to expectant Sydney. The
crown of his efforts was not yet grasped however. Away again to
the northern fastnesses! With his back to the sun setting over
thousands of miles of western solitudes, he had had one glance
through the prison-bars of that defiant range, in eagerness
towards the only dwelling of his own countrymen&mdash;Moreton
Bay; gazing from the rugged rampart to where,</p>
<p class="poem">"The long mountains ended in a coast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ever shifting sand, and
far away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom circle of a
moaning sea,"</p>
<p>but not hopeless of shaping a key for opening the grim portals
through which&mdash;strange to say!&mdash;freedom should in her
appointed course go forth to beat down those within which
chain-ganged guilt and wailing worthlessness were wearily
writhing their way out of woe, the depths beneath had baffled the
skill of his sight. He must now woo the eastern beams to light up
the ladder of escape from that mountain citadel; he must scale
the ramparts from which he dared not leap before winning the
mural garland.</p>
<p>The gladness of Cunningham's life was the pursuit of mysteries
yet hidden by the coy hand of nature. He could never feel
solitude in the bush. The silent majesty of the language which
claimed his homage round him, above him, beneath him must have
been to his skilled and practised sense an unceasing harmony of
appeal. Not even within the secret Bathurst cave, to which we
have known him retreat to consult with his Egeria, were their
voices not heard&mdash;and what has been his reply?</p>
<p class="poem">"I live not in myself, but I become<br>
Portion of that around me; and to me<br>
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum<br>
Of human cities. Torture."</p>

<p><span class="a">From</span> the end of the month of July,
1828, Cunningham, Captain Logan, commandant at the penal
settlement, and Fraser, the Colonial Botanist, were busy in their
examination of the country south of Brisbane, the valley of the
Logan, and as far as the Mount Warning ranges; ascended Mount
Lindesay, and after a fruitless attempt to break through the
ragged and brushy country westerly, towards the gap in the
dividing range, which Cunningham had approached from the west
last year, returned to Limestone "Station" on the 12th of August.
His friends having retired to head-quarters, Cunningham resumed
his labour, directed towards the purpose on which he was bent. To
a Queenslander's eye his journal, therefore, resumes its special
position of interest. He now links together the two ends of the
chain which he had drawn towards each other from the south, by
sea and land.</p>
<p align="center">"<span class="a">Copy Transmitted with
Lieutenant-general Darling's Despatch, No. 25, Dated 24th
February, 1829.</span></p>
<div style="margin-right:5%; text-align:right;">"Parramatta, 16th
December, 1828.</div>
<p>"At this period of the colony, when the tide of emigration
appears more decided and directed to its shores than heretofore,
the importance of the discovery (by the party forming the
expedition which your Excellency was pleased last year to place
under my direction) of an extensive tract of fine pasturage at
the western base of the dividing range of mountains lying in the
parallel of 28 deg. S. latitude, at, moreover, but a short
distance from the shores of Moreton Bay, becomes enhanced in no
ordinary degree.</p>
<p>"The considerable tracts, however, of very inferior land and
absolute desert, so characteristic of no small portion of the
interior lying between Hunter's river and the beautiful pastoral
country above referred to, through which my exploring party
penetrated amidst numerous difficulties, a distance bordering on
three hundred miles, presenting a barrier to all communication by
the farmer with it overland from the southward, at once suggested
to me the necessity of endeavouring to discover from what other
point near the sea coast it could be more readily approached, to
be fully available to the grazier. Its separation from the
coast-line and interesting country lying on the Brisbane river,
by the lofty dividing range, the summit of which has been
estimated to exceed four thousand feet of absolute height above
the level of the sea, appeared at first to hold out no
encouragement to the explorer to examine that formidable barrier
with the slightest hope of discovering a passage over it to the
shores of Moreton Bay, or country lying to the north and
east.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding, at the head of a valley, stretching directly
into the midst of this chain of mountains in a north-east
direction, a gap, or hollow in the main ridge, was discerned last
year, by which it was then conceived a communication might be
effected with the very moderately surfaced lands lying between
the eastern foot of these mountains and the sea.</p>
<p>"Many circumstances, however, to which myself and my party
were entirely subjected at that period did not allow of this
mountain defile being otherwise than very partially looked at,
and considering that it could be more fully and leisurely
explored from the eastern side, its further end, more particular
examination was reserved to the period of a visit which I then
contemplated making at some future day by sea to Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>"That period at length arrived last winter, and it is the
general result of my excursion in the country lying southerly
from the Brisbane river, upon which I have now the honour to
address your Excellency.</p>
<p>"The occupations of Mr. Fraser, the Colonial Botanist (whom,
your Excellency was pleased to permit to accompany me to Moreton
Bay) and myself, for some period after our arrival at that
settlement upon the Brisbane, investigating those extremely
interesting vegetable productions, which so highly invest the
banks of that river, did not permit me to prepare for a journey
suggested by the excellent commandant, Captain Logan, towards the
Mount Warning Ranges, until nearing the end of the month of
July.</p>
<p>"With four weeks' provisions for eight persons, and
accompanied by that gentleman and Mr. Fraser, I commenced (on the
24th of that month) my journey from the river's bank, opposite
the settlement, from which point a line of road had been marked
about five miles in a southerly direction, towards some very
thinly and lightly-wooded lands known by the title of 'Cowper's
Plains', to which salt water flows from the Brisbane river,
through the medium of Canoe creek of the late Mr. Oxley, the
clearing of which at its upper part of fallen timber, to render
it navigable (during the rise of the flood tide) for boats of
burden to the plains, which are said to contain two thousand or
three thousand acres of good available land, fit for agricultural
purposes, will doubtless be at some future period worth
effecting.</p>
<p>"The country upon which we entered from the bank of the
Brisbane we found to consist for the most part of rather heavily
timbered forest ground, of a slightly undulated surface,
productive of good grass, but (at that season) very indifferently
supplied with water. The timbers were chiefly of the prevailing
eucalyptus&mdash;viz., iron bark, white and red gums, with an
occasional interspersion of the casuarina, or forest oak, and a
tree affecting humid situations, the density of whose laurel-like
foliage cast a most agreeable shade around. It forms a species of
Mr. Brown's <i>tristania</i> genus, yet unpublished. In something
short of five miles, the marked track terminates at a fresh water
creek, from which, having rested the bullocks a short period, and
observed the altitude of the sun on the meridian, which gave us
for latitude 27 deg. 33 min. 3 sec. S., we resumed our journey
upon a course by compass, south, over the extensive wooded flat,
bearing marks of irrigation by rains in wet seasons, Cowper's
Plains lying about a mile to the westward of our line of
route.</p>
<p>"The weight of provisions and baggage borne by the pack
bullocks proving so considerable as to require constant care not
to push them in their daily stages beyond their strength, and
thereby defeat the designs so fully contemplated in the plan of
our journey, it was proposed to halt for the day, upon reaching
(at our seventh mile) Canoe creek, at a part of it sufficiently
distant from its point of connexion with the Brisbane, to afford
us an ample supply of fresh water. We therefore, on crossing it,
pitched our tents on the bank&mdash;our barometer at sunset
showing us that we were at so low a level that our elevation
above the sea shore was scarcely recognisable by the mercurial
column.</p>
<p>"The country at south for about ten miles preserves a like
depressed surface, and may be characterised by an alternation of
tea-tree flats, exceedingly swampy in wet weather, and low hungry
forest ground in which honeysuckles (<i>Banksia compar</i> of
botanists) are very generally interspersed. Continuing southerly,
however, the land improves, an undulation of the surface takes
place, and the soil becomes richer, furnishing some tolerable
patches of grass. In these forest grounds several dry
water-channels were crossed, and as these all dipped easterly, we
were led to conclude that we were approaching some stream, the
head of which we at length reached in latitude 27 deg. 48 min. ¼
S. It proved to be the Logan river, which after a course of about
twenty miles to the eastward, disembogues itself on the southern
shores of Moreton Bay. At the point at which we crossed it, it
assumed the character of a murmuring brook, hastening with a
brisk current towards the sea, about ten or fifteen yards in
breadth, and although fordable in many parts, nevertheless bore
upon its alluvial brushy banks the manifest proof of being
flooded, in seasons of protracted rain, to the depth of twenty
feet. Upon passing some ordinary forest ground, where were
observed some huts of natives that appeared to have been recently
occupied, we again intersected the tortuous channel of this small
river, which on being traced up southerly about two miles was
observed to take a bend from the westward, in which direction the
country appeared again perfectly level, but so generally covered
with 'viney brush' as to form a jungle far too dense to allow of
our attempting a passage through it with our laden oxen, with the
view of avoiding an elevated rocky range of forest hills which
now lay in our way at south.</p>
<p>"By a stony lateral ridge we succeeded, beyond expectation and
without difficulty or accident, in gaining the summit of this
range, which declining to the westward southerly, induced us to
trace this ridge in that direction to the close of the day, when
we were obliged to halt on a part of the ridge destitute of
water, which, however, was discovered after a diligent search at
the foot of the range, distant about a mile.</p>
<p>"In tracing this range (to which was given the name of Birnam)
we penetrated some patches of brush which afforded Mr. Fraser and
myself several interesting unpublished plants: and of the rocks,
we gathered some fragments of a stone which the natives had been
using to scrape or polish their spears. It was perfectly white,
exceedingly compact, and although appearing like granulated
quartz, nevertheless contained much clay.</p>
<p>"This range would seem to be the pass used by the natives in
their wanderings from the country we have already traversed, to
the forest lands southerly, since on resuming our route on the
morning of the 28th, we found a passage at the south base of the
ridge, cut through a thick brush, in which there were abundant
traces of these Indians having frequently passed and repassed.
From the south-west foot of the Birnam Range we prosecuted our
journey over a patch of improving forest ground to an exceedingly
pretty patch of plain, about a mile in breadth by perhaps four in
length from east to west. Its soil proved to be exceedingly rich,
and well clothed with grass and other esculent vegetables. This
very interesting spot, which Captain Logan named 'Letitia's
Plain', is watered on its western side by the Logan, the channel
of which was perceived to bend its course northerly round the
western base of Birnam Range.</p>
<p>"In the forest ground on the south side of the plain we
reached a lagoon of considerable depth, and about one fourth of a
mile in length, which appeared to be entirely sustained by the
surcharge of waters of the Logan in seasons of long rains. Whilst
Mr. Fraser was engaged taking up the knobbed roots of a beautiful
nymph&oelig;a-like aquatic,* which had unrolled its ample
heart-shaped leaves to the solar heat on the surface of this
water, I observed the latitude at its southern extremity, which
proving to be 27 deg. 56 min. 0.5 sec. S., placed our position on
the chart 27½ geographical miles south of Brisbane Town, its
longitude by account being 3½ miles west of the meridian of that
settlement&mdash;viz., 152 deg. 58 min. E. Pursuing our journey
southerly through an open forest, having the river, overshadowed
by a density of viney thicket immediately on our right, we
traversed flats of good ground, liable, however, to occasional
inundation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This fine plant I examined on the spot, and
was with Mr. Fraser much gratified to find it was an undescribed
species of that division of the Linnæan <i>genus menyanthes</i>,
which now constitutes the distinct one named <i>Villarsia</i>, by
M. Ventenat.]</p>
<p>"As the country on the opposite bank of the river appeared
altogether more open and better adapted for travelling than the
one on which we were pursuing our way, it became desirable to
cross it at any part where the investing brush on the banks would
admit of the descent of the bullocks to the bed of the stream.
This we discovered at our third mile from the lagoons; we,
therefore, passed over to the level ground on the western bank,
and then finding the day was far spent (so much time having been
unavoidably occupied in conveying the various baggage over on the
shoulders of the people) it was deemed advisable to rest.</p>
<p>"During the whole of the following day (29th July) we were
confined to our tents by heavy rain, which had been blown over to
us from the mountain ranges by the prevailing westerly wind. Some
short periods of intermission of the falling showers, allowing
the sun to burst forth, enabled me to observe an azimuth, as also
the latitude at noon. The former gave a variation of 8 deg. 35
min. east, whilst the latter showed us that we were within 2 min.
of the parallel of 28 deg. S. The results of the barometrical
data gave our encamping ground a mean elevation of about three
hundred and twenty feet above the shores of Moreton Bay; and the
mean temperature of the atmosphere during the rain was 59 deg.
Fahr.</p>
<p>"Fine weather being again restored to us on the morning of the
30th, we continued our journey to the S.S.W.&mdash;a course
shaped to us by the direction from which the channel of the Logan
had inclined. The flat over which we travelled we found of a fine
rich soil, and among the grasses (the usual products of such
lands) we remarked the native bird's foot trefoil (<i>lotus
Australis</i>.)</p>
<p>"In a north-western direction, this forest-flat appeared to
extend several miles towards that lofty mountain marked on the
old charts 'High Peak' *&mdash;an elevated cone, forming no
inconsiderable feature of the landscape of that part of the
country on which it stands. Immediately before us in our course
we observed an interesting hilly country, and on completing our
third mile over the forest flat, reached the foot of a grassy
hill, under the eastern base of which the river winds from about
south.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Recently named "Flinder's Peak".]</p>
<p>"Climbing this eminence in company with Captain. Logan and Mr.
Fraser, we found it commanded a very rich and extensive view,
embodying perhaps as much variety of feature as is to be met with
in any known part of New South Wales. Immediately beneath us an
extent of grassy vale stretched to the southward, bounded on
either side by elevated forest ridges, lightly timbered, and
seemingly clothed with a grassy verdure to their very
summits.</p>
<p>"Through this vale we could trace with the eye the windings of
the Logan several miles from a lofty country at south, in which
we subsequently discovered that stream to originate; and on
extending our view to the S.S.W. and S.W., a bold and singularly
precipitous range of mountain peaks met the eye, distant by
estimation about twenty-five miles, the interjacent country being
of considerably less elevation, but broken and irregular.</p>
<p>"It was to the base of these peaks that Captain Logan (who had
considered one or other of them to be the cone of Mount Warning)
had penetrated last year from Brisbane Town, and with his usual
perseverance had attempted (although in vain) to gain the summit
of the highest point.</p>
<p>"A simple reference, however, to the chart of the coasts and
adjacent country on which I had marked our position (determined
as respects latitude by astronomical observation; and with regard
to longitude by a careful account kept from Brisbane Town),
showed me that we were at least fifteen geographical miles to the
westward of the meridian assigned that lofty peak by navigators,
and that, therefore (unless we are disposed to agree with Captain
Rous, who asserts that it is actually situated 'at least twenty
miles further inland than has been allotted to it in the map',*
which cannot possibly be the case), it is abundantly obvious that
the lofty points before us, bearing S.W. and S.S.W., are
perfectly distinct from the range seen daily from seaward by the
passing mariner, of which Mount Warning, of that circumnavigator,
the immortal Cook, is the most elevated pinnacle.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide Wilton's Quarterly Journal</i>, vol. I
(No. IV.) p. 353.]</p>
<p>"Descending this hill, which received the name of Mount
Dunsinane, we pursued our journey to the south about five miles
through the valley to a small, round, rocky mount, perfectly
isolated, and standing above the plane of the vale about one
hundred and fifty feet. At the foot of this remarkable hill,
immediately on the bank of the river, we again rested. Before
ascending this rocky mount, to take a few connecting bearings, we
observed its eastern side and summit were composed of trap-rock
in large irregular masses, whilst the western slopes were studded
with basaltic columns of regular prismatic figure of five sides,
of which some were from four to five feet in height by about one
in diameter. The original position of these columns, which was
doubtless erect, appeared to us evidently to have been disturbed
by some violent concussion, as many were thrown down on their
sides, whilst others, by being wedged up, stood so nearly upright
as not to incline more than a few degrees out of a vertical line.
Finding this hill too low to allow me to make any observations of
the country before us, beyond what we had already noted, we
descended to the tents. On arriving upon the ground at the close
of the day's stage, on which we had encamped, we perceived a
rising smoke at the foot of the hill, and immediately afterwards
observed two or three natives upon the summit, to which
commanding spot they had with the utmost precipitation retired.
On our reaching the top of the mount they had descended the
opposite side, and had in all probability crossed the river to a
brush on the right bank, as an old man who had concealed himself
behind a tree near the bottom of the hill ran off (upon our
passing the spot) in that direction, in a state of dreadful
apprehension; and such was the alarm produced by our presence
that it totally prevented that friendly parley which we would
have wished to have brought about.</p>
<p>"At the tire we found the bags and little paraphernalia of the
women, showing clearly that the precipitous haste with which
these savages had urged their flight had not even afforded them a
moment to gather their few articles of economy together.</p>
<p>"Around were quantities of the large seed of that exceedingly
ornamental tree of close woods, called at Moreton Bay
'chestnut',** for which, when roasted, it is by no means a bad
substitute. Upon these nuts the few natives who wander through
these lonely regions chiefly subsist during some months of the
year, as (like the English chestnut, <i>castanea vesca</i>) they
contain evidently some saccharine and much farinaceous matter,
and by being well roasted are rendered easy of digestion.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This tree, than which there is no plant
indigenous to the shores of Moreton Ray and adjacent country upon
which the eye rests with greater pleasure, constitutes a genus
perfectly distinct from any yet published; and, independent of
its highly ornamental habit and refreshing shade afforded by its
densely-leaved branches, its nuts are produced in pods in such
abundance as to be ere long worthy the attention of the farmer,
as its fruit would form nutritive food for pigs, &amp;c. The tree
affects a rich and moist soil.]</p>
<p>"At about two miles south from our encampment the Logan bends
from the eastward, watering in its course a patch of plain,
originally seen by Lieutenant Innes, of His Majesty's 57th
Regiment, who, during his residence at Moreton Bay, frequently
undertook bush excursions. Captain Logan attached that officer's
name to it, and it now appears on the chart.</p>
<p>"The valley through which we continued our journey south
(named also by our excellent commandant 'Erris Vale') continues
from the basaltic hill about five miles, and is then bounded on
the south by forest hills of an indifferent character.
Prosecuting our course southerly, we penetrated a progressively
rising country, and on passing a succession of forest ridges, at
length again had a sight of the river, which had wound its
channel from the westward among the lofty wooded ridges which at
length invested us on all sides. On the 1st August, on pushing
our way further to the south, we crossed the Logan, much
diminished in size, and after a fruitless attempt to continue to
the southward, we found ourselves so perfectly hemmed in by
steep, lofty, wooded ridges, that we were obliged to return to
the river, which we traced westerly until its division into
divers streamlets indicated our near approach to its source.</p>
<p>"On the 2nd August we were climbing the hills, and pursuing as
steady a course to the S.W. as the difficult nature of the ground
would admit of; early in the afternoon of this day we descended
to a flat or valley, when (finding abundance of good water) I
directed the tents to be pitched at a short distance from the
spot whereon Captain Logan had last year bivouaced.</p>
<p>"We had now approached within three miles of the actual base
of the stupendous range of mountains (first seen from Mount
Dunsinane) whose broad dome-like and conical summits, of rock for
the most part, denuded of vegetation, and now fully open to our
view, presented a specimen of bold and rugged scenery not to be
found in any other explored part of the country. It was
originally our design to penetrate no further to the southward
than the base of the Colossean Range, in which Captain Logan
still considered the peak of Mount Warning was situate, and,
therefore, as our bullocks required some repose, it was proposed
to employ what time we had to spare in exploring the most
elevated of the mountain group, and afterwards endeavour, by
stages that would not distress our oxen, to proceed westerly
towards the gap or hollow on the back of the Dividing Range.</p>
<p>"Upon setting up the barometer at the close of the day, the
mercurial column, I was surprised to find, had fallen to 28.52
in., which showed us that, notwithstanding the hills we had
climbed since we left the Vale of Erris, our tents did not stand
on higher ground above the level of the ocean than nine hundred
and fifty-three feet.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">"<span class="a">The Excursion to the Summit of
Mount Lindesay</span>.</p>
<p>"The morning of the 3rd (August) dawned on us with a singular
clearness of atmosphere, and as its temperature was unusually low
and bracing (33 deg.), we were induced to quit our tents at an
early hour to commence the very interesting labours of the day.
Having made every requisite preparation, we proceeded from our
encamping ground at six o'clock on our journey to the summit of
the highest mountain (the easternmost of the range) bearing from
the tents south, 43 deg. west about three miles.</p>
<p>"Our direct course lay over an extent of thinly-timbered flat,
recently burnt by the natives, and stretching nearly two miles to
the base of the first range of forest hills, the back of which we
gained by a sharp acclivity.</p>
<p>"Travelling along the ridge about another half-mile, we
ascended rapidly to the immediate base of the mountain, whence
the difficulties of the ascent commenced among large masses of a
compound rock, forming large blocks and shelving slabs of vast
dimensions, upon which, and in the intermediate interstices
flourished most luxuriantly many tufty plants, from among which
Mr. Fraser and myself culled several previously unknown species
to enrich our respective collections. With considerable exertion,
I climbed to a point in elevation equal to one-third of the
extreme altitude of the mountain, when the face became so
singularly precipitous, and in consequence the further advance
attended altogether with so much danger, that I deemed it prudent
to proceed no further, especially as I had attained a height from
which I could make all the necessary observations that I could
desire. I had, moreover, a barometer with me, which it was
scarcely possible to avoid injuring had I attempted to have
scaled some rocks (in position nearly vertical) immediately above
me.</p>
<p>"Whilst I was occupied taking a set of interesting bearings to
points around, not previously seen, our indefatigable commandant
and Mr. Fraser, who had both preceded me in the ascent, continued
their journey towards the summit, notwithstanding the alarming
steepness of many parts of this mountain's face.</p>
<p>"The cone of Mt. Warning, respecting the true situation of
which we were divided in opinion, I was gratified in no ordinary
degree to see distinctly, amidst a group of mountains, nearer the
coast line, and bearing east by south, distant from twenty-five
to thirty miles. This most fully confirmed me, in what I have
already advanced, respecting the position, its bearing, and
estimated distance, carrying it as far easterly as the meridian
under which those truly scientific navigators. Captains Cook and
Flinders, have long ago placed this most striking of all
landmarks on this coast to the passing seaman! It was now that
Captain Logan clearly saw his mistake in supposing one of the
peaks of the mountains about us, and which cannot be perceived
from seaward, to be the Mt. Warning of Cook.</p>
<p>"A range, distant scarcely ten miles, and stretching from east
by north to south-east, of elevated bold appearance, was named
'Macpherson's Range', in compliment to Major Macpherson, of His
Majesty's 39th Regiment, whilst its southern extreme, a very
bluff head, and a rounded mount or hummock about its centre,
received each respectively the names of 'Coke' and
'Burrough'.</p>
<p>"Along the eastern rise of Macpherson's Range I could trace a
deep ravine, bounded on its eastern side by a vertical wall of
rocks of very rugged aspect. This ravine was, at the suggestion
of Mr. Fraser, named 'Glen Lyon', and through it ran a stream
(indicated by a line of mist throughout its length) which,
doubtless, falls southerly into the channel of a river seen by
Captain Logan from the summit of this mountain, and which, from
the direction of its course towards the sea at south-east, is,
doubtless, the 'Richmond' of Captain the Hon. H.E. Rous, of His
Majesty's Ship 'Rainbow'.</p>
<p>"To the east of Glen Lyon the entire country, extending to the
lofty ridges connected with the Mt. Warning group, appeared
exceedingly broken and irregular.</p>
<p>"A lofty mountain, bearing N. by E. five miles, received from
Captain Logan the title of 'Clanmorris', whilst to a lofty wooded
peak lying about ten miles further to the north I attached the
name of my friend Lieutenant Hughes, of the Royal Staff
Corps.</p>
<p>"At S.S.E. five miles a very precipitous rocky head, in figure
seemingly inaccessible from any point around us, was named 'Mount
Hooker', in honour of the mutual friend of Mr. Fraser and myself,
the very learned and scientific Regius Professor of Botany in the
University of Glasgow. Far to the north points were distinctly
discerned, particularly the towering peak of Captain Flinders,
now bearing the name of that very accurate nautical surveyor.
Having noted all the more prominent features of the country
around, excepting at S. and S.S.W., in which direction my
position on the mountain prevented my observation, I employed
myself awhile investigating the scrubby blighted vegetable
productions about me, and, among the many described well known
plants, I gathered several, yet unpublished, to add to my daily
augmenting collections. I also set up the barometer (which I had
with much care carried from Brisbane Town), with the view of
deducing the elevation of my station above our encampment, the
height of which above the level of the sea I had already
measured, I had, however, to regret that in the carriage from the
tents to the point at which I had halted the instrument had
become deranged by some sudden jerk it had received, which had
divided the column of mercury, and thus had rendered it perfectly
useless.</p>
<p>"A subsequent trigonometrical operation, however, gave the
spot a height of about one thousand five hundred feet above our
encampment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fraser had followed the Commandant up the very steep face
of the mountain more than double that elevation above me, but,
arriving at the base of a rock nearly perpendicular, without a
bush to assist him to pass above it, he very wisely stopped, and,
having rested and contemplated with pleasure the grandeur of the
surrounding scene from so considerable a height (verging on four
thousand above the level of the sea), he began his descent.</p>
<p>"It was not, however, without great difficulty, and on more
than one occasion at great risk of life itself, that he found his
way back to my station, much bruised, and in a state of
considerable exhaustion.</p>
<p>"Five hours, however, elapsed before the Commandant, who had
with great labour carried the extreme summit of this formidable
mountain, returned to us. This considerable eminence afforded him
a very extensive bird's-eye view of the entire circumjacent
country. The sea was seen at S.S.E. over the very low country
lying between the southern extremes of the Mount Warning Range
and the coast line, and a fine open grazing country breaking into
plains was also distinctly perceived to the S.W., at which the
traveller might arrive, upon passing about twenty miles of broken
brushy country, from the base of the mountain, a few miles from
which a river was observed, bending its course to the southward
and eastward, which has since been considered by Captain Logan to
be none other than either a branch or the main branch of the
Richmond, recently discovered by Captain the Hon. Mr. Rous.</p>
<p>"About the close of the day we returned to our tents, amply
rewarded for our respective exertions by the various interesting
observations each had made.</p>
<p>"The mountain which we had visited, which is the easternmost
of the range, was named 'Mount Lindesay', as a compliment to the
officer commanding his Majesty's 39th Regiment in this
colony.</p>
<p>"Our bullocks requiring further rest, we determined to remain
encamped during the whole of the following day (4th Aug).</p>
<p>"Whilst Captain Logan was absent on an excursion to ascertain
how far a communication could be opened round the eastern base of
Mount Lindesay with the apparently fine grazing country seen in a
south-western direction from the summit of that lofty mountain, I
was occupied in taking the necessary observations for the
determination of our situation. These gave the following
results:</p>
<p>"Latitude by a solar meridional altitude 28 deg. 15 min. 21
sees. S., longitude 152 deg. 45 min. 45 sees. E., or sixteen
geographical miles west of Brisbane Town. Variation of the needle
(by azimuth) 11 deg. E. I also measured a base of six hundred and
eight yards on an extensive flat near the tents, and observing
the angles I obtained by the summit of Mount Lindesay ascertained
its perpendicular height over our encampment to be four thousand
seven hundred and fifty feet. To this, upon adding nine hundred
and fifty-three feet, the elevation of the parts above the sea
shore (as already determined by the barometer), the mean height
of this mountain above the level of the sea shore is shown to be
five thousand seven hundred and three feet, which is by far the
most elevated point (measured) that has hitherto been ascended by
any European in Australia.</p>
<p>"In the evening our laborious Commandant returned to the
encampment, having fully satisfied himself of the practicability
of marking a road to the country lying to the S.W., by directing
its line to leave the Mount Lindesay Range to the west.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 5th we broke up our encampment and,
conformably with the plan of our journey, made an attempt to
pursue a course to the westward with the design of penetrating to
the hollow in the back of the Dividing Range, discovered in June,
1827.</p>
<p>"Invested as we were by steep hills and lofty mountainous
lands, it was with some difficulty that we pushed our way
northerly through a glen bounded on the west side by forest hills
immediately connected with Mount Clanmorris, and to the east by a
steep rocky sided ridge, overhanging a brook (formed by a
junction of the creek, at which we last rested, with others),
which ran briskly through it northerly over a bed of large
stones, so much rounded by water attrition as to render the
crossing and re-crossing its channel, which was necessary, too
dangerous to allow me to risk the lives of the bullocks in the
passage. They were, therefore, sent round among the hills
easterly, and after a circuitous route of about four miles, again
joined me on a level open patch of forest ground.</p>
<p>"We then prosecuted our course to the north-west, climbing
moderately elevated wooded ridges with an occasional flat of good
soil, and observing all the watercourses uniformly dipped
easterly, and therefore threw the rains that are collected in
these hills in a wet season into the Logan. From several points
in these hills, I took bearings to a lofty wooded mount, named
last year by Captain Logan in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel
Shadforth, of her Majesty's 57th Regiment, as also to a
remarkable conical-shaped hill of considerable elevation,
situated to the W.S.W. about fifteen miles, which also Captain
Logan had named after a friend, 'Wilson's Peak'.</p>
<p>"After penetrating about seven miles to the N.W., we gained
the pitch of the hills, whence we observed at a distance of about
two miles to W.N.W. a patch of plain, bounded on its western side
by a ridge of craggy hills, of which the Commandant immediately
recognised a point at whose base he had, in the progress of his
last year's campaign, bivouaced. Our oxen having descended on its
western side with considerable difficulty, owing to the steepness
of the declivity from the several rocky heads and abrupt
terminating bluffs it presented to that cardinal point, we soon
reached the plain, which we found to be a reedy flat, without a
tree, of a springy sponginess to the tread, and evidently
extremely swampy in wet weather. The long protracted droughts of
the year had, however, dried the surface sufficiently hard to
allow our burdened beasts to cross it (a breadth of a mile) to
the channel of a rivulet, washing the eastern foot of the craggy
hills. On the western bank of this stream (which is a tributary
to the Logan, and named 'Teviot Brook'), we were very glad to
encamp, as the sun had some time dipped below the western
horizon. This plain or marsh flat, which lies nearly north and
south, is about three miles in length, and is (as already
observed) bounded on the west by a low ridge of rocky hills of
singularly picturesque appearance, named at the suggestion of Mr.
Fraser, 'Minto Craigs'.</p>
<p>"South-westerly beyond these craggy hills, we had a peep at a
part of the Dividing Range, which, with other elevated grounds at
south, formed as beautiful a landscape as can well be conceived;
and if anything tended to give a higher effect to the extremely
pleasing scene, as it opened to us while crossing the marshy
flat, it was the warm tints produced by the radiance of the
setting sun, striking upon the naked rocks of the craig. Just
before we halted, five emus, which were feeding on the plain,
joined together and, as if prompted by curiosity to know what we
were, stalked over the flat after us, preserving, however, a
respectful distance from the dogs. We were all too much engaged
to give chase to them; they, therefore, after following us some
distance, filed off, and retiring with some little precipitancy
to the wooded lands, as if fully apprehensive of danger,
disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>"A hill of square tabulated figure, bearing about north seven
or eight miles, was last year named by Captain Logan 'Mount
French', and a singularly sharp-pointed one wooded to its extreme
summit, and lying to the N.E. about nine miles received from me
the title of 'Knapp's Peak', after an esteemed friend, at this
time attached to the department of the Surveyor-General in this
colony.</p>
<p>"At an early hour on the morning of the 7th August we broke up
our encampment with the fullest expectation of making a loner
stage to the westward.</p>
<p>"Passing the northern extreme of Minto Craigs, we pursued our
course to the N.W. over a hilly country until, in about our
fourth mile, we reached another and more extensive patch of
plain, on which I observed the meridional altitude of the sun,
which gave for latitude 28 deg. 4 min. 26 sees. S., and showed us
that we had arrived at about the parallel of the mountain gap,
which bore west from us.</p>
<p>"Perceiving, however, that the plain was flanked on its west
and north-western sides by densely brushed rocky ridges connected
with Mount French, through which it appeared extremely doubtful
whether we could penetrate with the bullocks to the foot of the
Dividing Range, it was proposed at once to halt and employ the
remainder of the day in determining the practicability of
effecting a passage through them to the westward. We therefore
(about one o'clock) set up the tents on the edge of the plain,
near to a pond of exceedingly fine water.</p>
<p>"Our unwearied Commandant, attended by two of the most
intelligent of the people, undertook to examine the rocky western
ridge, and I in the meantime ascertained our position, took
bearings to points around, and obtained a set of azimuths, which
gave a variation easterly of lo deg. 3 min.</p>
<p>"This beautiful plain, to which I had much pleasure in
attaching the title of Dulhunty, as a compliment to the highly
respectable family of that name residing in this colony, lies
about S.S.W. and N.N.E., and in extent is about five miles in
length by three-fourths of a mile in breadth.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding the sad drought to which it was everywhere
manifest the entire country through which we had passed had been
long subjected, we nevertheless found this plain abundantly
watered by a chain of ponds fed from the hills at S.W., which in
seasons of much rain unite, and overflowing the flatter surfaces,
eventually drain off to the N.E., and become a tributary to the
Logan. The soil of Dulhunty's Plain is in all parts of
exceedingly rich quality, capable of yielding heavy crops of
grain, and although it appeared scarcely sound enough for sheep
pasture, the whole presented a fine range of horse and cattle
feed. At the close of the day Captain Logan returned to us,
having climbed the rocky barrier to the westward, which he found
clothed with so thick a jungle of twining plants, that it was
with the utmost difficulty he gained a commanding point, whence
he saw it was quite impracticable to penetrate westward to the
Dividing Range. He observed also that the only course we could
possibly pursue was to the northward easterly, in which direction
the country not only appeared moderate, but also unencumbered by
those thickets, which in many parts form a perfect jungle on a
level surface many miles in extent, and which we have repeatedly
satisfied ourselves are not to be passed by laden bullocks, until
the axe has fully effected a passage for them.</p>
<p>"On the 8th we stood away to the N.E., across Dulhunty's
Plains, and in two miles and a-half reached the thinly-timbered
forest ground, well watered by the Logan, which at length had
become a connected stream.</p>
<p>"In other two miles to the N.E. we entered a second plain of
small dimensions, probably containing about seven hundred acres,
to which was given the name of Rattray, after a relative of Mr.
Fraser. As we continued our journey we could not but admire the
landscape that the country at E. and S.E. presented, made up of
gently rising forest hills, with here and there a point somewhat
more elevated, having in their midst the sharp cone named Knapp's
Peak, which overlapped the whole.</p>
<p>"The forest ridge continuing to stretch to the north, obliged
us to pursue our course to the eastward of that cardinal point.
At noon on crossing the channel of the Logan, we found ourselves
by observation exactly in the parallel of 28 deg. S., and
perceiving that it was not possible to make our way to the
westward from our present position, in consequence of the brushy
ridges which we now perceived to stretch across the country
northerly to the foot of Flinder's Peak, I was induced, by the
advice of Captain Logan, (who had become anxious to return to the
settlement) to relinquish my design of making the mountain gap
from this part of the country, but rather prosecute our journey
to the N. and N.E., until we should pass the parallel of latitude
of Flinders' Peak on its easternmost side, and on effecting which
no obstacle would prevent our making the Limestone Station on
Bremer's river (a tributary to the Brisbane), whence the Dividing
Range could be approached with the utmost ease, as the
interjacent country was known to Captain Logan to be of very
moderate surface. Thus determined, we pursued our way to the
E.N.E., about three and a-half miles over a succession of forest
ridge and narrow valleys, when, again intersecting the Logan at
our eleventh mile, we were induced to halt, as our bullocks were
much exhausted.</p>
<p>"At daybreak on the 9th August, the Commandant despatched two
of our party with letters to Brisbane Town, and by that
opportunity I wrote to the officer in charge of the commissariat
to forward to me at the Limestone Hills on the Bremer a further
supply of rations to enable me to perform the journey I had in
contemplation from that station, south-westerly to the pass
through the mountains discovered in June, 1827.</p>
<p>"On resuming our journey this day, we left the Logan and
repeatedly made attempts to pass to the westward at points
appearing likely to afford us a passage through. All our essays
were, however, in vain, for the dense repulsive thicket soon
stopping our progress, showed us that the utmost we could
possibly effect would be to pursue our course to the northward
and eastward. We therefore continued over low forest ridges,
taking care to clear the brush which occasionally stretched down
them to the narrow intermediate valleys, in which we again met
the Logan, and as we had completed our tenth mile we halted on
its bank. From this encamping ground we observed the hills
connected with Birnam Range, the central part of which bore
nearly east from us, and appeared to be distant ten miles.</p>
<p>"At our second mile to the north, in our stage of the
following day, the Logan, which we had traced from its source,
left us altogether by trending away to the E.N.E. Throughout the
day we were climbing hills, with Flinder's Peak continually in
view, the base of which we were unable to approach, it being
perfectly surrounded by steep and rocky ridges.</p>
<p>"It was not until after sunset that water was discovered for
the use of our exhausted bullocks and selves, and although it was
found in small quantity, and in a stagnant state, we were
exceedingly glad to close our labours for the day at it. Early in
the morning of the 11th Captain Logan and Mr. Fraser left me for
Brisbane Town, distant about twenty-four miles. As my views were
entirely directed to the station on the Bremer, I directed the
course of my party to the northward and westward, and after
effecting a stage of ten miles over a hilly uninteresting
country, timbered thickly with ironbark, we rested in a valley
affording both excellent grass and good water to our wearied
oxen.</p>
<p>"We had at length passed sufficiently to the north of the
range connected with Flinder's Peak to be enabled to shape a
course to the westward without further interruption from a
difficult country; we therefore, on commencing our last stage to
the Limestone Station, penetrated directly west among some stony
hills, and after some exertion in the first two miles gained a
more moderate country, and at the seventh mile of our stage came
out upon the skirts of a plain, on the surface of which scattered
fragments of calcareous rocks, flint and agate, fully announced
to us our near approach to the Limestone Hills, at which we
immediately arrived upon crossing the plain to the north-west,
where I found the provisions I had demanded from the commissariat
had already arrived by a boat under charge of my servant. Here I
reduced my establishment to two bullocks, a driver, and my two
servants, sending back to Brisbane Town, agreeably to the request
of Captain Logan, the other two oxen and two servants.</p>
<p>"As I shall have frequent occasion to refer to this station in
what I have further the honour to communicate for your
Excellency's necessary information, I take leave to make a few
observations on its situation and general productions.</p>
<p>"In the course of the last year Captain Logan, in tracing the
Bremer (of the late Mr. Oxley, who merely passed its mouth in
1824) from its junction with the Brisbane, discovered at ten
miles through its many windings from that point, the calcareous
hummocks on its right bank, now named the 'Limestone Hills'.</p>
<p>"Landing, he was much struck with the singular appearance of
the lofty Xanthorrh&oelig;æ or grass trees,* which abound on the
open flats, low hills, and forest grounds at this particular
part, and which the Commandant had not inaptly compared to
bee-hives elevated on stools.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As this extraordinary plant (the genus of
which gives a peculiarity to the vegetation of New South Wales)
was not in a flowering state during my stay at Moreton Bay, I had
no opportunity of determining its species, but from the length of
the decayed last year's scapus or flowering stem, in respect to
the amentum or spike, I am disposed to view this plant as
distinct from both <i>X. arborea</i> of our colony, and <i>X.
Australis</i>, hitherto found only in Van Dieman's Land, each
having an arborescent caudex.]</p>
<p>"Some months after this discovery a kiln was built, and a
party of convicts, consisting of an overseer (acquainted with the
operations of sapping and mining), and live men were stationed at
these hills to commence lime-burning. It was not long before the
station was visited by the wandering aborigines, who, after
threatening the lives of the white men, seized the first
opportunity to run off with their tools.</p>
<p>"To protect the lime-burners from further molestation from
these savages, a corporal and three privates were stationed on
the spot, and from that period no natives have ventured to
approach the huts of either soldiers or people, although they
have been repeatedly seen prowling through the adjacent
woods.</p>
<p>"From three hundred to four hundred baskets of excellent lime
(I am informed) are burnt weekly at this station, which is
regularly conveyed down by boat to Brisbane Town, and there used
in the buildings in progress. The limestone of Bremer's river is
very different in appearance from the calcareous rocks of Argyle,
Bathurst, or Wellington Valley. From these it differs, not simply
in colour, which is either yellowish brown or brownish white, but
also in its quality, it containing much earthy matter, without
impressions of shells or organic remains.</p>
<p>"As far as the hills have been opened, no stratification has
been observed; on the contrary, it appeared in irregular masses
mixed with reddish earth and large blocks of a blackish
flint.</p>
<p>"In some specimens of the latter rock, which I caused to be
broken, I found beautiful specimens of chalcedony, containing
cavities filled with groups of minute crystallised quartz.</p>
<p>"Chalk is also found among the hills, in which are nodules of
flint. A stratum or seam of coal has been observed on the Bremer,
both immediately above and below the station, and as that mineral
was noticed three or four miles to the north, in the steep banks
of dry creeks dipping to the Brisbane, and again in another mile,
in the bed of that river, it is highly probable that the seam
extends nearly horizontally throughout. The soil of these hills
and adjacent country is of a black colour, and, if one might
judge from the luxuriant growth of vegetables cultivated in a
small patch of garden-ground, belonging to the soldiers, is of a
rich quality. The flats and undulated grounds are well clothed
with grasses, and as they are not under any circumstances of
season, other than of a dry character, they form a sound range of
sheep pasture, at present supporting a small flock belonging to
Government.</p>
<p>"During a stay of five days at this station, in which period
the rest and good pasture afforded my bullocks most materially
benefited them, I determined its geographical position as
follows, viz.:&mdash;mean latitude by meridional altitudes of the
sun, 27 deg. 37 min. S.: longitude by the mean of distances of
the sun and moon&mdash;on both sides of the meridian: distances
of the planet Jupiter and moon, and distances of the star
Fomalhaut and moon, mean 152 deg. 47 min. 20 sees. E.: variation
by azimuths, g deg. 45 min. E. Its distance from Brisbane Town by
water has been estimated at about forty-five miles, whilst its
bearing from that settlement is S.W. by W. (true) only eighteen
statute miles.</p>
<p>"From a hill in the immediate vicinity of my tents I took the
following bearings to points in the south-western country about
to be examined:&mdash;Mount Forbes, of Mr. Oxley, a remarkable
hill rising from a level country, and in shape ridged like the
roof of a house, S. 48½ W., about sixteen miles; mountain gap, S.
38½ W., perhaps forty miles; Wilson's Peak, of Captain Logan, S.
12 W., forty-five or fifty miles; Flinder's Peak, S. 19 E.,
twelve miles.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">"<span class="a">Journey to the Gap in the
Dividing Range</span>.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 18th August we proceeded from the
Limestone Hills south-westerly, towards the hollow in the ridge
of the principal or Dividing Range.</p>
<p>"Immediately on leaving the limestone base, and entering the
closer-timbered forest, the land gradually rises and the soil
changes to a lumpy grit, productive only of small and stunted
timber and brushy plants. At our second mile an open moderately
undulated forest ground, appearing at S.W. by S., we pursued our
course in that direction through a variety of nearly level
country, the rock formation of which was chiefly a coarse
sandstone&mdash;quartz and very fine specimens of jasper being
here and there strewed in the forest ground.</p>
<p>"Occasionally the land became more thinly and lightly-wooded,
the soil of which was of a dark rich quality, strewed with small
fragments of calcareous stone, the general appearance altogether
inducing a conclusion that we were approaching open downs.</p>
<p>"Almost immediately, however, the more lofty timbered forest
succeeded, continuing for several miles level and of monotonous
feature. Passing at length a tea-tree flat bearing obvious marks
on the surface of partial inundation in seasons of protracted
rain, we came upon the bank of a narrow but deep creek, falling
north-easterly towards Bremer's river, which, although at this
season a mere chain of stagnant pools, exhibited on its banks
traces of floods twenty feet above its then low level.</p>
<p>"Crossing, we left this creek winding from the southward, and
continuing our route to the southward and westward to our
eleventh mile, I despatched a man to search for water in the
direction of the remarkable level-topped hill seen from the
Limestone Station, and named by Mr. Oxley in 1824 Mt. Forbes.
Such had been the lengthened period of dry weather that we were
obliged to extend our stage beyond the strength of the bullocks
to the thirteenth mile, ere we found a sufficiency of water for
our consumption.</p>
<p>"No natives were met with in this stage, although patches of
the forest grasses had been lately fired, and the recent traces
of these people were noticed on the trunks of the tea-trees, from
which they had torn off the outer paper-like bark to roof their
huts.</p>
<p>"After some heavy showers of rain in the night accompanied by
thunder, the morning of the 19th (August) broke upon us
exceedingly clear, pleasant, and cool, the mean temperature of
the atmosphere at six o'clock being 61 deg.</p>
<p>"Our route to the northward and westward was resumed about
seven o'clock, and having traversed a level patch of open forest
on the eastern side of Mount Forbes, abounding in grass, we
reached some hilly ground at our third mile of very rugged stony
surface. On gaining the summit of a ridge, a most pleasing and
extensive view was laid open to us from S.W.to S., and then to E
and E.N.E.</p>
<p>"At E.N.E., and thence to E.S.E., a large patch of plain lying
N. and S., appeared beneath us, at a distance of about three
miles, in many parts very verdant, and watered evidently by a
large creek, the course of which was marked by a line of swamp
oak winding through its centre. To this plain I attached the name
of Bowerman, as a compliment to my friend, the officer in charge
of His Majesty's magazine at Parramatta.</p>
<p>"The elevated irregular ridge connected with Flinder's Peak
still further to the eastward was very conspicuous, presenting
four distinct pinnacles; and to all the more distant points in a
southerly direction, extending as far as Mount Lindesay, which
was distinctly recognised, bearings were taken.</p>
<p>"On quitting the ridge, we descended to a grassy vale, and
then continued our journey to the S.S.W., through a forest tract,
plentifully clothed with grass, but as far as our observation
extended, destitute of water. As every part of the timbered
lands, through which our course led us, bore manifest proof of
the long existing drought that has prevailed through this, and
other parts of New South Wales, I began to be apprehensive that
we should not readily meet with water for our evening's use. On
completing our tenth mile at the pitch of a low ridge, the ground
appeared on its S.W. side to dip easterly. I therefore sent one
of the people to make a diligent search for water in that
direction. This was almost immediately met with in deep holes,
and as there was abundance of good grass around for our oxen I
again halted. At night a wind from about S.S.W. sprang up, which
freshening to a hard gale, obliged us to secure our tents by
strong wires, to prevent their being blown down. The wind
continued with unabated violence throughout the night, and until
about sunrise of the following morning (20th), when it moderated
considerably. Being by estimation about twelve miles to the N.E.
of the Pass through the Dividing Range, it was my fullest
intention to have penetrated as near to its immediate base in the
course of the day as the nature of the interjacent ground would
permit us. We therefore quitted our encamping ground, soon after
sunrise, but soon had to regret the inability of the bullocks to
travel over some stony hills, which lay in my course in the
earlier part of our journey, owing to the extreme tenderness of
their feet, increased probably by the stages of the preceding
days, which the circumstances of the country had obliged me to
lengthen in our search for water. In consequence, I was obliged
to halt in a valley among the hills, having made only four miles
towards the Pass. At noon I found our latitude to be 27 deg. 56
min. 48 sec. S., and in the afternoon observed an azimuth, which
gave a variation of the compass of 10 deg. 3 min. E. The smoke of
natives' fires was seen curling above the trees a little to the
eastward of us, but these people kept themselves very quiet, not
a voice was heard, or a person seen.</p>
<p>"Aug. 20th. About noon we made another attempt to the foot of
the main range. Climbing a forest ridge at S.W. without
difficulty, the bullocks descended (by the care of my people)
amidst much fallen timber and loose stones, to a valley
stretching north and south, which we crossed, continuing towards
the range over an irregular surface of forest ground to our fifth
mile, when we intersected the stony beds of a mountain torrent,
twelve yards in width, at this season perfectly dry, but
evidently at other periods filled to the depth of six feet. The
position of the drift wood on its shallow bank showed us that its
fall was to the south; it, therefore, most probably pours its
rapid waters into the Richmond of Captain the Hon. E.H. Rous, the
trunk of which it doubtless meets at a much lower level.</p>
<p>"Passing the stony channel of this watercourse, we traversed
an apple-tree flat, pursuing our way over some hilly ground to a
narrow valley, when meeting with fine water, we again halted
within four miles of the actual mouth of the Gap. As it was early
in the afternoon, I despatched an intelligent man to look at and
examine (in a partial way) the hollow in the mountain ridge
directly open to our encampment.</p>
<p>"After an absence of five hours he returned, having failed in
his attempt to climb to the pitch of the Gap&mdash;a wall of
perpendicular rocks rising from a ravine stopping his progress
after he had advanced in direct distance about three miles.</p>
<p>"From the precipitous aspect of this hollow in the Main Range,
its elevated appearance, its breadth between the boundary heads,
added to the total impracticability of gaining its level from the
spot on which our tents stood, I was induced to conceive that the
Gap, into which I had simply looked from its western side in
June, 1827, and which certainly did appear to offer a very
practicable passage through to the eastward, was very distinct
from the one now before us, and as the Dividing Range to the
north of us trended out easterly, I felt disposed to believe it
was to be discerned a few miles in that direction. With this
impression on my mind, we left the spot on which we had rested on
the morning of the 22nd, to proceed round the extremes of the
lateral ridges, a day's journey to the north; intending to
observe attentively as we travelled along the grassy valley we
had crossed every indentation of the main range. We immediately
entered the valley, and in five miles reached its head, which to
the eastward is bounded by rather elevated open forest hills. On
passing a very moderate grassy ridge, stretching E. and W., I
observed the latitude. Continuing about two miles, we descended
to an apple-tree flat, watered by a creek running to the
northward, on which we encamped.</p>
<p>"The low grassy ridge, although of exceedingly moderate rise
above the plane of the country on either side, is nevertheless
sufficiently elevated to give opposite directions to waters
discharged on our east coast, but at points widely separated from
each other. We remarked that those streams falling on the
northern side (its direction being east and west) eventually
joined the Bremer, whilst those descending southerly meandered
through a length of valley to an open country lying south-west
from Mount Lindesay, and without doubt are received into the
Richmond, the embouchure of which Captain Ross has recently
discovered upwards of one hundred and sixty miles to the south of
Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>"As I had determined to remain encamped during the 22nd, I
despatched two of my people at daybreak to the summit of a very
steep forest ridge immediately to the westward of us, with
directions to penetrate to the highest point of the Dividing
Range from which they would be able to make such remarks of the
western country as would enable me to form a just idea of the
situation of the Pass of the last year, and especially by anv
bearings that might be taken to the extensive downs, then
discovered on the western side of this formidable range.
Meanwhile, I ascertained our situation, latitude by observation
27 deg. 55 min. 45 sec.; longitude, deduced from the meridian of
the Limestone Hills, 152 deg. 27 min. 30 sec. E. Among the
brushes that overshadowed the creek on which we were encamped,
grew most luxuriantly, the native bignonia and a fine clematis,
and being intertwined and abundantly in flower, formed the
richest festoons.</p>
<p>"Whilst on the subject of the flora of this fine country, so
generally interesting in all its features, it may be observed
that leaving the viney banks of the Brisbane out of the account,
the whole line of the country through which we have travelled
since we left Brisbane Town, important as really certain portions
of it are to the grazier, has nevertheless proved by no means so
interesting to the botanist,</p>
<p>"The grasses are chiefly those of the colony, the richer flats
and alluvial grounds being adorned with the blooming vetch called
by botanists <i>Swainsona</i>, with <i>lotus Australis</i> or
bird's-foot trefoil, as also a geranium and a senecio frequent in
the Bathurst country. The collections of dried plants that were
formed were therefore detected on the barren rocky ridges and
stony mountains that lay in the way of our expedition.</p>
<p>"In this place I will merely notice the singular association
of our common eucalypti with the tree of a genus whose splendid
scarlet flowers renders it very conspicuous among even the more
brilliant subjects of the flora of intertropical countries. The
tree I allude to is a species of <i>erythrina</i> or coral tree,
which I first observed in an excursion to the foot of Flinders'
Peak. Under the Dividing Range I frequently met with it, in a
forest of blighted uncomely ironbark forming a tree thirty-five
feet high with a smooth trunk, but thorny branches, and during
the winter months without leaves.</p>
<p>"Its last year's pods continued hanging at the extremities of
the branches, and although pigeons (which abound in the woods)
and other fab&oelig;vorous birds had eaten most of the seeds,
still many of a brilliant red colour were found among the grass
beneath each tree.</p>
<p>"It was late in the afternoon ere my two men found their way
back to the encampment, when I learnt from them that from the
grassy ridge which they had ascended in front of the tents, they
had gained a lofty point of the Dividing Range, to the
south-west, from which they observed among the very elevated
mountains bounding their view at west, a valley extending through
them in the direction of N.N.W., to a very low declining country
at that bearing, but as no appearance of plain could be
perceived, and as there did not appear any part of the main range
to the north worth the examination for the Gap, so obvious in the
writer's journey in 1827, it was rationally concluded that either
the hollowback we had just left was the identical pass of the
last year, or that it was in its immediate vicinity. With this
view I concurred, and therefore on the morning of the 24th we
returned southerly towards it, with the fullest determination to
examine leisurely the main range about it from the extreme points
of which I felt quite certain the last year's gap would be
discovered.</p>
<p>"About one o'clock we passed a mile to the southward of our
last position, and entering a valley, we pitched the tents within
three miles of the entrance of the Gap, now suspected to be the
Pass of last year's journey.</p>
<p>"It being early in the afternoon, I sent one of the people
(who, having been of my party on that long tour, knew well the
features of the country lying to the westward of the Dividing
Range) to travel a series of forest ridges which appeared to lead
directly up to the foot of the hollowback of the range. To my
utmost gratification, he returned at dark, having traced the
ridge about two-and-a-half miles to the foot of the Dividing
Range, whence he ascended into the Pass, and, from a grassy head
immediately above it, beheld the extensive country lying west of
the main range.</p>
<p>"He recognised Darling and Canning Downs, patches of Peel's
Plains, and several remarkable points of the forest hills on that
side, fully identifying the hollowback with the Pass discovered
last year at the head of Millar's Valley, notwithstanding its
very different appearance when viewed from the eastern
country.</p>
<p>"Resting my oxen on the 25th, I determined to occupy the whole
of the day in the examination of this very important passage from
the coast lands through a formidable main range of mountains to a
vast, and for the most part, undefined extent of pastoral country
on their western side. Accompanied by my servant, with an
odometric or measuring wheel, we commenced our interesting
labours of the day at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>"From the valley in which we were encamped we immediately
ascended a low forest ridge at south, tending S.S.W. and S.W.
throughout the first mile and a-half. The acclivity proved most
gradual, and the surface of the ridge, although occasionally
rather rugged, was rendered so by small fragments of rock easy to
be removed. Continuing to trace the leading ridge, we found an
ample passage between detached masses of sandstone, which were
covered with parasites (of ferns and <i>dendrobia</i>, or rock
lilies) of species heretofore only found within the tropical
circle.</p>
<p>"In another half-mile the ridge takes a decided bend to the
westward, and its surface becoming wider presented an open patch
of forest ground, timbered chiefly with oak and apple tree, in
quantity sufficient for a small farm. The ridge at length narrows
again, but the acclivity continues most progressive. Patches of
brush now clothe the sides of the ridge, as also the gullies
falling from it, leaving its back clear of wood, open and
grassy.</p>
<p>"At about two and three-quarter miles the ridge bends to the
northward of west, and immediately the summit of the Pass
appeared broad before us, bounded on each side by most stupendous
heads, * towering at least two thousand feet above it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* I had at the time great pleasure in giving
names to these very elevated points of the Dividing Range, which
are very distinctly seen over fifty-four miles of wooded country
from Brisbane Town. The south head, which forms a long-backed
mount with a lofty point at each extremity I have named Mount
Mitchell, in honour of the Surveyor-General of the territory,
whilst the north head was entitled Mount Cordeaux, as a
compliment to Wm. Cordeaux, Esq., of the Surveyor-General's
department.]</p>
<p>"Here the difficulties of the passage commence; we had now
penetrated to the actual foot of the pass without the smallest
difficulty; it now remained to ascend by a steep slope to the
level of its entrance. This slope is occupied by a very close
wood, in which red cedar, sassafras, palms, and other ornamental
intertropical trees are frequent.</p>
<p>"Through this shaded wood we penetrated, climbing up a steep
bank of very rich loose earth, in which large fragments of a very
compact rock (a whitestone) are bedded. At length we gained the
foot of a wall of bare rock, which we found stretching from the
southward into the Pass. This piece of naked rock we perceived
(by tracing its base northerly) gradually to fall to the common
level, so that without the smallest difficulty, and to my utmost
surprise, we found ourselves in the highest part of the Pass,
having fully ascertained the extent of the difficult parts from
the entrance into the wood to this point not to exceed four
hundred yards. We now pushed our way westerly through this
extraordinary defile, and in less than half-a-mile of level
surface, clothed with a thick brush of plants common to the
Brisbane river, reached the opposite side of the main range,
where I observed the waters fell westerly to Millar's Valley,
beneath us.</p>
<p>"Climbing the northern summit of Mount Mitchell, which bounds
the Pass on the south, it was with no small pleasure that I
passed my eye over the beautiful tract of country, at which my
labours of the last year had closed.</p>
<p>"Portions of Canning and Darling Downs, with patches of Peel's
Plains were distinctly recognised at distances of twenty and
thirty miles. The entrance to Logan Vale, indicated by the
table-topped hill named last year 'Mount Sturt', was also
observed, as was the forest ridge overhanging that rich valley
beneath which my tents stood several days at that period. My
elevated situation on Mount Mitchell enabled me to take bearings
to points whose positions are fixed, as well on the western as
the eastern sides of the Barrier Ranges, and thus most
satisfactorily affording me the amplest materials to connect on
the map of the country the northern points of my last year's
journey with the penal settlement on the Brisbane River. The day
was considerably advanced by the time we had effected these truly
interesting observations; we therefore descended to the Pass, and
making the best of our way along the eastern forest ridge,
reached the encampment about eight o'clock, having been occupied
in severe exercise about thirteen hours.</p>
<p>This passage through the Dividing Range is geographically
situated in latitude 28 deg. 2 min. 40 sec. S., and longitude
(reduced from the meridian of the Limestone Station) 152 deg. 24
min. 20 sec. E., and lies S.W. from Brisbane Town fifty-four
miles, being also in direct distance from the sea coast near
Point Danger (of Captain Cook) about sixty-four geographical
miles.</p>
<p>"The weather had favoured our operations throughout the whole
of the day, but we had scarcely been seated within our tents
half-an-hour, before the sky became overcast, and heavy clouds
pressing over us to the eastward in a rapid succession, presaged
the storm that was gathering in and beyond the heights above us.
I had timely taken the precaution to direct the securing of the
tents by extra guys, and, therefore, felt fully prepared to meet
the impending tempest. The thunder (which the otherwise stillness
of these solitudes had allowed us to hear in the distance) at
length approached in rolling peals, and, accompanied by the most
vivid lightning and a deluging rain, commenced a storm as awful,
at the same time as grand, as any that are to be witnessed in
elevated intertropical countries. With unabated violence the
tempest continued until after midnight, when, as if suddenly
exhausted, the wind moderated, the clouds broke, gradually
sinking down towards the horizon, and a bright moon, just past
the full, now burst forth with many a brilliant star, to assure
us, by affording us light to observe the extreme pinnacles of the
mountains perfectly divested of clouds, that at length calm,
serene, and settled weather was again restored to us. During the
whole of this thunderstorm the temperature of the atmosphere
continued without variation: the thermometer stood at 64 deg.</p>
<p>"On the 26th (August) we commenced our journey back to the
Limestone Station, distant something under forty miles. The
surface of the soil felt to the foot quite saturated with the
rains of the last night, and vegetables, generally speaking,
assumed a lively verdure, evidently refreshed by the showers that
had fallen. We soon reached our last encampment on the creek that
ran northerly to the Bremer, and thence pursued a course to the
north, with the design of passing to the westward of Mount
Forbes. This line of route led us over some exceedingly moderate
forest ridges, clothed with a luxuriant carpet of grass, and
timbered with loftier and statelier ironbark than we had for some
time previous remarked.</p>
<p>"In two miles these undulated grounds, which furnish excellent
sheep and cattle pasture, dip to the level of an apple-tree flat
of very rich soil, which appeared to extend northerly several
miles, and forming, by the gentle hills on its eastern side, and
the forest ridges connected with or fronting the Dividing Range
westerly, a most beautiful valley, well watered by the creek, on
which we had rested on the 22nd.</p>
<p>"Continuing north about three miles, through this very level
valley, a patch of plain opened on our view, round the skirts of
which the creek, which we had just previously crossed, bent its
course. This plain, to which I feel gratified in attaching the
name of Lieutenant Bainbrigge, of His Majesty's 57th Regiment,
and at present the very active engineer at Brisbane Town,
measured a mile and a quarter in diameter, and is of an irregular
square figure. It contains about eight hundred acres of beautiful
land, of as truly a level as it is possible to conceive any patch
of ground could be, untouched by the hand of man.</p>
<p>"Nothing can possibly exceed the richness and mellowness of
its fine black soil, and, certainly, there is not in any explored
part of New South Wales a more beautiful subject for the pencil
of the artist than the landscape presented to the traveller from
the centre of Bainbrigge's Plain, to which no description of mine
can possibly do justice. On its north-western side Bainbrigge's
Plain is bounded by a hummocky ridge of rising wooded forest
hills, forming a chain of pretty grassy mounds, behind which the
more colossean main range uprears its bold and towering heads,
stretching its rugged outline far to the southward. Immediately
on the S.E. low forest ridges, and some detached hills, meet the
eye, and one rather elevated and of remarkable figure I named
Mount Fraser, after my friend and fellow-traveller. Whenever this
country is thrown open to the grazier, and a public road is
constituted through the mountain defile just explored to the
exterior western pastures, then will Bainbrigge's plain become a
stage, being nearly equidistant from the Limestone station and
the Pass, from each, when a well western road is formed, not
exceeding a day's journey.</p>
<p>"In about six miles further to the N.N.E. we made the foot of
Mount Forbes, when I determined to rest a whole day, as well to
fix its geographical position as to obtain from its commanding
summit a full set of bearings to all points around, and by them
to connect and close the sketch of my journey.</p>
<p>"From this elevation, which is certainly five hundred feet
above the plane of the circumjacent country, the eye surveyed an
interesting and varied panorama, consisting of every description
of country to be met with in New South Wales, brought fully
within the reach of vision. I set up an excellent Schmalcalder's
compass, and, beginning at a point, took bearings to every
eminence of moment on the circumference of the circle. As the
bearings were to points, already frequently mentioned, no
observation need again be made of them. I would, however, simply
remark that from their station I was at length enabled to fix the
true situations of two lofty hills marked on the chart of the
country to the southward, which I named Mount Edwards and Mount
Greville, the latter in honour of a very distinguished Scotch
botanist.</p>
<p>"Of certain parts of this curiously diversified country it may
be important to know that, upon passing to the eastward ol the
range of Flinders Peak, the land appears a perfect level to the
coast, which an eastern line would intersect about the southern
extreme of Stradbroke Island, so that if it should at any period
be deemed expedient to order a road to be formed from this hill
direct to that part of the coast, when, perhaps, shipping might
ride in safety in what is termed the Southern passage, there
appears no difficulty on passing the line of ridge stretching
southerly from Flinders Peak to prevent its being fully
effected.</p>
<p>"The seeming valley through which the Brisbane river flows
easterly from the sources at N.W., is bounded on the north by an
elevated range of forest hills, in which I perceived, at an
estimated distance of forty miles, a break, through which I could
discern a very distant low country to the north of it.</p>
<p>"Tracing this northern range in a westerly direction, it was
observed to decline at W.N.W., and at length to soften down to
the distant blue line of horizon.</p>
<p>"The principal or Dividing Range, so formidable a barrier as
it really is, in and to the southward of this parallel of
latitude, was observed from this hill to bend its lengthened
ridge to the N.W. and west, and in about thirty-five or forty
miles to terminate, leaving a space between to the western
extreme of the northern forest range above mentioned, so truly
level that the sight is lost on the vast levels that meet with no
visible boundary to the westward.</p>
<p>"Here, then, is an opening between the ranges through which a
fully equipped, well-directed exploring party might pass, with
the view, not simply of carrying on the sketch of the interior
from these points to the tropical circle, but also of acquiring
more precise notions of the aspect and capabilities of the
distant internal country bearing in a W.N.W. direction, than we
at present possess.</p>
<p>"The summit of Mount Forbes presents a narrow level ridge at
its southern extreme, from which it gradually contracts northerly
until it becomes a sharp ledge of rocks, having on the eastern
and western sides precipitous falls of two hundred feet. The rock
is an ironstone, upon which the decomposing effects of the
elements were everywhere obvious, and which, doubtless, has given
the mountain its sharp figure, when viewed either from the north
or south.</p>
<p>"26th. Having ascertained the situation of Mount Forbes as
follows, we prosecuted our journey to the north, along a
continuance of the valley traversed on the 27th:&mdash;latitude,
27 deo". 47 min. S.; longitude, 152 deg. 35 min. E. At noon our
latitude (observed on the bank of the Bremer), placed us five
miles south of the Limestone Hills, which bore from us E.N.E.
about fifteen miles. This distance we effected through a level
open forest country early in the afternoon of the 30th, after
having been absent from that station twelve days.</p>
<p>"I have now laid before your Excellency a detail of all the
leading circumstances of the journeys of geographical research
which I had undertaken during my visit to Moreton Bay, and I now
close this lengthened communication with a few remarks on the
future importance of Bremer's river as a navigable stream, and
the direction to be taken in the construction of a line of road
from the Limestone Hills, southerly, to the Pass and Great
Western Downs. During my stay at the Limestone Hills, and just
previous to my return to Brisbane Town in September last, I
traced the Bremer, through its various windings, to its junction
with the Brisbane, measuring on its bank the length of each
reach; and from the material I then collected I have now
constructed the accompanying outline, to which I beg to refer
your Excellency.</p>
<p>"Bremer's river, which at its mouth is about forty yards wide,
preserves an uniformity of breadth of thirty and thirty-five
yards throughout its tortuous course of ten miles to the
Limestone Station, which point may be considered the head of
navigation, for, almost immediately beyond, ledges of rocks
occupy the bed of the river, which at length rises and separates
the fresh water from the salt. To this station (up to which the
tide flows) the Bremer is of sufficient depth to be navigable for
boats or craft of thirty or forty tons, and as it expands and
forms a natural basin a short distance below the station of
upwards of one hundred yards in width, and with a depth of water
sufficient to float a large ship, the importance of building a
wharf on the right-hand bank of this basin, to which the produce
of the interior might be conveyed to be embarked, will be at some
future day seen. The circumstance, moreover, of this river being
thus far navigable for craft of a certain class, and the
consequent saving to the farmer of that expense which is
necessarily attendant on the wear and tear of a long
land-carriage of internal produce to the coast, cannot possibly
fail, when this country becomes settled on, to be duly
considered.</p>
<p>"It is therefore highly probable that upon the site of these
Limestone Hills a town will one day be raised.</p>
<p>"With reference to the direction of a line of road from this
station south-westerly to the Pass through the Dividing Range, I
observe that, in order to avoid the stony hills, among which my
outward bound course led me, on the eastern side of Mount Forbes,
the road should be conducted on a line drawn from the Limestone
Hills south-west, by compass, eighteen miles, which will not only
pass through an open country of slight undulation, in which one
bridge will be required to be thrown over a creek, but it will
extend fully to the valley along which I travelled north in my
return from the Pass, leaving Mount Forbes to the eastward: after
which it might be continued through this vale south to
Bainbrigge's Plain, at which may terminate the first stage.</p>
<p>"The road may then be carried on without the slightest
difficulty south twelve miles to the spot (distinctly marked on
chart), on which my tent stood on the 24th and 25th of August
last, and which may be readily recognised by an intersection of
the following bearings to points in the vicinity of the pass:
south head of Mount Mitchell, S. 37 W. magnetic; north head and
station on Mount Mitchell, S. 47½ W.; centre of Pass, W. 24 S.,
distant 2¾ miles; Mount Cordeaux, W. 35 S., distant three
miles.</p>
<p>"The particular spot being ascertained from which the above
bearings were taken, the forest ridge leading to the base of the
Pass will be immediately seen. In continuing the line of road
along the ridge little labour will be required, as the stones and
masses of rocks that lie in the way are detached, and may be
easily removed.</p>
<p>"In the formation of a practicable road through the last
quarter of a mile to the pitch of the Pass, the skill of the
practical engineer will be called into action. There are
abundance of materials of stone and large timber on the spot at
his command, and there is sufficient room to avoid the abrupt
face by which we ascended, by taking a sweep round so as to
intersect the wall of rocks further to the southward, and then by
tracing it northerly to the point at which it terminates in the
Pass.</p>
<p>"The passage through the Pass westerly to the head of Millar's
Valley requires simply the brush to be cut away, the construction
of a small bridge over a narrow water channel, and the ground
(otherwise quite level) smoothed, by a removal of some rounded
stones from the surface, which have evidently rolled down from
the overhanging heights. Although time was not afforded me to
trace Millar's Valley down to Darling Downs, still I feel fully
satisfied from the observations I made from Mount Mitchell that
no difficulty exists in the fall of the vale, which appeared in
every part exceedingly moderate. The distance from Darling Downs
to Brisbane Town by the nearest line of communication overland is
about seventy-seven miles; in consequence, however, of there
being a sufficiency of water in the Bremer to navigate small
craft of forty tons ten miles to the Limestone Hills, the land
carriage from the Western Downs is reduced by the above projected
line of road to sixty statute miles.</p>
<p>"An excursion made in September last (upon my return from the
Pass) from the Limestone Station, north to the channel of the
Brisbane, which I intersected in five miles at a point visited by
Mr. Oxley and myself in 1824 and which I clearly recognised, has
enabled me to connect most satisfactorily (as regards
geographical position) the westernmost point to which our late
very able Surveyor-General had penetrated on his second visit to
the Brisbane, with what I have now attempted to effect. The
tortuous course of the river is therefore carried on upon the
accompanying chart to that point.</p>
<p>"Beyond this spot the river was subsequently (in 1825) traced
up in a north-western direction by Major Lockyer, of which boat
excursion a notice appeared in a late number of <i>Wilton's
Quarterly Journal</i>. It is to be regretted that possessed of so
much zeal and perseverance, this gentleman had not provided
himself with the requisite instruments for the determination of
position of his several stations, and more particularly of the
extreme points, to which the means he possessed had enabled him
to reach. In latitude (which I am fully disposed to believe would
have placed him&mdash;had it been observed&mdash;considerably to
the southward of 27 deg. S.) would have been very important to
the geographer.</p>
<p>"Being thus aware that this excellent gentleman had no means
of ascertaining the geographical situation of this point, and as
he has not furnished us with a single bearing of any one known
fixed point, I have left the river just where my late friend Mr.
Oxley did, rather than add to it the trace of its channel by
Major Lockyer, which I observed marked on a badly engraved chart
of the colony recently published by Cross.</p>
<p>"I beg now to close this communication, which I have the
honour to lay before your Excellency, accompanied by a reduced
geographical sketch, and two plans of portions of the country
traversed: and I respectfully trust that your Excellency will
feel fully satisfied, upon a perusal of this report, that I have
endeavoured, to the utmost of my ability, to render perfect my
journey of the last year, overland from the colony, by carrying
on my sketch through the Dividing Range to the banks of the
Brisbane river and shores of Moreton Bay, and thus filling up the
map of the country by the very ample material collected in the
progress of my several excursions to the parallel of 28 deg.

<p>Thus, in the march of time, from the first glance which James
Cook&mdash;the very Triton among our British
sea-scourers&mdash;cast upon the outlines of Moreton Bay from the
deck of the "Endeavour", to the first grasp with which Allan
Cunningham reduced its interior wastes to enrolment among the
fixed places of the earth, in his progress of patient and
persevering exploration, steps forth into the first rank of
Australian forces the magnificent young recruit to the squatter's
phalanx&mdash;Darling Downs.</p>
<p>What suggestions for the future, what aspirations, what a glow
of success must have spurred Allan Cunningham's keen imagination,
while he crept upon the brilliant though distant view of the
plains of the upper Condamine river. What might be the fruit of
his discovery appears at once to have grafted itself upon his
hope; and doubtless, when he was grappling with natural
impediments to advancement, he collected to his eye many a
reflection of what the settled parts of this vast land had once
been, and had become in his own day. Never, however, could the
suspicion that time was already pregnant with coming events,
brought to the birth long ere this year 1887, grown, as their
facts are, to such marvellous stature in those till then unknown
regions, have dawned upon and dazed his, any, even the most
sanguine castle-building fancy.</p>
<p>Little could he have dreamt that the expanse he was gazing on,
decked with virgin beauty, would so soon be desecrated by the
iron tramp of a messenger and minister serving man by fire,
smoke, and shriek; one, indeed, he knew not of, which would
buffer with scorn the speed and endurance of the well-tried horse
which had borne him to this land of the golden fleece: which
would crush the clumsy dray, and efface every feature of rude
life (and of the world itself as he had looked upon it in his
days) from the sight and comprehension of Allan Cunningham: the
railroad!</p>
<p>But the season for reaping the fruits of Cunningham's
discoveries had not yet revolved. It took thirteen years for the
rare stalk on which he had grafted the first shoot of
civilization to bear even a bud: but then how rapid the
blossoming; how plenteous the harvest!</p>
<p>The circumstances of the times were combining in 1840 to
compel the squatters of the northern district into some more
genial climate. The cold winters were said to be a great drawback
to thorough success in sheep-breeding and fine wool-growing. Some
who had bought stations there were already seeking, and at times
finding purchasers for what dissatisfied themselves: albeit held
under the easy rent of an annual ten pound license&mdash;for
ever! as it seemed&mdash;with a small assessment upon their
stock.</p>
<p>Of course, New England was the district farthest north.
By-the-by, the term "squatter", as applied to the class which it
now designates, was not in vogue until two years after this.</p>
<p>Inquiry and discussion were at boiling point about the rivers
Clarence and Richmond: the country upon their banks was dubbed
unequalled; but alas! the difficulties of transit from the table
land were declared to be so grave, that many turned themselves to
other points of the compass.</p>
<p>There was Arthur Hodgson, who had sold his run of "Cashiobury"
to Todd and Fenwick, to which the same purchasers soon added the
adjoining station "Yarrowitch", hitherto occupied by the brothers
John and Francis Allman.</p>
<p>His name cannot escape mention, as he first showed those
symptoms of restlessness which, ere long, very generally
fermented.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go", was Arthur Hodgson's daily and nightly
vigil. With keen judgment he awaited the result of an exploring
journey which was then being made by the pioneer of Darling
Downs, whose name is still a household word among the regrets of
those who survive those good old days, whether yet nursing
existence among the same scenes or basking in England beneath the
sunshine of full-grown prosperity, of which the pastures of
Darling Downs had cradled the infancy.</p>
<p>Patrick Leslie, of Collaroi, in the district of Cassilis, New
South Wales, a little before this period had been much
"exercised" about looking for new country on which to depasture
sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>Active, energetic, prince of "bushmen" and good fellows, full
of "bush-fire", he was a man not likely to sit down satisfied
with the first thing he happened to meet with: one, who, under
the rowel of squatters' ambition, wanted the best of everything;
so he set about providing himself with the best run for stock to
which patience, perseverance, and pluck could help him. He was
well seconded by two estimable brothers. The one Scotch family,
of which he was a scion, had no small reason to be proud of its
representatives in the southern hemisphere. Well! Patrick
Leslie's notes must speak for themselves: no need to deprive them
of their characteristic syllables.</p>
<p>It must here be remarked that a volume had just (1877) made
its appearance at Melbourne, in which there was so much error in
regard to the early times of Moreton Bay and its environs, that
some newspaper hitting out soon warmed the question affecting the
accuracy of several statements respecting that district.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>Thus also did Patrick Leslie, thirteen years after Allan
Cunningham had let in first light upon one of Australia's
brightest scenes, usher in first life thereon, and by the
activity and work of life begin the development of the treasure
which Allan Cunningham had unearthed. So far man's Genesis of
Queensland.</p>
<p>But all was not <i>couleur de rose</i> to the struggling
squatter on Darling Downs and that limited pastoral area. Few
beyond the small circle of survivors are capable of weighing in
just scales the cost at which profit was, in some cases,
ultimately attained. The scarcity of labour, and, as a rule, its
despotic and insolent worthlessness; anxieties consequent upon
the hostility of the aboriginal tribes&mdash;anxieties the more
harassing when fears among the men became exaggerated to an
absurd extent by their own unreason and cowardice; the
consciousness that the sheep, and the very <i>modus vivendi</i>
were thus exposed to any and every outrage; the surfeit of debt,
may be, to some bank or Sydney merchant, at whose mercy the
squatter lay&mdash;and where the exception in those days now of
elation, now of depression?&mdash;with its burden sickening
effort of head and hand; the fall, so sudden and capricious, in
the marketable price of wool and stock; the dread of scab and
catarrh; the encroachment of some lazy loafer fresh from the
southward; in fact, forty and odd years ago the consciousness
that at any moment, he might be hoist on the petard of his own
venture, did not admit that rest to the brain, or that quiet
closing of the eyelid which, in all conditions,, should nurse
mind and body in health's service.</p>

Diary</span>.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sent to me, with remarks added on
Sutherlands's Book, in 1878, from Wartle, Auckland, New
Zealand.]</p>
<p>"Friday, the 21st of February, 1840.&mdash;Dr. John Dobie,
Walter Leslie and myself arrived at Falconer Plains, New England
(then in the occupation of Donald McIntyre) for the purpose of
trying to find a road down the Clarence river. We were
accompanied by two men; a convict named Peter Murphy, alias Duff,
per 'Countess of Harcourt', 1827, from Dublin, who was a
<i>lifer</i>, and assigned to me on the 9th of December, 1838. I
mention these particulars, as the man was about the best plucked
fellow I ever came across in my life, and as good a servant as
master ever had.</p>
<p>"To return to our subject. On the 22nd of February, Dobie,
Walter Leslie and I started from Falconer Plains with Peter
Murphy and one of McIntyre's men, named Crawford (Dobie's man
being left in charge of our spare horses), and proceeded towards
the Dividing Range between New England and the Clarence river;
spent four days in trying in vain to find a road, and returned to
go out to Darling Downs.</p>
<p>"Before leaving Sydney, I had heard from my old friend, Mr.
Allan Cunningham, the discoverer of Darling Downs, full
particulars of his journey out, and he most kindly offered me the
use of his map to assist me in my exploration, and wrote to my
old friend. Admiral King, who had such map, asking him to give it
to me to copy; but, unfortunately, Admiral King could not find
it, and I had therefore to manage as best I could. Admiral King
gave me the exact position of Ben Lomond, in New England, and
such was of great use to me as a starting point, and I worded in
day by day a sort of rough dead reckoning of my track as I went
along.</p>
<p>"In company with Peter Murphy only, I left Falconer Plains on
the 2nd of March, and staying a day or two at Beardy Plains, we
reached Garden and Bennett's station on the 8th of March. This
station was on a branch of the Severn river, some twenty or
thirty miles north of Beardy Plains, and at that time the
farthest out station to the north, on the east side of New
England.</p>
<p>"On the 10th of March I left Garden and Bennett's station, and
passing through much broken country, came on the 13th to a large
stream, on which, following it to its junction with a large
river, we encamped. This river was afterwards called the Mole
river, and the large river into which it emptied itself was the
Severn.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 14th of March, crossing the Severn
river, we came on the junction of a large stream nearly opposite
the junction of the Mole and Severn. This was afterwards called
Pike's creek. We followed this creek up a considerable distance
(encamping several nights). We crossed a range and made a large
creek, afterwards called Sandy creek, and following the valley
thereof, made the Darling Downs on the 20th of March, about four
miles above Toolburra. On the 20th and 21st of March explored up
the Condamine to Canning Downs, and crossing a ridge, came down
the (afterwards) Glengallan creek, and leaving the Downs about
five miles below Toolburra made south by Canal creek, Quart-pot
creek. McIntyre brook, Severn river, &amp;c., and on the 31st of
March made Cameron's station on Bannockburn Plains, and on the
4th of April came to Dobie's camp on Falconer's Plains; tried
hard to induce Dobie to follow us out to Darling Downs, but in
vain; he remained wedded to the Clarence.</p>
<p>"On the 12th of April Walter Leslie arrived at Dobie's camp,
with our sheep, drays, &amp;c., and encamped three miles up the
creek from Dobie's Camp.</p>
<p>"Our stock consisted of four thousand breeding ewes in lamb,
one hundred ewe hoggets, one thousand wedder hoggets, one hundred
rams, and five hundred wedders, three and four years old.</p>
<p>"We had two teams of bullocks, twenty-four in all, and two
drays, a team of horses and dray, and ten saddle horses.</p>
<p>"We had twenty-two men, all ticket-of-leave, or convicts, as
good and game a lot of men as ever existed, and who never
occasioned us a moment's trouble: worth any forty men I have ever
seen since.</p>
<p>"On Monday, the 14th of April, we started from Falconer's
Plains camp, and went on by easy stages by Beardy Plains,
Waterloo, Vivers, &amp;c., to McIntyre's station, at Byron
Plains, where we arrived on the 26th of April, and remained till
the 1st of May, on which day we came on to George Wyndham's
station, on what was supposed to be a branch of the McIntyre
River, the then farthest north station in New England (west
side.)</p>
<p>"On the 3rd of May we left Wyndham's, and I marked the first
tree of 'Leslie's marked-tree line', close to Wyndham's
stockyard; a blazed line was marked from this to 'Leslie's
crossing place', on the Condamine river, between Talgai and
Tummaville, and we arrived at the Condamine on Wednesday, the 4th
of June, without the loss of a single animal, or breaking a
bullock chain. On our outward route we kept as much as possible
on my tracks, when returning from the Downs in March.</p>
<p>"On the 6th of June, leaving all stock, drays, &amp;c., in
charge of the men, Walter Leslie, Peter Murphy and I left the
Condamine camp, and explored the country up the Condamine, by
Canning Downs, Killarney, Glengallan and Dalrymple creeks,
returning to camp on the 13th, and on the 14th moved up the
river, arriving at the junction of Sandy creek with the Condamine
on the 20th. Here we made a temporary camp, intended for our
first sheep station, and for the protection of men and stock,
made one station on the north bank of the river and two others
opposite&mdash;one on either side of Sandy creek, thus giving
mutual protection, and at the same time deep water between each
camp.</p>
<p>"From this camp, on the 21st of June, Walter, Murphy and I
struck across the Downs to the northward, and crossing by (what
is now) Allora, Spring creek. King's creek, Hodgson's creek, and
on to Gowrie and One Tree Hill, and finding nothing we liked as
much as Canning Downs, we returned as far as Glengallan creek,
and ran the Middle Gap creek up to Cunningham's 'Gap', crossed
it, following a creek down to the Bremer river, intending to go
on to Brisbane, but on second thoughts we feared going without
credentials, and re-crossing the 'Gap', we returned to our camp
on the 1st July, and next day we left the sheep at their
stations, and moved down some four miles to Toolburra, where we
formed our head station. We afterwards sold Toolburra to Gordon,
and formed the Canning Downs head station. We took up the country
from the bottom of Toolburra to the head of the Condamine,
including all tributaries. Afterwards we gave up what was
(afterwards) called Glengallan creek to the Campbells, and Fred
(Bracker) the German's creek and Sandy creek to the Aberdeen
Company.</p>
<p>"Well, to return to the 2nd July, we encamped the drays,
&amp;c., on the knoll on which Toolburra head station was
afterwards built, and, on the 7th July, I left Walter at
Toolburra, and making my way by our own marked tree line, I met
Dalrymple on the 9th, with our cattle, at Quart-pot creek; camped
the night with him, and next day I went on and made the Severn
river on the 12th. Found Cox had formed a cattle station since we
passed up. Stopped the night there, and having next morning made
Blaxland's station on Frazer's creek&mdash;also formed since we
passed up&mdash;on the 14th July came on to Wyndham's station,
where we commenced blazing our line on our way up (<em>vide</em>
3rd of May).</p>
<p>"On the 19th of July I reached a station belonging to Cash, of
New England, and having heard that Hodgson and Elliot were
encamped some three miles off. I made their camp and stayed the
night there. Hodgson was very unsettled as to whether he would go
to the Clarence or follow out my line to Darling Downs, but I had
no difficulty in persuading him to take the latter course; and I
told him of a fine country and how to reach it from Leslie's
crossing place at the Condamine.</p>
<p>"This country was Etonvale, to which he went straight.</p>
<p>"On Wednesday, the 22nd of July, I made the Peel, and spent
the night in the hospitable house of Charles Hall, the Australian
Agricultural Company's superintendent there, when I slept in a
bed for the first time since I left Garden and Bennett's on the
10th of March.</p>
<p>"On Monday, the 27th, I reached Maitland, and on the 28th went
down by steamer to Sydney.</p>
<p>"Hodgson must have reached the Darling Downs early in
September, being the first who went off on my line. We were the
only people on Darling Downs for fully three months, we arriving
on the 4th of June; Hodgson in September.</p>
<p>"I think King and Sibley were the next settlers; or probably
Isaac, who went out with Hodgson, may have selected Cowrie before
King and Sibley arrived. I am not sure of this, but if Isaac
selected before King and Sibley, the latter had their stock up
before Isaac.</p>
<p>"It was Frederick Isaac who went up with Hodgson.</p>
<p>"It is a fact beyond any doubt that the farthest northern
stations in New England, when I went out to the Downs, were
garden and Bennett's on the east side of New England, and George
Wyndham's station on the west side of the same district; and
drawing a line from Garden and Bennett's to Wyndham's, no
squatter had ever a hoof to the northward until we took ours.</p>
<p>"I believe no white man (but runaway convicts, and I believe
none such ever were on the Downs) ever set foot on Darling Downs
from the time Cunningham discovered them till I went there.</p>
<p>"As for any stations being formed before 1840, it is simple
rubbish.</p>
<p>"When our blacks became so far tamed as to hold communication
with us, they told us that the thing which terrified them most
(when they first saw me and Murphy four miles below Toolburra on
the 20th of March) was our dismounting, their full impression
being that man and horse was one animal. Is it likely such would
have been their impression had any white man ever been out on the
Downs, as the Messrs. Sutherland say?</p>
<p>"As to Warwick, it was never thought of till the end of 1847,
when Government instructed me to select a spot for the township
on the Condamine, below Canning Downs, and it must have been in
1848 when the first settlement took place.</p>
<p>"In 1847 George Leslie had a sheep station on the very spot
where Warwick now stands. I think it was in 1848 that the first
land sale was held. The Survey Office can give the date; and I
was the first man who bought a lot, being instigated to such
speculation, extending to £4, by a sawyer named John Russell, a
well-known character in those days, who, when the first lot was
put up, addressed me as follows: 'Come, Mr. Patrick Leslie, buy
the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; little lot for luck; you were the first
man here; be the first to buy.' And I bought it. This pretty well
settles the foundation of Warwick.</p>
<p>"If I remember rightly, Rolleston as C.C.L. had to approve of
the site for the town: he may remember if it was so. At first it
was named 'Canningtown', and we all objected to the name, and
Government changed it to 'Warwick' at our suggestion.</p>
<p>"Of the settlement of Drayton, and afterwards of Toowoomba,
you will know better neither one nor the other existed till long
after we were on the Downs. Why! in 1848 Drayton consisted of
Bill Horton's (the Fiver) public-house and a shanty or two, with
only one well for the <i>town</i>! and it was such a one, as to
get a bucket full of water, one had to go down with a pannikin
and bale it into the bucket I and a long time it took to fill a
bucket. I remember that at the time of the races, Toowoomba then
did not exist. If, as stated by the Messrs. Sutherland, there
were early settlers and early townships, where did they get their
supplies from? The penal settlement was a close one, and no one
could go there except by permission of the Government, and the
first supplies were mine and Hodgson's, which went there in 1840
under permits signed by the then Governor, Sir George Gipps. Even
if supplies could have been got from Brisbane, such could not
have been taken to the Downs, as we all know that no wheels ever
made could have crossed the Main Range, when we first went up
there. Cunningham's Gap on our side, and the old 'Hell-hole'
road, Drayton side, were the first roads, if they could be so
called, and they were cleared by us, Hodgson, and others.</p>
<p>"I see in your letters that the printer's devil has once or
twice put 1841 for 1840. It was the latter year I went out. On
September 9th I was 'spliced', and that is a day one don't
forget. My dates as given throughout are perfectly correct. I
would swear to any one of them, for my journal kept on my trips,
and written every day, is now before me.</p>
<p>"One pretty convincing proof that I was the first man who
settled on Darling Downs may be found in the following: when I
returned to Sydney at the end of July, 1840, the then Governor,
Sir George Gipps, sent for me, and obtained from me all the
information I could give him as to the Darling Downs, as well as
the unsettled districts between the outside New England stations
and the Downs. Sir George expressed himself much pleased at such
a large and fine area of a country being explored and settlement
commenced; and he asked me if there was anything he could do for
me. I told him I wanted nothing for myself, but that my companion
was an assigned servant, a convict for life, who had behaved
splendidly, and stood by me when attacked by the blacks, when
most men in his position would have run; and I asked Sir George
to grant him a ticket-of-leave, and the Governor said he would
not only do so, but also would recommend him for a conditional
pardon; and he did so, and Peter Murphy got his pardon
accordingly.</p>
<p>"If Darling Downs had been previously settled * Sir George
Gipps would never have acted as he did. If old Peter is alive now
he is pretty sure to be about Brisbane; a better servant or a
'gamer' man never was seen.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Messrs. Sutherland, in their <em>History of
Australia</em>, had published the following:&mdash;"After the
discoveries made by Allan Cunningham in <em>1835</em>"(!) "the
squatters of New South Wales had hastened northwards, in order to
depasture their flocks on the fine lands of the Darling Downs.
They founded many little towns, such as Ipswich, Drayton, and
Toowoomba; and when in <em>1829</em>"(!) "a pass leading across
the Dividing Range from the Darling Downs to Moreton Bay was
discovered by Cunningham the squatters on the west of the
mountains began to hold frequent communication with the
settlement of Moreton Bay, from which they obtained convicts to
act as shepherds on their runs."(!!) It is at this
incomprehensible statement that Mr. P. Leslie aims this abstract
of his diary.</p>
<p class="foot">In the <i>Queenslander</i> paper there appeared
in this year, 1878, the following notice among the
"Deaths":&mdash;"Murphy&mdash;On the 6th April, at Charters
Towers, Queensland, Peter Murphy, aged 72 years, native of
Dublin; came to the colony in 1819, and in 1839 he came overland
with Patrick Leslie from Collaroy, New England, to the Darling
Downs. They were the first two pioneers from New South Wales to
Queensland."</p>
<p class="foot">In this short notice there are three errors! 1819
should be 1827; 1839 should be 1840; and Collaroy was a farm
within the settled district of Cassilis, no small distance from
New England.!]</p>
<p>"When I was at Falconer's Plains, and about starting to look
for the Downs, Murphy was the only man I had with me, and not
liking to compel him (a convict) to accompany me, I told him what
my intentions were&mdash;viz., to go out to look for the Darling
Downs, and to take only one man with me, and I asked him if he
was willing to go, telling him I left it entirely to himself. He
looked at me, and said: "Go with you sir? I would go to with
you!" I said I did not intend to go there at present, but was
well pleased to have him to go out with me on my little
expedition. We had a pack-horse and a sheep-dog with us, and
carried biscuit and bacon, tea and sugar, trusting to our guns
for fresh meat, and lines and hooks for fish, and we lived
exceedingly well. We had a spare shirt and pair of trousers each,
and a single blanket.</p>
<p>"March, 1878."</p>
<p>"I cannot think what could have put it into Sutherland's brain
that the Downs country was settled in 1830. His quotation from
Pugh's book as to the flocks of the squatters following
Cunningham in three years is, I think, due to a misprint (in
Pugh's) of three for thirteen, for the latter would just make it
come out right: difference between 1827, Cunningham's time, and
1840, my year.</p>
<p>"The Downs settled in 1830! Why for seven long years after
that date there was not a hoof across the Liverpool Range.</p>
<p>"Well, you will be tired of my scribble, but so far as it has
gone it is gospel truth, and not one bit of it from memory: but
all from written dates.</p>
<p>"I will look with considerable pleasure to your knocking the
M.A.'s of some second or third rate university into a cocked
hat!</p>

<br>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">My</span> first trip out of Sydney was in
1840. Staying at Petty's Hotel&mdash;and an excellent hotel it
was&mdash;I felt lonely enough. I had long delivered or posted
letters from friends at home, but some mischance seemed to have
overtaken them. Why are my introductions to His Excellency Sir
George Gipps so manifestly ignored? Why do I not hear from Mr.
Boydell? His relatives in England earnestly asked me to make
myself known to him, confident that he would send me an
invitation to the Paterson. I was received very kindly by his
relatives at Woolloomooloo: hope I said nothing rude to the young
lady there&mdash;how handsome she was too!&mdash;who took me all
aback by asking me (the newest curiosity from fastidious
England), "What! really thought of her?" And the Bishop was very
kind: so was that dear old Major Barney at the point by the
waterside, and his delightful family. What can it mean that so
many others neglect to acknowledge my calling upon them? with
credentials too?</p>
<p>Thus perplexed, I sat in Petty's verandah and smoked: not a
pipe yet, however. "Well! that Aldis has good manillas! could not
get them in London like these. Hulloa! Who comes here? Surely I
know one of those faces." "Why, it can't be you!" "Yes, it is I,
but who are you?" "I am Pemberton Hodgson; my brother, Arthur, is
in Sydney too." How glad I was; I could recall the face I so well
knew when he was a boy at Harrow. I had never met his brother. We
soon got deep into question and answer, and were truly happy in
this rencontre. "I'm going up the country to New England," said
Arthur Hodgson to me a few days afterwards; "I've sold a station
there to Todd. Oh, you don't know Todd: quite a new chum. Will
you come with us?" He had been in the colony about eighteen
months, I think.</p>
<p>I was quite grateful for this chance of seeing something of
the country. "Got a horse, Russell?" "No; where can I get one?"
"Well, the only place decent in Sydney is Douglas and Sutton's."
"I will go at once; when do you start?" "Well, we have to go to
Maitland by a steamer at night, take our horses on board, find
ourselves probably at Newcastle in the morning for breakfast,
then up the river Hunter some miles, and land at Morpeth, saddle
up and take up our quarters at Cox's Hotel, East Maitland. Let's
see, we will say in a week." "I shall be delighted."</p>
<p>In England I had thought myself a fair judge of a good hack,
but here I was quite at a loss. Small the lot to select from;
blindfolded chances were as much in my favour for a choice as
they were with my eyes open. Whatever the brute seemed to be, the
price never varied. Sixty-five pounds! Such a rough no-paced,
hard-mouthed animal&mdash;horse but by name and nature&mdash;as
that which I could not help myself but by buying&mdash;and of all
colours black&mdash;took my appetite away for dinner on my return
to Petty's. "Oh, you can't get a good horse in Sydney," said
Hodgson, that evening; "all the best are in the bush." He was
right, I afterwards found. Well, where to get a saddle? "Oh, go
to Brown's, in George-street." And so to Brown's I went, and a
very excellent saddle on a Peate tree, and appurtenances, did Mr.
Brown, a capital fellow, supply me with. "But," said he, "you're
going up the country: you will want saddle-bags, and&mdash;let me
see&mdash;halters, spare girths, and so on." I had never seen
such stable belongings, but consented to be caparisoned
completely <i>en regle</i>.</p>
<p>"Well, I must call on the Major before leaving," thought I two
days after; so to Dawes' Battery Point, as it was called, went I.
I had ventured to pour my complaints into the ears of his truly
kind and amiable wife, by reason of the disappointment I had felt
at having been three times refused admittance at old Government
House. "It is very strange," she remarked, "I know Lady Gipps had
four letters, and told me some time ago that she was very sorry
that she had not seen you. Ah! there's a ring." I rose to leave,
but she requested me to remain until this visitor had gone. A
lady entered. "Oh! Lady Gipps," madame exclaimed, "allow me to
introduce Mr. Stuart Russell." "What!" ejaculated the visitor,
"were you the bearer of those letters from
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; some time ago?" "Yes; and I have
done myself the honour of calling three times since, but was
invariably refused admittance." "Oh, dear! I am so sorry; it has
been all a mistake; there was&mdash;well! one of your name whom I
declined to receive&mdash;I can't explain&mdash;but, orders had
been given&mdash;you must have been
supposed&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" "Not another word, I beg,
Lady Gipps," and flattered and consoled by the <i>denôuement</i>,
I made my grateful <i>congé</i>, wondering whether there were
many Russells at the antipodes! I soon found there were, to my
distress.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, then, Arthur, Pemberton Hodgson and
myself left Sydney, one evening, by a steamer&mdash;one of the
old Hunter River Company's&mdash;which started from a wharf at
the bottom of the hill at the back of Petty's.</p>
<p>Leaving Sydney, then, for the first time, I must, before
saying <i>au révoir</i> to it in these memoirs, tell what I
thought of the place I had arrived at some time before. There was
no getting alongside with a ship of nearly a thousand tons
measurement. Watermen's boats were plentiful, so I hailed one.
Once more on <i>terra firma</i>, after a passage of one hundred
and fifty-four days, I felt none of the elevation of spirits
which I had anticipated. I found myself unconsciously going away
from rather than to the town, which I could not see from the
landing place. The hot, sandy dust made walking very
disagreeable. It seemed to me when I did get into Sydney it was
but a long, dirty street, called George-street, which in fact was
the town. I could see no handsome buildings. There was a Post
Office, with some stone pillars which supported its porch
entrance. Buildings were rising but none seemed to be finished.
Most of the larger seemed to have been built in one governor's
time, L. Macquarie, for Government purposes. A new Government
House was being got up, as well as a new gaol. The present gaol
is in George-street,&mdash;not a nice place for hanging, I think,
being the thoroughfare. But they did hang, in profusion, for the
edification of passers-by. Hardly any places of public amusement:
an unclean theatre in Pitt-street (burnt down long ago), small
botanic, very incomplete, garden, the main feature in which was
one Norfolk Island pine tree. I speak of it as it was in my eyes
then: a mere lounge for a Sunday idler; and it did not extend
beyond a road which peremptorily cut it off from the water-side,
and so commanding no views of the beautiful harbour. The
Australian Club was decidedly the resort par excellence, but a
member then, as now, could not introduce a friend beyond the
strangers' room. The building had shortly before been a
hotel&mdash;The Pulteney. The great advantage of this&mdash;the
only club&mdash;was that it was frequented by the men most worth
meeting in the colony. There was a good billiard table and
accommodation. Here it was possible to live without being ruined,
which seemed to be out of the question at the hotels; or even, at
certain times, at any good lodgings, which were scarce. Decent
providings of existence&mdash;cooking, cleanliness, and
chambers&mdash;were most expensive, and there were few things,
except wine, to be had under double the price asked in England.
All trades, however, seemed to be particularly flourishing. Sheep
were being sold on all sides at thirty shillings and upwards,
herds of cattle from live pounds ten shillings up to eight
pounds, and nine pounds even; and, as to horses, nothing on four
legs&mdash;and out of the four, as a rule, two good legs could
not have been patched together,&mdash;under fifty pounds! Before
inquiring prices I soon found that I could rely upon a reply of
sixty-five!</p>
<p>Such was my <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> in 1840.</p>
<p>Horses, saddles, saddle-bags, hobbles and selves bundled
together on board a steam craft remarkable neither for size,
symmetry, sweetness, nor civility, nothing noteworthy affected us
in our night passage more intolerable than the smell and presence
of enormous cockroaches.* At Newcastle, which seemed to me but a
rock called Nobby; a breakwater created from the Nobby material;
an enormous glistening yellow mound which made one's eyes sore by
looking for the town; the semblance of a church built, alas! on
sand, we stopped awhile, then proceeded up a muddy uninteresting
river called the Hunter; disembarked in front of a public house,
called, I think, Anlaby's, at a filthy kind of platform, where we
saddled up and jogged on to East Maitland. There we took up our
quarters at Cox's Hotel; glad indeed to escape from the
cockroaches; counted twenty-three habitations on the way to it;
now saw a courthouse and was told there were barracks not far
off, called the "Stockade". "Who is that, Hodgson?" "As fine an
old gentleman as ever breathed; that's the P.M." ("How d'ye do,
Mr. Grant," <i>en passant</i>). They call him Paddy Grant.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A young lady passenger, within hearing, woke
me in the night with "Yes, mama! cockroaches! but only kings,
mama!"]</p>
<p>Well, at Cox's Hotel we were comfortable; saw many going to
and fro, who, I was told, had just come from New England. A good
deal of card and billiard playing that night in which I took no
hand; a good deal of noise too.</p>
<p>In the morning, as I was standing at the white gate in front,
one came riding in, who, I was told, was Major Lettsome. He
stared in a peculiarly offensive manner at a gentleman, who, I
found afterwards, bore the name of Boyd, close by with Arthur
Hodgson. "Did you see that, Hodgson?" he passionately cried out;
"that was an intentional insult! By &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
I'll have him out!" (And so he tried to do, and a great row
ensued, which did not come to an end till it reached the Supreme
Court, much to the Major's discredit.)</p>
<p>Dangerous country, thought I; better not see too well! From
Cox's through West Maitland; and there a nice little inn called
the "Rose" by Cohen; on by a road, which mile by mile lost the
semblance of a road; in fact it bore the distinction, I found,
only when supported on either side by fences, which by
confinement of traffic only made it the worse; on by such road, I
say, towards Patrick's Plains. "Here's Black Creek, Russell;
further on is Kesterton's Inn; but I must take you a little off
the road to see two nice old English gentlemen; very particular;
well, you are rather dusty; but you can go in by the back way,
you know, and you can ask the footman to brush you down before
coming in. Their names are Henry Hughes and Henry Isaac. This is
their farm; we must turn off here; that cottage out there is Dr.
Blick's, their next neighbour and medical attendant." We reached
the house, but in vain did I look for a back entrance; neither
did I see a front approach; the building was not imposing; I
looked diffidently for that scrupulous neatness about dwelling
and garden, the distinctive dress of old bachelordom, and saw it
not; hesitatingly I dropped behind; "Come on, old fellow!"
shouted Hodgson; "come on old Hodgson", shouted two voices
together from a low verandah, the utterers of which in so
cheerful tone drew my attention to two individuals seated, each
on a keg, smoking. Little, apparently, over twenty years of age;
covered with dust; shirt sleeves tucked up to the elbows; doubled
up by the heat of work; straw&mdash;I found they were called
"cabbage-tree"&mdash;hats, ribandless, and once perhaps of a
lighter tinge, heavy boots, which knew not blacking-brushes; each
with a silver tankard in hand, a short clay pipe in mouth, there
they stood laughing, as I, guileless of suspicion hitherto,
laughed with them in recognition of Hodgson's "merrie" jokes with
a new chum's initiation. And in one of these two, not long ago
borne to the rest of a good man and honoured name, I found in
after years the kindest and most valued friend I ever had.</p>
<p>A Mr. Colburne came in afterwards, likewise <i>en route</i>,
and a cheerful, joyous party we were when we all left the farm in
the afternoon and rode on to Patrick's Plains. I heard much
discussion about landholders on either side as we rode on,
especially of one "Bob Scott", of Glendon: of a family of the
name of Dangar, and many whom I cannot recall. Colburne was
riding a somewhat fretful animal, whose temper seemed to infect
my own black brute "Nigger". Colburne, I found, was also a "new
chum", wore strangely loose inexpressibles, inveighed perpetually
against the insect pests of this hot country, declared the pace
was slow and wearisome, would sit down awhile, and canter sharply
after us for a change. "I'll catch you directly, you go on." And
so we went on.</p>
<p>Presently I heard a shriek, looked back, and saw Colburne
furiously stripping himself. His ejaculations were in keeping
with his gesticulations. Bare legged in a moment, he danced like
a maniac, his alarmed horse throwing up his head in retreat,
dragged away at the reins, which Colburne was holding on by with
one hand, while he slapped and belaboured his natural limbs with
the other in the most demoniac manner. Horror-stricken at such
strange antics, "What on earth's the matter with Colburne."
Looking round, there, hardly able to sit on his saddle by reason
of the agony of amusement&mdash;Hodgson! "It's the old soldiers!"
he roared. "Old soldiers! why, where are they?" "Up his legs and
back," screamed Hodgson. "He's been sitting on a bed of
them!"</p>
<p>"Old soldiers" in a young country!</p>
<p>"I shall ride in breeches and boots", I logged down at once as
a rule for the future.</p>
<p>There were two inns at Patrick's Plains: Cullen's, at the end
of a dusty lane to the right; Singleton's, at the end of another
to the left of the track on which we were. Hodgson and the rest
to Cullen's; I to Singleton's, who had room but for one. I led my
"Nigger" to the stable and left him there; sat myself down in the
verandah to await their rejoining me. In a few minutes I was
tapped on the shoulder; looked up at the man who did it, rather
nettled. Didn't like his looks. "Is your name Russell?" "Yes."
"Henry?" "Yes." "I want you; here's my warrant. I arrest you,
Henry Russell, at the suit of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" But for
anger and amazement I could have laughed! "I wasn't in this
country at the date of that warrant." "Oh, that won't do for me.
You must come back to Sydney with me."</p>
<p>"Confound my name. I'll change it to&mdash;&mdash; Here comes
Hodgson."</p>
<p>Well, he being known sufficiently hereabouts, was able to
obtain my release from the hands of my disappointed captor.</p>
<p>On to Muswellbrook! That was the pleasant resting place for
pilgrims northward-ho! No small roadside inn, nor dwelling; ugly,
monotonous, up and down ridge ride all the way from Patrick's
Plains to Muswellbrook.</p>
<p>Hospitable, cheerful, revered Skellatar! Never to be
forgotten, joyous Bengalla, and all the delights inside and
outside of that dwelling! Nagoa; and its kindly, hearty master,
John Cox! Merton! Overton, and the gallant brothers who bore
their soldier-father's gallant name, Allman! St. Heliers! and all
the warmth of English hand-shaking, and heart-winning reception,
at the bidding of a fair and noble hostess; and the elf-like
considerateness of that bright-souled minister to the wants of
the bush pilgrims who passed that way&mdash;Aunty Bell! Truly St.
Heliers' house was a beehive of busy thoughts for the world's
weal around. There was a magnetic power within the magic environs
of Muswellbrook forty-seven years ago.</p>
<p>"We must get through to the Page to-day" as we left Nowland's
pleasant hostelrie, at Muswellbrook, a few days afterwards. I was
told that it was quite forty miles, and after the trial I had had
till then, looked at my "Nigger" in doubt and dismay. "Spurs are
used, that's a consolation, so see to it you 'Nigger'!"</p>
<p>Aberdeen! What, an Aberdeen! Here stood one house, and that a
public. And they call it Aberdeen. Why? I saw no dwelling but a
public-house. Ah, yes! there was a blacksmith's. All the country
round seemed to have been not long since in the hands of one man,
Potter McQueen, well known to have ruined himself years before by
contesting an election for Bedfordshire. I knew him in England;
last met him at dinner * at the old University Club,
Suffolk-street, London; known to have been the recipient of a
large grant of land&mdash;by grace private&mdash;in New South
Wales; he had then recently returned, in 1838. A question had
been raised, he told me, by the Downing-street authorities as to
the most practicable communication between Port Phillip and Van
Dieman's Land.** Committee of Inquiry summoned Potter McQueen to
give evidence, as he had been to Australia. In words tantamount
to the following, as he told it, the result was
amusing:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* He knew that I was on the point of going
out.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** July 23, 1840. (<i>Sydney Gazette</i>.)
"Ignorance relative to Australia." (Extract.) "I have myself seen
letters in the Sydney Post Office, from London,
addressed&mdash;A.B., Van Dieman's Land, Sydney." "It is not many
years since that an honourable M.P. gravely proposed to obviate
the expenses of a double government by throwing a chain bridge
from one colony to another, and the proposition excited no more
surprise than an allusion to the Menai. In Sicily and Italy I
have had great difficulty in showing that Van Dieman's Land was a
separate island, and maps not thirty years old have been procured
to prove my error."]</p>
<p>"When I entered the room, a plan seemed to have been proposed
and agreed upon before my coming in: and my opinion was desired
with a view to deciding the matter, and going to work at once.
Something like the old 'Leith smack' mail service thought I:
never dreamt of a steam service: there were but two little
steamboats about Sydney when I left, that I ever heard of: so I
waited, without any conception of my own to lay before them. I
hadn't to wait long: 'Mr. Potter McQueen, you will be kind enough
to join us here in our consultation: you know the desire to bring
together more closely that magnificent country, Van Dieman's
Land, with Port Phillip on the mainland of Australia. Now, here
is the map, which is doubtless faithful: the distance across this
water is the only separation, and is narrow enough to look at:
<i>it is proposed to throw a bridge across, don't you think it
can he done?</i>'"</p>
<p>And now I found myself on Potter McQueen's own grant! On to
"Scone:" a wayside there, too, "Chivers':" did'nt stop long: on
over Warland's Ranges&mdash;the first real rising ground I had
seen yet: a cut-throat sty a short way to the left was pointed
out to me, called "Northy's", just before we reached their foot:
down again on the other side, and so gladly (to my feelings, and
doubtless "Nigger's") we reached the one and the last
public-house of accommodation for travellers, which was lying so
snug on the confines of the settled land, beneath the frown of
Liverpool Range, on the banks of the river Page.</p>
<p>Pretty spot this on the river Page. There was a store
opposite, and post-office: all postal work on this road is done,
it seems, by horse: further back by mail cart and pair, one in
shafts and another traced to an outrigger.</p>
<p>Three miles next morning to the "Hanging Rock:" it and
Doughboy Hollow, in the heart of the range, became famous
afterwards for bushrangers more than once: especially through the
gallantry of that fine old soldier, Denny Day, at this time
police magistrate at Muswellbrook; afterwards at Maitland. Away
again from the range, merrily over champaign
country&mdash;Liverpool Plains&mdash;went smartly by Loder's
station: pulled up awhile at Paddy Davis'&mdash;the next
habitation, at Currabubula&mdash;(I recollect wondering how it
was to be spelt): pushed on to the river Peel, and were housed at
a station, the property by Crown grant of the Australian
Agricultural Company, by their manager and superintendent,
Charles Hall. He, the very prince of "open-door" hosts: ever
kind, ever considerate to wayfarers, who, by their number, the
frequency of their visits also, I afterwards found, their
exactions upon his larder&mdash;ever well supplied&mdash;their
invasion of his space, which ever seemed to yield like
india-rubber to the strain which the unconscionable company of
his visitors brought to bear upon his dwelling, must have been
endowed with special good humour, a marvellous gift of patience,
an immeasurable sympathy, an unbounded sensibility to the
elements of genuine <i>camaraderie</i>, to have borne with genial
unruffled mood at all times the burdens which he ever made so
light of, and the assaults upon his resources which he ever met
with the self-control and unselfish bearing of a very cavalier of
the "olden times."</p>
<p>I owe a tribute to the man who, in an after day, took me as a
helpless, apparently dying, sufferer beneath his roof, tended me,
nursed me&mdash;probably saved me&mdash;with all the gentleness
of a woman, big, bearded man as he was! and so sent me out again
with face northward-ho! a hale, sound, renewed, and grateful man.
I believe that he also has passed on and away from the earth: his
name&mdash;with a blessing on it&mdash;never from my heart while
I am here.</p>
<p>On our road then again, to the river Macdonald came we. Camped
on the river bank; out of cigars&mdash;compelled to smoke a pipe,
and that, too, with "Niggerhead"; for the first time I found the
smoking thereof rather strong; took to it, however, too much in
time.</p>
<p>"Here we are," next afternoon said Hodgson, "at
Salisbury&mdash;Bob McKenzie's. He's not here, though; he won't
go out of Sydney." (Became Sir Robert, dwelt on the Brisbane in
after years, and took his part in ministering to infant
Queensland.)</p>
<p>Bearing away from our course northwards next day, we made some
twenty miles of easting. Hodgson proposed having a pot of
tea&mdash;nothing but green in the country then&mdash;close to a
small, conical hill, which he called "Nobby", on our way. "What
do you think happened to me here nearly a year ago, Russell?"
"Can't say, really; perhaps a pot of tea." "Nothing half so
comfortable. I was alone, going, as we are, to Cashiobury,
jogging along and thinking; woke up at the sound of a horrid
voice, which said, 'Stand! or I fire.' My word, I did stand; even
my hair. I became conscious of looking right down the barrel of a
gun which a villainous looking fellow was coolly 'potting' me
with; out off my saddle to the ground like a lamplighter: so
quickly that the blackguard was gratified and laughed. That laugh
made me feel better. 'What do you want?' said I. 'Your horse,'
said he. 'Do take that gun down, I beg; now, like a good fellow,
take that gun down.' 'Oh, you're all right, I see,' said the
rascal, 'so you can jog on.' 'What will you do with him?' said I.
'Ride him till he's done up.' 'Now, my good sir,' said I, so
coaxingly; 'when he's knocked up will you do me the great
kindness of tying this card round his neck?' 'Well, I see no
objections; maybe I will.' He seemed quite amiable as he said so.
I had to stick the card in the saddle-flap. Walked on a hundred
yards; saw the brute mount mine; took off my hat and saluted him,
which he courteously reciprocated, dug his spurs into Beverley's
flanks, and here, when I came to myself, I stood, disgusted.
Well, it isn't far on to Denne's. I trudged on, and next morning
got to Cashiobury. Do you ever think I saw 'Beverley' again? Yes,
I did. The man&mdash;my first bushranger and 'sticking-up' was a
gentleman&mdash;rode him to a standstill; tied my card round his
neck. That card, 'Beverley' too, not many weeks after came back
to me. I say that fellow was a gentleman. <i>He was hung about
three months after</i>."</p>
<p>We called at the Messrs. Denne's station to-day, at which we
found two brothers, gentlemen from the county of Kent. The
buildings&mdash;all of slabs, split, covered with sheets of bark
stripped from the larger stringy-bark trees, I
understood&mdash;seemed to me to be more substantial and homely
than any I had yet observed since leaving the precincts of the
river Page. Sheep and wool were the only topics discussed, too,
since we entered into the more unsettled districts. They did not
vary here; in fact, the interest about both was intensified. I
heard much, too, which I as little understood respecting catarrh,
footrot, and sheep ailments, of which the climate, in the opinion
of most, was made to bear the odium. However to me, the weather
at this time was most delicious. The air of New England, which I
was told I had entered after crossing the river Macdonald, was,
to my senses at least, equal to that of the finest autumnal
breath of Old England. I could hope for nothing more enjoyable,
more healthful, more appetising, so I could not join in
condemning it because of the effects of the winter season on
sheep. But I had many a lesson to learn. Alighting at Cashiobury
in the evening, I was at once made known to the superintendent,
James Rogers (had heard a "Cocky Rogers" spoken of and joked
about on the road), and this I found was he&mdash;smart, lithe
little man; quite what I fancied must be a good "bushman",
keen-witted, cheerful, and with his eyes everywhere. He had not
been apprised of the sale, so Hodgson took him aside and told him
all about it. All was bustle and excitement, and our friend Todd,
Hodgson's "new chum", became full of inquiry and
inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>I had led for a long way a lame horse, at Hodgson's request,
which belonged to this "Cocky" Rogers, and much relieved I was to
give the brute up to his master. I made a mental vow that I would
never lead a lame or any horse again, unless someone rode behind
him with a persuasion thong.</p>
<p>"On the other side of that creek, Russell," said Hodgson, the
following day, as I was again training myself up in the
indulgence of "Niggerhead", "lies 'Yarrowitch', a station, which
belongs to those two good fellows whom you met at Muswellbrook,
the brothers John and Frank Allman, of Overton, but there is only
an overseer there at present."</p>
<p>The scenery was identical with almost all that I had yet
passed through: the method of life was the same as that of every
habitation I had yet entered: the green tea was always in the
same kind of quart-pot: the mutton chops were always fried: the
beef was always salt and boiled: the flour and water baked in a
large oval shape in red hot wood ashes, called "damper", always
equally hard and heavy: the sheet of bark, or canvas stretcher,
for sleeping on, always ricketty, and creaking at every change of
posture. Yet, to my wonderment, there were health, elation of
spirits, ogre's appetite, dreamless, vigour-renewing sleep,
sociability almost fraternal, sanguine hope, bright prospects,
energy of body and mind: and in many instances brought home to
the perceptions of a new chum&mdash;a standard of educational
attainments, and high-ranked acquirements, bred whether of
book-learning, or whether of busy, deep and earnest inquiry,
which seemed quite at variance with the visible means in this
bush supplied for the feeding of body and mind, which set me
a-thinking. To me, who had hitherto thought some attention to the
welfare of one's digestive powers requisite for cheerful spirits
and peaceful periods, it was a new light to find that salt beef
and damper, damper and salt beef, salt beef and
damper&mdash;three meals a day, differing but by name&mdash;ever
waited upon by the quart-pot satellite, green tea, in no wise
disturbed the "arcana" within, so sedulously guarded by our old
nurses at home. I could see no books, save "Youatt's Horse,
Sheep, and Cattle", volumes; yet digressions from those
invariable themes did at times betray knowledge and learning,
which displayed the talents and powers of the principals engaged
in discussion or controversy. The outward became to me at times a
startling contrast to the inner life of some individual
station-holders. Such instances may have been exceptional, but
they would come in view in unexpected and rude recesses of the
squatters' regions.</p>
<p>But, whether eating or arguing, all would end in the
inexorable smoke. "Come, old fellow, let's have a pipe," seemed
to be, <i>par excellence</i>, the end of all effort, whatever the
character thereof. At first, too, that "Niggerhead" would light
up my own, after sundry whiffs, until its lightness became
alarming. But these were results which, like the mosquitoes, only
assailed the "new chum", who, after his conventional seven years,
was emancipated, which meant acclimatised, like the surrounding
iron-bark trees. Quickly was Cashiobury made over to the hands of
Mr. Todd. Then came unceasing debates which ended in no decision,
as to "Shall we try the Clarence, or the Richmond?" or "get away
to the westward out of these cold winters?" "Why Boyd lost, I
hear, 1300 sheep by catarrh last winter! New England will never
do for me," exclaimed Hodgson, chewing his lips, a habit of his I
saw when in doubt. One morning he suddenly brought his fist down
on the table: "I'll wait for Pat. Leslie; he must be back by
this; I've heard why he has gone to the north, and he has good
hints to guide him. He's going to try to follow Cunningham's
line. By Jove, I'll find him out."</p>
<p>Having no part in this matter, and fearing too that, in such a
crisis of migration to&mdash;somewhere <i>in nubibus</i>&mdash;I
might be <i>de trop</i>, I resolved to go back to Sydney; and,
from what I had gleaned in this ride and the experiences of two
hundred and eighty miles, felt inclined to take steps towards
becoming a squatter myself.</p>
<p>And so, having started alone from Cashiobury with my two black
brutes, "Nigger" and "Undertaker", after wishing my kind-hearted,
cheery friend (does not Montaigne say that "the most manifest
sign of wisdom is cheerfulness?") and friends every success, with
every hope that we should meet again, I found myself in Sydney on
the 10th of May. It was Sunday. I can recollect having listened
to an excellent sermon from the Rev. Robert Allwood at the only
steepled church, St. James', on "the inconsistency of professed
Christians and the bad effects of the example they set in the
business of life." I had observed no churches&mdash;but the
semblance of one at Newcastle&mdash;out of Sydney.</p>

<br>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">There</span> is a house at the corner of
Macquarie-place, and what is now (1887) a northerly continuation
of the old part of Pitt-street, which not long ago was used as an
office by one division of the Department of Lands. A verandah,
supported by wooden pillars in 1840, abutted from over the first
floor windows. It has been removed many years since, I suppose,
for I saw the other day that it is being re-erected, but in
different fashion, with much plate-glass bedevilment.</p>
<p>In 1840 this was an excellent, almost the only good
boarding-house in Sydney. It was kept by a Mrs. Butler. Here, in
May, I took up my quarters; here I again met John Allman, who had
been appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands at Bathurst; here,
also, Owen Macdonald, brother of the esteemed Commissioner of
Crown Lands in New England; and Arthur Maister, who had a sheep
station in that district; was much gratified, in a few days, by
being introduced to that able, ill-used Dr. Bland; also to
Captain Stanley, in command then of H.M.S. "Britomart", son of
the, now late. Bishop of Norwich; Captain H.H. Brown, who lived
upon the North Shore, and seemed to be a kind of water police
magistrate, and illicit still detective.</p>
<p>I heard from Hodgson, whom Gilbert Elliot, Aide-de-Camp to Sir
G. Gipps, had joined in partnership. Found that he was at
Maitland, waiting to start his drays thence northwards, but was
detained by the state of the roads and the heavy rains. There was
a very pleasant ball at (old) Government House, being the Queen's
birthday. Invited, I went to it; late, or rather early, in the
morning I left with the last dancers. Close by were my lodgings;
to obtain re-admission seemed hopeless. Happy thought! I'll swarm
up one of those pillars into the verandah above! Hardly seven
feet from the ground a gruff voice challenged. "I've 'cotched'
you at it, have I! Come down, mate; it wont do! Come down, I
say!" "Policeman, by jove!" gasped I, shinning further up. He
made a spring, grabbed the tails of my best dress coat; he
tugged, I strained; crack went they from the very buttons; crash
went he on the hard bit of pavement supine: an oath and a
"rattle;" up sprang the sleepers within, and up jumped he; up
threw I one of the windows above, and launched myself into the
night-apparelled arms of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; A scream! a light!
an imprecation! I fled, and left my tails in custody!</p>
<p>Sydney was a very pleasant place in 1840. Visits to be paid,
and so paid, were pleasant passages in one's daily
<i>devoir</i>.</p>
<p>The result of one to which I gladly fled&mdash;perhaps ashamed
of my loss, like the fabled fox&mdash;the day after the constable
had misappropriated my coat tails, recalled me to a sense of the
burden which I bore about me in the lack of my individualization.
I had fumed over the unproductive effort in my behalf that the
letters&mdash;of course letters of introduction from
England&mdash;had made, which I had posted in the early part of
the year. After that one <i>denouement</i> at Major Barney's,
deafness to pleadings of such kindly calls through the
letter-box, caused me no further chagrin on the reflection that
Smith, Jones and Robinson had suffered more for their names'
sakes than I had ever done.</p>
<p>To the one of some half-dozen residences kept apart, one from
the other, by a scrubby wilderness in the heights of
Woolloomooloo, which was called Brougham Lodge, that of the Chief
Justice, I hied me. Being admitted, I found but the two estimable
young ladies at home, the dominant senora being indisposed. "How
did you like the Patterson? You've made a long visit, Mr.
Russell," made me stare. "The Patterson! where's the Patterson?"
"Why, haven't you been there ever since you left Sydney?" "No,
indeed; I have been to New England, and come back again; but
where's the Patterson?" That there was a puzzle was plain; what
it was, not plain at all. Almost nettled at a silence which
seemed to emphasize little belief in what I had said, I asked
again. And at the moment I had again to bow gratefully to a
coincidence similar to that on the former occasion&mdash;Mr.
Boydell, of the river Patterson, walked in; young ladies greeted
him as "Uncle John", I think, but am not sure to this day whether
such relationship existed&mdash;looking shyly at him and me;
"Here is Mr. Russell; this is Mr. Boydell"&mdash;but we were
utter strangers! I must divest my present pen of that past
explanation, and give it in a few syllables. It gave me many an
after laugh, the faint echo of that with which it was greeted
before I left.</p>
<p>I had enclosed the home letter with a few lines from myself to
Mr. Boydell: had left Petty's, when a reply&mdash;a most kind one
too, asking me to come and stay as long as I liked&mdash;had been
brought: returned on delivery, but endorsed "Try H.R. of some
other place:" got into the hands of one of my name, steward of a
Hunter's river steamer: he would not adapt himself to its
friendly contents: and so the kind letter passed on, "tried" by
many of the same brand, the last of whom had taken advantage of
it, and accepted <i>my</i> invitation; was received as my
identity for many long weeks, which had strangely escaped every
test: made himself peculiarly objectionable to my indulgent host
on my account: and so <i>I</i> had been turned out of the doors
of the well-known mansion on the river Paterson: and now,
forsooth, had come to air myself with prim and demure bearing in
the good graces of the charitable folks of Sydney.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, wishing to compare the country south of
Sydney with that which I had seen to the north, I started with
Macdonald on a ride to a river called the Codradigbee, or Little
river. He had purchased a station, with sheep, in that quarter,
and was going to take delivery, reversing the object of my ride
with Hodgson to New England. I was told it was about thirty miles
beyond the town of Yass, fourteen beyond the Murrumbidgee, a
river of which I had heard much in England, from glowing
descriptions given me by the late Sir Thomas (then Major)
Mitchell. (He had been summoned to England that he might assist
the unhappy Colonel Gurwood in compiling the memorable
"Peninsular War Despatches", and in London I had met him and his
family.)</p>
<p>Two "new chums" starting from Sydney for an unknown station on
a queer named river! I was the "old chum" now. Macdonald's first
ride in Australia! With the intention of staying that night at
Parramatta, at which, we were assured, we should find the
<i>crême de la crême</i> of good accommodation at the "Red Cow",
kept by Mrs. Walker (I think that was her name)&mdash;of course
we took the wrong road, and evening brought us to an inn kept by
Solomon. A sofa and debauched-looking blanket gave me all the
rest that fleas and bugs would, in small pity, grant. Hoping to
leave such civilisation parasites behind, passed on to Dunston's
Inn, Stonequarry, after crossing Razorback&mdash;wondrous scenery
in peeps; but never wished to cross it again. Berrima next
day&mdash;good quiet resting-place at Berrima, the
"Surveyor-General", Mrs. Ann Richards. Met Bishop Broughton. Have
seen nothing yet comparable, in my opinion, to New England. Got
to an inn called "Joe Peters'", but its name and that of the
locality I cannot remember. Jogged on to Goulburn thence, about
eighteen miles. At Liverpool I had stayed with Solomon; here with
"Moses", who let me in for a horse. (On my return I gave Moses
£20 to take the animal back again, <i>i.e</i>., on return of the
balance of my purchase money, £65! Even thought him then "a
brick!") "There's an inn, Macdonald! The name is Bond. I'm glad
it isn't Samuel or Abraham." So there we stayed in Gunning the
following night, and very cold it was. Yass received us next day,
and there we saw a gaol and a courthouse. Little else, besides
the wayside verandah, we entered, which I read was the "Rose
Inn", Middleton; and here we were attended to by a positively
civil, good fellow of a waiter. Hoping to reach our destination
in the evening, we started early for the Little river, <i>en
route</i> through the one Yass road, and having called upon a
Captain Macdonald, a friend of my <i>compagnon de voyage</i>
suddenly pulled up. "Why surely we have been here before! "And so
we had, We were going as fast as we could, back to Sydney, turned
and were launched upon the right track across a plain; and of
course continually got on a wrong one. Suddenly saw a broad
river; on its banks a hut. This, then, was the Murrumbidgee; so
said a gentleman who came out of the hut, who informed us that
his name was Sharp, and that we were some five miles out of our
course, and he&mdash;good fellow that he was&mdash;made us stop
for the night; and verily made us comfortable with his hearty
welcome. His farm&mdash;he called it one&mdash;was the snuggest I
had seen; three large paddocks under excellent cultivation; all
wheat, but complained of "smut". The river&mdash;more worthy the
name than any stream I had yet approached, was full of wild fowl
and black swans. How I did crave for a day's shooting. Fish no
end: the blacks dived for and so caught them. Sharp work! Sixty
feet in breadth and evidently very deep. In the evening a Mr.
Ferguson&mdash;new chum&mdash;staying here, came in, and a most
agreeable <i>symposium</i>&mdash;tea&mdash;had we.</p>
<p>More careful next day, we went as the crow flies; came to
another range; higher than Liverpool Range&mdash;which bore the
name of "Cookmundoon" as far as I could gather it. Up, over, down
into a valley of no beauty; a small watercourse running through.
"There's something, Macdonald!" It was a hut, and my foreboding
spirit sank at the thought, "is this our station?" Up we rode;
dirty man and sulky came out. "Is
this&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?" asked Macdonald. "Yes." "Where
are the sheep?" "Whoay thereabouts" denoting the direction with a
hoist of his right boot." "Is there an overseer?" "There be'ant
any but Dick and I." "Where's Dick?" "Along a' the sheep." "Well,
I have bought this place, and must stop hereto-night." "There
be'ant noa sugar, and noa tea; there be a bit o' damper; but the
cask be near out. Dick don't get nothin till to-morrow." Pleasant
lookout, thought I. "What shall we do now?" "Hobble our horses,
and go to see the sheep, if you don't mind the walk." We soon
found the sheep; also the man Dick; a chirpy little man, very
much unlike any shepherd I had seen yet. They all seemed to be
dull, cumbersome and witless. "Be you the gentleman as has bought
this 'ere lot?" "Yes." "Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; came over
a week agone, and said they were sold, and that the gen'leman as
had bought 'em would pay wages from this 'ere coming week." "All
right, my man," said we, "but tell me about your
sheep,&mdash;these are ewes, I see." "Yes; there they be; five
hundred and twenty-seven to the head, as given in my charge last
month. Two miles down the creek is a flock of lambs, in all five
hundred and nineteen; look well, doant they?" "Yes," said
Macdonald, his face less gloomy and anxious, "but that is not the
full number; where are the wethers?" "They be with the lambs;
but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; "Well, what?" "Have you bought these
'ere hout-an-hout?" "Yes." "Well, its no fault o' mine, they're
all&mdash;that be the ewes, all rotten." Poor Macdonald! neither
of us knew what "rotten" sheep were, but it was the climax of his
trouble. He had bought sheep and station at Sam Lyons' auction
rooms.</p>
<p>Cold as it was, I preferred a bed outside that kennel; next
day, finding that I could be of no service in any shape, I said
good-bye, and away for Sydney. We never met again.</p>
<p>Lost myself; got ten miles off my road to Yass; found a place
called Cavan, Major Lockyer's: strayed again upon a plain till it
was dark, cold, and miserable. "Well, the back must be warmer
than the saddle," it struck me; so I took my saddle off my
horse's and put it on my own. "There's no means of seeing or
feeling my way, no moon, no stars; perhaps the brute knows better
than his burden; I'll try." So I took the bit out of his mouth,
jumped on his warm hide, and dug spurs into him. The "Nigger"
seemed surprised into life, slewed himself right round, and
before long I found myself suddenly among trees, at some distance
a fire, and&mdash;by jove! dogs barking, and cattle bellowing! At
the fire I jumped off joyously, saw a man squatted on the other
side, looking the picture of what is underlined "brigand". Pipe
in mouth, he ejaculated, "Hallo! where do you hail from?" "I've
lost myself on the way to Yass": "and I've lost myself with
cattle on the way to Port Phillip, on Faithful's track." I began
to explain myself, when he nearly floored me with an imprecation
and a shout&mdash;"Why &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;what are you
doing here, Russell? Well! this is a land of marvels." "Who
<em>can you</em> be?" "What! don't you remember Hallett, of
Oriel? nearly four years ago we went to Ascot together; I
returned to Oxford that night, and was rusticated at <i>tempus
infinitum</i>. Why and how I find myself here I'll say
by-and-bye. You've knocked the breath out of my body! What
wondrous chance brought you to the antipodes?"</p>
<p>Very small the amount of sleep that night. By daylight we
found ourselves ten miles out of the way, near an inn kept by a
man of the name of Davis. I made way to Yass: found a case going
on at the court-house, McDermot v. Lowe. Met a Mr. Burnard, and a
Dr. Hely: got on to Gunning wet through: and so day by day
through mud and water to Sydney by the 18th. Found Arthur Hodgson
there: he had with thoughtful kindness bought some sheep for me:
"Take them or not; all the same to me, old fellow:" and I did not
take them. Went with him to Dawes' Point that evening, and passed
it gaily by the fireside of that united family of the gallant
major's.</p>
<p>I had taken the names of all the roadside inns as far as
Stonequarry, on my return from Yass. Amusing to compare the state
of then with now on that same track. I must give the list: Yass
to Grosvenor's Inn: thence to one on Breadalbane Plains, the only
dwelling in sight; Moses, and McKeller's, at Goulburn: thence to
Joe Peters': thence to Paddy's River Inn: on to Gray's Inn: then
passing an inn on the left to Berrima: ten miles on to Cutter's
"Kangaroo Inn", "Bargo Tavern", Sharker's "Woolpack", Jones'
"Cross Keys", Lupton's "Woolpack", Crispe's "Traveller's Inn;"
and then Dunsdon's Inn at Stonequarry.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> morning of the 22nd of this
month&mdash;June, 1840&mdash;the morning of our gracious Queen's
marriage! in the evening thereof, and in a very deluge of rain, I
was on board the H.R.S.N. Company's steamer which bore her
revered name "Victoria", passenger for Maitland.</p>
<p>Word had by some means been received of Patrick Leslie;
stationless sheep owners were on the <i>qui vive</i>! He had
already taken up magnificent country, it was said, on Darling
Downs; years before seen at a distance by Allan Cunningham, and
by him mapped and named! Moreton Bay not more than a hundred
miles away for a shipping port! For what Patrick Leslie had done,
and was doing at this time, I must refer the inquirer to his own
diary. I will not poach on his plantation.</p>
<p>The night of that passage by the "Victoria" was dark, rainy
and cold, but we did reach Newcastle by five the next morning,
stuck fast in the mud flats about a mile higher up; detained
there until mid-day, we did not reach Morpeth until three
o'clock. At Cox's again, of course, with old Oxford friends,
Henry and Alfred Denison; there also their particular friend,
Edward Hamilton, the latter of Cambridge, who was busy preparing
his drays for a start to his recent purchase, Collaroi. I helped
Hamilton next day, went with Henry Denison to buy a horse from
Cutts, and returned to Cox's, having decided to await Hodgson's
arrival from Sydney, and then share with him the fun of seeking a
new country to the northward&mdash;fit for sheep in all
respects.</p>
<p>On the 26th, Hodgson and Elliot arrived from Sydney: with them
Frank Forbes, Skellatar's eldest son. Forbes and Elliott slept
under Archibald Bell's, Hodgson and I under Ferriter's ever
hospitable roofs.</p>
<p>Poor Forbes was driving tandem! What a mess he made of it! We
all met again at Patrick's Plains&mdash;scene of my
arrest&mdash;the next day, and were again dispersed according to
our several inclinations. Elliot stopped with a lame horse:
Forbes off to the warm welcome ready for him, on the threshold of
the door ever held open to friends or foreigners by the genial
and generous owner of the land which commemorates his name on the
banks of Glennie's creek: Hodgson and I to the stately but
friendly walls of Ravensworth, lord of which was Dr. Bowman.
Close on the heels of his son and tandem, on! next morning to Sir
Francis Forbes' charming "Skellatar": and after a glorious
breakfast, the round of happy visits within the social ring,
which encompassed the well-known village of Muswellbrook as with
a halo of beaming smiles.</p>
<p>But rest was not durable for such as we were. Away to the
Page! must look in at those fine specimens of English country
gentlemen, Darby and Goldfinch, on the way. Hie! on over
Liverpool Range again, and thus walking, jogging, cantering akin
to galloping suddenly came we on drays camped close to Loder's.
"I'll be hanged! if these are not Allan Macpherson's," said
someone. "How are you, Macpherson," cried Hodgson, "bound
northwards, eh?" "Yes, old fellow! but not your way, I suspect."
"You have heavy loads." "Yes, I'm not going to live like a
savage: but come in to my tent: have some brandy and water."
"Gladly", was the cry.</p>
<p>In we went. "Sleep here all of you, to-night, hobble your
horses; lots of grass; won't go far; come now, say yes; I'm
miserable. I can't leave my tent for an hour but these ruffians
of mine spring my plant and drink my brandy; and now they're all
so ill that I can get nothing done; have to do all the work
myself!" "Why, how's that? what makes them ill? Ague?" "No,
tartar emetic", and he threw off his look of distress and roared
aloud; we joined in and passed the night merrily; but not a man
could stir to work, and so we helped, and there was no damage
done. "I'll tell you all about it; wherever I planted my
brandy&mdash;except what I get out, they can't get at&mdash;they
were sure to find it. I put in a precious dose this morning,
thinking to detect the scamp; but, by Jove, the're <i>all</i>
bad. I must have men. I can't discharge 'em all! No! I'm not
going into the bush like a savage! I have a good cellar, a piano,
cigars, <i>eau de cologne</i>, scented soap,"&mdash;and we
dropped off, one by one, into a snooze till the sun rose.</p>
<p>Some weeks afterwards Macpherson and his drays were stopped by
bushrangers, who tried to drink the <i>eau de cologne</i> and eat
the scented soap. The cellar suffered, but they didn't try the
piano. Next day passed through the gap of a range, called, to a
new chum's discomfiture, Currabubula; and spurred on to the scene
to which the lessening distance, mile by mile, added much of
gladness, as we approached again the Good Samaritan who dwelt at
Killala&mdash;Charles Hall.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July we found Pemberton Hodgson with the drays
camped upon the head of the Peel, close by store and a tent. In
the former I made the acquaintance of an old gentleman of the
name of Stubbs, whose fair wife&mdash;like many mothers in same
case&mdash;was bemoaning the delay of her son's arrival from
England. In the latter, was introduced to a Mr. Irving, late
lieutenant of the 28th Regiment, a detachment of which had been
quartered at Port Stephens or Macquarie, I forget which. The
store was a matter of partnership, "Stubbs and Irving." Why an
officer of a crack regiment should prefer holding office in a
"bush store "and give up the music of life in a gay and gallant
service, for the hideous discord of laughing jackasses and
screaming cockatoos, puzzled me. Slept under a dray: my first
submission to lying beneath a bed rather than on it; jumped up in
the night and treated my head badly, by a knock against the axle;
the morning found me in excruciating pain, all over.</p>
<p>My kind friends took me back to Killala. It was on this
occasion that I met with those guardian services&mdash;rendered
in so gentle and chivalrous a spirit&mdash;at the hands of that
true model of a Christian practitioner&mdash;Charles
Hall,&mdash;to which I have already alluded.</p>
<p>From the morning of the 5th of July until the 20th I was for
the most part unconscious; but I could feel at times the presence
of some helping and ministering hand, and hear a low voice, to
which I could make no sign with my lips. J did not know where I
was. My head seemed ever growing to make room for further growth
of bursting and again bursting spasms. One thing I do recollect.
I heard a strange footstep one day; was aware of some pacing
round about me; could hear, by-and-by, loud talking in the
adjoining room. "Poor fellow! I shall be back in a few days from
Muswellbrook, Hall; I will come and see where you have buried
him."</p>
<p>From the 20th, when I became, comparatively speaking, myself
again, until the 27th of the following October&mdash;a date I
logged down&mdash;I can recall little that can exercise my pen,
of which even an indulgent person would take heed; in the record
of that little, however, lies a very insufficient discharge of
many a debt of grateful acknowledgment&mdash;to some&mdash;many
of whom (are there any?) can never know the impression upon my
memory of their unswerving friendliness and fellowship.</p>
<p>Elliot had returned from Muswellbrook, <i>en route</i>
northwards after Arthur Hodgson and the drays. Pemberton Hodgson
had left the drays and passed by again, Sydney-wards. I made an
attempt to jog on with my face to the north, but on reaching the
Macdonald lost my own horses, and was too weak to look for them
or to proceed. And so, having a mare of Hodgson's which Elliot
had left behind, returned to dear old Hall, in company with two
new made acquaintances, Dalzell and Milne both going down,
<i>i.e</i>. to Sydney, reversing the usual term to the
metropolis. A Mr. Rusden had started from Killala one morning for
Maitland, and I pursued but did not catch him. Myself camped at
Currabubula in a terrific storm; got on to Forbes' station,
Werris' creek, drenched and disfigured. (Found there an excellent
fellow as overseer&mdash;McCullum, I think.) The mare had
slipped, fallen, and deliberately rolled over me in a mud pool.
Back on the old track, was kindly received at St. Aubin's, near
Scone, and breakfasted. The gallant owner of all this land.
Captain Dumaresq, rode with me, on my way, as far as St.
Heliers'. Slept at Muswellbrook, where I fell in with Denny Day
and Frank Allman; and we were joined by Frank Forbes. (Dead long
since. One whose qualities of head and heart were never worthily
appreciated.)</p>
<p>Thinking to make another effort to follow up Hodgson and
Elliot, I resolved to recruit health and strength in these
pleasant purlieus of the spot I have learnt to like best; would
await Pemberton Hodgson's return from Sydney and <i>eo
volente</i>, ride on with him and reach the reported paradise in
the far north. So what between Bengalla's sweet homestead; its
talented master's ready wit; races on the course in front, flat
and hurdle; pig-sticking; (he had been long an officer in a
cavalry corps in India); paying excusable attention to any and
every fair face in the bright neighbourhood; what with mooning
about from one warm-hearted host and hostess to another within a
circle of some ten miles all round, the days passed very, very
happily, and my returning strength stepped out sturdily with
them.</p>
<p>Often had I almost made up my mind to push on towards these
Darling Downs alone; but, being a new chum, many remonstrances
prevailed, and there I lingered doubting,&mdash;enveloped by the
excuses of my inclinations.</p>
<p>One fine morning it came to my ears from New England way that
Pemberton Hodgson had passed by, knowing nothing of my plans or
wishes. Short was the time it took me to throw saddle on and leg
over it; and away I went till I met a true type of the great name
of Magnus McLeod, from New England, who said that he whom I was
pursuing by land had gone up to Moreton Bay by sea, where he
hoped to meet his brother Arthur.</p>
<p>Back again, inconsolable, until my gloom was utterly routed by
paying a visit to St. Heliers' on the way home. An enchanting
proprietress herself in the midst of her throng, her brother
Butler, and two young ladies of the name of Reece, Miss Mathers,
the ever bright and charming Aunty Bell, and some sweet
children.</p>
<p>On the 17th of August a letter from Pemberton Hodgson, in
Sydney. From the Australian Club: "I want to see you; pray come
down." Went at once, but he met me at Maitland. We returned
together to Sydney on business, and found ourselves back again
within the week at Cox's.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until the evening of Wednesday, the 28th
of September, that I had reason to feel confident that I should
succeed in making a final start to the north. I had had occasion
to pay Sydney yet another visit, and was now <em>en route</em>.
Dined that evening at Cox's hotel with Henry Denison and "Paddy"
Grant; a trio, two of whom have rarely been excelled, I should
think, in conversational and generally entertaining powers. [Dear
Henry Denison! he dined with me at Brighton, in England, in 1857,
and died a few days afterwards.]</p>
<p>On the 30th Pemberton Hodgson had gone on from Muswellbrook
with one of two men&mdash;Foster&mdash;who had been overseer of
Allman's sheep station, Yarrowitch, and a pack horse. The
following day with the other of the twain&mdash;John&mdash;(poor
fellow! he was afterwards killed by the blacks at Etonvale) I
caught up Pemberton Hodgson three miles before arrival at the
Page, (the inn had been till then kept by "Tinker" Campbell, who
became shortly afterwards a station-holder on Darling Downs), Did
not stop at the inn: proceeded and camped at the Hanging Rock.
The 'possums made sleeping out of the question: but then I found
in the morning that I had been lying on an ant-hill: not,
however, one of old soldiers. On to Loder's: met Denny Day:
pushed on through Currabubula to the Peel: of course paid Killala
a visit: Hall absent; but his French cook, Louis, tended us, fed
us, did for us <i>en prince</i>.</p>
<p>Having bought two kangaroo dogs and a bull-dog, seen to arms
and ammunition, reached the Macdonald on the 9th of October:
picked up two travellers on our own course, a Cameron and a
McAllman: at Ross' hut by the riverside, George Gammie with a
dray&mdash;all for the north. Passing Salisbury, went out of the
way to pay a visit to "Jock" Maclean, of Bergen-op-zoom. Back to
Turner&mdash;manager for Robert Mackenzie at Salisbury&mdash;got
on to Armidale, and there found the estimable and courteous
gentleman whose functions were those of Commissioner of Crown
Lands for New England. George Macdonald, whose brother I had
accompanied beyond Yass.</p>
<p>Here we met a son of Sir Maurice O'Connell,
Commander-in-Chief, in Sydney. (He became President of the
Queensland Council Chamber in after times, and died at Brisbane.)
He invited us to his station, which proved to be beautifully
situated on a running stream. Became acquainted with his friend
and superintendent, Captain Park, and enjoyed ourselves much,
shooting and so on.</p>
<p>On the 18th October, reached Cash's station, near which we
camped on the river Bundarrah: on thence to Cameron's cattle
station, and by the evening to Clark and Ranken's on the same
river, and camped on the 20th near an out station of Peter
Mclntyre's.</p>
<p>On the 20th, from a low range which we were crossing over, we
had the first peep of the country through which our course lay;
extending in one uninteresting plateau on all sides till lost on
the horizon: apparently thickly wooded: bright spots in one
direction showing forth "Byron Plains". By the evening we reached
Wyndham's, from which station began Patrick Leslie's labour in a
marked line for the guidance of his drays, and those who
followed. Quoting his diary, now we know that he on the 3rd of
May last "left Wyndham's and marked the first tree of 'Leslie's
marked-tree line' close to Wyndham's stockyard: a blazed line was
marked from this to 'Leslie's crossing-place on the Condamine.'
"On hence to Gregory Blaxland's cattle station on Fraser's Creek,
on the 22nd evening. The "marked-tree line" had been taken to the
back of this station: we picked it up next morning on the other
side of the creek at George Gammie's station. (In after years
this Gammie changed his name to Maitland. I saw him in
Warwickshire&mdash;at Rugby&mdash;in 1875. Unconscious of giving
offence, I named him Gammie; but he was not Gammie.)</p>
<p>On the 23rd made the Severn, alias "Sovereign" among
stock-keepers, but which is the river Dumaresq; went off to the
right to a cattle station belonging to my friend John Cox, of
Nagoa, Muswellbrook. Here we were supplied with the best that the
keen-eyed and kindly attentive stock-keeper, whose name was
William Orton ("Bill" among his brotherhood&mdash;"The Fiver" on
the river, and surrounding occupied country), could supply us
with,&mdash;eggs, milk, butter, which were indeed, to us,
luxuries.</p>
<p>The Severn is broad and deep in parts here, and at this time
was infested by blacks. Just before our arrival they had attacked
John McDougal's station, not far from this, driven off the
cattle, killed one man, seriously wounding another with a spear,
and committed other depredations.</p>
<p>I took a liking to Bill, "The Fiver", and found that he could
wile away the time very pleasantly with bush yarns, and his own
narrow escapes from the "darkies", and their treachery. He was a
great authority among his mates in most matters; his features
spoke of great determination. His natural endowments showed me
that under happier circumstances in earlier life, he might have
made his mark creditably at least, anywhere. Now who was "Bill
the Fiver"? (called "The Fiver" by reason of his "luck" in a bush
game at cards, in which the number "five" somehow meant winning.)
Well, his story was painful. I verified it years afterwards on
visiting England. Bill had been a convicted felon at the age of
thirteen. Convicted of having ran away from a cruel stepmother;
convicted at thirteen of having fallen among evil associates,
who, much older than himself, had utilised him for stealing a
coat for their own behoof; he, almost unconscious of guilty
intention. And so, at thirteen he was sent off amongst forgers,
burglars, and criminals of every type, for the good of a country
which scaled as infants men under twenty-one years of age, and
punished as men such infants as had fallen into manhood's
misdeeds. Thus was this lad condemned to get his further
education amid the dark horrors of a 'tween deck prison ship in
1830. He was born a well-known Worcestershire farmer's son; a
truer Englishman never breathed. His nature sterling: his
faults&mdash;the fruit of the terrible training through which his
years, since the Bow-street judgment, had been dragged.</p>
<p>I did not know all this at the time that I was seated on a log
by the hut-door, the next day; for we stopped here on the 24th.
While so seated, a dray, to our astonishment, came up&mdash;just
from Darling Downs! On it was Frederic Isaac, the younger brother
of the old gentleman whose acquaintance I had made at Black
creek, near Maitland. He had accompanied Arthur Hodgson after my
detention, by reason of illness, at the Peel. News from Darling
Downs, by the first dray that had left it looking to the south!
Greedy as Pemberton Hodgson and I were for descriptions of all
that he had left behind him, our appetite was for the time
appeased by the pleasing intimation that "Arthur was close up!"
His surprise when he did come was the greater, for he had thought
that both of us had returned to England! The remainder of the day
did not exhaust the theme&mdash;Darling Downs&mdash;where, what,
and its wonders; but it exhausted the patience of our recovered
friends, who were as eager to hear about the land they had left
behind so many weeks before. Night mostly passed over me while
writing for home by this opportunity, and the twenty-fifth sun of
October rose upon the shaking of hands and the shouts of
good-bye, as dos a dos each party resumed its route. The last
word was from Arthur Hodgson: "Look out, old fellow, for me with
cattle, next February, if all's well."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p class="indent3">Have many British readers actually arrived
with us at the new promised country; is the philosophy of clothes
now at last opening around them V Long and adventurous has the
journey been, from those outmost vulgar, palpable woollen halls
of man.&mdash;<i>Carlyle</i>. (Sartor Resartus.)</p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">That</span> day we passed a place where the
blacks had had a "corroboree" after the affair at McDougal's, and
of course examined it as new-chums, with no little interest:
having camped a short distance beyond it, and the following day
skirted a thick scrub which had been more or less near us on our
right all the way from the river, we got into a little clear
country: but soon fell on it again on the deep banks and shallow
water of McIntyre Brook. Having again got on quickly on the 27th,
in a heavy storm, we reached the camping place of some drays of
Leslie's, which we had heard were ahead of us, and with them
found his relative Dalrymple. Got away early next morning, and
after smart riding reached a tree marked by Arthur Hodgson to
tell travellers to beware of "poison" in the herbage: took care
that our horses did not get a bite, and in about six miles
descried the first plain of Darling Downs. We, innocent
creatures, thought that this first peep little tallied with the
glowing accounts which had warmed our fancies: we could not
understand how the herbage on the river Condamine banks, which to
us seemed to be all weeds; how a soft puffy black soil full of
holes, up and down and every way but pleasant for riding over,
could be such a magnificent possession: the river itself a dirty
looking boggy little bed of a stream, stagnant on both sides, as
we entered the "crossing place".</p>
<p>The day was, to us, terribly hot; we camped; came upon another
plain spreading on every side: saw some blacks: new chums
preparing for action was a picture: no action after all on our
side, for the blacks set fire to the grass, which seemed to be
very high where they were, and covered us (they being to
windward) with thick black smoke and dust. Proceeded by a track
about two miles to a marked tree: directions given to turn to the
left across the plain, and so find Hodgson and Elliot's station.
We both thought we could see more blacks on the plain, just in
our way! "What shall we do?" "Oh, we must go on in any case."
With all the keenness of a new sensation, said we would gallop
towards them: they would surely run away! So we did; but they
seemed to await us in quiet contempt. "I say, what an immense
head of hair!" "Yes, but do you see that tremendous spear? seems
to be sticking right out of his head! We're in for it! They won't
run! Up guards, and at them! What are they going to do?"</p>
<p>Teeth clenched, carbine in hand, nerves paid with black pitch,
we dug spurs into our wretched animals, and not until we were
within a couple hundred yards of the enemy did we realise the
fact that they were not blacks after all. Hideous grasstrees! We
looked at each other shamefacedly, and, with diminished martial
ardour, burst out into loud laughs to hide our emotions, and
nearly rode headlong over the perpendicular bank of a dry creek
which passed like a pitfall through the base of the plain. Having
followed up its course for a couple of hours, we were not a
little relieved and delighted by the sight of fresh sheep tracks,
and at once came upon an out station of Hodgson and Elliot's.
There instructed, we rushed frantically over some three miles,
reached the head station for the time (it being a tarpaulin),
dropped off our fagged horses almost into the arms of that expert
in bush and wood craft. Cocky Rogers! Great was his astonishment,
greater his delight: his loneliness&mdash;for he was
alone&mdash;was at an end.</p>
<p>We then understood that Elliot had left him, taking the drays,
to attempt crossing the range and reaching Brisbane, to which, by
permit, he would be admitted, as well as goods for the station,
which were to meet him there from Sydney by water.</p>
<p>After a few days' rest, during which my first impression of
Darling Downs was quite and for ever effaced, as I became less
green to their real worth, apart from the wealth which they bore
upon their bosom in essential adaptation to the requirements of
the sheep farmer; the varied richness of herbs and grasses; the
depth of fat soil; the open plains, on which four thousand sheep
could be watched by the shepherd with as much ease as five
hundred in the closely timbered forest land to which they had
been accustomed; and, above all things, the evidence ere long
that the climate was of so happy a medium that catarrah lost its
terrors; and the prognostications of knowing-ones far away south
that the wool would, so near the tropics, quickly became "hair",
were set at naught by manifest improvement&mdash;I was
assured&mdash;in some respects, which I did not understand; no
burr; no grass seed; no &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; well! I was in an
Elysian field&mdash;and truly it was&mdash;as I learned to take
in all its features, a scene of great beauty, and beauty stamped
with value I had no sense of yet. And this tarpaulin triangled
upon the ground by a few poles lashed together at the tops by
"green hide" was a head station! only temporary, however. One
little tree leant away from it&mdash;the trees were very sparse
on the ridge at the back; a dog, cross of greyhound and I know
not what else&mdash;in fact, "lurcher"-like&mdash;was chained to
it; the ashes of a fire which was played out by sun-heat; a few
quart pots, iron pots, a double-barrelled gun (Rogers'); and
under the tarpaulin a cask, which was full of salt mutton: half
the inevitable damper on the top of it; and hidden by another
tarpaulin pegged to the ground, the <i>necessaria quædam alia
vivendi</i>: tea, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The plain in front, sloping down to the creek, such as it was,
for about half a mile, rising again from the other bank, gently
ascending to the opposite lightly-wooded ridges about three miles
away hence (that hill away to the left on the other side is named
by Gilbert Elliot "Rubieslaw", a reminiscence of the Scottish
home, his birthplace); the long reach of treeless (barring those
absurd grass-trees and their top-knots) grass plain from the east
and up the watershed, narrowing as it ascends in that direction,
widening as it descends to us, and yet widening, until it elbows
itself out into that expanse of prairie through which we had
ridden from the crossing place; the long rank grass wavering and
shimmering under a light breath of air now and then, soothing the
glare of the sun; the ridges and forest dwarfed by distance, and
always&mdash;in me at least&mdash;raising the wish to know what
was beyond them again: the feeling, above all, that we were among
the few who, having run Leslie to earth, had yet set eyes on
these new spots, which themselves, as yet untrodden, beckoned us
on and on&mdash;all combined to light up a panorama of present
enchantment which receded into a dissolving view of recesses yet
in gloom. Hope of discoveries yet unprobed!</p>
<p>"Well, Rogers, what do you think of this part of the world?"
"Think!" shouted he, short black pipe and all, "the finest spot,
the finest country for sheep in creation! Bah! New England, why
it would ruin the Bank of England! How-as-ever (a favourite
conditional phrase with Rogers), how-as-ever, let us be thankful
we're well out of it and Cashiobury!" with the emphasis of scorn.
"Look'ee here, now, they may say what they like about finding
runs" (with pitying sarcasm), "but if you want to find a run, and
no mistake, you must come to James Rogers,"</p>
<p>He seemed somewhat excited, did the neat, dapper little
man&mdash;nettled too, about something&mdash;(he and Pemberton
Hodgson, who had brought him a letter, had been some time talking
together at a distance) and it was not long before I saw
cause.</p>
<p>"Yes," smoking puffs, "to James Rogers! D'ye think Mr. Arthur
Hodgson could have found this run for himself: my word, he would
have been a long time getting here, but for J. Rogers! And now,
by&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, that I've put some thousands into his
pocket; aye, made his&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;fortune, I'm to have
the dirty kick out! How-as-ever, J. Rogers don't care: I know
where to find a better thing than Messrs. Hodgson and Elliot's.
Well, Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, you're but a new chum, and
don't know much about it: but you don't know what J.R. can do.
I'll go down country and bring sheep up before the end of this
year, and find a run for them which will take the shine out of
Messrs. H. and E. by long chalks. Now, Mr. R., look'ee here; I'll
give you the whole &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;yarn. After you left
us&mdash;as some of us thought a 'croaker'&mdash;at the Peel last
July, we pushed on, that is, you see, Mr. Hodgson and me, after
camping with the drays at Cash's. There we didn't know what to
do: I saw 'twas no use giving him my opinion, which was, in
course, to follow Leslie's tracks. How-as-ever, who should drop
amongst us one evening, when Hodgson had almost sworn he would go
to the Clarence after all, but Pat Leslie himself. That was on
the 19th July. Well," tossing up and then stroking down his
beard&mdash;longish for so a little a man, "Well! the long and
short of it was this, Pat Leslie and Hodgson had a long
talkee-talkee together. Leslie said that Dobie was a&mdash;I
won't say what, 'cause I'm sure he did'nt mean it (but, you know
Pat Leslie is always 'shaking the shingles' when he talks), well
you know Dobie would not go out to these 'Downs'; so he came on:
heard we were camped here and laid us on his line. Bless you! did
not Leslie call me aside: said he knew that I was a regular 'bush
card', and that after all Hodgson was but a new chum; but he
wanted him to find a good run. By Jove! J.R. could take a wink as
well as a nod, and I done my best to get this. Ha! ha! But I must
tell you:&mdash;'I'm your man! I'll bustle up a run which you
won't sneeze at, Hodgson,' said I, when he asked me to go out
with him after Pat Leslie had gone. Leslie slept with our drays
all that night, so I had everything pat. How-as-ever, to this
very creek we did come straight as a die; crossed many a nice one
away out there," pointing to the south "but he'd promised Leslie
not to meddle with his marked trees on any: he had taken up all
for friends (how-as-ever, two blokes, old Sibley and King, have
taken up a week or so ago, the creek he had marked next to us out
there, on the way to Toolburra, as they call their camp on the
river), and when we dropped over that ridge out there, in sight
of this very plain Leslie had told us of, 'there' says I to
Hodgson, 'there's your sort! beat that you can't and say J.R.
tells you so! 'Now came the fun! We followed this creek up, and
saw a good many darkies about: won't say much about them: J.R.
don't like 'em: Hodgson liked them less, I can tell you. Well,
you know, he is but a new chum." (I winced again.) "We camped.
'No,' said I to Hodgson, 'not close to the creek, nor to the
timber; you trust J.R., he knows all about it.' So we made a
small fire on the ridge of the plain half way between the two.
'Now then,' says I, 'I'll look after the camp, if you'll go for
water. I'll keep the fire bright enough to come back by.' It was
dark. Away stalks Hodgson with a quart pot in each hand: very
cautiously looking around, aloft, everywhere: did'nt seem to
hurry himself. How-as-ever, he went, more quickly I suppose, in a
little, for he plunged promiscous into a water-hole after
tumbling over a steep bank: picking himself up he said, he
quickly filled the quart pots with water and turned for the fire
again: hardly had made a step that way when something made a
shrill and ghostly rush by his head, and seemed to swoop again
and again at his face! something which he caught sight of once,
seemed monstrous in size; said he: horrified, he clanged his pots
together and quicker than he had ever run before, I guess,
clashing them together over his head to defend it (by Jove! made
scarecrows of them), he threw himself nearly into the fire,
buried his face in the grass shouting out 'Yahoo! Yahoo!!'</p>
<p>"J.R., didn't he laugh and chaff all that night, my word." And
here's the end of it. So much for an owl and new chum. Such was,
more or less, the burden of my amusing friend's roundelay. He was
going soon to leave his present occupation. Hodgson had no need
of an expensive and, I should think, somewhat extravagant, though
experienced and skilful, manager. Foster, before mentioned, would
for the future be overseer; he had, with "John", accompanied
Pemberton Hodgson and myself.</p>
<p>We had a couple of days' teaching on Sunday and Monday, 1st
and 2nd November, 1841, what Darling Downs rain could be. We
profited from it by improving our shelter. Got my hand in with a
tomahawk, and took a good degree in stripping bark. The rain
disturbed my horses, and I then had my eyes opened, indeed, by
Tommy, a black boy from New England, who followed their tracks
with and for me until we found them. Marvellous gift, that of
tracking; but what could a black do without it? Why starve, of
course.</p>
<p>"Should you like to see our neighbours?" said Chirpy Rogers in
a few days: "I'll tell you who they are: not numerous eh? Sibley
and King out there," shooting out his left leg over the way as he
lay, with pipe shrouded in beard and moustache, on his back, "and
Leslie's camp further on some twenty miles," making another dip
at the flies. Gladly, of course, I said "yes." "What do you think
old Sibley called Elliot a little while ago, to his disgust? Why;
Elliot went over to see him about some rations lent him from our
drays: were getting hard up I can tell you: they fell out about
the matter: Sibley would'nt stump up: Elliot got into a precious
scot, and Sibley followed him as he rode off, with 'y'oure
a&mdash;bite: y'oure both of ye bites! ha! ha!' It came out on
Elliot's return: 'Rogers,' says he, 'what's a bite? Sibley calls
us all bites!' I gave him the last 'new chum's edition of
Johnson's Dictionary, and he didn't ask again?"</p>
<p>Before leaving Elliot, Rogers and the head station, which I
had thus dropped upon with Pemberton Hodgson, the first efforts
to discover some practical descent and ascent for wheels over the
range which (and it is the special characteristic of the eastern
margin of the Australian coast) sheds a system of waters to the
Pacific on the one side, and on the other to the west, south-west
and south, through South Australia to the Southern Ocean should
not be ignored.</p>
<p>The <i>how</i> to do this, all along the line, had always been
a hard nut to crack. But reaching the nearest port from the table
land had been in all cases a matter of great moment in
considering the most economical means of access to and from a
station, for supplies and the carriage of wool. By the track used
to the Downs from Maitland the distance covered was quite five
hundred miles. Yet Maitland was the nearest depot and port. A
road from the high land of New England to the Richmond or
Clarence passable for drays was still a puzzle: and the puzzle
lay in the grip of the same giant wall which imprisoned the
western wilds. Cunningham stopped on one of his journeys at a
"gap" in it which still bears his name. [I once went down its
three "pinches" on foot, because I could hardly stop myself: to
go up again&mdash;without rattlins'&mdash;I declined.]</p>
<p>On the 4th of June, the bleating of sheep and the cracking of
ox-compelling whips had woke up from lethargy the old river-god
of the Condamine. On the 2nd of July they were established on the
banks at Toolburra: in September Hodgson and Elliot had been
running a dead-heat with Sibley and King, and to the end of 1840
these three stations only were occupied by their holders, and
stocked. [Yet in a pamphlet on "The Early Settlement of
Queensland," compiled by one who ought to have known&mdash;(John
Campbell, commonly called "Tinker")&mdash;having himself been in
possession of Westbrook, with stock from the Severn, are included
the three referred to among those which were not taken up before
the year of his own arrival. "All these stations," he writes,
"were taken up in 1841." And yet he wrote this many years ago.
Alas! the growth of inaccuracies.]</p>
<p><i>Revenons a nos moutons</i>! Provisions, as Rogers had
intimated, were failing: boots were now solely reminiscences:
"niggerhead" was the skeleton in our closet; tea, sugar, and
flour suggestive, severally by their diminishing of a prayer for
the blessed cruse at Zarephath of old: in a word there were
"breakers ahead."</p>
<p>Accommodating oneself to circumstances is doubtless a very
wholesome herb in life's seasoning here. With gruesome smile I
had to swallow, and saw swallowed many an unpalatable leek. Never
before were masters&mdash;masters in a straight jacket&mdash;less
than men. Shepherds, bullock drivers, hutkeepers were pets in our
isolated dependence, and they knew it. Often have I striven, for
conscience sake, in the interests of my kind friends whose guest
I was, in fact I had so long been, to lend a hand when I could;
would, deferentially consulting the tastes and appetites of old
"mates", fry mutton, knead up and bake dampers (myself as well),
spread out "leather jackets" or "johnny cakes", watch the quart
pots of green tea until they bubbled ("Jemmy Watson's simmer"),
and endeavour to soothe, day by day, the grumbler over his
engagement, and win him to good behaviour by obsequious attention
to his animal comforts. Many the involuntary impulse to touch my
hat to the sauntering bullock-driver, and wish him the "top o'
the morning." Poor Elliot! what an indignant blush lit up his
usually unimpassioned face when he yielded, for very policy's
sake, to the persistent desire of a grimy shepherd to shake "a
lord's <em>son's</em> paw" (happy mistake for nephew).
<em>Small</em> trials? No! trials of no small calibre when riches
and poverty, success and failure, approval and ridicule were
shifting the balance&mdash;questions to be determined outside the
"pale" of J.P.'s and police&mdash;with patience, perseverance,
and pluck. But I must hark back again.</p>
<p>"What do you say, Elliott?" had Hodgson suddenly called out
one fine morning last September, throwing the pipe away from his
lips, as he lay on his back in the grass; "What do you say, old
fellow? A road over this confounded range from Brisbane we
<i>must</i> have, and a road we will have. Will you come and try?
My word!" (Hodgson was inoculated with this ejaculation.) "We
shall be looking queer enough soon if we don't. There's Dairy
mple coming up all the way from Maitland with drays; has been
months and months on the road, and will have eaten up his loads
before he gets to the Condamine!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," replied imperturbable Elliott, "All serene! but let
me finish my own pipe in peace. Will you ride Beverly?" "Of
course I shall; and I'll lend you Jacob or Balaper. Which will
you have?" "Neither, thank'ee!" The one was a determinedly
vicious mule; the other a spur-proof slug.</p>
<p>So within two days they had tumbled over Cunningham's Gap:
followed much the same course awhile that Leslie had at the end
of last June, and continued on east, hoping to find the
settlement of Brisbane. They had a compass, but followed their
noses. In such pursuit a cry from Hodgson betokened something.
"What is it?" "Why, nothing more nor less than sheep dung, old
boy! Glorious! We must be somewhere now," continued Hodgson. "Of
course we are," retorted captious Elliott, "but where?" That's
the question!" "Well, if there here be dung of sheep, sheep must
be near which dung it, you muff!" was the truism re-shot. "But
where are they?" "Oh, follow the dung", roared Hodgson, nibbling
at a pellet to make sure what it was. And they soon did reach an
out sheep-station close to Limestone (now called Ipswich), and
they were politely taken in charge by a sergeant's guard! "Can't
possibly go on to Brisbane without a pass!" put an effectual bar
to further progress.</p>
<p>Limestone in 1840! How the recollection of that solitary
Government cottage&mdash;hitherto the most northern and western
dwelling in Australia&mdash;stands out as the handselled
resting-place for the "jackeroos!" By this wild name the "jumped
up" white men beyond the range had been reported by the blacks
from tribe to tribe until the news reached the settlement, and
all therein had cried "who can they be?" Some said, escaped
prisoners; and the propriety of sending out constables to see and
seize had been discussed. Then from Sydney had come the usual
every six-months' schooner, and the authorities had been informed
that perhaps white settlers would ere long find their way to the
north and (as far as Brisbane's parallel) to the west. So the
constables stood at ease. Then the approach of "jackeroos" (P.
Leslie and Murphy) last June, some moons before, had been
heralded by the frightened darkies; then (for Leslie had turned
back without approaching Limestone) that they had gone away
again! They were thus reported as six-legged monsters: big dogs,
which had a leg out of either side, and a man's body on them, and
great was the beseeching that the Commandant and "diamonds"
(soldiers, a detachment of the 80th) should come and shoot
"numkull", the jackeroos! When "up jump" "jackeroo" Hodgson and
Elliot, and the wondering stops.</p>
<p>Limestone in 1840!&mdash;Who, after clearing through the past
stretch of flats, ridges, gullies, and nasty creeks, could have
flattered himself that he should so soon break in upon this
peaceful abode? But what is the abode without its welcome
greeting?"By golly!" ha-ha'd no end of a pair of strong lungs
from within, followed by a sounding slap on the thigh. "By golly!
see here, Jane!" and out strode into the verandah the sturdy
frame of George Thorne. Ah! George Thorne I George Thorne! though
you have left but your ashes in the soil under our feet, your
name, your humour, your thoroughness, and above all your
integrity of heart, head and hand, lie not there with them; they
are not even shelved among past regrets: they are so often dwelt
upon among the memories without words (<i>lied ohne worte</i>) of
those who afterwards knew you well, and so knowing, esteemed and
honoured you. See the keen, honest embrowned features of as good
a specimen type of Somersetshire and soldier as ever stepped in
shoe leather. See, again, by his side, standing the earnest,
active, faithful wife, who has dared to brighten by her presence
this dark corner of the land. What a contrast! The upright and
intelligent man, and the so winsome helpmate, willingly allotting
themselves to the charge of a prison post, a gang of hardened
outlaws, whose compulsory labour was utilised under their eyes at
the Plough Station close by.</p>
<p>Thorne had obtained his discharge from the army when
colour-sergeant in the 34th Regiment. He had carried away with
him the good wishes of all who had known him in it and out of it,
not excepting Governor Sir Richard Bourke, whose very right hand
he had long been. It must have seemed a strange request, when,
after leaving the service, he applied for and obtained the
appointment which he now held, at the very confines of the
civilised world, and in charge of unhappy beings, whom the
civilised world had put out of the way.</p>
<p>I think, from what I see, that this happy couple might in all
conscience claim the "flitch of bacon" at the hands of the Lord
of Whichenore. (How pleasant to turn over the old yellow leaves
of a note-book. How painful the after-math: mown down both:
garnered both.)</p>
<p>"By golly!" it's well you weren't shot for runaways. But come
in, come in; Tommy will see to your horses," when he had somewhat
"shook himself" together out of bewilderment; "Jane, Jane, I
say," to his amazed spouse, "out with the beef, eggs, bacon; by
golly! all you've got; well, this is a queer go&mdash;haw, haw,
haw!" And so, with a bang of both hands together, their
unexpected guests welcomed, housed, fed in such kindly custody,
passed the few hours of their arrest; a tame emu and kangaroo,
who had shared the surprise, standing sole sentries over
them.</p>
<p>This cottage stood in a bight, formed by the junction of a
deep gully, on the western aspect, with the Bremer, which flowed
by us on the north, about a hundred yards away, and stood some
sixty feet above the western level. [I mention this, because a
flood which occurred shortly afterwards surrounded the verandah,
and a few feet more of rise would have swept the whole building
away. On the other side of the gully, and opposite, Thorne
afterwards built the first hotel&mdash;Victoria or
Queen's&mdash;which, years again afterwards he sold to "Bill the
Fiver" my lately-mentioned acquaintance on the Severn.]</p>

<p><span class="a">Lieut. Owen Gorman</span>, of Her Majesty's
88th Regiment, was at this time Commandant of the penal
settlement of Moreton Bay, which had been established about
sixteen years. A small detachment was quartered at the Brisbane
Barracks. Of cheerful and hospitable Irish temperament, he took
our wayfarers into his house, and welcomed them with
characteristic cordiality. Two days after their arrest at
Limestone permission was sent up for visiting Brisbane. There
were two Government stations passed on the road&mdash;one at a
place called Redbank, the other seven miles before reaching the
town, Cooper's Plains,* the country all the way uninteresting and
uninviting. The first house seen was the Commandant's, at the top
of the bank on the other side of the river, to which and from
which a boat plied. A horse was made to swim across, being towed
by its owner sitting therein. One horse at a time made it slow
work. Just above the Commandant's house,
Deputy-Assistant-Commissary-General Kent's quarters; then the
Barracks; above them Dr. Ballow's, the medical officer's, at the
back of whose house, and in the main street (Queen-street), was
the postmaster's house and office&mdash;such as was
required;&mdash;the Prisoners' Barracks; the lumber yard; and
about half a mile further on the abode of the Superintendent of
Works, Andrew Petrie, and his family. The Prisoners' Barracks and
Female Factory were empty; the prisoners had been sent to Sydney.
Transportation was supposed to have ceased to New South Wales on
the 1st of August, 1839. Last year the system of assigning
servants had been discontinued.</p>
<p class="foot">[* First named "Cowper's" Plains.]</p>
<p>About three miles away and down the river on the same side was
a place called Eagle Farm. Here had been erected a kind of open
palisade-enclosed space, in which female prisoners had at times
been confined. It was now untenanted; but in a cottage hard by
there still dwelt two gentlemen who, having been in former days
associates in the old, found themselves again together in this
brush-encircled nook in the new world. The elder was Stephen
Simpson, who was afterwards appointed to be first Commissioner of
Crown Lands&mdash;as soon as it was declared an open
settlement&mdash;for the Moreton Bay district; the other, William
Henry Wiseman, years afterwards Police Magistrate at Rockhampton,
where he died and was buried. The former had been attached to a
crack cavalry corps in the old war: when peace was declared had
retired from the army, become a disciple of Samuel Christian
Friedrich Hahnemann, founder of hom&oelig;opathy, come to
England, and by practise of the new doctrine, drawn upon himself
so much invective and ridicule on the part of the Faculty, that
pamphleteering and prejudice had embittered the old world to him,
and after twenty years patient engagement had, in the first of
his wedded life, been left to bear the burden of his
disappointment alone as a widower.</p>
<p>So he, and his companion oft times in Germany, made interest
to be admitted to this recess in voluntary exile; and here, with
all manner of friendliness, which in some cases became durable
friendship, the wayfarers from westward ho! were on all occasions
called in, entertained, and tended. I say "entertained" because
both were men of no mean powers of thought, enriched by no
superficial study, and tempered by experiences beyond the
<i>rôle</i> of every day life. They were no modern sciolists.</p>
<p>The spring of this new era brought out these two recluses into
the world again; they lived in it all long enough to make some
few who remain feel that the old "arm-chairs" at Eagle Farm and
Woogooroo can never be refilled by kinder hosts, or more
chivalrous gentlemen.</p>
<p>The Commandant and his estimable wife left nothing undone, if
it could be done, to make the sojourn of some days comfortable
and very enjoyable. Truly visitors to Brisbane had&mdash;some
there may be who still have&mdash;reason to remember Lieutenant
and Mrs. Gorman with gratitude.</p>
<p>But the main object of this visit was to find a road, fit for
drays, back again. If this were not attained, was it possible to
get up Cunningham's Gap again? and No! seemed the inexorable
answer. Yet Hodgson and Elliot were compelled to return without
success. The "pinches" of this terrible gap ascent <i>seemed</i>
to be insuperable for wheels and bullocks: the pinch
superimpending of hunger and starvation and ruin was so. The
supplies expected had arrived from Sydney: they must be got up to
the station. So back they went stumbling over hope, but not
losing heart though sorely "down" dragging themselves and their
scrambling horses hand-over-hand to the Downs again.</p>
<p>In two days they had arrived at the station: kept their own
counsel. Elliot said "he'd chance it." Once at the bottom of this
Gap with the drays unsmashed, "would have burnt his ships" behind
him, and then must go: "somehow" a safe return must be
accomplished,&mdash;and so it was; but by an unlooked for
service.</p>
<p>The first officer sent from Sydney in charge of
prisoners&mdash;as commandant in fact&mdash;to the spot
temporarily fixed upon by Oxley at Redcliff Point, was Lieutenant
Miller, of the 40th Regiment, who sailed in September, 1824.</p>
<p>Captain Logan's reign at Moreton Bay was the most conspicuous
throughout its penal existence. His, I have heard spoken of as "a
reign of terror:" I have heard his name execrated. Again, if he
had been severe as a disciplinarian in so repulsive a task as his
was, those before and after him may by their laxity have afforded
a contrast which Captain Logan's detractors may have made full
use of. At any rate, if severe beyond the very limit of his duty
and responsibility or not, the hatred he incurred among the
prisoners in his charge became proverbial. I find in my old note
book of 1841, written at Brisbane: "This place remembers the name
of Logan with terror. There were many instances, I am told, of
men driven to desperation by the cruelties practised on them, so
that they would cast lots for cutting each others' throats, in
order to get rid of their own lives by being hung in Sydney. This
same Logan was murdered, I am assured, by the blacks at the
instigation of the whites."</p>
<p>In after years I had evidence from a white man, whom I fell in
with among the blacks, and who returned to Brisbane with me in
1842, confirmatory of the statement made by men on the gallows in
Sydney, that desperation had driven them to murder as a means
whereby they might find relief in the forfeiture of their own
lives. I shall allude no further to reports which I heard in 1841
at the settlement, which tended to throw a very heavy burden on
the name and memory of the unfortunate Captain Logan. Of the
justice of them not any one living can judge.</p>
<p>I must now revert to Elliot and his drays, which had slidden
down Cunningham's Gap in absolute dependence upon the
Micawber-like "chance it!" They could not, they knew, get up
again with their drays, but surely something must turn up to help
them back again. In some such smoking serenity must Elliot and
his trusty bullock-driver, Joe Archer, have viewed&mdash;as
"Hobson's choice"&mdash;their position at the foot of that
mis-named Gap: go on we must: get back we must and chance it.</p>
<p>The coming of white settlers to Darling Downs had been a
fright not to the natives only. It happened that in one of the
tribes dwelling between the settlement and the Dividing Range
there had been for some years domesticated&mdash;(an exceptional
instance sparing the white man's life)&mdash;a runaway prisoner
whose name was Baker. I cannot recollect that which had been
given him by the blacks: I think "Boralcho". He fearing that he
would soon be encompassed by whites on both sides&mdash;soldiers
and squatters&mdash;gave himself up.</p>
<p>The last Commandant, Lieutenant Owen Gorman, had a happy
thought one day: "Why not go see Hodgson and Elliot, these
squatters to the west? People say it's impossible to get up by
the Gap. By the powers then, <em>why</em> do they call it a gap?
Bedad! Baker must know every inch of the country. I'll take him
and try to find a 'Gorman's Gap', and no mistake, fit for wheels
to get over. Some one must do it; bedad, I'm the man." So, after
pumping Baker&mdash;as far as the wily Baker could be
pumped&mdash;but who promised freely, with an eye to reward in
some shape or other, the Commandant got built, by convict hands,
a queer specimen of the Irish jaunting car: wheels strong but
low: axle of wrought iron, strong enough to carry himself and his
wife and family into the bargain: shafts heavy enough for a
rhinoceros: sides made to fold up and down on hinges, <i>down</i>
over the wheels for a seat on either side, and footboard;
<em>up</em> so as to form a box for storage, when meeting over
all: distance between wheels very small: in fact, the very sort
of thing for the attempt he was going to make.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I well recollect its dimensions and
fashioning, for in after time I bought it from him, and had it
for years in use.]</p>
<p>Away went, then, one day, Commandant Gorman from the dirty
little out-station beyond Limestone, bestriding a stout built,
dark brown pony mare, with Baker trudging confidently by his
side, rehabilitated from his tribal garb; and on came following a
big bullock between the shafts of the small chariot, supported by
an armed constable on either flank, a few days after Hodgson and
Elliot's visit. And so on day after day, through a country with
which Baker had been long intimate&mdash;comparatively happy in
his outcast state of freedom&mdash;straight on and on, to the
foot of the upheaved mass, which so persists along this eastern
board in making "Tom Tiddler's ground" of the land and water
which fringes away from its crown. "Eh! what, are we to get up
that. Baker?" "Yes, your honour", was implied by his straining
steps on and on, with barely a halt. And truly, only here and
there, between the gloomy portals of a pass, pinched in by a dark
scrubby gorge on the one side, and a defiant wall of grass and
stone on the other, were any real difficulties to be met upon a
spur of the range, which, by fits and starts&mdash;a short
plateau, a short sharp pinch, and another plateau&mdash;levered
the soil towards the coveted level on the summit. And thus, with
effort of no Homeric type&mdash;(nevertheless the stalwart
Commandant did now perform pedestrian prodigies in pity to the
pony)&mdash;to the amazement of all but the exulting Baker, did
they find themselves at the top of the range&mdash;Commandant,
car, cattle, and constables.</p>
<p>They must have stared curiously upon the scene over the wide
land before them, as far as what was soon called "Little
Liverpool Range", on their trail from the east. Strange must they
have thought this new sight over the tops of wooded hills and
ridges which they had crossed and left behind: such fantastically
shaped eruptions from the ground's skin, too! Queer topknot that
to the left, thickly bewigged with a dense, dark, crisp crop of
brush, save the small bald patch on the poll of his nob, where
one would have thought the wool, or wood rather, ought to
grow.</p>
<p>Yes, the first look upon the view from this and many other
outstanding points on the top of the dividing or main range was a
novel and great delight then; no longer, however, lit up by the
sense of its absolute innocence of previous intrusion and
invasion by the white race, must be a great delight to many an
eye still.</p>
<p>Our travellers, however, had no time nor desire to
sentimentalise&mdash;if in any way given to such
emotion&mdash;over the grand expanse. They had met natives on the
way at times, and without doubt Baker had heard from them of the
"jackeroos" and their whereabouts. It was, then, with no
hesitation that he followed the course of a watershed to the
westward, which, after one night's camping at the first supply
they could find in this new system, brought them into the glad
view of Darling Downs. The flow had brought them also to a more
pronounced though dry bed, which ere long proved to have long
reaches within its banks of black soil and reeds, in which could
be seen large lumps of coal, or what seemed to be coal, and,
leaving the lightly timbered ridges, led them into a plain. And
what a glorious passage that plain was to their destination! They
did not know that the caprices of lovely landscape before
them&mdash;plain here, plain there, adorning itself with a belt
of timber and ridge to the very foot of that conspicuous
bluff&mdash;which they did not know was "Rubieslaw"&mdash;was the
domain on which they should find Hodgson and Elliot's resting
place. And so they crawled on&mdash;admiring, conjecturing,
hoping, and smoking&mdash;until the station spot was too manifest
to be mistaken.</p>
<p>Sincere and warm were the congratulations&mdash;on the one
side pride of success, on the other relief in the knowledge that
over anything which that queer car had surmounted, Elliot, of
course, and his bullocks could surely flog their way home again.
Indeed, this issue to the Commandant's effort marked a red letter
day for our Darling Downs tablets that year&mdash;memorial of an
act for which to be grateful to the gallant officer who had in
such pleasant fashion led the way for panting teams and heavy
laden drays with a bullock and an Irish jaunting car.</p>
<p>After a pleasant rest of a couple of days, the cavalcade left
this station (which afterwards became known as the
"Drummer's"&mdash;an assigned servant who had once been a drummer
having been left there as shepherd, when the head station of
Etonvale was removed to its present site, some twelve miles or
more higher up) with the intention of paying our two neighbours a
visit, and so returning by the headlong "Gap".</p>
<p>On the 5th of November, 1840, Pemberton Hodgson, Rogers and I
rode over to Toolburra, having stopped for a while on the way at
the triangular bark dwelling-place in which King and Sibley eat,
drank, kept what provisions they had, smoked and slept. [That
spot was afterwards called Clifton *&mdash;to be more accurate,
the Clifton station was a few hundred yards down on the same side
of the creek&mdash;Clifton, after passing through the hands of
Forbes, Marsh, and Pinnock, ultimately fell into the hands of
Tertius Campbell, and from him passed on to W, B. Tooth.] At
Toolburra, I first on this occasion met one of the two estimable
younger brothers of Patrick Leslie&mdash;Walter&mdash;as well as
Fairholme and Farqharson. Dalyrmple, whom I had seen on the road
some little while back, was also there. The heavy rain set in
again: the Condamine began to run like a millrace, and so we
waited next day for fine weather for return. When the flood was
at its highest the following evening, a loud shout was heard from
the opposite bank. So unusual a hailing summoned us out in a
body: on the other side, in a pitiable plight holding his horse,
stood Sibley. "What am I to do?" cried the somewhat corpulent and
unwieldly middle-aged gentleman: "Oh! what am I to do! I cant
swim! my horse is dead beat, I can't go back!" "Never mind", a
voice suggested, "We'll tow you across." "How get a rope over?" I
was foolish enough to say "I would." With a bight of rope round
my arm I plunged in, and was sucked under a dead log in the
stream: got clear somehow but didn't like it: the under-tow was
difficult: however, having safely arrived, Sibley proceeded to
divest himself of his outer skin, which having lashed together
tight, I proceeded to make the rope fast round what he had of a
waist: he was in a terribly nervous state. "Are you ready, Mr.
Sibley?" "No! stop. Can't you carry my watch for me across?"
displaying, out of the grass, an immense old-fashioned silver
affair, about the size of an average Swede turnip. "How do you
expect me to carry such a watch swimming, without damaging it?"
"Oh: I thought you could put it,&mdash;put it, like a good
fellow&mdash;in&mdash;in your mouth."</p>
<p class="foot">[* So named by John Milbourne Marsh (now S.M.,
N.S.W.), after his birthplace.]</p>
<p>With feelings, of course, hurt at such a reflection on the
watch-pocket he wanted me to utilise, I declined; he began to
implore: "it was such an old friend, this watch; a keepsake, he'd
bless me to the last day of his life if I would do him this
kindness, yes, he'd bl&mdash;&mdash;"(I had changed two
half-hitches into a running noose), I made a sign, and into the
surging stream head over heels was hauled poor Sibley; bubbles
followed his body and his blessing: and he was pulled out on the
other side nearly cut in two,&mdash;his obesity
notwithstanding&mdash;amid the most merciless roars I had heard
yet&mdash;in the bush. I did, however, provide otherwise for the
watch; but never volunteered again to carry a rope "over the
water to Charlie."</p>
<p>We returned to the "Drummer's". Nothing that I could write
could mould any idea of what the grass on the intervening plains
was then, for any one crossing them now. The young features have
disappeared, and the country, to the sight of an old squatter on
them, has put on a mask: it may put on another when this
generation has made room for its successor. But I have to do with
then&mdash;not with now.</p>
<p>The plains, in the dry season lately, had been burnt off. I
had locked not so long ago over a black sea, but now the
marvellous welling up of an ocean of green, summoned quickly from
the depths by the first bright sun, was a wealth of loveliness
unwrapped so suddenly from its sooty folding as to be almost
beyond belief except under the eye's evidence.</p>
<p>The rains had ceased. The anxieties about Elliot and the drays
was intolerable. They were no less at Toolburra, for on the 12th
of this month (November) Dalrymple at once followed us, and he,
Rogers and I made a start towards the head of the creek, for the
purpose of finding, if not obliterated, the tracks of the "car"
which the Commandant had brought up. Tommy, the black boy, was,
of course, with us, and we picked them up about a mile above the
spot on which the head-station of Etonvale now stands, and
followed them up until evening. We thought we had come about
seventeen miles from the Drummer's, and pulled up, to camp, on a
stony bank of the creek, believing that we were not far from
Gorman's Gap. We had just hobbled our horses, and Dalrymple was
still doing so, when we heard a coo-ee. I looked up and saw a
man, whom I supposed was but Dalrymple returning (not dreaming of
any other white man's approach) but most wondrously changed in
apparel and horse. Rogers and I stared in amazement: when Rogers,
with "By Jove, it's Elliot!" tumbled over the quart-pots of tea
into the fire. For myself, I was so surprised into delight that I
let my horse go and bolted down the ridge and bank to meet him.
[Elliott's announcement sometime afterwards of this our
<i>rencontre</i> to a friend was as follows: "I saw a
fellow&mdash;I couldn't make out who&mdash;all of a sudden rush
at me down the bank on the other side, and, when I looked again,
a pair of yellow leggings was all that marked his presence,
sticking up high from a bed of rushes."] "Most hurry, least
haste!" fully exemplified. I had tripped over a stone, fallen
head-foremost into the mud of the bed, and stuck in it until
extricated, with a pleasant mouth and nose full. With wry face, I
shook hands with him in all heartiness. "But oh, dear me,
Russell! how is it that you were not buried at Killala? I'm quite
disappointed."</p>
<p>Soon the drays hove in sight; they had taken the Irish car
track to Gorman's Gap, and there we were together at length! We
were too much pleased, on both sides, with what that evening had
brought about to think about turning in. Sleep was kept at bay by
question and answer: one, for news from the west; the other, for
news from the east. But the merits and demerits of the road was
the yarn of the night. "All I can say is, that Gorman's Gap has
helped us over; Cunningham's would have seen us somewhere first,
but from the foot of the range at the latter place the road is
much less 'cursed' than that from this one: there's a stretch of
country full enough of gullies and 'break-necks' which it has
taken us the last three days to get over; full enough, I say, to
spoil a saint's temper, to say nothing of a bullock driver's: but
you see, I always take things easy. When Joe Archer came to a bad
place I would go over to the opposite side, sit down, smoke, and
look at him. I tell you what, Russell; one gets a lesson in some
'dead' languages by this work! I gave up looking on, after
crossing a deep running creek (Lockyer's). I had sat myself down
as usual, when Joe called out from the other side 'look out!' and
I did look out; for there I was, and some six hundred blacks
behind and on either side of me. They seemed determined to stop
our crossing; a shot or two from the other side made them fall
back; and so did I, I can tell you! One man got hit with a
waddie, but he's all right now. Well! all's well that ends ends
well, old fellow! We got up the gap early this morning. It looked
terrible last night! Dark as pitch. I dirged it in the name of
'Hell's Hole'." [Hell's Hole it remains to this day. It was used
for some time, until, in fact, the 'Swamps' (Toowoomba) road was
found. It soon justified the name; the more it was used the less
became it a <i>via sacra.</i>] Thus Commandant Gorman's unlooked
for service helped pig over the stile, and Gilbert Elliot "got
home that night."</p>
<p>Not far from the place we camped at was the farthest spot to
which Arthur Hodgson and Rogers had followed up the
creek&mdash;that of Etonvale&mdash;when searching for this run
some months ago. It is a curious thing that they came upon the
skeleton of a horse at that point, which was always declared to
have been Logan's, which had escaped when he was speared.* No
tribe had ever then crossed the range to the westward: the few
natives who had joined Baker when <i>en route</i> with Commandant
Gorman absolutely refused to proceed over, or even to the foot of
the range. None of them on the east seemed to be in any way
acquainted with the plains of Darling Downs, nor to have even
heard of them, until the advent of the white men "jackeroos". Not
many miles hence, however, the name of Etonvale was branded upon
this station by a curious occurrence, which can never find a
positive explanation. Hodgson and Rogers had fallen in with
natives camped by the side of some timber. They ran, leaving,
like the nursery "black sheep" of old, "their tails behind them."
Among these relics they found a knife bearing the name of a
well-known maker at Hodgson's own school-town, Eton. And Etonvale
it is to this day.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Shown afterwards to have been an error.]</p>
<p>Right glad was poor Elliot&mdash;as new a chum as
myself&mdash;to get rid of what he called a few stone of dirt,
accumulated on the road during the last three weeks. Dalrymple
and Rogers went on to have a look into Hell's Hole; Elliot and I
cantered on merrily to the Drummer's, found Pemberton Hodgson
smoking, and so did we three meet again. Up came the drays in the
evening; up came Dalrymple and Rogers, whose peep into the "hole"
had not been gratifying, and down from the well laden drays came
the <i>necessaria quædam</i> for making bush life exquisite, and
the trials thereof good seasoning for the true enjoyment of
pleasurable surprises, and happy reliefs from distresses.</p>
<p>"Well, Elliot," one day, "I wonder that you ever cared to
leave the comfort of Government House, and the kindly regards of
the Governor; what on earth&mdash;if it is fair to ask&mdash;made
you give it up?" "Rounds of beef", said he, without a smile.
Seeing me perplexed, he added, "<i>Toujours</i> rounds of beef;
Sir George is a noble old fellow; the best Governor we've yet
had&mdash;that's my belief&mdash;looks stern enough, and can be
stern enough on fair occasion and provocation, but is in his own
house a&mdash;well&mdash;a thorough brick; but he was always
having fresh rounds of beef <i>roasted</i> for dinner. Whenever
there was a round&mdash;his favourite dish&mdash;to be expected
in the evening, he was fidgetting all day long. 'I say, Elliot,'
he would say half-a-dozen times in the day, 'do you think that
round is being properly looked after, do go down&mdash;surely you
won't mind&mdash;just go; have a peep in the kitchen, and see if
it looks well.' Of course I couldn't say 'No'; so, whenever Sir
George had a round on the brain and board I was miserable; I was
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, no idea had I of being
<i>chef-de-cuisine</i>; so I jumped at old Hodgson, and here am
I&mdash;jolly as a sand-boy at Sir Arthur's round table, up on
the Downs." [Prophetic words which he did not live to see
fulfilled.]</p>
<p>So, by joke and smoke we passed away the monotony, which, at
times, became wearisome. Quail shooting&mdash;quails abounded on
the plains&mdash;rifle practice, tracking stray bullocks or
horses, with black Tommy, were diversions.</p>
<p>Taking the dogs out after an emu or kangaroo&mdash;a hot style
of coursing, which diminished the number of our dogs by one every
run we had: heat too much for them: water too scarce: the
wretched animals would stagger, lie down, and die; and so, the
kennel becoming empty, our hunt subsided. For a change, we tried
to build some kind of hut for our stores, but soon left the
splitting of slabs and the stripping of bark to the old hands;
the heat was too much for new chums.</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month (Nov.) did the first foal on Darling
Downs see the light&mdash;to us quite an event. Pemberton
Hodgson's black mare, bought a year ago at Black creek from Henry
Isaac, presented him with this memorial of her admirable
qualities, which inherited the blood of Killala, far away on the
Peel. The next day but one we were enlivened by a visit from
Toolburra&mdash;Walter Leslie and his drays, <i>en route</i> to
Brisbane by that descent into "Hell's Hole", in "Gorman's Gap",
at the head of our creek. The heat almost every day summoned up a
thunderstorm, usually from the S.W. December began with a heavy
sprinkle and an attempted inroad by the blacks. Brought back
Walter Leslie and his drays on the 14th from Brisbane; indulged
me with a hard gallop after two emus, both of which I
caught&mdash;rare addition to salt mutton and damper on the 18th;
which little distractions culminated in my first lesson in
shearing, which began in Hodgson and Elliot's makeshift shed on
Saturday (19th), King and Sibley having kindly sent over two men
to help. Two hundred and nine ewes reduced to a state of nudity
seemed to provoke the elements; a perfect hurricane of wind and
rain made the wretched animals wish for their coats again. Some
few&mdash;for none got them&mdash;died out of spite. The shears
lay idle awhile, and so slouching into Christmas Day, could find
nothing for my hands to do but the comforting, neglected excuse
of shaving. Making a plum pudding in such weather was a painful
exercise of temper. Sunday, 27th, was fine, and so, in spite of
all old-fashioned scruple, began shearing again, and, much to the
satisfaction of a shepherd called Mears, rendered to his charge
by the evening one thousand, two hundred and twenty-five ewes
lighter by many a pound of wool, which seemed to have collected
all imaginable filth on their long journeyings through the year
now nearly gone. Then came (what an impression a new scene, and
all details of places and names and numbers, shouted out so often
on this new occasion of amusement and interest; and that use of
the spade in a new fashion&mdash;that of digging wool into a
wool-bale&mdash;make on a new chum's mental tablets); then came,
I say, the anything but delicately voiced shout for "Asplin's"
wethers; then "Scotchie's" ewes; and then, "by Jove" the next
morning, "where are they gone?" Yes, all gone! Watchman fast
asleep; sheep wide awake; taken their own line cross country:
track 'em down we must.</p>
<p>"Here Spiers" cried out Pemberton Hodgson, "you must find them
again; here take my horse: follow their tracks with Tommy, and
stick to them." Trouble No. 1,&mdash;what a loss to a beginner!
But the old year would not die out with such a blot upon the
promise of which it had presented so many a handsome earnest, in
the successes of these hopeful, ever hopeful aspirants to a
prosperous future. The last hour of its last days' sunlight
waited upon the trusty shepherd Spiers, as he came back with the
sheep that were lost; some few only having been killed by the
native does.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p class="indent3">Human nature, under very old governments, is
so trimmed and penned, and ornamented, and led into such a
variety of factitious shapes that we are almost ignorant of the
appearance it would assume if it were left more to itself. From
such an experiment as that now before us, we shall be better able
to appreciate what circumstances of our situation are owing to
those permanent laws by which all men are influenced, and what to
the accidental positions in which we have been
placed.&mdash;<i>Sydney Smith</i>. (Review of Collins' N.S.
Wales.)</p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> 1st of January, 1841, took a first
look at us through mist, murkiness, and mugginess. It was
Thursday: it ended in merriment. Dalrymple cantered over from
Toolburra: George Leslie&mdash;the youngest brother whom I had
not yet met&mdash;had come up from Sydney overland: brought
letters: old as my own were (by date nearly one year) to me they
told a message as of yesterday. Letters soon set us a-gadding
about home: they overhauled for each of us much of the slack of
the line which had dropped out of hand&mdash;through the strain
of distance, the yielding through absence, and the lack of
interchange of the "how? where? when? who?"&mdash;through the
much-missed medium of Her Majesty's mail. (Letters to me, what I
have of them still, speak only of the dead!)</p>
<p>Clip! clip! snip! snip! with savage kick, grunt, and oath,
went the shears still day by day: thunder, lightning, hail, and
rain notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Hail! aye, such hail as had never till then rattled itself
into any of our realities: hail which pitted the weather side of
the disbranched trees in one course, never varying in breadth nor
in direction, like rifle butts. Thunder which seemed ever to
reproach the lightning with instant roars for attempting to
distance it. Rain which ever gorged the crumbling banks of
gullies, creeks, and Condamine, and then truanted in streams of
hide-and-seek among the melon-holes over the rank bases of the
plains. Rats, reptiles, snakes, on each unflooded patch,
sympathisers through common peril: in fright-born fellowship
harmonious, if not a happy family.</p>
<p>Clip! snip! the wool must be sent down; interest of ten per
cent, on overdraft or debt won't do; a monetary crisis, too, is
coming on; everyone down in the mouth; and that wretched bank in
George-street has closed its doors; what shall we poor squatters
do. Let's see&mdash;the rams are shorn&mdash;after such rain the
box bark will strip off gaily; we must have more shelter for the
wool. McIntyre, bring up your flock; oh! they are
lambs&mdash;quick work. At half-past three o'clock, on Saturday,
the 23rd, were closed the shears for this first season on
Etonvale creek, at the Drummer's. Elliot tried his hand at
sorting all through; Pemberton Hodgson and others at the spade,
a-packing and a-pressing with a long clumsy lever. With glad
features did we all straighten our backs again, after the
head-aching study of sheep, shears, and struggles.</p>
<p>On Sunday 31st, the weather became steadily clear and bright.
Sundays seemed to be peculiarly provocative of the pipe. More
silence, too, prevailed: each inner-life pre-occupied by his own
a-thynkynge,</p>
<p>February. "Will you come with us to Brisbane, Russell? I must
go down with the drays in a few days." "How shall you go down?"
"By Hell's Hole; can pick you up on the way; you know."</p>
<p>In a few days, consequently, I was awaiting the arrival of
Walter Leslie and the drays from Toolburra, to which I had lately
ridden and returned. Out on the edge of the plain below, looking
for my horses, in preparation, I nearly stepped upon a hideous
black snake. I suppose it was no less frightened at my approach,
than I was at his proximity, because it bolted. If it had not, I
think I should have done so. It was a horrid beast; black as
black, belly bright orange red: a nasty looking flat head and
snubby snout. It was the first of the kind I had seen, and the
desire to kill and possess overcame my dread of it: followed the
brute&mdash;the grass was quite short&mdash;which made for a
large hole in the soil, like a small burrow: had gone in about
two thirds of his length when the prospect of losing my curio
overcame my discretion: I seized his tail and then marvelled to
find what a powerful hold he had of the ground: he tugged and I
tugged: a sudden cold perspiration broke out all over me, when I
caught sight of his terrible muzzle within a couple of inches of
my hand: he had made a round turn in his burrow,&mdash;perhaps
his refuge on other occasions&mdash;and his Satanic eyes just
protruding beyond the mouth of another hole at my very feet
petrified me. Intent as the beast was on seizing my hand I dared
not let go: he would have struck me in a moment. I dared not even
relax&mdash;he would have reached me. I suppose my very terror
made me hold on: in a few moments&mdash;such long ones&mdash;I
felt his curled coil yielding: little by little his malignant
features sunk back; till on the extraction of about one half the
reptile's length, I was able to break its back with my heel, and
had him helpless. Overcoming my disgust&mdash;after a
smoke&mdash;I could not deny that it was a most beautiful
specimen of that repulsive family: the glossy smooth sparkling
ebony: the blending of the various shades of orange on his belly:
and the expressed hate in the dying eyes were all things to be
admired, and, in their way were very beautiful,&mdash;under the
latter circumstances. The skin made a sweet pair of slippers
afterwards.</p>
<p>Walter Leslie and his followers came and went&mdash;I with
him&mdash;to Hell's Hole, two days afterwards&mdash;the middle of
this month. Aptly named, was the admission after the first look
at it. <i>Facilis</i> the <i>descensus</i> with a
vengeance:&mdash;and although I knew and could see that drays
heavily laden had been lately dragged up&mdash;the manner of such
an <i>ascensus</i> was to me&mdash;a new chum&mdash;a wondrous
feat.</p>
<p>Down we went, and in time went up again: a feat on a day
indelibly branded on my memory, because we all had to put our own
shoulders to the wheel and hump, <i>i.e</i>., carry up on our
backs to our own hurt of hand and knee, each a bag of flour
presumed to weigh two hundredweight, from the bottom to the top
of the uppermost pinch. Leslie's bullocks would not face it,
hardly with an empty dray behind them&mdash;but I must not
anticipate.</p>
<p>For three days we struggled, flogged, and shouted ourselves
out of this gloomy range over&mdash;of course&mdash;"stony
creeks", "swamp oak creeks", and "flagstone creeks", rowels
worthy of the parent spur, and three clear days had lighted us
along but seven miles and a half of the way, and into the heart
of an aboriginal meeting or dwelling place&mdash;deserted of
course&mdash;which Elliot had described as "Humpy Flat". There
were some three hundred humpies&mdash;cabins formed by three
sheets of bark propped up from the open front&mdash;scattered
over this flat, which gave it a curious appearance.</p>
<p>Here, when on the point of camping, we were caught up, to my
great surprise and delight, by Arthur Hodgson. He had arrived
with cattle at the "Drummer's" soon after our leaving it. We had
parted on the 23rd of last October at the Severn Station. All
anxious to see how we had got over the range he had ridden after
us; stayed the night; confirmed the reports of a very great
depression in the business world of Sydney, and went back the
next morning.</p>
<p>"How did you like Brisbane, Leslie?" as we jogged along next
day. "You've been there already once." "Oh! nothing could have
been more friendly than the welcome on all sides, specially from
the mosquitoes, which are a greater plague there than in the
bush." "I suppose that's a welcome all new arrivals may have to
endure. One can get used to it, eh?" "Don't you believe it. Those
who have been there for years complained of the intolerable pests
as much as I did. I must just tell you about a stout old lady
whom I met in Brisbane. She was abusing the brutes as 'dratted
thingummies' one evening; so I asked her how it was she hadn't
got used to them by this time. 'Used to 'em? No,' she cried;
'they worrit my very life out. I can't keep em off, cow dung
won't, and, if that won't, what will? Why, Mr. Leslie,' she
whispered confidentially, 'when I get up o'mornings I find knobs
on my own body as big as my thimble.' I wish you could just have
seen that thimble: perhaps you will."</p>
<p>In due time we reached Limestone and worthy Thorne. There was
no difficulty in proceeding now as permission had been sent up
for the approach of any of the western "jackeroos" by Sir George
Gipps. Fifty miles round Brisbane as a centre, had hitherto been
the district under "taboo". By proclamation: it was now removed.
Thorne had by this time obtained a supply of cabbage-tree hats,
slops and general supplies, which were likely to be required by
such as we, and future arrivals: and the speculation was a
capital one for him. What fun it was to buy from the cheery
hearty storekeeper and his wife, in the first trial of his
venture. "Should you like to see the Plough Station close by: I'm
going there." "Of course." "By golly, I've not had many to ride
alongside since I've been here: but I don't like riding alone:
come on," with a loud whistle when we had got about a hundred
yards off; and after us came coursing, hopping, striding, three
noble dogs, a kangaroo and an emu.</p>
<p>What Government sheep we saw were leggy, coarse-woolled
brutes, a cross, I believe, of Merino and Teeswater. But at the
Plough Station there was a cheerful view of many acres of fine
maize. The wheat, however, had totally failed here. D.A.C.G. Kent
would persist&mdash;since he had the ordering of such
matters&mdash;in forbidding the usual, and hitherto the
successful process of ploughing in the grain when sown, and was
contented with the harrow over it. Consequently the sun gave it
no chance, being so thinly protected. The heat would turn the
uppermost soil into light dust, and the grain would not settle. A
short continuance of dry weather, in such case, parched it
up.</p>
<p>"Aye, Thorne, those are nice beasties out there!" "By golly!
they ought to be nice, considering the trouble they gave at
first; but that was before my time. Now, I'll tell you how these
cattle got here; and when I think of it, it fairly bothers my
wits, it does. Well, you know, Government down in Sydney could
nohow tell how to send us beef up here. At one time, I remember,
they wanted to send a thousand head overland, but d'ye think they
could find anyone they could trust to take them? No, by golly!
that they couldn't; and so they thought they'd try to get 'em up
by water. And so, in time, they did get together, at this very
station, about a score: one bull, the rest cows. They were bought
at a place far south of Sydney beyond the 'Five Islands'"
[Illawarra] "and brought up by coasting craft at the same time.
Nice cattle they were too, a bit old though. Well, for some
months they were watched all day, and put in the yard at night:
when they seemed at home here, orders came from Brisbane to let
'em run, and yard 'em no longer: so they seemed to settle down,
and were just looked at now and again. We were looking out for
calves and didn't care to disturb 'em. One morning, by golly!
they were all gone. There were no horses for the work, and the
man who followed their tracks got frightened about going any
farther. Look out there now, and you will see a queer shaped
looking mountain don't you?" We did so. "Well, the man came back,
dead beat: said they were making a bee-line to that queer place:
they call it Cunningham's Gap, haw! haw! haw! Why, do you see
that tree? Well, not long ago, when I heard of you gentlemen
'jackeroos' from the blacks about here, I rode, with some mounted
constables right up to it: it must be sixty or seventy miles
away, I should say, thinking to find ye in that quarter; but when
we got to this 'Gap', I tell ye, that tree" [it was not far from
upright], "that tree, I say, was nothing to it. How four drays
ever got down it knocks the very breath out of my body. You may
be sure we didn't try to get up it, though you must have been
there on the other side. But about these cattle; word was sent
down to head quarters, and some constables were sent here with
orders to follow the tracks and bring 'em back dead or alive.
Nine days after, they got back here: had got to that very 'Gap'
as they call it, and were too frightened to go on: they had some
of our blacks too with them, but when they saw what was up, they
left them one night.</p>
<p>"And so there was the very mischief about these cattle down
below: set 'em all by the ears when they had lost all chance of
fresh beef. Haw! haw! haw! soon forgot all about 'em. Now what do
you think had become of them? They made sure up here that the
blacks had long ago killed 'em all; but no, not they. These
blacks here said they would be frightened of 'em, and so they
were. By golly! they had&mdash;word was sent from Sydney nearly a
year after by the regular six months' schooner&mdash;they had,
every hoof of 'em, got back to the place they were brought from
by sea. I tell ye, it beats my brains altogether how they got
there. But that's a fact; you'll find the whole of it in the
Commandant's report. Wasn't so very long before I was sent up:
and they were again brought here the same way. That's some of
'em."</p>
<p>Some years afterwards my neighbour on the Condamine, Ralph
Gore, came to Brisbane by a steamer, by which he had brought two
carriage horses; he drove them to Yandilla; in a few weeks he
lost sight of them; while in some perplexity because of this
disappearance, he received a letter from Brisbane which informed
him that the two horses which he had landed from Sydney had been
found standing at the same wharf, one morning, quietly looking at
the river. There was no steamer alongside, or assuredly they
would have berthed themselves aboard.</p>
<p>We returned to Limestone to tea with this pleasant family. A
baby had adorned the scene since Hodgson and Elliot had broken in
upon them. The next day we rode on ahead of the drays, had a look
at Redbank and Cooper's Plains stations, and met with the now
well-tried kindness under the Commandant's roof-tree.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>About this time&mdash;I know it was at the time of this my
visit&mdash;the intimation, recent from England, that Lord John
Russell, then Home Secretary, had proposed that the squatter's
license should be raised from £10 to £60 per annum, reached me.
Rather startling to one who had, free from any personal interest,
been watching and partaking of the harass which attends the early
squatter's career in the race to something substantial, as I had
done, I could not help wishing&mdash;and of this I find a
memorandum in a letter of my own, written in 1841&mdash;that
"Lord John Russell could have seen a poor devil of a
squatter&mdash;worse than poor, because invariably in debt to
some merchant or bank in Sydney&mdash;risking everything at one
cast; spending his last sixpence, and more, too, on so cloudy a
chance&mdash;a chance dominated by catarrh or scab, which might
flourish or wither, just as the quality of a run&mdash;in many
cases not yet found&mdash;and the climate might decree; a chance
dependent, as I had seen, as much almost on the good-will of men,
overpaid for their grumbled-out service, as upon the energies of
the working, ever hard-worked master&mdash;a chance, too, I can
now-a-days say in addition&mdash;which the sanguine squatter
would strain his life-fibre to grasp and use primarily, no doubt,
for his own aim's sake, but under the consciousness that he was
unearthing a far greater treasure for others behind, than, in all
probability he should ever earn for himself, by the throwing into
the light of day unknown lands, to which his need was propelling
him; by the development of resources upon which his own foot had
first been planted, spite of dangers, hardships, hunger and
thirst.</p>
<p>Brisbane, at this time, put me in mind of what the ship was in
which I had come out, for the greater part of a passage of more
than five months, in its social aspect. The free dwellers
therein, like the passengers, cooped up within the limits of so
small a circle: thrown much upon their own&mdash;such as they
might have been&mdash;resources; glued to routine which,
affording little real occupation, palsied by its monotony: to
duties on the spot&mdash;which like the poop or quarter
deck&mdash;forbade neglect, absence, or escape, unless overboard,
seemed to have fallen out one with another, because they had
nothing else to do.</p>
<p>The Commandant's neighbour on the right hand, a little man
with a large beard, was ever in a state of frenzy about the
Commandant: the little bearded gentleman's bulletin of pugnacious
paraphrases would rebound from the impenetrable Commandant to the
little bearded gentleman's neighbour on his own right hand: from
that neighbour to that neighbour's neighbour, and so on, until
there were no more neighbours up the river: the imp of mischief
would then fly off at a tangent, nor leave one idler
un-inoculated with the virus of quarrel. Just so on board a
ship&mdash;(a sailing ship, if you please: ocean steamers were
not then believed in)&mdash;the smaller the party the more
closely connected by time, place, and dependence on one another
for a pleasant time of it, so much the more inflated the stupid
quarrels, the childish tempers, until a crisis, perhaps an
ebullition in earnest: then friends again, for a time.</p>
<p>However, all were invariably kind, cordial, and hospitable to
the "jackeroos". To a great extent the "jackeroo" intrusion had
been a blessing: "by hook and by crook" brought some together
again; stirred up their languishing, nearly stagnant springs.</p>
<p>The latter days of March were enlivened at the Drummer's by
the cheery revival of Arthur Hodgson's presence. On his way up he
had met Rogers at Patrick's Plains, on his way down. Tommy, the
black, had thought he also would like a change. So Tommy, to
Hodgson's annoyance&mdash;Tommy was so useful on the
station&mdash;had accompanied Rogers. But Tommy had to return,
and very convenient had the meeting been, as there were cattle to
be picked up on the way, and driven to the Downs.</p>
<p>"<i>Ne pleurons pas mais rions</i>! Nasty weather, old fellow.
I'll admit, but let's make the best of it!" shouted I to my
companion, Henry Hughes, of Worcester, England; of Black Creek,
Australia. Poured down the rain, persistent, pitiless pursuer, as
we slushed through the rotten ridges, and sticky flats which
prevail over the whole distance between the Condamine "Old
Crossing Place" and the Severn. On the way to Sydney! Who'd have
thought it? Perhaps to India! Who'd have expected it?</p>
<p>Squatting: sheep: stations: Wills-o-the-wisp! had been my
conclusion after the initiation into their profitless mysteries
and parasite miseries on run and road&mdash;may be to
ruin&mdash;for the last twelve months and more. South I've tried:
north too: I shall not certainly go west: and east alone, will
suit me now, I think. So heigh! for India.</p>
<p>As yet, at least, I can see no reasonable hope in squatting. I
have seen no well-managed, old-established and prosperous
station, whether of cattle or sheep: I know no more of
business&mdash;as a business man&mdash;than sheep do: and I
should be easily "fleeced" in such a matter if I placed myself in
the hands of a&mdash;well! a shearer. The only matter of business
with which my name has ever yet been mixed up was in that horrid
affair at Patrick's Plains: arrested for a promissory
note!&mdash;a thing I should not even know if I saw. No! this
squatting is but living from hand to mouth, I think: there's no
substance in it: what there may be gets, I see, into Sydney
pockets: and into them only. Such had been my burthen, in any
intervals of silence, all the way.</p>
<p>Henry Hughes, Henry and Frederick
Isaac&mdash;brothers&mdash;had been well-known to one another in
Worcestershire: had had interests in the same "Old Bank" in the
old city: made up their mind to come to Sydney together, and in
1839 found themselves owners together, by purchase, of the farm
at Black Creek, at which I had in the past year been introduced
to them.</p>
<p>They soon found that farming was a poor game: became dazzled
by the prospects&mdash;as then viewed&mdash;of the squatter's
life and vocation; placed the farm for sale: and determined to
follow Leslie, and more particularly Hodgson, with whom the
younger brother had already set forth to spy out the promise of
the land, the new name of which was in every one's mouth and
mind. So in the early part of this year, and during my absence at
Brisbane, they had arrived on the Downs on the very heels of John
Campbell&mdash;once of the "Page" Inn; then cattle-holder on the
McIntyre, from which, the blacks having driven him&mdash;he had
squatted on the station of Westbrook. [Westbrook was afterwards
bought from Campbell by Hughes, who lived on it, after the
dissolution of his partnership with Isaac: was sold in 1853 by
Hughes to Jock McLean, whose sudden death left it to be dealt
with by Arthur Hodgson (who became sole executor&mdash;after the
decease of Henry Beit, of Westbrook,&mdash;which occurred soon
after) who was at the time in England&mdash;1856&mdash;who came
out thereupon; who had station and stock put up to auction: and
who thus conveyed it, I believe, to the present Sir Patrick
Jennings.]</p>
<p>"Hughes and Isaac" had taken up and occupied with
cattle&mdash;as Campbell had done&mdash;the next creek
immediately north of that of "Westbrook", and called it "Gowrie".
Henry Denis was creeping under the west fringe of the "Range",
searching for the heads of any watercourse further north, and,
ultimately, marked that of "Jimbour", on behalf of Richard
Scougall. On the part of a friend he marked "Myall creek" for
Charles Coxen, and "Jondaryan" for himself. [It was long before
"Myall creek" was dwelt upon. The first building was put up by me
in 1846, for the use of Samuel Stewart and his family. He had
been about five years my hutkeeper at Cecil Plains, and, as I
found him bent upon setting up a public-house at the crossing
place of that creek, I so far tried to be of service to one who
had well attended to his work while in my employment. I believe
he died there. I understand that the large town of Dalby has
since risen around the spot. Charles Coxen occupied "Jondaryan"
at once upon his arrival; Denis remained in charge at "Jimbour".
I shall have to tell of his fate, poor fellow, before long.]</p>
<p>At this time Wingate had found the broadwater, which,
subsequently, gave the name of "Tummavil" to the cattle station
formed upon it by Domville (is "Tummavil" merely a liberty taken
with my old friend's name?)&mdash;by Domville Taylor&mdash;for
the firm of Rolland and Taylor; to whom Wingate&mdash;enticed by
the "Severn", where he had left his cattle <i>en route</i>, and
sick of the travelling&mdash;surrendered his claim by discovery
and "tree-marking". St. George Gore, who, with his wife and his
brother Ralph, had been many months crawling northwards with a
dray and some sheep, established themselves at
"Yandilla"&mdash;next station below "Tummavil" (as the river
runs)&mdash;upon a creek a short distance above its junction with
the Condamine. George Gammie&mdash;whom I passed months before on
the "Macdonald" river&mdash;had taken up "Talgai", and John Thane
"Ellangowan" [purchased afterwards by my present comrade, Hughes,
after Thane's death by drowning, in his attempt to swim the
Condamine when flooded], miles above "Tummavil". Owners of stock
from all quarters were pressing out now towards the newly
discovered land in the north; among others my good friend "Cocky"
Rogers, who had charge of George Mocatta's sheep from Bathurst,
and who, with some others, who wished to "hug" the nearest access
to water carriage to Sydney, ultimately was the first to cross to
the eastern side of the main range, and sat himself down on the
run of "Grantham;" then Somerville, to "Tent-Hill", of dismal
report, with sheep, of Richard Jones'&mdash;("merchant" Jones, in
Sydney&mdash;"Dicky Jones" everywhere out of it), to which he
annexed the adjacent "Helidon". Then following on in time
appeared those two estimable brothers, Frederick and Francis
Bigge, Evan and Colin Mackenzie Brothers; the McConnell Brothers;
Balfour Brothers;&mdash;but I must not anticipate. The tide was
setting in now. The intending emigrants from the more settled
parts of New South Wales were beginning to bustle into securing
nooks and corners which might escape the flood; the inert were
beginning already to play the "cuckoo" with the nests of the
energetic; the lazy to lay themselves supine on beds which they
had not laboured to make; the greedy and unscrupulous to poach on
manors of which they were not the licensed lords.</p>
<p>But I was on the way to Sydney; had I been going to St. Ives,
I should not have met with a more varied assortment of bipeds and
quadrupeds than I did on this ride. Creeping away on the same
errand, jostling each other, as if the broad bush were not road
wide enough; whip-cracking; oath-snapping; joke-clacking;
smoke-sucking&mdash;on! The dusty tribes pursued each other to
Darling Downs. To me it all seemed to be squatting-fever at a
crisis; but I had India on the brain at that time; little did I
think how soon I should be seized with the fever myself.</p>
<p>We had shuffled over more than three hundred miles, when on
one mid-day I was surprised at seeing a man riding at full gallop
towards us; unusual pace for a long journey. Up came he; pulled
up suddenly, looking me hard in the face. I was at once prepared
for another arrest. The suspicion seemed to be but too well
founded. "Is your name Russell?" in a loud tone. "Yes, what of
that?" retorted I, somewhat ill-temperedly. Dismounting, without
deigning to reply,&mdash;"Oh, he's looking for his warrant, I
suppose"&mdash;he set to work unstrapping and overhauling a
valise; opened it, drew out a paper. "Take that." "Why?" "Because
your brother has sent them to you from Maitland." I thought the
man was trying to take what I had learnt to call "a rise" out of
me. So, I offered not to take the paper&mdash;which proved to be
a dirty letter&mdash;until, in somewhat forcible language he
swore he was telling me "the&mdash;&mdash; truth!" Utterly
bewildered; my brother I believed to be in his comfortable rooms
at Cambridge&mdash;St. John's. I sat me on a log&mdash;looked at
the address&mdash;by George! it <em>is</em> his handwriting,
and&mdash;it <em>is</em> dated from Sydney! Dear old Hughes! How
hard he tried to catch me, as I went for six miles as hard as my
wretched nag could lay belly to the ground! But for its being
dead beat, I should have gone on another stretch. A standstill
among the Warland Ranges was unpleasant, when within seventy
miles of one's destination; however, I paddled on a-head of my
friend, all day and the best part of the night, until I reached
Muswellbrook, very sore in the soles of my feet, and the dwelling
of the kindly Frank Allman, who had lately been appointed Police
Magistrate there. Being in a hurry, I had left my horse in the
range, but recovered him, saddle and all, a week after. My
brother had&mdash;as I had done&mdash;found his way to Skellatar,
not a mile away. Allman sent him a line by a mounted policeman,
and in half-an-hour he walked in; gave a blank look at my face,
and asked: "Where is he?" Admitting that some five hundred miles
in fourteen days, partly on a rough-jogging sore-back, partly on
the soles of my own feet&mdash;for my boots' uppers had lost
their bottoms&mdash;might have, to some extent, affected my
garb&mdash;(a cabbage-tree hat, through which I had been fain to
let the filthy water filter, which at times I had been compelled
to drink, because thirsty; a stained red shirt outside, tail and
all, with a doubt whether it would hide that of my shamefaced
inexpressibles; a black belt in which were stuck a pair of
pistols, round the <i>tout ensemble</i>; one dusty bloody spur,
and two old boots, which covered but my instep and hoseless
heels; a long unshaven face, burnt to the color of
sienna)&mdash;yet, not viewing myself with my brother's eyes, my
spirits somehow sank at his non-recognition.</p>
<p>"There he is!" said the amazed police magistrate; "Well, here
then;" bringing his fist soundly down on my shoulder. "Well, but
what has become of your eyes?" was Sydenham's blank
ejaculation.</p>
<p>Poor old Syd! I had become so thin, and my eyes so sunken, and
my dandy-dressing now so dank, dirty, and disguised.</p>
<p>'Twas some days, I thought, before you seemed to realise that
I was I, old Syd.</p>
<p>Dear old brother of mine. Would that I had never put Sydney,
New South Wales, the bush, the squatter's life&mdash;of the
realities of which I had not had the least taste in life when I
had written in such high-flying hope and sanguine
certainty&mdash;before his thoughts.</p>
<p>A sweeter-tempered, more patient bushman: a more cheerful,
unselfish, laughing comrade, never met the troubles, losses,
disappointments, and trials of the squatter's life of that day
with so unswerving daily an exercise of the mettle of such
endowments as he did, through the few harassing years of his
sojourn in the land.</p>
<p>Dear old Vicar of Uckfield! Not so absent-minded, I hope, in
the pulpit as you were on one occasion at a rubber of whist with
that sound-hearted friend of yours, Ralph Gore, as partner; when
to the quartette horror you pitched your trump over the left
shoulder, and shot your hot black pipe and <i>what you followed
it up with</i>, into the middle of the table upon the cards
played out, and in that act of final expect**ation, won!</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:35%;">"Generous as
brave,</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%;">Affection, kindness,
the sweet offices<br>
Of love and duty were to him as needful</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:25%;">As his daily
bread."</div>
<br>
<p>We had too much to say to each other to stop long at Allman's.
We adjourned to old Nowland's Inn, and discussing
everything&mdash;slept not that night. A veil was lifted from my
despondent view. The "Bush" idea was renewed in all its first
brightness and intensity; and that of India evaporated. Stayed a
few days at Skellatar, where all was kindness, which, I fear, we
mischievously repaid by trying a new kind of air tube upon Lady
Forbes' poultry. It certainly proved to be an arm of precision:
she could not divine the cause of mortality so sudden: pot shots
out of our bedroom windows of mornings were so tempting: cook
watched and discovered the cause: gave him a sovereign to say
nothing about it, so he cooked the next victim: and the detection
at dinner one day of a wee bullet in the roasted body of a fine
young cockerel betrayed our ungrateful return for our luxurious
meals. We were very sorry, of course, but the case&mdash;though
it was treated as a joke, became a rod for our own consciences,
and no more poultry died henceforth.</p>
<p>Off we went to Sydney: my brother bought a "capital hack" *
from an acquaintance of the strange name of Pagan; I think he
was&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., Pagan&mdash;killed afterwards by the
blacks somewhere. We also bought a flock of ewes at fourteen and
sixteen shillings a head from Arthur Hodgson. There was a severe
panic in the country, and every one seemed to be hard-up.
Branches making no return to their principals' houses in London
were obliged, in many cases, to shut up; squatters in debt to
these branches were wound-up&mdash;but could'nt go on: wool!
wool! was expected to carry all over difficulties; but wool sank
and did'nt: the people could not support the going market prices
of anything, for where these so-called merchants had not shut up,
they could give no more credit, because houses in England would
no longer support unprofitable connections. Any capitalist
arriving at this period had an excellent opportunity of buying
any stock at a low&mdash;a very low price in comparison to what
had been the rule hitherto.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Trump", a grey. There were two brothers
Pagan, poor fellows. This one, Cunninghame, was killed by
<i>blacks</i>; the other, John, by <i>whites</i>, on the
Bundarrah.]</p>
<p>On the 17th June we left Sydney together. We had left our
horses at Hughes and Isaac's, at Black Creek: they had not yet
got a purchaser for the farm. On the 22nd, arrived at Skellatar:
Lady Forbes was absent, but we found her nephew, Milbourne Marsh
(at this present time Stipendiary Magistrate, having been Police
Magistrate at Dubbo, Bathurst, and at the Water Police Court,
Sydney), and his sister&mdash;now Mrs. G.F. Wise&mdash;<i>locum
tenentes</i>. They kindly asked us to stay for some races at
Bengalla, promoted by its estimable owner, Captain D.C.
Scott&mdash;late Police Magistrate of Sydney&mdash;and we passed
our time pleasantly enough until the week following, when they
came off. Helenus Scott, the Glennies, the Bundocks, and many in
the surrounding district&mdash;(I must not forget John Cox, of
Nagoa)&mdash;swelled the fashionable <i>monde</i> on the
occasion. I rode a horse of Scott's called "Hair-trigger" in a
flat, and one belonging to Cox&mdash;who was sorely hurt in the
same&mdash;in a hurdle race.</p>
<p>I have already said that to me alone can it be a pleasure to
recount the details of the then passing time&mdash;now so long
past. A pleasure, because a memory of so much which marked in our
small circle, and the cycle of occurrences therein, a happy
period to certainly most of us. I&mdash;in this attempt&mdash;am
but endeavouring to pay a debt due to old friendships and
attachments: and if I presume too far upon the patience of any
who knew not those persons or days, which I must not, for the
love of "Auld Lang Syne" put aside, I ask their indulgence and
forgiveness for the sake of the purpose for which I have set
myself this task, viz.: to preserve the <i>reliquiæ sacræ</i> of
our primitive state from obliteration, however valueless
intrinsically. Heirlooms are not the less revered and prized and
guarded by heirs, because they are not of gold or precious
stones. The little torn map which is appended to this pamphlet,
is but a "pennorth" of paper scratched over by pen and ink; but
the original speaks to me of Leichhardt, his last gift at Cecil
Plains, by and from his own hand&mdash;for to Cecil Plains he
never again came: I have nought to live on now but the past: and
so I ask pardon.</p>
<p>A month passed as a month always did pass in and around
Muswellbrook. Arthur Hodgson, from Sydney, joined us: accompanied
by a contemporary of his own at Cambridge, to which he had
migrated from Oxford&mdash;because he was too fond of the
unlawful <i>délassement</i>, said the Vice-Chancellor, of driving
Tollit's coach in from the London road. "Dick" Glover (his true
name was William Henry) had been well-known in my time as the
best "whip" in the University: was an undergraduate at University
College: until his migration. There was, in those days, a regular
four-horse coach which ran direct from Oxford and Cambridge
which, being for the most part in request by such undergraduates
who had to migrate from one to the other, under the ungentle
pressure of rustication, or failure "to put on their smalls" (in
other words to pass their "little go") bore the name, in
well-known characters, of the "Pluck Coach". Glover was son of
the then Archdeacon of Norfolk, many years before, of "John Bull"
fame. A good whip, a capital shot&mdash;the loss of one eye from
the flying of a cap, notwithstanding&mdash;full of fun, and
anecdote, he became a very pleasant companion on the road. He,
Hodgson, and we two, on the 21st of August made a final start to
the north: Allman, P.M., Matthew Henry and his brother Charles,
Marsh (who had bought Salisbury Plains from Stuart Donaldson, of
Sydney) joined us: stayed at the inn at Scone, whence we went to
pay a visit upon that noble old Gloucestershire clergyman, Morse,
and his family; and a very delightful family, too! Also, on Darby
and dear old Goldfinch&mdash;who years afterwards removed to a
station some distance northwards; not as far as Darling Downs:
next day to the Page Inn: thence to the bark-roofed and only
private dwelling at Armidale, the hospitable and entertaining
Commissioner of Crown Lands&mdash;George Macdonald. Unable to
ride, through an accident, I remained behind. At the end of a
week Arthur Hodgson came back doleful, with the news that they
had lost all their horses at Tom Perry's station, on Ben Lomond,
about forty miles distant. Hodgson was in no little degree
pressed to get to the Downs; so after a vain search for two
days&mdash;oh! how cold it was!&mdash;I remained at Ben Lomond to
continue the search, and lent Hodgson one of my horses; so he
went on leaving my brother Sydenham with me; I rode over the
greater part of New England without success, till, being lost in
the bush, I chanced upon a station, belonging to Day, P.M. of
Maitland. By the only effectual means&mdash;reward&mdash;I got
the stockman to accompany me, and with his help found them about
twenty miles away from Perry's station. The addition of three
hundred miles, which this wretched work had taken me over, was
not edifying. So we brothers, now alone, got away; lost ourselves
on the Severn country for two days, during which we, for the
first time, felt what it was to be really hungry; had a horse
bitten by a snake, but he didn't die, so we didn't eat him. The
third day, forty miles carried us to a station: no grub ready:
when it was, couldn't eat, because of starving sickness; slept it
off, however, and then we astonished the stockman's locker.
Chewing tobacco had kept us up; saw nothing to shoot but a crow,
and he was too knowing. After this, four nights in the bush
brought us to Hodgson's (the Drummer's no longer) head station,
upon the spot, where it is, I believe, to this day.</p>
<p>And a precious large assemblage of new faces found we there.
There was Murray, a brother of Lord Elibanke, Billy Barker
(afterwards on the Logan), Rose&mdash;of the Navy&mdash;son of
Sir G. Rose, and an old messmate of Hodgson's in the
Mediterranean, the aforesaid Glover, and Brooks, son of a
clergyman, friend to Hodgson's father, the Vicar of
Rickmansworth, Pemberton, and a younger Hodgson, Frank, a
brother, and our two dirty selves. To this&mdash;"Arthur's round
table" it was dubbed&mdash;came other red-shirted knighthood off
and on: Irving, of the 28th Regiment once, who was at the Peel
stores, dear old Frank Forbes (long since dead in California),
Fred Isaac, and so on. Round this "round table" in all jollity,
and flea-bitten frolic (the fleas were horrible), would sit
"fisting" damper, mutton, with quart-pot tea concomitant, from
twenty to thirty of Arthur's guests in the open air. Followed up
by the social "calumet", the fumes of which impregnated the
unceasing discussions about sheep, cattle, wool, stations.,
stores, working bullocks, blacks, and "Hell-hole" exploits, the
knights of the red shirt awakened the echoes in this gay fashion
of contentment, night after night, where silence had reigned from
the beginning. The last muttered word would usually be (as the
mummy-like rolls of blankets radiating from the central fire
became motionless), Hodgson's to Forbes: "My word, Forbes, in two
years' time we'll have Brisbane butchers begging for our wethers
at fifteen shillings a head." A pause, a struggle out of the long
sleeping shroud, and up would rise the gaunt figure of the dozing
listener: "I'll tell you what, Hodgson, I'm pre-pre-pared to
argue that point; before we get fifteen shillings a head for our
wethers out of such a hole as Brisbane, I'll&mdash;I'll bet you
fifty pounds that my balloon * will be knocking these dirty
steamers into fits. The next time I go to Sydney and come back
here will be&mdash;I'm-m pre-pared to bet you fifty pounds will
be&mdash;by letting myself down at Clifton, instead of coming up
from your 'Hell-hole' as you call it." "Bag your head, old
fellow, I want to take my corker." So Forbes would subside
again&mdash;and soon one simultaneous snore all round.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Forbes was inventing a "flying machine", of
which he had drawings and designs. Some of the aeronautic efforts
of the present day are supposed to have been based upon his
original conception.]</p>
<p>Glover, of "Corpus", Cambridge, was fuming and ever scratching
his head about what he called "that rascally Sydney!" Of the
<i>soi-disant</i> merchants in it, a man of the name of
W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e had been one of the lately "shut-up."
Glover had brought out bills from W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e's
brother's house in London on this brother here. Of course the
bills were as little helpful to Glover as W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;e
was able to be when they were presented for payment. All that
could be got for the bills was a flock of sheep near Bathurst.
How could he get there for them? In a word, Hodgson, of the
"Round Table", had come to the rescue: at least here was a
temporary home for a "Corpus" man,&mdash;and an Adullamite!</p>
<p>To cut matters short, Glover offered to go into partnership
with us, on conditions named; to put our sheep together and
"squat!" But where?"We must go see!" Granted on all sides; and so
W.N.W. from Etonvale we turned our horses' heads in November.
"Stop a bit, who comes here?" as we said good-bye. Ha! letters
from England. All right, too! the <i>quiddam necessarium</i>
forthcoming! Aye! come too! And so with light and thankful hearts
again away got we. Hodgson had consented to keep the sheep we had
bought from him at four shillings a-head per annum, which was a
further incentive to us to be quick in getting a run for
ourselves.</p>
<p>November still. Passing Gowrie, Fred. Isaac joined us,
<i>i.e</i>. Glover, my brother, myself, and black "Tommy;"
reached the furthest station, "Jimbour" (Scougal's), and beyond
that was <i>terra incognita</i>: plain "all about;" hot under the
sun, hotter because burning on all sides; poor Syd's face and
neck "blistered" and "peeled" badly; eyes suffered, too. Hard up
for water, man and horse changed the course to S.W., and fell in
an hour or two almost into a glorious lagoon at the edge of the
nearest timber. There had been a prevailing opinion at this time
that the river we called "Condamine" would prove to be an eastern
water; that the Dividing Range fell wholly away some distance
north of Jimbour; and that our Downs' water-shed would find its
way round its extreme point to the east. A week's
travelling&mdash;for we quickly rejoined the
Condamine&mdash;showed us what moonshine the opinion was. The
point was, to me at least, settled: it was a western water, and
would somewhere join the whole western system. [In course of time
this was proved.] Had it shown the least inclination easterly we
should have continued to follow down. The country was flat,
wretched, covered by enormous bricklow scrub, and so we came back
again unsuccessful this time.</p>
<p>Glover and I then attempted a start from Jimbour over the main
range with the view of examining any eastern stream running, say
into Wide Bay. The heat had knocked up so many horses, that the
others could not come. Again unsuccessful, could'nt get through
the broken country and dense brushes: brought our animals to a
standstill, and crawled back again in time, as well as we
could.</p>
<p>Taken ill at Etonvale (manifestly not climatised, yet a new
chum), Sydenham, Fred Isaac, and Irving left me there to try
another point of the compass: went to Tummavil lagoon into which
the wiseacres of that "lunatic era" declared that the Condamine
emptied itself, spreading over the plains and so becoming
exhausted in flooded seasons. How laughable it all seemed
afterwards. This was the cause of fixing Yandilla where it was,
and is.</p>
<p>They found out the absurdity on this occasion: as every one
knows all about it now, I shall enter into no details as to their
"surprises". [The result was the marking of "Cecil Plains", on
which I lived so many years afterwards.] They returned to
Etonvale triumphant,&mdash;"but," said they," it won't do for
sheep."</p>
<p>So I went into partnership with my new
acquaintance&mdash;Gerald Brooks&mdash;in a cattle station:
bought some three hundred or four hundred head from John
Campbell, of Westbrook; engaged William Orton ("Bill" of the
Severn&mdash;the Fiver), who had become free, as stockman, and
occupied dear old "Cecil Plains" very soon: and began the
"squatter's" career.</p>
<p>But the sheep? Glover must go to Bathurst for these sheep; he
must drive them over, and across country; that will take many
months; six, perhaps; this will give me plenty of time to find a
run for them on arrival; then I must go for my horse, left on the
road, knocked up at Gibson's, Byron Plains, so long ago; then
there's Syd., he wants to go on business to Sydney; he's in too
much of a hurry for a ride down&mdash;must go by sea; must get my
license too for Cecil Plains. And so in fulfilment of these calls
upon my temper and time, I worked out the year (an eventful one
to me), until I woke at the very end thereof in Petty's
comfortable hostelrie at the top of Church Hill, Sydney. 'Twas my
turn now for a new thing; so my brother on the 25th of January,
1842, entered upon his second lesson on the road overland. We had
bought no end of provisions&mdash;through Messrs. Gore
Bros.&mdash;and iron-work through Levicks and Younger (opposite
the Bank of Australasia&mdash;the old yellow bank then&mdash;the
gorgeous one now), and all that swag must go by sea, of course,
and I was to go with it.</p>
<p>I had a pleasant break at this time of the unwonted work. A
note was brought to me: "Dear R.,&mdash;Will you ride up to
Campbelltown with me? In a few days we are going to have a dinner
and dance; do come and let me introduce you to my old folks at
home. Truly yours,&mdash;<span class="a">John Allman</span>."
There's the old yellow note of January 27, 1842.</p>
<p>How glad I was to go. How enjoyable the whole ride of some two
days. Captain Allman's house was full: but all that could make
all at that merrie meeting the merrier and the merrier until morn
was done, that thought could suggest, word express, and deed
accomplish by that gay and gentle family&mdash;a fond gathering
round the old Peninsular soldier, who yet bore on his brave front
honour won and winning evidence of the slashing blade of some
<i>beau sabreur</i>, and who had endured with cheerful fortitude
a prisoner-of-war's inactivity within the walls of a French
fortress.</p>
<p>Towards the break-o'-day I retired reluctantly to my quarters,
at the only inn in the place. The sign I forget; the name was
"John Hurley." From beneath the windows of the sleeping
apartments, three in number, in one of which was my bed, the
shingled roof of an outhouse sloped to within a few feet of the
ground. Unwilling to disturb the inmates at such an hour, I
crawled up this roof to the window which I felt confident was
mine. Gently pushing up the window, a terrible voice assailed me:
"Stand! or I fire!" I fell back at the sound, for the only object
visible was a white night-cap standing up to its top-knot; rushed
to the next, and thence fled, repulsed by a fearful female
shriek; to the third, in which I found a safe refuge at
length.</p>
<p>There had been no travellers at the inn when I had left it. I
was suddenly awoke, from an over sleep, by a message.&mdash;"Sir
Thomas Mitchell did not know that it was you last night: would be
very glad if you would come down and breakfast with him!"</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell! I had seen him last in our own house in
London! I forgot to make my apologies to the lady: never, indeed,
knew who the lady was, until I met her years afterwards in the
north, and in course of conversation, the whole accident came
out. I <i>then</i> apologised.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Moreton</span> Bay was about to be thrown
open! The ban was soon to be removed! Moreton Bay was in
everybody's mouth&mdash;and mind, I thought. A steamer was laid
on by the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company! To start on
February 18th. Got all supplies on board (I can't recollect her
name): felt so ill after the work that I went to see my kind
medical friend, Dr. Wallace: wouldn't let me on any account leave
Sydney: so I had to commit our supplies to the good steam-ship,
and go back to Petty's "down-in-the-mouth".</p>
<p>The day of March 19th was one not to be sent after those
gone&mdash;and forgotten! On the evening of that day I went on
board the then largest of three new iron steamers just arrived
from England, for the Hunter River Steam Navigation
Company&mdash;the "Shamrock"&mdash;commanded by such a good
fellow. Captain Gilmore. As passengers were His Excellency the
Governor, Sir George Gipps; Major, <i>now</i> Colonel, Barney;
His Excellency's Private Secretary, Watson Parker; Aide-de-camp,
Edward Merewether, whom I remembered as an undergraduate at
University College, Oxon, when I was myself at Christ Church.
Simpson, my hospitable friend at Eagle Farm, Moreton Bay, who had
accepted the appointment of Commissioner of Crown Lands for the
district of Moreton; Jolliffe, of the navy, with whom I shall
have again to recall the accident of this meeting, and may be,
some others who have escaped from my mind.</p>
<p>The Governor had in all kindness a little while before offered
me the position which Elliot had resigned; but I, with visions of
roasting fresh rounds of beef on a hot summer's day, gratefully
and respectfully pleaded my bush engagements, and declined. The
next was the only day which the weather ahead of us allowed to be
<i>par excellence</i> pleasant. Of course we did not know how to
pass the time: a heavy gale or broken-down engine might have been
almost an agreable sensation; but we were able to get it out of
days gone by. There was Merewether with his "University" town and
gown work, and "dear old" Plumtree; there was the "Quintain" and
our club at the "Bullingdon;" "Cowley marsh" and its break-neck
night drivings; there was Harrow and Eton; "Lord's", and the
school matches on that difficult but well-loved ground owned now
by the "Mary-le-bone" men; days from Aislabie to Kynaston;
Ponsonby and Grimston, "Billy" Broughton and "Billy Warner;"
"old" Lillywhite, Pilch, Cobbett, Redgate, and Wenman; aye! in
fact, the then present passed "<i>passablement</i>" on the poop
of the "Shamrock" (but I don't think she had a poop).
<i>Faute-de-mieux</i> we went further aft, and then to our
delight found following in our wake an immense "school" of
porpoises&mdash;not the large dull heavy-tempered spouter of
Cleveland Point, but the agile black and white sea-pig which
poaches on all parts of our eastern board. Up they waved; in
twenty minutes, after saluting the stern of the "Shamrock" with a
veritable snort and Irish flourish, took to gambling about the
bows. Then a sudden thought seemed to have struck the whole happy
family: they would be sociable; they would be "in-riders" and
"out-riders"&mdash;<i>poursuivants</i>&mdash;to the new marine
vehicle of royal representativeness; they would pass on with
porpoise-speed to the new realms, the ins and outs of which their
northern brethren knew so much better than we. Flashing in
piebald race-colours astern, ahead, on port and starboard beam,
they appeared to me like boys just let out of school: no effort
in the sport, all natural; greasily glancing and glistening
beneath a few inches of the shimmering rollers; sinking with them
in the very luxury of laziness; they would neck and neck at the
next heave of the surge, spring like a horse over a five-barred
gate, or a double ditch, simultaneously (just as one may have
seen others&mdash;not altogether porpoises&mdash;in the old
"Pytchley" hunting fields of Northamptonshire), with a snort of
"chaff" and a "blow", poking fun at a neighbour in the
proceeding; and so disporting themselves that our interest in the
hunt&mdash;rather the "meet"&mdash;and the fun gave us an
appetite for some participation in it.</p>
<p>"Could you pink one of those on the wing?" said someone to me;
Jolliffe, I think. Down I ran for my rifle: I would try. Fair
seemed the chance: not much nimbler than a chaffinch or sparrow
from a trap, or a rabbit across a run, thought I: but that "not
much" made all the difference to a ball. There were no
breech-loaders and "cones" then. Disgusted and out of all
conceit, I gave it up. Then tried Jolliffe; oh, no! "'twasn't
like any boat practice he had ever seen." "Give it up, Jolliffe?"
"Give it up, aye, aye, sirree; they're all a deal too jolly to be
killed, the grunters!" Ha, ha! here we were, men proud over
snipe, woodcock, partridge, pheasant, and grouse, and couldn't
hit a big brute of a pig under our very noses with a ball.</p>
<p>"Why, what muffs you are," quietly said John Milbourne Marsh
(now Stipendary Magistrate in Sydney), who had been looking on,
smilingly (according to his fashion), "what muffs you are; give
me the gun, Russell, I'll show you how to do it!" "Two to one you
don't, if you try all day." "I don't bet." naively retorted
Marsh. We all gathered round him aft: pig after pig pursued: it
was long before they came to timber. At length a following sea
had three complacently&mdash;each <i>à son
aise</i>&mdash;sweeping along until it was about to topple: then
the triad pulled themselves together to clear the space, which
two only reached. Bang! under my ear had cut off the third. And
so Marsh taught us how to shoot a porpoise on the wing. "Try
again. Marsh," was the cry of chagrin, and the envy of
disappointment and vanity: "try again." "Oh, no," said Marsh,
amusedly, but with features as blank with surprise as our own;
"oh no, I've shown you the way: that's quite enough for me."</p>
<p>Pinking the porpoise, he had played out his purpose; in some
perplexity about the precision of his practice.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Governor happened to come on deck at the
moment of this finale. His Excellency did not often laugh, but
Sir George Gipps did.</p>
<p>The weather all the way was very hot: the Governor was very
sick. I was summoned by his voice one morning. "I heard you
calling to the steward for soda-water more than once, Russell;
are you suffering as I am?" "No! sir." "Good thing soda-water for
this horrid sickness? eh?" "Capital, sir!" In a few moments,
"Barney! do tell that steward to bring me some soda-water!" I
felt very guilty when I heard His Excellency drinking it. In a
moment the dreaded result supervened, and I felt I was in
disgrace for the remainder of the passage.</p>
<p>And so Moreton Bay was to be proclaimed&mdash;as Port
Macquarie had been&mdash;a free settlement!</p>
<p>A great and somewhat acrid controversy had&mdash;in this
prospect arisen. Was Brisbane to remain the shipping
port&mdash;in spite of the river bar&mdash;or was there any other
more suitable spot on the shores of the Bay itself? Cleveland
Point was the only alternative: and the removal of head-quarters
thereto found many advocates. "Well," said Sir George, "I should
like to see Cleveland before proceeding to Brisbane, Captain
Gilmore." So to Cleveland we headed and anchored at low tide
about a mile out from it on the afternoon of the 24th, having
entered the Bay by the Amity Point passage.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay mud and I had once made acquaintance: I sought no
renewal. His Excellency and suite were boated to the ooze as far
as the depth admitted; there was no help for it. Too heavy to be
carried, they all had to take to the water, which was more in
conformity with their tastes, it appeared through the Captain's
glass, than the mud proved to be. Floundering and flopping
through such a hundred yards of deep nastiness was quite enough
to settle the question between Brisbane and its rival. In about
two hours the tide had risen sufficiently to spare them much of
such footing on return. There may have been "deeper" policy in
timing such a visit&mdash;at lowest ebb&mdash;with a view to
prepossessing His Excellency than my simplicity had been able to
wade into.</p>
<p>The Governor had seemed much pleased at the appearance of
Cleveland Point, when we approached it. I observed that he did
not look back&mdash;as Lot's wife once did&mdash;at the haven in
dispute.</p>
<p>On the 25th his restless Excellency was off to Limestone. I
lent Watson Parker a horse, whereon to bear him company, but only
one of my spurs; he didn't seem to be at home in the saddle, and
I wanted one myself. "A pleasant ride, sir," said I as they left;
back came Merewether the next day: "Russell, that animal of yours
has thrown Parker at Redbank, and broken his collar-bone!" Fancy
my wretched "Nigger" breaking a Private Secretary's bones! I
began to think more of the Nigger&mdash;hadn't suspected so much
deviltry in the brute. Poor Colonel Barney, too, he says, is
worse for wear. That brute he rode was a rough one: no report as
to the Governor's state of feelings: but I suspected it, for on
the following day, 26th, they all came back in a boat: poor
Parker in it, stretched on a hurdle, looking very seedy: oh.
Nigger! Nigger! (dined with them at Gorman's.)</p>
<p>On the 27th&mdash;being Sunday&mdash;we all went to church,
which invisible church was a room over the Gaol! The officiating
minister was a German, whose name was Handt: a missionary on
probation: in expectancy of a grant of land, if, in twenty years,
he could show that he had converted one aboriginal black. (Time's
up! They didn't get it.) N.B.&mdash;I couldn't understand
Handt.</p>
<p>On the 28th Brisbane was baptised into the family of freedmen:
commemorated at Commandant Gorman's table by an excellent
farewell feast, for the 30th carried away "Shamrock", Governor,
and his gathering back to sea-sickness and Sydney, That day too,
if I mistake not, carried away from the pleasantest of the one or
two houses then in the wilderness of Woolloomooloo a bright bride
and a radiant bridegroom, both of whom ere April had rolled up
the scroll of its calendar, would, I fully believed, bring
new-born and unwonted brightness to the domestic hearth of
Etonvale: 'twould be a brave deed to dare the distance to the
Darling Downs: 'twas done, too: first wedded "watch" upon the
western wastes!&mdash;first "Queensland" Queen of May in
<i>Cameliard</i>&mdash;thus graced the coming of Arthur
Hodgson.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 2nd of April, my brother Sydenham arrived
here overland from Sydney: brought with him working bullocks
which he had bought on the road at £14 a head, to take up our
drays and supplies, which had preceded me by sea. Poor old boy!
he takes to the life like a trump: beats me hollow&mdash;laid up
as I am, still in a doctor's hands. The only lodging I could
get&mdash;and that under sufferance&mdash;was in the empty gaol.
On the 15th bought more workers for our drays: three days
afterwards an enormous brown paper parcel of English letters.
Goulburn, Chancellor of the Exchequer! 19th passed in expectation
of the Sydney steamer's arrival: Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Hodgson
doubtless on board: but there was no arrival but of sailing
craft: pleasant dinner with Gorman and his family, madame, and
their son: rubber in the evening: new faces with string of drays
came in: that queer old fellow. Dr. Goodwin: eccentric, clever,
and excitable James Canning Pearce, Fife, Aikman&mdash;many I
cannot recall. They had all come to meet the great
novelty&mdash;a steamer from Sydney. Heard that my brother was a
good way on his return to the Downs, but in tribulation, because
of toothache: wished I could follow and help: made an affidavit
before Gorman, which I sent to Commissioner Macdonald, Armidale:
fretting much over my compulsory inaction. What shall I do?</p>
<p>"How are you, Dr. Simpson? Wish you joy of so pleasant an
appointment!" "Well, thankee; but how are you? you look all
wrong!" Blessed meeting: Allopathy had done me no good: "Will
you, in all kindness take me in hand, Dr. Simpson?" "Yes! that I
will, where are you staying?" "In gaol!" So off we went
laughing&mdash;to gaol. I have, I think, said that Simpson had
been formerly in the 14th Light Dragoons, left the service to
study physic, a "fad" of his, travelled most of Europe, testing
Hahnemann's doctrine, in some points improved upon it: published
a treatise, clever and amusing, in England, in 1836, called "A
Practical view of Hom&oelig;opathy", being an address to British
practitioners on the general applicability and superior efficacy
of the hom&oelig;opathic method in the treatment of disease, with
cases, by Stephen Simpson, M.D., late resident practitioner at
Rome. I had read it formerly, having got it at Ballière's, 219,
Regent-street, London.</p>
<p>Dr. Simpson, when at Rome, had met with a son of the Duchess
of Sutherland in a state which physicians had at home and on the
continent in vain endeavoured to ameliorate. In acquiescence with
the desire of son and mother, Simpson took him in hand: treated
him under the new system, and having perfectly cured so helpless
an invalid, accompanied him on his return to England; fell at
once, through acknowledgment and services of his grateful
patient's family, into a good practise in London, and into the
"hottest water", which the fiery jealousy of the faculty could
prepare for heaving him into. So having given up medicine in
disgust, he went to the out of the way Antipodes accompanied by a
wife&mdash;wedded then, after twenty years' constancy to
engagement&mdash;who died on arrival in Sydney; and he by
permission had since dwelt at Eagle Farm near the heads of the
Brisbane, with his old friend and fellow hermit, W.H. Wiseman. He
now, through the urgency of the same friends in England, had
obtained a recommendation from Lord John Russell, then Home
Secretary, for the appointment, upon the introduction into which
by the compliant Governor I had congratulated him.</p>
<p>"In a fortnight you shall be yourself again, Russell:
goodbye;" and so he left me in gaol. Long before the fortnight's
end, I had become a happy convert to his "millionth part of a
grain": read his treatise again with other eyes than I had once
done, and became, indeed, myself again. In such buoyancy of
spirits under the persuasion that I had become emancipated, that
out of gaol I ran to the old windmill at the top of the ridge
opposite: crept up an uncanvassed "fly" to have a look towards
the Bay. Horror! I found myself going round: lower, lower, head
down, heels up! just as my cry of astonishment and alarm had
reached the ears of the unseen miller&mdash;a happy relief. The
unseen miller had not seen me, and so had set me going
with&mdash;how thankful I felt&mdash;with but two sails bent.</p>
<p>The 24th of April was Sunday, and no steamer yet. Everyone
said she wouldn't be laid on again for this port: and of course
the river bar on which she had stuck on the first and,
apparently, last trip, was roundly abused, and Cleveland looked
up. In the course of the day the schooner "Edward", commanded, I
think, by Captain Chambers, we heard was coming up the river. So
I went upstairs to church and heard the rev. missionary Handt
preach a sermon upon&mdash;what d'ye think?&mdash;duelling!</p>
<p>The next day brought up the brigantine "Nancy". Letters for my
brother from his friend Shakespear, and&mdash;but none for me.
Glover, though, was at the Peel with thirteen thousand sheep,
having arrived there from Bathurst without losses. The "Edward"
was at the mouth of the river. "Shamrock" has ceased running,
because the company complains that the settlers patronise the
coasters. Heard also from Downs-ward that Somerville, on behalf
of Dicky Jones, was poaching upon our station of Cecil Plains.
Our tracks had been followed, and this the result. I must appeal
to the Commissioner; and here are the sheep crawling up, and I've
not found a station yet.</p>
<p>There was a small craft&mdash;yawl I might have called
it&mdash;lying in the river: I had been told it was to be sold
cheap. Beset as I was by the claim made upon me by brother and
Glover for a run for the sheep: not believing that there was
decent country to be found in the Condamine region, and even if
there were, that the distance from a shipping port would ever be
a bar to success, I determined to buy this oyster-boat, and had
got to the point of "How much do you want for her? let me know
quickly." Lying in gaol upon a stretcher, and laying down my
plans, my fellow-passenger, Jolliffe, burst in on me: "I say,
Russell, Petrie has heard that you are going up the coast to look
for the mouth of a river, and to take up a station on it if you
can, in that rotten looking thing on the river; is it true?"
"Yes, quite." "Well, now, you know that I am on the look out for
Eales' sheep which I have left in charge of Last: I want a run,
too: will you let me join you:" Jolliffe was a sailor: therefore
an acquisition. Of course I assented on certain conditions. "I've
had a long yarn with Petrie about your going, and I will tell you
what he says: you've heard of that Bunnia-Bunnia which the blacks
here talk so much about; Petrie is the only white man who has
looked for and found it; he has a bit of its wood, you know; it's
called Petrie's Pine, and mighty proud of his discovery he is.
Well, the Governor gave him orders before he left to go to the
river on which they say it grows most, and examine it thoroughly
and report. A proclamation has been issued that no settlers are
to encroach on its quarters, and no white man is to cut down any
of it. Petrie says he must go at once; the place is on the banks
of a river, a little north of the river called the 'Morouchidor'.
Petrie says that queer-looking oyster-boat isn't fit for any sea;
he wants you to join him; and his work, your own, mine, too,
perhaps, may be knocked of? by one trip." "What boat can we have,
though?" "Why, there is a five-oared kind of mongrel whale-boat,
which was built by a prisoner here, in a fashion, which he will
take. You know that there will be no more Commandants at Brisbane
(some Government Resident by the bye is to be sent here), he will
take five ticket men to pull, a mast to stick up, and a bit of a
sail when the wind serves; the boat is new and sound, whatever
she looks like, the other thing's rotten."</p>
<p>After a little deliberation the matter was settled. My object
was to get to Wide Bay (often called White), in the conviction
that some good stream would be found running into it from the
interior; and so, after the Governor's commands had been attended
to, we were to proceed farther north, and examine the coast as
far, at least, as the Bay named; and if practicable, get on to
Port Curtis, the next place of any mark on the charts of the
day.</p>

<p><span class="a">About</span> five years before this time I was
in London. Walking from Hyde Park down Oxford-street, I observed
a man who was carrying over his shoulder one of those show
advertisements: a large wooden square frame nailed to the end of
a long pole. On the calico with which it was covered was a bright
coloured daub which represented savages with bows and arrows,
some dead bodies of white men and women, which other savages were
cutting up on the ground, and another squad was holding on
"spits" to a large fire. It was amusing enough to stop me in my
walk: horrible enough to impress the writing beneath this picture
on my mind, "'Stirling Castle', wrecked on the coast of New
Holland, Botany Bay, all killed and eaten by savages: only
survivor, a woman, to be seen, 6d. admission." Here then, it
suddenly recurred to me I am on the point of visiting the very
spot of that beastly scene, "Great Sandy Cape", which I had
afterwards heard was the real stage on which this horror had been
perpetrated, and that very spot was the eastern formation of Wide
Bay. I gathered by inquiry that a man of the name of Fraser, who
had his wife with him, had commanded the "Stirling Castle", and
another named Brown had been mate. Before long, in a very
unexpected manner, I heard the details of the whole terrible
incident from an eye-witness.</p>
<p>Excepting by surveys of the actual line of coast from seawards
nothing was yet known of the country north of Moreton Bay. While
making preparation for a start upon this excursion, that
querulous, clever, mischievous acquaintance of mine in New
England&mdash;Edward Baker&mdash;came to the settlement, and to
Petrie's house&mdash;the only open house to travellers. With him
was a late arrival from England&mdash;Walter Wrottesley, third
son of Lord Wrottesley. He had been a Christ Church man at
Oxford.</p>
<p>On the 27th I had a look at our nondescript boat. Petrie
called it a "gig": Jolliffe would not venture to give it a name:
but being a "middie" in Her Majesty's Navy, was bound to laugh at
it. Certainly, when in the water, with her full burden, her
midships rowlock was but a measured five inches above the water:
for I tried the distance afterwards. But I found that we could
step two lug-sails and carry a bumpkin stuck out for a bit of
after canvas&mdash;that was a comfort.</p>
<p>At four o'clock of the morning of the 4th of May, Wrottesley,
Jolliffe, Petrie and myself stowed ourselves away in the stern
sheets, somewhat cramped for room. I had so hoped that that
capital fellow, George Mocatta (whose sheep "Cocky" Rogers had
settled down at Grantham), would have come with us. He couldn't:
at least wouldn't. "Seven men, Petrie! Well, I hope we shall have
grub enough." Five set themselves to the oars, and we paddled
with the ebb down the river, receiving hearty cheers from some
early risers who came to see us off.</p>
<p>"Who is that man pulling for'ard, Petrie?" "Aye! he's just the
bonniest o' the lot! his name's Russell." I asked no more
questions about our companions. "Didn't you say, Petrie, that you
were instructed to take certain bearings and make a rough map of
what you see at all remarkable?" "Oh! yes, I just took care to
stow away a braw sex&mdash;&mdash; Boys! where's the sextant. I
would ra&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; "No use looking: the sextant had
been left behind: so certain observations were knocked on the
head. Dead silence for some miles: a fair wind: up stick and
straight for the north passage. After slipping along Bribie's
Island as far as its extreme point under Caloundra Head, jutting
out from the mainland further on, we had hoped to bear up into
the passage between the two, but our five-inch free-board didn't
suit on a wind in a jerky ripple; and wind and tide were too much
for oars. There was surf over the mud flat at the entrance: in
fact too uninviting for our appetites. To the eastward it didn't
look nice: but there was nothing for it but let go the little
anchor outside the first line of surf and lie there all the
night, which was very dark. A bumping swell didn't make a 'possum
sleep enjoyable: weather bettered towards the small hours: at
daylight up kedge to a nice S.W. breeze, for the mouth of the
"Morouchidor", <i>i.e</i>., "River of Swans",&mdash;black of
course&mdash;the farthest point northward yet reached from the
settlement. A pot of tea ashore was something now to think of
approvingly, when alas! we found a forbidding bar of sand
stretching across from head to head, on which a line of breakers
gave no room for even the suspicion of a passage: away again
disconsolate. "So much for your Bunnia Bunnia report, Petrie!"
The complacent breeze stuck to us, however, and the next
projection we approached, was logged down "Petrie's Head". Under
it was basking: on the smooth surface a noble turtle: but he was
wide awake enough to dive, and so escape <i>au point nommé</i>.
In the grab I made, I lost my hat, and thus losing two good
things, lost my temper too.</p>
<p>We now came in sight of and took the bearings of some
remarkable mountains westward, by means of a Kater's azimuth
compass, which I had fortunately brought. Following up the line
of coast at a distance out of some three or four miles, at a
better pace than I could have hoped for, towards the evening of
the day after, came to a headland, which formed a small bay
running inland. [In a lately published chart I think it must have
been that formed on the south side by Noosa Head.] We were
beginning to jump to the conclusion that we had reached the
Hervey's Bay of navigators, but on second thoughts the delusion
vanished. My head, from having no decent covering for it from the
sun's heat, had been splitting for some hours, and pains
intolerable were creeping through my limbs, and I longed to lie
uncramped on the sands. As we entered the bay a large mob of
blacks appeared from the low brush bordering the beach; they were
unarmed, and ran to meet us. There being too much surf for
running our boat through and ashore, we dropped the kedge in as
shoal water as we could, while the natives came through the
breakers to us. Petrie got on the back of one, who carried him
high and dry, and an ugly-looking scoundrel seeing me helpless,
manned and bore me to the beach. The others followed somehow, but
I suffered too much to care to take note; there were enough to
see to what was needful, and to see to our safety without me.
Some biscuits were given to them, and they were signed to be off;
when night approached they appeared to demur, upon which more
intelligible methods of keeping them at a distance until morning
were yielded to, on securing two as hostages for good behaviour
in the meantime.</p>
<p>I suppose I was in some sort tortured by sun-stroke; that
night was a horrible seal upon my recollections thereof. One of
the men was trying to make me a head-covering out of some canvas;
but why should my limbs torment me? Well, no explanation of the
cause could have cured me; and thus I miserably stared the stars
out of countenance with the help of the dawning day. My friends
were alarmed, but could do nothing. Our two blacks were in such a
"funk", that they kept me wakeful company throughout, though the
whites watched in turn by pairs.</p>
<p>With the sun's return came that of the natives. After much
gesticulation to the party, an old man squatted on his hams on
the hot sand, and with a queer crone began to scoop out a hole
with his hands alongside of me. I took little heed, until it had
assumed, under his vigorous and odoriferous exertions, almost the
appearance of a shallow grave. As a man under his first
"flooring" by sea-sickness, so was I absolutely careless of what
was going on around. Petrie and others gravely looking on, rifle
in hand, re-assured me on one head, yet I could realise nothing.
I believe I must have been fast becoming unconscious. What
happened I can tell, however, now. When all was ready, I learnt
that two younger natives had lifted me into the grave, divested
of every rag on my back. Our own blacks had assured Petrie that
the old man could put me on my legs again; he was too anxious
about me to repel their proffered service, as long as there was
no unreasonable means resorted to. Some large leaves of a water
plant had been brought and placed over my head to protect it, and
that again was raised upon the roll of my own clothes. Well I
remember the queer sensation of hot sand being shovelled by their
wooden Implements&mdash;"eelamans"&mdash;over me, up to the very
chin. After that I knew nothing till I came to the sense of where
I was. In fact I seemed to wake up from a painful dream. I could
move but my head. The leaves were lifted from my face, and the
assemblage at first puzzled me. Arms had been packed in with the
rest, and I was in a straight jacket of hot sand, pressed in a
solid heap upon my carcase. But I felt no pain. The perspiration
was still (for I was told it had been doing so for the last
quarter of an hour), running in tiny rivulets from my head over
my face into my eyes and ears. I was in a vapour furnace! Quickly
I was unearthed, covered with blankets or any thing that caught
their eye, and fell fast asleep. When I woke&mdash;in about six
hours&mdash;I was well! Weak, but terribly thirsty. I could have
hugged the whole tribe in my gratitude&mdash;but they were all
gone! I could see that the minds of my <i>compagnons de
voyage</i> were much relieved, specially that kind-hearted Scot,
Andrew Petrie. Some efficient head-gear had been manufactured for
me in the meanwhile, to commemorate which the hummock at the
Point was named "Russell's Cap".</p>
<p>But what had become of the blacks? They had managed to inform
my friends that about two days' journey hence a white man had
long been living with the neighbouring tribe; they themselves
belonged to "Eumundy's", a name known by report in Brisbane. This
"Eumundy" had the name of being a "great fighting man", but was
well-inclined towards the whites. Petrie had written a
note&mdash;not under the impression that the runaway could read
it, but as a token that his fellow-men were at hand, promising
these natives no end of 'bacca and blankets if they brought him
to our camp. We had now been waiting two days, and the issue
might be soon expected. The old stories were being discussed and
raked up of cruelty and punishment, which, if true, were a
disgrace to our colour and our kind;&mdash;and out of these
stories grew intelligible causes for so many having within the
records of the penal settlement escaped and disappeared,
"chancing" their lives at the hands of the first tribe they met,
and usually losing them.</p>
<p>Why were any spared? I will answer the question, by and by, in
a manner which to me, at least, was satisfactory and convincing,
under the circumstances which accompanied the explanation which I
obtained.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the third day two or three blacks were
seen coming round the bay by the beach: by the glass we were able
to make out that one who carried a spear was not an aboriginal,
though savage looking enough. Petrie and Wrottesley went to meet
him, Jolliffe and I took charge of the camp, in case of some
demonstration, for, no doubt, there were plenty of the tribe
hidden around us. The scene was curious. The poor fellow knew his
own name&mdash;Bracefell&mdash;but could not recollect his own
language for sometime; had been quite unable to make out what
Petrie's note meant, but heard enough to convince him that whites
were at hand. At first (of course I now repeat his own story,
which was told at odd times during our trip) he had felt
overjoyed at the chance open for his return to his fellow-men,
but, he declared, thoughts of the settlement filled him with
terror. For awhile he could not be persuaded that it was no
longer the hell-on-earth which he had left years before, but
tried to give every assurance that he would work "his very best"
if they would not flog him. He gradually became
better&mdash;nerved by a general promise that he should not be in
any way punished. In the past penal times the terrible "cat" was
mercilessly wielded over recovered runaways, in ready attendance
upon heavy leg-irons day and night. He soon made himself useful
in explaining to the blacks that we came with no hostile intent;
had no wish in any way to molest them and, probably, saved us
much trouble by so doing in all earnestness. By the natives he
was called "Wandi", a "great talker;" could speak the dialects of
four different tribes (and it seemed that each tribe differed
more or less in the manner of language and expression); would
take his part in the fights, which seemed to be frequent with
their neighbours, but had never been persuaded to turn
"cannibal". He was in looks an old man: his hard life had added
its brand to the years of his seamed features. When washed and
clothed, in a few days, he became perfectly naturalised; had
recovered much confidence, and appeared to be really glad at
having been rescued.</p>
<p>Of the coast of the mainland between Cape Moreton and Sandy
Cape little had hitherto been known. No survey of it had under
any close examination from seawards been made: none whatever from
landwards. Petrie being in the service of the Government, and
acting under Sir George Gipps' instructions, considered himself
authorised to name mountains, headlands, or any remarkable spot
not yet distinguished on a chart as he thought fit, with the view
of sending in his report, under which such designations would be
printed upon the Government maps. The low bluff which formed the
southern and most eastern point of the sandy bay in which we were
he called "Bracefell's Head" (now Noosa Head), being most
suggestive of the occurrence which had so much pre-occupied us of
late. From a higher ground further back we could see several
noteworthy eminences which we had remarked from the boat when
following the coast line. Of these Bracefell told the native
names, which were written down on the spot. The furthest south
and west in sight was "Mandan:" between that and ourselves,
beginning at the most distant were Caroora, Coollum, Coora,
Yuro-Yuro, Eirange, and Boppol, the last named being a long way
to the north-west. The next headland to the far north was named
"Brown's Cape", it being the spot on which, we were assured by
Bracefell and the blacks, Brown, the mate of the "Stirling
Castle", had been killed and eaten. It proved to be the most
prominent headland south of the southern entrance (as soon was
found) into the channel between Hervey's and Wide Bays, and is
now marked down "Double Island Point". The signal fires were
rising rapidly in every direction from native camps, doubtless
telling the news of our arrival, and the surrender of
Bracefell.</p>
<p>This man had managed to escape * from the chain to which he
was manacled with others, not long after the arrival of Captain
Logan, as "Commandant" of the penal settlement. He was living
with "Eumundy's" tribe, in which we had now found him, at the
time of the wreck of the "Stirling Castle" on "Great Sandy Cape".
The casting away of this ill-fated vessel was a signal for a
general gathering of all tribes within reach. Bracefell declared
that they came in from hundreds and hundreds of miles all round,
and had a grand "tourr". "Eumundy", who was, I conclude, king of
the tribe, was with his people, at this rendezvous. The number
assembled must have been unusually great&mdash;as the occasion
was in their estimation. Captain Fraser, and some of the crew had
been killed, for some cause, which was not explained; Brown, the
mate, was reserved for future deviltry. The Captain's wretched
wife was spared, and had become "domesticated". It was the
possession of this white woman, and the prospect of plunder, that
had made these "outsiders" so eager to reach the scene of horror,
and thus dare an invasion of a district on which, in fact, they
knew they were trespassers. To open the ball, there was a general
"tourr", alias "corroboree", in the good fellowship of common
rejoicing.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Shown afterwards by the Penal "Records."]</p>
<p>This "tourr", to which I afterwards walked with Bracefell at
the back of "Brown's Cape", had been a ring scooped out of the
soil in the fashion of a "circus" of an immense size. The earth
so collected formed a low mound, which enclosed it all round the
circumference, except at a point from which a path ran about a
hundred yards into the thick underbrush, at the end of
which&mdash;for it was a <i>cul de sac</i>&mdash;had stood the
round low-roofed habitation of Mrs. Fraser.</p>
<p>Putting aside the torments of her bondage, Bracefell assured
us that she was compelled to drag in wood for fires, and fetch
water with as much cruelty as the "gins" themselves. He was
(Bracefell said) never allowed to speak to nor approach her. Her
sufferings were terrible: he was always thinking of how she could
manage to get away.</p>
<p>Gathering from his yarn at odd times, that the first good
fellowship quickly wore away; feuds sprung up: by waking up to
jealousy of intrusion frequent fights came on, and off, in which
some were killed and eaten. So tribe after tribe began to
disappear or return to their own "<i>penates</i>." Eumundy was
among the number who still lingered: he was so redoubtable a
warrior that I think his presence was tolerated with discreet
respect. Food had become scarce, and was becoming scarcer every
day, too, where so many had assembled themselves. Under the pinch
of empty stomachs the "baggages" too would sneak away to forage
for themselves: and so&mdash;it is quite
intelligible&mdash;"Wandi", the great talker, found at length
opportunities for interviewing poor Mrs. Fraser. Her misery and
want would soon have killed her: but the new-born hope of escape
by this man's help brought back some courage. The occasion came.
Food had come to famine prices, I concluded, when one by one they
were forced to roam about after honey, or scratching into
ant-hills for the sweet little eggs: or tearing up grass-roots:
or diving to the bottom of water-holes for the bulbs of the
water-lilies, for a meal. Game&mdash;marsupial, but as
keen-scented as our own Highland deer&mdash;had deserted the
land: the bunnia was not bearing.</p>
<p>Well, "where there's a will, there's always a way," the will
of the one helpless creature being nerved by her tremendous
desolation: of the other by prospect of large reward, and that
which under the despairing cry of the woman, had become "father
to his hope"&mdash;viz., the recovery of liberty by pardon, in
return for this risky service to an Englishwoman.</p>
<p>The way was found. She managed to escape the eye of the
famishing creatures around on every side: met Bracefell at an
appointed spot: with bent bodies waded they along a running
brook&mdash;here deep, here shallow: eyes and ears
fright-quickened, hope-sustained: grasping every dear chance, by
stone or stream, of passing over the treacherous ground without
track of footfall, or fraying of grass or shrub, they reached a
rugged range and hid themselves among the rocks.</p>
<p>Bracefell turned to good purpose the native gifts bestowed by
savagedom: fed his fellow fugitive on such bush diet as his
wood-craft could compass, eluded the pursuit, and in a few days
both set foot on a pathway well known to the hopeless, desperate
runaway a few years ago.</p>
<p>It is hard to accept the belief that under the reaction of
supreme joy upon deliverance from such an agony of life as this
woman's must have been, it could have been possible that any
human soul should be possessed by any other power but that of
unspeakable priceless gratitude to the worker out of such a
restoration to kin and country.</p>
<p>Yet I must accept it; nor I nor any of my friends did, or did
since question the truth of Bracefell's story. Whether, as step
by step she drew towards her asylum&mdash;with fears weakening,
hope strengthening, dependence vanishing, faculties
freshening&mdash;whether any doubt of her ability to honour her
promises, fulfil her engagements, deliver her own soul by
successful prayer for her outlawed benefactor's pardon and
reward.</p>
<p>Again, whether on approach to the paralysing scene of his
unendurable helplessness, the entering within the brandish of the
shrieking scourge&mdash;within the clutch on arm and ankle of the
scalding iron&mdash;the riveting to the comrade chain&mdash;began
to "clam" the glimmer of his hope. The assurance sprung out of
his voluntary service; partly, too, in compassion to a free,
respectable British female citizen&mdash;whether the magnitude of
such reward proportionally lessened his hope of getting it, or
his <i>protegées</i> ability&mdash;perhaps unwillingness&mdash;to
make so grand an effort for such an end, and such an
outcast&mdash;who can tell?</p>
<p>"What?" said he: "as soon as we got on that path: as soon as
she could see horse tracks, and trees cut down lying about, she
knew she was at 'Meginchen' (the natives' name for Brisbane). I
told her of all she said she would do when we got in, and told
her I should like to hear all of it over again (with true
cunning). She wouldn't speak; when she did as we went on, she
said she would complain of me."</p>
<p>"I turned round and ran back for my life!" Well do I even now
recollect the look of vindictive savagedom which accompanied this
part of Bracefell's story. Speaking to him as I did day by day,
watching for contradictions&mdash;not on this matter only&mdash;I
became impressed with the persuasion that he had not made up a
story in this, nor any other instance where I was seeking the
truth. I believed him. In the episode just told, his excitement,
manner, words, were too natural to be assumed for any
concealment's sake&mdash;had there been anything to conceal.</p>
<p>Under whatever impulse it was&mdash;he went back: seven years
afterwards, or thereabouts, we found him with this tribe
again.</p>
<p>"By a feigned condition"&mdash;incredible as it may be to
commonsense&mdash;I know that she imposed upon the credulity of
London, not far from a year afterwards.</p>
<p>"Were you not afraid to return after taking her away?" "I was
at first," answered Bracefell, when he had told me the sum of the
above: "not so much though, as I was of the settlement. After I
got away there was a fight, too: but the woman didn't belong to
us, so they didn't care about her bolting, and I've been with
them ever since."</p>
<p>The fair weather followed us. A black crony of Bracefell's
accompanied us in the boat, when we left this to us (to me
especially) eventful shore. When we rose up in the morning, to
our surprise there was not a native to be seen&mdash;except
Bracefell's friend. They may be up to some mischief. "Planted in
the bush round us!" "Where are my breeches?" cried out one of our
five. They were gone. So were the blacks in possession. What
could the thief want with breeches in such warm weather? The
bright buttons had caught their eye.</p>
<p>We ran up the coast that day; many miles it was steep sand.
Signal fires more numerous than ever. We reached the headland,
which we had already written down "Brown's Cape". Saw no natives;
and at a glance it appeared to me to be but solitude and
desolation.</p>
<p>From this took the bearings of Boppol and several other points
to the N.W. Bracefell pointed out the entrance into Wide Bay from
the south, between the mainland and the southern point of Great
Sandy "Island" (now named "Fraser's") which bore N. by E., about
fifteen miles distant.</p>
<p>Nothing whatever was at this time known of a southern entrance
into Hervey's Bay, nor of any channel on the west side of what
was called&mdash;but had never been proved to be&mdash;"Great
Sandy Island". An Admiralty chart of 1835 had the northern
entrance into "Hervey's Bay", but manifestly it had not been
known that what was laid down as its southern shore was what we
found it to be,&mdash;a mere islet's overlappings which hid the
connexion between the bays&mdash;Wide and Hervey.</p>
<p>The following morning carried a fair wind towards a southern
inlet which Bracefell had spoken of. No blacks had made their
appearance until after we had got away; they suddenly showed
themselves, and then followed us by the beach, a long way
round-about. "What could they have been looking out for?" I
thought more than once. My silent inquiry was soon answered.</p>
<p>Bracefell had more than once warned us of what he could only
express by a "big bubble". We could see no surf or "breaking
water" appearance ahead: kept well outside the line of "curlers"
which in beautiful rank and order cut us off from any present
landing, spinning their rainbow manes aloft like warhorses.
Breeze fresh from S.W. sent us along sweetly, while we hugged the
shore thus until we neared a sandy point on the mainland. Here we
came up to the wind to round it, and at once found ourselves in
Bracefell's "hot water".</p>
<p>A sandy spit was running out a mile or more, and we were in
the midst of heavy breakers in a moment. It looked unpleasant: to
keep on was our only chance of getting through the "bubble", and
yet the consciousness that the blacks were only waiting to make a
meal of us, if capsized, did not add zest to the appetites which
but a few minutes before we affirmed to be ravenous, looking
forward to our own dinner. We safely&mdash;we had got our sweeps
out&mdash;followed over two heavy seas, which gave us a little
breathing time, and pushed her with a few vigourous strokes into
a strong southerly current. In, over, and out of this nasty place
before we knew where we were, into smooth water, and a long reach
between the mainland and opposite shore.</p>
<p>We found ourselves in a deep channel, which was easily traced
by the eye. It entered this bay by the outermost edge of the
sand-spit, and seemed to be water enough for any ship. We could
get no sounding with an eight-fathom line.</p>
<p>Upon a bright beach of white sand&mdash;above what is now
called Inskip Point&mdash;which shelved quickly into deep water,
we landed. We had shipped some salt, but wanted fresh water
and&mdash;something to eat. Jolliffe and Petrie walked by the
sands to have a look at the "Spit;" Wrottesley, Bracefell, and
the men&mdash;white and black&mdash;for a search, carrying the
kegs; I was left to look after the boat and blacks Behind me was
an old camp; before me the opposite shore&mdash;about a mile. A
long wash up the deep shelf kept me on the alert, to keep the
boat off. I suddenly saw a canoe shoot away from the point over
the way full of men. While intent upon their movements, a heave
brought the boat broadside on almost to my very feet, leaving her
to turn herself over upon her keel. I had the satisfaction of
seeing all effects not made fast&mdash;guns, my own carbine, and
some bedding&mdash;quickly subside. What could did float about in
a most irritating manner. The powder was in water-tight cases.
The next wash helped her off again, and, having kedged her out by
the stern, I had the pleasant work of picking up the bits. By
this time the canoe, paddled by two men standing, was half way
across. Feeling bound to salute, I seized the only unloaded
weapon I could find, an old Government flint musket, a veritable
"Brown Bess". Wishing to make a noise I dosed the old thing with
an unreasonable charge. (The other lire-arms were loaded, but had
been some while under water, and that was inconvenient.) Rammed
home an old fashioned ball, and, having filled a "pan" big enough
to hold a "peck" of priming, let fly in the direction of the
attacking force, while I, to my consternation, flew in the other,
and had to pick myself out of a comfortable sand <i>fauteuil</i>
into which Bess had blown me. The ball played ducks and drakes
over the water, and my friends sheered off to the left until I
lost sight of them behind a sandy point beyond which they were
intending to land. Unable to see any of my party returning, it
was, it seemed, time to take care of myself. Having given "Bess"
a second, but less unreasonable, charge, all that remained was to
sit quiet, watch, and wait. In about a quarter of an hour the
first of about a dozen blacks, walking in single file, appeared
round the point. They appeared to be unarmed, but on looking
through my glass I detected their spears, which they were
dragging on the sand by the end jammed in between two toes. When
I rose and took "Bess" in my hand they suddenly&mdash;and
simultaneously&mdash;picked up the spears, and, having stuck them
upright into the sand, advanced, holding up the right hand. Of
course I had to follow suit, and went to meet them in the same
confidence. I didn't like it though. When within a dozen yards I
"squatted" again, and, having some cigars, fortunately, lit one
and smoked, made signs to the leader to do the same, which he and
the rest at once did; and having stuck a weed into his mouth,
told him by signs to suck, which he did with such energy that,
with one choking gasp, cigar, smoke, and&mdash;never
mind&mdash;was propelled nearly into my own face.</p>
<p>However, he seemed to like it, for he tried a second time, and
took to it like a baby. "No one coming back yet? What on earth
shall I do to keep them distrait?" Happy thought! When I was
leaving England the streets of London resounded with the popular
song, fathered upon "Jack Sheppard", of highway repute, by a
newly-published novel which bore his name. Dinned into one's ears
at every corner and at every turning, it was not surprising that
the jerky air to which the words had been set should have taken
hold of one's retentive faculty. So, at the top of my voice,
which I hoped might reach the ears of some of my returning
companions,! gave them, in all solemnity&mdash;unfeigned
assuredly&mdash;the first part of "In a box of the stone jug I
was born&mdash;fake away!" and, on arriving at that impressive
chorus, "Nix, my dolly, pals!" it struck me that it might be
suitable to imitate their corroboree-action, and set to work to
slap my own thighs with undesirable vigour. At once they did the
same. The "flat" sound almost made me deaf to further theatricals
on the part of some fifty more vagabonds who had been at hand all
the while in the scrub behind me. But for my "funk" I could have
roared at the sight of some sixty naked humanities so gravely and
earnestly occupied on their own&mdash;counters. We kept it up,
both sides, I have little doubt, thinking "What shall be done
next?" when to my gladdened sight hove the rest of my associates,
whom&mdash;it had suddenly struck me&mdash;these rascals may have
knocked on the head, and I only remained to be disposed of!</p>
<p>Bracefell and my visitors evidently had been old cronies. They
seemed overjoyed at seeing him again, and all suspicion on both
sides disappeared. However, after the breeches and buttons
incident we did not allow them to assist in re-collecting and
stowhig the moist variety of our boat's contents: their anxiety
to do so betrayed their wish to exercise their fingers in picking
and stealing. Their cupidity was intensely roused, but our
vigilance was equal to the occasion. Their numbers soon
increased, and good fellowship was the order of the day. As a
token of brotherhood the greatest compliment we could pay them,
we were aware, was an exchange of names: such ceremonial
accordingly, we politely requested them to participate in; which
they showed themselves so ready to do, that it became difficult
for us few to gratify so many claimants' desires, with the
inevitable result of scarifying our own noses in token of the
prominency of our esteem.</p>
<p>By our now cheery and loquacious go-between, Bracefell, an
understanding was arrived at, and after many loud addresses and
gesticulations, more intelligible to me than their words, each of
us was in course of time confronted by a <i>vis-â-vis</i>, who
looked as anxious as many a young <i>debûtant</i> in his first
ballroom quadrille. The irrespressible amusement on the faces of
Wrottesley and Jolliffe, no doubt appeared upon mine also:
Petrie's features were immovable: I suppose he was used to it and
lost the fun of the thing. See what it was to be "three new
chums", able to enjoy novelty! My <i>vis-â-vis</i>, who engaged
my attention more wholly than many a young lady partner had on
other occasions, was a slight, pleasant looking, well shaped
young man, who as soon as I confronted him closely, with due
decorum, put the forefinger of his right hand to his nose, and in
appreciation of the solemnity of the scene, rubbed it. I had been
"coached" by Bracefell, and as religiously rubbed mine, in
deference to his example. He then transferred from his own to my
respected organ&mdash;the sense of which did not quite acquiesce
in the contract&mdash;a like digital honour, which I vigorously
reciprocated: suddenly he ceased burnishing and cried, "Boralee:"
gladly I held hard with "Russell".</p>
<p>I was delighted to see that he could make nothing of my name.
His nearest approach was a very corrupt reading. One repetition
of such frictional discipline, self-inflicted, one more jubilant
shout of the sign of adoption, and we severally had (nominally)
transmigrated. I then found that I was of the exalted caste of
"Terwine", next in grade being the "Barang" and "Poonta"; the
ladies of such castes being "Terwine-gan", "Baranga",
"Poonta-ran". When all was over, the whole mob&mdash;as if by a
signal&mdash;simultaneously burst out into fits of loud
laughter!</p>
<p>As an earnest of their friendship, I presume, they then
offered us a present of blackfellows' bones, from which they had
but recently scraped the last delectable morsel. They thought,
poor wretches, that it was the most delicate attention they could
pay to our new relations; and their feelings were astonished and
hurt by our declining to accept the memorial, and more so when we
asked for the bones of the white men killed and eaten some years
agone. Those they did not think worth preserving as relics of
their "Auld Lang Syne", but they declared they were to be found
on the beach on the other side of the land opposite. We had no
time for such a search.</p>
<p>My dear double&mdash;whose name I had usurped&mdash;plainly
expected some memorial of this auspicious meeting. I had to make
a heavy deduction from my daily allowance of smoking, in order to
supply his quickly acquired taste for the pipe: to run the risk
of being cold o' nights, by requesting him to accept one of my
two blankets: but his eye was too wistfully fixed upon my
inseparable companion, the knife which I had brought all the way
from England. I had to do violence to my affection by sticking to
it, though he stuck to me to the last moment of my getting into
the boat to make a fresh start up the bay.</p>
<p>Bracefell had asked one of them to come, under the impression
that he would know all about the nooks and corners of these new
shores, and eyots, which would probably be numerous as they were
in Moreton Bay. More wished to accompany us, and would take no
denial less than that expressed by a sharp rap with the back of a
tomahawk on the knuckles, which clung to the gunwale even in deep
water.</p>
<p>With a fair wind we slipped up the passage some miles, and
then landed on the eastern shore with western aspect. By this
time, finding myself near the scene upon which I hoped to
commence operations in the way of river and run-hunting, Petrie
was good enough to give me all the help in his power; accompanied
me to the high land, the backbone of the island, and on reaching
it, to the top of the tallest tree that we were able to climb, to
get, if possible, a <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> of land and water. On
all sides we had been told that there was "ban tabil" (salt
water) and big river, pointed out towards the north. From the
tree was to be seen what we thought was the mouth of a river;
intervening were no end of mangrove islets, among which strangers
might be a good deal bothered. So far buoyed up returned to the
boat by sunset; rejoined our camp, turned in with the sleep of
the weary, but under some feeling of distrust, kept watch in
pairs throughout the night, on what was now "Our Island".</p>
<p>As I go on gathering up the crumbs, with which a few chance
notes written at the time feed my recollections, I now and then
stop dead short to ask myself "is not this a silly task you are
setting yourself?" Every inch of that island, bay, channel, and
river, which were forty-five years ago new and strange, have been
by this time examined, traversed, and ransacked, and are but
common-place, uninteresting matters now-a-days. And yet there are
many who take an interest, not easily explained perhaps, in
comparing the former with the present condition of places and
people, and things. I take up, for instance, the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>, and in it I continually meet letters,
lectures, publications, and pamphlets which set forth the early
time of Sydney in a variety of shapes; and I suppose many besides
myself read them with pleasure, made up of curiosity and pride of
country. And so, self-taught, I pluck up confidence to go on,
having dared to begin.</p>
<p>Must I tell how, ere Aurora had left her saffron couch, we
pulled out some few fathoms from the shore, which distance we had
barely reached before the dark veil of a mist, so dense that,
except the water immediately about the sides of the boat, nothing
out of it could be distinguished. Yes, I must do so, for such a
marvellous screen may be a novelty, even in Wide Bay. No
description by writing nor wordiness could have conveyed to my
senses what that imprisoning shroud itself did. There was an
unnatural loneliness only disturbed by the blob up of a turtle
head, and the quick splash of fright at its nearness to us, or
the flurry splash of the silvery king-fish in pursuit of small
fry: until the very isolation and helplessness of the position
became exaggerated by the sleepy fancy that we were cut off from
the rest of the world, and knew not where we were. A sudden
chorus of&mdash;(I suppose I must use the conventional
term)&mdash;"coo-ee's" was a positive relief: and the sound came
on our ears as if close by in the impenetrable cloud. First,
shouts of surprise, then of anger, then of general
excitement.</p>
<p>I think it well here to say that every man and woman in each
tribe to the northward have their distinguishing call, or
"cooee". By this means the whereabouts of one another in the
bush, individually can be heralded from a distance hardly
credible to white men. I never heard a call of which the sound
approached or resembled the popular "cooee". Some, indeed, were
intonations of many syllables.</p>
<p>Of course we came to anchor. Invisible as we were to the
mischievous eyes around, there was little need of watchfulness;
the lonesomeness induced silence; the two combined, sleep; and so
we, pilgrims of the Pacific, in piebald pairs&mdash;black and
white&mdash;one by one parceled ourselves on our 'possum pallets.
In three hours I was the first to awake and find ourselves still
sealed up in the same envelope. Some enormous turtle amused me by
the sudden protrusion of their heads, now and then, positively
within reach, but to "bag" one was my repeated but vain attempt.
Turtle steaks simmering in the calipee were agreeable visions,
but barmecidal feasts in this instance. I had not then learnt, as
I did afterwards, how the turtle was to be taken captive in the
water&mdash;and when I had learnt found one must get up very
early in the morning "to catch a turtle napping."</p>
<p>Mid-day gave "Beegie"&mdash;the sun&mdash;power to force his
way in ghostly guise a wee bit into our aqueous armour. The
surface of the unwrinkled water now seemed to have become one
with the embracing cloud&mdash;absorbing and
absorbed&mdash;inseparable. The union had the semblance of
substance and solidity. The upper sucking of the intense
breezeless heat, for a moment had exposed a wonderful sight: a
field, as it were, of frozen snow, perfectly level, far away, and
all round us, pressed down compact, immovable upon its kindred
wastes:&mdash;yet but for a few moments. Before one's eye could
realise one thousandth part of the glory of such an illusion, it
had vanished, resolved into the elements.</p>
<p>Hardly had we looked upon the world of nature, to which we
felt like beings restored, ere a sharp whisper from the
north-west gave a hint that our canvas would no longer help us.
The smooth water, under the same influence, rippled away the
steam with which it had sweated so many hours, and the breath
which had proclaimed the coming passed on to make way for the
presence of the wind in strength. "Out sweeps, my lads!" 'twas
hard work for the rest of the day: wind and tide strong in our
teeth: but which way are we to go? We now found that the black
who had accompanied Bracefell from Brown's Cape knew less about
the mouth of the river than we did, after our perch in the tree
yesterday.</p>
<p>From our elevation we had then seen how numerous and pell-mell
were the low mangrove islands through which we had to thread our
way ere we could emerge upon the open water into which our
supposed stream flowed. On this level how much greater the
perplexity, may be taken for granted. Whatever our black
companions may have known of the country back from the coast,
they evidently knew nothing about the water which skirted it.
Taking out our Admiralty chart, already referred to, it became no
matter of surprise, while viewing the chain of islets close a
head overlapping each other in such puzzling persistency that
from a ship some miles away in the offing, they should have had
the appearance of an unbroken line of coast.</p>
<p>In and out, as rabbits in a warren&mdash;north, south, east,
west&mdash;not for twenty minutes together could we keep one
course but that of the "burrows'-bent." Pulling, straining,
panting, shouting, the reliefs&mdash;for all hands took a turn at
the oars except the lazy natives&mdash;would take the places of
the relieved, who, of course, brought discomfort to an end by
smoking. Now and then a passage would trend more complacently in
the way of our wish; wheedle us almost imperceptibly out of it;
encourage us with a more compliant promise, and deliver us into
the arms of so many similar channels, that picking and choosing
had no more guidance than the story-jackass had between the two
trusses of hay. If ever my old shooting companion and friend
(what a good shot he was, too, specially snipe!)&mdash;if ever, I
say, my old cheery friend Sheridan, for so many later years
resident in or near Maryborough&mdash;take up this, I can fancy
his "wondering that we should have been so bothered." Well, I
suppose, if I were ever to see the same place again I should
wonder too. But then we didn't know the way, and now we do! A
labyrinth of inlets, which just created islets; a maze of mud and
mangroves; horrid, through the ebb, with that misery of miniature
marling-spikes&mdash;"cobbler's" pegs&mdash;which scalded our
shoeless soles as the hot chestnuts did pussy's paws; myrialy
fecund, feculent hotbeds of the vicious, bloodthirsty, jeering
mosquitoes, which in their countless hosts "pinged out" their
p&oelig;ans over our prostrate, poorly apparelled persons: tack
all this diablerie on to our doubt, disappointment, and day's
doubling and ever-redoubled delusions, do I make out no fair case
in apology for my petulant recalling of the rebuffs, which almost
paralyse patience and perseverance? Sand and mud, mud and sand,
was the sole diversion, beyond a solitary attempt to "bag"the
most perfectly beautiful specimen of the gigantic crane that I
should think had ever stalked on stilts. I was successful in
"bagging" neither the splendid bird nor my own ill-humour.</p>
<p>Camp we must somewhere! and camp we did, on one of these mud
magazines of abominations. I must not, out of deference to eyes
polite, emblematise the expressions which too generally
anathematised the "cobbler's pegs" which pitilessly punctured our
defenceless feet as we paddled to and fro, bearing each our
burden: I must not question the comfort of a roomy seat and more
elbow room by rehearsing the accompaniment to each "squat" upon
the slimy ooze, nor shall the harmony of our party's "singing
out" be now and again recited in appendix to the insect chorus
which assailed our ears all night long, forbidding sleep by a
perpetual encore.</p>
<p>Yet even in this forbidding grove there was a thing of beauty,
which albeit insect, took no part in the common discord, nor the
defiance of our distress. On every twig and leaf breathed out in
regular pulsations the tiny flames of myriads of fire-flies. At
times becoming languid, or lazy, I would shake a branch, and the
glory of each living gem would at once quicken into activity and
rivalry with its innumerable associates, to my delight, and the
dissipation of nocturnal <i>ennui</i>. Truly it was a spectacle
of loveliness, of which such a charnel seemed to me a strangely
unsuitable abode. The bright blue sparks which respired at
intervals of five or six seconds, whether flying or settled,
could throw a soft light around to the distance of a foot
certainly: perhaps their enjoyment as well as their function that
of brightening dark and dismal dens. Confident in the
inattractiveness of our encampment, we kept no watch that night.
Attempting to walk a few yards in the dark to look for more
fire-flies, I tripped over what I thought was a stone. What! a
stone in such a bed of mud and slime! how strange! When the dawn
revealed the full beastliness on which we had made our bunks, I
looked for my stumbling block, and found a large piece of pumice,
the fellows of which were lying about in all directions. Whence
had it come? These islets had evidently been shaped by deposits,
rounded up by many small maelstroms, the conflict of opposing
currents. The mud must have come from inland, but not so the
pumice: ergo! there must be some largish river disgorging its
soupy floods into this wide basin, in which the adverse tides
have churned the pats of the river's soil. But where, oh! where
is this river?</p>
<p>Again, having awaited the full rise of tide, we tried to fit a
key to the lock we had failed to pick yesterday. And this key, it
was suggested, might be found by the guidance of the strongest
current of the ebb. A queer slap in the face for this happy
thought, soon came by the consciousness that we had got into ebb
currents, which ran round and round with such speed as to lunge
us into greater perplexity than ever. As a colt for the first
time subjected to such breaking-in discipline&mdash;in like
manner were we bewildered. Thinking to let the boat take its own
way with the rapid stream, and patiently wait upon its will and
word, we went along merrily between mud pies, which rose to greet
us with their unsavoury sight, as if the bright tide had sickened
at them; we heeded nothing in our listless bitterness, until with
one general outburst of indignation and disgust we recognised the
wayside station at which we had got out and rested the night
before.</p>
<p>"By Penelope! it's a fact!" ejaculated Wrottesley. "Why
Penelope?" asked I testily. "Well, you know, Russell," replied
he, with his smile of unruffled composure, "didn't she spin a web
and undo it again?" My school-room grin at the reference took the
wrinkle out of my ill humour, and as it was catching, we got into
a laugh, dropped the kedge, ate, drank, and had a smoke.</p>
<p>"But, I say, Wrottesley, <em>she</em> was waiting to find out
something; so are we; where's our Ulysses, eh?" keeping up the
badinage of school-days. "Ulysses! why, haven't you heard," in
triumph, at "capping" my question.</p>
<p>I had not heard. Bracefell had been some days in loud and
somewhat excited "talkee" with his Brown's Cape friend: and from
him had assured Petrie that there must be another white man with
a tribe whose run was mostly on a large water&mdash;pointing to
the north-west. Anxious as I was to break through this labyrinth,
I had taken no part nor interest in aught else. So I was little
prepared to be pulled up by the probability that there was a
typical Ulysses whose rescue we might manage to
compass&mdash;dwelling upon the banks of the very river, perhaps,
the mouth of which we so much wished to find. What a help he
would be to me, I thought in silence, in exploring this river,
discovering such parts of it as may be fit for our sheep.
Jolliffe, who had at once caught hold of the tail of the same
advantage, joined with me, and our eagerness to get on was
redoubled. "I shall call this horrible, delusive island 'Humbug
Isle'," was Wrottesley's last word and look as we pulled away for
another attempt. "I, 'Gammon Inch'," said I, a suggestion which
my good Scotch friend jotted down with the ghost of a smile.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">I have</span> already referred to the idea
which prevailed on Darling Downs that the Dividing Range fell
wholly away to the northward, and that a system of waters would
probably be found which delivered itself into the Pacific, after
rounding the point of effacement: a fancy, perhaps, that to a
water-shed to the far north-east, corresponding to that into Lake
Alexandria to the south-west, would be found allotted the
drainage of that portion of Australia which lies east, say, of
the hundred and fortieth meridian. I have not, however, said how
much of what I could sight from our perch on Fraser's Island had
shaken the conclusion I had come to after my trip down the
Condamine in November last year. From our nest we had been able
to trace a line of high rugged country, which I foolishly set
down as the course of the true Dividing Range. This line
continued&mdash;to my mistaken eyes&mdash;unbroken from the far
distance in the south to a point inland nearly abreast
of&mdash;or more correctly, to the north of our position, in the
far-away west. From this I could make out no rising ground
farther north. Thence all looked like a low flat stretch of land.
Was it possible yet that the Downs may contribute its waters,
after all, to the eastern system? My conviction, since my trip
last year, was that they were all forming a western and
south-western drainage. And yet, here was the Dividing Range
exhausted&mdash;run to earth!</p>
<p>I need not detail the obstacles to our progress any farther.
How after another island visit, another look-out, and an alarming
introduction to a quick sand, we launched into water clear of mud
stretching away to the northward, while the margin of Fraser's
Island kept retreating to the eastward; that of the mainland more
westerly, beyond an islet&mdash;the largest we had yet seen,
where the spreading waters formed, we supposed, Hervey's Bay, to
which we had completed the approach by a channel never before
used&mdash;and as far as such charts as we had told
us&mdash;never before known.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Some years afterwards&mdash;in
1847&mdash;mention was made of this passage from Wide into
Hervey's Bay by Captain Stanley, then in command of H.M.S.
"Rattlesnake". In Macgillivray's narrative of her cruise, between
1846 and 1850, appears as follows, (vol. I., ch. 2.):&mdash;"A
few days after our arrival at Port Curtis&mdash;8th of November,
1847&mdash;the Asp, as our decked boat had been named, joined us,
having made an important addition to the surveys of this portion
of the coast. On his passage up from Brisbane, Lieutenant Dayman,
under the unexpected circumstance of finding that the
"Rattlesnake" had sailed, instead of coasting along the eastern
side of Great Sandy Island&mdash;thus involving the necessity of
rounding Breaksea Spit&mdash;determined upon trying the passage
between the island and the mainland into Hervey's Bay; this he
fortunately succeeded in accomplishing, although under
difficulties which his sketch (since published by the Admiralty)
will lessen to those who may require to use the same previously
little known channel.]</p>
<p>I have since learnt the cause of my error; very much from the
teaching I acquired upon two overland jogs to this place, and its
neighbourhood by different routes from Darling Downs, shortly
after my return from this cruise, before our illustrious
schoolmaster, Leichhardt, had come upon the stage to train our
eyes to the true reading of this passage of our Queen's
scroll.</p>
<p>Suffer me to explain it. From the point of its connexion with
the Bunnia-Bunnia ranges&mdash;(of which the function is to
separate the drainage to the southward into Moreton Bay, from
that to the northward into Wide and Hervey's Bay)&mdash;the
dividing barrier, which had hitherto from its extreme southern
growth followed a line parallel on the whole to that of the sea
coast, makes a pronounced deflection to the westward, to which it
adheres while still creeping towards the north for a great
distance. Then, recovering itself, it draws gradually round
towards the sea, with which it joins hands somewhere about Cairns
or Cape Grafton. From its eastern extremity&mdash;on which stands
that noteworthy finger-post, Mount Caroora (name got from
Bracefell)&mdash;to Craig's Range, so much remarked from Jimbour
Station, on Darling Downs, where it may be said the junction is
accomplished a little to the south of due west from Mount
Caroora, this Bunnia-Bunnia offshoot forces the parent stem out
of position, and, consequently, it had betaken itself far out of
the range of any view inland that we had been able to command
from Fraser's Island. Indeed, the basin of country which the rim
of the Bunnia-Bunnia heights, and their subsequent career in
company with the dividing range encloses, contains a system of
drainage <i>per se</i>.</p>
<p>As the first fruit of our tree of examination&mdash;I wish I
had the bearings then taken, now, that I might fix the exact
whereabouts of that serviceable observatory&mdash;we had little
difficulty in heading direct for the supposed mouth of a
river&mdash;the hoped for river! By sunset we had crossed the
debouchure of a stream, which at first sight promised well. The
northern point which formed it was most convenient for our night,
and there we camped. It was a punishing locality; the sharp
stones sorelv trying, particularly as a bed of rest. We could
detect no signs of blacks in the neighbourhood; but found a
species of pine unknown to Petrie, who, in his vocations as
foreman of works for the Government had become intimate with its
varieties. Cut out a sample of the timber and our several names
in the trunk, and got eagerly to the boat, after breakfast, to
visit yet unvisited land and water.</p>
<p>Jolliffe's long black beard had been an object of mirth, and I
must add admiration, all the jaunt through, especially to the
blacks.</p>
<p>This new river-head which we were leaving, and perhaps should
never see again, tufted with that thick glossy patch of dark pine
brushy by some process associated itself with it; and down on the
rough outline, the base of a future report, went under our
official friend's hand; "Jolliffe's Beard", for its baptismal
name. I wonder whether it is called so still? May be it bears
some later comer's.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the flood-tide we pulled with a will. I
find that I yet have notes of what the river seemed to me to be
in bank, breadth, depth, and so on; but, well known as the "Mary
River"&mdash;subsequently so named after Lady Mary
Fitzroy&mdash;is by this time, it would be ridiculous and
impertinent to reproduce them. Where a memorandum, now and then
ferreted out, gives me the cue to any coincident circumstances or
surroundings, I have just to shut my eyes and go back to the
place and time: quite surprised am I to find, under the
experiment, how phantasms of scenes and their accompaniments by
word, voice, or action can be resuscitated and re-installed in
their period and place. Assuredly the characters of a fresh
career are more indelibly cut into the excited and inquisitive
senses of the "new chum" than the like ever
afterwards&mdash;though more significant&mdash;can be branded
into the toughened hide of indifference, in which, as an "old
hand", he has learnt to enwrap himself.</p>
<p>So I pass over my river, on and up it; now and then appalling
the numberless ducks&mdash;of many varieties&mdash;black swans,
gorgeous parrots, and cockatoos&mdash;by a shot too tempting to
deny myself: looking out in vain as yet for any promise by forest
land or grassy plain of the Goshen pasturage of which I was in
quest. No blacks either, and our "Ulysses" had been almost
forgotten. At some fresh bend we got a glimpse now and then of
Boppol, the mountain we had first seen from near Bracefell's
Head. If I recollect aright, it had a form thickly brushed, bald
near the summit, which was flat topped, but of this I am not
sure. By Bracefell's friend it was signified that the river ran
round its northern foot. I believe that it does so. The
possibility that this might be the Condamine, and that the
Darling Downs doctrine might prove to be correct, kept us all
wound up to the last turn: the strain of expectation didn't agree
with other appetites. I think our consumption was almost wholly
that effected by smoke: in smoke, alas! my lofty castles curled
away in the air not many months afterwards!</p>
<p>We lay all that night in our boat moored in the middle of the
stream. Young Wallüpy, one of our Brisbane blacks, was restless
and ill at ease through fear all night. Our plan in furtherance
of the object in view, viz., finding out what this watercourse
really was, and getting from some high point a satisfactory view
of what the surrounding country held out to the squatter, was
discussed, and as far as possible resolved on. The programme
consisted of pulling on as far as the boat could float, leaving a
party with it, and walking westward a day or two, until we had
satisfied ourselves; but first landing at, and getting to the top
of Boppol. We went to sleep upon this decision: it awoke and rose
with us in the morning. We went ashore: withdrew out of ear-shot
of our crew of five prisoners&mdash;well known to Petrie in the
past&mdash;at the latter's request. He had been thinking about
our proposal of last night, of leaving these men with the boat,
while we explored on foot, and said there was one great obstacle
to our doing so; the men were not to be trusted. Something that
had dropped from Bracefell had put him on his guard: Wallüpy had
consented to guide them back to Brisbane by land, if they found a
chance of getting away unobserved: by him they had been assured
that we should be all killed if we went further, and his fright
had communicated itself to his white mates, with the exception of
"old Bill", who refused to join them. It became apparent at once
that if we were to leave them with the boat, they would "up stick
and away" as soon as we were out of sight. In fact, all four were
in fear of their own lives, and but for "old Bill" would have
decamped with Wallüpy before we had entered the river.</p>
<p>I had taken a <i>penchant</i> to this "old Bill", and had had
many a yarn with him on the way. He had but one eye, but the loss
of the other had not dimmed the brightness and light-heartedness,
which, as a rule, gild the features of an old
sailor&mdash;emphatically the "tar" of our navy. Strange! I often
thought, that one of this stamp should ever have been sent a
convict to Moreton Bay. I never found out what brought him there.
The most curious thing, to me, was that I found that "old Bill"
had been in H.M.S. "Canopus", 74, at the same time as Arthur
Hodgson, then a middle.</p>
<p>Had these men found the means of carrying out their project,
what account could they have given of us, so as to clear
themselves? In dulled mood we broke our fast. What had come to
our ears had made us very watchful, and to some extent
uncomfortable. After consorting so many days, and in such close
quarters, for my own part, I felt loth to suspect such apparently
willing and ready men, cheerful as they were in doing their duty,
and accommodating themselves without a word or wry face to every
call upon their strength and vigilance, of such villainous
treachery. Yet, how could it be doubted? I looked upon "old Bill"
with admiration, as we continued' up the stream until late in the
afternoon, having passed through a shallow rapid over a rocky
bed. We went ashore on a flat on our left&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., the
right bank of the river, and having taken everything out of the
boat, took the plug out so as to cleanse by sinking her in the
fresh water. We were wishing also to find natives, who could give
some information about the course of the river; hitherto we had
seen none; Boppol was about three miles distant. Up Boppol, at
any rate, we should go next day, if all were well.</p>
<p>On either side of our camping place was thick scrub: a little
way back a high sandy bank. When the boat had been thoroughly
washed out, and got afloat again, Bracefell and his Brown's Cape
friend went away to look for traces of the blacks. He returned
once without success, and with his companion set out a second
time, but soon came back in haste in a state of no little
excitement and alarm. He said he had discovered their camp but
had not expected to find so many tribes collected together: the
largest number he had seen at one time since the "wreck": he had
had a good look at them, without being himself seen: but assured
Petrie that if two white men would go with him to within a short
distance of the camp, he would enter it and have a "palaver".
Jolliffe and I offered ourselves, but he preferred having two of
the crew. This looked strange: "couldn't he depend on us, as much
as two of the men, who he knew were contemplating desertion?" It
turned out afterwards that he had a fear of their being at once
speared, and that he valued our lives more than theirs.</p>
<p>Having stripped and "manned" his spear as he had been wont to
do, he declared himself ready. He had met, he said some of these
tribes years ago in the Bunnia, but could not answer for their
recollecting him.</p>
<p>They were about a mile away. Two of the men and
Wallüpy&mdash;who didn't like it at all&mdash;started off with
Bracefell.</p>
<p>Not having been an eye witness of what followed, I can only
now relate what I collected afterwards from Bracefell, his three
comrades, and another who now came in strange fashion upon the
scene.</p>
<p>When within a few hundred yards of the camp, astonished to
find that the people in it were wholly unconscious of the arrival
of a party of whites so near at hand, Bracefell told the two
men&mdash;who were armed&mdash;to stop. He crossed a creek in
front, between themselves and the assemblage, with Wallüpy;
strode into the midst of them before they had become aware of his
presence, and hailed them with a loud shout of his own name,
"Wandi!" The whole mob rushed, as if stricken, to their spears,
which were stuck into the ground, and 'piled much in the
soldierly fashion on a rest during march. So absolutely surprised
that the betrayal of the fact became evident under the suddenness
and simultaneousness of the commotion. Hundreds rushed out of the
scrub, yelling like fiends. We could hear the yells, and were
made anxious for the safety of our <i>avant-couriers</i>. At the
further end of the camp were two men skinning a kangaroo, just
killed. One of them, as soon as Wandi's voice had reached his
ears, rose&mdash;looked at him in a frantic manner, and at once
catching sight of the white men in the rear, rushed past and at
full speed towards them. For a while&mdash;a few minutes&mdash;he
could utter no sound, but by gesticulation and sign, inquired
from the poor fellows, who were terribly alarmed, how they had
come there, by land or by water? They pointed to the river.
Wandi, notwithstanding what had been imparted to him by the Cape
Brown friend&mdash;which, he admitted, he had not
believed&mdash;became as astonished and excited as any one of the
yelling mountebanks, for in this man he recognised one whom he
had once known, and had thought dead for many a year past. They
then confronted each other; Wandi in his rapid utterances made
known to him that their white brothers were close by; how they
had found him, how he had found them; repeated all the assurances
which we had made of good treatment and kindly welcome at
"Meginchen", which had put off her old garment dyed in blood and
girdled by the chain; how the great Sydney Commandant had opened
the doors of the prison-house, and the mouth of the river to the
only food for men&mdash;liberty; had burnt the "cats", and buried
the "darbies"&mdash;arms, legs, body, eyes, and every muscle and
fibre meaningly giving emphasis to his earnestness and
truthfulness; and then as a wind-up, in low whisper: "Come with
me; come back to us; I have come that I may go back; let us go
together; now's your chance. Derhamboi, take it!"</p>
<p>Having afterwards seen "speechifying" in a tribe, and observed
the influence with which the tone, manner, and expressive acting
rather than words of wonderful volubility, compelled the wasted
souls of such children of the woods into the tide of the
speaker's own intent&mdash;I can understand such a scene, though
no spectator. The idiom and metaphor, of which I got a smattering
afterwards, was, in my estimation at least, far above the grade
which one would have suspected that the fancy or intelligence of
such hideous scandals to humanity could aspire to. Doubtless,
some were more gifted, mentally endowed, than many around; and
individuals of such calibre became in the tribe "kings of men".
Acted addresses to their fellows were rarely, I had reason to
believe, undertaken by more than one or two of the village, just
as in English rural hamlets, there is always a keen-witted,
smart-lipped, pot-house politician, or tub orator, to lead his
beery "quid-nuncs" by the nose. It was reasonable to entertain
the probability that this Wandi (who had won his laurels as "the
great talker"), and Derhamboi, also, adding the superior
instincts of the white to the cunning and tactics learnt from the
black, were accustomed "to ride the high horse" in the midst of
their <i>confrères</i>, as soon as their sealed acceptance into
the family had cancelled the usual sentence: "Let them be knocked
on the head!"</p>
<p>"Derhamboi" (which being construed means a "kangaroo
rat"&mdash;emblem of activity and speed) had, we know from the
records, run away from the penal settlement fourteen years
before&mdash;in Logan's day. Its name, even now, had roused dread
in his suspicious mind: he made his reply: charged Wandi with
having guided the white constables to his place of refuge, in
which he had so long lived a life he loved: worked himself into a
frenzy of passion at his having done this traitor's trick: that
he himself (Wandi) might have his reward: that his back might be
spared the scourge for hunting him (Derhamboi) down; and giving
him over to the tormentor and death; for having broken faith with
his fellow-runaway and outlaw, and sneaked into the good graces
of his kind by pledging himself to hand him over to the manacles,
leg-irons and chain: and now with lying lips snaring him with the
"tow-row" (net for kangaroo) of his tongue and steal him away
from his father and his home.</p>
<p>Tantamount to this must have been&mdash;as
described&mdash;this encounter between the pair of white savages.
In part it was verified by my own eyes. Derhamboi&mdash;who had
thought we were in great force, sent out for the sole object of
seizing and carrying him off, dead or alive, had not dared refuse
to follow the slow retreat of Wandi and his companions towards
our camp. Consequently at the very acme of this unmerited
invective and reproach, of this screaming demonstration, and
stinging slander, they had both come well in sight. What
superlatively irritating figure of speech had been used, I cannot
tell, but in a moment Wandi made a step back from his accuser,
and quickly poised his spear. Derhamboi, with the lightness of a
leopard, did the same, and then there rose to the skies a war
challenge the resonant syllables of which left us no need of
interpretation in view of the attitude of these antagonists,
attitude and bearing which, at least to my own stimulated
curiosity and "new chummy" interest, suggested a term of nobler
epithet than that of picturesque.</p>
<p>The sense of a shameful wrong&mdash;a foul
blow&mdash;irremediable death-dealing injury from the traitor
hands of his fellow-in-bonds of old seemed to have fuelled a
thousandfold the glare of ferocity on the one hand; and there
stood a demon in the heat of his hate; vet magnificent in
gestures to which the heat of that hate restlessly bent the
proportions of uncurbed nature. I could even sympathise with such
passion because I could trace its natural origin and motive.</p>
<p>Indignation, fiery repudiation, sense of injustice and
disappointment at such thrusting away of good service: an
unextinguished and unquenchable spark of human sympathy with one
of kin-creation and suffering,&mdash;which a little of that
warmth of kindness which he had never slept near, and
considerateness which, but among his present well-wishers he had
never dreamed about, may have rekindled; just as the fanning
motion of the hand had quickened the fire-fly's latent glow, and
there stood a man also moulded and modelled by the plastic force
of the natural heart, which wrote itself in the erect crest, the
quiet, manly, yet watchful and ready "pose" of good opposed to
evil.</p>
<p>Derhamboi's chest was tattoed "moolgarrah" fashion,
<i>i.e</i>., horizontal scars parallel to each other: both showed
scars of old wounds in their backs and legs. The former had had a
spear through his thigh and the smash of a boomerang on the right
knee. In the tension of their muscular frames these brands caught
the eye, as we gathered nearer to put a stop to any active
hostility. Derhamboi was the tallest&mdash;though not a tall
man&mdash;and the best set-up. Wandi slim and as hard as his own
spear but much older than his opponent, who was about thirty
years of age.</p>
<p>All this occurred on the top of the sand bank, at the back of
our camp, which I have mentioned. Seeing that we should interfere
with their arrangements, Derhamboi turned, lowered his weapon,
came to the edge of the bank and took a scowling long look at us
one by one. He almost seemed to have it in mind to dispute our
advance. Petrie, in a tone fitted to the occasion, told him to
come down: one searching stare at the speaker, one moment's
hesitation, and down he rushed with an impetuosity which marked
all his proceedings, "my name Jem Davis, of Glasgow", were the
only words he could utter intelligible to us: went off at score
into a rapid "black" speech, from which, by means of Wandi, we
could only make out that he had run away from the settlement,
because the men on his chain were cutting each others' throats,
or knocking a mate's head in with the pick used on the roads, so
that they might be sent to Sydney to be "what they called hung."
Fearing for his own life at the hands of his comrades, he had
managed to escape and take his chance of mercy among the blacks.
Derhamboi was wearing the necklaces and armlets usual among the
natives, and as he frantically went on in the scream of his
excitement, seeing that we were unable to understand a word he
said, and could express himself in no other language: too
impatient to submit to the dilatory relief of interpretation:
flew off again into a satanic passion, wrenched off his
<i>bijouterie</i> and set to tearing and clawing up the ground
with his fingers, sinking his voice from the shrillest howl to a
very Bedlamite whisper, accompanied by a wicked leer well suited
to the change. A long time afterwards he told me that he had
never been able to recollect what had passed! I think he was
mad.</p>
<p>Bracefell, who was standing by, said something which at once
produced silence and a quieter condition for a few minutes. He
told us that Davis&mdash;I shall so call him now&mdash;had wished
to make us know that we should be in great danger if we attempted
(for Bracefell had told him our intention) to go up the mountain
before us, Boppol, from which I have said we were only three
miles, and thus separate from the rest of our party.</p>
<p>And now we heard a story quite new to us, and terrible; but
which accounted for the great gathering of tribes and fighting
men, although the Bunnia season was not yet at hand.</p>
<p>Quite recently, it appeared, some new sheep stations had been
formed and occupied on some of the higher affluents of the river
Brisbane, and not far from the southern dip of the Bunnia high
lands. The news of these arrivals had been passed on thence from
village to village, and had rapidly flown to the north. It had
roused curiosity as well as cupidity far beyond Wide Bay, and mob
after mob had joined together contemplating outrage and spoil.
Some shepherds at one of these localities, terrified at the
appearance of so large a gathering, had recourse to a horrible
method of ridding themselves of such dreaded visitors, who made
demands for flour, tobacco, and sugar (of which their southern
countrymen had spoken with such gusto), which they had not dared
refuse. So when called upon one day for such supplies they had
mixed poison with the flour. It must have been arsenic, which was
kept on many stations for dressing sheep for scab. Davis at this
point took up the talking and went through all the scene of the
deaths of some fifty or sixty blacks: a strangely truthful
delineation of the first pangs experienced: the ferocious wrath
upon the discovery of the trap into which they had fallen: the
increasing agonies: the crawling to water: the insatiable burning
thirst: then&mdash;death. It was al! acted over again with a
reality which thrilled us.</p>
<p>Then came the cry for vengeance!</p>
<p class="poemw">Between the acting of a dreadful thing<br>
And the first motion, all the interim is<br>
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream.<br>
The Genius and the mortal instruments<br>
Are then in Council.&mdash;<i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<p>That a general "tourr", or "corroboree" is the preliminary
need to all important ventures decided upon by the Australian
natives&mdash;in the north at least&mdash;is, I presume, well
known. Also, that on such occasions there is a grand pantomimic
rehearsal by the fighting men of such tribes as may be assembled
for the set purpose of the programme of what the contemplated
deeds of darkness and horror were about to accomplish
triumphantly. The love of theatrical display is evinced by the
frequent repetition of the scenes of a kangaroo or any other
hunt&mdash;before they throw off&mdash;for the amusement and
unbounded admiration of their women and the old stop-in-the-camp
men. How supreme the <i>furore</i> out of the lust of
anticipation by which their ruthless natures drink of the cup of
bloodthirstiness, revenge, and greed, until driven well nigh
insensate by the recital of wrath, in the mimicked deeds of
violence, cruelty, outrage, and death, can without much effort be
imagined. I could not if I would, and I would not if I could,
make an attempt to depict the maniacal frenzy with which
savagedom prides itself in prefacing and prefiguring scenes of
each act of a tragedy delineated with such premature
minuteness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Campbell Praed, authoress of "Australian Life: Black and
White", describes very truthfully and impressively a performance
such as this, and the effect upon <i>her</i> nervous system was
that of faintness and sickness, so that she "turned and fled
towards the river" from the terror-laden orgies.</p>
<p>She there also tells of the occasion as one that heralded to
the "myalls" around one of the most horrible episodes of the
earlier northern bush life. I was in the district in which that
family met with their fearful fate at the time of visitation. As
the authoress speaks of the victims as bearing the
<i>nom-de-plume</i> of "Grant", I dare not desecrate her motive
by recalling the real name. The whole outline of the narrative
coincides with what I remember: the treachery, the surprise; but
the recording angel only can draw up the indictment against that
night which harboured in safety such incarnate fiends, shrouding
that dance of death. I had known that family well at
Gowrie&mdash;then Hughes and Isaac's station at Darling
Downs&mdash;and, from my knowledge of them, could in all
earnestness, sorrow and sympathise with the one member that
escaped the slaughter.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Campbell Praed's book I recommend any who wish to read
a sad story of fact, told with skill to which I do not
pretend.</p>
<p>I have wandered away from the spot on which I left Wandi and
Derhamboi. Before we had left Brisbane a report had reached it
that two white men&mdash;shepherds&mdash;had been murdered by
blacks on a station formed not far from the Bunnia Ranges. These
two men, it now was explained, had been the sacrifice to the cry
of vengeance. Strange, I thought, that we should be first
apprised of the white men's crime by a white man from the midst
of their murderers! Davis then acted over the whole scene: the
"shaky" creeping through the grass; the cat-like watching; the
drawing nearer and nearer to the unconscious wretch; the spring;
the rush; the fierce blow: the death, and the triumph. Then, he
told us, that as we had seen him do, in like manner would these
with whom he dwelt do unto us, if we did not keep our eyes "in
fear of their coming" all the night long. He said, too, that his
"father" Pamby-Pamby had a white man's watch wrapped in grass,
part of the <i>spolia opima</i> after the murder mentioned: it
had been passed on from tribe to tribe that "their hearts might
make a wonder at it," and had come back to his father, who was
the rightful owner. His respected father could make nothing of
it: "he took it for a stone;" at first he thought it was alive,
but it had died very soon (inclining his head sideways upon the
palm of his hand). Davis himself knew it could be opened, but had
forgotten how to do it. We promised to give his father a tomahawk
if he would bring it to us: Davis promised he should. Then asked
to be allowed to return to the blacks' camp for the night:
explained&mdash;by a figure of speech which will not excuse
repetition&mdash;that he was afraid for our safety; that he would
keep them in fear of our strength and our arms; and watch in our
behalf against any attempt to attack. He went back. We were
guilty, I thought, of a very foolish thing that night.</p>
<p>The stream here was not forty yards wide, overhung by steep,
scrubby banks, from which a thousand blacks could have speared us
without our ever being able to fire a shot from a boat. Yet into
the wretched boat&mdash;rather. I thought, to allay our crew's
fears than any other prudential reason&mdash;it was thought
advisable that we should sleep in mid-channel, and there we lay
drowsily smoking, barely whispering, nodding, and watching in a
fashion, till gladdened by the peep o' day.</p>
<p>I have said that Davis appeared to be about thirty years of
age. This was substantially correct; but how could it be shown?
If he had been out, as he proved to be, with this tribe sixteen
years, he could have been but in his fourteenth year when he was
on the chain from which he had escaped! True enough, for it
turned out that he was then <i>thirteen years of age!</i> Well:
Moreton Bay was a penal settlement to which
secondary&mdash;<i>i.e</i>., colonial sentences&mdash;only had
delivered felons already transported for crimes. True again!
James Davis, of Glasgow, had been handed over by a sentence
passed upon him in Surrey, England, to the reforming refuge of a
convict ship, in the sweet and edifying company of some hundreds
of malefactors of all shades, in the midst of whom, I hope, he
was the youngest, having reached the precocious manhood of eleven
years from his birth! Thus he had appeared in Sydney.</p>
<p>At sunrise two musket shots&mdash;a signal already explained
to Davis&mdash;were fired. The poisoning of the blacks, the
avowed enmity and the natural wish for revenge on whites whoever
they were, the probable evasion of our crew in their alarm, the
large concourse of savages, had in the meantime made us change
our minds about our purpose. We dared not separate our party in
any case; we could not leave the boat unprotected: ergo, we must
give up for the present any further exploring. The only
alternative left was to go back again. Poor Jolliffe! hitherto so
sanguine of success in finding a run for John Eales' sheep,
looked disconcerted. I <i>was</i> so.</p>
<p>In a short while Derhamboi made his appearance. We could feel
that a large mob of his people were following him, and too near
us. We could see but one&mdash;a scowling, square-set ruffian,
whose very stare and lowering eyebrows told the tale of what he
would be and what he would do if he had the chance. And this
filthy brute was Derhamboi's revered parent, Pamby-Pamby! He
lifted no hand in token of peace and good-fellowship&mdash;not
he! His deep-set, restless eyes watched every motion, took in
every object before him in the boat. He seemed for a moment to
hesitate, upon which his affectionate son made a loud, angry
remark&mdash;not respectful, certainly&mdash;which had the effect
of bringing him further forward. We held up a tomahawk, the sight
of which settled the question. He at once followed Davis into the
water, drew out of the grass-woven bag over his left shoulder
something carefully packed, handed it in silence to Davis, while
Davis received the tomahawk and gave it to Pamby-Pamby, who,
without a word, backed away to the bank, retreated in the same
fashion up it&mdash;'too suspicious to turn&mdash;and then
suddenly disappeared. With eager hands the parcel was torn open,
and there, sure enough, was an old-fashioned silver "turnip". On
a paper fitted inside to the back was the name of the murdered
owner&mdash;Murray&mdash;Thomas Murray, I think. I am not sure as
to the Christian name. On our return it became the key to the
wretched affair.</p>
<p>Davies must have adorned himself afresh after leaving us last
night. He had on bracelets and armlets as before, but as soon as
Pamby-Pamby had retired, and he was admitted into our midst, he
tore them all off again and threw them into the water. I caught
and kept them as curiosities. He appeared to be still in a state
of doubt and perplexity, but the step he had taken&mdash;from
whatever real cause after his abuse of Bracefell&mdash;could not
now be retraced. The truth was, I think, from what passed in the
course of our return, that notwithstanding real regret at leaving
his wild life, notwithstanding his dread of what might await him
at the settlement, he had been so cowed by authority that even
after his long spell of freedom and unrestraint, the habit of
obedience to authority's tone and the fear of our arms had
overcome every other consideration. His subsequent admission that
he had taken us all for constables, was the key, I suspect, to
his surrender. And yet, if he spoke the truth at all, such an
explanation did not quite tally with what he soon conveyed to us.
He declared that he had been all the previous night engaged in
speechifying: seeing that they were bent on mischief, he had
described our numbers, strength and fire-arms in a manner so
exaggerated as to cool the ardour of the "fighting men": but went
on to assure us that had we stayed another day, it would not have
been possible for him to dissuade them from attacking us. All
this may have been got up in order to curry favour with his new
messmates, and I still believe that fear alone brought him
in.</p>
<p>The last farewell&mdash;the last parting with his friends of
the tribe of "Ginginbarah" had been an exhibition of untutored
translation of wild emotions&mdash;sentiment, affection (call it
by what name you may) to gesture, gesticulation, intonation,
cadences in the lingering cries that he should come to them
again, too sudden and expressive to need assurance that there was
nothing assumed or spurious in the overwhelming burst of regret
at losing Derhamboi. No sooner had our oars dropped into the
water on Pamby-Pamby's withdrawal, than every tree by the water's
side, in the bush beyond, below, this side and that side: every
hiding place unnoticed but for what it now revealed, became alive
with natives; some peering round the stout trunks, afraid to
expose their bodies to a possible "tolloolpil" (shot); others
springing unexpectedly into view from some protecting limb aloft,
while the dark scrub shot out hundreds of heads, young and old,
piccaninnies and gins, whose habitual caution and jealousy of
being seen by strange people had been put aside on an occasion of
such grief and wonder,&mdash;thrust before our astonished eyes an
extemporised <i>tableau vivant</i>, of which white man,
methought, shall never see the like of again. The swarming bees
on such a business so startled myself&mdash;new chum as I
was&mdash;that the impulse of my hands was towards my rifle, the
next to taking notice of the position. The god of day, still in
his birth, which had warmed long years gone by, these wood-bound
children of the sun into welcome rather than war-whoop when the
wretched waif, the white wanderer wailing through the wilderness
and woe-worn, wending his reckless way towards some chance refuge
from his doom, delivered himself to their mercies, now so lit up
their bodies "cooché greased" and lithe, so glanced aslant upon
their glistening limbs, never resting, ever flitting, that I
doubted as to any certain service, had I been called upon to
canvas my eyesight for proof of the precision of my weapon. Up
rose a plaintive cry which repeating itself again and again,
fainted off into the distance in which the more fearful were
abiding. Then up rose upon the bank to the right the burly
brutish Pamby-Pamby; up rose, too, from among us his adopted son
and heir, with lineaments hard-set, purposely unobservant, but
listening. The deep voice of the savage howled out his lament, in
tones which spoke, to me, more than words; in the spreading
embrace of his arms, which added more significance to its
yearnings and its claspings, than ever the like emblem of
recalling love between parent and progeny on the stage of our
civilised world had ever, in my eyes, done before: the shrill
reproach so fitted to the fable of enforced flight: off again in
other modulations to their hunts, their haunts, the memory too,
of many a brave fight in company together: the wide range of
Ginginbarah on the fish grounds of their "Monoboola"&mdash;(Mary
River)&mdash;and then last, but not least, the love for his son
once removed from Beegie's * bosom, now to be double dead to him
among the "makromme" (dead men). Ouah! Ouah! Derhamboi. Come
back!</p>
<p class="foot">[* The sun.]</p>
<p>Ere this appeal came to an end, the scattered choir took up
the refrain, and then, shaking in every limb, Davis began with a
low slow whine. What he said, I know not: what he conveyed, all
could read. "I came to you when young and driven like a dog from
the doors of the 'makromme:' I told you of all my misery and my
torture: I said, 'do to me as you think best, I am yours,' and I
dropped as one dead again, for I was hungry, thirsty, weak and
worn with looking behind for the hated ones pursuing: you came
together, but all was to me as a fog: your voices were crying
kill! kill! but there was little life to stamp out: you,
Pamby-Pamby, knew me again: could I tell who I had been? You knew
me, father: you took me, you fed me, you gave me tabil (water) to
drink, you gave me flesh to eat. Was I not your son? Beegie had
washed me back to you, and I was glad. But the great Commandant
(pointing to the south) has sent for me, I must go: I will come
back; when the moon has come back to you three times I shall be
here."</p>
<p>Of this character was Davis' apologetic hymn. Of course, we
looked on in silence, and new interest in so singularly acted out
a play of life in the bush wilds, of which the plot had been
written, and the parts borne by the <i>dramatis personæ</i>
themselves. The performance died away, bit by bit&mdash;through
exhaustion, in part, I thought&mdash;but as we paddled down
stream a large concourse at first for some miles, but "tailing
off" by dozens, followed and wailed us on towards the water on
our way home.</p>
<p>When in camp that evening, about seventeen miles down the
river, Davis got the men to shave him. With what odd garments we
had he was then dressed, and, as the effect always is upon
blacks, so his appearance in stature was reduced to somewhat
below the average white man's. Take any aboriginal of large
proportions, more muscular build, and taller than his fellows, in
the midst of whom he looks a giant, dress him, and lie at once
dwindles into a very ordinary being.</p>
<p>His back had been cut up terribly, either by the stone knives
used in fighting, or as honourable tattoo scars. What we had
already heard from Bracefell as to the habits, manners, and
customs which prevail among these tribes was fully confirmed by
Davis' statements, as he recovered the power of speaking English.
His expressions were ingenious and noteworthy as he progressed in
the use of his proper language; for when in difficulty he would
literally render the blacks' metaphorical phrases&mdash;repulsive
and indecent often enough&mdash;into the required words which
<i>we</i> could understand. Perhaps I may say he thought in the
manner of the savage, and uttered his thoughts in our familiar
tongue through the channel of savage idiom. Looking forward to
more "run-hunting", I plucked up heart at finding that he was
well "up" about the country farther north, that he knew of three
large rivers which I must set down as running into or not far
from Hervey's Bay; but what to me was the greatest satisfaction
was his mention of a very large river which ran into the sea far
beyond these waters, which the people on the banks declared came
from the back of the Bunnia Mountains! Well, the land at the back
of them <i>is</i> Darling Downs! Here was the pet idea gathering
substance. Alas! a few more months I knocked it on the head
myself, when I struck that of the Boyne.</p>
<p>The habit of listening to our boat's now no longer listless
lingo quickly revived the torpid faculty of Davis's
"Glasgow-grained gab". His forcible periods were quite on a par
with the impetuosity of his actions, his rapid talk with the
agility of his limbs. It was certainly surprising that he should
so absolutely have lost, on our first acquaintance, the power of
expressing himself by one word of English, but not so much so as
that he, the first night of our camping together, would amuse
himself by singing Scotch songs without hesitation. When
questioned he did not appear to know their meaning; it had been
one cherished habit o' nights of his "Auld lang syne!" Like a
playful cat, he would seize a brush vine which he carried with a
twist which formed a knot at one end and bent into a half-hitch
at the other round his right wrist, rush to the nearest tree,
however big, throw it round the trunk, catch the other with his
left hand, and run up the smooth bark, resting when he wished on
the knot shipped between his great and the next toe, sit upon its
lowest limb, have a good look round, and then&mdash;come down
again, almost by the run! In ascending, his body at times stuck
out from the stem almost horizontally; with a quick "yield" he
would pitch the vine a foot or so higher at a time, and so travel
up with admirable speed. In the Bunnia-Bunnia season he must have
been an expert. By this means the blacks go up to the greatest
heights of that magnificent Araucaria to reach the
triennial&mdash;to them delicious&mdash;cone: so delicious that
the fiercest fights arise between the assembled tribes in the
preliminary apportionment to each before the season begins. Once
that matter is agreed upon no poaching ever occurs. This is a
point ol aboriginal honour.</p>
<p>Then would he, by the glimmering light of fire, enact, as was
much his wont, some episode within his ken, illustrating the
extreme cunning which, as a grade of merit, was the root of the
native warrior's pre-eminence among his compeers; or the laudable
skill in treachery, proved by some out-Heroding act by which a
powerful rival in "camp" affections, or a suspected private enemy
within the family who had made his mark too decidedly to be
openly defied, had been "put away" when unconscious of ill-will
by some death-dealing trick in the dark, or when had at vantage:
stories which, without doubt, had been told over and over again,
and held up as badges for which their growing boys should
compete; but which the cunning prodigal by my side would ever
wind up with the ready and expedient judgment, "them's all
b&mdash;&mdash;y rogues!" One of these mimicked descriptions has
not been effaced. One of the tribe was very jealous of another
(in his relations with one of the belles&mdash;who, in one way or
other always were at the root of the mischief-making) for whose
prowess with spear or nulla-nulla he had a wholesome respect.
Night by night, day by day, he watched for the coward's chance,
and after long waiting got it. His unwary victim was standing up
to his waist in Monoboola observing the fish; he had thrust his
spear into the bank by the waterside, and in eagerness to sight
the silver-sided game, waded out of reach of it. The patient
prowler, prone in the brush ambush some fifty yards higher up,
purred panther-like over the promise of prey; no eye to see, no
arm to help, no ear to hear. Bellying as the snake into the quick
current, he hugged its gritty bed till borne to the very
foot-hold of the heedless heels: seized the ankles and dragged
them from under his astonished kinsman until he fell headlong
into the rushing stream: lifted them high enough to keep his head
low enough: and as the twitchings weakened, and the Monoboola had
done one-half the work, dragged the helpless body to the edge and
completed the other by transfixing it with the owner's dreaded
weapon.</p>
<p>He would then launch out, perhaps with ill-disguised feeling
of a better sort, into telling how, before he had come back to
this boat that morning, so many had hung about his neck; clung to
his limbs, his legs, his arms, to stay him, maybe, yet from going
farther away from them. How they kissed and moaned in low tones,
for fear we should hear: and he would tell it, too, in a fashion
which made him, in my eyes at least, a sharer in the grief which
had dogged his footsteps all the way back. Thinking this, I did
not think the less of him. And then the beating and the cutting
of their own heads&mdash;self-sacrificing testimony to the pain
of their own souls, when all allurements, all enticements, all
assurances, had proved unavailing to bend him from his own to
their purpose: every pledge for the future, repeated as earnest
of their love for him: every method of snapping his stubborn will
exhausted&mdash;<em>seemed</em>, beyond controversy, to test no
spurious metal when it rang out beneath the blow with which his
rejection had stricken them. This propitiatory penance, too,
while we were onlookers, wondering how souls of such softness had
found a hiding place in human images hitherto daubed by the
slander of the white man's word, that these lived but by the base
appetite and gratification of every bestial sense! I say
<i>seemed</i>, for I yet lived to learn that the irrepressible
humours of these children of the groves would swelter and seethe
over the furnace of impulse, caprice, and passion, and then steam
away traceless as the dew beneath their feet, with all else that
is vapour and vanity under the sun.</p>
<p>When Davis pledged himself to be in their midst again in three
moons, in so pathetic a pose, he knew that he should not redeem
the pledge. The tryst appointed he should never see. Yet, at the
moment, I believe still that he had meant it. I think, indeed,
they believed it themselves&mdash;until sundown; when that day
and its doings would sleep into torpor, and so lie till some
fresh quake would set the pot boiling again.</p>
<p>Our run down the river was unmarked by any occurrence at all
noticeable. We visited our former camps, curious to see whether
they had been visited by the natives: carried a fine breeze to
"Russell's Cap", to which spot it complacently drove, and
delivered us to the ungracious dealing of a strong blow from the
south-east. Two days satiated our admiration of the marvellous
keen-sightedness and skill of some of Eumundy's tribe in spearing
and plucking the glittering king-fish out of the water, which
broke in heavy surf upon some rocks south of our camping place.
Bracefell had exhausted every method of gratifying the curiosity
and cupidity of his old friends, and the hours began to drag
heavily. So, to see what our boat could do, the wind having
somewhat gone down, we got away&mdash;only to get back again. The
crank craft was not able to put her nose beyond the point; indeed
she narrowly escaped swamping by the first sea that met her on a
wind. Shooting, fishing, and picking up shells for my sisters in
England, helped me through the exercise of patience, better than
I had expected, until I became aware that there was no help for
it but patience. Cockles, at low tide, groped out of the sand as
each wave receded, were capital eating when boiled: and cockle
hunting made merriment. The mutilated nautilus shell was lying
about on the sea-shore, but I sought in vain for a perfect one.
Bracefell had assured me that I never should find such a treasure
the natives keep too keen a watch for it for any to escape; the
white lips of the valve being so precious for the wearing string
round the neck, whether in the manner of ornament, or as a charm,
I could not discover. Disjointed vertebra; of whales' back-bone
was common. One served me for a good pillow one night. So we got
to the end of May reduced to a biscuit, cockles, and such fish as
the blacks would bring. Reminded thus of fishing days on this
coast, the scene on an occasion some time afterwards, before my
eyes at Amity Point, I never again saw enacted but at that one
place. It was so curious, that the evidence of my own senses
alone permits me to mention it. Cause and effect, however, were,
in the matter, quite intelligible.</p>
<p>We know that porpoises drive the smaller fry into shallows in
which they are able more easily to prey upon them. The affrighted
shoals leap when so pursued out of the water with loud
splashings; these their hidden pursuers follow, as stock-keepers
round up and keep their cattle together.</p>
<p>At Amity Point, if the watchful natives can detect one of the
shoals so common in the offing there, a few of the men would at
once walk into the water and beat it with their spears. The wary
porpoises would be seen presently coming in from sea-wards, fully
alive and accustomed to the summons, driving in the shoal towards
the shelving beach. Scores of the tribe would be ready with their
scoop-nets to rush in and capture all they could, but not before
the men who had summoned their ministering servants had speared
some good sized fish, which was held out and taken off the end of
the weapon by the porpoise nearest at hand. There was one old
fellow, said to be very old; as tame&mdash;with those
blacks&mdash;as a pussy cat! had a large patch of barnacles or
some fungus on his head, and a name which they believed he knew
and answered to.</p>
<p>In the narrative of the voyage of H.M.S. "Rattlesnake",
Captain Owen Stanley, during the year 1846-50, compiled by John
Macgillivray, naturalist to the expedition, may be found allusion
to his hunting porpoise in 1847. He says, "among the marine
animals of Moreton Bay, are two <i>cetacea</i> of great interest.
The first of these is the Australian Dugong (<i>Halicore
Australis</i>) which is the object of a regular fishery (on a
small scale, however) on account of its valuable oil. It
frequents the Brisbane river, and the mud flats of the harbour,
and is harpooned by the natives, who know it under the name of
Yungun. The other is an undescribed porpoise, a specimen of
which, however, I did not procure, as the natives believed the
most direful consequences would ensue from the destruction of
one; and I considered the advantages resulting to science from
the addition of a new species of <em>Phoc&oelig;na</em> would not
have justified me in outraging their strongly expressed
superstitious feelings on the subject. We observed that whenever
a drove of these porpoises came close in shore, a party of
natives followed them along the beach, and when a shoal of fish,
endeavouring to avoid their natural enemies, approached within
reach, the blacks rushed out into the water with loud cries, and
keeping their bag-nets close together, so as to form a
semi-circle, scooped out as many fish as came within reach."
*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Volume I., chapter 2.]</p>
<p>There was much jealousy between our two unexpected guests on
the way down to Brisbane. At night, they kept far apart, and
spoke in the day but in a quarrelsome fashion. Once, indeed, they
were on the point of having a set-to with their spears; our
intervention hardly stayed their hands; and, if anything, made
matters worse for the rest of the cruise. One would sit in the
bows, the other in the stern-sheets: both looked moody, and were
plainly considering matters in doubt and disquietude as the
distance day by day between Brisbane and ourselves
diminished.</p>
<p>Ere June had well got into running, we found ourselves back at
our starting point.</p>
<p>A faded memorandum on a leaf, now yellow, gives me the cue to
recollecting the sum of my conclusions for the evening of my
return to the settlement, where we landed in front of Petrie's
hospitable quarters: "Our intended tour in the Bunnia country has
not been carried out, but I have gained the satisfaction of
having been one of a party who have rescued two poor white devils
from obliteration among their fellows: have seen what looks like
a first-rate harbour, and a river in which I yet hope, if I can
but find fit country on or near it, good-bye to drays, bullocks,
Cunningham's Gaps, and Hell's Holes&mdash;hurrah! for immediate
water-carriage for wool and&mdash;'wittals!' Jolliffe is off at
once for his sixteen thousand sheep, and makes a start for
Boppol, as soon as I have got that poacher, Dicky Jones, off our
Condamine Station&mdash;(Oh! where is that Commissioner
Macdonald?)&mdash;Away; I'll go after him!" [Written in the old
Brisbane Gaol, June 2nd, 1842.]</p>
<p>"Were there many men on the settlement records whose names had
been marked off as absconders?" I believe there were: preferring
to take their chances at the hands of the blacks, many
disappeared, and were thus effaced. There was no such thought, as
that under which a gang took to the bush from Sydney in the early
times, "that they might get overland to China!" Oh, no! living or
dying by the hands of the natives was the onh alternative.</p>
<p>Nominal enumeration of such cases would answer no end. Suffice
it to say that they did go. The reign of terror was that of
Logan, by common consent; but let us see to the times after his
death. In Sydney, we find that on July 12th, 1831, is noted the
"execution of McManus, who was convicted the previous Thursday(!)
for attempting to murder a fellow-prisoner with a hoe, at Moreton
Bay, with the avowed object of <em>being sent to Sydney</em>,
there to forfeit his own life." The following is the one
exceptional instance of reaching their
fellow-countrymen:&mdash;"<i>Arrived, 16th August, 1831</i>,
three desperate runaways from Moreton Bay, who were received in
gaol last week. They had reached the vicinity of <i>Port
Macquarie</i>, subsisting upon anything they could meet with,
principally roots. Those terrors to bushrangers, the native
blacks, brought them into the settlement, and delivered them over
to Capt. Smith, who lodged them in gaol. They again got away, and
reached Port Stephens, and were accordingly sent to head-quarters
for disposal. Although many of those who are escaping from the
'gaol to the gaol-yard' (for to fly from Moreton Bay to Sydney is
nothing better), are continually <i>falling victims to the spears
of the savages around</i> them; yet, no example will deter them
from unavailing and desperate efforts to obtain their
liberty&mdash;a liberty which is only temporary, and entails upon
them accumulated misery."</p>
<p>Then comes the story of a solitary and strange
success:&mdash;"Thursday, 16th February, 1832.&mdash;We regret to
announce the total loss of the whaling schooner, 'Madeira
Packet', belonging to Mr. Thomas Street, of Sydney, which took
place on a shoal of rocks, to the Northward of Moreton Bay. It
appears that the vessel having struck on the shoal and gone to
pieces, the crew took to their boats, with the mutual
understanding to proceed to Moreton Bay. Two out of three arrived
safe, but the other boat has not since been heard of. On the
arrival of the two at Moreton Bay, <em>a party of prisoners
seized one</em>, and put off to the 'Caledonia' (which was lying
near at the time), boarded her, and sent the crew ashore,
compelling the Captain to put to sea with them. She was commanded
by Mr. Browning, a clever young seaman in the Newcastle trade;
well found; and little doubt is entertained of their successful
escape."</p>
<p>Again, at about the same date, we lind the return of the
"Governor Phillip", which had, on the 3rd of the preceding
January, "taken a cargo of fashionables, invalids, and madmen to
Port Macquarie to reflect on the past, and think of the future,
as well as forty prisoners, to that place of secondary
punishment, Moreton Bay, among whom is that most public of all
characters, James Hardy Vaux&mdash;and by which we (in Sydney)
have received sixty-one prisoners from Moreton Bay. It appears
that the severe example made of McManus had not deterred men from
committing acts of violence against their fellows. Two prisoners
are in gaol for trial, one for attempting the life of
chief-constable McIntosh, and the other named McGuire, for the
murder of his comrade. McGuire, it appears, had absconded, and
being soon apprehended was placed in the gaol-gang, a life which
became irksome(!) to him, and in a fit of despair, he resolved to
increase those miseries by cleaving the head of another prisoner
with a pick-axe."</p>
<p>Really the following is a relief:</p>
<blockquote>"22nd December, 1833.&mdash;A man is under
examination by the police who stands charged with outwitting the
Commandant at Moreton Bay, under the following
circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. His name is Patrick
Flanagan, and he was sentenced to be transported to Moreton Bay
for fourteen years; his brother, Owen Flanagan, being sent there
about the same time, for three years. On arriving at the
settlement, they exchanged Christian names, each representing
himself as the other. Accordingly, at the termination of the
three years, Patrick procured himself to be sent up to Sydney in
the name of his brother Owen. The stratagem was so far
successful, and as soon as Patrick was clear of the coast, Owen
came forward and demanded his own freedom, alleging that if the
Commandant had suffered himself to be imposed upon by his
brother, that was nothing to him, and therefore, as his sentence
was really only for three years, which had now expired, he was
resolved to work no longer. Captain Clunie, however, as,
according to his own account, he had already practised one
deception, was not bound to believe his statement, and
accordingly detained him, sending a report to Sydney, that the
proper enquiries might be made."</blockquote>
<p>We must try back on the 26th of April, 1834, from humbug to
horror:</p>
<blockquote>"The 'Friendship' has been taken up by the Government
to convey prisoners to the settlement at Moreton Bay. We have
always slated that dreadful convulsions must necessarily be
expected at Norfolk Island from the very constitution of the
settlement. It differs from Moreton Bay, in being the place to
which the most abandoned of the human race with us are forwarded.
Hence the extraordinary desperation so frequently exhibited by
individuals, and lately communicated to the prisoners almost as a
body. Hope is in a manner shut out from hundreds in this modern
pandemonium. They see before them a life of misery and
degradation: for we hear that certain humane and consistent
instructions prepared and transmitted to Colonel Morrisett during
the temporary administration of Lieutenant-Governor Lindesay,
with the advice of the executive Council in the beginning of
1832, have actually been thrown on one side, and the emulation
which even a distant promise of freedom might have produced, is
lost amidst the gloomy despondency and horrors of the penal
system in operation there. We happen to know something of the
regulations alluded to, and regret (if true) that, for the sake
of humanity, they have not been posted on the public edifices
both at Moreton Bay and Norfolk Island (as directed), in order to
show the convict the fruits of good behaviour. Should these
orders be discovered on the shelves of the officers in charge,
and if, as a reasonable inference, the desperate conduct of the
prisoners be attributable to their negligence, such negligence
having a tendency to increase the remorseless ferocity of men who
disregard all human control, and will even commit murder in order
to be hanged, as a relief for their intolerable sufferings; then,
in the eyes of God and man, must those officers be considered
accountable for the lives lost, or the blood shed upon any
occasion of tumult or rebellion. Eminent for the consistent
humanity as the Government of General Bourke is, we are certain
that this matter will not be allowed to drop without a rigid
enquiry."</blockquote>
<p>I venture to reproduce the following as a justification to
some extent of remarks which I have already had occasion to make
during the progress of this journal, by making which it is just
possible I may be held to trespass ungenerously upon the withered
sward of the past. I take it from the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of
1835:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"17th November.&mdash;By the Government schooner
'Isabella', which arrived from Moreton Bay on Friday last.
Captain Clunie, of H.M. 17th Regiment, has returned to
head-quarters, after having discharged the onerous duty of
Commandant at that settlement for five years. Captain Clunie
unites in his own person those two rare qualities to be met with
conjointly, viz., that of a rigid disciplinarian and a
mild-mannered gentleman. The consequence has been that, since the
time he took command at Moreton Bay, we have heard of none of
those tumultuous risings and murderous doings among the prisoners
there which distinguished his predecessors reign of terror, and
which have since occasionally marked the character of the sister
settlement of Norfolk Island. Colonel Morrisett obtained the
permanent commandancy of Norfolk Island from the British
Government in consequence of the stern manner in which he
governed the penal settlement of Newcastle; but if the successful
career in which a secondary penal settlement is regulated, with a
view to work reformation as well as to enforce proper punishment
for the offenders entrusted to his charge, be any criterion for
continuing an officer in his command, Captain Clunie is beyond
any comparison the most qualified person of all others who has
perhaps yet filled that important situation. Captain Clunie has
been relieved in his command because the gallant regiment to
which he belongs is about to proceed to the East
Indies."</blockquote>
<p>Having cited sufficient authority, I think, to sustain the
charge of excess of discipline which drove wretched prisoners to
the dens of the savage, let me try to show how it happened that,
notwithstanding the general rule that such refugees were punched
on the head at once, some few had been spared, as in the case of
our two recovered fellow-men.</p>
<p>I must premise the explanation by repeating that all
information on the subject was given me by Bracefell and Davis. I
must ask attention to the assurance that I have already given,
that in no material point did the narrative as to the cause of
being spared differ; that Bracefell's statements had been made
days before Davis' appearance on the scene; and that the latter's
excited holding-forth was made at a time when exceeding ill-will
and silence prevailed between the two, and of any communication
then there could not have been a suspicion. And if there had,
<i>cui bono</i>, any design to mis-inform?</p>
<p>For my own part, I unreservedly believed, and to this day
believe, that what they said on that, and all other matters
concerning life and habits among the natives whom they knew, and
whose tribes had dwelt not far away from each other, was fact and
truth to the letter.</p>
<p>"Why were they spared?"</p>
<p>Cannibalism prevailed among these northern tribes. Petrie told
me that an old black, at whom I was looking near his house one
day at Brisbane, had not long before appeared there with a
child's foot in his hand, and treated it as a delicacy; and even
offered it to himself as a present! Whether <i>par
preference</i>, or lack of other food I could not understand in
this case, but the former conclusion seemed to be not
unreasonable.</p>
<p>Now, in the Bunnia season, when tribes from long distances
come in for their feast, <i>par excellence</i>, and are so
brought together in large numbers, one can well understand the
immediate exodus of all game, large and small, with the exception
of feathered fowl, from the thickly brushed region in which the
Bunnia-Bunnia grows. This <i>araucaria</i> is found only&mdash;as
yet at least&mdash;on the ranges which separate the Moreton from
the Wide Bay waters. It bears triennially; but, of course, a
proportion gives forth its produce every year. The
<i>araucaria</i>, which is found in a small quantity on the coast
of Brazil, is very similar, but the difference is marked. The
cone needs no description, nor the tree, now that it is so well
known. On the occasion of our falling in with Davis, there were
sixteen tribes collected together, and more were expected from
the north, <i>en route</i> to the great annual event. I think I
am not far out in supposing that each tribe could contribute from
seventy to eighty fighting men. Well! The marsupial family is
keen-scented, and objects to the neighbourhood of their natural
and "potent" enemies. I have myself watched in the moonlight by
the edge of a pine-brush, "dense enough to exclude light almost
in some places, which I knew held a large number of natives, and
a stranger scene than the issue thence of so grotesquely
progressing a procession, consisting of thousands of the same
family, from the "rat" to the "old man", I have never witnessed.
Thousands following thousands in their jerky retreat to
leeward&mdash;all in the same direction&mdash;bearing away,
doubtless, to some other well-known asylum of equally terrible
waste and brushy ranges, footed a weird-like dance on the moonlit
pastures of grass between each patch of black cover; in no
hurried scamper, however, but "taking it easy", judging from the
pranks they played.</p>
<p>The aboriginals have an aversion to compulsory vegetarianism.
The Bunnia-Bunnia becomes to them like sweets to a pastry cook's
boy. They tire of, and almost nauseate at, their daily bread.
They must have "flesh": snakes, grubs, and iguanas form no
fighting fare! And so they utilise their pugnacious propensities;
but in the Bunnia season, as a rule (though I am inclined to
think they are not scrupulously religious in the observance) they
reserve their friends who may fall in the diurnal fight for their
own nocturnal delicate attentions, by serving up the illustrious
corpses in a manner of cookery peculiar to their persuasions. For
they protest against such an inheritance as the scorned qualities
of a departed foe. Ah, no! they love their friends too well to
part from them even after death; and, by absorbing the viand of
their own brother's and warrior's arm or leg, cooked <i>en
régle</i> for an evening meal, so they assimilate to their
aspiring souls the virtues which that beloved one v. as wont to
display before his final roast! Think you, then, that these women
of ours are worthy of such ambrosial fare? <i>Moro toro</i>!
(stupid stomach!&mdash;slow belly!); pitch the "innards" to them
as they sit behind waiting the scramble for the bits!</p>
<p>But, what about the cooking? Well, where's the family recipe?
Ah, here it is! Take the dead man's nearest male relatives, and
turn him over to them: let them lay him in deep silence on his
face; let the women make a wide-spread bed of tire: and now ye
butcher boys! cut our departed brother's back open from the
"nape" to the "small": follow suit down the thighs and legs to
the heel; same across the shoulders and down the hinder muscles
of back and arm. Be handy, lads! if he get cold he won't strip so
easily. Now then! seize the edges and heave away the hide. And
so, limb by limb, divested of the panoply of <i>epidermis, rete
mucosum</i>, and <i>cutis</i>, stands out in bold relief the
flayed frame of the veritable "makromme", the "dead man" bound to
Beegie's bright abodes! Before that pleasanter arrangement
supervenes, however, another! See to it, ye cooks! Off with his
head, butcher boys! Now his arms I Well done! Bone them; thighs
and legs too! Turn him over! Off with the hide, from chin to toe.
So! Fire ready? So! Bring hither two emu spears; lay them on each
side; bind him well to them; plant two strong saplings in the
ground at each end of his baking bed; cross the ends at the top;
bind them together! Now then! One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;up!
Ship the spear ends on to each fork. Give him a turn now and
then&mdash;and there's a banquet <i>á la môde</i>!</p>
<p>But what has all this to do with Bracefell and Davis? The
flayed limbs exposed to the heat as they lie over the fire
beneath, having lost every drop of blood, become white. By some
inexplicable method the dead friend, useful to the last in
feeding his friends' lives, becomes absorbed by "Beegie's"
attracting and resistless power, and takes to basking beneath his
beams in happy indolence for a season.* That season&mdash;(happy
thought of their cunning old men) was coming to an end when white
men were sent drifting over the "tabil bann" (salt water) out of
the mansions of "Beegie" (who came out from the east every day to
search for his own on this dry land) to their old native shores
and early haunts, wandering in search of their own kindred tribe.
Now and then a "makromme" would chance that way, but they knew
him not: so declined further acquaintance, because none
recognised in him the features of some long lost comrade, brother
or son. Having no business to claim admission by such credentials
to their household, they cut him in the approved fashion of the
day out of their <i>beau monde</i>, by the help of spear or
nulla-nulla.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Savage instinct of a future.]</p>
<p>But, lo! one day, the mighty "Eumundy", struck by the
never-forgotten lineaments traced on a "mackromme's" face, though
denuded of their birth-right glory, acknowledged the glad
presence of a long-ago lost and devoured son-and-heir! So, too,
had the exultant Pamby-Pamby found, and cherished his prodigal in
the person of the unconscious Derhamboi.</p>
<p>In a word, fancied resemblance of feature in both instances
had been the passport by which Bracefell and Davis had reached
each a safe refuge, freedom and&mdash;a father.</p>
<p>The gins were forbidden present participation in such
aldermanic luxury of diet; but they were allowed to pick the less
honourable portions of the <i>reliqiæ sacræ</i> of the dear
departed.</p>
<p>Derhamboi decidedly became amusing when he set forth, by the
usual mimic language without words, an act of sacrilege, by means
of which, when left alone one day in camp by the hunting men, who
were off to a distant "meet", these gentle <em>gourmandes</em>
assisted an aged, weakly sister in making a "move out" of the
limited space and span of life left to her at a quicker pace than
the creature approved. A gentle tap from behind; a half-and-half
preparation for the oven; a hasty snack; an ingenious concealment
of the remainder of the joint in the hollow limb of a large tree,
some height up it; the hurried scramble through the afternoon,
each one by turns, to the hidden treasure for another pick; the
fear of detection, and their lords' return; and the ultimate
discovery of the forbidden fruit, betrayed by the flies, which
swarmed about it as the bees around their "sugarbag".</p>
<p>I confess that, in spite of the disgustful truthfulness of the
portraiture, I laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Bracefell and Davis were always loud and earnest in their
protestations of having kept their own hands clean of such
defilement: I put no strain upon my credulity by implicitly
believing their assurances.</p>
<p>The "hide" of the dead man was stretched on spears, and dried
in the smoke. After which process, it was usually cut into
strips, laid up in rolls, and given as a <i>souvenir</i> to the
nearest surviving relative, who always carried it in the
grass-bag over the shoulder. The bones were also preserved, but
most frequently "planted" in some hollow branch of a tree, with
the skull. Some time afterwards, I found one of these "planted"
skulls in the country, at the back of Wide Bay, and took it with
me, as well as a portion of "smoked hide", (yielded up to the
persuasive "plug"&mdash;tobacco) to England, in 1849, and so got
myself into disgrace, as the owner of such loathsome relics.
Nevertheless, they were accepted as curio s, when offered, and
prized when accepted. One young lady walked one morning into my
room, in London, took up the "roll" from my writing table "Oh! is
this the tobacco I have heard of so often from my brother out
there?" On my explaining, she nearly took to fainting: she never
handled knick-knacks of mine afterwards.</p>

<p>Not long after our return, Bracefell and Davis&mdash;both
having received "manumission" upon Petrie's report to the
Government&mdash;were taken by Simpson&mdash;Lands
Commissioner&mdash;to his new residence of Woogooroo on the
Brisbane. Bracefell was killed by the falling of a tree. They had
been identified with the two lost men whom they represented

<p>But I searched a long while afterwards for some public notice
of the wreck of the "Stirling Castle", and found that it had been
dealt with in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>. The accounts given in it
made no mention of the name of Bracefell. They had been issued
six years before his return with us. As every member of our party
believed, and as I this day implicitly believe the truth of
Bracefell's yarn, the discrepancies of these accounts&mdash;in
view of it, as it lies now, in old notes before me&mdash;were
startling. The error as to the spot on which the "brig" had been
wrecked is of little importance. Reports at Brisbane of the
disaster through the blacks, were not likely to fix it correctly.
But how about the escape of Mrs. Fraser? I have gathered, the
"Stirling Castle" left Sydney on the 15th May, 1836. The news of
her loss reached Sydney on the 10th September. The statement of
one Robert Hodge was published three days after: and the first
detailed account appeared on the 18th of October.</p>
<blockquote><i>Sydney Gazette</i>. 13th September, 1836. "In our
last number we reported the less of the brig 'Stirling Castle',
James Fraser, commander, on the north-east coast of New Holland,
since which, her agents, Messrs. S.A. Bryant and Co., have
favoured us with still further particulars, which lead us to hope
that the master, his wife, and a great portion of the crew may
yet be saved. One of the seamen&mdash;Robert Hodge&mdash;who made
his way from the wreck to the Macleay river, has arrived in
Sydney, and been placed in the General Hospital. This man states
that after the 'Stirling Castle' left Sydney, they had very fine
weather and fair winds; that on the Saturday night after leaving
Sydney, or the Sunday, about half-past nine o'clock, the brig
struck upon a reef, and stove in her bottom, and broke her back
in two places. The next morning, the water was up to her lower
deck beams, and the mate slated they were about nine hundred
miles from Sydney, and one hundred from the mainland. They
remained with the brig two days, and then took to the long-boat
and pinnace, and made the land, but he does not know
whereabouts.<br>
<br>
"They took very little provision with them, as the mate said they
could get plenty from the missionaries. [There could be none
nearer than Moreton Bay.] The boats kept company for some time.
The pinnace, being the fastest sailor, was frequently sent away
to seek water, and in this manner, after beating to windward all
day, they missed the long-boat at night, and ran many miles to
leeward to where they had left her. They then gave the long-boat
up as lost, and prosecuted their course to the southward, running
before the wind night and day. The crew of the pinnace at this
time consisted of the carpenter, boatswain, cook, a boy named
Fraser (the captain's nephew), two seamen, and the narrator. The
boy was drowned soon after the boats parted company; he slipped
from a rock while he was gathering shell-fish.<br>
<br>
"Soon after this the boat was stove, and the men obliged to
pursue their way by land through the bush, subsisting upon grass
and wild herbs. One of the crew&mdash;a sailor&mdash;was burnt to
death while sleeping in a hut; another was drowned in attempting
to cross a river; the boatswain and carpenter were left on an
island in the middle of the 'Big river' (Clarence) to the
northward of the Macleay, in consequence of the blacks refusing
to put them over, through a dispute about a waistcoat. The cook
sunk exhausted about fifteen miles from the Macleay river; and
Hodge, when he arrived in Sydney, was in a most deplorable
condition.<br>
<br>
"The revenue cutter 'Prince George'&mdash;Captain
Roach&mdash;returned on Saturday last from a coasting trip to the
northward in search of the unfortunate crew of the 'Stirling
Castle' bringing up Mrs. Fraser (wife of the captain), John
Baxter (second mate), Joseph Corallis (steward), Robert Drag,
Harry Goulden. Robert Dragman, and Robert Carey (seamen).<br>
<br>
"Captain Roach informs us that he was unsuccessful in discovering
the two men who were reported (by Hodge) to be upon the coast to
the northward of the river Macleay: that he traced their
footsteps and observed other traces of their residence for a long
distance, from which he supposes the men must be travelling in a
southerly direction, and should they survive, will reach Port
Macquarie on the Macleay.<br>
<br>
"Captain Roach inquired at the former place for the unfortunates,
but no tidings had been heard. Captain Roach found the huts of
these men; but they appeared to have been deserted some time
since, from the remains of some dried fish, &amp;c. The party,
which has come up in the revenue cutter, was at Moreton Bay, and
had been rescued from their miserable state by the perseverance
of Lieutenant Otter and his surveying party, who went out and
fell in with Mrs. Fraser(?) and the six men, who had been treated
in the most brutal manner by the natives for some months. Captain
Fraser was speared to death because he was incapable of carrying
wood for the savages when in a very sickly condition; and the
chief mate (Brown) was burnt to death. Mrs. Fraser and her
companions, although allowed to exist, were subject to equal
tortures. The natives fed them on the entrails of snakes,
fish-bones and such-like, and when discovered by Lieutenant Otter
were in the midst of an immense number of blacks, who were
celebrating a grand corroboree, or dance, round the prisoners.
Captain Roach found the body of the man mentioned in our previous
report, who was burnt to death in a hut, and buried it on the
island. The carpenter and boatswain are the only two persons now
missing from the 'Stirling Castle' and it is somewhat doubtful
whether they will ever reach any of the
settlements."</blockquote>
<p>So, from the crew of the pinnace, Hodge was the only survivor.
The <i>Gazette</i> goes on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Since writing the above, we have received the
following memorandum from the second mate (Baxter), who has
provided us with the full particulars of the wreck and the
miseries he endured with the rest while in the hands of the
savages.<br>
<br>
"The brig 'Stirling Castle' was wrecked on Saturday evening, the
21st May, on Eliza Reef, in latitude 24 deg. and longitude E. 155
deg. 22 min., and steering at the time of the accident N.W. by
N.½N., the ship running 7½ knots. Left the brig on Sunday, 22nd.
Made the first land on the 30th, on an
island&mdash;unknown&mdash;about 11 a.m.<br>
<br>
"The boats were here turned over and patched up as well as
possible, after which, on the third day, the remaining stores and
baggage were again put into the boats, and put to sea with the
intention of making Repulse Bay 'for assistance' (from whom?) The
pinnace afterwards parted company with the launch (long boat),
leaving with us a piece of beef weighing four pounds, 13 gallons
of beer and water mixed, one gallon of brandy, and seven pounds
of wet bread. In the pinnace were Edward Stone, boatswain, James
Major, Robert Hodge, John Copeland, seamen, Jacob Allen, cook, a
boy named John Fraser, and the carpenter.<br>
<br>
"The boat's crew was taken by the natives on the 26th of June,
and on the 15th of August, released by a person named Graham,
accompanied by Lieutenant Otter and his party. Arrived at
Brisbane Town, Moreton Bay, on Monday, the 22nd of
August."</blockquote>
<p>Was Mrs. Frazer among the "crew" released on the 15th August?
The <i>Gazette</i> adds:</p>
<blockquote>"Was Mrs. Fraser among the 'crew' released on the
15th August?<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Frazer called at our office on Saturday afternoon, and gave
us the following particulars: The long-boat's company consisted
of Captain Fraser, Brown, the chief officer, Baxter, the second
mate, and herself. She does not here speak of the 'rest of the
crew' as she did in London. After they had been ashore some time
a great number of natives were observed, and her husband
suggested giving themselves up quietly as they were entirely
defenceless. They had scarcely time to make the suggestions, when
several tribes came down upon them, one of whom immediately
captured her husband; another tribe took Brown, and a third
Baxter. They would not allow Mrs. Fraser to go with either of
them, and left her alone upon a sandy bank the whole of that day:
and the day following, a number of old women came down to the
beach with some children. They gave Mrs. Fraser to understand
that she must go with them, and carry one of the children upon
her shoulders, which she of necessity complied with. Mrs. Fraser
states that she travelled many miles into the bush with these
women and the child, and was frequently exhausted.<br>
<br>
"She remained about three weeks with these people when she fell
in with her husband, who was dragging a load of wood for the
natives, in which he had been principally engaged since the time
he parted from his wife.<br>
<br>
"Captain Fraser was so dreadfully fatigued that he could not move
a load that had been consigned to him, and implored his wife to
assist him. Mrs. Frazer states, that she had neither strength nor
liberty to do so, she herself being employed in the same manner,
and the natives keeping a sharp look out after her. She was under
the necessity of leaving him, and when she returned afterwards,
found that he was speared in the back of the shoulders, which had
been inflicted upon him for not making any progress with the
wood. Mrs. Fraser remained with her husband until sun-down, when
he expired of his wounds. His last words were 'Eliza, I'm
gone.'<br>
<br>
"The savages immediately dragged her away from the body, dug a
hole and buried it. In eight days from this brutal affair, the
same cannibals also killed Brown, by holding fire-brands to his
legs and so burning him upwards. The cause of their destroying
Brown was in consequence of his showing signs of dissatisfaction
at the death of his chief.<br>
<br>
"The party now consisted of only two persons&mdash;Mrs. Fraser
and Baxter&mdash;but they were parted from each other at many
miles distance, a large river running between them. These two
unfortunate creatures remained with the natives about two months
before they were rescued, enduring the greatest miseries from
hunger, Mrs. Fraser being employed cutting down and carrying
wood, fetching water, and fishing for the natives; and Baxter was
engaged in the same manner on the other side of the river.<br>
<br>
"The steward of the brig&mdash;Joseph&mdash;had walked overland
to Moreton Bay, and gave information of the situation of Mrs.
Fraser and her unfortunate companions, when a man named Graham,
who was well acquainted with the bush, volunteered to head a
party to the shipwrecked people, and pledged himself to rescue
them from the blacks. Lieutenant Otter, and a party were
immediately despatched, and with Graham went in search of the
unfortunate people.<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Fraser slates that Graham went into the midst of the
natives, and, at the risk of his life, snatched her up, and ran
away to his party with her, and afterwards recovered the second
officer in the same courageous manner.*</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* "Snatched up and ran away with" (<em>é more
Sabino</em>!) from the midst of such a wild, excited, and
"immense" assemblage (<i>Consualia Australiana!</i>) and on both
occasions passively robbed of their prisoners.]</p>
<blockquote>"Mrs. Fraser requests us to make public her
expressions of gratitude to those who have assisted her out of
misery and relieved her distresses, and begs us to thank them for
their humane conduct towards her: the Commandant of Moreton Bay,
Lieutenant Otter, Mr. Commissariat Owen. Captain Roach, and
several other gentlemen of Moreton Bay."</blockquote>
<p>More than a year later the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, Thursday,
1st February, 1838, having fresh light thrown upon this horrid
tale of the sea, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The statements made by Mrs. Fraser and others,
regarding the loss of the 'Stirling Castle' on her voyage from
Sydney to Singapore, differ so materially in detail from the
statements made by the same parties here, that we have been
induced, by the request of several of our readers, to publish
them."</blockquote>
<p>The following account is taken from Alexander's <i>East India
and Colonial Magazine</i> for September, 1837, London.</p>
<blockquote>"The attention of the chief magistrate in the city
has been, during the last month, occupied in examining the
deplorable case of Mrs. Fraser and others, who have miraculously
survived an awful shipwreck, and the cruelties practised upon
them by the savages of New South Wales, amongst whom they were
thrown, and by whom the majority of the ship's crew have been
enslaved in lowest bondage, and, in short, tortured to death by
means at which the old Inquisition of Spain might blush. 'Truth
is stranger than fiction', observes one of our poets, and there
are circumstances related in the following narrative which no
human imagination could depict; and yet Providence has willed
that such extraordinary and romantic events should actually take
place, as it were, to teach mortality that there are such things
in heaven and earth beyond the reach of human philosophy or
anticipation. We observe that through the instrumentality of the
Lord Mayor and the press, a general sympathy has been excited by
the surviving sufferers, viz., Mrs. Fraser (the widow of the late
captain of the 'Stirling Castle') and the second mate, Baxter. We
willingly lend our assistance to the praiseworthy object in
detailing the facts of the statements that have appeared,
describing in plain but faithful colours the shipwreck of the
'Stirling Castle', and the adventures which in consequence
resulted to the crew."</blockquote>
<p>It appears, from the second mate Baxter's account, that the
vessel struck some few days after leaving port on a reef of
coral, and the consequence was that her masts were cut away: soon
becoming a total wreck, the crew took to the boats; parting, it
is supposed that the missing boat's crew were lost at sea, or
possibly met with such a death as that of most of their
companions, whose story is related in Mrs. Fraser's narrative, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On the 15th of May (Sunday), 1836, the 'Stirling
Castle' left Sydney for the purpose of going to Singapore. On the
23rd, (Monday), when they were approaching Torres Straits, it
blew very hard, and there being a current near the 'Eliza' coral
reef, which the vessel was unable to resist, she struck on the
reef at about nine o'clock at night, when the captain was
incapable, on account of hazy weather, of making observations.
There were about eighteen men on board, two boys, and Mrs.
Fraser, the captain's wife, who was far advanced in pregnancy.
Two of the men who were labouring at the wheel were killed when
the ship struck, and the cabins were dashed into the hold,
together with all the bread, beef, pork and other provisions. The
crew, when the tempest ceased, contrived to cut away the masts in
the expectation that the vessel would right herself, by turning
up her beam ends, and she did in some degree change position, but
not to any serviceable extent. They, therefore, determined to get
away as well as they could in the long-boat and the pinnace,
which they had contrived to keep secure, the two other boats
which were attached to the ship having been swept away by the
fury of the elements. They knew that they were to the northward
of Moreton Bay, a portion of the settlements of the English
crown, and they determined to make for that place with as much
expedition as possible.<br>
<br>
"Accordingly, having worked with most desperate industry until
lour o'clock on Sunday, they disembarked from the vessel, and
took to the boats. The ship's carpenter, the cook, the cook's
mate, John Fraser (the captains nephew), the boatswain, Edward
Stone and Bill Lorton, a seaman, took to the pinnace, while the
captain, his wife, the chief mate (Brown), and second mate
(Baxter), the two boys and the rest of the crew, took to the
long-boat. Four days after they had committed themselves to the
care of Providence, Mrs. Fraser was delivered of a child, while
up to her waist in water in the long-boat. The infant was born
alive, but after a few gasps was drowned, and the first mate
wrapped up the body in a part of his shirt, which he tore from
his back for the purpose, and let it go with the tide. The poor
mother could not' account for the extraordinary vigour with which
she was able to bear up against this calamity, added to the other
calamities to which she was doomed to be exposed. Fortunately she
was for some time in a state of insensibility, and it was not
until a considerable time after the child was consigned to the
deep, aware that it was brought into the world, from which it was
so rapidly hurried away. For a great many days they endeavoured
in vain to reach Moreton Bay, being all the time without any
food, except a small quantity of the lees of hops, which they
found in a cask. They suffered dreadfully from thirst, as well as
hunger, while in this awful situation. At last they reached a
large rock, to which they fastened their boats, and they went in
quest of oysters and water; but their disappointments multiplied
upon them, and they stretched themselves along in expectation of
a speedy release from their sufferings by the interposition of
another tempest. In the morning those who belonged to the
long-boat were astonished to find that the pinnace and the men
who had accompanied her, had altogether disappeared.* These
unfortunate fellows were never heard of more, and their comrades
in calamity could not conjecture what their motive could be for
making an experiment by themselves without the aid of the
experience of the captain and his mates, whom they left
behind.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Compare Robert Hodge's statement.]</p>
<blockquote>"The captain's view was, all along, after they had
been obliged to quit the ship, to reach Moreton Bay, but, finding
that the 'wind and current were dead against his object, and his
companions being reduced to the extremity of lying on their backs
in the boat with their tongues out to catch the damp of the dews
that fell, he resolved to make for the nearest land. It was a
choice of most awful evils, for he knew that the shore, which it
was probable they would reach, was visited by tribes of
savages.'<br>
<br>
"They bore away <i>before the wind</i> prepared lo meet death in
whatever shape it might present itself, and so exhausted with
suffering as to be careless whether they were to die by the hands
of the natives or to be overwhelmed by the waves. At last they
came within sight of land, and soon afterwards their boat ran
into and landed in a place called Wide Bay. They were now within
a hundred miles to the north of Moreton Bay, which is the
principal of the penal settlements to which the incorrigible
convicts are sent to pass the remainder of their days, in
unintermitted labour; and just as they reached the land they
caught sight of a vast crowd of naked savages, who soon
approached the beach, evidently delighted with the prize that
presented itself. The savages surrounded the boat, and running it
up carried it from the beach lo the bush with its crew just as
they were. The moment they laid the boat on the ground they began
to strip the men of their clothes, commencing with the captain
and the chief officers. John Baxter, the second mate, endeavoured
to hide a shirt ornament in which his aunt's hair was contained,
having willingly yielded up everything else; but the savages
became infuriated at the attempt at concealment, and beat him
dreadfully. It is unnecessary to say that they tore the trinket
from him. They broke in pieces the watches and chronometers, and
each took a portion of the machinery to stick in their noses and
ears, and after having divided amongst themselves the various
portions of apparel of which they had stripped their captives
they threw them to appease their hunger the the heads and guts of
the fish upon which they had lately been making their meal. The
savages, after having detained them two days, took them further
up into the bush, and drove them onward, that they might, as they
soon ascertained, fall into the hands of <i>other tribes</i>, by
whom an ingenious variety was to be given to their sufferings.
The captain endeavoured to prevail upon them to accept the
services of the crew for a longer time being apprehensive that
any change amongst the natives would be for the worse; but they
beat all the now naked whites on before them, until <i>fresh
tribes</i> came up and took <i>each of them a prisoner</i>, and
set him to work carrying pieces of trees, and toiling in other
exhausting ways.<br>
<br>
"Mrs. Fraser, being the only woman, was not selected by any of
the tribes, but was left by herself, while they went onward; but
her husband got an opportunity to mention to her not to stir from
the place at which she was at the moment, and that he would
contrive to see her in a few hours. During that night she lay in
a cleft of the rock, and in the morning, after looking about
without seeing a creature, she determined to follow some
footmarks, and after having proceeded some distance, she saw a
crowd of black women approach.<br>
<br>
"These women belonged to the tribe of savages by whom her husband
had been taken up the bush on the preceding day, and they set her
to work in trailing wood and lighting tires. Being quite naked,
and presenting a contrast in her skin which the natives did not
like, she was compelled by them to rub herself all over with gum
and herbs, which had the effect of making her nearly as dark as
themselves. They likewise tattooed her all over, and, having
pulled her hair out, covered her head with a sort of gum and
stuck the feathers of parrots and other birds all over it. One of
the women, having two children, obliged her to nurse one of them,
notwithstanding the severe labour she had to perform, and if the
child was out of temper the nurse was kicked and scratched and
thumped for its peevishness.<br>
<br>
"At the expiration of four days Mrs. Fraser saw her husband for
the first time since their separation. He was dragging along a
tree, and was greatly fatigued. She had just begun to inquire how
it happened that he did not manage to let her know where he was,
to which he was replying that he dared not look for her, when his
tribe suddenly appeared. One of them having seen them together,
made a push at the captain with a spear, and pierced him right
through the body, and he was a corpse in an instant. Mrs. Fraser
ran to her husband, cried out 'Jesus of Nazareth, I can endure
this no longer,' and pulled the spear out of the body, but the
breath was gone for ever! She then fell senseless and remained so
a considerable time; and when she recovered her senses she found
herself along with the tribe which she was obliged to serve; but
what became of the body of Captain Fraser she never could learn,
and, of course, the barbarous region in which she was enslaved
was no place for sympathy. Shortly after this catastrophe the
first officer (Brown), of the ship, having been informed that the
captain had been murdered by one of the tribes, formed, in a fit
of desperation, a plan of revenge, fettered and exhausted with
labour as he was. His intention was, however, discovered, and
horrible was his punishment. Mrs. Fraser had just lighted a fire
by order of her tribe, and the unfortunate man's legs were thrust
into it and consumed, while he, by the violence of his
contortions actually worked for the rest of his body a grave in
the sand, in which it was embedded. Two days after this horrible
event, a fine looking young man, named James Major, was disposed
of. Captain Fraser, who knew a good deal of the character and
habits of the savages on this coast, had mentioned to Major that
the savages would take off his head for a figure bust for one of
their canoes. It seemed, too, that it was usual for the savage
who contemplated that sort of execution to smile in the face of
his victim immediately before he struck him to the earth. While
Major was at work the chief of the tribe approached him smiling,
and tapped him on the shoulder. At that instant the poor fellow
received a blow on the back of the neck from a waddie or crooked
stick, which stunned him. He fell to the ground, and a couple of
savages set to work, and by means of sharpened shells severed the
head from the body with frightful lacerations. They then ate
parts of the body, and preserved the head with certain gums of
extraordinary efficacy, and affixed it as a figure bust to one of
their canoes.<br>
<br>
"The rest of the crew expected nothing less, of course, than
death. Their apprehension appeared to relate rather to the mode
of inflicting the extreme penalty, than to the fact that they
must prematurely die. Two of the seamen, Doyle and Big Ben,
contrived to steal a canoe, and endeavoured to cross an inland
lake, but were drowned in the attempt to escape from, perhaps, a
more painful death.<br>
<br>
"There was a black man named Joseph, who had been steward on
board the 'Stirling Castle'. When the savages seized the
long-boat in which the crew had entered Wide Bay, they stripped
Joseph as well as the rest, but as he was of their own colour
they inflicted no punishment upon him, and he had the privilege
of going about, which was denied to any other of the wretched
strangers. This man, who was constantly watching for an
opportunity to escape, had assured Mrs. Fraser that if he could
get away the first life he should think of saving would be that
of his mistress. He succeeded in stealing a canoe, in which he
rowed off, and in six weeks he reached Moreton Bay, when he
informed the commandant of the penal settlement of the horrible
circumstances which had taken place at Wide Bay, and of the
servitude in which the survivors of the crew were detained.<br>
<br>
"The Moreton Bay commandant, immediately upon hearing it,
inquired in the barracks whether any of the military would
volunteer to save a lady and several of the crew of a wrecked
vessel from the savages in the bush, <i>and a number offered</i>
themselves at a moments notice." [But no mention of
'Graham!']<br>
<br>
"(N.B.) By a system of man&oelig;uvring, entered into by a
convict who had been for some years in the bush among the
savages, the object was effected. All the survivors were, to the
best of Mrs. Fraser's belief, rescued from the savages. At the
camp(!) the commandant, and the commissary, and, in fact, all the
individuals who were in the service of the Government, treated
Mrs. Fraser and her companions in misfortune with a degree of
kindness which, it was evident, the former has a very warm
recollection of. She was placed under medical care immediately,
and everything that was considered likely to abate the sense of
what she had undergone, in witnessing the murder of her husband
and the other persons by whom she had been surrounded, was
done.<br>
<br>
"The captain of the 'Mediterranean Packet', in which Mrs. Fraser
arrived from Liverpool, stated that he was in Sydney at the time
of the arrival of that lady, and that the circumstances detailed
caused the greatest excitement there. The convict, to whose
extraordinary exertions Mrs. Fraser owed her escape, obtained a
free pardon from the Government there, and a reward of thirty
guineas."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Where is it shown that Mrs. Fraser was with or even near any
of the shipwrecked people when she was rescued? According to
these public narrations they had been separated and kept captive
by different tribes. Captain Roach repeated what he had heard
from others, and in good faith, perhaps, believed that finding
Mrs. Fraser and the six men at Moreton Bay together, whom he
brought down in the revenue cutter, made it reasonable for him to
infer that they had been rescued at the same time.</p>
<p>The <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, next after Hodge's account, given
on 13th September, 1836, says:&mdash;"On Saturday last the pilot
from Moreton Bay arrived in the revenue cutter, who states that a
surveying party, under the command of Lieutenant Otter, at
Moreton Bay, fell in with some of the crew who had left in the
long-boat, about fifty miles to the northward of the settlement.
The seamen stated they had parted with the captain, his wife, and
the remainder of the crew of the long-boat"&mdash;[We see that
they had been driven into the bush after capture, that the
captain was murdered and Baxter separated from his widow, and
that Brown was roasted and eaten]&mdash;"about one hundred and
forty miles further north; * that the blacks had stripped them,
but in other respects had been friendly. They also stated that
they had travelled overland to where they were met by the
surveying party, and that two had been drowned in endeavouring to
cross a large river. Upon hearing this intelligence the
commandant at Moreton Bay despatched two whaleboats with clothes
and provisions and an experienced pilot along shore, for the
purpose of looking for the unfortunate people left to the
northward" (now reduced in number to Mrs. Fraser and Baxter, who
were kept jealously separated). "His Excellency the Governor has
been solicited by the agents, and, we believe, has signified his
intention of sending a vessel in search of the carpenter and
boatswain."</p>
<p class="foot">[* The earliest and probably least garbled
account of the recovery of the seamen.]</p>
<p>Accordingly, it appears Captain Roach and the "Prince George"
were despatched, to go to Moreton Bay, and bring thence, Mrs.
Fraser and the six survivors of the "long boat crew", and the
story had increased, "gathered", and in the <i>Gazette</i> of the
18th of October, was given. At the latter end of the London
sensational account, <i>whose</i> was the man&oelig;uvring spoken
of as that "entered into by a convict, who had been fur some
years in the bush among the savages?" Mrs. Fraser's far apart
descriptions of the circumstances attending her husband's death
are strangely at variance too.</p>
<p>Her escape by the help of a runaway convict, to Brisbane, was
spoken of in my day. I heard no more as to his disposal. Who was
this Graham? Such a name never reached our ears.</p>
<p>Who can find the record of a "free pardon and reward of thirty
guineas," granted to the "convict, to whose extraordinary
exertions" she "owed her escape?" Cannot this be linked on to
Bracefell's own declarations to us at Wide Ray from the
first?</p>
<p>One record alone perhaps could settle the question, viz.,
Lieutenant Otter's own report of the event, if there be any in
existence. If such is to be discovered, it must be in London. And
where's Lieutenant Otter? Poor Bracefell told the truth. Had he
been caught when he brought in Mrs. Fraser, we should not have
found him, in 1842, where we did. It, doubtless, suited Mrs.
Fraser that she should be reported as one of the party rescued by
Lieutenant Otter, under the guidance of "Graham".</p>
<p>The presumption is justifiable that Baxter had&mdash;as his
shipmates dispersed among the tribes had done&mdash;escaped from
his captors, who had, under the aspect of Bracefell's story,
grown less watchful; and that of the "crew" spoken of by Baxter
as having been "released by a person named Graham" (who well
might have been a reality&mdash;a prisoner of the better class
usually selected to attend upon and do work for the surveying
parties), according to the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of the 18th of
October, 1836. Baxter himself was one. What more probable, too,
that the vigilance of the natives having subsided, Mrs. Fraser
and Bracefell made their escape about the same time in the manner
he spoke of to us at Wide Bay? Is it likely that if Baxter had
had any knowledge of the method, or been in any way connected
with Mrs. Fraser's method of evasion, and had they been in
company in effecting it, he would have omitted to make mention of
her in his own statements?</p>
<p>The conclusion&mdash;to me at least&mdash;seems most
reasonable, that the "crew" met and brought in by the surveying
party had fallen in with each other in their one course of escape
to the southward (Brisbane), consisted of the survivors,
including Baxter; and that about the same time Mrs. Fraser had
been, as said, guided, to "Meginchen" by Bracefell&mdash;the sole
witness to her degradation, and the sole being to whom she had
placed herself under a heavy obligation which she dared not
ignore while he was by her side, and might never be able to
fulfil. Bracefell (when, in expressive slang, she "rounded upon
him") left her in terror, and she was safe. Did she ever dream of
his reappearing upon the stage in a new character? No! So she
became identified with those rescued by Lieutenant Otter and
brought to Sydney by Captain Roach in the revenue-cutter "Prince
George". Her imposition upon the Londoners, which I shrink from
explaining, but recollect well, tallied well with my to-day
conjectures as to her character. The "issue" of the general
sympathy is "pillowed" on my recollection of laughable frauds
successfully practised at that time in London.</p>
<p>The Bunnia-Bunnia (<i>araucaria Bidwellii</i>), which
expresses so much in aboriginal traditions, claims a few remarks
before passing on from Wide Bay.</p>
<p>Andrew Petrie, who held the post of "foreman of works",
January, 1836, under the Government, at Brisbane, was the first
white, intelligent discoverer of this tree, sometime, I think, in
1838. Under the guidance of some blacks, he had visited a spot on
which it grew, took a drawing of it, and brought in a sample of
the timber, the finding of which, and his opinion as to its value
he at once reported. It got the name of "<i>pinus Petriana</i>;"
deservedly, I should have thought, but not, it seemed, in
accordance with the manorial rights of red-tape.</p>
<p>Shortly after my return to Cecil Plains, on the Condamine,
from this boating trip to Wide Bay, I started off for the purpose
of following up the track which Eales' sheep, led by Jolliffe,
had already, with the help of Davis through the range, left
behind him <i>en route</i> to the Monoboola, in search still of a
run. At Kilcoy, a station high up one of the Brisbane affluents,
formed by Evan and Colin Mackenzie, I found an attaché to the
Botanical Society in London, of which Dr. Lindley was the
presiding spirit. His name was Bidwell. In search of fresh
specimens of vegetation, he had got so far, intent upon finding
Bunnia specimens, and, if possible, obtaining some young plants,
which he could send home in a Wardian case. Little used to the
bush, he was glad of my offer to help him, the Bunnia district
being on my course Northwards.</p>
<p>In a very few miles, we found, under a magnificient scion of
this family, no less than ten healthy seedlings. Bidwell spudded
up but three, and sent them to London by the first ship. One of
these I saw at Kew Gardens in 1856. Half-hardy, it was in a
glass-house, about twelve feet high, strong and promising.
Another at Chatsworth, equally flourishing. What became of the
third, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Being reported in this fashion, it became known, <i>de
rigueur</i>, as the "<i>araucaria Bidwellii</i>" for all time;
the true worker's&mdash;Petrie's&mdash;solid claim was outbid by
the less title to fame. I can recollect cones of the Bunnia being
sold at "Stevens'" * for ten guineas each. There were but three;
one, of course, went to Chatsworth.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Covent Garden, London.]</p>
<p>The Bunnia bears but once in three years. Of the habits of the
blacks, when assembled at their annual feast, I need say no more
than I have. As to their cannibal doings, I can add nothing, but
that as the white man, "makromme", is looked upon as a
resuscitated meal of the past, they make no ado about eating him
as he is, believing, that they are unable a second time to
deprive him of what he has already parted with&mdash;his skin!
They extract always the bones of arms, legs and thighs before
cooking. Such is men's food! Pluck and heart, women's. One
horrible and unnatural exemption in favor of this female
indulgence in such gastronomy, is, that the mother is permitted
always to eat her child, if a <i>female</i>, should it die; but
the father always pays the same delicate attention to his male
infant!</p>
<p>There is one grand occasion, a descriptive account of which to
any detailed extent, I never succeeded in obtaining from
Bracefell nor Davis. There was a shyness in answering any
question as to an important ceremonial called the Bundinavah,
which was unmistakeable. No women, under pain of death, were
suffered to witness, or be in the vicinity of its performance. It
was some kind of right in which the old men were high priests.
Whether from some repulsive obscenities enacted on the occasion,
or, at any rate, some dread of disclosing to civilised men these
Eleusinian mysteries, I know not, but the reluctance to approach
the question was evident. The tourr circus was always used on the
occasions of the Bundinavah:</p>
<p>After this formidable ceremonial&mdash;whatever it
was&mdash;occurred the occasions of marrying and giving in
marriage. The young aspirant to the hand&mdash;not the heart,
which is beneath his notice&mdash;of some bewitcher, he having
already made it all right with the old men, and his mates in the
tribe, skips, on a moonlight night, to the topmost branch of a
tree, in the mode already shown me by Davis. Bewitcher does the
same up another at a little distance. The youth begins to plead
in plaintive phrases; bewitcher replies with a laugh, and chaff,
and "I wish you may get it!" Youth gets angry and retorts; chaff
on both sides becomes more voluble; the squatting audience at the
camp fire laugh when their fancies are tickled; grunt approval at
any unusually smart rejoinder, or slapping their thighs,
signifying our clapping the hands. And when an old man rises, and
makes a speech to the couple perched above, no end of slapping
denotes their applause. Much more feelingly than "hear! hear!"
Down comes the wooing swain, and down comes she; and led by an
old man to a cleared pathway, which traversed the bush some
hundred yards, the happy pair find their "Gretna Green" at the
end of it; on which is set up the humpy prepared for a honeymoon
establishment. Blessed in their ignorance of the lawful
privileges of a white sisterhood's British privileges, the sable
belle would dare upon no domestic bargaining for her lord's
birthright breeches! Woe, unto thee, bewitcher! if thou offendest
the loving bridegroom but the next day, by some pert assumption
of yesterday's past freedom! Woe, unto thee! if thou steppest
over his feet while lying lazy on the ground of his new dwelling
place! Woe, unto thee! if when called to the circle of your lords
round the council fire, you dare pass through the royal ring!
Woe, unto thee! if thou darest approach but as a half-starved
dog&mdash;from behind! The spear or the waddie would surely end
thy woes!</p>
<p>I have found that any account of native habits in the tribe
cannot, as a rule, be accepted as accurate with respect to the
practices even in a neighbouring district. Yet invariably, as
their trees in Antipodean whim, would shed their bark, so would
the sable belles their hair; not, however, in puerile pride,
after the fashion of <i>our</i> ladies' "<i>Dianæ" days</i> nor
(being guileless of Darwinian dishonour) in desire of evidencing
<i>cercopithecan</i> descent, by wearing the burden of the nape's
natural glory, in Simian frontispieced emulation of the ape's
muzzle. As to tribal characteristics no dependence can be placed
upon the knowledge of those found in one of these bush families
as applicable to the race aboriginal in the surrounding country.
About Wide Bay, the mother's affection for her infant appears to
have; had no place among their instincts: and at Darling Downs
again I have known a young mother&mdash;at Rosalie
Plains&mdash;deliberately sling her infant's head against a
stump, because it cried and annoyed her; but tenderly suckled a
young pup which had no nurse! Again, in the tribes about Moreton
Bay,&mdash;that at Amity Point&mdash;the "Malurbine", and
"Moppys", maternal and paternal affection were indubitable and
prevailed, I think; but was not so easily observable among the
natives of the Duke of York's, the Ningy-Ningy and the Pine river
districts. Stealing gins was the usual cause of quarrel in all
their domestic life. They were very often fatal: and in the heat
of such embroilments, the wretched gin rarely escaped death. If
she lose her husband, she dare not choose another: either the
tribe or her relations choose for her: any reluctance on her
part,&mdash;especially if she be suspected of a penchant
elsewhere&mdash;is sure to be settled by the waddie. Blows are
their lot from birth to the burning! for in those days they were
undoubtedly eaten. In one point their nature never differs. They
are marvellously observant of every object in nature, more
particularly those connected with their own peculiar
hunting-grounds; upon which they rarely find others encroaching
except on some sensational occasion. I never found them hesitate
in attaching a distinguishing name to every tree, shrub, grass,
flower, bird, beast, or even insect: but yet each tribe, as far
as I know, has its own dialect,&mdash;if not language&mdash;which
stamps their locality much, I suppose, in the way that the
provincialisms of our own counties in England do.</p>
<p>Again, they know every acre of ground belonging to their
"house" by its own special name: every mile of a river or
water-course bears its own appellation, from the highest source
to the mouth, the mouth or junction itself always having a
separate name of its own. I found this universal&mdash;as far as
I had been amongst them&mdash;beginning at Cecil Plains, when I
found that the spot on which I had built my first hut was called
"Boyeer": and pacing but a few hundred yards away up and down the
Condamine was treading ground under another designation; and so,
mile by mile, I found that there was no word given for the space
we would walk over, approaching in similarity by sound or length
to what had been before pronounced. I know of no method they had
of signifying distances but by the sun&mdash;journey by time.</p>
<p>Such are the alignments of the streets and highways made by
the Australian aboriginal of the north. They can direct each
other almost to within a hundred yards of an intended rendezvous.
They have favourite haunts, whether through the fashion of the
day&mdash;<i>cést à dire</i>, our Rotten Row in London, or marine
esplanades, when the "season" was over&mdash;or whether through
the craving for some particular food, <i>par example</i>, our
best-liked restaurants, chop houses, or fish dinners, I cannot
tell; but I do know their dislike to camping near or frequenting
places where a man has died a natural death and been buried,
sometimes under ground, sometimes in a hollow tree.</p>

<p class="quote" align="center">God made the country, and man
made the town.&mdash;<i>Cowper</i>.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">A few</span> days' rest in Brisbane&mdash;for
I had none in Sydney, had looked at no newspaper, written no
letters when last there, and had felt at one time too ill to care
for news&mdash;gave me a chance of recouping the time of my
inattention since my brother's arrival. The <i>Sydney Gazette</i>
was still the accredited purveyor of information as to outside
goings on, and this was attainable even in 1842. (Many an excised
relic is now before me, 1887.) Almost the first thing that met my
eye was of the date of June 19th, 1841, two days after I had left
Sydney with my brother, last year! The name at the foot of the
following announcement struck me, since it had become so familiar
to these parts. I copy it for the name's sake, and here it
is:</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="u">Penrith Races</span>.&mdash;At a
meeting held at the Rose Inn, Penrith, on Tuesday, 15th instant,
for the purpose of establishing annual races at Penrith, it was
unanimously resolved:<br>
<br>
"That an association be formed, to be called 'The Penrith Racing
Club.<br>
<br>
"That a general meeting of members and those favourable to the
Club be held at the Rose Inn, Penrith, on Tuesday, the 29th June,
at one o'clock.<br>
<br>
"That Messrs. Hadley, Perry Dawes, Templar, and Leslie be
appointed to receive subscriptions.&mdash;<span class="u">Patrick
Leslie</span>, Acting Secretary."</blockquote>
<p>Well, after finding Darling Downs two years ago, I could not
have settled down so restfully.</p>
<p>Then, I see, that the two blacks who had murdered poor
Stapylton, at Moreton Bay, were hung on the 2nd of July, 1841, at
Brisbane, near my old quarters, the gaol.</p>
<p>Let me try back. I was on the road at the end of the previous
year. What became of those bushrangers, the Jew-boy and his gang?
Day took them all, but what became of them? That was a plucky
thing to do; Denny Day was indeed a good old soldier; now Police
Magistrate at Maitland I hear! (Writing in this year of 1887 I do
wonder what became of that gallant old fellow. I remember that
time, and was not far from Scone when Graham was murdered at
Dangar's store; also, that there was a J.P. near at hand, who
refused to grant a warrant for the apprehension of the murderers.
That J.P.'s name was Robertson; what Robertson could it have
been? Well, the country has paid little attention to the claim of
so trusty, brave, and resolute a servant as Denny Day. I suppose
he had no friend at Court; he was too true a man to be a
"tuft-hunter" in his advancing years. I passed through Doughboy
Hollow but three days after his engagement with the captain of
the outlawed gang, and was spared the quickened pulse and anxious
vigilance which had inflicted many a dig of the spur in past
months upon the wayfarer's jaded hack, as he passed the dreaded
den of thieves. For such personal relief I yet am glad, forty-six
years afterwards to offer my own tribute to his honest name,
brave nature and memory.)</p>
<p>Ah! <i>me Herclé!</i> here comes something to recall that
pleasing evening at Campbelltown last February. I must reproduce
this newspaper cutting: the gist thereof has a certain bearing
upon my present conclusions:&mdash;</p>
<div style="text-align:center; font-size:90%;"><span class=
"u">"Arrival of Sir Thomas Mitchell</span>."</div>
<br>
<blockquote>"(The concluding paragraph of a leader in to-day's
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> of Saturday, February 6, 1841.)<br>
<br>
"If any man deserve well of his country, it is he who explores
and discovers unknown tracts of country. To men such as these,
statues might be indeed erected during their life-time."<br>
<br>
February 20th.<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="u">"Dinner to Sir
Thomas Mitchell</span>."</div>
<br>
"On Saturday evening last a number of highly respectable
gentlemen met in Petty's Hotel at a dinner given to Sir Thomas,
as a slight mark of the high esteem he was held in by them.<br>
<br>
"In a late number we suggested the propriety of giving Sir Thomas
Mitchell a public mark of that grateful feeling which all true
Australians must feel towards the man who first opened the way to
an extensive and important field of enterprise. We are still of
that opinion, and we now call upon our brethren of the press, who
feel as we do, to use their influence to accomplish this object;
it is a matter apart from politics, for the benefits that have
resulted from Sir Thomas's exertions in exploring the hidden
recesses of this vast territory have fallen alike to all: the
rich and the poor have all been partakers, and surely there is
not one amongst us that would not unite in offering their tribute
of respect to one so worthy and deserving. Some base minds may
say, 'what Sir Thomas did he was bound to do, and he was paid for
so doing;' with these we have nothing in common. Up then, men of
Australia, up and be stirring! Among those present were the
Honourable E. Deas Thomson, Mr. Attorney-General Plunket, Captain
Perry, Deputy Surveyor-General, W. Lithgow, Esq., Auditor
General, Alexander McLeay, Esq., late Colonial Secretary, Major
Innes, Port Macquarie. Mr. Manning, senr., and Mr. Williams,
American Consul. The chair was filled by James Bowen, Esq., and
amongst the several speakers on this occasion were Dr. Nicholson,
Dr. Wallace, Mr. Williams, Mr. Charles Campbell, Captain Perry
and Mr. McLeay. During a short speech Sir Thomas made, in
allusion to the toast of Dr. Nicholson in proposing 'the officers
of the Survey Department,' he alluded feelingly to the melancholy
death of his former friend and associate, the late lamented Mr.
Stapylton, who was lately cruelly butchered by the northern
blacks.'</blockquote>
<p>I wish I could have seen Patrick Leslie's name amongst those
present at that dinner.</p>
<p>The murder of poor Stapylton, whose remains were buried near
at hand on the banks of this river Brisbane, still occupied the
thoughts of many in Sydney and this place. The report of the
trial of two of his murderers, whose execution I have just
mentioned, which I met with and also copied may be yet
interesting. I give the summary.</p>
<p>Two aboriginals, Merridio and Neugavil, of Moreton Bav, were
indicted before Mr. Justice Burton and a common jury on the 14th
of May, 1841, for the wilful murder of William Tuck, at Mount
Lindesay, on the 31st of the preceding May. Merridio's name was
properly Mullan. The prisoners were charged with having murdered
one Tuck, but in detailing the circumstances connected therewith
it was impossible to keep out of sight the fact that another
murder had been committed by the blacks at the same time.
Stapylton, assistant-surveyor, had also been killed. On the
morning of the day laid in the indictment Stapylton sent a party
to make a bridge over a creek about a mile from the encampment,
himself. Tuck, and Dunlop remaining at the camp. On the return of
the working party they found Stapylton dead as well as Tuck, and
supposed Dunlop was dying from wounds inflicted by the blacks,
who had all fled, carrying off every article they could lay their
hands on. The party hastened to Brisbane and reported to the
commandant, who at once proceeded to the scene, and rescued
Dunlop, who, having crawled away, was discovered by a constable.
Me recovered. Stapylton's body was too much mutilated for
recognition. His head had been cut off, and the flesh eaten.
Identification being so difficult, these prisoners were charged
with the murder of Tuck. The evidence was complete, and the
verdict "guilty." His Honor then passed sentence of death on the
prisoners in the usual form, which, when Baker (" Gorman's Baker,
in search of Etonvale!") an interpreter, communicated to them,
they broke out by telling him in a most indifferent way, "What of
that&mdash;let them hang us!"</p>
<p>The "Piscator" schooner brought them back to Brisbane, and
they were extinguished, as I have said.</p>
<p>And here I find a memorandum: "Leslie's discovery of Darling
Downs was noticed in the <i>Sydney Herald</i> of 1st May, 1840,
under heading, 'Important Discovery!' "After it, he did not reach
Sydney until the 28th of July, however. Another memorandum that
transportation had ceased to New South Wales on the 1st of
August, 1840! And here is Letsome and Boyd's case, at length
brought to a conclusion in the Supreme Court on the 16th of
February, 1841. Nominal sentence on Archibald Boyd. I was present
at the outbreak, at the beginning of 1840, at Maitland: cannot
wonder that Boyd lost his temper. The Major grossly
insulting.</p>
<p>Ah! here is another river, discovered last December&mdash;the
"Albert", into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Stanley, I suppose, in
the "Britomart".</p>
<p>How amusing to read a letter like the following, written when
Moreton Bay was still a close settlement, and before there was
any assurance of approach thereunto from the west. It appeared on
April 9, 1840:&mdash;"We have been kindly favoured with the
perusal of a letter from Moreton Bay by the last mail from that
settlement. It states that the grass is so abundant on the fine
plains(!) that it would be no difficult thing for the
settlers(!!) there to supply the whole of Sydney with good hay at
reasonable terms, that is to say, if persons could be found to
cut it
down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hay is equal to the meadow hay in
England.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They have no hot winds this summer. During the season they have
had, instead of hot winds, cool, refreshing breezes, much more
exhilarating than those experienced to the southward. New
settlements springing up in all directions
(!!!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The surveyors congratulate themselves on having opened out a
portion of the finest country yet known in New Holland, and it is
acknowledged by one of them to be superior in every respect to
Port Phillip and Australia Felix. The opening in the Dividing
Range called Cunningham's gap has been surveyed and found of easy
ascent with the pack bullocks, and a gang of twelve men could in
a fortnight make it passable for drays. This is the opening to
the extensive unknown country to the north-west, and likewise to
the settled country round New England, and an easy communication
from thence to Maitland." <i>Couleur de rose</i> indeed!</p>
<p>Here comes an official report of the progress the "north
countrie" from Governor Gipps himself. What says he to Home
Secretary. I think he advised Lord John Russell to increase the
"squatters'" license from £10 to £60 per annum. "Among the papers
which have been laid down upon the table of the House of Commons
was a despatch from Sir George Gipps." "The Governor in his
despatch," so said the <i>Gazette</i>, "mentions a
long-established regulation that no land could be sold beyond the
limits of certain tracts of country indicated by their division
into counties. The boundaries of county lands have come,
therefore, to be called the boundaries of location. Within these
limits land is either sold or let on lease; beyond them
proprietors of stock are to be found in the occupation of
stations depasturing their stock, the license to occupy which,
though the stations vary in extent from 5,000 to 30,000 acres,
costs but £10 annually, the stock being assessed under a local
ordinance at a small amount per head. One of the best paying
districts at present open in the colony is to be found on the
tableland called New England, on the summit of a ridge of
mountains extending parallel to the sea coast between the
latitudes of 26 deg. and 32 deg. Here are to be found sixty-six
stations. Towards the north, stations already extend to the
country behind Moreton Bay, three hundred miles beyond the limits
of location. From the pastoral districts to the north of Sydney,
and behind Port Macquarie, the Clarence river, and Moreton Bay,
or between the 32nd and 25th degrees of south latitude, routes
are being opened to the sea."</p>
<p>Moreton Bay did not lack "puffing", in expectancy of land
sales to be ere long. Here was one which the <i>Gazette</i> gave
out at this time (December, 1841) in the interests of the
Government:&mdash;"A settlement on the east coast of Australia,
situated in latitude south 27 deg. 30 min., and longitude 153
deg. 10 min., has been a penal settlement for about twenty years.
All the penal prisoners have lately been sent away, and Mr. Dixon
and party have been upwards of two years carrying on a survey,
preparatory to its being thrown open for location. The climate is
fine and healthy, the soil of the richest description, clothed
with abundance of grass, and well watered, having the fine rivers
Brisbane and Logan, navigable for steamers a considerable
distance from the coast, on the banks of which coal, lime, and
iron can be obtained. The facilities offered by this beautiful
part of the colony have induced an immense number of large
stockholders to take up squatting licences both on the east and
west sides of the great Dividing Range, and it is supposed that
upwards of 1,000 bales of wool will be shipped at Brisbane Town
after the present shearing is over. Brisbane Town, the present
settlement, is situated about sixteen miles up the river
Brisbane, pleasantly on rising ground, and consisting of several
good and substantial buildings. The present population,
consisting of the civil officers, troops, and convicts, amounts
to about two hundred and eighty souls; the Government stock
consisting of about 1,000 head of cattle and 12,000 sheep. Little
doubt remains but that this will soon, when open, become a fine
flourishing settlement. A map of this part of the colony, by Mr.
Dixon, is now in the publisher's hands."</p>
<p>Coming to the end of my batch of <i>Gazette</i> memoranda, I
find that last February, on the 12th, were issued three notices,
two of which much affect us here at Brisbane. They are authorised
by despatches recently received from England: one is a
proclamation notifying that the penal days of Moreton Bay are at
an end; it is now thrown open as Port Macquarie was not so long
since: the other is to inform the people that Moreton Bay is to
be opened for settlement, and that the first sale will be that of
allotments of land in Brisbane, at the Colonial Treasury, <i>by
auction in Sydney</i>, next July. And the third declares that
"sale by auction" is to be reverted to in all parts of the
colony, at a minimum price which can never be less than twelve
shillings an acre. And so we are going ahead indeed in 1842. This
month an agitation seems to be getting up for representative
government. Hitherto we've done fairly well, I think. And over
that wretched road from New England to Port Macquarie, at length,
they have got their first wool. On the 16th March, my own
birthday&mdash;good omen I hope!&mdash;here's a "leader" about
Sir George Gipps' proposed trip to Moreton Bay; here, our
departure in March; arrival; His Excellency's doings; Watson
Parker's collar-bone; and their return to Sydney at the beginning
of April.</p>
<p>We have plenty of "trumpeters" it seems! Who could have been
our mutual friend that writes thus from Moreton Bay? "I do not
know how to describe the beauty of this place. The settlement is
situated about twenty-five miles from the extremity of the Bay,
and fifty from the sea, occupying a delightful position on the
north side of a beautiful river, much larger than the Hunter at
its junction with the Williams. It is my opinion, as well as the
opinion of many others, that here will be the most flourishing
town in New South Wales. Small shipping can come a distance of a
hundred miles; you would be surprised to see the traffic here
already" (Dec. 1841), "bound up as the place is from its being a
penal settlement. In coming over from the Downs we met and passed
seventeen drays, about twenty-two thousand sheep, one hundred
men, and one hundred and thirty bullocks. In fact, all the
flock-masters seem flocking here as fast as they can, people are
just behind us with sixteen thousand sheep and other stock, and
when there are so many coming, there must be some traffic at the
Bay. The country is the finest I have ever seen, either for grass
or cultivation. Some shepherds have been murdered in the
employment of Mr. Mackenzie, of Kilcoy, by the blacks," who have
become very troublesome, being led on and instigated by runaway
convicts," is an extract dated March 19th, 1842. This, then, was
the cause of our disquietude when we fell in with Derhamboi.</p>
<p>The tone of the "press" is marvellously changed since 1842
concerning the labour question! I must re-copy one of my
memoranda, so long lost, until now. From a leading article I read
"to make Moreton Bay one of the most valuable adjuncts of this
colony, nothing is wanting but a large and regular supply of
Indian and Chinese labourers! Men who thoroughly understand the
culture of tropical plants and fruit trees, and to whose
constitution the climate is well suited. Should this supply be
afforded us, we should not find men of capital and experience
diffident in availing themselves of the advantages offered by
this district."</p>
<p>I have exhausted my batch of records, which deal with matters
outside my immediate camp, and betake myself to my own track
again, in search of a run.</p>
<p>I had by this time heard that Glover and the sheep had arrived
on the Downs on the 31st of last month&mdash;May, 1842. I must be
off to him. Among my adieux to my late associates was a pair of
boots to Bracefell and Davis, who, I thought, would be proud to
complete the new dress to which they had been so long
unaccustomed. After much ado they got them on at the little store
near the water-side at the ferry steps&mdash;Moutry's, I think.
"Good-bye to you now." said I. They both made a step forward at
the words, and both fell flat on their noses! I was told
afterwards that they, for a long while, carried their boots about
in their <i>hands</i>. They couldn't <em>walk</em> in them!</p>
<p>The interval between my departure from Brisbane in this June,
after my return from Wide Bay, and my start again into the bush
after a sheep-run, was not altogether one of my happy
recollections. Glover and the sheep had made an admirable journey
across country from Bathurst, some six hundred miles, had
suffered no losses, and were, for the time at least, on Cecil
Plains awaiting my future hoped-for success. Somerville,
superintendent for Richard Jones, of Sydney, had followed my
brother's tracks on the 7th November, 1841, and had marked off
for himself the lower part of our run of "Cecil Plains" ("jumped"
is the phrase used now by gold-gourmands), which extended down
the Condamine, from Gore's marked tree to the junction of the
Jondaryan, "Oaky creek", and had sent up stock to take
possession. Consequently, until the matter was settled by
Commissioner Macdonald's intervention, we were, with sheep and
cattle, sorely cramped for room. In a short while, having to take
delivery of the sheep some time since bought from Hodgson in
Sydney, he with great kindness allowed Glover and his brother
room on the lower part of Etonvale creek for the sheep until our
run was found. They moved, in consequence, to the lower part of
Hodgson and Elliot's station, about three miles below the
Drummer's. We all had been hitherto in ignorance that a neighbour
some miles to the southward, a sheep-owner, had scab amongst his
flocks. Some of this same neighbour's careless shepherds lost
some hundreds one night, and they strayed to and mixed with ours,
which had come so long a distance scathless! I need not dwell on
the miserable discovery and its results. A line old
fellow&mdash;a German of the name of Fred Bracker, in charge of
stock belonging to the Australian Company on a run near
Toolburra, called "Rosenthal", sent us a man who called himself
"Jemmy Carter", whom we, new chums as we were, received with
gladness as an eminent member of the scab-curing faculty. Between
the mercurial abominations with which the place soon stank, the
sickness of men who rubbed the "fell" ointment in, the putrid
carcases of the wretched animals, which died by scores from the
effect of this "smearing" (common process, however, in the
eastern counties of England), and from extreme thirst, for they
were allowed no water for some days: the extortionate wages, and
terrifying expense, our "squatting" hopes began to sink so low
that the Downs lost most of its former beauty in our eyes.
Hodgson himself was naturally alarmed, and hoped we should soon
remove our hospital. And so, as soon as what was absolutely
required at Cecil Plains had been completed, I started off to
find a permanent resting place and home for what remained to us
of the unhappy sheep. However, that remainder was cured at
length.</p>
<p>Thus, in the interval of waiting for a fixed abiding place for
our sheep&mdash;search and success&mdash;it happened that Hodgson
and Elliot had in sympathetic kindness helped us. The spot at
which Glover and my brother pitched their tent was at a stony
point.</p>
<p>At the tent door one hot day we sat sorrowful&mdash;but
smoking. From this tent we used to practise with rifle and pistol
at a mark. The lovely plain up the creek, down the creek, and
rising gently towards a belt of timber some two miles distant in
front of us, set us conjecturing as to the possibility of finding
such another paradise for ourselves, ere long; as to the
probability of getting shepherds and bullock-drivers willing to
go with us, so dire was the dearth of working hands. Some of ours
had quite lately left. They had been with us more than two years,
and wished to see Limestone and Brisbane&mdash;the ready
recipients of accumulated wages. "Who comes here, Dick?"
(Glover's name was William Henry: I can't explain "Dick": he was
always familiarly so called). "Who comes here, down the creek; on
foot too! From Hodgson no doubt!" Walking through tall grass
under a burning sun, over fourteen miles ol "melon-hole" plain,
was no pleasurable exercise. "Who can it be?" repeated Dick
Glover.</p>
<p>On nearer approach we recognised "Peter Quack", a man who had
been with us from the beginning. He had been a sailor, had never
told us his real name, had changed it to Quack, was truly
Peter.</p>
<p>"Why, Peter!" cried Dick, "what brings you back?" He had left
us but two days before, intent upon indulging his bent in
revisiting a township once more, and most regretfully&mdash;he
was such a handy, grumpy, but at bottom ready and willing an old
fellow&mdash;he had been "settled with."</p>
<p>Peter looked puzzled: took off his old cabbage tree; swabbed
his bald head, and gave a kind of snort, at the question: he was
very taciturn at all times. "Well! Peter, have a pot of tea,
there's salt mutton and damper: haven't a glass of grog for you,
wish we had after such a hot tramp; but what has brought you
back? Any bad news?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir,"&mdash;after a long pull at a water can, and as
long a silence until he had filled his pipe and taken his first
pull at that&mdash;"well, sir I no bad news for you, may be for
me: that's as may be, too, with them as takes it in a different
light from what I do!" and Quack again scratched his smooth pate.
"Out with it, Peter", cried Glover&mdash;and we were equally
puzzled. "Out with it, man! what's wrong? We'll try to set it
right": we liked Peter Quack.</p>
<p>"Thank'ee, gen'lmen," croaked he; "the long and short of it is
this. As I was a lying on my back near the head station&mdash;Mr.
Huggerson had just gone: come to see what I was about, camping
thereabouts&mdash;lying on my back smoking my pipe, I thought I
would take a squint at my account which you gave me when you
settled my wages."</p>
<p>Under a natural misapprehension we looked at each other
dolefully, and meaningly. Quack's keen eye detected our
glance.</p>
<p>"No, gen'lemen, I knowed it wur all right, but the fire by my
side was blazing up you see, and put it into my head: so I got it
out and looked it up and down, and didn't think ther'd a-been so
much a-coming to me as you made out: I began to think over all I
had from the store since we got here to Darling Downs. I used to
say it all over by nights, you see, 'cause I can't write, and
only read a bit: and so I used to make it ship-shape that way
<i>here</i>," touching his forehead; "and so I just put the bit
paper down and ran it over and up as I used when a-shepherding of
the sheep. Well I what d'ye think? I found you had never entered
my last pair of boots in your log-book&mdash;fourteen
shillings&mdash;which I had three months agone. I'm right,
gen'lemen; more by token, these 'ere dratted stones soon made
'boots' of them! There's fourteen shillings more to come out
o'this 'ere money which you guv me. Thinking on't made me yaw
about so much after the start I'd made, between my want to go
over the range and wanting to make it all square with you, that I
said this morning when the sun got up: 'Peter Quack,' says I,
''twon't make much of a difference: only two days to make all
right and above board with them gen'lemen. 'So, Peter Quack,'
says I, 'trip it back again in your own wake, and when you get
ashore you'll not be heavy in the heels from this being on your
mind.' So, you see, here I am! here's your money! I'm not a
hungry loafer, nor a 'long-shore sneak!"</p>
<p>How true, O! Shakespeare, is thy word to the world: "An honest
man is able to speak for himself when a knave is not."</p>
<p>And this man had not "come out" of his own accord to New South
Wales. Our grave and wondering silence was the only tribute we
were able at first to pay to the essential principle, the one
(who can say but one?) illumining, unquenched and unquenchable
spark in the man's nature, of that light which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.</p>
<p>On the day following he would not go away again: re-engaged
himself: and when Burrandowan passed out of the hands of my
brother and Glover, Peter came to Cecil Plains, and stayed with
me until I left the bush.</p>
<p>The first white man killed on Darling Downs was the very
"John" who rode up with Pemberton Hodgson and myself at the end
of 1840. Shortly after the head-station had been removed to the
present site of Etonvale, poor John, who had ridden out to see to
the cattle, came back at a mad gallop with a spear sticking out
of his back. He never rallied: was buried close by the creek's
bank.</p>
<p>I cannot deny myself the pleasure of here inserting an extract
from a letter which bears me back to the days when I frequently
met and can well recall its writer&mdash;Christopher
Gorry&mdash;at this time of 1887 residing in Ipswich:</p>
<blockquote>"I suppose you remember the three"&mdash;(an error
for two)&mdash;"fine young men who were killed by the blacks on
their way to your station in the middle of Coxen's Big Plain. I
suppose you have some recollection of the grand shot that 'Cocky
Rogers' made from a point of the main range to the top of the
one-tree hill on the old road, (from which the distance was more
than a mile and a-half). The blacks were dancing and bellowing
their war-song at the time, and this big blackfellow was more
prominent than the rest. 'Cocky' took true aim at his head with
his rifle, and struck the black somewhere in the body, which made
him rebound six feet high, and all the tribe then commenced to
roll the stones of the hill down the incline, fancying they could
kill all the whites on the flat. I cannot tell the date, but it
was a month or so after the killing of those men going to your
station, poor John Hill and myself were attacked near Mount
Rascal. John started early one morning for the camp, in order to
lake home some bullocks. He told me to come after him in about
half-an-hour, and to my surprise I met poor John Hill with a
spear right between his shoulders, with his horse galloping home,
and John sticking to the saddle with the spear dangling against
the horse's rump, till he arrived at the slip-panel near the
house (Etonvale: Hodgson and Elliot's), with myself close after
him. Mr. Elliot came to his relief with myself and others, and
lifted poor John off the horse, and had to cut vest and shirt on
each side of the spear wound, ere we could take it from the wound
in his body fully four and a-half inches. He lived in great pain.
I was sent for Dr. Rolland at his Broadwater station, who
attended on him for a week, but held out no hope of his recovery.
He lingered on for eighteen days and died.<br>
<br>
"Myself and another station hand attended to his requirements up
to his death. In those days there was no coffin to hand, so we
made a shroud of his blanket, and buried his body in a sheet of
bark in a little flat near the garden on the bank of the creek.
Mr. Elliot read the usual burial service, and thus finished the
life of John Hill, of Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire,
England."</blockquote>
<p>The blacks had been more aggressive of late than ever. They
were harrying and killing cattle wherever cattle were. The
shepherds were in a terrible state of "funk", and no wonder. My
brother had caught them, when crossing the plain between Yandilla
and Tummavil in company with Ralph Gore and Taylor, coolly
rounding a mob up in the open, and preparing to kill. A "set-to"
was the consequence. The blacks numbered about three hundred, and
kept admirable order and showed unusual courage. Upon the firing
of a shot, the "ducking" of heads and rush on their assailants
were instantaneous, well arranged, and executed. Syd.'s horse was
fidgetty; so he jumped off and let him loose. The "brummagem"
double-barrelled gun which he had&mdash;mine, however&mdash;burst
in his hands without doing damage; and it must have been quite
half-an-hour before the mob, which showed a steady line
throughout, had retreated, step by step, to the timber which
skirted the western edge of the plain, and only then turned tail.
A large flock of our sheep had been allowed, by our sociable
neighbour, Charles Coxen, to remain on his run within a couple of
miles of his head station, Jondaryan, for awhile. One night his
nephew, Henry Coxen, rode to Cecil Plains, and entered our hut
with grave face. "Your sheep are all gone; both men are killed by
the blacks!" was the cheerful message he brought. Coxen believed
in conciliating the blacks by admitting them at all times to his
head quarters, and supplying them with all in his power to give.
We did not agree on this point. "Keep them at a distance," said
we, "and they will not harm you." "No! I let them in, and give
them blankets, &amp;c. Depend on it, they understand kind
treatment." "As soon as they feel at home they will take an
opportunity, when off your guard, to kill, steal, &amp;c."</p>
<p>And here was the test of this experiment. Two harmless men
(the name of one was Cooper), late arrivals from England, were
murdered in an atrocious manner. The bodies, which we found next
day, were horribly mutilated; and yet for weeks they had all been
on most friendly terms: the men had evidently gone to the creek
unarmed: the blacks, seeing their chance, had intercepted their
return, and murdered them with the reaping hooks found in the
hut.</p>
<p>In two days we had tracked down and recovered the flock, minus
those killed and eaten. In fact the natives had determined to
rise against us on all sides. The roads were dangerous. A new one
had been made and cleared through dense scrub by a combination of
drays&mdash;Hodgson and Elliot's and Gore's, I can
remember&mdash;over the range, which left Hell's Hole in
obscurity. It ran by the heads of Westbrook water-course, by the
Springs (Drayton), through the "Swamps" (Toowoomba) to the front,
and from that by a less irritating "spur" than usual to the
bottom of the range, where the scrub-cutting commenced and the
blacks beset the wayfarers in safety. In this scrub were to be
seen, at night, myriads of fire-flies, and the nerves of the men,
camped the first night with these drays, were much shaken. "The
blacks are on us!" was a sudden shout in the van. "Look at their
fire-sticks!" Poor insects! Many must have been annihilated by
the fusillade so provoked by their beauteous coruscations.</p>
<p>The times on and around Moreton Bay and Darling Downs were
troublous, and claimed attention at our present home&mdash;Cecil
Plains&mdash;nevertheless, I must get abroad, I decided, and at
least try for a sheep-run.</p>
<p>Before making the trial a saddening rumour had floated to the
Downs. Francis Bigge had been murdered! A very precise account of
the manner appeared in the newspapers of the preceding August. It
was now November, 1842: "We learn that between two places, named
Muswellbrook and Aberdeen, a highly esteemed and much to be
regretted gentleman, Mr. Bigge, on his return to the new country,
Moreton Bay, was attacked while superintending the removal of his
horses and cattle to that district by four desperadoes, known as
bushrangers here, who, <i>sans cérémonie</i>, commanded him to
dismount the horse he rode. Indisposed to comply, he instantly
used his firearms and winged one of the miscreants, when he was
instantly fired at by two of the lot, and fell almost momentarily
dead!" Again: "We cannot but condole the fate of poor Mr. Bigge,
and hope it is the last calamity of the kind we may hear of
occurring in seeking out this newly-opened country and land of
promise, Moreton Bay. Added to this, the unfortunate Mr. Bigge
had one of his men shot also the week before. The magistrates,
with ten mounted policemen, proceeded instantly, in hope of
capturing the vagabonds; the result is, however, not yet
known."</p>
<p>With one man, whose name I shall not tell in this year, 1887,
my much esteemed friend Francis Bigge was driving up horses to
Mount Brisbane. A few miles before reaching the Peel he was
waylaid by the "Jew-boy" and his gang. Ordered to dismount, he
did so; ordered to strip, he would not do so. He made a dash with
a small pocket pistol at the nearest man who was covering him
from behind a tree, raised it, and was at once shot through the
shoulder. He still advanced upon them (his companion had put
spurs into his horse and galloped off to the Peel, where he
reported Bigge dead!) and the whole gang ran from him, at times
turning to fire. Faint, he returned to his horse and rode on,
with the others before him, to the Peel, where he was supposed to
be past help; got his wound dressed; with the police followed the
scoundrels, and took them. Having to give evidence in Sydney, he
saw them hung afterwards. The leader of the gang, after sentence,
swearing that "Mr. Bigge was the pluckiest man in the universe,
and he didn't care to swing for such a one as he!"</p>
<p>If I am wrong, Francis Bigge can set me right. I saw him well,
hearty, and strong in 1877. He is still living, I believe and
hope, in Warwickshire, England.</p>
<p>On the 24th of the November of 1842, having with me the
William Orton whom I had met on the Severn in 1840, and who was
now my stockman&mdash;the very prince of stockmen, too&mdash;and
the black boy Jemmy, whom he had brought from the Severn, I
started from Cecil Plains. Our great care in preparation, under
existing circumstances, was the quality of our arms: and I think
with these by our sides we were quite comfortable. Jemmy had a
carbine of mine, which he could use well. My purpose was to
follow the track which Jolliffe and Last had left by their drays
and sheep to the Wide Bay country. Davis had piloted them through
the Bunnia, since we parted at Brisbane, and they had established
themselves, I believed, on the Monoboola.</p>
<p>We crossed the range by the Springs road, on by Grantham,
turned to the left from the Brisbane road at Bigge's Camp, and in
course of time reached Kilcoy, Evan and Colin Mackenzie's
station. Here I met Bidwell, and Dorsey, of Limestone, a medical
practitioner. Having smashed my own, Dorsey gave me a compass,
which proved to us a very opportune gift soon after, during the
rainy weather we met with. Bidwell, I have said, accompanied us
to the first Bunnia tree, stopped under it an hour, and then
returned. We continued through broken densely brushed, dismal and
uninviting country, all the way to where we found Eales' sheep.
Jolliffe had been back to Brisbane, returned thence to their
whereabouts in a boat, and had gone back again by the same way.
[He was driven out to sea, out of sight of land; had to eat a dog
which was with him for food, and reached Brisbane in a pitiable
state.]</p>
<p>Eales' sheep were in a terrible mess; the country was most
unsuitable; the out-stations far away; the blacks inveterate; two
shepherds had already lost their lives, and but for their
isolation, I don't think a man would have remained with the
stock, or stood by the station. A rough wool-shed had been
erected. In it during the shearing&mdash;just over&mdash;a
strange visitor in the shape of a wild bullock created great
disturbance and dismay. Whilst busily engaged, the brute rushed
into the midst, horning the sheep. The men climbed to the
tie-beams, and the infuriated animal was determined to take
possession. One of the men managed to reach a musket, and he was
shot from the roof. Sleek, glossy, coal-black and unbranded, yet
a bullock, he may have been wrecked as a calf on the coast and
roamed alone over his realm of Wide Bay. Davis and Bracefell had
both spoken in the boat about two beasts&mdash;bullocks, or
bulls, doubtless&mdash;in this district, which had been a terror
to the natives, who would shake with fright at the sound of their
bellow, and climb to the highest trees to get a sight of the "big
dogs with trees in their heads." This was, I suppose, one of
them. Last described the animal as being sleek as a greyhound.
When cut up, found to be immensely fat through his whole carcase,
and yet had not the appearance of the well-fed "pride of the
market." By his horn he must have been over six years old. On our
wanderings, on this trip, we fell in with the fresh tracks of a
large beast on a stream to the westward (the Boyne) and followed
it some days, but never overtook the beef we longed for.</p>
<p>Leaving Last, who was sorry to be alone again, one of his
overseers and another man accompanied us, by his own wish, to
have a look at the country, as to its suitability along the route
we were going to take, for a station for himself. Our course was
to the north of west&mdash;say W.N.W. The prospect we had from
the first became more and more formidable; so much so, that our
two companions returned the next day. The gloom of the country we
passed, or rather in part climbed over, exceeded all expectation.
Pine brush from above, below, and all around in that dark horror
which it always seemed to assume in wholly unknown spots, frowned
at us and stood in the way of our advance. The night of that day
was the most unpleasant I ever remember having passed in the
bush. A fearful storm threatened towards sunset; the heat had
been distressing; the shrill challenge of the myriad locusts
which had shrieked all day through our bewildered brains had
suddenly become hushed. A moan as of distant wand or thunder
portended something at hand, the approach of which, basinned as
we were among high broken ridges, patchy-scrubbed heights, and
penned in by a maze of steep-sided gullies or gorges&mdash;we had
no chance of observing, until it came down in hurricane strength.
'Twas of no use to seek a place in any way clear, that we might
escape the danger from the torn and strained trees around. There
was no level spot on which a horse might rest and feed; and, but
the thunderous rain over and on us, there was no water for our
thirst's relieving. Thunder, lightning, wind and rain such as
never yet conspired to appal and unnerve us in our work. And this
was Christmas Eve!</p>
<p>The howling and the roaring were too continuous for speech or
hearing, and so we sat and, I suppose, made up by thinking; a
season well worth thinking about; but in the maelstrom of such a
night where was peace? No fire, no bed: not even a pipe: so
terrible that downpour and blast. To keep our powder dry we
wrapped it in our one blanket each: to keep our horses we had to
hold them all night: not a word, barely a move, as we sat side by
side on a fallen tree until the dawn, which brought in sudden
quiet, and the sun of Christmas Day, 1842, set fire to the tops
of the pine-brushed heights around and above us, of which the
very sight made us the more chill.</p>
<p>It had been a terribly dismal epitome of existence! for me at
least&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">"Remembrance waked with all her busy train<br>
Swelled at my breast, and turned the past to pain."</p>
<p>(I could not tell my neighbour's thoughts) that of dwelling
through the darkness on the home-lit days of past Christmas
pleasantness, while we three were so compressed in silent
helplessness by the forces in strife, from which destruction
seemed inevitable. Strange, that phantasmagoria of good dinners;
wine-cheered fire-sides and Yule logs; gay ball-rooms; and even
the earlier joys of Harrow cricket-ground pavilion feasts which
would insist upon keeping company with the realities of our
surrounding <i>désagrémens</i>! And then the "new chum's"
imaginings of what <i>might</i> have been, if he had not turned
his back on the old country. If&mdash;bah! it seemed so childish:
and yet the burning fancies of those dreary hours did not
evaporate with the heated vapours of the morning. I bear the
brand yet very distinctly. I doubt if imagination be a blessing,
at times. The heavy and monotonous discipline of many a recurring
year has evoked out of the soil of the bushman's heart's-acre not
once or twice only, I know, the Dead-sea apple of vain and
profitless reflections. Imagination, after all, is but the fruit
born of the blossoms of memory, and dropped away from its
premature ripening into rottenness, from the branch stricken by
self-will or disappointment: the fancy of possibilities within
reach no longer: the promised but unredeemed issue of
irrecoverable facts. Yet, ah! me, it is a blessing: it does shape
itself into a Nemesis, whose heavy stock-whip brings a beast to
its "bearings", and teaches the truth, whether from the pages of
pain, or the poetry of life: but leaves the future to its own
shadowy trespass, and stumbling anticipations.</p>
<p>Yet, Memory, thou <i>must</i> be Imagination's
mother!&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">"Thou, like the world, th' opprest
oppressing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy smiles increase the
wretch's woe!<br>
And he who wants each other blessing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thee must ever find
a foe."</p>
<p>Slowly but surely did the light and the heat descend upon and
find us out in our uncomfortable crib. Our soaked wardrobe
required but a scant clothes-line; but the free and easy
enjoyment of the savage costume was not a little counterbalanced
by the savage attacks by fly and mosquito. This morning drill was
at an end when we resumed our dried clothes: a pot of tea, some
sodden damper, and a large iguana, shot by our taciturn Jemmy,
broke our Christmas morn's fast; and then that inestimable black
pipe set us on our way no worse for thunder, lightning, hail nor
rain&mdash;nor the night's blue-devils.</p>
<p>Day by day we steadily stuck to our W.N.W. course. The
closeness and gloom of the scenes we passed through were not
relieved. Under recollection I retain the impression, but can
give no adequate idea of it. An old bushman will best understand
what it was, when I say that our silence one to the other was
almost unbroken through the day's ride, barrin' a few remarks
when we stopped for a "pipe". If I were taken over the same
ground such a feeling, doubtless, would be impossible, unchanged
though it may be in all its ruggedness and difficulty. It was the
sense of being in an unknown region, that every step towards the
north coast of Australia was under a veil, which we were trying
to lift, hoping for&mdash;perhaps dreading at times&mdash;what we
should find behind it, and yet, drawn by the intensity of
awakened inquisitiveness to go on, and on, and on, without one
wish to return; nor the fear of aught, but the lack of
"Niggerhead" and ammunition! How Orton and I used to talk over a
plan o' nights for reaching Port Essington, of which I had heard
so much from Captain Stanley, in Sydney. I had no chart, but I
knew its whereabouts; and he, as well as I, often declared our
determination to try it together, for we had learnt to know each
other by now, and lean on each other's help and readiness. Jemmy,
too&mdash;I rarely heard his voice, poor boy! [long since killed
by his own horse]&mdash;had lost the first fears of the blacks in
a country which he knew not, and his bush-craft, bee-hunting,
"sugar-bag" purveyance were invaluable: to say nothing of his
ever-watchful eye for the vicinity of the "Murrie" wild blacks
and the tracks of kangaroo, on which we mostly fed, or a snake,
iguana, or wallaby, invisible to our tame eyesight. Marvellous to
me, was it, that Jemmy would so often give his wary whistle, and
point out such desirable objects, especially discoveries of the
"plants" which the bees had made, and were yet making, in some
hollow limb high up a tree some fifty yards away from our track.
As to Orton, I can say nothing more, or more meaning, than that
he was a man whose match I do not think I could have found in the
breadth of the land for manly, considerate, and intelligent
bearing, thoughtful unselfishness, steadiness of purpose in
trying to gratify my wish to explore&mdash;especially having in
view the necessity of a suitable sheep-run, coolness and courage
under very discouraging aspects and trying conditions, and an
unerring eye and nerve, of which the rifle, which my brother had
lent him, on more than one occasion sustained the unquestionable
gift and reputation.</p>
<p>After many days and nights&mdash;for at times we were keeping
more to the northward than we had intended&mdash;we began to
break out into a clear country from a most worthless extent of
mountain, brush, stone, and sand. Not many miles after this
pleasant view found ourselves on the brink of a precipice, or a
bank which might have been at first sight, called one: we could
not descend: it was quite clear to the bottom, through which was
flowing a beautiful stream of water. The bank opposite was
higher, and equally precipitous. "There's a great gulf between us
and that, Orton." "Yes; shall we go up or down, d'ye think, sir?"
"I don't care which, but we'll log it down the 'Gulf
Stream.'"</p>
<p>I forget its course; it was about north, I think. So we
followed it down to where the bank declined, crossed, and rode up
the opposite side. Here was promise: from the lay of the country
there was evidently a larger stream which it probably joined
further to the west. And so, travelling in more cheerful hope,
which opened our dumb lips, even our horses jogged on more
willingly, pricking their ears at so unwonted a clearing. With
some perverseness we still kept "northing" much more than we
needed; and did not emerge absolutely from the region which had
so bewildered us for some days; but then our pace was slow, and
our animals leg-weary. "What do you say, sir?" at length said
Orton, "as soon as we reach that lay of water we saw from the
'Gulf Stream', if we take a day's spell; 'twill do us all good,
if we can. I'm sure the horses want it." So it was settled, and
we went away due west: soon came to our "heart's desire", dropped
down on the banks of what we thought must be the Boyne: the
channel very broad-: the water-reaches undeniable: the black
swans innumerable: the scrub-wallaby tracks equally so: the grass
enticing: the gloaming smokeless, <i>ergo</i>, blackless. "Hist!
Orton." Jemmy's low whistle had reached my ears. We looked round;
he was lying on his animal's neck, and pointing earnestly.
Following the direction, we both "spotted" a head, the "old man"
belonging to which had not "spotted" us; he was barely a hundred
yards off. Short of food rather of late, we had taken one or two
holes up in our belts, and I had the great satisfaction of
providing the means, now, of shaking out the reefs again. I shot
him: to our astonishment, he fell, recovered himself, seized a
sapling with his fore-paws, tore it almost up by the roots, and
dropped dead. The largest "old man", a real "old soldier", I had
yet seen. I measured him, but don't recollect the height, which
was a good deal more than my own.</p>
<p>We feasted that night. It was marked by a startling
occurrence.</p>
<p>Our teeth had hardly become unglued from the mastication of
the old man's nutritive tail, of which the gelatinous fibre
would&mdash;I thought when I first tasted it&mdash;make admirable
soup for an alderman if treated by the skill of a <i>chef de
cuisine</i>;&mdash;our lips had scarcely closed upon the stem of
each cherished pipe, when darkness settled in for the night. Very
comfortable were we under the prospect of a whole day's rest
to-morrow, and so we both rolled ourselves up with our rifles
after smothering the brightness of the fire, lest the darkies
might "chance" that way. Jemmy, who had remained squatting by the
fire, seemed satisfied with our security, and laid himself down
likewise. In a moment he started up again with his customary
whistle: and crawled to Orton's side, who had dozed off: quickly
springing up, seizing my rifle, and whispering to the black boy,
"what name?" he with a terrified gesture of the hand, turning his
face to the ground, pointed upwards, whining in a low tone,
"debil-debil!" Orton had got up and we then saw a faint luminous
ray which reached from the zenith, until lost in the tops of the
trees which were our horizon. I was sorely puzzled. So was my
comrade. "Strange part of the world, we've got to, sir!" "Strange
indeed, Orton; but have you ever seen a comet?" "Never, but I've
seen pictures of them: some with straight tails, some curly; but
nothing that I thought more than a yard or so long! See there!
sir; it begins right overhead, and we can't see where it ends
over those ridges!"</p>
<p>True enough! I had seen a comet: but such an appearance as
this was far beyond any preconceived notion of mine as to what a
comet <i>could</i> be. We lay looking, and smoking, for at least
an hour; lying on our backs we stared until&mdash;under the
consciousness that it was not a "fire-stick"&mdash;our eyes
closed, and did not unclose again, till the sun was above the
silver-leaved ironbark trees and scorched us into activity.</p>
<p>So enamoured had we become of this camp ere the evening of
that new day, that we determined to rest yet another. There was a
large fig-tree close by the banks, from which we got a large
tasteless fruit. Our practice upon the black swans gratified our
pretensions to the proper use of the rifle&mdash;(muzzle&mdash;no
breech-loaders in those days!) and the wallaby and paddy-melon in
the brush at hand made us well content&mdash;being no longer
hungry&mdash;with the world around us. There were no readable
signs of the neighbourhood of any ruthless men and brethren; but
that they could not be far away was, though reasonable, not a
disquieting conjecture. That night the faintly-rayed streak in
the heavens presented a more startling but sublime attraction to
the gaze. It glowed with a roseate glory, the hue of which
resembled that of an <i>Aurora Australis</i>. Was this the
angels' pathway? This the patriarch's vision of ascent and
descent to his pillow-stone at Luz? I felt that it was a comet:
but for such a portentous revelation out of the depths of space
what could reassure the persuasion of my eyes? Broader and
brighter, night by night, on our journey&mdash;now
homewards&mdash;laid itself out this celestial sign athwart
one-half the dome which vaulted the vision; and narrower and
fainter, night by night,&mdash;long after my return to Cecil
Plains&mdash;did the gentle withdrawal of the "roseate
trajectory" reconcile us to the loss of that which had been
summoned, perhaps, to lend its glories to the senses-worship of
other unseen worlds.</p>
<p>The "Boyne" settled the vexed question of the Condamine. There
was no presumption after such investigation&mdash;however
incomplete&mdash;in confidently asserting that the system of
waters on which we had fallen, after crossing the heads of the
more eastern shed into Wide Bay, must be that which disgorges
itself into the Pacific north of Hervey's Bay. We had gone far
enough to see that there was a yet larger stream, with which it
must have become joined, coming far away from the westward now
called, I think, the Burnett.</p>
<p>We left our Comet Camp with reluctance: followed it down until
we had assured ourselves of the general "lay" of the land, and
turned up the stream in search of the best country&mdash;sure to
lie about the sources&mdash;and the nearest to our southern
neighbours on Darling Downs, which I might mark "Russell and
Glover's sheep-station."</p>
<p>Along the banks of this stream we had seen and followed the
fresh tracks of the fellow bush-waif, I suspect, of the beast
killed in Eales' woolshed, but did not succeed in getting a
glimpse of the animal.</p>
<p>On the flats of Burrandowan, ere long I shouted "Eureka", and,
so far, my labour was over.</p>
<p>So far! I say so advisedly; for, having fixed upon the spot, I
turned my attention to the Condamine, which we knew to be away to
the westward still, and so went away towards the setting sun:
crossed a wretched, sterile, scrubby, stony ridge of no height,
which separated the heads of the Burrandowan from those of the
Condamine contributors, and at once found ourselves perplexed by
the baramba or briklow (bastard rosewood) scrubs, which spread
themselves out over the wide, flat country, stagnating in the
soakage, which cannot correctly be said to "run" to the banks of
the latter river, as far as we knew in those days, at any
rate.</p>
<p>Only one watercourse in any way promising did we see, and to
this I afterwards directed my friend Ewen Cameron (of Cameron and
Bell), afterwards in the office of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, of
Sydney, in memory of whose good deeds a statue stands now (1887)
in front of the Department of Lands. Bell and Cameron's sheep
were at the time resting on a part of the north branch of Cecil
Plains, but they soon occupied the country which I had seen,
under the name of "Cooranga".</p>
<p>For fifteen days did we elbow our way through this
inhospitable tract. Leading our horses, and plunging through one
interminable scrub into open "melon-hole" spaces encircled
thereby, into its opposite edge, almost every sunset after a hot
and breathless day would bring upon us an accompanying
thunderstorm, which in their succession seemed to vie with our
Wide Bay visitation. Our only clothes had been rent and had
rotted, and reduced to our threadbare blankets, which we
converted into ponchos. We then struck the Condamine, not more
than two days' ride below the Jimbour woolshed.</p>
<p>Early one morning, after leaving the eastern watershed, we had
suddenly come upon a tribe of blacks encamped in a small open
space in the heart of the scrub. We had not been seen, and, out
of curiosity, we approached, still unobserved, near enough to
watch their domestic arrangements. Here and there were groups
lying about warming themselves after the night's deluge; here
gins were drawing in wood, there others blowing up fires: spears
were piled together like muskets on a march; laughing, jabbering,
they seemed contented enough; but what specially attracted our
surprised attention was a group of piccanninies using miniature
bows and arrows. Jemmy was as much astonished as we; we had never
had reason to suppose that natives had in anywise become
acquainted with the use of such an implement, even as a child's
toy; and often had we spoken thankfully of their ignorance of it
as a weapon, in the use of which they would assuredly have become
exceptionally expert. On this occasion only did I ever see, for I
had never heard of, an instance of its adoption in any shape.
Before leaving this camp I secured a specimen, which I took to
Cecil Plains. It was but a little harmless affair, made of a
myall branch, and equally childish arrows. I took a note a few
days afterwards of this occurrence.</p>
<p>The men who were not basking were arranging their kangaroo
nets; others were practising with the spear and boomerang at the
trees. "Dreaming of no intrusion," I have written down "their
wonder was great at seeing us. When I shouted many rushed at once
to their spear-stands, others stood their ground, while some were
hiding their weapons for use. I suppose, if they found occasion.
These neither approached nor retreated; but one man, evidently
not belonging to the tribe, came forward, and to our
astonishment, called out: 'Who are you, white-fellow?' He proved
to be a runaway black from a Macintyre mob, who, having committed
many depredations far away to the southward, had fled for safety
to the north; the others had not seen whites before, though they
had heard of them. The Macintyre native came close to us, quite
fearlessly, and desired the others to keep back&mdash;a skilful
man&oelig;uvre, which gave them a chance of stealing round us in
the scrub, which was defeated by Jemmy's watchfulness. They then
tried to be friendly, but we declined further intercourse."</p>
<p>Upon our arrival at Jimbour we found Henry Denis, as fine a
fellow as ever breathed&mdash;at home. We were now well into
1843.</p>
<p>That night, there being no sheet of bark untenanted by a
sleeper, I laid myself down on the earth floor of the hut;
another man, whom I had observed smoking outside, came in and
stretched himself in a blanket by my side; I had been told he was
a stranger. By the fat-lamp light I was struck by his appearance,
which worried me by the fixed stare of his eye at me. The
repulsiveness of his features was intensified by the loss of the
other; and his unquiet vigilance disturbed the sleep I wanted; so
I took up my bed and walked outside for the night. Next morning
he had disappeared, and I thought no more about him. On returning
to Cecil Plains the following day, I first heard of a dastardly
murder which had been committed on the Downs last year, 1842. The
victim was a hawker, named Kelly, travelling with his father's
dray.</p>
<p>The perpetrators&mdash;for it seemed that two had been engaged
in it&mdash;had, up to the time, escaped; but one was supposed to
have been lost or killed on the Big river after separating from
his mate in the business. In this "mate's" description, which had
been proclaimed in all these parts, was one unmistakeable guide
to recognition&mdash;the loss of an eye! On immediate enquiry
further, I now was convinced that my bed-fellow at Jimbour was
the scoundrel "wanted", for the police were out after him, two of
Commissioner Macdonald's having been stationed at Etonvale at
this time. I sent word to Jimbour to call attention to the
occurrence, and it at once struck Denis that there was much
probability that I was right; for he found that my one-eyed
friend had been at his wool-shed, some fifteen miles distant,
and, finding that he was looked upon as a suspicious character,
had decamped thence; come to the head-station the day of my own
arrival, and had again as strangely disappeared. Denis at once
followed his track, in company with my old acquaintance at the
Peel, Irving, of the 28th, picked up the scent at Westbrook,
followed in 'pursuit over the Main Range, and wholly lost it at
Gatton, or Grantham, close by, which the villain had left but a
few hours before, and all traces were, for a time, lost. Barker,
who had been a sojourner with me at Etonvale, had returned
thither from Sydney about this time, and had resolved to settle
on the Logan. On his way to the station which he had
acquired&mdash;I think by purchase from "Tinker" Campbell, of
Westbrook&mdash;he stopped at a shepherd's out-of-the-way hut,
and to this shepherd happened to mention that a large reward had
been offered for the apprehension of Kelly's murderer, of whom
Barker gave the full description issued. Within a few days the
one-eyed desperado walked into this very shepherd's hut. His
appearance betrayed him. Assistance was quietly obtained; the man
seized, tried, convicted, and hung at Newcastle at the very time
that Barker was in waiting there, some months afterwards, with
the steamer which was taking in coals&mdash;as usual in those
days&mdash;for the purpose of proceeding to Brisbane, he being
one of the passengers.</p>

<br>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">In</span> 1844 a narrative was arranged by the
late Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Malcolm from some rough
notes&mdash;never intended for publication&mdash;which I had sent
home about my flittings in Australia, the country to which on my
starting in 1839, he had, in all good meaning, wished me
"God's-speed."</p>
<p>Sir Charles was at that time President of the Royal
Geographical Society to which he communicated the paper.</p>
<p>In the desire to furnish evidence of the current ideas of the
topography of our new district in the north I shall not hazard
any from recollections of my own; for I was unable to keep any
log upon my trips, beyond a special date now and then,&mdash;when
I am enabled to stand upon the surer ground of contemporary
observation and suggestion set forth in a letter written in
England in reply to Sir Charles' application to Mr. Glover, of
Norfolk, which I find in these late years among others recently
recovered. It is bracketed with a note:&mdash;"On Stuart
Russell's return from this expedition" (spoken of in the
preceding chapter) "he immediately made arrangements to set out
again with his brother Sydenham, Glover, Orton and the black boy
to revisit the river" (on which I had taken up the run of
Burrandowan) "but of this journey there is no account from him."
The following is given by his friend and companion. Glover, to
Sir C. Malcolm:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I shall have great pleasure in complying with your
request by giving you such information as I possess with regard
to the Condamine and Boyne, and shall feel most happy if I can
aid in throwing light upon my friend Russell's notes, kept, I
believe, merely to give an outline of his rapid journeys in
search of a good station, certainly with no view to
publication.<br>
<br>
"You are aware that I accompanied him on his first, down the
Condamine: and on his last, down the Boyne&mdash;two rivers, as
we have proved, in no way connected; to them, therefore, I will
principally confine myself.<br>
<br>
"At the close of the year 1841, Russell and his brother Sydenham,
Frederic Isaac, and myself started from Hodgson's station on
Darling Downs in search of pasturage for our flocks. Before
descending from the Downs, we proceeded to Jimbour, which lies as
near as I can calculate sixty miles due north from our starting
point, and is the last station in that direction on the Downs. At
this time little or nothing was known of the Condamine below a
large lagoon which lies twenty-five miles west of Hodgson's. Some
supposed it was lost in a swamp, others that it was one of the
tributaries to the Darling; for various reasons we were of
opinion that it took a turn northerly somewhere below the lagoon.
We went on this supposition from Jimbour, which we left at
daylight, took a north-west course and travelled all day. Seeing
no signs of water, we were considering what to do, when curious
as it may appear, we were guided by our horses, who seemed from
instinct to know where water was, for when we gave them their
heads they pushed rapidly forward; just before dark we came on to
a beautiful reach of a large river, which we concluded from after
observation, must be the Condamine." (G. is in error: we dropped
upon, and into, a large lagoon formed by the river's back-water
in times of flood. A bell-bird, I recollect, first intimated our
approach to the water, which, in truth, our horses
found&mdash;not we.)<br>
<br>
"There are convincing reasons, I think, that the Condamine is an
inland river; whether it is eventually lost in the scrub, or
takes a turn to the southward, remains to be proved: it cannot
turn east as the Main Range lies between it and the sea.<br>
<br>
"I have already stated that we came on the river in rather more
than a day's journey from Jimbour, say thirty miles; this station
being about ten miles below the plateau of the Main Range gives a
distance of forty miles from the summit. We found, on our journey
along the river, streams or creeks flowing into it on both sides,
the eastern ones from the range: one from the southward joined
the Condamine a few miles above where we turned back; it is
nearly as large as the main river, and I am inclined to think, is
a stream I came upon far inland from Hodgson's, whilst on an
expedition with Pemberton Hodgson.<br>
<br>
"Finding no country that would answer our purposes, we returned
in three days in a straight direction to Jimbour. When we left
the Condamine it was running W.N.W. The Condamine before this was
almost unknown below the lagoon, though Scougal had some sheep on
the Myall creek extending down to the river below. The distance
we went down the river might be eighty miles as the crow flies;
we returned convinced that the Condamine was a western
river."</blockquote>
<p>Upon our return to Etonvale from our trip beyond Jimbour, in
search of a sheep-run&mdash;23rd October, 1841&mdash;I was too
ill to renew it in some other direction. My brother Sydenham and
Fred Isaac went off in good heart without me, as the need of a
station had become pressing. I was indeed grateful.</p>
<p>We had rejoined, presumably, a continuation of the Condamine,
beyond and below the junction herewith of the Jimbour
creek&mdash;then the northernmost station on Darling
Downs,&mdash;so they now proposed examining the land lying
between the point at which the river had not been traced out of
the Broadwater, upon which Rolland and Taylor had formed and
occupied their cattle station of Tummavil&mdash;next below
Leslie's crossing place&mdash;to the spot at which we had lately
intercepted the stream followed down by us on our last ride. I
have before me a letter of my brother's to his mother at the
beginning of the year 1842, which gives the result:</p>
<blockquote>"Having accompanied my brother Henry in his late
unsuccessful expedition in which we struck upon what we conclude
to be a portion of the lower course of the Condamine, I set out,
soon after our return, to explore the country in another
direction, Henry being unable, from illness, to join me. I left
Hodgson's station on the 7th of November, 1841, accompanied by
Isaac, a capital man for the bush. My object was in the first
place to discover, if possible, the re-appearance of the
Condamine after losing itself in the lagoon, being persuaded that
as the latter had no visible outlet for the waters it received,
they must escape by some subterraneous channel, and might
somewhere be found to re-appear on the surface. On the second day
we reached Taylor's station on the lagoon, which is seven miles
in length," (here they learnt that the Gore Brothers&mdash;St.
George and Ralph&mdash;had taken up country from Taylor's
boundary: had struck upon a deep bed some miles below a small
creek on which they had decided to build their head
station&mdash;Yandilla&mdash;and marked a tree some twenty miles
or more below it for their sheep-run), "and having followed it to
its furthest extremity, we shaped our course from thence in a
direction, as nearly as we could judge, the same as the river had
held before it fell into the lagoon.<br>
<br>
"At the end of one day's journey we came upon a small gully,
across which we could jump. This gradually widened till it broke
into a deep, rocky river-bed, on both banks of which was a fine
open grazing country; and here we took up thirty miles on either
side, marking two trees with our initials as having taken
possession by right of discovery, which would [but did not]
prevent anyone else from settling upon it within three months
from the date of the license given for it by the Commissioner of
the district. It requires one to be well acquainted with the
peculiar nature of the rivers in Australia to trace out their
true course, for some of them, particularly in a dry season,
present only long reaches or mere pools, and are here and there
entirely lost; though there are others which have a full stream
throughout the year&mdash;such as those on the eastern side of
the Great Range, which run into the sea. This river is a very
fine one, for this country; its direction is first N.W. and then
more northerly&mdash;of course, not running except in Hoods; but
having beautiful long reaches, with deep water, and fine lagoons
branching out of it. The country on the west side, though not
hilly, is undulating; on the east flat and rich, the best for
pasturage. There is plenty of the best kind of
timber&mdash;iron-bark, blood-wood, pine, swamp-oak, and the
best, I think, of all building woods, stringy-bark. In fact we
have found a most beautiful spot for our head-quarters, with this
great advantage: that we shall not be troubled by the natives"
[vain hope!] "as they never harbour where the country is open,
and we have no scrub on our station. By-the-bye, when we were
following down the river we came suddenly on a native encampment.
Strange to say, we were within twenty yards of them before either
party saw the other. I galloped up to them, when one and all
bolted into the river, leaving their opossum cloaks, spears,
boomerangs, tomahawks, and all kinds of things, at our mercy.
After a short time they came over to us, but we could not make
them understand, although we had a native boy with us," [Isaac's
Charcoal] "but he was of another tribe; the languages of the
tribes are so different. Their spears are about fifteen feet
long, some slender, some very heavy. They can throw them forty
yards and can hit anything. The nulla-nulla is the worst weapon;
it is a short club about two feet long, which they throw with
awful force. On our return the report we made of the country was
hailed with joy.<br>
<br>
"We have called our new station after you, 'Cecil
Plains.'"</blockquote>
<p>Recurring now to Glover's letter&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Boyne was discovered by Henry Stuart Russell,
having with him his servant Orton, and a native, in the following
way:&mdash;Russell had heard from Davis, a runaway convict, whom
he found with the natives up the Monoboola, on his boat-trip to
Wide Bay, that there was a very fine country immediately in the
neighbourhood of Eales' station, which report he found wrong, so
far as to its being near that station."<br>
<br>
"He determined on a journey to Wide Bay, and from thence to
prosecute his research. Having reached Eales', he only remained
long enough to recruit, and started in company with an overseer
and a man of Eales' in a W.N.W. direction, and had one of the
most formidable journeys that can possibly be imagined. The
overseer and his man very soon returned, disliking the dreary
waste and rugged country they encountered. It was, indeed, a very
hazardous undertaking, as they had to travel through the Bunnia
Bunnia country, which at this time was swarming with natives, who
assemble for the purpose of feeding upon the fruit. After
travelling over a broken and rugged country, they came upon a
large flowing stream, which he supposed to be the Boyne. He found
a lovely country upon the river, and left with the determination
of revisiting it. Delighted with the report he brought in, we
(the party before mentioned) * started off with a month's
provisions in a due N. direction from Jimbour, with the full
intention of tracing the river down to its very mouth, which the
nature of the country and want of ammunition afterwards prevented
us from entirely accomplishing.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Wrong. It consisted of Glover, Henry Denis (of
Jimbour), my brother, myself, with Orton and "Jemmy."]</p>
<blockquote>"On leaving Jimbour the whole character of the
country alters. Instead of the wide-spreading plains upon the
Darling Downs, the traveller comes upon a fine undulating
country, thickly timbered, and covered with the most luxuriant
grass; the ridges are chiefly granite. There is little, indeed,
no standing water for the first twelve miles; four miles further
on is 'Hungry Flat', so called from our sufferings from hunger
whilst there."</blockquote>
<p>On our return the same way we halted at this spot: man and
horse hungry and weak. Horse had the best of it. We had been
almost without any food for days past. It had become unpleasantly
less before that. Denis looked worst. His white features and jet
black beard and eyes were too trying a contrast. Our horses
grazed awhile and with the exception of my brother, Orton and
myself, the others rode off as quickly as they could manage
knowing how near we were to Jimbour station. It was a painful
effort we made to catch our unsaddled horses, and we jogged on as
painfully and in silence. On reaching the hut, Denis was lying
near the creek very sick: Glover squeamish. They had "bolted" all
the eatables. Having to wait, we escaped much of such an
unpleasant result from sudden repletion. Poor Denis! He
afterwards told me that the feeling of starvation had so clung to
him that he never could lie down to sleep o' nights without a
"whack" of damper under his pillow!&mdash;until, I suppose, he
left for Sydney and went down in the "Sovereign" at Amity
Point.</p>
<blockquote>"Here we found a chain of ponds, running west, which
supplied us with water. At the end of this valley we with
difficulty fought our way through a scrubby pass, on clearing
which we burst upon a fine open forest glade with a rich dark
soil. A stream from the Great Range runs through it into the
interior. Being now some twenty-four miles north of Jimbour we
determined to change our course and cross to the eastern slope of
the range; this we did, and having descended about four miles
from the summit, say two hundred feet, came upon a creek which we
followed: it zig-zagged a good deal but its lay was decidedly
northerly becoming larger every mile. We thought we had got on
one of the main branches of our wished-for river, the Boyne, and
so it proved to he. The bed of this river, near its source, lies
in a valley elevated above the sea, I dare say fifteen hundred
feet; receiving small tributaries from the higher country both
east and west.<br>
<br>
"Its bed is sandy, with much tea-tree growing in and about it; a
great quantity of high reeds grow also along the edge of the
reaches. On our first day's journey down the river we passed over
some lovely country; nothing can be more luxuriant and lovely
than the valleys. On our second day's journey down we found the
reaches increasing greatly in length, a sure mark of a large
river; many streams, both from E. and W. emptying themselves into
the mainstream, the land becoming more mountainous, the valleys
richer and more fertile. The third, we passed Burrandowan, a
beautiful spot, which we afterwards made our station. It is fifty
miles in a direct line from Jimbour. On the fourth day we came
upon a river flowing in from the eastward in a full stream; it is
about twenty-five miles below Burrandowan. This we called the
'Stuart', after the discoverer Stuart Russell. Not far below this
we came on his tracks, when he had discovered the Boyne, by which
he returned, crossing the Main Range, going down upon the
Condamine, and returning up the river, and so to Jimbour, his old
place of departure.<br>
<br>
"We continued our journey down, keeping along or near the banks
of the river for about three hundred miles, though I do not think
the distance from Jimbour was above one hundred and eighty miles
direct, lying N. by W. and S. by E. (this would place us about
latitude 24 deg. 15 min. S.), when we turned back, having then
been sixteen days from that station. Our return to the station on
the Downs, taking a straight course, occupied ten days. When we
turned back the river was flowing considerably to the eastward of
north, and to judge from appearances, we were not far from the
sea. From its size, I am of opinion that at this part the river
is navigable. I have now given you a hurried sketch of our two
expeditions, and shall feel pleased and gratified if any
information I have been able to contribute may be found of
service to my sincere friend, Henry Stuart Russell. Nothing would
have delighted me more than to have accompanied him on an
expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, which would, I doubt not,
have laid open a valuable country, into which Asiatic emigration
might be introduced to any extent required.<br>
<br>
"I shall conclude this letter with a short account of the natives
who inhabit the countries which the Boyne and Stuart, with their
tributaries, water. I found them in considerable numbers, and
have seen even four hundred men at a time, with not an old man
amongst them: they are generally a fine-formed race, both men and
women, many of the former six feet; and many of both sexes far
from ugly: they are treacherous, cruel, and great thieves.<br>
<br>
"When I first went to Burrandowan I tried kindness. I showed them
how they might have flocks of their own to feed upon, and gave
them presents, but all in vain. They are a restless race, never
remaining above a day or two in one place, except when planning
some expedition against a hostile tribe or to rob the white man.
When they are bent on an act of murder and robbery, they assume
towards the intended victim a manner of great kindness. Two of my
poor herdsmen were murdered by the very men who had been
associating with them and helping them only the very day before
in fishing, in all apparent simplicity and kindness. In fact, I
have now ascertained that when the natives are seemingly most
friendly they are meditating an act of treachery.<br>
<br>
"To conclude: As far as experience yet goes, I should say that
the native Australian is, like the brute, incapable of
forethought; and in no instance that I have heard have they
attempted to add to the comfort of existence by building huts, or
by rearing herds of cattle or sheep, &amp;c. They kill all within
their reach, and thence move to another ground. Whether they will
ever be brought into a state of civilisation I have doubt. In my
opinion the only hope there is must arise from some bold
missionary, who dares venture to live amongst them as Bracefell
and Davis did. Such a sacrifice on the part of an educated man is
almost beyond hope."</blockquote>
<p>Our sheep at length, then to be permanently folded on
Burrandowan, were, indeed scattered. Some at Etonvale, some at
Jondaryan, and one flock at Cecil Plains.</p>
<p>This last-named flock was on the west, immediately opposite to
the spot on which I had "sat down" under three sheets of bark on
the east bank of the Condamine: kept close under my eye, in fact,
for safety's sake. Every man carried a double-barrelled gun in
those days. On my return from the Burrandowan trip with Glover I
had decided to move to a spot lower down, and there form the head
station. The dray had just gone on with all our "swag". Orton and
I remained, waiting to assist the shepherd, who was alone, in
driving the sheep the same way, before their starting in a few
days to a rendezvous appointed for all the separate flocks, <i>en
route</i> for the new station on the supposed Boyne waters.</p>
<p>On the point of crossing the river with this intention, I
suddenly heard the loud report of a gun, followed by a shriek of
agony. We ran to the bank, and found the unfortunate shepherd
holding in his left hand the wrist of his right arm, which was
blown clean away from the shoulder, out of which spouted forth a
strong jot of blood.</p>
<p>Having a stock-whip with a long green-hide fall, I made a rude
<i>tourniquet</i> with that and the handle round what remained at
the shoulder. The compression was effected by no skilled hands,
but was sufficient for the purpose. We carried him to our bark
hut with little hope, poor fellow; the look of despair in his
face&mdash;he was a young man&mdash;haunts me to this day.
Rolland. a medical man by profession, had just become the partner
of Domville Taylor, at the Tummavil lagoon, thirty-three miles
higher up, and had arrived at that station. Away went Orton
within ten minutes for his help, and I was left alone with the
terrible companionship. He had but lately come out as an
emigrant; a native&mdash;as some others of our shepherds
were&mdash;of Shelford, near Cambridge. "Water! Water! Water!"
was his moan. "I'll go back again when I'm well where I needn't
carry a gun," was his burden at other times, "How cold my fingers
are!" feeling with his left for his shattered right hand: "I'm
getting better," towards evening. "I don't feel pain now, sir."
Mortification had set in round the wretched thong. "Thank you,
sir; I shall never forget your trouble!" The sweeping over his
poor face and limbs with a sapling branch, in almost hopeless
endeavours to keep off and guard him from the attacks of flies,
which in countless myriads, seemed ever recruited again and again
from other myriads, for fresh assault upon his dying
blood-stained limbs, had brought me on that day of cruel heat,
almost to a helpless state, through exhaustion.</p>
<p>Five, six, seven hours; and yet no sign of help! (Rolland had
not been at home when Orton, with his horse dead-beat, reached
the place, and he did not return for two hours afterwards.) I
dared not leave the quiet, patient sufferer for cooler water from
the river, and this in the bucket was tepid! And yet "water,
water" was the cry! What if he drink it all! The sun was getting
low, and its westering beams were already searching out the open
end of our rough hut. In heart-breaking bewilderment&mdash;I knew
not what to do. "Neither the sun nor death can be looked at
steadily," said one once, who had perhaps never tried it in this
fashion, with sun and death on either side. And in this dilemma,
snatching a fresh, more leafy branch for my steadier service, his
<i>thin</i> voice reached me and told me that he had taken his
gun up from the trunk of a tree on which he had laid it that he
might smoke a pipe, that drawing it towards him the dogs' heads
had caught against it, and (Well, I could understand all this.)
"Listen! I know now that I'm not to live more. Listen while I
can&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;" He had little time to speak, and the
sun was going to rest. Silent the hostile swarms! My own heated
pulses more cool! As music evoked from a single string by a great
master's hand in scorn of collateral aid, so does the master hand
of Death summon out of the silver cord "or ever it be loosed" the
low strains of conscious truth from the whispering lips, which
quicken&mdash;how profoundly!&mdash;the listener's soul-stirring
symphony of human sympathy.</p>
<p class="quote" style="margin-left:10%;">"The tongues of dying
men<br>
Enforce attention like deep harmony;<br>
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain,<br>
For they breathe <span class="u">truth</span>."</p>
<p>(How Shakespeare fills every cranny of this mortal coil!) 'Tis
not for me to speak again of that short life's sad reflection of
its past upon the passing soul, and not for me to speculate. What
he said, he said to <i>me</i>, and in all solemnity of hope,
'twas buried with him in the shallow grave, which I dug with dry
sticks on the banks of the river Condamine.</p>
<p>I then found that I was alone! I was not so much longer. The
sound of voices and the rustle through the saplings in another
hour or so woke up the stupor which I had seemed to share with
the dead brother by my side, and I came back from past to
present. "Well, sir!" almost whispered the eager tone of Orton's
voice&mdash;for he was ahead of Rolland: "Where is he?" followed
at once the kind voice of his follower. "Well done! Well done!
but it's too late!" Dead silence. "Let me see him, Russell!" I
struck a light: I had preferred the darkness beneath the stars
till then: Rolland went stooping under the sheets of bark: the
fatty flame fed but a flicker.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Rolland came out again: "If I had been on the
spot when this happened, Russell, I could not have saved life!
"My last seemly office over the rude mound under which we laid
him, I would have rendered for the sake of his old folks at
Shelford, which I knew so well; had I been able. But I had to
leave him to the gum-trees sighing their dirge over the dead.
Their Æolian service might be breathed to the day of his
resurrection.</p>
<p>And so our sheep in course of time reached a place of rest:
but from the outset to the end of the venture, <i>ne</i>
patience, <i>ne</i> perseverance, <i>ne</i> pluck, <i>ne</i>
purse were able to balance again the scales in which the "scab"
had deposited the maximum measure of mercury and maladroitness.
Glover and my brother, within the space of two years, had become
disheartened, and disgusted: Went to Sydney, on their return to
England, and during their absence I took their place.</p>
<p>It was a dismal task!</p>
<p>I think that every man would have bolted from the station in
dread of an <i>assaut d'armes</i>, which the natives had already
once provoked by their murderous attempt and savage bearing: but
the road through that scrubby pass to Jimbour cowed them into
righteous observance of their agreements. I must relate one
instance of the effect of fear, the relief of which added much to
the burden of my custodial cares.</p>
<p>The principal sufferer in this case, as in the former, was
again one from Shelford, near Cambridge. His name was Matthews:
he had a son with him also shepherding at Burrandowan.</p>
<p>Before my taking charge, a large mob of blacks had "baled up"
seven men, all well armed, at a station not two miles below the
head-station. Glover had, with much resolution and daring,
relieved them, when aware one early dawn of the outbreak, the
noise of which had reached his ears. He had found the shepherd's
hut barricaded, which many hundreds of lighting men had
encompassed. Their yells had thoroughly daunted the
terror-stricken inmates, who for the most part had not been a
year in the colony: they dared not even open when Glover called
upon them to do so. Having made his way through the mob which he
had routed bravely, it was not until he had driven them out of
sight, that he obtained admittance. Matthews
<i>père</i>&mdash;who, in his own village at home, was considered
the "cock of the walk"&mdash;declared that he was too ill to go
out with his sheep. On my arrival, I found him so still: I had
him removed to the head-station, and there attended him as well
as I could, in the absence of medical help which was out of
reach. He suffered no pain: he could not stand: was helpless.
What he said was, that on that day (of the attack) he felt very
cold: could not recover warmth afterwards: that it clung like ice
to his feet: and had been creeping higher up his limbs day by
day: all appetite had disappeared: his features a pallid mask. He
knew that he should not recover: yet he had been notably a hale
man, who used to brag that he had "never had a doctor." About
forty years old, he had always looked what he said he
was&mdash;strong, hale and hearty. Still, day by day, he told me
the cold got up higher and higher: then spoke of his old home and
wished he had never left it: and so death bore him away from
under my eves so quietly that I did not at once see that he had
fallen into a sleep which was no counterfeit. Dr. Cannan told me
afterwards, at Brisbane, that it was an evident case of death
from fright.</p>
<p>The year 1843 had been marked by little beyond the routine of
station, save the one&mdash;to us, out of the way as we
were&mdash;most welcome tidings of the coming of Macdonald,
Commissioner of Crown Lands hitherto for New England, including
this district, in company with the Commissioner elect for Darling
Downs, Christopher Rolleston. One of the first cases requiring
adjudication was our dispute&mdash;for I was now in partnership
with Gerald Brooks&mdash;with Somerville, who, on the part of his
principal, "Dicky" Jones, had occupied part of our run, on which
he had ever since been poaching.</p>
<p>About May, the two Commissioners came to my cottage at Cecil
Plains, and, after hearing the requisite statements, rode over
the ground, and the result was a kind of compromise, which I
cannot explain, for I never clearly understood on what grounds we
were deprived of the part usurped, which has ever since been held
under the name of St. Ruth. The decision lay with the senior
officer; his junior, whom we rejoiced to see&mdash;and much more
so, when we had come to know him better&mdash;being now only
installed into the appointment on the settlement of these
cases.</p>
<p>Cambooya&mdash;Commissioner Rolleston's pleasant, open-door'd
and ever hospitable dwelling soon became the centre of a social
gathering, which it would have been difficult to match for
good-fellowship and warm attachments in any other spot of
Australia at that time. The beauty of scenery and the delicious
atmosphere of Darling Downs imparted, I think, that health to our
cheerfulness, and brightness in our relations one to the other,
which no disappointment, loss, failure, nor bad markets and
impecuniosity could long extinguish. Then there were so many
pleasant environs of that central spot. Etonvale, Felton, Gowrie,
Jondaryan, Jimbour, Yandilla, Tummavil, Clifton, Glengallan,
Canning Downs, Toolburrah, Ellangowan. Would that that little
world could have stood still! There were henceforward six years
of a period&mdash;the happiest, at least to me (<i>en garçon</i>)
that I have known. Perhaps some may have thought so since, but
not said so, since we have been moved on by the
policeman&mdash;Time.</p>
<p>The round of visits: the hearty welcome: the unreserved faith
in a neighbour's willing service, if practicable: the scorn of
thinking it a trouble: the laughing spirit of hope acclimatised
to the habit of sanguine prospects nursed in spite of panics and
poverty! The past year had been one of trial and distress:
bullock drivers lighting their pipes with "the cove's soujee"
orders; for many Sydney houses, firms, and banks had passed on
their way in no wise rejoicing.
Wool&mdash;sheep&mdash;cattle&mdash;they could no longer keep the
pot boiling. So into the pots the poor valueless brutes were to
be themselves pitched. "Tallar" and "tallar casks", "Tinker"
Campbell, and Kangaroo Point came to be the sole set-off against
low wool, no advances, and ready ruin.</p>
<p>So it continued a long, dreary, penniless period, but there
was no abatement of Darling Downs hilarity&mdash;the jollity of
inter-station visits, practical jokes and pleasurable passages of
days, which culminated not unfrequently in the contentment and
comfort at our Commissioner's Cambooya. A day at Rolleston's was
always red lettered!&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">"Where cheerful looks made every dish a
feast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'twas that crowned a welcome."</p>
<p>[Cheeriness was then the squatter's <i>viaticum vitæ</i>]</p>
<p>Barrin' himself&mdash;hard up all round.</p>
<p>"Did you see Hodgson hawking legs of mutton in a butcher's
tray on his shoulder at Brisbane?" "Yes, that I did. ha! ha!
There was a fellow down there who had a terrible 'down' on
Hodgson. He met a man at Kangaroo Point&mdash;no. South
Brisbane&mdash;'Buy a leg of mutton? only one shilling' Come,
take a lot of them while you're about it!' So he did."</p>
<p>"Do you see that fellow out there?" said he to me again. "He
hates the very sight of me, I'll bet you a pound though, I'll go
and sell him a leg; done, cried I, not knowing his gift of the
gab: By George! I lost it: he sold the enemy two! and got my
pound into the bargain. Oh! that <i>villian</i> Huggerson, ha I
ha I in these bad times to lose a pound on a leg of mutton! ha!
ha! I'll be quits with him some day."</p>
<p>Ups and downs! bullock-punching or butchering, baking or on
the bench, boiling down, bargaining, betting, branding, begrimed,
we played with the hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly game of
living much as children with the see-saw. Either end had its
laugh: more than that, the panacea pipe.</p>
<p>Pinched, yet pining not; dunned, yet despairing not; in debt
deep, yet not in the dismals; we, some at least, were buoyed up
through trials and troubles into that enviable state of "all
serene" by the positive element which the sympathy of our common
lot created.</p>
<p>A distraction at times now eased us of personal annoyance,
present broodings, and conjectures for the future. An apparently
organised rising of the blacks had created a sensation all
around. "Tinker" Campbell, and Hicks had been waylaid in the
scrub at the foot of the range, and had a very shave of escape:
Pearce's shepherds at Helidon killed, and their sheep cooked,
though saved from the eating by prompt pursuit. The Clifton
(Forbes') drays stopped by barricades, and the loads destroyed,
after ransacking and carrying away all things portable.
McConnell's men killed, and sheep taken. Outrage enough to
electrify the promptitude of both commissioners&mdash;Simpson and
Rolleston&mdash;who having at once sallied forth with mounted
police and squatter's <i>posse</i>, were supplemented by
Lieutenant Johnson and ten rank and file of Her Majesty's 99th
regiment, and having scoured the scrubs with as much hope as one
that "looketh for a needle in a pottle of hay," nevertheless,
took special note&mdash;in the end&mdash;of those scoundrels
concerned in the murder of Moore's child at Limestone, a little
while before: "Jacky-Jacky" and "Peter" of black descent.</p>
<p>Our authorities also stationed&mdash;after all was
over&mdash;half-a-dozen "diamonds" of the 99th at the Rocky
water-hole, who had orders to escort all drays through that
shadowy pass for the future, to the first spur of the Main
Range.</p>
<p>This combative era gave an opportunity to the waggish
propensities of one who was afterwards the clever editor of our
earliest Brisbane newspaper&mdash;the <i>Courier</i> (he must
have had a spice of his namesake progenitor's nature), for an
amusing "poem after the style of Virgil and Homer," upon the
<i>derrin-do</i> of the "Quatre-Bras" of commissioners, police,
commissioned officer, and privates concerned in this
re-establishment of order and confidence ir; the district. It
bears&mdash;to my recollections, at least&mdash;the names of the
dear "old fellows" of the time, a distinct "harking-back" to the
squatting circle in which I was wont to sit. The "Raid of the
Aborigines", by Wilks, was, for a time, the wealth of wit in our
wilderness.</p>
<p>Wide Bay, too! the place on which I had set my early hopes. I
find in one memorandum of October of this 1843rd year of our
Christian era that "no other lives have been taken by the blacks
on Eales' run since those of the four shepherds in May last." Yet
I know that the men are afraid to take their sheep out from the
huts. Eales has the only station yet on the waters of Wide Bay,
and his venture must be a fearful loss,&mdash;beyond the
human.</p>
<p>Backwards and forwards from the Downs to Brisbane.</p>
<p>It was very hot and still on that evening, when, with some
half dozen others of Darling Downs, I rode on from Limestone to
Brisbane.</p>
<p>The only hotel in Brisbane! always full of squatters, a class
whom citizens therein would live upon and by, but employ little
else in exchange for such profitable acquaintances than secret
abuse and utter heedlessness of the "<i>convenances</i>" which
could make, during the brief sojourn therein, the difference
between disgust and content. Enjoyment was but a <i>façon de
parler</i>!</p>
<p>The inevitable beef, damper and tea was scornfully dropped
behind by the squatter faring his way eastward. "We'll go
to&mdash;&mdash;. What do you say?" So Smith. "Can't help it; it
seems there's no other place!" So Jones. "Yes, we can camp at
South Brisbane," sneered Robinson. "Oh, that
be&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;," would objurgate, perhaps&mdash;Crusoe.
And so to the,&mdash;was it not Bow's?&mdash;would they go in
full-blown hopes of a change. The change from salt beef to
well-broiled mutton chops: from damper to delicate toast and hot
rolls: from tea to coffee of appetising odour&mdash;hot and
delicious as of old in the <i>Places de Paris</i>, when lounging
over cafe <i>noir</i>, or <i>au lait</i>: full-blown hopes which
would all burst in their bubbles on reaching the threshold of
mine host of the&mdash;what was it?&mdash;Queen-street.</p>
<p>The tired hacks left in a paddock on the other side of the
ferry would acknowledge graciously the attention paid them when
turned into a grassless paddock, by taking a good roil in the
dust or the mud, as times might decree, but their masters'
meekness would be sorely muddled by the reception in the licensed
house which spread a roof over no conceivable accommodation
acceptable to a squatter better than a brandy bottle.</p>
<p>"Waiter! can we get beds here to-night?" I well recollect on
this occasion, in company with some weary ones, after a hot ride
from the west. "Can't tell." was the boozy snarl from the throat
of a slipper-shod biped, who from the colour of his skin perhaps
had never known&mdash;decidedly never could have
honoured&mdash;father nor mother; "can't tell, there's some coves
in them there bunks: they can make room for you, rouse 'em out."
"Well, let us have some dinner, something to eat." "You'll have
to take what ye can get then, so I tell-ee," growled the baboon,
"but what will ye have to drink?" "Tea, of course," in simplicity
anticipating black, modestly engreened bohea, lump sugar, and
cream." "Tea! ye &mdash;&mdash; ," roared the sneering scoundrel,
at whose head an empty decanter snatched from the common table
was impulsively levelled&mdash;and he bolted.</p>
<p>Oh, that dinner! Before we turned in we found comers earlier
than ourselves wailing in very bitterness of good appetite, and
the knowledge of good feeding, over their brief experience of the
"good accommodation for man and horse," which made the
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; in Queen-street disagreeably notable.</p>
<p>The Coffee&mdash;or common&mdash;room ran east and west,
parallel with the street; on the south side was a row of doors,
similar somewhat to those which backed up the fore-and-aft
saloons of ships in those sailing days. In front of the doors, a
long table, on which chops of mutton, or steaks of beef, just
killed, shot out of a frying-pan in company with potent onions
and floods of boiling grease, followed each other, morning, noon,
and night, on which wayfarers were expected to tertiate each day
the tough teeth-task, accomplished only through the soft
insipidity of squashed pumpkins and sweet potatoes. All the stuff
issued out of a filthy kitchen at the back. In front was a
verandah, through the french windows of which, now and then, an
untainted swirl of air would vainly attempt to qualify the meaty,
fatty steam within. Repulsive enough; yet hunger must grab and
grub; what wonder that such solids sorely tried the complacencies
of degustation, deglutition, and digestion, and too often drove
the Queen-street diners from disgusting diet to disgust-drowning
decoctions.</p>
<p>On one such morn of craving dissatisfaction, I rose from my
flea-branded blanket on a stretcher opposite another, upon which
a very inert specimen of bush humanity was stretched; one who had
not been capable of stomaching the <i>table-d'hôte</i>, and had
found his solace in blanket and bottle. Soon after the first
faculty of sleep in the morning had begun to soothe&mdash;kept at
bay, as it had been, all night by mosquitoes&mdash;I was startled
by the sound of a bell, the bell for breakfast. The click of
spoons and cups, and of such things as people do not eat, opened
ears and eyes. Cautiously opening the cabin door, I saw the long
table and a long table-cloth of sundry dyeings: covers, as usual,
over preparations presumably ante-prandial, prandial, and
post-prandial; all <i>en régle</i>! Yet there was something more:
the baboon had done his devoir: he had gone. Poring over a large
dish&mdash;into which a bundle of boiled eggs (<i>mirabile
dictu</i>!) had been launched, I was suddenly aware of a presence
of which an old-fashioned, grand-fatherly, cotton-tasselled
night-cap was the capital feature. By every yahoo of Etonvale,
'twas Arthur Hodgson! He, unconscious of my own mosquito-vexed
intrusion, was busy&mdash;with his mischievous eye and
smile&mdash;in using a pencil upon each egg as he fingered it out
of the dish. I coughed: he turned, putting his finger on his
lips, "hush!" <i>Pari passu</i> we strode towards each other.
"What are you about?" "Look here, old fellow, we can't get a
decent blow-out: these eggs, at least, can't be dirty in their
'innards', whatever they have been boiled in. We'll keep them to
ourselves, old boy, sit near me: don't you hate fried
mutton-chops and what they call steaks, and all their onion
abominations?" "Of course: but what are you at?" "Don't you see?
I've marked them all with a date two, three and four months ago:
Who'll eat them?" I stuffed the cuff of my red flannel
shirt-sleeve into my mouth, and we crept back to our bunks.</p>
<p>In a few minutes came our mongrel waiter: "Breakfast! d'ye
hear?" Some grunted in reply: some jumped up; some cursed the
"baboon" for not calling them sooner: and out of one door, into
which the wretch had thrust his head, issued, very venomously,
the head with an iron-heeled boot in company.</p>
<p>The issue of Hodgson's "dodge" was worthy of his old cockpit
mess. We two, at least, monopolised (is this a bull?) the
gratification of rejected eggs&mdash;to which no one, on
inspection, addressed himself. Individually, I felt grateful that
day to Hodgson's "<i>ex tempore</i> adaptation of the incubator
to our fresh appetites."</p>
<p>I "chanced" also, after this ride, upon a bridal party, a very
novel sight at Brisbane. 'Twas the first notable wedding
performed there, I think: even that of my worthy friend of
"Rosenthal", on Darling Downs, Fred. Bracher, who had, with Miss
Grace Ross, of that ilk, entered upon the irretrievable condition
together for "better and worse!"</p>
<p>That rattling good fellow, Fyfe, of the Logan, had, I now also
heard, brought the fine-looking horse, Mentor, into the district.
The Pine river, too, had found some attractions in the squatting
way, for my old acquaintance. Griffin, of the steamer "James
Watt". had come to an anchor there in the new character of
landsman; and I grieved to hear that the station not far from
Limestone, of my yet older acquaintance, John Macdougal, had been
positively ransacked by the blacks.</p>
<p>Through such a stream of sensations, sorrow, and strife did we
pull the seasons of 1843. The promise of its end, and hopes of
new-born habitude beckoned us on to beacons beyond, not
brightened yet. We could feed their glimmering but by our "taller
and hides".</p>
<p>There was no flickering in the glimmer; it was steady. The
drama of 1844 was yet untyped; one of its <i>personæ</i> had in
itself a lustre, which Queensland cannot escape from reflecting,
smudged by her thankless hand though the retrospect be.</p>

like pictures, are litter for a corner than a full light"?</p>
<p>Pictures nor men dare often challenge a full glare. Imminent
men occupy but their special niche in the gallery of fame. I run
the risk of provoking the Apellean censure: <i>ne sutor supra
crepidam</i>, when I tread upon the toes of popular and
unqualified approbation by venturing to question Ludwig
Leichhardt's fitness for the leadership of men (in the bush
sense, with no doubting as to his scientific qualification) in
the undertaking to which he bound himself in 1844, and persisted
in until he passed out of sight.</p>
<p>It is not an easy, and to others it may seem an uncalled for
expression of private opinion to discuss the means applied to
working out the end of a grand desire; while falling short of the
admission that the method of obtaining that end was as worthy of
admiration as the conception itself. The first act in the drama,
in which Leichhardt was the chief actor, long since met with
general and loud applause, and challenged unmodified public
praise. "It is success that colours all in life." Fain am I from
private reverence to join hands with public acceptance: yet, when
I approach in thought the day when I first fell in with the
learned traveller, I find my esteem for himself as a doer (I
speak as a squatter) at variance with that unreserved public
approval which has been accorded him in the past. The idea of
making an overland trip to Port Essington had been considered
very soon after the occupation of Darling Downs by the first
squatters. From private discussion it had reached public comment.
In the <i>Sydney Herald</i> of September 12, 1843, a long article
on the advantages of opening a communication overland to Port
Essington appeared. Towards the conclusion it says: "it is
certainly not a time now to look for any aid from the Colonial
Government, even for such purposes, but there arc, nevertheless,
some men of high emprise in the colony who being heartsick of the
impious plaints of others for money, desire nothing so much as
some field worthy of "human efforts uncontrolled." We know that
there are such men in this country. Cattle and provisions are
cheap, and tropical Australia has never been explored. We want a
high road through it to India, to China. <i>A stream of
population is required from Asia</i>. If for such a purpose a few
hundred pounds cannot be raised in the colony, even in these
times, beef and flour, at least, may be spared, and a party of,
say, twenty-five selected convicts, encouraged by a promise of
liberty on good behaviour, would be enough, under a <i>leader</i>
fit for the undertaking. He should be well acquainted with the
habits and general character of the aborigines, and well used to
the bush. The party should set out from the head of the river
Condamine, to the westward of Moreton
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It should be borne in mind that the establishment at Port
Essington would preclude any necessity for returning by
land."</p>
<p>Again urging the same, appeared a letter in the same paper,
dated Friday, September 15, 1843, signed "Mercator", which shows
how much the proposal had taken hold of the popular fancy. The
outcome of this general conversation found in the report
published in the <i>Herald</i> of the 23rd of November follows
that of the Select Committee of the Legislative Council appointed
to ascertain the practicability of an overland route from the
settled districts of this colony to Port Essington.</p>
<p>On my return to Cecil Plains alone, one afternoon in the
middle of 1844, when within half a mile of the cottage on the
west branch of the river Condamine, I saw a surprising
object&mdash;surprising, at any rate, in that part of the
world&mdash;an old-fashioned tall black hat, a veritable
chimney-pot. It was shuffling along in company with a
"cabbage-tree." Of the wearers I could see nothing, because of
the low acacia scrub thick on the ridge about my stockyard.
Cantering on I recognised my Toolburrah friend, G.K. Fairholme,
and the sight of his pleasant, chaffing face gladdened my eyes.
But whose was the black hat? 'Twas Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt's I
Introduced, we simultaneously lifted our head gear. I took off my
own, wholly in astonishment at seeing the fine face opposite
suddenly bespattered with half a bushel of flowers, leaves, and
many vegetable specimens; the hat, too, was girt around by sundry
creepers and climbers, and here and there a beetle speared to the
rim. It was no guesswork to "twig" the botanist perhaps an
earnest and, to all appearances, amiable inquirer into the
general arcana of Nature&mdash;a man of science. The first glance
could read the German type; his first utterance signified it. He
disentangled his head, hair, and beard very quietly, and after
our first greetings&mdash;so rare the opportunity!&mdash;I found
that my short-sighted friend and the Doctor's eyes had not
descried my dwelling, at the back of which they had passed by
within a hundred yards, and were now leaving behind.</p>
<p>I had not at that time heard Leichhardt's name Fairholme
before long had given me an outline of his companion's pursuits
and ruling passion; spoke of his having lived with the natives
far away south and among those in the neighbourhood around
Brisbane out of sheer curiosity, as well as for the purpose of
adding to his collections. The Doctor himself could not believe
in the evil report which he met everywhere about the aboriginals
with whom and among whom he had dwelt unscathed, and concluded
that they were all alike, "and would do injury only to the man
who distrusted them and showed his distrust."</p>
<p>The very first evening of this pleasant meeting I learnt from
Leichhardt that he had wished much to see me because he had heard
that I was contemplating an attempt to reach Port Essington.
"True, Doctor Leichhardt: but it requires a good deal of
consideration, beyond the fun of the thing: I don't know what to
do with the station: I might be away six months! I'm sure that a
couple of good bushmen, with good horses, and plenty of 'bacca,
powder and shot might do it easily enough. I'd take Jemmy, and
Orton, my stockman, says he will come with me: but I can't say
when!" "Take a couple of my dogs, Russell," chimed in Fairholme,
"and if you get short of grub you can always eat them, unless the
blacks eat you first." "I'll take your dogs old fellow; but why
not come yourself: you've nothing to do in particular."
"Thank'ee, I'd rather stop at home: why I'm blind as an owl in
the daylight: I couldn't see your caboose <i>en passant</i>
to-day." "But how did yon manage to miss it, Doctor?" "Well! I
was looking all over the ground, and up the trees, and through
the air for what I could see, my friend: but I did not see your
cottage." "That wouldn't do for Port Essington, Doctor: you'd
have to keep your eyes open for something else than butterflies,
beetles, berries and Botany bundles: day and night, too: you see
those pretty bagatelles are not fit for eating: if you don't eat,
you'd starve: you'd have to keep your powder dry: and not be
above a pot-shot at times." "But I do not use the gun: I do not
care to carry the gun: I do not shoot." "Well, but Doctor, what
if the blacks were saucy: you wouldn't stand quiet while they
drove a spear through you, would you?" "Ah! then: I have seen and
been with them in the bush day and night: lived weeks in their
midst: they would bring me what to eat: they did not hurt me: I
do not think any blacks would hurt me." "But you were among the
tame blacks to the south and up the Brisbane, you don't yet know
what the 'Murrie' are." "Ah! then: I do think they are all the
same: if you have faith, you will be kept." Ah! then: thought I,
should not like to try it in your company. "Very fortunate.
Fairholme, that I dropped across you to-day! I've three men here
and one with a wife and two children; and not one of the poor
things could have seen you pass. I can't leave this; and it is
misery to be here&mdash;specially at night&mdash;and listen to
their groaning with pain from 'sandy blight.' If it had attacked
me too, we shouldn't have had a pair of eyes amongst us. So I
have to do everything for all!" "What is that?" broke in
Leichhardt, "the sandy blight? eh? It is Egyptian opthalmia: I
will cure it: a little water, please: I will look to them." He
opened a little case: took from it some nitrate of silver: made a
solution: a few drops under the lids upon each blood-blotch of an
eye, and a most marvellous immediate relief and&mdash;within
twenty-four hours&mdash;a complete cure was the effect.
Thankfulness for our <i>rencontre</i>, with this present
consequence, kept pace with my admiring surprise; for my
tribulation and helplessness had been for many days.</p>
<p>In a week or so we became more intimate and confidential. At
his wish I gave him a short account of my own trips into the
bush, but more particularly dwelt on what I thought I had learnt
during my last. In my view of the "Cross Range",&mdash;as I had
got into the habit of calling the Bunnia heights&mdash;I took a
start for conjecture from it as a base for the guess-work, by
means of which only could I pursue my fancies northwards.</p>
<p>I had, with my brother, pencilled out our assumptions as to
the probable trend of waters beyond our farthest search, and,
judging from a copy of this sketch, which was embodied with Sir
Charles Malcolm's narrative, which I have now before me. and,
recollecting our conclusions at that time, we evidently pictured
our persuasion that northward of the Bunnia the flow would be
<i>dos-à-dos</i>, in a manner, to that thrown to the southward of
the same hog's-back. The last trip with Orton. for some distance
at any rate, had given us a fair idea of the system then
positively unknown, as well as of the more westerly course which
the Dividing Range followed. Indeed Channels must be formed for
streams to the Gulf of Carpentaria and to the north coast; so we
thought that this wonderful barrier would probably take a round
turn with the coast all the way, at a rough guess. One point we
had agreed on, viz., that the Bunnia range must be the apex of
the eastern coast-board&mdash;the highest land to be met with for
a long way north,&mdash;pitching, as it did, streams from both
hands in opposite directions: southerly courses, as it were, to
Sydney; northerly to Cape York.</p>
<p>In the old verandah thus we discussed and smoked it (not
Leichhardt; <i>he</i> wanted no such cloudy philosophy), sending
at times for Orton to join our conclave, and help us in airing
our bush castle-building. Jemmy's instincts also were chartered
for such occasions. To the reply to "Which way, 'perroo'
(brother), that fellow big water you and me been make a light?"
there was never hesitation with "Me tink that fellow-way," with a
finger-post poke of the chin.</p>
<p>So engrossed did Leichhardt become by the subject that that
dear old fellow Fairholme (still living, I believe and hope, near
Munich) surrendered himself to the general bent, as well as his
amusing anecdotes and naive jokes, to the grave interest with
which his learned friend was now continually overhauling the
slack of his secret desires and aspirations, until in the course
of a few days more he was brought up all standing by the strain
of his own resolve.</p>
<p>The time was at hand for his leaving me. He had walked about
the plains, pulled up much grass and many weeds
which&mdash;ignoramus that I was&mdash;I trampled down
unconscious every morning; and, so far, Leichhardt was satisfied.
At length his thoughts, taken captive by this newly conceived
project of lighting up a path through the dark fastnesses to the
Gulf of Carpentaria, broke away from the reserve, with the burden
of which his mind had for some days been travailing. "Russell, I
am going to Sydney: I will go to the Gulf: I will go to Port
Essington: I will find help there and come back soon, very soon.
But, my dear friend, will you and your brother come with me? Will
Orton, too, come with me?"</p>
<p>The sudden assault upon compliance took me all aback. Having
seen the strength of his inclinations, and foreseen the probable
result, I had more than once spoken about it to my bush mentor,
William Orton. We had too much misgiving of the Doctor's "craft"
in accomplishing the undertaking; too much reluctance to pledge
ourselves to a position which might entail bounden acquiesence in
all his instructions, a position to which we were strangers; an
instinctive distrust, likewise, of his <i>savoir faire</i> and
his <i>savoir vivre</i> in a common bushman's way of getting on;
a shrinking, too, from such loyal co-operation with one whom we
could admire for his "pluck" and feature-read resolution, but
with whose confidence in his estimate of the wild native
character we could in no way sympathise to the extent to which he
had tried to persuade us, through occasions within his own
experience while in the indulgence of his ruling passion's
pursuit, and the display of his high and admirable qualities and
attainments.</p>
<p>"I tell you what, sir"&mdash;Orton's homely words will best
explain the dilemma,&mdash;the pleasure of compliance with the
flattering request of a man who had taught me to honor him, and
the severity of discretion and common sense,&mdash;"I tell you
what, sir, you wouldn't get on with Dr. Leichhardt a week. As for
me where you go, I go, if you wish: but you'll soon fall out, and
then we should have to come back with our tails between our legs.
<i>He</i> crawls along with his compass and thingummies: why, we
two, sir, and Jemmy to get honey and use his eyes, could do it in
half the time he'll take about it: 'tis my belief, if Dr.
Leichhardt do it at all, 'twill be more by good luck than good
management. Why, sir, <i>he</i> hasn't got the knack of some of
us; why, it comes to some like mother's milk! can't tell how or
why, but it does. Some of my mates on the Big river were no
better at the year's end in the bush than they were in the
beginning. Regular crawlers. Mark my words, sir, Dr. Leichhardt
hasn't got it in him, and never will get it. I don't mean to be
disrespectful: and I don't mean to say he can't and won't get
there: he's a brave gentleman, I don't want to be told that: but
how he'll get there in <i>his</i> way, I can't guess, and don't
like thinking about: he's no bushman, and I say again sir, if you
go you'll be sorry for it. Then again, what does <i>he</i> know
about the darkies? <i>I</i> know them better than <i>he</i>: and
I can't say that I should care to be in a mess with them, when he
won't carry even a gun; and if he did, can't use one."</p>
<p>All this was but the echo of my own whisper; and so I told
Leichhardt that I had too much to attend to in station interests
to be able to throw any shadow of consent upon the proposal: that
although it had been a pet idea of ours lately, I must not put
more serious matters aside for the sake of gratifying my wish;
and that he had better, if determined to carry the matter out, go
to Sydney and prepare himself there. And so we parted.</p>
<p>In August, Leichhardt returned to Darling Downs by Moreton
Bay, with his companions Roper, Calvert, and a clever sketcher,
but very young, named Murphy. He had others who, with a black,
made, I think, seven or eight in the party.</p>
<p>He had written to me from Sydney to tell me that his
preparations were nearly completed: that he had called upon the
Governor, Sir George Gipps, and had enlisted His Excellency's
good graces in the matter: and had told him that my brother and
I&mdash;having made his decision at Cecil Plains&mdash;had
promised to accompany him from Darling Downs, "and that he
depended on our doing so." This was the purport of his letter. By
my immediate reply, I repeated my reasons for having, at the time
he asked me, declined to leave the stations, and, of course,
regretted his misapprehension.</p>
<p>On this he did not, as on two subsequent occasions, make Cecil
Plains his starting point, and I was sorry to hear that our
refusal had retarded and disarranged his plans awhile. Pemberton
Hodgson * and Gilbert were afterwards added to the party. The
former soon came back having fallen out with the Doctor: the
latter was killed by the blacks in a night attack&mdash;(where
was their watch? the blacks had at this time shown much
hostility)&mdash;upon a stream which ran to the
easternmost&mdash;for them the wrong&mdash;shore of the Gulf of
Carpentaria; in which attack Calvert and Roper were severely
wounded, and "waddied": and after the lapse of so long a time
that all hope of their reappearance had been lost in Sydney, they
sprang up from sea-wards,&mdash;like the 'makromme', at Wide Bay;
brought from Port Essington by the schooner "Heroine" one night
into Port Jackson at the very end of the following
year&mdash;1845.</p>
<p class="foot">[* (Who with a black left the party after making
their start at Kents' Lagoon seventy miles beyond Jimbour, and
returned to Darling Downs.)]</p>
<p>On my next meeting with Leichhardt&mdash;when he stayed at
Cecil Plains, in preparation for his second venture&mdash;he gave
me a description of that nights' reception of himself in Sydney,
and bearing myself back to his side&mdash;for we often sat side
by side in the old verandah&mdash;I can re-enjoy the amusement of
his story. [If I fail in correctness, there may be some yet who
can set me right.]</p>
<p>"We did come to Sydney, it was quite dark, we did go ashore,
and then I thought to see my dear friend." I am not sure of the
name, I think Lynd. "So I went up George-street to the Barracks."
[Which Wynyard Square now covers, between D. Jones and Go's, old
premises, and within fifty yards, of the corner of
Jamieson-street.] "And then I went to his quarters, to his
window, he was dressing himself. I did put in my head: he did
jump out of the other window, and I stood there wondering. Soon
many people did come round, and did look oh! so timid! I did not
know all. Then came my dear friend." [I think, Nathan the
composer.] "And then there was such a greeting: I was dead, and
was alive again! I was lost and was found! Gome now, said he, and
hear, and he took me away, all the way to Pitt-street, and to the
theatre, and there was sounding in sad song my own death elegy! I
cannot describe after that, my friend: I was lost, and was
found!"</p>
<p>That elegy&mdash;if yet extant&mdash;may be sung to Nathan's
music now.</p>
<p>Upon this second occasion&mdash;1846&mdash;came with
Leichhardt his companions. The first, whose name mesmerises this
pen, was John Mann, one of a family whom I had reason to remember
in Sydney with a pulse of pleasure; Hovenden Hely, one of the kin
fire-side; Bunce, botanist of Melbourne, where (it was Port
Phillip then) "old Ironbark" had been no man in a corner;
and&mdash;well I with the exception of two natives I can remember
no more. Mules were their <i>spes gregis</i> (he had horses
besides); the cattle they had to drive rather disheartened hope;
yet with three "stringy-bark" bushmen of the "bonny brand," I had
great expectations of them, of bright days, bright deeds, and the
brightness of a swoop upon the denizens of the Swan River, to
which they had bound themselves, in the wake of which we pilgrim
pioneers of pasture paradises might plant our portions.</p>
<p>Among the mules which he had provided himself with, or had
been provided with by the Agricultural Company at Port Stephens,
I think, was an alarming buck-jumper. Leichhardt said "I will
ride him;"&mdash;it was the most promising of the lot to look at.
"You can't," had said some one (the Doctor was not a good
rough-rider). "I did ride him once and he did send me off: I did
ride him again, and he did send me off: we will see."</p>
<p>The Doctor got the mule up: on with the saddle, and into it,
hoist: in a second, I saw his head and heels describing a playful
<i>parabola</i> in descent: up again, unharmed and heated, and
away again in shuttle-cock fashion the Doctor's dignity
declined.</p>
<p>"I will ride you!" he chewed between clenched teeth: he did.
Man and mule! <i>Vive le Roi!</i></p>
<p>Poor Leichhardt! The doing of determined desire unto death.
His method and manner of doing, now no need to heed. What says
Young?</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:25%;">"Death is the Crown
of Life,</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:15%;">Were Death denied,
poor men would live in vain;<br>
Were Death denied, to live would not be life:<br>
Were Death denied, e'en fools would wish to die."</div>
<br>
<p>Many weeks after. Jemmy's black face appeared at my window:
"Me been see track belongin' to that fellow saucy yarraman that
been come along a doctor." "Which way, Jemmy?" "All along&mdash;a
north branch." What was the meaning of this? The "saucy
yarraman!" The kicking brutes had escaped from Leichhardt's hands
and returned on their own pathway. "Baal me see 'em; that gone
good way more furder." Sure enough! they went until stopped at
Rosenthal. Had they, then, been killed? Do these herald their
hearse?</p>
<p>A few days more&mdash;July, 1847&mdash;and back in funereal
procession, wasted, woe-worn, wretched, wandered in, one behind
the other, the hale, hearty, hopeful hands-in-hand who had gone
forth so many weeks ago! 'Twas a comfort to see so much of them,
after listening to Leichhardt's solitary plaint.</p>
<p>Fever, ague, rheumatism&mdash;in all their prostrating power!
"Bundle in! Lie down!" Thankful was I that not one had lost the
number of his mess. "A pot of tea. Aye! There is no grog." And
then a careless rest&mdash;a heedless sleep, were the first
night's need; and, in spite of the doctor's rheumatic moan the
sight of those sleepers was gladdening:</p>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:15%;">"Sleep, that knits
up the ravelled sleeve of care;</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:30%;">Sore Labour's
bath;</div>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:15%;">Balm of hurt minds;
great Nature's second course;<br>
Chief nourisher in Life's feast."</div>
<p>A few days yet more set them up exceedingly well. But ours was
no sociable gathering of comrades round the rough pine-table.
There was a tale to be told: that was over-plain. Looks askance
and silent lips courted no questioning: I could but feel thankful
that I had escaped the trial which better-skilled bush-craft,
truer <i>camaraderie</i>, and, I am afraid, more careful and
steady observance of considerateness and self-denial, (that
blessed bond of bush brotherhood) and warmer working sympathies
might have spared <i>these</i>.</p>
<p>Here, I thought within me, was Leichhardt's failing. So
wrapped in his own designs and pursuits and the attainment of his
own objects:&mdash;an illustrious name to carry back to his
fatherland: fame, by dint of which he might win back the
patrimony forfeited by reason of his <i>lâches</i> in evading the
conscription laws of his country: the good report of the world
wherewith to commend himself in gallant fashion to domestic
happiness; in these considerings so enfolded: by these so
absorbed that he seemed to forget the sharers of his toil and
risk: the fellow-workers of the wilderness without whom he could
not have faced it. Detailed explanations&mdash;worse than useless
to recapitulate&mdash;and which, in my admiration in other
respects, I gladly forget, served but to justify the estimate I
had already formed of Leichhardt as a leader in such an
adventure&mdash;not <i>sans reprôche</i>; however sound his title
to <i>sans peur</i> truly was.</p>
<p>The inactivity of tongue did not, I was soon delighted to
find, extend to the teeth of my friends, as they threw off their
ailments. Want of variety by no means cloyed their appetites:
Beef, damper, tea&mdash;smoke! damper, beef, tea&mdash;smoke!
tea, damper, beef&mdash;smoke!&mdash;just like the triple-bob
ding-ding-dong-<i>dong</i> of village chimes&mdash;came our daily
diet. Poor fellows! they had indeed to make up for lost time on
Peak Downs. The mules had escaped from them there, I think; if
so, no wonder that they could'nt look after them. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* These same mules were taken by Leichhardt on
his following and last setting forth. What can have become of
them? Surely they were not all killed. But not one ever
reappeared.]</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>One night the smell of roasting woke me: were they so hungry
that they could'nt wait for breakfast? Where, and what can they
be cooking? Unscrewing myself out of my blanket, I followed my
nose, which led me to Leichhardt's small separate room. To my
wonder and horror there he was, lying on his back with his
shoulder on the edge of the bed, frizzling over the flame of a
fat lamp, placed under it, <i>i.e</i>., the shoulder. His
rheumatic torture must have been, indeed, intolerable to find
relief by such a cautery. Yet Leichhardt declared it was the
first alleviation of his distress that he had been able to
devise. The prescription was an opiate for him, the sight of it
robbed me of further sleep. In the end the party broke up, and
again did Leichhardt return to Darling Downs&mdash;overland for
another invasion of the northern region. I was engaged, in March,
1848, in an arbitration case (at the request of my dear old
friend. Jack Crowder, whose wild cattle hunting guest I was
sometimes at St. Clair, Glennie's creek, and at whose death bed I
stood at Biarritz, in the south of France, nine years afterwards)
on behalf of the Aberdeen Company; and so met him with his
associates at Rosenthal, superintended by Frederick Bracker, and
stayed with them a while.</p>
<p>He told me that he did not expect to be out of sight less than
two, perhaps three years. We parted in the hope of meeting again
some day after his return from Swan River, to which the
journey-plan he had laid down was to be by the heads of waters
running to the northward until he reached those of streams
running to the western coast.</p>
<p>He and his party proceeded to Cecil Plains, and made a filial
exodus thence&mdash;but have never reached the terminus.</p>
<p>A man's hand may cover Australia on the map of man's charnel
dome. What a glorious God's-acre! "Here lie Ludwig Leichhardt and
his lieutenants."</p>
<p>No need to detail the public expressions of joy at
Leichhardt's despaired of re-appearance from his first journey
which connected us by land-travel with the north coast, in
Sydney, and through the whole country. Reference to the
newspapers and other records of the day, testifying in language
fertile with expressions of hope for the paralysed commercial and
other kin interests of the colony, enchanted the prismatic
fancies of citizens, and fascinated those of squatters, which
were well nourished by the oracles of the press. Meetings were
called for the purpose of raising means for a fitting testimonial
to the hero of the day, to whom soon after were accorded the
thanks of the country at the bar of the Legislative Boudoir. The
publication of the great traveller's report added fresh fuel in
March of 1846, to the flame of inquiry, and Leichhardtian fame.
The leaders of the daily journals were laden with delight and
gratitude, and broke down well nigh under the burden of future
promise and speculation. One paragraph from the <i>Herald</i> of
the 31st, proclaims the reaction at the eleventh hour of the
people's hopelessness of the adventurer's safety in these
words:&mdash;"The joyous exultant sensation which this brilliant
deed has inspired in the breasts of the colonists, is the greater
from its having so soon followed the gloomy disappointment caused
by Captain Sturt's last expedition. Sturt's announcement struck
daggers into our Australian hearts. Leichhardt has applied a balm
that has neutralised the poison, and healed the wound."</p>
<p>The incense of popular sentiment and sympathy enveloped even
in its perfumed praise the gallant captain of the "Heroine", who
had rescued and brought back the wanderers! May that silver
snuff-box be handed about for numberless generations as a proud
heir-loom to the McKenzies!</p>
<p>Government, too, on Cowper's motion, was mollified to the
extent of a grant of £1000 from the public purse, and even the
surviving helpers in the work were not quite overlooked and
forgotten.</p>
<p>So Leichhardt revelled in the victory won over the wilderness
and the affections of the numerous family which he had made happy
around him.</p>
<p>Brisbane, too, in her admiration of success so unexpected,
spread out her arms towards the schoolmaster who had taught her
what her province was and would be. My old friend, Henry Isaac,
supported by another whom I may yet again hail in hearty
health&mdash;Dr. Cannan&mdash;expatiated, at a meeting at
"Bow's", on the whole duty which had devolved upon us of due
acknowledgment of the "Doctor's" prowess. Fred. Isaac, at Gowrie,
when he heard of it, found every seat too hot, and sat not down
for twenty-four hours in impulsive preparation for prompt pursuit
to Peak Downs of the proud pilgrim's sandle-prints. Such was
Leichhardt's hour of success!</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell came back from a somewhat similar pursuit:
but he had been out-pilgrimmed. I don't recollect his welcome
back. Success had not been his. Sturt turned up in pitiable
plight and suffering: public pulses beat not the more
quickly.</p>
<p>It is not for me to withhold or wish to withdraw respect and
admiration of Ludwig Leichhardt as a brave man; one of great
perseverance and high attainments; but, on the lower platform of
fitness in all its varied forms for commanding that unreserved
acquiescence and cheerful obedience of his fellow-labourers as
their leader:&mdash;that unfeigned confidence, far above the low
suspicion which a questionable, and the absence of a purely
unselfish conduct in the petty but inevitable details of a
day-by-day wearisome, plodding, toilsome, hunger-breeding march
alone can generate:&mdash;that hearty co-operation in
precautionary arrangements against native&mdash;particularly
night&mdash;assaults&mdash;and last but not least, that cordial
attachment to their captain in an exploit in which to each the
setting of a sun doubled the danger; and to each the rising
renewed the fresh day's lease of life&mdash;I refuse to lay my
private tribute in addition to the public record and reward of
his public service. I must try back to the homely expression of
my unlettered, but perfect bush-companion, William Orton, that it
might be done "in half the time that he'll take about it: tis my
belief if Dr. Leichhardt do it at all, 'twill be more by good
luck than good management. I don't mean to be disrespectful: and
don't mean that he can't and won't do it: he's a brave gentleman,
I don't want to be told that: but how hell get there in his way I
can't guess, and don't like thinking about: he's no bushman, and
I say again, sir, if you go, you'll be sorry for it."</p>
<p>Have forty and more years passed and proved the stockman's
instinct at fault? From his return&mdash;so unexpected that it
was no uncommon expression to hear it called
resurrection&mdash;from Port Essington until he had again left
with his second party, in the hope of skirting the whole country
by the north and west coasts until he reached Swan river,
Leichhardt passed his days in pleasantness among the well-earned
plaudits of all people in Sydney. He lectured and was listened to
with interest and delight by crowds assembled at the Mechanics'
School of Arts. Public and private testimonials, evincing the
colony's thanks to our great explorer, were eagerly and
substantially conferred, and he as gratefully acknowledged the
generous approval of his work. Just after leaving Sydney, on
October 1, 1846 (one of his party, John Mann, going up by water
with provisions wherewith to load the mules which Leichhardt with
the rest were proceeding to take from Stroud overland to
Brisbane), the news reached Sydney of Captain Stokes'
discoveries, especially of the river Albert on the north coast
and, by means of his observations the correctness of Leichhardt's
inland was tested and to a great extent verified. On the way to
Darling Downs, towards the end of the month, he had the
gratification of seeing a report of this connection between
Captain Stokes' work and his own in a <i>Herald</i> which was
sent after him. One of his former companions to Port Essington
(Roper) accompanied the Doctor as far as
Rusden's&mdash;"Deepwater", I think, the station was
called&mdash;and then said "good-bye;" and it was not long before
Leichhardt's map, which he had compiled and sent to Arrowsmith,
was made the subject of universal interest.</p>
<p>Well, we know what followed this second attempt, and I have
already spoken of the return of the whole party to Cecil Plains,
thoroughly "broken down" and "knocked up", in July of 1847. On
that occasion he wrote, on the 1st August, a letter, afterwards
published in Sydney, from which the following is an
extract:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-right:15%; text-align:right; font-size:90%;">
"Russell's Station, Darling Downs.</div>
<div style="margin-right:5%; text-align:right; font-size:90%;">"1
August, 1847.</div>
<blockquote>"I had reached the camp of Messrs. Blythe and Chauvel
the 21st July: and Mr. H.S. Russell on the 28th, where I propose
to leave my things till a new party is organised which, I hope,
will be about the beginning of
May.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the many hardships we endured, <i>my party

<p>When sufficiently relieved from his terrible rheumatism he
left me with F.N. Isaacs&mdash;of Gowrie,&mdash;Bunce, and a
black with the view of examining the country lying between Sir
Thomas Mitchell's track&mdash;of which he had now heard&mdash;and
his own, and gave a long account of the result published in
Sydney in the following October. In it he repeated his thanks to
Bunce, one of his last party, who had not left him with the rest
who returned to Sydney. Then came out also a flattering review of
Leichhardt's Journal on his way to Port Essington in 1844-5, and
the last trustworthy information by letter ever Written by him,
was from Macpherson's station on Fitzroy Downs, at Mount
Abundance, in his final effort: being the last, I must further
preserve it as far as I can by extracts.</p>

"April 4, 1848.</div>
<blockquote>"I left Mr. Birrell's station (the last on the
Condamine) on the 23rd of March. On the 24th I continued for
about three miles from Dogwood Creek in latitude 26 deg. 53 min.
Passed some line country on a good-sized creek which, I think, is
the outlet of the Kmu Creek which Mr. F. Isaacs is going to
occupy. The 25th we travelled again to the westward: crossed a
chain of lagoons: entered again a bricklow scrub, out of which we
came into the waters of Sandy Creek, or the "Gregor" as Mr.
Archer and Chauvel called the western branch of it. Camped on the
Gregor in latitude 26 deg. 52 min. Up the Gregor ten miles on the
26th. I am inclined to think that the Gregor will turn out to be
my Robinson's Creek, to which I came in latitude 25 deg. 30 min.
on my former expedition. The 27th of March we continued our
journey about nine miles west-north-west, and camped on
Horse-track River in latitude about 26 deg. 43 min. The 28th we
travelled sixteen or eighteen miles due west, and encamped on the
Yahoo River of my former trip. The 29th we travelled scarcely two
and a-half miles, through myall scrub, when we came on another
large creek which, no doubt, is one of the branches of the Yahoo
river. The 30th we travelled about ten and a half miles west by
south, mostly through thick bricklow scrub, and encamped on a
large creek which I considered to be Bunce's Creek: our latitude
was 26 deg. 43 min. The 31st we travelled eight and a-half miles
west by north, when we encamped on another good-sized creek. On
our march we found the Downs next our camp did not continue far
to the westward, but that they changed into bricklow scrub with
open patches: at about four and a-half miles we crossed a creek
which was larger than that on which we had camped: the country on
its banks was very open: in some cypress pine thickets we
observed numerous old cattle tracks, which we met again going to
the west creek, on which we camped in latitude 26 deg. 41 min.
This latter creek I distinguished by the name of the M creek, as
Mr. Hentig found that letter on one of the trees not far off our
camp. We ascertained afterwards that Mr. Macpherson has taken
possession of the upper part of this creek to form a cattle
station, and that he has already put some of his cattle upon it.
The 2nd April we travelled ten miles west-north-west over most
beautiful downs, with belts and patches of scrub, particularly to
the south-west and west: to the northwards (N.W. by N.), we saw
two distant hills: to the eastward, the blue Grafton Range: to
the west-north-west, a scrubby, short range, composed of two
swelling hills and a hillock, which proved to be Mount
Abundance.<br>
<br>
"The whole country between Mount Abundance, the Northern Hills,
and Grafton Range, is an open, almost treeless stretch, which is
beautiful indeed, and deserves Sir Thomas Mitchell's calling it
'a splendid region." The 3rd of April we travelled over the
scrubby pass of Mount Abundance to the W.N.W. and came after
three or four miles to the principal branch of the Cogoon, and to
one of Macpherson's sheep-stations: the head-station being about
four miles to the southward, I travelled from Birrell's to Mount
Abundance in eleven days: over about one hundred and eighteen
miles. We were most kindly received. I cannot speak in too high
terms of my present party. We have killed our first bullock at
this station to obtain the necessary provisions to carry us to
the Victoria. We have been extremely favoured by the weather. Our
mules and bullocks are very quiet, and we have travelled from
Canning Downs (Leslie's on Darling Downs) to Fitzroy Downs
(Macpherson's) without any accident, and without
interruption&mdash;with the exception of four days' stopping at
Russell's (Cecil Plains), from the 3rd of March to the 3rd of
April."</blockquote>
<p>There was vet one, but a doubtful trace of Leichhardt's
movements in the following July. It appeared in the <i>Maitland
Mercury</i>, and says: "We have been favoured with the sight of a
letter from a gentleman in New England, dated June 11th, which
states that a Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, whose station is on the
Bundarrah river, had informed him that 'Dr. Leichhardt had
returned three hundred miles to the farthest station to say that
he had found a magnificent country, with beautiful grass and
water; that Leichhardt thought that he <i>might possibly never
return</i>; or else not for so long a time that it would be a
pity such a country should remain unknown; that his party were
all well, and that he had returned to them.'"</p>
<p>Since this apparition no sign has been made by one of that
pilgrimage. Suggestions, squabbles, surmises, and sensational
stories have been suffered in abundance. No one has unriddled the
fate of the brave little band.</p>
<p>In Leichhardt's first setting forth on his chivalrous exploit,
there was not much, I think, in its conducting which was likely
to strengthen faith in followers, however willing to subject
themselves to his guidance and control; at least some who had
been with him awhile and knew him pretty well, rather wondered at
his first success, than felt their confidence in him as a leader
established. Little surprise would have been felt had he never
re-appeared from his venture in 1844. Few, I am very sure,
expected really to see him again in Sydney: the country had quite
made up its mind, that he and all with him had perished. The
circumstances attending his arrival from Port Essington, by the
"Heroine:" proved how wholly he had been given up Gilbert,
doubtless, met his death through neglect of the commonest
precaution; it seems strange that any escaped in that night
assualt. Had he never been restored to us, how ready&mdash;and
this I often heard before Leichhardt's resurrection were people
to cry out "I told you so! who ever thought that a man of his
ideas about the bush and the blacks could go through such a
journey unscathed and successful?"</p>
<p>Out of the despaired of result boiled up a reaction which, to
some, at least, seems excusable and natural enough but not a
little extravagant. Let us read but the speeches at meetings the
applauding cries of the papers, the flattering terms which lent
no additional glory to his true merit, and which, I at times
thought, were met by him with some misgivings, and had become
embarrassing. He felt thus impelled to a grander effort. He tried
and came back&mdash;as we know. I know the terms which Leichhardt
used in reference to his companions on that occasion, and I also
know they came back in enmity&mdash;in parties of
two&mdash;divided against each other. And yet, how can I, in the
face of what I know, read the concluding paragraph of the letter
which he wrote from my station, in which they many days formed so
"happy" a family, without amazement, now many years old, but not
dwindled away: "Notwithstanding the many hardships we endured,
<i>my party behaved extremely well!</i>" What can the conclusion
fail to be?</p>
<p>Has this sad story shown that first impressions as to his
capacity for such a work were groundless and unjust? "Success!
Ah!" cried the man of the world, the great French philanthropist.
"Nothing succeeds like success!" The meed of honour which
Leichhardt enjoyed here was, indeed, short-lived.</p>
<p>The chain of his success yielded by a natural law, at its
weakest part; that one unsound link ruined the service of its
powerful coadjutors by its inefficiency in bearing a strain, to
bear which it had been tested by no satisfactory proof. Endowed
by nature with a deposit of rich gifts, courage, tenacity of
worthy purpose and ambition, for which he rendered the usufruct
by enthusiastic efforts in the cause of research, and a course of
discovery to which the spur of public hopes and applause had been
applied, he lacked, I think, in the practical adaptation of his
talents to a struggle with a venture then formidable through
unknown difficulties by land, and certain risks by man, which he
almost ignored: common sense, and a sufficiency of self-denial in
crises of suffering.</p>

<p><span class="a">From</span> this year, 1845, come thickly
recollections of names and persons which supplement those of the
earlier western days with many,&mdash;surely in accord with the
brighter life into which the baptism of Freedom had enfranchised
the new bairn&mdash;Brisbane.</p>
<p>With "Who comes here?" might the last of the ferry-stop
sentries have challenged the fresh foot-steps, and quickly
recovered arms with heedful respect at the sound of the
reassuring passwords of Robert Little or Kearsey Cannan,
patriarchs of progress and practice, pioneering powers of
pleading and physic in the pristine period.</p>
<p>Followed on; so quickly too! the record which bears upon its
page&mdash;Henry Buckley, Walter Gray, Robert Pickering, Cribb
and Dowse. Follow the march! Why stop to call the roll while on
our way? No fear of filling up, for the present, and in the
present, the places of such as have fallen out of the
ranks&mdash;to rest: but <i>for</i> my past, and <i>in</i> my
past, none can occupy the old arm chairs of those by whose sides
I loved to linger, nor fill the void which such recollections
verify. 'Tis hard to tax one's regrets still: yet later years
crop up with such a harvest! So rich that I dread passing by one
sheaf unregarded. Robert Douglas, John Harris and his brother.
Raff and his brother, two Roberts, not brothers; and within the
binding conspicuous&mdash;Duncan, Thornton, Sheridan. Round about
too, on the field, stand the jolly presences of Carter, of
Kangaroo Point, old Williams, and Grenier, of South Brisbane,
Hodges, the boat-builder, Cassim and Prentice. I'm not yet
Lethe-dipped, whichever bank of Styx we wander on! Year by year
fresh facts, fresh interests, fresh stimulants to
existence,&mdash;until 1847, which I stumble over with sorrowful
amazement in remembrance of one of those terrible soul-quakes
which to so many come as a thief in the night.</p>
<p>"Good-bye! good-bye! good-bye! old fellow, I am glad you liked
that bustard yesterday," said I to Ralph Gore, my esteemed friend
and neighbour, of Yandilla. "My brother shot it&mdash;a capital
shot too; measured one hundred and twenty-three yards, with a
small belted ball. Just twenty-two pounds; the largest I have
seen killed yet. The plains swarm with them." "Well,
but&mdash;Russell&mdash;I want you to come next Friday to
breakfast upon one with me. It shall be soaked in salt and water,
as you advise, the whole night before. We've a capital hut-keeper
now; and I want you to hear a new air on my old fiddle, too!"
"All right, I'll be there by nine o'clock."</p>
<p>A pleasant, hungry ride I had over the thirty miles on Friday
morning, looking forward to a bustard breakfast&mdash;the best
bird of any size, I think, in the country. "Well, Gore; here I
am, with an ogre's appetite!" "Oh, I am so sorry. Can you believe
it? the plains are covered with the turkeys, but I've not been
able to shoot one!" My confiding simplicity that it had been in
the larder when he asked me the day but one before to come over
created general glee; so we had the fiddle out, and then attacked
other unusually nice things which quite consoled me. "Where did
you get all these good eatables, Ralph?" "Oh, I forgot to tell
you. My brother Robert has come up with all his family, excepting
the eldest, a daughter&mdash;left at Pemberton Grange, on the
Parramatta. They are hardly shaken down yet. and won't be here
long, I fear; they talk already of an early return. Will you come
and see them after breakfast?" After the pipe of repletion and
preparation, down to the cottage we strolled, and so pleasant was
the <i>entrée</i> that, being loth to leave, I remained a couple
of days, by their kind invitation. It was early in the February
of 1847. "I shall try to go to Sydney at the same time next month
as you and your family," said I, in parting; "my neighbour on the
other side, old Denis, wants to go too, I know. He has not been
there for years, is now getting up the ladder, I hope, and has
business to see to. We'll have a jolly party on the passage.
Good-bye!" Good-bye, indeed!</p>
<p>In the following month&mdash;March&mdash;having unexpectedly a
good deal of work to attend to, contingent upon the driving some
cattle to my run&mdash;(I was alone by this time, having a year
before bought Brook's interest in Cecil Plains, as he wished to
leave the country)&mdash;of Rosalie Plains, adjoining Jondaryan,
I found myself so hampered that it was not until the end of the
10th that I was free to catch the steamer, the "Sovereign", to
Sydney. News from the outside was so capriciously conveyed. that
I had heard that the southerly weather was so had that she would
remain at Brisbane for a week or more probably beyond her day for
sailing, and that there was every chance in favour of my reaching
the settlement in time. Starting that night, leading one horse to
relieve the other when fagged, and which when turned adrift I
knew would in another day be back at the station. I rode through
to the settlement, arriving in the following afternoon. Then I
found that I was too late, much to my chagrin and
dissatisfaction. The "Sovereign" had left Brisbane a week before,
and been ever since detained by the severe weather at anchor at
Amity Point. "Couldn't I catch her still?" Of course I could, if
I could get a boat. Angry, and rebelling against the idea of
losing my anticipated holiday: tired and out of sorts by work and
want of rest, I became the more indignant when the chance escaped
me. I could get no boat. Turning back to my quarters in
Queen-street, I saw some blacks talking and gesticulating to some
white men, apparently in an equally excited condition. "What's
the matter?" "These blacks have come from Cleveland, and say that
the 'Sovereign' is lost and all the people with her!" Terrible
but perhaps inaccurate report! A few hours confirmed its truth,
however. Of the cabin passengers none but Captain Cape, in
command, and Richard Stubbs; of the crew and steerage two young
boys and six men were saved. A full account of this fearful wreck
appeared in a <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i> of this month. The
lesson learnt by such an escape&mdash;as I now felt in conscious
shame thankful for&mdash;may not be repeated aloud. On the very
day (the 16th, my own <i>dies natalis</i>&mdash;I do not forget
that year's anniversary) which I had proposed spending joyously
in Sydney, I rode back to Darling Downs in silence and sadness,
taught that "there's a Divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew
them how we will."</p>
<p>This one sad recollection which has overtaken me, must not,
however, swamp some others which much affected us in the previous
year. For at the beginning of 1846 the discontent of the
squatters who, in very truth, were subjected to a very harrassing
and unsound position, culminated in an address to Lord Stanley,
then Secretary of State for the Colonies. The proposed "Waste
Lands in Australia Bill" gave the opportunity, and the grievances
which threatened ruin to the pastoral interests beyond the limits
of location at that time were ably set forth and urged upon the
attention of the Home Government. "Fixity of tenure" and "right
of pre-emption" were the questions at the root of this agitation;
and these two grand principles were at length recognised as the
basis on which the "waste lands question" should be discussed. So
far, the squatters had won a victory; yet this squatting system
had sprung up only fourteen years before. Through this year the
policy and whole bearing of Sir George Gipps in his
administration were by a very general voice bitterly denounced:
the name of Wentworth was, of course, conspicuous at all public
meetings held with the view of making the Governor's burden too
heavy for him to bear. Daily journals all the year through vied
with each other for the most part in the merciless assault. His
Excellency was recalled&mdash;to die&mdash;ridden to
death:&mdash;jockey, "Bob" Lowe. An ineffectual attempt was made
by Lord Stanley&mdash;afterwards Lord Derby&mdash;to establish a
northern colony extending from the 26th parallel of south
latitude to the northern limits of the land, which his lordship
devised to meet the need of the times. Colonel Barney&mdash;who
had been in command at Woolwich, came back this year to set it
a-going: in January, 1847, left Port Jackson in the ship "Lord
Auckland": entered Port Curtis: struck upon a reef: landed, and
endeavoured to form an establishment on Facing Island: and after
three or four months abandoned it, re-appearing in Sydney in the
May following. So much the better for coming Queensland!</p>
<p>In this year of 1846 the last vestiges of the old settlement
<i>régime</i> were obliterated. Captain Wickham (R.N.) was
welcomed and soon worthily "worshipped" as Police Magistrate of
Brisbane; and our old kindly host, the last of the commandants
disappeared with the steam of the "Tamar;" the last of the
Government stock at Limestone in the steam of the pots, which
reduced to "fat" their full value: not so ruinous a result,
however, to the Government as poor James Canning Pearce's
"Experiment" was to him by plying between Ipswich and Brisbane,
which kept him always in hot water, and ended in the smoke of the
patriotic sacrifice he offered to public progress, convenience
and growing requirements. The project was well conceived, and
deserved success. Pearce was a man a-head of the times.</p>
<p>This was an epoch, too, remarkable for energy in exploring.
Poor Sturt (whose letter addressed to me from Port Phillip with
an invitation to join his calamitous expedition the year before,
arrived at Cecil Plains long after he started, and was out of
reach) returned in February crestfallen and nearly broken down in
spite of his iron constitution, with many of his associates,
blind. Mitchell had been looking after Leichhardt, and already
was Leichhardt girding up his loins for the crowning effort. The
first brew of so much stirring up in the middle of 1846 frothed
into discussion and strife when grafted upon political stock,
under the heating apparatus initiated on the one side by William
Wilks: on the other by Sydney Lyon; and instituted by their
several organs, the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i>, and the
<i>Darling Downs Gazette</i>. The local contest pre-eminent being
that of Brisbane versus Cleveland as a shipping port: and thrust
and parry between Towns and Downs. The <i>Courier</i> made the
notable hit of the year, I thought, by first inviting and ably
sustaining a proposal for the establishment of a bank in our
present metropolis.</p>
<p>Other strife&mdash;but in a different sphere&mdash;caused no
little sensation&mdash;and some amusement among my neighbours on
the Condamine in the course of the year 1846. Jack Wilson and his
gang of outlaws had by some means announced their intention of
paying the Downs a visit. The report spread quickly. Great was
the consternation among some of the ladies. The question of its
probability kept the gentlemen, and their preparations for a warm
reception, on the continual <i>qui vive</i>. It may have
been&mdash;I cannot tell, though not far away&mdash;the subject
of converse in a typical social circle of my friends at
Toolburrah, over pipes and brandies-and-water; Toolburrah,
garrisoned by some of our best shots and best riders in the
country around. Walter Leslie, the three brothers Leith Hay, and
some whose presence I cannot now affirm from recollection, all in
full readiness with rifles and like "weapons of precision", close
by their hands&mdash;only in the next room.</p>
<p>The ringing laugh, the joking "chaff" suddenly came to a check
at the gruff intimation from open windows and doors, "If you
move, you're dead men!" A muzzle which simultaneously covered
each convivial inmate, and an "ugly mug" behind each muzzle,
effectually stopped the way to "the next room". In most gallant
fashion Jack himself approached and introduced himself to the
astounded revellers: "Gentlemen, good evening. I hope I don't
intrude. Pray sit still, gentlemen; if you don't. I can't answer
for the whims, and I shall be unable to restrain the feelings of
the gentlemen outside who are now paying you their respects from
the verandah. Pray don't incommode yourselves. I'll sit down and
take a glass of grog, Ah! capital tack! Some of my friends will
join us by turns, and won't we just make a night of it I You see,
I've brought in your cook and servants to wait on us. I cannot
dispense with their presence under my eye; but pray don't stir
from your seats; the results, in view of the present state of
things, might be serious. Gentlemen, your good health! I've sent
a couple of men for your horses. Thank you, gentlemen, for
keeping them in the paddock; there are some good ones among them.
I've had my eye on them some time. Again, gentlemen, your good
health! I'll just take a look round at your guns in the next
room. Pray take care; don't stir I I know where they are. I'm
afraid I must borrow some of them." And so this very Jack
Sheppard's ape made himself and his friends at home. I believe
that, notwithstanding the vigilant turn-and-turn-about in keeping
up that nasty surveillance, besieged and besiegers <i>did</i>
make a night of it in all courteous fellowship. My friends at
Toolburrah had, for squatters, an exceptionally well supplied
wardrobe. Jack and his mates wanted a "rig out", and so there was
much fun in trying on drawers, fitting on boots, donning clean
shirts, and other clean garments&mdash;"only in exchange", said
Jack, for those he left behind dirty. At peep o' day, when all
being well, and freshly mounted on their hosts' horses,
shouldering their hosts' rifles, taking with them all their
hosts' ammunition and their hosts' brandy bottles, apparelled in
their hosts' garments, they took a courteous leave after a
stirrup-cup, and rode on triumphant and jubilant to&mdash;the
gallows. Their race was soon run out after this agreeable episode
in their bushranging career.</p>
<p>Talking of races brings me back to the crowning pastime of
this period. The first positive occurrence of this character that
I can call to mind came off on Cooper's Plains flat, the first
ground used for the purpose. The occasion was a match between
"Harkaway", a grey horse of Seymour's&mdash;the officer in charge
of the last detachment stationed at Brisbane&mdash;and "Jock",
Campbell's "Toby", a bay, in which the favourite&mdash;the
former&mdash;lost his laurels. Immediately after this, I think,
it was arranged that a race meeting should be held in the middle
of 1846, on the "New Farm" ground for three days' events. This
became then, in my day, the Brisbane Course, and as far as I
know, maybe so still.</p>
<p>The introduction of St. George, in 1842 (<i>see appendix</i>),
and a true-blooded Arab of high descent, by Patrick Leslie, had
begotten an entirely new element of excitement among the <i>beau
monde</i> of us northern provincials. The spirit of the sport
took possession of the people, and for this, and for years after,
it was the glad <i>reunion</i> of the community far and wide.</p>
<p>And it was an exhilarating scene that which then met the eyes
of many a lone bush-buried hermit, drawn from his cell by the
fame of the doings (misdoings) and seeings on that rough-ringed
course on "New Farm". The stamp of its old features were not
quite obliterated: the vigils kept in the past, night and day,
with musket in hand from the bifurcal boxes still "spotted" high
up the trees on the river banks often set me musing on the days
when "pot shots" were taken by the exalted sentry at any
black&mdash;may be white pilferers of the golden cobs of the rich
maize-crops which once had decked that swampy bight in the penal
period. Old things and new! "Correct cards and colours" were now
dinned upon one's acceptance for a consideration, by voices old
and young, as persistently as on grander grounds.
Gipsies&mdash;fortune tellers&mdash;thimble-rig. Aunt Sally and
the sticks had not yet found us out: their presence would have
added nothing to the pleasure.</p>
<p>What wanted we better for our heels&mdash;if not for our heads
and hearts, than the smiles coaxed from beneath the shades of
bonnets, sweetly shaped in <i>those</i> days. The gleam of a
glance from beneath no monkey-fringed eye-brows; the
gentle-voiced hope which quickened each riders' pulse; the low
whisper which soothed the beating within for victory in that
race, and for winning his spurs in <i>that</i> towards a more
coveted conquest! How full was then the squatter's cup of
youth&mdash;be the purse ever so empty! How thirsting the lips,
not to sip only that present day's draught of <i>délassement</i>,
but to drain the opiate draught that the present would not be
to-morrow a past dream! May I not re-visit some spot on which, in
years far away, I used to wander, linger, loiter: may I not
re-summon the phantom of myself sitting upon that rock; lying
beneath that tree, talking sanguine words to some old crony now
passed away; may not my fancy reflect as in a convex mirror
<i>self</i>-scenes as if enacted by some other man than I? The
very similitudes of those around myself seem to be there still;
may I not sadden because time has borne me onward, so far that I
seem to be another and yet the same. Fondly clinging to dead
affections, shadows shaped by the withering, well-nigh withered
branch above, on the bare ground beneath, because there is
sunlight above: above only!</p>
<p>Where are the cavaliers of the Logan? Where George Mocatta,
Burgoyne, Fyfe, Ned Hawkins, Raine, Kent? Where Billy Barker?
Where Compigné? Look away up stream! Where's the inimitable Co?
Colin McKenzie, ever stroking his moustache with twinkling eye at
some équivoque, which he resents as weak wit? Where his elder
brother, the Baronet, and Balfour&mdash;burly if not a Burleigh?
Where the brave Frank, and his brother Fred Bigge? With these and
many more memories must be the early spring of Queensland
indelibly verdant. Come what may, from Patrick Leslie downwards,
the names cannot die, though deep-lettered only in the tombstone
tale.</p>
<p>"I vas to ask you, sare, if you would ride 'Voltigeur' for Mr.
Frank in de hurdles, sare? His veight is too mush; he will take
de 'velters' hisself on de old horse." "Oh, yes! Douyère," said
I, in answer to dear old Bigge's French groom. "Tank you, sare!
Now I vill tell you, sare! Voltigeur can jump vell: like de
gangaroo! You do ride, I tink, some ten stone. He will carry you
like yon monkey! But, sare, I must tell you: Voltigeur do not
talk de Inglish. Ven you come to de hurdle you touch him on de
shoulder vid de vip, and cry 'hoppe-la!' in his own langage."
"Aye, aye! Douyère, I'll remember."</p>
<p>Out of the scales into Voltigeur's saddle&mdash;sweet little
horse he was! "Mind, sare!" were the last words I heard after
"off"&mdash;"mind, sare, he talk de <i>Français</i>!"</p>
<p>"Hoppe la!" shouted I, with the prescribed touch on the
shoulder, and over we went "like a gangaroo." "Hoppe-la!" at the
second; "Hop!" at the third&mdash;forgetting myself in the
heat&mdash;Voltigeur caught the top bar, and making a complete
summersault, rolled over, me under! Somewhat confused by the
"pip", the voice of Douyére brought me to my senses: "Ah sare! Ah
sare! you did call de 'Hop!' not de 'Hoppe-la!' Voltigeur did
not&mdash;<i>ne comprend pas l'Anglais!</i>" For years after I
was greeted with a hop! by my friends. This was my last lesson in
French. Ned Hawkins' last word to me, before he sailed to his
watery grave in the "Sacramento"&mdash;with gold on the
brain&mdash;was: "Good-bye, old Hop!" three years afterwards.</p>
<p>The spring of 1840 having ushered in the visiting season from
the south, which had been opened by Patrick Leslie, who had
revelled in the privilege of the <i>entrée</i> into the presence
chamber of "<i>our</i>" Queensland&mdash;Darling Downs&mdash;had
warmed up soon into the summer solstice as the throng increased.
From the ten stations occupied on the eastern side of the range,
in spots marginal to that <i>parterre</i>, in 1842, the number in
1846 had so stuffed every available acre on the waters affluent
to Moreton Bay, that stock had already been squeezed out far away
to the northward on either dissociated water shed. White faces
and their "monkeys" (what a savage misnomer for sleepy sheep)
were no surprise now to the natives in the purlieus of Wide Bay,
or the Burnett river, on the one hand, nor Peak Downs on the
other. In 1848 we know that Leichhardt rested at Macpherson's
station so far away to the westward as Mount Abundance&mdash;in
fact, my pen can keep no pace with strides which bewilder all
recollection of the progress of those years.</p>
<p>At intervals of two or three after my first occupation, I was
visited usually by a wondrous drift of the common white butterfly
from the south-west; in such myriads did they flake by my
hut-door at Cecil Plains, that it gave amusement and practice in
cutting them down as they passed with the now old-fashioned
stock-whip; and so this snow-storm would envelope me for some
days consecutively. Months afterwards from the north-east, in a
march which spread itself for miles from one edge of my plains to
the other, would creep in slow but sure assault on every green
thing which lay in its path, an equally marvellous, innumerable
host of green caterpillars; every blade of living herbage was
shaved off till the soil was bare; the rustling of their advance
was quite perceptible to the ear; the footfall of my horse
destroyed hundreds at every step; between the reaches of the
stagnant Condamine they would find their way, and such wretched
cabbages as I was able to grow in my small plot of a garden, not
even a ring of fire could protect. Such to the blacks must have
been the prospect upon the now steady onslaught of the white
man's flocks and herds: as wonderful to them, perhaps, as the
other scene ever was to me. They can get no further now. unless
to New Guinea, who can say? Will that hold Australia awhile? or
must it press to Java, the Celebes&mdash;Borneo, and join hands
with India and China, before she has quite fraternized with the
world's nations? Who can tell? Who, a hundred years hence at our
present pace, would feel surprised if she did so? Whence the
watchword&mdash;"Advance Australia?"</p>
<p>It would be a hopeless task for me to detail events generally
or locally digested under treatment which every allusion of mine
pivots on the earliest start in the intercolonial race to which
these northern districts of New South Wales committed themselves
soon after this time.</p>
<p>One with New South Wales, any pulse which disturbed the heart
affected in like manner the extremities. The great wail of the
day was "land", in all our quarters. In the pressing on of public
interests (yet what was our population!) this one question
shouldered off every other neighbour in the crush-room of
politics: in the midst of which Governor Sir George Gipps, who
had to bear the colonial heat of the day, was ever dinning into a
ready ear in Downing-street, and into deaf ears here, the shout
of "Royal Prerogative" over our lands, a doctrine which was
repelled as unfit for our people's instruction, whose faithful
mouthpiece was a Wentworth on the one side, and the champion of
whose "best interests" on the other was Tribune Lang.</p>
<p>The tale of the trials and triumph (awhile) of the squatting
tribe of which Wentworth was political patriarch, may be said to
have found its first material during the years of Sir George
Gipps' administration, who suddenly&mdash;and I say so
advisedly&mdash;seemed to think that he had been commissioned to
check the growth of the "hydra", which had begun to develop
features of many-headed dissension and discussion, by which the
natural hue of Australia's native claims were imperially
obscured.</p>
<p>Land! upset price! limitation to purchase! occupation beyond
location! limits of location! Every aspect of the land question
had towards the latter part of his arbitrary chieftainship,
lilliputianised every other consideration of the colony's
well-doing. During the period of the greatest expansive force,
which the pastoral pursuits had heated into action, Sir George
Gipps laboured hard to restrain and cribb them. Notwithstanding
all his efforts the squatters had gone on confident that they had
justice and common sense on their side. The last blow that he was
able to aim at the system was through stern adherence to his
policy, with regard to the occupation of crown lands beyond what
were then termed the limits of location. The squatters,
nevertheless, worked on unheeding. These pastoral
adventurers&mdash;the real pioneers of the country at
large&mdash;whose interests grew with their stock, and
necessities with each drought, compelled to search out untrodden
feed, in the search for which, danger, loss, hardship of all
phases were to be encountered, had all through the disheartening
period of Sir George Gipps' administration to contend also with
the burden of debt inevitable to bank or firm, who, having
themselves at times to succumb to the pressure of the oft
panic-stricken times, yet looked for relief to the one paramount
<i>panacea</i>&mdash;wool; the producers of which they held in
bonds. Truly the squatting family began to believe that every
man's hand, not bush-branded and embrowned, was turned against
them in hatred and malice unaccountable.&mdash;</p>
<p>Having little or no voice in the far-away counsels by which we
were ruled, individual wants formed a large aggregate of
complaints throughout the Northern District. They were the
sharpest spur to combined exertion. At the head of each
squatter's wants was that of labour: a want to supply which was
the general exercise of squatters' fretful tempers. Devices set
forth with a view to remedying such a grievance at once raised
antagonistic outcries which sprung up on all sides when as little
looked for as the Bathurst burr. I am able yet to recall some
occasions on which fruitless attempts were made to obtain some
consensus in the treatment of this sore which was eating up every
energy of the wool-grower. The year 1839 had cancelled the
covenant of the assignment system: the sources of transported
labour had now dried up: emigration had been a hope even in the
north&mdash;but interrupted, deferred, and unsound, had sickened
the hopeful. Guachos from the Pampas: Coolies from India:
Cingalese, had their advertisers and advocates. But the British
workman must be no competitor with coloured, foreign, and alien
races: the attempt to get work done in the bush at reasonable but
ample wages by men of so low a grade in the citizenship of the
world was offensive to the liberal landlords who inveighed
against class exclusiveness and swore by universal <i>egalité,
fraternité, liberté</i>! Men for work liked town life: so men of
town had enough of men of work.</p>
<p>The squatters shall have our own countrymen&mdash;and no
other&mdash;was the "Liberal" shout. Friell's experiment of
Indian labour in 1847 (on my brother's and Glover's old station
Burrandowan) was a solitary and only temporary success for
himself: and that culminated, when brought to a general proposal
at a meeting at the Caledonian Hotel, in North Brisbane, in
January, 1848, in but a spasmodic effort to extend such an
introduction, as another had done in February of the preceding
year at the Queen's Arms at Ipswich. And again, long before that,
in June, 1846, at a meeting at which our devotee, Patrick Leslie,
sat in the chair, while Arthur Hodgson brought forward a
resolution relative to the importation of one hundred and fifty
men from Van Dieman's Land through the proffered agency of J.P.
Robinson of Sydney, for which the squatters, alas! themselves
were called to subscribe the expenses&mdash;a call to which they
poorly answered because they couldn't.</p>
<p>It was not until the middle and end of 1848 that ships direct
from London to Brisbane arrived&mdash;one, the "Columbine", with
sixty; the other, the "Artemisia", with two hundred and fifty-one
emigrants.</p>
<p>The first Legislative Assembly in which the representative
colouring was admitted was convoked in 1843.</p>
<p>The Moreton Bay electoral district was at that time embraced
by that of Port Macquarie, and, through the late Colonial
Secretary (Alexander Macleay) the requirements of the whole had
to be set forth and pleaded. The next was Colonel Snodgrass, who
did us the honour of contesting the same seat with Archibald
Boyd, of Beardy Plains. Gentle indeed was the voice which could
be raised on the part of a seaboard of some three hundred miles
at that time! Less the effort to make it heard.</p>
<p>The strength of the electoral district of Moreton, County of
Stanley, and town of Brisbane, for 1846, was exhausted by
fifty-seven votes! In 1849 Brisbane's alone was that of ninety!
Not till 1851 did Moreton Bay return her one member. Not till
1853, <i>two</i>. The leap of ten
years&mdash;1848-1858&mdash;cleared nine representatives of the
North Territory; hitherto, under the general name of Moreton Bay.
The next was no leap in the dark; 'twas out of darkness into the
light of Separation!</p>
<p>But our political pilgrimage can be certified better by
authentic sources than this simple monogram.</p>
<p>With my own Darling Downs' life and its attachments, it chimes
in more merrily, and regretfully, to clasp into the rest of my
time, the social and local memoranda of the period which
predetermined the "Nativity of Queensland".</p>
<p>I must ask to be forgiven at the present day if I yet cling to
the oasis in which I rested the two or three years which preceded
my going back again to the old home. Of course I watched the
occupation of the Burrandowan waters. Glover and my brother had
gone and were almost forgotten, but by myself. Burrandowan was in
other hands&mdash;Living's or Friell's; and in 1846 those jolly
brothers Haly, and then Cardew, and others had settled down upon
the Stuart (I did not give it that name). In the same year did I
meet in Sydney Sir Evan Mackenzie, one of our first squatters,
who had been laying a foundation stone for some new school in
Sydney in connection with St. Andrew's Scot's Church. And on my
return thence did I find my esteemed old acquaintance Burnett,
just come back from Wide Bay-wards, having rescued from the
blacks a cast-away Tahitian who called himself George Moir. The
"Tamar", with cheery old Captain Allen, had just before brought
up forty working men, who disappeared in high glee as soon as
they had landed; and I heard at the same time of the murder of
two men on the Tweed, and the worrying of the Logan cattle by the
blacks. Poor old Hexton, too! swearing that he should be washed
away some night from Amity Point pilot-station by the ever
encroaching tides. And before getting away down came on me the
hammer of evil news that Andrew&mdash;brother of our reverend
incumbent of St. John's&mdash;Gregor had been killed by the
natives on his Pine river station, and others with him there: two
men also at Coutts' having about the same time met the same fate:
the catalogue of the year's bush horrors being wound up by the
treacherous murder by like hands of John Uhr. Such a damning
record could not be washed out by the persistent pour of rains,
which seemed to threaten a repetition of the deluge of 1841.</p>
<p>Broke in upon us then the failure of the Facing Island farce
as a memory of 1847, relieved, however, shortly after by
Burnett's published account of his successful whaleboat search
for the mouth of the Boyne, and satisfactory examination of the
Wide Bay district waters from seawards. Landwards, too, Archibald
Campbell and John Cameron had found and occupied fine country
more than two hundred miles to the westward; and coastwards the
"bunkum" between Cleveland and Brisbane renewed a vigorous
pen-and-ink campaign. On the Downs the "Springs", which I could
never find, became the sweet village of Drayton, in which swung
the profile of a "Bull's Head", supposed to be a correct likeness
of "Champion", once on Cecil Plains, which enticed many a hungry
and thirsty wayfarer to stop for refreshment at the inn kept by
my old bush associate, William Orton, about a year later on, in
competition with the "advertisement" immediately on the other
side of the road lower down the bank of the "Springs"
watercourse&mdash;in which I never saw water&mdash;of "good
accommodation and stabling for horse and man," by Stephen Mehan!
As an extinguisher for the last flicker of the pet ministerial
scheme which gave Colonel Barney and his suite so much
unprofitable leisure at Port Curtis, the closing year capped one
of a similar fashion. Dr. Lang's proposal of a cotton colony to
supersede and swamp the wool and the so-called squatters'
monopoly of the resources of the Australian soil. With the
proposal was raised a cry for a township on the river Mary, and a
severe dig in the ribs for the Sydney folks was inflicted by the
heels of Earl Grey, which touched up the general sensitiveness
about a proposed separation of Port Phillip. Moreton Bay was now
honoured by the presence of a harbour-master&mdash;and a very
efficient officer and good fellow he was&mdash;of the name of
Freeman. His first notable act was to save my poor old friend
Pilot Hexton from what is popularly termed a "watery grave",
almost at the same time that a brother squatter of the name of
Scott escaped a grave less delectable even than that of Jonah of
old by finding a refuge from the hands and appetites of the
blacks of the "Monoboola" in the cabin of that nondescript but
domestic type of the Brisbane marine service the well-remembered
ketch "Aurora". She was well named; daylight could be seen
through her when I made her acquaintance first.</p>
<p>The public meeting held in November, 1847, to consider
Friell's Coolie experiment, resulted in the proposal for another
to be held in the following February. Sufficiency of labour, at
any reasonable rates, for the wants of the district appearing to
be hopeless. This assembled at the "Caledonia", North Brisbane.
as suggested, but it came to little or nothing in earnest. Labour
offered no resource, under the burden of our need, to be turned
to nor returned to as the "Orwell" tea had done years before;
when such a man for tea was intoned through our tenancies. The
Chinese war of 1838 had been drawing to a close: hideous and
vengeful accounts had got wind of the Celestial conspiracy for
extinguishing the "Barbarians" by poisoning wells at home, and
exports for consumption abroad. In 1841-2, the ship "Orwell",
from China, had come into Port Jackson with an immense cargo of
tea (green only, in those times), chests in scores found their
way through the land, and supplies waning on all far stations
were replenished. Well I remember the opening of the first at
Cecil Plains! Filthy was the smell of paint, filthier its taste;
chest after chest similarly <i>degôutant</i>. "Can't put up with
the coves' rations!" was the general shout; demand for settlement
of wages summary:&mdash;made and met. Each station in ignorance
that the <i>cordon de san-té</i>, which encircled the storm of
the tea-pot&mdash;embraced its neighbour also&mdash;almost
deserted and helpless. "Why, Russell, why come here to look for
men? ours have all bolted: its all the tea! that
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; tea!" Farther and farther each would ride
in wild fashion, picking up way-farers in like quest; passing
squads of men with "swag' on shoulder, jeering as we ride on,
"don't 'ee think we'll drink your &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; tea!"
From place to place the cry was re-echoed. Not many days,
however, ere amazement, bewilderment, and the voice of "jeering"
joined in the burden of a howl: "we're all poisoned by those
Chinese villains!" Men <i>could</i> not live without their
quart-pot of tea and their 'bacca. Neighbours meeting would watch
each other in dread expectancy of seeing some fatal symptoms in
each other's features. The wretched traveller would be assailed:
"Have any died yet on the next station?" as he parsed on. But,
day by day, the "painted" tea was moaned over, anathematised and
swallowed; the surf went down, a calm ensued; no bodies to bury,
no tale to unfold.</p>
<p>The same squads of tea-travailing turn-coats dribbling in one
by one to their old quarters would beg for fresh agreements, get
them, and then pack away the perfume of the Pekoe without
imprecation nor panic. The run in a ring round Downs and
districts; men after fresh masters, masters after fresh men, made
up the total of a tea fight which ended for each where it had
begun. The following year's supply was above suspicion: the
beauty of tea <i>without</i> paint had lost its charms: habit had
reconciled and then assumed the sway: taste had
de&mdash;te&mdash;riorated: another tea tour threatened at once
the tapis, but stopped at the first stir: so capriciously can
"use almost change the stamp of nature."</p>
<p>But there was no resource nor relief in the race for labour
now. There was no possible return to the old source from which
the demand claimed a supply as of yore; there was no running in
the pursuit which could make both ends meet again. Transportation
and prison-labour were at an end. It is not surprising that after
every subtle suggestion in the furtherance of an introduction of
coloured labour had failed, the squatters, in desperation, whose
success was of paramount importance to the whole country, turned
gradually with half-averted countenances to some plan for
re-opening the old polluted springs whereby such growing
interests might be preserved from the drought, then wasting
industries which could only be energised by the sweat of man's
brow. The people's taste nauseated at the suspicion of such
renewal of the good old times, or the least modification of the
old system. 'No use could change the stamp of the country's
determination. An effort was made&mdash;but not yet. In 1849,
whatever the effort&mdash;hope of succeeding in the proposal was
dead and buried. Nevertheless, occasion was ingeniously handled:
the thimble-rig of expediency was deftly thumbed&mdash;soon
after&mdash;as I shall endeavour to show&mdash;when the finger
was raised to beckon deliverance from apron-strings, and the
privilege to handle reins with which Queensland eventually
<i>jehued</i> herself to the grand field of free paces over the
intercolonial race-course.</p>
<p>Pre-separation annals yet scored up many occurrences of no
mean stamp: one of which opened the door of 1848 to the brave and
since lamented Kennedy and his exploring companions. The thirst,
in a more limited sense, for better knowledge of the country, far
off as well as near, kept pace with the hunger for fresh
pasturage, waiting watchfully for the multiplying sheep; with the
greed for speculation in towns, and with the exercise of wits
keen in unriddling the promise of future progress. One of our
oldest residents, Warner, had his specialty in the Surveying
Department authoritatively stamped upon the parcelling out of the
immediate Moreton Bay platform: Burnett, another old compatriot
in the same service had his on the more distant environing
pastoral areas. Poor Burnett! it was this setting forth into the
rough work west and north that sowed the seeds of that wasting
rheumatism which in a few years more brought him to my
neighbourhood, Kangaroo Point, to die on the banks of the
Brisbane river.</p>
<p>How persistently will death at times run with violence through
the groove of a family following! The first minister of religion
of any denomination that I had seen on the Condamine was he who
was at this season incumbent tor the Church of England at St.
John's, at Brisbane&mdash;the Rev. John Gregor. He had, If I
recollect aright, been in the Scottish days at home, preceptor
through the early years of Patrick Leslie's puerile pranks and
propensities; and in the blaze of boyhood, perhaps, perversities.
He may, for aught I know, have followed his old pupil, and the
passages of his old pupil's exploring prowess, with pardonable
pride; and been content to span his years with the bridge of
attachment from the horizon of the one hemisphere to the other.
But he and his brother Andrew compassed not the natural end of
their lives' engagements. The strong band which thrust each into
a grave brought itself down suddenly and sullenly. The savage
yell of the black murderer was, perhaps, the last sound in the
ears of the one; as the screeching suck of the stifling waters in
the ears of the other. John Gregor was found drowned at the
German mission station, near Brisbane.</p>
<p>These deaths recurred to me years afterwards. A noble frigate,
the "Orpheus", was lying at anchor in the bay, opposite my house,
about two miles away. Her commander&mdash;Commodore
Burnett&mdash;was coming to have luncheon with me on the day on
which he was to leave for New Zealand. "In past years, Commodore,
I was acquainted with a brother of yours out here; he always went
by the name of 'Jemmy' Burnett; everyone liked him; poor fellow!
he was drowned in trying to cross one of our rivers." "Yes," said
the Commodore, "he was; we in our family were four brothers; my
other two were also drowned; I only remain."</p>
<p>The day passed so pleasantly that the story of same-sadness
had worn off, and blithely did I say good-bye, "hoping to hear
from you, Commodore, when you get to New Zealand." "Aye I aye!
that you shall," he shouted, as the gig pulled off. I watched the
fine new ship as she got away, with unconscious interest. I never
saw her again; nor the Commodore. That powerful shapely fabric
broke up like glass on the Manukau Bar, and all perished, save a
few&mdash;<i>who afterwards went down in the "London</i>."</p>
<p>I knew of no disquietude to the even tenor of bush life so
intolerable as that of saying good-bye to old friends going home.
Every occurrence of this kind tangled the fibre of one's bush
system more than any real mishap. I cannot cast off reflection
upon the most trying occasion of this character in the earlier
part of 1848.</p>
<p>Caparisoned in the joyous garb of hard-earned success, down on
me at Cecil Downs, one unheeded afternoon, swooped a throng of
merry cavaliers of the olden (Darling Downs) time. Arthur
Hodgson:&mdash;shall I name more? No! re-gathering now the faces
of that familiar group the review dwells on features of dust. All
but he have passed on. Laden with convivial elements which
symbolised the good-fellowship of the stirrup-cup of parting,
these, my then friends, about to leave, had come, in all
kindness, to say good-bye!</p>
<p>To the squatter within the loneliness of his own marked trees
the good-bye of members of his order "home-ward bound" was in all
truth, a concealed but deep distress; if so, to me, was I a
foolish exception? The verandah of the thinker left behind with
seats of friendship, hitherto always filled by some of the
brotherhood at the Yule-tide&mdash;to be henceforth empty! The
cry which came with these happy fugitives, as it were, from his
own dear ones, "Come back to us!" borrowed sound and substance in
the presences of this glad gang of old cronies, happy! oh! how
happy in the gaze upon a change to that dear old "Homespot",
which in them, as in me, spiritualises the love of native land,
as it does that of those who are awaiting at home wanderers whose
instinct for "Home" they know out of the secret of their
blood-knit hearts. Yet when the cry was answered but the shadow
of home! These breakings up of the attachments brought the truth
home more than one cares to talk about.</p>
<p>Time drives us on with our surroundings, and stows away in
each man's wallet of memory many a valued morsel dropped by each
year, on its track. Helpful and hopeful was it to pick up the
news that there was a higher standard to be raised for the
serious thought of life among our people in 1848's March. The
name which I shall never speak, but with reverence and respect,
was presented to us in the Ministry of the Church: that of one
who bore ever since the burden patiently and worthily: the
service of which the "yoke is easy." I mean that of Benjamin
Glennie. He was not one who would say in clerical "parlance" I
will do it, <i>D. V</i>., as a <i>farçon de parler</i>. I never
met a man in whom submission to those conventional letters, in
faithfulness and simplicity, was more truthfully manifest. If he
were yet alive, I could bring back to him from Drayton, in 1853,
the grounds on which I built my conviction. How deep a good man's
syllables sink into the mud of mere sense! Thirty-four years ago!
yet but as yesterday.</p>
<p>Murders by blacks this year&mdash;notably one at David
Perrier's&mdash;were all, I think eclipsed by a foul deed at
Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. There had been a man of the name of Cox
in an inn called "Sutton's". He was missed one day, and a
headless body and limbs were found on the bank of the river.
Shortly after the head was picked up out of a brick "tumulus"
called "Campbell's Folly". (Colin Campbell, of Glengallan, had
begun but never completed the edifice.) A man&mdash;then cook. I
think, at "Sutton's"&mdash;was charged with the crime, tried,
convicted, and hung, in spite of loud protestation of innocence.
Some years afterwards another, in the horror of a death-bed
upbraiding, confessed that he had been the guilty one, and had
looked on at the execution of his innocent <i>locum tenens</i>!
Let his name perish!</p>
<p>In April of this my last whole year&mdash;1848&mdash;on
Darling Downs, the entertaining but dilatory Commissioner of
Crown Lands for New England made way for one whose name in the
same position at Armidale, and whose brother's name afterwards at
Brisbane as police magistrate, were and are yet held high in
public as well as in private regard. About my first meeting with
the latter some years before, there was to me a material
gratification beyond the pleasure of making an acquaintance then
which I have since learnt so much to value. Hamon Massie let me
buy a horse from him, which, when I looked at, I had little hope
of his consenting to part with. "Rodney" was the best animal I
ever rode or drove in Australia. The way in which he stood by me
in my need in some sorely unpleasant scrapes in the bush made me
often eternally grateful to the name of his former master. In
after days, however, long after this period, "Rodney", I found,
had never outpaced the kindly feelings which two such
brothers&mdash;men of the old English squirearchy stamp&mdash;won
from one who had learnt to appreciate them for what they, in
sooth, were. George Macdonald disappeared as commissioner in the
Lower Darling District.</p>
<p>The Monoboola had been just now gazetted the river Mary, in
memory of Lady Mary Fitzroy. Many old friends' names were being
reproduced on stations pressing on north. Ferriter and Uhr,
Hawkins, Lawless, Humphries and Herbert, Mort. McTaggart, Scott,
Ross, and a legion of others about the water, of the Burnett or
Wide Bay. Ah! then the recurrence of the May meeting on the New
Farm Racecourse! Baronet and Dermott McFigg pitted against each
other by their respective owners, Mackenzie and Bigge, in a
private match for £100. Riding Dermott&mdash;by
request&mdash;<i>I</i> did <i>not</i> win! alas! great the
rejoicing over "Baronet"! "Creeping Jenny", "Molly Bawn",
"Meerza", "Sir William", "Sir Harry" can't even now be separated
from their several owners&mdash;Patrick Leslie, O'Grady Haly,
George Burgoyne. Drayton followed suit the following July on the
course over Westbrook Plain. Here our commissioner Rolleston's
"Yarico" beat seven others for the Hack Stakes. What a shout went
up! And these were followed by a galloping visit to Moreton Bay
by the Bishop of Newcastle&mdash;Dr. Tyrrell&mdash;our first
episcopal stirring up, not before church and school matters
required it. The Bishop rode hard: of course every one lent him a
horse when required. I did so at Cecil Plains, and when it was
brought back in a day or two I saw that his Lordship had been
very accurate when he assured me in the way of warning "that he
used his own spurs."</p>
<p>Much was made and said of the Moreton Bay exports during the
year from June, 1847, to June of this year. The sheep were about
six hundred and ninety-nine thousand, cattle over forty-eight
thousand, horses more than two thousand. Business men sorely felt
the want of a bank. This half-year's exports were valued at about
£60,000.</p>
<p>The journal of Sir Thomas Mitchell's expedition in search of a
route from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria was in August
supplied to our inquisitive appetites, too late after satiation
by Leichhardt's diet; but it signalled the return of the
Surveyor-General again from England, by the "Countess of
Yarborough", recently. Locally the launch of the "Eagle"
steamer&mdash;wooden&mdash;built by and supplied to the
acquisitive desires of the Moreton Bay trade, by Chowne, of
Johnston's Bay, Sydney, for the Hunter's River Steam Navigation
Company, created a sensation and raised expectation! The military
barracks converted into an immigration depot, much more. The
little "Raven", however, had outstripped the "Eagle's" first
flight, for she was already active in her passages between
Ipswich and Brisbane, carrying wool in desperation; for wool was,
alas! very low at this wretched time. For what purpose the
"Tamar", as we neared the end of the year, brought up D.A.C.G.
Walker Cameron, and thirty-live of his 11th Regiment men, I
cannot and never could tell. They were more intelligibly followed
by some sixty Chinese in the ship "Nimrod". Dull and dismal was
the end of 1848, when it made room for the January, which with
its rumours of the golden wonders of the Californian diggings at
once began to drive men mad, and dissatisfied with everything
Australian. Another good-bye to next neighbours and old friends,
the Tummavil family of Rolland, "Home" directly by the
"Cheapside", broke up the old social ring on Darling Downs, and
clinched my decision for a change too. The sense of loneliness
became oppressive. I was in another Wide Bay fog.</p>
<p>February of 1849 was notable by reason of the arrival of Dr.
Lang's emigrants, who, in thankfulness to the ship which brought
them, surnamed the pretty spot on which, after some little
trouble, they managed to settle themselves, "Fortitude Valley". A
mishap, almost coincident with this event, to the brother of my
early Sydney acquaintance, Bob Graham, of the firm of Graham and
Montefiore, stamped the time on my recollection. The "Tamar" was
lying in the river; Charles Graham pulled alongside and went
aboard, leaving in his boat a box containing some £400 (a larger
sum then than it is thought now), and when he came back the
boat&mdash;it was bare! The box's contents were never traced: the
box was, a long time afterwards. On her return from Sydney after
this occurrence, the "Tamar" brought up the whole family (some
members of which had lately come from England) of my neighbours
at Clifton on Darling Downs, at the head of which was, for her
first visit to the north, the widow of our first Australian Chief
Justice, the highly-gifted Sir Francis Forbes. In the month
following&mdash;March&mdash;Sydney showed herself resolute in her
refusal to receive more convicts into her territory, and one
whose name must be yet green in Queensland, the Rev. Stewart,
came to the front of his fellow-passengers in the "Fortitude" as
an able minister devoted to the Presbyterian Church. Moreton Bay
had become a warehousing port for the bonding of all dutiable
goods; but all encouraging memoranda of "advance" were much
clouded by the terrible drought, in Darling Downs especially.
Pushing on to Wide Bay apace, the schooner "Vixen", of forty-five
tons! was positively crammed with more than a score of
passengers, and Brisbane and Cleveland began to form a ring for
their wonted annual prize-fight for supremacy as the champion
shipping port and anchorage. Brisbane got the best of it, and so
in the middle of this year she at length decided upon a site for
a custom-house on the river. It must have been about May, just
before, I think, that Edward Moriarty and Bagot came up and added
supreme strength to the surveying and engineering requirements of
the district, for I fancy I found them not long afterwards camped
together on the Downs side of the main range, but I do not
remember what their special work at the time was.</p>
<p>Rumours about the aspect of our labour difficulty had for some
time floated about, and in July we heard that that admirable
keen-witted member of the Legislative Council, "Bob" Nicholls had
asked "whether Government had received any communication from
England as to an intention to forward convicts to Moreton Bay?"
Reply from the Colonial Secretary: "None!" But of this, more
by-and-by.</p>
<p>Just at this time, Charles Gray, master of that remarkable
ketch "Aurora"&mdash;Scott's ark of refuge on the Wide Bay Coast
some time ago&mdash;was murdered by the blacks at Bribie's
Island. On my return shortly afterwards to Brisbane, I became
acquainted with the Revs. Robert Creyke (formerly, I think,
rector of Edlington in Yorkshire) and W. Bodenham, for whom work
was clerically found by the Church of England. Both these
clergymen had come to Brisbane in search of health. The new
colonial wooden built steamer "Eagle" made her maiden trip from
Sydney on the 28th July, and on her return from Moreton Bay, I
went ashore at the old "'Flour' Company's Wharf" in Sydney, on
the 6th of August, 1849.</p>
<p>My bush&mdash;not my Australian existence&mdash;had come to an
end. I have seen neither Condamine, nor Cecil Plains, nor sheep,
nor ox of mine since. By the "Ph&oelig;nician", on the 23rd
January of the following year (1850), I was the only male cabin
passenger to England.</p>
<p>On my return, in January of 1851, I lived at a house which I
completed and called "Shafston", at Kangaroo Point, on the banks
of the Brisbane, opposite the old cottage of "New Farm".</p>
<p>The only topic&mdash;but that was the engrossing topic of the
day&mdash;on which I shall venture to say a few words more is
"Separation of Queensland" from New South Wales, which, as soon
as I knew it to be <i>un fait accompli</i> in the designs of the
authorities in London, I preceded in such assurance (for I had
again made a trip 'Home' in 1855) in 1859, at the end of which it
was declared.</p>
<p>And so my story's done!</p>

<div class="indent3">With other eyes, too, could I now look upon
my fellow-man; with an infinite love, an infinite pity. Poor,
wandering, wayward man! Art thou not tried, and beaten with
stripes, even as I am? Ever, whether thou bear the royal mantle

heavy-laden; and thy bed of rest is but a grave.</div>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Having</span> begun this small chronicle of
pre-Queenslandiana with the name of the first, it would be
inexcusably defective if it did not end with the name of the last
official explorer of the north land&mdash;Allan
Cunningham&mdash;Edmund Kennedy. However notable his life had
been and promised to be, far more conspicuous was Edmund
Kennedy's death.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"More are men's ends marked than
their lives before."</p>
<p>Edmund B. Kennedy, Assistant Surveyor, had returned, at the
end of 1847, from conducting an expedition to ascertain the
course of the "Victoria", the river so named by Surveyor-General
Sir Thomas Mitchell, and presumed to run into the Gull of
Carpentaria. Kennedy identified it with Sturt's Cooper's creek.
His despatch detailing the particulars of his journey may be
found in the New South Wales <i>Government Gazette</i>, of
Monday, the 24th January, 1848.</p>
<p>He had little rest. In the barque "Tarn
O'Shanter"&mdash;Captain Merionberg&mdash;he sailed from Sydney
on the 29th of April, 1848. H.M.S. "Rattlesnake"&mdash;Captain
Owen Stanley&mdash;accompanied her. His associates in the work
were William Carron&mdash;botanist&mdash;and Thomas
Wall&mdash;naturalist. On the working strength of the party were
C. Niblett (storekeeper, who betrayed his trust), James Duff,
Edward Taylor, William Costigan, Edward Carpenter, William
Goddard, Thomas Mitchell, John Douglas, Dennis Dunn, and Jacky,
an aboriginal of Patrick's Plains, on the Hunter: thirteen all
told, of whom, only two, Carron and Goddard, survived to tell
their pitiable tale, besides that black diamond Jacky, by whose
brave fidelity even these two were rescued.</p>
<p>The object of the expedition was to explore the country lying
between Rockingham Bay and Cape York.</p>
<p>By any one who had ever attempted travelling on a line
parallel with and but little removed from our eastern board the
difficulties of such a journey would have, I think, been weighed
with more caution and better judgment than seem to have prevailed
in the counsels of those who gave instructions for such a crawl
over nine degrees of our coast country. On a more limited scale,
the energetic Logan would attempt it only on foot, and even on
foot could not always surmount obstructions. Abrupt, precipitous
gullies: banks of torrent-channels, not only walls on either side
but almost invariably imprisoned within belts of dark tangled
scrub, impenetrable without the aid of tomahawk or axe; depth of
streams so near <i>debouchûre</i>: notoriously swampy and rotten
conditions of most land marginal to the salt water and within its
tides: ranges or broken ridges rarely clear of their dismal
clothing of pine or other brush: the well-known excessive
hostility, treachery and bloodthirstiness of the sea-shore
tribes, even in contrast to like propensities among the inland or
up-river natives might surely have claimed extraordinary
provision against such obstacles to success and undue risk to the
explorers. Surely a course removed but a hundred miles or even
fifty back from such known natural difficulties could have
better&mdash;at least equally well&mdash;have answered the
desired purpose: examined the system of drainage and mapped out
the intervening land.</p>
<p>Again, it was no new information that coast grass, however
green and pleasant to the eye, never fattens nor even sustains
sheep, horses, nor cattle, whether travelling or not. Was any
thought given to the necessity of crossing with such a following
tidal streams so frequent in stopping the way, their banks, if
approachable at all, unsound and treacherous, irrespective of
depth and width? Wheels, too, for such an undertaking&mdash;over
five hundred miles or more! No wonder they were soon left behind!
These are not after-thoughts. The realities of such a coastal
course even in 1848 were no conjectures; they were the
characteristics of the whole then known seaboard. In the bush. I
well recollect the chances of Kennedy's prevailing over them
being discussed with many doubts.</p>
<p>I have before me a pamphlet, now perhaps out of print, written
by one; of the two survivors (William Carron), who so bravely and
nobly bore himself and his companions through the harrowing
scenes which he describes with little mention of himself however.
The kind courtesy of Mrs. Carron supplied me with it.</p>
<p>It contains, in addition to this journal, the statements made
by Jacky, and others who took part under his guidance in
recovering the two who were spared, and the relics of Kennedy's
papers. His bones were never found.</p>
<p>An early shadow seems to have fallen upon the venture. "A
tedious passage of twenty-two days" before they arrived at
Rockingham Bay. "Even here, at the very starting point of our
journey, those unforseen difficulties began to arise which led us
subsequently to hardships so great and calamities so fatal."</p>
<p>Out of twenty-eight horses, one was lost on the passage; out
of a hundred sheep, eleven. One more horse drowned in landing
here, after their unavoidable swim ashore of a quarter-of-a-mile.
They had three carts. Two miles brought them to a river one
hundred and fifty yards wide, which fended them off by mangrove
swamps, and then thick brush. The "Rattlesnake" boats here helped
them.</p>
<p>From June 5, struggling and straining through swamps; wading
or swimming, clearing way through scrub or running miles up and
down to find crossing places; rain in torrents; axles breaking
brought the carts, at length, to their last standstill on July
17th.</p>
<p>Tomahawking scrub after scrub for a passage, skirting creek
after creek, which ran "in all directions," with banks so steep
as to "present another obstacle to the progress of our horses,"
brought them, Sunday after Sunday, a day of rest which was
observed in Christian fashion. Soon another "impediment"
bewildered them, even the blocks of granite clustered together on
the beds of crossing places, which "rendered it very difficult
for our horses to pass. One of them fell from a ledge of hard
rock at the edge of a river, nearly thirty feet," and, of course,
died. On the 29th July "the horses began to look very poor and
weak, and although they had always had <i>plenty of grass</i>."
On the 31st July they had "begun clearing up a mountain," in
which work Kennedy "spoke very highly of Jacky." And so it went
on, day after day, "but made very little progress, owing to the
great labour of clearing and the number of steep ascents we met
with"; rain, rain, rain, keeping company with them.</p>
<p>"August 10. This morning we took the sheep and horses to a
spot in the river where the current was not so strong and drove
them across. We then cut down three small, straight trees, and
made a bridge across a deep channel which ran between two rocks
which projected out of the water, across which we carried our
stores on our backs. The position of our camp here was about 17
deg. 48 min. S. latitude, 145 deg. 20 min. E. longitude." Here
Kennedy, having discovered the storekeeper's breach of trust,
made over charge of the remaining stores to Carron.</p>
<p>"15th August. Cutting through scrub all day, and crossed
several small creeks. The horse carrying my specimens had become
so poor and weak, that he fell five different times; so many
became 'poor and weak' and fell so often, that we now made up our
minds for the first time to make our horses, 'when too weak to
travel, available for food"&mdash;and they soon found an appetite
for such beef. "On. the 17th, the weak state of our horses
prevented us making almost any progress. 19th. A horse died,"
which they did <i>not</i> eat. 28th. Another horse fell, and was
fed upon. 29th. Another. "30th and 31st. The country was very
mountainous, and so full of deep gullies, that we were frequently
obliged to follow the course of a rocky creek, the turnings of
which were very intricate." (Who does not compare, if he know
either, the old Crawney road from Aberdeen to the Page, or the
old Bulga track from Maitland to Sydney, with this description of
coast country?) "To add to our difficulties many of the hills
were covered with scrub so thickly that it was with much
difficulty that we could pursue our course through it. We had
intended to keep along the bank of the river, thinking it might
lead us to Princess Charlotte's Bay. Sept. 4 and 5. The country
much the same, making travelling most difficult and laborious. We
were now in the vicinity of Cape Tribulation. 6th. We now found
the river beginning to run in all directions through the hills,
over which it was impossible to travel. We were consequently
forced to keep the bed of the river, our horses falling every few
minutes in consequence of the slippery surface.</p>
<p>September 23. They fell in with "a great many trees of
moderate size, about fifteen to twenty feet high, of rather
pendulous habit, loaded with an oblong, yellow fruit, having a
rough stone inside. The part covering the stem has, when ripe, a
meally appearance and a very good flavour. I considered, from its
appearance, it was the fruit which Leichhardt called 'Nonda',
which we afterwards called it. We all ate plentifully of it."</p>
<p>In the middle of September, the repeated thefts by some one of
the party were detected, and alarm as to the
consequences&mdash;before arrival at Cape York, where a vessel
was to meet them&mdash;was intelligible. Either <i>Kennedy,
Carron</i> or <i>Wall</i> had "to watch" the stores "by day and
night", and even "the food whilst cooking," much of which was
supplied by the death of their wretched horses!</p>
<p>"October 3. Kennedy found that it was even necessary to have
the horse-flesh watched while drying, finding that two or three
of the party had secreted small quantities amongst their clothes;
such precautions were quite necessary, as well in justice to the
whole of the party, as to keep up the strength of all, which
<i>seemed to be fast declining</i>. At night we made a fire to
smoke the meat; and to <em>destroy the maggots</em>. All we got
from the horse we last killed was sixty-five lbs. of meat.</p>
<p>"October 9. Came to a river running into Princess Charlotte's
Bay, in latitude S. 14 deg. 30 min., longitude E. 143 deg. 56
min. Crossed it about twelve miles from the sea. 13th Kennedy
abandoned the thought of going to the beach, as he felt sure
H.M.S. 'Bramble', which was to have met us at the beginning of
August would have gone, our journey having occupied so much
longer time than we could possibly have anticipated. 16th.
Another horse to be eaten. We left one of our round tents and
such other things as we could possibly spare behind us, as our
horses were now so weak they could not carry their loads. 19th.
Several of our horses were now quite unable to carry anything but
the saddle. 21st. Killed another, too weak to stand. The health
and hearts of many began now to fail them. Three could not walk.
November 1st. Killed another horse, too weak. 5th. Another. 6th.
Two more, and packed the meat in the hide of one." And so, men
and horses, well nigh helpless, Kennedy resolved to push on for
assistance to Cape York, with Jacky, Costigan, Luff and Dunn,
leaving the rest of his companions as near Weymouth Bay as
possible. "November 11. After we had camped we killed our last
sheep. We had but nine horses left. One of our dogs killed a
young dog belonging to the natives during the night, which I
afterwards ascertained was eaten by Dunn, Luff, Costigan and
Goddard.</p>
<p>"November 13th." From this date the journal was written and
"preserved in full" to that of rescue, 30th December. "This
morning everything was prepared for the departure of Kennedy and
his party, and the <i>last of our mutton was served out</i>.
Kennedy gave me written instructions how to act during our stay
at Weymouth Bay, it being his intention to send for us by water
if possible, as he expected to meet H.M.S. 'Bramble' at Port
Albany. He calculated that he should be from ten to fifteen days
before he reached that place, and directed me to keep a sharp
look out from the hill for a vessel, and, if I should see one, to
hoist a flag on the hill. If the natives were friendly I was to
put a ball beneath the flag, and above it should they be hostile.
In the evening I was to fire three rockets, at intervals of about
twenty minutes. The party left in my charge were eight in number.
The provisions consisted of two horses and twenty-eight pounds of
flour. The whole party left at the camp were very weak. Luff
being the weakest man that proceeded to Cape York. Before
leaving, Kennedy told me that he expected to meet with some
difficulties for the first few days, from the nature of the
country he had seen from the hill. I did not mention this to the
rest, for fear it might still further tend to depress their
spirits, as three or four of them seemed even now to despair of
ever reaching our destination. I did all in my power to keep them
in good heart, but they were saddened from long suffering. We
removed our camp back along the creek to the side of the high
bare hill on which I was to hoist a flag, and from which I could
look out for a vessel. It also afforded us a security from the
natives, as we could see them at a greater distance. The latitude
of this camp was 12 deg. 35 min. S. Wearied out by long endurance
of trials that would have tried the courage and shaken the
fortitude of the strongest, a sort of sluggish indifference
prevailed that prevented the development of those active energies
which were so necessary to support us in our critical position.
The duties of our camp were performed as if by habit, and knowing
how utterly useless complaint must be, the men seldom repined
aloud."</p>
<p>The desolation of these poor starving prisoners of the bush
quickly became too great for some of them to endure and live. The
self-denying, considerate nature of William Carron shines out
brightly in the midst of the growing darkness. With him, as with
Kennedy, the grand principle was manifestly, as it had been with
some whose renowned names have taken men's minds and admiration
captive, "Duty". With his human circle around him, heart and
health broken, sullen in their agony and despair, with but one
brother in peril perhaps (Wall) with whom he could in any way
hold counsel and sympathetic converse, and by whom he might be
understood as men of education and refined fibre only can
understand each other's unexpressed and inexpressible feeling,
Carron's sense of what was due to them and to the wishes of his
official superior seems never to have been lost sight of. Three
days of this strain of inactive despair brought the first of that
circle to the grave. "Douglas died this morning" (November 16th),
"and we buried him at dusk, when the natives were gone, and I
read the funeral
service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
His death cast an additional gloom over us." 19th, Sunday. "I
read prayers to-day." 20th. "Taylor died this morning, and we
buried him in the evening by the side of Douglas. I read the
funeral service." 26th. "Carpenter died this morning, without
pain or struggle. At eleven o'clock I read prayers, and in the
evening buried our late companion in the bed of the creek, and I
read the funeral service." 27th. "Killed the other horse this
morning, with all appearance of a fine day to dry it; but about
eleven o'clock a heavy thunderstorm came on, and it rained all
day." 28th. "We were very uneasy at the continued wet weather, as
it threatened to destroy the scanty remains of our provisions,
the flesh already beginning to smell very badly." 29th. "The meat
almost putrid." 30th. "Cut up all the meat that would hold
together, but a great deal of it was quite rotten. I saved the
hide of the horse for ourselves; the other I had fed the dogs
with, Kennedy having requested me to keep them alive, if
possible."</p>
<p>And out of this fearful fog of hopelessness and helplessness
flared out a cruel beam (an <i>ignis fatuus</i> such as many a
lost thirst-throed wanderer has hailed in an agony of reacting
gladness as the light of some shepherd's hut&mdash;some white
man's campfire&mdash;and struggled and striven and staggered on
towards it until he has sunk under the sudden perception of the
impish treachery) upon the withering hearts of those sufferers.
Cruel! oh how cruel was the chance that the morning of the 1st of
December conveyed to Carron's strained sight of a home at last! A
schooner beating towards them, too, from the northward! Rescue
from death at last! the promised coming of Kennedy! "Down on our
knees men! with thanksgiving," (I can fancy the glad-tidings
carrier) "here comes the 'Bramble'!" Let the journal speak for
itself: "I supposed her to be the 'Bramble', as it was about the
time Kennedy had given me expectation of being relieved by water,
and I afterwards found I was right in the supposition. I
naturally concluded that she had come for <i>us</i>; and full of
hope and joy I immediately hoisted a flag on a staff we had
previously erected on a part of the hill where it could be seen
from any part of the bay. We placed a ball above the flag to put
the crew on their guard against the natives. We then collected a
quantity of wood and at dusk lighted a fire and kept it burning
till about half-past seven or eight o'clock. I then fired off
three rockets one after the other at intervals of about twenty
minutes. I also took a large pistol up the hill, and stood for
some time firing it as quickly as I could load it, thinking they
might perhaps see the flash of that, if they had not seen the
rockets.</p>
<p>"December 2nd. Early this morning I was up straining my eyes
to catch a view of the bay, and at length saw the schooner
<i>standing in</i> to the shore, and during the forenoon <em>a
boat</em> was lowered. I now made quite certain they were coming
for us, and thinking they might come up the creek in the boats,
for some distance, I hastened down the hill and began <i>to pack
up a few things</i>, determined to keep them waiting for our
baggage no longer than I could help. I looked anxiously for them
all the afternoon, <i>wondering much</i> at their delay in
coming, at last I went up the hill just in time to see <i>the
schooner passing the bay</i>."</p>
<p class="poemw">"White as a white sail on a dusky sea,<br>
When half the horizon's clouded, and half free,<br>
Fluttering between the dim wave and the sky,<br>
Is Hope's last gleam in man's extremity!"<br></p>
<p>"I cannot describe the feeling of despair and desolation which
I, in common with the rest of our party, experienced as we gazed
on the vessel as she fast faded from our view. On the very brink
of starvation and death&mdash;death in the lone wilderness
peopled only with the savage denizens of the forest, who even
then were thirsting for our blood. Hope, sure and certain hope,
had for one brief moment gladdened our hearts with the consoling
assurance, that after our many, many trials and protracted
sufferings, we were again about to find comfort and safety. The
bright expectancy faded, and although we tried to persuade
ourselves that the vessel was not the 'Bramble', our hearts sank
within us in deep despondency.</p>
<p>"December 4th. Finished our scanty remnant of flour.</p>
<p>"December 7th. Our horse-flesh was so bitter that nothing but
unendurable hunger could have induced us to eat it. A number of
small brown beetles were generating from it, which ate it, and we
were also much annoyed by flies.</p>
<p>"December 13th. This morning Mitchell was found dead by the
side of the creek with his feet in the water. He must have gone
down at night to fetch water, but too much exhausted had sat down
and died there! None of us being strong enough to dig a grave for
him, we sewed the body in a blanket, with a few stones to sink
it, and then put it in the brackish water. Rain! rain! rain!</p>
<p>"December 21. Our kangaroo dog being very weak, and unable to
catch anything, we killed and lived on him for two days. We drank
the water in which we boiled him.</p>
<p>"24th. My legs had swelled very much, and I was able to walk
but a very short distance. 26th. The natives brought us a few
pieces of fish and turtle, but almost rotten; also, a
blue-tongued lizard, which I opened and took out eleven young
ones, which we roasted and ate. We always equally divided
whatever we got, but the natives brought us very little that was
eatable. I could easily see that their pretended good feeling
towards us was assumed for the sake of fulfilling their own
designs upon us. Their object was to obtain an opportunity of
coming upon us by surprise, and destroying us. They had many
times seen the fatal effects of our fire-arms, and I believe it
was only the dread of these that prevented them from falling upon
us at once. They were a much finer race of men than the natives
we had seen at Rockingham Bay, most of them being from five feet
ten inches to six feet high. 28th. Niblett and Wall both died
this morning. Niblett was quite dead when I got up, and Wall,
though alive, was unable to speak. I had been talking with them
both, endeavouring to encourage them to hope on to the last, but
sickness, privation and fatigue had overcome them, and they
abandoned themselves to a calm and listless despair. About eleven
o'clock some fifty natives, armed with spears, and many of them
painted with a yellowish earth, made their appearance in the
vicinity of our camp. There were natives of several strange
tribes among them. They were well aware that neither Niblett nor
Wall was able to resist them, if they did not know that they were
dead. They also knew that we were very weak, although I always
endeavoured as much as possible to keep that fact from them. This
morning when I made signs to them to lay down their spears they
paid no attention, with the exception of two who had been in the
habit of coming very frequently to the camp. These two came
running up quite close to us without their spears, and
endeavoured to persuade one of us to go across a small dry creek
for a fish, which another of the rascals was holding up to tempt
us.</p>
<p>"They tried various methods to draw our attention from the
rest who were drawing their spears along the ground with their
feet, closing gradually around us and running from tree to tree
to hide their spears behind them. Others lay on their backs in
the long grass and were working their way towards us. Goddard and
myself stood with our guns in readiness and our pistols by our
sides for about two hours, when I fell from excessive weakness.
When I got up, we thought it best to send them away at once or
stand our chance of being speared in the attempt; both of us
being unable to stand any longer, we presented our guns at the
two by our side, making signs to them to send the others away or
we would shoot them immediately. This they did and ran off in all
directions without a spear being thrown or a shot
fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
As the evening came on there came with it the painful task of
removing the bodies of our unfortunate companions who had died in
the morning. We had not strength to make the smallest hole in the
ground as a grave, but after great exertion we succeeded in
moving the bodies to a small
patch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We laid them side by side and coveredthem with a few
branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I did not quite despair, but I knew we could not live
long.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our sole remaining companion, the sheep-dog, I intended to kill
in a day or two, but he could not last long, as he was nothing
but skin and bone.</p>
<p>"December 30th. Goddard went to get another pigeon, and, if
the natives made their appearance, I was to fire a pistol to
recall him to the camp. After he had gone I saw natives coming
toward the camp, and immediately fired a pistol, but before
Goddard could come back they were in the camp, and handed me a
piece of paper very much dirtied and torn. I was sure from the
first by their manner that there was a vessel in the bay. The
paper was a note from Captain Dobson, of the schooner 'Ariel';
but it was so dirtied and torn that I could only read part of it.
For a minute or two I was almost senseless with the joy which the
hope of our deliverance inspired. I made the natives a few
presents, and gave them a note to Captain Dobson, which I made
them easily understand I wanted them to take to that gentleman. I
was in hopes they would then have gone, but I soon found they had
other intentions. A great many were coming from all quarters,
well armed with spears. I had given a shirt to the one who had
brought the note and put it on him, but I saw him throw down the
note and pull off the shirt, and, picking up his spear, he joined
the rest, who were preparing to attack us. We were expecting
every moment to be attacked and murdered, our newly-awakened
hopes already beginning to fail, when we saw Captain Dobson and
Dr. Vallack, accompanied by Jacky and a man named Barrett, who
had been wounded a few days before in the arm by a barbed spear,
approaching us across the creek. I and my companion, who was
preserved with me, must ever be grateful for the prompt courage
with which these persons, at the risk of their own lives, came to
our assistance, through the scrub and mangroves, a distance of
about three miles, surrounded as they were all the way by a large
number of armed natives. I was reduced almost to a skeleton. The
elbow of my right arm was through the skin, as also the bone of
my right hip. My legs also were swollen to an enormous size.
Goddard walked to the boat, but I could not do so without the
assistance of Captain Dobson and Dr. Vallack, and I had to be
carried altogether a part of the way, Jacky and Barrett kept a
look out for the blacks. I could only secure an abstract of my
journal: that portion of it from 13th November to 30th December,
which I have in full.</p>
<p>"We got on board the 'Ariel', and, after a very long passage,
arrived in Sydney."</p>
<p>And this journal was penned from the 13th of November to the
30th of December, at a time when Carron was encompassed by a
cordon of death; when himself dying by the slow process which was
enticing Death's presence day and night within the shrinking ring
in which he was pent up. Not a word of his own torments; no
querulous cry; no reproachful reflection. Calm, observant,
collected, and patient, this sufferer, ministering to his fellows
ere they passed away, in forgetfulness of self and devotion to
duty, kept&mdash;<i>mirabile dictu</i>!&mdash;likewise a daily
record of every object which attracted the scientific exercise of
his vocation.</p>
<p>Such power makes one proud of such a fellow countryman!</p>
<p>Calm! In the words written under his soul's overpowering
disturbances, is there aught but calmness? Observant! In the
whirl of his daily and nightly agony did he fail? Not a plant,
not an object, not even when Death had brought him a first
summons to prepare himself to follow Douglas, did he allow the
texture of the native women's girdles to escape notice.
Collected! When was he off his guard against his savage foes?
When taken by surprise? Patient! His simple precis of the
sufferings around him and within him is a monument on which his
name may endure. I fall short of telling what this journal speaks
to myself, at least. I must find shelter for my shortcomings in a
grand man's cry, even Carlyle's: "How happy could I, but in any
measure, in such times as these, make manifest the meanings of
Heroism!"</p>
<p>From Carron let us turn to his leader. Noble must have been
some feature in Kennedy's character which could thoroughly win
the attachment&mdash;even unmistakeable affection&mdash;of an
Australian aboriginal. Attributable to other powers must have
been the faculty of ensuring the respect of his own people. No
ill-will, no suspicion, no jealousy of the method
prescribed,&mdash;<i>pour savoir vivre</i>,* no sullen rejection
of instruction, or advice, nor inattentiveness to his expressed
directions&mdash;no animosities, notwithstanding the thousand and
one provocations to which such a trial of sickness, hunger,
helplessness and death subjected the general temper&mdash;why was
it so? Kennedy was fitted to his work, and under this conviction,
others cheerfully and confidently fitted themselves to terrible
occasions under his leadership, and were left no room for
complaint nor passion. What testimony gives William Carron from
the very outset? June 22nd. "Kennedy returned this evening, and
again having found it impossible to cross the swamps, we were
obliged to return to the beach, where the travelling was better
than among the trees. At this time we had only two meals a day;
breakfast at daylight, and dinner when we had completed our day's
work, and camped. 'Whenever any birds were shot they were boiled
for supper.' '<i>Kennedy appeared admirably fitted for the leader
of an expedition of this character in every respect</i>.'</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The meals were cut up into thirteen parts, as
nearly equal as possible, and one person touched each part in
succession, whilst another, with his back turned, called out the
names of the party, the person named taking the part touched. The
scrupulous exactness we were obliged to practise with respect to
our provisions was increased by our misfortune in getting next to
nothing to assist our scanty ration, while the extreme labour to
which we were subjected increased our
appetites."&mdash;<span class="u">Carron's Journal</span>.]</p>
<p>"Although he had innumerable difficulties and hardships to
contend with, he always appeared cheerful and in good spirits.
Travelling through such a country as we were, such a disposition
was essential to the success of the expedition. He was always
diverting the minds of his followers from the obstacles we daily
encountered, and encouraging them to hope for better success:
careful in all his observations and calculations as to the
position of his camp, and cautious not to plunge into
difficulties without personal observation of the country to
enable him to take the safest
path.".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(What
a comment on the style of ground they had to
overcome!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"But having decided, he pursued his deliberate determination with
steady perseverance, sharing in the labour of cutting through the
scrub, and all the harassment attendant on travelling through
such a wilderness, with as much or greater alacrity and zeal than
any of his followers. It was often grievous to me to hear some of
the party observe after we had passed over some difficult tract
'that a better road might have been found, a little to the right
or to the left.' Such observations (the nearest to grumbling I
meet with) "were most unjust and vexatious, as in all matters of
difficulty and of opinion he would invariably <i>listen</i> to
the advice of all, and if he thought it prudent, <i>take it</i>.
For my own part, I can safely say that I was always ready to obey
his orders and conform to his directions,' confident as I then
was, of his ability to lead us to the place of our destination as
speedily as possible."</p>
<p>Having followed Kennedy so far, we must follow him to his
death. Of that there was but one witness, Jacky; from whose
statement when taken on board the "Ariel", at Port Albany, I have
the sad story.</p>
<p>Kennedy had on the 13th of November started from Carron's camp
within sight of Weymouth Bay with Jacky, Costigan, Luff, and
Dunn. A few days afterwards Costigan was severely wounded through
his own careless handling of his gun. Kennedy left the sufferer
with his two companions at a place which he called "Pudding-pan
Hill" near Shelburne Bay. "Mr. Kennedy wanted to make great haste
when he left this place to get the doctor to go down to the men
that were ill. This was about three weeks after leaving Weymouth
Bay. Next morning Mr. Kennedy and me went on with four
horses&mdash;leaving one with the men at Pudding-pan Hill. One
horse got bogged in a swamp. We tried to get him out all that day
but could not: we left him there.</p>
<p>"The next day Mr. Kennedy went on again, and passed up a
ridge, very scrubby, and had to turn back again, and went along
gullies to get clear of creek and scrub." (Rain! rain! rain! day
and night!) "My horse fell down, me, and all; the horse lay upon
my thigh. Here Mr. Kennedy got off his horse and moved my horse
off my thigh; we stopped there that night, and could not get the
horse up; we looked to him in the morning and he was dead.</p>
<p>"The next day we went a good way. Mr. Kennedy told me to go up
a tree to see a sandy hill somewhere: I went up a tree, and saw a
sandy hill a little way down from Port Albany. That day we camped
near a swamp; it was a very rainy day. The next morning we went
on, and Mr. Kennedy told me we should get round to Port Albany in
a day.' We travelled on all day till noon, and then we saw Port
Albany. Then he said: 'There is Port Albany, Jacky; a ship is
there&mdash;you see that island there'&mdash;pointing to Albany
Island; this was when we where at the mouth of Escape river. We
stopped a little while; all the meat was gone; I tried to get
some fish, but could not; we went on in the afternoon half-a-mile
along the river side, and met a good lot of blacks and we camped.
The blacks all cried out 'powad! powad!' and rubbed their
bellies, and we thought they were friendly, and Mr. Kennedy gave
them fish-hooks all round; everyone asked me if I had anything to
give away, and I said 'No', and Mr. Kennedy said 'give them your
knife, Jacky.' This fellow on board was the man I gave the knife
to; I am sure of it; I know him well; the black that was shot in
the canoe was the most active in urging all the others on to
spear Mr. Kennedy. I gave the man on board my knife. We went on
this day, and I looked behind, and they were getting up their
spears and ran all round the camp which we had left. I told Mr.
Kennedy that very likely those blackfellows would follow us, and
he said 'No! Jacky, those blacks are very friendly.' I said to
him 'I know those blackfellows well; they too much speak.' We
went on some two or three miles and camped. I, and Mr. Kennedy,
watched them that night, taking it in turn every hour all night;
by-and-by I saw the blackfellows; it was a moonlight night, and I
walked up to Mr. Kennedy and said to him 'there is plenty of
black fellows now;' this was in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kennedy told me to get my gun ready. The blacks did not
know where we slept, as we did not make a fire. We both sat up
all night. After this daylight came, and I fetched the horses and
saddled them. Then we went on a good way up the river, and then
we sat down a little while, and we saw three blackfellows coming
along our track, and they saw us, and one fellow ran back as hard
as he could run and fetched up plenty more, like a flock of sheep
almost. I told Mr. Kennedy to put the saddles on the two horses
and go on, and the blacks came up and followed us all the day.
All along it was raining, and I now told him to leave the horses
and come on without them&mdash;that the horses made too much
track. Mr. Kennedy was too weak and would not leave the horses.
We went on this day till towards evening; raining hard; and the
blacks followed us all the day, some behind, some planted
before&mdash;in fact blacks, blacks, all around, following us.
Now we went into a little scrub, and I told Mr. Kennedy to look
behind always. Sometimes he would do so, and sometimes he would
not look behind, to look for the blacks. Then a good many
blackfellows came behind in the scrub and threw plenty of spears,
and hit Mr. Kennedy in the back first. Mr. Kennedy said to me,
'Oh! Jacky, Jacky, shoot 'em, shoot 'em!' Then I pulled out my
gun and fired, and hit one fellow all over the face with
buck-shot. He tumbled down and got up again and again, and
wheeled right round, and two blackfellows picked him up and
carried him away.</p>
<p>"They went away then a little way and came back again,
throwing spears all round more than they did before&mdash;very
large spears. I pulled out the spear at once from Mr. Kennedy's
back, and cut out the jag with Mr. Kennedy's knife. Then Mr.
Kennedy got his gun and snapped, but the gun would not go off.
The blacks sneaked all along by the trees, and speared Mr.
Kennedy again in the right leg, above the knee a little, and I
got speared over the eye; and the blacks were now throwing their
spears all ways, never giving over, and shortly again speared Mr.
Kennedy in the right side. There were large jags to the spears,
and I cut them out and put them into my pocket. At the same time
we got speared the horses got speared too and jumped and bucked
all about, and got into the swamp. I told Mr. Kennedy to sit down
while I looked after the saddlebags, which I did, and when I came
back again I saw blacks along with Mr. Kennedy. I then asked him
if he saw the blacks with him. He was stupid with the spear
wounds, and said 'No.' Then I asked him where was his watch. I
saw the blacks taking away watch and hat as I was returning to
Mr. Kennedy. Then I carried Mr. Kennedy into the scrub. He said,
'don't carry me a good way.' Then Mr. Kennedy looked very
bad&mdash;this way" (Jacky rolled his eyes). "I said to him,
'Don't look far away,' as I thought he would be frightened. I
asked him often, 'Are you well now?' and he said, 'I don't care
for the spear wound in my leg, Jacky, but for the other two spear
wounds in my side and back,' and he said, 'I am bad inside,
Jacky.' I told him blackfellow always die when he got spear in
there&mdash;the back, He said, 'I am out of wind, Jacky.' I asked
him, 'Mr. Kennedy, are you going to leave me?' and he said, 'Yes,
my boy, I am going to leave you.' He said, 'I am very bad, Jacky.
You take the books, Jacky, to the Captain, but not the big ones;
the Governor will give anything for them.' I then tied up the
papers. He then said, 'Jacky, give me paper, and I will write.' I
gave him paper and pencil, and he tried to write, and he <i>then
fell back and died</i>, and I caught him as he fell back, and
held him, and I then turned round myself and cried. I was crying
a good while until I got well; that was about an hour, and then I
buried him. I digged up the ground with a tomahawk, and covered
him over with logs, then grass, and my shirt and trousers. That
night I left him near dark. I would go through the scrub, and the
blacks threw spears at me&mdash;a good many&mdash;and I went back
again into the scrub. Then I went down the creek, which runs into
Escape river, and I walked along the water in the creek very
easy, with my head only above water, to avoid the blacks and get
out of their way. In this way I went half a mile; then I got out
of the creek and got clear of them, and walked on all night
nearly, and slept in the bush without a fire. I went on next
morning, and felt very bad, and I spelled for two days. I lived
upon nothing but salt water.</p>
<p>"Next day I went on and camped one mile away from where I left
and sat down there, and I wanted to spell a little there and go
on: but when I tried to get up, I could not, but fell down again.
One mile, and got nothing to eat but one nonda, and I went on
that day and camped, and on again next morning about half a mile,
and sat down, where there was good water, and remained all day.
On the following morning I went a good way; went round a great
swamp of mangroves and got a good way by sundown. The next
morning I went and saw a very large track of blackfellows: I went
clear of the track and of swamp or sandy ground. I then came to a
very large river and a large lagoon&mdash;plenty of alligators in
the lagoon&mdash;about ten miles from Port Albany. I now got into
the ridges by sundown, and went up a tree and saw Albany Island.
Then next morning at four o'clock I went on as hard as I could
go, all the way down over fine clear ground, fine iron-bark
timber, and plenty of good grass. I went on round the point"
(this was towards Cape York, north of Albany Island) "and went on
and followed a creek down, and went on top of the hill and saw
Cape York, because the sand did not go on further. I sat down
then a good while. I said to myself 'this is Port Albany, I
believe, inside somewhere.' Mr. Kennedy also told me that the
ship was inside, close up to the mainland. I went up a little way
and saw the ship and boat. I met close up here two black gins and
a good many piccanninies. One said to me 'powad! powad!' Then I
asked her for eggs: she gave me turtle eggs, and I gave her a
burning glass. She pointed to the ship which I had seen before. I
was very frightened at seeing the black men all along here, and
when I was on the rock coo-eeing, and <i>murry, murry</i> glad
when the boat came for me."</p>
<p>Captain Dobson of the "Ariel", tells the sequel of this
terrible episode in this ill-advised exploring venture.
"Proceeded on the 2nd of October last&mdash;1848&mdash;to Port
Albany to meet Kennedy's exploring party and to supply them with
provisions. We arrived at Port Albany on the 27th October, and
remained there till the 23rd December, when, in consequence of a
signal, I went on shore and learnt from Jacky-Jacky the death of
Kennedy and the unfortunate fate of the expedition. And, in
consequence of this information, we made preparations, and the
next day weighed anchor and sailed to Shelburne Bay. Jacky
informed us that Pudding-pan Hill, between Albany Point and
Shelburne Bay, was where Kennedy had left the three sick men. On
proceeding there, Jacky said it was not there but on a hill like
it further down. On arriving at Shelburne Bay Jacky recognised
the hill; we landed early in the morning and fell in with the
natives and went inland, but could not get through the scrub; we
came back to the beach and found a canoe with the cloak
(produced) in it; on the afternoon previous, thought I saw two
natives on the beach with cloaks or blue shirts on; we then
pulled further on and landed again, and went about six miles
inland, but Jacky could not cross the track Kennedy had taken; he
recognised the hill where the camp was, and said we might reach
it to-morrow. At starting Jacky said it would not take us long,
and we took no food with us, After a consultation we agreed to
return to the vessel, believing, from the cloaks on the natives
that the men must have perished. We then pursued our way to
Weymouth Bay, and rescued Carron and Goddard. We brought with us
what instruments we could from the camp&mdash;they were not
many&mdash;as Carron was hardly in a state to tell me what was
there. We then consulted and determined to come on at once to
Sydney, as from what Jacky told us, it was thought useless to
return to look for the men at Shelburne Bay.</p>
<p>"I should have returned to the camp at Weymouth Bay to save
everything but for the hostility of the natives, who surrounded
us in great numbers, and, as soon as we had left the camp, rifled
it."</p>
<p>Dr. Vallack's description of the scenes during the rescue
conducted by Jacky is full of interest: "Saturday, 3rd December,
1848. About eight o'clock, a.m., Captain Dobson called down to
me, saying he thought Kennedy had arrived, as there was a black
on shore, with a shirt and
trousers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The Captain left in his dingy, and I observed with the glass the
black first standing, then walking very lame; then sitting down
on a rock. The dingy made there and took him on board. It turned
out to be Jacky, who looked very haggard. He became faint on
board, and a glass of wine revived him. He told a woeful story.
Depositions were taken. Conversing with Jacky all the next day, I
took down in pencil what he had to say, changing the subject now
and then by speaking of his comrades at Jerry's Plains. I did so,
as he told me what kept him awake all last night was 'thinking
about Mr. Kennedy.' The following day saw what appeared to be
land. On nearing found it to be a canoe, about fifteen feet long,
with seven or eight natives in it, shearing about, now in one
direction, now in another. They drew close to the vessel; very
wary, however, in doing so. Jacky was placed in the fore-top, and
word came that Jacky knew all those fellows; that they were the
party who speared Kennedy. One was allowed on board. A seaman,
Parker, told me that Jacky wanted to speak to me. He said, 'that
fellow,' pointing to the one named, 'is the fellow that speared
Mr. Kennedy. I gave him a knife; bale let him go.' He was
immediately secured.</p>
<p>"It was as much as three men could do; the others in the canoe
jumped overboard, and observing now that the man secured had a
part of a bridle round his arm, and a piece of sinew or tendon of
a horse, and Jacky being so positive as to his identity, it was
determined to examine the canoe, and an order was given to fire
over their heads whilst they (the blacks) were endeavouring to
recover the canoe. The long boat was sent after the canoe, but in
the meantime the blacks had recovered it and a hard chase took
place: the boat overhauled them, and as it closed upon them I saw
the blacks jump overboard again, and afterwards the ship's boat
bring back the canoe. Barrett said to me when alongside that he
was speared, and that he had shot the black who had speared him,
and who was now in the canoe nearly dead. It appears that one
black stuck to his canoe, and on the ship's boat nearing it had
thrown a spear into Barrett's arm, and was on the eve of throwing
another when Barrett shot him. From the canoe was brought the leg
part of a pair of trowsers, three spears, a piece of saddle-iron,
&amp;c., and a piece of moleskin was taken off the native's leg,
which Jacky says was part of a pair of trowsers which he had tied
round Kennedy's head when he buried him: Jacky being sure that
they had dug up the body. I had observed at the time that the
native was nearly on board, the moment he and they saw Jacky,
they looked at each other as if everything was not right. As we
neared Pudding-pan Hill&mdash;as marked on the chart&mdash;Jacky
said 'this is not the place.' Being placed in the fore-top he
became more positive, saying at length, 'do you think I am
stupid? Mr. Kennedy sent me from the camp to look out the coast
so that I might know it again when I came back in the ship, and I
will tell you when we come to it: the ship must go on that way
further,' pointing to the south.</p>
<p>"26th December. We anchored in Shelburne Bay, opposite where
Jacky wished to proceed to recover the three men: he was sure
this was the place, seeing the mountain which Kennedy had called
Pudding-pan Hill" (it may be here stated that this mountain is
the very <i>fac simile</i> of Pudding-pan Hill of the chart). The
result of the search for the three men has been briefly told by
Captain Dobson, but at greater length in Dr. Vallack's journal.
It is all most interesting; and then enters into the particulars
of their coasting to Weymouth Bay. "Saturday, December 30. At
Weymouth Bay" (returning to Dr. Vallack's journal) "five canoes
were now seen creeping off towards us from under the mangroves
with from five to ten natives in each: there was yet no flag nor
any token of white people on the hill.</p>
<p>"The canoes gradually neared us, in a string, and one came
cautiously alongside, making signs and saying 'ferraman,
ferraman' (white man), and pointing towards Jacky's mountain. A
few lines were written, stating that a vessel was in the bay and
the bearer, one of the natives, would take them to it. This was
given to one of the natives in the first canoe, and Jacky, whom
they had recognised, beckoned and motioned to them to take the
note to the camp. In the meantime, the captain and I had
determined, as soon as the boat could be got ready, to proceed,
according to Jacky's instructions, to the camp. Jacky directed us
some distance off, in the wake of the canoes, there being nothing
but a mangrove swamp on the shore near us. We landed beside a
creek, knee deep in water, among some mangroves. Here we got out
of the boat&mdash;Jacky, the Captain, Barrett, and
myself,&mdash;Jacky leading through a mangrove swamp for a
considerable distance till we came out on a beautiful flat, and
followed up a creek, which Jacky said would lead us to the camp.
After getting on (keeping a good look-out) for about two miles,
Jacky doubled his pace, and all at once said with great emphasis,
'I see camp.' 'Well done, Jacky,' I think, was exclaimed by all
of us. Jacky, still going on at a sharp pace, stopped for a
moment and said, 'I not sure, and suddenly, with great
excitement, exclaimed, 'See two whitefellows sit down and camp!'
We were now on one side of the creek. Down the creek we went, and
up on the other side in double-quick time, and a scene presented
itself.</p>
<p>"On the side of the hill, not two hundred yards from us, were
two men sitting down looking towards us, the tent and fire
immediately behind them; and on coming up to them, two of the
most pitiable creatures imaginable were sitting down! One had
sufficient strength to get up; the other appeared to me to be in
the very last stage of consumption. Alas! Alas! They were the
only two left of eight men; the remainder having died of
starvation! Whilst we were considering what was best to be done,
natives in great numbers were descried watching our movements.
Jacky said&mdash;calling me aside&mdash;'Doctor! now I tell you
exactly what to do; you see those blackfellows over there; you
leave him tent, everything, altogether there, and get the two
whitefellows to the boat, quick!'</p>
<p>"Jacky was exceedingly energetic and grave as well. 'Get away
as quick as possible' was resounded by all; but what was to be
done? Two men almost dead to walk two or three miles. We looked
over the tent, asked Carron for what important things there were,
and each laid hold of what appeared to be of most value&mdash;the
Captain taking two sextants, others firearms, &amp;c. 'Come
along!' again and again Jacky called out, and the Captain too,
whilst they were half-way down towards the creek, and Barrett and
I were loading ourselves. I took a case of seeds, some papers of
Carron's, a double-barrelled gun and pistol, which, together with
my own double gun and pistols, thermometer, and my pockets full
of powder and shot, was as much as I could manage. Seeing Carron
could not get along, I told him to put his hands on my shoulders,
and in this way he managed to walk down as far as nearly through
the mangrove swamp towards the water's edge, when he could not in
that way possibly get any further. Barrett, with his disabled
arm, carried him down to the edge of the water. Goddard, the
other survivor, was just able to walk down; spoke and looked
exceedingly feeble. They were brought on board at noon, and
attended to according to my instructions. Carron's legs were
dreadfully swollen&mdash;about three times their natural size. In
the afternoon both reviving, and thanking God for their
deliverance. I was for some time afraid of Carron. At ten p.m.
they are both doing well, and I trust will be enabled to tell
their own tale, which renders it unnecessary for me to write it
down here. It was too great a risk to return for the purpose of
securing anything, so we proceeded direct to Sydney. Carron and
Goddard were a considerable time in getting better, the former
being subject to daily fits of ague.</p>
<p>"Thursday, January 11th, 1849. The black native had made his
escape during the night whilst it was raining and blowing hard.
We were, at this time, anchored one and a-half to two miles from
Turtle Reef, and a distance of eight miles from Cape Bedford, I
the nearest point of the mainland. Search was made on the reef
but no marks of him; a strong current was making towards Cape
Bedford and he might have taken that direction. Two large sharks
were seen about the ship this morning; it is our impression the
man can never have reached the land. The black was seen by Parker
on deck at two a.m., whilst it was thundering, lightning, and
raining, but never seen afterwards."</p>
<p>The last scenes of this ill-starred adventure are described in
the private log&mdash;published in extract and attached to
Carron's pamphlet&mdash;of T. Beckworth Simpson, captain of the
brig "Freak", which gives an account of her proceedings when
employed in searching for the papers, &amp;c., connected with the
late Mr. Kennedy's exploring party.</p>
<p>The "Freak" and "Harbinger"&mdash;Captain Simpson&mdash;sailed
in company from Port Jackson. On the 15th April, 1849, shortly
after rounding the north end of the North Percy Islands, Jacky,
who was of course the mainspring of the search, pointed out from
the "Freak" two white men on the island who were making signals.
When taken off by one of the boats they represented themselves as
shipwrecked seamen cast away in a schooner named the "Buona
Vesta" from Port Nicholson, bound to Torres Straits for
bêche-de-mer. One of the men, named Clarke, after much hesitation
admitted they had another companion who he thought must be dead:
he was found about a hundred yards from where we had landed,
insensible, and remained so till sunset, when he died: the two
men were taken to the "Freak". Their story and conflicting
statements excited suspicion. It was reported next morning that
Clarke had been tearing up papers and throwing them overboard.
Captain Simpson picked up some of the scraps, on one of which was
an address to "Matthew Clarke on board the 'Marion Woolwich'",
and sufficient to prove their story false, and he had no doubt
that they were runaway convicts.</p>
<p>This conclusion seemed to be further established on an after
examination of what was found on the island, on which they buried
the body of the dead man, a purple mark on whose throat, coupled
with the prevarication of the two survivors, raised a strong
suspicion of foul play. Hitherto, and until May, strong squalls
and heavy gales blowing from S.S.E. May 2nd. Anchored within
sight of the hill pointed out by Jacky, where Kennedy had left
the eight of his party at Weymouth Bay, and where Carron and
Goddard had been rescued by the "Ariel". The rain poured in
torrents, so much so, that they could not load their guns the
next day, when they landed for the purpose of looking for any
papers or other relics: found part of a blanket where they
landed, a piece of tarpaulin and canvas, part apparently of a
tent; little way up the creek three canoes, with out-riggers on
both sides: they were up to their waists in water in the mangrove
swamp, to avoid crossing which they used the boats, and pulled a
short distance up the creek: left the boats with a party and,
Jacky leading, came out from a mangrove swamp to an open spot:
saw five natives, each carrying a bundle of spears, who ran off
at once. This "open" was knee-deep in water: the whole distance
it was ankle-deep.</p>
<p>After proceeding some distance, Jacky pointed out the place
where Kennedy had left the eight men, who afterwards moved to the
other side of the creek; near this was a tree carved with large
letters K. LXXX. The stream was too strong for fording; but they
found a tree lying across, on which they got over, where the
grass was as high as their shoulders. A bare spot of ground
indicated the exact locality of the camp. It was "strewed with
portions of books, all of a religious or scientific description;
among them a portion of Leichhardt's journey overland; no
manuscript, parts of harness, pieces of cedar boxes in leather
covers, tins for carrying water, a camp stool, odds and ends of
every description, and specimens of natural history all
destroyed. There were also the bones of a horse and a skull of a
dog; a piece of torn calico adhering to a portion of a chart, on
which could be made out the words 'Mitchell river'. I was some
time," says Captain Simpson, "before I could find the remains of
Wall and Niblett, who were the last men that died, and had not
been buried, the survivors being too weak. I placed myself at the
camp, and looked about for the likeliest place to which a corpse
would be taken under the circumstances. I went down into a small
gully about sixty yards from the camp. Under some small bushes,
in about two feet of water, I found their bones, two skulls and
some of the larger bones: the smaller ones having most probably
been washed away. They were all collected carefully and taken on
board. I was rather surprised to find some cabbage-palm trees
growing in the vicinity of the camp; the tops are very nutritious
and would have been very desirable for men in a starving state,
had they been aware of it. I picked up the key of a chronometer.
Jacky's insisting upon the uselessness of going to the camp where
the three men had been left at Shelburne Bay, the attempt was not
made, but the whaleboat, with Jacky, was sent to follow up the
coast as close as possible to the beach, to land occasionally,
and examine all native camps." In the evening of the 4th May, the
boat rejoined the brig&mdash;the "Harbinger" had parted
company&mdash;having found a native camp and canoe; in the latter
a leathern pistol holster marked 34. Three natives were seen, who
ran off; but there were no indications of Europeans. "Jacky was
confident that the men left had been killed."</p>
<p>On May 7, near the mouth of the Escape river, the '"Freak"
fell in with the "Coquette", schooner, Captain Elliott, wdio
volunteered to accompany Captain Simpson in his farther search.
"At half-past six on the morning of Monday, May 7," writes
Captain Simpson, "we ran before a strong breeze from the S.E. for
the entrance to the Escape river. At half-past seven, hauled in
round the south head of Point Shadwell. After entering the river
perceived a bay with small sandy reaches, one of which Jacky
pointed out as the place where Kennedy first met the hostile
natives. From this place we observed some of them launching a
canoe for the purpose of speaking with
us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
After steering west about live or six miles, the river began
gradually to wind to the northward, and afterwards S.S.E. The
river, six or seven miles from the entrance, was upwards of one
mile in width; both banks were covered by an impenetrable
mangrove swamp. After the river trended to the south we had to
lower our sail and pull. I observed several branches of the river
trending to the north and west. We remained on the southernmost
branch, the principal one. As we proceeded on the left hand side
of the river, we came to a clear place, free of mangroves, the
only one we had seen, and Jacky pointed it out as the place where
Kennedy had come down on the morning of the day he was killed. It
was here Jacky advised him to abandon the horses and swim the
river, here about thirty yards wide. Jacky pointed out the tree
where they made the horses fast whilst they went down to the
river and searched in vain for oysters, they having eaten nothing
all day. We again proceeded, the river gradually becoming
narrower, and the water perfectly fresh. After going two or three
miles the river became so narrow our oars could not be used. We
were compelled to haul the boats along, against a strong stream,
by the overhanging branches, frequently coming across fallen
trees, over which we had to launch our boats, running the risk of
staving them, and, again, obliged to force them under others. We
still proceeded, until the boats could go no further. We had
traced the Escape river to its source, a small fresh-water
creek.</p>
<p>"We went a short distance inland, saw an extensive plain which
Jacky recognised as the plain he had crossed the day Kennedy was
killed. Jacky went a short distance further and returned, having
perfectly satisfied himself as to our locality, we proceeded,
leaving four hands in charge of the boats: we walked some
distance across a swamp, still following the course of the creek.
We traced the creek for nearly a mile looking out for a
crossing-place, when Jacky pointed out on the other side of the
creek the place where he had secreted the saddle-bags. At length
we came to a tree which had fallen, and formed a kind of bridge,
over which we passed with difficulty, and went to the place where
Jacky said the saddle-bags were planted. Jacky then showed us the
place where 'horse tumble down creek' after being speared. Some
horse dung was found on the top of the bank close to this place
which confirmed Jacky's statement. He then took us a few yards
into the scrub to look for the saddle-bags, and told us to look
out for a broken twig growing over a thick bush. The place was
found but the saddle-bags were gone. On searching under a bush
among the leaves, the horizon glass of a sextant was found, as
strong proof that Jacky had found the right place. Jacky then
took us through a dense scrub for some distance, when we came on
open swampy ground, about half a mile wide. On the opposite side
there was more scrub close to which there were three large
ant-hills. Jacky took us to the centre one, five yards from which
poor Kennedy fell. Against this ant-hill, Jacky placed him when
he went after the saddle-bags. Jacky told us to look about for
broken spears: some pieces were found: he then took us to a place
about sixty yards from the ant hill, where he put Kennedy, who
then told him not to carry him far. About half a mile from this
place, towards the creek, Jacky pointed out a clear space of
ground close to three young pandanus trees as the place where the
unfortunate gentleman died. Jacky had taken him here to wash his
wounds and stop the blood. It was here, when poor Kennedy found
he was dying, that he gave instructions to Jacky about his
papers, when Jacky said 'why do you talk so, you are not going to
leave me!' Jacky then led the way to a dense tea-tree scrub
distant about three or four hundred yards where he had carried
the body and buried it. When we came to the edge of the scrub
Jacky was at a loss where to enter it, as he said when he was
carrying the corpse he did not look behind, all the objects in
front being nearly alike he did not get a good mark. Into the
midst of the scrub we went, divided ourselves and searched in
every direction, but could not find the place. Jacky had not made
the spot too conspicuous fearing the blacks might find it. He had
only bent two twigs across each other; the scrub was not very
extensive but exceedingly thick.</p>
<p>"Jacky led the way to a creek, and pointed out the place where
he had crossed. Jacky said, 'I threw him down one fellow compass
somewhere here.' It was immediately found. Jacky then went to a
place where he 'plant him sextant,' but the flood had been over
the place and washed it away. When returning I found the trough
of an artificial horizon washed upon the banks of the creek: this
had been left with the sextant. Jacky crossed the creek, and
found a small wooden bottle of quicksilver in the same place
where he had left it in. We returned to the scrub where Kennedy
was buried. When we came to it I placed the party&mdash;eleven in
number&mdash;five yards asunder, and traversed it this way in all
directions, but without success. I then took Jacky to the place
where the poor gentleman died, and told him to go towards the
scrub in the same manner he did when he was carrying the corpse
and not to look back, which he did, telling me the manner in
which he carried it, and where he shifted it from one shoulder to
the other. In this way he entered the scrub, and I have no doubt
he took us very near the exact place where the body was buried.
We sounded the ground all round with our ramrods, but without
success. After taking another good look, we reluctantly gave up
the search, as the night was rapidly approaching, and returned to
the boats.</p>
<p>"My opinion is, that the remains of the unfortunate gentleman
have <em>not</em> been exhumed. If they had, we should have seen
some indications of them: the natives would not have taken the
trouble to fill the grave, or take away the bones. The only clue
that gave rise to the supposition that the natives had found the
body, was the fact that part of Kennedy's trowsers were found in
the canoe taken by the schooner 'Ariel'. Jacky said there were
other trowsers in the saddle-bags exactly like those he had on at
the time of his death. There is not the slightest doubt the
saddle-bags were found by the natives.</p>
<p>"Poor Jacky was very quiet, but felt, and felt deeply during
the day. When pointing out the spot where Kennedy died, I saw
tears in his eyes, and no one could be more indefatigable in
searching for the remains. His feelings against the natives were
bitter, and had any of them made their appearance at that time I
could hardly have prevented him from shooting them. At eleven we
arrived&mdash;by the boats then rejoined&mdash;at the entrance of
the river where I camped for the night on a sandy beach not far
from Cape Shadwell, having determined to examine the native camp
at daybreak; set a watch but made no fire, as I wanted to take
the natives by surprise. At day-break launched our boats and
pulled towards the camp where we had seen natives the day before.
Some of the party went along the beach. On arriving at the camp,
found it had very recently been abandoned. I went with Jacky some
distance into the bush; he showed me the place where a native
threw a spear at him the day before Kennedy's death.</p>
<p>"We searched the camp, found a small piece of red cloth, which
Jacky recognised as part of the lining of Kennedy's cloak, also a
piece of painted canvas. A canoe on the beach we destroyed.
Finding nothing more could be done we pulled out of the river,
and got on board at ten a.m., after a very hard pull against wind
and tide. Finding the brig rode very uneasily in consequence of
the heavy sea, and as Jacky said the other papers, called by him
the 'small ones', and which I conceive to be the most important,
as he was particularly instructed to take them to the Governor,
were secreted at the head of another river, about eight miles
further north, I determined, when the tide eased, to weigh and
seek some more secure anchorage. About half past twelve p.m.
weighed, the 'Coquette' in company, and stood to the north. At
half past four rounded the Tree Island Reef and anchored in five
fathoms, about a mile and a half from the north end of Albany
Island.</p>
<p>"May 10, Thursday. Blowing hard and squally, went ashore for
the purpose of selecting a spot to inter the remains of Wall and
Niblett. Saw the horse left by the 'Ariel'.</p>
<p>"May 11th, Friday. Despatched the whale-boat, fully manned,
armed, and provisioned for two days, with Jacky and his two
companions. Captain Elliott volunteered his services and
accompanied my chief officer, MacNate.</p>
<p>"May 12th, Saturday. At half-past one p.m. the whaleboat
returned, having got the papers, &amp;c., secreted by Jacky in a
hollow tree. A rat, or some animal, had pulled them out of the
tree and they were saturated with water, and, I fear, nearly
destroyed. They consisted of a roll of charts and some memorandum
books.</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 13th. At three p.m., having put the remains of
Thomas Wall and Charles Niblett into a coffin, left the ship in
two boats, with nearly all the ship's crew, and pulled to the
south end of Albany Island, landed, and went up the highest hill
on that part of the island. On the top, in a clear open space, we
dug a grave, interred and read the funeral service over them.
About ten or twelve natives were present. Poor Jacky was much
affected. At each end of the grave I placed two large bushes: on
the top were placed several large stones. A bottle was placed
over the grave with a paper in it stating who was buried there. I
purpose sailing to-morrow for Booby Island.</p>
<p>"I cannot close without mentioning the exemplary conduct of
Jacky. Since he came on board I have always found him quiet,
obliging and very respectful: when on shore nothing could
distract him from his purpose: the sagacity and knowledge he
displayed in travelling the trackless wilderness was astonishing,
when he found the places he went in search of, he was never
flushed with success, but invariably maintained his quiet
unobtrusive behaviour. He was much concerned at not being able to
find the remains of his late master, to whom he was sincerely
attached.</p>
<p>"May 14. Sent a party on shore to endeavour to catch the
horse, caught, and after a long chase, tethered him to a tree for
the night.</p>
<p>"May 15. Got the horse safely on board. Blowing, with heavy
rain, cannot weigh to-day."</p>

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">When</span> I said "So my story's done," I did
not put away from me the object to which the purpose of my story
had been set. I had seen "suckers" from Leslie's first plant on
Darling Downs grip the soil, and like the octopus, bring within
its clingings the food from which Darling Downs was to grow unto
fullest stature. I had seen&mdash;and felt&mdash;that the
dissociated districts of the north&mdash;east and west in more
senses than one&mdash;were caught in the web of a spider policy,
which had for its function almost wholly that of drawing life
blood and nutriment from the outermost circle to its innermost
centre. I had seen a common cause of disaffection combine
opposing elements for the sake of self-preservation, and having
seen this, I may not leave the ground on which was worked out in
my own time, the great result of natural progress.</p>
<p>Out of separation of an empire's area&mdash;an empire's
harmony.</p>
<p>If New South Wales be girding herself for another such leap as
that so nearly accomplished, what space may she not clear in the
next heat of a hundred years? Marvellous as her first stride,
what limit can be assigned to it in the distance?</p>
<p>Our northern colony bent forward for her first leap with the
year 1824. If the effort made retain vigour in any way
commensurate with that with which she has sprung in her teens out
of the thraldom of infancy, who can venture to lay a hand upon
the mouth which may challenge denial of her sovereign power of
speed through Queensland's own maiden century?</p>
<p>"<i>C&oelig;lum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt</i>.
New climates, new skies, new soil, new grafts have but brought
out varieties of new fruit from the old stock: pruned and
qualified home-ridden principles: penetrated, dug about, let air
and light into deep-rooted and rotting prejudices: engendered
conditions of freedom freshened up out of artificial fashions:
eased off strain of coercive custom 'which forms us all: our
thoughts, our morals, our most fixed belief: the consequences of
our place of birth.' A new sun has summoned from the native loam
a harvest mature and well-flavoured enough to suit the fastidious
tastes of home arbiters. The tidal wave of old institutions
propelled by the power of parasite popular theories has recoiled
from these shores within which have been worked&mdash;but not
worked out&mdash;problems '<i>quæ erant
facienda</i>'&mdash;sufficiently to carry back hence the deposit
of colonial practice to imperial apprehension.</p>
<p>"The flood of disestablishment and disendowment&mdash;for weal
or woe, who dare pause to think?&mdash;has been let loose from
these southern seas to beat upon the grand old edifice of
England's Church; and the iniquity of forcing open the floodgates
through which Great Britain's 'Dead Sea' had so long deluged a
law-abiding and loyal land&mdash;(iniquity neutralised by the
stern repulsion and rejection of the beings dead to society, whom
now, as a class, better home counsels, thanks to Antipodean
stubbornness, have found nerve to deal with through the higher
aim of Christian Government, by rooting 'up' crime by effort of a
purer purpose than that of merely routing 'out' the crime-mongers
from her own borders)&mdash;has been stayed from swamping the
affections of her distant domains."</p>
<p>The child of a hundred years has wrought out the training and
stature of a thousand. <i>C&oelig;lum non animum mutant, qui
trans mare currunt</i>. Do you question it? Look, then, upon the
lower platform of the Britisher's pride; the cricket ground: the
river: you will find reflexion from both views. Australia, at
least, will; and will with self-assertion.</p>
<p>Yet, even as the new has by the stop-watch of events on the
march "forward", so marvellously exceeded the pace of the old
world, so do some of the new colonies outrun&mdash;against
time&mdash;the elder members of their own sisterhood.</p>
<p>Australia in the southern, first fruit of a more skilful
grafting, after the sundering of Britain's great limb in the
Western Hemisphere! The sturdy oak <em>must</em> stretch out its
strength. Lop off its branches on one side, the sound trunk
<i>will</i> force out its arms in freedom on the other. At the
moment when Boston stood forward first, and raised her violent
hand for closing the door in Britain's face, the bold grip of
James Cook was dragging open another for her welcome. In the very
month that the old ex-Governor of
Massachusetts&mdash;Pownall&mdash;was raising his voice in
warning to the House of Commons, and Lord North, Cook's,
reassurance by this South Land of Promise, on which he was about
to hoist his country's "Union Jack", was being logged down in the
cabin of the "Endeavour". Within seven years after the
capitulation of Lord Cornwallis, Sydney stood up, champion of the
Pacific! One year before Washington had been elected first
President of the United States of America, Arthur Phillip had
planted an acorn of the old oaktree on these shores, able to
vindicate the parentage of the United Kingdom, by a
growth&mdash;if the sap remain untainted&mdash;that shall
overshade even the lustre of her name and traditions.</p>
<p>The 4th of July, 1776, taught Great Britain a lesson to which
she and we have learned to trace the altered and more equitable
conditions under which the dispersed family of our countrymen may
remain united by interests, which, apart from sentiment and
genuine attachment, are substantial safeguards against
separation, or the desire for it, from herself as the axis of our
empire.</p>
<p>Exclusive of Van Dieman's Land, which became an appendage to
New South Wales in 1803, under pressure of penal needs of the
time. Western Australia did not stand in the same relation to the
mother colony as the districts now known as Victoria and
Queensland. The insular state of the one, and the immense
distance&mdash;by water only&mdash;of the other, were cogent
reasons for their early independence of the central government.
In the vain attempt of a speculative clique to apply the
exclusive theory of "what should be comfort in colonial life,"
promulgated by Gibbon Wakefield in 1829, there was no element of
<i>fraternité</i>, politically or socially, with neighbours who
had settled on the mainland under circumstances differing so much
from those of the hobby establishment of South Australia in 1831.
Consequently, New South Wales has had but two battles to fight in
defence of conservation of her first formed estate, which
encircled Victoria with the right, and Queensland with the left
arm. Between two such diademed supporters to her shield what
better emblazonment for William Charles Wentworth's "New
Britannia of another World" than his own native land?</p>
<p>I suppose that the "Genesis" of Queensland may be dated from
its "Exodus" from the borders of New South Wales. I must not be
interpreted by any irreverent metaphor, or transposal. I have an
Egyptian gipsy, gitano love for <i>all</i> Australia. For myself,
I see no claim on my attachments, which the mere limbs of her one
body and frame can make. Each limb has its function, and each has
no function without a pulse. The separate members of our empire
must have a heart.</p>
<p>What, then, led to the withdrawal of Victoria and Queensland
from the embrace of New South Wales?</p>
<p>So far back as 1840&mdash;I am not young enough now to go
further back with any assurance&mdash;the journal which most
precisely squared the claims of the colonial day, and grooved and
bevelled by the line of common sense for the people's pondering;
and dovetailed so handily the equity of public policy from the
Australian, with that of the Downing-street point of view, the
newspaper, rather news gatherer, clad so hardily in the
<i>Herald's</i> guise, by the honest hand of Charles Kemp, sent
forth a scare one day, which few who saw it can&mdash;where still
living witnesses&mdash;forget. 'Twas but a short leading
paragraph, "Rumoured Changes", in fact the first dissolving view
of separation, or rather subdivision independent of New South
Wales. The heat which it engendered was incompressible, the
fermentation explosive. And this first seed of a set purpose grew
like the roots of some of our gum trees, and by its growth burst
asunder the very rock from the fissures of which it sucked its
first life.</p>
<p>It ran as follows:&mdash;"It is rumoured that a despatch has
been received in town stating that it is in contemplation to
divide the present colony of New South Wales into three colonies:
Port Phillip, to the south; and Moreton Bay to the northward;
being formed into separate and independent colonies. We cannot
speak positively to the correctness of the report, but private
letters allude to something of the same sort, and in the Bill
laid before Parliament, by Lord John Russell, there is a clause
under which the division could be carried into effect. This
formation of the three colonies will be a capital Whig job: three
Governors: and three Supreme Courts, three Colonial Secretaries:
and hosts of subordinate officers will have to be appointed, and
that will be a sufficient reason for the adoption of the
measure."</p>
<p>It was evident from this preliminary protest that the cause
assigned for the desire on the part of the Home Government to
form several colonies out of New South Wales was that of opening
a broader field on which to gratify the lust of Home patronage.
The galling suspicion&mdash;and persuasion&mdash;even in those
dependent days, yeasted into out-spoken antagonism. On the 5th of
the next month, we find it simmering. The upset price of land in
Australia: the restrictions upon its sale had been, and yet were,
and were likely, too, to provide "bones to pick" on the
school-ground of antipodean politics, but this Damoclesian sword
scared for the time all camp followers prowling about this real
battle-field of self-preservation. "We alluded in a late number
to an intention on the part of the Home Government to divide the
present colony of New South Wales into three distinct colonies,
and as the last New South Wales bill laid before the House of
Commons by Lord John Russell contains clauses under which the
division can be carried into effect, we presume that it is the
intention of the Government to do so immediately. With respect to
the separation of Port Phillip from this colony, we are afraid it
would be more injurious to the inhabitants of that district than
to the colonists generally; but if, as rumoured, Moreton Bay and
the Big River" (the Clarence) "are to be formed into a separate
colony, it will be a serious blow to the prosperity of New South
Wales."</p>
<p>Again, on the 9th of December:&mdash;"This matter is exciting
considerable attention, and a public meeting, to address the
Queen against the proposed division of the colony, is being got
up, and will, we understand, be held in a few days, in order that
the opinion of the colonists upon the matter may be transmitted
to England by the first mail that leaves the colony after the
proposed separation had been made public.</p>
<p>"The money and labour of the colonists have been expended in
giving value to those portions of land that it is now intended to
form into separate colonies, for the benefit of a parcel of
land-sharks and speculators in England, and in order to provide
places for a host of needy adventurers, the hangers on of the
Whigs, by whom this shameful job is to be effected. So far as the
landing of emigrants at the nearest possible spot to the land,
the purchase money of which paid their passage out to the colony
under the bounty system, we entirely agree with the proposed
scheme; but that could have been effected without any division of
the colony. The separation of Port Phillip we have always
deprecated, but to call all the land to the southward of the
County St. Vincent part of the district of Port Phillip is
monstrous; whenever a division takes place it should be in the
neighbourhood of Twofold Bay.</p>
<p>"But the proposed boundary to the northward is even still more
absurd. Port Macquarie is as much part of this colony as
Maitland; and the Hunter might as well have been fixed upon for
the line of division as the Manning. The enterprise of the
colonists has explored the country between Moreton Bay and Port
Stephens, and now it is to be taken away and conferred upon a
clique, that has been striving to injure the colony for the last
five years&mdash;the land-jobbing South Australians. If it is
determined that the colony shall be divided, the southern
boundary of New South Wales should be Twofold Bay, and the
northern about fifty miles to the northward of Moreton Bay. Let
any one who does not understand the matter, trace upon the map
the proposed division lines, and he will at once see the iniquity
of the whole scheme."</p>
<p>What said the Legislative Council? On Tuesday, Dec. 8, 1840,
there were present: the Governor (Sir George Gipps); the Chief
Justice (Sir James Dowling); the Bishop of Australia (Dr.
Broughton); the Commander of the Forces (Sir Maurice O'Connell);
the Collector of Customs (Colonel Gibbes); the Auditor-General
(Lithgow); Alexander Berry; Blaxland, and Sir John Jamison.</p>
<p>After other business, the Governor said that "the next
despatch which he had to present related to those important
measures which were announced to the public in the newspapers on
Monday&mdash;that of separating New South Wales into three
distinct districts, evidently with the intention of dividing them
into separate colonies at no distant period; and when compared
with Lord John Russell's bill, there could be no doubt that it
was intended to divide the colony at
once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
With the despatch" (Lord John Russell's) "there was some
correspondence between the commissioners" (of the new Land and
Immigration Board) "and the Secretary of State", which His
Excellency did <i>not</i> lay upon the table.</p>
<p>The second clause in this bill was as follows: "And whereas
the said colony of New South Wales is of great extent, and it may
be fit that territories now comprised within the said colony
should be divided into separate colonies, and provision should be
made for the temporary administration of the government of any
such newly-divided colony as, not being comprised within the
limits hereinafter mentioned, may not possess a sufficient
population for the immediate establishment therein of the form of
government hereinbefore provided: Be it therefore enacted that
any thing hereinbefore contained to the contrary,
notwithstanding, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by letters
patent, to be from time to time issued under the Great Seal of
the United Kingdom, to define, as to Her Majesty shall seem meet,
the limits of the Colony of New South Wales and to erect into a
separate colony or colonies any <i>territories</i> which now are,
or which hereafter may be, comprised within the said Colony of
New South Wales: Provided always that no part of the territories
comprised within the nineteen existing counties of Argyle,
Bathurst, Bligh, Brisbane, Camden, Cook, Cumberland, Durham.
Georgiana, Gloucester, Hunter, King, Murray, Northumberland,
Phillip, Roxburgh, St. Vincent, Wellington, and Westmoreland, in
the said Colony of New South Wales, shall by any such letters
patent as aforesaid, be detached from the said Colony, but that
each of the said nineteen counties shall form part of the said
Colony of New South Wales."</p>
<p>A leading article appeared on the 11th December, headed
"Dismemberment of the Colony." A motion, of which the Bishop had
given notice, had been carried in the Legislative Council
unanimously, by which a Committee, of which the Bishop was
Chairman, was appointed to prepare an address to the Queen upon
the subject. "We trust," are the concluding words, "that our
fellow-colonists will second the efforts of our legislators, by
calling a public meeting immediately, and get up such a
remonstrance to Her Majesty, as will make the ears of the Whig
Secretary of State tingle with shame and apprehension."</p>
<p>On the 12th December, after a lengthy address to the
Legislative Council, the Bishop concluded with moving the
adoption of the following resolution&mdash;"That the Council,
under a serious apprehension of the injury likely to be sustained
by the colony of New South Wales in regard to its staple produce,
and the important interests of the revenue, commerce and
population through the dismemberment of so large a portion of
territory now annexed to it as would be occasioned by the
adoption of the limits assigned by the Royal Instructions of May
22, 1840, do present a humble and dutiful address to Her Majesty
soliciting Her Majesty's gracious re-consideration of the same,
and praying that Her Majesty will be pleased to appoint such
other limits to the colony as may best secure the courses of the
principal rivers within the territory which have been discovered
and explored by the enterprise and at the expense of the
settlers; and in addition to the nineteen counties of which it is
proposed that the colony shall consist, may preserve the union of
one government of those districts beyond the present limits of
location, which have not only been peopled from this colony, and
occupied by stock, the property of residents within it, but must
always continue united with it by the closest ties of common
origin and interest."</p>
<p>Richard Jones (afterwards member for the Stanley Boroughs)
said that "the news had come upon the colony like a thunderbolt.
He must again lament that the colony had no one to represent it,
we are at the mercy of every wind that blows. It is seldom that
the rumour of an event is followed by the event so soon as this
was. But the first intimation that was received of the matter in
this colony, was in a private letter from Sir Thomas Mitchell,
which came, he imagined, by the same vessel that conveyed
directions to His Excellency to carry the measure into effect. At
present it would appear that the colony is not, in future, to be
governed by the Secretary of State, but by the Emigration Board,
from whom these instructions emanated, not with the intention of
benefiting the colony, but in order to create patronage, for had
there not been something of that sort in view the commissioners
would not have recommended the dismemberment of this fine colony
into a number of petty local governments. If the present
instructions are literally carried into effect, the colony will
be like a body without arms."</p>
<p>"All the fine rivers which have been discovered and explored
at the expense of the colonists are to be swept away from us.
This colony is to be restricted within nineteen counties, but the
colonies to the north and southward of us may have an indefinite
number. In all views of the matter the patronage must not be lost
sight of. In the first place there is to be always a large
surveying staff, and in the next there will be two entire
governments established. Where is the money to come from? Is this
colony to be plundered to establish colonies on the very land
that belongs to us, and of which we are to be deprived? We have
assisted Port Phillip; we have assisted New Zealand; and we shall
have to assist the new colony of Moreton Bay! One thing is
evident, and that is that the expenses of the local government
must be diminished, for if our sources of prosperity are to be
cut off from us, we shall not be able to support our present
establishment much longer. When this colony was first formed, it
was simply and literally a penal settlement; afterwards the
government sought out a number of respectable individuals and
induced them to come out by promising them assistance, in order
that by their influence and industry they might have an effect
upon the convict population: afterwards emigrants were induced to
leave England, simply by grants of land, which was continued for
some years; and during all that time, people were selecting the
best lands in the colony: then the system of purchase was
introduced, but still it was by selection; and the consequence
naturally is that nearly all the best land in the nineteen
counties is gone. Colonel Torrens, the greatest enemy that the
colony ever had, was transferred from the old South Australian
Board to the new Land and Emigration Board, and he will ruin the
colony if he can."</p>
<p>So Hannibal Macarthur said, that "this subject involves so
many matters of deep importance to the colony, that he could not
approach it without trembling. One honourable gentleman had said,
that the matter came upon the colony like a thunderbolt, he would
say, rather like an earthquake, for it is probable that it will
involve the colony in one universal ruin, not only this colony,
but the colony of which Melbourne is the capital, and that which
is to be formed at Moreton Bay."</p>
<p>"Lord John Russell was misled by parties having sinister
views. If the instructions are to be literally carried into
effect, they will ruin the colony. There was one thing that
occurred to him as a grand inconsistency, that at the very time
the whole energies of the government were devoted to effecting
the union of the two Canadas,* they should be making arrangements
for the division of this colony, which has hitherto been doing so
well."</p>
<p class="foot">[* "<span class="u">Canadas</span>."&mdash;Canada
was divided into the Upper and Lower Provinces, and a
Constitution established in George the Third's reign, in 1791;
and after the insurrection of 1837-8, the two provinces were
reunited in our Queen's reign, on 23rd July, 1840; and the
confederation of these British North American provinces was
proclaimed as the "Dominion of Canada" on the 21st May, 1867,
with which British Columbia became incorporated on April,
1871.]</p>
<p>James Macarthur said that "if the proposed measures were
persisted in, he feared they would lead to consequences which he
almost trembled to
contemplate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
He believed that the party in the House of Commons called the
'Wakefieldians', which advocates the principles first promulgated
by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, conscientiously believe that those
principles will be most conducive to the interests of the
colony." The honourable gentleman proceeded to dissect the
Wakefieldian system, and challenged its success, descanted on the
proposed boundaries, and declared that "the colony has been
explored and surveyed at the expense of the colonists: the home
government did nothing. In 1828, when application was made to the
home government, they would not allow five thousand pounds for
the furtherance of exploring the colony, and he could mention
that at that time it was suggested that the present Governor of
Van Dieman's Land should take charge of the expedition, which he,
having been in the colony many years ago as a midshipman, and
feeling some zeal in the cause, was not unwilling to do. Even the
surveys of the coast of Australia were carried on in a great
degree by the resources of New South Wales. Captain King,** to
whom the mercantile community and the interests of science are so
much indebted, was not even supplied by the Admiralty with a
ship, but was sent out here, when a vessel&mdash;'Mermaid',
cutter&mdash;was purchased for him, and he entered upon the
arduous service in a little vessel that was totally inadequate to
the service and a disgrace to the Empire, and succeeded in his
perilous enterprise in a manner that reflected the highest credit
on himself and officers. The river Brisbane was first discovered
by a coasting vessel, and afterwards explored by Mr. Oxley.***
Port Macquarie, which is to be torn from us, was discovered by
Oxley on his return from one of his expeditions into the interior
in 1818. Soon after a penal settlement was formed there. A few
years ago it was thrown open, and is now one of the most
flourishing districts in the
colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We have given great additional value to the land beyond the
boundaries of the nineteen counties by the occupation of them by
our flocks and
herds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
One circumstance that had been lost sight of was that if other
countries receive population and assistance, and have additional
value given to them by New South Wales, why should they not pay
for it? Let a debtor and creditor account be struck between New
South Wales and the new colony. Let the colony be charged with
the extreme value given to land by our colonists, and let us
receive something like compensation. Lord John Russell wished the
land to be divided into eighty-acre sections. He (J. Macarthur)
was at a loss to know what for. If it would enable persons of
small capital to buy land and settle down it would be desirable;
but it would have no such effect. It was the germ of the South
Australian system, enabling parties to go over a whole side of
country for a few small sections."</p>
<p class="foot">[** Son of the late Governor King.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This does not tally with other
accounts.]</p>
<p>The Governor, of course, could not approach the question, but
there were two points, on which he would say a few words. "In the
first place, members would recollect that all great alterations
made respecting the disposal of land were unpalatable at first.
Members would recollect the great dissatisfaction that existed
when the free grant system was done away with, the opinion then
was that the colony was ruined! Then the upset price was raised
from five shillings to twelve&mdash;and here he could speak from
personal knowledge&mdash;the same ruin was equally anticipated,
the same feelings indulged in." His Excellency! I proceeded to
consider the South Australian system and the working of the land
sale schemes, as yet applied in New South Wales and Port Phillip.
"He could not, however, for a moment admit that these regulations
had been framed for the purpose of injuring New South Wales, did
not himself advocate the South Australian principle," and
commented on the benefits derived by distant parts from their
contiguity and supply of stock from New South Wales.</p>
<p>"With respect to the division of Port Phillip, after the
experience he had in governing it at a distance of six hundred
miles, he could only say he should be glad to be relieved of the
responsibility."
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"He was very glad when Mr. La Trobe arrived to assist him, and
since then it has been La Trobe's administration, rather than
his" (the
Governor's).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"He could not doubt the right of Her Majesty's prerogative to
make new colonies, but he must say that this colony was
short-coated; shaved very close; but if the proposed limits were
persevered in, which, after the petition of the Council he hoped
would not be the case, he did not think it would put an end to
the prosperity of the colony." In the course of his address Sir
George Gipps remarked that "the term squatter is hardly a proper
word; in America it signifies a person who has only twenty or
thirty, acres of land which he occupies unauthorisedly: it means
something petty: it does not mean the occupier of ten thousand
acres: they have no idea of such a magnificent squatter as that.
The sons of the richest men in the colony are literally
'squatters': nay! the young men of some of the best families in
England, graduates of Oxford and Cambridge are now living in bark
huts beyond the boundaries."
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"The separation of the colony, it must be remembered, would only
hand over the districts to another power of the British Empire:
if it was a foreign power it would be different: but he did not
see that there would necessarily arise any evil out of the
districts belonging to another colony."
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"When he was at Demarara people held property in the neighbouring
Colony of Berbice * which was under a different government, and
he never heard of any evil arising. Certainly these colonies have
since been united and now form the colony of British Guiana, and
he must admit, with the honourable member, that there was
something anomalous in the circumstance of the government
choosing the very time that they were uniting the Canadas for the
dismemberment of this colony. He would not say that he considered
the measure politic; but if the division were persisted in he did
not himself foresee those evils which alarmed so many honourable
members."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Berbice was settled by the Dutch between
1580-1626: with Demarara, another Dutch colony, it surrendered to
the British in 1796; both were restored to the Dutch by the
treaty of Amiens in 1796, and retaken by the British in 1803, and
were ceded to England with Essequibo by the treaty of Paris,
August, 1814, and united in 1831 as British Guiana.]</p>
<p>The Auditor-General preferred that "the petition of the
council was against dismemberment rather than for a
re-consideration of the boundaries. Much as he was interested in
the welfare and prosperity of Sydney, he would sooner see
Melbourne made the seat of government, than that the colony
should be dismembered." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The most truly patriotic public declaration
ever made under this question.]</p>
<p>The Bishop said that he "considered the separation as
virtually effected: and Her Majesty's right to erect a new
province not being to be disputed, all that could be done was to
ask her to be graciously pleased to alter the boundaries in such
a way as to be the least injury to the colony."</p>
<p>Question put and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>The prayer of the petition&mdash;as drafted was: "That your
Majesty will be pleased to take under your gracious
re-consideration the instructions herein referred to by us, with
a view to the partial modification in the particulars above
expressed. We entreat your Majesty's gracious goodness to appoint
that the northern boundary of the central Colony of New South
Wales may be a line drawn from near Cape Howe to the source of
the river Hume, or Murray; and thenceforth by the course of that
river until it reaches the 141st deg. of East Longitude; and that
the northern boundary may be the 28th Parallel of South Latitude,
from the sea coast to the same 141st deg. of East Longitude."</p>
<p>It does not come within my province to reproduce, or remark
upon that part of the "Instructions"&mdash;which had been drawn
up under the influence of the Commissioners of the New Land and
Emigration Board in London,&mdash;which lays down the alteration
of the method and price, under which it was proposed in future to
sell Crown lands, at this date. The main feature therein was but
a true reflexion of the Wakefield system&mdash;tested in South
Australia, viz.: a fixed price for a selected area, instead of
<i>emptio ab hastâ!</i>&mdash;sale by auction, from an upset
price, having been the means hitherto ordained by the
Council&mdash;the Governor's and the Bishop's votes having
carried the advisability of that process on a by gone occasion,
in the interests of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Governor said he should "have much pleasure" in
transmitting this petition.</p>
<p>It is&mdash;to me, at least&mdash;amusing, as well as
interesting and instructive, to look back upon the past
disturbing trials of our country, and observe&mdash;with a start,
I confess, of consciousness <i>now</i>, that by what is
carelessly called accident, trifling incidents have so faithfully
prevented&mdash;as a true and classical expression&mdash;our
career to its present status, and why not yet be so waiting upon
our future? I do not, then, feel myself free to omit the little
episode in the "kneading" of separation of this land, into which
the home-baked instructions of 1840 had dropped the first leaven.
A mischievous design is apparent under the following disclosures,
which are worth considering.</p>
<p>In the <i>Herald</i> of December 19, 1840, a few words
appeared, which cast oil upon the bubbling: "Thanks to the
gentlemen who drew the attention of Sir Robert Peel to the
proposed dismemberment of the colony, <i>it will not be carried
into effect at present</i>; or, at least, if it be, it will not
be with the authority of Parliament; and, therefore, there are
still hopes of the colony. Ministers say that there was no
intention to do more than separate New Zealand from New South
Wales; and, as they are all 'honourable men', we are bound to
believe them. But we must say, that if that was the original
intention, there was a strange multiplicity of words in the
clauses at first introduced. Notwithstanding the denial of the
Ministry, we still believe that" (the reducing of New South
Wales) "was the intention of the person who drew the bill,
although he might have misunderstood his instructions."</p>
<p>These words were founded upon an interesting article, taken
from the <i>Colonial Gazette</i> of the 5th of last August,
published in London:&mdash;"The oldest of the Australian
settlements, after having endured half a century, is governed by
a provisional authority, whose power is renewed from year to year
by an annual bill, usually designated in its title as a
'Continuance' Bill. Such a state of matters has been for some
years strongly reprobated, but it was not until this session that
the Secretary of State for the Colonies had undergone sufficient
of the pressure from without, to yield a new plan of Government
to the squeezing process. At last, however, a bill appears. The
New South Wales Government is to be placed on a permanent
footing? Not at all. The Secretary's heart misgave him at the
prospect of really passing so large a measure. The bill was
withdrawn, and another bill brought in to supply the annual
exigency. The second measure proceeded rapidly on its course; the
first bill was withdrawn at the second reading, on the 13th of
July; the new bill was introduced and read a first time on the
22nd, and it was first seen in print on the 24th, and read a
second time on the same day; it passed committee on the 25th; it
was reported on the 27th. But here something seemed to be the
matter. Something in the bill had excited suspicion; it was not a
mere 'Continuation' Bill. Sir Robert Peel said that he had
received a petition founded probably on a misconstruction of the
measure. Was it meant to empower government to separate New
Zealand from New South Wales? Mr. Goulburn, too, remarked that
the bill would enable Ministers to separate New South Wales into
as many governments as they pleased! It is not usual for
'Continuation' Bills to contain provisions of such a trenchant
nature, and certainly the one in question possessed a feature of
sufficient novelty."</p>
<p>In the first bill, which bears the names of Lord John Russell
and Mr. Vernon Smith as the introducers; in the bill which was
withdrawn at the second reading, and, of course, before
discussion, there was one very equivocal looking clause. However,
that bill was taken out of the way altogether, and no one
troubled himself about examining its lifeless members. Who could
have looked to a mere "Continuance" Bill for the most doubtful
clause of an undiscussed original measure? Yet, there it was! The
bill, then, was more than a mere "Continuance", Bill, it was a
bill to "divide the territory of New South Wales!" There was
nothing dangerous in it, however, for Mr. Vernon Smith assured
Sir Robert Peel that it was only meant to separate New Zealand
from New South Wales; and he endeavoured to soothe Mr. Goulburn's
alarm by deprecating a "forced construction!" It is a curious
circumstance that Mr. Vernon Smith's name is not attached to the
new bill, but it bears that of Sir George Grey instead. Well,
this bill went on, it was read a third time, and passed with
amendments on the 29th. The bill is brought next day to the
Lords; but how changed! The measure which Mr. Vernon Smith
thought so harmless had its claws pared: the suspicious part has
been re-modelled! We subjoin the two clauses, that which appeared
on the first bill, and was copied into the second, and the new
clause which takes its place in the bill sent up to the Lords.
This is the first clause. (It is that embodied as the second
clause in the bill cited at the meeting of the Legislative
Council, and laid upon the table by the Governor on Tuesday, the
8th of December.)</p>
<p>"This is the harmless clause made safe!</p>
<p>"And whereas the said Colony of New South Wales is of great
extent, and it may be fit that certain dependencies of the said
colony shall be formed into separate colonies and provision
should be made for the temporary administration of the Government
of any such newly-erected colony: be it therefore enacted that it
shall be lawful for Her Majesty by Letters Patent to be from time
to time issued under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom to
erect into a separate colony or colonies any <i>islands</i> which
now are, or which hereafter may be, comprised within the
dependencies of the Colony of New South Wales."</p>
<p>"By 'islands', of course New Zealand is intended; but why not
name the thing meant? But straightforward language is not always
so easy as it may seem to some common honest folk: for habit is
strong. But where was the need for the change? Lord John Russell
saw none; or he would not have put his name to the original bill.
Simple Mr. Vernon Smith knew nothing of any ulterior intention
which the bill was to subserve! Yet it is far more reasonable to
suppose that some knavery was meant, than to imagine that any
official was idiot enough to think that it would require a
sufficient power to cut New South Wales to pieces in order to
sever the not-very-intimately-connected Colony of New Zealand!
Lord John Russell knows nothing about it. Mr. Vernon Smith
smiles, unconscious of the fault in which he is detected; Sir
George Grey most likely knows as little about the drift of the
bill as about the fact of his name being on it! Who is the knave
behind, then? Can it be other than Mr. Mother-country? Power was
wanted to set New Zealand free: a very proper object. Why not ask
for it, then, in plain terms? Was it that an opportunity of
smuggling an unlimited power of jobbing, where detection was the
worst failure that could be apprehended, was too tempting to be
resisted? The power, which was required for a legitimate purpose
might covertly be framed so as to serve the vicious wants of Mr.
Mother-country and his hungry retainers! And so, to forestall the
profligate desires of Mr. Mother-country, a large and most
important colony is to be insulted and alarmed by a threat that
it is to be brought to the axe! This is the way the colonies are"
(were) "governed"&mdash;forty-seven years ago!</p>
<p>At the public meeting held on the 8th of January, 1841, to
petition against dismemberment, the feeling of indignation was
intense, but brought out no new grounds of objection. However,
Captain O'Connell&mdash;in after years Sir Maurice, and President
of the Legislative Council of Queensland&mdash;said that "it had
ever been the persuasion of all persons connected with the
colony, either as administrator of the government or as colonists
in it, that the territory of New South Wales extended over all
that part of New Holland which is contained within the country
described in the Governor's commission, viz., "from the northern
cape or extremity of the coast, called Cape York, in the latitude
of 10 deg. 37 min. S. to the southern extremity of the said
territory of New South Wales, or Wilson's Promontory, in the
latitude of 39 deg. 12 min. S., and all the country inland to the
westward as far as the 129th degree of east longitude, except the
province of South Australia." T. Barker, J. Bowman, P.L.
Campbell, R. Campbell, jun., J.B. Darvall, G.K. Holden, Captain
King, R.N., J. Bettington, John Lord, Rev. R. Mansfield, James
Macarthur, M.C., W. Macarthur, G. McLeay, James Mitchell, Captain
O'Connell, Sir John Jamison, and the Rev. Hesketh, were appointed
a committee to take the necessary steps to forward the petition
to Her Majesty.</p>
<p>Another meeting was held on the 6th February, 1841, to
petition both houses of Parliament against the proposed
dismemberment. James Macarthur spoke at length, and
remarked&mdash;"It must be remembered that had it not been for
the interposition of Sir Robert Peel and Mr. Goulburn at this
very moment, the colony would have been actually
tri-sected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The public press of England universally concurs upon this point
with the opinions of the colonists, that it was an intention of
cutting up the colony in such a way as would give a decent share
of patronage to those concerned in the dismemberment. He thought
that he made it sufficiently clear that unless the colonists
express their sentiments upon the subject the project of
dismemberment will be
revived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Sir Francis Mitchell recommended the river Boyne for the northern
boundary of New South Wales."</p>

<p><span class="a">That</span> itchy and irritating
boil&mdash;home patronage, always dangerous, if it burst
inwardly, to the Ministry of the day&mdash;seeking less risky
relief by discharge of political and patrician "pus" into
colonial channels, had for some time been endured in a humour
inflamed more and more by inert discontent.</p>
<p>This first abortive attempt made by Downing-street to effect
separation in so remarkable a manner, by no means smoothed down
the temper of the colonists. About this time, too. Captain Innes,
who had long been a deservedly popular and efficient Chief
Magistrate was superseded from England by Miles, and this
exercise of authority elicited tones&mdash;and groans&mdash;from
the press and public, which the design of bringing New South
Wales "to the axe" sharpened to a very keen edge. Price of land;
method of sale; the separation itself were&mdash;from what I
recollect as well as gather&mdash;but cloaks over the fashion of
feeling which fed the phrases with which the despatch
instructions and bill were befouled. To be used as a convenient
platform for dirty work shot out from <i>our</i> antipodes was
intolerable! "Separation" of our colonies, was the cry, "shall be
no matter of jobbery; if it ever come, it shall display broad
phylacteries, and wear clean linen!"</p>
<p class="poemw">"O that estates, degrees and offices,<br>
Were not derived corruptly! and that clear honour<br>
Were purchased by the <i>merit</i> of the wearer!<br>
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned<br>
From the true seeds of honour! and how much honour<br>
Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times<br>
To be new garnished."</p>
<p>Ah! when a division <i>was</i> made, it was on grounds very
distinct from those on which it had thus far been planned. But
the parent's hand had set the game going, and the children were
sure to join in it.</p>
<p>The home pack had had their first meet on Australian soil, had
drawn the first cover, and made a blank day of it. The "Hunt" was
now to be on colonial ground. A "cloudy day" of New South Wales
had cheered outsiders from a distance out of any chance of
disappointment of a fine run, few checks and a capital "finish".
Port Phillip&mdash;three parts bred&mdash;carried his rider,
Leslie Foster (the kid-gloved huntsman), with some little
distress over the ploughed ground in the first burst. Separation
in full view, the "tally-ho" of the trans-Murrayians was repeated
in echoes from over the water, and Foster, the Count Battyani of
the "Melbourne Hunt", pulled himself well together for the stiff
timber which he met with.</p>
<p>Somewhat apart from the rest of the field, at a corner of the
cover side, watching the throw-off and waiting for a whimper, sat
patiently the portly person of the prominent preacher and
politician. Dr. Lang, mounted upon a parti-coloured&mdash;I mean
a piebald&mdash;quadruped suggestive of a circus; but which,
however slow over the grass, was of wonderful "bottom". The
reverend gentleman from his thorough knowledge of the country and
the line likely to betaken over it, was always well up at the
death, at which his "whoo-hoop" would out-ring and drown less
practised lungs. He, in sombre garb, but with bright eye
"spotted" them all as they "got away" till he could make sure of
no mistake in his own cutting across "to pick 'em up" fresh, and
with plenty of "go" in his nag, when the field had "tailed off"
from the one or two who might stagger in for blooding the pack.
Then there was "Bob" Lowe, high up on a fidgetty, fretful, bony,
white-stocking'd chesnut, whose heels were a caution to any
luckless wight whose approach from behind provoked the relish of
a kick, which, if it was denied the treat, would bite its nearest
neighbour within reach, sooner than forego it, a brute which
"Bob" loved to mount, but could not ride. "Bob" could sit the
beast, but had no "hand" on its mouth; disdained the snaffle,
preferred the "Iron Duke", and was merciless with whip and spur.
For all this the animal would go no faster: only his own pace.
And who was that looker-on so splendidly mounted, man and horse
part and parcel of each other, a thorough English squire, I
should say; can ride straight, I'll be bound! No "craning" for
such a man as that! Why, 'tis John Campbell on his "Old Honesty".
He'll never make for a gap, if he can jump what's before him, and
there are few things the old horse can't jump&mdash;for the love
of going straight.</p>
<p>Little fear of "Separation" going to earth again now! The
earth-stoppers had been biding this time for a long while. There
was no rabbit-burrow in those days for the refuge of so wary a
political "varmint". In view, the whole run was "pumping" to all
but him of the "cloth". The "pull-down", glorious to all but the
"ruck" from New South Wales, who were dead-beat over such a
stone-wall country. Some old "Nimrod in Magazine" may be found
which gives the details of the "doublings", the "dodges", the
"try-backs" on that memorable occasion; 'tis not for me to
attempt it; but the recollection of it among men bent on such
pursuits has since nerved them and others to similiar exploits,
over ground then untried, but over which the riding has been
found to be deceptively easy since. Right loyally was the "brush"
presented to our Queen&mdash;Victoria!</p>
<p>Separation-hunting and fox-hunting seem to me to go
hand-in-hand in their legitimate object. In either field it
effects extinction of "vermin" which fatten on the hen-roosts out
of reach of protection, assistance and regard. So at each meet
are seen new faces set towards special service, and as the claims
upon such service extend themselves, each falls in with fresh
"covers to draw"&mdash;fresh centres of action&mdash;in which
"sure finds" of the domestic enemy&mdash;of inequitable dealing
with outside public rights, and with security of private
interests will be hounded out and pulled down in "the open",
however hard the run. A jubilant end to the hard day's work!</p>
<p>And now let us dismount and walk over the ground, to the main
features of which, that of Moreton Bay before long&mdash;and the
Home scheme had already made the entrances of the northern and
southern land&mdash;had to run her steeplechase, bore much
resemblance. Recalling the introduction of representative
government into New South Wales, of which Governor Sir George
Gipps informed Lord Stanley by a despatch dated the 18th of July,
1843, being the first parliamentary election that had ever yet
taken place in Australia, we find that Dr. Lang almost
immediately took a preliminary step in view of separation of Port
Phillip by moving that a return of the revenue and expenditure of
that dependency should be printed. The result was highly
favourable to its credit. In August, 1844, he moved that a
petition be drawn up to the Queen praying for its dismemberment
from New South Wales. Dr. Lang was one of the six representatives
elected by the southern constituencies to represent the district
of Port Phillip in the new Assembly. His <i>confrères</i> at
first were: Henry Condell, Charles Hotson Ebden, Thomas Walker,
Charles Nicholson, and Alexander Thomson. Besides these there
were eighteen members chosen by the people of New South Wales and
twelve nominees&mdash;six official, being the Lieutenant-General
in Command of Her Majesty's Forces, the Colonial Secretary, the
Colonial Treasurer, the Auditor-General, the Collector of
Customs, and the Colonial Engineer; six un-official: Richard
Jones, Alexander Berry, John Blaxland, Thomas Icely, Edward
Hamilton, and Hastings Elwin.</p>
<p>"In the November before, Richard Jones had, by resignation,
made room for Robert Lowe&mdash;known at Oxford as 'Bob
Lowe'&mdash;and there had been some changes among the Port
Phillip members; for we find that of the original six but the
names of three among the 'ayes' on division. Dr. Lang's motion
being defeated by nineteen. His supporters upon the occasion, as
well as Dr. Lang, made able and brilliant appeals&mdash;of course
in vain. Lowe 'hoped and believed that the time was not remote
when Great Britain would give up the idea of treating the
dependencies of the Crown as children, who were to be cast adrift
by their parent as soon as they arrived at manhood, and
substitute for it the wiser and nobler policy of knitting herself
and her colonies into one mighty confederacy, girdling the earth
in its circumference, and confident against the world in arts and
arms.' Neither could he 'agree that the separation would be
otherwise than injurious, to some extent at least, to New South
Wales. It implied the loss of a fertile and wealthy province
already paying much more into the Treasury than it drew out of
it.' And he was 'fearful also that a separation might be attended
with that animosity and ill feeling which are so apt to prevail
between neighbouring states, and that the result might be a war
of tariffs and restrictive duties, which he held in utter horror
and aversion; but still, compelled by the force of truth and
justice, he was bound to say that these considerations came too
late; because,' he contended, 'the administration of the district
had been, from the first, conducted upon a system distinct from
the rest of New South Wales.'"</p>
<p>Disruption was, in fact, a corollary to the growth of our
Australian vast, little organised, and imperfectly developed
territories.</p>
<p>In no wise daunted by a result so natural, Dr. Lang with his
well-known tenacity of purpose at once framed a memorial, which,
after receiving the signatures of the six members for Port
Phillip&mdash;B. Boyd, Thos. Walker, Adolphus W. Young, Charles
Nicholson, John Dunmore Lang, and John P. Robinson&mdash;the last
named being the representative of Melbourne&mdash;was forwarded
by the Governor, Sir George Gipps, to the Secretary of State, in
January, 1845. In this document the population was stated to have
been twenty-five thousand two years before, and the revenue to
have exceeded £61,000. The stock being set down as two million
sheep; one hundred and forty thousand head of cattle; and five
thousand horses.</p>
<p>This memorial was re-submitted to the Governor, who was
directed to report thereon, after laying the matter before the
Executive Council of New South Wales; at the same time. Lord
Stanley signified his concurrence with the views held by the
southern district. In 1846 the Secretary for the Colonies was
infoi-med of the approval of such separation by the Governor and
the majority of the Executive Council, which elicited the
assurance from London, that the steps necessary to effect such
separation would be at once taken, under an act to be obtained
from the Imperial Parliament.</p>
<p>Change of Ministry deferred the hope of the Port Phillipians.
So sickened were they by the disappointment, year by year, that
they voluntarily disfranchised themselves, in the intensity of
disgust at having to send representatives to the Legislative
Council in Sydney: having no men, they said, who could leave home
and bread-winning-work for the sterile campaign of "rejected
addresses" in New South Wales: and they would "no more on't."</p>
<p>The fair province asserting herself, then over the Murray,
compelled a recognition of her existence by bearding the Hon in
the Downing-street den: "You, my Lord Grey, now Right Honourable
Secretary of State shall represent ourselves and report our
sorrows to your own boudoir: you, in the fashion of elected
member of our metropolis, shall open the eyes of your sleepy
coadjutors at home to the haziness of their views and the
uncertainty of the sounds in their ears, by pleading our
righteous demands. Upon Leslie Foster, your rejected opponent,
shall <i>not</i> fall your mantle until he wear it in our own
Legislative Chamber, which <i>you</i> shall unlock to our
independent action!" Happy thought! Hoisted between the horns of
the ludicrous dilemma, my Lord Grey could not ignore the position
for fear of being spitted on the point of one or the other:
neglect of the exercise of the high function which he had
succeeded to, or the odium ever attached to putting aside a
concession made by a previous Ministry.</p>
<p>As far back as 1840 the discontent had begun to sprout. A
meeting had been convened in Bourke-street, Melbourne, to
petition for separation from New South Wales. Sydney had entered
the ring and stood up against it; henceforward round after round,
year by year, had been watched with increasing excitement and
bitterness. Eleven years of wrestling here, and importunity at
home had to wear out the unjust judge seated in Downing-street,
before Port Phillip was avenged of her adversary. The flat went
forth at length from the British Parliament on August 5th, 1857,
and was sealed in the year following.</p>
<p>To the northern districts, there were not wanting the same
broad grounds on which Port Phillip had founded her claim to
separation from New South Wales, and had built hopes not far from
fulfilment. It is needless to go over them again.</p>
<p>But in the case of Port Phillip there was an absence of the
overpowering motive which initiated the movement at Moreton
Bay.</p>
<p>In November of the year 1849, the squatters, at their wits'
end for want of hands, and hopeless of any share of the unusually
large infllux of immigrants, who had arrived and were yet
arriving, called a meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
taking an extreme step&mdash;by Petition to the Secretary of the
Colonies&mdash;towards the re-introduction of convicts, who,
under the softened description of "exile", "ticket-of-leave
holders", might supply the need of the northern pastoralists,
together with the simultaneous landing of a proportionate number
of free labourers. The purpose was not only at variance with the
wishes of the people of the northern districts, <i>outside</i>
squatterdom, but in direct opposition to the general cry from the
Cape of Good Hope, and all Australia, from Cape Leeuwin to Cape
York, not excepting New Zealand, "that no more transported
criminals should be landed on their shores."</p>
<p>Dr. Lang, with heated energy, had been and yet was trying to
enlist cotton powers, sugar powers, agricultural powers of all
and any promise, to serve as "buffers" to the impact of the
pastoral power with the advance of other more popular interests,
which were not out of the reach of the mass congregated in towns,
villages and suburban spots; and by the prosperity and
development of avocations other than the pastoral, counterbalance
the influence so paramount in the land&mdash;that of the
stockholders: the graziers, who were spreading themselves over
such immense and distant tracts. To serve such new suggestions,
however, he had set his face against the use of any but free
European labour. The Secretary of State for the Colonies was, at
this time, in great difficulty because of the stout protests made
by the colonies of the south against the reception of any more
prisoners of the Crown. To the proposed memorial for the
resumption of transportation to Moreton Bay, the hope of
separation from New South Wales was to be an appended suggestion:
a hope which was well based upon the promised "<i>douceur</i>" of
relieving the Minister in his strait as to the disposal of
criminals from Home. And so the independence coveted by all the
community of the north, pastoral and urban, was set up as a prize
to be competed for on two hostile platforms. From Port Phillip,
Dr. Lang had transferred his attentions to Brisbane, and became a
prominent advocate for the severance of Moreton Bay from the
mother colony. Dr. Lang had been, from the end of 1846, and was
still in England, for purposes explained in a letter now
reproduced from the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of the 11th of
March, 1850. He had done much in a general manner towards bending
public inclination to the wish for extending the principle of
separation absolutely to the relation of Australia to the old
country. "Cutting the painter" had become a kind of popular
watchword, adopted from Dr. Lang's doctrine. It was ingeniously
devised to inoculate opinion but failed in the intent. Perhaps
the reverend gentleman had overlooked the necessity that the
unseaworthy craft must have dropped astern of the full-rigged
ship which had hitherto been towing it towards a safe haven, in
spite of foul weather. It was even said that Dr. Lang had
proposed "Cooksland" to be the proclaimed name of the colony to
be separated: yet that of "Queensland" was gladly and loyally
hailed, in the end.</p>
<p>And thus with "separation", decently cloaked under "resumption
of transportation", the eventful year 1850 opened the gates of
the Temple of Janus. The past and the future broke out into
strife in the districts of the north. In detecting the elements
of the conflict, the <i>Herald</i>, fairly and honestly, I think,
gives a true analysis. On the 7th January, 1850. "Moreton Bay"
(from our correspondent). "From rumours flying about, there is
every reason to believe the squatters intend at the
transportation meeting, fixed to come off on the 10th inst., 'to
go the entire animal! slaves they will have, either black or
white; Coolies or Christians, if their unholy prayers are
listened to.'" At this time the arrival of the "Neptune", with
convicts, at the Cape of Good Hope, was much exciting popular
feeling and indignation here and there. 8th January. "There has
never been a more successful opposition than that with which the
Cape Colonists have, on this occasion, resisted the insidious
attempts" (of Lord Grey) "to convert their colony into a penal
settlement." 9th January. "In spite of the resistance to the
resumption of transportation to the colonies the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, in July last, declares, that 'numbers of the colonies
are willing to receive England's convicts!'" Was Moreton Bay in
the eye of the writer? January 19th. Brings out the vexed
question&mdash;very vexing to Dr. Lang&mdash;of the famous
land-orders in a leading article. It is worthy of attention in
connection with his letter, addressed to Lord Grey, by-and-by.
"We inserted in our paper of the 17th instant, a letter from Mr.
J. Richardson, of Brisbane, in answer to one we had previously
published from Mr. Frederick Wilkinson, Surgeon Superintendent of
the 'Lima', reflecting on the conduct of the Rev. Dr. Lang as
dishonest, and on that of Mr. Richardson as discourteous. His
quasi-agent, Mr. Richardson, is particularly anxious to defend
himself from the minor charge, but, while affecting to treat with
contempt the serious accusation which Dr. Wilkinson has brought
against Dr. Lang, and pointing out with an air of triumph some
important inaccuracies in Dr. Wilkinson's statements, he has not
left the reverend gentlemen altogether unshielded, but in really
a more afflicting position than before. <em>Magna est veritas, et
prævalebit</em>.</p>
<p>"Dr. Wilkinson said that Mr. Richardson had stated to him that
Dr. Lang had given orders on him for £1200, and £400, and £600,
as well as for Dr. Wilkinson's balance of salary, and no means
placed in the hands of the drawee by the drawer for satisfying
them, but asserts that the £600 was wholly imaginary. Does this
exaggeration alter the moral character of the offence? If a man
draws upon a person in the knowledge that there are no funds or
effects to meet his drafts, is it of any vital importance (except
to the individual sufferers) whether the drafts be for £600 or
£1,200? In the eye of the law and reason, what does it matter
whether the order be for little or mickle? <i>Magna est veritas,
et prævalebit</i>.</p>
<p>"This piece of truth cannot now be concealed nor vindicated.
This much we have thought ourselves entitled to say respecting
the facts put forth by Dr. Wilkinson, because we understand that
gentleman has proceeded to England, and cannot himself reply to
Mr. Richardson's comments." "We confess we have been not a little
surprised by Mr. Richardson's assertion that 'the passengers per
'Lima' have got their land.' Our advices from Moreton Bay are of
quite a different tenor. The facts we understand to be that Dr.
Lang has sent out a land order in his own favour for £800 or
£900, and that he has appointed Mr. Pettigrew his agent to select
that land in his own name and on his own behalf; but the question
remains quite as uncertain as it was, whether the passengers per
'Lima' will get their portions of land: at least it seems certain
that they have no claim whatever on the Government for them. Even
Mr. Pettigrew, on whom Dr. Lang has liberally given land orders
of his own, has no power by law to dispose of the lands selected
by him on Dr. Lang's behalf. It may be that Dr. Lang intended to
give that power, but, apparently, out of the arrogant reliance
which he is ascertained to place on his own knowledge, he has
neglected to go by legal advice, and to use the proper legal
method of conveying the power.</p>
<p>"But whether this be the case or not in respect of the
immigrants per 'Lima', those by the previous ships are wholly
without remedy; even in such imperfect documents in Mr.
Pettigrew's favour, as we have mentioned, being wanting in the
earlier ships, and no land nor aught else to meet the claims."
January 23. (From our correspondent) "Moreton Bay. Meeting at
Ipswich. The squatters mustered pretty strongly on the 10th
instant, to advocate the resumption of transportation to these
northern districts. At the same time, I am happy to say, the
anti-transportationists gathered their forces in Brisbane and its
vicinity, and met them face to face in their supposed
stronghold.</p>
<p>"The Ipswich people lent their willing aid to mark their
entire disapprobation upon this momentous question. The chair was
taken by Mr. Wilson, squatter (usually called Peak Mountain
Wilson), at the Court Room, Ipswich, at twelve o'clock, when that
gentleman called upon Dr. D'Orsey to move the first resolution,
Mr. R. Jones (best known in former years as 'Dicky' Jones, of
Sydney) objected to the 'resolution'. 'Here a scene ensued that
would baffle any attempt of mine to describe, which ended, after
a noisy discussion, in an adjournment of the meeting to Mr.
Thorn's billiard-room.' Upon the people assembling, I found it
had been moved and seconded 'that Mr. Wilson take the chair.' The
chairman then called on Mr. Francis Bigge to move the resolution,
who read it, and went on to say that transportation to Moreton
Bay was desirable, and that a memorial should be adopted,
soliciting the Secretary of State for the Colonies to send out a
number of exiles, accompanied by an equal number of free
immigrants; proceeded to state that it was a well-known fact that
the whole of these northern districts urgently required labour,
and that the flocks and herds were so rapidly increasing that it
was impossible to get labour to keep pace with them; read part of
a report to the Legislative Council, setting forth that
seven-eighths of the productions of New South Wales were wool,
and that any reduction in this production, or any increase in its
cost would be injurious to the colony, and as they so urgently
needed labour, he, for one, would rather have the pick of the
gaols than the refuse of workhouses. A great deal too had been
said about the morality of the proceeding, and the Brisbane
people had said that the men landed from the 'Mount Stuart
Elphinstone' were riotous upon being landed. He recollected when
the immigrants per the 'Artemisia' arrived. He was in Brisbane at
the time, and heard a great uproar in the barracks." The speaker
went into a strain of invective against the Brisbanites, stating
they (the squatters) would shift their patronage to Cleveland
Point&mdash;Ipswich and Cleveland Point would be their townships.
This announcement was received with roars of ironical laughter.
After a few observations about dirty Brisbane, bidding Brisbane.
"good-night", the speaker sat down.</p>
<p>"The proposition was seconded by Mr. Atkinson. This gentleman
made an observation that the working classes were a selfish race,
extorting from their employers high wages for the purpose of
spending their earnings on brandy, rum and champagne. He was met
with violent outcries, groans and hisses.</p>
<p>"The Rev. Mr. Stewart then rose to propose as an amendment
that&mdash;'As this meeting feels convinced that the resumption
of transportation would be highly injurious to the moral, social,
and political welfare of this colony, the people assembled should
memorialise the government to that effect.' The reverend
gentleman endeavoured to address the meeting relative to the
injurious effects the introduction of this class of people would
have upon our future prospects, but the meeting speedily became a
perfect bear-garden."</p>
<p>Patrick Leslie and McTaggart subsequently addressed the
meeting in favour of resumption. R. Jones, Langridge, Dr. Cannan,
and John Richardson opposed the motion. "During the whole time
the chair was occupied there seemed to be only one motive on the
part of all the speakers, and that was to enlist the sympathies
of the working classes in their favour, evidently imagining that
by their vote that day the question must stand or fall; and as a
wind up of this extraordinary meeting, the amendment, upon being
put by the chairman, was carried by almost the entire body of
people in the room, with the exception of the squatters. Still,
the Chairman decided that the majority of the meeting was
certainly in favour of the amendment, but that a majority of
employers of labour was in favour of resumption of
transportation."</p>
<p>"I cannot refrain from mentioning that there seemed to be only
one opinion about introducing Chinese or Coolie labour, I and
that was strongly against
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
although subsequent to the meeting one or two squatters broadly
asserted that if they were defeated in getting convicts they
would send for Chinese. Free immigration they evidently felt was
denied them, for whilst they heard of no less than twenty-seven
vessels being advertised in September last, as being laid on with
immigrants for these colonies, Moreton Bay did not appear in the
list for a single ship. The neglect of these districts on the
part of the authorities is, to say the least of it, very
annoying. Whilst we read of depots at Maitland, Parramatta,
Goulburn, Yass, and other places, being constantly supplied with
useful free labour, we are left without any, except the 'orphan'
girls, and a few drafts of 'exiles'. We can scarcely wonder that
the squatters of these districts have banded themselves together
to get convict labour to tend the flocks and herds when, after
three years of promises they have had their hopes deferred until
their hearts are sick and their pockets nearly empty. Give us
plenty of free labour&mdash;labour in a continuous stream, and
you will hear no more of wanting the sweepings of the hulks and
gaols of England."</p>
<p>The high standard of address made by that early and
ever-esteemed settler at Brisbane, Robert Little, and the
sensible quiet and conciliatory tone in which he declared himself
opposed to resumption, produced but for a little time a hopeful
lull in the storm around him. A scene of indescribable confusion
followed the declaration made by the chairman, in the midst of
which he left the room, and proceeded, followed by the squatters,
to the Queen's Hotel, where the following memorial was proposed
by John Balfour, seconded by Dr. D'Orsey, and adopted for
transmission to the Right Honourable Earl Grey, Secretary of
State for the Colonies.</p>
<p>"The humble petition of the undersigned stockholders,
employers of labour, in the districts of Moreton Bay, Wide Bay,
and the Burnett river.</p>
<p>"Respectfully showeth: That your petitioners are at present
suffering great inconvenience and loss from the want of labour;
and as they see little or no prospect of a sufficient number of
emigrants being sent to this portion of the colony, respectfully
beg that exiles&mdash;holders of tickets of leave&mdash;may be
sent to Moreton Bay, with such proportion of emigrants as Her
Majesty's Government shall see fit; and your petitioners have
less hesitation in making this request, being satisfied with the
conduct of exiles who have already arrived in this district.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners, seeing by the public prints that a
meeting has been held at Brisbane for the purpose of requesting
your Lordship to discontinue sending exiles to Moreton Bay, are
induced to call your Lordship's attention to the fact that some
of the speakers at that meeting, as well as a great number of
those signing the memorial, are newly arrived immigrants, who
have had little experience of the colony, and none of prisoners
or ticket-of-leave servants; and who, from interested motives,
feel a disinclination to receive men who will compete with
themselves in the labour market.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners, with the wish to enable your Lordship
to judge of the class they represent, have adopted the novel
method of adding to their signatures the amount of stock
depastured by them, with the number of servants employed in their
respective establishments, being well aware that memorials are
frequently signed by persons representing no property
whatever.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners do not apprehend any diminution of
unassisted immigration to Moreton Bay on account of exiles being
sent to that port, as it is certain that in the event of your
Lordship acceeding to the prayer of your Brisbane memorialists,
the importation of Chinese and Coolie labour (still more
objectionable than that of English prisoners), which has already
been carried to considerable extent will be almost indefinitely
increased.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners beg to call your Lordship's attention
to the fact, that several of your Brisbane memorialists have not
only been importers of Chinese labour, but are employers of
lately arrived exiles.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners do not agree in opinion with your
Brisbane memorialists that a large increase in the military and
police establishment will be required in the event of exiles
being sent to this part of the colony, it being known that many
prisoners of the Crown (in former days) who committed
depredations, or absconded from their assigned service were
driven to such courses by <i>extreme oppression</i>, on the part
of their masters; whereas the exiles now sent enjoy so many of
the privileges of free men as to render such oppression
impossible.</p>
<p>"While your petitioners, therefore, deprecate in the strongest
manner the resumption of transportation on the old assignment
system, they respectfully urge on your Lordship the necessity of
supplying annually such number of exiles holding tickets-of-leave
as may seem expedient&mdash;feeling assured that from one
thousand to fifteen hundred would be employed in these districts,
and by none more readily than your Lordship's memorialists at
Brisbane.</p>
<p>"And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray."</p>
<p>The signing of the memorial was then gone through with, when
it appeared that twenty-six stockholders, employing in the
aggregate upwards of seven hundred men, had appended their names
to it, besides many gentlemen who reside in this town, and in
Brisbane.</p>
<p>It was resolved that the memorial should be sent round to all
the stations in the three districts for signatures, and that a
subscription list should be opened to defray expenses; the
following gentlemen have been requested to collect the same; viz.
Messrs. Walter Gray, Thorn and Allan.</p>
<p>After all these proceedings the squatters and others residing
in or near Ipswich, held another meeting the same day, for the
purpose of taking steps towards bringing out a newspaper, besides
the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i>, for the northern districts.
Walter Gray, so generally liked, as I can well recollect, and
admired for his blunt honesty of purpose, initiated the matter,
complained that the present paper did not meet the views nor
expectations of its country subscribers, and thought it high time
that another journal should be started. Patrick Leslie had, in
common with squatters, lost all confidence in the <i>Courier</i>.
He did not wish for a one-sided paper, but for one that would not
pander to persons who paid for advertisements; made the proposal
that another besides the <i>Courier</i> be established, which,
having been seconded by Dr. D'Orsey, was carried, and Sydney
Lyons was requested by thirty-five of those present to put their
names down as supporters of the new journal. Vengeance on the
champion of Brisbane v. Bush! Town and Gown!</p>
<p>In an angry leader of the <i>Herald</i> of the 1st February,
1850, the following admission was made; an admission from which
the whole heat of separation has been, and will be, I suppose,
always engendered:&mdash;"It appears from the general tone of
discussion, on both sides alike, that the Moreton Bay district
has <i>not been fairly treated by the government</i>. There seems
to have been no just proportion between the amount received into
the land fund from its inhabitants, and the number of immigrants
forwarded to it during the present flow of immigration. If this
be the truth, the government are in some measure responsible for
the false step which the petitioners have taken. To see free
labour pouring into all parts of the colony, and none, or next to
none, into their's, while they have contributed largely to the
fund out of which the importation of labour is provided for, is,
it must be confessed, enough to rouse very angry feelings, and to
provoke the adoption of very rash expedients. Under such
circumstances we cannot wonder that the Moreton Bay squatters use
strong language, nor can we wonder much, although we must deeply
deplore, that they should have been maddened to the desperate
extremity of asking for convicts."</p>
<p>The <i>Herald's</i> supplement of the 4th February added to
the suspense of the time. Its "London correspondent", writing on
the 6th of the previous October, said, "I have heard that no
sooner had my Lord Grey come up from the north than he decided to
send convicts to Moreton Bay. I understand that some Moreton Bay
settlers now in England had addressed a memorial to Lord Grey,
suggesting that convicts might be despatched to that quarter;
that immediately on coming to town His Lordship sent for them,
and that the result of the interview was that Moreton Bay was to
have convicts and equal supplies of free
immigrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I can only assume that Moreton Bay is going to be sliced off from
the old colony." From the same, on the 17th of October: "Well, I
believe I can now tell you that convicts are to be forthwith sent
from this country to Moreton Bay! and that there is no intention
of declaring Moreton Bay a non-integral part of New South Wales!
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It's very clear that the premonitory despatches of your Governor,
transmitted from Sydney, I imagine, in March and April, are
wholly disregarded!"</p>
<p>It was at this juncture&mdash;the period at which the "better
administration of government in Her Majesty's colonies" absorbed
so much attention and thought that E. Gibbon Wakefield heaped
fuel on many burning thoughts in Australia by certain letters
which he addressed to the Honourable Henry Petre of Wellington,
New Zealand. Their gist may be summed up in a few of his own
concluding expressions. "'Hang the colonies! they are a nuisance
and a plague: the sooner we get rid of them the better!' and so
say <i>I</i>, at length, after twenty years of striving to extend
and consolidate the Colonial Empire; but I say it with a
condition. The condition is, provided we cannot get good
municipal government&mdash;real local self-government&mdash;for
the colonies as parts of the British Empire." [Is this not the
very germ of separation and federation?] "Can we? I am <i>not</i>
sure&mdash;I <i>am</i> sure, after hoping to the contrary for
twenty years, that we <i>cannot</i> get a good administration of
the waste lands by Downing-street; and therefore, I have finally
joined those who would hand over to the colonies alone the entire
administration of the waste lands. But the question is not yet
settled. It will probably be determined next year, and I can
think of nothing else so likely to occasion its determination in
favour of the greatness of the great Empire which we are all
proud of belonging to, as a call upon this nation by the colonies
of the south to choose between free municipal government for
them, and their complete independence. Say to England, either let
us manage our own local affairs, including the making and
altering of all local laws, and the appointment and removal of
all local officers, as used to be the case in the New England
colonies: either annex us to old England by a tie that we should
be proud and happy to preserve, or in mercy cast us loose, to
shift for ourselves as independent nations."</p>
<p>The air was filled with murmurs, of uncertain sound as yet,
but becoming day by day mouthed into meaning. Thrusts in the
crowd for more political elbow room for those men of Australia,
who rose head and shoulders above it. Leaders of men able to sway
their several masses of the great unwashed, and smaller groups of
those in better case. Notable among the men of the time was Dr.
Lang. Having come out in some English newspapers, the
<i>Herald</i>, of the 11th March, reproduced the following letter
written by him on board the ship "Clifton" lying off Gravesend.
Much yeasting of opinion was consequent upon its appearance in
New South Wales. The ejaculation, however, seemed to have too
much of the Parthian character, and missed its mark.</p>
<div style="margin-right:5%; text-align:right; font-size:90%;">
"14th November, 1849.</div>
<blockquote>"To the <span class="u">Earl Grey</span>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now nearly
three years since I arrived in this country as a representative
of the people of New South Wales, for the furtherance of certain
objects of vast importance to my adopted country; and as I am on
the eve of my return to Australia, with but little prospect of
ever setting foot again on English ground, I trust your lordship
will excuse me for troubling you previous to my departure with
the result of my experience and observation of the first three
years of your lordship's administration as 'Autocrat of all the
Russias' of our Colonial Empire.<br>
<br>
"I beg, therefore, to assure your lordship, that I arrived in
this country entertaining the highest hopes as a British
Colonist, from your lordship's accession to office&mdash;an event
which I was simple enough to regard as one of the happiest omens
to the colonies. I am now returning to Australia with the
bitterest disappointment and disgust, cherishing precisely the
same feelings as the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin did when he
left England as a British subject for the last time.<br>
<br>
"My principal object in coming to England towards the close of
the year 1846 was to give such an impulse to emigration to
Australia as would direct to that country many families and
individuals of virtuous character and industrious
habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In this object, I am happy to say that I have succeeded far
beyond my own highest expectations, although I have experienced
nothing from your lordship's office but incivility and
obstruction. I had also in view to procure and to send forth to
Australia a number of ministers of
religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In this object I have also succeeded to a considerable extent,
having already sent out, in great measure at my own risk and
charges, from twelve to eighteen evangelical ministers, while I
am carrying out with me in this vessel twenty-four poor young men
as candidates for the ministry. It occurred to me, in making the
necessary arrangements for such an enterprise, that as your
lordship's subordinates of the Emigration Department were sending
out Episcopalian ministers and Romish priests at the public
expense, the same indulgence might be extended to such ministers
as these referred to; but I regret to state that my application
to this effect was most ungraciously refused by your lordship's
department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
My third object was to direct a stream of British emigration of a
superior character to the Moreton Bay district of New South
Wales, with a view to the cultivation of cotton and other
tropical produce by means of European free labour, and as Moreton
Bay is in latitude S. 27½ deg.&mdash;a much lower latitude than
any to which British emigration had previously been
directed&mdash;and as my avowed object in originating that
emigration was one of transcendent importance not only to the
British Empire but to the interests of humanity, I appeal to your
lordship whether it was not reasonable, in such an undertaking,
to have anticipated the countenance of your lordship's
department. I regret, however, to be obliged to acknowledge that
I have not received the slightest assistance from the Colonial
Office; on the contrary, when I had succeeded, notwithstanding
every petty annoyance that incapacity in office could suggest, in
sending out the first ship load, consisting of about two hundred
and fifty emigrants to that remote locality, instructions were
actually forwarded to Australia from the Colonial Office to
prevent the local Government from affording to those emigrants
any such assistance as was indispensably necessary for the
carrying out of the great undertaking in which they were
engaged&mdash;I mean the attempt to cultivate, by means of
British free labour in Australia, the peculiar productions of the
West Indies and the slave states of North America. My lord, I
will not trust myself to characterise such a proceeding, and will
leave it to your lordship to do so.<br>
<br>
"Notwithstanding these discouragements and obstructions, however,
I have succeeded in despatching no fewer than three ships
containing nearly six hundred emigrants to Moreton Bay; and I beg
to add that a company for the cultivation of the sugar-cane and
the manufacture of sugar is now in process of formation at
Moreton Bay, under the superintendence of an experienced planter
from Jamaica, whom I sent out for this express purpose by the
second of these three vessels.<br>
<br>
"In singular contrast with the heavy blow and great
discouragement which emigration of a superior character to
Moreton Bay has thus experienced from your lordship's department,
is the officious encouragement and assistance afforded by that
department from colonial funds for Irish female emigration,"
(orphan girls from Irish workhouses). "In the report of the
commissioners for administering the laws for the relief of the
poor in Ireland, addressed to his Excellency the Earl of
Clarendon, of date July 14, 1849, I find it stated that it
commenced in the spring of 1848, that the number of these
emigrants shipped from Plymouth for Sydney and Adelaide had
amounted to two thousand two hundred and nineteen at a cost to
the 'Unions' of about £5 per head for outfit and conveyance to
Plymouth, the remaining cost being defrayed from the colonial
funds.' Now, my lord, from the origin and character of the
influence which was notoriously brought to bear upon your
lordship and his Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, in
furtherance of this measure of Irish Female Emigration, no
intelligent person, at all acquainted either with the parties who
originated that measure, or with the Australian colonies, can
doubt for a moment that the real object of those parties at whose
instance your lordship was induced to sanction the measure in
question, was simply to supply Roman Catholic wives for the
English and Scotch Protestants of the humbler classes in
Australia, and thereby to Romanize the Australian colonies
through the artful and thoroughly Jesuitical device of mixed
marriages. Your lordship has thus been transforming your
department, as far as Irish female emigration is concerned, into
a mere Romish Propaganda. And what right, I ask, my lord, had you
to misappropriate the funds of the Australian
Colonies,&mdash;funds derived almost exclusively from the capital
and enterprise of English and Scotch protestants&mdash;to any
such purposes or any such way? Was it because there were 'no
distressed needle-women' in England to whom a free passage to
Australia would have proved an invaluable boon?<br>
<br>
"Was it because there were no virtuous unmarried females
struggling with poverty in Scotland that the funds contributed in
such large measure by English and Scottish Protestants, should be
appropriated in inundating their adopted country with Irish
Romanism? I admit that neither your lordship nor His Excellency,
the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, could possibly have had any
design to unprotestantise the Australian colonies. I am well
aware that in the whole matter your lordship and the
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland were merely the dupes of an artful
female Jesuit, the able but concealed agent of the Romish
Priesthood in Australia, who had thus adroitly managed to attach
both of your lordships&mdash;two Ministers of State&mdash;to her
apron-strings.<br>
<br>
"The late Legislative Council of New South Wales, at the instance
of a Select Committee of that body, of which I had the honour of
being a member, had actually recommended to your lordship that in
any future immigration into that colony at the public expense,
there should, as nearly as possible, be an equal number of
immigrants from each of the three kingdoms; and the same
recommendation and request was also pressed upon your lordship in
a series of petitions which I had the honour to submit to your
lordship on my arrival in this country from various important
districts of New South Wales. But in that spirit of haughty and
contemptuous disregard both of the feelings and wishes of British
colonists and colonial legislatures, which seems to form a
leading principle in your lordship's administration, these
recommendations and requests have been left unheeded, and a
course diametrically opposed to the wishes and interests of the
best portions of the colony has been pursued.<br>
<br>
"Your lordship's proceedure in the matter of resumption of
transportation to New South Wales has been precisely similar in
its character. Your lordship's predecessor, the Right Honourable
W.E. Gladstone, had projected and partly formed a new penal
colony on the east coast of Australia, immediately to the
northward, in which it was proposed to carry out an improved
system of convict discipline. Had this judicious measure, which
your lordship unceremoniously and without examination set aside
on accession to office, been pursued, your lordship had been
spared the humiliation and annoyance which your lordship's
department has recently experienced from New Zealand, from the
Cape of Good Hope, and from New South Wales. But your lordship
appears to be quite above both advice and warning in this matter:
for your lordship has not only determined to transform the
peculiarly interesting and promising settlement of Moreton Bay
into a penal settlement once more, but has actually ordered more
convicts to be sent to Sydney, in the face of the repeated
remonstrances and protests of the colonies.<br>
<br>
"My lord, there are certain injuries and insults, especially
those offered to communities, which, for the good of society,
ought neither to be tolerated nor forgiven: and this, I conceive,
is an injury and insult of that particular kind. If your
lordship, therefore, should persevere in carrying out this
measure, in direct opposition to the publicly expressed opinion
of large bodies of the colonists of New South Wales, in all parts
of the territory, the people of that colony will, in my humble
opinion, be justified in resorting to measures of
self-preservation which your lordship will scarcely anticipate,
but which will effectually insure the redress of all such
grievances for the future.<br>
<br>
"That measures of the kind I refer to have already suggested
themselves as a matter of absolute necessity in the last resource
to men of the highest standing and influence in the Australian
colonies, I beg to offer your lordship the following proof: In
the year 1844, when the late Governor of New South Wales
attempted, under the notorious pretext of being the Queen's
bailiff, and of having, in that capacity, the exclusive
administration of the waste lands of the colony, to revive the
policy of Charles the First, by imposing vexatious taxes upon a
large portion of the principal colonists without the consent of
their representatives, certain of the squatters gave out, in my
own hearing, that they would at all events stand to their rights,
and that even if Her Majesty should send out 10,000 of her best
troops to put them down, they had sheep and cattle enough in the
colony to buy them all off in a few weeks. For the colonists have
not failed to discover, from the numerous desertions that are
taking place even at present, that the temptation of a
comfortable settlement in the genial climate of New South Wales
as compared with possible results of a campaign in
India&mdash;the usual destination of British troops&mdash;in
Australia would be greatly too strong for the virtue of the
soldier. Now, my lord, the sheep and cattle of the colony, in
which its wealth mainly consists, have more than doubled their
number since the year 1844, and your lordship is aware that the
waste land, of which the value is incalculable, will always be at
the disposal of any government <i>de facto</i>, whatever may be
the origin of that government, and whatever form it may assume.
And does your lordship suppose that men of British spirit, with
such means of redress at their hands, will suffer themselves to
be treated any longer like mere children in a nursery, by any
peer in Her Majesty's realm? Does your lordship suppose that
there are not men of higher mark in Australia than the Irish
incapables of Dublin and Ballingarry?<br>
<br>
"For three years past your Lordship has been promising a
constitution for the Australian Colonies; but if that
constitution should not be something very different from the
miserable apology for a constitution, which your lordship's
subaltern, Mr. Hawes, presented to the House of Commons during
the last session of Parliament, and subsequently withdrew, I will
venture to predict that the colonists will endorse and return it
with the well-known post-marks 'too late' and 'more to pay.'<br>
<br>
"Very moderate concessions would have satisfied the colonies
three year ago, but such concessions will not satisfy them now.
To use a vulgar but expressive phrase, which I trust your
lordship will excuse, they will now 'go for the whole hog', or
nothing at all.<br>
<br>
"For the three years of gross mismanagement, which your lordship
has permitted to subsist throughout the
colonies:&mdash;misgovernment, which it was fully in your
lordship's power, and was your lordship's first duty, in
accordance with your own previous professions, to have rectified,
your lordship, in my humble opinion deserves both dismissal and
impeachment; and if the government of this great nation were only
in such able and vigorous hands as the extreme urgency of the
times demands, both of these measures of justice would be dealt
out 10 your lordship without fail and without hesitation.<br>
<br>
"As far as regards the Australian colonies, your lordship has,
for three years past, been knocking at the gate of futurity for
the President of the United States of Australia; be assured, my
lord, he is getting I ready and will shortly be out, and he will
astonish the world with the manliness of his port, and the
dignity of his demeanour. As in duty bound, he will make a
profound obeisance to your lordship, in the first instance, in
grateful acknowledgement of the concern which your lordship has
had in his paternity; he will then take his place in the great
family of nations, with a proud consciousness of the brilliant
career upon which his full country has entered when delivered
from the baleful domination of Downing-street. He will require no
soldiers to enable him to keep his seat, like Louis Napoleon; he
will have no foul blot of slavery to defile his national
escutcheon like Zachary Taylor.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship's very humble
and most obedient servant,</blockquote>

"<span class="u">John Dunmore Lang,
D.D.</span>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <i>Atlas</i> there was "at one" with the <i>Herald</i>
here, which said on the 26th March:&mdash;"The refusal of
government to deviate from general principles and from statute
laws, and to afford the boons asked"
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
"is frequently followed by unmeasured abuse which accords very
ill with the previous humility of solicitation, and true position
of the parties." As an instance illustrating this remark: "are
the expectations of Dr. Lang to be allowed payment in land for
his irregular immigration scheme; and the more modest but still
unwise fancy of the people of Brisbane that the land on which the
projectors of the Sugar-growing Company had placed their minds
would be got by the latter at the minimum price of £1 per acre,
or at least put up at that price. But it lies with Downing-street
not with our Colonial Executive, nor is the matter under the
control of the Local Legislature. We want the remedy."</p>
<p>And again on the 9th April: "English Extracts: The
<i>Spectator</i> and Dr. Lang. From <i>The London Atlas</i>."</p>
<blockquote>"The <i>Spectator</i> publishes what it calls 'An
Indignant Remonstrance' from one Dr. Lang of New South Wales,
whom our contemporary characterises as a most energetic,
influential, and eminent man, worthy of all esteem and respect.
As 'the indignant remonstrance' concludes with open and explicit
avowal of revolt we congratulate the Spectator on its patriotism
and good taste in adopting the principle of the Doctor's fiery
communication.<br>
<br>
"The Doctor, it appears, is a red-hot Presbyterian of the
colonial species. Those who come into contact with such people
know well what that term means. The most utter disregard of any
feeling but their own; the most profound contempt of the ordinary
rules of politeness and prudence; the most inflexible
determination to hear no argument, and bear with no opposition,
are the permanent characteristics of these gentlemen, a race now
mainly confined to our colonial hotbeds. A man of the class
coming to England with a set of pre-conceived ideas which he is
determined to enforce at all hazards, in furtherance of which he
sets at nought the plans and opinions of other people with the
most rabid recklessness, may, it will be conceived, give that
kind of annoyance to a minister which may subject him to be sent
about his business with every possible attention to ceremony and
formality.<br>
<br>
"Dr. Lang, it appears, came to the country with a furious zeal
for peopling Australia with Presbyterians. He proposed to send
ship-loads of these religionists to the colony by government
assistance. Unfortunately Lord Grey was then, as he is now, much
more concerned to get rid of the squalid and hungry mass of
misery in catholic Ireland than to remove the decent and
well-ordered population professing Presbyterianism. So far this
was a compliment to the doctor's opinions, but as it was in
opposition to his plans, he sunk the compliment in the
disappointment, and became most furiously irate with the Colonial
Office for deluging Australia with Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>
"This was not all; though there would seem at present to be a
sufficiency of spots in Australia already selected for
colonisation, although population at every one else is most
grievously needed; yet the doctor finds a pet place of his own in
Moreton Bay, a district remote from any one of those selected by
the best judges for the purpose required, and expects 'the
countenance and assistance of his lordship's department.'<br>
<br>
"It does not appear to have struck the Doctor for a moment that
the Minister's multitudinous engagements did not permit his
seizing suddenly a plan for a new settlement, recommended by a
single individual, even though that individual is the
'influential and eminent' Dr. Lang. So Lord Grey snubbed the
project, and the Doctor, satisfied the 'best interests of
humanity' were betrayed, departs in the most inconceivable wrath
against a government which sends to the colonies those least able
to live at home, without any reference to their religious belief,
and which does not see the transcendent claims which Moreton Bay
possesses to be formed into a colony. Moreton Bay and
Presbyterianism, the study by day and the dream by night of Dr.
Lang, not to be found amongst the first considerations of our
Colonial Secretary; and it is enough to raise Balfour, of
Burleigh, from his ashes to form a New Covenant in the wildest of
the antipodes!<br>
<br>
"We do not wonder that Dr. Lang, departing from our shores, as he
says, like a second Franklin, should threaten Great Britain with
a President of the Australian States, 'who is shortly to be out
and to astonish the world with the manliness of his port and the
dignity of his demeanour.' People do not like to be snubbed, and
more especially fiery presbyterians and determined projectors. So
Dr. Lang, like a child baulked of his play-thing, squalls most
lustily and threatens the nurse's eyes with all the power its
small fists can command. The monkey on board ship, shown an
orange which it can't get, endeavours incontinently to throw
itself overboard. We are not, as we said, surprised at the antics
of our monkey in a similar situation, but we are somewhat
surprised that 'Spectator' should think it proper to pat Jacko on
the back."</blockquote>
<p>Still treading on the toes of Dr. Lang's proceedings, he
having returned to Sydney, a severe article appeared in the same
month:</p>
<blockquote>"On the 5th of this month, said the <i>Herald</i>, we
put a few home questions to the Rev, Dr. Lang, who has not yet
found leisure to answer them, few as they were. At that time we
did not know what we now know bearing upon the sixth of these
questions relative to the power of disposal, which Dr. Lang
reserved to himself, over the land belonging to the immigrants
per 'Lima', which he appointed Mr. Pettigrew to select under the
land order transmitted to this gentleman. This power, which Dr.
Lang has exercised in a manner which, extraordinary as has all
his conduct hitherto in other respects been, we were quite
unprepared, and which indeed staggers belief.<br>
<br>
"In June, 1849, Dr. Lang received from several of the immigrants
per 'Lima' money to the amount of £1,100, to be applied to the
purchase of colonial lands and passages to the colony per 'Lima'
on their account, at the rate of eighty acres and a passage for
every £100: issued to these individuals his own orders for land
addressed to Mr. Pettigrew, and provided the passages agreed for;
and also purchased a land order. No. 21, dated 16th June, in
which the commissioners of colonial land and emigration certified
that Dr. Lang had paid into their hands the sum of £850, and that
he was entitled to a remission to the extent of that sum in the
price of lands in the Sydney district, to be purchased by him or
such person as might be appointed by him, and notified by the
commissioners as his agent for the purchase in the names and on
behalf of the depositors.<br>
<br>
"This land order, No. 21, together with a certificate of like or
subsequent date, acquainting the Colonial Government, that Mr.
Pettigrew had been appointed by Dr. Lang, in the usual manner, to
select land on his behalf, was presented by that gentleman at the
Colonial Treasury, and they were admitted as valid documents. Mr.
Pettigrew at the same time, requested that the Government would
issue the deeds of the lands in favour of parties to be named by
him. A request which gave rise to a legal question. In the course
of consideration of this question, which threatened to go very
adversely to the interests of the immigrants, Mr. Pettigrew
produced a letter written to him by Dr. Lang on the eve of the
sailing of the 'Lima', and four or five days after the date of
the Land Order 21, recognising him as surveyor to Dr. Lang's
colonisation enterprise for the Moreton Bay quarter, and
specifying the names of the emigrants per 'Lima', who were
entitled to land by virtue of that order with the numbers of
acres respectively which they were to receive. Hereupon, it
appears that the Government resolved to stretch a point, in order
to accommodate the parties who had entrusted the management of
their land claims to Dr. Lang, and instructed the proper officer
at Moreton Bay to allow them to purchase land at any of the sales
to the extent of the sums set against their several names in Dr.
Lang's letter to Mr. Pettigrew, but directed him to intimate to
them that their deeds would not be issued unless Dr. Lang should
sanction the apportionment.<br>
<br>
"This goodnatured arrangement appeared very satisfactory; nobody
doubted that Dr. Lang would have gladly acquiesced in it, and,
consequently, some of the parties concerned exercised their right
to purchase. Several hundred pounds' worth of land was
appropriated under this arrangement at the sales lately held in
Brisbane, and most of the immigrants who did not then see lots
that suited them, considered themselves perfectly secure at
whatever time they might find it convenient to buy. We remember
we expressed our surprise at this general manifestation of
confidence, being ignorant of the extent to which the government
had yielded, or that any grounds existed to warrant a deviation
from the strict legal tenor of Mr. Pettigrew's appointment, as
agent for the selection of land in Dr. Lang's name and
behalf.<br>
<br>
"But we never could have contemplated what we are now to narrate.
We might have apprehended danger from other contingencies. Dr.
Lang might have died before giving his sanction to the
arrangement, and the deeds be long unissued: or his heirs,
executors and administrators might claim the entire remission for
the benefit of his estate: or possibly creditors might do the
same, and in either case litigation might ensue; but the last
thing, with all our alleged malice to Dr. Lang, which we should
have thought of could be&mdash;that he would dispose of Land
Order No. 21 to another person for money!<br>
<br>
"This, however, incredible as it may sound. Dr. Lang has done.
Having procured a duplicate of Land Order No. 21 and a fresh
certificate notifying the appointment of another agent in place
of Mr. Pettigrew, whose appointment, we presume, he was legally
entitled to revoke, he has raised the sum of five hundred and
sixty pounds upon these documents which have been presented by a
respectable mercantile firm in Sydney to the Colonial Treasurer,
and a demand made for their acceptance in the usual form.<br>
<br>
"Whether the Government can hold by the arrangement made by the
first claimant and carry it into effect in such a change of
circumstances we are unable to say.<br>
<br>
"In any event there is for one or other of the parties holding
and claiming under the order&mdash;what shall we
say?&mdash;Disappointment."<br>
<br>
Upon the uneasy spirits of those days, pent in by party, public,
personal, private prejudices and passions while the "organic
cell"&mdash;if it be allowable to use such a term&mdash;of
patriotic devotion, and political life lay, exclusively it
seemed, within the souls of such men only as William Charles
Wentworth and a few of his henchmen of calibre "Tower proof"
under past trial&mdash;poured forth, as oil on troubled streams,
the <i>Herald's</i> trumpet voice, on the 11th day of April,
1850.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Glorious News</span>.&mdash;His Excellency the
Governor has received a despatch from the Secretary of State,
stating that Her Majesty had been advised <i>to rescind</i> the
Order in Council making the colony a penal settlement! Before
receiving the address"&mdash;(sent home by the Legislative
Council against transportation)&mdash;"the ship 'Bangalore' had
been chartered for Moreton Bay, but his lordship assures his
Excellency that no other ship would be sent out."<br>
<br>
"17th. We are so delighted that we have no disposition to scan
with too critical an eye the attempt made by his lordship in the
first of these despatches to vindicate himself from the charge of
having broken faith with the colonists. For the same reason we
forbear to enlarge upon the modest efforts made by Mr. Arthur
Hodgson and his six compatriots to induce Her Majesty's
government to set at nought the declared wishes of the
Legislative Council and of the vast majority of their fellow
colonists. Mr. Arthur Hodgson and his friends are, we should
presume, sufficiently punished&mdash;by the account of the
gladdening fact that no more convicts will be sent to any part of
New South Wales."<br>
<br>
"Moreton Bay being a part of New South Wales, the Minister's
pledge, of course, applies to Brisbane. So the seven champions of
convictism have nothing to do but to&mdash;give up all hope of
any successful renewal of their felon-hunting adventures. Her
Majesty's Government have nobly refused to consult their own
convenience at the expense of the colonies. Such conduct is truly
magnanimous&mdash;worthy of a great, a free, a christian nation.
It will not be unappreciated by the people of New South Wales. It
will bind our affections more closely to our fatherland, and
strengthen our loyalty to our most gracious sovereign, and lead
us to repel with a warmer indignation any treasonable attempt,
come from what quarter it may, to tamper with our allegiance to
the British throne."</blockquote>
<p>On the 30th the <i>Herald</i> again summoned public attention
to Dr. Lang and Moreton Bay. "We have the pleasure of announcing
that the questions arising out of Dr. Lang's second assignment of
the land order, on which the emigrants per 'Lima' depended for
their land, having been submitted to the law officers of the
crown, they have given their opinion that Government must carry
into effect the appropriation before intimated by Dr. Lang, as if
it acknowledged the claim preferred on the same document by the
other party, it would become accessory to a 'fraud'" (that is the
word used) "upon the immigrants who placed the money in Dr.
Lang's hands."</p>
<p>To have selected the very moment when Great Britain's sense of
honour and justice had been vindicated by her act of drawing
aside the veil of Australia's reproach from the fuller view of
the triumphant emblem of freed-will&mdash;her own Southern
Cross,&mdash;the very time, too, at which such serious, and as
yet, unheeded, public assaults were being made on the propriety
of the reverend gentleman's past proceedings in London, will,
perhaps, be thought strangely suicidal an attempt to stir up
excitement in the colony, having for its object separation in its
extreme sense from the mother country. Yet it was so. On this
same day a long advertisement appeared announcing that it had
been resolved, at the instance of Dr. Lang, to form the
"Australian League", for the purpose of obtaining ultimately the
complete independence of New South Wales. A meeting had been
held, and on the 4th of May we could read in the <i>Herald</i> a
few lines headed: "The Great Political Humbug.&mdash;After a good
deal of hesitation as to the expediency of our commenting upon
the recent attempt to get up a 'great political crisis'&mdash;in
other words to persuade the colonists to renounce allegiance to
the British Crown, we had made up our minds to go into the
subject in right good earnest. But after reading the letter which
appeared in our paper of yesterday, from one who had taken part
in the proceedings of the first meeting called by the
'Arch-Agitator', our intent was at once abandoned. Now, however,
having been led behind the curtain, and permitted to see the
materials of which the meeting was composed, and the babel
confusion and imbecility which characterised its proceedings we
may safely leave the 'Great Political' Humbug to cut its own
throat."</p>
<p>The appearance of the <i>Daily News</i> of the 17th of last
January, from London, was a wet blanket, indeed, to the hopes of
the few remaining who yet stretched out a hand to cut the
painter! "We are given to understand," it says, "that Ministers
contemplate a bold innovation and great improvement in our
colonial policy. They have, after mature deliberation, arrived at
the conclusion that justice and expediency alike demand the
concession of entire self-government to the colonies in local
affairs. They intend to reserve to the Central Imperial
Government the exercise only of those functions which are
indispensable to unity of action in the foreign relations of the
Empire."</p>
<p>"And it is understood that they are prepared to intimate to
the colonies the intention to withdraw the troops from every one
of them that will make the necessary arrangements, and take upon
itself the cost of its defensive establishments." And this
statement was said to have received ample confirmation in
despatches which had reached the Governor within the past few
days. What said the <i>Times</i> too of February 4th last?" The
outlines of the scheme for our Australian colonies are already
known to the country. Short of saying 'good-bye' to those
possessions altogether, the proposal is as liberal as can be
imagined."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
"The newspapers express their astonishment at the largeness of
the concession and, apparently on the strength of it, Mr. Lowe"
(now Lord Sherbrooke), "the member for Sydney and the champion
for self-government has withdrawn a long-threatened motion of an
extreme character. To us at home the most striking feature of the
measure which has just been submitted to the judgment of the
colonists is the proposed 'Federal Union' of the Australian
settlements. Grand as this idea is, we believe it to be not less
necessary: for though the time may be yet distant when federation
will be required for self-defence against a common enemy or for
some other Imperial purposes, it is already wanted for the
settlement of a common tariff, without which the colonies are
likely to be brought into early and unpleasant collision."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
"We know not why a liberal statesman need reject from his
thoughts the chance of a consummation which so many historical
precedents render not improbable: we know not why he should
shrink from a scheme equally pregnant with benefit, whether the
Australian colonies shall continue our own or whether they are
fated to become the United States of the Southern Hemisphere." In
the debate upon the second reading of the New Constitution Bill
in the House of Commons M. Milne "rejoiced in the opportunity now
afforded of thus laying the foundation of an Empire in the
Southern Hemisphere which might in a future age rival even the
glories of the American United States."</p>
<p>The troubles into which Dr. Lang's emigration scheme had
plunged him at Brisbane became intensified at this time by his
arrest in Melbourne, for debt incurred in sending ofi" to that
place a ship-load which had lately arrived. In conscience of this
the <i>Melbourne Argus</i> of the 14th of May, had published a
letter from Dr. Lang, to which, said the <i>Sydney Herald</i> of
the 24th, the Doctor had at length "condescended" to attempt a
vindication of his conduct in regard to his Moreton Bay land
order. That paper then reproduced the whole correspondence on the
25th. As result, a meeting took place at Ipswich on the 5th of
June, of the holders of Dr. Lang's land orders by the ships
"Fortitude" and "Chaseley", residing in or near that town. "Dr.
Challinor took the chair"&mdash;thence wrote the correspondent to
the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i> of the 6th&mdash;"after a long
debate it was moved by Mr. Welsby, seconded by Mr. Hall, and
carried unanimously&mdash;'That while this meeting fully
appreciates the zealous, indefatigable and self-denying labours
of Dr. Lang in promoting emigration to this colony, and regrets
the obstacles that he has had to contend with in his endeavours
to prosecute his laudable enterprise to a successful issue, they,
nevertheless, wholly disallow the principles and arguments he has
published in the <i>Melbourne Argus</i> on the 14th of May, in
defence of the non-fulfilment of his agreements with the parties
he has sent out to this colony, on the grounds"&mdash;which are
then shown at length.</p>
<p>In this month of May the last of the convict ships, the
"Bangalore", with two hundred and ninety men, arrived at Moreton
Bay. Cessation of transportation, and the proclamation of the
21st as the day appointed for her maiden assize&mdash;opened by
Mr. Justice Therry&mdash;were events out of which sprung renewed
eagerness for a hunt for separation from New South Wales, or what
was popularly called, the "Sydney Government". It was proposed
that the people of the northern districts should be invited to
form a "league" to petition the Queen and the Commons of England
to grant it. But there was no immediate advance in the
matter.</p>
<p>The aspect of the <i>fracas</i>, which began by the first hit
straight from the shoulder given by Dr. Lang&mdash;albeit one of
the non-militant order&mdash;at Lord Grey from on board the
"Clifton". and afterwards at the Government here ashore, can be
of but indirect interest to Queenslanders of to-day. The outbreak
and its results have been so far followed, but the strife became
hotter in Sydney through the publication of a despatch from Lord
Grey to Sir Charles Fitzroy (No. 24), dated from Downing-street,
15th December, 1849. It gave a succinct reply to Dr. Lang's
letter already produced, and was laid by the <i>Herald</i> before
the eyes of the public on the 3rd July, 1850, together with
evidence from official sources; and on the 11th Dr. Lang's
"retort" appeared in the same journal, published by the committee
conducting the "free election of Dr. Lang" for Sydney, and signed
"Henry Parkes", hon. secretary. Further despatches appeared on
the 27th respecting these same land orders and Dr. Lang. But Dr.
Lang&mdash;and his committee&mdash;succeeded in their
candidature. He was returned by Sydney as a representative in the
Legislative Council; but to that <em>via sacra</em>, trodden by
the best of New South Welshmen, did his late deeds by sea and by
land follow him. Dr. Lang had in vain striven to disentangle
himself from the meshes of his own net-work. Terence Aubrey
Murray had given notice that he would move "that an address be
presented to his Excellency the Governor, requesting that he will
be pleased to cause to be laid on the table of this house a copy
of all official documents connected with the Land Order for £850,
addressed to his Excellency in favour of Dr. Lang, dated 10th
June, 1849," and led an attack "<i>oro rotundo</i>" upon that
reverend and honourable member, on Tuesday, 13th August. In
unabashed dalliance with the worldly onslaught. Dr. Lang "<i>in
se ipso teres at que rotundus, externi ne quid valeat per læve
morari</i>," rolled himself over his censor's reproaches like a
ball, and possessing himself of the wit of the Smith brothers,
turned his ear with Boswell to the prompting of Samuel Johnson's
grandiloquent ghost, and half-choked the shout of his assailant
by the cry of the pious hawkers, who perambulate the streets of
Stamboul exclaiming "In the name of the Prophet&mdash;Figs!"
However, he but tacked on his appeal to the catalogue of
"Rejected Addresses".</p>
<p>For on the 17th following, William Charles Wentworth gave
Murray a knee on the resumption of the debate, and before the end
of the month honourable members passed on from recording a
verdict, heavily spotted with meaning, and in no way consolatory
to the clerical representative of Sydney, to other business of
the day&mdash;and so shall we.</p>

<div class="indent3">"Well, then," answered Sancho, "let this
island be forthcoming, and it shall go hard with me but I will be
such a governor that, in spite of rogues. Heaven will take me in.
Nor is it from covetousness that I forsake my humble cottage and

<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">Returning</span> to our special ground we find
Patrick Leslie&mdash;the first to incorporate it with, now the
first to take a practical step towards severing it from New South
Wales. In July, then just passed, a meeting had been held on
Darling Downs, at which he presided, at Drayton, formerly called
the "Springs", at which it was resolved that in the "opinion of
that meeting the interests of the northern districts of the
colony did not receive that consideration at the hands of the
colonial government to which they are entitled, and with a view,
therefore, to the ultimate separation of the northern districts
of New South Wales proper, it was desirable to ascertain the
internal revenue collected to the northward of the 30th degree of
latitude; and further, that as a preliminary step towards
bringing the subject before the government, it was desirable that
some member of the legislative council be requested to move for a
return of all sums collected during the past year in those
districts, distinguishing the assessments on stock from the
amount contributed towards the land fund, and that contributed
towards the general revenue: also the sums expended in them, and
the number of government emigrants landed at Brisbane (being the
only port to which any had been sent) during all the same
period."</p>
<p>"That Stuart A. Donaldson, Esq., be requested to move in the
Legislative Council for the return named."</p>
<p>It was also resolved that as "a very great loss was annually
occasioned to these districts from the want of direct
communication with England, with a view to remedy this evil,
application be made to some respectable mercantile house to
establish a branch in Brisbane, and in the event of such
application being successful, the parties composing that meeting
undertake to give such house all the support in their power."</p>
<p>Also, that "great inconvenience was sustained from there not
being any bank in these districts, and that, therefore, renewed
application be made to one of the Sydney banks for the
establishment of a branch in Brisbane."</p>
<p>On Friday, the 24th of the next month, August, the return
above mentioned was moved for in compliance with the request, and
the motion carried.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August the <i>Moreton Bay Free Press</i> was
introduced as the "squatter's recruit", and of course
"separation" was carefully nursed in their interest. Step by step
towards the "necessity", a conscription of "wants" was enlisted.
The cardinal points from which they were enrolled were loyal to
their polar aim. North! the blacks were outrageous. In the
Burnett river district Blaxland had been killed close to his own
head-station hut when taking sheep to water; three shepherds,
poor fellows, in other parts. The cry was "the Burnett and Wide
Bay districts have indeed cause for praying for separation. We
squatters have regularly paid our assessments and squatting
licenses, and what have we got in return? No M.L.C., to represent
us seven hundred miles away! No money for roads or bridges! not a
single emigrant! And worst of all no protection! For this immense
district, six constables, and two chiefs! We do not want to cry
out for separation, however, because we want to have no 'truck'
with Brisbane; but we only want our rights."</p>
<p>Immediately after this wail, a shepherd of Scott's, a
squatter, was killed, and two thousand of his sheep taken by the
blacks, not far from Maryborough. Their tracks were followed to
Mount Boppol, and it was supposed that the intention was to take
them across to Fraser's Island!</p>
<p>South! The valleys of the Clarence and Richmond rivers echoed
onwards Brisbane's challenge to Sydney.</p>
<p>East! The broad paths bring us no fellowship of import nor of
export, but such as is franked by the usury of indirect
mercantile commission; and bring us no fellow-men.</p>
<p>West! What cares New South Wales beyond finding some plausible
occupation for her Surveyor-General, for any real spreading of
the boughs in the midst of which she has built her nest? The
sheep, and cattle, and squatters must do such work on their own
account out here: <i>we hatch the cuckoo's eggs!</i> After all
separation, in a colonial sense, is in its essence but a
reasonable struggle; for a nearer view of the government to which
the scattered inhabitants, out of love for their country's
institutions, look up. Its progressive action must necessarily be
a conflict leading to a definite and sure end.</p>
<p>New South Wales proper was now, indeed, suffering from
separation on the brain. There had been a long and earnest debate
on a motion of John Lamb's in the legislative council which was
calculated successfully to extinguish the still lingering hope
cherished in very questionable fashion by Karl Grey that
Australia would consent in some sort to the resumption of
transportation to her shores. One of the most telling arguments
used by those who remained still favourable to so unpopular a
measure, under certain conditions, was that the land fund would
be exhausted by the separation of Port Phillip and Moreton Bay,
and the means of its future replenishment be thereby so cramped
that there must necessarily be an absolute and immediate stoppage
of immigration. To this it was retorted that the injury
anticipated, was imaginary, because separation would not be
territorial, but technical: in law, not in fact; and because the
labour introduced to any part of Australia would assuredly find
its way to those places by which it was most needed, and best
paid for. Then, in the next month, Sydney bristled up under the
conviction that the squatters about Moreton Bay were at work
"under the rose" in furthering their schemes by baiting their
hook for separation with provision for Lord Grey's hungry exiles,
and so delivering his lordship from the confinement within which
he himself was shackled.</p>
<p>The <i>Free Press</i> had sent forth a document praying for
separation, which was said to be going round all the pastoral
places north of Port Macquarie. It published another of similar
import which bore the name of David Forbes, and the
<i>Herald's</i> correspondent from the same quarter declares to
Sydney that if their "pressing wants" are still disregarded it
must be no matter of surprise that it will be sought very
generally upon "terms not creditable to us at a future time," at
the same time asserting that Richard Jones had been placed in
communication with Robert Campbell, of Sydney, as a fit and
proper person to represent the counties of Gloucester, Macquarie,
and Stanley in the legislative council, and that he, being an
anti-transportationist, was likely to have a large majority. The
parties by whom casting off the yoke of New South Wales was now
preached, which had by this time become a crusade "under two
flags", began to take a very rancourous temper. The question
engrossed the general attention.</p>
<p>The press in Sydney had severely taken the squatters to task
for their past action, and they in retort called upon their
confreres of the secessional persuasion to open the coming year
of 1851 with a meeting to stamp more resolutely their past, but
still unwavering claims. The arrival of the official copy of the
New Constitution Act, of which the 37th section required that it
should be proclaimed within six weeks after its receipt by the
Governor, told of their effect, for in its 34th, it "enabled Her
Majesty, upon the petition of the inhabitant householders of
territories north of the 30th parallel of south latitude, to
detach such territories from New South Wales, and erect them into
a separate colony or colonies"&mdash;and put flesh upon the frame
which now wanted but the quickening.</p>
<p>This meeting came off. In Brisbane it was spoken of as the
memorable struggle of the 8th of January, 1851, of "Right"
against "Might"; and Arthur Hodgson was well nigh stoned as the
Goliath of the Philistine camp. However, it has been the
instrument of garnering a "spicilegium" of names, more or less
bright in the Genesis of Queensland; the early wheat-shocks
overlooked by the gleaners of the present day. For an
advertisement appeared, which prominently brought forward "The
Moreton Bay and Northern Districts Separation Association," of
which the Committee appointed were:</p>

<p>The objects of the association&mdash;separation, with Brisbane
as the seat of Government, with exiles on terms as already set
forth&mdash;need no repitition. Of course a counter demonstration
was at once got up at Brisbane, and a trenchant hand in Sydney
fell upon "Arthur Hodgson and his tail." Yet the old-man jackeroo
did not topple over.</p>
<p>The wind-bag of public expectancy was spared from farther
strain for some months, when it became obvious, from what
transpired on the 5th of last March in the House of Lords, that
during the now well-known debate in the Sydney Legislative
Council on the Transportation Question, should an opinion be
expressed adverse to Lord Grey's proposals his lordship would
resort to the expedient of erecting Moreton Bay into a separate
colony, with the view of sending convicts there. But now it
became further tightened; for it was plain that the Secretary for
the Colonies was seeking to neutralise the decision of the
Legislative Council&mdash;to which he had unreservedly submitted
his own action&mdash;by finessing through the Port Phillip
trump-cards, which had been held by the Council's hand in the
first rubber. He would await the issue of the second, when Port
Phillip was not in the game: he hoped his partner in New South
Wales would be "dummy." But, says our honest Sydney journal, the
<i>Herald</i>:&mdash;"Whatever may be his notions about the
meaning of national pledges, we are certain that the nation at
large understands and will faithfully abide by them."</p>
<p>In July of this year, 1851, there was a dissolution of the
Legislative Council, and new writs were shot out over the
country.</p>
<p>Brisbane:&mdash;Stanley&mdash;county and its borough were at
once warming up towards the boiling point of alliance, quadruple
but in one sense. Richard Jones against Henry Hughes,* for the
boroughs; John Richardson, for the county; George Leslie and
Francis Bigge, for the squatting districts: so nominated.
Alexander Campbell had shown himself, but disappeared. And so in
October, 1851, R, Jones for the boroughs, John Richardson for the
county, and George Leslie and Francis Bigge were introduced as
the Northern representatives to the legislative council in
Sydney; in which on November 8th, R. Jones moved "that an address
be presented to his Excellency the Governor-General praying that
his Excellency will be pleased to cause to be laid on the table
of this House&mdash;1st. A return of the revenue derived from the
sale of Crown lands, in the districts of Clarence river, Moreton
Bay, Darling Downs, Burnett, Wide Bay, and Maranoa, respectively,
from 30 June, 1850, to September 30, 1851. 2nd. Of the amount of
revenue derived from the assessment on live stock (in the same
districts, and between the same dates). 3rd. Of the amount of
revenue collected at the Custom House, Brisbane (between same
dates). 4th. Of that derived from depasturing licenses (in the
same districts respectively, and between same dates). 5th. Of
that received from licenses to retail spirituous liquors, for
confectioners' licenses; for licenses to cut timber on Crown
lands, and for rent of tolls and ferries (in the same districts
respectively, and between the same dates). 6th. That of the
amounts received at the Courts of Petty Sessions for all fines
and forfeitures (for the same district and between the same
dates). 7th. That of the expenses paid from the Colonial Treasury
for services of (the same district and dates). 8th. That of the
number of immigrants at the expense of the land fund landed at
Brisbane (between the same dates). 9th. That of the number of
immigrants at the expense of the Imperial funds landed at
Brisbane (between same dates). 10th. Copies of all correspondence
and of memorials addressed by residents at Brisbane to the
Colonial Secretary, the Collector of Customs at Sydney, and the
Sub-Collector of Customs at Brisbane, relative to the Customs
Department and trade of the Port, together with copies of reports
made by the Sub-Collector to the Collector at Sydney, and
correspondence in reply thereto (between the same dates), 11th. A
return of the number of vessels and their tonnage that have
entered the port of Moreton Bay during the year 1849-1850 and to
the 30th September 1851, distinguishing during the years 1840,
1859, and to the 30th September, 1851, sailing vessels from
steamers. Seconded by John Richardson the motion was passed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The <i>Herald's</i> correspondent from
Brisbane, with reference to the election, says:&mdash;"For the
Boroughs there was a sharp competition between Mr. Richard Jones
and Mr. Henry Hughes. Mr. Hughes, apart from the vexed question
of transportation, would have been in every respect the best of
all the northern candidates. His manly address and gentlemanlike
manners commanded the respect of even his bitterest opponents.
His tardy renunciation of exileism lost him his election by a
majority of twelve. All persons of education thoroughly regret
the loss of Mr. Henry Hughes, of Gowrie, to the new
Council."]</p>
<p>On December 17 the Colonial Secretary laid upon the table the
returns moved for by the honourable member for the Stanley
Boroughs&mdash;R. Jones, which showed the revenue derived from
the various sources mentioned, to be £29,690 1s; the expenditure
to have been £28,042 11s 4d. Showing a balance in favour of the
revenue of £1647 9s 8d&mdash;on the 19th also, returns to the
address made by the member for the Stanley Boroughs relating to
the commerce of Moreton Bay; also returns to an address moved by
the same member as to the customs of the same port.</p>
<p>The opening of the year 1852 unfolded a new colour of
dissension. A letter appeared in the <i>Herald</i> of January the
16th, by the staff of which it was raised.</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="u">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;Perceiving
that you notice Dr. Lang's recent visit to Moreton Bay, and his
abortive attempts to procure subscriptions to enable him to visit
England as a delegate from the northern districts, I beg most
distinctly, on behalf of myself and a very great proportion of
the northern squatters, to repudiate any right that the
inhabitants of Brisbane possess to elect delegates for the
district generally. That Dr. Lang may be their choice I do not
wish to deny, but the northern squatters would scorn such a
representative. Acknowledging the universally admitted fact that
Dr. Lang is a man of talent, I contend that the squatters of this
district wish for something beyond that, and when they elect a
delegate to represent them in England, they will attempt to find
one in every way worthy of their confidence.<br>
<br>
"Personally, Dr. Lang is unknown to me, but in common with others
I am well aware of his character and career in this country as
well as in England, and beg leave to tell the reverend republican
that neither his practice nor principles will find favour with
Her Majesty's loyal subjects settled in these districts. I would
also remark that a very large proportion of the northern
squatters do noi desire separation from the middle district,
unless accompanied by exiles and a consequent government
expenditure.<br>
<br>
"In conclusion, I beg to say that I am, and have been for many
years, a plain practical squatter, more accustomed to look after
sheep and cattle than to conduct a newspaper controversy. If,
therefore, any of the reverend agitator's friends choose to take
up the cudgels in his part, they shall have the field to
themselves, as I am satisfied by having publicly denied that Dr.
Lang in any way represents the northern squatters: a body
comprising nine-tenths of the properly, education, and
respectability of these districts.</blockquote>

<p>In the nature of things came forth on the 17th "Leslie on
Separation," in the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
<blockquote>"Gentlemen.<br>
<br>
"Perceiving that in a letter signed 'Patrick Leslie', published
in your newspaper of this morning, the writer asserts what I have
already contradicted in your columns, I beg to repeat that Mr.
Leslie's assertion as to my having made 'abortive attempts to
procure subscriptions at Moreton Bay to enable me to visit
England as a delegate from the northern districts' is wholly
false and unfounded. I made no such attempts, either directly or
indirectly; but if the people of Brisbane and Ipswich&mdash;at
least, certain of the members&mdash;thought proper of their own
accord, and without prompting of any kind from me to contribute
towards my expenses in going home, not as a delegate, but as the
bearer of a petition, which I was authorised at two public
meetings in these localities to advocate and support, what is
that to Mr. Patrick Leslie? Did any of these people attempt to
interfere with him, and others like him, when conspiring with
their pecuniary means, and otherwise to degrade their adopted
country into a mere receptacle for English felons? As to Mr.
Leslie's disdaining me as a representative of the northern
districts generally, I have no wish, whatever to represent Mr.
Patrick Leslie and his friends in any way. They may do what they
please to get both convicts and Chinamen for me, but I shall do
what I can to prevent them, in a regular and constitutional way.
The petitions I am to carry home for separation without convicts,
but with a free immigration, speak for themselves, and they have
been numerously and respectably signed; but what is there to
prevent Mr. Patrick Leslie and his friends from getting up a
counter petition, if they please, to be sent home and supported
by their man Friday, Mr. Arthur
Hodgson?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
As to Mr. Patrick Leslie's career in this colony, what has he
ever done for the country beyond assisting in putting up public
prayers to the 'god' Grey for more convicts? He does not like me,
forsooth! I should be sorry if he did. I should be sorry to be
the object of his odious predilections. If I were only a felon, I
should, doubtless, find the way to his heart at once; for he
would then petition the 'idol' to have me sent to Moreton Bay,
where, of course, he would do his best to reform me.</blockquote>

<p>In March following, another moan over the "perfidy" of Lord
Grey, reached Sydney from the other side: "The Government, or
Lord Grey, which is the same thing," wrote the <i>Herald's</i>
correspondent, "will not retract an inch as regards
transportation to Van Dieman's Land, or the separation of Moreton
Bay, with the view of declaring that district a receptacle for
convicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our fears are realised, our scepticism is at an end; the storm
has burst, and whatever might have remained among us of reliance
on the common sense, the common justice, the common humanity of
the Secretary for the Colonies has been shivered by this
bolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The authority for this dreadful statement is the report of Mr.
King, the Victoria delegate, of what he had heard from Earl
Grey's own lips. So lately as the 25th of November that gentleman
had an interview with his lordship, who then distinctly informed
him 'that convicts would still be sent to Van Dieman's Land.' and
added 'that nearly every respectable man in the Moreton Bay
district had petitioned for separation.'"</p>
<p>In the May following, the recently formed "Northern Districts
Separation Association" made a call upon the members to meet at
Brisbane on Monday, the 17th of that month, for the purpose,
which became day by day more persistent, of adopting an address
to the Queen expressive of their unaltered views on the subject
of separation with exiles, and of thanking the Right Honourable
Earl Grey for his continuous determination to carry out the
wishes of a very large majority of the inhabitants of these
districts; and to take into consideration other matters connected
with their best interests. Patrick Leslie, Arthur Hodgson, and
Robert Ramsay made it from the committee room on Darling Downs.
The Sydney press became very bilious on hearing it: "Messrs.
Leslie, Hodgson, and Ramsay modestly setting themselves in array
not only against that great confederation which has bound these
communities together as uncompromising opponents to
transportation, but against the Legislative Councils of New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Van Dieman's Land. Three
squatters against four colonies!
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. True,
this felon-seeking triumvirate have an eye to their own district
only. All they request is that Her Majesty will be pleased to
erect Moreton Bay into a separate colony, and then employ it as a
penal
settlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The inhabitants of the northern districts have then to determine
whether, for the sake of supplying the squatters with cheap
shepherds, they will thus bring disgrace and demoralisation upon
their country; and whether, for the sake of pandering to the
perverse tastes of the Hodgson triumvirate, they will thank Earl
Grey for breaking his word."</p>
<p>The association was not cowed by the odds against it, and the
meeting was held and reported by the <i>Moreton Bay Courier</i>
on the 19th. The larger part, perhaps, of those present has
passed away; those who have not may yet find a peculiar interest
and much to reflect upon in the outcome of events in the interval
between then and now. I cannot put aside the details then given
in print, for the question of the day warmed up with fresh life
after that evening.</p>
<p>The attendance was large, and of not disreputable character,
very many of the largest proprietors of stock, including many
magistrates of the territory being present, as well as a
considerable number of the most influential inhabitants of
Brisbane, Ipswich, and the suburbs. On the motion of Magnus
McLeod, Esq., J.P., Mr. R.J. Coley was called to the chair.</p>
<blockquote>"The Chairman expressed his wish that some abler
person than himself had been selected. But in the meantime he
willingly accepted the office for the furtherance of what he
believed to be a desirable object. Before calling upon a
gentleman to move the first resolutions he would solicit their
attention lo the results of his own experience as an old
colonist. (Hear.) In the year 1821 he visited Van Dieman's Land.
It was then but a dependency of New South Wales, and the judges
came from Sydney to hold their sittings in the same manner as
they now come to Moreton Bay. Shortly afterwards it was
separated, and a Governor and suite were established there. Free
immigration took place, accompanied by prisoners, and the colony
immediately became a flourishing one. Without that impetus it
must have remained an insignificant and small settlement such as
Moreton Bay was likely to be without such assistance. So much for
the results of separation, and free and convict labour combined
in Van Dieman's Land. (Cheers.) In the year 1822 he had visited
Sydney, and at that time a person standing in one spot might
survey the whole of that now-important city, which then exported
about three hundred and forty bales of wool annually. (Loud
cheers.) When they considered the position which Sydney has since
attained, they would see the results of free and convict labour
combined there. He had also visited Melbourne, when it was not so
large as Brisbane. Subsequently financial separation was achieved
for that portion of the colony, and never was there an instance
of a city having so rapidly increased in wealth and prosperity as
did Melbourne from that time. But the key of her prosperity was
her close proximity to the labour market of Van Dieman's Land.
(Cheers.) Again, he said, so much for the effects of the joint
labours of the bond and free. If they considered their position
at the present time, it must be obvious that labour they must
have, or these flourishing districts must again become a
wilderness. (Cheers.) The squatters, who required this labour,
had been the pioneers of the country, and without them these
colonies would not have become, as they had the brightest gem in
Her Majesty's crown. He said, then, that whatever might be the
motto of the anti-transportationists, let theirs be 'Separation'
and Great Britain for ever! 'Before sitting down he must mention
that he had received several letters from gentlemen who were
unable to attend&mdash;these he produced. They were
from&mdash;Mr. Patrick Leslie, who had, unfortunately, met with
an accident which precluded his attendance; from Messrs St.
George Gore, Andrew, King, Laidley, Mort, and Borthwick. These
gentlemen apologised for their inability to attend, but all
expressed their warm approbation of the cause. (Cheers.) Me would
now call on Mr. Arthur Hodgson to move the first resolution.<br>
<br>
"Arthur Hodgson, Esq., J.P., on rising to move the first
resolution was received with prolonged applause; but before he
commenced his address, a Mr. Windmell desired to know whether the
meeting was a private or a public one. Some confusion ensued, and
the Chairman having been appealed to declared that the meeting
was a private one. Mr. Windmell, however, remained, but as he
several times subsequently interrupted, as he was smoking and
drinking at the Chairman's table, some gentlemen present insisted
on his silence. Mr. Hodgson, with considerable good humour,
declared his ability to proceed with his remarks notwithstanding
this opposition, but at last it became so troublesome that Mr.
Windmell was forcibly ejected. Considerable confusion and some
struggling took place in the course of these events, which we
mention here for convenience, although they I occurred from the
time of Mr. Hodgson's rising till that part of his address where
he referred to the dependence of these districts on the
production of wool and tallow. The police were called in, and the
chief constable afterwards attended, and declared his intention
of interfering to repress disorder, as the meeting had been
declared to be a private one.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Hodgson said that it was twelve months since he last had the
honour of addressing them in that place. Many then present were
absent now, and many whom he now saw were then absent. Amongst
those absent was one whose support had been most valuable, and
whose eloquence they had heard from the spot where he (the
speaker) now stood. He alluded to Mr. George Leslie, of Canning
Downs. (Cheers.) He had been obliged to leave them for a time;
but, like the bird which quitted with the autumn and returned
with the summer, he trusted that his absence also would be but
short, and that they would soon hail his return with as much joy
as they now sorrowfully regretted his departure. He regretted Mr.
Leslie's absence both on public and private grounds&mdash;on
public grounds because his assistance would have been valuable,
and on private grounds because he highly esteemed him as a friend
and a neighbour. His allusion to Mr. Leslie was not out of place.
It was known that a vacancy was supposed to exist in the office
which that gentleman had filled as representative of the
constituencies of Darling Downs and Clarence. No blame could
attach to Mr. Leslie for what occurred in this matter. That
gentlemen had on the eve of his departure placed his resignation
in the hands of a gentleman in Sydney, to be held by his
constituency if they pleased, but after due deliberation it had
been resolved not to make use of it. In the first place there was
a difficulty in finding a gentlemen competent to replace
him&mdash;that was, one entitled by local property and local
interests to fill such an office so well as Mr. Leslie&mdash;and
even if such a person could be found, he would not attend the
Council next month, for which time it had been summoned, and Mr.
Leslie had promised to return and resume his seat at an early
period if his health permitted. And it had not been forgotten
that Mr. Leslie, as a member of the Legislative Council, would
exercise a much greater influence in Downing-street than plain
Mr. George Leslie,, of Canning Downs. Besides, through the high
compliment which Sir Charles Fitzroy had paid to these districts
by the appointment of a popular gentleman resident in these
districts as a member of the Legislative Council&mdash;he
alluded, of course, to Mr. Henry Hughes. (Loud, unanimous, and
prolonged cheers.) He was glad to hear the manner in which they
had received the name of his friend Mr. Hughes. In consequence of
this appointment, he had been about to say, the temporary loss of
a representative would be less felt, because Mr. Hughes was well
qualified to perform the duties of a representative as well as a
nominee. (Loud cheers.) They had chiefly to thank that gentleman
for the large sum which had been devoted to the repair of the
roads in these districts. The local press had passed some remarks
about the non-attendance of some of the country members at the
opening of the Council. Mr. Leslie, Mr. Bigge, and Mr. Hughes
were of course alluded to; but he would remind the meeting that
the Council was called to assemble at a very short notice, when
these gentlemen were engaged in affairs of their own of much
importance to them. But, though absent then, they were present
when most wanted, as might be seen on reference to their votes in
the printed papers. He had intended to make some observations on
the attendance of other members, but he should forbear in
consequence of some things which had come to his knowledge since
he arrived in town, and more particularly as he saw present a
gentleman whom he was proud to observe there, although he had
been a little behind-hand. (Cheers.) But he would say that those
other members, although present at the early part of the
Council's sitting, were not present when they ought to have been.
He now begged to propose that the following resolution and
memorial be adopted:&mdash;'That the following address be
presented to Her Majesty the Queen expressive of the unaltered
views of the inhabitant householders in the northern districts on
the subject of separation with exiles':&mdash;<br>
<br>
"'<span class="u">To Her Majesty the Queen</span> in Council.<br>
<br>
"'May it please your Majesty: the humble petition of your
Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects of the present colony of New
South Wales lying to the northward of the thirtieth parallel of
latitude:&mdash;Respectfully showeth.&mdash;1. That your
petitioners have observed with great satisfaction that the news
of the gold discovery in New South Wales has produced no change
in the views of your Majesty's Government on the subject of
transportation to such portions of the Australian continent as
may express a wish for the introduction of convict labour.<br>
<br>
2. "'That the opinions of the inhabitants of the Middle District
on this subject having been found so diametrically opposed to the
wishes, and interests of the great majority of the northern
colonists, your petitioners were induced on a former occasion to
petition your Majesty to concede to them the boon of separation
with a view to the introduction of exiles into Moreton Bay, to be
accompanied by an equal number of free emigrants as proposed by
your Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.<br>
<br>
3. "'That the renewed efforts of the anti-transportationists in
the Middle District to thwart the views of your Majesty's
Government render it incumbent upon your petitioners to reiterate
their former opinions; to declare that they have undergone no
modification and to record their solemn protest against the
assumed right of the Anti-transportation League to interfere with
the wishes of the inhabitants of the proposed new colony; and
they further desire to express their utter want of sympathy with
the opinions at a late meeting held in Sydney, condemnatory of
those views of your Majesty's Government, which your petitioners
have so great a desire to see carried out.<br>
<br>
4. "'That the discovery of the southern gold fields is operating
most prejudicially to the interests of the stockholders and
employers of labour in the northern districts, where no
auriferous wealth is found to exist, and that the views expressed
in the petition already alluded to derive additional strength
from this circumstance.<br>
<br>
5. "'That your petitioners look to the introduction of exiles,
with an equal number of free emigrants, as the only means of
averting the many evils with which the continued introduction of
Chinese labour threatens the colony.<br>
<br>
6. "'That the good conduct and faithful services of the exiles
sent to Moreton Bay afford the strongest evidence in their
favour, and force upon your petitioners the conviction that their
continued introduction must be attended with the most beneficial
results, not only to the men themselves but to the welfare of the
district.<br>
<br>
7. "'That your petitioners therefore humbly pray your Majesty
will be pleased to direct that immediate steps may be taken for
the severance of the northern districts from New South Wales, and
that the northern colony may at once be declared a place to which
convicts may be sent on the terms proposed.'<br>
<br>
"Such was the petition which he trusted would meet with their
approbation and receive a larger number of signatures than any
document that had before been adopted in Brisbane. It spoke
plainly for itself and needed no explanation from him. But he
must not sit down without glancing at the effects which the
goldfields of Australia had had upon these districts. They had
drained the population as any person might see. In Brisbane, for
instance, they saw houses untenanted, business unprofitable, land
unsaleable. These facts told them but too plainly the truth. But
if any scepticism existed, let them look to the squatters'
stations, where they would find the plough idle, all improvements
stopped, and flocks of sheep mixed together so as to be injurious
to the fleece and to the carcass. And what had they to depend on
but wool and tallow.' It was the opinion of a practical
man&mdash;Mr. Hargraves&mdash;a name which was not only famous
throughout these colonies but in all parts of Europe through the
remarkable discovery he had made&mdash;it was the opinion of this
gentleman that no gold would be found in these districts. He was
not ignorant of the extraordinary rumours that had been
circulated relative to the discovery of gold. The <i>Moreton Bay
Courier</i> which he held in his hand said: 'Indeed in these
districts gold has already been undoubtedly discovered in small
quantities in several localities, and it has been shrewdly
conjectured that more extensive deposits would have been long
since brought to light but for the discouragement thrown upon
such enterprises by those who feared that their projects for a
supply of cheap labour might be thereby endangered.' This article
of the <i>Courier</i>, which he was sorry to say was taken in by
a few squatters in these districts (laughter and cheers, and
signs of disapprobation): this paper, he said, had distinctly
stated an insinuation against the squatters which was not true.
Had Mr. Bigge placed any obstruction in the way of persons
wishing to seek gold near his station? Had Mr. Leslie done so, or
did he not assist in promoting such a search? (A voice: 'I paid
three pounds towards it myself.') Had they not all striven to the
utmost to find gold? (Hear, hear.) He had had the pleasure of
meeting Mr. Hargraves, and did not think he was a man likely to
conceal aught he knew, as a tracing he held in his hand would
show. A letter had been addressed to Mr. Hargraves, and he would
read the reply. (The letter read by Mr. Hodgson stated in reply
to an application, that although Mr. Hargraves thought that the
application should have been addressed to the Colonial Secretary,
he saw no objection to saying that so far as his researches had
gone, he did not see the slightest chance of finding a
remunerative goldfield in the northern districts, and Mr.
Hargraves enclosed a tracing of the country he had examined.) He
therefore maintained that the absurd article in the
<i>Courier</i> was a nonentity and a falsehood. It was not for
them to follow the example of Sydney, and be bullied and
brow-beaten by the mammoth anti-transportation league; and he was
glad to see by the multitude around him that that was not to be
submitted to. Sydney was differently situated from Moreton Bay.
Sydney commanded abundant labour, and here none could be
obtained. Mr. King, the Port Phillip delegate, whom they must
admit to be a very well-informed man, stated in a letter to the
Council of the Melbourne League that he intended to take measures
for the purpose of assisting the Government in filling emigrant
ships for Victoria. (Extract read.) Now, if such difficulty was
felt in getting persons to emigrate to a rich gold-country like
Port Phillip, what inducement could be offered for them to come
to this <i>ultima thule</i>, where there was no gold? He lately
had the pleasure of signing his humble name to a petition for
direct immigration, but he doubted how far that petition would be
successful when it seemed that there was so much difficulty in
getting emigrants to proceed even to Port Phillip. The difficulty
of getting people to proceed here on their arrival in Sydney bad
been pointed out to him by Captain Brown, the immigration agent,
who said that they would not come. If free immigration could be
procured he would willingly dispense with exiles. A gentleman of
his acquaintance had recently paid £700 for land, and it had been
said that if the money had been paid into the Treasury a few days
before it was due, that gentleman would have been entitled to
nominate fifty emigrants to proceed hither. Some question having
arisen on this point, the Colonial Secretary was written to, and
his reply, which he now produced, stated, in effect that if the
money was paid into the Colonial Treasury thirty days before it
was due it would entitle the payer to nominate immigrants to the
extent of eighty per cent, on the amount. It appeared to him,
therefore, that a want of unanimity amongst themselves was the
chief cause of their want of emigration, since it could be
procured in this manner. He himself would undertake, if enabled
by such means, to introduce two ship-loads from the county where
his own father's property was situated. Want of unanimity,
therefore, was another serious reason why they should seek for
the kind of labour now sought, since it prevented the procuring
of that kind which would enable them to do without convicts. He
was aware that his own motives, in acting as he had done, were
aspersed, and that it was hinted that a snug appointment awaited
him, as soon as separation took place. (Laughter.) He could only
say, that he preferred a squattage on Darling Downs to any berth
the Government could offer him. (Cheers.) His motives were as
honest and his conduct as independent as those of any gentleman
here or elsewhere, and he had imported more labour than anybody
else, excepting Mr. Richard Jones, who brought about sixty
convicts here with his sheep. (Laughter.) He then referred to the
evil of Chinese labour, which was the only alternative if exiles
were rejected, and although these persons were distasteful to
him, he would call attention to the fact that there were on
Darling Downs about three hundred of them who were now taking
care of about four hundred and fifty thousand sheep of the value
of £90,000. He said, that, although they thus filled an important
gap, it was disgraceful that they should be introduced at this
rate, while thousands in Europe were tempted to crime, through
starvation at home. (Cheers.) From his own experience of the
exiles already introduced they were earning their livelihood, by
the sweat of their brows, and he denied the assertion that any
considerable number of them had left the district. He quoted
statistics to prove the reformatory character of the system which
had so immensely increased the commerce and productions of New
South Wales, and when Sydney orators talked of the system with
such disgust, it reminded him of the story of Sheridan, who, in
reply to various questions as to how he had procured a new pair
of boots, settled the question by declaring he had actually paid
for them. Thus the skilled politicians of Sydney might find a
simple cause for their own prosperity in the fact that the
British Government had introduced thirty-three thousand one
hundred and fifty-five convicts at a cost of £5,301,000.
(Cheers.) He conjured the meeting to cling together, not to
suffer the knife to be put between the tree and the bark; but on
grounds of philanthropy as well as expediency to adopt the
petition. Mr. Hodgson concluded amidst loud cheering. Mr. John
Harris seconded the resolution, which w'as put and carried.<br>
<br>
"F.L.M. Prior, Esq., moved the second resolution. He reminded
them how the uncertainty that existed on the subject of
separation had unhinged their projects, and left them all in a
condition unfavourable for exertion. If that uncertainty were
removed, then they might set their shoulders to the wheel and try
to improve their condition. If all their hopes of procuring a
regular supply of the only labour available were removed, they
might even then manage to import a modicum sufficient to enable
them to boil down their stock preparatory to deserting their
stations, and seeking their fortunes elsewhere. Squatting might
then become a thing of the past, and a new era commence. Whether
this would be beneficial or not he left to be decided by the
worst of their opponents. Certainly this result must follow if
they did not succeed in securing separation with exiles. In order
favourably to end the present uncertainty, it was desirable to
communicate with those who have power and influence to exercise
in their behalf. If they succeeded, they would be able to prove
that, although other colonies might revel in gold, their own was
contented to pursue its own humble course, desiring only that the
other colonies would leave theirs alone, and not blight it by
their baneful influence. (Cheers.) He would now read the
resolution:&mdash;'That the unsettled state of the separation
question is proving injurious to the welfare of the northern
districts, and that a letter be written to the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, urging him to expedite the accomplishment of
the views set forth in the memorial to the Queen.'<br>
<br>
"T.D.L. Moffat, Esq., J.P., seconded the motion. In his address
he 'urged them to dismiss all party spirit and lukewarmness, and
exercise their united efforts for the common cause. Persons in
this town have tried to disseminate ill feelings against the
squatters, but happily, without much effect. Their interests were
identical, and each class was necessary to the prosperity of the
other. This would be seen by the general ill consequences of the
present state of affairs. In Brisbane they saw houses untenanted,
streets deserted, and wharves without shipping. In the bush they
saw ruin before them, sheep without shepherds, improvements at an
end, and the most gloomy prospects in the distance. If the prayer
of this memorial was granted, there could be no doubt of their
rising from their present position to one of great prosperity,
and they would have the satisfaction of knowing that they had
assisted their own recovery, and at the same time, extended a
hand to receive their erring fellow creatures.' (Cheers.) The
resolution was put and carried.<br>
<br>
"Robert Ramsay, Esq., J.P., proposed the next resolution: 'That
this meeting desires to record its solemn protest against the
interference of the 'Australian League' on matters solely
affecting the interests of the northern squatters.' All must
agree in the principle here put forth, namely, the right of each
community to regulate its own affairs. The leaguers might seek,
as they pleased, to establish their will in Sydney, and they of
the northern districts had equally a right to carry out their own
views, and to take such steps as might conduce to their
fulfilment. (Cheers.) The Sydney and Port Phillip districts were
in an advanced and prosperous condition; the northern districts
were differently situated. He would direct their attention to a
remarkable fact. In these districts, there were about three
millions of sheep, and he would suppose that these required the
attendance of about three thousand shepherds and hut-keepers.
Now, there were about twelve hundred exiles and Chinamen employed
in such services, and therefore, it would be seen that from
one-third to one-half the sheep in these districts were being
taken care of by these men. He would ask any person how these
sheep could be kept alive without the services of those exiles
and Chinamen? (Cheers). Farmers might neglect their land and
postpone its cultivation to a favourable time, for they would
have the land at least to return to; but it was not so with
stock, which under such circumstances must perish. The answer of
the leaguers to this would be that plenty of immigration would
result from the gold discovery; but, judging from the result of
their previous predictions, what faith could they have in that
promise! Not many months ago the papers on that side were filled
with the wildest accounts of the probable effects of that
discovery, and from their statements it appeared that the only
difficulty would be in getting ships enough to bring out the vast
number of people who would want to come. But even if those
expectations had been in part fulfilled, the people would not
stay here. Mr. Hargraves had decided that there was no hope of
such discoveries here. To use his own words: 'When apples grew on
gum-trees there might be goldfields in this district.' Well,
then, they had only one resource, namely, to employ exiles or
Chinamen. He confessed that the introduction of convicts was an
evil if it could be avoided, but these Chinese were worse, and
the Attorney-General, who possessed great influence&mdash;which
no doubt he was fully entitled to&mdash;had declared himself
opposed to their introduction. They were thus reduced to exiles,
and here the 'League' opposed them. On all sides they were
surrounded by difficulties, and no path was opened to them but
through the 'League', unless that body would adopt the wiser
course of withdrawing an opposition, which for a time might be
mischievous, but could not ultimately succeed. Sydney and Port
Phillip boasted of the purity of their morals when they had
become wealthy, but he must say that he was somewhat of Lord
Grey's opinion on that point, as expressed in his interview with
Mr. King, and here he would read those two extracts. (The speaker
read an extract from Mr. Lamb's speech at a Sydney meeting saying
that the Van Dieman's Land people had denounced the immoralities
of the convict system, and an extract from the <i>Hobart Town
Guardian</i> expressing an opinion that if two thousand convicts
arrived they would be engaged within twenty-four hours.) He
sincerely wished that the people here were in the same position
as their neighbours of Sydney and Port Phillip; their views on
the convict question would then be identical. But to adopt the
views of those neighbours now would be, in effect, to depopulate
the finest portion of the colony, and ruin all who inhabit it.
(Applause.)<br>
<br>
"The resolution was seconded by R.R. Mackenzie, Esq., J.P.<br>
<br>
"G.K.E. Fairholme, Esq., J.P., had a few remarks to offer in
reference to the usual points of the question. Experience had
proved that a condition of prosperity always offered the best
inducements to good behaviour, particularly because it afforded
the means of giving a good education. (Cheers.) And it had been
abundantly proved that such a condition of prosperity here could
be best attained by a supply of labour. The exiles when they
arrived would see many persons who had worked their way up from a
similar position into wealth, and some into stations of
respectability. (Cheers.) This would naturally induce them to try
the same means of retrieving their characters, and surely British
law and British feeling were not so vindictive as to deny that
the men should raise themselves in this way. (Cheers.) As
regarded the statement that the proposed system would offer
inducements to crime, he presumed that those questions would be
duly weighed by the Imperial Parliament. He could say from the
examples they had witnessed that the greater number of the exiles
had entered their community with dispositions rather well than
evil-disposed. (Loud cheers.)<br>
<br>
"The resolution was then put and passed.<br>
<br>
"W.M. Dorsey, Esq., J.P., begged to move the next resolution:
'That the non-discovery of gold in the northern districts up to
the present time and the consequent drainage of population to the
southern goldfields renders the introduction of exiles the more
necessary.' He considered that the introduction of exiles would
be especially beneficial because they would exclude Chinamen,
whose presence he was by no means favourable to. And he
maintained that it was a most absurd position, to assert that one
crime should for ever exclude a man from society. (Cheers.) He
was reminded of Mr. Horton James' remark concerning the
distinctions in colonial society:
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
'those who had been detected and those who had not.' Now some of
those whom he had the honour of addressing had been detected and
some had not. (Laughter). Then why should they refuse to accept a
few more who had been detected. (Laughter and cheers). Why should
they say 'You stole a pocket handkerchief in Cornhill at such a
time, and, therefore, you shall not have a chance of earning £20
a year?' (Laughter and cheers.) He had known many men in this
district who came out as prisoners, and who were now living
comfortably with their wives and children. At the Ploughed
Station near Ipswich he had had opportunities of knowing many who
had since attained a better position; and there were men there
that night making hurrahs and disturbance, who had themselves
been in that condition. Again, he asked, why should they object
to their fellow-countrymen enjoying the same privileges which the
Government had granted to them.' (Loud cheers.)<br>
<br>
"Mr. Walter Gray felt proud to second the resolution, and could
but express his firm conviction that the sooner Earl Grey 'cut
the painter' which held them to Sydney the better. (Laughter and
cheers.) The resolution was then carried.<br>
<br>
"Dr. Cannan proposed the next resolution:&mdash;'That George F.
Leslie, Esq., member for the electoral district of the Clarence
and Darling Downs, in the Legislative Council, be delegated by
this association to carry out its views in England.' Although the
bad health of Mr. Leslie was deeply to be regretted it was yet
fortunate that they were enabled to secure his valuable services
in England. No one knew better than that gentleman what they
required, or was more likely to use active exertions in their
cause. He should only add that he hoped the Australian Leaguers
would receive such a lesson as would teach them to mind their own
business.<br>
<br>
"The resolution was seconded by Mr. William Kent, and then
carried."</blockquote>
<p>The <i>bête noire</i> of Lord Grey's boudoir was the incarnate
crime of the United Kingdom, with the disposal of which he had to
deal under altered circumstances of the colonies. The rivet of
purpose was now more firmly clinched by the golden hammer raised
against a felon's darkening the gates thrown open to the
Australian, in rivalry of Californian treasure-trove. "What can
be done with the convicts?" To his lordship such a meeting as
that just noticed must have been a peculiar picture of refuge,
and in the light under which it was placed must have been kept on
the easel of his thoughts as perspectively true in shaping a way
of escape from unceasing anxiety, annoyance, and difficulty.
"Separation there, with a clearing out of the gaols <i>here!</i>"
The latter chance, so golden to him, overlaid so much doubt,
caution, and hesitation in requiting the ready service. Lord
Grey's despatch to Sir Charles Fitzroy, dated 27th December,
1851, put all <i>but</i> the finishing touch to the scene of
which the stockholders of the north had not so long ago but drawn
the outline; and such confidently as they of Port Phillip had
neared the horizon of their desire in 1846, so now did the
pastoralists, <i>ultra citraque</i> Brisbane, seize on the
declaration of this official document in 1852:</p>
<blockquote>"Sir,&mdash;I have to acknowledge your despatch, No.
17, of the 29th of January last, enclosing a petition addressed
to the Queen by the residents whose names are thereunto attached,
in the districts lying to the northward of the 30th parallel of
south latitude, in New South Wales, praying for the immediate
erection of Moreton Bay and the surrounding districts into a
separate colony, and also that convicts might, on certain
conditions, again be sent there. I also received the letter which
accompanied that despatch from the Committee appointed at a
public meeting held at Armidale, in the district of New England,
on the 30th of December, 1850, enclosing resolutions then
adopted, urging that that district be included in the proposed
new Colony.<br>
<br>
"2. In accordance with the request which the same despatch
conveyed, I deferred the final consideration of those petitions
until I should have been placed in possession of the views of
your Excellency on the subject, together with such further
information as you then promised with respect to the resources,
expenditure, and population of the district of Moreton Bay. That
further information I received with your despatch, No. 70, of the
4th April, 1850, together with a further petition from others of
the inhabitants of the northern district, also praying for the
division of the colony, but protest against the resumption of
transportation to it in any form or upon any condition
whatever.<br>
<br>
"3. In intimating that their petitions have been presented to her
Majesty, you will acquaint the petitioners that the petitions
have undergone the careful consideration of her Majesty's
Government, and that, having consulted the law officers of the
Crown on the subject, I have been advised that the petitions
would be sufficient under the terms of the Act of Parliament
<i>to enable her Majesty to proceed at once to exercise</i> the
power it has conferred upon her, <i>by dividing the
colony</i>.<br>
<br>
"4. But upon considering the reasons urged in favour of that
measure by the petitioners, and those advanced in opposition to
it in the minute of the Executive Council, it has appeared to her
Majesty's Government that its adoption ought, at all events, to
be deferred. It is obvious that in the present condition of the
northern districts with so small a population, and so scanty a
revenue, the establishment of a separate government there would
be attended with some inconvenience, though I <i>do not doubt
that means might</i>, if <i>necessary</i>, be found for meeting
the expense of such a government on the very moderate scale which
would suffice in the first instance. It is thought desirable,
therefore, before such a measure is determined upon, to ascertain
whether, since the recent separation of Victoria, and the
consequent re-constitution of the Legislative Council, by which
the inhabitants of Moreton Bay will be better represented than
before in that body, they still combine to think that their
interests are not duly attended to by the legislature meeting at
Sydney. I should hope that this would not be the case, and that
the new Legislative Council will show such a proper regard for
the interests, and due deference to the wishes of the northern
colonists, as to satisfy them that there is no immediate occasion
to press for the separation of the district they inhabit from the
remainder of the colony, a measure which, with a view to the true
interests of ail parties, I should regard as premature.<br>
<br>
"If, however, the measures of the Legislative Council, after its
re-construction, should fail to give satisfaction to the
inhabitants of the northern districts; if they should, in
consequence, continue to entertain a decided opinion in favour of
a division of the colony, and should make known that opinion by
another petition to the Queen, in accordance with the Act, it
would, in my judgment, be proper that their wishes should be
acceded to, for the same reasons which have lately induced
parliament to divide the province of Victoria from New South
Wales; and I should be prepared accordingly to advise her Majesty
to exercise the power entrusted to her for that purpose.<br>
<br>
"6. As the resolutions agreed to at the meeting held at Armidale
proceed upon the supposition that Her Majesty would separate the
northern district from the colony of New South Wales, the course
which I have advised her to take on the present occasion renders
it unnecessary that I should advert to the recommendations they
contain respecting the boundaries proper to be assigned to the
new colony, should it be constituted at any future time.<br>
<br>
"7. With regard to the transportation of convicts to the northern
districts, as the division of the colony is at all events
postponed, the question does not arise at present, but I think it
right to point out that the Executive Council have put an
interpretation entirely different from what was intended, to bear
on my despatch of the 20th December, 1850, in which I stated that
convicts should not be sent to the northern districts of New
South Wales without the assent of the Legislative Council of New
South Wales; and have thus assumed the right of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales to exercise a power to which it has no
claim. That body is only entitled to express an opinion on behalf
of those whom it represents; and if the colony should be divided
and the inhabitants of the new province should, through their
representatives, ask to be allowed the advantage of convict
labour, Her Majesty's Government would see no reason for refusing
the request; though some of the conditions attached to the
application for convicts in one of the petitions now before me,
would not be advisable.'"</blockquote>
<p>In considering the tone of this despatch it must not be lost
sight of that Lord Grey had hoped that the Legislative Council of
New South Wales&mdash;as re-constituted after the separation of
Port Phillip&mdash;would not oppose transportation to her shores.
Between hope and doubt, language becomes muffled: the full
meaning garotted. Finding the front door shut, his lordship hoped
that convicts might be re-admitted by the back.</p>
<p>In the irony of such assurances, disappointment in each case
exacerbated the tempers of the expectants. Lord Stanley had but
just signified his approval of the separation of Port Phillip,
Lord Grey of that of the northern districts from New South Wales,
and immediate steps were to be taken towards its consummation,
when by their loss of office, through change of Ministry, the
burning question on both occasions was left to smoulder for years
afterwards. Armidale had but lately prayed to be included in the
new colony, and thence, in the south, to the farthest sheep-fold
in the north, gloom spread through the bush Sir John Pakington
succeeded Lord Gray in Downing-street. Not conspicuous in the
political world, the <i>Herald</i> at once declared "that he was
put into the Colonial Office as a makeshift to give place to a
man better known in the circle of statesmen, there can be little
doubt." He had been long member for Droitwich. Son of William
Russell, of Powick Court, Worcestershire, who married the
daughter of Sir H.P. Pakington, baronet, of Westwood, born in
1799, he had taken the name of Pakington when he succeeded as
heir to his maternal uncle, Sir J. Pakington, baronet, in 1830.
Was at Eton and Oxford. Lord Derby was now Prime Minister;
Disraeli Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the Executive Council respecting the
petitions mentioned during the August following would,
consequently, be laid before a new Secretary of State for the
Colonies, and the old ground examined by less accustomed eyes:
all to be gone over again! The report of the Council, in
mindfulness of this, was perhaps, more confidently compiled, in
deprecating the measure which had commended itself to Lord Grey.
His Excellency the Governor, the honourable the Colonial
Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer adopted
the following minute after considering each petition: "Having
attentively considered the petitions and other documents laid
before them, the Council feel it their duty to recommend that His
Excellency should strongly urge the Right Honourable the
Secretary of State to advise the Queen not to exercise upon these
petitions the power reserved to Her Majesty by the thirty-fourth
section of the Act of Parliament, 13 and 14 Victoria, No. 50, of
making into a separate colony such of the territories referred to
by the petitioners as lie to the northward of the thirtieth
parallel of south
latitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The return of revenue and expenditure submitted by the
Auditor-General shows sufficiently how very inadequate to the
support of a separate government is the 'general revenue'
collected in the district in question. The last year's revenue,
which was the largest received since the establishment of the
district of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842, having been
somewhat less than £5,500." Here follow the
reasons&mdash;needless to recapitulate. "The Council, therefore,
presume that if the Moreton Bay districts were detached from New
South Wales and formed into a separate colony, his lordship" [to
whose despatch this "minute" was the rejoinder] "would consider
that Her Majesty's government could not, consistently with his
pledge, give its sanction to the transmission of convicts thither
without the assent of the parent colony, which, from its
proximity, would necessarily be at least as much affected by the
measure as if the separation had not taken place. 'When called
upon in the year 1846, to advise the then Government as to
whether His Excellency should recommend the erection of the
district of Port Phillip into a separate colony, the council felt
strongly the objection that a compliance with the wish of the
inhabitants in that case might establish a precedent, which if it
did not lead to an actual sub-division of the colony into a
number of petty governments, might encourage district agitations
similar to that which was raised there. The council, in
consequence, thought it necessary to set forth at length the
circumstances which had long given to that district a character
of distinctness from the rest of the colony, and to state that
they advised the separation because they viewed the case as one
without a parallel in New South Wales, and as affording no
precedent, so far as existing settlements were concerned for a
further dismemberment of the colony.' 'The present position of
the district of Moreton Bay is characterised by no such
distinctness as that which formed the peculiarity in the case of
Port Phillip, and while they cheerfully give up territorial
importance which the loss of the fine province of Victoria will
entail on New South Wales; the council must claim for themselves
the liberty of stating freely their opinion, that a great
injustice would be done to this colony, were the northern
settlements which have been created by its capital and labour to
be now prematurely severed from it for no better reason which the
council can discover than the vague impression on the part of
some of the residents that great benefits would result from the
establishment of a government of their own, and an equally vague
apprehension on the part of others that their interests will not
be properly protected without a distinct legislature.'</p>

<p>In strange contrast with, and as a not inapt comment upon the
concluding paragraph of the minute, was the rejection of a motion
made by Henry Hughes, of Darling Downs, in the Legislative
Council on the 14th of the following
month&mdash;September&mdash;for leave to bring in a bill "for the
better administration of justice in the Moreton Bay district" by
a majority of three (after a debate in which the need of such a
step was not questioned) on the plea that an addition to the
schedule on the estimates of the sum required to meet the expense
attendant on such a concession&mdash;under £1,500&mdash;should
not be countenanced. This matter had been committed to Hughes,
because the representative of the Stanley Boroughs, Richard
Jones, was suffering from illness, which ended only in his death
at New Farm, Brisbane, in the next November.</p>
<p>From trial to triumph: from start to finish the final heat was
run by Queensland much in the same time as it had been by
Victoria. But, for the former, the course was not quite on a like
level; the "separation stakes" had swollen in value. For the
latter, was but the dull attraction of a crown colony: in the
former, light and sunshine whereby a people's growth to a free
self-sustaining stature might be straightway stimulated. The
aspirations of Austral Home-Rulers in all, save severance from
the Great Commonwealth, were about to be fulfilled in Wentworth's
* "thorough" design for an Æsonian Britannia, which should bring
out of the household of her history things new and old for the
world's teaching. The scene from which, in this fresh act of
colonial drama, the curtain was rising, already dazzled.
Inter-Australian for a moment slunk behind the stage from the
presence of separation standing before the people hand-in-hand
with the willing grasp of Imperial power. The broad
<i>principia</i> of our "consolidation" tabled upon live rock,
chiselled by the lion-hand of Wentworth were distracting all
thoughts: the ring of the metal failed not to reach the ears of
Brisbane.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Strafford to sight and sense.]</p>
<p>The Derby Ministry had collapsed in England on the 6th of
December, 1852. The colonies had fallen into the hands of the
Duke of Newcastle and other leaders such as Lords Aberdeen and
John Russell. Australia had cause to be grateful to the ejected
Ministry. It had given sound pledge for the blotting out of
transportation: of its own thought surrendered Crown prerogative
by yielding the disposal of the gold mines into the hands of
representative legislators: and the assurance of Sir John
Pakington to La Trobe by a despatch of the 2nd of last October,
and the re-assurance by his successor, the Duke of Newcastle, on
January 18, 1853; "That the appropriation of the moiety of the
Land-fund not reserved for immigration purposes hitherto vested
in the Lords of the Treasury be henceforth vested in "our
respective executives, were strong evidences of polite attentions
which bowed to the fellowship of our just, social equality.</p>
<p>By January, 1853, the "New South Wales Constitution Bill" had
been clearly read and digested at Moreton Bay. Then, the point of
the Australian Sampson's weapon was detected in a sly thrust at
the vital hope of northern deliverance. To eyes at that distance
the bill shrank by sixty-six parts of its bulk into two little
clauses which might, under happy-go-lucky circumstances, have
reached the discursiveness of a Committee of the Whole
House&mdash;had they met with no parrying remonstrance during the
three solid readings.</p>
<p>The Bill brought up by Wentworth "from the Select Committee of
the Legislative Council, appointed on the 20th May, 1853, to
prepare a constitution for this colony, and having had the
despatches relative to such constitution from Sir John Pakington
referred to them," contained the clauses which follow:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"51. For the <i>purpose of this Act</i> the
boundaries of the colony of New South Wales shall not be
curtailed on the north within the twenty-sixth degree of south
latitude, and they shall be on the south and south-west a
straight line drawn from Cape Howe to the nearest source of the
river Murray, and thence by the course of that river to the
eastern boundary of the colony of South Australia; on the east
the one hundred and sixty-second degree of east longitude; and on
the west the one hundred and forty-first degree of east
longitude, reckoning from the meridian of Greenwich.<br>
<br>
"52. No alteration shall take place in the boundaries of the
respective colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, or South
Australia, unless the <i>assent of the colony losing</i> any
portion of its territory by such alienation shall be expressed in
some legislative provision of such colony."</blockquote>
<p>Then there arose a commotion at Brisbane. To add to the
northern dread lest Wentworth's clutch should be too strong in
the wrestle for the best throw, the month of May gave a "knee" to
the Sydney champion and the "sponge" of a refreshing reply to his
"Grievances' Remonstrance." So be it! was echoed to his "No!"
more often than was expected. The north was becoming more
precious; better reason to keep it.</p>
<p>Thence, the quarter to the end of last March had brought
exported substance valued at £87,388&mdash;the largest yet! The
tides of the separation springs keep on ebbing and flowing, but
the waters in the same channel still hardly mingle. "Freedom and
independence of the mother country," under the pen of Dr. Lang,
still declared the substance of the desire of our colonists to be
to get rid of British connexion; separation of all
parts&mdash;New South Wales, Van Dieman's Land, Victoria. Cook's
Land, Leichhardt's and Flinder's Land&mdash;each, <i>per se</i>
and <i>sui generis</i>, apart from our Home Land. And yet, after
ten years' struggle, our grand old man himself pointed out the
feature of our day: "Whilst everything had been conceded on the
one hand, nothing had been <i>accepted</i> * nor insisted upon on
the other hand by our Home Land! Not a word had been said about
the civil or military expenditure of the colony. A civil list had
been stipulated for, sufficient for the purpose just, but nothing
more." Did not the applause of such words establish Wentworth's
footing in defence of these clauses so offensive to northern
proclivities?</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Minister had evidently thought the
proposals of the colonists, in their desire for the new
Constitution Bill, too liberal, and would not take them, as he
might, at their word.]</p>
<p>In nervous trepidation for his <i>protégés</i> in the County
of Stanley, did their honourable Custos Richardson (familiarly
called "Johnny ") confront the Legislative Council on Friday,
August 26th, 1853, holding a petition from Brisbane with a hand
and wrist, <i>en quarte et tierce</i>. His last feint was the
assurance that "the people of the north would stick to their
territory with a feverish grasp, and would never relinquish their
struggle for independence! "The lion's retort was but a "purr".
He had not yet been meshed by the net from which the teeth of
these little clauses were to let him go free. "But," he insisted,
"it was the manifest duty of that house to restore the old limits
of New South Wales."</p>
<p>"The honourable member (Mr. Richardson) seemed to have
forgotten that the 26th degree was the old established boundary
of New South Wales. (Hear, hear.) Now the clause in the Act 13
and 14 Victoria, which gave the Queen power, upon petition of the
inhabitants, to separate at the 30th degree of south latitude,
was not introduced with the view of benefiting Moreton Bay, but
merely to give Lord Grey another outlet for his convicts. (Hear,
hear.) It was an insidious clause inserted to forward sinister
views.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
He thought they had too many separations already: the only result
of this miserable policy would be that a series of petty, paltry,
insignificant states would be created, which would necessitate
the creation of a federal government, and end inevitably in the
overthrow of the British throne; and that was an evil which that
house was bound to oppose. (Cheers.) If he had had his way, that
brilliant province of Victoria, which was growing up so
democratic, would never have been separated at all. It was the
bounden duty of that House to restore the old limits of New South
Wales." (Cheers.)</p>
<p>The Attorney-General (Plunkett) added that "although this was
not the time to discuss these clauses "(having thought that
red-tape would bind them to the bill's several readings, and so
submerge them into the mud of committeeship) "he would but allude
to a letter published by one of the newspapers from one of the
honourable members from the northern districts (Mr. Stuart
Russell), in which he had stated his determination to oppose the
whole bill, and clause by clause, in committee, for the sake of
these offending sections Nos. 51 and 52." (Laughter.) "He (the
Attorney-General) hoped the honourable member would see reason to
let his rash vow lapse." (The honourable member did not, and the
"offending clauses" were eventually withdrawn by leave of the
house, before proceeding to the third reading of the Bill.)</p>
<p>The vexed people of the north came together in the next
November to adopt a petition, and protest to the Queen against
the efforts of the legislative council to deprive the northern
districts of the right of separation.</p>
<p>In marked relief to the determined aspect with which
Wentworth, the framer of this grand bill, had looked upon the
choler of the unruly separationists, was the lowered front with
which he addressed the legislative council on this subject in the
following December: "another alteration" (in the bill) "which he
intended to make had reference to the proposed boundaries of the
colony of New South Wales, (cheers.) In the original bill it was
intended to fix the northern boundary at the twenty-seventh
degree of S. latitude, but he proposed to alter this so that the
boundary should be fixed at such a limit as the commissioners of
Her Majesty should from time to time think fit. He was the more
induced to take this course, because the northern boundary was
the only one which was not fixed by Act of Parliament, and he
admitted if Her Majesty should choose to alter the present
boundary, and at the desire of the inhabitants erect the northern
districts into a separate colony, she ought to retain the power
to do so." (Cheers.)</p>
<p>And hence, before proceeding to the third reading of this
bill, on Tuesday, December 6th, clauses 51 and 52 were at
Wentworth's request withdrawn, and on division the ayes were
thirty-five, the noes nine.</p>
<p>That, after the debate on its second reading in last August
was ayes thirty-three, noes, five.</p>
<p>While the bill was under consideration by the Committee of the
Whole House, the Solicitor-General on the 15th December said:
"they were assembled under the Constitution Act for the purpose
of passing a Constitution for the colony: the power to fix the
boundary of the colony was reserved for the Royal prerogative:
and that to claim" (by clauses 51 and 52) "a power which has been
expressly reserved would be to endanger the whole of the bill.
Such a course would surely tend to prevent the Imperial sanction
from being granted to the bill."</p>
<p>In 1854, Gayndah and the Burnett stepped forth in antagonism
to Brisbane as the metropolis of the now confidently awaited
colony in the north.
Meeting&mdash;protesting&mdash;growling&mdash;chaffing and
chattering&mdash;the dwellers within its presumed borders already
began to rebel against the assumption that Brisbane was
necessarily the future seat of Government&mdash;the central depot
for all the good things looked for. This anti-Brisbane crusade
enrolled such names as W.H. Walsh, H. Herbert, William Forster,
Bouverie, Joshua Sewell, Robert Strathdee, H.H. Brown, William
O'Grady Haly, James Mackay, G. Sandeman, G.N. Living, Charles
Archer, John Livingstone, H. Palmer, E.B Uhr, J.D. McTaggart,
Archibald M. Thomson, Clement Lawless, W. Elliott, W. Young,
&amp;c. Brisbane's abuse of her rivals, by letters and
newspapers, enriched the very license of language. To her
everything external smacked of Galilee. For lack of something to
quarrel with during a lull, the <i>Courier</i> of April affirmed
"that the squatting community numbered amongst them a few who, as
their own fortunes are not permanently identified with this land,
think it better to secure the support of Wentworth's party on the
squatting question than to separate from that party for the mere
purpose of saving the northern districts from perpetual obscurity
and misgovernment."</p>
<p>As the latter days of northern subservience to New South Wales
drew on to a close, the two antagonistic platforms from which its
emancipation had been preached, met in a struggle for a seat in
the council chamber from which both parties had been straining
for sunderance. The county of Stanley was inquiring for a
representative in the room of Richardson, who had gone home. The
consequent election became a matter of amusement; much
excitement; and promised an interminable squabble. In relating
it, I have in mind the influence which the result might have, I
then thought, and still believe, did have upon the immediate or
deferred grant of separation by the home government. I have no
reason to think, at this day, that I was mistaken as I watch the
signs of the times in the far North of this present year, 1887.
Five years kept us in further bondage, after the final decision
by which Dr. Lang took his seat as member for the county of
Stanley, on Tuesday, the 29th August, 1854.</p>
<p>I began this record with Hodgson and our "endeavour:" it shall
end with Hodgson and our "separation". Let Queensland be but true
to herself, and, through her prestige, just to her tenderest
shoots under the sun of the present day, and I may feel secure of
her indulgence to the poor scribbler of these her nursery
tales.</p>
<p>In April, 1854, the candidate for this vacant seat was Dr.
Lang.</p>
<p>To within an hour or two of the time appointed for nomination
it was supposed that there would be no competitor, but "about
that time" said the Moreton Bay Free Press "it was rumoured that
another candidate was in the field, and near the hour of
nomination, H. Stuart Russell, Esq., M.L.C., drove into Brisbane
accompanied by Mr. Arthur Hodgson and several, other gentlemen,
which left no doubt on the subject." Ambrose Eldridge proposed
Dr. Lang, seconder&mdash;Robert Cribb. Dr. Kearsey Cannan, Arthur
Hodgson; seconder&mdash;George Raff.</p>
<p>Arthur Hodgson, amidst loud applause, groans and hisses, said
with his usual smile of confidence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That he came there, as they had been told, to
solicit the suffrages of his brother electors and townsmen, and
in appearing before them he verified the prognostications of the
gentleman who had proposed Dr. Lang, and rose as a 'plant',
hoping that he (Mr. Eldridge) might cultivate on his cotton farm
as well-grown, flourishing plants as the humble individual who
now addressed them. (Laughter.) He admitted that he laboured
under many disadvantages, but he hoped, before resuming his seat,
to clear away some. Asked for a fair and impartial hearing,
similar to that which had been granted to his reverend opponent
in the public meetings he had held in that town and Ipswich
during the
week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
His disadvantages were&mdash;first, that he was opposed to a man
of great ability as well as energy, and he was willing to give
Dr. Lang every credit for both, but he (Arthur Hodgson) would
yield to no one in the northern districts for energy and
perseverance. (Cheers.) Secondly, his name, owing to
circumstances to which it was unnecessary to allude particularly,
had not been brought before them by the public press as a
candidate. He had no intention of coming forward until last
Saturday night, when he received a requisition accompanied by
strong promises of support, and he then gave up his passage in
the 'Shamrock', forwarded his wife and family to Sydney alone and
unprotected, and made up his mind to contest the election with
Dr. Lang although so late in the field. (Cheers and hissing.) Mr.
Hodgson here read the following paragraph, which appeared in the
<i>Courier</i> of April 14, and which, he had reason to believe,
was intended to do him a serious injury, in the event of his
entering the lists against Dr. Lang:&mdash;'There is too much
reason to believe that, in the course of his Excellency's ride
over Darling Downs some insidious and treacherous whispers have
reached him as to the policy of withholding separation until Mr.
Wentworth's Constitution Bill becomes the law; but we entertain a
confident hope that if there be, indeed, in our camp traitors who
would strike such a blow at the material prosperity of the
country that has made them what they are, they will earn their
reward in the ignominous rejection of their darling project
amidst the hootings and derisive laughter of the free-spirited
people of England." That paragraph, if directed against himself,
was as 'false as hell.' (Cheers.) He pledged his word and honour
during the tour of his Excellency through the district of Darling
Downs, and during the time he was in his Excellency's company
under his (Mr. Hodgson's) humble roof, not one word had been
dropped by him on the subject of 'separation', and as far as he
knew none of his brother squatters had whispered anything
'treacherous or insidious' into his Excellency's ear. Further,
his Excellency had too much good sense and tact to receive such
whispers had the attempt been made. (Cheers with loud marks of
disapprobation.) Those whispers, if made at all, might have been
made nearer Brisbane than Darling Downs. (Cheers.) He wished now
to explain his political opinions on one or two points. He
pledged himself to 'go the whole hog' for separation; without
such a pledge he knew that his return was impossible. The
feelings of the community were pledged to 'separation', and if
elected, he would do all in his power to bring about such a
desirable object. (Cheers.) He would take the liberty of reading
a letter which had been handed to him that morning by his
esteemed friend and relative, the honourable member for the
Stanley Boroughs, who had received it by the overland mail on
Saturday last. It was a nobleman with whose name they were all
familiar, the right honourable Earl Grey. (Shouts, cheers,
hisses.) You will not hiss when you hear the contents of the
letter:<br>
<div style="margin-right:5%; text-align:right;">"Howick, Dec. 23,
1853.</div>
"<span class="u">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I have had the honour of receiving the duplicate of your letter
of August last, enclosing a copy of one which you have addressed
to the Duke of Newcastle, urging the separation of the northern
districts from the colony of New South Wales.<br>
<br>
"I have always, as you must be aware, been of opinion that
eventually Moreton Bay, with the territory dependent upon it,
would require to be divided from the colony of New South Wales,
for the very same reasons which rendered a similar measure
necessary with respect to the Port Phillip district, which is the
Colony of Victoria. I considered it to be only <em>a question of
time</em> when the separation should take place. Provision was
accordingly made for this further division of the original Colony
of New South Wales in the Australian Constitution Act, which was
passed while I held the seals of the Colonial Department.<br>
<br>
"Whether the proper time for the contemplated creation of a
district government of Moreton Bay may be yet come, is a question
on which I should be sorry to express a decided opinion without a
fuller knowledge than I possess of the objections which may have
been urged to it, but I have no hesitation in saying that the
events of the last two years, and the manner in which the
interests of the northern part of the colony have been dealt with
by the existing legislature of New South Wales appear from your
statement to afford strong arguments in favour of the
<i>immediate</i> adoption of the measure.<br>
<br>
"I have only to add that the clause which you state to have been
introduced into the Constitution Bill now before the legislature
of New South Wales, and which purports to prohibit the formation
of a new colony south of the 26th parallel of south latitude
would, I apprehend, be of no force even if it should be passed.
No Colonial Legislature can possess power to control the Imperial
Parliament, or to limit that authority to determine the
boundaries of the several British colonies, which belongs to the
Crown and to Parliament.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. Hodgson continued: He was surprised and
astonished not to see his reverend opponent within those walls:
he considered it a mark of great disrespect to the constituency.
No matter how great the Doctor's power of eloquence, he would
have been glad to have measured weapons with him on this
good-humoured field of battle. (Cheers.) No doubt the Doctor
would have given him many heavy broadsides, but like the Turks at
Sinope he (Mr. H.) would have suffered extermination before he
would have surrendered. (Loud cheers and hisses). As the Doctor
had no interest here, perhaps he did not think it worth his while
to remain, remembering the ditty learned in his
childhood&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="poem"><small>"He that fights and runs away<br>
May live to fight another day?"</small></p>
<blockquote>And it was not improbable that the Doctor might have
to fieht this battle over again, for he (Mr. H.) was determined
to go to the poll. (Loud cheering.) He appealed to the electors
if, during the fourteen years he had been amongst them, he had
not always acted in an honest, conscientious, and independent
manner. (Cheers.) He was no Government toady, he sought no
Government appointment, and if he could not boast of the ability
of his opponent, he could equal him, at all events, in honesty of
purpose and integrity of action. (A voice: 'Dr. Lang might have
been returned for Sydney.') Then why the devil isn't he?
(Thunders of applause.) Mr. H. then made allusion to the
immigration scheme of Dr. Lang, and said that as the Doctor had
promised to take four shares himself, that circumstance was
sufficient to deter others from joining, as he had never
succeeded in any scheme where money and companies were concerned.
Within the last week, £1800 had been deposited in the hands of
the Government Resident, under the Land and Deposit regulations
of June, 1852, and this did not augur too much confidence in Dr.
Lang's scheme. By such individual exertions they would obtain
sufficient labour to relieve the pressing and imperious
necessities of this flourishing district. The Doctor had clearly
expressed an ill-feeling towards the squatters, and talked of
going to the left while they went to the right. And, instead of
advocating unity, he had introduced himself in the shape of the
tall man in black coming down the chimney, for the purpose of
lighting up the embers of discord amongst a happy and united
people. (Loud cheers.) He, on the contrary, advocated unanimity
and good feeling amongst the commercial, agricultural, and
pastoral interests. He would remind them that now, when the
squatters were well off, the townspeople had risen with their
prosperity, and when they were poor they had equally shared in
their decline. But what we wanted now was 'Separation'. That boon
obtained they could, if necessary, fight amongst themselves.
(Cheers.) How different was the state of affairs at the time when
he (Mr. H.) was selling, legs of mutton in the town of Brisbane!
He was proud to acknowledge it. But why did he do so? To pay his
debts. (Cheers.) In conclusion, he (Mr. H.) stated that he was an
advocate of the National system of education as being more
comprehensive, and better adapted to the wants of such a scanty
community, interspersed with so many religious sects and
opinions. But, with the exception of separation, he would give no
pledge whatever, and if, in regard to his other political
opinions, no confidence could be placed in him, he would decline
entering the council chamber at all. (Cheers.) He was now in a
position to give up a considerable portion of his time to
legislative duties, and, if he had not the <i>fortiter in re</i>,
he was, at all events, possessed of no inconsiderable quantity of
the <i>suaviter in modo</i>, a quality far more conducive to
their interests than the bitter, rebellious sentiments of his
reverend opponent." (Mr. Arthur Hodgson resumed his seat amidst
loud and continued cheering, mingled, of course, with
hisses.)</blockquote>
<p>A hitch in the Drayton return kept all on tiptoe! for those
from Brisbane and Ipswich gave Doctor Lang a majority of nine.
"At four o'clock on Thursday afternoon," then cried out the
<i>Moreton Bay Courier</i>, on the 27th May, "Major Prior the
returning officer, announced the result" from all three
polling-booths to be a tie of fifty-seven votes for each
candidate. The returning officer gave his casting vote in favour
of Arthur Hodgson; exception was afterwards taken to one of
Hodgson's supporters; this disturbed the equanimity of Charles
Cowper in the Sydney chamber; discussion within its walls kept
poor Hodgson outside in the cold for an hour: upon his admission,
took his seat; barely warmed that, for he at once withdrew. Then
again, in spite of proclamation by the <i>Government Gazette</i>
of June 19, which declared the election of Arthur Hodgson had
been "valid" the chamber again fell out, not upon the merits or
otherwise of the election itself, but those of the returning
officer; the matter being so stirred up by petitions presented by
Dr. Lang:&mdash;which having upon Cowper's motion, been referred
to the Select Committee of Elections and Qualifications, produced
on the 5th July, the conclusion that the election for the county
of Stanley was void! By the end of the month Lang and Hodgson
were again in the ring&mdash;stripped. In August the fight began,
and ended on the 10th: Hodgson had no need to stop his "crowing",
notwithstanding his clerical opponent's heating the seat in
Macquarie street (which he himself had not had time to warm) on
Tuesday, 29th of the same month, under the broody wings of John
Campbell and Henry Parkes, set apart for a representative of the
seceding county of Stanley.</p>
<p>Before the curtain drops: before the judge's flag is lowered,
little remained of action to New South Wales over the course of
separation of north from south. The stamp upon it was to be
dropped by a hand in the imperial service of the people: by the
will of wisdom, which had matured beneath the discipline of its
own&mdash;and colonial industry. Petitions presented: motions
brought forward to keep the north lively under the sickness of
hope deferred, by the several delegates whom it despatched to the
Sydney chamber, sustained the interest of the dwellers in both
extreme parts. It was well seen that the finishing stroke could
be dealt but by one instrument, Thor's hammer wielded in
Downing-street. There, in unison, could northern voices swell the
appeal for the final blow, which should shatter and yet weld:
dissolve, yet consolidate: "cut and shut "the tire of our
Colonial and Imperial wheel, that each felloe might rest within
the equal coil.</p>
<p>The blow was struck: the hunt was over: the northern pack was
kennelled: the staunch race run out, and the brush presented to
the fresh hand of Queensland, at her palace gates, as the sun was
setting over the grave, in which the year of grace eighteen
hundred and fifty-nine had buried the past, by that of head-whip
Sir George Fergusson Bowen.</p>

<br>
<div style="margin-left:25%; font-size:90%;">There is a history
in all men's lives,<br>
Figuring the nature of the times deceased:<br>

<p><span class="a">Surely</span> the bitterness of separation,
hitherto, has passed as a storm that has blown by: may be met now
with no alarmed nor party spirit.</p>
<p>Intercolonial and mother-country claims may surely formulate a
<i>concordat</i> between subdivisions of their own fellow
countrymen's territory. Such separations&mdash;the incorrect
phrase used for fresh junctions&mdash;are but those of the
component parts of chain cable, of which not one can be stronger
than its weakest link. Separation only in so far as the need of
the strength of union: and only strength in respect of the vigour
needed by the girth and power of each member of a united empire's
conditions.</p>
<p>If the branches which spread themselves far from the
Anglo-Saxon stem ever yield themselves in fixed and imperturbable
trust to being housed by a great confederation, old England will,
I dare look up and say, place the crown upon an edifice of which
these distinct proportions shall have laid the foundations, and
that upon an impregnable rock.</p>
<p>If by division of federal labour, this building, be ever
raised, it must have a foundation. What foundation more solid
than the experience of our British history? The trials and
troubles of our common country from Alfred to Victoria the Great?
Federated, the whole Empire will be but a "re-casting" all of one
piece. If a people may be said to be truly great in proportion to
the greatness and multiplicity of the contrasts which a man truly
great is said to combine in his own person, surely the British
Empire in faithful combination may be the greatest of the great
in due time. Once effected, the preservation of the bond would be
the task of patience, justice, and wisdom, set by the love of our
race's progress. Take a look through the kaleidoscope shaped by
the hands of her experience. They have had, and yet have to deal
with no materials displaced in, nor foreign to, humanity's
texture. Education, civilisation, christianising will not change
the innate characteristics of a man; they comfort, ameliorate,
pilot: shift from one position to another. Appearances may
present varied and fantastic shapes, but the particles have not
been removed; the changes are to the eye, not in fact. We have
accepted for our foundation stone that on which Great Britain's
people have stepped their liberty, bedded in the
principle&mdash;identical, however malleable&mdash;of the
constitution by which she stands. Glance through that focus at
the numberless gatherings together in her name on the earth. That
one mainspring of their action&mdash;Freedom&mdash;ever wound up
to meet the strain of social order, individual and general
rights, points the hand of almost every hour to many a prismatic,
fantastic, and may be, capricious image of what <i>should</i> be
the standard of contented and prosperous citizenship: such images
of whatever form, do not lose symmetry: they assume but freshly
evolved shapes in which hope for country and kindred clads
herself.</p>
<p>Not by Portuguese, not by Dutch, nor Spaniards, nor French,
was Australia's passport sealed to the world towards which she
was travelling. She would have withered by the way and lain in
half-caste waste beneath the mighty selfishness which blighted
the pretensions of any such European power. The isolated grandeur
of political centralisation such as that of Rome of old girded
her with the Nessian tunic; and so she was consumed by the poison
of her corrupt individualism. The severally-willed distinctions
of the united members of a greater&mdash;the British&mdash;empire
will, it may be hoped, yet set each governing power striving in
glorious emulation after the development of its own inherent
manifold faculties, towards an unreached supremacy.</p>
<p>Great Britain has not crossed the line which de-marks the
prime of life: nor has she in her course to look back upon the
meridian of that point on the arch of time whence completion
insensibly droops into the stoop of declining doubt. That point
is still far a-head: it is the keystone on which that arch rests:
the pledge of her earthly irrefragability: imperial union.</p>
<p>Christianised civilisation as the ultimate object: subdivision
as a safeguard from exhaustion: governmental vigour of which the
mechanism may not be too bulky for smooth, secure, and accurate
action, clearing the path to the glorious goal: purity of public
purpose and counsel, the threshold to be stepped on and crossed
before consecrating the course of so exalted a political
existence, which shall reach out to fellowship with the peoples
of the earth&mdash;and war, the deluge of blood and iron, shall
sink away into the distance of tradition, sepulchred beneath the
rainbow of peace&mdash;the archway over the entrance to the road
beyond.</p>
<p>Aye! In our history the occasions of a people's general
jubilee have been scant: not for lack of tumultuous triumphs and
events in the variety of which a people's character has passed
through fire to refinement, but scant in the elements from which
the quality of a people's sovereign weal are indurated and
chiselled. But in this our year of rejoicing&mdash;rejoicing?
why?&mdash;for the advance, however halting, towards that
threshold to which loyalty to the sister-crowned symbol of their
race's power, whose throne they bear upon pillars carved by the
disciplined hand of unerring principle, and principle-pillowed
public opinion&mdash;impels us, in just recognition of Her purity
of purpose, and counsel: of Her loyalty Heavenwards and
earthwards.</p>
<p>Beyond? Aye! even in this Helot day of doubt. Beyond! Look
back: we surrender to Time in its advancing and passing, and then
past present, the truth of its service fulfilling Promise by
Wisdom to this sandstone world, to which we are but clinging
limpets: to Time trained to striking the hour of its own passing
away: "Sweep away," cries Carlyle "the illusion of Time; glance,
if thou have eyes, from the near-moving cause to its far distant
mover;" and what see we? Types&mdash;for human sense&mdash;of an
end: types but parables for lessoning: shadows of things
intervening: light above. Typical only by the more excellent
virtue of antitype. Reflection from the real: hope embraced by
fruition.</p>
<p>A highway shall be levelled to that path beyond on which I may
not step: and "to it shall the Gentiles seek," "and it shall come
to pass in that day that" the "Hand" shall again "be" set the
second time to recover the remnant of His people and from the
<i>islands of the sea</i>.</p>
<p>Had Israel no meaning? Had the Gentiles no lot to stand upon
in the design of Universe? We name creation "universe": is it not
a turning-into one? The &tau;&omicron; &Eta;&#8112;&nu; of those
men of old straining in darkness who comprehended not the
light?</p>
<p>But why stand still, gazing inexpressionless? All men think
limitable thoughts ever "stretching to" the illimitable. Advance
Australia! is her conscious heart's cry: the world, old and "new"
Britannia in a wider and yet wider significance: separate but in
humanity's Babel-bricks, awaiting the cement of no "untempered
mortar": advance to what? The question is uneasy in expectation:
no sigh of expectation to men believing in the path beyond.</p>
<p>But the poor lark <i>will</i> soar: though his place is still
on the soil humblest under the sun!</p>
<p>Is it the destiny of this strange Anglo-Saxon race sprung from
the union of so many separate tribes, to act out faithfully such
a part in the great drama? If imagination be not cowed out of the
exercise of its special function, property, and prerogative, may
it not be permitted me to conjure up a concrete form, in which an
abstract idea can be so vestured? May I not be suffered to
indulge myself&mdash;in love and admiration of our common and yet
many palaced-home&mdash;in a reverie in which the contemplation
of such an image fascinates irresistibly thoughts so possessed
and preoccupied? A certain man&mdash;eminent in the crowed of his
exalted race&mdash;the people chosen of old, not long ago was
gathered to his fathers. Of his lone, ancient, theocratic nation,
the first descendant over whose shoulder the sceptre of honour
was extended by the hand of a British sovereign&mdash;a
girl-queen, yet uncrowned&mdash;to lay thereon a first pledge of
dignity, as an earnest of true British citizenship; the years of
that one man's life bridged a span over which the goddess-steps
of Australia have not yet glided <i>pari passu</i>. That one
man's days on earth began and went ahead of the tens of thousands
of lives which have committed themselves to this great South land
since the leverage of her first centenary has raised her out of
the deep, and who have found their graves here. Australia has not
stridden yet over the ground of that one weak human creature's
pilgrimage. Yet look around! See what she can lay claim to under
the testimony of but one. If then what she is, who dare say what
she may not be in the fullness of her own days? A mere dreamer
will not way-lay ridicule&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">"Do what he will, he cannot realise<br>
Half he conceives&mdash;the glorious vision flies.<br>
Go where he may, he cannot hope to find<br>
The Truth, the beauty pictured in his mind."</p>
<p>My Black Swan has fluttered out its feeble flight from beneath
the never-folded wings of our Australian Clio. Its dying strain
shall be: "Ah! that the separate elements of British Ocean Empire
may be travailing with a p&oelig;an of united jubilee shouts,
proclaiming the ideal yet legitimate Genesis of a Queensland
isle&mdash;sceptred one, and mighty to</p>

<p><span class="a">To</span> myself it does not seem reasonable
to present subordinate occurrences in a drama, without rehearsal
of preceding action conspicuous and authoritative in its original
conception Galvanised by earlier history and tradition, energies
of a like character in the present may transmit similar vitality
to the future through the battery of emulation, as occasion may
hail them. Whatever the wandering Æneas may have done in
consecrating the soil of Ausonia, Australia had more faithful
heralding to the world through the epic of James Cook. He first
lent a hand to drawing up the curtain from Queensland's
sun-shelf. It is pleasant yet to look upon the scene which he
disclosed with such marvellous and well-tested accuracy.</p>
<h4><span class="a">Extracts from Cook's Journal</span>.</h4>
<p>Overhauling his journal: * "Monday, 14th May, 1770. As we
advanced to the northward from Botany Bay the land gradually
increased in height, so that in this latitude 30 deg. 22 min. S.
it may be called a hilly country.</p>
<p class="foot">[* From papers compiled by John Hawkesworth,
L.L.D., and printed for W. Strahan and T. Cadell, in the Strand,
London: 1773.]</p>
<p>"15th May. At noon our latitude by observation was 28 deg. 39
min. S., and longitude ** 206 deg. 27 min. W., a high point of
land, which I named Cape Byron, bore N.W. by N. at the distance
of three miles. It lies in latitude 28 deg. 37 min. 30 sec. S.,
longitude 206 deg. 30 min. W., and may be known by a remarkable
sharp-peaked mountain, which lies inland, and bears from it N.W.
by W. From this point the land trends N. 13 W,</p>
<p class="foot">[** Longitude computed west of Greenwich.]</p>
<p>"16th. We made sail, and at daylight were greatly surprised to
find ourselves further to the southward than we had been the
evening before, though the wind had been southerly and blown
fresh all night. We now saw the breakers again within us, and
passed them at a distance of one league. They lie in latitude 28
deg. 8 min. S., stretching off east two leagues from a point of
land under which is a small island. Their situation may always be
known by the peaked mountain which has been just mentioned, and
which bears from them S.W. by W. For this reason I have named it
Mount Warning.</p>
<p>"The land about it is high and hilly, but it is of itself
sufficiently conspicuous to be at once distinguished from every
other object. The point off which these shoals lie I have named
Point
Danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At sunset, the northernmost land bore N. by W., breakers N.W. by
W., distance four miles, and the northernmost land set at noon,
which formed a point, and to which I gave the name of Point Look
Out, W., distance five or six miles in the latitude of
twenty-seven degrees six minutes. On the north side of this point
the shore forms a wide open bay, which I called Moreton's Bay, in
the bottom of which the land is so low that I could but just see
it from the topmast head.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 17 May. The land that was farthest to the north the
night before now bore S.S.W,, distance six leagues, and I gave it
the name of Cape Moreton, it being the north point of Moreton's
Bay. Its latitude is twenty-six degrees fifty-six minutes, and
its longitude two hundred and six degrees twenty-eight minutes.
From Cape Moreton the land trends away west, farther than can be
seen, for there is a small space where at this time no land is
visible, and some on board having also observed that the sea
looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of
Moreton Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fathom
water and a fine sandy bottom: this alone would have produced the
change that had been observed in the colour of the water; and it
was by no means necessary to suppose a river to account for the
land at the bottom of the Bay not being visible, for supposing
the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a hundred
other parts of the coast, it would have been impossible to see it
from the station of the ship; however, if any future navigator
should be disposed to determine the question, whether there is or
is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us
to do, the situation may be always found by three hills, which
lie to the northward of it, in the latitude of twenty-six degrees
fifty-three minutes. These hills lie but a little way inland, and
not far from each other: they are remarkable for the singular
form of their elevation, which very much resembles a glass house,
and for which reason I called them the Glass Houses: the
northernmost of the three is the highest and largest; there are
also several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these,
but they are not nearly so remarkable. At noon, our latitude was,
by observation, 26 degrees 28 minutes south, which was ten miles
to the northward of the log, a circumstance which had never
before happened upon this coast.</p>
<p>"Friday, May 18. The point we had set the night before bore,
at daylight, S.W. by W., distance between three and four leagues.
It lies in latitude twenty-five degrees fifty-eight minutes,
longitude two hundred and six degrees forty-eight minutes west.
The land within it is of a moderate and equal height, but the
point itself is so unequal that it looks like two small islands
lying under the land, for which reason I gave it the name of
Double Island Point; it may also be known by the white cliffs on
the north side of it. Two water snakes swam by the ship: they
were beautifully spotted, and in every respect like land snakes,
except that their tails were broad and flat, probably to serve
them instead of fins in swimming,</p>
<p>"Saturday, May 19. At one o'clock, being still four miles
distance from the shore, but having seventeen fathom water, we
passed a black bluff head, or point of land, upon which a great
number of the natives were assembled, and which therefore I
called Indian Head, it lies in latitude twenty-five degrees three
minutes.</p>
<p>"Sunday, May 20. At daybreak, the northernmost land bore from
us W.S.W., and seemed to end in a point, from which we discovered
a reef running out to the northward as far as we could see. We
had hauled our wind to the westward before it was light, and
continued the course till we saw the breakers upon our lee
bow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This point I named Sandy Cape, from two very large patches of
white sand which lay upon
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The direction of the shoal is nearest N.N.W. and S.S.E. It is
remarkable that when on board the ship we had six fathom, the
boat, which was scarcely a quarter of a mile to the southward had
little more than five, and that immediately after six fathom we
had thirteen, and then twenty, as fast as the man could cast the
lead: from these circumstances I conjectured that the west side
of the shoal was steep. This shoal I called the Break Sea Spit,
because we had now smooth water, and to the southward of it we
had always a high sea from the S.E.</p>
<p>"Monday, 21st May, noon. Our latitude at this time was 24 deg.
28 min. S. For a few days past we had seen several of the sea
birds called boobies, not having met with any of them before;
last night a small flock of them passed the ship and went away to
the N.W., and in the morning from about half-an-hour before
sunrise, to half-an-hour after, flights of them were continually
corning from the N.N.W., and flying to the S.S.E., nor was one of
them seen to fly in any other direction: we therefore conjectured
that there was a lagoon, river, or inlet of shallow water in the
bottom of the deep bay to the southward of us, whither these
birds resorted to feed in the day, and that not far to the
northward there were some islands to which they repaired in the
night. To this bay I gave the name of Hervey's Bay, in honor of
Captain Hervey. In the afternoon, we stood in for the land,
steering S.W., with a gentle breeze at S.E., till 4 o'clock, when
being in latitude 24 deg. 36 min., about two leagues from the
shore, and having nine fathom water, we bore away along the coast
N.W. by N., and at the same time could see land extending to the
S.S.E. about eight leagues.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
While we were running along the shore, we shallowed our water
from nine to seven fathom, and at one time we had but six, which
determined us to anchor for the night.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 22nd May. At six in the morning we weighed, with a
gentle breeze from the southward, and steered N.W. ¼ W. edging in
for the land till we got within two miles of it, with water from
seven to eleven fathom; we then steered N.N.W., as the land lay,
and at noon our latitude was 24 deg. 19 min. We continued in the
same course, at the same distance, with from twelve to seven
fathom, till five in the evening, when we were abreast of the
south point of a large open bay, in which I intended to
anchor.</p>
<p>"Wednesday 23rd May. Early the next morning I went ashore with
a party of men, in order to examine the country, accompanied by
Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, and
Tupia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We landed a little within the south point of the bay, where we
found a channel leading into a large lagoon; this channel I
proceeded to examine and found three fathom till I got about a
mile up it, where I met with a shoal, upon which there was little
more than one fathom, but having passed over it, I had three
fathom again. The entrance of this channel lies close to the
south point of the bay, being formed by the shore on the east,
and on the west by a large spit of sand, it is about a quarter of
a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place there is room
for a few ships to lie in great security, and a small stream of
fresh water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was
prevented by shallows. We found several bogs and swamps of salt
water, upon which and by the sides of the lagoon, grows the true
mangrove, such as is found in the West Indies and the first of
the kind that we had met with. In the branches of these
mangroves, there were many nests of a remarkable kind of ant,
that was as green as grass: when the branches were disturbed they
came out in great numbers, and punished the offender by a much
sharper bite than ever we had felt from the same kind of animal
before. Upon these mangroves also we saw small green caterpillars
in great numbers. Their bodies were thick set with hairs, and
they were ranged upon the leaves side by side like a file of
soldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together. When we
touched them we found that the hair on their bodies had the
quality of a nettle, and gave us a more much acute though less
durable
pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Upon the shore we saw a species of the bustard, one of which we
shot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed seventeen pounds
and a half. We all agreed that this was the best bird we had
eaten since we left England, and in honour of it we called this
inlet Bustard Bay. It lies in latitude 24 deg. 4 min., longitude
208 deg. 18 min. The sea seemed to abound with fish, but
unhappily we tore our seine all to pieces at the first haul. Upon
the mud-banks, under the mangroves, we found innumerable oysters
of various kinds; among others the hammer oyster, and a large
proportion of small pearl oysters; if in deeper water there is
equal plenty of such oysters at their full growth, a pearl
fishery might certainly be established here to very great
advantage.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 24th May. At four in the morning we weighed, and
with a gentle breeze at south made sail out of the bay. In
standing out our soundings were from five to fifteen fathom, and
at daylight, when we were in the greatest depth and abreast of
the north head of the bay, we discovered breakers stretching out
from it N.N.E., between two or three miles, with a rock at the
outermost point of them just above the
water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Till five in the afternoon it was calm, but afterwards we steered
before the wind N.W. as the land lay till ten at night, and then
brought to, having had all along fourteen and fifteen fathom.</p>
<p>"Friday, 25th May. At five in the morning we made sail, and at
daylight the northernmost point of the main bore N. 70 W. Soon
after we saw more land, making like islands, and bearing N.W. by
N. At nine we were abreast of the point, at the distance of one
mile, with fourteen fathom water. This point I found to lie
directly under the Tropic of Capricorn, and for that reason I
called it Cape Capricorn. Its longitude is 208 deg. 58 min. W. It
is of considerable height, looks white and barren, and may be
known by some islands which lie at the N.W. of it, and some small
rocks at the distance of about a league S.E.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 27th May. At noon we were about two leagues distant
from the main, and by observation in latitude 22 deg. 53 min. S.
The northernmost point of land in sight now bore N.N.W., distant
ten miles. To this point I gave the name of Cape Manifold, from
the number of high hills which appeared over it. It lies in
latitude 22 deg. 43 min. S,, and distant about seventeen miles
from Cape Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between these
capes the shore forms a large bay, which I called Keppel Bay, and
I also distinguished the islands by the name of Keppel's
Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At three in the afternoon we passed Cape Manifold, from which the
land trends N.N.W. The land of the cape is high, rising in hills
directly from the sea, and may be known by three islands which
lie off it, one of them near the shore, and the other two eight
miles out at sea. One of these islands is low and flat, and the
other high and round.</p>
<p>"Monday, 28th May. At nine o'clock in the forenoon we were
abreast of the point, which I called Cape Townshend. It lies in
latitude 22 deg. 15 min., longitude 209 deg. 43 min. The land is
high and level, and rather naked than woody. Several islands lie
to the northward of it, at the distance of four or five miles out
at sea. Three or four leagues to the S.E. the shore forms a bay,
in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbour.
To the westward of the cape the land trends to S.W. ½ S., and
there form a very large bay, which turns to the eastward, and
probably communicates with the inlet, and makes the land of the
cape an island. As soon as we got round this cape we hauled our
wind to the westward, in order to get within the islands which
lie scattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to sea
as far as the eye could reach, even from the masthead. These
islands vary both in height and circuit from each other, so that,
although they are very numerous, no two of them are alike. We had
not stood long upon a wind before we came into shoal water, and
were obliged to tack at once to avoid it. Having sent a boat
ahead, I bore away W. by N., many small islands, rocks, and
shoals lying between us and the main, and many of a larger extent
without us. Our soundings until near noon were from fourteen to
seventeen fathom, when the boat made the signal for meeting with
shoal water. Upon this we hauled close upon a wind to the
eastward, but suddenly fell into three fathom and a quarter. We
immediately dropped an anchor, which brought the ship up with all
her sails standing. When the ship was brought up we had four
fathom, with a coarse sandy bottom, and found a strong tide
setting to the N.W. by W. ½ W., at the rate of nearly three miles
an hour, by which we were suddenly carried upon the shoal. Our
latitude, by observations, was 22 deg. 8 min. S. Cape Townshend
bore E. 16 S., distant thirteen miles, and the westernmost part
of the main in sight W. ¼ N. At this time a great number of
islands lay all around us.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon, having sounded round the ship, and found
that there was water sufficient to carry her over the shoal, we
weighed, and about three o'clock made sail and stood to the
westward, as the land lay, having sent a boat ahead to sound. At
six in the evening we anchored in ten fathom, with a sandy
bottom, at about two miles distant from the main; the westernmost
part of which bore W.N.W. and a great number of islands, lying a
long way without us, were still in sight.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 29th May, At five o'clock the next morning, I sent
away the master with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet
which bore from us west, at about the distance of a league, into
which I intended to go with the ship, that I might wait a few
days till the moon should increase, and in the meantime examine
the country. As soon as the ship could be got under sail, the
boats made the signal for anchorage; upon which we stood in, and
anchored in five fathom water, about a league within the entrance
of the inlet; which, as I observed a tide to flow and ebb
considerably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a
considerable distance. In this place I had thought of laying the
ship ashore, and cleaning her bottom; I therefore landed with the
master in search of a convenient place for that purpose, and was
accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We found walking here
excessively troublesome, for the ground was covered with a kind
of grass, the seeds of which were very sharp and bearded
backwards; so that whenever they stuck into our clothes, which
indeed was at every step, they worked forwards by means of the
beard, till they got at the flesh; and at the same time we were
surrounded by a cloud of mosquitos, which incessantly tormented
us with their stings. We soon met with several places where the
ship might conveniently be laid ashore; but to our great
disappointment we could find no fresh water. We proceeded,
however, up the country, where we found gum trees like those that
we had seen before, and observed that here, also, the gum was in
very small quantities. Upon the branches of these trees and some
others, we found ants' nests, made of clay, as big as a bushel,
something like those described in Sir Hans Sloan's 'Natural
History of Jamaica' (vol. 2, p. 221, tab. 258), but not so
smooth: the ants which inhabited these nests were small and thin
bodies&mdash;white. Hut upon another species of the tree we found
a small black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having
worked out the pith, occupied the pipe which had contained it:
yet the parts in which these insects had thus formed a lodgement,
and in which they swarmed in amazing numbers, bore leaves and
flowers, and appeared to be in as flourishing a state as those
that were sound. We found also an incredible number of
butterflies, so that for the space of three or four acres the air
was so crowded with ihem that millions were to be seen in every
direction, at the same time that every branch or twig was covered
with others that were not upon the wing. We found here also a
small fish of a singular kind: it was about the size of a minnow,
and had two very strong breast fins. We found it in places that
were quite dry, where we supposed it might have been left by the
tide; but it did not seem to have become languid for the want of
water, for upon our approach it leaped away, by help of the
breast fins, as nimbly as a frog; neither, indeed, did it seem to
prefer water to land, for when we found it in the water it
frequently leaped out and pursued its way upon dry ground. We
also observed that when it was in places where small stones were
standing above the surface of the water, at a little distance
from each other, it chose rather to leap from stone to stone than
to pass through the water, and we saw several of them pass
entirely over a puddle in this manner till they came to dry
ground, and then leap away. In the afternoon we renewed our
search after fresh water, but without success, and therefore I
determined to make my stay here but short. However. having
observed from an eminence that the inlet penetrated a
considerable way into the country, T determined to trace it in
the morning.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 30th May. At sunrise I went ashore, and, climbing
a considerable hill, I took a view of the coast and the islands
that lie off it, with their bearings, having an azimuth compass
with me for that purpose, but I observed that the needle differed
very considerably in its position, even to thirty
degrees&mdash;in some places more, in others less; and once I
found it differ from itself no less than two points in the
distance of fourteen feet. I took up some of the loose stones
that lay upon the ground and applied them to the needle, but they
produced no effect, and I therefore concluded that there was iron
ore in the hills, of which I had remarked other indications both
here and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my
observations upon the hill, I proceeded, with Dr. Solander, up
the inlet. I set out with the first of the flood, and long before
high water I had advanced above eight leagues. Its breadth thus
far was from two to five miles, upon a S.W. by S. direction; but
here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the
N.W. communicated with the sea, and I not only saw the sea in
this direction, but found the tide of flood coming strongly in
from that point. I also observed an arm of this lake extending to
the eastward, and it is not improbable that it may communicate
with the sea in the bottom of the bay which lies to the westward
of Cape
Townshend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The inlet in which the ship lay I called Thirsty Sound, because
it afforded us no fresh water. It lies in latitude 22 deg. 10
min. S., and longitude 210 deg. 18 min.
W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Over each of the points that form the entrance is a high round
hill, which, on the north-west, is a peninsula that at high water
is surrounded by the sea. They are bold to both the shores, and
the distance between them is about two miles. In this inlet is
good anchorage in seven, six, five and four fathoms; and places
very convenient for laying a ship down, where, at spring-tides,
the water does not rise less than sixteen or eighteen feet.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 31st May. At noon, the west point of Thirsty Sound,
which I have called Pier Head, bore S. 36 E., distant five
leagues. The east point of the other inlet which communicates
with the Sound bore S. by W., distant two leagues. Our latitude,
by observation, was 21 deg. 53 min.</p>
<p>"Friday, 1st June. The western inlet, which in the chart is
distinguished by the name of Broad Sound, we had now all open. At
the entrance it is at least nine or ten leagues wide. In it, and
before it, lie several islands and probably shoals also, for our
surroundings were very irregular, varying suddenly from ten to
four fathoms. At noon our latitude, by observation, was 21 deg.
29 min. S., a point of land which forms the north-west entrance
into Broad Sound, and which, I have named Cape Palmerston, lying
in latitude 21 deg. 30 min., longitude 210 deg. 54 min. W. by N.,
distant three leagues. Our latitude was 21 deg. 27 min., our
longitude 210 deg. 57 min. Between this cape and Cape Townshend
lies the bay which I have called the Bay of Inlets.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 2nd June. From what we had observed of the tide
during the night, it is plain that the flood came from the N.W.,
whereas the preceding day and several days before it came from
the S.E. Nor was this the first, or even the second time, that we
had remarked the same
thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four from
the islands without us. Our latitude, by observation, was 20 deg.
56 min., and a high promontory, which I named Cape Hillsborough,
bore W. ½ N., distant seven miles.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 3rd June. At eight o'clock in the morning we
discovered low land quite across what we took for an opening,
which proved to be a bay, five or six leagues deep. Upon this we
hauled our wind to the eastward, round the north point of the
bay, which at this time bore from us N.E. by N., distant four
leagues. From this point we found the land trend away N. by W. ½
W., and a strait or passage between it and a large island, or
islands, lying parallel to it. Having the tide of ebb in our
favour we stood for this passage, and at noon were just within
the entrance. Our latitude by observation was 20 deg. 26 min. S.
Cape Hillsborough bore S. by E., distant ten leagues, and the
north point of the bay S. 19 W., distant four miles. This point,
which I named Cape Conway, lies in latitude 20 deg. 36 min. S.,
longitude 211 deg. 28 min. W., and the bay which lies between
this cape and Cape Hillsborough I called Repulse
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Among the many islands that lie upon this coast, there is one
more remarkable than the rest; it is of a small circuit, very
high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape Conway, at
the south end of the passage. In the afternoon we steered through
this passage, which we found to be from three to seven miles
broad, and eight or nine miles in length, N. by W. ½ W,, S. by E.
½ E. It is formed by the main on the west, and by the islands on
the east, one of which is at least five leagues in length; our
depth of water in running through was from twenty to five and
twenty fathom, with good anchorage everywhere, and the whole
passage may be considered as one safe harbour, exclusive of the
small bays and coves which abound on each side, where ships may
lie as in a basin. The land both upon the main and islands is
high, and diversified by hill and valley, wood and lawn, with a
green and pleasant appearance. As this passage was discovered on
Whitsunday, I called it Whitsunday's Passage, and I called the
islands that form it, Cumberland Islands, in honour of his Royal
Highness the Duke. We kept under an easy sail, with the lead
going all night, being at the distance of three leagues from the
shore, and having from twenty-one to twenty-three fathom
water.</p>
<p>"Monday, 4th June. At daybreak we were abreast of the point.
which had been the farthest in sight to the north-west the
evening before. which I named Cape Gloucester. It is a lofty
promontory, in latitude 19 deg. 59 min. S., longitude 211 deg. 49
min. W., and may be known by an island which lies out at sea N.
by W. ½ W. at the distance of five or six leagues from it, and
which I called Holborne Island; there are also islands lying
under the land between Holborne Island and Whitsunday's Passage.
On the west side of Cape Gloucester the land trends away S.W. and
S.S.W., and forms a deep bay, the bottom I could but just see
from the mast-head; it is very low, and a continuation of the low
land which we had seen at the bottom of Repulse Bay. This Bay I
called Edgecumbe Bay, but without staying to look at it, we
continued our course to the westward, for the farthest land we
could see in that direction, which bore N. by W. ½ W., and
appeared very high. At six in the evening we were abreast of the
westernmost point just mentioned at about three miles distance,
and because it rises abruptly from the low lands which surround
it, I called it Cape Upstart. It lies in latitude 19 deg. 39 min.
S., longitude 212 deg. 32 min. W., fourteen leagues W.N.W. from
Cape Gloucester, and is of a height sufficient to be seen at the
distance of twelve leagues.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 6th June. We continued to steer N.N.W., as the
land lay, with twelve or fourteen fathom water, till noon on the
6th, when our latitude by observation was 19 deg. 1 min. S., and
we had the mouth of a bay all open, extending from S. ½ E. to
S.W. ½ S., distant two leagues. This bay, which I named Cleveland
Bay, appeared to be about five or six miles in extent every way;
the east point I named Cape Cleveland, and the west, which had
the appearance of an island, Magnetical Isle, as we perceived
that the compass did not traverse well when we were near it.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 7th June. We stood away N. by W. for the
northernmost land in sight, of which we were abreast Friday, 8th
June, at three o'clock in the morning, having passed all the
islands three or four hours before. This land, on account of its
figure, I named Point Hillock; it is of a considerable height,
and may be known by a round hillock, or rock, which joins to the
point, but appears to be detached from it. Between this Cape and
Magnetical Isle the shore forms a large bay, which I called
Halifax Bay. Before it lay the group of islands which has just
been mentioned, and some others at a less distance from the
shore. By these islands the bay is sheltered from all winds, and
it affords good anchorage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having passed Point Hillock, we continued standing to the N.N.W.
as the land trended, having the advantage of a light moon. At six
we were abreast of a point of land which lies N. by W. ½ W.,
distant eleven miles from Point Hillock, which I named Cape
Sandwich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
From Cape Sandwich the land trends west, and afterwards north,
forming a fine large bay, which I called Rockingham
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon our latitude, by observation, was 17 deg. 59 min., and we
were abreast of the north point of Rockingham Bay, which bore
from us west at the distance of about two miles. This boundary of
the bay is formed by an island of considerable height, which in
the chart is distinguished by the name of Dunk Isle, and which
lies so near the shore as not to be easily distinguished from it.
Our longitude was 213 deg. 57 min. W. Cape Sandwich bore S. by E.
½ E., distant nineteen miles, and the northernmost land in sight
N. ½ W. Our depth of water for the last ten hours had not been
more than sixteen, nor less than seven fathom.</p>
<p>"Saturday, June 9. At six o'clock in the morning, we were
abreast of some small islands, which we called Frankland's
Isles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The most distant point in sight to the northward bore N. by W.
half W., and we thought it was part of the main, but afterwards
found it to be an island of considerable height, and about four
miles in circuit. Between this island and a point on the main,
from which it is distant about two miles, I passed with the
ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The point on the main, of which we were now abreast, I called
Cape Grafton: its latitude is sixteen degrees fifty-seven minutes
south, and longitude two hundred and fourteen degrees six minutes
west.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Having hauled round Cape Grafton, we found the land trend away
N.W. by W., and three miles to the westward of the Cape we found
a bay, in which we anchored, about two miles from the shore in
four fathom water, with an ouzey bottom. The east point of the
bay bore S. 74 E., the west point S. 83 W., and a low, green,
woody island, which lies in the offing N. 35 E. This island.
which lies N. by E. ½ E., distant three or four leagues from
Cape. Grafton, is called in the chart Green Island.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 10th June. At four in the morning the breeze
freshened at S. by E., and the weather became fair. We continued
steering N.N.W. ½ W. as the land lay, at about three leagues
distance, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom water. At ten we
hauled off north, in order to get without a small, low island
which lay at about two leagues distance from the main, and great
part of which at this time, it being high-water, was overflowed.
About three leagues to the north-west of this island, close under
the main land, is another island, the land of which rises to a
greater height, and which at noon bore from us N. 55 W., distant
seven or eight miles. At this time our latitude was 16 deg. 20
min. S. Cape Grafton bore S. 29 E., distant forty miles, and the
northernmost point of land in sight N. 20 W.; our depth of water
was fifteen fathom. Between this point and Cape Grafton the shore
forms a large but not a very deep bay, which, being discovered on
Trinity Sunday, I called Trinity Bay.</p>
<p>"Hitherto we had safely navigated this dangerous coast, where
the sea in all parts conceals shoals which suddenly project from
the shore, and rocks that rise abruptly, like a pyramid, from the
bottom, for an extent of two-and-twenty degrees of
latitude&mdash;more than one thousand three hundred
miles&mdash;and, therefore, hitherto none of the names which
distinguish the several parts of the country that we saw are
memorials of distress; but here we became acquainted with
misfortune, and we therefore called the point which we had just
seen farthest to the northward Cape Tribulation. This cape lies
in 16 deg. 6 min. S., and longitude 214 deg. 39 min. W. We
steered along the shore N. by W. at the distance of between three
and four leagues, having from fourteen to twelve and ten fathom
water. In the offing we saw two islands, which lie in latitude 16
deg. S., and about six or seven leagues from the main. At six in
the evening the northernmost land in sight bore N. by W. ½ W,,
and two low, woody islands, which some of us took to be rocks
above water, bore N. ½ W. At this time we shortened sail, and
hauled off shore E.N.E. and N.E. by E., close upon a wind, for it
was my design to stretch out all night, as well to avoid the
danger we saw ahead as to see whether any island lay in the
offing, especially as we were now near the latitude assigned to
the islands discovered by Quiros, and which some geographers, for
what reasons I know not, have thought fit to join to this land.
We had the advantage of a fine breeze and a clear moonlight
night, and in standing off from six till near nine o'clock we
deepened our water from fourteen to twenty-one fathom, but while
we were at supper it suddenly shoaled, and we fell into twelve,
ten, and eight fathom within the space of a few minutes. I
immediately ordered everybody to their station, and all was ready
to put about and come to an anchor, but meeting at the next cast
of the lead with deep water again, we concluded that we had gone
over the tail of the shoal which we had seen at sunset, and that
all danger was past. Before ten we had twenty-and-one and twenty
fathom, and this depth continuing the gentlemen left the deck in
great tranquillity and went to bed; but a few minutes before
eleven the water shallowed at once from twenty to seventeen
fathom, and before the lead could be cast again the ship struck
and became immoveable, except by the heaving of the surge that
beat against the craggs of the rock upon which she
lay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We had too much reason to conclude that we were upon a rock of
coral, which is more fatal than any other, because the points of
it are sharp, and every part of the surface so rough as to grind
away whatever is rubbed against it, even with the gentlest
motion.</p>
<p>"Monday, 11th June. Day broke upon us, and we saw the land at
about eight leagues distance, without any island in the
intermediate
space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The wind gradually died away, and early in the forenoon it was a
dead calm. If it had blown hard the ship must inevitably have
been destroyed. At eleven in the forenoon we expected high water,
and anchors were got out, and everything made ready for another
effort to heave her off if she should float, but to our
inexpressible surprise and concern, she did not float by a foot
and a half, though we had lightened her near fifty ton, so much
did the day tide fall short of that in the night. We now
proceeded to lighten her still more, and threw overboard
everything that it was possible for us to spare. Hitherto she had
not admitted much water, but as the tide fell it rushed in so
fast that two pumps, incessantly worked, could scarcely keep her
free. At two o'clock she lay heeling two or three streaks to
starboard, and the pinnace, which lay under her bows, touched the
ground. We had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to
prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the
starboard quarter, and the other right astern, got the blocks and
tackle which were to give us a purchase upon the cables in order,
and brought the falls, or ends, of them in abaft, straining them
tight, that the next effort might operate upon the ship, and by
shortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors,
draw her off the ledge upon which she rested, towards the deep
water. About five o'clock in the afternoon we observed the tide
begin to rise, but we observed at the same time that the leak
increased to an almost alarming degree, so that two more pumps
were manned, but, unhappily, only one of them would work. Three
of the pumps, however, were kept going, and at nine o'clock the
ship righted, but the leak had gained upon us so considerably
that it was imagined she must go to the bottom as soon as she
ceased to be supported by the rock. This was a dreadful
circumstance, so that we anticipated the floating of the ship not
as an earnest of deliverance, but as an event that would probably
precipitate our
destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
To those only who have waited in a state of such suspense death
has approached in all its terrors. And as the dreadful moment
that was to determine our fate came on, every one saw his own
sensations pictured in the countenances of his companions.
However, the capstan and windlass were manned with as many hands
as could be spared from the pumps, and, the ship floating about
twenty minutes after ten o'clock, the effort was made, and she
was heaved into deep water. It was some comfort to find that she
did not now admit more water than she had done upon the rock; and
though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no
less than three feet nine inches of water in the hold, yet the
men did not relinquish their labour, and we held the water, as it
were, at bay
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
till an accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at
once. The planking which lines the inside of the ship's bottom is
called the ceiling, and between this and the outside planking
there is a space of about eighteen inches. The man who till this
time had attended the well to take the depth of water, had taken
it only to the ceiling, and gave the measure accordingly; but he
being now relieved, the person who came in his stead reckoned the
depth to the outside planking, by which it appeared in a few
minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches, the
difference between the planking without and within. Upon this,
even the bravest was upon the point of giving up his labour with
his hope, and in a few minutes everything would have been
involved in all the confusion of despair. But this accident,
however dreadful in its first consequences, was eventually the
cause of our preservation. The mistake was soon detected, and the
sudden joy which every man felt upon finding his situation better
than his fears had suggested, operated like a charm, and seemed
to possess him with a strong belief that scarcely any real danger
remained. New confidence and new hope, however founded, inspired
new vigour, and though our state was the same as when the men
first began to slacken in their labour, through weariness and
despondency, they now renewed their efforts with such alacrity
and spirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak was
so far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had
gained considerably upon the
leak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It was, however, impossible long to continue the labour by which
the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact
situation of it could not be discovered, we had no hope of
stopping it within.</p>
<p>"In this situation Mr. Monkhouse, one of my midshipmen, came
to me and proposed an expedient that he had once seen used on
board a merchant ship, which sprung a leak that admitted above
four feet of water an hour, and which by this expedient was
brought safely from Virginia to London; the master having such
confidence in it, that he took her out of harbour, knowing her
condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak
could be otherwise stopped. To this man, therefore, the care of
the expedient, which is called fothering the ship, was
immediately committed, four or five of the people being appointed
to assist
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
When the sail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the ship's
bottom by ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came under
the leak the suction which carried in the water carried in with
it the oakum and wool from the surface of the sail, which in
other parts the water was not sufficiently agitated to wash off.
By the success of this expedient our leak was so far reduced,
that instead of gaining upon three pumps, it was easily kept
under with one. Upon this occasion I must observe, both in
justice and gratitude to the ship's company and the gentlemen on
board, that although in the midst of our distress every one
seemed to have a just sense of his danger, yet no passionate
exclamations, or frantic gestures were to be heard, or seen;
every one appeared to have the perfect possession of his mind,
and every one exerted himself to the uttermost, with a quiet and
patient perseverance, equally distant from the tumultuous
violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of
despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
While we lay at anchor for the night; we found that the ship made
about fifteen inches of water an hour, from which no immediate
danger was apprehended, and at six in the
morning&mdash;Wednesday, 13th June&mdash;we weighed and stood to
the N.W. still edging in for the land with a gentler breeze at
S.S.E. At nine we passed close without two small islands that lie
in latitude 15 deg. 41 min. S., and about four leagues from the
main: to reach these islands had, in the height of our distress,
been the object of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wishes, and
therefore I called them Hope Islands. At noon we were about three
leagues from the land, and in latitude 15 deg. 37 min. S.; the
northernmost part of the main in sight bore N. 30 W.; and Hope
Islands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40
E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The pinnace was still out with one of the mates; but at nine
o'clock she returned, and reported that about two leagues to
leeward she had discovered just such a harbour as we wanted, in
which there was a sufficient rise of water, and every other
convenience that could be desired, either for laying the ship
ashore or heaving her down. In consequence of this information I
weighed at six o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 14th June. Having sent two boats ahead to lie upon
the shoals that we saw in our way, we ran down to the place; but
notwithstanding our precaution, we were once in three fathom
water. As soon as these shoals were passed, I sent the boats to
lie in the channel that led to the harbour, for by this time it
began to blow. It was happy for us that a place of refuge was at
hand,
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I therefore anchored in four fathom, about a mile from the shore,
and then made the signal for the boats to come on board. When
this was done I went myself and buoyed the channel, which I found
very narrow; the harbour also I found smaller than I expected,
but most excellently adapted to our purpose; and it is
remarkable, that in the whole course of our voyage we had seen no
place which, in our present circumstances, could have afforded us
the same relief. At noon our latitude was 15 deg. 26 min. S.
During all the rest of this day, and the whole night, it blew too
fresh for us to venture from our anchor and run into the
harbour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The gale continuing, we kept our station all the
15th&mdash;Friday. On the 16th&mdash;Saturday&mdash;it was
somewhat more moderate; and about six o'clock in the morning, we
hove the cable short, with a design to get under sail, but we
were obliged to desist, and veer it out again. It is remarkable
that the sea breeze which blew fresh when we anchored, continued
to do so almost every day while we stayed here; it was calm only
while we were upon the rock, except once, and even the gale that
afterwards wafted us ashore, would then certainly have beaten us
to pieces. The scurvy now began to make its appearance among us,
with many formidable symptoms.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 17th June. In the morning of the 17th, though the
wind was still fresh, we ventured to weigh, and push in for the
harbour; but in doing this we twice ran the ship aground, the
first time she went off without any trouble, but the second time
she stuck
fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The tide was happily rising, and about one o'clock in the
afternoon, she floated. We soon warped her into harbour, and
having moored her alongside of a steep beach to the south, we got
the anchors, cables, and all the hawsers on shore before
night.</p>
<p>"Monday, 18th June. In the morning of Monday the 18th, a stage
was made from the ship to the shore, which was so bold that she
floated at twenty feet distance, two tents were also set up, one
for the sick and the other for store and provisions, which were
landed in the course of the day
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In the mean time, I climbed one of the highest hills among those
that overlooked the harbour, which afforded by no means a
comfortable prospect; the low land near the river is wholly
overrun with mangroves, among which the salt water flows every
tide, and the high land appeared to be everywhere stoney and
barren.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 19th June. This day Mr. Banks crossed the river to
take a view of the country on the other side: he found it consist
principally of sand hills, where he saw some Indian houses, which
appeared to have been very lately inhabited. In his walk he met
with vast flocks of pigeons and crows, of the pigeons, which were
exceedingly beautiful, he shot several; but the crows, which were
exactly like those in England, were so shy that he could not get
within reach of them.</p>
<p>"Wednesday 20th June. This evening, Mr. Banks observed that in
many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice
stones, which lay at a considerable distance above high water
mark.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 21st June. The next morning we went early to work,
and by four o'clock in the afternoon had got out all the coals,
cast the moorings loose, and warped the ship a little, higher up
the harbour to a place which I thought most convenient for laying
her ashore in order to stop the leak.</p>
<p>"Friday, 22nd June. At two o'clock in the morning of the 22nd,
the tide left her, and gave us an opportunity to examine the
leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a little before
the starboard fore chains. In this place the rocks had made their
way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more
planks were very much damaged, and the appearance of these
breaches was very extraordinary, there was not a splinter to be
seen, but all was smooth as if the whole had been cut away by an
instrument. The timbers in this place were very close, and if
they had not been, it would have been absolutely impossible to
save the ship. But after all, her preservation depended upon a
circumstance still more remarkable, one of the holes, which was
big enough to have sunk us, if we had had eight pumps instead of
four, and been able to keep them incessantly going, was in great
measure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which after having
made the wound, was left sticking in
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In the meantime, some of the people were sent on the other side
of the water to shoot pigeons for the sick, who at their return
reported that they had seen an animal as large as a greyhound of
a slender make, a mouse colour, and extremely swift: they
discovered also many Indian houses, and a fine stream of fresh
water.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 23rd June. This day nearly everybody had seen the
animal which the pigeon-shooters had brought an account of the
day before; and one of the seamen, who had been rambling in the
woods, told us at his return, that he verily believed he had seen
the devil: we naturally enquired in what form he had appeared,
and his answer was in so singular a style, that I shall set down
his own words. 'He was' says John, 'as large as a one-gallon keg,
and very like it; he had horns and wings, and yet he crept so
slowly through the grass that if I hadn't been afeared, I might
have touched him.' This formidable apparition we afterwards
discovered to have been a bat: and the bats here must be
acknowledged to have a frightful appearance, for they are nearly
black and full as large as a partridge; they have no horns, but
the fancy of a man who thought he saw the devil might easily
supply that defect.'</p>
<p>"Sunday, 24th June. Early on the 24th the carpenters began to
repair the sheathing on the larboard bow, where we found two
planks cut about half through; and in the meantime I sent a party
of men under the direction of Mr. Gore, in search of refreshments
for the sick; this party returned about noon with a few palm
cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild plantains. The plantains
were the smallest I had ever seen, and the pulp, though it was
well tasted, was full of small stones. As I was walking this
morning at a little distance from the ship, I saw myself one of
the animals which had been so often described; it was of a light
mouse colour, and in size and shape very much resembling a
greyhound. It had a long tail also, which it carried like a
greyhound, and I should have taken it for a wild dog, if, instead
of running, it had not leapt like a hare or deer; its legs were
said to be very slender, and the print of its foot to be like
that of a goat, but when I saw it the grass was so high that the
legs were concealed, and the ground was too hard to receive the
track. Mr. Banks also had an imperfect view of this animal, and
was of opinion that its species was hitherto unknown.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 26th June. This day, some of our gentlemen, who had
made an excursion into the woods, brought home the leaves of a
plant. which was thought to be the same that in the West Indies
is called <em>cocos</em>, but upon trial the roots proved too
acrid to be eaten; the leaves, however, were little inferior to
spinnage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Another fruit was also found about the size of a small golden
pippin, but flatter, and of a deep purple colour; when first
gathered from the tree it was very hard and disagreable, but
after being kept a few days became soft, and tasted very much
like an indifferent damasene.</p>
<p>"Friday, 29th June. At two o'clock in the morning of the 29th,
I observed, in conjunction with Mr. Green, an emersion of
Jupiter's first satellite; the time here was 2 hrs. 18 min. 53
sec., which gave the longitude of this place 214 deg. 42 min. 30
sec. W.; its latitude is 15 deg. 26 min.
S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
One of my midshipmen, an American, who was this day abroad with
his gun, reported that he had seen a wolf exactly like those
which he had been used to see in his own country.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 1st July. This day the thermometer in the shade rose
to 87°, which was higher than it had been on any day since we
came upon this coast.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 3rd July. The master returned, and reported that he
had found a passage out to sea between the shoals, and described
its situation. The shoals, he said, consisted of coral rocks,
many of which were dry at low water, and upon one of which he had
been ashore. He found here some cockles of so enormous a size
that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great
variety of other shell fish, of which he brought us a plentiful
supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This day an alligator was seen to swim about the ship for some
time.</p>
<p>"Friday, 6th July. Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore and three
men, set out in a small boat up the river, with a view to spend
two or three days in an excursion, to examine the country, and
kill some of the animals which had been so often seen at a
distance.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 8th July. About four o'clock in the afternoon Mr.
Banks and his party returned and gave us an account of their
expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues among swamps and
mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to
differ but little from what they had seen before. They pursued
their course, therefore, up the river, which at length was
contracted into a narrow channel, and was bounded not by swamps
and mangroves but by steep banks that were covered with trees of
a most beautiful verdure, among which was that which in the West
Indies is called Mohoe, or the bark tree (the <i>hibiscus
tiliaceus</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
With the first dawn they set out in search of game, and in a walk
of many miles they saw four animals of the same kind, two of
which Mr. Banks' greyhound fairly chased, but they threw him out
at a great distance by leaping over the long grass, which
prevented his running. This animal was observed not to run upon
four legs, but to bound or hop forward upon two, like the Jerbua,
or <i>Mus jaculus</i>.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Soon after the arrival of this party the master also returned,
having been seven leagues out to sea, and he was of opinion that
there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a
passage. His expedition was, however, by no means without its
advantages, for having been a second time upon the rock where he
had seen the large cockles, he had met with a great number of
turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed seven
hundred and ninety-one pounds, though he had no better instrument
than a boat-hook.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 11th July. We had another visit from four of the
natives; three of them had been with us before, but the fourth
was a stranger, whose name, as we learnt from his companions who
introduced him, was Yaparico.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 12th July. One of these strangers had a necklace of
shells, very prettily made, and a bracelet upon his arm formed of
several strings, so as to resemble what in England is called
gymp: both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead,
and were disfigured by the bone in the nose.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 14th July. The next morning two of the Indians came
on board, but after a short stay, went along the shore, and
employed themselves with great diligence in sticking fish. Mr.
Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good fortune to
kill one of the animals which had been so much the subject of our
speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This individual was a young one, much under its full growth,
weighing only thirty-eight pounds. The head, neck, and shoulders
are very small in proportion to the other parts of the body; the
tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and
tapering towards the end; the forelegs of this individual were
only eight inches long, and the hind legs two and twenty; its
progress is by successive leaps or hops of a great length, in an
erect posture; the fore-legs are kept close to the breast, and
seem to be of use only for digging; the skin is covered with a
short fur of a dark mouse or grey colour, excepting the head and
ears, which bear a slight resemblance to those of a hare. This
animal is called by the natives <i>Kanguroo</i>.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 15th July. The next day our kanguroo was dressed for
dinner, and proved most excellent meat; we might now be said to
fare sumptuously every day for we had turtle in great plenty, and
we all agreed that they were much better than any we had tasted
in England, which we imputed to their being eaten fresh from the
sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Most of those that we caught here were of the kind called green
turtle, and weighed from two to three hundred weight, and when
these were killed they were always found to be full of turtle
grass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Two of them were loggerheads, the flesh of which was much less
delicious, and in their stomachs nothing was to be found but
shells.</p>
<p>"Monday, 16th July. This evening we observed an emersion of
Jupiter's first satellite, which gave 215 deg. 55 min. 47 sec. of
longitude. The observation which was made on the 29th June, gave
214 deg. 42 min. 39 sec; the mean is 214 deg. 48 min. 7½ sec.,
the longitude of this place west of Greenwich.</p>
<p>"Friday, 20th July. At low water I went and sounded and buoyed
the bar, the ship being now ready for sea. We saw no Indians this
day, but all the hills round us for many miles were on fire,
which at night made a most striking and beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 22nd July. We killed a turtle for the day's
provision, upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon, or
turtle peg, about as thick as a man's finger, near fifteen inches
long, and bearded at the end, such as we had seen among the
natives, sticking through both shoulders. It appeared to have
been stuck a long time, for the wound had perfectly healed up
over the weapon.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 26th July. As Mr. Banks was again gleaning the
country for his natural history, he had the good fortune to take
an animal of the opossum tribe. It was found much to resemble the
remarkable animal of the kind, which M. de Buffon has described
in his natural history by the name of phalanga, but it was not
the same.</p>
<p>"Friday, 3rd August&mdash;Saturday, 4th. At six o'clock in the
morning of Friday, the 3rd, we made another unsuccessful attempt
to warp the ship out of the harbour, but at five o'clock in the
morning of the 4th our efforts succeeded, and about seven we got
once more under sail, with a light air from the land, which soon
died away, and was followed by the sea breezes from S.E. by S.,
with which we stood off to sea E. by N., having the pinnace
ahead, which was ordered to keep sounding continually.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
When we were at anchor the harbour from which we sailed bore S.
70 W., distant about five leagues. The northernmost point of the
main in sight, which I named Cape Bedford, and which lies in
latitude 15 deg. 16 min. S., longitude 214 deg. 45 min. W., bore
N. 20 deg. W., distant three leagues and a half.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 4th August. To the harbour we had now left I gave
the name of Endeavour river. It is only a small bar harbour, or
creek, which runs in a winding channel three or four leagues
inland, and at the head of which there is a small brook of fresh
water. There is not depth of water for the shipping above a mile
within the bar, and at this distance only on the north side,
where the bank is so steep for near a quarter of a mile that a
ship may lie afloat at low water, so near the shore as to reach
it with a stage, and the situation is extremely convenient for
heaving down; but at low water, the depth upon the bar is not
more than nine or ten feet, nor more than seventeen or eighteen
at the height of the tide, the difference between high and low
water at spring tides being about nine feet. At the new and full
of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it
must also be remembered, that this part of the coast is so
barricaded with shoals, as to make the harbour still more
difficult of access; the safest approach is from the southward,
keeping the main land close upon the board all the way. Its
situation may always be found by the latitude which has been very
accurately laid down. Over the south point is some high land, but
the north point is formed by a low sandy beach, which extends
about three miles to the northward, where the land begins again
to be high.</p>
<p>"August, Wednesday, 8th. The gale continued with but little
remission.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 9th. We rode till seven o'clock on the morning of
Friday the 10th, when, it being more moderate, we weighed and
stood in for the land, having at length determined to seek a
passage along the shore to the northward, still keeping the boats
ahead: during our run in we had from nineteen to twelve fathom:
after standing in about an hour, we edged away for three small
islands that lay N.N.E. ½ E., three leagues from Cape
Bedford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
our latitude by observation was 14 deg. 51 min. We now thought we
saw a clear opening before us, and hojicd that we were once more
out of danger; in this hope, however, we soon found ourselves
disappointed, and for that reason I called the headland Cape
Flattery. It lies in latitude 14 deg. 56 min. S., longitude 214
deg. 43 min. W., and is a lofty promontory, making next the sea
in two hills, which have a third behind them, with low sandy
ground on each
side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We steered along the shore N.W. by W. till one o'clock, for what
we thought the open channel, when the petty officer at the
mast-head cried out that he saw land ahead, extending quite round
to the islands that lay without us, and a large reef between us
and
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In this dilemma we hauled upon a wind in for the land
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. and soon after we came loan anchor
under a point of the main, in somewhat less than five fathom, and
at about the distance of a mile from the shore. Cape Flattery now
bore S.E., distant three leagues and a half. As soon as the ship
was at anchor I went ashore upon the point, which is high, and
afforded me a good view of the
sea-coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Except the point I was now upon, which I called Point Look-out,
and Cape Flattery, the mainland to the northward of Cape Bedford
is low, and chequered with white sand and green bushes, for ten
or twelve miles inland, beyond which it rises to a considerable
height. To the northward of Point Look-out the coast appeared to
be shoal and flat for a considerable distance, which did not
encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with
the land would continue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and
consisted of the finest white sand we had ever seen, we
discovered the footsteps of
people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In the evening I returned to the ship, and resolved the next
morning to visit one of the high islands in the offing, from the
top of which, as they lay five leagues out at sea, I hoped to
discover more distinctly the situation of the shoals, and the
channel between them.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 11th August. In the morning, therefore, of the
11th, I set out in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, whose
fortitude and curiosity made him a party in every
expedition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
About one o'clock we reached the island, and immediately ascended
the highest hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned
to the importance of our business and the uncertainty of the
event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I continued upon this hill till sunset, but the weather was so
hazy during the whole time that I came down much
disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I determined to stay upon the island all night
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
and at three in the
morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 12th August. I climbed the hill a second time, but,
to my great disappointment, found the weather much more hazy than
it had been the day
before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We found the island, which is visible at twelve leagues distance,
to be about eight leagues in circumference, and in general very
rocky and
barren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We found also fresh water in two places; one was a running
stream, but that was a little brackish when I tasted it, which
was close to the sea; the other was a standing pool close behind
the sandy beach, and this was perfectly sweet and good.
Notwithstanding the distance of this island from the main, we
saw, to our great surprise, that it was sometimes visited by the
natives.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We observed that all these huts were built upon eminences, and
entirely exposed to the S.E., contrary to those which we had seen
upon the
main.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
From these huts and their situation we concluded that at some
seasons of the year the weather here is invariably calm and fine,
for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the sea to so
great a distance in such weather as we had from the time of our
first coming upon the coast. As we saw no animals upon this place
but lizards, I called it Lizard
Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At two in the afternoon, there being no hope of clear weather, we
set out from Lizard Island to return to the ship, and in our way
landed upon the low, sandy island with trees upon it which we had
remarked on our going out. Upon this island we saw an incredible
number of birds, chiefly sea-fowl; we found also the nest of an
eagle with young ones, which we killed, and the nest of some
other bird, we knew not what, of a most enormous size; it was
built with sticks upon the ground, and was no less than six and
twenty feet in circumference and two feet eight inches
high.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
To this spot we gave the name of Eagle
Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It was unanimously agreed that the best thing we could do would
be to quit the coast altogether till we could approach it with
less danger.</p>
<p>"Monday, 13th August. In the morning, therefore, at break of
day, we got under sail, and stood out N.E. for the north-west end
of Lizard Island, leaving Eagle Island to
windward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon the north-west end of Lizard Island bore E.S.E., distant
one mile; our latitude by observation was 14 deg. 38
min.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We had a strong gale from S.E., and by two o'clock we just
fetched to windward of one of the channels or openings in the
outer reef which I had seen from the island. We now tacked and
made a short trip to the S.W., while the master in the pinnace
examined the channel. He soon made the signal for the ship to
follow, and in a short time she got safe out. As soon as we had
got without the breakers, we had no ground with one hundred and
fifty fathom, and found a large sea rolling in from the S.E., a
certain sign that neither lands nor shoals were near us in that
direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our change of situation was now visible in every countenance, for
it was most sensibly felt in every breast. We had been little
less than three months entangled among shoals and rocks that
every moment threatened us with destruction, frequently passing
our nights at anchor within hearing of the surge that broke over
them, sometimes driving towards them even while our anchors were
out, and knowing that if by any accident, to which an almost
continued tempest exposed us, they should not hold, we must in a
few minutes inevitably perish. But now, after having sailed no
less than three hundred and sixty leagues, without once having a
man out of the chains heaving the lead even for a minute, which,
perhaps, never happened to any other vessel, we found ourselves
in an open sea with deep
water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The passage or channel through which we passed into the open sea
beyond the reef lies in latitude 14 deg. 32 min. S., and may
always be known by the three islands within it, which I have
called the Islands of Direction, because by these a stranger may
find a safe passage through the reef quite to the main. The
channel lies from Lizard Island N.E. ½ N., distant three leagues,
and is about one-third of a mile broad and not more in length.
Lizard Island, which is, as I have before observed, the largest
and the northernmost of the three, affords safe anchorage under
the north-west side, fresh water and wood for fuel. The low
islands and shoals also which lie between it and the main channel
with turtle and fish, which may probably be caught in all seasons
of the year, except when the weather is very tempestuous: so that
all things considered, there is not, perhaps, a better place for
ships to refresh at upon the whole coast than this island.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 14th August. In the morning, at daybreak, Lizard
Island bore S. 15 E., distant ten leagues, and we then made sail
and stood away N.N.W. ½
W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At six in the evening we shortened sail, and brought the ship to,
with her head to the N.E.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 15th August. At six in the morning made sail and
steered west, in order to get within sight of the land, that I
might be sure not to overshoot the passage, if a passage there
was, between this land and New Guinea. At noon our latitude by
observation was 13 deg. 2 min. S., longitude 216 deg.
W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We had sounded several times during the night, but had no bottom
with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had we any ground now
with the same length of line.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 16th August. Yet, about four in the morning, we
plainly heard the roaring of the surf, and at break of day saw it
foaming to a vast height, at not more than a mile's distance. Our
distress now returned upon us with double force; the waves which
rolled in upon the reef carried us towards it very fast; we could
reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind for
the sails. In this dreadful situation no resource was left us but
the boats, and to aggravate our misfortune, the pinnace was under
repair; the long-boat and yawl, however, were put into the water,
and sent ahead to tow, which, by the help of our sweeps abaft,
got the ship's head round to the northward, which, if it could
not prevent our destruction, might, at least, delay it. But it
was six o'clock before this was effected, and we were not then a
hundred yards from the rock upon which the same billow which
washed the side of the ship broke to a tremendous height the very
next time it rose; so that between us and destruction there was
only a dreary valley, no wider than the base of one wave, and
even now the sea under us was unfathomable&mdash;at least no
bottom was to be found with one hundred and twenty fathom. During
this scene of distress the carpenter had found means to patch up
the pinnace: so that she was hoisted out, and sent ahead in aid
of the other boats to tow. But all our efforts would have been
ineffectual if, just at this crisis of our fate, a light air of
wind had not sprung up&mdash;so light that at any other time we
would not have observed it, but which was enough to turn the
scale in our favour, and, in conjunction with the assistance
afforded us by the boats, to give the ship a perceptible motion
obliquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived, but in less than
ten minutes it was again a dead calm, and the ship was again
driven towards the breakers, which were not now more than two
hundred yards distant.</p>
<p>"The same light breeze, however, returned before we had lost
all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and lasted about ten
minutes more. During this time we discovered a small opening in
the reef at about the distance of a quarter of a mile: I
immediately sent one of the mates to examine it, who reported
that its breadth was not more than the length of the ship, but
that within it there was smooth water; this discovery seemed to
render our escape possible, and that was all, by pushing the ship
through the opening, which was immediately attempted. It was
uncertain, indeed, whether we could reach it, but if we should
succeed thus far we made no doubt of being able to get through;
in this, however we were disappointed, for having reached it by
the joint assistance of our boats and the breeze, we found that
in the meantime it had become high water, and to our great
surprise we met the tide of ebb rushing out of it like a mill
stream. We gained, however, some advantage, though in a manner
directly contrary to our expectations; we found it impossible to
go through the opening, but the stream that prevented us carried
us out about a quarter of a mile: it was too narrow for us in it
longer; yet this tide of ebb so much assisted the boats that by
noon we had got an offing of near two miles. We had, however,
reason to despair of deliverance even if the breeze, which had
now died away, should revive, for we were still embayed in the
reef, if the tide of ebb being spent, the tide of flood,
notwithstanding our utmost efforts, would again drive the ship
into the bight. About this time, however, we saw another opening,
near a mile to the westward, which I immediately sent the first
lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the small boat to examine; in the
meantime we struggled hard with the flood, sometimes gaining a
little, and sometimes losing; but every man still did his duty
with as much calmness and regularity as if no danger were near.
About two o'clock, Mr. Hicks returned with an account that the
opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be passed:
the possibility of passing it was sufficient encouragement to
make the attempt, for all danger was less imminent than that of
our present situation. A light breeze sprung up at E.N.E., with
which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of flood that
without an opening would have been our destruction, we entered
it, and hurried through with amazing rapidity, by a torrent that
kept us from driving against either side of the channel, which
was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. While we were
shooting this gulph, our soundings were from thirty to seven
fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul.</p>
<p>"As soon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nineteen
fathom, over a bottom of coral and
shells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now
greatly increased by our having a crazy ship, and being short of
provisions and every other necessary: yet the distinction of
first discoverers made us cheerfully encounter every danger, and
submit to every
inconvenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Having now congratulated ourselves upon getting within the reef,
notwithstanding we had so lately congratulated ourselves upon
getting without it, I resolved to keep the main land on board in
my future route to the northward, whatever the consequence might
be; for if we had now gone without the reef again, it might have
carried us so far from the coast as to prevent my being able to
determine whether this country did, or did not, join to New
Guinea; a question which I was determined to resolve from my
first coming within sight of land. However, as I had experienced
the disadvantage of having a boat under repair, at a time when it
was possible I might want to use her, I determined to remain fast
at anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly refitted. As I had no
employment for the other boats, I sent them out.</p>
<p>"Friday, 17th August. In the morning to the reef to see what
refreshments could be procured. In this situation I found the
variation by amplitude and azimuth to be 4 deg. 9 min. E., and at
noon our latitude, by observation, was 12 deg. 38 min. S., and
our longitude 216 deg. 45 min. W. The mainland extended from N.
66 W. to S.W. by S., and the nearest part of it was distant about
nine leagues. The opening through which we had passed I called
Providential Channel, and this bore E.N.E, distant ten or twelve
miles. On the mainland within us was a lofty promontory which I
called Cape Weymouth, on the north side of which is a bay, which
I called Weymouth Bay. They lie in latitude 12 deg. 42 min. S.;
longitude, 217 deg. 15 min. W. At four o'clock in the afternoon
the boats returned with about two hundred and forty pounds of the
meat of shell-fish, chiefly of cockles, some of which were as
much as two men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good
meat.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 18th August. At six o'clock in the morning we got
under sail and stood away to the N.W., having two boats ahead 10
direct
us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon our latitude was 12 deg. 28 min., and our distance from
the main about four leagues: it extended from S. by W. to N. 71
W., and some small islands from N. 40 W. to 54
W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At half-an-hour after six we anchored in thirteen fathom. The
northernmost of the small islands seen at noon bore W. ½ S.,
distant three miles. These islands are distinguished in the chart
by the name of Forbes Islands, and lie about five leagues from
the main, which here forms a high point that we called Bolt
Head.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 19th August. At six in the morning we got again under
sail, and I steered for an island which lay at a small distance
from the main, and at this time bore from us N. 40 W,, distant
about five leagues.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This island is about a league in circuit, and we saw upon it five
of the
natives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
To the N.W. of it are several low islands and quays, which lie
not far from the main, and to the northward and eastward are
several other islands and shoals, so that we were now encompassed
on every
side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The mainland within the islands that have just been mentioned
forms a point, which I called Cape Granville. It lies in latitude
11 deg. 58 min., longitude 217 deg. 38 min., and between it and
Bolt Head is a bay, which I called Temple Bay. At the distance of
nine leagues from Cape Grenville, in the direction of E. ½ N.,
lie some high islands, which I called Sir Charles Hardy's
Islands, and those which lie off the Cape I called Cockburn's
Isles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At four o'clock we discovered some low islands and rocks, bearing
W.N.W., and stood directly for them. At half-an-hour after six we
anchored on the north-east side of the northernmost of them, at
one mile distance, and in sixteen fathom. These islands lie N.W.,
four leagues from Cape Grenville, and, from the number of birds
that I saw upon them, I called them Bird Isles.</p>
<p>"Monday, 24th August. At six o'clock in the morning we got
again under sail, with a fresher breeze at E., and stood away
N.N.W. for some low islands in that
direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At noon we were about four leagues from the main, which we saw
extending to the northward as far as N.W. by N., all flat and
sandy. Our latitude, by observation, was 11 deg 23 sec. 8., and
our longitude 217 deg. 46 min. W.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 21st August. Early in the morning we made sail
again, and steered N.N.W. , by compass, for the northernmost land
in
sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At eight o'clock we discovered shoals ahead and on our larboard
bow, and saw that the northernmost land, which we had taken for
the main, was detached from it, and that we might pass between
them by running to leeward of the shoals on our larboard bow,
which were now near
us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At eleven o'clock we were nearly the length of the land detached
from the main, and there appeared to be no obstruction in the
passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
As soon as the boats were ahead we stood after them, and by noon
got through the passage. Our latitude, by observation, was then
10 deg. 36 min., and the nearest part of the main, which we soon
after found to be the northernmost, bore W. 2 S., distant between
three or four miles. We found the land, which was detached from
the main, to be a single island, extending from N. to N. 75 E.,
distant between two and three
miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The point of the main which forms the side of the channel through
which we had passed, opposite to the island, is the northern
promontory of the country, and I called it York Cape. Its
longitude is 218 deg. 24 min. W.; the latitude of the north point
is 10 deg. 37 min., and of the east point 10 deg. 42 min.
S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
To the southward of the cape the shore forms a large open bay,
which I called Newcastle
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close to
the eastern point of the cape are three small islands, from one
of which a small ledge of rocks runs out into the sea. There is
also an island close to the northern point. The island that forms
the strait or channel through which we had passed lies about four
miles without these, which, except two, are very small; the
southernmost is the largest, and much higher than any part of the
main
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
These islands are distinguished in the chart by the name of York
Isles. We stood along the shore to the westward, with a gentle
breeze at S.E. by S., and when we advanced between three and four
miles we discovered the land ahead, which, when we first saw it,
we took for the main, to be islands detached from it by several
channels. Upon this we sent away the boats, with proper
instructions, to lead us through that channel which was next the
main, but, soon after, discovering rocks and shoals in this
channel, I made a sign for the boats to go through the next
channel to the
northward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At four o'clock in the afternoon we anchored, being about a mile
and a half or two miles within the
entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The main land stretched away to the S.W.; the farthest point in
view bore S. 48 W., and the southernmost point of the island, on
the north-west side of the passage, bore S. 76 W. Between these
two points we could see no land, so that we conceived hopes of
having at last found a passage to the Indian Sea. However, that I
might be able to determine with more certainty, I resolved to
land upon the island which lies at the south-west point of the
passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
When I went into the boat with a party of men, accompanied by Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander, in order to go ashore, we saw ten [of the
inhabitants] upon a hill. Nine of them were armed with such
lances as we had been used to see, and the tenth had a bow and a
bundle of arrows, which we had never seen in the possession of
the natives of this country before. We also observed that two of
them had large ornaments of mother-of-pearl hanging round their
necks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We immediately climbed the highest hill, which was not more than
three times as high as the mast-head and the most barren of any
we had seen. From this hill no land could be seen between the
S.W. and W.S.W., so that I had no doubt of finding a passage
through.</p>
<p>"As I was soon about to quit the eastern coast of New Holland,
which I had coasted from latitude 38 to this place, and which I
am confident no European had ever seen before,* I once more
hoisted English colours, and though I had already taken
possession of several particular parts, I now took possession of
the whole eastern coast, from latitude 38 deg. to this place,
latitude 10½ deg. S., in right of His Majesty King George the
Third, by the name of New South Wales, with all the bays,
harbours, rivers, and islands situated upon it. We then fired
three volleys of small arms, which were answered by the same
number from the ship. Having performed this ceremony upon the
island, which we called Possession Island, we re-embarked in our
boat, but a rapid ebb tide setting N.E. made our return to the
vessel very difficult and tedious.</p>
<p class="foot">[* On the 21 St of August, 1770, Captain Cook's
journal&mdash;Hawkesworth&mdash;says: "As I was about to quit the
eastern coast of New Holland, which I had coasted from latitude
38 S. to this place (Possession Island and Cape York), and which
I am confident no European had ever seen before," &amp;c.</p>
<p class="foot">Now, Matthew Flinders, in his introduction to
Terra Australis in the "Investigator", published in 1814, says:
"It cannot be doubted that the very large islands seen by Torres
at the 11th degree of latitude south, were the hills of Cape
York; or that his 'two months' voyage of intricate navigation
'were employed in passing the strait which divided Terra
Australis from New Guinea. But the account of this and other
discoveries which Torres himself addressed to the King of Spain
was so kept from the world that the existence of such a strait
was generally unknown until 1770, when it was again discovered
and passed by our great circumnavigator, Captain Cook. Torres, it
would appear, took the precaution to lodge a copy of his letter
(to Phillip, King of Spain) in the Archives of Manila, for after
that city had been taken by the British force in 1762, Mr.
Dalrymple (hydrographer to the Admiralty) found out and drew from
oblivion this interesting document of early discovery, and as a
tribute due to the enterprising Spanish navigator, he named
'Torres Straits', and the appellation now prevails."</p>
<p class="foot">Captain Cook did not start in the "Endeavour"
until eight years after Dalrymple's discovery of this document.
His journal was not published by Hawkesworth until 1773. How
then, except from an unaccountable neglect in supplying Cook with
information so important, has such an expression come to be made
use of here: "I am confident no European had ever seen
before?"]</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 22nd August. At noon Possession Island bore N. 53
deg. E., distant four
leagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The south-west point of the largest island on the north-west side
of the passage bore N. 71 deg. W., distant eight miles, and this
point I called Cape Cornwall. It lies in latitude 10 deg. 43 min.
S., longitude 219 deg. W.; and some low lands that lie about the
middle of the passage, which I called Wallis Isles, bore W. by S.
½ S., distant about two leagues. Our latitude, by observation,
was 10 deg. 46 min.
S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Came to an anchor in somewhat less than seven fathom, sandy
ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
A small island, which was first in sight, bore N.W. ½ W.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 23rd August. We weighed, with a light breeze at
S.S.E., and steered N.W. by W. for the small island which was
just in
sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
which we reached by noon, when it bore S., distant about half a
mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our latitude, by observation, was 10 deg. 33 min. S., and our
longitude 219 deg. 22 min. W. In this situation no part of the
main was in sight. As we were now near the island, and had but
little wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon it, and found it, except
a few patches of wood, to be a barren rock, the haunt of birds,
which had frequented it in such numbers as to make the surface
almost uniformly white with their dung. Of these birds, the
greater part seemed to be boobies, and I therefore called the
place Booby Island. After a short stay we returned to the ship,
and in the meantime the wind had got to the S.W. It was but a
gentle breeze, yet it was accompanied by a swell from the same
quarter, which, with other circumstances, confirmed my opinion
that we were got to the westward of the Gulph of Carpentaria, or
the northern extremity of New Holland, and had now an open sea to
the westward, which gave me great satisfaction, not only because
the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end,
but because it would no longer be a doubt whether New Holland and
New Guinea were two separate islands or different parts of the
same.</p>
<p>"The north-east entrance of this passage, or strait, lies in
the latitude of 10 deg. 39 min. S., and in the longitude of 218
deg. 36 min. W.</p>
<p>"It is formed by the main, or the northern extremity of New
Holland, and on the S.E. by a congeries of islands, which I
called the Prince of Wales Islands, to the N.W., and it is
probable that these islands extend quite to New Guinea. They
differ very much both in height and circuit, and many of them
seemed to be well clothed with herbage and wood. Upon most, if
not all of them, we saw
smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
To this channel or passage I have given the name of the ship, and
called Endeavour Straits. Its length, from N.E. to S.W., is ten
leagues, and it is about five leagues broad, except at the
north-east entrance, where it is sometimes less than two miles,
being contracted by the islands which lie there. That which I
called Possession Island is of moderate height and circuit, and
this we left between us and the main, passing between it anil two
small round islands which lie about two miles to the north-west
of it. The two small islands, which I called Wallis Islands, lie
in the middle of the south entrance, and these we left to the
southward." On this day Captain Cook, leaving Booby Island, stood
away north-westerly for the coast of New Guinea, upon which he
landed, and then visited Timor. &amp;c., and thence to Batavia to
re-fit, in December, 1770.</p>
<p>After losing, from disease engendered at that place, seven of
his people, and twenty-three more from the same cause, and
leaving it on Thursday, the 27th of December, Cook arrived at the
Cape of Good Hope on Friday, the 15th March, 1771, at about ten
o'clock in the morning. Leaves the Cape of Good Hope on Thursday,
the 25th of April, called at St. Helena from the 1st to the 4th
of May, and at noon on Wednesday, the 12th of June, came to
anchor in the Downs, and "went ashore at Deal." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Since making the remarks above on the
incorrectness of Cook's expression that "no European had seen",
&amp;c., I have met with an explanation in the fifth chapter of
Macgillivray's "narrative" of the cruise of H.M.S.
"Rattlesnake"&mdash;Captain Owen Stanley. He says that
"Bougainville (1768) was not aware of the discovery of the
passage which afterwards bore the name of Torres, a discovery
(only brought to light by means of the copy of Torres' letter in
the Archives of Manila when taken in 1762 by the British) which
indeed was not published to the world until after our illustrious
navigator Cook, in August, 1770, had confirmed the existence of
such a strait by passing from east to west between the shores of
Australia and New Guinea."]</p>

<h4><span class="a">Captain Matthew Flinders'
Journal</span>.</h4>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">James Cook</span> had broken through the red,
rugged ranks, coral-clad in their uniform front, challenging and
defying with face eastwards, as its rear guard of the Barrier
Range presented its front westwards, to the knights in quest of
the dungeoned "Faerie Queene". Having been the first, the pages
of his grateful country's history worthily illuminate his name.
But no one man's life-energy was sufficient to unravel the skein
which Cook had laid his hand upon in so strange a tangle of the
secrets of the deep sea. Yet one more! no less daring, brave,
skilful, self-sacrificing, enthusiastic cultivator of the ocean
fallow fields stepped out of the ranks of men at once to catch
the mantle falling from the prostrate form of his sea-scourer
father.</p>
<p>On no less worthy and noble shoulders than those of Matthew
Flinders did that mantle display its brightest colours: fly out
in the storms, or wave its folds faithfully to the soft breezes
of Australia's shores, until riven, and rent, and threadbare in
that unrequited service! Cook in native love of justice would
have loved to stand hand-in-hand with his son of the sea, who
taught the world how much the father had left yet
uncompleted.</p>
<p>Have we in Australia thought reverently enough of Flinders?
The man who housed this garden-continent within the economy of a
British domain, with a hand which charted his labour of life and
love: lost in the gloom of a prison, to which French jealousy of
his service to us consigned him? The man who lay almost forgotten
for years therein without one helping hand, one sympathetic voice
among his far-away countrymen, has passed away, it seems, from
our memory as he has from our eyes; absorbed, perhaps, by
that&mdash;questionably attitudinised&mdash;memorial of his
precursor in the "Quest", standing in Sydney Hyde Park, with his
hand stretched seawards&mdash;where the New South Land did not
lie!</p>
<p>A tribute of gratitude to Matthew Flinders need not be the
less because that earned by Cook is so great.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>Extracts from Matthew Flinders' "Introduction to a Voyage to
Terra Australis, undertaken for the purpose of completing the
discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801,
1802, and 1803. in His Majesty's ship the 'Investigator', in two
volumes, 1814."</p>
<p>"Flinders' voyage was undertaken by command of His Majesty, in
the year 1801, in a ship of 334 tons, which received the
appropriate name of the 'Investigator'.</p>
<p>"The vast regions to which this voyage was principally
directed comprehend in the western part the early discoveries of
the Dutch, under the name of 'New Holland'; and in the east, the
coasts explored by British Navigators, and named 'New South
Wales'. It has not, however, been unusual to apply the first
appellation to both
regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The original name, used by the Dutch until some time after
Tasman's, second voyage, in 1644, was 'Terra Australis, or 'Great
South Land'; and when it was displaced by 'New Holland', the term
was applied only to the parts lying westward of a meridian line,
passing through Arnheim's Land on the north, and near the Isles
of St. Francis and St. Peter on the south: all to the eastward,
including the Gulf of Carpentaria, still remained as 'Terra
Australis'. This appears from a chart published by Thevenot, in
1663; which, he says, 'was originally taken from that done in
inlaid work, upon the pavement of the new Stadt-house at
Amsterdam.' * The same thing is inferred from the notes of
Burgomaster Witsen, in 1765.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Relations de divers Voyages Curieux."]</p>
<p>"It is necessary, however, to geographical precision, that so
soon as New Holland and New South Wales were known to form one
land, there should be a general name applicable to the whole, and
this essential point having been ascertained in the present
voyage with a degree of certainty sufficient to authorise the
measure, I have, with the concurrence of opinions entitled to
deference, ventured upon the re-adoption of the original 'Terra
Australis'; and of this term I shall hereafter make use, when
speaking of New Holland and New South Wales in a collective
sense.</p>
<p>"In dividing New South Wales from New Holland, I have been
guided by the British patent to the first Governor of the new
colony, at Port Jackson. In this patent, a meridian, nearly
corresponding to to the ancient line of separation between New
Holland and Terra Australis, has been made the western limit of
New South Wales: and is fixed at the longitude of one hundred and
thirty five degrees east of the meridian of Greenwich.</p>
<p>"The various discoveries which had been made on the west of
Terra Australis, antecedently to the present voyages, are of
dates as widely distant, as are the degrees of confidence to
which they are respectively entitled; the accounts, also are
scattered through various books in different languages; and many
are still in manuscript. It has, therefore, been judged that a
succinct history of these discoveries would be acceptable to the
public.</p>
<p>"Within these few years, two curious manuscript charts have
been brought to light; which have favoured an opinion that Terra
Australis had been visited by Europeans, nearly a century before
any authentic accounts speak of its discovery. One of these
charts is French, without date; and from its almost exact
similitude, is probably either the original or a copy of the
other, which is English; and bears with the date, 1512 a
dedication to the King of England.* In it an extensive country is
marked to the southward of the Moluccas, under the name of Great
Java; which agrees nearer with the position and extent of Terra
Australis, than with any other land, and the direction given to
some parts of the coast approaches too near to the truth for the
whole to have been marked from conjecture alone. But combining
this with the exaggerated extent of Great Java in a southern
direction, and the animals and houses painted upon the shores,
such as have not been seen anywhere else in Terra Australis, it
should appear partly to have been formed from vague information
collected, probably, by the early Portugese navigators, from the
eastern nations; and that conjecture has done the rest. It may,
at the same time, be admitted that a part of the west and
north-west coasts, might have been seen by the Portuguese
themselves, before the year 1540, in their voyages to and from
India.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A more particular account of these charts, now
in the British Museum, will be found in Captain Burney's "History
of Discoveries in the South Seas." Vol I. pp. 379&mdash;383.]</p>
<p>"But quitting those claims to original discovery, in which
conjecture bears so large a share, we come to such as are
supported by undeniable documents.</p>
<p>"The late hydrographer to the Admiralty, Alexander Dalrymple,
Esq., in his curious 'Collection Concerning Papua', published
with a translation, a paper which furnishes more regular and
authentic accounts of the early Dutch discoveries in the east
than anything with which the public was before acquainted. This
interesting paper was procured by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
Banks, and is a copy of the instructions to Commodore Abel Jans
Tasman for his second voyage of discovery. It is dated January
29, 1644, from the Castle of Batavia, and signed by the
Governor-General, Antonio Van Dieman, and by Vander Lyn,
Maatsuyker, Schouten, and Sweers, members of the Council. The
instructions are prefaced with a recital, in chronological order,
of the previous discoveries of the Dutch, whether made from
accident or design, in Nova Guinea and the Great South Land; and
from this account, combined with a passage from Saris,** it
appears that, on the 18th of November, 1605, the Dutch yacht, the
'Duyphen', was despatched from Bantam to explore the islands of
New Guinea, and that she sailed along what was thought to be the
west side of that country to 134 deg. of south latitude. 'This
extensive country was found for the greater part a desert, but in
some places inhabited by wild, cruel, black savages, by whom some
of the crew were murdered, for which reason they could not learn
anything of the land or waters, as had been desired of them, and
from want of provisions and other necessaries they were obliged
to leave the discovery unfinished. The furthest point of the land
in their map was called 'Cape Keer-Weer', or 'Turn Again'.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Purchas." Vol. I., p. 385.]</p>
<p>"The course of the 'Duyphen' from New Guinea was southward,
along the islands on the west side of Torres Straits, to that
part of Terra Australis a little to the west and south of Cape
York; but all these lands were thought to be connected, and to
form the west coast of New Guinea. Thus, without being conscious
of it, the commander of the 'Duyphen' made the first
authenticated discovery of any part of the Great South Land,
about the month of March, 1606; for it appears that he had
returned to Banda in or before the beginning of June of that
year,</p>
<p>"Torres, 1606. Luis Vaes de Torres, a Spanish navigator, was
the next person who saw Terra Australis; and it is remarkable
that it was near the same place, and in the same year, and that
he had as little knowledge of the nature of his discovery as had
the 'Duyphen'.</p>
<p>"Torres was second in command to Pedro Fernandez de Quires
when he sailed with three vessels from the port of Callao, in
Peru, in the year 1605. One of the purposes of the expedition was
to search for the Tierra Austral, a continent which was supposed
to occupy a considerable portion of that part of the southern
hemisphere lying westward of America.</p>
<p>"After the discovery of several islands, Quiros came to a land
which he named 'Australia del Espiritu Santo', supposing it to be
part of the Great Southern Continent; but this, on his separation
from the Admiral, Torres found could be no other than an island;
and then continued his course westward, in prosecution of the
researches.</p>
<p>"About the month of August, 1606, and in latitude 11½ deg. S.,
he fell in with a coast which he calls 'the beginning of New
Guinea', and which appears to have been the south-eastern part of
the land afterwards named Louisiade, by AL de Bougainville, and
now known to be a chain of islands. Unable to pass to windward of
this land, Torres bore away along its south side, and gives,
himself, the following account of his subsequent proceedings:</p>
<p>"'We went along three hundred leagues of this coast, as I have
mentioned, and diminished the latitude 2½ deg., which brought us
into 9 deg. From hence we fell in with a bank of from three to
nine fathoms, which extends along the coast above one hundred and
eighty leagues. We went over it along the coast to 7½ deg. S.
latitude, and the end of it is in 5 deg. We could not go further
on for the many shoals and great currents, so we were obliged to
sail S.W. in that depth to 11 deg. S. latitude. There is all over
it an archipelago of islands without number, by which we passed,
and at the end of the 11th degree the bank became shoaler. Here
were <i>very large islands</i>, and there appeared more to the
southward. They were inhabited by black people, very corpulent,
and naked. Their arms were lances, arrows, and clubs of stone,
ill-fashioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We were upon this bank two months, at the end of which time we
found ourselves in 25 fathoms, and in 5 deg. S. latitude, and 10
leagues from the coast. And having gone four hundred and eighty
leagues, here the coast goes to the N.E., I did not reach it, for
the bank became very shallow. So we stood to the north.'" *</p>

<p>"It cannot be doubted that the 'very large islands' seen by
Torres at the 11th degree of south latitude were the hills of
Cape York, or that his two months of intricate navigation were
employed in passing the strait which divides Terra Australis and
New Guinea. But the account of this and other discoveries, which
Torres himself addressed to the King of Spain, were so kept from
the world that the existence of such a strait was generally
unknown until 1770, when it was again discovered and passed by
our great circumnavigator Captain Cook. Torres, it would appear,
took the precaution to lodge a copy of his letters in the
Archives of Manila, for after that city was taken by the British
forces in 1762, Mr. Dalrymple found out, and drew from oblivion
this interesting document of early discovery, and, as a tribute
due to the enterprising Spanish navigator, he named the passage
Torres Straits, and the appellation now generally prevails.</p>
<p>"Zeachen (1618) is said to have discovered the Land of Arnheim
and the northern Van Dieman's Land in 1618, and he is supposed,
from the first name, to have been a native of Arnheim, in
Holland, and that the second was given in honour of the
Governor-General of the Indies.** But there are two important
objections to the truth of this vague account. First, no mention
is made of Zeachen in the recital of discoveries which preface
the instructions to Tasman, nor is there any of the north coast
having been visited by the Dutch in that year. Secondly, it
appears from Valentyn's 'Lives of the Governors of Batavia', that
Van Dieman was not Governor-General until January 1, 1636.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Aust.":
by President De Brosses. Tome I, p. 432. In the old chart a river
Spult is marked in the western part of Arnheim's Land, and it
seems probable that the land in its vicinity is here meant by
"The Spult".]</p>
<p>"Carstens, 1623. The second expedition, mentioned in the Dutch
recital, for the discovery of the Great South Land, 'was
undertaken in a yacht, in the year 1619, with little success';
and the journal and remarks were not to be found. In January,
1623, the yachts 'Pera' and 'Arnheim', under the command of Jan
Carstens, were despatched from Amboina, by order of His
Excellency. Jan Pieterz Coen-Carstens, with eight of the
'Arnheim's' crew, was treacherously murdered by the natives of
New Guinea; but the vessels prosecuted the voyage, and discovered
'the great islands of Araheim and Spult.' They were 'untimely
separated', and the 'Arnheim' returned to Amboina. The 'Pera'
persisted, and sailed along the south coast of New Guinea to a
flat cone, situate in 10 deg. south latitude; and ran along the
west coast of this land to Cape Keer-Weer; from thence discovered
the coast further southward as far as 17 deg. to Staten river.
From this place what more of the land could be discovered seemed
to stretch westward. The 'Pera' then returned to Amboina.</p>
<p>"Gerrit Tomaz Pool was sent in April, 1636, from Banda, with
the yachts 'Klyn Amsterdam', and 'Wezel', upon the same
expedition as Carstens, and at the same place, on the coast of
New Guinea, he met with the same fate. Nevertheless, the voyage
was assiduously continued under the charge of ihe supra cargo
Pieterz Pietersen; and the islands Key Jarrouw visited. By reason
of very strong easterly winds they could not reach the west coast
of New Guinea (Carpentaria); but shaping their course very near
south, discovered the coast of Arnheim, or Van Dieman's Land, in
11 deg. S. latitude; and sailed along the shore for one hundred
and twenty miles (thirty miglen) without seeing any people, but
many signs of smoke.</p>
<p>"This is all that appears to have been known of the north
coast, when Abel Jansz Tasman sailed upon his second voyage in
1644; for the instructions to him say that after quitting Point
Ture, or False Cape, situate in 8 deg. on the south coast of New
Guinea: 'You are to continue eastward, along the coast, to 9 deg.
south latitude; crossing prudently the cove at that place.
Looking about the high islands or Speult's river, with the
yachts, for a harbour; despatching the tender, De Braak, for two
or three days into cove, in order to discover whether, within the
Great Inlet, there be not to be found an entrance into the South
Sea.* From this place you are to coast along the west coast of
New Guinea (Carpentaria) to the furthest discoveries in 17 deg.
south latitude; following the coast further, as it may run, west
or southward, But it is to be feared you will meet, in these
parts, with the south-east trade winds; from which it will be
difficult to keep the coast on board, if stretching to the
south-east; but, notwithstanding this, endeavour by all means to
proceed; that we may be sure whether this land is divided from
the Great Known South Continent or not.'</p>
<p class="foot">[* The great Inlet or Cove, where the passage was
to besought, in the north-west part of Torres Strait. It is
evident that a suspicion was entertained in 1644 of such a
Strait; but then the Dutch were ignorant of its having been
passed The "high islands" are those which lie in latitude 10
degrees on the west side of the Strait. Speult's river appears to
be the opening betwixt Prince of Wales Islands and Cape York:
Through which Captain Cook afterwards passed, and entered
"Endeavour Straits". This Speult's river cannot, I conceive, be
the same with what was before-mentioned under the name of the
"Spult".]</p>
<p>"The Dutch had by this time acquired some knowledge of a pari
of the south coast of Terra Australis; of the west coast; and a
part of the north-west; and these are the lands meant by 'the
Great Known South Continent; Arnheim's and the northern Van
Dieman's Land on the north coast, are not included in the
expression; for Tasman was directed from De Witt's Land (on the
north-west coast) to run across, very near eastward, to complete
the discovery of Arnheim's and Van Dieman's Lands, and to
ascertain perfectly, whether these lands are not one and the same
island.</p>
<p>"It is a great obstacle to tracing correctly the progress of
early discovery in Terra Australis that no account of this voyage
of Tasman has ever been published; nor is any such known to
exist. But it seems to have been the general opinion that he
sailed round the Gulph of Carpentaria, and then westward along
Arnheim's and the northern Van Dieman's Lands, and the form of
these coasts in the charts of most geographers, even up to the
end of the eighteenth century, is supposed to have resulted from
this voyage. This opinion is strengthened by finding the name of
Tasman, and of the Governor-General and two of the Council, who
signed his instructions, applied to places at the head of the
Guph; as is also Maria, the daughter of the Governor, to whom our
navigator was attached. In the notes also of Burgomaster Witsen,
concerning the inhabitants of Nova Guinea and Hollandia Nova, as
extracted by Mr. Dalrymple, Tasman is mentioned among those from
whom his information was drawn.</p>
<p>"The President De Brosses * gives from the miscellaneous
tracts of Nicholas Struyck, printed at Amsterdam, 1753, the
following account of another, and last voyage of the Dutch, for
the discovery of the north coast.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Hist. des Navigations aux Terres Aust." Tome
I, p. 437.]</p>
<p>"'March 1, 1765. Three Dutch vessels were sent from Timor with
orders to explore the north coast of New Holland, better than it
had been done before. They carefully examined the coasts,
sand-banks, and reefs. In their route to it, they did not meet
with any land, but only some rocks above water in 11 deg. 52 min.
south latitude: (probably the south part of the great Sahul Bank,
which, according to Captain Peter Heywood, who saw it 1801, lies
in 11 deg. 40 min.) They saw the west coast of New Holland 4 deg.
to the eastward of the last point of Timor.</p>
<p>"'From thence they continued their route towards the north,
and passed a point off which lies a bank of sand above water; in
length, more than five German miles of fifteen to a degree. After
which, they made sail to the east, along the coast of New
Holland, observing everything with care, until they came to a
gulph, the head of which they did not quite reach. I (Struyck)
have seen a chart made of these parts.'</p>
<p>"What is now called the west must have been the north-west
coast, which the vessels appear to have made somewhat to the
south of Cape Van Dieman. The point which they passed was
probably this same cape itself, and in a chart published by Mr.
Dalrymple, August 27, 1783, from a Dutch manuscript (possibly a
copy of that which Struyck had seen), a shoal of thirty
geographic miles in length is marked as running off from it; but
incorrectly, according to Mr. McCluer. The gulph here mentioned
was probably a deep bay in Arnheim's Land, for had it been the
Gulph of Carpentaria, some particular mention of the great change
in the direction of the coast, would doubtless have been
made.</p>
<p>"From this imperfect account of the voyage of these three
vessels very little satisfactory information is obtained, and
this, with some few exceptions, is the case with all the accounts
of the early Dutch discoveries, and has usually been attributed
to the monopolising spirit of their East India Company, which
induced it to keep secret or to destroy the journals.</p>
<p>"The north coast of Terra Australis does not appear to have
been seen by any succeeding navigator until the year 1770, when
our celebrated Captain James Cook passed through Endeavour
Straits, between Cape York and the Prince of Wales Islands; and
besides clearing up the doubt which till then existed of the
actual separation of Terra Australis from New Guinea, his more
accurate observations enabled geographers to assign something
like a true place to the former discoveries of the Dutch in these
parts. Captain Cook did not land upon the main, but at Possession
Island. He saw ten natives. 'Nine of them were armed with such
lances as we had been accustomed to see, and the tenth had a bow
and a bundle of arrows, which we had never seen in the possession
of the natives of this country before.'*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Hawkesworth's Voyages." Vol. Ill, page
11.]</p>
<p>"1791. At the end of this year. Lieutenant J. McCluer, of the
'Bombay Marine', in returning from the examination of the west
side of New Guinea, made the land of Arnheim in longitude 1357 E.
of Greenwich. He then sailed westward along the shore to 129 deg.
55 min., when the coast was found to make a southern direction.
The point of turning is placed in 11 deg. 15 min. S. latitude,
and is, doubtless, the Cape Van Dieman of the old charts, and the
west extremity of the north coast of Terra
Australis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Lieut. McCluer is the last person who can strictly be said to
have added to our knowledge of the north coast of Terra Australis
previously to the time in which the voyage of the 'Investigator'
was planned, but several navigators had followed Captain Cook
through Torres Straits. Thus in&mdash;</p>
<p>"1789. After the mutineers of the 'Bounty' had forced the
Commander, Lieut. (now Rear-Admiral) William Bligh to embark in
the launch, near the island of Tofoa, he steered for Coepang, a
Dutch settlement on the south-west end of Timor. In the way he
made the east coast of New South Wales, in about 12½ degrees S.
latitude; and sailing northward, passed round Cape York and the
Prince of Wales Islands. As Captain Bligh passed to the
<i>north</i> of those islands, whereas Captain Cook had passed to
the <i>south</i>, his account made an useful addition to what
little was known of Torres Straits.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Bligh's Voyage to the South Seas in H.M. Ship
'Bounty'." pp. 218&mdash;221.]</p>
<p>"1791. Capt. (now Admiral) Edward Edwards of H.M. frigate
'Pandora', on his return from the island 'Taheity', made the
reefs of Torres Straits, on August 25, at about latitude 10
degress south, and 2 degrees of longitude to the east of Cape
York. From thence, steering westward, he fell in with the islands
rather high, which he named Murray's, lying in latitude 9 deg. 57
min. south, and longitude 143 deg. 42 min. east; and some canoes
with two masts, were seen running within side of the reef, which
lay between the island and the ship. The reef was of considerable
extent, and during the whole of August 26, Captain Edwards ran
along it to the southward without finding any passage through. On
the 27th, the search was continued, without success; but on the
28th, a boat was despatched to examine an opening in the reef;
and the ship stood off and on, waiting the result. At five in the
evening, the boat made a signal for a passage being found, but
fearing to venture through, so near sunset, Captain Edwards
called the boat on board. In the meantime, a current or tide, set
the 'Pandora' upon the reef; and after beating there till ten
o'clock, she went over it into deep water, and sank in fifteen
fathoms, at daylight, on the 29th.</p>
<p>"A dry sand-bank was perceived within the opening, at the
distance of four miles, and thither the boats repaired with the
remaining officers and people; thirty-nine men having lost their
lives in this disaster. This opening was found to lie in latitude
10 deg. 24 min., and longitude 143 deg. 38 min., and is
represented as very practicable for ships.</p>
<p>"Not being able to save anything from the wreck. Captain
Edwards, being short of provisions and water, set sail on August
30 with his squadron of eight boats, and steered for the
north-east part of Terra Australis.</p>
<p>"September 2. In the afternoon Captain Edwards passed out to
the northward, from amongst the Prince of Wales Islands, and the
same evening, by steering westward, cleared all the islands and
reefs of Torres Straits. On the 14th he reached Timor.</p>
<p>"Bligh and Portlock, 1792. Neither the great extent of the
reef to the eastward of Cape York, nor the loss of the 'Pandora'
were known in 1792, when Captain William Bligh came a second time
to Torres Straits, with His Majesty's ship 'Providence', and the
brig 'Assistant'&mdash;commanded by Lieutenant (now captain) P.
Nathaniel Portlock. The objects of his mission were to transport
the bread-fruit from Taheity to the West Indies; and on his way,
to explore a new passage through the strait; in both of which he
was successful. (See Introduction.)</p>
<p>"Brampton and Holt, 1793. The last passage known to have been
made through Torres' Straits previous to the sailing of the
'Investigator', was by Messieurs William Bampton and Matthew B.
Alt, Commanders of the ships 'Hormuzeer' and 'Chesterfield'.
Their discoveries were made public in two charts by Mr.
Dalrymple, in 1798 and 1799; and from them and Captain Bampton's
manuscript journal, the south Coast of New Guinea and most of the
reefs and islands near it are laid
down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The journal was obtained through the kindness of Mr. Arrowsmith.
(Abridgment of journal given in 'Introduction' wherein is
mentioned that the Union Jack was hoisted on Darnley's Island,
and <i>New Guinea</i> and the neighbouring islands were taken
possession of in the name of His Majesty on July 10, after the
murder by the natives of Captain Hill, of the New South Wales
corps&mdash;a passenger by the 'Chesterfield', and four seamen:
Messieurs Shaw (chief mate) and Carter, of the same party, in a
whale boat, severely wounded, together with the remaining seaman;
Ascott, having got back into the boat, cut the grapnel rope and
escaped. It being impossible to reach the ships which were five
leagues to windward, they bore away to the west, through the
strait, and on the tenth day, without provisions or compass,
reached Timor coast, obtained some relief, and went on to an
island called by the natives, Sarrett; when Mr. Carter died, Mr.
Shaw and Ascott sailed in a prow for Banda, in the April
following.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Collins' account of the "English Colony in
New South Wales." Vol. I. p. 464.]</p>
<p>"This passage of the 'Hormuzeer' and 'Chesterfield' in
seventy-two days, with that made in nineteen by the Captains
Bligh and Portlock displayed the extraordinary dangers of the
Strait, and appear to have deterred all other commanders from
following them, up to the time of the 'Investigator'. Their
accounts confirm the truth of Torres having passed through it, by
showing the correctness of the sketch contained in his letter to
the King of Spain.</p>
<p>"The account of the discoveries which resulted from the
establishment of the colony in New South Wales, closes with this
expedition, and it remains only to point out what was wanted to
be done in these parts of Terra Australis.</p>
<p>"On the east coast of New South Wales, from Bass's Strait to
Bustard Bay, in latitude 24 deg., the shore might be said to be
well explored; but from thence northward to Cape York, there were
several portions which had either been passed by Captain Cook in
the night, or at such a distance in the daytime as to render
their formation doubtful.</p>
<p>"The following openings or bights had been seen and named by
Captain Cook, but were yet unexamined: Keppel and Shoalwater
Bays, Broadsound, Repulse, Edgecumbe, Cleveland, Halifax,
Rockingham, and Weary Bays. To the northward of these were
Weymouth, Temple. Shelburne, and Newcastle Bays, and perhaps many
others which distance did not permit our first navigator to
notice. There was also a numerous list of islands, of which a few
only had been examined, and several were merely indicated from a
distant view.</p>
<p>"From 16 degrees northward to Cape York, an extensive chain of
reefs had been found to lie at a considerable distance from the
coast. without side of the islands, and two vessels from Port
Jackson had met with others further south, extending nearly from
21 deg. to 23 deg. It was of importance to ascertain the limits
of these vast bodies of coral, were it only on account of ships
employed in the whale fishery; but in view to future settlements
within the tropics, it was necessary to be known whether these
reefs might form such a barrier to the coast as to render it
inaccessible from the eastward; if not, then the open parts were
to be ascertained.</p>
<p>"On the arrival of His Majesty's ship 'Reliance' in England,
at the latter end of 1800, the charts of the new discoveries were
published, and a plan was proposed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
Banks for completing the investigation of the coasts of Terra
Australis. The plan was approved by that distinguished patron of
science and useful enterprise; it was laid before Earl Spencer,
then First Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, and finally
received the sanction of His Majesty, who was graciously pleased
to direct that the voyage should be undertaken, and I had the
honour of being appointed to the command.</p>
<p>"The sole remaining information relative to the north coast of
Terra Australis, was contained in a note transcribed by Mr.
Dalrymple from a work of Burgomaster Witsen upon the "Migration
of Mankind." The place of which the Burgomaster speaks is
evidently on the coast of Carpentaria, near the head of the
Gulph; but it is called New Guinea; and he wrote in 1705. The
note is as follows, but upon whose authority it was given does
not appear.</p>
<p>"'In 16 deg. 10 min. south longitude, 159 deg. 17 min. (east
of Teneriffe, or between 142 deg. and 143 deg. east of
Greenwich), the people swam on board of a Dutch ship, and when
they received a present of a piece of linen, they laid it on
their head in token of gratitude: everywhere thereabout all the
people are malicious. They use bows and arrows of such a length
that one end rests on the ground when shooting."</p>
<p>"On summing up the whole of the knowledge which had been
acquired of the North Coast, it will appear that natural history,
geography, and navigation had still much to learn of this part of
the world: and more particularly that they required the
accomplishment of the following objects: 1st. A general survey of
Torres Strait. The navigation from the Pacific, or Great Ocean,
to all parts of India, and to the Cape of Good Hope would be
greatly facilitated if a passage through the Strait, moderately
free from danger, could be discovered, since five or six weeks of
the usual route, by the north of New Guinea, or the more eastern
island would thereby be saved.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding the great obstacles which navigators had
encountered in some parts of the strait, there was still room to
hope, that an examination of the whole, made with care and
perseverance, would bring such a passage to light. A survey of it
was, therefore, an object much to be desired, not only for the
merchants and seamen trading to these parts, but also from the
benefits which would certainly accrue therefrom to general
navigation and geography.</p>
<p>"2nd. An examination of the shores of the Gulph of
Carpentaria. The real form of the Gulph remained in as great
doubt with geographers as were the manner how, and time when, it
acquired its name. I am aware that the President De. Brosses
says, 'this same year (1628) Carpentaria was thus named by P.
Carpenter, who discovered it when a general in service of the
Dutch company. He returned from India to Europe in the month of
June, 1628, with five ships richly laden.' 'Hist, des Nav. aux
Terres Aust.' But the President here seems to give either his
own, or the Abbé Prévost's conjectures, for matters of fact. We
have seen that the coast called Carpentaria was discovered long
before 1628; and it is, besides, little probable that Carpenter
should have been making discoveries with five ships richly laden,
and homeward bound. This name of Carpentaria does not once appear
in Tasman's Instructions, dated 1644, but is found in Thevenot's
Chart of 1663.</p>
<p>"The east side of the Gulph had been explored to the latitude
of 17 deg., and many rivers were thus marked and named; but how
far the representation given of it by the Dutch was faithful,
what were the productions, and what its inhabitants, were, in a
great measure, uncertain. Or rather it was certain that those
early navigators did not possess the means of fixing the
positions and forms of lands with anything like the accuracy of
modern science; and that they could have known very little of the
productions or inhabitants. So that conjecture being at liberty
to appropriate the Gulph of Carpentaria to itself, had made it
the entrance to a vast arm of the sea, dividing Terra Australis
into two or more islands.</p>
<p>"3rd. A more exact investigation of the bays, shoals, islands,
and coasts of Arnheim's and the northern Van Dieman's lands. The
information upon these was attended with uncertainty: first,
because the state of navigation was very low at the time of their
discovery, and, again, from want of details and authorities upon
which they had been laid down. Of the river Spult and other large
streams represented to intersect the coast the existence even was
doubtful. Thus, whatever could bear the name of exact, whether in
natural history, geography, or navigation, was yet to be learned
of a country possessing five hundred leagues of sea coast, and
placed in a climate and neighbourhood where the richest
productions of both the vegetable and mineral kingdom were known
to exist. A voyage which should have hail no other view than the
survey of Torres Straits, and the thorough investigation of the
north coast of Terra Australis, could not have been accused of
wanting an object worthy of national consideration.</p>
<p>"1788. East Coast. The year 1788 will ever be a memorable
epoch in the history of Terra Australis. On January 18, Captain
(now Vice-Admiral) Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay, with His
Majesty's ship 'Supply', and was followed by the 'Sirius',
Captain John Hunter, six sail of transports, and three store
ships. The purpose of this armament was to establish a colony in
New South Wales, over which extensive country Captain Phillip was
appointed Governor and Captain-General. Botany Bay proved to be
an unfavourable situation for the new colony; it was, therefore,
abandoned in favour of Port Jackson, which lies three leagues to
the northward, and was found to be one of the finest harbours in
the world.</p>
<p>"In the beginning of 1795, Captain (now Admiral) Hunter sailed
a second time for New South Wales, to succeed Captain Phillip in
the government of the new colony. He took with him His Majesty's
armed vessels 'Reliance' and 'Supply'; and the author of this
account, who was then a midshipman,* and had not long before
returned from a voyage to the South Seas, was led by his passion
for exploring new countries to embrace the opportunity of going
out upon a station which, of all others, presented the most ample
field for his favourite pursuit.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the "Reliance."]</p>
<p>"To the Straits, which in the years 1798 and 1799 had been the
great object of research, and whose discovery by Messrs. Flinders
and Bass was then completed, Governor Hunter gave, by my
recommendation, the name of Bass Straits. This was no more than a
just tribute to my worthy friend and companion for the extreme
dangers and fatigues he had undergone in first entering it in a
whale-boat, and to the correct judgment he had formed from
various indications of the existence of a wide opening between
Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales. His success favoured my
views of further discovery, and the 'Reliance' not being
immediately wanted for service, his Excellency accepted a
proposition to explore Glasshouse and Hervey's Bays&mdash;two
large openings to the northward, of which the entrances only were
known. I had hopes of finding a considerable river discharging
itself at one of these openings, and of being also by its means
to penetrate further into the interior of the country than had
hitherto been effected.</p>
<p>"The sloop, 'Norfolk' was again allotted to me, and I was
accompanied by Mr. S.W. Flinders, midshipman of the 'Reliance',
and by Bongaree, a native. Of the assistance of my friend Bass I
was, however, deprived, he having quitted the station to return
to England. The time of my absence was limited to six weeks, some
arrivals being then expected which might call the 'Reliance' into
active service. We sailed out of Port Jackson July 8th, 1799, and
next morning came in with a part of the coast north of Port
Stephens, which Captain Cook had passed in the night. Off a
projection, which I called Sugar Loaf Point, in latitude 32 deg.
29 min., lie two rocks to the south-eastward. We passed between
these rocks and the point, and kept close in with the shore as
far to the north as the hills called 'Three Brothers', by Captain
Cook. On the 11th we sailed amongst the Solitary Isles, of which
five were added to the number before seen; I continued to keep
close in with the coast. In latitude 29 deg. 43 min., we
discovered a small opening like a river, with an islet lying in
the entrance; and at sunset entered a larger, to which I gave the
name of Shoal Bay, an appellation which it but too well merited.
Shoal Bay is difficult to be found except by its latitude, which
is 29 deg. 26½ min. Cape Byron, in latitude 28 deg. 38 min., and
the coast for twelve miles to the north, were passed on the 13th,
but no particular additions or corrections could be made to
Captain Cook's chart. At Moreton Bay, further on, the navigator
had left it in doubt whether there were any opening, and
therefore we closed in again with the land at Point Look-out.</p>
<p>"At noon the point bore S. 2 deg., E. three or four miles, and
a small flat islet E. 3 deg., N. three or four miles: the opening
in Moreton Bay was then evident, and bore W.N.W. It is small, and
formed by two sandy points, beyond which a large extent of border
was visible. Our latitude at this time was 27 deg. 24 min.,
giving that of Point Look-out to be 27 deg. 27 min. S. Captain
Cook says it is in latitude 27 deg. 6 min., a difference which
probably arose from his having allowed for a strong northern
current, during the run of four or five hours from the preceding
noon, whereas, in reality, none existed.</p>
<p>"We stood on to within two miles of the opening in Moreton
Bay, but seeing it blocked up by many shoals of sand, and the
depth having diminished, the course was altered for Cape Moreton.
At eight in the evening the anchor was dropped in seven fathoms,
at the entrance of Glasshouse Bay, Cape Moreton bearing E.S.E.
two or three miles. But little progress was made up the Bay on
the 15th, owing to the many shoals and a foul wind. At noon the
latitude of Cape Moreton was ascertained to be 27 deg. ½ south,
and the longitude, corrected by the observations at Greenwich,
was 153 deg. 25 min. east, being 4½ min. south, and 7 min. west
of its position by Captain Cook. In the evening, the sloop was at
anchor within two miles of a low projection, which an unfortunate
occurrence afterwards caused to be named Point Skirmish. On the
16th, whilst beating up amongst the shoals, an opening was
perceived round the point, and being much in want of a place to
lay the sloop on shore, on account of a leak, I tried to enter;
but not finding it accessible from the south, was obliged to make
the examination with the boat, whilst the sloop lay at anchor
five miles off.</p>
<p>"There was a party of natives on the point, and our
communication was at first friendly; but after receiving presents
they made an attack. and one of them was wounded by our fire.
Proceeding up the opening, I found it to be more than a mile in
width, and from the quantity of pumice stone on the borders it
was called Pumice Stone river. It led towards the remarkable
peaks called the Glass Houses, which were now suspected to be
volcanic, and excited my curiosity. The leak being partly
repaired, I left the Glass Houses and the river for a future
examination, and proceeded up the bay with the afternoon's flood.
On the 18th, at noon, we had passed two low islands surrounded
with shoals, and anchored abreast of a third. Next day we beat up
against a southern wind to a sixth island; but the shoals then
became more numerous, and the channels so narrow that it was very
difficult to proceed further. The latitude observed upon the
sixth island was 27 deg. 35 min., being thirty-four miles south
of Cape Moreton, at the entrance to the bay. Above this island
the east and west shores, from being nine or ten miles apart,
approach each other within two miles, and the space between them
takes the form of a river, but the entrance was too full of
shoals to leave a hope of penetrating by it far into the
interior, or that it could be of importance to navigation.</p>
<p>"Under this discouragement, all further research at the head
of Glass House Bay was given up, and I proceeded to seek in
Pumice Stone river for a place to stop the leak more securely,
and the means of visiting the Glass Houses. On the 22nd we got
into the river after many difficulties, arising principally from
shoals in the entrance which could only be passed at high
water.</p>
<p>"July 25. The leaky plank being quite secured, and the sloop
restored and completed with water, we proceed two miles further
up the river, amongst mangrove islets and muddy flats. Next
morning I landed on the west side, as far above the sloop as the
boat could advance, and with my friend Bongaree and two sailors,
steered north-westward for the Glass House peaks. After nine
miles of laborious walking, mostly through swamps or over a rocky
country, we reached the top of a stony mount, from whence the
highest peak was four miles distant, to the north-west Three or
four leagues beyond it was a ridge of mountains, from which
various small streams descend into Pumice Stone river, the
principal place of their junction seeming to be at a considerable
extent of water, which bore 80 deg. E., and was about six miles
above the sloop. Early on the 27th we reached the foot of the
nearest Glass House, a flat-topped peak, one mile and a half
north of the stony mount. It was impossible to ascend this almost
perpendicular rock; and, finding no marks of volcanic eruption,
we returned to the sloop the same evening. Some communication
with the natives had been obtained while the sloop was on shore.
I am happy to say they were all friendly, which is attributable
to their opinion of us, having undergone a salutary change from
the effect of our fire-arms at Point Skirmish. These people were
evidently of the same race as those at Port Jackson, though
speaking a language which Bongaree could not understand. They
fish almost wholly with cast and setting nets, live more in
society than the natives to the southward, and are better lodged.
Two or three bark canoes were seen, but from the number of black
swans in the river, of which eighteen were caught in our little
boat, it should seem that these people are not dexterous in the
management of the canoe or spear.</p>
<p>"The entrance of Glasshouse Bay, from Cape Skirmish to the
inner part of Cape Moreton is eight miles wide; but it contains
so many shoals that a ship would have much difficulty in finding
a passage. These shoals are of sand, and in the channels between
them, are various depths from five to thirteen fathoms. The land
on the borders of Pumice Stone river is low, and is either sandy
or rocky, with a slight superficies of vegetable soil, yet not
ill-clothed with grass and wood. On the west side of Glasshouse
Bay, the appearance of the land was much similar. The long slip
on the east side, which I have called Moreton Island, as
supposing it would have received that name from Captain Cook, had
he known of its insularity, is little else than a ridge of rocky
hills, with a sandy surface, but the peninsula further south had
some appearance of fertility. I judged favourably of the country
on the borders of what seemed to be a river falling into the head
of the bay, both from its thick covering of wood, and from the
good soil of the sixth island which lies at the entrance. The
other islands in the bay are very low, and so surrounded with
forest of large mangrove, that it would be difficult to land upon
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"July 31. We sailed out of Pumice Stone river and by keeping
near the shore of Point Skirmish had generally six
fathom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Being constantly repulsed by shoals, I was at length forced to
relinquish the hope of penetrating further up Hervey's Bay. We
then started north-westward, to complete the examination of the
west side down to the coast seen by Captain
Cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"August 7. At daylight, a sloping hummock, in latitude 24 deg.
50 min., bore W. 16 N., our distance off the shore under it being
one mile and a half, and the depth seven fathom. The coast was
then seen extending to the W.N.W., and having been laid down by
Captain Cook, the north-eastern course was continued for Break
Sea Spit, and the examination of Hervey's Bay concluded. This
inlet is about fifteen leagues across, from the sloping hummock
to the eastern extremity of Sandy Cape, and nearly as much in
depth. The east side is formed by a great sandy peninsula, of
which the Cape is the northern extremity; but about half way up
there arc several while cliffs, and others in the upper bay,
which had the appearance of chalk.</p>
<p>"The shores at the head and on the west side, arc more rocky
than sandy; the back land is low for some miles and not ill
covered with grass and wood; it then rises to hills of
considerable elevation. amongst which Double Mount was most
remarkable. The smokes in different places bespoke the country to
be inhabited in the scanty numbers usual on other parts of the
east coast, but none of the people were seen.</p>
<p>"At ten in the evening, we passed the end of Break Sea Spit,
and hauled up south-east; but the winds were so unfavourable that
on the 14th our latitude was no more than 29 deg. 19 min. I kept
the land barely within sight, in order to obtain the greatest
advantage from the southwardly current; for contrary to Captain
Cook's observations, it was found to be strongest at the distance
of six, and from thence to twenty leagues. Close in with the
shore, more especially in the bights which fall within the
general line of the coast, an eddy had been found setting to the
northward. Light northern winds favoured us for two days, but
returning to the southward and sometimes blowing strong; it was
the 20th in the evening, before the sloop was secured in Port
Jackson, although the current had set us two hundred and ten
miles on the way. I must acknowledge myself to have been
disappointed in not being able to penetrate into the interior of
New South Wales by either of the openings examined in this
expedition, but however mortifying the conviction might be, it
was then an ascertained fact, that no river of importance
intersected the east coast between the 24th and 29th degrees of
south latitude."
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"On the 19th of January, 1801, a commission was signed at the
Admiralty appointing the lieutenant of His Majesty's ship
'Investigator.' to which the name of the ship hitherto known as
the 'Xenophon', was changed by this commission; and Captain John
Henry Martin having received orders to consider himself to be
superseded, I took the command at Sheerness, on the 25th of the
same month.</p>
<p>"The 'Investigator' was a north-country built ship, of 330
tons; and in form, nearly resembled the description of vessel
recommended by Captain Cook as best calculated for voyages of
discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Every chart at the Admiralty, which related to Terra Australis,
and the neighbouring Islands, was copied for us under the
direction of the late hydrographer, Alexander Dalrymple, Esq.</p>
<p>"On July 18th, 1801, we sailed from
Spithead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At daybreak of November 4th a light breeze from the eastward
enabled me to quit Simon's Bay after a stoppage (at the Cape of
Good Hope of eighteen days) at six in the
evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We took our departure for New Holland.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 9th May, 1802. At one o'clock we gained the Heads
(Port Jackson), and soon after three the 'Investigator' was
anchored in Sydney Cove.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 22nd July. Lieutenant John Murray, commander of the
brig 'Lady Nelson', having received orders to put himself under
my command, I gave him a code of signals, and directed him, in
case of separation, to repair to Hervey's Bay, which he was to
enter by a passage, said to have been found by the South Sea
whalers, between Sandy Cape and Break Sea Spit. In the morning of
July 22, we sailed out of Port Jackson together, and the breeze
being fair and fresh, ran rapidly to the northward, keeping at a
little distance from the coast.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 25 July. The sun was setting at the time Cape Byron
bore west, three or four miles, and the coast from thence to
Point Lookout having been seen by Captain Cook, we steered off in
order to avoid falling in with the reefs of Point Danger in the
night. At eleven, hauled more in for the land.</p>
<p>"Monday, 26 July. Mount Warning was set at S. 25 deg., W.
twenty leagues. In coming in with Point Look-out, I took
observations for the latitude and longitude, which fixed it at 27
deg. 27 min. south, and 153 deg. 31 min. east. The latitude is
the same as it had been made in the Norfolk but is 19 min. south
and 3 min. west of the situation given by Captain Cook's
chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We made sail for Cape Moreton, and came up with it at four
o'clock. I was much surprised to see a small but dangerous reef
lying between four and five miles off this Cape to the
north-east, which had not been noticed in the Norfolk" (see
above, Flinders, 1798-9, the colonial sloop allotted to him of
twenty-five tons, in Sydney, by Governor Hunter) "in entering
Glasshouse Bay, I had then hauled close round Cape Moreton at
dusk in the evening, and in coming out had passed too far
westward to observe it.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 27th July. After passing the dangerous reef, we
steered northward until three in the morning, and then hove to
until daylight, for the purpose of examining the land about
Double Island Point and Wide Bay, which did not appear to have
been well distinguished by Captain Cook. At seven o'clock the
point bore N. 2 W., six leagues, and the shore abreast, a beach
with sandy hills behind it was distant six miles. Between the
point S. 63 deg. W. and a low bluff head bearing S. 32 deg. W.,
was a bight in the coast, where the sand hill seemed to
terminate, for the back land further south was high and rocky,
with small peaks on the top similar to the ridge behind the Glass
Houses, of which it is probably a continuation.</p>
<p>"At half-past nine we hauled close round Double Island Point,
within a rock lying between one and two miles to the N.N.E.,
having seven fathoms for the least water. The point answered
Captain Cook's description. It is a steep head at the extremity
of a neck of land, which runs out two miles from the main, and
lies in 25 deg. 56 min. S. and 153 deg. 13 mm. E. On the north
side of the point the coast falls back to the westward, and
presents a steep shore of white sand, but in curving round Wide
Bay the sandy land becomes very low, and a small opening was seen
in it leading to a piece of water like a lagoon, but the shoals
which lie across the entrance render it difficult of access, if,
indeed, there be a passage for anything larger than boats. Had
the 'Lady Nelson' been with me I should have attempted to get her
into the lagoon, having previously entertained a conjecture that
the head of Hervey's Bay might communicate with Wide Bay, but the
apprehension that Lieutenant Murray would arrive at the first
rendezvous, and proceed to the next before we could join him,
deterred me from attempting it with the 'Investigator' or with
boats.</p>
<p>"Upon the north side of the opening there were a number of
Indians, fifty as reported, looking at the ship, and near Double
Island Point ten others had been seen, implying a more numerous
population than is usual to the southward. I inferred from hence,
that the piece of water at the head of Wide Bay was extensive and
shallow; for in such places the natives draw much subsistence
from fish which there abound, and are more easily caught than in
deep water. So far as could be seen from the mast-head at three
or four miles off, the water extended about five miles westward.
Its extent north and south could not be distinguished, and it
seemed probable that one, and perhaps two streams fall into it,
for there were many large medusæ floating at the entrance, such
as are usually found near the mouths of
rivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our course at night was directed by the fires on the shore, and
the wind being moderate from the south-westward, it was continued
until ten o'clock; after which we stood off and on until
daylight.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 28th July, Had Indian Head bearing S. 54 deg. W.
one mile and a-half. This head was so named by Captain Cook from
the great number of Indians assembled there in 1770. At eleven
o'clock we reached Sandy Cape, and the master was sent ahead to
sound in a small passage through Break Sea Spit. The ship
followed under easy sail until we got into three fathoms, and the
master not making the signal for any deeper water, I tacked and
called the boat on board. The channel appeared to go quite
through the Spit into Hervey's Bay, but as there were in many
parts not more than two fathoms it can be passed only by small
vessels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our observations fixed Sandy Cape in 24 deg. 42 min. S. and 153
deg. 16 min. E,, being 3 deg. north, and 7 min. east of the
position assigned to it by Captain Cook.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 29th July. At three in the morning, on a breeze
springing up at S.W. by S., we stretched south-eastwards, and a
vessel having been observed overnight off Indian Head, this tack
was prolonged till seven o'clock, when seeing nothing of her, we
stood back to the Spit, and coasted close along its east side as
before, in from ten to five fathoms water. At forty minutes after
noon we passed over the tail of the Spit, in latitude 24 deg. 24
min.; the water then deepening suddenly from six and seven to
twenty-two fathoms, and the white patches on Sandy Cape bearing
S. 8 deg. E. In standing N.W. by W. we crossed a bank in eleven
fathoms, and on tacking, passed another part of it with only
five. The water upon it was not discoloured, nor had it been
observed by Captain Cook or me in the 'Norfolk'. It lies about
six miles W.N.W. from the end of Break Sea Spit.</p>
<p>"The first rendezvous appointed for Lieutenant Murray was the
anchorage near Sandy Cape; but the wind being unfavourable, we
did not reach it till four on the following afternoon, Friday,
30th July, at which time the anchor was dropped in seven fathoms,
sandy bottom, with the outer extremity of the Cape bearing S. 79
deg. E., and the nearest part distant two miles. A vessel was
seen on the outside of the Spit, which proved to be the 'Lady
Nelson', and the master being sent with a boat to assist her
through the passage, she anchored near us at sunset, and
Lieutenant Murray came on board. The account he gave of his
separation, and the delay in arriving at the rendezvous,
convinced me, both of the 'Lady Nelson' being an indifferent
vessel, and of the truth of an observation before made upon the
current; that it runs much stronger to the southward at the
distance of six, and from that to twenty leagues off the coast,
than it does close in with the shore.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 1st August. In the morning the wind was from the
southward, and we steered across Hervey's Bay towards a sloping
hummock on the west side, where my examination in the 'Norfolk'
had
terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
From Port Jackson to Sandy Cape, Captain Cook's positions had
been found to differ from mine not more than from 10 min. east to
7 min. west, which must be considered a great degree of accuracy,
considering the expeditious manner in which he sailed along the
coast, and that there were no timekeepers on board the
'Endeavour;' but from Sandy Cape northward, where the direction
of the coast has a good deal of westing in it, greater
differences began to show themselves.</p>
<p>"Monday, 2nd August. At daybreak we pursued our course along
shore, at the distance of four or five miles. There was no
remarkable projection till we came to the south head of Bustard
Bay, and the night being at hand we ran in and anchored.</p>
<p>"At daylight (Tuesday 3rd August), we proceeded along the
coast, but the wind being very light, were no more than abreast
of the north head of Bustard Bay at noon. This north head lies in
latitude 24 deg., as laid down by Captain Cook, and bears from
the south head N. 44 deg., W. twelve miles. It is moderately
high, and behind it is a mass of hummocky, barren hills, which
extend far to the westward.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 4th August. At noon the north head of Bustard Bay
was brought to bear S. 16 deg. E. four leagues, our latitude
being then 23 deg. 48 min., and longitude 151 deg. 40 min. A low
island was seen from the mast-head, bearing north at the supposed
distance of six leagues, of which Captain Cook does not make any
mention; and the furthest visible part of the mainland was a
conspicuous hill, named Mount Larcom, in compliment to Captain
Larcom of the navy. It bore W. ½ N. ten or eleven leagues, but
the coast line between it and the north head of Bustard Bay,
seemed to be much broken.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon a light breeze from the north-westward
enabled us to stretch in for the land, and we anchored soon after
sunset in ten fathoms, brown sand, five or six miles from a
projection which received the name of Gatcombe Head; and to the
southward of it there was rather a deep bight in the coast.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 5th August. At daylight of the 5th we closed into
the shore, steering north-westward; and at nine o'clock a small
opening was discovered, and water seen over the low front
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The opening was not so much as a mile in width, but from the
extent of water within, it was conjectured to have a
communication with the bight on the south side of Gatcombe Head;
and this being an object worthy of examination, the sails were
furled, and the boats hoisted out. The naturalist and his
companions landed at the west side of the entrance, where some
Indians had assembled to look at the ship, but they retired on
the approach of our gentlemen, and afterwards taking advantage of
a hillock began to throw stones at the party, nor would they
desist until two or three muskets were fired over their heads,
when they disappeared. There were seven bark canoes lying on the
shore, and near them hung upon a tree some parts of a turtle; and
scoop nets, such as those of Hervey's Bay, were also seen.</p>
<p>"I proceeded up the opening in a boat, went over to the west
shore, and ascended a hill called in the chart, Hill View, from
whence it was evident that this water did certainly communicate
with the bight round Gatcombe Head, and by an opening much more
considerable than that in which the vessels were anchored; the
port was also seen to extend far to the westward, and I was
induced to form a regular plan for its examination,</p>
<p>"Friday, 6th August. Early in the morning I went off in the
whale-boat, with two days' provisions, and made nearly a straight
course up the port for a low point on the south shore called
Southtrees Point. The water was very shallow, with many rocks and
dry banks, until the southern entrance was fairly open, when the
depth varied between seven and three fathoms, but there was from
six to eight close to the low point. This forms the inner part of
the southern entrance, and Gatcombe Head, the outer part, lies
from it S. 64 deg. E. about four miles; from the head southward,
however, the width of the channel is much less, being contracted
by banks which extend out from the opposite shore. Seeing nothing
of the brig, I proceeded in the examination, steering westward
for a small island four or five miles up the port. This is the
southernmost of six islets, lying behind the point of Hill View,
and from one or two hillocks upon it another set of bearings was
taken.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I went to a point on the northern shore, near two miles higher
up, where the water was so deep that a ship might make fast to
the rocks and trees; the soundings were very irregular from the
southern islet, but the least depth was five fathoms.</p>
<p>"The port was here contracted to one mile in width, but it
opened out higher up, and taking a more northerly direction,
assumed the form of a
river.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We rowed on upwards, and landed with difficulty on the west shore
before it became quite dark. The breadth of the stream here was
about a mile, and the greatest depth six fathoms at low
water.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 7th August. In the morning a small opening was
observed in the opposite eastern shore; but, reserving this for
examination on returning, I proceeded upwards, with a fair wind,
five miles further, when the greatest depth anywhere to be found
was three fathoms. The stream then divided into two arms; the
largest, about one mile in breadth, continuing its direction to
the N.W. by N., and apparently ending a little further up; the
other running westward; but the greater part of both occupied by
shallow water and mud banks. Upon the point of separation, which
is insulated at high water, there were some low, reddish cliffs,
the second observed on the west shore, and from thence I set
Mount Larcom at S. 15 deg. 15 min. W., distant seven or eight
miles.</p>
<p>"This station was nine miles above the steep point where the
port is first contracted, and the steep point is ten from
Gatcombe Head; and conceiving it could answer no essentially
useful purpose to pursue the examination where a ship could not
go, I returned to the small opening in the eastern shore,
opposite to where we had passed the night. There were four
fathoms in the entrance of this little branch, but it presently
became shallow, and I landed to ascend a hill, which had but
little wood on the top. The sea was visible from thence (Ship
Hill).</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Murray had found some difficulty in getting into
the southern entrance, from a shoal which lay to the S.E. by E.,
one mile and a-half from Gatcombe Head. He passed on the north
side of the shoal, and brought deep water as far as Southtrees
Point; but in steering onward in mid-channel, had met with other
banks, and was obliged to anchor.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 8th August. As much time had been employed in the
examination of this port as the various objects I had in view
could permit, we prepared to quit it on the following morning.
This part of ihc east coast had been passed in the night by
Captain Cook; so that both the openings escaped his notice, and
the discovery of the port fell to our lot. In honour of Admiral
Sir Roger Curtis, who had commanded at the Cape of Good Hope, and
been so attentive to our wants, I gave it the name of Port
Curtis, and the island which protects it from the sea and, in
fact, forms the port, was called 'Facing Island'. It is a slip of
rather low land, eight miles in length, and from two to
half-a-mile in breadth, having Gatcombe Head as its southern
extremity.</p>
<p>"The northern entrance to Port Curtis is accessible only to
boats, but ships of any size may enter the port by the southern
opening. There is good anchorage just within Gatcombe Head, and
at a small beach there, behind a rock, is a rill of fresh water,
and wood is easily to be procured.</p>
<p>"Monday, 9th August. On getting under way at daylight to
prosecute the examination of the coast, the anchor came up with
an arm broken oft, in consequence of a flaw extending two-thirds
through the iron. The negligence with which this anchor had been
made might, in some cases, have caused the loss of the ship.</p>
<p>"In following the low and rather sandy shore, northward to
Cape Capricorn, we passed within a rocky islet, and another
composed of rock and sand, four miles south-east of the Cape, and
at 10 o'clock hauled round for Cape Keppel, which lies from Cape
Capricorn N. 80 deg. W., ten miles. At six miles out there is a
hummocky island and four rocks, one of which was at first taken
for a ship. We passed within these, as Captain Cook before had
done; and at half-past two in the afternoon anchored in Keppel
Bay, in six fathoms, soft bottom, three-quarters of a mile from a
head on the east side of the entrance.</p>
<p>"My object in stopping at this bay was to explore two openings
marked in it by Captain Cook, which it was possible might be the
entrances of rivers leading into the interior. I landed with a
party of the gentlemen to inspect the bay from an eminence called
Sea Hill. There were four places where the water penetrated into
the land, but none of these openings were large; that on the west
side, in which were two islands, was the most considerable, and
the hills near it were sufficiently elevated to afford an
extensive view.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 10th August. The depth in steering for the western
arm was from six to nine fathoms, for about one mile, when it
diminished quickly to two, upon a shoal which seemed to run up
the bay; the water afterwards deepened to five and seven fathoms.
I then went on in my boat for the nearest of the two islands. The
two islands are mostly very low, and the shores so muddy and
covered with mangroves, that a landing on the northern and
highest of them could be effected only at the west end; but a
hillock there enabled me to take a useful set of bearings,
including Mount Larcom, which is visible from all parts of this
bay, as it is from Port Curtis.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon I proceeded up the western arm, having three
to eight fathoms close along the northern shore; and about four
miles up, where the width was diminished to one mile, found a
landing place, a rare convenience here, and ascended a hill, from
whence there was a good view. The borders of the western arm, and
of its upper branches, so far as could be perceived, were overrun
with mangroves; whence it seemed probable that the water was
salt, and that no landing was practicable higher than this
station; the sun also was near setting when my bearings from
Westarm Hill were completed; and I therefore gave up the
intention of proceeding further, and returned to the northern
island in the entrance, to pass the night.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 12th August. I went, accompanied by the naturalist,
to examine the eastern arm of the bay, which is divided into two
branches. Pursuing the easternmost and largest, with soundings
from six to three fathoms, we came to several mangrove islands,
about four miles up, where the stream changed its direction from
S.S.E. to E.S.E., and the deepest water was two fathoms. A little
further on we landed for the night, cutting a path through the
mangroves to a higher part of the northern shore.</p>
<p>"Friday, 13th August. In the morning I set Broad Mount, in
Keppel Bay, at N. 61 deg. 20 min. W., and Mount Larcom S. 8 deg.
20 min. E.; and we then steered onward in six to eight feet
water, amongst various little islands of mud and mangroves; the
whole width of the stream being still more than half-a-mile,
nearly the same as at the entrance. Three miles above the
sleeping place the water began to increase in breadth, and was
two fathoms deep; and, advancing further, it took a direction
more southward, and to our very agreeable surprise, brought us to
the head of Port Curtis, forming thus a channel of communication
from Keppel Bay, and cutting off Cape Capricorn, with a piece of
land twenty-five miles in length, from the continent. Having
found one communication, we rowed up the western branch near the
reddish cliffs, hoping to get back to Keppel Bay by a second new
passage; but after going two miles, with a diminishing depth from
four fathoms to three feet, we were stopped by mangroves, and
obliged to return to the main stream.</p>
<p>"The tide was half ebbed when we came to the shallowest part
of the communicating channel, and it was with difficulty that the
boat could be got over. A space here of about two miles in length
appears to be dry, or very nearly so, at low water, but it is
possible that some small channel may exist amongst the mangroves
of sufficient depth for a boat to pass at all times of
tide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We reached the entrance of the eastern arm from Keppel Bay with
the last of the ebb, and look the flood to go up the southern
branch. The depth of water was generally three fathoms on the
eastern side and the width nearly half-a-mile. This continued
three miles up, when a division took place. In the smallest.
which ran southward, we got one mile, and up the other, leading
south-west, two miles, when both were found to terminate in
shallows amongst mangroves.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 14th August. I left the ship again in the morning,
and went up the southern arm, to a little hill on its western
shore; this arm is one mile in width, and the depth in it from
three to six fathoms; the shores are flat, as in other parts, and
covered with mangroves; but at high water a landing was effected
under the 'South Hill' without much trouble. The sides of this
little eminence are steep, and were so thickly covered with trees
and shrubs, bound together, and intertwisted with strong vines,
that our attempts to reach the top were fruitless. It would have
been perhaps easier to climb up the trees, and scramble from one
to another on the vines, than to have penetrated through the
intricate network in the darkness
underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The small fish which leaps on land upon two strong breast fins,
and was first seen by Captain Cook on the shores of Thirsty
Sound, was very common in this swamp around South Hill. There
were also numbers of a small kind of red crab, having one of its
claws uncommonly large, being, indeed, nearly as big as the body;
and this it keeps erected and open so long as there is any
expectation of disturbance. It was curious to see a file of these
pugnacious little animals raise their claws at our approach, and
open their pincers ready for an attack; and, afterwards, finding
there was no molestation, shoulder their arms and march on.</p>
<p>"At nine in the evening, the tide brought the boat under the
hill, and allowed us to return to the ship. All the examination
of Keppel Bay, which our time could allow, was now done.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 17th August. The anchor was weighed at daylight, but
the wind being unfavourable, it took the whole day to get into
the offing.</p>
<p>"Keppel Bay was discovered by Captain Cook, who sailed past in
1770.</p>
<p>"The rocks and islands lying off Keppel Bay to the northward
arc numerous and scattered without order; two of them are of
greater magnitude than the rest, and Captain Cook had attempted
to pass between these and the main land, from which they arc
distant about five miles, but shoal water obliged him to
desist.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 18th August. When we got away in the morning of
the 18th our course was directed for the outside of these two
islands, and we passed within a mile of them in nine, and from
that to thirteen fathoms of water. They are five miles asunder,
and the southernmost and largest is near twelve in circumference.
Its rocky hills are partly covered with grass and wood, and the
gullies down the sides, as also the natives seen upon the island,
implied that fresh water was to be had there.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 19th August. At seven next morning, having a light
air from the land with foggy weather, we steered northward along
the coast, and at noon were in latitude 22 deg. 47¾ min., and two
rocks near the shore bore S. 54 deg. W., two or three miles.</p>
<p>"Friday, 20th August. At daylight we proceeded along the coast
to the island lying off Cape Manifold. ,</p>
<p>"Saturday, 21st August. The wind veering to the south-west x
five (in the morning) we stretched in for the land, and
approached somi rocky islets, part of the Harvey's Isles of
Captain Cook, of which, and of the main coast as far as Island
Head, Mr. Westall made a sketch. At half-past nine, when we
tacked from Harvey's Isles, I was surprised to see trees upon
them resembling the pines of Norfolk Island, none such having
been noticed upon this coast, nor, to my knowledge, upon any
coast of Terra Australis. Pines were also distinguished upon a
mare southern islet, four miles off, and behind it was a deep
bight in the land, where there seemed to be
shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Instead of a bight in the coast we found this to be a port of
some extent, which had not only escaped the notice of Captain
Cook, but, by the shift of wind, was very nearly being missed by
us also. I named it 'Port Bowen', in compliment to Captain James
Bowen, of the navy; and to the hilly projection on the north side
of the entrance I gave the appellation of 'Cape Clinton', after
Colonel Clinton, of the 85th, who commanded the land, as Captain
Bowen did the sea forces, at Madeira, when we stopped at that
island.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 22nd August. Early next morning set off in my
whaleboat upon an excursion round the port. From the ship to the
inner part of Cape Clinton the soundings were from five to eight
fathoms, on a sandy bottom, but close to the innermost point
there was no ground at ten fathoms. From thence I steered up the
western arm, passing to the south of a central rock lying a mile
out, and got, with difficulty, to the projection named West Water
Head. The arm terminated a little further on; but to the
northward, over the land, I saw a long shallow bay at the back of
Island Head, and beyond it was the
sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Then returned to the inner part of Cape Clinton. In rowing to the
southward, close along the inside of the cape, we had from three
to nine fathoms water; but it was too late in the evening to make
an examination of the southern arm, and I therefore ascended a
hill near the shore to inspect it. This was called 'East Water
Hill', and I saw from its top that the southern arm extended S.
16 deg. W., about seven miles, to the foot of the hills behind
Cape Manifold, when it terminated in shallows and mangroves.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 25th August. I saw not only that Cape Townshend
was in a distinct island, but also that it was separated from a
piece of land to the west, which Captain Cook's chart had left
doubtful. Wishing to follow the apparent intention of the
discoverer, to do honour to the noble family of Townshend, I have
extended the name of the Cape to the larger island. and
distinguished the western piece by the name of Leicester Island.
Besides these there were many smaller isles scattered in the
entrance of Shoalwater Bay, and the southernmost of them, named
Aken's Island, after the master of the ship, lies in a bight of
the western shore. Out at sea there were more of the
Northumberland Islands, further westward ,than those before seen,
the largest being not less distant than fifteen leagues. Pier
Head, on the west side of Thirsty Sound, was also visible; and in
the opposite direction was the highest of the two peaks behind
Cape Manifold, the bearing of which connected this station with
Port Curtis and Keppel Bay. The view was indeed, most extensive
from this hill, and in compliment to the landscape painter, who
made a drawing from thence of Shoalwater Bay and the Islands, I
named it Mount Westall." (A painting was made of this view and is
now in the Admiralty.)</p>
<p>"Sunday, 12th September. Anchored abreast of the hilly
projection on the east side, which I have named 'Upper Head', in
four fathoms, soft bottom, two-thirds of a mile from the shore,
This was the first place on the main where there was any prospect
of being able to land; for the western shore, thus far up, was
equally low, and as much overrun with mangroves and defended by
muddy flats, as the shores of Keppel
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
There was no fresh water at Upper Head.</p>
<p>"Monday, 13th September. Next morning, when the flood made, we
drifted upwards, with the 'Lady Nelson', and a boat sounding
ahead.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
After advancing three miles the brig suddenly took the ground,
and we dropped a stream anchor; but in swinging to it the ship
was caught upon a bank of quick-sand for eleven feet, and the
tide running strong upon the broadside, it made her heel in a
manner to excite alarm. The sails were immediately clewed down,
and the top-gallant yards struck;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
the best bower was let go, and then she righted and swung to the
tide. The 'Lady Nelson' also got off safe; but a part of the
after sliding keel was carried away. I went in a boat to examine
the place which had presented the appearance of an opening, but
it proved to be only a bending in the shore, and the mud banks
and mangroves did not admit of landing; we therefore went back to
Upper Head with the returning ebb; and moored the ship nearly in
our first situation; where there was something more than three
fathoms at low water.</p>
<p>"The latitude of Upper Head, from six meridian observations in
the artificial horizon, is 22 deg. 23 min. 24 sec. S., longitude
149 deg. 46 min. 53 sec. E.</p>
<p>"It may be proper to say what I conceive to be the
extraordinary rise of the tide in Broad sound. From Cape Howe, at
the southern extremity of the east coast, to Port Curtis at the
edge of the tropic, the time of high water falls between seven
and nine hours after the moon's passage, and the rise does not
exceed nine feet, but from thence to the northward, commencing
with Keppel Bay, the time becomes later, and the rise augments
till at Broadsound they reach eleven hours, and between thirty
and thirty-five feet. The principal flood-tide upon the coast is
supposed to come from the south-east, and the ebb from the north
or north-west; but from the particular formation of Keppel and
Shoalwater Bays, and of Broadsound, whose entrances face the
north or north-west, this ebb tide sets into them, and
accumulates the water for some time, becoming to them a flood.
This will, in some degree, account for the later time and greater
rise of the tide, and is conformable to what Captain Cook says
upon the subject; * but I think there is still a super-adding
cause. At the distance of about thirty leagues to the N.N.W. from
Break Sea Spit, commences a vast mass of reefs, which lie from
twenty to thirty leagues from the coast, and extend past
Broadsound. These reefs, being mostly dry at low water, will
impede the free access of the tide, and the greater proportion of
it will come in between Break Sea Spit and the reefs, and be late
in reaching the remoter parts; and if we suppose the reefs to
terminate to the north or north-west of the Sound, or that a
large opening in them there exists, another flood-tide will come
from the northward, and meet the former, and the accumulation of
water from this meeting will cause an extraordinary rise in
Broadsound and the neighbouring bays, in the same manner as the
meeting of the tides in the English and Irish Channels causes a
great rise upon the north coast of France and the west coast of
England.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Hawkesworth, III., 244.]</p>
<p>"That an opening exists in these reefs will hereafter appear;
and Captain Cook's observations prove that for more than a degree
to the north-west of Broadsound the flood came from the
northward. I found, when at anchor off Keppel Bay, and again off
Island Head, that the flood there came from the east or
south-east; but when lying three miles out from Pier Head, there
was no set whatever, and I am disposed to think that it is at the
entrance to Broadsound where the two floods meet each other.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 28th September. On quitting Broadsound, we steered
for the north-easternmost of the Northumberland Islands, which I
intended to visit on the way to Torres Straits. These arc not
otherwise marked by Captain Cook than as a single piece of land
seen indistinctly, of three leagues in extent; but I had already
descried from Mount Westall and Pier Head a cluster of islands,
forming a distinct portion of this archipelago; and in honour to
the noble house to which Northumberland gives the title of Duke,
I named them Percy Isles.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 30th September. Mount Westall (not distinct) S. 23
deg. 5 min. E.; Northumberland Islands, the fourth, a peak, S. 18
deg.</p>
<p>20 min. E.; Northumberland Islands, the seventh, the station
on the hill, S. 19 deg. 30 min. W.; Northumberland Islands, a
peak I marked, 'N', N. 87 deg. 35 min. W.; Northumberland
Islands, high northernmost, marked 'I', N. 57 deg. W.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 3rd October. Mr. Bauer, the natural history painter,
went with me to the northern Percy Isles, upon each of which is a
hill somewhat peaked; but that on number three is much the most
so, and the highest; and being thickly covered with pine trees,
is called 'Pine Peak'; it lies in 21 deg. 31½ min. S., and 150
deg. 14½ E. My principal object was to take angles for the
survey; and not being able to ascend 'Pine Peak', from its great
declivity, we went onward to the two smaller islands, number
four.</p>
<p>"Monday, 4th October. Early in the morning we got under way,
with the 'Lady Nelson' in company, to proceed on our voyage to
Torres Straits and the Gulf of
Carpentaria.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Passed between number four and some rocks lying two miles to the
north-east, with thirty-three fathoms water. During the night we
tacked every two hours, working to the eastward, in from thirty
to thirty-six fathoms, and at six p.m. anchored in twenty-seven
fathoms, coarse sand, in the following situation:&mdash;Latitude
observed from the moon, 21 deg. 4 min. S.; longitude from
bearings, 150 deg. 19 min. E.; Percy Isles, Pine Peak, of No. 3,
S. 7 deg. W.; Cumberland Island, marked 'K', W. 6 deg. N.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 5th October. At daylight my station on the Eastern
Isle, number 4, bore N. 89 deg. W. four leagues. Nothing was seen
in the offing, but in stretching to the N.N.E. reefs were
discovered from the mast-head a little before noon, and after the
observation for the latitude was taken, I set one bearing east to
E. by S. two leagues, and another N, 14 deg. W. to 29 deg. E.
four or five miles. Our situation was in 21 deg. 15&#8532; min.
S., and longitude, from the bearings of the Pine Peak, 154 deg.
34 min. E. These reefs were not exactly those seen by Mr.
Campbell"&mdash;[of the brig "Deptford", in 1797]&mdash;"but they
are probably not more than five or six leagues to the
north-westward of them, and form part of the same barrier to the
coast. At six, anchored in 27 fathoms."</p>
<p>Captain Flinders continued his search for a passage through
these barrier reefs during the 6th, 7th, and 8th October, and on
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 9th October. In the morning, steered E.N.E., with a
light air from the southward. The brig was ahead, and at
half-past nine made the signal for immediate danger, upon which
the stern anchor was dropped in sixteen
fathom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"The latitude observed to the north and south at this fifth
anchorage amongst the reefs" was 20 deg. 53 min. 15 sec.
longitude, by timekeeper, 151 deg. 5 min. E. In the afternoon I
went upon the reef with a party of the gentlemen, and the water
being very clear round the edges, a new creation, as it was to
us, but imitative of the old, was there presented to our view. We
had wheat sheaves, mushrooms, stag's horns, cabbage leaves, and a
variety of other forms, glowing under water with vivid tints of
every shade betwixt green, purple, brown, and white, equalling in
beauty and excelling in grandeur the most favourite parterre of
the curious florist. These were different species of coral or
fungus, growing, as it were, out of the solid rock, and each had
its peculiar form and shade of colouring; but whilst
contemplating the richness of the scene, we could not long forget
with what destruction it was pregnant.</p>
<p>"Different shells in a dead state, concreted into a solid mass
of a dull white colour, composed the stone of the reef. The negro
heads were lumps which stood higher than the rest; and being
generally dry, were blackened by the weather; but even in these,
the forms of the different corals, and some shells were
distinguishable. The edges of the reef, but particularly on the
outside where the sea broke, were the highest parts; within there
were pools and holes containing live corals, sponges and sea
eggs, and cucumbers; * and many enormous cockles (<i>chama
gigas</i>) were scattered upon different parts of the reef. At
low water, this cockle seems most commonly to lie half open, but
frequently closes with much noise; and the water within the
shells then spouts up in a stream, three or four feet high: it
was from this noise, and the spouting of the water, that we
discovered them, for in other respects they were scarcely to be
distinguished from the coral rock. A number of these cockles were
taken on board the ship, and stewed in the coppers; but they were
too rank to be agreeable food, and were eaten by few. One of them
weighed 47½ lbs. when taken up, and contained 3 lbs. 2 oz. of
meat; but the size is much inferior to what was found by Captains
Cook and Bligh, upon the reefs of the coast further northward, or
to several in the British Museum; and I have since seen single
shells more than four times the weight of the above shells and
fish taken together.</p>
<p class="foot">[* What we called sea cucumbers, from their
shape, appears to have been the bêche-de-mer or trepang, of which
the Chinese make a soup, much esteemed in that country for its
invigorating qualities.]</p>
<p>"There were various small channels amongst the reefs, some of
which led to the outer breakers, and through these the tide was
rushing in when we returned to the ship; but I could not anywhere
see an opening sufficiently wide for the vessels.</p>
<p>"The loss of anchors we had this day sustained, deterred me
from any more attempting the small passages through the Barrier
Reef: in these, the tide runs with extraordinary violence, and
the bottom is coral rock, and whether with or without wind no
situation can he more dangerous. My anxious desire to get out to
sea, and reach the north coast before the unfavourable monsoon
should set in, had led me to persevere amongst these intricate
passages beyond what prudence could approve, for had the wind
come to blow strongly, no anchors, in such deep water and upon
loose sand, could have held the ship; a rocky bottom cut the
cables: and to have been under sail in the night was certain
destruction.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 12 October. Our latitude at this tenth anchorage
amongst the reefs was 20 deg. 53 min. 10 sec.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 17th October. Our latitude here (at anchor in the
evening), by an observation of the moon, was 20 deg. 10 min. S.,
and now, hoping we should not meet with any more interruption
from the reefs, I resolved to send the brig back to Port Jackson.
On Monday I wrote to His Excellency Governor King an account of
our proceedings and discoveries upon the east coast, and
requested a new boat might be built against our return to Port
Jackson, and that the brig should be repaired and equipped ready
to accompany me in the following year.</p>
<p>"At nine o'clock we got under way, and showed our colours to
bid farewell to the 'Lady Nelson'.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 19th October. The latitude at noon was 19 deg. 35
min. 15 sec., and longitude, by timekeeper, 148 deg. 475 min.
Four reefs then extended from E. by S. to N.W. by W., at the
distance of two to five miles. The northern Cumberland Island
bore S. 9 deg. E., and the outer of two hills, which I judged to
be upon Cape Gloucester S. 39½ deg. W.</p>
<p>"At
sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Holborne Island bore S. by W. from the mast-head, and no breakers
were in sight. This tack was prolonged under treble-reefed
top-sails till ten o'clock, when a light was seen bearing S. by
E. ½ E., probably upon the isle, and we stood to the northward.
The wind blew fresh from the eastward all night, and raised a
short swell which tried the ship more than anything we had
encountered from the time of leaving Port Jackson; and, I was
sorry to find, brought on the former leakiness, to the amount of
five inches of water per hour.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 20th October. Holborne Isle was seen bearing S. 6
deg. W., four or five leagues at daylight. At noon, the latitude
was 19 deg. 8 min. 15 sec., and longitude, by timekeeper, 147
deg. 57 min. east At six, a heavy swell from the eastward, and a
depth of sixty-six fathoms were strong assurances that we had at
length gained the open sea.</p>
<p>"The topsails were then treble reefed, and we hauled to the
wind, which blew strong at E.S.E., with squally weather. At
eight, hove to and sounded: no ground with seventy-five fathoms:
and at twelve, none with one hundred and fifteen.</p>
<p>"Our latitude was 17 deg. 54 min., longitude 148 deg. 37 min.,
and at the depth of one hundred fathoms there was no ground, the
variation observed in the morning, with three Azimuth compasses,
was 6 deg. 8 min. east, corrected to the meridian. Another reef
was discovered at two o'clock, lying nearly three leagues to the
northward of the former; but although there were many boobies,
and tropic, and man-of-war birds about, no more dangers had been
descried at dusk; nor did we see any more until approaching
Torres Straits.</p>
<p>"I shall conclude with some general remarks on the reefs,
which form so extraordinary a barrier to this part of New South
Wales; and amongst which we sought fourteen days, and sailed more
than five hundred miles, before a passage could be found through
them, out to sea.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 28th October. At day break bore away again on our
north-western course, and at noon our latitude was 9 deg. 51 min.
36 sec., and longitude 145 deg. 45½ min., by timekeeper. No reefs
were then in sight, but, in steering west, we passed through a
rippling tide or current, and a single breaker was seen from the
mast-head, at three o'clock, bearing S.W. four or five miles.</p>
<p>"These reefs lie nearly a degree to the eastward of those
first seen by Captains Edwards and Bligh when entering Torres
Strait, for the north-eastern extreme lies in 10 deg. 2 min. S.,
and 145 deg. 45 min.
east.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
In the belief that this was the first discovery of these coral
banks, I called them Eastern Fields, intending thereby to
designate their position with respect to other reefs of Torres
Strait.</p>
<p>"Our latitude at noon was exactly that of the opening by which
Captain Edwards, of the 'Pandora', had entered the strait in
1791; and which I call the 'Pandora's Entrance'. This opening
appeared to be preferable to that further northward, by which
Captain Bligh and Mr. Bampton had got within the reefs; more
especially as it led directly for Murray's Islands, where, if
possible, I intended to anchor.</p>
<p>"Friday, 29th October. Finding by the latitude that we had
been set considerably to the north, and were out of the parallel
of Murray's Islands, I tacked to the S.S.W., and at two o'clock
the largest island was seen bearing S. 38 deg. W., about five
leagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At half-past five the largest island bore S. 36 deg. E. to 28
deg. W., one mile and a half; and there being more reefs coming
in sight to the westward, the anchor was immediately let go in
twenty fathoms, coarse sand and shells. The north and east sides
of the island are surrounded by a
reef.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
A number of poles, standing up in various places, more especially
between the islands, appeared at a distance like the masts of
canoes .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. but on approaching nearer the poles
were found to be upon the reefs, and were probably set up for
some purpose connected with fishing, we had scarcely anchored
when between forty and fifty Indians came off in three
canoes.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 30th October. Murray's largest island is nearly two
miles long, by something more than one in breadth. On the shores
of the large islands were many huts, surrounded by palisades,
apparently of bamboo. Cocoa-nut trees were abundant, both on the
low grounds and the sides of the hills, and plantains, with some
other fruits, had been brought to us. There were many Indians
sitting in groups upon the shore, and the seven canoes which came
off to the ship in the morning contained from ten to twenty men
each, or together, about a hundred.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The latitude of the highest hill, deduced from that of the ship
at the following noon, is 9 deg. 54 min. S., and longitude, by
the timekeeper, 144 deg. 2 min. E., being 3 min. N. and 20 min.
E. of its position by Captain Edwards.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 31st October. At daylight the south-east trade blew
fresh, with squally weather. We steered
south-westward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our latitude at noon was 10 deg. 26 min. 45 sec., and our
longitude 142 deg. 39½ min.; and we had high land bearing S. 3
deg. E.&mdash;ten or twelve miles which I supposed might be the
easternmost of the York Isles, although Captain Cook's longitude
of it was thirty-eight deg. more
westward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Anchored in seven fathoms, gravel and shells, one mile and a-half
from the
land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our latitude here was 10 deg. 30 min. from bearings, and
longitude from time keeper 142 deg. 18½ min. E., but I was
altogether at a loss to know what islands these were, under which
we had anchored. Supposing the flat-topped island to have been
the easternmost York Isle, the land we had in sight to the
southward should have been Cape York; but no such isles as those
around us were laid down by Captain Cook to the north of that
Cape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
It appeared that the first land was not the easternmost isle, but
one much nearer Cape York, and that our anchorage was under the
southern group of Trince of Wales Islands, the longitude of
which, by Captain Cook, is twelve min. W. of what I make it. The
north-eastern isle of this group. under which we more immediately
lay, is that named Wednesday Island by Captain Bligh; to the
other isles he gave no name; but the one westward of the ship
seems to have been Hammond's Island of Captain Edwards.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 2nd November. In the morning, the wind being more
moderate and at E.S.E., we steered between Hammond's Island and
the north-western reef, with soundings from six to nine fathoms.
Another island appeared beyond Hammond's to the south-west,
which, as it had no name, I called 'Good's Island', after Mr.
Good, the botanical gardener; and we hauled up for it, passing a
rock and a small reef between the two. The botanical gentlemen
landed on Good's Island; and in the afternoon I took these
bearings, amongst others, from a hill near its south-west
end:</p>
<p>"Wallis Isles, over the Shoal Cape of Bligh, S. 23 deg. 5 min.
W. , Booby Isle, centre, S. 80 deg. W.</p>
<p>"It was now ascertained that the figures resembling sentry
boxes (seen on Wednesday Isle, on the 1st) were ant hills, of
eight or more feet high. Pelsert found similar hills on the west
coast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The correct latitude (of this anchorage, near Good's Island) is
taken to be 10 deg. 32 min. 58
sec.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The longitude by the corrected timekeeper
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
was 142 deg. 10½ min. east.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 3rd November. In the morning the wind was moderate
at E.S.E., and we made sail to get in with the main land to the
south of the Prince of Wales
Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Noon; the latitude was then 10 deg. 50 min. 44 sec., and the
bearings of the land were these:</p>
<p>"Station on Good's Island, N. 29½ deg. E.; Cape Cornwall, N.
68 deg. E.; Wallis Island, the highest, distant two and a-half
miles, N. 84 deg. E.; mainland, low, sandy point, distant eight
miles, S. 43 deg. E.</p>
<p>"Between Cape Cornwall and the low land above set, is the
opening called in the old Dutch charts Speult's river; but which
Captain Cook, who sailed through it, named Endeavour's
Strait.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We passed Wallis Isles, steering southward to get in with the
main coast; but the shoals forced us to near seven or eight miles
to the west, out of sight of land, before regular soundings could
be obtained, and a southern course steered into the Gulf of
Carpentaria. At dusk, the anchor was dropped in eight fathoms,
soft mud, in latitude 11 deg. 5 min., as observed from the moon
to the north and south, and longitude 141 deg. 51 min. by
timekeeper.</p>
<p>"I now considered all the difficulties of Torres Strait to be
surmounted since we had got a fair entry into the Gulf of
Carpentaria; and to have accomplished this before the north-west
monsoon had made any strong indications was a source of much
satisfaction after the unexpected delay amongst the Barrier Reefs
on the east coast.</p>
<p>"Monday, 8th November. A breeze came off the land at night as
usual, and the weather was dark and squally. Early in the morning
we steered along the coast with good soundings&mdash;ten and nine
fathoms, muddy bottom. A sandy point with two hillocks on it,
which had been the extreme of the preceding evening, was passed
at ten o'clock, and, seeing a large bight round it, we tacked to
work
up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This point is one of the very few remarkable projections to be
found on this low coast, but it is not noticed in the Dutch
chart. There was little doubt, however, that it was seen in 1606,
in the yacht 'Duyphen', the first vessel which discovered any
part of the Gulph of Carpentaria; and, that the remembrance may
not be lost, I gave the name of the vessel to the point. Our
observation placed the extreme of Duyphen Point in 12 deg. 35
min. S., and 141 deg. 42 min. E.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 9th November. In the morning I set the west extreme
of Duyphen Point at N. 9 deg. E., and the farthest land in the
opposite direction at S. 9 deg. E. This last forms the south side
of the large bight, and besides projecting beyond the coast line,
and being a little higher than usual, is remarkable for having
some reddish cliffs in it and deep water near the shore. It is
not noticed in the Dutch chart, but I called it Pera Head, to
preserve the name of the second vessel which, in 1623, sailed
along this coast.</p>
<p>"Friday, 12th November. At seven o'clock we passed an opening
near which several natives were collected. The opening seemed to
be a full mile in width, but a spit from the south side runs so
far across, that there is probably no access to it, unless for
rowing boats: its latitude is 15 deg. 12 min. S., corresponding
with a bight in the Dutch chart to the south of the second 'Water
Plaets'.* The latitude at noon was 15 deg. 25 min. 20 sec., and
longitude 141 deg. 32 min.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The mouth of the Mitchell
river.&mdash;(Leichhardt.)]</p>
<p>"Saturday, 13th November. At six in the morning, being then
four miles off the land, and steering S.S.W., a lagoon was seen
from the masthead, over the front beach. It has doubtless some
connection with the sea, either by a constant or a temporary
opening, but none such could be perceived. The latitude, 15 deg.
53 min., corresponds with that of 'Nassau river' in the old
chart; and from the examples already had of the Dutch rivers
here, it seems probable that this lagoon was meant. A few miles
further south, the shoal water obliged me to run westward, out of
sight of land from the deck; and even at the mast-head, the tops
of the trees were only partly distinguished; yet the depth was no
more than from four to six fathoms. At noon, when our latitude
was 16 deg. 24 min. 29 sec., and longitude 141 deg. 14½ min.,
trees were visible from the deck at N. 70 deg. E., and from
thence to S. 50 deg. E., the nearest part, whence a smoke arose,
being distant seven or eight miles, and the depth of water four
fathoms. The slight projection here is probably one of those
marked in the old chart on each side of Staten river; but where
that river can be found I know not.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 14th November. At noon the latitude was 17 deg. 3
min. 16 sec., longitude 141 deg. 0 min.; a projecting part bore
N. 59 deg. E. three or four miles, and the depth was three and
a-half fathoms. There appeared to be a small opening on the south
side of this little projection, which corresponds in latitude to
Van Dieman's river ** in the old chart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.If
this place had any title to be called a river in 1644, the coast
must have undergone a great alteration since that time.</p>
<p class="foot">[** One of the inlets of the Gilbert, high up
which Gilbert was killed.]</p>
<p>"In the afternoon our course along shore was more westward;
and this, with the increasing shallowness of the water, made me
apprehend that the gulph would be found to terminate nearly as
represented in the old charts, and disappoint the hopes formed of
a strait or passage leading out at some other part of Terra
Australis.</p>
<p>"At four o'clock, after running more than an hour in three and
a half fathoms, or less than three at low water, our distance
from the shore was five miles; and a small opening then bore S.
14 deg. E., which seems to be the Caron river, marked at the
south-east extremity of the gulph in the Dutch chart; but
whatever it might have been in Tasman's time, no navigator would
now think of attempting to enter it with a ship. The latitude is
17 deg. 26 min., and longitude 140 deg. 52 min. east.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 17th November. In the morning a fresh land wind at
south-east favoured our course, the water deepened to ten
fathoms, and at eight o'clock to no ground with thirteen, near
the south end of a reef extending out from the hill. On coming
into five fathoms behind the reef the anchor was dropped on a
muddy bottom, with the hill bearing N. 15 deg. E., one mile and a
quarter, and the dry extremity of the reef S.E. ½ E. The hill
proved to be a mass of calcareous rock. It was the highest land
we had seen in Carpentaria, after having followed one hundred and
seventy-five leagues of coast; nor was any land to be
distinguished from the top of the hill, which had an equal degree
of elevation; yet it did not much exceed the height of the ship's
mast-head. The land round it proved to be an island of live miles
long, separated from other land to the west by a channel of
nearly two miles in width. This wide opening between this land
and the low coast to the southward, I take to have been what is
called Maatsuyker's river in the old chart. Maatsuyker was one of
the Councillors at Batavia, who signed Tasman's instructions in
1664; but as there is no river
here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I would have followed in the intention of doing him honour, by
transferring his name to the island, but Maatsuyker's Isles
already exist on the south coast of Van Dieman's Land; I
therefore adopt the name of Sweers, another member of the same
Batavia Council, and call the island at the entrance of the
supposed river, Sweers Island. The hill obtained the name of
Inspection Hill, and after taking bearings from it, I rowed into
the channel which separates Sweers Island from the western
land.</p>
<p>"Friday, 19th November. This land proved to be an island of
ten or eleven miles long, and I have given it the name of
Bentinck, in honour of the Right Hon. Lord William Bentinck. To
the north-west of Bentinck's Island several small isles came in
sight, .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp; the main being four
miles distant, and the eastern extreme of the nearest island,
bearing N. 3 deg. W. two leagues, was named Allen's Isle, after
the practical miner of the expedition.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 20th November. In the morning we steered towards
Allen's
Isle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Our latitude here was 17 deg. 5 min., longitude 139 deg. 26
min.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Went eastward to a smaller island two miles off, where several
Indians were
perceived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The tallest Indians I had ever seen
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
two brothers being from three to four inches higher than my
coxswain, who measured five feet
eleven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This low piece of land is between one and two miles long, and,
from its form, received the name of Horseshoe Island.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 21 st November. At daylight the anchor was
weighed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At dusk in the evening we anchored half a mile from the west
sandy point of Sweers Island, in five fathoms. This anchorage
between the two islands, though it may not be called a port, is
yet almost equally well sheltered, and I named it Investigator's
Road.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 23rd November. The ship was removed to within two
cables length of the west point, nearer to the spring"&mdash;[of
fresh water found there]&mdash;"and Lieutenant Fowler was
established on shore with a party of seamen and marines, taking
tents, a seine, and other necessaries for watering the ship and
supplying us with fish. The carpenters proceeded in their work of
caulking, but as they advanced report after report was brought to
me of rotten places found in different parts of the ship
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
until it became quite alarming. I therefore directed the master
and carpenter to make a regular
examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
After two days' examination their report was made.</p>
<p>"Friday, 26th November. I cannot express the surprise and
sorrow which this statement gave me. According to it a return to
Port Jackson was almost immediately necessary, as well to secure
the journals and charts of the examinations already made, as to
preserve the lives of the ship's company; and my hopes of
ascertaining completely the exterior form of this immense, and in
many points, interesting country, if not destroyed would at least
be deferred to an uncertain period. My leading object had
hitherto been to make so accurate an investigation of the shores
of Terra Australis that no future voyage to this country should
be necessary. And with this always in view, I had ever
endeavoured to follow the land so closely that the washing of the
surf upon it should be visible, and no opening nor anything of
interest escape notice; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. but
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. with such a ship I knew not how to
accomplish the task. A passage to Port Jackson at this time
presented no common difficulties. In proceeding by the west the
unfavourable monsoon was likely to prove an obstacle not to be
surmounted, and in returning by the east stormy weather was to be
expected in Torres Strait, a place where the multiplied dangers
caused such an addition to be peculiarly dreaded. These
considerations, with a strong desire to finish, if possible, the
examination of the Guph of Carpentaria, fixed my resolution to
proceed as before in the survey during the continuance of the
north-west monsoon, and when the fair wind should come, to
proceed by the west to Port Jackson, if the ship should prove
capable of a winter's passage along the south coast, and if not,
to make for the nearest port in the East Indies.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 28th November. By the 28th the watering and wooding
of the ship were completed, the gunner had dried all his powder
in the sun, and the tents and people brought on board.</p>
<p>"Friday, 3rd December. Saw a small island two leagues out, one
of three laid down in the old chart near Cape Van Dieman, it is
thickly covered with wood, principally of that softish, white
kind, whence it obtained the name of 'Isle Pisonia'.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 4th December. Two boats went to bring off the
officer and people with, what had been caught; but their success
had been so great, that it was found necessary to hoist out the
launch, and it took nearly the whole day to get on board what the
decks and hold could contain, without impediment to the working
of the ship. They were found by Mr. Browne to be nearly similar
to, but not exactly, the true green turtle, and, he thought,
might be an undescribed species. We contrived to stow away
forty-six, the least of them weighing two hundred and fifty
pounds, and the average about three hundred pounds; besides which
many were returned on shore and suffered to go away. This
'Bountiful Island', for so I termed it, is near three miles long,
and generally low and
sandy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The latitude of our anchorage, one mile from the south-east side
of Bountiful Island, was 16 deg. 41 min. south; 139 deg. 59½ min.
east.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 5th December, We quitted Bountiful Island to resume
our examination of Cape Van Dieman.</p>
<p>"No doubt remained that the land of Cape Van Dieman was an
island; its extent is considerable, being thirty-five miles long,
and the circumference near ninety. It may in some parts reach
three hundred feet in height. I have taken this opportunity of
indulging my gratitude to a nobleman, who, when Governor-General
of British India, humanely used his efforts to relieve me from an
imprisonment which was superadded to a shipwreck in the voyage.
This large island is therefore distinguished by the name of Isle
Mornington; and to the whole group, now discovered to exist at
the head of the Gulph of Carpentaria, I have given the name of
Wellesley Islands.</p>
<p>"Friday, 10th December. At sunset, a hillock upon a projecting
point bore N. 73 deg. W. four miles, and behind it was a small
opening which answered in situation to the river Van Alphen of
the old chart.</p>
<p>"Monday, 13th December. At noon our situation was in latitude
15 deg. 50 min. 31 sec., longitude 137 deg. 190 min. Worked
northward, anchoring at dusk, two or three miles from the east
point of the northern land. There was no appearance of the
northern land being connected with the mainland; and I therefore
called the separated piece Vanderlin's Island.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 14th December. The north point of the island, which
is the true Cape Vanderlin, bore N. 71 deg., W., and was distant
three or four miles: its utmost extremity lies in 15 deg. 34½
min. S., and 137 deg. 8½ min. E.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 15th December. Were obliged to make a long stretch
to sea before Cape Vanderlin could be weathered, Anchored at dusk
under the easternmost of the two small islands in the offing.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 16th December. I landed early to take bearings, and
amongst them set the craggy north end of the western island,
which I call Cape Pellew, at S., 87 deg. W., distant three or
four miles. It lies in latitude 15 deg. 30½ min., longitude 137
deg. 2
min.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Lieutenant Flinders went to commence a series of observations for
the rate of the timekeepers on the small isle, thence called
Observation Island. My attention was attracted by a cove in the
western shore, upon the borders of which, more abundantly than
elsewhere, grew a small kind of cabbage palm, from whence it was
called Cabbage-tree Cove. This presented the appearance of a
complete little
harbour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>"Friday, 17th December. From the furthest part of the western
island visible from the ship, I found the shore trending S. 73
deg. W. to a point where there was an opening out to the
westward, of a mile and a-half wide and of considerable depth.
About three leagues up the opening were two craggy islands; and
beyond them was a more extensive land, which proved to be an
island also, and from its situation in this group was called
'West Island'. The island whose north end is Cape Pellew, and
whose southern extremity I had now reached, was called 'North
Island'; and the land opposite to me which formed the south side
of the opening and seemed to be extensive, is marked with the
name of 'Centre Island' in the chart.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 19th December. In the morning the weather cleared and
I took the ship over to Cape Vanderlin.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 26th December. In compliment to a distinguished
officer of the British navy, whose earnest endeavours to relieve
me from oppression in a subsequent part of the voyage, demand my
gratitude, I have called this cluster of islands 'Sir Edward
Pellew's Group'.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 29th December. The latitude was then 15 deg. 7
min., longitude 135 deg. 40 min., and we tacked towards the land,
which was not in sight from the mast-head.</p>
<p>"Friday, 31st December. Nine or ten leagues from the west, two
small humps were then seen, bearing S. 53 deg. and 59 deg. W.,
and at the mast-head they were perceived to join, and apparently
to form an island. On the wind veering to the south and eastward,
we steered for it, and before sunset got to an anchor in a small
bay on its south side, in four
fathoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
A similar error to that at the Capes Van Dieman and Vanderlin has
been made here in the Dutch chart, this island being represented
as a projection from the main land, and called Cape Maria. To the
west of it is marked a large bay or bight, called Limmen's Bogt,
where the coast turns north-eastward to a projecting cape without
name, which has a shoal, forty miles in length, running out from
it.</p>
<p>"Saturday, January 1st, 1803. Early in the morning I
landed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The length of the island is about seven miles, N.E. and S.W., by
a variable breadth from one to four miles, and its northern
extremity, to which I continue the name of Cape Maria, lies in 14
deg. 50 min. S., and 135 deg. 53½ E.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 4th January. In the morning our course was continued
to the northward, leaving extensive land, which I supposed to be
Groote Eylandt of the old charts, six or eight leagues on the
starboard hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At seven we edged in for the coast, and, coming into three and
a-half fathoms, dropped the anchor on a bottom of blue mud,
within a mile of the shore. No part of Groote Eylandt was in
sight, but an island of considerable extent and elevation not
noticed in the old chart lay six or seven miles to the E.N.E.,
and I have called it 'Bickerton's Island', in compliment to
Admiral Sir Richard
Bickerton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I took the whale-boat to a woody islet, five miles off, close to
Bickerton's Island, A meridian observation from north and south,
placed the islet in latitude 13 deg. 48 min. 30 sec., and the
points of the opening to the northward bore N. 18 deg. E. and N.
2½ deg. W. This last was the furthest visible part of the
mainland, and, proving afterwards to be a projecting cape, I
named it 'Cape Barrow', after John Barrow, Esq., author of the
interesting travels at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 5th January. In the morning we got under way and
steered eastward for Groote Eylandt, which I now intended to
circumnavigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Between the nearest parts of Groote and Bickerton's islands is a
space of eight miles, which seemed to offer a perfectly safe
passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Nor can the rather high and woody isle which lies almost exactly
in the middle of the opening be considered as presenting any
obstacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I call it 'Connexion Island' because my survey round Groote
Eylandt was connected by its
means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The centre of Connexion Island lies in 13 deg. 50½ min. S., and
the longitude .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; would be 136 deg.
27 min., .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; but 136 deg. 24¼ min.
E. should be more correct. Our distance from the west side of
Groote Eylandt, at four o'clock, was not quite three miles, and
we then bore away southward along the shore
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
At the northernmost end of Groote Eylandt is a bluff head, the
termination that way of a range of woody hills from the interior,
of which the highest is what was set under the name of Central
Hill.</p>
<p>"Sunday, 9th January. In the afternoon of the 9th we passed
round the south-east rocky point of Groote Eylandt, which lies in
14 deg. 17 min. S., and 137 deg. 2½ min. E.</p>
<p>"Monday, 10th January. With the north-east point of Groote
Eylandt bearing N. 33 deg. W., about seven miles; further out lay
two small islands, and a hill upon the outermost was set at N. 10
deg. W. The latitude of this anchorage was ascertained to be 13
deg. 53&#8531; min. south.</p>
<p>"Friday, 14th January. On the wind dying away, we anchored;
the outer North-point Islet, which lies in 13 deg. 37 min. south,
and 136 deg. 45 min. east, then bore E. 3 deg. S. five miles, and
the furthest extreme of a higher cliffy island, S. 38 deg. W.
three miles. This was called Chasm Island; it lies one mile and
a-half from a low point of Groote Eylandt, where the shore trends
southward and seemed to form a bay, into which I proposed to
conduct the ship. We found upon Chasm Island a fruit which proved
to be a new species of <i>eugenia</i> of the size of an apple,
whose acidity of taste was agreeable; there were many bushes
covered with nutmegs similar to those seen at Cape Vanderlin, and
in some of the chasms the ground was covered with this fruit,
without our being able for some time to know whence it came.
Several trees shot up in these chasms, thirty or forty feet high,
and on considering them attentively these were found to be the
trees whence the nutmegs had fallen; thus, what was a spreading
bush above, became, from the necessity of air and light, a tall,
slender tree. The fruit was small and not of an agreeable
flavour; nor is it probable that it can at all come in
competition with the nutmeg of the Molucca Islands. In the steep
sides of the chasms were deep holes or caverns, undermining the
cliffs, upon the walls of which I found rude drawings, made with
charcoal and something like red paint upon the white ground of
the rock. These drawings represented porpoises, turtles,
kanguroos, and a human hand, and Mr. Westall, who went afterwards
to see them, found the representation of a kanguroo, with a file
of thirty-two persons following after it. The third person of the
band was twice the height of the others, and held in his hand
something resembling the 'whaddie', or wooden sword of the
natives of Port Jackson. The situation of this bay in Groote
Eylandt led me to give it the name of North-west Bay. It is
formed on the east and south by that island, and on the west by a
separate piece of land five or six miles long, which, in honour
of the noble possessor of Burley Park, in the county of Rutland,
I named Winchelsea Island; and a small isle of greater elevation,
lying a short mile to the east of the ship, was called Finch's
Island.</p>
<p>"Friday, 18th January. In the morning we lay up south-west on
the starboard tack, and weathered the island, having a rock one
mile and a-half on the other side. I wished, by a good bearing of
Connexion Island, to join the survey completely round Groote
Eylandt, and at nine o'clock it was set at S. 27½ deg. to 47 deg.
W. two leagues. The wind then came ahead, and we tacked towards
two small isles, where the anchor was dropped at ten in sixteen
fathoms, sand and shells. Our latitude here was 13 deg. 43 min.
42 sec. S., and the east side of Connexion Island bore S. 9½ deg.
W., six or seven
miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I went immediately to the northern and largest of the two sandy
isles, and after observing the latitude, 13 deg. 42 min. 17 sec.,
or the south-west point, ascended the highest hillock, which,
from the clumps of trees upon it, was called 'Pandanus Hill'.
Some of the trees being cut down, I had a tolerably extensive
view of points and islands before passed, and saw more to the
north-westward behind Wedge Rock, all of which the Dutch charts
represent as parts of the mainland. One of these I have called
'Burney's Island', in compliment to Captain James Burney, of the
navy, and another 'Nicol's Island', after his Majesty's
bookseller, the publisher of this work. Beyond this was a more
extensive land, which also proved to be an island, and its form
having some resemblance to the whaddie, or woodah, or wooden
sword used by the natives of Port Jackson, it was named 'Isle
Woodah'." (Did Captain Flinders know the use of the
boomerang?)</p>
<p>"Thursday, 20th January. The mainland was in sight to the
westward forming a large bay with Isle Woodah, and Bickerton's
Island covered the entrance, so that the ship was in complete
shelter. On landing I ascended a hummock at the east end of the
island, where alone the view was not impeded by wood. Many of my
former fixed points were visible from thence, and the mainland
was traced round to northward to a hill named 'Mount Grindall',
near which was another round hill upon an island.</p>
<p>"Friday, 21st January. Thomas Morgan, a marine, having been
some time exposed bare-headed to the sun, was struck with a
<i>coup de soleil</i>; he was brought on board
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
and died in a state of frenzy the same night.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 22nd January. The body of Thomas Morgan, who died
so unfortunately, was this day committed to the deep with the
usual ceremony; and the island was named after him, 'Morgan's
Island'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The latitude of the hummock at the east end of Morgan's Island,
13 deg. 27½ min., and longitude from the survey, 136 deg. 9½ min.
Came to an anchor. The bottom here, and in most other parts of
the bay, is a blue mud of so fine a quality that I judge it might
be useful in the manufactory of earthenware; and I thence named
this 'Blue Mud Bay'.</p>
<p>"Tuesday, 25th January. After clearing Blue Mud Bay, we worked
to the north-eastward, and at eight in the evening anchored under
Nicol's Island.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 26th January. In the morning we stretched N.N.E.
for the projecting part of the mainland before set at N. 55 deg.
20 min. E., from the eastern hummock of Morgan's Island; and to
which I have given the name of 'Cape Shield', in compliment to
Captain W. Shield. a commissioner of the navy. There is a small
bay on its south-west side, and we anchored
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
No part of the main coast to the eastward could be seen from
thence beyond a low projection distant seven or eight miles,
which I named 'Point
Arrowsmith'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Cape Shield lies in latitude 13 deg. 19¾ min. south, longitude by
the survey 136 deg. 23 min. east; it projects out six miles from
the body of the land, and appears, when seen from the south, to
be an island. Two cassowaries were seen upon it.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 27th January. Next morning we steered westward with
a fair wind, to explore the main coast up to Mount Grindall, and
see the northern part of Blue Mud Bay. At three leagues from Cape
Shield, we passed a projecting point to which I gave the name of
Point Blane, in compliment to Dr. (now Sir Gilbert) Blane, of the
Naval Medical Board. Five miles from it to the W.S.W. lies
Round-hill Island. We then worked up to a large bight on the west
side of Point Blane.</p>
<p>"Friday, 28th January. I went over in the whale-boat to Mount
Grindall. Blue Mud Bay was seen to reach further north than Mount
Grindall, making it to be upon a long point, which I also named
Point Grindall, from respect to the present vice-admiral of that
name. The large bight between Points Grindall and Blane extended
two leagues above the ship. A still larger bight between Point
Blane and Cape Shield was also visible. The extremity of the Cape
bore S. 76 deg. 15 min. E. An observation to the north and south,
taken on the outermost rocks, places Mount Grindall in 13 deg.
15½ min. south, and the longitude from survey is 136 deg. 6 min.
20 sec. east. Our course was then directed N.E. by N., parallel
to the coast.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 2nd February. We worked to windward all night,
with a north-western breeze, and in the morning saw two islands.
There appeared to be a wide opening behind them, the entrance
being round a projection which I have named 'Cape Grey', in
compliment to the Hon. General Grey, lately commander of the
forces at the Cape of Good Hope. Our situation and bearings at
noon were, latitude, observed to the north and south, 13 deg. 3
min. 41 sec; longitude, from survey, 136 deg. 46½ min. On the
wind veering to north-east we were enabled to weather the rocks
near Cape Grey, but not more than a quarter of a mile. Ran
further up, and at sunset anchored in nine fathoms, mud and sand,
near the innermost and largest of three islands which lie in the
entrance. Around and between these islands were many islets and
rocks, and others were seen to the north-eastward; the bay
extended to the north-west, and was divided into two branches by
a projection named Point Middle, the eastern branch being
defended from the sea by a tongue of land, whose south point
seemed to be connected by a reef of rocks with the inner island.
This point I have called 'Point Alexander', and to a hill, upon
the furthest visible part of the coast to the northward, the
appellation of 'Mount Alexander' is given.</p>
<p>"Saturday, 5th February. In the evening I went over with two
of the gentlemen to the south side of the bay, for the purpose of
taking a station upon a hill there, named Mount Caledon, whose
height exceeded that of any other near the water side. We landed
at dusk at the foot of the mount, and ascended the top.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 9th February. It has been said that an opening, of
a river-like form, is laid down in the Dutch chart in the
situation of this bay. No name is there given to it, and as I
conceive our examination to confer the right of bestowing one, I
have distinguished it by the title of 'Caledon Bay', as a mark of
respect to the worthy nobleman lately Governor of the Cape of
Good Hope, after whom the mount on the south side was also named.
There is no other safe passage into the bay than that between the
islands in the entrance and Cape Grey, which cape is remarkable
for the round hummock on its extremity, and lies in latitude 13
deg. I min. S., and longitude 136 deg. 42 min. E.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 10th February. At daylight we sailed down Caledon
Bay, and steered eastward along the south side of the islands
lying in the entrance.</p>
<p>"Friday, 11th February. At daylight the shore was found to be
distant four or five miles; the farthest part then seen was near
the eastern extremity of Arnheim's Land, and this having no name
in the Dutch chart, is called Cape
Arnheim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Its position was ascertained to be 12 deg. 19 min. S., and 137
deg. 1 min.
E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The furthest land visible at noon was a flat-topped hill, which I
called Mount Saunders, and nearer to us was a higher and more
woody hill, also flat-topped and steep at its north end, to which
is given the name of Mount Dundas, and our position was at this
time as under: latitude observed, 12 deg. 12½ min., longitude 137
deg. 2½ min. W. We tacked to the westward in the afternoon, and
an island came in sight, lying to the north of the two mounts,
with several rocks and islets scattered on its north-east
side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The flood tide set gently to the westward, and induced me to
suppose that there might be a passage within the island and the
rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The passage is more than two miles wide, and our soundings in
working through it were between four and a-half and six fathoms,
on a gravelly
bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Two natives with a canoe had been seen upon the island, and as
our boat stood that way, sounding ahead of the ship, they waved
and called to the people. The island is about five miles long,
and between one and two in breadth; it is low, mostly destitute
of wood, and the shores in general are sandy, and not being laid
down in the Dutch chart, I distinguished it with the islets and
rocks to the north and north-east by the name of Melville Isles,
the south end which forms the passage lies in 12 deg. 8½ min. S,.
and 136 deg. 62 min. E. In the opposite shore, between Mounts
Saunders and Dundas, is a sandy
bight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The low land especially under Mount Saunders was sandy and
barren, and .so continued for seven miles westward, to a low
point near a woody islet. Further on the coast took a northern
direction, and was seen from the mast-head as far as N.N.W. but
no other part could be set from the deck than the highest of the
several eminences in the back land, named Mount Bonner.</p>
<p>"Monday, [<em>sic</em>] 13th February. The course was directed
towards a bight behind the wood islet; and a little before noon
its appearance became so promising, that I steered into it before
the wind. In passing the islet and Sandy Point we had from ten to
seven fathoms, in an opening of four miles wide, and a bay of
considerable extent then lay before us. In the middle of the bay
were three rocks, and to the north-cast of them a headland,
beyond which the water extended
eastwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
I called the largest of the rocks which form the south-east side
of this snug little place, 'Harbour Rock;' and the sandy point at
the entrance of the bay is named 'Point Dundas'.</p>
<p>"Monday, 14th February. Beyond a low isthmus, a piece of water
was seen communicating with the south-eastern part of the bay,
and making a peninsula of the high rocky land named 'Drummie
Head'; at high water, indeed, it is an island, for the tide flows
over some parts of the isthmus. After taking two sets of
bearings, I rowed southward along the shore of Drummie Head; and
from a hill near the southwest extremity obtained a good view of
the bay, and saw the western coast as far northward as a cliffy
cape, which was named after William Wilberforce, Esq., the worthy
representative of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, 16th February. Messieurs. Brown and Bauer
accompanied me in a boat excursion to the eastern part of the
bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
This bay is unnoticed in the Dutch chart, and I name it 'Melville
Bay'. in compliment to the Right Honourable Robert Saunders
Dundas, Viscount Melville, first Lord of the Admiralty. It is the
best harbour we found in the Gulph of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>"Thursday, 17th February. We passed three rocks lying out from
a point under Mount Bonner. From the north part of this cliffy
cape a chain of islands and rocks extends out three or four
leagues to the E.N.E., which I call 'Bromby's Isles', after my
worthy friend the Rev. John Bromby, of Hull.</p>
<p>"Thus was the examination of the Gulph of Carpentaria
finished. after employing one hundred and five days in coasting
along its shores, and exploring along its bays and islands. The
extent of the gulph in longitude, from Endeavour's Strait to Cape
Wilberforce, is 5½ deg. in latitude 7 deg., and the circuit,
excluding the numerous islands and the openings, is little less
than four hundred leagues. It will be remarked that the form of
it given in the old charts is not very erroneous, which proves it
to have been the result of a real examination; but as no
particulars were known of the discovery of the south and western
parts,&mdash;not even the name of the author, though opinion
ascribed it with reason to Tasman,&mdash;so the chart was
considered as little better than a representation of fairy-land,
and did not obtain the credit which it was now proved to have
merited. Henceforward, the Gulph of Carpentaria will take its
station among the conspicuous parts of the Globe in a decided
character,</p>
<p>"After clearing the narrow passage between Cape Wilberforce
and Bromby's Isles, we followed the main coast to the S.W."</p>
<p>Captain Flinders quitted Wessel's Islands and steered for
Timor, and dropped anchor at Coepang Bay at four o'clock in the
afternoon of Thursday, 31st March; "where," he says, "we were
occupied nearly a week in completing our water, which was brought
aboard in Malay boats, and in obtaining and stowing away the
provisions." He left Coepang Bay on Friday, 8th April, rounded
Cape Leeuwin in the middle of May, and, after much general
suffering from sickness, arrived in Port Jackson on Thursday, 9th
June.</p>

<hr class="2">
<p>"<span class="a">September</span> 1st. Embarked on board the
cutter 'Mermaid'.</p>
<p>"September 2nd. At five o'clock a.m., sailed from
Sydney&mdash;after a fine run anchored inside Nobby's Island,
Hunter's River&mdash;at half-past six p.m., landed the detachment
of the Buffs.</p>
<p>"September 3rd. The brig 'Amity' lying here, learnt that she
had not the boat that was supposed to be on board that vessel. At
eleven a.m. sailed for Port Macquarie.</p>
<p>"September 4th. Arrived off Port Macquarie at five a.m., went
on shore. The brig 'Henrietta' had sailed from thence with the
boat that was said to be in the 'Amity'. Captain Gillman offered
me any of his boats that I thought would answer; on inspecting
them, they proved quite unfit, except a boat belonging to
Lieutenant Owen, which I considered it my duty to purchase for
Government, as the one furnished at Sydney was incapable of
carrying the necessary articles, &amp;c., for the expedition,
besides being very much the worse for having been badly used, and
was patched up and not safe. Went on board at twelve a.m.; had
the new boat hoisted, and made sail.</p>
<p>"September 5th. Wind fresh W.S.W. Running along the coast,
found the headlands to answer correctly as laid down by Captain
Flinders; passed Cape Byron, and Point Danger, the latter at
half-past six p.m.</p>
<p>"September 6th. Wind, south light airs; at daylight close in
with Point Look-out, passed in between the Reef of Rocks, and
Flat Islands, plenty of water, eighteen fathoms to eleven, to the
outer buoys of the channel leading into Moreton Bay by Amity
Point. In the channel not less than four fathoms and a-half, at
the last of ebb, good anchorage inside and close under the shore
of the land inside Amity Point, from this anchorage through the
channel up to Peel's Island, not less than four fathoms at high
water. After rounding Peel's Island, plenty of water for ships of
any size and good anchorage, which continues all the way up to
the Green Islands, and from thence to the buoy on the spit of
land off the mouth of the Brisbane.</p>
<p>"September 7th. At six o'clock weighed anchor and stood for
the river&mdash;came to anchor at the buoy on the end of the
spit. The navigation would be considerably facilitated by regular
buoys being placed of different colours, red and white, to mark
the sides of the channel. At three p.m., learning from Mr.
Penson, the master of the 'Mermaid', that he did not think it
prudent to take the cutter over the bar, I departed in my boat to
proceed to the settlement up the river. On going over the bar,
which was then high water, found upwards of twelve feet all over
the passage by which I entered. At half-past seven o'clock,
landed at Edenglassie, Captain Bishop, 40th regiment,
commandant.</p>
<p>"September 8th. Wrote back to Mr. Penson, desiring him to use
all exertion to sound for a passage, and to bring the cutter over
the bar and up the river to the settlement.</p>
<p>"September 9th. Making arrangements for the equipment of the
boats and packing of the provisions.</p>
<p>"September 10th. Loaded the boats and embarked at two p.m.
Several natives were seen on the side of the river opposite to
the settlement. I was informed by Captain Bishop and Lieutenant
Miller that they had not appeared there before in numbers except
one or two, and that, very seldom. On this occasion, I think,
there were upwards of thirty men, women, and children, they
seemed desirous to cross the river, I learnt on my return that
they had swam across higher up after my departure, but could not
be persuaded to approach the settlement nearer than two or three
hundred yards, where they remained looking at the buildings and
the cattle for about an hour, and then went off, and were not
again seen.</p>
<p>"At a quarter past five o'clock landed on the right side of
the river, in going up which, I observed it to be a bush with
long grass, thinly wooded, and rising in a gradual slope from the
river&mdash;it was a very pretty situation where I halted for the
night, which was very cold, with a very heavy dew, and the
mosquitoes innumerable and exceedingly troublesome, which we
found to be dispersed by our smoking. The boat's sail was a good
substitute for a tent, though it did not succeed in keeping out
heavy rain.</p>
<p>"September 11th. Left our halting place and embarked at eight
o'clock. The wood on the banks&mdash;fig-tree, blue gum, swamp
oak, and ironbark, for the last half distance no pines, but here
and there a solitary cedar. On landing, found spinach in great
abundance, mint, parsley and the wild poppy. Halted at three
o'clock on the left side of the river, on a sandstone rock
forming a natural wharf or jetty. The tide only flows a short
distance above this. Whilst dinner was preparing, took a walk
into the country, found it delightful, thinly wooded, to a great
extent fine pasturage for any number of cattle, and only
occasionally thick brush with little marks of natives having been
there. Several very fine eels were caught here, and a fish called
the cat-fish.</p>
<p>"September 12th. At a quarter-past eight left our
halting-place and proceeded. The country, as yesterday, except
the hills, being high. with fine downs thinly wooded, with very
high grass of the oat species; very few pines to be seen; the
river in some places was very narrow, and then again widened;
over the rapids, rather shallow, obliged to track the boats over,
to do which the men were forced to get out; marks of drift grass
and pieces of wood washed up the sides of the banks, and up into
the branches of the trees, marked the floods to rise here upwards
of one hundred feet. Near the place of our encampment fresh marks
of the natives having had their fires&mdash;as yet we have not
seen any&mdash;landed at half-past four p.m. Mr. Oxley has been
thus far.</p>
<p>"This day, from the number of rapids and shoals, the getting
of the boats up was a matter of great labour and exertion, as the
men were mostly in the water for upwards of six hours. At
half-past two, landed and encamped for the night. Saw some cedar
trees on the banks of the river near the edge, quantities of
honey-suckle and swamp oak on the high ground, blue gum and
ironbark in abundance, and very large. Saw a few wild ducks; the
fires of the natives quite fresh, and concluded from not seeing
them that they avoid us; codfish caught similar to those which
are taken in the river at Bathurst.</p>
<p>"14th. At 8.30 embarked and proceeded up the river. The hills
beautifully covered with pine trees of large size, the banks as
before with swamp oak, honey-suckle, blue gum, and ironbark. We
this day for the first time saw some of the natives; ordered the
boats to pull up to the shore on which they stood. After a little
hesitation, and the sight of a looking-glass which I held up,
they ventured down within a few yards; gave them some biscuit,
shewed them two sheep we had in the boat; at the sight of them
their astonishment was great, as also at two of the soldiers of
the 40th Regiment, who had very red hair; from their manner it
was evident the colour of these soldiers' hair was a matter of
great curiosity to them as well as their red jackets. They were
perfectly naked, stout, clean-skinned, well made people, and
shewed no symptom whatever of hostility. From the short
intercourse I had with them, I do not think that they had ever
seen a European before. In the evening heavy rain; the sail
completely drenched through; passed a very uncomfortable night,
the fires going out, owing to the heavy rain; much thunder and
lightning.</p>
<p>"September 15th. About seven o'clock the rain ceased, and the
weather began to break up; with the aid of good fires we soon had
our clothes dry, and at nine o'clock embarked.</p>
<p>"The natives we saw yesterday again made their appearance;
amongst them saw an old man a cripple, whom they carried, also a
little boy&mdash;gave them fish hooks and lines&mdash;they kept
constantly pointing to the boats and shouting, supposing them, as
I concluded, to be alive. The men having no change of clothes,
but what were wet, at two o'clock I ordered a landing, having
observed a good spot for the purpose, on a point which projected
into the river from its bank, on the left side going up. Under a
range of hills, encamped near a very large tree, a blue gum, to
mark the spot I caused the broad arrow to be cut above four feet
from the bottom. The country here was very good on both sides,
soil good; walked up the hills, the country behind them having
quite a park-like appearance. I saw kangaroos in abundance, but
they were extremely shy. As far as I could see to the S. and S.W.
the whole country appeared well timbered with forests of tall
pines; and to the N.W. and N.E. very few. Walked several miles,
having started as soon as I landed, and did not return until
half-past five in the evening&mdash;a fine lagoon of good water
about a mile and half from landing place in a S.W. direction;
found the grass very long and fatiguing to walk in; rain during
evening.</p>
<p>"16th. At nine o'clock got into the boats and departed. Landed
where Mr. Gray the pilot said he saw the white man, and made our
huts for the night; the party being much fatigued, having been
hard at work for six hours, it being three o'clock when we
landed. The pine hills, which appeared very high on ascending,
now that we had left them in our rear, presented only their tops
to our view, which proved we had ascended considerably. No
appearance of the natives where we halted&mdash;no marks or fires
nor the remains of shells of the river mussel nor of
huts&mdash;this place was pointed out by Thomas Robinson, one of
the sailors who was with Mr. Gray, who on my questioning him as
to the colour, number, &amp;c., of the people, stated to have
been seen, said it was dusk at the time&mdash;that he only saw
two or three men running into the bush, who appeared to be of a
light colour, but he saw no bows or arrows.</p>
<p>"N.B.&mdash;The natives are known on some occasions to whiten
themselves with wood ashes.</p>
<p>"17th October. At eight again set out.</p>
<p>"Much obstruction from dead trees lying across a narrow and
winding part of the view; too numerous and large to attempt
cutting a way through them, consequently had to pull the boats
over them, taking every article out of them, and in making a
distance of about a mile and a-half they were unladen four times,
which occupied upwards of three hours, the stream running four
knots and a-half. On getting clear of this rapid, we entered a
long reach with deep water; great number of wild ducks; shot
several, as also a yellow snake. On the hillside going up, and
opposite our halting place, a large stream or creek joined the
main river. After landing the men went to fish, and caught a
great number of cod and eels, the former particularly good. The
country about this place was very fine, and the soil excellent.
The trees of the same description, ironbark, and stones in
abundance.</p>
<p>"September 18th. At nine o'clock, proceeded up the river.
Landed at half-past four o'clock p.m.; from the number of falls
and the rapidity of the stream, this proved a most laborious day,
and the party landed completely knocked up. Several marks of
fires and mussel shells, where the natives had lately been; white
cockatoos in great numbers; paroquets in great variety, but
similar to those seen in the country about Sydney.</p>
<p>"September 19th. During the morning, until two o'clock, very
heavy rain. Rain began to pour in torrents about twelve o'clock,
which compelled us to seek a place of shelter; took advantage of
a very remarkable spot, under a very high hill, near its base,
where were some natural caves, about the size of a side box of a
theatre, and resembling it much in shape, the abode of wild cats
and dogs. After getting the necessary articles landed from the
boats, walked up the hill, which occupied one hour and a half, it
appeared to me not less than one thousand feet high. On reaching
the summit the weather began to clear up; had a tolerable view of
the country, which is very mountainous to the W.N.W., and high
hills to the W. and S.W., to the S. and S.E. high land was
discernable through the haze. Between the hills, upon whose
summit I then was, and the mountains to the W.N.W. and W., was a
large flat country, in extent not less than thirty or forty
miles, finely wooded with blue gums and ironbark. The ironstone
prevails, very rotten, good sandstone, fine soil, and fit for any
purpose of cultivation. The rain again set in, and continued
during the evening and greater part of the night, with thunder
and lightning.</p>
<p>"20th. The weather having cleared up, and having got our
clothes pretty dry, we quitted this spot at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>"On rounding the point of one of the reaches we came suddenly
on the encampment of some natives, who on seeing us, ran off,
leaving their kangaroo skins, spears and tomahawks all behind. We
landed and examined their implements, giving strict orders not to
remove a single article; sent to the boats for some biscuit, and
left it on the kangaroo skins. As I could not ascertain the
direction the natives had taken, or whether they would return, we
got into the boats, and proceeded about one mile, when two
natives were seen following us up the bank. and calling to us; we
returned to the shore, and after some difficulty induced them to
have sufficient confidence to allow us to approach close to them,
when they proved to be a woman and a lad about fourteen years of
age. The former had an infant in her arms; gave them
looking-glasses, beads, and fish-hooks; their surprise and
apparent wonder at seeing people so opposite to themselves in
colour, as well as in other respects, cannot well be described,
but it is certain they had never seen white people before, nor
could they believe but that the boats were living animals, as I
could not induce them to go down to the place where they were. On
making signs to them to do so, the woman shook her head and put
her hand to her mouth, as if she was afraid they would bite.
While we were holding communication with these natives, several
women and children were seen at a distance, but we could not
induce them to come near; the men no doubt were not far off
though they did not appear. Finding we could not induce them to
approach we left our new acquaintances, after convincing them of
our friendly intentions. The woman, in return for what I had
given her, held out a neat basket made of plaited straw and a
kangaroo skin. The former I took, but declined the latter, as it
was of considerable use and value to them. As we proceeded up the
river, these poor people continued to wave their hands, and to
shout after us, until we were completely out of sight. They were
black and perfectly naked. Great numbers of wild ducks were seen
up the river. We shot several in passing the boats. No pine trees
were seen this day. At five o'clock we landed and made the boats
fast for the night on a bank on the right side of the river about
half-way up a rapid, in the eddy of the stream, which had formed
a little basin. This place, from the colour of the soil, was
named 'Redbank'.</p>
<p>"Sept 21. This morning at half-past seven I observed the water
had risen a foot in less than an hour, and its discoloured
appearance indicating that a flood was coming down the river, no
time was to be lost in getting the boats up this rapid into the
next reach; we accordingly all quitted our position. The rapidity
of the current increased every hour and the river had risen
upwards of eight feet by eleven o'clock, and there was no want of
water over the rapids, but we experienced extreme difficulty in
getting the boats up, from the great strength of the stream
running down the falls and rapids.</p>
<p>"The country both sides of the river was very fine with a very
rich alluvial soil, and the whole on both sides, all the way up
from the settlement, quite fit for the cultivation of wheat,
barley, maize, fruit, vegetables&mdash;grapes particularly, as
also cotton, coffee, rice, with sugar cane, might with common
exertion be produced in the greatest abundance. "Very fine fish,
including a great quantity of very large eels were caught by the
party, we landed at two o'clock, and examining the country in the
vicinity, found it as described. We also observed marks of fires,
and trees marked by the natives.</p>
<p>"22nd. Left at nine o'clock. Landed at half-past one to enable
the party to wash their clothes, and to repair the oars of the
whale-boat, the river continuing the same; the country appearing
beautiful&mdash;the flood still running down.</p>
<p>"23rd. Left at nine o'clock. The flood still running with so
much force, that with increasing exertion we had only made eight
miles at four o'clock, and frequently after we had nearly
surmounted it with the greatest exertion in pulling up against
the stream; the men, from being completely exhausted, were
obliged to desist from their efforts, and we should soon have
been taken down against our wish to the first tree to which we
could make fast. Here I was in the hopes of falling in with a
large tribe of natives&mdash;nine huts being directly opposite
where we landed&mdash;on going over, however, we were
disappointed, as there was no trace of their having been there
for some days. We noticed several kangaroo and fish bones. Heavy
rain.</p>
<p>"24th September. During the night heavy rain, thunder and
lightning, the flood in the river running down with great force
making much noise in rushing over the rocks and the stumps of
trees lying in the river&mdash;at this place a considerable
stream runs into the river from the eastward&mdash;I caused a
blue gum tree to be cut down&mdash;The weather proved so bad
during the day that I considered it advisable to remain where we
were,</p>
<p>"25th September. We attempted to go with the boats&mdash;made
about four miles, but found it impossible to make head against
the stream, which was running at least eight or nine knots. We
landed and took the precaution to have the ropes of the boats
carried well up the bank, as the river was rising very rapidly.
Opposite our encampment was an immense range of mountains the
largest of which, and the nearest, was fifteen hundred feet
high.</p>
<p>"Having landed about one o'clock we made an excursion into the
country. There can be no doubt that the natives avoid us. From
the marks of fires, their empty huts, and the number of trees
barked, I should think them rather numerous in this
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"We again attempted at eight o'clock to proceed, finding the
river to have gone down six feet. Advanced about a mile, but
found it impossible to pull against the stream up a rapid. Made
arrangements for tracking the boats up by sending ashore, and the
party, passing the end of the rope to each other along the banks
as far as it would reach, and all the party assisting in hauling
one boat at a time against the stream, remaining myself to steer
her clear of trees and stumps lying in the middle. We succeeded
in doing so nearly half-way up the rapid, when the rope broke,
and the boat was instantly carried down a considerable distance
below, but, fortunately, without coming in contact with anything,
and by steering into an eddy I got the boat to the opposite
shore. I found it useless, with the means with which I was
provided, to make any further attempt to get the boats up this
rapid, which I observed to extend upwards of a mile, and, trying
the stream with the log-line, J found it running at the rate of
nine knots; therefore considerable danger was to be apprehended.
And it was extremely fortunate, on the rope breaking, that the
boat escaped coming in contact with any of the numerous large
stumps of trees which lay directly in the main stream of the
river, and which would have instantly knocked her to atoms.</p>
<p>"The loss of the boat and also of the provisions would have
placed me in an awkward situation. This determined me to order
the party and the other boats to join me, and, on their doing so,
I directed everything to be landed, and having fixed on a good
spot under the mountain, I made arrangements to proceed by land
for further exploring the river, leaving the corporal of the 40th
Regiment in charge of the boats and stores, with one private of
the 40th, four sailors and a convict. At the same time, I gave
strict orders to the corporal, on no account whatever to quit
that place, or to move the boats, and to be upon his guard in the
event of the approach of any number of natives, and to prevent
any violence being offered them, and to behave towards them in a
manner to convince them no hostility would be intended.
Everything being ready, at twelve o'clock I set out, accompanied
by Mr. Dulhunty, a private of the 40th, one sailor and two
convicts, with my servant, carrying with us eight days'
provisions. Kept the river in view; found walking extremely
difficult and dreadfully fatiguing from the long grass, which was
at least four or five feet high, out of which started numbers of
kangaroo of the large sort, or forest kangaroo. Private Ward, of
the 40th, would have trodden on an immense snake had he not,
fortunately, been prevented by my servant. It was shot by the
former, and when measured proved to be ten feet in length, and
seven inches round, and of the diamond species. We crossed three
considerable beds of rivers, running down from the mountain to
the main river. The water in the streams that was running through
them was excellent. At five o'clock, being considerably tired, we
halted for the night, about a quarter of a mile from the banks of
the Brisbane. The night was extremely cold, and a number of emus,
which our fires had disturbed, were running about, making an
intolerable noise all night. From the quantity of trees newly
barked, and wood lately burnt, as well as the skeleton of several
bark huts, we concluded that the natives must be numerous, and
could not be far off.</p>
<p>"September 27th. At eight o'clock, being all ready we again
set out, having the river in view. Nothing can possibly exceed
the fine fresh, rich country, we are now in. We continued keeping
the river in view, until twelve o'clock. Here the bed of the
river, though broad, was nearly dry, except a small stream
passing through it, and at this time quite impassable for boats,
and from the number of large streams running down from the
Brisbane Mountain, I am induced to suppose the river to be
chiefly supplied by these tributary streams, as it certainly
terminates here as a river, but I think it very probable that the
large bwamp into which the river at Bathurst loses itself
occasionally overflows, and is the cause of the tremendous floods
that at times take place in the Brisbane river. From the Brisbane
Mountain looking to the W., with a fine clear sky, I could not
discern the least sign of any hills or mountains but all a flat
country behind a ridge of hills running N. and S. These hills
well wooded with pine trees; the long and thick grass making it
dreadfully fatiguing to walk through it with our loads, the men
being badly off for shoes, and two of them having sore feet. In
consequence of this, seeing the impossibility of making any
progress by land, I determined to rejoin the boats by a short
cut, without going back by the course of the river, which we
accomplished the same evening, after having crossed the
easternmost end of Brisbane Mountain, at half past 6 p.m., found
all right with the party left in charge, myself and companions
quite knocked up.</p>
<p>"September 28th. Much rain, thunder and lightning: directed
the boats to be got ready and everything put into them to descend
the river, as my instructions were to return, if possible, by the
middle of October. At ten o'clock we left the Brisbane Mountain,
and before quitting it I caused a tree to be barked and a broad
arrow to be cut deep into it. Made rapid progress, going at the
rate of eight and nine knots through the falls and rapids, which
was attended with considerable danger from the want of ropes to
ease the boats down. I had no alternative, but to keep the stream
and a good look out, as also good steerage. The weather
threatening I deemed it prudent to land and erect our huts, which
was no sooner done than the rain began to come down accompanied
by thunder and lightning; the flies were very troublesome, as we
had experienced these three days past. Made the distance
twenty-five miles.</p>
<p>"September 29th. At nine, set out, and continued going down
the river, until three o'clock p.m. In passing down one of the
falls the whale boat was caught by a stump of a tree that was
under water and nearly upset, she was half full of water before
she was clear. The jerk threw me nearly out of the boat, being
head and shoulders in the water, but was prevented going further
by one of the men holding me by the leg: killed several ducks,
took a walk with my gun, saw a bird not unlike a goose running in
the bush, but he was too quick for me to get a shot at him. Smoke
was seen several times, but the natives do not appear to wish to
come near us. This day twenty-two miles.</p>
<p>"September 30th. At eight, we again set out, passed through
several falls, in one of which I was obliged to drop the boats
down. Several fresh obstacles had taken place, by the flood
having taken away several large trees from off the banks of the
river. Arrived at the Caves at two o'clock, heavy rain with
thunder and lightning; shot a wild duck of a new species, which
proved good eating. Distance fourteen miles.</p>
<p>"October 1st. Last night the weather was extremely sultry,
with thunder, lightning, and rain. At eight o'clock we set
forward, and in our way had many proofs of the effects of a small
flood; a large one must be terrific. Had we by any chance been
deprived of the cross-cut saw and axes, the boats must have been
abandoned. After meeting with many obstructions, we arrived at
the spot where we halted on the 17th of last month. Afternoon and
evening heavy showers; fish caught in abundance. Distance,
fifteen miles.</p>
<p>"2nd. All our clothes being very wet, and having a wish to
examine the large branch which here joined from the southward, I
determined on halting at this spot. After breakfast took one of
the boats, and went up this branch about three miles, then
landed, and on ascending the banks found a large open country
with scarcely any wood of consequence to impede cultivation upon
it. The trees, chiefly blue gum, being at least an acre or more
apart, and more ornamental than otherwise. The natives had lately
set fire to the long grass, and the new grass was just above
ground, making this plain appear like a bowling green; the soil
rich beyond any idea, and from its being easily flooded, it would
be particularly adapted to the cultivation of rice, sugar-cane,
cotton, and coffee. I saw plenty of kangaroos and wild turkeys.
After traversing this fine piece of land, which was at least six
to seven thousand acres in extent, I returned to our
encampment.</p>
<p>"3rd. At half-past eight set out. Obliged to drop the boats
down some falls: observed, in passing through one of the reaches,
a native sitting on the banks, and within a half-mile of where
Mr. Gray had stated he had seen white people. This man was sick,
and appeared to be totally indifferent to our presence. I gave
him some biscuits and left him. At three, landed and encamped the
party; discovered some natives about a mile off. We immediately
went to the place and got close to them before they saw us. They
proved to be two men, a woman, and three children. We made them
presents. The woman could not be induced to look up, but hid her
face between her legs, and on our moving off, she was on her legs
and off like an arrow. This day's distance twenty-two miles.</p>
<p>"4th. Left at eight o'clock, made rapid progress, and arrived
at the coal-bed; filled a sack with some as a sample; there is
fine coal just below. The whale-boat struck a tree, and knocked a
large hole in her bottom; she was full of water before she could
be beached. Took everything out of her, hauled her up, and in
about two hours had her completely repaired. Distance this day,
twenty-eight miles.</p>
<p>"5th. Left at eight o'clock. Passed down a fall with a
remarkable bed of rocks in it. On going up the water was much
lower, it was now nearly four feet higher and broke violently.
Met several natives, who were a little shy at first, but soon
became confident, and were fine people. Distance, eighteen
miles.</p>
<p>"6th. Left at five o'clock, and arrived at the settlement at
eleven, distance twenty miles, having been absent twenty-seven
days, the party being all in good health. I am certain the
distances are considerably underrated, from a wish at the time to
rattier underrate than otherwise. The obstructions in the river
might be easily removed, which no doubt must prove of
considerable importance. The fine timber growing on it. banks is
fit for every purpose, particularly shipbuilding. Moreton Bay is
calculated to become a place of trade when once settled.</p>
<p>"8th. At two o'clock quitted the settlement to join the cutler
at Moreton Bay, for the purpose of returning to Sydney. It
becoming dark on getting clear of the river we did not get on
board until eleven o'clock at night, as it was with great
difficulty we discovered the cutter, which we should not have
succeeded in doing but for my having my double-barrelled
fowling-piece with me, which I discharged several times. At last
we saw a light hoisted to the mast, distant from us about a mile
and a-half.</p>
<p>"9th. Beat down to Peel's Island; came to an anchor. Went on
shore, and found it well wooded; some part good soil, the
remainder sandy. On removing it from the surface found a good
clay soil below. In the middle of the island is a lagoon of
excellent water. The island is from twelve to fifteen miles in
circumference, and would be a very proper place on which to build
a storehouse to deposit stores landed from large vessels that
could not approach the settlement nearer than this. It would also
feed a number of cattle, sheep, and other stock.</p>
<p>"10th. Dropped down to Amity Point; anchored there, the wind
blowing in with a strong sea breeze N.E. Went on shore, a number
of natives being there. Was much amused by their singing a song,
pronouncing several English words distinctly, and by their
instantly recognising James Finnigan&mdash;one of three men who
were wrecked on the shore in a boat there three years ago, having
been driven away to the northward from Illawarra, or the Five
Islands, by a gale of wind. These men were kindly treated, and
taken care of by the natives for nine months, until discovered by
Mr. Oxley. They appeared delighted at meeting Finnigan again, and
instantly brought a supply of fish, which they offered without
expecting any return, though I took care, by giving them
fish-hooks, lines, biscuits, and several other things,
looking-glasses. hatchets, to show them we did not slight such
good will. The stories told of their being cannibals are fabulous
and absurd: they are a quiet, inoffensive, good-natured
people.</p>
<p>"11th. Quitted Moreton Bay at nine o'clock p.m., with a land
breeze, leaving our friends, the natives, sitting on the shore at
Amity Point, watching the vessel until she sunk in the horizon
from their view. The attachment of these people to their dogs is
worthy of notice. I was very anxious to get one of the wild
native breed of a black colour, a very handsome puppy, which one
of the men had in his arms. I offered a small axe for it. His
companions urged him to take it, and he was about to do so, when
he looked at the dog and the animal licked his face, which
settled the business; he shook his head, determined to keep him.
I tried him afterwards with handkerchiefs of glaring colours, but
it would not do; he would not part with his dog. I gave him,
however, the axe and handkerchief.</p>
<p>"On Sunday, October 16, at four o'clock in the afternoon,
anchored in Sydney Cove, and on Monday made my report to his
Excellency the Governor.</p>
<p>"On my passing down to Moreton Bay I visited Newcastle and
Port Macquarie. The difficulties which attend vessels entering
into these places (particularly the latter) will prevent their
ever becoming sea ports of consequence, as produce raised there
must be sent to Sydney in small vessels for ulterior shipment in
larger vessels for exportation. Not so, however, with Moreton
Bay. Ships of the largest size can go in at the passage, which is
called the southern one, by Point Look-out, where a light-house
or signal station could be established, as also pilots, who would
board vessels before they approached any danger. No stranger
ought to go in without a pilot. The passage, as you approach the
southern end of Moreton Island, is marked by buoys on each side,
and runs up from the entrance a course about N.W. for nearly one
mile, between two sandbanks. On the southern one, which is the
spit, the course changes to S.S.W., about a mile and a-half. On
getting past Amity Point there is no farther danger, being then
in Moreton Bay, and still distant from the establishment on the
Brisbane river about forty miles. Inside Amity Point is the most
eligible spot for a future town for this fine seaport. There is
abundance of most excellent fresh water, and good depth of water
for ships to lie close to the shore. The bay abounds with
excellent fish of every description, as well as wild fowl in
great numbers. From no accurate survey having been taken, or good
examination of Moreton Bay, a great part of it is still unknown.
There are many rivers running into it that no one has ever
entered, consequently their capabilities and resources are yet to
be learnt, though from what is known of the Brisbane, the Blind
river, and the Pumice Stone, they abound with the finest timber
that has hitherto been found in New South Wales. It would be well
that the Government should direct their attention to this
valuable article, as there is no doubt it will become one of
great export, as also for colonial purposes in ship-building,
&amp;c., &amp;c. A steam engine with sawing apparatus might be
erected with advantage on Peel's Island, for converting the pine
into deals, and squaring other timber for the more convenient
stowage and shipment; whilst it remains a penal settlement, the
prisoners would be well employed in felling this valuable timber,
rafting it down the rivers to Peel's Island, where it would be
prepared for exportation. The pine which is in such abundance at
Moreton Bay is well adapted for masts, spars of every
denomination, as also being excellent for oars. All these would
find ready sale in India, as well as being a most valuable
article in the colony. As a proof that this wood of the country
is valuable, several ships in this last year have been
principally loaded with it on their home voyage; and, further,
the merchants of Sydney are not inclined to give any information
of their profits on this article."</p>

<hr class="2">
<h4><span class="a">A copy of General Order No. 5, dated 2nd of
January, 1826.</span></h4>
<hr class="2">
<p>"1st. The Lieutenant-General calls the attention of Officers
in command at the Penal Settlements and other detached stations
to the consequences which must result to the service from any
intimacy being permitted between the soldiers and the prisoners
of the Crown; and they will be pleased to take the necessary
steps for putting an immediate stop to it.</p>
<p>"2nd. It is hoped that the soldiers themselves are alive to
the distinction which exists, and which it is of importance
should be preserved between them and the convicts. They must not
indulge in any familiarity with them. Such intercourse would be
inconsistent with the proper discharge of their duty, and highly
injurious to the public service.</p>
<p>"3rd. The soldiers are not, however, to suppose, that the
ill-treatment of a convict would be passed over with impunity.
The Lieutenant-General assures them, that any such act would be
promptly and severely punished. It would be as unbecoming the
character of a British soldier, as an indiscriminate association
with men under the sentence of the law, would be derogatory to
it.</p>
<p>"4th. The foregoing is to be considered a standing order, and
to be read monthly to the corps and detachments, with the
Articles of War.</p>
<p>"5th. The Officers in command of Penal Settlements, and
detached stations will consider it their special duty to see it
strictly enforced.</p>

<p>"The Governor has been pleased to establish the following
regulations with respect to the Government vessels proceeding to

<p>"1st. The Master Attendant is to notify to the Colonial
Secretary and the Naval Officer the arrival of every Government
vessel in the harbour of Sydney, sending a list of the articles
on board to each of these officers, and the names and
descriptions of the passengers to the Colonial Secretary.</p>
<p>"2nd. The Colonial Secretary will make such communications as
may be necessary to the officer at the head of the commissariat,
and any other of the public departments which may be concerned,
either with respect to landing the cargo or the prisoners, should
there be any on board; and no prisoner, whether claiming his
certificate of expired sentence or otherwise, is to be allowed to
disembark until permission to this effect is duly conveyed by the
Superintendent of Convicts.</p>
<p>"3rd. The officer in charge of the commissariat is to be
apprised of the arrival of such vessels, with the further view of
supplying such of the detached settlements as may require
stores.</p>
<p>"4th. The officer in charge of the commissariat is to signify
to the Colonial Secretary, whenever it may be necessary, to send
supplies to any of the settlements, he being considered
responsible that they are always regularly and duly furnished
with provisions and all other necessaries.</p>
<p>"5th. When a vessel is ready to proceed to sea, the Master
Attendant will furnish the Colonial Secretary with a list of all
the articles shipped on account of Government, and no others are
to be embarked without special permission to that effect. The
Colonial Secretary will transmit a copy of this list, with an
account of the prisoners forwarded, or any other passengers on
board, to the Commandant of the Settlement.</p>
<p>"6th. On the arrival of a vessel at any of the settlements,
the Commandant is immediately to send a confidential person on
board to ascertain whether the passengers and supplies correspond
with the list forwarded by the Colonial Secretary, and neither
are to be landed without the express order of the Commandant.
Should the master of the vessel have brought other passengers and
goods, a special report is immediately to be made to the Colonial
Secretary, in order that the master may be dismissed.</p>
<p>"7th. The Commandants are to forward to the Colonial Secretary
lists of the passengers and articles embarked in Government
vessels bound to Sydney; and nothing is to be landed until the
Governor's authority shall have been signified through that
officer.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, January 2nd, 1828. On Sunday last, arrived from
her voyage of discovery, the Hon. East India Company's ship
'Research', Captain Dillon; Count Cheneau, Consul to China from
France, is on board.</p>
<p>"Wednesday, January 16th. 'La Perouse'. In another part of our
paper will be found the details of the various relics that were
procured from the natives of the Manicola Islands, belonging to
the vessels under this unfortunate, but universally respected
navigator." (Such lists and vouchers of their authenticity are
given.)</p>
<p>"Friday, January 25th. The 'Research' though at so great a
distance from the town, is daily thronged with visitors, who are
laudably anxious to witness and examine those remains of the
wreck of the two French ships, under the command of the
unfortunate La Perouse. Captain Dillon has a cabin set apart as a
depository of those valuable articles which, the moment they are
seen, strike conviction into the mind of the most sceptical, and
satisfy all those who are privileged to examine them, of their
undoubted identity as forming a part of the wrecked ships. Of all
the articles which engaged our attention, that of the decayed
part of the stern, was most
interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The mind is insensibly led to a retrospection of forty years, and
the wood itself wears all the appearance of forty years old. The
<i>fleur-de-lis</i> are very plain, and there can be no doubt,
that the piece of timber formed a part of the ornamental work of
the stern of one of the
ships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
We have a small piece of this decayed relic, which we took the
liberty of seizing upon, for the purpose of placing it amongst
numberless other curiosities, which we intend to hand over to the
Colonial Museum, as soon as it is organised.</p>
<p>
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
From the French gentleman on board the 'Research' we were
casually informed that the utmost praise is due to Captain Dillon
for the coolness, intrepidity and skill, which he displayed at
the island of Manicolo, as it was with the greatest difficulty,
and unabated attention that the 'Research' was saved from being
lost on some of the many reefs, which render the island dangerous
to
approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The reefs were carefully examined, and correctly laid down by
Captain Dillon, though the latitude and longitude of Manicolo
continue a secret, but which, no doubt, at a future day, will be
exploded. Amongst other toasts drank on board the 'Research'. was
that of 'Captain Dillon, the discoverer of the fate of La
Perouse.' To-morrow will be the fortieth year since Australia was
founded as a British colony."&mdash;From the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center">"<span class="a">La Perouse</span>.</p>
<p>"It is now forty years, the 20th of the present month, that
the two frigates 'Boussole' and 'L'Astrolabe', commanded by M. De
la Perouse, anchored in Botany Bay&mdash;since which period no
satisfactory tidings were ever obtained, until the ship 'St.
Patrick', Captain Dillon, fell in with the sword-guard of the
lamented and celebrated navigator, which simple circumstance has
led to the termination of a research, at the spirited instance of
the Honourable East India Company, under an enterprising
commander, that will render the name of Dillon famous, and elicit
the grateful regards of the French nation towards the Honourable
East India Company; whilst the most distinguishing and
substantial rewards will, as a matter of course, be showered upon
the present adventurous commander of the Company's cruiser
'Research'.</p>
<p>"In looking over the first volume of an old work, entitled
'The Voyage of La Perouse round the World in the years of 1785,
1786, 1787, and 1788', we have encountered a very satisfactory
document, which clearly demonstrates that Captain Peter Dillon,
upon the faith of the French Government, will be 'rewarded
according to the importance of the service.' A single individual
has accomplished, under the auspices of the Honourable East India
Company, that which the celebrated D'Entrecastreaux failed in
accomplishing with two of the first vessels France could produce,
'La Recherche' and 'L'Esperance', from Brest, and which were
fitted up at enormous expense; independently of which, the
deepest interest has invariably been excited in the mind of every
Frenchman who has visited these seas for the last twenty or
thirty years."&mdash;<i>Sydney Gazette</i>, January 4.</p>

<p>"<span class="a">Decree Of The National Assembly Of February
9th, 1791.</span></p>
<p>"The National Assembly, having heard the reports of the united
Committees of agriculture, commerce, and the marine, decrees:</p>
<p>"That the King be requested to issue orders to all
ambassadors, residents, consuls, national agents employed at the
courts of the several maritime powers, to use their influence
with the respective sovereigns at whose Court they reside, in the
name of humanity, and of the arts and sciences, to charge all
navigators and agents whatever, who act under their instructions,
in whatever place of the globe they may be, but, especially in
the southern parts of the south sea, to make every enquiry in
their power, respecting the two French frigates 'Boussole' and
'L'Astrolabe', commanded by M. De la Perouse, and also respecting
their crews, in the view of obtaining such information as may
ascertain their existence or their shipwreck, to the end that, in
case M. De la Perouse and his fellow-navigators shall be found or
heard of, no matter in what place, all possible assistance may be
given them, and means procured for assisting them to return to
their country, as well as to enabling them to recover and carry
off whatever property they may possess; the National Assembly
becoming bound to indemnify, and even reward, according to the
importance of the service, the person or persons who shall lend
assistance to these navigators, obtain information concerning
them, or so much as to procure for France the restitution of such
papers or other effects of whatever kind, which belonged, or
might have belonged to their expedition.</p>
<p>"Decrees, farther, that the King be requested to issue orders
for the equipment of one or more ships, on board of which shall
embark men of science, naturalists and draughtsmen, and to
instruct the commanders employed in the expedition to fulfil the
twofold mission of searching after M. De la Perouse, agreeably to
the documents, rules, and orders which shall be given to them,
and at the same time to pursue researches relative to science and
commerce, taking every measure to render the expedition,
independently of the enquiry after M. De la Perouse, or even in
the event of recovering him, or of procuring intelligence
concerning him, useful and advantageous to navigation, geography,
to commerce, to the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>"His Excellency has directed the notification of Major Thomas
Livingstone Mitchell's appointment to the office of
Surveyor-General, in the room of John Oxley, Esq., deceased.</p>
<p>"It would be impossible for His Excellency, consistently with
his feelings, to announce the decease of the late
Surveyor-General without endeavouring to express the sense he
entertains of Mr. Oxley's services, though he cannot do justice
to them.</p>
<p>"From the nature of this colony, the office of
Surveyor-General is amongst the most important under the
Government; and to perform its duties in the manner Mr. Oxley has
done for a long series of years is as honourable to his zeal and
abilities, as it is painful to the Government to be deprived of
them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Oxley entered the public service at an early period of
life, and has filled the important situation of Surveyor-General
for the last sixteen years.</p>
<p>"His exertions in the public service have been unwearied, as
has been proved by his several expeditions to explore the
interior. The public have reaped the benefit, while it is to be
apprehended that the event, which they cannot fail to lament, has
been accelerated by the privations and fatigue he endured during
the performance of these arduous services.</p>
<p>"Mr. Oxley eminently assisted in unfolding the advantages of
this highly-favoured country, and his name will ever be
associated with the dawn of its advancement.</p>
<p>"It is always gratifying to the Government to record its
approbation of the services of meritorious public officers, and
in assigning to Mr. Oxley's name a distinguished place in that
class, to which his devotion to the interests of the colony has
so justly entitled him, the Governor would do honour to his

<h3>APPENDIX E.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<h4><span class="a">[Account of Logan's Murder]</span></h4>
<hr class="2">
<p>"<span class="a">Captain Logan</span> of the 57th Regiment,
Commandant of Moreton Bay, had for some time been diligently
employed in surveying that part of the country, and executing a
chart for the public service. His labours having been nearly
completed, he left the settlement on the 9th ultimo (October) to
make his final
survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
He was accompanied by a boat's crew and one private servant. On
the morning of the fatal day, when they had reached about fifteen
miles beyond the lime kilns, situated about seventy miles from
the coast, a group of natives made their appearance, and
manifested a very unfriendly feeling towards the party; in the
afternoon, however, the Commandant ordered his horse, saying he
should take a solitary ride and return to the encampment in time
for dinner.</p>
<p>"The afternoon wore away, the darkness of night set in, but no
appearance of the Commandant."</p>
<p>"When reported. Captain Clunie instantly despatched several
parties" in search from Brisbane. "On the fifth day, one of these
parties descried a saddle hanging from a branch of a tree; the
stirrup leathers of which had been cut away; it proved to be the
one on which the Commandant had travelled, and on examining the
earth it was observed that the saddle had been trailed along,
leaving marks of its course upon the surface. These marks they
proceeded to trace, and in a short time found the Captain's
waistcoat much stained w'ith blood, and his pocket compass and
other instruments scattered about and much broken. Pursuing the
marks, they at length came to the body of the horse, and a little
further on discovered the lifeless remains of the Commandant
loosely covered with leaves and earth, the feet protruding, and
mangled by the native dogs. The body was inspected by Mr. Cowper,
the surgeon of the settlement, who found no difficulty in proving
that the act had been perpetrated by native weapons. The corpse
was carried to the settlement, where an inquest was held, and the
above facts proved in evidence.'"&mdash;From the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>, November 16, 1830.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p>"On the next day" (10th October) "upwards of two hundred
blacks covered a hill close to where the party had to pass, which
was on the Limestone side of the river, and began throwing and
rolling down large stones on the party while passing, but no
spears were thrown at this time. Captain Logan was in advance,
and finding he could not proceed on account of the natives, he
was obliged to fall back and wait the coming up of the party.
Collison, his servant, seeing what was going forward, fired a
shot over their heads to frighten them.</p>
<p>"This for a time had the effect, and they kept more aloof, but
while the party were in the act of fording the river the blacks
closed upon them again. Collison fired another shot, which again
had the effect of keeping them off. The natives appeared to know
Captain Logan, for as soon as he had crossed they repeatedly
called 'Commidy Water', intimating thereby, it is supposed, he
should go back over the water. They followed at a distance all
the day, hiding themselves occasionally behind trees and in the
long grass.</p>
<p>"From this till Saturday, 17th" (? 16th), "when Captain Logan,
saying he had accomplished all that was practicable, gave
directions for the return of the party to the Limestone station,
nothing of consequence transpired.</p>
<p>"Between eight and nine on the 17th (Sunday), Captain Logan
took a path which led him in the direction of Mount Irwin, where,
being desirous of obtaining some basaltic formations, he was lost
sight of and his party pushed on, and encamped about four in the
afternoon on the ground previously pointed out by Captain Logan.
Some time after, the men thought they heard him cry 'cooey'.
Several 'cooeyed' in return, and then waited about half-an-hour,
when they thought they heard him 'cooey' again. It was answered,
and four or live shots fired at intervals during the evening.</p>
<p>"Early on Monday, the 18th, two men were sent down the creek
to follow the tracks of his horse's feet. About twelve o'clock
fifty or sixty blacks appeared with spears, shields, and waddies.
They hovered about the party, shouting, getting behind trees, and
endeavouring to close upon them undiscovered, but no shots were
fired. They continued their course, and in an hour or two went
off towards Mount Irwin, which was the direction Captain Logan
had taken the preceding evening."</p>
<p>The men came to Limestone, and on the 21st another party found
"a space eaten round where the horse had been tethered. There
were marks where Captain Logan had taken his horse to water, and
where he had roasted chesnuts at a fire produced at the slump of
a tree. No marks of struggling or other violence appearing, it
was conjectured that Captain Logan had jumped on his horse
barebacked and made his escape.</p>
<p>"The party then returned to the Limestone station without
having seen a black on the whole journey.</p>
<p>"Disappointed a second time, another party consisting of five
soldiers of the 57th Regiment, and twelve prisoners, set out, and
meeting with a party under Mr. Cowper, surgeon, on Wednesday,
after considerable search found Captain Logan's waistcoat,
covered with blood, as well 'as some leaves of his notebook.</p>
<p>"Next day Mr. Cowper discovered the horse, dead, in the bottom
of a shallow creek covered with boughs.</p>
<p>"One broken spear only was found, and about seven or ten yards
from the opposite bank Captain Logan's body was found, the back
of the head much beaten with waddies, in a grave about two feet
deep, where the blacks had buried him with his face downwards.
The body was taken up, put into blankets, and by stages brought
to Limestone station, and afterwards by water to the
settlement.</p>
<p>"We will not pourtray the sufferings of his agonized widow on
receipt of the fatal news.</p>
<p>"Captain Logan, though severely strict was, on the whole a
well disposed man, a man disposed to do impartial
justice."&mdash;From the <i>Australian</i> of November 19,
1830.</p>

<p align="center">"<span class="a">Funeral of Captain
Logan</span>.</p>
<p>"The last sad tribute was, on Tuesday afternoon, paid to the
remains of this lamented and unfortunate gentleman.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding the very unfavourable state of the weather, a
considerable concourse of persons was assembled to witness the
sad but imposing spectacle. The procession was formed in the
Barrack" (now Wynyard) "Square, from which about four o'clock
they departed on this mournful
journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The procession advanced to St. James' Church where the burial
service was read in a most solemn and impressive manner by the
venerable the Archdeacon, after which the melancholy cavalcade
continued its route to the Protestant burial-ground where a brick
vault had been built, near that of Major Ovens, to receive the
remains of the deceased.</p>
<p>"The Archdeacon, who was accompanied by the Rev. Messrs. Hill
and Cowper, here performed the remainder of the service, and the
coffin was deposited in the house appointed for all living, the
escort advancing and discharging three rounds of musketry over
the grave of their late gallant Commander."&mdash;<i>Sydney

<br>
<p>"His Excellency the Governor publishes, with feelings of deep
concern, the following copy of a letter from Captain Clunie,
conveying intelligence of the melancholy fate of Captain Logan,
57th, late Commandant at Moreton Bay, who was murdered by the
natives, when completing a survey which he had commenced last
year.</p>
<p>"It would be painful to dwell on the particulars of this
distressing event. Everyone who is capable of estimating Captain
Logan's character&mdash;his zeal&mdash;his chivalrous and
undaunted spirit&mdash;will deplore it.</p>
<p>"He had held for a period of four years the command at Moreton
Bay&mdash;a situation, from the character of the settlement, of
the most troublesome and arduous description. He did not,
however, confine himself to the immediate duties of his command,
but had on several occasions, at great personal risk, explored
the country to a considerable extent, and on one of these he
discovered a river, which, in compliment to his services, was
named the 'Logan', as will be seen by the Government Order of the
16th July, 1827,</p>
<p>"The circumstances of Captain Logan's death prove that the
ardour of his character was not to be restrained by personal
considerations. His life was devoted to the public service.
Professionally he possessed those qualities which distinguished
the best officers; and in the conduct of an extensive public
establishment, his services were highly important to the
colony.</p>
<p>"The Governor, though he deeply regrets the occasion, is
gratified in expressing his sentiments of Captain Logan's
character and services. He is assured that every feeling mind
will sympathise with the afflicted widow, who with her infant
family, has by an act of savage barbarity, sustained a loss which
cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>"As a tribute to this meritorious officer, His Excellency
requests that the gentlemen of the Civil Service will join the
military in attending the funeral, of which due notice will be
given.</p>

<br>
<p>"Sir,&mdash;It is with feelings of unfeigned sorrow that the
duty devolves upon me of reporting to you, for the information of
His Excellency the Governor, the melancholy death of Captain
Logan, late Commandant of this settlement.</p>
<p>"The particulars relative to this unfortunate event are nearly
as follows:</p>
<p>"On the 9th ultimo Captain Logan, accompanied by his servant
and five prisoners, proceeded from Brisbane Town to the
neighbourhood of Mount Irwin and the Brisbane Mountain, with a
view of completing his chart of this part of the colony. It
appears that when near the Pine Range the party were attacked by
a large assemblage of natives, who, however, on a shot being
fired, ceased to annoy them. The party then proceeded on their
journey, and Captain Logan, after traversing part of the country,
was on his return home, on the 17th ultimo; when not far from the
foot of Mount Irwin he left the party, desiring them to proceed
to a place he pointed out, and where he said he would join them
in the evening. From some unfortunate misunderstanding, however,
he was unable to do so, and on the 18th, the party believing he
would proceed immediately to the Limestone station, took their
departure, also to that place, where they arrived the following
evening.</p>
<p>"Finding that Captain Logan was not there, as they expected,
and having seen many natives on the day previous, their fears
were naturally excited, and three of them immediately returned to
the place where Captain Logan had left them, while the others
came here to announce the distressing intelligence.</p>
<p>"As we naturally concluded he had fallen into the hands of the
natives, and hoped he might be a prisoner and alive, parties were
sent out in every direction to endeavour to meet them; while, in
the meantime, his servant and party found his saddle, with the
stirrups cut off as if by a native's hatchet, about ten miles
from the place where Captain Logan had left them, in the
direction of the Limestone station. Near to this place, also,
were the marks of his horse having been tied to a tree; of his
having himself slept upon some grass in a bark hut, and having
apparently been roasting chestnuts, when he had made some rapid
strides towards his horse, as if surprised by the natives. No
further traces, however, could be discovered, and though the
anxiety of his family and friends were most distressing, hopes
were still entertained of his being alive till the 28th ultimo,
when Mr. Cowper, whose exertions on this occasion were very
great, and for which I feel much indebted, discovered the dead
horse sticking in a creek, and not far from it, at the top of the
bank, the body of Captain Logan, buried about a foot under
ground. Near this also were found papers torn in pieces, his
boots, and a part of his waistcoat, stained with blood.</p>
<p>"From all these circumstances it appears probable that while
at the place, where he had stopped for the night. Captain Logan
was suddenly surprised by the natives; that he mounted his horse
without saddle or bridle, and, being unable to manage him, the
horse, pursued by the natives, got into the creek, where Captain
Logan, endeavouring to extricate him, was overtaken and
murdered.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Logan having a decided objection to the remains being
interred here, has requested they may be forwarded to Sydney by
the 'Isabella', while she and her family proceed by the 'Governor
Phillip' and, it being the opinion of both the medical officers
here that, in her delicate state of health, proceeding without a
medical attendant would be attended with much danger, I have been
induced to sanction Assistant-Surgeon Murray accompanying Mrs.
Logan, as in the present healthy state of the settlement the
services of one medical officer can be dispensed with for a short
time.</p>

Vol. Iv.&mdash;Geographical Memoir of Melville Island and Port
Essington, on the Cobourg Peninsula; with some Observations on
the Settlements which have been established on the North Coast of
New Holland. Communicated by Major [John] Campbell, 57th Foot,
formerly Commandant of Melville Island.</strong></big></span></p>
<p>"Very little local correct information on a most interesting
part of the northern coast of New Holland and its neighbouring
islands, has yet been laid before the public, arising probably
from the little attention that has hitherto been paid to this
distant and not thoroughly explored portion of our British
dominions, as well as from the few opportunities that navigators,
or others, have had of minutely examining its shores or
interior.</p>
<p>"Experimental Settlements.&mdash;Two experimental settlements
were formed on the north coast of New Holland between 1824 and
1828, and subsequently abandoned. One of them was placed in
Apsley Strait in 1824, the other in Raffles Bay in 1827; and the
intention of their formation, with the causes which led to their
being abandoned, being little known, I shall first explain these
points. Previous to 1824 some masters of small trading vessels,
who had been carrying on a traffic with the islands in the Indian
Archipelago, found the trade thus embarked in of a description
that promised a profitable market for European goods; they also
observed that several articles of traffic among these islands
were obtained on the northern coast of New Holland, 'such as
bêche-de-mer or trepang, and pearl and tortoise shell.' They,
therefore, naturally concluded that a British settlement on that
coast might facilitate a commercial intercourse, not only with
the islands of the Indian Archipelago, but also with the Chinese;
and these observations meeting with a favourable consideration in
the Colonial Department at home, and Government evincing a desire
to extend our trade in the Indian seas, arrangements were entered
into for carrying the views founded on them into effect. Captain
Bremer, C.B., commanding H.M.S. 'Tamar', received instructions to
take charge of an expedition which would be fitted out at Sydney,
to proceed with it to the north coast of New Holland, and
establish a settlement on such part of that coast as he thought
most likely to answer the intentions of Government. The
settlement on Melville Island was the result&mdash;of the
formation of which I will give a short account. The materials
being prepared at Sydney, Captain Bremer (afterwards Sir J.G.
Bremer) sailed from Port Jackson, on August 24th, 1824, having
under his command (besides his own ship) two vessels, in which
were embarked two officers and fifty soldiers of the 3rd
Regiment, a surgeon, two gentlemen of the Commissariat
Department, and forty-five convicts, with cattle and various
stores. The expedition proceeded through Torres Strait, and
crossing the Gulf of Carpentaria, on September 20 reached Port
Essington, where they came to anchor. They remained three days,
but after searching in several directions for water, and being
unable to discover any, except by digging holes in the sand at
Point Record (so named by Captain Bremer,) they were induced to
look for a more convenient place to the westward. On the morning
of the 24th of September, Melville Island was seen from the
mast-head, bearing S.W., and at 7 p.m., the expedition anchored
outside of the reef called Mermaid Shoal, which extends W. from
Cape Van Dieman. The 25th was occupied by the expedition in
threading its way through this reef, and in the evening they
anchored in seven fathoms water, off Bathurst Island.</p>
<p>"At daylight on the 26th they weighed, and stood for the
entrance between Melville and Bathurst Islands into Apsley
Strait, and in the afternoon anchored off Luxmore Head in fifteen
fathoms. The next four days were occupied in searching for water,
but none but what was brackish was found, until late on the 29th,
when a small stream was met with by Captain Bremer; this decided
him to establish the new settlement in Apsley Strait, on the
Melville Island side. The most eligible spot that presented
itself was six miles higher up than Luxmore Head; on September
30, the soldiers and convicts were landed, and the operation of
clearing away ground in order to build was commenced.</p>
<p>"The spot fixed upon by Captain Bremer was named by him Point
Barlow, in compliment to Captain Barlow, 3rd Regiment, who was
appointed commandant. A low point of land to the N.W. of it was
called Garden Point, and these two points formed the extremities
of a small bay, which became the anchorage, and was named Kings
Cove.</p>
<p>"By the 21st October, through the efforts of the sailors,
soldiers, and convicts, the settlement was in a great state of
forwardness, and this being the anniversary of the battle of
Trafalgar, Captain Bremer landed some guns and mounted them on
the fort, which was now nearly complete. A royal salute was
fired, and, besides the names already mentioned, others were
given. The work was called Fort Dundas. On the 13th of November,
the fort, wharf, soldiers' huts, officers' houses, and
commissariat store being completed, also an excellent well,
thirty feet deep and six in diameter, and the provisions all
landed. Captain Bremer took his departure for India, leaving an
officer and thirty marines to assist in the protection of the
settlement. One small vessel, of about sixty tons (the 'Lady
Nelson') was also left for the purpose of fetching supplies from
the Island of Timor. From the great distance between Melville
Island and Sydney, and the total want of any direct intercourse,
very little was known about the settlement even in July, 1826.
Towards the end of 1825 one set of despatches reached Sydney,
which had been sent <em>via</em> Batavia or India; and these did
not convey a very favourable report, the Commandant having
experienced many unexpected difficulties, the principal of which
were&mdash;want of fresh provisions and vegetables, inadequate
materials for carrying on field labour, scurvy, and a great deal
of sickness, several deaths which had taken place, the loss of
the 'Lady Nelson', which was sent for supplies to the Island of
Timor in February, 1825, and never again heard of, and also of a
schooner called the Stedcombe, which the commandant had engaged
in place of the Lady Nelson, to procure buffaloes from Coepang,
Timor, and which sailed from Melville Island in February, 1826,
and never returned, having been taken by pirates off the east end
of Timor. The settlement was thus left without fresh meat or
vegetables, which latter could not be produced in sufficient
quantities. Scurvy thus broke out, and raged for many months in a
very alarming degree. Supplies of flour, pickles, and preserved
meats were afterwards sent from Sydney, in the ship 'Sir Philip
Dundas', which reached Melville Island in the beginning of 1826,
and another vessel (the 'Mermaid', cutter), sent from Sydney in
March, 1826, did not reach the settlement until August 5th. These
delays and losses occasioned not only great impediments to the
improvement of the settlement, but left the Governor of New South
Wales in much anxiety respecting it. At the beginning of August,
1826, His Excellency General Darling, Governor of New South
Wales, appointed me commandant of Melville Island, and directed
me to embark on board the colonial schooner 'Isabella', with a
detachment of troops, some convicts, and various stores, as well
as live stock, and to proceed with all despatch through Torres
Strait to relieve Captain Barlow and his detachment. On August
19th we left Port Jackson, and reached Melville Island on
September 19th. The officers and men who had formed the
settlement, and had been there about two years, were rejoiced to
find that relief had arrived for them. They gave us a
discouraging account of the oppressiveness of the climate, the
scarcity of vegetables, the deficiency of meat, the almost
impossibility of procuring fish, the dreariness of the situation
(having only been visited by the two small colonial vessels
already mentioned, by a man-of-war's boat, which came in for a
few hours whilst the man-of-war, the 'Slaney', remained outside,
eighteen miles off; and I believe that H.M.S. 'Lorne' had touched
there), the hostility of the natives&mdash;all this conveyed a
gloomy picture of the settlement. As the views of Government in
wishing to establish a commercial depot have already been
mentioned, and two years' trial had now been given, certainly
with very limited means, I shall state such observations as I
made on my arrival.</p>
<p>"The number of persons landed in 1824 amounted to about one
hundred and twenty-six; and during the period of two years before
my arrival eight soldiers and four convicts had died; but two of
these had been drowned and one died from spear wounds given by
the natives. The appearance of the military and prisoners was
that of health; and from the statement of Dr. Turner, I formed an
opinion that Melville Island was not very unhealthy, and by no
means inferior to most under the same parallel. The amount of
population after Captain Harlow sailed, was as follows: one
hundred and fifteen males, fifty-four of whom were prisoners, and
six females, besides fourteen sailors on board ship. The live
stock consisted of sixteen head of horned cattle, twenty-three
sheep and lambs, and fifty-four head of swine, all kept
exclusively for breeding, besides which sixteen buffaloes from
Timor had just been landed for slaughter. Of land cleared of
timber there were fifty-two acres, three only cultivated; and
ninety-five acres on which the timber was felled, but not cleared
off. The buildings consisted of three wooden houses for officers,
one for soldiers, one hospital, two store houses, thirteen huts
for the prisoners and seven for Royal marines. The huts were
miserable hovels, constructed hastily and irregularly. Things
appeared in a more backward state than they should have been,
after an occupation of two years, but this might be owing to the
scarcity of workmen, the deficiency of draught animals, and the
want of mechanics. The gardens were very backward. The soil near
the sea was rocky, and difficult to the spade, and on this ground
a government garden was marked out in 1824. Melons and pumpkins
grew well in it, and where there was any depth of soil it was
good, and seeds sprung quickly. The Malays had never been seen
near Melville Island. The approach to Apsley Strait was
intricate, attended with danger, and required much caution on
account of extensive reefs, currents and sand banks, which
embarrassed its entrance; but I then thought it might be rendered
safer by means of buoys.</p>
<p>"Melville Island is situated between the parallels 11 deg. 8
min. 30 sec. and 11 deg. 56 min. S., and extends W. and E. from
longitude 130 deg. 20 min. to 131 deg. 34 min. E. It lies off the
N. coast of New Holland, from which its eastern end is distant
fifteen miles. The sea between Melville Island and 'the main was
named Clarence Strait, by Captain King, and is studded with small
islands, rocks, and reefs, between which run rapid currents. It
is 8 deg. to the W. of the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>
<p>"The most northern and western point of Melville Island (Cape
Van Dieman) is three hundred and thirty miles distant from the
island of Timor. The extreme length of Melville Island from Cape
Van Dieman to Cape Keith is seventy-five miles, and its breadth
from Cape Radforth on the north to Cape Gambler on the south is
thirty-seven. The surface of the island is low and gently
undulating, averaging from twenty to seventy feet above the sea.
Melville Island is separated from Bathurst Island by a strait
varying from four miles to one and a-half in breadth and
forty-six miles long. This strait is called Apsley Strait.
Bathurst Island is of a triangular shape, each side measuring
about forty miles. Its surface and productions are similar to
those of Melville Island. In October, 1827, I examined the north
coast of Melville Island, hoping to find some good harbours, or a
more eligible situation for the settlement than Apsley Strait
proved to be, but the whole line of this coast I found lined with
an almost continued barrier of mangroves, except a few places
where there were abrupt banks twenty feet high, of red
ferruginous clay; the bays were all shallow, exposed to the N.
and N.W. winds, unfit for any other than small craft or boats. I
observed two fine abrupt sand beaches towards the eastern end of
the island; the one extending from Lethbridge Bay to Smoky Point,
the other extending from Brenton Bay to near Point Jahleel: both
face N.W. and are a great resort for turtle. As the commanders of
vessels that visited the settlement remarked on the great
difficulties of the entrance into Apsley Strait, many of them,
although several times in the strait, have frequently touched on
the rocks or shoal, and been driven by currents to the southward
of the isle. As I possessed no chart of the whole of Apsley
Strait&mdash;or even of the islands&mdash;I determined on
surveying the whole, particularly examining the southern end, and
I hoped by finding a safe entrance there, that the prospects of
the settlement would be materially improved. In March, 1827, I
entered upon this survey, which occupied nine days. From the
settlement to within seven miles of the sea at the south end of
the straits (a distance of thirty miles), the channel is safe and
deep enough for any vessel; but at seven miles within the
entrance of the straits, commencing at an inlet named Medina, I
found the passage intricate and dangerous; the channel narrow,
and winding between sand banks and coral reefs. This bay is three
miles wide. In the chart I have named it 'Shoal Bay'. It is in
latitude 11 deg. 48 min. S. and longitude 130 deg. 43 min. E. I
remained two days outside the southern entrance sounding and
endeavouring to find a passage out to the open sea, but the sand
banks were so numerous, and the winding passage through them so
narrow that I was obliged to desist. I was limited with regard to
time and had neither chart nor chronometer to assist me in making
a quick return to the settlement round Bathurst Island or through
Clarence or Dundas Straits. I was most reluctantly compelled to
return, disappointed in my hopes. I landed and examined a small
lone island that was situated in the bay, outside of the strait;
from the flock of pelicans seen upon it, I named it Pelican
Island; but upon reference to Captain King's chart, I found it
had already been designated one of the Buchanan Isles.</p>
<p>"Both Melville and Bathurst Islands, which form the strait,
present the same unvaried and gloomy appearance throughout. The
land invariably low, intersected by swamps, in the lowest parts,
and the higher ground one continued forest. The shore from one
end of the strait to the other is bordered by a broad belt of
impenetrable mangroves, indented by numerous salt water creeks
terminating in salt marshes; some of these creeks stretch inland
seven or eight miles. During my residence on Melville Island, I
thrice examined the Mermaid Shoal, which had occasioned great
embarrassment to vessels approaching Apsley Strait. It may also
be considered relevant that I should mention a dangerous reef
which lies off the eastern end of Melville Island. I presume it
was observed by Captain King, but I was not aware of its
existence till I found myself hard and fast upon it, through the
carelessness of the mate upon watch as I was proceeding from
Melville Island towards the Cobourg Peninsula in 1827.</p>
<p>"It is between Cape Fleming and Point Jahleel. The interior of
Melville Island is very difficult of access, in consequence of
almost impenetrable mangrove swamps and close forest. When seen
from the sea the island has a pleasing appearance, in consequence
of its gently undulating surface, and being thickly wooded; but
when on shore its beauty vanishes into a monotonous succession of
mangrove swamps and forest, with trees of long bare trunks, and
very scanty foliage, and salt water creeks, speedily surfeiting
the most ardent admirer of nature. Excursions into the interior
are attended with excessive fatigue and much risk, the leading
causes of which are the oppressive heat experienced in the close
forest, the myriads of sand flies which torment the traveller,
and the constant alertness demanded to guard against the hostile
natives.</p>
<p>"We found the soil of Melville Island to be of an inferior
quality, the iron-stone being so generally diffused over it. The
subsoil, after digging two and a-half feet, is better; bordering
on the swamps, it is richer, and more productive, but sometimes
so dark in colour (almost black) that by attracting the heat of
the sun, it burns up the vegetables it had quickly produced. The
vegetable productions indigenous to Melville Island are various
and abundant, vegetation being altogether very luxuriant, and
during the whole year there was plenty of grass for the
subsistence of our cattle. The timber is in general of a useful
quality, although small trees predominate there are many of
considerable dimensions, and applicable to house-building,
furniture, ship and boat-building, and to agricultural purposes.
The largest timber measured sixty feet of stem and three feet in
diameter; and the average number of trees to an acre is about one
hundred and twenty, but sometimes as many as one hundred and
eighty. In the neighbourhood of the swamps. and generally on all
the low ground, the sago palm, the fan palm, the grass palm, and
the cabbage palm are thickly intermingled with the more lofty
timbers. Amongst the forest trees, several species of the
<i>eucalyptus</i> are most abundant. Although the timber is
abundant and good, yet one-third or fourth of the trees are
frequently rendered useless from the depredations of the white
ants, which excavate a tree from one end to the other, forming a
tube from three to five inches in diameter, and even the hardest
<i>lignum vitæ</i> does not escape them. The only trees we met
with producing an edible fruit were two species of apple and a
plum; one of the apples was very acid and astringent, and only
palatable when cooked; the other two fruits were not much
indulged in for fear they might prove pernicious. Grasses are
abundant, and grow very rank, some of them being injurious to
cattle, but the greater proportion are wholesome and nutritive,
and the cattle when once acclimatised, thrive upon them well.
Cattle, sheep, and goats, when first landed upon Melville Island
suffer much, either from grass, water, or climate. I cannot
decide which, probably from a combination of all. During the
first three years of the settlement, two-thirds of the cattle
died in ten or fourteen days after landing. The cows which
survived this trial afterwards did well; but sheep never
fattened; they, however, produced fine lambs, and these, as well
as the produce of the cows and goats, which survived their first
introduction to the island, continued to thrive well.</p>
<p>"Besides the forest trees already enumerated, there is a great
variety of ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers, which give some
liveliness throughout the year to the otherwise sombre appearance
of the island, the hibiscus, casuarina, convolvulus, the bead
vine, and other runners and parasitical plants are very
conspicuous. The coranthus, with scarlet flowers; as also the
beautiful colythrix, bearing a pink flower, and many others. Some
of the mangroves grow to a considerable height, and the mangrove
holly is very frequent in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>"In the forest lands trees producing a gum or resin are
numerous. This gum, exuding from the bark, is much used by the
natives in the formation of their spears. I can say but little of
the esculent roots indigenous to Melville Island. There is a root
of a small yam-like appearance, and another resembling a parsnip,
both scarce. We never had any opportunity of judging if they were
used by the natives. The only vegetable production we observed
them eat was the young flower, branch, or leaves within the
spothoe of the cabbage palm, with the seeds of the sago palm. The
former was frequently made use of at the settlement, and a most
acceptable vegetable it was when boiled or stewed. A large bean
is also met with in sandy places, particularly near the shore,
but when made use of it caused pain and uneasiness. The first
settlers reported that cloves and nutmeg were indigenous in the
island, but this is a mistake, and the nutmeg tree growing close
to the swamps produced a small, pungent nut, and the mace or
net-work enclosing it devoid of flavour. Wild ginger is, however,
indigenous in Melville Island.</p>
<p>"I shall mention now the animal kingdom. We hud the kangaroo,
opossum, bandicoot, native dog, a small brown rat, a species of
squirrel, and an animal, very destructive to poultry, with a
sharp nose and the body covered with dark-brown hair, the tail
fourteen inches long and bare like a rat, excepting within three
inches of the tip, which is covered with long white hair; it
measures twenty-seven inches from the nose 10 the tip of the
tail. The Ternote bat, or flying fox, is very numerous, and flies
about or suspends itself to trees in flocks of several hundreds
together. Of all the animals I have mentioned only two of them
were used by us for food, viz., the kangaroo and bandicoot. The
bandicoots afforded good eating, and were found generally on
moonlight nights in the hollow trunks of trees.</p>
<p>"Of the feathered tribe there is a great variety, and of the
most beautiful plumage. Several varieties of cockatoo, seven
ditto of paroquets, six different pigeons, four kinds of
kingfishers, swamp pheasants, quail, curlew, wild ducks, sand
larks, wild geese (rare), and a wild black fowl weighing from
three to four pounds, blue and while cranes, and several more of
the genus <i>Ardea</i>; there are also magpies, ravens, hawks,
owls, and wattle birds, and many beautiful small birds are also
numerous.</p>
<p>"Amongst the class reptiles we found a great variety of the
snake tribe, measuring from one foot to twelve in length. They
were met with everywhere&mdash;in forest, swampy ground, and
houses. Several were bitten, but none of the wounds were very
dangerous, excepting in the case of the overseer, who was bitten
by a snake whilst in bed. The reptile took a piece of the flesh
clean out of his thigh, and there being at the time no medical
man on the island, Lieut. Bate burnt the wound all round with
caustic, instead of cutting any part away. The man suffered
considerable pain for some days, and was confined for ten days
from the effects of the bite. The snake was found on the
following morning in his hut, coiled up under a box; it was
killed and burnt before I had an opportunity of examining it. It
was described as six feet long, with a broad head and small neck.
Another snake, which had bitten a dog, measured ten feet in
length, with broad, flat head and small neck, the back
dark-mottled-brown and belly while. The dog did not suffer from
the bite; this I attributed to his long hair preventing the
poison from entering the wound.</p>
<p>"The saurian order are also very numerous. Frogs of an immense
size (four or five inches in length of body, and prettily spotted
) swarm in damp places. Apsley Strait and all the creeks around
Melville Island abound with alligators. They measure from
fourteen to seventeen feet in length, and in the clear water
around the island are frequently seen water snakes, two and three
feet in length, and spotted black and yellow. Turtles are common
on the sea coast, but they were never seen in Apsley Strait, and
we, in consequence, were never able to obtain any; our limited
numbers and necessary occupations deprived us of the power of
sending parties to any distance as would detain them beyond
twenty-four hours. Even to procure a few fish we were obliged to
send ten miles, and in so warm a climate the fish when brought
home were scarcely fresh enough to be eaten&mdash;not lasting
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>"To the entomologist, Melville Island offers an ample field
for observation. The species are both numerous and beautiful, and
the vicinity of the swamps affords the insect collector an
abundant harvest.</p>
<p>"The climate of Melville Island is certainly unhealthy from
the end of October until the beginning of April, or even until
May. The heat is excessive, and the atmosphere, then overcharged
with moisture, is extremely oppressive and debilitating. This is
the period of the N.W. monsoon, or rainy season, and the general
range of the thermometer is from 80 deg. to 100 deg. in the
shade, and seldom varies more than 12 deg. in the twenty-four
hours: the mid-day heat is 89 deg. or 90 deg. and the extremes 77
deg. or 100 deg. These were the ranges at Fort Dundas, which was
surrounded by swamps, and about twenty-five feet above the level
of the sea. The N.W. monsoon sets in about the beginning of
November, when the sun is approaching the meridian of Melville
Island on its passage to the S. It is preceded by squalls of
variable winds, and its setting in, varies three or four weeks in
different years. During this monsoon there is daily thunder in
the afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>"The termination of the N.W. monsoon is indicated by squalls,
and sometimes a tempest in the early part of April. The sun then
returning to the northward, the wind settles in the S.E. The sky
then becomes clear, the rain ceases, the atmosphere becomes
drier, and the weather more temperate. The hospital gets cleared,
animal spirits revive and the thermometer ranges from 75 deg. to
90 deg. June, July, August, and September are the only tolerably
pleasant months. During the period I was on Melville Island the
prevailing diseases were intermittent, acute, and typhus fever,
constipation of the bowels, frequent vertigo, dysentery,
diarrh&oelig;a, rheumatism, scurvy, and nectalopia; the latter
disease very common. Scurvy increased to an alarming extent. The
site of the settlement was dry, and the establishment consisted
of young, healthy men, direct from Sydney, many of them only a
few months from England. The complaint made its appearance six or
seven months after landing. When the malady had attacked, and
rendered incapable of exertion two-thirds of the
settlement&mdash;spirits, lime juice, and sugar made into punch
were issued to all the worst cases, and grog or wine to the
military; it immediately remitted its virulence, and ultimately
nearly or entirely disappeared. Altogether, I must pronounce the
climate of Melville Island to partake more of the character of an
unhealthy than a healthy climate. In personal appearance the
natives of Melville Island resemble those of New Holland, and are
evidently of the same stock; but they are more athletic, active
and enterprising than those I saw on the south coast of Australia
at Port Jackson. Newcastle, or Hunter river.</p>
<p>"They are not generally tall in stature, nor are they
remarkable for small men. In groups of thirty I have seen five or
six strong powerful men of six feet high, and some as short as
five feet four or live inches. They are well formed about the
body and thighs, but their legs are small in proportion, and
their feet very large; their heads are flat and broad, with low
foreheads, and the back of the head projects very much. Their
hair is strong, like horse-hair, thick, curly or frizzled, and
jet black. Their eye-brows and cheek-bones are extremely
prominent; eyes small, sunk, and very bright and keen; nose flat
and short; the upper lip thick and projecting; mouth remarkably
large, with regular, fine white teeth; chin small, and face much
contracted at bottom. They have the septum of the nose
perforated, wear long, bushy beards, and have their shoulders and
breasts scarified and raised in a very tasteful manner, and their
countenance expresses good humour and cunning. All those who have
reached the age of puberty are deficient in an upper front tooth,
a custom common in New Holland. The colour of their skin is a
rusty black, and they go about perfectly naked. Their hair is
sometimes tied in a knot, with a feather fixed in it, and they
frequently daub it with a yellow earth. On particular occasions,
when in grief, or intending mischief, or open hostilities, they
paint their bodies, faces, and limbs with white or red pigments,
so as to give themselves a most fantastic and even hideous
appearance. In disposition they are revengeful, prone to
stealing, and in their attempts to commit depredations show
excessive cunning, dexterity, arrangement, enterprise, and
courage. They are affectionate towards their children, and
display strong feelings of tenderness when separated from their
families. They are also very sensitive to anything like ridicule.
They are good mimics, have a facility for catching up words, and
are gifted with considerable observation. When they express joy
they jump about, and clap their hands violently on their
posteriors; and, in showing contempt, they turn their back, look
over their shoulder, and give a smack upon the same part with
their hand. In the construction of their canoes, spears, and
waddies, they evince much ingenuity, although the workmanship is
rough from the want of tools. They are expert swimmers and dive
like ducks. They show no desire whatever for strange ornaments or
trinkets. They are polite enough to accept of them without any
expression of astonishment, but very soon afterwards take an
opportunity of slyly dropping them or throwing them away. The
only articles they seemed to covet were hatchets and other
cutting tools; but when they could steal they carried off
everything they could lay hold of. When I assumed the command of
the Island I was extremely anxious to court their friendship, as
without it, with our limited means, we could never become
acquainted with all the resources of the Island; but,
notwithstanding, they continued until the last day distrustful,
if not determinedly hostile. They put two gentlemen of the
settlement, one soldier, and one prisoner, to death, and wantonly
wounded several others. During my time we were obliged to fire at
them several times.</p>
<p>"There was a curious inconsistency in their conduct, as one
day they would appear good humoured and friendly, and allow
individuals of our settlement to pass through extended lines of
them, and probably on the following day throw their spears at any
individual they could surprise by stealing upon him. They never
came near us without their spears and waddies, but sometimes they
would leave their spears concealed behind a tree, or in
possession of boys, who would run with them on the first signal;
they would then approach within fifty or sixty paces, extend
their arms, throw their waddies to the rear, in token of amity,
and then by signs oblige all who approached them from our side to
extend their arms also, and turn round, to show they had no
weapon concealed. When satisfied, they would enter into a
palaver, and two or three of the most daring would advance in
front of the others, which latter would remain ready to support
them in case of emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; I have
not space to relate any of their daring and cunning acts of
aggression; but we had one savage as a prisoner for several
weeks, from whom I learnt a great deal of their character, and
the following circumstance caused me to conjecture the reason of
their being so suspicious of strangers:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In one of my interviews with a tribe of the aborigines who
had approached to within half-a-mile of the fort, I observed they
appeared more familiar than usual. Having previously prepared a
medal attached to a piece of scarlet tape, I expressed a wish to
hang it round the neck of a fine young man, who bore a feather in
his hair, and appeared to have some authority. This man remained
at a distance, took hold of his wrists, and appeared as if
struggling to escape from an enemy; he then pointed his hand
towards his neck, looked upwards to a tree, shook his head
significantly (evidently in allusion to being hung), and avoided
coming nigh enough to receive the proffered gift. This led me to
imagine that the island had been visited by strangers, and the
natives forced away by them as slaves, in corroboration of which
I add three other circumstances which came under my
notice:&mdash;The first is, that the Malay fishermen, from
Macassar, are forbidden to go near Melville Island (which they
call Amba, signifying a slave), alleging that it is infested by
pirates&mdash;probably slavers. The second circumstance relates
to a lad who had been taken from a native tribe in 1825, and
detained at the settlement three or four days, when he escaped.
This lad was the colour of a Malay, and possessed of their
features, whence it is probable he was taken when a child from
some Malay slave-ship, and reared among the Melville Islanders.
The third circumstance is, that when Captain King, R.N., entered
Apsley Strait, 1818, and was proceeding towards the shore near
Luxmore Head in his boat, a number of natives were on the beach,
and a female, who entered the water in order to decoy him close
to the shore, called out 'Vin aca! vin aca!' This being a
Portuguese expression, induces me to believe that vessels from
the Portuguese settlement of Dilly, on the north side of Timor,
might have visited Melville for the purpose of seizing the
natives and carrying them away. During the four years this island
was occupied, only two aboriginal females were seen, and at a
distance. They were both old and ugly, and their only garment was
a short, narrow strip of plaited grass. We frequently saw boys
who were plump, good-looking, and with a remarkable expression of
sharpness in their eyes. Their weapons are spears and waddies,
their spears are from ten to twelve feet long, made of heavy
wood, and very sharp-pointed; some are plain, others barbed; some
have a single row of barbs, others a double row, from twelve to
fifteen in number; they may weigh three pounds, and arc thrown
from the hand (without any artificial lever as at Port Jackson)
with great precision, to a distance of fifty or sixty yards.
Their waddies are used as weapons of attack, as well as for
killing wild animals. They are twenty-two inches long, one and
a-half in diameter, pointed sharp at one end, and weighing about
two pounds; they are not round and smooth, but have sixteen equal
sides, with rude carving at the handle, to ensure their being
held firm in the hand. Their canoes, water buckets, and baskets
are made of bark, neatly sewn with strips of split cane.</p>
<p>"The natives of Melville and Bathurst Islands are divided into
tribes of from thirty to fifty persons each. I never saw above
thirty-live or forty men together, although some individuals have
reported having seen a hundred in the forest: the noise they
make, and their jumping from tree to tree make them often appear
more numerous than they really are. They lead a wandering life,
though I think each tribe confines itself to a limited district.
In 1824-5 a tribe of daring athletic men kept constantly in the
neighbourhood of Fort Dundas. In the beginning of 1826 a strange
tribe visited the settlement, and they were generally slightly
made men. During the dry season they disperse themselves a great
deal on hunting excursions, and burnt the grass on the forest
ground for that purpose from April to September. When they move,
their women and children accompany them, as female voices were
frequently heard at a distance at night coming from their
encampments. The food of these people consists of kangaroo,
opossum, bandicoot, iguanas, and lizards during the dry months;
fish, turtle, crab, and other shell-fish, during the wet months,
their vegetables are the cabbage palm and fruit of the sago palm.
They eat their meals just warmed through on a wood fire, and the
seed of the sago palm is made into a mash. Amongst those natives
whom we encountered I never saw any deformed or having the
appearance of disease or old age; probably such were left with
the women, and only the able warriors came near us. There was one
powerful, determined looking fellow frequently seen who had lost
a hand, and threw his spear by resting it on his maimed arm and
taking an aim. It appears to be the custom of the natives to bury
their dead in retired spots near their most frequent camping
ground. The burial place is circular, probably ten to twelve feet
in diameter. It is surrounded by upright poles, many of which are
formed at top like lances or halberts fourteen or fifteen feet
high, and between these the spears and waddies of the deceased
are stuck upright in the ground.</p>
<p>"I will just mention the effect the climate had upon our
domestic live stock. The English breed of cattle when first
landed on the island, died in great numbers, but those which
survived turned out well, had fine calves, and had beautiful
sleek hides, they also gave excellent, sweet, well-flavoured
milk. The buffaloes introduced from Timor herded separate from
the English cattle, nor could we get them to associate together.
After being first landed, generally a third or fourth part died
within the first fourteen days, from inflammation of the bowels.
The appearance of the animal when taken ill, was drowsiness,
lying down, swelling of the bowels, and death ensued in five or
six hours. We at first thought this disease was brought on by
over eating green grass, or drinking too much water on first
landing. Ultimately, however, I built long roomy sheds, under
which the buffaloes were allowed to shelter from the sun from ten
a.m. until three p.m., and as these animals delighted in
wallowing like pigs, in mud holes and pools of water, I directed
them to be driven to such places morn and eve. This system
combined with caution in feeding them the first week, diminished
the deaths from one-third to one tenth. Sheep did not thrive
well, for though they increased tolerably they never became fat,
or fit to be killed for food. From 1824 to 1828 only two of the
New South Wales breed were killed at the settlement, and neither
weighed 15 lbs.</p>
<p>"Goats, which are considered hardy animals, died off even
faster than sheep; out of twenty which were brought from Timor in
the course of four years, not one lived beyond twenty days. Goats
from Sydney lived better, as two only, out of six, died.</p>
<p>"Pigs did not thrive unless provided with plenty of grain and
cook's fat; nutritious roots were scarce, and earth-worms were
not met with.</p>
<p>"Poultry did well during the dry season, and as long as a
little Indian corn, or paddy could be procured; they, however,
required great care in rearing, as chickens were very subject to
blindness during January, February, and March; and the almost
constant thunder from October to April frequently destroyed every
young brood of chickens at the settlement at the same hour.</p>
<p>"Towards the end of 1827 I had sufficient experience to form a
more correct opinion of the advantages and disadvantages of
Melville Island, and I represented to his Excellency the Governor
of New South Wales, the disadvantages under which it laboured,
and which appeared to me to counterbalance any argument that
could possibly be offered in its favour.</p>
<p>"Some of the objections were as follows:&mdash;'The approach
to Apsley Strait was greatly obstructed by shoals; it was out of
any direct line of trade; the soil near the settlement was
generally light and difficult to bring into cultivation; the
climate was extremely debilitating, although not decidedly very
unhealthy; and the constitutions of Europeans suffered much from
its effects.' In the course of twelve months nearly every
individual belonging to the establishment had been in hospital,
and some of them three or four times. These circumstances,
combined with several obstacles, were so much at variance with
the prosperity of a young settlement, and had for three years
operated so against it, that I felt convinced there was no chance
of opening a commercial intercourse between Melville Island and
the Indian Archipelago. Thus the main object of the Government in
forming an establishment with the view of extending our commerce
by introducing European goods throughout the Indian Islands was
completely frustrated. From an impression that ]Melville Island
would be abandoned, I directed my attentions more to the east, to
that part of the coast of New Holland to which the Malay
fishing-proas resorted every year. I visited Cobourg Peninsula
and surveyed Port Essington, which I found to possess many
advantages over Port Cockburn.</p>
<p>"Port Essington is situated on the north side of the Cobourg
Peninsula, which projects N.N.W. from the main land of Australia,
and extends in that direction about fifty geographical miles. The
greatest breadth is fifteen miles, and its narrowest part where
it is joined to the mainland by a neck of five miles in length,
is two and a-half miles across; from Mount Norris Bay on the N.E.
to Van Dieman's Gulf on the south side of the Peninsula. This
gulf was discovered and so named by the Dutch navigators in 1705.
The port is in 11 deg. 6 min. S. latitude, 132 deg. 12 min. E.
longitude. It was examined by Captain King in 1818, and named by
him after Vice-Admiral Sir. W. Essington.</p>
<p>"The approach to Port Essington is perfectly open and
unobstructed by any danger whatever; at its entrance it is seven
miles wide, between Port Smith on the E. and Vashon Head on the
W. The general direction of the Port, which extends between
seventeen and eighteen miles, is S.S.E. ¼ E., having a depth of
water throughout of nine, twelve, and five fathoms, its average
breadth is five miles, and at the S. end it forms three spacious
harbours, each of them extending inwards three miles, with a
width of about two; the depth of water being about five fathoms,
with a bottom of stiff mud and sand. These harbours are sheltered
from every wind, and afford excellent and secure anchorage for
vessels of any description, being perfectly free from hidden
danger; indeed, the whole port is secure, and forms one of the
finest harbours in the world. There is no harbour yet known (Port
Jackson excepted) to be compared to it in the whole of Australia,
and it may be entered in safety by night as well as by day, and
at all seasons. The shores of this harbour present a pleasing
variety of little bays and sandy beaches alternating with bold
cliff and steep clay banks; whilst inland the continuous forest
of trees, of rather monotonous dark green foliage, is
occasionally relieved by small round hills, rising one hundred
feet above the general elevation of the land, which land varies
in height from sixty to two hundred feet above the level of the
sea.</p>
<p>"In my several excursions, on both sides of the port, I met a
variety of soil, and certainly that of an indifferent quality
preponderated; yet I observed many situations in which the soil
was very good, principally on the low flats and hollows, and near
places which were evidently swampy in wet weather.</p>
<p>"The vegetation around the port was abundant and very
luxuriant. The forest land is clear of underwood; the lower
grounds and hollows produce good grass (even in the middle of the
dry season) and wide spreading shrubs and flowers are there
numerous. From my experience of Melville Island, the climate of
which is the same, and the soil similar to that of Port
Essington, (which latter has, however, superior local advantages)
as also from the manner I saw several tropical productions
cultivated on the Philippines, Java, Timor, and Singapore, I
entertain a strong conviction that most if not all tropical
productions could be brought to considerable perfection on the
Cobourg Peninsula. Of land animals and birds, I observed most of
those seen on Melville Island.</p>
<p>"The fishing hawks were very audacious, and frequently, if we
removed fifty yards from the fish we had caught, would dart down
and invariably carry off a fish. Port Essington is well stored
with fish, and, from the numerous extensive sandy beaches around
it, there is great facility in procuring abundant supplies with
the seine. Amongst the fish we took there were mullet, cavalos,
bream, garfish, flounders, whiting, a kind of pike, white
mackerel, stingray, a fish resembling a herring, but fourteen or
sixteen inches long, skipjacks, old-wives, and several others. Of
shell-fish there are the common oyster, and the large
mother-of-pearl oyster, green turtle, spotted crabs, cockles,
cray-fish, cowries, and various others, and quantities of
sponge.</p>
<p>"The large sea slug called trepang, or bêche-de-mer, is very
abundant all along the north coast, from Endeavour Strait, in
longitude 142 deg. 30 min. E., to Dundas Strait, and attracts a
large fleet of Malay proas during the months of December,
January, February, March, and April, their fishing ground
extending from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Dundas Strait. The
principal pan of these proas come from Macassar, they may measure
from twenty to forty tons each, and arc manned with from sixteen
to thirty hands, sometimes as many as forty. Each proa is
commanded by a chief (called a nacodah), and to each of these
vessels from three to five canoes are attached. The canoes are
from eighteen to twenty-five feet long, hollowed out from the
trunk of a tree. The chief or master is not the owner, but merely
acts for the proprietor, who resides in Macassar. He is not
permitted to dispose of the trepang during the voyage, but must
return to Macassar with the whole produce of the fishing. In
November they commence their fishing by going to the east,
through Bowen's Strait, gradually returning to the west, until
April or May, when, having cured the trepang, and completed their
cargoes, they repair to the ports in the Indian Seas from whence
they sailed. A trepang-curing establishment is formed every year
in Port Essington, or sometimes Knocker's Bay. The buildings are
of bamboo, which the Malays bring with them, and remove when they
quit the coast.</p>
<p>"The climate of the Cobourg Peninsula must be similar to that
of Melville Island. I took a great deal of exercise there, during
all hours of the day, as did the thirty persons with me, and none
of us experienced even a head-ache.</p>
<p>"Port Essington being more open to sea breezes, and much freer
from mangroves and mud-banks than Apsley Strait, the air must
consequently be more pure. I found the temperature the same as at
Port Dundas, but the air is less debilitating along the coast of
the Cobourg Peninsula, thereby rendering the human frame less
susceptible of disease. In such a situation as Port Essington the
mind is also more pleasingly exercised than in Apsley Strait,
which I consider another great auxiliary to health.</p>
<p>"The tides in Port Essington rise and fall about ten feet at
the full and change of the moon; their velocity is
inconsiderable, except off Malay Point. The currents in the open
sea depend upon the monsoon, but in-shore they are influenced by
the tide.</p>
<p>"The aborigines around Port Essington and its vicinity are the
same in appearance with those of Melville Island, but their
habits are somewhat distinct and their weapons a little
different. They both go naked, are alike addicted to pilfering,
and display similar cunning: but I do not think the natives near
Port Essington are so daring in their enterprises. On the Cobourg
Peninsula the natives have a fillet of net work bound round the
waist, and another round the head and arms, with sometimes a
necklace, and they paint their bodies as do those of Melville
Island. Such of their canoes as I saw were hollowed from the
trunks of trees, like those of the Malays, and were probably
either left by these people or stolen from them, for I do not
think they have any means of hollowing them themselves. Their
weapons are spears and clubs; the spears are about ten feet long
and lighter than those of Melville Island, and their war spears
instead of being barbed like a hook, are serrated like a saw.</p>
<p>"I remarked one native burial place at Port Essington, it was
near Native Companion Plain. The grave was very simple, and
placed under a widely-spreading tree&mdash;the space occupied six
feet long by three feet wide, over which was formed an open
frame-work of twigs, the ends being inserted in the ground on
either side. Upon the grave lay a skull of a native, with a thigh
or arm-bone; the skull was coloured red with some dye, and the
teeth appeared as if they had been burnt.</p>
<p>"Raffles Bay is in the same parallel with Port Essington and
thirteen miles east of it. It was named by Captain King in 1818.
The latitude is 11 deg. 12 min. 30 sec. S., and the longitude 132
deg. 26 min. E. It is of a circular form, the diameter being
about three miles. Both Raffles Bay and Melville Island were
abandoned in the year 1829, and I shall conclude by offering a
few remarks on the occupation of the north coast of Australia. At
present (1834) that part of the territory of this extensive
continent, extending from Moreton Bay on the east to Swan river
on the west, and embracing all that part of Australia to the
northward of 25 deg. of south-latitude, is not only without any
single point of it being occupied, but a great part of its coast,
to say nothing of the interior, still remains to be surveyed.
This line of coast, measuring an extent of upwards of three
thousand one hundred miles, possesses no good harbour, as far as
has yet been ascertained, with the exception of that admirable
one I have described on Cobourg Peninsula. This port is a central
situation for the extent of coast alluded to. It is the most
prominent port of the coast and the most northern point of
Australia, Cape York excepted, which is in latitude 10 deg. 37
min. S. The coast to the west of it, as far as 20 deg. S., and
even further, is a dangerous and inhospitable one, on account of
the many islands, reefs, and shoals which lie along it, with
extraordinary and perplexing currents running amongst them, while
the coast to the east as far as Endeavour Strait, although more
safely approachable, still presents no harbour of
consequence.</p>
<p><i>Port Essington is, therefore, as the friendly hand of
Australia stretched out towards the north, openly inviting the
scattered islanders</i> <i>of the Javanese, Malayan, Celebean,
and Chinese seas to lake shelter and rest in its secure,
extensive, and placid harbour, where they may deposit the
productions of their native inter-tropical isles, and receive in
exchange the more improved manufactures of the natives of the
temperate zone</i>.</p>
<p><i>If Port Essington should ever be settled, it must
eventually carry on a commercial intercourse with Asia, China,
and the intermediate islands; and if agriculture is carried on in
the Cobourg Peninsula, as it would be, provided Chinese and
Malays were encouraged to settle there, its productions being
different from those of Europe, would afford other exchangeable
media for its manufactures and productions</i>.</p>

<p><span class="a">Thursday</span>, 12th May, 1842. (<i>Sydney
Gazette</i>.) "His Excellency the Governor has, in a proclamation
inserted in Tuesday's <i>Government Gazette</i>, defined the
boundaries of the Moreton Bay district to be as follows: 'On the
south by the ranges which separate the sources of the rivers
Brisbane and Logan from those of the Richmond and the Clarence;
on the west by the range dividing the sources of the rivers
flowing into the western interior from those which fall to the
eastern coast; on the east by that coast; and on the northward by
the limits of colonisation, until a more definite boundary shall
be determined on that side.' His Excellency has also appointed
Stephen Simpson, Esq., Moreton Bay, a Commissioner of Crown Lands
beyond the boundaries of location.'"</p>

<p><span class="a">There</span> are perhaps some who would he
amused by the record of the first land sale&mdash;so long
expected&mdash;of building allotments at Brisbane many more who
would marvel at what "separation" has done in affecting their
present value. For this reason I am loth to put aside what may
appear to most to be dry and worthless matter.</p>
<p>"On July 16th, 1842, Thursday, the sale was effected. The
allotments with a few exceptions, consisted of thirty-six perches
each, and the prices given exceeded our most sanguine
expectations. The eight allotments put up in Queen-street,
realised collectively the large sum of £1,340; the largest sum
given for any one allotment being £250. The south side of the
river did not go off so well, but considering the inferiority of
the situation the biddings were
high.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
The allotments were put up at the minimum price of £100 per acre.
No. 1, of Section I, was purchased by Mr. Dudley Sinclair for
£230, and then other allotments were secured by the
