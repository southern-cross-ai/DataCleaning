<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h3>AT BEZIL AND CARAT'S.</h3>
<p>To everyone concerned it was admitted that Mr. James Hunter, or
the &quot;Toff Bird&quot;&mdash;which latter was the most popular
of his many aliases&mdash;stood at the very head of his mixed
profession. I use the adjective advisedly; for, in addition to
being an accomplished burglar, he was&mdash;and the blend is most
uncommon&mdash;a very competent and successful <i>chevalier
d'industrie</i>. Forgery was a speciality of his; so was the
&quot;confidence trick&quot; in all its varied branches;
&quot;faked&quot; cards and dice, too, had received much attention
at his hands. But so clever were his disguises, so consummate his
impudence and skill in conducting his operations, that, although at
times the Australian police laid hold of him, he invariably slipped
through their fingers, owing generally to some defective link in
the question of identity. Burglary the &quot;Toff Bird&quot; looked
upon as an inferior and demoralizing form of excitement: one to be
seldom practised, and then only when the booty was well worth the
risk. &quot;Stones&quot; were the only things that appealed to him;
and the melting-pot was rarely the richer by any contribution from
his hands. This matter was probably another factor in his long
immunity. Newspapers were, of course, his principal sources of
information. No person in Mr. Hunter's line of business can have
better or more reliable ones in these days. Thus when he noticed a
reporter's glowing eulogy anent a parcel of fine
gems&mdash;diamonds and sapphires&mdash;just received from London
by Messrs Bezil and Carat, the big jewellers of Pitt Street,
Sydney, New South Wales, he felt the time had arrived for one of
his rare debauches&mdash;an irresistible craving sensation much the
same as at intervals seizes upon the reformed dipsomaniac for
spirits. So, hurriedly winding up his affairs in Adelaide, where he
had been doing uncommonly well amongst returned miners from
Coolgardie, he journeyed to the New South Wales capital. And then,
after inspecting the jewels in the character of a lucky Westralian
digger, and finding them well worthy of his attention, he at once
went to work.</p>
<p>First adopting a precaution that more than once had served him
in good stead, he booked a steerage passage by the outgoing mail
steamer for San Francisco and sent a certain amount of luggage on
board.</p>
<p>The steamer sailed on the fourth day from his arrival in the
Eastern capital; and at midnight on the third the &quot;Toff
Bird&quot; was taking the measure of the great safe in Messrs.
Bezil and Carat's show-room, out of which he had on his previous
visit seen the precious stones produced. Two hours later, before
the combined forces of drill and jemmy, the door swung open. But it
had been a tough contract even for that master of scientific entry,
and the floor was wet with perspiration as his trembling hands
wandered over the shelves, seeking the box whose shape and contents
he had taken such strict cognizance of only a few days ago. But it
was gone. In vain he flashed his lantern here and there. Nothing
met his eager eyes except watches, bracelets, rings&mdash;all very
well in their way, doubtless, but nothing to him. The parcel had
vanished! Sold, perhaps. Not a loose stone could he see as he
ransacked the safe, pulling its glittering contents out on to the
floor beside him. In his deep disappointment he swore aloud. Then,
presently, a very beautiful opal and diamond ring catching his eye,
he absently put it on the index finger of his right hand and,
leaning back, watched the iridescent gleaming of the big central
stone&mdash;a Queensland opal of most exceptional lustre and
size.</p>
<p>All the interest of his venture had departed. Five thousand
pounds' worth of mixed jewellery lay around him, as he squatted
there, gleaming in the light of his open bull's-eye. But he had
missed his shot and cared little for aught besides. Still, after
all, there were some stones that might be worth troubling about.
And choosing from amongst his array of tools a peculiarly-shaped
pair of pincers, he took up a bracelet set with two large rubies,
and deftly&mdash;snip, snip&mdash;cut them out of their setting and
let them drop on the floor beside him. As the last one fell he
heard a noise at his back and screwed his head round. In a second
he was on his feet, a short, thin, wiry, dark-faced, clean-shaven
man confronting another&mdash;a burly, tall one, whose shadow ran
huge and black along the shop as, waving his lantern, he exclaimed,
in a harsh, ropy voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha, got yer, 'ave I? Nice little game this, ain't it?
Well, yer'd better come along o' me. No larks now, 'cause I'm big
enough and strong enough to eat yer. So&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>That was the last word he ever spoke, for the next instant a
steel bar crashed full on his head, and he fell like a pithed
bullock, shaking the whole place with the fall of him&mdash;fell
right across the heap of jewellery, a thick stream of blood running
slowly from the cleft skull amidst the scattered gold and silver.
Almost unconsciously the &quot;Toff Bird&quot; stooped to rescue
the rubies; but he was too late. Already the dark pool had
surrounded them, and he drew his hand back with a gesture of
repulsion and disgust as his fingers nearly came in contact with
it.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird02.jpg"
width="409" height="500"></p>
<p>&quot;Hang the luck!&quot; he muttered, clicking tongue and
teeth together irritably. &quot;What a cursed mess! Snuffed out, I
suppose, in one act!&quot; And he bent down to listen at the
prostrate figure. The man had fallen forward on his face, and all
that could be seen by the strong light from the &quot;Toff
Bird's&quot; lantern, resting on one of the safe shelves, was a
mass of dark, curly hair, with a raw and gaping wound across it,
from which blood oozed. The body gave no sign of life. Evidently
the heavy &quot;slice&quot;&mdash;in shape something like a great
paper-knife, and used for inserting and prising&mdash;had cut right
through into the brain.</p>
<p>&quot;What rotten luck!&quot; exclaimed the &quot;Toff
Bird&quot; again, as he began to gather his tools up. &quot;Who'd
ha' thought a tap like that would ha' spread him out in such
fashion? It was not finding what I came for, I expect, that made me
hit so hard&mdash;that and his cheek. A nice row there'll be
to-morrow. There's a few stones here worth having,&quot; he
continued, taking out his pliers. &quot;But, no, I'll touch
nothing. They can have the bag, too. It might work mischief
outside.&quot; Then, after carefully examining his clothes, and
giving a last glance of distaste and anger at the motionless form,
he extinguished the light and made his way into the narrow alley
from which he had effected an entrance.</p>
<p>It was an advantage that the police would never dream of
suspecting him as the author of such a clumsy, half-completed piece
of work. And as he let himself into his lodgings he doubted whether
there would be any necessity for him to leave the Colony. Lighting
the gas, his eye fell upon the ring&mdash;until now completely
forgotten. With a curse he took it off and put it into his
waistcoat-pocket.</p>
<p>Suddenly he started, hurriedly searched his other pockets, and
turned out the contents of a small hand-bag. And then he
remembered; and knew that the sooner he got away the better.
Already, indeed, he seemed to feel the fatal rope tightening about
his neck. Yesterday he had bought a knife at a shop in George
Street&mdash;a small, expensive, tortoise-shell-handled one with
six blades. He had intended to leave this in his room when setting
out on his expedition, but had neglected to do so. And now he
distinctly recollected making use of it whilst busy at the safe. A
blade had snapped, and he threw the knife into the bag. It was
there at this minute&mdash;a damning bit of evidence indeed! And,
worse than all, he had in an idle moment scratched on the little
silver plate, in sign of ownership, the figure of a bird. As he
thought on this he hurriedly put on his cap and drew up the blinds.
Alas, the dawn was breaking and noises came to his ears from the
main thoroughfares! Too late to return!</p>
<p>The <i>Alaska</i> did not sail before midday, and would, of
course, be watched. That fact, however, gave him little trouble. He
had deceived the &quot;D's&quot; so many times with success that he
held them cheap. All the same, murder was murder; and the change,
he felt, would be healthier for him.</p>
<p>Never a great believer in the common mode of disguise by wigs,
false whiskers, and such things&mdash;giving their wearer no end of
trouble with a minimum of satisfaction&mdash;he had elaborated
notions of his own, helped by much reading up on the subject. So
now, going to the glass, he took out three front teeth in the upper
jaw and replaced them by others so made that when the plate was in
position they gave to his mouth the shape known as
&quot;overshot,&quot; and completely altered the expression of the
face. From many experiments he had come to the conclusion that,
with concealment of identity in view, the mouth was, perhaps of
all, the most susceptible feature to work upon. Having fixed the
upper jaw to his liking and extracted the middle tooth in the lower
one, he grinned with satisfaction as he realized the wonderful
transformation brought about by such simple means. Sixty guineas
was the sum a clever American dentist had charged for the
&quot;fake.&quot; And as he stared in the glass the &quot;Toff
Bird&quot; told himself that it was cheap at the price. His
clear-cut features were naturally dark, but with a touch or two of
some liquid on the cheek-bones and over the forehead as high as the
hat-mark he gave to the skin a capital imitation of long exposure
to sun and weather. By similar means his thick brown hair presently
changed to jet black and took a curl in it. Finally adjusting a
pair of blue spectacles and putting on a wide-brimmed felt hat, he
looked to the life the character he was making up for&mdash;an
Australian bushman from the hot Queensland interior, on his way to
try the wonderful new diggings at Klondike, British Columbia. And
it was with the utmost confidence that he presently appeared in the
streets and entered a restaurant for an early breakfast.</p>
<p>Another hour, and he was calmly sitting smoking on the
<i>Alaska's</i> rail, whilst within a few feet of him two
detectives he knew well chatted together, and kept a perfunctory
watch on the passengers until the last bell rang, and the cry arose
of &quot;All for the shore!&quot;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h3>THE MAN WHO HAD THE RING.</h3>
<p>The murder at Bezil and Carat's came to light exactly
twenty-four hours after the <i>Alaska</i> left the wharf. And it
made a sensation. But the police were puzzled in spite of the clue
of the new knife found in the bag of tools. They could not believe
that the renowned &quot;Toff Bird &quot; would &quot;give himself
away&quot; in such fashion. Nor was the job at all like one of his.
Thus a fortnight went by before it was suspected that the murderer
must really have got off in the <i>Alaska</i>, and the cable began
to talk to the 'Frisco authorities. Then the arrival of the steamer
was reported, and word flashed under the ocean that no person in
the slightest degree resembling the criminal had been found amongst
her passengers.</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn't expect anything else,&quot; remarked Detective
Barnes. &quot;He was there, though, all the same. Good Lord! the
beggar's a reg'lar genius! It ain't to be expected that those chaps
yonder could twig him when he's done us times and again. Why, I saw
the boat start, and I wouldn't like to swear that he didn't ask me
for a light for his pipe. The only thing that might lag him is the
ring. But I never knew the 'Toff to collar set stones before. And
the chances are that he's chucked the gold over the side long
ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Great was the surprise, then, of those interested to receive
word, a month or two afterwards, that the San Francisco police had
actually arrested the man with the ring in his possession. And
about the latter there could be no possible mistake as, besides its
high value and striking appearance, it had not been the property of
the firm&mdash;simply held by them for initial lettering around the
inside of the circlet. This was just finished when the burglar
slipped it on his finger. Now it seemed likely enough to be the
means of slipping a rope around his neck.</p>
<p>Barnes, armed with full powers, was dispatched <i>vi&acirc;</i>
London, where he was to procure extradition papers, the Australian
Colonies not being considered able as yet to stand alone in that
respect.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm blessed if I think I'll be able to swear to him,
sir,&quot; remarked the officer to the Inspector-General of Police
as he started. &quot;I don't know whether I ever saw his natural
features. Once, I remember, he shaved himself bald; another time
his hair'd be thick and woolly as a nigger's. His features and
person he fakes, too, in such a way as to completely and
permanently alter his appearance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh, nonsense, Barnes,&quot; replied the I.-G.P.,
testily, &quot;I'd pick the fellow out myself anywhere. Didn't we
all see him for days together whilst his case against the
<i>Advertiser</i> was going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We did, sir,&quot; answered Barnes, triumphantly,
&quot;and a week after he swindled a bushman out of &pound;500 by
the confidence dodge. I knew at once by the cut of the trick that
it was the 'Toff's' doing. Still, the countryman swore hard and
fast he'd been robbed by a very stout man with fat cheeks and thick
lips, who walked lame and had a cast in the right eye. Can you
conceive, sir, of anybody more unlike the plaintiff in Hunter
<i>versus</i> the <i>Advertiser?</i> And, doubtless, whilst we were
taking notes for future use, he was all made up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well, Barnes,&quot; replied his superior, &quot;you
<i>must</i> bring somebody. These confounded newspapers keep on
nagging me about the case at every opportunity. Bring the man who
had the ring, and you can't go very far wrong. Remember that,
Barnes&mdash;<i>bring the man who had the ring!&quot;</i></p>
<p>&quot;I will, sir,&quot; replied the detective, rejoiced at
finding his instructions compressed into a single explicit
sentence, and happily ignorant of all that sentence held for him in
the future.</p>
<p>Barnes's first introduction to his prisoner at San Francisco
somewhat staggered him. He found him in a comfortable room,
surrounded by flowers, boxes of cigars, and sweatmeats&mdash;a
dark-complexioned, clean-shaven, rather handsome, middle-aged man,
who seemed in the best of spirits, to be heartily enjoying himself,
and who, despite a resemblance to the accepted official
description, might or might not be the &quot;Toff Bird&quot; for
all the detective could say.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked the prisoner, as he puffed a cloud of
fragrant smoke into Barnes's amazed face, &quot;I suppose the fun's
all over now, eh? And I can tell you I've had a good time of it.
Now you'd better set to work and find the real Simon
Pure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Barnes, &quot;what do you call yourself,
then? And what does all this funny business mean? Gad, it looks
like a scene in a bloomin' burlesque!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is&mdash;exactly&mdash;my friend,&quot; replied the
other, as he lit a fresh cigar, &quot;but you don't mean to say
that you're going to carry it any farther?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet, Mr. James Hunter, that I am,&quot; replied the
detective; &quot;or, rather, I'm going to carry you on to Sydney,
there to stand your trial for murder and robbery.&quot;</p>
<p>For a minute or two the other looked grave. Then, leaning back
in his chair, he burst into shout after shout of laughter.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird03.jpg"
width="396" height="500"></p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said he at last, growing calmer, &quot;I've
had some curious things happen to me in my time! But this bangs 'em
all! Jove! What will Jack D'Arcy say? Yes, I'll see it through
&mdash;dashed if I don't! I wonder if there's any damages hanging
to the business?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's no use gagging, 'Toff Bird,'&quot; replied the
detective, grimly. &quot;We're pretty well up to your moves by this
time. And I'm blest if I think much of this one&mdash;mistaken
identity, of course. Why don't you say you're a bloomin' lord at
once, and ha' done with it?&quot;</p>
<p>But at this the prisoner nearly choked in an excess of
merriment.</p>
<p>&quot;So I am, you fool,&quot; he gasped at length. &quot;I've
told 'em so here over and over again. And now I tell you. I only
took my family name of Brown so as to have a little peace amongst
these democrats. I bought the ring you're making so much fuss about
from a chap up yonder in Seattle. Go and find him. He might be your
murderer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too thin,&quot; replied Barnes, shaking his head.
&quot;You're the 'Toff Bird' right enough; and you're cornered at
last. Still, I'd have expected you to strike out a better line than
this. You were found with the ring in your possession, weren't
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wearing it at the 'Astor,'&quot; said the other,
promptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Then back you come with me to Sydney,&quot; said Barnes,
stolidly.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; laughed the other. &quot;I should
probably have gone there in any case. Got a cousin over yonder I'd
like to see. Ever hear of him&mdash;Captain D'Arcy,
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, or something of the sort, to the
Governor?&quot;</p>
<p>But Barnes only smiled knowingly and winked at the chief gaoler,
who just then entered to ask if the prisoner wished for anything in
the shape of refreshments.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; replied the latter, consulting a diary,
&quot;I have to receive a deputation of the Daughters of Zion at
3.15. At 3.30 Maroni, the photographer, is due; at 4 I'm to sit for
my bust to Jenkins; at 5 I promised the sub-editor of the
<i>Hawk</i> an interview. Then, till after dinner, I shall be busy
writing autographs&mdash;the demand is increasing, and I've risen
the price to a dollar each. So I'm sure,
Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;yes&mdash;Barnes, now you know how fully my time
is occupied, that you'll excuse me, will you not? May I hope to
have the pleasure of seeing you again to-morrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'm blowed!&quot; was all the reply the
flabbergasted detective could make as the chief led the way out of
the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; remarked the latter, admiringly, &quot;he's
real grit, ain't he? And good as gold. Not a darned mite of trouble
does he give either. Fourteen offers of marriage sence he's been
here to my own knowledge. Guess you ain't got many o' the sort at
the Antip-podes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Barnes, sourly, &quot;nor, apparently,
by the fuss you're making over the fellow, are they too plentiful
on this side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's so every time,&quot; said the other,
good-humouredly. &quot;I can't call to mind just at the pree-cise
moment anyone that's been as sandy and chipper as 'His Lordship'
yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But his luggage?&quot; asked the detective. &quot;Any
clues in it? Of course, you overhauled everything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should smile!&quot; replied the other. &quot;However, as
a matter of fact, a big old gripsack about filled the bill. And
there wasn't no clues worth betting on. Say, you're sure you ain't
barkin' up the wrong tree?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He had the ring?&quot; asked Barnes.</p>
<p>&quot;You can gamble your bottom dollar right through on
that,&quot; replied the chief. &quot;I'm takin' you to see it and
the rest o' the outfit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then back he goes,&quot; replied Barnes, doggedly.
&quot;It's him right enough; and this is only one of his deep
games. But I'll let him know that he can't act the goat with Bill
Barnes the same as he seems to be doing here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You haven't got him yet,&quot; replied the chief, with a
grin. &quot;I reckon there's formalities to eventuate
fust.&quot;</p>
<p>These took exactly a week of hard worry on Barnes's part to put
through, working sixteen hours a day. And all the time the prisoner
enjoyed himself mightily, and was made much of by crowds of
visitors who flocked full-handed to view &quot;The Great Australian
Murderer,&quot; concerning whom the &quot;snappy&quot; papers
manufactured columns of matter, whilst their stenographers hung
eagerly on every word the prisoner uttered, ready to work up a few
sentences into a &quot;story.&quot;</p>
<p>But at last poor Barnes had the satisfaction of seeing
&quot;John Brown&quot; safely lodged in the cabin specially
prepared for him on the <i>Humboldt</i>. It not being &quot;the
season,&quot; there were few people travelling by the
<i>Humboldt</i>, and most of these, even, left at Honolulu; so
that, practically, Barnes and his prisoner had the ship to
themselves after she left the Sandwich Islands and commenced to
thread her way through Micronesia.</p>
<p>The <i>Humboldt</i> was a good sea-boat, and so far, from a
weather point of view, the trip had been enjoyable. But on getting
fairly amongst islet-dotted Micronesia the humours of the hurricane
season began to make themselves felt in earnest, and gale after
gale howled and tore at the big mail-cargo carrier as if trying to
lift her clean out of the water. She was rigged as a barquentine,
and the main and mizzen masts were each in one piece of steel. But
for'ard everything above the foreyard was wood. Thus, in case of
accident, she carried some spare spars lashed to ringbolts along
the main deck. Naturally the blows, short-lived in their tropical
intensity though they were, had by their quick succession raised a
heavy sea, in which the <i>Humboldt</i> floundered at
quarter-speed, and with her engines, as often as not, wildly
racing. The last three or four squalls had caught her dead on end,
sending tons of water over her fo'c's'le-head until the main deck
was afloat. And one evening Brown and the detective, coming up for
a breath of fresh air, perched themselves on the spare spars so as
to be out of the way of the swirling seas that rolled along the
deck.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter with the chief?&quot; asked Brown,
suddenly pointing towards the bridge where the first officer was
waving his arms towards them, and apparently trying to make his
voice heard through the deafening turmoil.</p>
<p>&quot;Wants us to get out o' this, I fancy,&quot; replied
Barnes, as the steamer's stern sunk down till it seemed as if she
was trying to sit upright on it, whilst the great, sharp bows
towered up and quivered in the dusky light like some huge fan
clutched and shaken by giant hands below. Then, almost as he spoke,
with a thundering roar they crashed in their turn down, down, until
bridges and funnels and boats appeared about to topple over on the
pair. Then, as they turned in dismay to run, a tremendous sea, high
as the shearpole of the fore-rigging, came rushing irresistibly
aft, and tore them away like feathers and whirled them
overboard.</p>

<p>As he struck out blindly amidst the smother Brown, choking and
exhausted, presently felt his hands strike something, to which he
clung with all the tenacity of a drowning man. Exerting his
strength, he dragged himself astride of what he at once knew for
one of the big spars on which he and Barnes had been standing. And
as it was tossed hither and thither like a chip amongst the
boiling, foaming seas he caught a glimpse of a grey mass far ahead,
now seen for a second, then hidden altogether, that he knew must be
the <i>Humboldt</i>.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h3>IN THE QUEEN'S NAME.</h3>
<p>Clinging to a round spar in a heavy sea is all very well to read
about, but only when it comes to practice can the difficulty of the
feat be fully realized. A score of times Brown thought he must let
go and drown as the seas broke over and hid him, stifling, for
minutes together. Luckily the spar was long and
heavy&mdash;intended, indeed, to make a new foreyard of&mdash;and
therefore, although not as buoyant as a lighter one might have
been, it did not toss about so much. And he knew that the furious
squall would presently clear off, also that land could not be far
away&mdash;several small islets having been visible at sundown. The
knowledge of these things sustained him as he lay along the spar
full length, with legs and arms clasped around it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at midnight the weather cleared and the sea began
to fall as suddenly as it had risen, enabling him to sit up and
gaze around. There was a second-quarter moon shining placidly in
the now blue sky, and the castaway thought that perhaps the
Humboldt might have hove to and be still somewhere in sight. He saw
nothing of the ship. Seemingly quite close at hand, however, was a
group of dark objects that looked like a fleet of canoes under
sail, but which he knew were coco palms springing from some atoll;
and whose very crests the waves appeared to wash, so low was the
land. He could hear, too, quite distinctly the long roll of surf on
a reef, and soon became certain that his spar was travelling
towards it. As the hours wore slowly by and dawn showed he saw,
about a mile off, a large atoll against whose encircling barrier
the sea looked like a wall of scoured wool. The wind was blowing
fair for the island, and to his dismay he realized that in a few
hours he would be in the breakers. All at once, turning his head,
he caught sight of something white rising and falling between
himself and the red round sun, just dipping its lower limb in the
water. Something white, crowned by a black spot, that the next
minute stood upright, straddling in forked human shape, with arms
outspread and wildly waving, whilst a loud &quot;Halloa!&quot; came
down the wind. Then the figure, evidently losing its balance,
abruptly vanished in a splash of white water. But it soon
re-appeared, and, squatting on top of what Brown made out to be a
hencoop, desperately paddled with a long flat bar until near enough
to disclose to the other's astounded view Detective Barnes,
hatless, half-naked, and salt-incrusted, but otherwise apparently
safe and sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Better come on to my craft,&quot; panted Barnes, as he
paddled alongside. &quot;But what a night it's been, eh? Good Lord,
I never expected to see you again. This is a bit of luck, if you
like! We ain't out o' the wood yet, though. Look how the sea's
boilin' over yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you're a sticker, and no mistake,&quot; replied
Brown, the grim humour of the thing appealing to him, as with a few
strokes he gained the big double coop and drew himself on to it.
&quot;There no escaping you! I suppose I may consider myself in
custody again, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, yes, of course,&quot; replied the other, as the pair
shook hands heartily. &quot;But you bet your boots I didn't come
after you of my own free will. Well, of all the rummy things I
think this one takes the cake! Nobody livin' yonder, I
suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; said Brown, as he wrenched off a bar
and began to paddle. &quot;I expect we'd better make round to the
other side and see if there's any entrance. There generally
is.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, as they dropped to leeward they saw a fairly wide
gap in the reef, and steering for it were presently paddling
between six-foot walls of roaring surf where the next minute an
inrushing sea, hitting their craft broadside on, sent them head
over heels into calm water, whence they easily swam to the shelving
beach.</p>
<p>The first thing to catch their eyes as they dragged themselves
up the shelving bank of white coral was a neat hut standing in a
clump of palms.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank the Lord!&quot; exclaimed Barnes, devoutly,
&quot;there's somebody here. I'm fairly starving.&quot; And
breaking into a trot he made for the hut and threw open the door,
only to spring back the next minute with a look of horror on his
still ruddy face. &quot;A dead man!&quot; he whispered, as Brown
came up. &quot;White, too!&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird05.jpg"
width="421" height="500"></p>
<p>Looking in, his companion saw the body of a man stretched full
length across the threshold. It was clothed in moleskin trousers
and blue shirt, and lay staring upwards with the hands clasped
across the breast. The features were those of an elderly man; the
long brown hair and beard plentifully flecked with grey; and the
pale face composed and calm. Near by stood a small blue phial which
Barnes professionally pounced upon and put to his nose.
&quot;Chlorodyne!&quot; he muttered. &quot;Overdose, perhaps. Or
got tired and pegged out purposely. Not so very long gone either.
He gave me a start, though, at first. Lots o' tucker,&quot;
continued the detective, pointing to strings of dried fish, an open
cask of biscuits, and some tins of preserved meat. &quot;Poor chap!
Well, it must ha' been lonely. Wonder what his game
was&mdash;hermetizing, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Copra gatherer, I should say,&quot; replied the other.
&quot;And a lucky thing for us; as, sooner or later, a ship is
bound to call here.&quot;</p>
<p>They buried the dead man before breaking their fast, soon
digging a grave in the crumbly coral with a spade they found
outside the house. Then, presently exploring, they found, farther
towards the heart of the grove, a long, low building, roofed with
iron and containing a few tons of coco-nut cut into pieces and
dried in the sun&mdash;copra, in fact.</p>
<p>Buoyed up by the certain hope of ultimate rescue the castaways
bore their lot patiently. Of food they had abundance, for there
were pigs and fowls on the island: and in the sea turtle and fish.
There was no fresh spring water; but an underground tank at one end
of the copra-house contained enough to last them for
years&mdash;replenished from the iron roofing as it was by every
thunderstorm.</p>
<p>From papers in an old pocket-book they found that the man they
had buried was a sailor who had figured in many ships' discharges,
now by one name, now by another. There was also a memorandum of
agreement between himself and a person in Honolulu in which for a
certain wage the former agreed to stay on the island as caretaker,
and to make copra, also look after the plantation of young coco
trees. Thus, without doubt, the place was private property; and the
pair, recognising the fact, and that they were bound to make some
return for their keep, took upon themselves the dead man's duties
as best they might, hoeing and weeding round the plants and
maintaining the fences in pig-proof order. They, too, became
experts at copra-making, a process that Brown had often seen
before. And he even taught Barnes how to climb the trees and select
the fittest nuts for the purpose. Thus the latter, to his immense
delight, what with constant exercise and absence of
&quot;nips,&quot; found himself losing fat and gaining muscle.
Inclined to corpulence, his greatest bugbear had long been what he
called his &quot;bingie,&quot; and to see not only this subsiding,
but to find that he could do a mile run after a pig without getting
winded, made the detective feel as if the days of his youth had
been renewed.</p>
<p>Two months passed, and one morning at sunrise Brown sighted the
first sail that had approached in all that time. It was a topsail
schooner, evidently arrived during the night, and now lying nearly
becalmed not more than half a mile away.</p>
<p>The two men made a fire on the beach, and running round to the
nearest point and waving the remnants of their shirts, soon had the
satisfaction of seeing the vessel lower a boat, which at once
pulled through the entrance in the reef.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; asked a man in the stern-sheets, as she lay
off some score of yards. &quot;What do you want? And where's Ruggy
Jim?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do we want!&quot; exclaimed Barnes, indignantly.
&quot;Why, to be taken away from this place, o' course. What d'ye
think? Haven't we been Robinson Crusoeing long enough to please
you? And as for 'Ruggy,' why, I expect that's the gent we buried
some time ago. Come along and let's get on board.&quot;</p>
<p>The five Kanakas who composed the boat's crew showed all their
teeth at this, whilst the white man laughed and shook his head,
saying, &quot;No, thanks, we've got no use for beach-combers aboard
the <i>Lass o' Gowrie</i>. That island belongs to a fellow 'way up
north in Oahu. His boat comes round regularly, and you'll be able
to explain your business to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I tell you,&quot; shouted Barnes, &quot;that I want to
get away. I'm a detective officer in the service of the New South
Wales Government. I see 'Sydney' on your boat's stern. And by
Heaven, if you don't take us, I'll make it hot for you when I do
get home!&quot; And in his excitement he capered wildly along the
beach, an extraordinary figure of flapping rags held together by
coir-sennit, and wearing slippers made of the same material, whilst
his hat was formed of native mat after the fashion of a
sou'-wester.</p>
<p>&quot;And who's the other chap?&quot; suddenly asked the man,
pointing to Brown, who sat silently awaiting events.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, that's the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;person I went to
'Frisco for, and was bringing home in the <i>Humboldt</i> when she
washed us overboard,&quot; replied Barnes. &quot;And now I call
upon you in the Queen's name to assist me. If you don't, I'll bet
you'll be sorry for it if I ever catch you in Sydney.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The deuce!&quot; exclaimed the other, staring open-eyed
and mouthed. &quot;If you're Barnes and the other cove's the 'Toff
Bird' I reckon that alters things. You've been given up this long
time. Why, I do believe we've got some papers aboard with your
lives and pictures in 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt,&quot; replied Barnes, grimly; &quot;packs o'
lies and libels! However, here I am, and here's
the&mdash;er&mdash;'Toff Bird.' Now, in the Queen's name, once
more, are you going to take us or are you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I must ask the skipper,&quot; said the other, gazing
in respectful admiration at Brown. &quot;Give way, boys!&quot; and,
the Kanakas bending to their oars, off went the boat back to the
schooner.</p>
<p>Its stay there, however, was short. And this time the captain
himself came ashore. He was a quiet, elderly Sydney native, who
already had their story at his fingers' ends, and at once
recognised Barnes and agreed to give them a passage.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h3>ON BOARD THE &quot;ALASKA.&quot;</h3>
<p>As Chinese Jimmie, one of the bedroom stewards of the mail
steamer <i>Alaska</i>, concisely put it, there was &quot;melly hell
play up topside this boat.&quot; She was crowded with passengers,
all, to again quote Jimmie, &quot;first chop 'cep' one
fellow&mdash;no gammon&quot;: and all bound for &quot;Home&quot;
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Australia and New Zealand. To mention only a few
of the distinguished tourists in charge of Captain Roberts on this
especial trip, there were the Duke and Duchess of Plinlimmon
(<i>n&eacute;e</i> Chitter of Chicago), Lord John Wardour, an
elderly aristocrat on his travels; the Grenfell H. Joneses (oil);
the Stoep van Boers (New York Six Hundred); the Pullman J. Boggses
(railways); together with the whole of the celebrated Crystal
Palace Opera Company.</p>
<p>Try and imagine the commotion, then, amongst these fine people
when, a couple of days after leaving Honolulu, it was discovered
that all, or, at any rate, the best portion, of their jewellery was
missing!</p>
<p>As usual on each trip, the <i>Alaska's</i> passengers had been
directed to place their valuables in the ship's strong room,
otherwise her owners would accept no responsibility. So the
Plinlimmon family diamonds, the celebrated Grenfell H. Joneses
pearls, the priceless Boggses emeralds and rubies, the historic
opal necklace of the Van Boers, in addition to many other less
celebrated gems, including those owned by the ladies of the opera
company, were given over to the care of the purser for safe
keeping.</p>
<p>Contrary to the usual custom in most British mail-boats, the
captain of the American-Colonial <i>Alaska</i> held the only key to
the strong room. Nor was there any duplicate. And every Saturday
afternoon it was his custom to visit the big steel chamber with the
purser, and see that all was secure. On the very first occasion of
carrying out this duty after leaving Honolulu it was discovered
that the shelves were swept as bare as a tooth of every article
except a garnet necklace belonging to Madame Francesca Perdita
(soprano), which the thief had apparently declined to accept at its
owner's description of &quot;ruby.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Captain Roberts nearly had an apoplectic fit when he
realized the terrible thing that had happened to him. And there was
nobody with whom to share the responsibility. Nor, if any purpose
could have been served by so doing, was there any possibility of
keeping the matter secret, as some of the passengers had made
application for their jewels to appear with at a fancy ball that
very night. So that, presently, the scene in the <i>Alaska's</i>
saloon fully justified Chinese Jimmie's archaic criticism.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird06.jpg"
width="419" height="500"></p>
<p>As for the men, they took refuge in the smoke-room whilst the
captain was being baited below. And the only soul to take his part
was the young and pretty newly-made duchess&mdash;also one of the
heaviest losers.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said she, to the clamouring crowd, &quot;give
the man a rest, can't you? What's the use of your all making such a
song about the things? That won't bring 'em back, will it? Let up
awhile, and try get the hang of the contract before you drive the
Cap. clean off his chump. Here, Duke,'' she cried to her husband,
who was in their state-room, &quot;you go with the captain and get
that old Wardour and a couple of others and try and thrash out
who's the smarty. You can bet there's some swell snide amongst us;
and we'll have to fix him. Take it from me, I ain't going to lose
those stones if I can help; but it's no use raising a bobbery and
doing nothing, only break the skipper up worse'n he is
already.&quot;</p>
<p>The Duke, a pale, an&aelig;mic-looking, young-old man, to whom
the Chitter millions had come just in the nick of time to keep him
out of the Bankruptcy Court, obediently stepped forward, and taking
the captain's arm led him away from the raging babel of
reproachings, sobbings, and wailings of which he had formed the
objective centre.</p>
<p>At the council presently held in the chartroom Lord Wardour was
the first to propose offering a reward, putting his name down at
once for fifty pounds. As he very truly observed, it was of little
use attempting more radical methods until all others had failed. A
search, for instance, amongst some four hundred people would pretty
surely be futile; might also only have the effect of frightening
the thief into dropping his booty overboard. The reward, he
thought, should be offered unconditionally. Probably the thief
would be found amongst the stewards or other saloon servants; and
he would be but too glad to get rid of the plunder for a round
sum.</p>
<p>Pullman J. Boggs, on the contrary, was all for drastic
measures&mdash;threats and a thorough searching&mdash;first of all
the three classes, then the quarters of the crew and firemen. But,
after a lot of talk, the majority came round to Lord Wardour's
views, and it was determined to offer a reward of &pound;500, which
was subscribed on the spot&mdash;the Duke giving half the sum. Then
the key of the strong room was handed round for inspection, the
captain explaining that, to the best of his belief, it had never
been out of his possession&mdash;at least, he had not missed it.
And as those gentlemen present were aware&mdash;having often seen
him doing so when they honoured his state-room with their presence
o' nights for a quiet game of euchre&mdash;it was his invariable
custom to take the key out of his desk and place it beneath his
pillow, always locking it up again in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; remarked Lord Wardour, amidst laughter,
&quot;seems to me to narrow down the inquiry somewhat.&quot;</p>
<p>His lordship was a man apparently well past middle age, whose
thick brown hair looked as if it had been sprinkled with flour,
some of which had stuck on in patches; his heavy moustache, too,
was much greyer on one side than the other, whilst out of a yellow,
bilious face a pair of dark eyes peered through gold-rimmed
spectacles. He walked with a slight limp, and it was rumoured that,
although in sole possession of a deck cabin, he was comparatively a
poor man. Also that he had passed much of his time in the East,
which fact was held to be accountable for the way in which he
treated his bedroom steward, Chinese Jimmie, whom he swore at
incessantly, and had once or twice even struck for some alleged
carelessness. Naturally, Jimmie resented this sort of thing and
complained to the purser. But as the &quot;darned Chow&quot; was
only working his passage he got no redress. And to someone who had,
out of mere curiosity, inquired the reason for his lordship's harsh
treatment of the &quot;boy,&quot; he explained succinctly and
satisfactorily, &quot;Because I do hate a dam Chinky!&quot; Which
statement, voicing that of all the Americans on board, met with
especial approval as emanating from a member of the effete and
prejudiced British aristocracy.</p>
<p>But, of course, all those minor incidents that bulk so big in
daily shipboard life completely lost their interest in face of this
last disaster, and people spoke of nothing else whatever during
their waking moments. Even the firemen, coming off duty, wet and
grimy, mockingly flourished their sweat-rags, and with much
grimacing roared hoarsely to each other:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, Bill, what did yer do with them jools?&quot;
&quot;Now, Tom, fork out them dimons I seen yer tryin' on t'other
night!&quot;</p>
<p>The seamen, too, especially the quartermasters, whose duty
called them amongst the passengers, grew excited over the business,
and could be heard discussing it at every opportunity. Then when
the notice of the reward appeared the excitement became
intensified, and to each man's mind, fore and aft, it seemed as
though his neighbour watched him.</p>
<p>&quot;You can bet all you're worth, Duke,&quot; remarked his
little wife, shrewdly, &quot;that this is a put-up job, and that
the smarty who worked at it ain't such a wonderful ways off rubbin'
elbows against us every time we sit down to feed. Who used to go to
the captain's room card-playin' o' nights 'sides
yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the Duke, rather maliciously,
&quot;pretty well half-a-dozen of us, I think, and amongst them
certainly all the gilt-edged American crowd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And your aristocratic friend, Lord Wardour, I
reckon,&quot; added his wife, sharply. &quot;I can't size up that
chap nohow. Only I fancy that anyone who took him on face value'd
get most almightily left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh, Mattie,&quot; said the Duke, kissing her&mdash;he
had not married altogether for the bacon-curing
dollars&mdash;&quot;Wardour's all right. There's a whole clan of
'em in Shropshire where he come's from. Besides, my dear, if this
is the work of a practised hand, as you seem to think, might he not
be found amongst the officers as likely as amongst the passengers?
You must remember they all more or less have access to the
captain's room through the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the Duchess, &quot;I'm game to stake
heavy that the joker, if he ever turns up, will be one of your
especial clique.&quot;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h3>SNARED.</h3>
<p>&quot;There's a schooner on the port bow, sir,&quot; said the
mate of the <i>Alaska</i>, entering the captain's cabin one
forenoon with the signalbook in his hand. &quot;Reckon she wants us
to stop. Made her number&mdash;<i>Lass o' Gowrie</i>&mdash;of
Sydney&mdash;and hoisted the 'urgent' signal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied the captain, who looked weary and
out of sorts, &quot;you can go quarter-speed up to her; I'll be on
deck in a minute.&quot; But before the <i>Alaska</i> approached
near enough to speak her the schooner had a boat in the water
making rapidly for the steamer.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird07.jpg"
width="600" height="471"></p>
<p>And presently, on board the latter, when the news got about as
to the identity of the two fresh passengers, the story of whose
supposed loss and all that had gone before was, of course, familiar
to everyone, even the great jewel robbery had to take a back seat
for a while as a topic of argument and wonder.</p>
<p>Captain Roberts at once had a large berth in the second saloon
allotted to the pair; also, before the <i>Lass o' Gowrie</i> filled
on her course again, the skipper had given Barnes a full history of
his loss and implored him to use all his skill in discovering the
thief.</p>
<p>But at the end of a week's questioning, cross-examination, and
general ferreting, all the detective could do was to advise
doubling the reward.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a rum go altogether!&quot; he remarked, irritably, to
Brown, who, with the moustache and beard he had allowed to grow
whilst on the island, looked a very different man to the one who
had left San Francisco. &quot;Somebody's got the things planted all
right,&quot; continued the detective, &quot;and I've a good mind to
try a thorough personal search.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'll most likely lose them if you do,&quot; replied the
other. &quot;What will you give me if I tell you who was the
thief?&quot;</p>
<p>Barnes stared at this, and remarked, meaningly, &quot;Well, at
least it can't be the 'Toff Bird' this time, although it certainly
is clean and clever enough for his work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the same,&quot; replied Brown, laughing, &quot;I
fancy, somehow, that gentleman has had a finger in the pie; and
also that I can help you to put your hand upon him, if I
please.&quot;</p>
<p>Such was the anxiety and scrambling on board to interview and
gaze upon the supposed notorious murderer and burglar, that Brown,
who appeared nothing loth to satisfy public curiosity, had been
kept very busy almost from the moment of his arrival.</p>
<p>The detective, by this time, concerned himself little about his
prisoner. They had been so long together and fallen so well into
each other's ways, that for days Barnes appeared quite to forget
their respective relations as warder and criminal. Occasionally, as
just now, he allowed a reference to the fact to escape him. But
Brown only laughed and continued, &quot;Well, old man, I want to do
you a good turn, and I think you won't be far wrong if you mark
down this person as the one you want to get hold of,&quot; and he
pointed to Lord Wardour's name on the list of passengers he had
been consulting.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you've never even seen him,&quot; protested Barnes,
contemptuously; &quot;he's about the only man on the ship that
hasn't been near you. I know that much, at any rate. And he's given
me every possible help in this business during the last
week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shouldn't wonder,&quot; replied the other, drily.
&quot;However, there's my tip. Take it or leave it, as you please.
I might tell you more, but then, you know, neither you nor anybody
else would believe me.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese Jimmie was sorely puzzled. One morning,
brushing the carpet of Lord Wardour's cabin, he had picked up a
minute fragment of torn gold&mdash;an incident which, under the
circumstances, to his comprehension, quickened by a very lively
feeling of hate, seemed more than suspicious. Still, it would not
do to make any mistake. His first idea had been to show the thing
to the detective. On second thoughts he resolved to play detective
himself, helped in his determination by the doing of a little sum
that turned &pound;500 sterling into dollars, and represented to
him a huge fortune. But it was a big risk, and Jimmie took it,
quite understanding such to be the case. The cabin Wardour had
secured was a large one, containing two berths, of which he
occupied the lower, whilst the upper was filled with a
miscellaneous collection of clothes, dirty linen, etc. Under this
Jimmie late that same night burrowed till only an eye was visible.
His lordship never retired before twelve o'clock; and he trusted to
chance to make good his retreat towards morning. Something seemed
to tell him that if discovered his days were numbered. Still, he
knew the occupant of the cabin rarely disturbed the pile of odds
and ends accumulated during the passage, and covered by which he
could see everything that took place. Also he knew that a meeting
was even now being held in the smoke-room to determine whether or
not&mdash;the reward having failed&mdash;a search of all
passengers' effects should be instituted. Therefore he chose this
special night.</p>
<p>Untroubled with nerves, Jimmie's heart nevertheless beat a
little quicker as the man he hated and suspected at last entered,
locked the door behind him, and turned on the electric light. Then
drawing a solid leather portmanteau from under the lower bunk he
opened it with a Chubb key attached to a steel chain that he took
from his pocket. From between the folds of an old mackintosh and
some soiled sheets a long, black, opaque eye glared hungrily. Many
a time since the discovery of that bit of ragged gold the eye's
owner had itched to ransack the inside of that heavy flat box. At
last! Sitting on the couch that ran along one side of the cabin,
his lordship threw the lid back and drew forth a small, round,
metal box. The eye winked with excitement. Then, throwing off his
coat, the man took up his position in front of the
looking-glass&mdash;the eye noticing as he walked that all sign of
limp had vanished. Opening the box a pungent odour spread over the
berth, tickling Jimmie's nostrils and forcing him to cram a lump of
dirty sheet in his mouth to prevent a sneeze. Then the man dabbed
his hair here and there with a sort of ointment from the box,
paying careful attention, the watcher noticed, to the grey patches,
after which he sponged it thoroughly in water. He then, taking off
his glasses, critically inspected his face. Then, uncorking a
bottle of yellowish liquid, he applied the contents carefully with
a brush to his cheeks, forehead, and chin, muttering as he
worked.</p>
<p>&quot;Curse the luck!&quot; the by this time disgusted Jimmie,
understanding nothing, heard him say. &quot;To think that, after
all, they should have turned up again in such a fashion. It was
worth a fortune to me to have got rid of the 'Toff Bird ' and
t'other fellow in one act. Hard lines, that's what I call it.
However,&quot; and he grinned as he spoke, &quot;old Barnes was
duty bound to catch somebody, I suppose. The chap that bought the
ring, of course&mdash;Brown, he gammoned his name was. As if I
didn't know! Well, I don't think he'll recognise the seller in 'his
lordship!' But what a mug he must have been to let Barnes lumber
him like that! Won't there be a row when they find out they've made
such a bloomin' mull?&quot; And the speaker chuckled heartily at
his own reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>By now Jimmie's vision of the &pound;500 had vanished. His only
thought was to get away unperceived and kick himself. He also
wanted to sneeze worse than ever. The pungent, penetrating,
chemical odour still titillated his nose, and repression was
causing him to suffer acutely. He had shut the watching eye, when a
sharp clicking made him re-open it. And what he saw put new power
of endurance into his nerves.</p>
<p>His lordship held in his hands a diamond bracelet, and plying a
pair of nippers was with practised skill extracting the stones,
flashing as he turned them in the electric light. Close to him lay
a broad belt of stout flannel that he had just taken off. It
contained many small pockets that bulged. And Jimmie needed no
information as to their contents. Very rapidly the worker cut and
snipped until the diamonds, six in all, were freed from their
setting. Then, dropping them into one of the compartments of the
belt, he took a needle and thread and stitched the mouth up. Then
muttering, &quot;They may search as much as they like now!&quot; he
made as though to fasten it around his waist again. But his eye
falling on the torn and cut gold, he laid the belt on the couch,
gathered up all the pieces, wrapped them in paper, and putting the
parcel in the pocket of his pyjama coat, lit a cigar, opened the
door, and stepped on deck.</p>
<p>Hardly waiting for him to disappear, Jimmie leaped like a flash
from his lair and snatched the precious parcel. But at that moment
the long-repressed sneeze burst forth with a dreadful piercing
sound that echoed high above the wash of water and thump of the
engines. He darted at the door, threw it wide, and was actually
over the sill when a pair of strong hands, gripping his throat,
forced him back into the cabin, and a voice hoarse with rage
muttered in his ear:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you clever beggar! Now, I'll kill you quietly and
chuck you overboard, too!&quot;</p>
<p>The yellow face grew black, and the narrow black sunken eyes
came out of their sockets in an appalling fashion as the man,
tightening his clutch, and intent only on finishing his work,
jammed the Chinese silently, grimly, on to the settee. Then all at
once Jimmie remembered.</p>
<p>And ceasing to claw futilely at the rigid arms that throttled,
he dropped his hand under his loose jumper, and, drawing his knife,
struck with all his remaining strength deep between rib and hip.
Instantly a change came over the flushed, dark face and the fierce
eyes staring into his own; the iron grip relaxed, and Jimmie,
tearing himself loose, drew a long, choking breath as the other,
groaning, and coughing up blood, sank to his knees on the
floor.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bird08.jpg"
width="407" height="500"></p>
<p>For a few minutes Jimmie could do nothing but pant; then,
recovering somewhat, he snatched up the belt, already in part
stained crimson, and, without another glance at the figure bowed
against the couch, he rushed on deck and along it and up the steps
of the bridge, whence, eluding the grip of the officer of the
watch, he darted into the captain's room and shook him as he lay in
his cot and flourished his treasure, crying aloud, &quot;All li,
sah, me catchee! He try chokee me. No can do! Me stickee allee same
pig. You savee me catchee dollar all li, sah?&quot;</p>
<p>The wounded man lived for nearly two days, during most of which
time he alternately jeered at the unhappy Barnes and cursed Jimmie
for spoiling what he averred was one of his finest efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;And what made you take my title?&quot; asked Brown on one
occasion. &quot;Wasn't it enough to land me in all this trouble
without adding to the obligation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the other, with a grin, &quot;it was
just a matter of chance. I saw you once a long time ago in
Auckland, when you were staying at Government House there. Then
when I sold you the ring up in Seattle, although you gammoned plain
Brown, I recognised you at once. Well, then, I heard you were
nabbed; then, after a while, came the news that you and good old
Barnsey there were drowned. So, why, as I meant to work this Yankee
boat for all she was worth, I thought I couldn't do better than do
it as a lord&mdash;especially when the chances were that very few
people except myself knew what had become of the said lord. See?
But you've got a rattling good action against the Government for
damages; and as for Barnes, he'll probably get the sack. That was a
messed up job at Bezil and Carat's. So long! I don't feel, somehow,
as if I could do any more talk.&quot;</p>
<p>No case of Brown or Wardour <i>v.</i> the Crown, however, came
into any Colonial court of law. The matter was settled quietly by
arbitration. And nobody for certain appeared to be aware of the
exact amount awarded. Still, the hole made in the Treasury account
with the Bank of Carpentaria must have been very considerable.
&quot;Heaven knows, Jack,&quot; remarked his lordship afterwards to
his cousin, Captain D'Arcy, &quot;that although I wanted money
badly enough, I didn't, as some people kindly hint, lay myself out
to take advantage of the mistake. I told the beggars the truth, and
that I was merely a poor devil of a titled Englishman travelling
around under his family name. But when I saw how cursedly cocksure
they were, the notion entered my mind to make them pay pretty
dearly for the tune they danced me to. I have done so. And
presently I'll give up wandering and go home and settle at Mount
Wardour. I'm able to raise the mortgage now, and then have money to
spare. Barnes comes with me. They made a scapegoat of him, but I
can find him something better to do over yonder.&quot;</p>

<p>Harry Richards and Bob, his brother, had just finished a good
year on Garuda Station, good, that is to say, in a financial sense.
Working like horses and living like blacks, they had put up over
thirty miles of fencing, besides getting through a few blocks of
ring-barking. Thus, just before Christmas, they had earned a very
respectable cheque, and on the strength of it the pair determined
to put into execution a long-talked-of, long-thought-of
plan&mdash;nothing less, in fact, than a visit to the capital. Both
of them bred and brought up in the outer bush, completely ignorant
of the world that lay beyond the little township thirty miles
distant from the station upon which they had worked for so long,
the undertaking seemed to them one of no small moment and
consequence.</p>
<p>Primarily, they had resolved to go &quot;as they were,&quot;
their only preparations consisting of washing an extra pair of
&quot;moles&quot; and a couple of cotton shirts, and rolling the
lot up in a blue blanket. But on the station storekeeper
representing to them that in such guise they would probably be
arrested by the first policeman as vagrants, they allowed
themselves to be persuaded into buying&mdash;at station
rates&mdash;a slop suit of tweed each and two little hard black
hats. The former bore many vestiges of &quot;silver fish;&quot; the
latter were hopelessly out of date&mdash;and all were palpable
misfits. Stiff colored shirts, and elastic-side boots three sizes
too small completed their misery. But the store keeper pronounced
them &quot;regular toffs, and fit to do the block;&quot; and though
only dimly guessing what he meant, they took some comfort from his
verdict. In their working clothes Bob and Harry were a strapping
pair of young natives, broad-chested, and lean-flanked, all bone,
muscle, and sinew, sharp-featured, keen-eyed; ignorant of most
things; suspicious; without any pronounced vices or virtues;
orphans&mdash;the product of a Scotch shepherd and a native-born
bushwoman. They could neither read nor write; but they possessed a
certain inheriter paternal shrewdness, of which the Garuda
storekeeper had many times vainly endeavored to get the better when
measuring up their work. Only in the last deal had he ever been
able to score. Also, he had transformed them into a pair of
scarecrows.</p>
<p>In common with the majority of Australian natives, the brothers
were endowed with more than an average share of stolidity. It took,
indeed, all that was presently to happen to them to make them show
visible astonishment. Thus, when at the terminus the engine came
shrieking and panting into the station, they merely swore, and
nudged each, other, although it was their first sight of a
locomotive. The sum demanded for their fares appeared an enormous
extortion. A quarter of a mile of fencing would hardly cover it. To
the dismay of the other passengers, the first thing they did was to
take off their boots, and with long sighs of relief expose their
naked feet. They had, perhaps fortunately, withstood all persuasion
as to socks; and in their new footgear was no room for the
&quot;Prince Alberts,&quot; or bandages of old cottons shirts, they
usually wore inside their huge No. 10 bluchers.</p>
<p>Some wag had told them that if they once lost sight of their
carriage before it arrived at its destination they, would
infallibly be left behind. By the same joker's advice they had laid
in a big stock of provisions&mdash;bread and cheese, and
beer&mdash;contained in an immense old carpet bag that had belonged
to the storekeeper's grandfather, and that now served as larder and
wardrobe for the pair. By other travellers their proceedings were
watched with eager, subdued interest; subdued, because doubtful how
far chaff or protest would be safe with the owners of those great
bony, scarred, hairy hands and muscular arms already causing seams
to burst and gape in the ancient coats.</p>
<p>But at last the long five-hundred mile journey was at an end,
and, stiff and bewildered, Harry and Bob were deposited upon the
Redfern platform. Presently, following a stream of people, they
found themselves in a tram, out of which they never thought of
stirring till it reached its journey's end at Bent-street.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack the Sailor,&quot; bullock-driver at Garuda, had told
them of an &quot;A1 tip-top place to stop at&quot; in
Kent-street..</p>
<p>&quot;Say, mate,&quot; asked Bob of the guard, as they alighted,
&quot;is this Kent-street?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it ain't,&quot; replied the guard, grinning
delightedly, as he took the pair in at a glance, &quot;but if you
keeps on to the Quay an' then turns to the left, an' keeps on
agyne, you'll come to it in time. What 'otel might you be puttin'
up at?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Number 399,&quot; replied Bob, slowly, consulting a grimy
slip of paper upon which the figures were very legibly printed.</p>
<p>&quot;Grosvenor, that is,&quot; said the guard. &quot;All right,
you cawn't mike a mistake. Keep to the left till you sees it in
front o' ye;&quot; and, jumping on to his tram, off he went.</p>
<p>&quot;Rum languidge these blokes 'ave down, 'ere,&quot; remarked
Harry.</p>
<p>&quot;D&mdash;rum,&quot; replied his brother, &quot;I'd two
minds to punch that feller in the jaw fer grinnin' like 'e did.
What's them things in the lagoon yonder? steamhers an' ships, I
s'pose, same as I heard Jack tell on oncest or twice!&quot;</p>
<p>They had by this time come out on to Circular Quay, and stood
there open-mouthed and eyed, staring at the scene, impressed, but
lacking words, bar an oath or two, to register its effect upon
them.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll find the Three Nines a all right shop to camp
in,&quot; had said Jack the Sailor, &quot;I've stopped there often,
years ago, when I uster ship outer Sydney. Ole Mother Ruckles kep'
it in them days. P'raps she's pegged out now. The 'ouse 'll be
there all the same, though. It ain't a swell place, o' course. But
there's better tucker an' less bugs than in any o' the rest o' the
shops 'roun' that district. Cheap too; an' lively. You bet! You'll
see life there, my sons, an' won't 'ave no time to grow
blue-mouldy. You ask any sailor-man where the Three Nines
is&mdash;one less'n a thousan', you savee. 'Owever, I'll put it
down, so's you shan't make any mistake; an', if so be's the old
woman's kickin' yet, just you tell 'er as I sent you.&quot;</p>
<p>But when, after much wandering and questioning, the pair at
length reached the grimy door of No. 999, they found no hostess,
but were received by a low-set, black-browed customer, who curtly
informed them that Mother Ruckles had long ago ceased to kick; but
that if they wanted board and lodging, and could pay for it, why
they would be made welcome to the best of everything in Sydney. Not
sailors, o' course. That was easy seen. Oh, bushmen, were they?
Why, then, they'd come to the right place for comfort. That house
made a specialty of the class. Did be know &quot;Jack the
Sailor?&quot; Well, he should smile.</p>
<p>Actually, he did more, he laughed outright and loudly. So, too,
did three or four other squalid looking individuals sitting on
dirty benches in the dirty verandah. Everybody, it seemed, knew
Jack, and loved him, and wanted to know all about him, and were
willing to drink his health as soon as the newcomers felt inclined
to pay their footing. Which, in due course, they did, but
grudgingly, because, according to bush ethics, a dozen drinks was
&quot;coming it too strong for one shout.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Tom Caine, &quot;Black Tom,&quot; as he was generally
called about the shipping, made much of his new and curious guests,
and that very night gave a &quot;shivoo&quot; in their honor
attended by many Kent-street nymphs, the like of whom never in
their wildest dreams could they have conceived. An American darkey
played the concertina, whilst , a Dane beat an old piano, and a
Greek tootled on the flute, and the fun was fast and furious. And
Bob and Harry, each with a nymph on his knee and a glass at his
elbow, realised that, indeed, as Jack the Sailor had prophesied,
they were seeing life in Sydney. But the pair were not popular.
They took their fun without abandon. Even in the most unrestrained
flights of the jovial Company to which they had been admitted they
preserved a saturnine gravity that jarred on the happy-go-lucky
outward and homeward bounders that frequently Black Tom's. Perhaps
this was due to some faint strain of Calvinism inherited from the
Scotch shepherd. Nor were they at all free with the money that it
was now known Bob carried in the double waistband of his trousers,
and that the nymphs were for ever trying openly and secretly, but
vainly, to get at. Nor did they drink as one should when on
pleasure bent; kept their heads, too, when their friends were
stretched out &quot;paralytic;&quot; more than once had been heard
to say in their peculiar language that &quot;no man who couldn't
chew tacks would ever get upsides&quot; with them, and altogether
disgusted Black Tom, who had promised himself, as he put it,
&quot;a real soft snap with the busbies.&quot; And they bulked so
tall and lithe and strong that nobody felt inclined to meddle with
them. Nor ever had Tom, even on the hungriest homeward bounder,
seen such, appetites as the twain possessed. They stuck together,
too, like the Siamese twins. When ever you saw Harry, Bob was
alongside him or within call.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain't gettin' very much change out er us, are they,
Bob?&quot; chuckled Harry, &quot;if we are chummies down
'ere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor, muchy lot, these city blokes,&quot; assented the
younger brother, with a grin. &quot;An' them sailors don't know
enough to keep warm. An' Black Tom's as soft as any of 'em. I took
im down for three quid at euchre last night. Bust me if I don't
believe we cud soon live 'ere on our earnin's! An' them chaps at
Garuda blowin' 'bout spielers an' forties, and all sorts of fairy
tales! Yah, let 'em try to gammon us!&quot;</p>
<p>But alas for the pride that goeth before a fall!</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;Bob!&quot; groaned Harry, miserably, as he lifted an
aching head, and stared around him with bulging, amazed eyes.
&quot;I'm 'ere, Harry,&quot; moaned Bob, from the opposite side,
&quot;least ways my 'ead is! Where are we? In hell, or where.&quot;
But Bob made no reply. He was busy taking in his surroundings. He
lay in a bunk, one of a double tier that ran round a place
something like the Garuda men's hut, only much smaller. On the
walls hung clothes that swung and rustled; chests were lashed to
the floor at intervals; In the dim light he could see his brother's
white face peering at him over the side of the bunk opposite. But
the motion&mdash;the horrible, puzzling, sickening motion&mdash;now
a slow roll sideways, then an abrupt jerk into the air, followed
immediately by a downward plunge! And the noises&mdash;the creaking
and groaning&mdash;all awed him; mingled as they were with other
sounds of wind and water roaring and swirling not far away! Harry
had suggested hell. But hell was hot. He knew that much. But this
place was cold, if anything. Suddenly his eye caught sight of,
under his head, the big carpet bag. When he saw it last in their
room at the Three Nines it had been stuffed full of purchases
picked up at street stalls and in &quot;Paddy's Market.&quot; Now
it was collapsed and empty. With a sharp spasm of recollection, he
felt the double waistband of his trousers. The patch he had so
laboriously sewn on to plant their money in had been cut away, and
the forty odd &pound;1-notes had disappeared. With a howl he sprang
up, only to be knocked back again by a severe blow from a sharp
iron beam.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, you&mdash;&mdash;loafers!&quot; all at once
exclaimed a sharp, stern voice. &quot;How long are you going to lie
back, eh? Don't ye think it's about a fair thing? Come along, now;
show a leg!&quot; And, so saying, a tall, broad, black bearded man
grabbed Bob's leg and fairly hauled him out of his bunk on to a
chest, thence on to the floor and along through an open door into
the air. Returning, he performed the same operation for Harry.
&quot;There now,&quot; remarked the man threateningly, as the pair
staggered to their feet, and stared around them, dumb with
amazement, &quot;None o' your shammin'! Turn to and do your duty,
and you'll be all right. But by G&mdash;d, if you don't you'll be
darn wrong! Bosun,&quot; he shouted, &quot;lead the hose along this
way!&quot;</p>
<p>On every side, as far as the eye could reach, stretched more
water than the brothers had deemed it possible the world contained.
It was early morning, a bright breezy morning in the Southern
Ocean, and the white horses flung their manes merrily to a strong,
cool westerly. Overhead towered pile upon pile of bellying canvas
to heights that made their aching eyes reel to follow it. At every
turn strange sights met their gaze; objects they had no names for;
articles whose uses they could not even guess at. Under foot the
heavy planks seemed striving incessantly to throw them, as they
staggered helplessly, and clutched at ropes, and slipped and slid
on trembling legs, like two newly-born calves. All at once men
appeared; much the same kind of men as they had mated with at the
&quot;Three Nines;&quot; they dragged something along with them;
another minute, and a great stream of cold salt water played
remorselessly upon their bodies as, breathless and drenched, they
slipped into the lee-scuppers. Such was the brothers' introduction
to the ship British Empire, from Newcastle to Valparaiso, coal
laden, which, having put into Sydney for a new topmast, had there
lost a couple of her hands. These Black Tom had undertaken to
supply, and had done so in thoroughly traditional style.</p>
<p>For a long time the officers of the Empire would not believe but
that Bob and Harry were &quot;shamming green.&quot; And during this
period of incredulity their lot was a hard one indeed, and kicks
far more plentiful than halfpence, both fore and aft. In the
natural course of things they would have retaliated savagely, but
their novel and bewildering surroundings dazed and cowed them;
whilst their stupendous inferiority to the smallest and weakest of
the men whom ashore they had regarded as &quot;soft,&quot; put any
attempt at self-assertion out of the question. Even the very ship's
boys abused, them with impunity as they scrubbed and scoured,
waited upon the inmates of the fo'c'sle, day and night were obliged
to hold themselves ready at everybody's beck and call, thankful for
the few rags that could be spared them from the seamen's own scanty
outfits. One desire animated both their souls, was almost the only
subject upon which, they conversed&mdash;revenge upon Black Tom
should they ever be lucky enough to return to their native land
again. What shape this should take there was no uncertainty about
in their minds. They would kill him. And how their half savage
hearts yearned with inarticulate yearnings for the wild freedom of
the bush again; once more to have the scent of the flowering scrub
in their nostrils, to hear the screaming of the crimson-breasted
galahs feeding on the nardoo flats; feel the grip of the western
soil underfoot, the western sun overhead, and know that they were
slaves no longer! No longer despised and bullied
&quot;bushies,&quot; at the mercy of all hands on this most
grotesque and restless fabric, condemned, apparently, to wander for
ever the merest sport of the elements, and of whose complicated
working they had been unable to master the simplest detail! But,
free once again, free to wreak vengeance upon their betrayer, and
then, if needs be, suffer the penalty. Thus they thought their
bitter thoughts and cursed their luck, and sulked with a sour, dour
sulkiness that kept their noses to the grindstone more than
otherwise might have been the case. And what the end of their story
would have been it is hard to say, but that the Fates intervened,
and in their usual high-handed manner took part in the game.</p>
<p>Thus, one night, when nearly half-way across the South Pacific,
the Empire was run into by a big cargo boat bound to New Zealand
from South American ports.</p>
<p>Bob and Harry, hearing the smash, ran up, thinking that perhaps
at last they had reached the longed for land. But all they could
see was a dark mass grinding and cutting into their ship amidst a
babel of cries, oaths, groans, and escaping steam, whilst from
aloft yards and masts were falling and crashing with a dreadful
noise of rending steel and timber. Above their heads, and
apparently belonging to the thing that was doing all the terrible
mischief, hung a tangle of iron ropes and spars.</p>
<p>Shouting &quot;She's sinking!&quot; a man rushed past them and
began to furiously clamber and drag himself up these. Without well
knowing why, the brothers followed him.</p>
<p>They were dazed, stunned, and appalled by the fear of the
unknown and the dreadful noises of the night as they swung and
swarmed up the wire stays shouting and yelling, and helping and
pulling each other with the passion of despair. Then, all at once,
they felt strong hands grasp them and lug them inboard, and heard a
voice ask, &quot;How many?&quot; and another reply, &quot;Only
three, sir, off our head-gear. And she's gone down. But the boats
may pick up more.&quot;</p>
<p>But the boats did not. Of all the Empire's company two seamen
and the despised &quot;bushies&quot; alone were saved. On board the
Monmouth Castle they were well treated. And two of the firemen
being ill their places in the stokehole were offered to Bob and
Harry as far as Auckland, and thence, if they wished, to the next
port of call, Sydney. They accepted joyfully, and worked with the
fierce energy born of long repression and endurance. They also took
the opportunity of half-killing their rescued mates&mdash;who on
the Empire had reduced tormenting them to a science. If they could
have served all those others likewise they would have been pleased.
However, they were drowned, and so now beyond their reach. As for
Black Tom&mdash;!</p>
<p>It was a lovely morning as the Castle turned in between the
Heads of Port Jackson and threaded her way slowly up the harbor.
The brothers had just come off their last shift, and were watching
the scene with a sharp, eager, anticipatory stare. Nearer inshore a
coasting steamer, up by the nose and down by the stern, was making
for her wharf. Nearly abreast of the Castle a big topsail schooner
was coming along with wind and tide; just behind her raced a
fore-and-after, both of them apparently homeward bound. As the
Castle overtook the schooner an oath from Harry drew his brother's
attention, and following the direction of his gaze he saw Black Tom
on the first vessel's fo'c's'le-head. And that he had seen and
recognised them there could be no doubt, for, as the Castle passed,
he waved his hand, and so close was he that they almost thought
they could catch the derisive grin on his dark face.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got 'im now!&quot; exclaimed Bob grimly. &quot;An'
when we've finished with 'im he won't put away no more
'bushies!'&quot;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke the schooner came up in the wind and went
about on the other tack. She was outward bound!</p>
<p>Also, when they got ashore they found that the Three Nines had
long changed hands.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;My word!&quot; exclaimed the Garuda storekeeper.</p>
<p>&quot;You fellows must have had a high old time of it! Five
months of town on a bit of a cheque like that! I wish to goodness
you'd tell the secret of how you did it.&quot;</p>
<p>But the brothers kept their mouths stubbornly shut. And they
took a long contract of fencing. Also, at every chance they got
they quarrelled and fought with Jack the Sailor until they made
Garuda too hot for him, and he left. And it was noticed that,
henceforth, on whatever station they might be they devoted all
their energies to serving any seafarers they could discover in
similar fashion.</p>

<p>When old Captain Bob Freeman, at the age of 55, &quot;gave the
sea best,&quot; and retired to a small cottage in one of the marine
suburbs of Port Endeavour, he thought that his career was ended,
and that Providence would allow him to spend the remainder of his
days in peace. But Providence was, like &quot;Brer Rabbit,&quot;
only &quot;lying low&quot; for the ancient mariner. In the
meantime, however, &quot;Cap'en Bob,&quot; as he was locally known
along the special harbor fringe on which he had made his home,
enjoyed amazingly the first spell of shore life that had been his
for over forty years.</p>
<p>The marine suburb was not exactly a St. Kilda, or a Glenelg, or
a Sandgate; not a pleasure or a health resort, but a busy
collection of shipyards, factories, and ''works&quot; of every
description bordering a stretch of water never empty of vessels;
redolent of familiar smells of tar and paint, noisy with the
incessant clamor of wrights and smiths, and alive with steam and
canvas moving to and fro athwart its surface. And here the old
sea-hawk, foregathering with others of his kind&mdash;retired
skippers and mates of small craft&mdash;formed a bowling club,
known presently as the &quot;Port Watch.&quot; The
&quot;green&quot; adjoined an hotel; and here, clad in an
outlandish, flappy hat and wonderously-hued blazer, on any bright
afternoon you might see Cap'en Bob and his fellows waddling along
the rinks&mdash;a hard-faced, white-bearded, round-backed old
crowd, solemnly taking their exercise, interspersed with many
adjournments to the bar of &quot;The Man at the Wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>And their game finished, they would sit about on benches
overlooking the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of the busy bay and talk
ships; criticise the points of the various craft entering or
departing, their rig, their build, their cargo, the passage;
differing in many points of argument, but unanimous, the whole of
them, in damning steam heartily and without reserve. Most of the
old shellbacks had, like Cap'en Bob, made what little money they
possessed in the &quot;island trade.&quot; And to judge from the
yarns they told of those days, the South Seas must have been
veritable Tom Tiddler's Ground for those who knew their
business&mdash;which business, apparently from many a hint let drop
with wink and chuckle, was not always of the most legitimate
description.</p>
<p>O' nights the &quot;Port Watch&quot; assembled in their special
room at the hotel, whose owner, himself an old sailor, took care
they should not, be disturbed whilst they smoked, drank, and played
euchre til closing-up time.</p>
<p>Now, and very suddenly, Luck or Fate or Providence&mdash;call it
what you like&mdash;began to get in its fine work on Cap'en Bob.
First, a bill backed for an old friend was dishonored; a couple of
vessels in which he had shares were wrecked, and presently, when
the old skipper had &quot;cleared up the raffle,&quot; as he put
it, and settled with his creditors, he found himself with just
&pound;100 in the world And to realise even that small sum he had
been obliged to part with the apple of his eye&mdash;his little
four-roomed cottage on Fig Tree Point, and send his old housekeeper
away.</p>
<p>The news demoralised the Port Watch. Cap'en Bob had been its
founder, and by precept and example had brought the institution up
to its present state of efficiency, and made it flourish like the
green bay tree. Domineering, quick-tempered, and masterful though
he was, his heart, as everybody knew, was in the right place; and
no one, especially a seafarer, had ever appealed in vain to his
ever-open sympathy&mdash;manifested not by words, but by purse.</p>
<p>And presently the Port Watch pulled itself together and rose to
the occasion, and called a special meeting, whilst Cap'en Bob was
away round the owners' offices looking for a billet. He had
intimated his intention of &quot;goin' fishin&quot; again the night
before at the club. &quot;It'll be a nice change,&quot; he had
said, screwing up his furrowed, gnarled, old mahogany face.
&quot;I've been too long ashore. Gettin' fat and lazy now for want
o' exercise. Bowls ain't sufficient graft for a young 'un like
me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, in course not,&quot; assented Cap'en Stagcross
gravely; &quot;I've noticed myself lately as you're runnin' to
flesh a bit. An', as you says, the change 'll be good for you. An'
some o' them fellers over in town 'll be only too glad to git a man
o' your eggsperience to run some sort o' a ship for 'em; you
bet!&quot; But at the meeting Stagcross spoke quite otherwise. He
was Cap'en Bob's senior in age, if not in service&mdash;a tall,
thin, bald man with one eye and a face like a horse, who whinnied
when he laughed, and who, it was rumored, had made money by
&quot;blackbirding&quot; when &quot;times was good down in the
Islands.&quot; And he was supposed to be very well to do, owning,
as those present were well aware, two or three snug bits of
foreshore along the bay.</p>
<p>Always Cap'en Bob and he were more or less at loggerheads, both
on the &quot;green&quot; and in the club-room. Indeed, the pair
were popularly supposed to have &quot;a down&quot; upon each other,
being able to agree on no single subject from the proper
&quot;bias&quot; of a bowl to the best way of heaving-to a
fore-and-aft rigged vessel.</p>
<p>&quot;Hem,&quot; said Stagcross, suddenly clearing his throat
for silence, &quot;Cap'en Bob's gone to look for a ship. But he
won't git one in a blue moon. We all know that. Billets aint picked
up like they was years agone. But I got a ship for him. You knows
the Dancin' Jane, well, I've a goodish big say in her&mdash;in
fact, I may say the biggest say. She's bin laid up this last few
months. Now, Brown and Company's goin' to send her down to the
Island for nig&mdash;leastways, copra, or anythin'. An' Cap'en Bob
Freeman's goin' to take charge of her. D'ye see?&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently they did, for tumblers rattled on the tables, and
hoarse roars of applause shook the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; continued the speaker, &quot;he musn't know I'm
in it, or likely bein', so to say, a bit uppish an' stubborn, now
as this stroke o' cruel bad luck's overtook him&mdash;he mightn't '
take the thing as it's meant. That's why I said Brown and
Company&mdash;or any other company&mdash;I'll fix that up. An' I'll
dock the Jane, an' I'll put six months' stores aboard of her. But
that aint enough; an' I'll want a bit of help for trade an' wages
an' such. So, perhaps&mdash;I don't s'pose I'll 'ave to more than
mention it&mdash;a sort o' tarpaulin muster now wouldn't come
amiss,&quot; and the skipper, taking his hat off its peg, placed it
in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>In a minute cheque books were produced, pen and ink called for,
and colored slips began to flutter into the hat. The Port Watch was
on its mettle; those who had no cheques just wrote the amount they
wished to give on bits of paper. When all were finished, Stagcross
counted up the sum total. It came to nearly &pound;200&mdash;an
average of something over, &pound;12 for each member.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good,&quot; said he, as he whinnied loudly with
gratification, &quot;but knowin' ye as I do, not more'n I expected.
Now, leave the rest to me. I'll manage so's he'll be thinkin' he's
workin' for owners 'stead o' on his own hook; an' beholden to any
of us. Cap'en Bob 'ud worrit his 'eart out on them terms. It's his
own show, though, all the time. An' I believe, for a man as knows
his way about the Islands is as good now almost as ever they was.
Gen'elmen, let's drink Cap'en Bob's health and success to his
trip.&quot;</p>
<p>And they did so to such purpose that Cap'en Bob, returning
nearly heartbroken from a round of shipowners' offices&mdash;at all
of which he had been told either that he was too old, or that only
foreigners were wanted&mdash;found at least half the Port Watch,
unable to take a correct departure for their homes, had been put to
bed by &quot;The Man at the Wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>In due course Cap'en Bob, to his intense delight, for he had
begun to think such an appointment out of the question, received
the offer of the Dancing Jane from the firm of Brown and Company.
And as he read the letter to the Port Watch, he stopped suddenly,
and remarked, with an accent of suspicion, &quot;By the way, Cap'en
Stagcross&quot; (they were always particular as to each other's
titles), &quot;didn't you used to have some say in the Jane? I
fancy I've heard so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mebbe, mebbe,&quot; replied the other stolidly, &quot;I've
had shares in so many on 'em. But, if I had, that's all finished
an' done with now. She's as fine a little brigantine as sails out
o' Endeavour anyway, and I wish you luck, cap'en. I'd take plenty
o' square gin an Turkey red in the trade room, if I was you;
an'&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cap'en Stagcross,&quot; returned the other severely,
&quot;it aint my first visit to them parts&mdash;no, not by scores.
An' if I didn't know what the niggers wants, nobody does; thankin'
you all the same.&quot; And Stagcross, contrary to his wont,
forbore to talk back.</p>
<p>Never were such owners as Brown and Company. They gave their new
skipper a free hand in everything, and the old man was so pleased
that he quite forgot his misfortunes in the excitement of getting
the Dancing Jane ready for sea. It had been arranged by the club
that he was to try and get a load of copra. Freight outwards there
was none offering. Steamers had taken it all. And although the
fossils of the Port Watch knew it not, it would have been almost as
easy to get a cargo of gold in Oceania as one of copra. For the
past year or so a terrible drought had smitten Polynesia, and nuts
were things of the past. Copra of any kind was worth &pound;30 per
ton at Port Endeavour, and the better nuts &pound;10 more.</p>
<p>So Cap'en Bob sailed away in the Dancing Jane, eager and
confident, with a full trade-house and carte blanche as to route
from his most obliging owners.</p>
<p>The first place he made for, having done much trade there
aforetime, was the Gilbert Group. Finding, to his dismay, that
there was scarcely a nut amongst all the many Islands, he came
back, touching at many places en route, to Samoa. There folk only
laughed at him, and told him to go home and wait for the rain. In
the Marquesas he found a few traders who, as their own vessels had
not arrived, offered to sell him a ton or so of copra for its
weight in square gin. But Cap'en Bob couldn't see it, and advised
them to wait for their own company's vessels.</p>
<p>And he began to worry and fret, and to wonder what was the best
thing to do; wishing, too, that he had gone elsewhere for these
were not the islands that he knew of old. Then all at once he
remembered Sawara, the Ambrym chief.</p>
<p>Years ago, when Sawara's village had been attacked by one of the
fierce bush tribes, eager for heads, Cap'en Bob, then in command of
a trading schooner, had practically saved the chief and his people
by interfering with Sniders on their behalf, and to such purpose
that hardly a single bushmen returned to the mountains to tell the
story of the luckless foray.</p>
<p>In his gratitude, Sawara had sworn that if the chance ever
occurred to do Cap'en Bob a good turn he would not forget it. But
shortly afterwards the old skipper had given up the sea, and had
not since visited Ambrym.</p>
<p>Now in his trouble he thought of Sawara and his promise. Of
course the chief might be long dead&mdash;and eaten; or, if alive,
he might be more inclined to make &quot;long pig&quot; of Cap'n Bob
than to keep his promise.</p>
<p>However, the skipper, although fully recognising that it was a
forlorn hope, determined to try his luck; and thus headed the
Dancing Jane north about again, until, one night, a roseate flush
in the sky told of the ever active Ambrym volcanoes.</p>
<p>Carefully avoiding the mission station, Cap'en Bob coasted along
till he came to the little bay on whose shores, hidden in a tangle
of undergrowth, lay Sawara's village. And presently the chief
himself came off, delighted apparently at recognising his old
friend who, in &quot;sandalwood talk,&quot; soon made known his
troubles, and called upon the savage too, if he could, fulfil the
pledge made in his time of need.</p>
<p>But at first Sawara shook his head. Times were bad; the drought
had been long and disastrous; there was scarcely any crop in his
plantation; what few nuts there were on the trees were
&quot;tabu,&quot; and untouchable. Still he would like to help his
old friend, if possible. And there was a way only it depended on
others as well as himself. A council meeting should be called that
night and then, well, it all depended. Meanwhile, here were pigs,
fowls, and yams for Cap'en Bob's acceptance.</p>
<p>Next morning Sawara came on board, evidently highly pleased, and
announced that the chiefs had consented to the proposal laid before
them; and, in consideration of bygone services, would let Cap'en
Bob have&mdash;of course for a fair equivalent in trade&mdash;two
seasons' crops of nuts, which they had stowed away as a standby in
time of need. Many traders, added the chief, had attempted to get
this treasure, but they had been refused. Now there were no traders
left on Ambrym at all. The last, a man-a-wee-wee visited the
village in an endeavor to discover the &quot;plant.&quot;
But&mdash;, and here Sawara stopped suddenly and turned the
subject.</p>
<p>Later, Cap'en Bob and three of his men armed to the teeth, and
very doubtful, were led by devious paths to a big cave, which as
they entered and glanced around by the light of torches, seemed to
be full of stacked cocoanuts. This was the treasury of the tribe,
when in a rare fit of prudence they had garnered their one valuable
asset.</p>
<p>Such an abnormal instance of foresight, opposed as it was to
every native tradition, astonished Cap'en Bob not a little, even
whilst blessing the notion that entered their savage heads, and
secured such a windfall for him. Without a doubt Sawara had turned
up trumps.</p>
<p>And presently the whole village became a copra factory, as the
population, seemingly eager to show its appreciation of that great
service years ago, set to work husking, splitting, and drying.
Luckily the weather kept fine, and the sun hot. Even so, it was a
long job, made longer by the smaller lots that the indefatigable
Sawara hunted up from other villages, and that kept coming in until
Cap'en Bob began to think that he would have nearly a full ship.
But of what such a haul actually meant to the apocryphal Brown, and
Company he possessed a very remote idea, never dreaming that the
gratitude of the savage was his own salvation. Indeed, he, as time
passed, waxed impartial, and hurried his departure to the extent of
leaving some partially-cured nuts behinds him.</p>
<p>But at last the Dancing Jane's anchors came up, and with an
empty trade-house and some 200 and odd tons of the finest sun-dried
copra under hatches, Cap'en Bob got away, followed for some miles
at sea by Sawara and a flotilla of farewelling canoes.</p>
<p>During the whole of the trip he had seen scarcely any vessels at
all, with the exception of a few steamers. The Pacific, so far as
canvas went, seemed to be deserted.</p>
<p>But now, half-way down to New Caledonia, the Jane fell in with
the Naulahka, labor schooner, of Waratah, and Cap'en Bob, going in
board for a yarn, was astonished to find that the other
skipper&mdash;old acquaintance though he was&mdash;frankly refused
to credit the nature of the Jane's cargo.</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said he, &quot;there ain't no copra in the
bloomin' Pacific; nor hasn't been this two years or more; an' I
should know, seein' as I was at the game till what with drought an'
tabu together the bottom fell clean out o' the trade. Last trip I
made I couldn't git more'n a couple of hundred weight. An', mind
you, Larsen an' company had a dozen stations from Tonga to the
Solomons. An' yet you goes quietly away an' gets a full
ship&mdash;by the look of her. Too thin, Cap'en Bob! But never
mind. I ain't a pryin'; an' it's no business o' mine what you're
a-carryin' of. Only don't be passin' it off as copra.&quot;</p>
<p>And not until Cap'en Bob explained in full could his brother
skipper be induced to credit the fact. Waratah and Endeavour, it
might be mentioned, were opposition ports; and, as he put it, the
captain of the Naulahka was &quot;a bit narked&quot; to think that
an Endeavour vessel should have succeeded where all the Waratah
traders had failed.</p>
<p>&quot;But what a roarin', tearin' fluke!&quot; continued the
captain of the schooner, as, having made the amende honorable, he
opened a fresh bottle of &quot;square.&quot; &quot;Brown and
Company&mdash;I thought they'd sold all their boats a year
ago&mdash;should make you a fine fat bonus for fixin' up that
nigger the way ye did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; replied Cap'en Bob, unconcernedly, &quot;it
was a bit o' luck, right enough, dropping acrost Sawara again. Only
for that, I'd ha' to come home' with a clean hold. But as for any
bonus, well, they're good owners an' liberal, an' I daresay 'll do
the right thing, as far as a fiver or so goes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A fiver!&quot; repeated the other, scornfully, &quot;they
was mugs to start ye off on such a hexpedition in the first place,
knowin' as it was perfectly hopeless; but, as by that there
almighty fluke, you got the stuff, why, I should say &pound;500 'd
be nearer the mark, seein' as they stand to clear somewhere like
&pound;8000 or &pound;9000.&quot;</p>
<p>It was now Cap'en Bob's turn to be astonished. Copra in his day
was never worth more than &pound;10 to &pound;15; and although he
might have guessed from what he had learned of late that it's value
would increase, he had no mind for such a figure as the &pound;40
per ton which his friend told him was the present market value,
delivered in Endeavour, and practically unprocurable at the
price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Port Watch was getting some what uneasy. The Jane
was long overdue. Also, having condescended to ask the outside
world for particulars, the club was annoyed to discover upon what a
useless errand it had dispatched its protege. It also remonstrated
through Stagcross with Brown and Company, who, however, only
laughed and produced Stagcross's written instructions, which, in
brief, amounted to a free hand, and no remarks. &quot;All the
same,&quot; observed the one-eyed skipper, with a touching faith,
&quot;Cap'en Bob 'll turn up all right, you'll see! A better
sailor-man don't stand! An' if there's anythin' to be had down in
them Islands he'll have it. And always, now, on the beaches at Pig
Tree Point commanding a view of the inner harbor and the signal
staff, might be seen sitting three or four old shellbacks, with
long telescopes, keeping a lookout. But the first news was that the
Jane had made her number to Nobbies.</p>
<p>&quot;Comin' down the coast with a spankin' fair wind!&quot;
exclaimed Stagcross, casting a weatherly eye aloft to the smoke of
a factory chimney. &quot;He'll be here by evening'!&quot;</p>
<p>But the Dancing Jane was in early, and before the anchor was
down Stagcross and six others of the port watch had boarded her,
and were bringing her to an unofficial berth of their own fronting
the &quot;Man at the Wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must get ashore as quick as I can afore the office
closes,&quot; said Cap'en Bob.</p>
<p>&quot;What office?&quot; asked Stagcross, signing to the mate to
let go the anchor.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Brown and Company's, of course,&quot; replied Cap'en
Bob, who had been telling his story in brief snatches.</p>
<p>&quot;D&mdash;n Brown and Company,&quot; roared Stagcross,
throwing his hat overboard for joy. &quot;We're Brown and Company;
come along! No more sea for you, old chap! Come along, and we'll
tell you all about it. Silly old goat to think we was goin' to let
you sail a ship for any company, 'ceptin' ourselves.&quot; So the
bewildered old skipper was put into the boat and thence lugged into
the club room, where things were explained in such fashion as left
him a much amazed man, also a much touched and affected one.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in disposing of the copra; and it
brought such a price as made people stare, and long to charter
ships for the South Seas. But the story of Sawara got wind, and it
seemed doubtful whether there were any more grateful chiefs to be
met with down there.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you goin' to do with all your money, Cap'en
Bob?&quot; asked a member of the Port Watch as, a few days
afterwards, they stood and watched the Dancing Jane unloading her
precious cargo into a great deep-water ship.</p>
<p>But Cap'en Bob's reply can best be seen to-day in the fine
structure that, standing in its own beautiful grounds, overlooks
the Harbor, and is celebrated far and wide throughout Australasia,
as the Port Endeavour Home for Indigent Merchant Seamen; and under
its wing, as it were, stands the bowling-green of the Port Watch,
where still the old skippers and mates slowly pace the rinks, and
at intervals saunter aimlessly into the bar of the &quot;Man at the
Wheel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fine lot of boats we carry,&quot; I remarked to the
bo'sun of the R.M.S. Olympia, one fine Sunday morning, just as
&quot;drill&quot; was over.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; replied the bo'sun with a gesture of
disgust; &quot;the boats is right enough for them as likes 'em, but
for my part I wouldn't care a pen worth o' snuff if she hadn't a
boat to her name. Enough o' deepwater boatin' I've 'ad to last me
my time! An' if 'the 'Lympia was a-sinkin' this blessed minute,
them as wanted the boats could 'ave 'em, for all I cared.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bo'sun,&quot; I replied insinuatingly, &quot;after that
heavy drill business I should think it's about a fair thing to
freshen the nip. And I see the 2d saloon bar is open. What d'you
think?&quot; &quot;Ay, ay, sir,&quot; he grinned, smacking his lips
anticipatingly, &quot;that there boat drill does take a lot out of
us. So, if you're agreeable&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>Gently, whilst the old Jamaica was still in circulation, I led
back the talk to the boats; and then, sitting on the lee-side of
the dispensary that bright Sunday forenoon, whilst for'ar'd the
deck officers flirted with the lady passengers, and aft a few
pallid engineers sported their Sunday uniforms amongst the fair
one's of the second saloon, the bo'sun told me this story:</p>
<p>&quot;You know,&quot; he began, &quot;that most o' my time's
been spent in wind jammmers, and it's only lately that I've took to
steam. Thirty-five years I have been under canvas, and an awful
fool to stop as long at it as I done. Then I was nothin' better nor
a slave, at the beck an' call o' all hands. Now, in comparison,
I've got the life of a gentleman. No, I wouldn't go back to canvas
again for twenty pounds a month. Well, it's some ten years or so
now since I sailed out o' London in a big lump of a wooden
barque&mdash;one o' Bligh's 'pea soupers' as we used to call 'em,
from the dirty yaller color they was painted. We was bound to the
Mauritius for sugar. It was my third trip as bo'sun; and, take her
all round, and spite o' the skipper's havin' brought his wife with
him, she was about the cumfablest lime-juicer as ever I was in. The
wife was a fine lump of a woman, pretty young, too, compared with
the Old Man, as was quite grey and bald. However that might be, she
seemed fond enough of him, and we did hear as how she was the widow
of another skipper left destitute by her husband being lost at sea,
and that but for the Old Man she would have had to go on the
parish. But, you know, yarns of the sort will get about amongst men
afloat just the same as they does ashore. Anyhow, she was a good
woman, and always used her word with the skipper to make things as
easy as possible for the men. Many's the tot o' grog and bit o'
cabin stuff she used to send into me and Chips and Sails in the
deckhouse where we berthed. The old Sarah Bligh, like 'all the rest
of her tribe, wasn't a clipper by no means; but, so long as he's
fairly done by, there's no sailorman what doesn't like a good slow
ship and a good pay-day better than a flash flyer, that most of her
time's no better'n a 'arf-tide rock, a doin' of her thirteen an'
fourteen. You bet, it ain't Jack that blows about what his ship can
do&mdash;leastways, not till he gets out of her! More days, more
dollars 'is his motter, when there's full and plenty, and watch and
watch a-goin'.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we jogged along through the trades; all right
enough. Then after calling at Capetown, where we had a bit of cargo
to put out, we bore away for Port Louis. Then, one night, standing
on the main hatch, watching a bright star that looked as it rose
like the white light of a steamer, I suddenly seen a blue curl o'
something rise up between me and it in the clear blueness of the
might. At first I only rubbed my eyes, thinkin', p'raps, as it were
a sort o' scum come acrost 'em, But it didn't go away, seemed, in
fact, to get thicker. So I walks for'ard till I gets to the big
ventilator just before the foremast. The star was clear then, and,
turning back, I puts the fault on my eyes. Then I gives another
look, and, hang me, if there it wasn't again, just a blue, thin
haze, curling up into the starshine plain'r ever. We was braced
sharp up on the starboard tack. It was almost a dead calm, courses
hauled up and head sails down; but just then a faint puff came from
the nor'ard, and I saw the streak of blue waver and bend to'rds me,
and next minute I sniffed smoke, and dropped to the business in a
jiffy. Runnin' for'ard again, I shins up the topsail sheets and on
to the ventilator&mdash;it was a great big stack, as tall as a
Thames penny steamer's&mdash;and hops off it again like a bird, so
hot it was, and the smoke curling thicker'n ever out from under the
hood of it. The ship was on fire. How it happened, o' course, was
only, as it mostly is in them cases, a matter o' 'guessment. But,
probably, it was through some of those cursed lumpers in Table Bay
a-smokin' among the cargo. But, however it was done, it was done
thorough. Been a-smoulderin' I reckon ever since we left there.
Anyhow, when we took the forehatches off smoke and red tongues o'
flame come dartin' up, so as it give us all we knew to get 'em on
again.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we did everything we could think of&mdash;cut holes
in the deck and had the hose along, and pumped and pumped the water
into her till she got deep as a sand barge. But, lor, it seemed as
ye might so well ha' sprinkled a volcaner with a waterin' pot. Fore
an' aft the fire spread, until saloon and deck-houses was like
ovens, and that thick with smoke as would stifle you to put your
head in them.</p>
<p>&quot;And through it all the old skipper, aye, and his wife,
too, worked like niggers-him carry in' buckets and her bringin' us
tucker and drink along the hot, smokin' decks, as each minute we'd
expec' to see cave in.</p>
<p>&quot;But it was all to no good; and when the Old Man sees that
it warn't, and that the Sarah was past savin', he calls us off, and
sets us to gettin' the boats out.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfornitly he'd left it just a little too late, so that,
although we got 'em into the water all right, we'd time to put
mighty little into 'em afore we has to jump for our lives. 'Jump,
did I say?' exclaimed the bo'sun, reflectively, stroking the
grizzled stubble on his chin. 'Crawled,' it should ha' been,
considering that the smoke was by now that thick you couldn't see
your hand afore your face. From royal truck to deck the Sarah was
just a mass o' thick black smoke, that got into our eyes and down
our throats, and nigh suffocated us afore we managed to shove clear
of her in the three, boats. We left her at eight bells in the
afternoon watch, and then she looked just one solid heap o' smoke.
Ten minutes more, and all o' a suddent, she busted out in flames,
as shot up and set the sails and riggin' afire; then the masts went
all ways at oncest, and presen'ly the hull itself sunk in a
roarin', bubblin', fizzle o' steam leavin' us a-starin' at each
other there on the wide and lovely ocean, a thousand miles from
Port Louis, and about four hundred from the nearest land, which was
Cape St. Mary, at the southern end o' Maddygascar. But there's the
lunch bugle, sir,&quot; broke off the bo'sun, &quot;and the rest of
this long-winded yarn will keep till some other time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind my lunch, bo'sun,&quot; I replied, &quot;I'm
getting interested; and I fancy the marrow of the story's yet to
come. Let's pay our respects to the steward once more. It's dry
work all this talking, and you've got another hour before your
dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Re-seating ourselves, and lighting our pipes&mdash;in the Line
to which the Olympic belongs the bos'un sleeps in all night, and is
on deck throughout the day&mdash;my friend continued:</p>
<p>&quot;In my boat was the skipper and his wife, four A.Bs., an
ordinary seaman, and precious little else. You see, sir, the
general run o' merchant vessels keeps their boats more for show
than use&mdash;fixtures, as takes a mighty deal o' shiftin'. And
the Sarah's wasn't no exception, all fastened down with gripes and
covered up with canvas; on the skids, too, the three of em, so that
if the weather hadn't been fine not a single one would we have had
a show of puttin' over the side. As it was, we were lucky&mdash;if
luck you could call it&mdash;to have got away at all. But we had no
sails or mast, only three oars, and no rudder. A keg of stinkin'
water that had never been changed since we left London was lashed
aft, and somebody had thrown in a few pieces of salt beef and pork
out of the harness casks; there was also a small keg of bread, and
in the skipper's pockets were a few tins of sardines. Nor, as we
soon discovered, were the others much better off. Indeed, none had
mast or sail, and the gig was without rowlocks. A pretty little
picnic, wasn't it, for any time o' the year in the Ingian Ocean? No
wonder the Old Man was flabbergasted, and didn't seem to know which
way to turn or what to do! Says he, at last, as we all lies
alongside each other, says he, 'Well, lads, it's bad job; but we
shouldn't be far out o' the track o' steamers from Durban to
Mauritius; and I don't think we can do better than pull away about
due north and keep a good lookout.'</p>
<p>&quot;Cold comfort this, as you may well believe,&quot;
continued the bo'sun, with a faraway look in his keen grey eyes, as
if mentally recalling the picture. &quot;And that the Old Man felt
it to be so you could see by his face, as he sat there with one arm
round his wife, who, though pale as death, never let a whimper or a
tear out of her. &quot;By Jinkies&quot; he exclaimed, suddenly and
emphatically, &quot;she were what the story books calls a
'era-wine, if ever there was one in this world. Well &quot;
continued the bo'sun, &quot;we pulled to the nor'ard for the best
part of the night; but there was no heart in us, tired and hungry,
and weak with fighting the fire for the past three days. And when
to'ards mornin' the wind and sea rose, we just gave up and tumbled
in a heap in the bottom o' the boat and went to sleep, clean worn
out.</p>
<p>&quot;Next day it fell calm, and hot as blazes. The water in the
keg was fair thick and slimy, but we wouldn't have minded that so
much could we only ha' got enough of it. A quarter of a sardine tin
full all round, however, was what the skipper whacked out; and it
seemed to regularly sizzle on our tongues. The sardines we all
allowed was to be kept for the missis. But she wouldn't hear of no
such thing, and said if we didn't go whack and whack she'd not
touch a bite herself. So we had half o' one o' them potty mis'able
fish each on a knob o' biscuit. This feast was topped up by a few
drops of the oil in the missis's thimble to each of us. By jinkies,
sir, arter that r'yal repast we felt as if we could ha' eaten a raw
pig apiece! As for the salt horse and pork, we had sense enough
then to know that to touch it was nearly the same as sudden
death.</p>
<p>&quot;I forgot to tell you that durin' the night we'd lost sight
o' the other boats. Nor we never see 'em again. Nor, so far as I
ever heard, did anyone else.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course there was no shelter from the blazin' sun as
beat down on us, eatin' into our brains all day long; and after
that first night there was no talk of pullin', so we just hysted
one o' the oars where the mast should ha' been, and tied the
missis's shawl to the top of it for a signal.</p>
<p>About the fourth day, I should think it was, we come to the end
of our tucker and water. I remember the skipper's wife served out,
the last bite and sup all around, and then she knee's down and
prays that we might be soon delivered out of our misery. And,
presently, some took their own way out of it. A couple o' the
chaps, Swedes or some other sort o' Dutchmen, had been gnawing on
the salt meat and washing it down with the salter sea. When
suddenly one croaks out, 'Oh, Yesu Crist!' and overboard he goes,
followed in a brace of shakes by his mate. They sank like
stones.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the young ordinary seaman starts babblin' an' ravin'
about his mother and his sisters; and he crawls into the
stern-sheets and catches hold o' the missis's hand, meanin' to say
goodbye, and she, weak as she is, puts her arms around his neck and
begs and prays of him to wait. But he's too strong for her, and
see'n' as she can't stop him, she just kisses him, and over he
goes. All this time I'm lying right for'ard, too weak to move hand
or foot, and the other two chaps, is lying under the 'midship
thwarts without a stir in 'em. As for the Old Man, he's sitting aft
there, mutterin' to himself, with his head on his breast.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued the bo'sun, knocking the ashes out
of his pipe, and taking a generous bite off a lump of twist,
&quot;I don't remember anythin' else; till I woke up, as it were,
to find the boat tossin' about like a cork in a heavy sea. It had
been raining, too, for I was soaked, and there was water in the
bottom of her. At my feet lay the skipper's wife, aft squatted the
Old Man with his head against the rail. The other two had gone.
Sittin' up, I drew the woman's head in to my knees and felt her
heart. But it was quite still. She was stiff and cold, too, and
must ha' been dead some time; but her face was calm and peaceful,
and did me good to look at it. As for the skipper, I could see that
he was gone by the way his head went nid-noddin' with every lurch
the boat gave. And I reckoned that, bein' in good company where I
was, I couldn't do better than join 'em. So, takin' a big drink o'
water, I just lay down again alongside the dead woman.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/bligh01.jpg"
width="550" height="440"></p>
<p>&quot;But it wasn't to be, not just then, anyhow,&quot;
concluded the bo'sun, after a long pause, &quot;for when I came to
again I was in Durban Hospital, where I'd been brought three weeks
afore by a coastin' steamer that had sighted the boat, and whose
people was near givin' me a passidge to Davy Jones with the other
two, when some feller, seein' as I 'peared sort o' fresh; thought
o' putting a lookin' glass to my mouth to see if I breathed. So
that's the yarn, sir. And now you know why, sooner than take the
risk o' goin' through such a bit again in a open boat. I'd put my
hands over my eyes like a monkey does, and go straight down.
There's the mess boy signallin' fer dinner, so I'll just go and
interview the 'Lympia's good roast beef and potatoes, and plum
duff, and soft bread and butter, and think, as I often does; of
them days in the boat as made a old man o' me afore my time.&quot;
And the bo'sun moved away aft, a stout, brown-faced man, with
almost white hair, though still in his prime, leaving me to regard
the great liner's boats with a new interest in the light of the
terrible experience I had just been listening to.</p>

<p>William Barden, Esq., J.P., of Carpentaria, and shipowner of
Port Endeavor, better known as &quot;Old Billy Barden,&quot; was
not the pleasantest man in the world to work for, and had it not
been for his only daughter, Jessie, I should have left his service
long ago. So would Frank Hassall, mate of the old Mary Barden,
barque, and of which ancient tub, I, Henry Curtis, was second
officer&mdash;as they say in the big deep water packets, where the
term mate is now well-nigh obsolete. We, Frank and I, had been In
old Barden's ships three or four years, and were very good friends
until, and, indeed, for some time after, the pair of us began
courting pretty Jessie. And at first he played fair; many a night
he could have ordered me to stay on board instead of allowing me
ashore, when he knew that, some time through the evening, he was
certain to meet me at the old shipowner's house, where, whilst
Barden was busy over his accounts in a little den off the parlor,
Frank and I sat with Jessie who, sly, sweet, little minx that she
was, managed with great skill to keep both of us in a state of dire
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Old Barden was reputed wealthy; was a widower; and might have
been supposed to object with reason to any of his servants making
love to his daughter. But he never did. His mind seemed entirely
bound up in the half-dozen old rattle traps that he called the
&quot;Barden Line,&quot; and whose bottoms only a merciful
providence prevented falling out of them at each successive trip
they made. They were all named after some Barden or other, male and
female, varying in size from a topsail schooner to a barque; and
the Mary Barden&mdash;so-called in memory of his late
wife&mdash;was the &quot;Commodore&quot; of the fleet. And, in
spite of her prettiness, the young sparks of Endeavor didn't seem
to run after Jess much. Perhaps they fought shy of &quot;old
Billy,&quot; who, on more than one occasian, had let it be
understood that he wanted &quot;no useless whelps of bank clerks or
counterjumpers sneaking around his house&mdash;fellers that didn't
know one end of a ship from t'o'her, nor a marlinspike from a
jib-downhaul.&quot;</p>
<p>Needless to remark that old Barden had been a sailor
himself.</p>
<p>But, as most people can imagine, the tolerant state of affairs
between Frank and myself could not last. And the time arrived when
one of us either sat and glared at the other in sulky silence or
rose abruptly and left his rival in possession of the room and of
Jess. Nor, at sea, was it any pleasanter to be in constant touch
with a superior officer who, in place of fraternising as of old,
gave one nothing but curt orders and gloomy looks. Thus, when at
the end of one well-nigh unendurable trip, the Mary returned from
Kalpara, timber-laden, and old Barden offered me the command of the
smallest and oldest of the &quot;Line&quot;&mdash;a schooner called
the &quot;Jessie&quot;&mdash;I jumped at the chance,
notwithstanding the fact that my wages were the same as on the
Mary, and the work, dodging in and out of coastal harbors for
produce of all sorts, very much harder.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to congratulate you, Mr. Curtis,&quot; said Jessie,
with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, &quot;on having at last,
achieved an independent command. But I'm afraid Mr. Hassall will
miss his old friend very much.&quot; Whereat her father chuckled
grimly, and called her a &quot;little cat,&quot; and I looked as
foolish as she had intended me to. Frank and the Mary were away
just at this time, on a long trip, for &quot;the Bardens,&quot; to
Noumea with cattle. Thus, having a fair field, I naturally made all
the play I could. But Jess, although she captained me to the top of
my bent, and a lot more than that, defied all my efforts to bring
her to book.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the greatest care of my namesake,&quot; said she, in
one of her saucy humors, for she knew full well what an old fraud
that namesake was. &quot;You know what great store I set by her. If
anything happened to the little beauty, I should never get over it,
I'm afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, as I pressed my suit, in detail scarcely worth setting
down here, she said: &quot;Now, don't you think, Captain, that one
responsibility of the kind is enough for any man? Every sailor's
ship should be his sweetheart, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, upon my making the only obvious reply&mdash;that I was
fully prepared to take the risk of another, and still more
important, responsibility, to wit, herself, she only laughed
provokingly, and remarked that in her opinion sailors should never
marry before they left the sea for good. Still, I went away not so
very ill-satisfied, and with a glimmering hope, engendered by a
fleeting glance as I said goodbye, that Jess was not altogether
glad to get rid of me.</p>
<p>Then, presently, Frank returned, and was welcomed with a warmth
that sent my hopes down to zero. He and I were barely civil to each
other, and perhaps it was lucky we were not shipmates, for at times
he used to fall into sullen dour fits of rage, silent, but none the
less visible in the blazing eye, compressed lips, and heaving
chest. He rarely, however, showed his temper in Jess's presence,
but only when we two met about the port, or on the wharves.</p>
<p>You are not to imagine from what you have read about Jess that
she was a flirt, or a coquette even. But she was honestly puzzled
as she has since told me, liking us both as well as she did, how to
choose between us; and thus employed her woman's wit to help her
from committing herself definitely with either. In appearance she
was small and graceful, brown-haired and blue-eyed, dark
complexioned, and with the most enticing pair of rosy, arched lips
that ever tempted a poor sailor man. She was an admirable
housekeeper, and, with a couple of servants, managed to make her
father's home very comfortable!</p>
<p>Matters were in this unsatisfactory condition between the three
of us, when, returning from a trip to the Manning with a load of
maize, I was amazed to find that old Barden and Jess had sailed in
the Mary for Adelaide, whither she had gone coal-laden. Her father,
it appeared, had taken it into his head that he wanted a change of
air, and Jess had insisted on accompanying him. Much to the
amusement of the port, old Barden had taken care to first dock the
Mary, and have her thoroughly overhauled, a most unusual experience
with any of his vessels.</p>
<p>It will be guessed that when I heard the news I felt far from
comfortable, knowing Frank too well to hope that he would not make
the most of such a glorious opportunity. How I envied him! Still,
of late, something had seemed to tell me that Jess, although
perhaps unconsciously, was inclining to my side. Frank's temper had
been getting worse than ever, and, once, coming through the garden
and finding us sitting rather close together upon the
creeper-covered verandah of the old cottage, he had scowled and
glowered, and finally departed speechless, but banging the gate
behind him with an energy that nearly sent it off its hinges, and
frightened Jess, sending her still closer to my side. But she had
left no note or sign of any kind behind her for me, either at house
or office, that I could hear of.</p>
<p>Two days of light winds on our return passage to the Manning,
and then it came on to blow vilely from the south'ard and east, and
sending the Jess, flying light as she was, well out to sea, and
making her pitch and toss and tumble as the waves smacked her
about, until her straining seams leaked like a sieve, and kept us
going at the pumps from morning until night, and all night through,
hove-to though we were under a storm-staysail for'ard, and a corner
of mainsail aft. The sea got up higher and higher, and almost as a
matter of form I gave orders to get ready the old longboat, which,
with a dinghy, was all we carried. But the hands looked glum
enough, for boat and ship were well met&mdash;equally old and
rotten, and with so little to choose between them that, as one of
the men put it, &quot;Better stay on the old cow and drown
cumfatable, 'stead o' pullin' out ter sea ter do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's another feller in trouble out yonder,&quot; said
the mate, suddenly pointing over the port bow, between, one of our
spells at the pumps. &quot;Looks as if he was goin' to make a
bloomin' finish of it, pretty quick, don't he?&quot; Sure enough,
about a mile to seaward of us, we could make out a barque minus her
fore and main topmasts, her &nbsp;courses in rags; and at times
nearly hidden by the seas that broke over her. She looked to be
shockingly deep in the water; indeed, from where we stood, we could
distinguish hardly any side at all; whereas, although wet enough
below, the Jess carried her decks almost dry.</p>
<p>Getting, the telescope, I, with not a little trouble, got her
into the object-glass, and as we rose high on the crest of a
comber, I nearly dropped the instrument, for, although I caught
only a momentary glance, it was enough for me to make out the
square stern and bluff bows of the Mary Barden.</p>
<p>Looking again, with a miserable sinking of the heart, I
distinctly saw a group of people on the poop, with, I was almost
sure, among them, the flutter of a dress. Infinitely dreary and sad
a spectacle did the poor old barque present, wrecked, ragged,
almost, as it seemed, on the point ot foundering, and with reversed
ensign blowing in shreds from the peak halliards. &quot;Yes,&quot;
I exclaimed, &quot;it's the Mary Barden right enough.&quot; The
mate heard me, and replied, with a grin: &quot;Well, the old man'll
know now what it means to he on one of his ships in rough weather.
An' him a-overhaulin' of her so careful before he'd wenture! Was he
thinkin' that pitch an' oakum can plug dry rot? Well, so help me,
if this ain't a go! Here's the owner a-sinkin' in one of his own
baskets, with another of 'em pretty nigh as badly off! Shall we run
down an' see how the old chap's a-takin' it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Jessie's on board, you should remember,
Williams,&quot; I said sternly. &quot;And whatever you may have
against her father's ships, you've nothing against his
daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, by gum,&quot; replied the mate, heartily, &quot;She's
all right, you bet, skipper! I was forgettin 'bout her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;get the lower topsail on the
schooner. She'll stand it now, for&mdash;if I'm not mistaken, the
gale's nearly blown out&mdash;and we'll run down and see if we
can't be of some use.&quot;</p>
<p>The mate shook his head as he moved away; and I, too, felt that
there was not much hope. The barque's boats were all gone. Our
large one might have lived in the sea, heavy as it was; but, in
places, you could almost put your finger through it, so decayed was
the planking. As we neared the derelict, I saw that there were only
six people on the poop&mdash;old Barden and Jess, Frank, and Mason,
the captain, and two seamen. Obviously, the rest must have been
either washed overboard, or carried away when the masts went. The
survivors had lashed themselves to life-lines, and now waved their
hands and shouted to us; but the wind carried their voices to
leeward, and we could not understand what they said. But, judging
from their gestures, they were words of farewell.</p>
<p>Very bitter must old Barden's thoughts have been just then, as
the reflection came to him that but for his foolish parsimony there
could have been, although a dangerous enough job, little question
about the eventual saving of himself and his companions.</p>
<p>As it was, I was at my wits' ends what to do. You might almost
as well have put a colander into the water as the long boat, while
the dinghy, though in somewhat better condition, was a mere one
man, smooth water, cockleshell. The Jessie herself had now four
feet of water in her, through our neglecting to pump since the
barque had been sighted. And the barque herself was obviously
sinking. It was now 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and that she could
last the night out was useless to hope.</p>
<p>To my mind there was only one last slight chance left, and that
was to get a line between the barque and the schooner, rig a
travelling buoy, and drag the people on board of us one by one.
And, looking at the sea they would have to pass through, it seemed
the very faintest of chances. However, with the dinghy and some
spare spars we had on the Jessie, we made a sea-anchor, and thus
stopped much of our drift. And then, despite, the remonstrances of
the mate and crew, stripping to drawers and singlet, I tied a light
line around my waist, slipped into the water, and struck out for
the Mary, towards which I had allowed the schooner to drift until
she was 200 yards away, before getting our sea-anchor
overboard.</p>
<p>Although a powerful swimmer, I found the task a tougher one than
I had expected. The seas were not regular, but broke over me in a
cross tumble, and the line I dragged caused me to swim so low that
at times I was near being smothered. Thus, short as the distance
looked, I was nearly exhausted by the time I reached the Mary, and,
catching the rope they threw me, was, with much care and caution,
hauled on board, amidships, where now she was almost awash.</p>
<p>Our greetings were brief. Frank sneered at my scheme. The rest
stared blankly at the foaming smother through which I had battled,
but agreed to try it. Already the men had hauled a small hawser
aboard; then followed the buoy, and all was ready.</p>
<p>Mason volunteered to go first, and, after a terrible buffeting
got safely to the schooner. Seeing the hawser was too low, I signed
to the Jessie's men to raise it, and old Barden&mdash;his daughter
insisting&mdash;made the passage in comparative safety. It was Jess
we were afraid for; but she gave no sign, except by a sudden
pallor, as we secured her in the buoy, and gave the signal to heave
away. The next minute she was in the water, and I turned my head
away until the cheering told me she was safe.</p>
<p>The next to cross&mdash;a seaman&mdash;lost his head, let go of
the hawser, capsized, and was swept away and drowned.</p>
<p>As the best swimmer, I insisted on being the last to leave,
although Frank argued the point hotly. But it would have been sheer
madness as he was no good in the water. So at last he gave in, and
got through all right. And, having no one to pay away at the
barque's end, I nearly lost the number of my mess, through their
dragging too eagerly. However, I got on board somehow, but so
thoroughly done that I had to be carried to my bunk.</p>
<p>It was all a sheer miracle, and no one was readier to confess
the fact than old Barden. He looked ten years an older man when he
came into my berth to tell me that the Mary had gone down not
twenty minutes after we had left her; also, that the wind had
shifted sufficiently to enable us to stand up for Port Endeavor.
Afore time he used to be a brusque, somewhat stern old man, but now
he was curiously quiet and subdued, both in voice and manner, And
Williams, visiting me later, remarked with a twinkle in his eye,
&quot;Skipper, I guess I'll stick to this employ, and see how
things go. The boss has had a lesson; an' I shouldn't wonder if it
don't turn out real A1 presently.&quot;</p>
<p>But Jess did me more good than any of them. Somehow, I had
injured my shoulder, and was unable to move without suffering much
pain; and Jess brought some liniment and rubbed it in until I
groaned with sheer delight and swore that I felt better every
minute the operation lasted. So much so, indeed, that the evening
we made Cape Flyaway, at the entrance to Endeavor Bay, the arm was
so wonderfully improved as to be able to curl around Jessie's waist
whilst I once again asked the question that some instinct told me
Frank had already asked in vain. And, this time, the arm stayed
there, and the question was answered and put over and over again
after the eternal fashion, and the more it was put and answered the
more satisfactory did the whole business seem to the pair of
us.</p>
<p>Later on, Captain Mason told me that Frank had messed things up
properly on board the Mary Barden. It was in his watch, and whilst
engrossed in talk with Jess, that the barque had lost her sticks
during a squall be ought to have seen a mile away. Then, when
reprimanded, he had flown into a rage with both captain and owner,
and said things that could never be mended. This, Mason thinks, was
after Jess had definitely refused to have anything more to say to
him. But I never inquired of her concerning that particular
point.</p>
<p>Almost before we were made fast to the wharf, Frank disappeared,
and I never saw him again; although we heard, afterwards, that he
had got a billet on some coasting steamer. Within six weeks Jess
and I were quietly married, and for a wedding present, old Barden
bought a fine barquentine, nearly new, and gave it to us to take
our honeymoon trip in. Also he began to quietly get rid of the
&quot;Line,&quot; breaking up some and selling others for hulks. He
said &quot;he was going out of the business; that really there was
nothing in it; no use trying to compete with steam, etc.,
etc.&quot; However, there was a start for us in the
&quot;Dolphin,&quot; and if a few pounds were wanted now and again
for upkeep, etc., why, he'd see about it.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Twelve months passed, and Jess and I and the baby were coming
back in the Dolphin after a fairly good trip around the islands.
Off the Cat and Kittens we had picked up the tug and made our
number to the signal station there, when I saw a big lump of an
outward-bound steamer suddenly swerve off the course, which should
have taken her clear of us, and come thundering down full speed
ahead upon the Dolphin.</p>
<p>In vain we waved and yelled at her; in vain the tug's syren
blared; on rushed the steamer, her sharp, knife-like bows towering
a score of feet over the Dolphin. Luckily for us, the skipper of
the tug, with great presence of mind, seeing there was nothing else
for it, went astern and slewed us bow on to the steamer, with the
result that instead of cutting us clean through fore and aft, as
was apparently intended, we only lost our bowsprit, jibboom, and
head-gear, whilst the tug escaped scot free.</p>
<p>Without checking her speed for an instant the steamer kept
straight ahead, and in about three more minutes dashed on to the
ugly Cat and Kittens reef with a shock that could be heard for
miles. To our astonished vision the whole fore-part of her appeared
to crumple up as she slid back from the almost perpendicular
pinnacle of rock, and suddenly sank in 25 fathoms of water.</p>
<p>For a minute we stood appalled at the awful and unaccountable
catastrophe. Then we got our boats into the water and did what we
could, saving altogether a dozen lives out of some forty who made
up her complement.</p>
<p>To the general public the loss of the Rollo has for long
appeared but the outcome of an irresponsible meaningless fit of
madness on the part of one of her officers. To a few of us, reading
between the lines of the quartermaster's evidence, the motive was
only too evident. Here is an extract from the newspaper report of
the inquiry, as held by the Port Endeavor Marine Board: William
Johnson, quartermaster of the B.S. Rollo, deposed: &quot;I was at
the wheel during the second mate's-watch. Was steering the usual
course to clear the Cat and Kittens. To port, and past the reef,
although nearly in a line with it, was a white-painted barquentine,
inward bound. The second officer, Mr. Hassall, had his glasses on
her, and presently he says, 'Johnson, isn't, that the Dolphin?
You're an Endeavor man, and should know her' 'That's her, sir,' I
says; for I'd made her out long ago, havin' been a trip in her with
Captain Curtis. Then says the second officer, 'Same skipper got her
yet, Johnson?' 'Why, o' course, sir,' I says, 'Captain Curtis owns
her. There he is now, with Mrs., Curtis, standin' aft. Then says
the second, 'Johnson,' says he, 'just run down into my berth, and
bring me up a nip o' whisky. You'll find a bottle under the pillow.
There's a corkscrew on the table. I ain't feelin' very well. I'll
take the wheel.' Well, I stared a bit; but, all the same, I goes
and finds the bottle all right. Looking round for the corkscrew, I
hears the bell going for 'full speed ahead,' 'an thinks it curious,
knowin' the port regulations. However, I pours a good nip into a
tumbler, and gets up on the bridge just in time to see us ramming
into the reef, with the second standing as calm and contented at
the wheel as if he'd had the whole wide ocean in front of him. Then
I remembers nothing more till I finds myself on board o' the
Dolphin. Nor, to my knowledge, no one ever saw the second officer
again.&quot;</p>

<p>There are plenty of people still among us who remember the
smash-up of the &quot;Middle Age Pension Company,&quot; and the
levanting of Secretary Shand with nearly &pound;40,000 in scrip,
bonds, cash, and private documents, the property of the
shareholders; but just how that big sum was recovered is not
generally known, inasmuch as those interested held their tongues,
only too thankful to be recouped to some extent for their losses,
and on that account, and on others even more personally important,
inclined to be careless as to the punishment of the arch-offender.
There were a great many rogues in the &quot;M.A.P.&quot; Company,
and, perhaps, some of them were quite as bad as Shand, although
they stayed ashore, and howled after him at the top of their
voices, &quot;Stop thief!&quot; Be this as it may, there were not
many people who knew what a close shave M'Crimmon had of losing the
spoil, nor why he so soon got a sub-inspectorship, and Captain
Burgess a fine new steamer in place of the old Speewah.</p>
<p>&quot;Mac&quot; had not long joined the Endeavour detective
force when he was placed in charge of the &quot;M.A.P.&quot; case
with absolute carte blanche, both from the Government and the
representatives of the shareholders. Most folk were of opinion that
Shand had left the country and shown everybody a clean pair of
heels; but M'Crimmon, &quot;from information received,&quot; was
pretty certain that the ex-secretary was still in Australia.</p>
<p>Still, do his uttermost, he could get no absolute clue to his
whereabouts and at the end of a fortnight's hard work he was fain
to acknowledge that, so far, Shand had been too much for him.
Presently, however, came a wire from Melbourne:</p>
<p>&quot;Have a man here answers description all over. Denies
everything. Come at once or send.&quot;</p>
<p>In those days there was a big gap in the railway communication
with the southern city, involving a long and weary journey by
coach. M'Crimmon hesitated. The Speewah, he saw by the paper,
sailed that very afternoon. The train did not leave till late the
next morning, and he wanted to be travelling at once; so he booked
a berth in the steamer, and was thankful to Providence ever
afterwards that he did so.</p>
<p>Ships leaving Endeavour keep close inshore until clear of Cape
Waratah; and, of course, the Speewah followed the usual rule. It
was nearly sundown; there was a rather good-sized sea running, and
as the steamer came round with Waratah on her starboard hand the
detective, standing aft, was surprised to see, almost in her wake,
a small boat pulling across the Speewah's stern. Evidently, it had
come out of a little bay some two hundred yards away, where were a
few private residences belonging to the wealthy class of citizens.
And at first he imagined that it was one of these who, having
missed his passage, wished to board the steamer. Then, in the
falling light, turning his gaze seaward, he saw the lofty spars of
a barquentine hove-to under a fore topsail and main trysail. A
string of signals flew from her halliards, as she rolled slowly to
the heavy swell. And for her the boat was evidently making. So,
then, after all, it was merely her skipper being pulled on board!
Still, it was surely a curious place, and time! And with the ever
dormant detective instinct strong within him he took his glasses
from where they hung on the rail, and focussed them upon the boat,
now nearly alongside the vessel. For a minute the man at the
steer-oar shielded the figure sitting aft from his gaze; then a
heave of the sea brought him full in the field of the glass, and
helped by an expiring gleam or sunshine, M'Crimmon recognised the
clean-shaven, clear-cut features of Shand, For a minute he stood
there astonished and incredulous, staring with all his soul in his
eyes. But the gloom had deepened so as to render objects indistinct
and shadowy even through the powerful &quot;Voigtlander&quot;
glass. And all he could make out was that the boat was already
being run up to the davits of the barquentine, whilst, as if by
magic, she all at once clothed herself in canvas, shimmering a dull
white across the nightfall, and heeling over to a fair quarterly
wind bore away to the eastward. The detective paused irresolutely.
Was it possible that he had been deceived? Scarcely; he knew Shand
too well for that, had talked and drank with him many a time.
Still, as no one was better aware than himself, questions of
identity were among the most puzzling and illusive that his
profession were called upon to deal with. And the message from
Melbourne? If it was Shand in the boat, then the wire was forged by
a confederate for the express purpose of drawing him off the trail,
and leaving the coast clear for the defaulter. As he stared at the
fast lessening blur in the gloom that was now only visible through
his glasses, M'Crimmon finally made up his mind, and, ascending the
bridge, in a few words told the captain his story, and asked him to
alter his course and go in pursuit of the barquentine.</p>
<p>But this the skipper at first absolutely refused to do.
&quot;Why, man,&quot; said he, &quot;it's madness pure and simple.
The company would not only sack me. but gaol me into the
bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, they wouldn't,&quot; replied the detective;
&quot;they'd reward and promote you. And remember, the Queen's
warrant runs by sea as well as by land. Therefore, I call upon you
to assist me by every means in your power.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, but suppose,&quot; replied the captain, weakening a
little, &quot;that it shouldn't be the right man, after all. How
should I look then, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the responsibility will be mine,&quot; said the
detective confidently, &quot;and I will see you through the
business. On the other hand, if it should turn out to be the man,
and through your refusal to aid the interests of justice he
escapes, why, then, I wouldn't care about being in your
shoes.&quot;</p>
<p>The old captain pulled his grizzled hair impatiently, swore
hoarsely to himself, squinted astern at the Waratah light, and,
turning to M'Crimmon, whose gaze was concentrated on the seaward
darkness, made his last objection:</p>
<p>&quot;What about my passengers?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only myself aft,&quot; replied M'Crimmon
patiently, &quot;and five in the steerage. Three out of the five
are hard-ups, going on a chance of getting a job on the northern
harvest fields; the other two are spielers, whom I myself warned
out of Endeavor last week. An easily dealt with crowd, you see.
Besides, they'll be little the wiser. The name of the law will be
enough; none of them are in a hurry, and they'll be rather pleased
than otherwise at any delay, so long as they get plenty to eat and
to drink. Now, can you think of anything else that will make us
lose more time?&quot;</p>
<p>But the skipper could not; and, presently, to the astonishment
of the mate on watch, the course was altered in such wise as to
bring the old Speewah's head pointing to San Francisco, rather than
for Melbourne.</p>
<p>&quot;We ought to be up with her about midnight, I
suppose,&quot; remarked M'Crimmon, glancing at the chartroom clock,
&quot;in spite of all our lost time?&quot;</p>
<p>The captain grinned. Here, at least, he was on his own ground,
and knew exactly what he was talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;We might,&quot; he replied, &quot;if it fell a dead calm;
otherwise, if this breeze keeps up, it's doubtful when we'll ever
overhaul her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, what,&quot; said M'Crimmon, &quot;isn't the Speewah a
steamer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's so,&quot; replied the skipper, enjoyably; &quot;but
eight's her top, and six or seven she prefers. If we rush her to
eight there's generally trouble in the engine-room. Now, from what
I could see of her, that barquentine's a flyer&mdash;twelve to
thirteen with the wind as it is&mdash;and you know the proverb
about a stern chase, Mr. M'Crimmon, the Queen's warrant
notwithstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>The detective was amazed, and it was only when he noticed the
deliberate way in which the old tub forged ahead, and listened to
the querulous coughing of her engines, that he realised the truth
of the captain's words.</p>
<p>&quot;However,&quot; broke in the skipper, &quot;I daresay we
shall be in sight of her at daybreak, if we're on the right course;
and especially if the wind, as it looks like doing, hauls to the
east'ard a bit more.&quot;</p>
<p>All night the detective dozed in the chartroom, waking at short
intervals to the clink-clank-thump of the engines, and to take a
look at the compass, and make sure that the &quot;Speewah's course
had not been altered to south.&quot;</p>
<p>But he need have had no fear on that head. Old Burgess's motto
was &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound&quot;&mdash;although he
was pretty certain that, in this case, his share would be the
penny.</p>
<p>Daylight showed nothing; but sunrise showed a gleam of silver
pinions on the ocean's north-eastern, rim. &quot;By gum,&quot;
exclaimed Burgess, &quot;we've done better'n I expected! Good old
Speewah! Still, if the wind hadn't hauled a bit she'd been out of
sight.&quot;</p>
<p>But M'Crimmon was chagrined and angry at not having done better,
and in his heart of hearts was just a little doubtful as to the
extent of his responsibility in the matter. It was all very fine to
say that he would take it. Nevertheless, if the chase turned out to
be a wild-goose one, he was not so clear as he wished respecting
the way matters would pan out with his superiors and the steamship
company.</p>
<p>All that day the pursuit lasted; the steamer going at about six,
or a little over; the sailer, bothered by a brisk nor'-easter,
making much the same rate. That night, however, it came on to blow
a furious gale from the same quarter, and M'Crimmon, as he lay and
listened to the roaring masses of water that broke over the boat's
bows and rushed through the alleyways, to the muffled clank of the
engines, with every now and then an angry clatter as the propeller
fiercely raced in air, together with the howling of the wind and
the rattling of the volleyed spindrift against the funnel, felt
anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>Burgess would, in ordinary circumstances, have hove his ship to;
but by now that hunger of the chase&mdash;no matter what the
quarry&mdash;inherent to all animals, man among them, had entered
into his soul, and his orders to the engineers&mdash;&quot;Bang the
old&mdash;at it!&quot;&mdash;were as decided and laconic as if he
had been M'Crimmon himself.</p>
<p>For a while a stormy dawn disclosed nothing but an empty sea of
grey washing a greyer sky. But close scrutiny disclosed, broad on
the port bow, two slender spars, that waved wildly to and fro amid
the raging waste of waters, and at the foot of one there showed a
narrow streak of canvas.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the barquentine, right enough,&quot; decided the
skipper, after a long look. &quot;She's lost her foremast, and is
hove to under a close-reefed topsail. Well, I daresay we'll be able
to get near her now&mdash;unless she repairs damages afore we get
up, in which case we'll perhaps be able to keep her in sight while
our coal lasts.&quot;</p>
<p>As the Speewah approached, it could be seen that a crowd of men
were busy for'ard on the stranger at rigging a jury foremast. The
steamer hoisted her ensign, and ran up the signal, &quot;Do you
want any help?&quot; to which the other replied by hoisting the
Stars and Stripes, with &quot;No thank you&quot; on the code.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought she was a Yank,&quot; remarked old Burgess.
&quot;Can you take your man off her s'pose they don't want to let
him go? I should rather think not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She may not really be an American,&quot; said Burgess
anxiously, for he knew something of International law as applied to
salt water in such cases.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know who rightly owns her now,&quot; replied
Burgess, &quot;but I'll bet a year's pay that she was built not 100
miles from Mirimichi, U.S.A.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Speewah was bucketting around, sometimes within
hailing distance, at others a mile away. M'Crimmon, although
keeping his glasses persistently on the cripple, could see nothing
of the man he sought, and felt nonplussed and uncertain what was
the best course to pursue. At last he determined to try and get on
board the barquentine. The sea was still high, but for a guinea
each four of the steamer's crew agreed to do their best in one of
the two lifeboats that she carried.</p>
<p>It was a rough trip, although the Speewah had come very close to
the vessel, which towered up, now, high as a castle over those in
the boat, now sunk nearly level with the gunwale in the trough of
the big round-backed rollers. One man stood looking at them over
the rail. Presently he was joined by another. Both were smoking
cigars.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Mac!&quot; cried the last comer, &quot;what are you
doing there? This is Captain Kennedy,&quot; he went on, as their
faces came almost upon a level, and the ship nearly smashed the
boat to atoms.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the introduction by a wave of his arm, the captain
said, &quot;Come aboard, sir; come aboard. I guess I can give you a
drop o' stuff that'll make your hair curl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Mr. Shand,&quot; shouted M'Crimmon desperately,
&quot;tell them to put a ladder over, or a rope or something; I
want to see you particularly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So do other people, lots of 'em,&quot; laughed Shand.
&quot;However, you've heard the captain's invitation. Please
yourself.&quot; Just then, as the vessel swung towards the boat,
M'Crimmon made a mighty spring, and, clutching the rail, rolled
over it, right to the feet of the astonished pair. Not for nothing
had he gained a reputation as an athlete in that home of athletics,
Endeavor.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Mr. Shand,&quot; said the detective, picking himself
up, and unconcernedly brushing some dirt off his clothes,
&quot;let's have a talk. I fancy we can come to some agreement. If
you don't feel willing, there's my steamer coaled for a 3000-mile
trip, and though, perhaps, I can't take you off this vessel by
force, I'll follow you wherever you go, stick to you like a leech,
and collar you in the long run, whether at 'Frisco or at the other
side of the Horn&mdash;it's all one to one, so long as I get
you.&quot;</p>
<p>The confirmation of his hopes respecting the identity of Shand
had put heart into him, and his voice rang with the confidence born
of success.</p>
<p>Shand reflected, stroking a smooth-shaven check and upper lip.
&quot;Well?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the paper stuff,&quot; replied M'Crimmon, &quot;and
&pound;4000 out of the &pound;10,000 hard cash.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can't be done,&quot; replied the other decidedly,
&quot;even if I had the ten thou, which I haven't. One doesn't go
yachting in this style, single-handed, for a song, my boy. Tell you
what, though&mdash;give me a free discharge, signed by yourself and
other more responsible personages&mdash;of course you have
something of the kind in your pocket&mdash;and you can have all the
papers and &pound;2000. I am a fool to give so much. But I hate
worry; and I know, Mac, you'd hate to let me rest. You've got my
last word. Come along and have a drink on it, and then go in peace.
Say no, and we'll give you a trip you'll remember to the day of
your death&mdash;even if you ever see us again once we get our
jury-mast fixed. I know the old Speewah&mdash;a worm on business is
a sprinter to her.&quot;</p>
<p>M'Crimmon hesitated, but only for a minute. He knew the
steamer's coal would last perhaps three or four days at the
outside; but she was not provisioned for more than a week; then
there were the passengers to consider&mdash;steerage though they
were.</p>
<p>&quot;Done,&quot; said he at last; and followed Shand below. It
was actually more than he had looked for. There were men in
Endeavour, he knew, would willingly and joyfully give great sums
for certain hideously compromising documents held by Shand. He was
in great luck; but his face showed nothing.</p>
<p>Having read this far you will understand why M'Crimmon wears a
braided uniform, and why Burgess gets &pound;30 a month instead of
&pound;12. As for Shand, he is now one of the American oil kings,
and bids fair to die a millionaire several times over&mdash;and not
in dollars.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, good-bye, old chap,&quot; said Captain Harry
Jackson, of the great grey frozen meat steamer, to his brother,
Captain Frank, of the clipper ship, whose nose, even then, the
impatiently snorting tug was laying hold on, &quot;Good-bye, you've
got the start of me, and we're bound the same way. But I s'pose
I'll be back here again before you're up the London River. We might
pass you next week sometime. You wind-jammers have had your
day.&quot; And the skipper of the Pakaweera finished his glass and
rose from his seat at the table of the Ocean Queen's saloon.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe, maybe,&quot; replied his brother, as the pair went
on deck. &quot;But if we're slow at times, we're pretty sure. And
when we do have a smash we're not beaten altogether. When you
smash, there you are, and the Lord help you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; laughed the other, motioning for his boat to
pull up to the gangway, &quot;but only think of it, Harry! To
England and back again, and you, just as likely as not, only half
way there! Give up canvas, old man, and come into steam. You'll
never be sorry for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn steam!&quot; replied the other pleasantly, &quot;It
stinks! And such a trade! Butcher's shop! Get a blue apron and a
chopper at once! Sailors! Bah!&quot; '</p>
<p>But the younger man only laughed at the well worn gibe, as he
waved his hat from the stern sheets of the boat. Then the tug
snorted and puffed viciously, and the beautiful steel liner, her
head pointed seaward, moved slowly off down Otago Harbor, the sun
shining brightly below on polished brass work and twinkling glass,
aloft on masses of snowy canvas hanging in folds from the great
square yards ready presently to cover her from jibboom to
spanker-boom end in piles of softly rounded whiteness&mdash;a most
beautiful and stately fabric even now, and as yet only in the first
stage of her sea-toilette! And so thought the steam-bred man as he
was pulled back to his own mass of grey iron with her two pole
masts and great yellow funnel, straight, knife-like stem, and
uncompromising rigidity of line.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; he muttered, &quot;there's no denying that
Frank takes the cake as far as looks go. That's certain. But
ninety, an hundred, perhaps more, days home! Oh, Lord! Give me
something with a screw in the end of it, and take the good
looks.&quot;</p>
<p>Always when the brothers met here and there about the world, one
with canvas, the other with steam, they chaffed each other thus,
half in jest, half in earnest.</p>
<p>But this was the first time they had ever left a port so nearly
together, and for the same destination. Spreading her many wings to
a fierce westerly as soon as she got outside, the Ocean Queen, with
her lively cargo of wool, made such running as caused her skipper
to rub his hands gleefully each time the log came in, and say to
himself, &quot;Catch me next week, will he? If this breeze holds
it'll be a month o' Sundays before he sees me! I'd give something
considerable to beat him home!&quot; Then he sighed as he thought
of the Pakaweera's short cut through Magellan, and the Doldrums,
and the, perhaps, light trades round the corner, through which,
night and day, she would throb regardless, whilst he rolled idle,
whistling for a breeze, and watching the little catspaws on the
oily surface. Nevertheless, he cracked on all he knew, and carried
three lower top-gallants'ls when his upper tops'ls should have been
furled, making a wet ship of the Queen. If he could not beat steam,
at least he might set up a record in the way of passages.</p>
<p>So he did, too, but not quite in the way he had intended.</p>
<p>Finding that the breeze lightened, he kept more to the
southward, got the wind, stronger, and edged away just a little
more, until he found himself suddenly beset with ice that seemed to
have sprung up in a single night and hemmed him in. At sunset the
horizon had been clear; but all through the dark hours came the
cries from the look-out men; and, as day broke, the Queen, under
short canvas, was groping her way amongst great bergs, into what
appeared to be the only open water&mdash;due southward. But that
proved simply a cul-de-sac; and the night found her so closely
pressed that, sending down her topgallant masts, taking every
stitch of sail off, and cock-billing her yards to prevent them from
being snapped short off, Captain Frank made her fast to a big berg,
and for the first time in his life envied steam.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Just four days after the Ocean Queen, the Pakaweera left Port
Chalmers, her hold full of thousands of carcasses of frozen beef
and mutton, and her saloon and second class of passengers, fares
being lowered by reason of a certain great exhibition, to whose
opening many of the travellers were bound. But they missed that
ceremony, being destined to other experiences.</p>
<p>As the &quot;frozen-meater&quot; steadily churned along, Captain
Harry kept a good lookout for his brother, as for the time their
courses lay on the same parallel, and the wind was so strong and
fair he judged that there would be no necessity for the Queen to
make much southing whilst it lasted.</p>
<p>But, as we know, Captain Frank had cracked on during the first
week, and sent his ship along at a higher average speed than that
of any cargo boat. So the Pakaweera saw nothing of the sailer; and
kept her course straight for the entrance to the Straits of
Magellan.</p>
<p>And, one night, the weather mild for these latitudes, and the
sea calm, with some people dancing on the broad promenade deck to
the sounds of piano and violin, whilst others were having a last
pipe and a nightcap in the smoke-rooms, all at once there came a
startling, rushing, clattering clamor of iron, steel, and brass
gone mad from the engine-room that shook the ship in her every
plate and screw and stringer.</p>
<p>It lasted perhaps for two minutes at the outside, and was
succeeded by a silence that seemed eerie&mdash;a silence broken
only by the lip-lap of the little waves along the ship's sides as
she glided steadily through them without the so-familiar throb of
the engines or muffled plunging of the propeller. And, as everyone
stood in their places intently listening, the ship's way gradually
grew less and less, and presently ceasing altogether, she lay
quietly at rest in a sort of curiously-emphatic manner, that forced
instantaneous conviction on her people's minds that she had done
all that she ever meant to do, at any rate in the old fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;Shaft and propeller both clean gone&quot; was presently
the chief engineer's report. This is a matter there is no getting
the better of on the average ocean cargo-carrier, or, indeed, in
any other steamers. Certainly they set a couple of rags of
trysails, with about the same effect as two pocket handkerchiefs
might have on the cathedral of St. Paul in London city. And,
helpless as a haystack, the big ship drifted, first back the track
she had come, then westward again; then, at the end of a month, she
got into the same current that had taken hold on the Queen, and
sagged steadily southward towards the land of everlasting ice.
Through the day a string of colors fluttered at her gaff, bright in
the clear frosty air. Through the night long dismal blasts from her
syren wailed an appeal to the stars for the help that never came.
Steamers, as a rule, are not provisioned against the unforseen, and
such matters as table luxuries soon gave out. Of course they could
hardly starve&mdash;at least for some years&mdash;although a diet
of frozen mutton and beef would be apt to pall in the course of
time. Still, meat they were certain of. Also, there was, somewhere
below, 500 tons of flour. Thus their daily bread was assured. But
the bewildered, wind-driven people took little solace from these
reflections; and as time passed with hideous monotony of drifting,
both crew and passengers grew morose and hopeless, realising more
strongly every day that about their ultimate fate, should there be
no change, was very little uncertainty. And, both fore and aft,
they used to wake o' nights for a long time to the thump, thump of
the refrigerating engine, and imagine for a minute that all the
past weary weeks were but a dream. More than once, too, bad weather
came upon them&mdash;gales of wind and heavy seas, in which the
ship was tossed and rolled and pitched about in what seemed a very
paroxysm of elemental scorn. To keep her head to the wind and sea
was almost an impossibility. With her huge bulk she was like a
whale with his tail cut off&mdash;able to float, but no more. How
often in these dark days did Captain Harry envy the man who could
look aloft to decent masts and yards with a fair spread of canvas.
But she won through the bad weather, and it was actually almost
with a sense of relief that her people, one day, after entering the
ice-pack that guards the southern continent, found themselves
frozen hard and fast in one of its moving masses.</p>
<p>So, like a great ghost, the Pakaweera drifted powerless,
forlorn, wailing mournfully at intervals through the Antarctic
nights. Some ships, they thought, might have kept too far to the
south.</p>
<p>And one had.</p>
<p>Nigh on three months had gone by since the accident to the
propeller. It was bitterly cold; but as yet death had not visited
them. Black despair was in their hearts. Escape from their prison
seemed further off than ever.</p>
<p>On the foremast an improvised &quot;crow's nest&quot; had been
rigged, and one cold dawning came therefrom a loud cry. Those of
the watch on deck, following an outstretched arm, saw a line of
tall bergs very different to the pack-ice that had surrounded them
for so long.</p>
<p>But the wonderful thing was that between the double peaks of one
of the bergs sat, broadside, facing them, a ship&mdash;a
full-rigged ship, with topgallant-masts down, awnings spread, and,
apparently, all ataunto, although quite a hundred feet above their
own level. In a minute the Pakaweera's decks were full of shivering
watchers. Presently the sun rose, a great red disc behind the ship,
and against the orb every spar, with all its tracery of rigging,
stood out clear and distinct, as if cut out of black cardboard.</p>
<p>As the people stared open-mouthed, the sun cleared the ice
mountains, and slowly to the ship's peak ascended the red Ensign of
Britain, blowing out against the snow like a patch of flame, whilst
the sound of cheering came down to those below. The syren had been
silent for many days with the silence of hopelessness. But there
was always steam kept in one boiler; and, as the Pakaweera's house
flag and Ensign went up, the syren roared and blared a salute that
woke the echoes across those dreary seas, whilst the people cheered
themselves hoarse; not because of help, for that seemed as far out
as ever, but for the utter relief and joyousness of meeting with
their kind when they had deemed themselves alone, deserted to dree
their weird in those wild and savage regions of eternal ice and
snow. Presently Captain Harry, standing on the bridge with a glass
glued to his eye, exclaimed in tones of emphatic astonishment,
&quot;Well, if that isn't the Ocean Queen, call me a
Dutchman!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There goes her number, anyhow,&quot; replied the chief
engineer, who, with his four subordinates and the deck officers
stood close by. &quot;Book, there, quartermaster! Ay, here it
is&mdash;JKPQS. It's the Queen, right enough!&quot;</p>
<p>Was ever before in the varied history of the sea such a meeting?
Surely never!</p>
<p>&quot;And look at her!&quot; exclaimed the second mate, who, two
voyages ago, had &quot;found salvation&quot; at the hands of the
Dunedin &quot;Army;&quot; a note of awe in his voice, &quot;placed
there by the Lord's own hand, perhaps as a sign and a warning to
those who, like so many miserable sinners, have ceased to believe
in His works.&quot; Then, with an abrupt degeneration into the very
bathos of simile, &quot;Ay, look at her, stuck up there for all the
world like a full model in a glass case over a public house.
Har!&quot;</p>
<p>When first sighted the bergs and the ship were quite a mile
distant from the Pakaweera, with a strip of clear water between.
But, attracted perhaps by the great mass ahead, the drift became
stronger; and about midday the outer edge of the pack reached the
ice-hills. The shock of the impact was strong enough to shake the
Pakaweera violently, although it seemed to take no effect on the
massive chain of linked bergs. Those watching, however, saw the
edges of the pack curl up like soil under a plough-share, up, up,
ridge upon ridge, until what had been an inaccessible precipice was
now a gently sloping mound of ice reaching right up to the Ocean
Queen. But, long before this, the Code had been at work, and
something learned on both sides.</p>
<p>Now, down the road so providentially formed, people were seen
sliding and running from the Ocean Queen. The distance between the
two ships had been lessened to not much over a quarter of a mile,
and their respective companies met each other half way. The
brothers were the first to shake hands, and the few broken words of
greeting over, Captain Frank, who looked haggard and carewarn;
pointing to the Pakaweera, said &quot;What about steam now, Harry?
The other glanced toward the sailing ship, but made no answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; said Frank, following his eye, &quot;it's six
of one and seven of the other, this time, anyhow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How seven, old chap?&quot; queried his brother, as they
walked along.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of time,&quot; replied Frank, with a smile.
&quot;I'll show you, bye-and-bye, why I claim the odd
trick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're all there, didn't you signal?&quot; asked Captain
Harry presently.</p>
<p>&quot;All there, thank God!&quot; answered Frank. &quot;And the
same with you, you say? But, if you hadn't shown up, we couldn't
have held out more than another week, at the uttermost. Precious
low diet, I can tell you, this last month&mdash;less than half
rations. How on earth did we get up there? Simply enough. After
first meeting the ice, we never had a show at all&mdash;not a ghost
of a chance of getting clear. We were in big stuff, and so thick
that all we could do was to out fenders and fasten on. Then it was
drift, drift, drift, until one night our berg sidled gently up
against another big one. If there'd been much way on, we should
have been crushed to smithereens; as it was, they pressed us
steadily up, up, up, until we came out on top; not as high as we
are now, of course; we've grown a lot since. I reckon we must have
looked to you something like that tin ship on the spire of Shadwell
Church. Before you came along we were right up and down&mdash;could
spit 150ft sheer all round. Is she hurt, d'ye say? Why, man, she
hasn't a sound plate in her hull. She's like an egg, hard-boiled,
that's been bashed all over with a spoon.&quot;</p>
<p>A rather pallid, scraggy lot looked the crew of the Queen,
rescued from their aerial prison by what seemed to them an almost
miraculous chance. But there was no sickness amongst them, only a
ravening for tobacco and &quot;a fresh feed!&quot; They got both;
there was plenty of the weed on board the Pakaweera. And the
steamer's cooks had been busy all the morning, so that the sailer's
men were soon hard at work upon great buckets of soup and junks of
boiled beef and mutton.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; asked Captain Harry of his brother, as, after a
meal, the pair sat and smoked and sipped their hot grog alongside
the stove, that had been placed in the former's room on the bridge.
&quot;Now, explain your riddle of six of one and seven of the
other. I don't see it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do.&quot; laughed the other, puffing away at a huge
briar with the complete enjoyment of the long-deprived.
&quot;S'pose the poor old Queen up yonder was another steamer,
where would we be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where we are now, I should imagine,&quot; replied Captain
Harry.</p>
<p>&quot;More so,&quot; answered his brother; &quot;and we'd
probably leave our bones here when we'd finished your cargo. But
now we've got a chance, and a good one.&quot;</p>
<p>But the other only stared uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Harry, Harry!&quot; exclaimed Captain Frank, in
affected sorrow. &quot;See what it is to be only a steamboat
sailor. Don't you understand what I'm driving at? No; I see you
don't, poor chap. Well, when I've got this old tank of yours
brig-rigged with a couple of the Queen's masts stuck in her and a
few acres of the Queen's sails spread from the Queen's yards to
drive her along, you'll begin to get a glimpse of my plan, won't
you, and the reason why I think I'm entitled to the extra
number?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the height&mdash;,&quot; began his brother.</p>
<p>&quot;Height me no heights!&quot; exclaimed Captain Frank:
&quot;I've got the whole thing cut and dried. &quot;Turn every soul
to&mdash;passengers and all&mdash;and I'll show you what a
sailorman bred to canvas can do when he's cornered like we
are.&quot;</p>
<p>In a few more minutes, so convincing were Captain Frank's
arguments, the boatswain's whistle chirped and twittered &quot;All
hands!&quot; and to the two crews gathered on the steamer's quarter
deck was explained the one chance that remained of extrication from
their present position. Captain Frank's little speech was received
with cheers both by seamen and passengers, all demanding to be set
to work at once, lest, as the captain had hinted, the ice might
break, and their plight be rendered worse than ever. So, almost
without intermission, the crews toiled at dismantling the Ocean
Queen, whilst the crowd of passengers, gentle and simple alike,
worked at levelling the ascent which was encumbered with great
blocks of ice and deep holes and ravines, left after the collision
with the outer fringe of the pack. As for the 'bergs themselves
they appeared to reach to the horizon, innumerable, massive, and
immovable.</p>
<p>So, day and night, with short spells for meals and drinks of hot
soup and coffee, every soul, except the cooks, labored. Even the
women, on the second day, came out and insisted on carrying things
from the Queen down the now nearly finished roadway. And a curious
spectacle it was to hear in that dreary scene of white desolation
the clank and whirr of the Queen's donkey engine, the shouts of the
men aloft to those on deck; the steady chipping and delving of
picks and shovels and fire-bars upon the icy track leading up the
breast of the 'berg. Curious, too, of nights, when the Pakaweera's
searchlight lit up the scene, to see the black figures ascending
and descending laden with all sorts of small articles that could
not be safely entrusted to the sledges that, attached to wire
ropes, were presently made to run from the Queen to the foot of the
slope, lowered, and hauled up by her engine. That vessel herself
was now stripped to her lower-masts, and to get these out without
crane or derrick seemed an impossibility; but Captain Frank had
made his plans. And, presently breaking cargo, out came the bales
of wool, only to be sent flying down the breast of levelled snow
and ice in tens and twenties, bounding in the air like huge
footballs, many whose bands remained in tact nearly reaching the
Pakaweera's side.</p>
<p>Very considerably lightened, the ice was now cut away from under
the Queen's keel, wire ropes taken from her mastheads to the
steamer's powerful engines, the ship hove slowly on to her beam
ends, and the masts dragged out of her like so many teeth&mdash;out
and down and across the well tramped ice to the Pakaweera, whose
big derricks thereupon took hold of them and swung them safely into
the places prepared for them by the engineers and carpenters.
Another week, and Captain Frank professed himself satisfied. The
Pakaweera was transformed into a brig, all a-taut from royal-yards
down; from her straight, sharp stem protruded the Queen's bowsprit
and jibboom, looking as if they didn't belong certainly, but for
all that effective. A curious, transformation it seemed to the
Pakaweera's crew as they stared up at the maze of rigging and
running gear in place of the couple of naked poles to which they
had been so long accustomed. But Captain Frank was jubilant.
&quot;I'd have made a full-rigged ship out of her,&quot; said he,
&quot;only our mizzen wasn't sound&mdash;always had a flaw, and
strained badly in the ice.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll do, though, nicely now. The ice can break when it
likes!&quot; But there was no sign of its ever breaking any more.
Of course, a great amount of the Pakaweera's cargo was consumed;
and there was considerable room in her holds&mdash;so much, indeed,
that, for want of something better to do, the crew stowed in them
nearly 300 bales of wool, besides carrying away pretty well
everything of any value from the poor old carcass up there on the
ice hill. And at last the ice gave signs of breaking, and there
began a time of peril by night and by day, for the big chain of
'bergs also broke from their moorings, and before a strong
south-west wind insisted on keeping them far too close company.
Especially was it remarked that the double peaked one upon which
lay the dead body of the Queen, time after time seemed bent upon
fouling and destroying them. Thus it was somewhat of a relief to
see finally another and a bigger berg collide with and smash Mount
Misery, as the sailors called it, into fragments amongst which
disappeared and sank the battered and shattered corpse of the once
smart and beautiful clipper.</p>
<p>A week of imminent danger, and the Pakaweera reached the open
sea, and, with a fair wind sailed along, averaging about six knots,
and having undoubtedly made the best of a very bad job. There was
talk of putting into Rio and trying to refit. But, eventually, it
was decided to keep going, it being doubtful whether such repairs
as they wanted could be effected there. Long ago given up for lost,
it came as a surprise indeed to the owners when, one day, the
telegraph announced &quot;Passed up channel S.S. Pakaweera from
Port Chalmers. Under sail only.&quot;</p>
<p>At first they thought it was a mistake. But it was not
altogether a mistake&mdash;not altogether, because, if the
Pakaweera's body was there so was the soul of the Ocean Queen.</p>
<p>Of course there was litigation. And a very pretty thing it was
for the lawyers. The owners of the Queen claimed salvage, inasmuch
as, without her assistance, evidently the Pakaweera would never
have got out of the ice. Admitted by counsel without demur.
&quot;But where,&quot; asked my learned friend, &quot;would the
3000 bales and the stores, etc.. of the Queen have been without the
Pakaweera's help?&quot; There was no mention of human lives in the
matter at all. Eventually the court decided that it really was a
case of six of one and half a dozen of the other, and dismissed the
case, each side paying its own costs.</p>
<p>But Captain Frank was very wrath, and argued, many people
thought successfully, that he was entitled to the extra number.</p>

<p>No sailor-man likes railway iron, any more than he likes bricks
or coal or guano. But, on the other hand, very few sailors indeed
know the nature of the cargo they are to be shipmates with until
they have been at least a week at sea perhaps not even then. But in
our case it was different. Most of us had boarded the Staffa at
Gravesend late one evening, in no mood to criticise the ship or
much else. When, however, we were roused out at daylight, and found
ourself committed to a voyage to Australia on a craft with such a
small show of freeboard that we could stand in her old-fashioned
chains and dip a bucket of water without much of a stoop, a certain
curiosity as to what she was carrying took hold upon us. Some
suggested lead, others stone; then the boatswain told us that she
was three parts steel rails and the rest tin plates. It was before
the days of Plimsoll marks, and ships often left British ports
outrageously deep without exciting comment. Still we imagined, as
we towed down the river, that other folk on passing crafts stared
at us wonderingly. Also the skipper of a hay barge, with his cargo
almost awash, instituted insulting comparisons between the Staffa
and the Susan, and asked us why we didn't pump the water out of our
hold before going to sea. This didn't make us for'ard any the more
comfortable, and, penniless as we were, we would have all been glad
enough to find ourselves back again in the Weds-street boarding
house, cold and inhospitable as we knew our reception there would
be. As for the afterguard they contented themselves with flinging a
few curses after the saucy master of the Susan.</p>
<p>In Humbug Reach we met a Geordie collier under sail, and deep
enough in all conscience but still able to look well down on our
decks. And her men asked impertinent questions, as we slid slowly
past, as to our cargo and destination suggesting that we should
call at Shields to fill up; hinting that we should all be
web-footed in a week, and that, eventually, our port would be Davy
Jones's locker. Off the South Foreland the tug left us, and making
sail in the Staffa we wallowed down Channel already with decks wet
from the break of the poop to the foc'sle doors. But for her trim
we found the ship comfortable enough. It was before the day of
mixed crews, and both sides of Staffa's foc'sle were British. And
if we were never dry at least we were never hungry. Nor were we
overworked. Indeed, work about the decks, except in a calm, was
wellnigh impossible. During a blow in the Bay of Biscay we, for two
days, were kneedeep in water fore and aft. As to washing down, such
a thing was never thought of. Instead, we threw sand about, and at
times tried to scrub off the slime that gradually accumulated on
the planking. The Staffa was a very old vessel, and portions of her
hull and spars were absolutely crumbling with dry rot. Her running
and standing gear was also in such a state as kept us almost
constantly attending to it. And the executive was old, too. The
skipper was not far short of 70, perfectly bald, wearing a long
grey beard, but still hale, hearty, and active; then the chief and
second, also bald and bearded, were well on in the sixties. The
youngest of them all was the boatswain, an old sea dog of about 50,
looking quite youthful when seen in company with his superiors,
whom the crew irreverently named Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. A
second mate, with no hair on his head and a long grey beard, which
in heavy weather he used to snarl down with spun yarn to keep it
from blowing about, seemed to us a specially abnormal species of
&quot;greaser.&quot; But, old though they were, they were all fine
seamen, and worthy of a better ship than the overladen and decrepit
Staffa. Among the most pathetic sights in the world is a seaman
standing on the narrow borderland that separates action from
incapacity. Of course this holds true of all men; but more
particularly as regards the old sailor, who, after a lifetime of
activity, finds the time at hand when he must confess to having
outlived his usefulness, or be told so by others. And perhaps the
three old men aft felt that for them such a time was fast
approaching, for they were ever grave and silent, scanning the sea
with weary, tired eyes. At first we thought they might be brothers,
so like were they in looks and bearing. But later we discovered
that they had met for the first time on board the Staffa,
foregathered doubtless in obedience to the unswerving law that to
indigent age there is no choice except of the worst. Probably old,
worn-out, and overladen as she was, the Staffa, but for the three
patriarchs, driven by their need, might have waited long enough for
officers.</p>
<p>For'ard we were young and thoughtless, and had at first been
inclined to make merry at the expense of the old tub and her
officers. But gradually, as time wore on and we rolled and splashed
through the N.E. trades, fried on the Line, with the first dry
decks since leaving London, then squattered up to our knees again
across the South Atlantic, our environments began to tell upon us.
And what with the everlasting wet, the sad and silent afterguard,
the interminable passage&mdash;we were three months out ere we
reached the latitude of the Cape&mdash;our spirits were effectually
quenched, and we went about our business in as sober and thoughtful
a mood as the aged trio themselves.</p>
<p>The boatswain, who was also sailmaker and carpenter, shared a
small house amidships with the cook and steward. The last-named was
a jovial little Cockney, and he had a concertina, which, during the
first part of the voyage, he used to perform on during the dog
watches. But in time his surroundings proved too much for him, and
he buried the instrument at the bottom of his chest, and took to
reading the Bible late and early, to the deterioration of his
work.</p>
<p>About this time both provisions and water began to run short;
and, seeing that even with luck it would take us another three
months to reach Adelaide, the captain bore up for Capetown to
revictual. But the Fates decreed otherwise, for they sent a
succession of nor'-west gales down upon us that battered the old
Staffa so sorely as to force us to square away before them. But she
was too deep to run with safety; so we hove her to, and she lay
like a half-tide rook, at intervals filling her decks from rail to
rail.</p>
<p>Then, one night, the cargo shifted, and the rails fought
furiously among themselves, making such a noise as could be heard
loud above the din of the storm, whilst every moment we expected
some of them would go clean through her sides, and thus drown us
out of hand. In the morning, the gale eased off, and we got sail on
the Staffa and drove before the wind due east, with a biscuit
apiece, in the bread barge, and two ounces of preserved meat per
man for breakfast. With the wind as far aft as it could get, the
Staffa rolled rail under, and to take the hatches off and attempt
to square up matters below would have been suicide. Bump, smash,
crash, we could hear them as they flung from one side to the other,
looking for a soft spot in her skin. And still the well was dry.
So, while the great combers rolled astern and overhung the lifeless
ship by a good twenty feet, we rolled along, standing by the boats,
and ready to lower away at a minute's notice out of the fryingpan
into the fire. By noon we were all living aft. The t'gallant
foc's'le had long been under water; the saloon was still fairly
dry, although at times the sea rippled up over the washboards at
the doors, and flooded the interior. One would have imagined that
the Staffa was too deep to roll after the insane fashion she did,
and with the list to port, that was rapidly getting more apparent
and more uncomfortable. Suddenly the end came. One morning, at four
bells (10 o'clock), the boatswain brought up his sounding rod with
four feet of wet showing on it. After pumping for an hour, the rod
showed six feet. Evidently it was time to leave. But the ancient
executive appeared to be in no hurry. The captain, calling all
hands into the saloon, and first serving out a generous tot of rum,
put the question to the vote. There was, he said, perhaps a week's
quarter rations per man left. The boats were nearly as old as the
ship. We were 2000 miles from the nearest inhabited land. The water
remaining would allow just one pint per day for a week all round.
We were quite out of the track of ships. Probably there lay before
us much misery, torture of mind and body, and, in the end, the same
fate, only more cruel and prolonged, than if we went down with the
ship. But he added: &quot;Although myself and my two officers think
that no good can come, but probably much suffering, of taking to
the boats, still in such an extremity we are willing to be ruled by
the opinion of the majority. We are all three old men to whom life
has proved more or less a disappointment, and who feel little
inclination to prolong what promises to be a useless and painful
struggle, with a bitter ending. But, then, most of you are young
men, to whom life is sweet; and, after all, there may be a chance.
I have thought it my duty to put before you how slight that chance
is. Now those who are in favor of the boats will hold up their
hands,&quot;</p>
<p>It was a curious speech for any shipmaster to make; but in
response to it the hands of both watches showed unanimously that
their owners were not yet tired of life. The only ones who gave no
sign were the captain and his two mates, and, to our surprise, the
cook. The boatswain was with us.</p>
<p>&quot;May the Lord have mercy upon us,&quot; said the captain,
in a low voice, as he led the way on deck. And as we gazed on the
dreary, grey southern sea lifting its foam-flecked rollers to the
grey sky that ringed in the empty horizon, and then glanced at the
three rusty scarred old boats in which we were to commit ourselves
to that desolate waste of waters we to a man felt the necessity of
the captain's prayer.</p>
<p>There was no trouble in launching them, because the Staffa's
lee-rail was under water when she rolled, so that we had only to
watch our chance. Hardly had the last boat shoved off when the end
unexpectedly came, and the Staffa, leaning slowly over towards us,
deliberately capsized, her masts breaking like carrots as they
struck the water, whilst from at least a dozen spots along her port
topsides protruded rails that had pierced her poor old body. For a
minute or two she floated, showing us a keel strained and warped,
and sides and bottom almost dismantled of copper, but rich with
weed and barnacles. Then without much ado she sank slowly out of
sight.</p>
<p>Already in each of the boats the balers were at work on the
water that poured through the leaky seams, and it appeared truly as
if that huge grave of ocean in which we swam was ready to receive
us sooner than the old skipper had predicted. All at once the
boatswain shouted to the second mate, in whose boat he was,
&quot;Isn't that a sail away to leu'ard, sir?&quot; The second
rose, and adjusted his binocular, looking, as he stood with one arm
round the mast, and his marled queue of a beard sticking straight
and stiff from his chin, like some strange, hornless old
billy-goat. After a few minutes' scrutiny, he announced, &quot;A
barque, under close-reefed fore and main tawps'ls;&quot; and, with
a cheer, the three boats bore down upon her. She must have swung
into sight whilst we were watching the dying Staffa, and a watery
gleam of sunshine resting on her sails had caught the sharp eye of
the boatswain.</p>
<p>As we approached, we could see that the stranger was a large
iron barque of some 1200 tons or so, showing a tall side out of the
water, and with the Spanish flag flying reversed from her signal
halliards. There seemed to be nobody on board, and with some little
difficulty we climbed up the davit falls that hung empty to the
water, and so on deck. Here the first object to meet our eyes was a
dead man rolling to and fro with the motion of the ship&mdash;a
swarthy, desperate-looking customer, with a sheath knife still
sticking between his ribs, For'ard, two more of much the same
kidney were lying; but these had been killed by shooting. The cabin
into which we all crowded, treading on each other's heels, was a
fine and spacious apartment, but filled with such a dreadful odor
as almost forced us to retire, and compared with which that from
the bodies on deck was absolutely inoffensive. The smell here
proceeded from the body of a tall old man, lashed to a chain at the
head of the cabin table, and evidently shot as he sat, for he was
riddled with bullets. The atmosphere was unnaturaly warm, and some
of us glanced round inquiringly for a stove or grate, in which a
fire might be still smouldering. But there was nothing of the
kind.</p>
<p>Every berth had been overhauled, and all sorts of dunnage lay in
disorder around us. Not a scrap of paper was to be found anywhere.
But on the after-bell the name was &quot;Cervantes.&quot; An ocean
tragedy of the worst kind evidently. One, however, that seemed to
put fresh life into our ancient officers. The magic virtue of
salvage had gotten hold upon them, and they hustled around after a
fashion that amazed us. Then, in a few hours we had the deck
cleared, the dead men overboard to a few words of prayer from our
skipper, sail made, and the barque heading for Australia.</p>
<p>Provisions and water there was an abundance of, and soon the
cook had the best meal ready that we had eaten for weeks. Amidships
was a fine deck-house, littered with empty chests, worn-out
sailors' clothes, sea boots, and similar jetsam that one sees in
deserted forecastles, or in those whose inmates have had to leave
in a hurry. And of this we took possession, helped by many oddments
of bedding, etc., from aft.</p>
<p>As may be imagined, we were all in great glee and thankfulness
at our most unlooked-for escape from almost certain death, not to
mention possible share of salvage money looming up ahead. That
first night the captain and the mates complained much of the heat,
and at last were forced to come on deck and camp there, although we
were in 40deg south. This, to say the least of it, was curious.
There was also a pungent smell of burning rags that puzzled
everybody.</p>
<p>But when in the morning the after hatches were taken off the
riddle was solved. The ship was on fire. She was laden with cotton,
possibly from the Philippines, and before leaving her the
mutineers, or whatever they might have been, had set the cargo
alight. As yet, as far as we could judge, the fire did not appear
to have got a great hold. There were no flames visible, and by the
absence of heat for'ard we hoped it was confined to the after part
of the ship. So, clapping on the hatches again, we got the deck
pump to work through a hole cut in them, and poured tons of water
on the smouldering cargo.</p>
<p>For a time this seemed to have the desired effect. But for a
time only. The fire had evidently got a grip; for, presently, a
fine acrid smoke was discovered issuing from the 'midship
ventilator. Then the pumps brought up lumps of charred cotton.
Meanwhile, our skipper carried on with everything he dared show to
the roaring westerlies. Never, probably, in all his career had he
driven a ship as he drove the Cervantes, and she with her fine
lines responded readily, so that we made good runs day by day
towards Sirius&mdash;our nearest port in the great South Land.
Whole topsails and courses, and fore and aft and main t'gnllant
sails the old man treated her to, when under ordinary circumstances
she would have been &quot;snugged down.&quot; But we were running a
race with death, and we knew it. Day by day the ship got hotter,
day by day thicker and more menacing grew the smoke wreaths from
the ventilators. All the water we pumped seemed to take no effect;
and our sole comfort was that the fire appeared to work forward
very slowly. Still, on the morning we made the land snakes of black
smoke were curling out of the ventilator just be-aft the foremast,
and blowing away to leeward. Aft the heat was almost unbearable,
amd the helmsmen simply sweltered at their post. In a very short
time a pilot steamer came alongside. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;
hailed her skipper. &quot;We're on fire,&quot; replied ours.</p>
<p>&quot;I should smile,&quot; said the colonial, as he started his
steam pumps going against our iron sides, off which the paint had
peeled in great patches. And at that minute the long expected
happened, and with a cannon-like report the fore hatches blew off,
whilst a pillar of smoke and flame shot skyward. To starboard a tug
hovered irresolutely. Before she could make up her mind flames
broke out amidships, and it became evident that the Cervantes was
doomed. The pilot steamer took us all off, and the last man had
scarcely left the barque when she blew up and sank in thirty
fathoms of water, whilst three old men with grimy faces and beards
stared with haggard eyes at the grave of the vain salvage, knowing
that their last chance had gone, and that for them was little left
except the workhouse.</p>

<p><b>PART I.</b></p>
<p>&quot;If the Lord sends the tucker, the devil sends the
cooks!&quot; exclaimed a sailor as he stood at the galley door of
the Mary (brigantine), and eyed with disgust a mess-kid full of
&quot;duff&quot; that the cook had just handed to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hu!&quot; replied the other, indignantly. &quot;What yo'
know 'bout cookin'. I cook in big ship 'fore now&mdash;ship dat
take lil trash like dis for long boat. Yo' be tankful, yo' sailor
man, yo' got B'bados gen'elman o' colour what understans the
circumambiation o' the collinary purfesshin' to cook for
yo.&quot;</p>
<p>The sailor grinned sourly, and, muttering something about a
&quot;blurry nigger,&quot; moved away towards his mates of the
watch, impatiently waiting on the fo'c's'le-head for the second
course of their dinner.</p>
<p>The Mary was from &quot;The Islands,&quot; meaning, in her case,
the Samoan and the Gilbert Groups, bound to Sydney with a cargo of
copra. At present she lay becalmed almost exactly on the Tropic of
Capricorn, with the southern extremity of New Caledonia bearing
north-east some sixty miles distant. She was a smart craft of 300
tons, painted white, and looking particularly lofty by reason of
her tall fore and main royal poles; her larger canvas for'ard was
clewed up, and her fore and aft sails brailed in or hauled down;
big bunches of green bananas hung ripening on her forestay,
swinging to the gentle roll of her; whilst everywhere about her,
pervading all things, was the rank, rich odour of the sun dried
cocoanuts that formed her cargo. Aft, the skipper and his two mates
swung in hammocks under the awning; for'ard the watch below chewed
on their salt pork, stringy yams, and sodden duff, which last they
presently amused themselves by kneading into big three-cornered
pellets that, as they threw them at the galley, rebounded as if
made of india rubber, and went hopping about the decks.</p>
<p>Presently a huge black foot appeared over the sill of the galley
door, planted itself upon the deck, and was followed by another;
then there stepped out the owner of the pair, a stout woolly-haired
negro as black as the ace of spades, and, making a very emphatic
blotch of colour against the white bulwarks and the dazzling
sunshine that played upon them. His thick wool glistened with
perfumed cocoanut oil, his face with sweat, which he wiped off on a
dingy apron he wore tucked around his waist.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind yer heye, Doctor!&quot; shouted one of the men, and a
dough pellet whizzed past his broad, squat nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Hu! de white trash!&quot; he snorted, an ugly look coming
into his eyes. &quot;S'pose I have yo' in B'bados now I give yo'
hell! Yo're too mighty perticlar to lib! S'pose you bin on the
bucko Murkin ship I bin, yo' git scoffed an' chawed in de one
act!&quot; Which was probable enough, for, unlike most of his
compatriots Naaman Elisha Baffin was a fair seaman, although as a
cook beneath contempt.</p>
<p>The regular &quot;doctor&quot; of the Mary having levanted in
Samoa, Naaman, who, whilst in the fo'c'sle, had been
growler-in-chief and cook worrier, and was continually boasting of
what he could do if he had the chance given him, was at once
promoted to fill the billet. Proving a sorry failure, retribution
was now overtaking him, and he didn't at all like the sauce that he
had been so officious in serving out to his predecessor. But his
conceit was sublime; and he felt much as a Soyer or Brillat-Savarin
might have done if their creations had been found fault with by a
sans culotte. Indeed, he honestly believed that he was an artist,
and put down all the strong hints to the contrary that he received
from both fo'c's'le and cabin as so many signs of jealousy and
envy.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that stuff you gave us for dinner, Doctor?&quot;
asked the second mate presently, as he strolled along the deck and
paused opposite to where Naaman sat smoking on the rail.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat, sah,&quot; replied the cook, proudly, &quot;war an
inventation all out ob my own 'ead, sah. Make it often long time
gone in B'bados. De coloured gen'elman dere cognomonize it
'Baffin's Best Supe'iau Curry.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um,&quot; remarked the Second, doubtfully, as he drew a
dipper of water from the scuttlebutt and drank thirstily. &quot;I'm
glad you told me because I should have taken it for mashed yams and
pea soup, with a touch of supe'iau hell in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lil chili, sah, green chili, dat all,&quot; replied
Naaman, &quot;wid jest a 'spicion o' kyehan, which am good ting,
sah, for de disgestion ob de gestrical juices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Skipper don't seem to think so, anyhow, Doctor,&quot;
retorted the Second, grimly. &quot;He's swearin' he's got eternal
punishment workin' away in his innards since he swallowed the
'Supe'iau.' You stand by for squalls if a fair wind don't soon
spring up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hu!&quot; muttered Naaman, as the other walked
away,&quot;dey'm all alike. So 'elp me, Gahdamighty, dere ain't no
pleasin' 'em for' no' aft on dis cussed hooker! Dey don't know a
supe'iau cook when they get 'im. No use any fellah doin' his bes'
and tryin' to demonstrake his ca'bilities when he ain't
'prees'hiated by de bosses. Hu! an ornery lot, yo'!&quot; he
continued, turning aft; &quot;but an ornerier lot, yo',&quot;
turning for'ard, &quot;an' fit for nawthen but to lib on stewed
copra, de two lots ob you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boat on the port bo-o-w!&quot; suddenly shouted one of the
men who had gone out on the flying jibboom, to whistle for wind.
And as at his cry all hands rushed to the side, sure enough, they
saw, about half a mile away, a small, crazy-looking dingey, in
which stood a man, sculling with a single oar astern. It was
terribly hot, but he never paused a minute until he sheared his
craft alongside, and, giving her a shove astern, at the same time,
agile as a cat, leapt into the chains, and scrambled over the rail
on to the Mary's deck. A tall, thin, brown man, with sharp, quick
eyes, and bristling moustache that jutted straight and aggressive
on each side of his nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ha,&quot; he exclaimed briskly, after one
comprehensive glance around, &quot;Engleesh sheep! Ver' goot! Me
matelot&mdash;you savee&mdash;sailor. Wreck; all sink but me. I
sweem catch a boat, ver' ongree. Only two fecsh one wick. You taka
me. Me vor-r-rk, ah ciel! like von o' de clock. You see! Me cook,
me matelot; me anything. A1, fust chop! You see.&quot;</p>
<p>All this was delivered with breathless volubility and wonderful
wealth of gesture, as he turned his gaze from stolid face to face
around him.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Johnny,&quot; said, the skipper, laughing.
&quot;Don't be scared. We ain't goin' to turn ye adrift same as you
did that dug-out o' yours. But you keep that yarn to tell to the
Sydney Marines&mdash;if needs be. Not that any of us is like to
blow the gaff on you. But you mustn't take us altogether for new
chums, Johnny, La Nouvelle's still too close aboard for that,
eh?&quot;</p>
<p>And at that dread name all the man's vivacity and life went out
of him like wind out of a pricked bladder, and down he flopped on
his knees, and with uplifted hands and streaming eyes began a long
appeal which the old skipper ruthlessly cut short with &quot;There,
there Johnny, keep your head shut. You've had the pluck to do it
that's certain. But we don't want to hear how you did it. Now you
go for'ard and get some tucker, If you can find anythin' fit to
eat. And you, Naaman, you black son of a gun, you vamose that
galley, and let Johnny there have a show afore you kills the whole
crowd. My belly's a-burning like hot coals, yet, after that last
mess o' yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I no son ob a gun, sah!&quot; exclaimed the deeply
offended Naaman; &quot;I coloured. B'bados gen'elman, sah, an'
British subjec', sah, all same as yo'. Likewise extrah superfine
supe'iau cook, sah. I begs to arbitrate to yo', sah, dat yo' not
accordating I de umbrageous satisfaction, sah&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, there, less slack jaw,&quot; broke in the Old Man;
&quot;damn it, you'd talk the fifth wheel off a coach.&quot; And
seeing there was no help for it, Naaman sulkily shifted his
belongings out of the little berth next the galley, girding all the
while at &quot;de Frens trash,&quot; who already was making himself
at home amongst the pots and pans, after a fashion that made Naaman
hate him. And he hated him more than ever when, for tea, the
mysteriously arrived cook gave the men of the Mary such a feast as
they had never dreamt of before&mdash;delicious scones; a pie whose
crust melted in the mouth; dough-nuts like brown balls of
sweetness; and a superb treacle roley-poley.</p>
<p>&quot;That chap's a cook, Naaman, not a blurry himpostor like
you,&quot; said a man, licking his fingers in huge good humour. You
blurry nigh' killed us, you woolly heathen, you know you did! You'd
'best give Johnny Crappo that swell Sunday suit o' yourn, an' go
an' get lessons from 'im afore you puts yourself hup for a cook
agen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yo' call I 'eathen, Joe Bunce, an' I make yo' sorry,&quot;
replied Naaman, his grasp tightening around the handle of the
sheath knife he was using for his food. &quot;I baptised an'
regenerative Chrischun, wid godfadder an' godmuddur jes' like anny
oder British subjec', an' I let yo' know it am a fac'; an' I knock
de stuffin' out o' yo'. Dat so.&quot; And the other, glancing
furtively at the scowling black face, and fierce rolling eyes,
decided to drop the argument. Collectively baiting the ex-cook was
good enough fun. But no one cared about undertaking the contract
single-handed. Also, he had been heard to mutter mysterious hints
as to his possession of occult powers, that only his deep religious
convictions prevented him from using. But there was an
uncomfortable feeling amongst the crew that this safeguard might
give way if pressed too hard; and that in such a case he would be
as bad to deal with as any &quot;Blurry Russian Finn.&quot; The
calm still held; but during that middle watch Naaman was very busy.
And next morning, when &quot;Johnny&quot; was sweeping out his
galley, he picked up an object that excited his curiosity&mdash;a
rough model of a human figure, about three inches long, stained
brown, and covered with oakum, that looked as if it had been
burned; round its neck a rope yarn was knotted tightly; into its
abdomen stiff bristles of a coir broom were stuck spearwise. After
a look, the cook flung it overboard, merely giving a passing
thought to the childishness of the English sailor man.</p>
<p>He had not seen Naaman in the darkness under the top-gallant
fo'c's'le, in the character of a former disciple of Obi, muttering
incantations as he worked, calling down plagues and tortures and
deadly sicknesses upon the usurper of his place; and finishing all
by first setting fire to the image (so might the Frenchman's body
burn in agony), and then driving his teeth into his arm till the
blood shot out, and drenched the figure (so might the blood of his
supplanter be spilled).</p>
<p>Naaman had known such &quot;wangas,&quot; bought from his own
father, at home in the squalid alley at the back of the Government
Buildings in Bridgetown, to work curious and dire results on all
sorts of people&mdash;white, yellow, and black. And it would, he
thought, be hard indeed if the son of such a noted Oboah man had no
inheritance of his power. Therefore, for the first time in many
years, since leaving his native land, he tried his hand at the
game. But, apparently, that hand had lost its cunning for all the
harm its spells were able to do the object of its owner's hate. And
&quot;Johnny,&quot; alias Alexandre Deschamps, put forth all his
skill, and charmed men's stomachs after a fashion that caused them
to sing his praises incessantly. A good cook on a ship is, as in
many other places, like the wife of Scripture, above rubies. And
Captain Newnes was so pleased that, when the wind at last came, he
called his prize aft, and put him on the Articles, pro tem, at a
liberal wage per month. And &quot;Johnny&quot; snapped his fingers,
and danced, and sung, and cooked more deliciously than ever. About
La Nouvelle he was not communicative. He had been there some years;
exiled from his beloved France, under a cruel misconception. Such
cases were continually happening. But what would you? Some men were
born unlucky. As to the life there&mdash;la bas? Then he would
shake his head, and look solemn for a minute, and remark: &quot;But
it was, 'ow you call 'im, a dog of a life. Ah ciel', Mais c'est
fini, maintenant! Et:</p>
<p class="poem">Mon pere est a Paris,<br>
Ma mere est a Versailles,<br>
Et moi je suis ici.</p>
<p>Which was about all the information any of the
&quot;Mary's&quot; ever got out of Johnny.</p>
<p><b>PART II.</b></p>
<p>As it happened, on this trip, the Mary's articles were up, and
the crew were paid off with a six months' cheque.</p>
<p>&quot;Johnny,&quot; said the skipper to the cook, &quot;don't
you leave. You stay by her. We'll be ready again in a fortnight, as
soon as she comes out of dock. And&quot;&mdash;with a knowing
wink&mdash;&quot;you'll be a dashed sight safer here than you would
be ashore; not that any of the chaps 'ud give you away after the
style you lined their binjies for 'em. Still, there's always folk
messin' about&mdash;you savee? Here's a fiver to buy some togs.
Only don't go too far; and don't get tanked. You don't want to see
the Consul, eh?&quot; And the captain grinned. So did Alexandre. So
did Naaman, who was listening, his heart as black as his skin with
rage and envy at being neither paid a cook's wages in place of a
seaman's&mdash;nor, like all the rest, asked to presently return.
Throughout the trip he had tried to make matters unpleasant for his
successor; but without avail, because the whole ship's company was
on Johnny's side.</p>
<p>The Australian authorities are very susceptible with regard to
persons known to the Department of Justice as &quot;New Caledonian
escapees.&quot; Thus, when Naaman, apparelled in black broadcloth,
with shiny top hat, huge patent leather shoes, and fairly
glistening with pomatum and Abyssinian jewellery, told his story at
the General Police Court, a couple of detectives were at once sent
to arrest the luckless Alexandre. Also, rather against his will,
they took the informer with them.</p>
<p>At the time the cook and the mate were the only ones on board
the Mary where she lay alongside the wharf at Miller's Point.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat 'im, gen'elmens,&quot; exclaimed Naaman, standing at
the gangway and pointing. &quot;Dat de Frens convic' what done run
away from New Caledoniah, an' protruberate hisself into my
position, an' take the bread out o' my mouf. Hu! his goose cooked
now for suah!&quot;</p>
<p>The mate swore wrathfully as he listened, for he knew that the
Mary's rara avis was a lost bird. No more delicious and tempting
&quot;feeds&quot; now! Why, even the one whose aroma he had just
been inhaling with such satisfaction, as it came wafted from the
galley, would be probably spoiled and ruined! Meanwhile, Alexandre,
grasping the situation, had seized a long knife and rushed towards
Naaman. But the officers were too smart for him, and the next
minute he was lying on the deck handcuffed and helpless.</p>
<p>Then, after the mate, with a very bad grace, had shown them the
entry in the official log relating to the picking up of the escaped
one, the pair bundled their prisoner into a cab, and drove away.
But not before the cook had shaken his manacled fists at Naaman,
and spat at him, and shouted, &quot;Ah, cochon noir! We meet
ourselves encore. Et alore, I keel you, keel you! Sacre nom, I cut
you on de troat all same ze peeg!&quot; And Naaman grinned
uncomfortably as he met the fierce, vengeful glare in the eyes of
the man he had betrayed. Moreover, that same night, at his
boarding-house, drink spurring his tongue, he began to boast of his
exploit. Whereupon some of the Mary's crowd happening to drop in,
and hearing, took hold of him and handled him after such a fashion
as left him naked and temporarily crippled. An achievement,
however, that next day cost them &quot;six weeks' hard&quot; in
Darlinghurst Gaol.</p>
<p>So the Mary lost both her cook and her crew. And shortly
afterwards the &quot;Evening News&quot; had a paragraph
reading:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, by the Tanais, a warder arrived from the French
convict settlement at Noumea, New Caledonia, and promptly
recognised an escapee named Alexandre Deschamps, alias Jules
Leroux, lately picked up at sea by the Island trader Mary, and
brought to this port. Deschamps, it appeared, had escaped from the
work-shops at Central Camp, on Ile Nou, and put to sea in a crazy
craft, belonging to a libere, that had drifted over from the
mainland. On arrival, however, information was given by one of the
crew, and an arrest was at once made of the undesirable addition to
our population. We gather that Deschampes crime was a peculiarly
aggravated case of forgery; his sentence, life. Prisoner and
warder, extradition forms having been satisfactorily fulfilled,
return to-morrow by the Ville de la Ciotat.&quot;</p>
<p>On his arrival the authorities sent Alexandre to work in the
nickel mines at Tchio. There, after a while, he purposely broke his
leg with a pick-handle, and was sent to the hospital, the acme of
every prisoner's ambition, at La Nouvelle. He could, on payment of
a certain sum, have had his eyes put out by an expert&mdash;a
fellow prisoner, who thrived on the business&mdash;and so been
saved all future bother as to &quot;travaux forces,&quot; or hard
labour. And, in despair, he would have done so, only that he was a
pauper, and in these transactions credit was an unknown quantity.
The breakage cost him nothing except a permanent limp. After some
terrible years, during which he grew grey and wizened, yet never
for one instant forgot Naaman and the debt he owed him, and yearned
to some day discharge, he was awarded the blue ribbon of La
Nouvelle, and remanded to the North Farm at Non, where the pets of
the System grow maize and try to breed cattle. And then he escaped
again. Stole one of the meat boats that bring the fresh meat from
the main island, and, before dawn, was clear of New Caledonia, and
steering into the heart of Micronesia. He had had enough of
Australia, and would rather trust himself to the tender mercies of
a cannibal than to these of a colonial constable.</p>
<p>But, on this occasion, luck favoured Alexandre; and, half way to
the Fijis, a rusty old tramp, flying the Hawaiian flag, and bound
with coal from Bulli to San Francisco, picked him up. Nor did the
Norwegian skipper ask any questions; but he hoisted the
boat&mdash;a good and nearly new one&mdash;inboard; and the next
day set Alexandre to give it a fresh coat of paint. The ex-prisoner
had long ago amused himself by scraping off the name of the colony
and the insignia of the French Republic from bows and stern.</p>
<p>From 'Frisco he shipped as cook on a big three-masted
fore-and-aft Yankee schooner, which was to load timber at Vancouver
for Rio Janeiro. Heavy weather and the loss of a couple of
top-masts off the Horn, however, compelled the John H. Barrett to
put into Monte Video. And there three of the crew, tired of
American sea-faring humour, as defined by belaying pins and
knuckle-dusters, deserted.</p>
<p>Alexandre, however, was as much a persona grata as he had been
years ago on the Mary. Like the rest of humankind, the rowdiest
&quot;bucko&quot; Yankee officer that ever booted a Dago has a
stomach to be tickled.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/settled02.jpg"
width="309" height="475"></p>
<p>Alexandre (&quot;Frenchy&quot; was his nickname now) sat on the
top of the dockland at midnight, and smoked his pipe, and sniffed
the harbour smells longingly, and wished he could get ashore,
knowing that he might just as well wish for the South American moon
that was looking so calmly down on the John H. Barrett as she lay
at anchor, once more ready for sea, with steam up in the donkey
engine, and only waiting for her two new hands. All at once there
was a hail, a boat grated alongside, and drunken voices were heard
abusing the boarding-house runners. Then, with many oaths, two men
scrambled up the great stack of timber that reached to the
shear-poles of the rigging. One man fell, his head hitting the
planks with a resounding thwack.</p>
<p>&quot;Vat you vos do, you blurry black nigger! You vant to zink
de schip, eh?&quot; asked his companion, lurching unsteadily to and
fro.</p>
<p>&quot;Hu!&quot; replied an angry voice, that made Alexandre drop
his pipe. &quot;Yo' call I niggah I mash yo'! I
gen'elman&mdash;supe-iau gen'elman&mdash;sallah from B'bados. By
Gawd! sah, I giv yo' hell, s'pose I cotch yo', yo' stinkin'
Dutchman!&quot; And picking himself up, the speaker staggered
towards the other. But the mate just then coming from aft, knocked
both men down, and kicked them impartially and vigorously with his
heavy sea-boots in welcome to the John H. Barrett. Then, after a
while, the engine in its house f'or'ard puffed and spouted white
steam into the moonlight as it ground the chain cable in. The
schooner spread her great wings of snowy cotton, and presently
glided out of the harbour, bulking high as a haystack, and casting
huge dark shadows across the shining water.</p>
<p>It was dark in the galley when, towards morning, a black head
appeared at the door, and a black arm held out a pannikin for the
&quot;gravy eye&quot; coffee. But Alexandre could see, although the
other could not, and he noted that his enemy had run to fat, and
was now pot-bellied; also his wool was decked with grey patches,
and his broad nose seemed flatter than ever.</p>
<p>But, in spite of all, there was no mistaking Naaman; and
Alexandre's heart grew hot, and his eye glittered in the dim galley
as he glared thirstily at the man who had sent him back to
hell.</p>
<p>&quot;Hu!&quot; grunted Naaman, peering, &quot;I guess, I
turnin' blue a ready where dat flas' mate kick I lawst night.&quot;
As he spoke the schooner pitched, the weather door of the galley
flew open, and the rising sun poured in, flooding everything with
light. Naaman started as he met the vengeful eyes so steadily fixed
on his own. &quot;Hi-yah!&quot; he exclaimed, suddenly, in scared
recognition, letting his pannikin drop on the deck. &quot;Dat yo',
Johnny? Well, I 'clar ter Gahd dis de curousest coensodence I ebber
seen!&quot; Then, taking courage from the other's silence, he said,
in bullying tones, &quot;Come 'long, now, fill dat cawfee up agin
as yo' made me capsize. Look s'arp&mdash;.&quot; But here Alexandre
emptied a ladle full of the scalding fluid on Naaman's naked arm,
and with a shriek of rage, echoed by one of pain from the negro, he
flew at the other's throat, and the pair rolled biting, and
scratching, and clawing into the lee scuppers.</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be blood lettin' over this, Silas Gunn,&quot;
remarked the skipper aside to his mate, after he had listened in
silence to Alexandre's furious denunciations, and had managed to
disentangle the story and straighten it out. &quot;Best let 'em
fight and have done with it. Ye see there's no doubt the nigger
served Frenchy a darned nasty trick, an' Frenchy'll never rest till
he's got square with him somehow. Let 'em fight anyways they
choose, only mind, I won't have Frenchy pegged-out, or even hurt
bad. He's a cook, he is, as can't be spared. When you fancy he's
gettin' beat, you take a hand, an' down the nigger&mdash;kill him,
if you like. But there's no fear o' Frenchy, I kin see business in
his eye every time. An' there's no sand in any blasted nigger that
I ever had to do with.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus it happened that, after breakfast, the Frenchman and the
negro confronted each other on the even floor of pine planks, each
with the same brand of sheath-knife in his hand. Naaman had
proposed sticks. But Alexandre had laughed him to scorn. And as the
aggrieved party, and the one carrying the whole sympathy of the
ship, the Frenchman had been allowed to choose the weapons, and had
at once declared for knives. One doesn't condone five years of La
Nouvelle Caledonie with broom-handles!</p>
<p>The wind was right aft, the sails set &quot;wing and wing,&quot;
and the schooner, on a level keel, as steady as a church. Sitting
around on coigns of vantage were the crew, all stolid Scandinavians
with the exception of a couple of Irish-Americans who acted as
seconds. Near by stood the mate, with one hand in the pocket of his
pea-jacket grasping a slung shot, ready for Naaman's thick head, if
necessary. The skipper walked to and fro the poop-house, and the
second mate sat smoking on the for'ard one; the man at the wheel
chewed on his quid, and stared upwards, screwing his head to get
out of line with the mizzen mast, which somewhat obstructed his
view. The blue water streamed merrily by in delicate foam-laced
patterns. Out of a blue sky the sun shone down with pleasant
warmth; on each quarter swum a big shark.</p>
<p>Both men had stripped to the waist, Alexandre showing prominent
ribs and hollow chest: Naaman rolls of fat that overflowed his
belt; upon his scalded left arm was a great patch of white where he
had dusted flour over it. The Frenchman, in spite of his limp,
danced and skipped, and jumped, and sung for very joy of his near
revenge; the black crouched scowling, sullen, with a greyish tinge
on his flabby cheeks.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/settled04.jpg"
width="550" height="369"></p>
<p>&quot;Buck up!&quot; cried the seconds, and the men rushed at
each other. The uplifted knives flashed and descended as all over
the deck-load the pair tramped, thrusting and cutting viciously,
whilst here and there the yellow Oregon pine grew scarlet
patches.</p>
<p>&quot;Time!&quot; and as the panting fighters returned to their
chalk marks, it could be seen that Naaman was bleeding freely from
ugly gashes on chest and arms, whilst Alexandre, save for a cut
across the shoulder, seemed untouched.</p>
<p>&quot;Another go?&quot; asked the seconds of the mate &quot;Ay!
ay,&quot; replied he, &quot;they've neither of 'em had enough to
cool their courage, eh, Frenchy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By gar, non!&quot; screamed Alexandre, flourishing his
arms, &quot;Von, doux, tree more time an' I keel 'eem, de black
cochon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Full o' grit,&quot; commented the mate, admiringly.
&quot;But mind the nigger, I expec' he's gettin' savage, too. And
you know we'll want our dinners all the same. So be keerful. I
guess this round'll have to do&mdash;heads or tails. Buck
up?&quot;</p>
<p>But Naaman's bolt was sped, his courage gone; and without
waiting to receive the eager Frenchman's rush, he deftly flung his
knife at him. It missed the other's neck by half an inch and
whizzed into the for'ard house, and stuck there quivering, with its
blade buried in the soft timber, whilst Naaman, leaping into the
main rigging, clambered aloft, dripping blood as the ratlines
sagged under his heavy tread. Gripping his knife between his teeth,
Alexandre sprang after him. Ninety feet to the topmast crosstrees
and Alexandre at his heels!</p>
<p>But the negro got there first and dragged himself up, meaning,
perhaps, to descend on the other side. The cook, however, was too
quick for him, and was there before he could get clear. Then they
grappled, squatting on the two thin outriggers, hardly the
thickness of a man's wrist. Suddenly the onlookers saw a flash of
light rise and fall, then arose a scream of mortal agony; a pair of
black arms appeared wound round a white waist; then head over heels
down the rigging rebounded the locked bodies, and fell with a great
splash into the sea, whilst the helmsman, fascinated by the
dreadful spectacle, let the vessel come up into the wind, and the
long, heavy booms swung madly over as she jibed to the thunder of
her huge cloths, and the whole fabric shook and trembled as if a
torpedo had exploded underneath it.</p>

<p>&quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; roared a man, all at once pointing
to where, close to them on the quarter, could be seen a skirling
mass of red-tinged foam from amidst which rose the ominous black
fins of sharks darting furiously hither and thither.</p>
<p>There was a long silence as they stared hopelessly. Then,
exclaimed the captain, choking a little as he spoke, &quot;By
thunder, settled outer court after all! But Silas Gunn, you've lost
me the best cook as ever browned a doughnut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An' I'm a hand short in my watch,&quot; replied the mate
sourly, as he proceeded to &quot;deal it out&quot; to the
&quot;Dutchman&quot; at the wheel.</p>

<p>A sixteen-foot, centre-board, open boat, built of the best
picked cedar, copper-fastened throughout, lined inside with cork
bolsters, in case of a capsize, such was &quot;The Brothers.&quot;
She carried a mainsail, set with a gaff, and a foresail. This for
ordinary weather. But when her owners felt like &quot;putting on
frills&quot; they set a topsail, a square-sail, and any other sail
that their inventive genius could find room for in the somewhat
limited space at their command. And the little craft, bright with
varnish, and resplendent with a narrow gold band around her, was
the pride and joy of their hearts. The owners, the brothers, were
four in number&mdash;Hal, the eldest, George, Frank, and Tom, in
ages ranging from 18 to 11. Incessant practice in and familiarity
with all the tricky ways and fashions of &quot;The Brothers&quot;
had made her so familiar to them in her every mood that they had at
length come to regard her as an almost sentient being, reciprocal
to their behests; amenable to their every wish. In her they had
explored every nook and corner of the beautiful harbour of Port
Endeavour. Winter and summer were alike to them; southerly
&quot;busters&quot; or cold and marrow freezing westerlies; fair
winds or foul, storm or calm, mattered little to the four boys.
Beating home in the teeth of a &quot;dead muzzler&quot; under
storm-sails, spray and spindrift rattling on their
&quot;oilies,&quot; or running free in the pleasant sunshine with
flapping jib and dipping main-sheet, at all seasons, and at all
hours, &quot;The Brothers&quot; and her owners were to be met with
both in the upper bays and coves, as well as in the bolder waters
of the great fairway that rose and swelled to the waters of the
wide Pacific. Every bluff and head land and sheltered combe, too,
along the many miles of foreshores the lads knew, where landing,
they would boil their billy, make tea and grill chops or steaks for
the midday meal; or during the long Christmas holidays pitch a
tent, build a fireplace of stones, and form a standing camp, to
return to after a day spent on the water. Not a steamer or a sailer
that entered Port Endeavour that they were not, if coasters,
familiar with her name and history; if a stranger that they did not
very soon discover all that was to be known of her; her tonnage,
the length of passage, her cargo, mishaps (if any). At times, too,
they met and fought Homeric battles on the water with other boats
manned by larrikins, who, jealous of the speedy Brothers, taunted
her crew as aristocrats, and assailed them with road metal and
shingle laid in of set purpose. Explorers, too, were these young
folk, taking much joy in perilous climbings along sheer cliffs; in
travel through the thick and unfrequented scrub that in spots grew
down to the water's edge. Caves were a specialty with them, and a
new one was among their most cherished discoveries for winter use;
and in these they stored vast deposits of
firewood&mdash;honeysuckle, and oak and gum&mdash;against the
bleak, sunless days of winter, and the cold, biting westerlies.
Then, turning Troglodytes, they lit great fires, and cooked, and
ate, and slept, sheltered and warm, what time &quot;The
Brothers&quot; rocked at her anchor, a hundred feet below, outside
the sullen wash of the seas that rolled in to the feet of the
sandstone cliffs.</p>
<p>An ideal life for boys; and small wonder that they throve and
grew strong and lithe and hardy, and indifferent to any kind of
weather.</p>
<p>Sometimes, but rarely, they ventured through the portals of the
harbour, those great pillars that form its giant gateway, and
looked back on the long and broken coastline of their native land,
precipitous, frowning; in places bare and forbidding; in others
glowing with the russet and green and purple of lichen, moss,
blossom, and grass, while ever &quot;the long wash of Australasian
seas&quot; curled in snowy whiteness at its base.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day in the now waning Autumn, and &quot;The
Brothers,&quot; close hauled to a brisk north-easter, had passed
the &quot;Cat and Kittens&quot; Lightship and opened up the broad
ocean beyond the Heads. Away almost on the horizon gleamed
pearl-like in the bright sunshine the sails of some inward-bound
ship, towards which a smart tug was swiftly steaming, while the
pilot vessel had slipped her moorings, and was making out in the
same direction.</p>
<p>&quot;How about a trip outside, boys?&quot; said Frank, the
third brother, a bright-faced, brown-eyed, sturdy lad of 14.
&quot;We can have a look at the ship, and then run back before
dark.&quot;</p>
<p>The proposition was carried unanimously, and the boat headed for
the entrance across the mild roll from the outside ocean. Past the
grim cliffs and the lighthouses, and the forts sped the weatherly
little craft, out into the wide Pacific, with for objective the
distant ship now hove-to and waiting for tug and pilot.</p>
<p>It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon when the weather
suddenly changed. The wind freshened considerably, and came round
to south, bringing up with it a lot of thick stuff that at times
seemed almost to blot out both land and water. A nasty beam sea,
too, got up, and more than once, spite of Hal's skilful steering,
the little ship took a &quot;big drink&quot; that kept them busy
with the baler. There was no doubt that &quot;The Brothers&quot;
was carrying too much canvas for comfort, even for safety. Nor was
there any shelter to be had, except by a long run to the northward.
The boys shortened sail, and then went about, in an endeavour to
make for home. But the wind had now increased to half a gale, and
&quot;The Brothers&quot; made such bad weather that there seemed no
alternative but to run for it. The sun was low by this time;
darkness would not be long in coming: they were five or six miles
out, and they all saw the impossibility of attempting to get inside
again for many hours. So they 'bouted ship once more, and ran
before the wind with a big following sea after them, throwing as
they went somewhat disconsolate glances to where they could dimly
discern, through the smother to windward, the outlines of three
tall spars, naked new, and a plume of smoke as the tug took hold
and valiantly strove to bring the ship into her haven.</p>
<p>It was the tightest corner the lads had ever been in. But they
took it well; although the youngest sniffed a little as the night
settled down, and, wet and cold, began to do their work. Astern
they could see the beams of the great electric light, on the
southern headland of their home, flung across the black waters, as
their boat rose and sank between the roaring combers, one of which
would now and again inquisitively peer over the low stern, and send
showers of foam into their frail craft; grown frailer and smaller
now than in all their previous experience of her. Hal, still
steering, encouraged his brothers with the certainty of reaching
Encounter Bay by daylight; and thence a telegram would assure their
parents of their welfare. The boys were wet to the skin, and
chilled to the marrow, hungry into the bargain; but they sang
cheerily enough as, baling with might and main, they swept past the
stern, grim cliffs, distant about a mile, from whose foot came to
their ears the deep, hoarse menace of the breaking surf.</p>
<p>But the brave singing ceased, as near midnight they realised
that the wind was hauling round to the westward, early in the
season though it was, and that there could be no sheltered
Encounter Bay for them, or indeed, shelter anywhere at all. It
seemed as they were forced almost at right angles to their course,
to blow harder than ever; and at last their hearts almost failed
them, as they realised that they were being driven out to sea in a
little open boat, with water and provisions for but a few meals.
They knew their danger, none better. Nevertheless, they tried to
comfort each other as best they might.</p>
<p>'&quot;Father'll be out in the morning, and pick us up all
right,&quot; said George, a quiet, thoughtful lad, as he took his
little brother in his arms, and strove to keep him warm, while the
others crouched together in the bottom of the boat, in their sodden
oilskins, and stared at the last lessening ray from the great
lighthouse, as it shone at regular intervals across the foam-tipped
waste of waters. Hal, unwilling to trust the tiller to weaker
hands, still stuck to his post, and &quot;The Brothers,&quot; with
the wind now almost dead aft, kept valiantly ahead of the big
following seas that threatened each moment to overwhelm and sink
her. Indeed, she now shipped so much water that almost incessant
baling was requisite to keep her from filling.</p>
<p>At last the morning broke, broke on a vast expanse of
foam-tipped grayness, hidden by a grey sky in which was no rift.
There was nothing whatever in sight, not even the land. The wind
and sea, however, had both moderated, and the forlorn lads at once
got their little ship on a wind, and steered for where they thought
Australia must surely be. In their basket there remained from the
provisions of the day before, some sodden bread, a bottle of jam,
part of a round of corned beef, some butter and a tin of preserved
milk. And upon these bedraggled remnants they fell with all the
healthy fury engendered by an eighteen hours' fast. Not until the
last salty morsel had vanished did Hal realize with consternation
that he ought to have dealt the food out sparingly, and husbanded
it to the utmost. It was, he remembered, always managed so in the
story books.</p>
<p>The sky was still overcast and gloomy, rendering it almost
impossible for them to steer a course with any certainty. And as
Frank, who had relieved Hal after his long spoil at the tiller, put
it: &quot;I say, boys, it's about even chances, so far as I can
see, that we'll miss hitting our country altogether. There's more
southing coming into the wind now; freshening up, too! And we must
lie a jolly long way off the land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hal. &quot;I know we ran like the very
mischief through the best part of the night. Now, against this wind
and sea we're making scarcely any headway at all. Well, chaps, I'd
sooner be back at school with a dozen lost Saturdays; but let's
keep our upper lips stiff, I daresay we'll come out on top
yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And, anyhow,&quot; remarked George, bravely seconding his
brother's effort at cheerfulness, &quot;we'll have something to
talk about when we do get home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could eat ten grilled chops,&quot; suddenly exclaimed
the lad at the tiller, with solemn and hungry emphasis,
&quot;washed down with two quarts of hot tea!&quot;</p>
<p>At that Hal and George laughed ruefully. As for poor little Tom,
he was fast asleep on a heap of oilskins, all his troubles
forgotten for the moment. &quot;Isn't that a sail?&quot; exclaimed
George, all at once, pointing away on the starboard quarter. And
there, sure enough, showed up a glint of white again the gloom,
right on the rim of the horizon. For some time the boys watched,
silently, longingly. Then Frank said, with something of a choke in
his throat, for strong as a boy's courage may be, it, like a man's,
has its limit; &quot;Yes, but she's passing us. I think she must be
coming up from the south. We might cut across, and catch her,
Hal.&quot;</p>
<p>Without replying, Hal went forward, and stood with one arm round
the mast, and took a long look. Nothing met his gaze but the grey
sea, and the dull, grey sky, broken only by that flickering patch
of canvas. But the boy had made up his mind: &quot;We can't be much
worse off,&quot; said he, &quot;and, perhaps, we have a chance to
at least get within signalling distance before she passes. She's
about lying her course, I think, for her yards don't seem braced
sharp up. Round we go, boys; at any rate, we'll have a run for our
money. And where there's one ship there's likely to be
more.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/brothers01.jpg"
width="429" height="475"></p>
<p>So now &quot;The Brothers,&quot; with wind and sea on her
quarter, made an oblique course to that of the ship, steering ahead
of her, and with perhaps half a dozen miles to the good in favour
of her reaching the spot in time to be heard or seen.</p>
<p>The next two or three hours were a period of alternating hope
and suspense. And the young eyes grew dim and aching as they stared
out of the haggard young faces; and the hushed tones discussed the
chance of success or failure. For it must be well understood that
they thoroughly realized what failure meant for them.</p>
<p>And that, it would be a failure was presently only too apparent.
Despite their utmost endeavours, the ship was too fast for them.
She would cross ahead of their course, at a distance of a good mile
and a-half. And two miles in dull weather; and with night not far
away! For a minute, as they gazed with salt-sore, weary eyes at the
big four-master passing them majestically, unseeing, unheeding, the
three boys felt the cold breath of a lingering and dreadful death
strike them to their souls. It was a bitter, moment&mdash;a moment
to dream of in long after days, and to awake to the unreality of in
a cold and shivering sweat. And Tom was awake, cold and hungry, and
moaning for home and his mother.</p>
<p>But the youthful native-born are, on an average, built of sturdy
stuff&mdash;stuff that, like its forbears, never knows when it is
beaten. And Hal, giving short sharp orders, the other rushed to the
sprit, unshipped it, and, working like furies, lashed it to the
mast in such wise that it showed fully 10ft above that spar, while
from its top the flag of the Royal Port Endeavour Yacht Club, of
which their father is a member, blew out, Union down. And now
ensued a period of dreadful suspense. They felt themselves too
infinitesimally small, the merest speck amid the waste of waters
and the gloomy weather. The ship seemed so distant; the chances
against her seeing them too many. &quot;She's passing!&quot;
exclaimed Hall at length, with a groan. &quot;We're done,
boys!&quot; and he sank down in the stern, and for the first time
in all their troubles seemed about to lose heart. Slowly the vessel
drew ahead past the intercepting point. The other two boys had
apparently given up all hope, and now sat with their heads on their
knees. Frank, however, still stuck to the tiller, and kept his eyes
on the receding shape of their only salvation. Presently he stood
up, and shouted, &quot;Hal, Hal, I do believe she's seen us!
Hooray, lads!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbish!&quot; replied Hal, nevertheless jumping to his
feet, and staring hard at the ship, which now, without a doubt, had
braced sharp up on the starboard tack, and was heading on a course
that must bring her within a few hundred yards of &quot;The
Brothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By jingo, Frank, old chap, I believe you're right!&quot;
exclaimed Hal. &quot;Keep away, right away. Stir yourself, Tom,
you're the lightest, and shin up the topmast. That'll make
something else for 'em to look at. It strikes me we have a show
yet.&quot;</p>
<p>And they had. In half an hour, or so, they were alongside a
great four-masted barque, their boat towing astern; and between
mouthfuls of hot soup and biscuit were telling their story to the
captain and officers of the Andromeda, of London; last from
Melbourne, in ballast, to load nickel ore at Tchio, in New
Caledonia.</p>
<p>&quot;No, my boys, I can't go back to Port Endeavour,&quot; said
the skipper, one of the best types of his kind. &quot;It's a good
70 miles E.N.E. from here, and the passage is taking too much time
as it is. But the chances are we'll sight something by-and-bye,
bound the way you want to go. Now, just make yourselves at home on
the Andromeda. It was a warm squeak, though, only the second
officer happened to be having a look round through his glasses. But
for that you'd have had another night out, and&mdash;well, all's
well that ends well,&quot; he abruptly concluded.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Meanwhile a beautiful steam yacht, with on board her a
despairing father and mother and a host of relatives, was
quartering the Endeavour Harbour in every direction in search of
any remnant of &quot;The Brothers;&quot; in and out of every
secluded bay and inlet she went, while her boats hallowly searched
the rocks and beaches. Also a host of seekers ranged the
foreshores, stimulated by the great reward offered for any trace of
the missing boys. The signalmen at the South Head had noticed no
boat putting out to sea on the day the lads disappeared. Thus all
efforts were confined to the harbour itself and its hundreds of
miles of water frontage.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>In the meantime the Andromeda, meeting with a fair wind a few
hours after picking &quot;The Brothers&quot; up, had journeyed many
miles towards her destination. The boys, although grieving at the
distress they knew must prevail at home, had thriven on their
friendly ship. The good-natured skipper, too, had hove their boat
on board, and stowed her snugly amidships. Nothing, however, had
been sighted bound towards Australia. And the brothers thought that
they were, as Frank put it, &quot;booked for the whole trip,&quot;
when one morning a trail of smoke was seen on the horizon, which in
an hour or so resolved itself into a tug, with a ship in tow.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll speak her,&quot; said the skipper of the Andromeda.
&quot;That's a lame duck from somewhere, boys, going down your
way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, it's the Wanderer!&quot; exclaimed Hal, as the tug,
with a large Iron barque, her topgallant masts struck, drew near,
towing with a very long line. &quot;She belongs to the Port,
captain. They'll take us home all right. Hooray!&quot; and the four
boys raised a hearty cheer at the prospect, not of leaving the
Andromeda&mdash;for they were perfectly at home in every part of
her, both below and aloft; prime favourites, too, both fore and
aft&mdash;but of assuring their parents of their safety. They had
been absent over a week, and well they knew that hope must ere this
be nearly dead in the hearts of almost everybody at Endeavour.
Presently, in response to their signals, the tug slowed down, while
a boat put off from the Andromeda, with her chief officer and Hal,
to try and come to some arrangement. And when the master of the
Wanderer heard the story of the brothers, they found him thoroughly
willing, not only to carry them to Port Endeavour, but to take
their little boat into the bargain.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your dingey over the side,&quot; said he to Hal,&quot;
and we'll put her on the davits of the Glenore yonder (indicating
the barque, with a wave of his hand). We pulled her off a reef on
the north side of New Caledonia, patched her up, and are taking her
down to Endeavour to dock. We ought to be there in four days from
now. You and your brothers had better stay on board the Glenore.
More room there; plenty of tucker, too.&quot; So the boys presently
had &quot;The Brothers&quot; once more in the water, and, after a
grateful farewell to all hands on board the Andromeda, all of whom
they had come to look upon as old friends, they pulled off to their
new ship, followed by three hearty cheers from the four-master, as
she filled on her course again, and dipped her ensign in parting
salute.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1305211h-images/brothers03.jpg"
width="307" height="475"></p>
<p>The boys had been given up at last, and half a dozen families
were mourning their loss, when, one morning, just as business
people were making their way across the harbour in the crowded
ferry boats, a wild blowing of steam whistles and syrens from a few
of their number lower down the bay denoted something unusual to be
happening. Presently, the Wanderer hove in sight, coming up the
fairway, decked with bunting from stem to stern, while all round
her other tugs and the small steam fry of the port took up the
chorus, and made the shores echo again with wild screams of
rejoicing.</p>
<p>When directly opposite a large residence with a water frontage,
the Wanderer slackened speed, and drawing up as close as she could
she came to a full stop while her powerful siren blared forth
triumphant and joyous crowings, in front of the boys' once happy
home, now a house of grief and desolation.</p>
<p>&quot;By heavens,&quot; exclaimed a passenger, quick to divine
the meaning of the thing, &quot;the Wanderer's picked those lost
lads up!&quot; And as the watchers presently saw the flag that for
the last few days had flown half-mast from its staff in front of
the house, slowly rise to the summit, and stand out in flapping
folds, as if exultant in the morning breeze, bursts of cheering
arose from all the crowded boats as their occupants realised that
those mourned as dead were alive and well.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right to be at home again, you chaps!&quot; said
Hal, later on. &quot;My word,&quot; said Frank, &quot;only I
suppose we'll have to go to school again, just as if nothing had
happened.&quot; &quot;Not for a fortnight,&quot; said George.
&quot;Father says that fellows who've been through what we have,
must want a spell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That'll be bosker,&quot; chimed in little Tom, from the
encircling shelter of his mother's arms.</p>

DADD.</h1>

Blue Star,&quot; &quot;The Luck of the Native Born.&quot;)</h3>

Journal<br>
Wednesday, December 13, 1905</h3>
<p>The Dadds had been married twelve months, and lived very happily
together, until Mr. Dadd began to develop fads. He was a Civil
servant, a post-office employee, with a salary of &pound;250 per
annum. While staying at a farm near Goulburn, on the occasion of
his yearly holiday, he had met his wife&mdash;a hearty, jolly,
sensible, young countrywoman, who, when the smart clerk asked her
to share his fortunes with her, could hardly bring herself to
believe that he was in earnest. They lived now in a comfortable
cottage in one of the remoter marine suburbs of Sydney; and until
David commenced his course of fads his wife was accustomed to think
herself a very lucky woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Dadd, although scarcely thirty years of age, was a person
who took himself very seriously. Still, on the whole, he was what
his acquaintances called him&mdash;&quot;a very decent chap;&quot;
and one who, while not liable to astonish the world by any
outbursts of exceptional ability, could, it might be imagined, be
depended upon to abjure all experiments of the kind he presently
began to make a trial of. &quot;There's a nice bit of fillet for
dinner to-night, dear,&quot; remarked his wife, as David, having
got himself into his house clothes, came into the dining room.
&quot;I'm afraid you'll have to eat it yourself, then,
Georgie&quot; (Mrs. Dadd had been christened Georgina), replied her
husband. &quot;No more meat for me. I'm convinced that it's the
source of half the social mischief in this country. I've been
reading the subject up lately, and I find that vegetarianism is the
one thing needful for the betterment of both mind and body. Will
you see, dear, that there always are plenty of them on the
table,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But surely, Dave,&quot; asked Mrs. Dadd, in amazement,
&quot;not at every meal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied, her husband. &quot;I don't
expect to ever touch meat again, in any shape or form. Some more
peas and potatoes, please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a spoonful of gravy, then,&quot; implored his wife,
almost in tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Not even a suspicion,&quot; said David, as he heroically
munched his vegetables. &quot;And, presently, dear, when you see
how well the new diet agrees with me, I hope you will follow my
example.&quot;</p>
<p>But, somehow, as time passed, David, neither in health nor
temper, showed the expected advantage to be derived from the new
departure. His wife, being a sensible woman, made no remarks. On
the contrary, she tried to vary his diet as much as possible, and
learned to cook no less than a dozen different sorts of vegetables,
each in as many fashions. Even when Mr. Dadd allowed his hair to
grow longer than is usual with the majority of sane citizens, she
forbore to remonstrate. She, however, firmly resisted all David's
persuasion to join him in his obsession, and contented herself with
preparing appetising little dishes for herself, careless,
apparently, that, the savour of these reaching her husband&mdash;as
he sat forcing his appetite to a compote of carrots, a fraudulent
imitation of a mutton chop, constructed out of peas, cauliflowers,
and potatoes; or a beefsteak whose foundation consisted mainly of
turnips and tomatoes&mdash;seemed to make him unhappy, not to say
morose.</p>
<p>Always spare of body, David presently began to get so fine that
his friends nicknamed him &quot;Radish.&quot; Thereupon he added
apples and nuts to his dietary, consuming enormous quantities of
those fruits. But to no purpose. David was of all men one adapted
by Nature for a generous diet; and daily he grew visibly more
miserable, while the grateful fumes from Georgie's side of the
table at times tried his self-control almost beyond the limits of
endurance. And at last came the psychological moment, not entirely
unexpected by the wife. Before her was a dish of stewed tripe,
cooked as few women but herself could cook it. Aforetime David's
favourite dish, the appetising odour titillated his tortured
nostrils with a very frenzy of desire. All at once there sprang up
in his stomach an irresistible loathing towards the mess before
him; and, suddenly, in angry, almost savage, accents, he shouted,
&quot;For heaven's sake, Georgie, give a man something fit to
eat!&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>For a few months David, having cut his hair and abjured
vegetarianism, put on flesh, and leavened his somewhat didactic
temperament with a cheeriness born of good living, let well alone,
and essayed no new experiments or divagations.</p>
<p>Presently, however, he took to studying &quot;the effect of
clothing on the human frame in connection with climatic
environment;&quot; at least, that is how he put it to Georgie. It
was then about the middle of summer, and as a result of his
cogitations he took to &quot;white,&quot; and bore with equanimity
the salutes of the small boys who yelled &quot;Hokey-pokey!&quot;
after him, as well as with the notable increase in the laundry
bills.</p>
<p>&quot;There cannot be a doubt,&quot; remarked David, &quot;that
in a semi-tropical climate such as ours is drill or some equally
suitable material is the rational dress for men. The only wonder is
that the garb has not long ere now become universal. All through
this torrid weather I am enabled to keep my body cool and my brain
in good working order, while my colleagues at the office, in their
heavy tweeds, perspire and indulge in irritable
growlings.&quot;</p>
<p>Presently he left off wearing woollen underclothing and took to
cotton, having become thoroughly convinced that cotton was not only
lighter but warmer, to say nothing of the question of economy. To
all his wife's suggestions that colds and chills would probably be
the outcome of the business, David turned a deaf ear. The weather
continued fine and hot, and he marvelled that nobody else followed
his example. Then, one day, happening to be working overtime, he
was caught on his way home by a bitter &quot;southerly,&quot; and
chilled to the very marrow of his bones. A sharp attack of
pneumonia followed, which the doctor brutally told him served him
right, and when David was able to get about again&mdash;although
never tired of inveighing against &quot;the treachery of the
climate&quot;&mdash;he gave up &quot;rational dress&quot; once and
for all.</p>
<p>But to an inquiring mind like his inaction was impossible. And
one evening he arrived at his home carrying an electric battery
under his arm. He had been &quot;reading up&quot; certain medical
treatises recommending electricity as a cure for most human
ailments, and he now proceeded to fill himself up with what he
called the &quot;vital spark.&quot; He attempted to induce his wife
to join him in the experiment; but after the first shock, Mrs. Dadd
said she believed it did not agree with her, and she left him to
pursue his latest fad alone. He would sit for hours at a time
holding the handles of the machine, and declaring that he was being
gradually permeated with the current, and that it was making
&quot;a new man of him.&quot; His wife, however, could discover no
difference, and the eternal buzz became a decided nuisance.</p>
<p>Presently, however, he came across a book strongly recommending
all people, whether well or ill, to live us much as possible in the
open air. Doors and windows were to be kept open winter and summer,
night and day, and thorough ventilation encouraged in every
possible manner. The promised results were a practical immunity
from every description of disease. The scheme tickled David's fancy
mightily. But Georgie was strong in protest. &quot;It's like
offering a premium to burglars,&quot; she said. &quot;Besides, you
know how susceptible to colds you are, and living in draughts will
only mean another big doctor's bill.&quot; &quot;That's exactly the
reason, dear,&quot; replied David, eagerly. &quot;We ought to give
the thing a trial. Dr. Smith, the great scientist, says that a
course of such treatment, if persevered in, will so harden and
improve our constitutions as to render them practically
impenetrable to the attacks of hostile bacteria or bacilli. And, as
for burglars, the last house they would dream of entering would be
one thrown wide open. In such cases, they always suspect a
trap.&quot; By dint of much argument, David at last gained an
unwilling assent to the new venture. The result could scarcely be
called encouraging. Georgie was unable to sleep for fear of
thieves; her husband was never free from coughs and colds. It was
winter, and &quot;Burleigh Cottage,&quot; standing on rather high
ground, was simply enfiladed by the winds; the westerlies
especially holding high revel along the passages, and in the
rooms.</p>
<p>But David bore it all with the stoicism of a martyr. In spite of
colds in the head and colds in the throat, of sneezings and
hawkings and catarrhs, he declared that he felt himself perceptibly
benefited. They had of late employed a &quot;general;&quot; but the
fresh air supply was too plentiful for her, and she left, after
calling David a raging lunatic, and prophesying that some night
they would awake with their throats cut. So far as Mrs. Dadd was
concerned, the position was becoming intolerable, and her husband
seemed deaf to remonstrance or ridicule. She, therefore,
determined, by hook or by crook, to end this worst fad of all; and
presently she hit upon a scheme that she thought might answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Burleigh Cottage&quot; was in a very isolated position,
and at the back of the garden was a clump of rocks, among which, in
a sort of cave, lived an old Troglodyte, who now and again was
called in to &quot;do up&quot; the paths, and cut the grass on the
small lawn. The only name by which the Dadds knew the man was
&quot;Bill.&quot; And to &quot;Bill&quot; Mrs. Dadd applied for
help in her extremity.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, lydy, I unnerstan's,&quot; he replied, as Georgie
unfolded her plan, and a sly grin curled his thick lips as he
repeated her instructions: &quot;Everythin' o' the
bosses&mdash;hats, boots, socks, all his wearin' togs&mdash;an' a
few o' your dresses an' nickernacks. Yus, lydy, cert'nly. An' you
a-goin' to stay the night at a fren's 'ouse? An', then, I'm to
bring the swag to my camp, yonder, an' plant it. Then, bimeby, when
the hue an' cry's all hover I'm to bring 'em back agen an' say as
how I found 'em all stowed away in a cave where the burgellers hid
'em in, thinkin' as 'ow they was pursood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's quite correct, Bill,&quot; replied poor Georgie,
strong in her faith in the honesty of the Troglodyte, dirty of
person and unprepossessing of feature though he might be, and
little guessing that all the time he was hard put to it to keep
from sniggering at the transparent simplicity of her scheme to give
her husband a lesson; and to teach him for the future to keep a
closed house o' nights.</p>
<p>&quot;And you won't make a noise, Bill?&quot; continued
Georgie.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me, lydy,&quot; said Bill with a scornful sniff;
&quot;I've been too long at&mdash;I means as I'm that light-footed
a feller, you wouldn't believe. There ain't nothin' locked in the
crib, is there, lydy?&quot; he suddenly asked. &quot;No,&quot;
replied Georgie. &quot;But, of course, everything you'll want will
be in the wardrobe.&quot; &quot;In coorse, lydy, in coorse,&quot;
agreed Bill emphatically; &quot;you may tyke yer sollum davy as
nothin' else won't be touched.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>On the appointed night, as luck would have it, David, by way of
enlarging his experiment, had determined to sleep on the verandah.
The house, however; remained open as ever. Thus the Troglodyte's
task was an absurdly easy one; and when Georgie arrived in time to
get David's breakfast she found that her instructions had been
exceeded to a preposterous extent. David greeted her in his
sleeping suit; having been able to discover nothing else. That was
all right, so far. But when she discovered, in addition, that she
herself possessed only what clothes she carried on her back; that
her jewellery as well as George's was missing, together with any of
the wedding presents worth taking away, Mrs. Dadd simply collapsed,
and hysterically wept. Simple as she might have been in her
estimate of the Troglodyte's character, she was quick enough to
perceive that here was catastrophe and not pretence. David, who was
hoarse to voicelessness from his night's sojourn on the verandah,
gesticulated wildly, and made husky, grating sounds which were
unintelligible, but none the less smacked of &quot;language,&quot;
as known in police courts.</p>
<p>The nearest neighbour was a mile away; to the nearest police
station was three miles. Leaving poor Georgie to her own devices,
David set off to the neighbour's house. In the tramp through the
bush his slippers came off repeatedly; he cut his feet among the
rocks; he also stubbed his toes. When at last he arrived, with a
keen westerly playing all sorts of pranks among his pyjamas, two
women&mdash;the only people at home&mdash;slammed the door in his
face and shrieked at the top of their voices. In vain he waved his
hands, and pointed, and shook his head, and tried by gestures to
interpret his woes&mdash;there was a lunatic asylum not very far
away. And presently a shotgun, wavering, but otherwise fairly
direct, covered him from one of the windows. At this hint David
departed, looking more like a maniac than ever. Later on he
arrived, in a rainstorm, at a suburban railway station, and
appearing on the crowded platform, was quickly hustled into a
cloak-room, and there secured, pending the arrival of a constable.
Having to some extent recovered his voice, he, tried to explain and
expostulate. And in return the officials soothed him with promises;
said they quite believed in his sanity; were sure that he could
prove that he had not escaped from the asylum over yonder; was,
indeed, a responsible Civil servant; and that they were only
detaining him because he was wet, and might catch a dangerous cold
if allowed to go any further in such violent weather. They also
gave him a blanket and a cup of hot coffee. Presently the police
arrived, and haled poor protesting, shivering David off to the
local lockup, where eventually he was detained on a magistrate's
order for medical examination, and while inquiries were being made.
And the various newspapers came out with announcements to the
effect that an alleged escaped lunatic, calling himself the
Postmaster-General, had been apprehended. It was added that,
although exhibiting violent symptoms at first, the maniac appeared
to be on the whole of a mild description.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at &quot;Burleigh Cottage,&quot; Georgie had pulled
herself together a little, and was endeavouring to make a more
detailed inventory of their losses than had been possible in the
first rush of despair. She never doubted that David would presently
return with the police, to whom she had determined to make a clean
breast of the whole business. A letter that the afternoon post
brought, however, completely altered this resolution. It contained
news of a legacy, no great sum, certainly, but more than enough to
cover the value of all the Troglodyte's plunder a hundred times
over. Thus, when later on, David arrived in a cart escorted by two
constables, they heard only a curtailed story. But to
David&mdash;after imparting to him the tidings of good fortune
following fast on the heels of evil hap&mdash;to a limp,
bedraggled, disgrunted, and ashamed David&mdash;his wife made full
confession. And David, somewhat rehabilitated thereby in his own
esteem, but still suffering from successive shocks to both his
self-conceit and to his physical system, rose to the occasion with
all the magnanimity of the injured male, and said: &quot;There,
there, dear. Don't say a word more about the wretched business. I
freely forgive you for it all.&quot; But there have been no more
fads in the Dadds household since. And these matters were history
years ago.</p>

<p>&quot;She's a beauty, isn't she?&quot; asked Captain Watson of
his companion, Captain Kane. &quot;Just look at those bows and the
run of her sheering away, aft like a fish's belly!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; replied the other, as they stood in the
South-West India Dock alongside the clipper ship 'Amyomene.
&quot;She's all right. Still, you know, Watson,&quot; he continued,
his eye wandering to a big cargo steamer that lay next to the
sailer, &quot;where does canvas come in when steam's about? Now
here's your flash clipper with her dozens of sticks and her acres
of sailcloth. And here I am with the Balkan yonder, and a set of
engines and a propeller. London to Melbourne, Port Endeavor,
Waratah, anywhere, in forty odd days; whilst you've got to take
your chance&mdash;may be eighty or ninety, or one hundred and
ninety, or by gum, one thousand and ninety, for all you can tell!
No; I won't deny you're prettier. But, good Lord, it takes a lot o'
beauty to make up for such passages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell you what, Kane,&quot; exclaimed the other
impetuously. &quot;If I could only be sure of getting through the
Doldrums, and with fair luck afterwards, I'd beat you out to
Australia.&quot;</p>
<p>The Balkan's skipper smiled indulgently, which his friend (for
they were very old friends) noticing, became rather warm. &quot;And
why not?&quot; he asked. &quot;What can that old tank of yours do
at her top? Eleven! And, I've seen the Amy there do her sixteen,
over and over again, running her easting down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, aye, Mark,&quot; replied the other quietly. &quot;but
then, you see, the 'old tank's' doing her eleven, eleven night and
day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Watson, after a pause, &quot;that's
true.&quot; And then, moved by some sudden impulse, he continued.
&quot;But in spite of it, I'll bet you &pound;50 that I'll beat you
this trip from here to Port Endeavor; we're both bound the same
road, and starting the same day. You'll of course, give me the odds
of your call at the Cane. Come, now, what d'ye say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only that I won't rob you, old chap,&quot; replied Kane,
after a long stare of astonishment. &quot;But,&quot; he added,
laughing, &quot;if you're so dead bent on a bet, I'll tell you what
I'll do. If you get there first I'll make you a present of a new
sextant I've just invested in. If I sight the Heads first, you'll
give me the best hat to be bought in the port. I know,&quot; he
concluded diplomatically, &quot;the Amy's one of the fastest
clippers out of London; but to back sail against steam's not fair
to her nor to you. Still, just for the fun of the thing I don't
mind. Now come on board and try a drop of that special Scotch I got
down from Glasgow the other day.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark Watson was a grizzled, red-cheeked old seaman of 60, and he
bore the now empty title of &quot;Commodore&quot; of the once
famous Red Lion Line, of which the Amyomene was the very last
survival, all the rest having been &quot;sold foreign,&quot; owing
to their late owners having gone in for steam. And, although he was
not aware of the fact, it was the old clipper's last trip before,
in her turn, falling to Norwegian or German buyers.</p>
<p>The partners, Bayliss and Gower, of the great, almost
historical, shipping firm, had refrained from letting the old
skipper know, because, as the senior put it, &quot;It's bound to
cut him up a bit; he thinks more of her than many men do of their
wives. So better let him have his last trip in peace.&quot; They
were considerate and liberal people, these, and had long settled on
a good sum for the retiring pension of the old sea captain who had
served them so faithfully, boy and man, for nearly forty years.</p>
<p>So highly, indeed, did they think of him, that when Agatha
Bayliss, who was going to Cooksland to join her betrothed, young
Captain St. John, of the Grenadier Guards, but at present
aide-de-camp to H.E. the Governor of that colony, suddenly made up
her mind to travel in the Amyomene, instead of by the mail boat,
her father assented at once. Old Mark Watson had carried her about
the ship many a time when not as high as his knee. Now she had
grown taller than he, a beautiful girl with hair the color of ripe
maize, and eyes as blue as the sea she loved so well.</p>
<p>Captain Mark was intensely pleased when he heard the news; and,
suddenly remembering his bet, rubbed his hands, and in confidence
told &quot;Miss Aggie&quot; all about it, and swore that she would
bring him and the ship luck. And she, entering into the spirit of
the thing, yet scarcely esteeming it possible, laughed and said,
&quot;You know I'm to be married almost at once, Captain Mark, when
we arrive. Well, I promise, if we win the race, that you shall give
me away. The Governor was to have done it. But you shall take his
place. And I'll be your mascotte, and the dear old ship shall put
her best foot forward this trip if ever she did. But don't say
anything about it to father, Captain Mark. He might
object.&quot;</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards as they lay at the buoy, off Gravesend,
taking in some explosives for the new six-inch guns at Port
Endeavor, the Balkan came slowly down the river.</p>
<p>And then as the 5000 tons of her solemnly slid
past&mdash;showing tall, black, wall-sides with patches of red
about her forefoot, her huge, rod topped funnel, raking aft in line
with the two slim pole-masts, and her lofty bridge glistening with
polished brasswork&mdash;Capt. Kane took off his cap to Agatha,
standing with her father on the poop of the Amyomene, and the
quartermaster at the ensign-staff lowered the flag three times in
salute to the clipper, returned from the latter's gaff in like
manner by Captain Mark himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Good man, Kane,&quot; remarked old Bayliss. &quot;I'm
sorry after all. Aggie, you're not going out in the Balkan, as you
object to mail steamers. He's got fine accommodation for a few in
the salon. And he'll be at Endeavour, very likely, weeks in front
of you. Stupid business, this whim of yours. It never struck me so
strongly until I saw Kane slipping past us for the same
port.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, dad, replied his daughter, laughing.
&quot;Captain Mark and I are going to send the old Amy this trip.
She shall make a record, and bring glory on the last of the Red
Lions. Perhaps, even, we'll be in before the Balkan, big a start as
she is getting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tut, tut,&quot; said the old gentleman, testily;
&quot;don't talk nonsense. And don't you be edging Mark to put his
spars or his ship, in danger. This isn't yachting, in the Solent,
remember, with a lot of boats to pick you up if you
capsize.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was only joking dear.&quot; replied Agatha, putting her
arm in his; &quot;and now come below and have a look at my
rooms&mdash;not the cupboards they give you, even on the best of
steamers&mdash;four beautiful big ones between myself and Mary
Macintosh. Plenty of space, dad, the whole ship to ourselves, and
no horrid people to bother with at table or on deck. Remember our
trip to the Cape, dad, and how you felt like a chicken in a coop
with servants crying out all day, &quot;Chook, chook, come and be
fed.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Downs, next morning, with a beautiful north-easterly
blowing, Mr. Bayliss left them. And before this wind the Amyomene,
setting every stitch of canvas from royals down, drove gallantly
along, a most beautiful object as she surged through the short,
choppy seas, with yards nearly square, her smooth, bright green
sides, with their gilt band gleaming wet to the wash of the dull,
green water, whilst the great white figure head pointed with
outstretched arm ever forward. Presently the wind hauled more to
the northward, blowing stronger; and checking her yards and
boarding her, tacks, and hauling her sheets aft, the outward
bounder lay over to it with a sudden snowy, curling of foam around
her shapely bows showing her wide white spaces of deck, broken only
by the galley and a couple of long houses of polished hardwood, out
of which twinkled brass-rimmed eyes of glass; showing too, the
whole width of her grand poop&mdash;the longest of any ship's
afloat&mdash;all a-glow in the frosty sunshine, with the sparkle of
it leaning like points of flame from binnacle and wheel and
skylight, as the last of the famous ocean flyers of the sixties set
forth on her last voyage under the Red Lion.</p>
<p>Aloft the sails sat like huge white shells stacked high by some
cunning hand in fitting size and progression, each above each
straining immovable from their milk-white yards, whilst the brisk
wind sung in their hollows, and amongst the rigging a shrill song
of farewell to the good old ship they had known so long.</p>
<p>&quot;Such luck!!&quot; said the pilot, as he and Captain Mark
stood to windward of the wheel and watched her. &quot;Three solid
weeks of westerly; and now, when you start, why, it shifts at once.
Got a horseshoe aboard, captain; or what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something better than that,&quot; replied old Mark, as he
nodded towards where Agatha and her maid sat together on the
skylight, &quot;One of the sweetest and best girls in the world.
Bayliss' only one. I'm taking her out to get married. And I'm in a
hurry this trip, Brown. What can I do it in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Steamer time if the old beauty keeps on like this,&quot;
replied the other with a grin. &quot;Still you know, you'll have a
job to beat your record. Sixty-five, wasn't it? Ay, ay, I remember,
we took two days to the start that passage. Now if this breeze
holds we'll be there in 18 hours. A good beginning, Cap'en! By
Jiminy, if the old girl got the wind I believe she'd beat most
things afloat, dashed if I don't!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay.&quot; sighed Captain Mark, thinking of the Balkan,
then probably off Ushant, &quot;the wind it is that makes the
passage, although the men and the ship get all the credit for
it.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Every fifth year there is a certain day upon which the
South-east Trade, coming&mdash;much to their indignation, for they
hate to be disturbed&mdash;right across the Doldrums, meets his
brother of the North-east and has a long reminiscent talk with him.
Sometimes this happens as far as 4deg north, but, more generally,
right on the Equator. And thrice fortunate the ship that happens to
strike that particular day and get handed on without delay by one
trade to the other, and carried across that calm and windless belt
so dreaded of mariners. Of such lucky ones were the vessels who
made the wonderful passages to Australia of which we read in the
fifties, sixties, and early seventies.</p>
<p>On one of these so rare days the Trades had met, and were having
a long yarn, mainly about old times and old ships; the terrible
falling-off in sailers, and the degeneracy of those still afloat;
bewailing, too, the amazing increase of steam, that, now left them
practically little to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, brother,&quot; said the North-Easter, &quot;I can
recollect when I used to bring down a whole fleet of noble
clippers, from as high up as 3deg, but now I haven't been as far
for years. What's the use of bothering about nasty smoky steamers,
who take no notice whatever of you, and lumbering tramps of
sailers, who can't do no more at their top than eight, or lie
nearer the wind than a whole handful of points.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True, brother, most true,&quot; sighed the South Easter.
&quot;It's a dismal change, indeed from the days when coming up to
the very edge of the Doldrums, I'd steal in and bring a gallant
clipper out, and rush her away south, chipping off a stuns'l boom
now and again, just for fun. I remember getting the Thermopylae in
about 2deg the time she made that wonderful run. I liked her so
well, and she always did me so much credit, that I used to look out
for her afterwards, and help her all I could. And then there were
the Salamis, and the Cimba, and the Cutty Sark, and the Patriarch,
and the Torridon, and the Brilliant&mdash;all ships it was a
pleasure to have business with. But now I watch for them in
vain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In vain,&quot; sadly echoed the North-Easter, who was
lying full stretch with his visitor on a bank of dark clouds just
level with the horizon. ''We have seen curious things in our day,
brother, you and I,&quot; he continued, &quot;from the tiny
cockle-shells that the young world tempted us on in fear and
trembling, and with many-prayers, to the steam giants, with which
in these days they attempt to rule us. And ever in the past have
sailormen praised us for our constancy to them in their time of
need. A race of ingrates, these of to-day, brother, who in return
for centuries of honest service are trying their best to rob us of
our occupation!&quot; and the angry Trade spat in disgust, raising
a huge waterspout.</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo!&quot; exclaimed the South-Easter, suddenly rising
and looking round, &quot;you've brought one down with you, I see.
What is she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had quite forgotten her in the pleasure of this,
meeting,&quot; replied the other, glancing to where on the tumble
left by the sudden loss of the Trade, there helplessly rolled a
stately vessel, with her light sails and courses clewed up.
&quot;An old friend, too,&quot; he continued, &quot;and one of the
best of them, the Amyomene. I found her off the Western Islands,
and hustled her down here in great style. Ah, what a treat it is to
feel that you've got something worth blowing for in these miserable
times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I remember her well,&quot; said the Southeaster, who
seemed inclined to brag a little. &quot;Indeed, it was chiefly
through me that she made that big run a few years ago. Found her in
the Doldrums, and sent in some Catspaws, who, after a lot of
trouble, brought her out to me. Then I came from E.S.E., fairly
strong, so that she could make a fair wind of it. And
then&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so,&quot; interrupted his brother wind good
humoredly. &quot;Well, suppose now, that her great chance in life
has come at last, you do the same again, and help her to make a
better passage still. I heard some talk on board about her trying
to beat a steamer, and I think it's our bounden duty to assist her
all we can. Besides, there's as passenger, the prettiest girl I've
seen for many a long day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bless my heart!&quot; exclaimed the other eagerly.
&quot;You don't say so? And trying to race a beastly steamer! Now,
upon my word, this is quite interesting! &quot;Why, of course, I'll
do my very best for her. I'll even strain a point and take her down
till she meets our cousin Old Westerly, and although he's rather by
way of being a bully, still he's right enough at bottom, and I'll
recommend her to his care. But the trouble with these clippers is
that, do you what you will for them, they always come to grief when
they get off the Australian coast amongst the mongrel nameless
winds, that blow in those latitudes. I was over that way last
summer, just for a trip&mdash;nothing doing in my domain but
steamers&mdash;and I can honestly say that none of the stupid
things seem to know their own minds for an hour together. However,
let us go and see the pretty girl. Gently, now!&quot;</p>
<p align="center">II.</p>
<p>&quot;By jingo, Miss Aggie,&quot; said Captain Mark, slapping
his thigh, as suddenly wetting his finger he held it aloft, whilst
soft airs came hovering round where they stood, cooling their hot
faces, and tenderly lifting stray tresses of hair that escaped from
under the girl's sunbonnet, &quot;if it were possible, I could
almost believe that this was the South-East trade coming for us.
Look at that bank of cloud to the east'ard. But such luck was never
heard of&mdash;hardly to lose the noble North-Easter an hour and
then pick up his brother! I'm afraid we're in the Doldrums, right
enough. And still&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>Stronger grew the breaths of wind. A royal flapped with a sharp
report; men stared aloft, and uncapped to meet a cool gust. The
ship shook herself, and rattled sheet and tack blocks fore and aft;
the clewed-up crossjacks bellied out, and fell flat again; jibs and
staysails, half-hauled down, jerked their hanks impatiently along
the stays; the vane at the mizzen-royal pole fluttered and fell,
whirled all round the compass, then streamed steadily out to the
east of south.</p>
<p>&quot;Sheet home royals and t'gallants'ls!&quot; bawled the
smart young chief officer. &quot;Down fore and main tacks!
Starboard braces here, some of you! There now, belay all that! Well
the foreyard; well the main!&quot; And in another few minutes the
South-Easter, waiting till all was ready, with a shout of delight
swooped down upon the Amyomene, filling every sail to bursting, and
making the stout old ship lean over till the water ran hissing and
sparkling along the lee rail. Then, recovering herself, she darted
forward like a spurred steed, her sharp, curved bows raising a
mound of white water on each side as they shred through it, and
tore it and scattered it in acres of glistening foam.</p>
<p>&quot;Was there ever such luck?&quot; exclaimed the delighted
skipper. &quot;Only 14 days out and to catch the South-Easter like
this! Lying her course, too, if you please! Truly, Miss Aggie,
you've proved something like a mascotte.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Farewell, brother,'' exclaimed the North-Easter as he
turned homewards in a rain squall. &quot;Deal gently with her. The
last of the good old ships.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My word,&quot; assented the South-Easter in colonial slang
picked up on many a fo'c's'le-head, and with an energy that made
the Amy clew up her royals and mizzen-top gallants'l all in a
hurry.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>The seamen, however, in the comfortable house, on deck for'ard,
were by no means so jubilant as their superiors aft. They had, for
the most part, come out of cargo tubs that required a gale of wind
to kick them along&mdash;great 2000-ton modern tanks of steel and
iron, with neither &quot;make nor shape&quot; about them, and built
only for extra stowage. Thus the Amyomene was a revelation to them;
also one they did not altogether appreciate.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I never seen the like of this,&quot; remarked a man
as the watch on deck came below; &quot;it beats my time holler.
Sixteen, then fifteen, then sixteen again, as reg'lar as clockwork.
Might as well ha' shipped in a steam-jack, mates, for all the
pay-day we'll see! Why, send I may live, if we shan't be sighting
the light on the Cat and Kittens at Endeavor in another week or
two, 'stead o' joggin' along fair and go easy for three months or
so!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Gawd, Bill, yer about right,&quot; said another, taking
off his wet oilskins; &quot;she is a flyer, an' no error. If she's
goin' to do the round like this, it'll be a Chinaman's
pay-day&mdash;bunch o' bananers an' a drink of water&mdash;all
right. Still, mates, she's miles afore the common run o'
lime-juicers. Good tucker we gits, an' plenty of it, an' watch an'
watch, an' a dry fo'c's'le, an' not worked up worth
mentioning.&quot;</p>
<p>Yah, dat is so,&quot; chimed in a German; &quot; 'er is ein goot
schip. But, mein Gott, she vly like von pig pird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A feller wouldn't growl,&quot; remarked a little Cockney
dolorously, &quot;If 'e were 'omeward bound, with three years'
money comin' to' im, an 'nothin' to do but to watch 'er scootin',
an' 'im a thinking o' the gals in the 'Ighway an' down in Farmer's
Folly. But this 'ere game is a dead give-away, so 'elp me, if it
ain't! Nex' boat as I, signs on I'll make a few henquiries
respectin' 'er, les' she might turn hout to be another o' these
flyin' 'ole smarties. 'Owever, it ain't all hover yet. One v'yge I
was slambangin' aroun' fer close on six weeks arter roundin'
Tasmania&mdash;calms an' 'ed winds all the time. I ain't a believer
in this bloomin' carryin' on till yer bust business, I ain't! More
days more dollars, is my motter; an' I wouldn't swear that fer hall
'er flashness she don'a make a 'undred days of it yet.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Better than his promise, the South-Easter took the Amyomene to
32deg South, and then left her for awhile to go and look for the
Westerly&mdash;away just then on business round Cape Horn. This
interval, short as it was, was taken advantage of by a wandering
Monsoon that had strayed out of the Indian Ocean, and for pure
spite, to make the Amy brace sharp up for the first time since
leaving home. And the faces aft lengthened, whilst those for'ard
grew cheerful as the ship fell off her course, and the
quartermasters passed the word to their reliefs, &quot;Full and
by.&quot;</p>
<p>But presently back came the Westerly, roaring with indignation,
and at sight of him the foolish Monsoon ran away with his tall
between his legs.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, cousin,&quot; had said the Old Westerly;
&quot;since you make a point of it, I'll see her through, although
just now I'm a bit tired with having tried to drive a big beast of
a tramp alone at the other corner. Thought she could run! Clumsy as
an elephant! Had to poop her at last, and clear her decks. Left her
hove-to repairing damages? Know this one? Should say I do! It was
through me she made that great passage three seasons ago. Something
like a ship she is. What's that you say&mdash;only 28 days to here?
My colonial! She's worth helping. Does us credit. Oh, running some
steamer, is she? All right; let those steamers look out for
themselves as I'm coming back. Well, so long! Remember me to
North-Easter when you see him again. Now, stand clear!&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;It's early days to catch a Westerly,&quot; remarked
Captain Mark; &quot;and we've carried a fair wind further than I've
ever done before. I'd give a fiver to know where the Balkan is.
Such a run as we're making&mdash;hardly a day under the 300! If it
were only possible to keep at it right through! Why, then, Miss
Aggie,&quot; he continued to the girl, who, well wrapped up, stood
beside him, her beautiful face aglow with health and her blue eyes
with pleasure, &quot;if we could have only have kept it up, I say,
you'd not have gained much by taking steam, and the old Amy would
have been the talk of the world. But I fear this head wind's dished
us.&quot; (This was just when the stupid Monsoon took charge.)
&quot;It may not last, though,&quot; concluded the skipper,
hopefully glancing Westward. Nor, as we have seen, did it. Whilst
at dinner, the men were heard at the braces, and the Captain,
squinting up at the tell-tale, jumped to his feet exclaiming.
&quot;By Jingo, we've got 'em!&quot; and ran on deck followed by
his passenger and her maid.</p>
<p>Here already, the Westerly, heading just then from N.N.W. was
muttering and rumbling in the bellies of the courses and topsails,
and calling through the straining gear with an infinity of wild
voices, all saying at once, &quot;Get along, good old ship! I'm the
Westerly, the King of the Roaring Forties. I mean you well, but
don't trifle with me. Get along now, because I mean business; it's
all for your own good, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>To which the Amy replied by calling all hands to shorten sail to
the lower topsails and the forecourse. Then, as by degrees, the
Westerly worked himself nearly, but not too far, aft, Captain Mark,
to the old wind's delight, mast-headed the upper topsail yards, and
set the fore and main topgallant sails. Then with the Westerly
blowing a living gale behind her, and huge green seas foaming at
the taffrail thirty feet above the helmsman's head, the good ship
settled down to work to the tune of 310 knots, 312, 314, 320, 336,
and on one never-to-be-forgotten day, 360&mdash;equal to nearly 16
statute miles per hour.</p>
<p>&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; roared the Westerly as he
watched four men straining at the logline, and noted the marks as
they came in. &quot;That's a record for you, old ship, and it will
never be beaten, because before you strike the Meeting of the
Trades again they'll sell you foreign to people that don't
understand us, you and me. Drive along, old beauty, you've got your
chance. Make the most of it.&quot;</p>
<p>And so excited did the Westerly become that he took the
foretop-gallant sail clean out of the boltropes and whirled it away
to leeward like a cloud of smoke. And the great wind laughed as he
saw it go, and shouted, &quot;Never mind, old friend. It's out of
my beat; but I'll put you through Bass Strait for that. And more,
I'll tell a young Sou'-Wester I know who lives round Cape Pillar,
and is steadier than the general run of those flighty Australians,
to keep an eye on you for the run up the coast. Come along, now!
Got that new t'gan's'l bent? Then off we go again.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Balkan had steadily thumped and clanked down the
African coast in hot sunshine and smooth water, and, as became a
5000 ton trlple-expansion-engined boat, heedless, as long as her
tail shaft held, of trades, or, with a few exceptions, much else in
the shape of wind.</p>
<p>As to his bet, it was doubtful whether her skipper ever thought
twice about it; or, if he did, it was but to smile at his old
friend's conceit. At Capetown he had stayed for two days,
discharging some cargo, and coaling. Then, steering to the
southward for a while, he shaped a course along the 40th parallel,
little dreaming that the Amyomene, favored of all the winds, was
even then running her easting down far ahead of him at a rate his
engines could never hope to equal. An average eleven he knew would
bring him to Port Endeavour in between 40 and 50 day's&mdash;quite
fast enough for his owners' interests.</p>
<p>But presently he began to realise that he was in for a treat. In
place of the usual westerly wind he had come to look upon as
inevitable and unchangeable, and of which, having only two small
rags of fore and aft canvas, he had hitherto taken little notice,
he found himself confronted with a roaring, tearing, vicious
easterly, dead in the big boat's teeth, and accompanied by a
tremendous sea. In vain he went further south, then hauled north
about. It was ever the same, and the Balkan plunged and rolled, and
the great combers crashed on board her for'ard in tons; whilst aft
her screw, lifting clean out of the water, let the engines race
until all thought the shaft must go. So at last they hove her to.
And when a five thousand ton mass of steel like the Balkan turns
sulky, no wind can hurt her much so long as she has plenty of sea
room. All this was, of course, the Westerly on his return
performing the promise to the Amy. And inasmuch as he knew of no
particular steamer, he treated them all alike&mdash;Union boats,
and White Stars, and Shaw, Saville's frozen-meater's. Most of us
who were interested can well recollect the stories these overdue
vessels brought to the Antipodes of the heavy weather, and its
abnormal conditions, in the Southern Ocean during June-July of
189&mdash;.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;Good bye, good old ship,&quot; said the Westerly, after
seeing her safe through Bass Strait, out of which he had blown some
nasty thick weather and head winds, and leaving her in care of the
young Southerly at Cape Pillar. &quot;You're all right now; but if
I were you, I'd never come this way any more. You'll never beat
this record. Of course I'll always do my best for an old friend
like you. Still, you know, this'll place you at the top of the
tree, and it'll be hard to have to climb down again. So long, then,
old beauty, you can put all your clothes on now! The youngster's
got no vice in him, and he'll run you up in a couple of days
comfortably. I'm off now to heave the Southern Ocean ships to for
you.&quot; So the Amyomene covered her stately spars with canvas
from truck to hounds, and surged along up the coast at a modest
twelve. She might have gone faster, but the young Southerly was so
proud of the charge given him by the great and influential
Westerly, and was so determined to be careful of it, that, although
sorely tempted to show off, he refrained, and only blew a beautiful
steady breeze and held his tongue.</p>
<p>At Wilson's Promontory the Amyomene had made her number. But the
signalman, certain there must be an error, had contented himself
with the message, &quot;Green-painted, full rigged ship passed this
morning. Made her number 44678.&quot; And the shipping people of
Port Endeavor, when this was posted at the Exchange that same
afternoon and they turned up the register and saw what vessel owned
it, laughed heartily, and remarked that the age of miracles, was
over; and that ships, no matter how fast they may be, don't come
into port a month before even their consignees begin to think of
them as nearing Australian shores.</p>
<p>But late next day a tug, sauntering rather further down the
coast than usual, ran across the Amyomene, who, on sighting her,
promptly shortened sail and hove to.</p>
<p>On the bridge stood the master, who, knowing her as well as his
own boat, still refused to believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, cap'en,' he shouted, as he came alongside,
&quot;don't tell me you're from home! Why, it seems only last week
I pulled you out. Forty-five days from Gravesend. Good Jerusalem!
Is it possible?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like it, Roberts, don't it?&quot; replied Captain
Mark, striving hard to keep an unmoved face. &quot;Is the Balkan in
yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a sight of her,&quot; said the other, still deep in
amazement; &quot;There ain't no room for steamers when you're
about, sir. Next thing I'll hear'll be that you and the old beauty
has took the contrack to carry the mails 'stead o' the Arcadia an'
Ormuz an' that lot. Oh, my country! What a passidge! We thought a
lot o' the sixty-five. But this&mdash;! Give him a cheer,
boys!&quot; he shouted to his crew, who, only half-convinced, were
staring open-mouthed at the Amy as if there were something uncanny
about her. But they cheered with a right good will; and hooking on
to the tall clipper the sturdy tug dragged her swiftly through the
falling lights towards her haven, while the young Southerly, his
mission finished, shrilled his farewell through the now naked spars
and rigging, and then departed, leaving the sea like a
millpond.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>The Port was thunderstruck when, the next day up the harbor came
the Amy, flying all her bunting and the blue ensign at the gaff.
Alongside her affectionately cuddled the stout Heroine, decked out
in the code and shrieking triumphant cock-a-doodle doos through her
syren as she dragged the clipper into a berth at the Quay, crowded
with citizens who cheered and cheered till they were hoarse. The
news had got abroad with amazing rapidity. And Sailor Town had come
out in thousands to catch a sight of the fastest ship in the
world.</p>
<p>And presently a carriage drove slowly through the crowd,
escorted by four mounted policemen, whilst no less a personage than
the Governor of Cooksland himself, accompanied by his aide de-camp,
got out and waited impatiently for the Amyomene to haul in.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>There was no time lost with regard to the wedding; and in just a
week the papers&mdash;which had been occupied with the Amyomene and
her wonderful passage, and accounts of the presentation of a great,
richly-embroided silk burgee to her commander from the Chamber of
Commerce&mdash;were chronicling the marriage of Miss Agatha Bayliss
and Captain Herbert St. John, A.D.C.</p>
<p>The bride, it was stated, was given away by &quot;Captain Mark
Watson, R.N.R., of the ship Amyomene, whose name will be still
fresh in the recollection of the public from her late phenomenal
passage to our shores. And a week later, the Balkan, very rusty,
and very overdue, and with a very much astonished commander, came
up the harbor.</p>
<p>As for the Amyomene, just as she finished discharging, the Cable
brought the news that she had been bought by a Norwegian firm with
agents in Endeavor, and that she was to proceed direct to Waratah,
there to load coal for Manila.</p>
<p>And Captain Mark, as he read the message, which also contained
an intimation that he was to return at his own convenience by mail
steamer at his owners' expense, said to his friend, the master of
the Balkan, &quot;Perhaps it's just as well. We're both of
us&mdash;the Amy and me pretty equally played out, man and ship.
All the same, if she was mine and I had the money, I'd put her in a
glass case. The world will never see her like again. Thank God, I
shan't see her with Stavanger or Bergen on her stern, all black,
and grimy, and forlorn! It would break my heart, I do believe. And
if ships have hearts it will break hers!</p>
<p>Whether this was so or not, it certainly happened that on her
way up the coast to Waratah, and when the new executive could have
sworn that the Amy was well out at sea, she, one foggy night, put
herself gently but irretrievably ashore in Oyster Bay.</p>
<p>The crew had just time to get comfortably landed when one of the
Southerly Busters (no relations to the young Southerly of Cape
Pillar) coming up took her off her shelving beach and sunk her in
deep water. Thus was she spared alike the smothering of her noble
record with hideous coal dust, and the breaking up of her by the
merciless hammers of the ship knacker. And to this day, in very
calm weather, looking down through many fathoms, you may still
catch glimpses of tangled spars and gear to show where sleeps the
last of the once great fleet of fast and stately clippers,
beautiful and graceful fabrics, whose like we shall never more cast
eyes upon, and whose disappearance the winds who so well befriended
her never cease lamenting.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p>If I had known when I signed articles as chief mate of the
<i>Lynette</i> that her master, Jonah Scrumley, was also her owner,
I would have backed out of her without any fuss, badly off for a
billet though I was. But when he engaged me in the South West India
Dock, Captain Jonah didn't even hint at it, and the ship being
ready for sea when I joined, there wasn't much time for me to pry
into details.</p>
<p>The skipper was a short, stout, red-faced man, with a shifty
pale blue eye; he wore a full grey beard, tinged here and there by
patches of original yellow, but his upper lip was clean shaven. He
was quite bald, save for a fringe of rusty hair.</p>
<p>During my time in the British Mercantile Marine I had served
mainly with the modern shipmaster, but I could see at a glance that
Scrumley was one of the old school, and, as far as my experience
went, not a very favorable specimen either.</p>
<p>The <i>Lynette</i> was a vessel of Govan built, and up-to-date
so far as double topgallant and topsail yards, steel lower and
topmasts in one, bowsprit and jibboom the same, yardarm clewlines,
etc., went. Although not a clipper, she looked good for twelve, if
driven. We were bound to Adelaide, in South Australia, with a mixed
sort of cargo, and, taking things all round, I considered myself
lucky at getting a show that I knew dozens of men in Wells Street
Home and &quot;Green's&quot; would have given a finger joint
for&mdash;so bad were times just then.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Mr. Hart, my second mate,&quot; remarked the
Captain, as we towed down the river to Gravesend, presenting me to
a man who had only arrived as we cast off from the dummy. &quot;I
hope,&quot; continued the skipper, &quot;that you'll get on well
together; Mr. Hart is my son-in-law, Mr. Curtin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The dickens he is!&quot; I was nearly exclaiming, for if
there is one thing I hate it's to get amongst a skipper's relations
in a ship's afterguard. Either above or below you it's equally bad.
However, I luckily kept myself in hand, and took the grimy paw the
newcomer extended.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; went on Captain Jonah, &quot;we're quite a
little happy family party this voyage The steward's a cousin of my
wife and the bo'sun is my nephew. Both very good men indeed,&quot;
he added, vainly trying to smooth out the grin in time as I turned
and faced him with, I am certain, anything but a pleasant
expression.</p>
<p>To my surprise, at Gravesend, whilst we hung on to a buoy, some
passengers came off. There were five altogether, consisting of a
very stout woman and her lath of a husband, who turned out to be a
Mr. and Mrs. Paynter, on a voyage for the benefit of Mr. Paynter's
health; a Roman Catholic priest, clean-faced and rosy; and two
other women&mdash;one, by her dress, a widow, and the other, a
tall, elderly, grim, horse-faced and moustached person, who, as she
swung up the gangway, cast a hard-a-weather eye aloft, and glanced
ominously at the skipper, who was trying after a clumsy enough
fashion to do the amiable at the break of the poop. She carried a
walking-stick, and, instead of diving below as the others did, she
rolled aft to the wheel, and presently cried
&quot;Captain!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, ma'am,&quot; he replied, slowly making his way
towards her.</p>
<p>&quot;Call yourself a sailor?&quot; replied Mrs. Craggs (this
was her name I found later) scowling from under a pair of beetling
brows.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so, ma'am,&quot; replied the skipper, getting a
fine beetroot color, and choking a little as he spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; says she, sharp and raspy, &quot;what d'ye
mean by going to sea with your to'gallant clewlines foul o' the
royal backstay? A nice mess we'll be in if everything's in a like
state all over, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>And, as I live, following the skipper's dumfounded gaze aloft, I
saw that she had spotted a fact! Those infernal, careless riggers
had rove the clewlines with no less than a couple of turns round
the royal backstay.</p>
<p>&quot;It's my chief officer's&mdash;&quot; the Old Man was
beginning, darting a malevolent glance at me, when she brought him
up all standing with: &quot;Your chief granny, sir. What's the use
of a master's eye if it isn't everywhere? I'm only a frail woman,
but I sailed the sea for twenty years with my poor husband when he
was alive, and I know what's what. Ah! he was a sailor-man, not a
Dutchman&quot; (with a disparaging look at the skipper). &quot;And,
Captain, I'd like you to know that you can't come the old sojer
over me. I've paid for my passage, and I want to get to the other
side safely. But by what I've seen already of carelessness as would
disgrace a Dago, I'm doubtful of ever reaching there.&quot; With
this parting salute she shook her head threateningly at us, struck
the deck smartly with her stick, and stumped down the companion
steps, leaving the pair of us staring at each other in a sort of
mutual bewilderment. Then the ludicrous side of the business
striking me, I burst into a fit of laughter. But it didn't catch
the Old Man that way; and, throwing a sour and sullen look at me,
he walked for'ard.</p>
<p>The <i>Lynette</i> carried fourteen hands before the mast, and,
much to my surprise, I presently found not only that they were all
British, but that they were all &quot;shilling a month men,&quot;
i.e., just working their passages out. And when, after letting go
our tug at Deal, and sheeting home the topsails to a fair
down-channel wind, Peter Hart and I tossed for choice, and picked
our watches, I thought I'd never seen a finer lot of young fellows.
So A1 were they, indeed, at least the majority of them, and so much
above the general run of Merchant Jack, both in speech and bearing,
that I was puzzled. However, it was a pleasure to handle such a
crowd; and, as I had been taught to consider myself a smart
officer, I rattled them around at the first chance in a way that
made Hart and the skipper stare.</p>
<p>It was an all hands job in the chops of the channel. A westerly
caught us with more kites on than we had a right to carry. The
second had been trying to show off before the passengers, and in
consequence we nearly lost our sticks. But the port watch coming on
deck we soon got things ship-shape again, and out of the corner of
my eye I observed Mrs. Craggs, as she held on to a backstay, nod
her long head approvingly.</p>
<p>She wore a big sou'-wester, and was wrapped from head to foot in
a yellow oilskin coat tied round the middle with spun-yarn. And as
she stood there in the height of the fierce squalls, with her feet
well apart, upright, but swaying easily to every heave of the ship,
her dark rugged features chock full of appreciative interest in the
wild scene, I declare to you that she looked fifty times more a
captain than did Scrumley, who, close at hand, alternately shot at
her glances of aversion and fear, and bitterly abused Hart for
jeopardising his masts.</p>
<p>I was very satisfied with the way both ship and crew had
behaved, and as the weather was wet and cold, when we got her under
three lower topsails and a little fore and aft canvas, I asked the
Captain's permission to give the hands a tot of grog all round.
Shilling a month men are, as a rule, pretty independent, and I was
surprised to find how well ours worked. It was a risky thing, too,
I thought, to ship a whole crew of them, and for policy's sake, if
nothing else, it would be wise to appear liberal&mdash;even if at a
cost of, perhaps, a half-penny per head.</p>
<p>But the skipper thought otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;Mind your own business, sir,&quot; he roared. &quot;When I
want your advice I'll ask it! Spirits to the crew! What next, I
wonder! D'ye want to ruin me? Why don't you ask me to kill all the
fowls in the coops for 'em, eh? An' a couple o' pigs! Oh, confound
it, what's the sea a-comin' to? I'll let you know I'm owner and
master here, young man!&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craggs and the man at the wheel could hear every word of
this, and whilst I watched a wide grin of enjoyment ripple over the
fellow's face as he took it in, she strode across and said in her
deep voice: &quot;Mister Mate, you're in the right. My poor dear
husband always gave his men a nip after a job like this. I am
afraid this is a mean sort of a ship and captain, to say nothing of
the owner, we've got. Dearie me! Oh, if my poor dear husband was
only here! However, I'm thankful to see that we've at least one
sailor-man on board,&quot; and making me an odd little bow she took
off her great coat, and with a last glance aloft went below, where
as the steward told me, she waited &quot;hand and foot&quot; on the
rest of the passengers who were all sea-sick.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Running through the Bay and into warm weather off the Western
Islands without incident worth noting, except that some rumbles of
dissatisfaction about the food reached my ears, we soon had the
other four saloon folk on deck. As for Mrs. Craggs, no weather had
been able to daunt her, and she seemed to be about as much by night
as by day. Her continually reiterated phrase: &quot;Oh, if my poor
dear husband was only here,&quot; had caught on, and it was
inexpressibly ludicrous to hear far aloft, in the daylight and in
the darkness, yard-arm calling to yard-arm: &quot;Oh, if my poor
dear husband was only here!&quot;</p>
<p>The skipper was sullen and reserved, and passed a good deal of
his time mending and patching at the fine weather suit of sails we
were presently to bend, or doing odd jobs of carpentering about the
decks, thus saving the wages of a sailmaker and a
carpenter&mdash;men whose services are not to be obtained for a
shilling a month. Nor did he ever, except on Sundays, have his
meals with the passengers, the Roman Catholic priest, Father
O'Sullivan, taking the head of the table, and making a pleasant
substitute with his jokes and laughter, his jolly, red, fat face,
and his broad brogue.</p>
<p>Father O'Sullivan, and indeed all the others, it transpired
presently, had chosen to voyage by the <i>Lynette</i> not only for
reasons of health, but because of the low fares as compared to
those charged by the few liners who now offered accommodation to
passengers.</p>
<p>And in spite of Mrs. Craggs' forebodings, they seemed pretty
certain of having, if a long passage, at least a safe one. For,
much to that lady's indignation, openly expressed, every night the
skipper, if the weather did not seem to his mind, would take in all
the light sails, and as like as not let the <i>Lynette</i> jog
along under her lower topgallant sails, making a miserable six or
so out of a fine fair wind when she ought to have been reeling off
twelve.</p>
<p>Never was a man more careful of his own property. Never, too,
had I seen such continual scrubbing of paint and chipping of iron
rust, and coal-tarring of anchors and cables and wire as went on in
the <i>Lynette</i>.</p>
<p>Watch and watch apparently did not give time enough for this
work, and in about 15 degrees N. Captain Jonah informed us that
there was to be no more afternoon watch below, i.e., that, with an
interval for dinner, all hands would remain on deck to scrape and
scrub and polish.</p>
<p>Now if there is one thing more than another that galls the
sailor, it is thus to be done out of his four hours' rest from
twelve o'clock till four.</p>
<p>He will put up with bad food and abuse and hardships of every
description&mdash;only don't rob him of his afternoon watch below.
And directly I received the order I felt ill must come of
it&mdash;especially with a crew such as ours, who apparently cared
nothing for wages or bad discharges, and were only anxious to reach
Australia.</p>
<p>Long ere this I had discovered that every man jack of them was
bound for the land of gold&mdash;that Coolgardie, wondrous stories
of which could be heard, and whose nuggets were to be seen in
London's Sailor Town long before we left.</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, that to men like ours, burning with
desire of speed, the <i>Lynette</i> was about the least desirable
ship in the world they could have chosen for their purpose, and
that they chafed bitterly at the frequent and useless shortening
sail by the over-cautious captain. Add to this the bad food, and
now the loss of the afternoon watch, and it will be understood that
our crowd began to feel like mischief.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three month's monotonous plodding and we were only just to the
southward of Good Hope, when we ought to have been making Kangaroo
Island; and everybody was complaining. But a change was at
hand.</p>
<p>One morning I heard Captain Jonah giving the bo'sun orders to
get some fresh casks of pork out of the after hatch. That day,
happening to come on deck about eight bells, I saw one of the men,
named Topham, march aft carrying a kid full of steaming meat, and
followed by a long string of his shipmates, some bearing tin
plates, hook-pots, and more kids, or small wooden tubs.
Instinctively I guessed that a crisis had arrived. The second mate
was on the poop; the Captain busy roping a sail; the passengers
sitting round as usual; the widow, Mrs. Lundy, working an
antimacassar; Mrs. Craggs stumping to and fro to leeward; the
priest reading; Mrs. Paynter playing checkers for Avax matches with
her husband.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1305211h-images/mildmutiny02.jpg" width="349" height="550"></p>
<p>Mounting the poop ladder, Topham dumped his burden down on the
skylight, imitated by each of his fellows in turn, until all in a
row there stood a mass of evil-smelling pork, a heaped up barge of
weevilly biscuits, a big lump of something that looked like
mahogany, but was meant for beef, a few plates full of black sugar,
and a kid of pea soup that smelt nearly as strongly as the pork
with which it had been boiled.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; remarked Topham, a quiet, smart, good-looking
young fellow, as he touched his cap to the passengers, &quot;we've
brought some curiosities aft to show you, ladies and gentlemen.
Three months on this stuff we've put up with. The passage appears
likely to last another three months. By that time, if we don't get
a change, we'll be all dead men. We don't want to die. Therefore we
must have a change. Be so kind, ladies and gentlemen, as to inspect
this museum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! what! what!&quot; exclaimed the skipper, dropping
his palm and needle and coming up to the men. &quot;Growling at
good food! Go for'ard, you villains, and eat your dinners! There's
not a better found ship out o' London,&quot; and he shook a
threatening finger at the crowd. &quot;Where are my officers?&quot;
he continued, his pale eyes gleaming. &quot;Mr. Curtin! Mr. Hart!
Mr. Alexander! Send these people to their fo'c's'le again. Mr.
O'Sullivan and Mr. Paynter, I must ask your assistance to quell
this mutiny.&quot;</p>
<p>But neither the priest nor Paynter stirred. As for the men they
merely grinned. And they were not all of the same polite kidney as
Topham; for one of them suddenly seizing the pork kid thrust it
under poor Mrs. Lundy's nose, saying: &quot;There, marm, you just
draw up a sniff o' that 'good food,' an' see 'ow you'd like to be
fed on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lor a mussy, my man, take it away, do,&quot; squealed the
old lady. &quot;Why it smells wuss than a glue factory!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a great laugh at this, albeit with a note of menace in
it, as the men turned their eyes on the skipper. With a little
tactful handling perhaps, even now, and in face of their
demonstration, matters might have been tided over. But that silly
ass, Hart, with the view of pleasing his father-in- law, must needs
come along with a spoon, and dipping it in the soup take a big
mouthful and pronounce it excellent. Still, there was no outburst
as I expected there would be.</p>
<p>&quot;You like it, Mr. Hart?&quot; queried Topham suavely.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital soup,&quot; grunted the second, striving hard to
keep his face from showing the disgust he felt. &quot;Could live on
it all the voyage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would the Captain, I wonder, mind tasting the pork&mdash;a
small piece, now, on a biscuit?&quot; asked Topham almost
pleadingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; replied the skipper in a more
conciliatory tone than he had yet used, &quot;what's good enough
for my men's good enough for me, although I am master and
owner.&quot; And, sure enough, calling for a knife and fork the Old
Man took a slice of corrupt pig and vermin-infested bread and tried
to look as if it agreed with him.</p>
<p>I thought my turn was to come next, and had fully made up my
mind not to perjure my immortal soul in such a cause, when down
swooped that old stormy petrel of a Mrs Craggs who had been
watching the proceedings with the liveliest interest.</p>
<p>&quot;And now, my men,&quot; the skipper was saying in pompous
self-satisfied tones, &quot; as you have seen that the food is good
enough for your officers. I trust there will be no more complaints
during the voyage. Now go away for'ard and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1305211h-images/mildmutiny03.jpg" width="590" height="550"></p>
<p>&quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; interrupted the old woman,
shaking her stick at him. Then turning to Topham, she inquired:
&quot;What's your little game, my man? You don't expect to pull my
leg in such a simple fashion, do you? You don't think you can
gammon me like you can these sojers, do you? I was at sea when you
were a baby, my lad. You know well enough you have made up your
minds not to eat stinking rubbish any longer, no matter who else
does. What? Eh? Going to cut our throats, are you? Come, now, out
with it.&quot;</p>
<p>For a minute or two Topham was fairly taken aback. Then he said
politely enough: &quot;I should be very sorry to do anything of the
kind, ma'am. We are not bloodthirsty pirates. In fact, it appears
that we have no cause of complaint, even about the food, as the
Captain and the afterguard seem to relish it so well. So I suppose,
boys,&quot; he concluded, turning to the rest, &quot;all we can do
is to apologise and go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gammon again!&quot; retorted the old woman. &quot;You're
too polished for my money. There's something at the back of all
this. Oh, if my poor dear husband was only here!&quot;</p>
<p>At the familiar formula there was a general snigger, under cover
of which, on a word or two from Topham, the men caught up their
traps and marched off, leaving the skipper to congratulate himself
on an easily won victory.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>But instinctively I felt that all was not over yet, and Mrs.
Craggs had diagnosed the position correctly. Not a word had the men
said respecting the great grievance of all&mdash;the loss of the
afternoon watch. The more I thought it over the more was I certain
that the demonstration just concluded had been a mere farce, and
that their minds were already made up to some sort of concerted
action.</p>
<p>Contrary to his usual custom, the Captain, that evening,
appeared at the dinner-table and laid down the law to us on the
management of sailors. &quot;All you've got to do,&quot; said he,
&quot;is to show 'em a firm front. Give in to 'em and you're done.
Food, indeed! Why, if you let'em have the best in the ship they'll
growl all the more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't feed pigs on any of the stuff I saw
to-day!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Craggs viciously, &quot;I know what
ship's stores are as well as you do. And if them ain't old Navy
condemned's, call me a Dutchman! You and your 'firm front' 'll land
us all in trouble yet, or I'm much mistaken!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to goodness, ma'am,&quot; replied Captain Scrumley,
livid with anger, &quot;that you'd mind your own business and leave
me and mine alone. I don't want your advice, and your constant
nagging is disagreeable to listen to, besides being mischievous in
the extreme. Why,&quot; he cried in a sudden access of passion,
&quot;if I ever saw such a woman, or conceived of one! It was a bad
day for me when I took your passage-money, Mrs. Craggs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same to you, sir,&quot; replied the old lady with spirit.
&quot; If I'd only chanced on a decent ship and master I'd ha' been
in Adelaide long enough ago. More than three months out, and only
just beginning to run our easting down! Why,&quot; she shrilled,
addressing the company generally, &quot;we'll be all blue-mouldy
before this trip's over! Did one ever hear the like? Already you
can see for yourselves the food's nothing as good as it used to be.
By the time we're half-way across the Southern Ocean we'll be
eatin' just the same stuff as you saw the men with to-day. And glad
to get it.&quot;</p>
<p>This was in the second dog watch; and at five bells (seven
o'clock), as usual, both watches were called to shorten sail. It
was a lovely evening, with a fine nor'-westerly breeze to which all
that day we had been showing only three lower topgallant sails in
place of six. And now the Old Man must needs take in even these,
leaving the <i>Lynette</i> under topsails only. Still dissatisfied,
he had the upper mizzen topsail furled, top-mast staysails hauled
down, and, lastly, the crossjack stowed. It was truly heart-rending
to be obliged to give such orders&mdash;well accustomed by this
time as I was to the business. The men, however, seemed unusually
lively and full of go this night, flying about like lamplighters,
crowing aloft like roosters, and passing along the old gag as they
worked: &quot;Oh, if my poor dear husband was only here!&quot; with
more than their accustomed vigor.</p>
<p>The skipper had been very busy all day painting and patching,
with spells of blacksmith and carpenter work, and he had turned in
early&mdash;just as soon, in fact, as he was sure that his ship
was, from his point of view, safe against any surprise the weather
might hold for her. Hart had the deck from eight till twelve, at
which latter hour I should have been called. But when I did wake,
it was to see broad daylight streaming through my bullseye, and to
hear the sounds of washing decks going on above me. Also the
<i>Lynette</i> was lying over at quite an unaccustomed angle, and,
to judge from the look of the seas as they swished past, travelling
at a quite unaccustomed rate.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1305211h-images/mildmutiny04.jpg" width="429" height="550"></p>
<p>And as I lay there, trying to get the hang of matters, I felt
finely bothered. Surely I couldn't have kept the middle watch
without remembering anything about it! On the other hand, I must
have had all night in&mdash;a clear impossibility. For a few
minutes I argued the question, only getting worse fogged in the
attempt. Then, turning out, I dressed and went on deck.</p>
<p>The hands had just finished washing down the poop. The wind had
freshened from the same quarter as on the previous night. But in
place of the shortened canvas I had left on her, the ship was
roaring along under a main-royal, taking spray in showers over her
weather rail, leaning over to the seas as if she loved them, and
tearing through their white crests and hurling them behind her with
such a fine, breezy fury, and such a shrilling music of tautened
gear and canvas aloft as if proud to show what she could do when
called upon.</p>
<p>I glanced round for Hart but could see nothing of him.</p>
<p>&quot;This is better sort of work, Mr. Curtin,&quot; suddenly
said a voice behind me. And, turning, I saw Topham dressed in a
blue serge suit, with regatta shirt and collar, necktie, spick and
span, in fact, and looking quite the officer. I suppose he must
have seen the amazement in my face for he laughed, saying:
&quot;It's all right. I wouldn't have you called. Fact is we've
taken possession of the ship. Nobody's hurt, and I've explained
things to the passengers, who are quite satisfied. I'm skipper,
McIntyre's chief (unless you'd prefer to keep your billet), and
Barton's second. We don't want luxuries, so will manage without any
third.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, I say, you know!&quot; I exclaimed feebly enough,
finding my tongue at last, &quot;this is a serious matter, Topham!
Mutiny on the high seas! Do you mean to say that you actually
intend to stick to the ship?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Till we've done with her,&quot; replied Topham. &quot;And
as for the mutiny business, why we'll just have to chance that. And
let me tell you, Mr. Curtin, that it might have been much
worse&mdash;very much. But, fortunately, nobody was hurt. Only the
men insisted that the skipper and the steward, and Hart, and that
fool-bo'sun should be kept in the 'tween decks aft for the rest of
the passage, and fed on the fo'c's'le tucker they seemed to take to
so eagerly yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>And such was the relief with which I heard this that,
notwithstanding my surprise and anxiety, to say nothing of the
resentment I naturally felt at being so curtly spoken to by one of
my watch, I could not help smiling at the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;And the navigation of the ship?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that's all right,&quot; laughed Topham. &quot;Both Mac
and I are passed masters, and have sailed better craft than the
<i>Lynette</i> in our time. Barton's got a chief mate's ticket, and
at least three of the rest are seconds. Too many jolly navigators,
if anything, amongst us. And we mean to send the boat for all she's
worth. Flesh and blood wouldn't stand any longer what we've stood
for the past twelve weeks. Actually, as I said before, if you knew
as much as I do, you'd be thankful matters hadn't turned out any
worse. They were very nearly doing so once or twice,'' he added
significantly.</p>
<p>At that moment up came Mrs. Craggs, who of late had dispensed
altogether with her stick. For a minute or two she squinted aloft
appreciatively, then over the side, then into the binnacle. Then
rolling along to where we stood, she growled, after a long stare at
Topham: &quot;So, young man, you've put your foot in it nicely. I
knew yesterday you were up to mischief. I saw it in your eye, sir.
You'll get at least seven years, I should say. With hard labor. Do
you know what my poor dear husband would have done if you'd treated
him like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, ma'am, I do not,&quot; replied Topham, capping her.
&quot;But I am quite sure that Captain Craggs was too good a man to
drive his crew to such extremities by giving them bad food and
robbing them of their lawful rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, that's Gospel truth!&quot; said the mollified old
woman. &quot;And let me tell you that I hope you'll get clear of
the mess somehow. You've promised to take us to Australia as
quickly as you can. And that's one comfort. I see, too, that you
know how to go about it. Which is more than the old idiot down
below did. Well, Mr. Curtin,&quot; she continued, turning to me,
&quot;I hope you had a good nap. How does it feel being a
passenger, eh? Shouldn't wonder if Captain Jonah doesn't blame the
whole thing on you.&quot; And she chuckled as she gave words to the
very idea that was passing through my own mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Never fear,&quot; said Topham reassuringly, &quot;I've
thought of all that. If he doesn't sign a paper confessing that it
was all his own fault, and that Mr. Curtin had nothing at all to do
with the business, and also call the passengers to witness it,
he'll be neither master nor owner any more, for after I've seen you
safe ashore, I'll scuttle his ship and sink her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But where are you making for?&quot; I asked. &quot;What
port is there that under such conditions you dare put
into?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; replied Topham, &quot;is a question which,
without wishing to seem uncivil, I can discuss neither with you nor
any one else.''</p>
<p>Never had there been a quieter or less eventful mutiny. Just
before midnight, it appeared, Hart had been seized, bound, gagged
and shoved into his berth; the Captain, bo'sun, and steward were
then served in a similar fashion. Then Barton was sent to call the
passengers into the saloon, where Topham made them a little speech,
assuring them that no harm should befall them, and that they should
be safely landed, if not actually at their destination, still at
some place whence they could easily reach it.</p>
<p>The ringleader also pointed out that, at their present rate of
sailing, it must take months to get to Australia, whereas he would
convey them there in a few weeks. He plainly hinted, too, his
impression that the Captain was a little cracked, and might even
keep them jogging about the ocean until all the provisions aft were
finished, which, he remarked incidentally, would be a serious state
of things for people in delicate health. Indeed, as Mrs. Craggs
told me with a comical look, the fellow made out such a plausible
case, that the passengers almost believed his proceedings had been
dictated principally by anxiety for their welfare. Thus there was
no trouble, and he sent them all back to bed, pacified and even
thankful.</p>
<p>And presently they came on deck, and after a curious stare
around as if they expected to see something radically altered in
the shape of the ship or the color of the sea, the morning being
chilly, they took to pacing the poop, evidently quite oblivious,
with the exception of Mrs. Craggs, and, perhaps, Father O'Sullivan,
of the gravity of recent events.</p>
<p>Nor, as far as I could see, did anybody appear to concern
themselves much about the missing officers. Topham's assurance that
they were quite comfortable seemed amply sufficient. McIntyre and
Barton, too, were evidently no strangers to saloon and quarterdeck
etiquette, and they backed up Topham, as did, in fact, all hands,
in a most surprising and effectual manner. Work was carried on much
as aforetime, only with less scrubbing and scraping, and more
attention to sail trimming. Afternoon watch below, of course,
became the rule, and I saw liberal supplies of cabin stores going
from lazarette to galley. Otherwise matters went on as usual.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>The new executive took up its quarters aft, and the old one was
relegated to the after 'tween decks, where was plenty of space. One
of the men, who was a carpenter, built bunks; and the
prisoners&mdash;for such they were&mdash;were allowed their
personal effects and anything else they chose to ask for, except
better food than the former fo'c's'le rations.</p>
<p>Besides the Captain, the second mate, and the bo'sun, there was,
as already mentioned, the former's wife's cousin&mdash;the
steward&mdash;who had made himself in many ways most obnoxious to
the men. So that there was a regular family party below. Some of
the after hatches had been taken off, and a sort of companion
rigged up in such fashion as to give plenty of light and air. A
seaman was always stationed here, and without permission no one was
allowed to visit his charges. By Topham's advice it was three days
before I went down. &quot;They'll have been brought to their
bearings a bit by then,&quot; said he. &quot;Just now they're only
abusive. However, if their present diet doesn't calm the wild blood
in them I'm much mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p>And so I found it had. The Captain, certainly, was sulky enough;
but the others begged me to intercede for them, and induce the
mutineers to give them better food. &quot;It's awful,&quot; said
Hart, producing some weevilly, mouldy biscuits. &quot;Look at them,
Mr. Curtin, and say how you'd like to be fed on such
stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the pork! and the beef! and the soup!&quot; put in the
steward lugubriously. &quot;I can't touch nothin'. I'll swear it's
wuss nor ever I served out to the men.&quot;</p>
<p>Now I knew it was exactly the same, but I didn't see any use of
arguing the question, so simply promised to do my best with Topham.
&quot;And what's goin' to be the end of it all?&quot; asked the Old
Man, at last finding his voice, speaking very sulkily. &quot;You've
taken my ship from me and stuck me down here to starve. What's the
next thing, I say? I'll tell you what's the next thing!&quot; he
shouted, in a sudden burst of fury; &quot;jail, jail, years of jail
for the lot o' ye! What! Did you ever hear the like o' such a thing
in these days? An officer conspiring with the men to mutiny, and
seize the ship, and imprison the captain and feed him on
offal.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1305211h-images/mildmutiny05.jpg" width="457" height="550"></p>
<p>&quot;At any rate, you didn't call it offal quite lately,&quot;
I retorted, stung to anger by his words. &quot;Don't you remember
saying what's good enough for my men's good enough for me? Well,
they are giving you a chance to prove it, that's all; and I think
you're getting off very lightly. And you know very well that I have
nothing whatever to do with the business. Had you taken my advice
long ago, all this would never have come to pass. As it is,&quot; I
concluded, rather maliciously, &quot;the worst that can happen to
you is the loss of the ship.&quot;</p>
<p>At this his temper instantly changed, and he almost wailed:
&quot;They're straining her to pieces now; carrying on like madmen!
She's not a new vessel, and she'll never stand such usage. Look how
careful I was of her. I'll put up with the food, tell them, if
they'll only spare my ship. She's all I've got in the
world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be frightened, sir,&quot; I said, touched at the
appeal, &quot;the men in charge are too good sailors to do any
damage. Why, there's a couple of passed masters and a mate, and
Heaven knows how many second mates amongst 'em, and I haven't the
least doubt they'll give us back the <i>Lynette</i> safe and sound
as ever again presently.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then a seaman descended the ladder with the prisoners'
dinner in a couple of kids&mdash;pea-soup and pork, as I could tell
by the terrific odor&mdash;and I bolted to escape the humiliating
sight of their endeavors to eat it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Topham and his mates sent the <i>Lynette</i> foaming
and roaring east-about in great style, keeping well along the 40th
parallel. And I must admit that better men never sailed a ship;
even Mrs. Craggs was satisfied and pleased. Still, it was, as you
may think, weary enough work for me to sit idly by with folded
arms, for there wasn't much society to be got out of the
passengers.</p>
<p>As time passed the prisoners were allowed to take exercise on
the main deck, and it was almost pathetic to watch the old
skipper's bewildered stare aloft and around on the first occasion,
as he heard the strange voices giving orders and saw the ordinary
routine of the ship being carried on without the slightest
reference to her rightful &quot;master and owner.&quot;</p>
<p>But the end was at hand, as mild and uneventful, yet as strange
and unusual as the whole affair had been.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to bear up for Fremantle, Mr. Curtin,&quot; said
Topham to me, one night when I knew the Australian coast could not
be far away. &quot;My first intentions were quite otherwise. But
the Captain seems so reasonable, and so anxious to get his ship
back, and be rid of us, that he is agreeable to almost anything. I
never,&quot; continued Topham, with a grin, &quot;imagined there
could be such virtue in condemned stores. I had a long talk with
him to-day. Just at first he was certainly inclined to be a bit
nasty. But when I swore I'd wreck his ship somewhere on the coast
he caved in at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, briefly, he is going to give us all our
discharges, a proceeding which, as we are only working our passage,
need cause no surprise. We are running very short of water, too, so
that will be another excuse for making the port. And, of course,
Fremantle suits us down to the ground. Further, he has agreed to
sign the statement I mentioned once before, taking all the blame of
the business upon his own shoulders, confessing that the food was
utterly unfit for human consumption (and he ought to know by this
time), and admitting, amongst other matters, that no blame whatever
attaches to you. I can assure you the Old Man is thoroughly
changed. Nor do I think he will ever try such a game on again with
any crew.</p>
<p>&quot;Fancy the high time he'd have had with some full crews of
shilling-a-monthers! Good Lord! Why, Mrs. Craggs is worth fifty of
the old bounder! She is a seawoman if you like! Well, Rottenest
will be in sight at midday on Wednesday. To-day's Monday. Perhaps
you may as well come on in the next act to-morrow?&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, during the morning, Captain Scrumley, having signed
everything he was asked to&mdash;each document witnessed by the
passengers&mdash;resumed command of the <i>Lynette</i>, whilst the
executive <i>pro tem</i>. retired to their original quarters.</p>
<p>I thought it a hazardous experiment on Topham's part. And so,
judging from their uneasy looks, did many of his followers.</p>
<p>Everything, however, went off quietly. At daybreak we got a
pilot; at midday we dropped anchor in Fremantle Harbor; an hour
afterwards the <i>Lynette</i>'s fo'c's'le was deserted.</p>
<p>Luckily the place was full of sailors returning disappointed
from Coolgardie; and these were only too pleased at the chance of
working their passage East. And the skipper, profiting by
experience, laid in a fresh supply of stores, which were at least
fairly decent. Nor, whilst we were running round, was there any
question of the afternoon watch being stopped. Indeed, the
&quot;family party&quot; altogether were in an exceedingly subdued
state, and polite and civil to a degree that rather puzzled the new
hands.</p>
<p>However, in Adelaide, the Captain hinting, that, if I pleased,
my wages for the full trip were at my disposal, I gladly took the
chance and left.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craggs' farewell to the skipper was characteristic:
&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said she, &quot;I never thought to see what
I've seen on this ship. It's only by the mercy of the Lord that
we're here now; and no thanks to you. Take my advice and give up
the sea and buy a farm. You're too old in the horn, and grow too
many barnacles on your back for these times. Master and owner
together's too much for you. The pair of 'em 'll get you down and
worry you some o' these days. Besides, the story's sure to get
about, and you'll have your men always playing hanky panky with
you. Go home to your wife. And stay there. Now, when my poor dear
husband&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src=
"1305211h-images/mildmutiny06.jpg" width="594" height="516"></p>
<p>&quot;Any more for the shore?&quot; shouted the master of the
tug (we were lying at anchor at the Semaphore). And the old woman,
waving her hand in farewell, nimbly descended the gangway. And the
last we saw of her was her tall form as she stood aft, with her
face upturned critically inspecting the <i>Lynette</i>, whilst the
tug puffed and snorted away towards the mouth of the river.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p>&quot;Now what the deuce can it be!&quot; exclaimed Jeffrey
Watson, as he sat on his verandah and curiously examined some
irregularly-shaped dark brown, almost black, and scaly spots, that
within the last few weeks had made their appearance on the backs of
both hands, defying every sort of ointment known to the bush to
remove them. For awhile Jeffrey continued to inspect the things,
and then, forgetting all about them, turned his thoughts towards
Freda Bech, whose clear, young voice could be heard singing, as she
brought the cows home from the river paddock to the homestead,
separated from his own little patch by a post-and-rail fence. Three
years ago Jeffrey, tired of the sea and having saved some money
whilst mate of the labor schooner Aoba, had selected this vacant
eighty-acre block adjoining Herman Bech's on the upper reaches of
the Lillypilly. And, there, day and night, almost, he had toiled
clearing, fencing, ploughing, and coaxing the land to make him a
better return than the sea had done for his twelve years using of
it. Nor was he dissatisfied with the result, as, this calm and
pleasant Sunday afternoon, his eyes roved over his little &nbsp;
domain where the tall corn, crowned with cobs, rustled gently in
the breeze; whilst scattered amongst their whitening stems gleamed
the dark purple green of the great pie melons, and the paler hued
pumpkins nestling in their straggling vines. Further down, towards
the water-frontage, grew straight and strong, and, young as they
were, loaded with fruit, quinces, plums, peaches, and apricot
trees, whilst gorgeous persimmons flamed from a score of bushes.
The four-roomed cottage shadowed by a fine currajong, and from
shingled roof to ground-plate the work of its owner, was only just
finished, and was still odorous of fresh pine. In front gleamed the
noble breadth of water into which great headlands deeply pushed
their tree-covered knees. Behind, and on each side of the little
settlement, the primeval forest out of which it had been hewn rose
tier above tier to the summit of the Altiora hills. And Jeffrey, as
he gazed, felt well satisfied with the result of his toil; nor, now
that the nest was ready for his mate, had he any of that
indefinable yearning for the old life that had at times visited him
during his earlier experience as a farmer.</p>
<p>A smart-looking, brown-faced fellow this seaman-farmer, well on
the right side of 30, with frank, open features and the sharp alert
gaze that a shore life had not yet dulled. Suddenly, catching sight
of a sail rounding one of the headlands, his brow contracted. Then
he laughed and muttering, &quot;All right, Jason Bott, come along.
You're just in time to discover that you never had a show;&quot; he
vaulted over the dividing fence and hurried to where, behind the
red quarters of half a dozen milking cows, he saw a flapping of
white sun bonnet.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the Alert coming, Freda,&quot; said he, as,
kissing the tall, fair-haired, rosy cheeked girl, he walked behind
the &quot;milkers&quot; and their calves on their way to the
yard.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw her, Jeff,&quot; replied Freda, smiling and
blushing, whilst heartily returning the caress, &quot;we'll go down
to the jetty and meet her as soon as the calves are put
up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And tell Bott the day is fixed and invite him to the
wedding. Can't do less for an old shipmate, eh?&quot; asked Jeffrey
merrily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;If you like.&quot; said the girl, &quot;although I'm
sure neither of us want him. Dad says he's pretty certain he did
him badly on that last lot of pumpkins he sent down. He ain't too
particular, I do believe, isn't Jason Bott. However, if corn rises
much higher we'll soon be able to have our own boat, and dad says
he'll help us to get one.</p>
<p>Bott was the owner and skipper of the ketch Alert, trading up
and down the river for produce. He had also been one trip to the
islands as second mate with Jeffrey in the Aoba. He bore, however,
an indifferent name for honesty amongst the fanners when stuff was,
as often happened, entrusted to him &quot;to do the best he could
with.&quot;</p>
<p>For some time, too, he had been pestering Freda with his
attentions, and, although, as Jeffrey put it, &quot;without the
least bit of a show,&quot; he seemed unable or unwilling to realise
the fact. And as the pair, after fixing matters at the milking
yard, strolled towards the little wooden wharf known as
&quot;Bech's,&quot; just in time to see the ketch made fast, they
met Bott himself, square-set, shifty-eyed, middle-aged, rolling up
the path towards the Danish settler's home. His greeting of the
lovers was curt almost to rudeness, whilst his small eyes glanced
inquisitively from one to the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Jason,&quot; said Jeffrey laughing, &quot;Thursday
week next is the day we've fixed on. And of course you'll be there.
Parson's to come at 3 o'clock. Then, after we're hitched, there'll
be a bit of a shivoo&mdash;plenty of drinkin' and eatin', and
dancin'. Freda and me are going to have a week's spell, at Port
Endeavor afore startin' house-keepin'.&quot;</p>
<p>To this Bott muttered something into his beard that might have
been thanks and congratulations, or the reverse.</p>
<p>Come up to the house and have a cup of tea?&quot; said Freda
hospitably, &quot;mam and dad and the boys are away across the
river to Hansen's.&quot;</p>
<p>So the two men sat in the broad passion-vine covered verandah
and filled their pipes, whilst the girl bustled about inside. Bott
was taciturn, not to say sulky; Jeffrey full of talk and spirit.
Suddenly Bott remarked, as he accepted a light from Jeffrey's
match:&mdash;</p>
<p>You ain't got rid o' them spots yet, I see. More of 'em than
ever, ain't there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there are,&quot; replied the other carelessly.
But they'll go away, I suppose, in time. They don't hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um!&quot; grunted Jason doubtfully, scrutinising the
eruption. And, as he gazed, a sudden idea flashed into his brain
that made him thrill all over. Thursday week was it, they had said?
Well, he would see all about that, if he could only successfully
work out the scheme that had so suddenly struck him. And as he
thought it over, and it seemed more and more feasible&mdash;no risk
to himself, and the possible loss of a hated rival&mdash;he became
quite chatty and sociable over the &quot;cup of tea.&quot;</p>
<p>So, presently, ascertaining that there was no freight for the
port this trip, and the wind being fair down river, he managed to
wish the lovers good-bye and good luck, with a fair semblance of
cheerful earnestness, promising also to be punctually on hand for
the approaching ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;Rough, but I don't think there's much wrong with
him,&quot; remarked Jeffrey, as they watched the ketch's mainsail
being hoisted. &quot;Surly he always was,&quot; continued he,
&quot;and no hand with the men for'ard. Still, I'd be vexed to
think he wasn't honest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take it from me,&quot; replied Freda, with fuller insight
and the emphatic idiom of the bush-born; &quot;that fellow's no
chop. I've given him &quot;brusher&quot; often enough, and still he
keeps hangin' around like a flyin' fox after the last figs. I don't
like a hair in his head, nor the look in his eyes. Kiss me,
Jeff.&quot; And Jeffrey laughed and kissed her under the starry
blossoms of the passion vines.</p>
<p>A few days after this a steam launch, all spick and span with
brass funnel and man in uniform, and the blue ensign trailing from
its staff, made fast to Bech's wharf, whilst a grey-headed man,
stepping ashore, enquired for &quot;Watson's selection&quot; and
its owner.</p>
<p>&quot;It may not be what we fear,&quot; said the visitor when,
after a long examination, he finally came to a decision, and
Jeffrey, all white and trembling, and with great beads of sweat
standing on his forehead, put on his shirt again. &quot;But I'm
afraid, my poor lad, I must take you with me. The board will hold a
consultation when we reach town, and we'll know for certain then.
Still, I'm sure by the cut of you that you'll face the music like a
man and help me to do my most disagreeable duty. And the old
Government medical inspector, inured to suffering as he was, turned
aside as he saw the agony in his companion's face.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, for the hideous word &quot;leper&quot; had
already been flying abroad, there was a rush of flying feet up the
garden path and a tall, pale-faced girl, her long fair hair flying
and her blue eyes flashing with anger and dismay, darted into the
room, and throwing her arms around her lover's neck turned, and
with the spirit of her Viking ancestry stirring strongly in her
soul, confronted the amazed inspector.</p>
<p>&quot;Who dare say it?&quot; she gasped. &quot;My Jeff a leper?
Who's been putting him away and telling lies on him? Those spots,
is it?&quot; And she laughed as she took the hard toil-worn hands
and kissed the fatal marks. &quot;Do you hear, father, mother,
Axel, Julius?&quot; as the whole Bech family now came upon the
scene. &quot;Will you stand there and see them take him away? Oh my
God, the lies of people! And our wedding day to-morrow. Axel!
Julius! Can't you do nothing but stare?&quot;</p>
<p>The great loose-limbed young men, thus adjured, growled
threateningly and moved towards the inspector, who, stepping
outside, blew a shrill call that brought four or five men at a run
up from the launch. But ere they reached the house Jeffrey had
pulled himself together and assured the inspector of his
willingness to go with him quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said he, &quot;it's all a mistake. Don't
worry; I'll be home again tomorrow like enough. I can feel there's
nothing the matter with me. Cheer up, Freda, my girl; you know it's
no use bucking against Government.&quot;</p>
<p>But the girl refused to be comforted and wept bitterly in her
mother's arms, whilst old Herman swore deep guttural oaths in
Danish, and his sons still scowled threateningly around.</p>
<p>Cooksland, just at this time, was in the full swing of a leprosy
scare, and with the help of a recently-constituted board of health
was rapidly and indiscriminately filling a lazaret with suspected
as well as unmistakable cases. The older southern colonies had
sneered at their younger sister and said nasty things about colored
labor and a Contagious Diseases Act; called her &quot;leper
land,&quot; and threatened to cut her out of federation unless she
reformed and swept her house clean.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that, in the very nick of time, opportunity had
come to Jason Bott to play the role of secret informer; and Jeffrey
Watson, travelling cityward to Endeavour, well knew that, leper or
no leper, the chances were that he was doomed to the hideous
lazaret. The medical examination was long and critical, for the
board was humane, if somewhat uncertain in its pathology.
Eventually, by a unanimous vote, the half a dozen or so of medical
men who composed the Government Department, deeply impressed of the
gravity of the (vide southern newspapers) &quot;horror hanging over
our northern colony,&quot; and determined to take no risks,
declared the symptoms to be those of leprosy. And so, with all
kindness and sympathy, mingled with much secret individual doubt,
of which, however, he did not get the benefit, Jeffrey Watson was
consigned to a living grave, leaving his judges arguing about
hyper&aelig;mic congestion, melasmic and leucasmic blotches,
pigmentary macul&aelig;, and similar jargon of the disease. As a
matter of fact, they had failed to find any of the premonitory
symptoms of leprosy in Jeffrey that their books taught them should
have been present, such as undue sensibility of the spinal nerves,
bodily debility, or any abnormal redness of face and neck. But, on
the other hand, here and there about the trunk they had discovered
more of those irregular blotches for which they could in no wise
account or diagnose as belonging to any skin disease known to them.
So they sent the man, all full of health and vigor of life, as he
was, to the dreadful place appointed for, perhaps, the most
terribly afflicted of all God's creatures,</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>Half way down a hill covered with stunted scrub a clump of
houses faced the Pacific Ocean. Built of sun-bleached
weather-boards, roofed with galvanized iron, enclosed on three
sides by a tall fence of the same material topped with barbed wire,
such was the leper lazaret of Cooksland. Sitting there bare,
silent, cheerless, listening to the ceaseless moan of the waves
that, in foul weather or fair, smote the league-long cliffs to
right and left of the little beach. &nbsp; And here, amidst a more
terrible congregation than ever Dante could have pictured, Jeffrey
presently found himself. Dumb from very horror, he wandered midst
the rotting remnants of humanity that surrounded him. Black and
yellow, white and brown, all shades of color, and of nationalities
only guessable. Hideously masked and muffled, speechless and
helpless, some were evidently in the last stages of the fell
disease; others, to all appearances as strong as Jeffrey himself,
until a closer inspection revealed the knotted joints or
ulcer-covered flesh: others, again, seemed to have shed all their
limbs and become mere animate trunks; a few were gnarled and
twisted out of all semblance to humanity.</p>
<p>And Jeffrey's blood ran cold and his scalp bristled as he stared
and vowed to himself that he would never suffer long enough to make
one of these. The medical and nursing staff were kind and humane,
but they had seen so much of sadness and misery that Jeffrey's case
was regarded simply as one more added to the long list, and not by
any means the worst. As for the man himself, during his waking
hours he fretted his heart out with thoughts of all that he had
lost, and of the fate that seemed in store for him; whilst in his
dreams the sights of the day tortured sleep with awful nightmares.
There was an old and crazy boat belonging to the establishment, and
in this, in very fine weather, a few of the patients were allowed
to pull out and fish in Apollo Bay, so called by some hideously
ironic mischance of nomenclature.</p>
<p>One afternoon Jeffrey was asked by the resident medical officer,
with three others, to try to catch some fish. It was a lovely
summer's day, and lying in the stern-sheets Jeffrey allowed the
boat to drift towards the mouth of the bay, whilst his companions,
Ah Lee, Cubby, an aboriginal, and Billy Tanna, an Islander from one
of the northern plantations, tended the lines. As the boat
gradually travelled seaward Jeffrey, for the first time since
entering that sad settlement on the hillside, felt a sense of
relief and rest. His companions were silent, with the exception of
Billy, who chatted vigorously. But for a row of large malignant
knots right across where the eyebrows should have been, and which
gave to his features a peculiar fierce and truculent expression, he
showed little sign of disease. The Chinese, however, wore the
significant mask concealing ravages better left even unguessed at;
and a mere shred of an arm showed a clean stump at the elbow.
Cubby, the black fellow, had lost his hair, the fingers of one hand
were knotted and twisted, and his lips were hideously protuberant
with large tumors. Bad as they were, the trio were almost the pick
of the lazaret. As for Jeffrey himself, except for the dark
blotches on his hands and a patch that had recently made its
appearance on his right cheek, he was, albeit thin and haggard, in
as good bodily health as ever, a matter that rather puzzled the
authorities.</p>
<p>Billy had ceased his talk and everything was very quiet except
for the lap, lap of the water against the boat's sides, or a hoarse
exclamation when bream or &quot;leather-jacket&quot; was swung
inboard. The sky was cloudless, and the warmth of the sun tempered
by a pleasant breeze. Presently Jeffrey, worn by restless nights
and the horrors of the last few days, fell asleep. When he awoke it
was with the sound of cannon in his ears; the boat had drifted far
out and was tossing on the ocean swell, whilst to right and left
there was nothing visible but the long stretch of grey rock bound
coast fringed with white foam and broken by the one small gap that
marked Apollo Bay. Looking forward he saw that his companions slept
in a confused group of limbs and bodies.</p>
<p>Half a mile to seaward the smoke of a gun still curled around
the bows of a great warship, coming from the northward, and showing
a string of colors at her signal halliards. Further out still was a
big four masted sailer, with everything set from sky-sails to
courses. All at once, as Jeffrey gazed, he saw her yards coming
down by the run and her canvas being clewed up in frantic haste.
Then the cruiser, satisfied that her warning had been taken by the
unsuspecting stranger, steamed away into the heart of the haze that
her experienced officers knew betokened the near approach of a
&quot;southerly buster.&quot; So near, indeed, that, almost ere
Jeffrey had time to awaken his companions and get the boat's head
round, a mingled fury of rain and wind was howling about them,
lashing the sea into foam and sending their frail craft flying
before it like a straw. Luckily it had been an old whaleboat,
double ended, and with a long steer oar; thus Jeffrey managed to
keep it from broaching to, whilst the others, their first dismay
and bewilderment over, baled with might and main to empty the water
that flew over them in sheets.</p>
<p>Like an arrow they shot past the merchantman, lying over to the
fierce squalls with her topsailyards on their caps and some of her
kites in ribbons; yet, thanks to the watchful warship, saved from
further disaster.</p>
<p>For two hours they sped along over a yeasty, milk-white sea,
kept comparatively calm by the terrific force of the wind, and
then, just as the sun set, the &quot;buster&quot; blew itself out,
and the sea got up in such wise that Jeffrey expected each moment
to feel the boat fill and sink. But he experienced no fear, rather
joy, indeed, at the prospect of thus having an end put to his
misery through no effort of his own. And as the salt spray blew in
his face, and the racing combers hove the boat up and tossed it
from one to another, he felt only fierce exultation in that wild
play of wind and wave to which he had for years been a
stranger.</p>
<p>Ah Lee and Cubby, however, their burst of startled energy
passed, crouched moaning in the bottom of the boat, as scared and
trembling at the approach of Death as if they had not been for long
well within his gates. But Billy Tanna, with his fierce leonine
face and great gleaming teeth shining in an ecstatic grin, seemed,
like Jeffrey, perfectly to exult in the situation; and he it was
who, when the wind suddenly shifted to the westward, helped to rig
the long steer-oar as a mast, with which and a piece of ragged
tarpaulin for a sail, they drove out into the wide Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;May as well keep going as long as we can, I suppose,
Billy?&quot; said Jeffrey.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet, Boss,&quot; replied Tanna, showing his teeth
still more. &quot;Go down, Davy Jones; go to hell, but no go back
to that&mdash;hole yonder,&quot; which, rudely translated, were
Jeffrey's own sentiments.</p>
<p>And presently, Billy, relieving his companion at the steer-oar,
struck up one of his island chants:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">Singi anga, singi anga,<br>
Ra mula mula<br>
Na malare ea<br>
Lee ah lay ah.</p>
<p>Which Jeffrey, recognising the well-known chorus, joined in
heartily as he baled, whilst the boat tossed along, now deep down
between cavernous walls of water, now tumbling on sparkling moonlit
crests.</p>
<p>The colonial barque &quot;Omeo,&quot; bound from Raipara (N.Z.)
to Waratah (N.C.), lay becalmed some 80 miles off the land. She was
laden deep with hardwood logs and sawn stuff, so deep, indeed, as
to show hardly more side than a Thames barge coming up awash with
hay from Kentish farms. It was, however, summer time and a run of
1,000 miles or so across the top of the Tasman Sea had been a mere
picnic. But the calm was aggravating, and the skipper, glancing at
the listless canvas, audibly cursed the weather, and then went
below and turned in, leaving the mate on deck. It was well on in
the middle watch and still no sign of a change. The mate dosed
uneasily on the skylight; the man at the wheel sat on the spindle
and nodded. The crew snored around in shadowy comers out of the
moonlight, and the &quot;Omeo,&quot; swaying drowsily with a soft
rustling of cloths, seemed herself to be falling asleep. Presently
a black spot appeared on the moonlit water; gradually it approached
the slumbering vessel, resolving itself as it did so into a boat,
with a man sculling softly, and the figures of others intently
gazing at the barque. Noiselessly gliding alongside, one of the men
caught the old-fashioned main chains and sprung into them, followed
by another and another, and, more slowly, by a fourth. There was
plenty of room for them all. Then the man who held the painter let
it slide into the water, and, reaching down, gave the boat a
vigorous shove with his foot that sent it into the shadows astern.
Then, as the barque awoke for a minute and banged her canvas and
rattled all her blocks and gear, the four climbed slowly over the
rail and made as by instinct to where stood a scuttle-butt full of
water, from whose dipper they drank greedily and thirstily, passing
it from hand to hand in rotation.</p>
<p>&quot;That's good!&quot; exclaimed Jeffrey at last. &quot;Two
days on raw fish and a thunder storm's none too
satisfying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, you chaps!&quot; suddenly remarked a sleepy
voice. &quot;Go easy on that water. One'd think by the way you're
swilling it that a No. 1 condenser was kept goin' all day long for
the benefit of shellbacks,&quot; and the speaker, walking up to the
group, standing in the full light of the moon, the next instant
started back with a loud shout of horror and amazement as his gaze
took in the wild, fierce features of Tanna; the black visage of
Cubby, who had lost his hat and whose leprous lips showed monstrous
in the salt-encrusted face running back to the scarred and hairless
skull, whilst Ah Lee's naked stump quivered with excitement, and
through his mask gleamed eyes beady and black as a snake's.</p>
<p>No wonder the man, appalled, ran aft in terror, and awoke the
ship with yell upon yell, mingled with calls down the companion to
the captain that devils had come on board and taken possession of
the vessel.</p>
<p>By this time the crew were on the scene and proved every bit as
scared as the mate, rushing back upon each other when one of the
unfortunates made the slightest move towards them, whilst one, a
Spaniard, fervently called upon all the saints he could think of
and invoked them in a loud voice to exorcise these evil spirits.
Luckily the captain was a shrewd, hard-headed Scot; and after a few
words with Jeffrey explained matters to his men. But, if possible,
with the result of only making bad worse. Superstition departed,
bodily fear came in. Nor, in this respect of contagion, was the
captain altogether easy in his mind. Still, he was humane, and
ordered the cook to at once prepare a meal for his unwelcome
guests, which that official, however, as promptly refused to do.
Where upon the skipper fed the four from his private stores, the
crew looking on at a safe distance. Nothing could convince them
that the terrible disease was not communicable by the slightest
contact; and they one and all resolutely refused to work the ship
whilst such terrific object lessons remained on board.</p>
<p>&quot;This'll never do, captain,&quot; said Jeffrey at last.
&quot;Give us a boat and let us go. Our own was leaking and rotten,
or we wouldn't have sent her adrift. Nor we wouldn't have served
you the trick we did, only we knew that if you saw us it 'ud be all
up with any chance of getting taken off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fancy you're no' far wrong there,&quot; replied the
skipper grimly, as he glanced at his terrified crew, perched, some
of them, in the rigging, others as far forward as they could get.
Then he began to consider. His long boat was old; he had, indeed,
meant to replace her by a &quot;new secondhand&quot; one last
voyage. Now was an off-chance of obtaining a first-class article at
Government expense, in addition to a bill for rations with 50 per
cent added. True, the Cooksland Government might repudiate all
responsibility; or Jeffrey's story might be a fabrication. But,
judging from his face, he thought not. And, in any case, he did not
stand to lose very much&mdash;perhaps &pound;5 at the outside. And
there was, of course, always&mdash;if the worst happened&mdash;the
credit account in the next world to be considered.</p>
<p>So the skipper cogitated. And, presently, making up his mind,
the long boat was joyfully swung out by the crew. Provisions, the
water cask, out of which the lepers had already drunk, and, in
addition to the boat's furniture of masts, sail, &amp;c., a compass
was put in her. Then Jeffrey signed a document setting forth in
detail the facts of the case, and intimating that through the
generosity of Captain Mackenzie he and his companions were now in a
state to make their way back again.</p>
<p>And now everything being ready, the Chinese and Cubby resolutely
refused to stir a peg. They had had enough of the ocean wave.
&quot;Mine no go along damn feller canoe no more,&quot; remarked
Cubby firmly, whilst Ah Lee whimpered and moaned and made
lamentable outcries, when, having at last, after a hard struggle,
got Cubby into the boat, and left him there guarded by Jeffrey,
Tanna dragged the Chinese to the rail, lowered him over, and then
jumping in himself shoved off.</p>
<p>There were a few airs wandering about on the water and the sun
was just rising as Jeffrey and his mate hoisted their sail. All at
once they heard shouts from the barque. Looking back, they saw a
line of pale, threatening faces and pointing hands along her
bulwarks; saw also two spots, black on the purple water, swimming
deeply towards the Omeo&mdash;now a couple of hundred yards
distant. Ah Lee and Cubby, taking advantage of the bustle and
sail-setting, were making a desperate endeavor to regain the
barque, heedless of the curses and warnings of her crew to keep
away.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!&quot; grunted Tanna suddenly, pointing
to a big fin that passed them cutting the water like a knife and
raising a miniature bow wave as it dashed along. Another minute and
it seemed to the horrified spectators that at least a dozen sharks
were tearing and plunging at their victims in a swirl of foam and
blood. Jeffrey sank back sick at heart and even the big Islander
turned green as he stared; whilst the barque, swinging her yards to
the freshening breeze and setting her light sails, made off on her
course as if impatient to leave such an ill-omened spot.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>It seemed lonely at first without the sufferers, useless as they
were; then succeeded in both the survivors' minds a feeling of
relief at being spared the constant sight of the poor cripples,
passively suffering an existence of coma diversified only by
intervals of acute pain: Tanna, &nbsp; at least had the unimpaired
use of his limbs and his great bodily strength bid fair to resist
the progress of the disease for years. Moreover, as an old whaler,
he was a good sailorman.</p>
<p>Jeffrey's heart as the days passed, and they kept still sailing
north-about, ached for a sight of Freda and that patch of fruity
greenness on the slope of the Altioras that he had once called
home. But he knew that, barring almost a miracle, he would never
see either of them again. Only too acutely he realised that he had
become absolutely a hopeless pariah and an outcast once putting on
the suit of coarse drill stencilled with the fatal letters,
&quot;A.B.L.C.,&quot; standing for &quot;Apollo Bay Lazaret,
Cooksland.&quot; And at times he groaned in agony of spirit as he
thought on the long loveless life he was doomed to lead, perhaps on
some savage island. Nor did he derive much comfort from Tanna's
diagnosis. &quot;You not got 'im, Boss. Doctors fools. I got 'im
all right, 'cos mother and father had 'im afore I born. But where
we go, along my country, people not care. Don't you be 'fraid catch
'im. All gammon those doctors.&quot; So they sailed along towards
Oceana, favored by light breezes and pleasant seas; Jeffrey with
evergreen grief at his heart; Tanna jubilant at thoughts of the
island life once more.</p>
<p>Then one calm, starless night, abreast, but well away from the
Great Barrier, Tanna snoring forward and Jeffrey dreaming aft, a
horrid nightmare of leper sharks with rotting tails and jaws, their
bodies covered with great sores that glowed in the darkness as they
tried to get into the boat, there was a sudden rending shock, and
both men were flung headlong into the water. Rising, they saw a
great mass close to them, heard bells ringing, steam hissing and
roaring, some hoarse foreign words of command, and in a few minutes
more were being hauled into a boat and presently handed without any
ceremony on board the vessel that had run into them.</p>
<p>She proved to be the German cruiser &quot;Kaiserin,&quot; from
Port Solander, for a trip around the Islands to see if she could
pick up any unconsidered trifles in the way of bits of land not as
yet colored British red on the map. Hitting their boat amidships
with her sharp curved stem, the warship had cut it clean in two and
abruptly ended their cruise.</p>
<p>The stolid Germans stared curiously at Tanna, but showed none of
the fear and repulsion that the &quot;Omeo's&quot; men had done.
Nay, there was one on board who welcomed him with every
demonstration of interest, almost of affection.</p>
<p>&quot;Never haf I zeen,&quot; said Dr. von Rosbach, the
world-renowned pathologist and guest for the time being of his
brother, the captain of the &quot;Kaiserin,&quot; &quot;such a
berfect sbecimen of ze elephandiasis leondina, no nod even in
Molokai idself. Id is sblendid!&quot; he exclaimed
enthusiastically; for he had made leprosy in its every stage, and
form the special study of a lifetime, and in connection with the
disease his verdict was the accepted law regarded by the profession
as final.</p>
<p>&quot;I vill keep him under observation,&quot; he continued,
rubbing his hands joyfully, &quot;und gomblete my monograph on dat
sbecial variedy.&quot;</p>
<p>So Tanna, rigged out in a petty officer's uniform, resplendent
with silver buttons, lived on the fat of the ship, swallowed more
or less nauseous drugs as a set off, and was continually under the
eye of the great scientist, who, at first, so absorbed was he with
his prize, took no notice of Jeffrey.</p>
<p>But one day an officer repeating his story circumstantially to
von Rosbach, the doctor sent for and examined him, hoping, perhaps,
to find still a new variety. Presently he exclaimed in a
disappointed tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;You a lebber! you never vos und never vill be. Put your
clothes on, my good mans, und go your vays. Dem sbods,&quot; he
continued in a kinder voice, seeing the great and joyful light that
leapt shining to his hearer's eyes, &quot;dem sbods. Bah! your
doctor-volk over yonder are tam fools if dey gall you lebber! Ach
gott! dey know nod ze mild pzoriazis ven dey zee id! Gome to me
bresendly und I vill dake your sbods avay like vinkin-von&mdash;no,
dwo veeks you vas glean as a liddle babee.&quot;</p>
<p>And there was such utter certainty in the disdainful words of
this old man with the great mane of grey hair and the keen, hard,
blue eyes, that Jeffrey, convinced, left his presence with the
feeling that he had been born anew into the world and with a look
on his face that made the German sailors turn and stare at him as
he passed them.</p>
<p>After a visit to the Bismarcks the &quot;Kaiserin&quot; came
down to Tanna, by which time the doctor had made good his promise
to Jeffrey and given him some simple directions that should keep
him clean for the rest of his life. But at Port Resolution, much to
von Rosbach's disgust, his other patient vanished, evading all
pursuit. One day, however, Jeffrey, being ashore and walking
through some thick scrub, met a tall native as naked, but for a
well-filled cartridge-belt, as the day he was born. His face was
fantastically painted red-and-yellow, whilst his hair most
elaborately dressed and plaited chignon fashion supported a great
plume of cock's feathers. He carried a Snider rifle and stood
grinning hugely. And not till Jeffrey looked close did he recognise
Tanna.</p>
<p>&quot;You all right now, boss?&quot; asked his friend, the first
greetings over.</p>
<p>&quot;So the doctor says,&quot; replied the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh,&quot; said Tanna, making a wry face, &quot;smart
feller, ole doctor; you bet he know. Not like other damn feller,
back yonder. But med'cin' rotten&mdash;make belly sick. Well, so
long, boss. I hear sailorman comin' along track.&quot; And Tanna
with a farewell grasp of the hand dived into the thick scrub and
disappeared forever, so far as Jeffrey was concerned, just as one
of the doctor's search parties came up.</p>
<p>Presently the &quot;Kaiserin&quot; sailed for Port Endeavor to
be docked. And there von Rosbach&mdash;who had taken a fancy to
Jeffrey and much interest in the tragedy that through no fault of
his had come into his life&mdash;went with him to the board of
health and treated its members to something very like a severe
scolding. And he concluded by forcibly pointing out that, but for
the merest accident, with them would have lain the responsibility
of causelessly and cruelly ruining the life of a perfectly sound
and healthy man. The doctors squirmed as they listened. But von
Rosbach's reputation was too big to stand argument; and, besides,
they were all desperately afraid of the affair getting into the
newspapers and becoming public property. So they took their
gruelling quietly. They were nearly all young men, products of the
local university, with nothing much above an M.B.Ch.M. amongst
them. But they had sense enough to know that they had good
Government billets; and, from the president down, where desirous of
still keeping in touch with the Cooksland Treasury&mdash;just then
overflowing from sales of Crown lands.</p>
<p>Thus, presently, on Jeffrey's promise that, so far as he was
concerned, the matter should remain a secret, the president handed
him a cheque for &pound;150 as some reparation for the error by
which he had suffered. It was mentioned, too, that a certain
Captain Mackenzie had been paid &pound;60 from the board's funds
for having furnished a party of castaway lepers with a nearly new
boat and much provision. As to the fate of poor Cubby and Ah Lee,
however, the worthy captain had, it seemed, observed a discreet
silence.</p>
<p>An anonymous letter, it appeared, had been the means of setting
the authorities on Jeffrey's track. And Jeffrey's hands, as he
listened, itched to get a good grip of Jason Bott. Once more the
natty steam launch, with her bright brass funnel and blue ensign
trailing astern, went up the Lillypilly taking Jeffrey to his home;
but this time in some sort of triumph. With him went the German
doctor, two members of the board of health, and some of the
officers of the Kaiserin. And, presently, there was such a meeting
between the lovers as almost made amends for that sad parting so
many dreary weeks ago. One of Jeffrey's first enquiries was for
Jason Bott. But he had disappeared from the river after a heavy
thrashing received at the hands of Julius and Axel Bech for
annoying their sister with his attentions. The wedding of Jeffrey
and Freda took place the next day, under, so to speak, Imperial and
governmental auspices. And the old doctor, as he pledged the bride
and bridegroom in a foaming tankard of lager, said, turning to
Jeffrey, &quot;Mein young vriend, you haf zome bad eggsberience
bassed troo. Let zen go as a vicket dream, und look only vorwarts,
vorwarts, und dink of your good lok to gome back again to your
beautiful frau. Prosit!&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was long ere Jeffrey ceased to a wake suddenly
in the silent night watches, trembling and wet from ghastly dreams
of muffled and mutilated creatures sailing with him on lonely seas
through shoals of expectant sharks.</p>
