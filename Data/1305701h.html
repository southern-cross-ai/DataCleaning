<h2>The Nuptials of Corbigny<br>

Rafael Sabatini</h2>

<i>Chauvinière</i> by G. Patrick Nelson</p>
<hr>
<p class="letter">In adverse circumstances, Rafael Sabatini wrote a
very short novel, The Nuptials of Corbal, to fulfill his commission
from a magazine. But McCall's found it far too long for a single
instalment and didn't wish to run it as a serial. This story is the
cut-down version of that novel. The clinching clue to the fact that
this was so, and that it was not the novel (published later) which
was expanded from the story, comes in the second section, during
Dumey's reflections. According to the story, the heroine is taken
directly from the Conciergerie to Dumey's. In the novel she is
taken first to a madhouse in the Archevêché. That reference should
have been cut out but remained! Sabatini had yet to give his
publishers the novel they expected every year. Adversity unabated,
he could only offer the original short novel, which was lavishly
illustrated to cover its paucity of text.</p>
<p class="letter">A trivial note: The heroine's eyes, twice
described as blue-green, become gray-green later!</p>
<p class="letter2">&mdash;Ruth Heredia</p>
<hr>
<p>SHADOWS moved behind the broad lattice that formed the upper
part of the heavy wooden doors at the gallery's end. Those nearest,
observing this and knowing what it portended, caught their breath.
From these, apprehension rippled over the groups assembled in that
long narrow avenue of doom, striking them into silence.</p>
<p>Upon that silence the rasping of a key in its lock rang like a
pistol shot. One of the wings of the great heavy door swung
inwards, and the turnkey entered, brawny and swarthy, his blue
shirt gaping away from a broad hairy chest, a fur bonnet on his
cropped head, a yellow bloodhound at his heels. He stood aside on
the platform at the head of the steps, to give passage to a slim
young gentleman in a tight black frock and a round black hat
adorned by a buckle in front and a cockade at the side. A paper in
his hand drew the eyes--some scared, some apathetic, some proudly
indifferent, and some defiantly scornful--of the hundred men and
women assembled there for the daily purpose of hearing that paper's
contents. For this slim young gentleman, Robert Wolf, clerk of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, was the adjutant of the Public Accuser. His
paper bore the list over whose preparation Fouquier-Tinville had
laboured half the night.</p>
<p>The Citizen Wolf stepped briskly to the edge of the platform, to
read the names of those whom Fouquier-Tinville summoned that
morning to judgment: "the baker's batch," as it was called in the
cynical jargon of the day!</p>
<p>Having chosen his position, the clerk waited until three men who
followed him should have come to a standstill. Not on that account
did they hurry themselves. Two of them, men of middle age, both
dressed in black, one tall and portly the other short and wizened,
took their time deferentially from another who, walking a little in
advance, appeared to conduct them.</p>
<p>This was Chauvinière, the Nivernais deputy, tall, slim, not over
thirty, of a certain vigorous elegance. He wore a riding-coat with
broad lapels and silver buttons, the tails of which reached almost
to the heels of his Hessian boots. Spotless buckskins cased his
long, lean legs so closely that every muscle was defined, and a
cravat of spotless white clothed his neck to the chin. He was girt
by a tricolour sash, and a tricolour cockade adorned his grey hat,
which was cocked in front, à la Henri IV, and surmounted by a
<i>panache</i> of black plumes. Thus were advertised his office and
his <i>sansculottism</i> which latter stood too high, had been too
fully proven, to be shaken by any gibes at his apparel, whilst his
arrogance, audacity and self-assurance were proof against vulgar
criticism. Those qualities were to be read in his lean, sallow
countenance with its high-bridged nose, its curled upper lip and
its keen light eyes under their level black brows. There was a
certain raffishness in his air that proclaimed him half-gentleman,
half-valet; half-wolf, half-fox.</p>
<p>With a leisureliness that took no account either of the waiting
clerk or of the agonized suspense and the pounding of a hundred
hearts in that assembly, Chauvinière selected his point of vantage,
at a little distance from Robert Wolf, and descended the first
step, so that his two companions in black immediately behind him
obtained, from the summit of the platform, a clear view over his
head.</p>
<p>His keen eyes raked the gallery and the men and women in that
throng, most of whom were so scrupulously dressed that, saving for
the absence of powder from their heads, they might have been
gathered together for a lévee. This was a daily miracle performed
upon slender enough resources by the prisoners in the
Conciergerie.</p>
<p>The deputy's questing glance came at last to rest upon
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, standing slim and straight, beside the
chair into which her mother had nervelessly collapsed. Incredibly
fearless and resolute she stood, with scarcely loss of colour to
her lovely face. But the blue-green eyes dilated a little and
flickered as they met the deputy's. Her slight bosom moved
perceptibly under its crossed muslin fichu, to betray a sudden
agitation which not even the advent of the list had been able to
arouse.</p>
<p>Chauvinière half-turned to the men in black behind him. He said
something in a low voice into an obsequiously lowered ear, and with
his silver-mounted cane he deliberately pointed. Three pairs of
eyes followed the direction of the pointing, and Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier stiffened under that volley of glances whose purport
she was far from guessing but which instinctively she felt to bode
no good.</p>
<p>Then the pointing cane was lowered, and the three men ranged
themselves decorously, as Robert Wolf began to call the names of
the doomed. His voice droned emotionlessly. Like Fouquier-Tinville
himself, he was simply a part of the great revolutionary machine.
There was no personal responsibility in what he did, and it was not
for him to indulge feelings and emotions over actions that were not
his own. To answer each summons there would be now a gasp, now a
sob of terror, occasionally an outcry of hysterical panic quickly
sinking into shuddering sobs from the victim chosen.</p>
<p>The voice droned on implacably, but as sweetly as if it had been
the hum of bees making honey:</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Marquis de La Tourette."</p>
<p>The Marquis, middle-aged, exquisite in a blue coat with silver
lace, threw up his head--the handsome head that so soon would leave
his shoulders--and sharply caught his breath. In an instant he
recovered. He remembered what was due to his blood and his
self-respect. He shrugged and smiled in deprecation, for all that
his face was the colour of chalk.</p>
<p>"It will break the monotony," he said softly to a neighbour, as
the next name was being called.</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Comtesse de Montsorbier."</p>
<p>Madame de Montsorbier, a slender little woman of fifty,
half-rose from her chair, beginning an inarticulate cry on which
she seemed to choke. But her knees were loosened, and she sank down
again, leaning sideways against her daughter. Mademoiselle de
Montsorbier, rigid now and piteously white, set protecting arms
about her half-swooning mother, and waited to hear her own name,
almost hoped to hear it, in her selfless anxiety. All that she
realized was that in her agony, the frail woman who had borne her
would require her as she had never required her yet. Solicitude for
her mother effaced all consideration of her own fate. That was the
mettle of Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, and her deepest dismay was
not reached until the list had come to an end without her own name
having been pronounced by that monotonous voice.</p>
<p>Two gendarmes, coming she knew not whence, surged suddenly
before her.</p>
<p>"The ci-devant Montsorbier," said one of them, and set a hand
upon the drooping shoulder of Madame.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier turned to him, unable to marshal her
tumultuous thoughts into coherent expression. "But it is my mother!
There is some error. She cannot go without me. You see how feeble
she is. My name has not been called. It is an omission. You see
that it is an omission. You will tell them that it is an omission.
You will let me go with her."</p>
<p>Thus, in a confused torrent, the phrases tumbled from her
lips.</p>
<p>The man looked at her sullenly, dubiously, his nether lip
projected. He shook his head. "Not our affair." He shook the
Countess who was not more than half-conscious. "You are to come
along, citoyenne."</p>
<p>"But I may go with her? I may go with her?"</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! What's your hurry to sneeze into the basket? Your turn
will come soon enough, citoyenne. Lend a hand, Gaston."</p>
<p>Between them, the two men dragged the Countess to her feet, and
half-carried, half-led her away. The girl sprang after them.</p>
<p>"I may come, too; may I not? I may..."</p>
<p>A blow from the elbow of one of the guards cut short her breath,
and sent her hurtling backwards. "Faith! You make yourself a
nuisance, my girl!"</p>
<p>She reeled to the wooden chair the Countess had vacated.</p>
<p>"Mother!" she gasped aloud, "Mother!"</p>
<p>White-faced she sat, in stony tearless grief, her long fine
hands clutched between her knees.</p>
<p>Just so, a month ago, had her father been rent from them, to
take his trial; and hers it had been since then to comfort and
sustain her mother. Now her mother, too, was gone!</p>
<p>Why had she been left? A voice was speaking at her elbow, a
crisp, level voice, not unpleasant, although pitched in a tone
almost ironical.</p>
<p>"This is the young woman who claims your attention, citizens.
You observe her listlessness, her unnatural pallor, the vacancy of
her stare. Perform your office. It is not for me to direct you, or
even to suggest; but for you to judge."</p>
<p>She swung half-round, looking up, challenge, defiance, alarm all
blending in her glance, like some trapped wild creature. She met
the light eyes of Chauvinière, piercing, mocking eyes which she had
grown to hate, and even to fear, she who had never feared anything
in all her proud young life. A half-dozen times in the last three
weeks had she found those eyes upon her in a questing, measuring,
soullessly appraising glance, which had scorched her from head to
foot. Twice already had he found occasion to speak to her as he
passed through the prisoners' gallery on a visit which appeared to
have no other object but that of addressing her. Each time she had
commanded herself so as to dissemble from him her resentment at the
insult which his look and word conveyed. She would command herself
now. He should never guess her fear of him, this dishonouring fear
for which she loathed herself.</p>
<p>The two men in black were gravely considering her, the taller
one extended a plump hand, and took her wrist.</p>
<p>"Your pulse, citoyenne."</p>
<p>"My pulse?" she heard herself questioning in a distant voice,
and knew by the drumming of her temples that her pulses galloped in
that moment. Then above considerations of herself rose the
momentarily whelmed memory of her bereavement. "You,
Monsieur...Citizen, Citizen-deputy! They have taken Madame my
mother, and by an omission I have been left. Give orders, monsieur,
I implore you, that my name be added to the list of the day..."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Chauvinière, with so singular an emphasis that it
arrested her intercession. He looked at the men in black with a
significant lift of his black brows. "You hear her,
citizen-doctors! Is that the request of a young woman who is sane?
To desire--to implore--death at that age, when life unfolds itself
like a perfumed rose, when the blood runs warm and clear, is a
sufficient confirmation of what already I suspected. But"--and
again there was that flash of mockery from those light eyes--"it is
not for me to influence your decision. You must form judgment for
yourselves. Proceed!" He waved a hand, a hand that was long and
slender as an aristocrat's and as graceful in its gesture which
subtly blended invitation with command.</p>
<p>The doctors sighed and grunted. "For my own part," said the
shorter one, "I do not like her eyes. That wild, hunted look, that
expression of distraction...hem! Hem!"</p>
<p>"And then her pallor," put in the other. "Most unnatural! And
this pulse!"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," said the deputy's voice, and it was cold
as ice, or--thought the little doctor--cold as the knife of the
guillotine: "It is for you to form the opinion. But you will
remember that I brought you here because I have upon other
occasions witnessed these same traits in the citoyenne, when no
external cause could be discerned such as may have arisen now."</p>
<p>The little doctor clutched at salvation. "Ah, but that is
decisive," he exclaimed with complete conviction of tone. "If these
symptoms--this pulse, this pallor, these twitchings, this glassy
stare and...and the rest--have been manifest constantly and without
adequate cause, one conclusion only is possible. At least," he
added with a glance at his colleague, "that is my opinion."</p>
<p>"And mine," said the other sharply. "Emphatically, mine!"</p>
<p>Chauvinière's lips twitched. "It is gratifying, citizen-doctors,
for a layman to find his scientific suspicions confirmed by men of
science. You will, then, certify the citoyenne, so that the Public
Accuser may authorize her removal say to the madhouse in the Rue du
Bac."</p>
<p>He inclined his head in dismissal, haughty as a prince of the
old régime. The deputy's commanding hand waved them away. Then his
eyes swung to the girl's face. She was on her feet confronting him,
appearing to be entirely fearless.</p>
<p>"Is it pretended that I am mad?" Her question was a
challenge.</p>
<p>He smiled a little. "Must you quarrel with a pretence which will
give you life, which will snatch you from under the knife of the
guillotine? If you do, and at your age, then you are as mad as they
who are about to certify you."</p>
<p>"But why," she asked quietly, "should you desire to serve
me?"</p>
<p>A smile momentarily softened his saturnine countenance. "I do
not believe a man has lived since the world began who did not at
some time desire to serve one woman," he said meaningly.</p>
<p>The traditions in which she had been reared rendered this an
insult in her eyes. She let him perceive it in her sudden
stiffening, the up-tilting of her chin, the frown above her
blue-green eyes and the angry flush that stained her delicately
tinted face.</p>
<p>"You forget your place, sir," she told him, speaking as to an
impertinent groom. "You presume."</p>
<p>If it stung him, he betrayed no hurt. His gentle smile grew even
gentler, sadder. It was within his considerable psychological
knowledge that he who would gain empire over a woman must begin by
making himself her slave.</p>
<p>"Presume? Is it presumption to state a historical truth? Do I
ask for anything? Do I demand wages for the service I proffer? I am
at your command, citoyenne, to save your life, because the desire
to serve you, without guerdon or hope of guerdon, is stronger than
myself. Is that to presume?"</p>
<p>"No, monsieur. It is to be incredible."</p>
<p>"Incredible, yes," he agreed at last. "I have often been
accounted that. But we waste time, citoyenne. Listen, and
afterwards resolve yourself. Mistrust me, and remain to be
presently guillotined; or trust me, and let me lead you back to
life. That shall be as you please. I offer; but I do not persuade.
Listen now."</p>
<p>Swiftly, briefly he traced for her the course of events to come.
Her removal to the madhouse would take place in the course of the
next day. As soon as it was effected, he would depart for the
Nivernais, being already commissioned by the Convention to
undertake there a tour of inspection. His passports were ready, and
they included a non-existent secretary. That was the place that she
should fill, if she so decided, suitably dressed in man's attire
for the purpose. Let her take time for thought, and let him know
to-morrow, when he sought the house in the Rue du Bac, how she
decided. He hoped that she would choose wisely. In the Nivernais
she would be free to go her ways, and no doubt would know how to
find shelter in her native province and perhaps procure assistance
to enable her to quit France should she so desire it. "We are
Nivernais both," he ended by reminding her. "Perhaps it is
compatriotism that strengthens my interest in you." He flashed a
quick glance at the door, then, at last, swept off his hat, and
bowed low. "My homage, citoyenne."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>DUMEY, the middle-aged physician who controlled the madhouse in
the Rue du Bac, received a visit late in the afternoon of the
following day from the Deputy Chauvinière. The deputy came in a
travelling chaise, from which he removed a valise together with
himself.</p>
<p>This he set down in the doctor's private room. He came straight
to business in his peremptory, overbearing fashion.</p>
<p>"Among the demented prisoners entrusted to your care this
morning is a ci-devant, a Citoyenne de Montsorbier."</p>
<p>"Ah yes!" The plump doctor's countenance became eager. "Her
case...Her case is one I have..."</p>
<p>"Never mind her case. She is dead."</p>
<p>"Dead!" Dumey looked thunderstricken.</p>
<p>"Isn't that why you have sent for me?"</p>
<p>"Sent for you? But I didn't send for you."</p>
<p>"You are losing your memory, Dumey. Fortunately for both of us,
I am not. You sent for me to assure myself of the decease, and
countersign the death-certificate which you are about to sign. My
own signature will be witnessed by my secretary. He will appear
presently. Now, pray conduct me to view the body."</p>
<p>Dumey looked at his visitor long and hard. There was that
between them, on the subject of which a word from Chauvinière would
send Dumey's head rolling into Samson's basket: which was precisely
why, of all the madhouses in Paris, Chauvinière had chosen this
establishment in the Rue du Bac for the reception of the patients
removed from the Archevêché. Against this danger on the one hand,
Dumey had to set, on the other, favours received from the deputy,
and no doubt to be continued, one of which, indeed, was the present
filling of his house and consequently of his pockets. On both
scores, whatever Chauvinière commanded, Dumey must perform.</p>
<p>Dumey smiled at last his understanding and shrugged his
resignation. "The responsibility..." he was beginning timidly.</p>
<p>"Will be mine, since I countersign your certificate. Hold your
tongue, and no question will arise. There will be no questions
about any inmates for a month. When they come, present your
certificate. It will be too long after the event to admit of
traces."</p>
<p>Dumey bowed, and conducted him. When he had unlocked the door of
a room above-stairs, he would have led the way in, but the deputy
arrested him.</p>
<p>"Go wait below in your room. You will the more easily forswear
yourself if you do not see your patient again alive."</p>
<p>"But I shall have to see her. I..."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken. You will not. Go. Don't waste my time."</p>
<p>Dumey departed. Chauvinière entered the room, carrying the
valise.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier, forewarned of his presence by his
voice was standing to receive him. He bowed deferentially, and this
time he was so unrepublican as to remove his hat. Then he placed
the valise on the table.</p>
<p>"You have resolved, citoyenne?" He had no doubt, this
psychologist, that time and thought must have brought a person of
her age to one conclusion only. It is very difficult to die
willingly at twenty.</p>
<p>"I have resolved, monsieur," she answered him with quiet
dignity.</p>
<p>He smiled as if he read her thought. "And you have resolved to
live," he said. "That is very wise."</p>
<p>"I haven't said so." His penetration alarmed her a little.</p>
<p>"No? I assumed it from your calm, from the absence of defiance
in your reception of me. It would desolate me to learn I am
mistaken."</p>
<p>"Mons...Citizen, if I have mis-judged you, I hope that you will
have the generosity to forgive me. I...I hesitate to express myself
upon your...your concern, your kindliness."</p>
<p>"Continue to hesitate. Expressions waste time, and we have none
to spare." He threw open the valise. "Here, citoyenne, are the
garments in which you will travel." He drew some of them forth. She
recoiled, her face on fire.</p>
<p>"These! These! Impossible!"</p>
<p>"A little difficult, perhaps. But I trust the difficulty will be
overcome. If you will study them, the mystery of how they should be
donned and worn will gradually vanish."</p>
<p>"That! But that is not the difficulty. You misunderstand me
purposely."</p>
<p>"In the hope of making you perceive the absurdity of your
qualms. My secretary cannot travel in a striped petticoat, and you
will find these breeches...but there! We have no time to lose. I
efface myself that you may make haste. When you are ready you will
find me in the corridor."</p>
<p>A half-hour or so later, by when the deputy was in a ferment of
impatience, a stripling figure, in round hat, black riding-coat,
boots and breeches emerged from the lady's room. A moment
Chauvinière detained her, to scrutinize her with an eye that missed
no detail. Thus dressed she looked shorter by some inches, but her
figure was well enough, and the queue of her hair had been cleverly
contrived. He hurried her below. Dumey awaited them, his
certificate prepared. That business over, the Deputy Chauvinière
with his secretary closely following, entered the waiting
chaise.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>DURING the two succeeding days, they travelled at a furious
rate, and with but short halts for food and rest and change of
horses, so that before nightfall of the second day they came to
rest at Chatillon-sur-Laing, a village of the Orléanais. Each night
Chauvinière observed a deference that was almost exaggerated. He
saw to it that she had comfortable quarters quite to herself, where
she need fear no lack of privacy. He talked glibly and
entertainingly, displaying, as it were, all the jewels of his mind
to dazzle and beglamour her. She thawed a little. Indeed it was
impossible to remain frozen in aloofness under the glow of so much
benignity. Yet once or twice, looking up suddenly, she caught his
eyes upon her. They shifted instantly, and the wolfish expression
she surprised upon his face, was as instantly covered as if by a
mask. But memory of it remained to evoke a sudden ineffable
dread.</p>
<p>He drank perhaps too much that evening, and in consequence
slackened a little the reins of his self-control. For in holding
the door for her departure and in wishing her good-night, the leer
on his face and the evil glow of his eyes were unmistakable. Such
was the fear they roused in her, that having locked and bolted her
door, she flung herself fully dressed upon her bed, to sleep at
last the light, uneasy sleep of one whose mind is vigilant. Yet
nothing happened to justify her tremors of spirit, and when she
came to breakfast she found herself awaited by a Representative so
correct and formal in his manner that she asked herself whether her
imagination had not tricked her on the previous night.</p>
<p>All day that question abode with her, whilst the chaise swayed
and rocked in its headlong speed, and Chauvinière half-dozed in his
corner with a disregard of her that was almost ungallant. It was
still with her when at five o'clock in the afternoon within a
half-mile of La Charité, a village on the Loire, their journey came
to a sudden lurching end as the result of the loss of an axle-pin,
which but for the post-boy's quick perception might have more
serious consequences.</p>
<p>Chauvinière climbed down, swearing savagely. It had been his
purpose to reach Nevers that night, to address a meeting of the
Committee of Public Safety and so to plan that upon the morrow he
might set out upon his survey. That plan he must now abandon, and
accept such a kennel as La Charité could offer his Republican
sybaritism.</p>
<p>Yet when they had tramped the half-mile of muddy road to the
village, they found there an excellent inn, where they were given a
good room above-stairs in which to sup, with a bedroom opening from
each side of it. Within an hour of their arrival an unusually good
supper was placed before them by the vintner and his comely wife,
who did not spare themselves in the service of the great man from
Paris by whom their poor house was honoured.</p>
<p>Over the well-larded capon Chauvinière expressed himself to his
secretary.</p>
<p>"By this I should judge that there is a good deal of aristocracy
surviving in this Nivernais of yours."</p>
<p>"You should be thankful for that since it enables you to sup so
well."</p>
<p>"In this world, as you may to find, the greater the cause for
thankfulness on the one hand, the greater the cause for repining on
the other. It is thus that Fortune bestows her favours: taking
payment always."</p>
<p>"The payment of a debt is no good cause for repining," she
objected.</p>
<p>He looked at her, so intently, so inscrutably, that all her
fears of yesterday evening suddenly returned, and she shivered.</p>
<p>"You are cold," he said, and she fancied that the shadow of a
smile swept almost imperceptibly across his lean face. "Let me
close the window." He rose, and crossed the room; and it was whilst
he stood with his back towards her, humouring the catch of the
lattice, that she suddenly took her resolve to end this suspense,
to put his intentions regarding her to an immediate test. She
waited only until he had returned to his seat.</p>
<p>"You have been very good to me, incredibly good to me, citizen."
Her eyes were upon the coarsely woven table-cloth; between finger
and thumb she was kneading a little ball of crumb. "I must speak of
it because the time has come to thank you; to thank you, and to
part."</p>
<p>She looked up suddenly to surprise his expression, and found it
compounded of suspicion, anger and dismay.</p>
<p>"Part?" He frowned as he uttered the word. With heightened
incredulity he repeated: "Part?"</p>
<p>She explained herself. "We are already in the Nivernais. It is
my own country. I have friends throughout the province..."</p>
<p>"Friends? What friends?" His tone suggested that their mention
should be their death-warrant.</p>
<p>"It would not be fair to them to name them; nor, indeed, quite
fair to you. It might test your duty too severely. Neither would it
be fair to you that I accompany you into Nevers in broad daylight
to-morrow. After all, I was well-known there not so many months
ago. There will be many left who might recognize me. Seeing me in
your company and thus, what could they assume? You would be
compromised, and..."</p>
<p>"Compromised!" His scornful laughter shook the crazy windows.
"And who in Nevers would dare to compromise me?"</p>
<p>"Your carelessness cannot deceive me." Her gray-green eyes
looked at him resolutely. "And that is why we part to-night."</p>
<p>He leaned forward across the board. His face was very grave. It
had lost some of its habitual colour.</p>
<p>"You give me news, citoyenne. We part to-night, eh? To-night?
And will you tell me where you are going?"</p>
<p>"I could not tell that without compromising others."</p>
<p>He laughed. "You'll compromise the whole Nivernais before ever I
let you go." The tone was fierce, snarling, as a dog snarls over a
bone that is being wrested away. But immediately almost he had
checked that too-revealing note. His voice was smooth again.
"You'll forgive my insistence, citoyenne. But I have not
jeopardized my neck to save yours from the guillotine just to have
you throw my gift away in sheer wantonness. Oh no. I shall make
sure of your safety before I part with you."</p>
<p>"But you said in Paris..."</p>
<p>"Never mind what I said in Paris." There was an angry rumbling
in his voice. "Consider only what I have said here. I do not part
with you until I am assured of your safety."</p>
<p>She was answered. Her suspense, her doubts, were at an end. He
was the wolf she had at first supposed him, and she was the prey he
promised himself. Of her terror she permitted him to catch no
glimpse. Her surprise passed, chased away by a smile, a smile of a
sweetness and gentleness such as she had never yet vouchsafed
him.</p>
<p>"Your generosity...your nobility leaves me without words. You
bring me almost to tears, citizen; tears of gratitude."</p>
<p>"Add nothing more," he implored her. His voice grew hoarse. "You
have yet to learn the depth of a devotion which would stop at
nothing in your service, Cléonie."</p>
<p>One of his long arms came across the table, and his fine hand
closed upon hers where it lay there beside her plate. A moment she
let it remain, loathing his touch, repressing the shudder that
might betray that loathing, and loathing herself for the duplicity
to which circumstances compelled her to descend. Then, hot with a
shame, whose flush he entirely misunderstood, smiling with a rather
piteous wistfulness she gently disengaged her hand and rose.</p>
<p>"Suffer me to go," she begged him. "I...I am a little
confused."</p>
<p>"No! Wait!" He, too, had risen, and stood eager beyond the
dividing board, to him so inopportunely placed.</p>
<p>"To-morrow!" she begged him faintly. "We will talk again
to-morrow, citizen. Let me go now! Ah, let me go!"</p>
<p>Almost she overdid it, almost she overacted the suggestion of a
spiritual struggle against the magnetism of his personality. With
another, indeed, it might have been entirely fatal. But
Chauvinière, the psychologist, felt he knew the full value of
restraint, knew how much more complete is the ultimate surrender to
a generous opponent! He bowed low, in silence save for a little
sigh, and by the time he came upright again he was alone. She had
slipped like a ghost into the adjacent room. He saw the white door
close. He heard the bolts rasp home. He smiled as he stood there.
Then he sighed again, still smiling, resumed his chair, and poured
himself wine.</p>
<p>Behind her bolted door Mademoiselle de Montsorbier stood
breathless and a little faint. She leaned against it, listening to
his movements in the room beyond, and gradually she resumed her
self-command. She moved at last to the dressing-table and by the
dim light of the single candle burning, sat down before her mirror,
but made no attempt to prepare herself for bed.</p>
<p>Thus for a half-hour, at the end of which she heard the rasp of
his chair in the outer room, followed by the sound of his pacing to
and fro like a caged animal. Once his steps came right up to her
door and paused there. She stiffened, her skin roughened and she
was conscious of an acceleration of her pulses as she waited
through that pause, which seemed interminable, waited for his
knock. It came at last, sharply rapped and the sound brought her to
her feet.</p>
<p>By a miracle she kept her voice steady. "Who is there?"</p>
<p>"It is I, citoyenne. Chauvinière."</p>
<p>"What do you want, citizen?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause before his answer came: "To warn you that
we start very early in the morning. The chaise will be ready at
five o'clock."</p>
<p>"I shall be punctual, citizen. Good night!"</p>
<p>"Good night, citoyenne."</p>
<p>His footsteps receded. She heard them cross the length of the
outer room. Then he passed into his own chamber, and at last came
the closing of his door. She was able to breathe again. But her
mind continued agitated, confused. Had he deliberately sought to
scare her, merely so as to show that all fear of him was idle and
thus lull her into a sense of false security, or had his action
been genuine?</p>
<p>She crossed the room and flung herself upon the bed fully
dressed as she was, even to her riding-boots, but she left the
candle burning, and made no attempt to go to sleep. With a patience
and self-control that were miraculous considering what was in her
mind, she lay thus, listening and waiting for a full two hours
until she could be sure that the house slept. Then, at last, she
rose, and removed her boots. She took up the guttering candle, and
very softly withdrew the bolts of her door. Cautiously,
soundlessly, she opened it, and soundlessly crept out into the room
beyond, which now was all in darkness. A moment she paused
listening. From beyond the far door came a sound of mild snoring.
The Citizen-Representative was asleep.</p>
<p>With her boots in one hand and the candle held aloft in the
other she tip-toed towards the door that opened to the stairs.
Midway across the room she checked. Something gleamed lividly on a
side-table, and drew her glance. It was the clasp of the
Representative's portfolio. She paused, hesitating, scared by the
temptation that assailed her, to which at last, with a pale smile,
she yielded. She snatched up the portfolio and tucked it under her
arm. Then she passed out, and in her stockinged feet cautiously
descended the creaking staircase.</p>
<p>In the passage below she paused to put on her boots. Then very
carefully she drew the bolts of a side door, and stepped out into
the stable yard. Upon the closed lower half leaned a man who had
observed her exit, and who now straightened himself to challenge
her. Instantly resolved, she anticipated him.</p>
<p>"Ha! You are astir! It is fortunate; for otherwise I must have
fetched you from your bed. I need a horse at once, citizen."</p>
<p>"A horse? At this hour?"</p>
<p>"Business of the Nation." The young secretary's voice was hard
and peremptory. He flourished his portfolio. "I am to ride ahead of
the Citizen-Representative into Nevers. There is urgency. Make
haste, or you will answer to the Citizen-Representative."</p>
<p>A horse was quickly saddled, and upon this the young secretary,
with a seat suggestive of a huntsman rather than a clerk, vanished
at the gallop into the night.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>THE Citizen-Representative, newly-risen, scrupulously shaved,
his hair dressed as carefully as an aristocrat's stalked into the
main room between the bedrooms, calling briskly for chocolate.</p>
<p>Whilst he waited he sauntered to the window, and stood there
considering the darkness and drizzle outside. Presently, however,
the general stillness about him smote his attention as a sudden
sound might have done at another time. It moved him apprehensively.
He stepped swiftly to Mademoiselle de Montsorbier's door, and
rapped sharply with his knuckles. There was no answer. He tried the
handle. It turned, and the door swung inwards, discovering to him
the room's lack of tenant. He noted the bed, undisturbed save by an
impression of her form so faint as to suggest that it was some
hours since she had lain there, nor then had lain there long.</p>
<p>With an oath, he flung headlong from the room. The innkeeper,
terrified by the Representative's furious demands for his
secretary, backed by horrible threats of the guillotine in the
event of prevarication or evasion, quaveringly swore that he knew
nothing whatever of the missing person and that he learnt now for
the first time of that person's absence.</p>
<p>The Citizen-Representative stared at the mumbling oaf with such
fierce flaming eyes that the fellow recoiled in dread. But the
ostler, lounging near at hand and overhearing the angry
interrogatory, came forward to supply the answer which was to
quench Chauvinière's last lingering hope.</p>
<p>"And you let him go?" said Chauvinière between his teeth. He was
smiling terribly. "You let him go? Like that? Tell me which way he
went. Use your worthless head, animal, or you may lose it."</p>
<p>The ostler, answered the youth had ridden off in the direction
of Nevers.</p>
<p>"Saddle me a horse," he commanded, and on that horse he was,
himself, riding away through the darkness to Nevers within ten
minutes, leaving the post-boy to follow with the chaise.</p>
<p>Reaching Nevers at noon, he went to the President of the
Revolutionary Committee, a heavy-bodied, lumbering tanner named
Desjardins, and stated his immediate need. His papers had been
stolen last night at La Charité by a youth whom he had befriended,
and who he was now assured was a girl, a cursed aristocrat, no
doubt. She was known to have ridden off in the direction of Nevers.
Her recapture was of the utmost importance. Heads would fall if she
were not re-taken.</p>
<p>That the agents of the Committee were active is not to be
doubted. In fact their activities were proved by the recapture on
the morrow, near Chatillon, of the horse which the girl had ridden,
and later by the discovery in a ditch near Souvigny of a black
riding-coat, boots and other articles of apparel which Chauvinière
recognized as those worn by the fugitive, as well as of an empty
portfolio of black leather with a metal clasp, which the
Representative acknowledged his own property. Of the fugitive
herself, however, there was no trace.</p>
<p>At last towards the end of April Chauvinière's dreaded progress
brought him to the little hill-town of Poussignot.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Committee of Poussignot was hurriedly summoned
to the little town-hall, overlooking the market-square, where the
carpenters were already busy with the erection of the scaffold. In
muttering awe they awaited the coming of this dread man from the
Convention, who was to rouse that sleepy and hitherto contented
township from its revolutionary languor.</p>
<p>He arrived at last, arrogant and overbearing, and already
informed, it appeared, of certain things in and about Poussignot,
for he produced a list of persons suspected of the new crime of
<i>incivisme</i>, in one or another of its many forms.</p>
<p>It was upon naming the third of these--one Raoul Amédée de
Corbigny--that he received his first check.</p>
<p>"Of what is he accused, that one?"</p>
<p>The question came abruptly from Doucier, the horse-leech, a man
prominent in the local Jacobin Society, honest, fearless and
formidable in debate, a man who might, had he chosen, represent his
own section of the Nivernais in the National Convention. He was the
first, as might have been expected, to throw off the spell of
terror which Chauvinière had imposed upon the Committee.</p>
<p>Surprised by the sudden audacity of the interruption,
Chauvinière answered impatiently: "He is accused of harbouring
counter-revolutionary sentiments."</p>
<p>"But the Committee of Poussignot demands precise accusations;
not vague charges which of its own knowledge it perceives to be
unfounded."</p>
<p>An approving growl from the assembly informed Chauvinière that,
infected by the example of their president, the members of the
committee had so far recovered from the spell of his oratory as to
be in a state of mutiny.</p>
<p>"Do you say that I lie?" he asked them icily.</p>
<p>"Oh! But Citizen-Representative! Only that you may have been
misinformed. If you will suffer us to guide you in matters of local
knowledge, citizen, you will accept our assurance that you have
been misled. I assure you, citizen, that the gravest consequences
might follow upon an unsubstantiated attack upon Corbigny. In
Poussignot all know the stalwart republicanism of his principles;
all know the unpretentious simplicity of his existence, and all
love him. That is not a man to be lightly accused. For your own
sake, Citizen-Representative, and for ours, you would do well to be
fully armed with particulars of Corbigny's <i>incivisme</i> before
you demand of us his arrest."</p>
<p>If the argument did not suffice to turn Chauvinière from his
purpose, it sufficed to make him temporize. He announced he would
visit Corbigny, and form at first hand an opinion of the real
sentiments of the ci-devant Vicomte.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>THE Château de Corbigny was perched amid vineyards halfway up
the hill above the town, standing four-square, grey and a little
dilapidated, flanked by round towers under red roofs.</p>
<p>Within doors, the Citizen-Representative found the same
unpretentiousness. He encountered Corbigny in the vast stone
kitchen, at table with the persons of his household. These
consisted of his elderly steward, Fougereot, the latter's wife,
their two stalwart sons and a plump, comely young woman
euphoniously named Filomène, who was responsible for the domestic
comforts of the impoverished nobleman. Corbigny, himself, a man of
thirty, fitted into his environment as if made for it. In dress he
was almost a peasant, in dignity and courtesy a gentleman, whilst
in speech and in countenance, with his lofty brow and sombre
wistful eyes, he suggested the scholar and poet. He rose now to
receive his visitor.</p>
<p>"I represent a government, citizen, that dispenses with
ceremony," said Chauvinière, but with a good deal less than his
usual haughty sententiousness.</p>
<p>Corbigny smiled. "Will you not join our board, then?" He placed
a chair. "It is of a republican simplicity."</p>
<p>"That is as it should be," said Chauvinière, who detested
republican simplicity, and daily thanked God for a revolution which
had brought the succulent things of life within his easy reach. He
sat down. He was served by Filomène with bread and ham, both of
which he found of an excellent quality, whilst Corbigny himself
poured for him a wine which left little to be desired. Not so
hopelessly republican, after all, this simple fare. Corbigny and
his odd guest talked indifferently of this and that, whilst the
others sat listening in uneasy silence. At last, the meal being
ended, Chauvinière sat back, flung one buckskinned leg over the arm
of his chair, and tucked his long hand under the tricolour sash of
office that girdled him. "You are very snug here at Corbigny,
citizen. I wonder that you have never brought a mistress to
it."</p>
<p>"What would you?" Corbigny said, laughing a little. "I have
waited perhaps too long. Today..." he shrugged. "Today it would not
be easy perhaps to find..." He checked abruptly, as one checks on
the brink of an indiscretion.</p>
<p>But the indiscretion was committed; for Chauvinière had no
difficulty in completing the ci-devant's sentence. He had meant to
say that it was not easy to find a woman of his own class in a
France which had been purged of aristocrats.</p>
<p>"To find what, citizen?" he coaxed.</p>
<p>"Oh, but nothing, citizen." Corbigny was faintly embarrassed.
"It does not matter. And it would be easy to find a more
interesting topic of conversation than myself."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken in both opinions. It matters very much."
Chauvinière had thought of something else. "Celibacy is an affront
to Nature; and who affronts Nature is no good republican, since
republicanism is based on Nature's laws. That is why I say that it
matters very much."</p>
<p>When they began to realize that he was not jesting, Corbigny
made haste to change the subject.</p>
<p>Chauvinière left shortly, but on the morrow he inaugurated that
novel mission of his. From the rostrum of the Jacobin Society of
Poussignot he propounded his new gospel with the frenzied rhetoric
and specious cant with which he had learnt to sway the passions of
emotional unintelligent mobs. France was being depopulated by the
events. That was his starting point. The evil brood of aristocracy
must be replaced by a race of free men, born in an enlightened age.
To neglect this was to neglect the most sacred duty that the Nation
had the right to claim from them. It was to expose the Republic,
through depopulation, to ultimate destruction. Forth came, then,
that master-phrase of his: "Celibacy is an affront to Nature!" As
none knew better than Chauvinière, who made intellectual toys for
himself out of these things, such was the crack-brained state of
the popular mind that the more extravagant a doctrine, the more
assured it was of acceptance.</p>
<p>Within ten days the movement had reached such a pitch that it
was proposed and unanimously agreed at the Society of Jacobins
that, as the Citizen-Representative had propounded, for a man of
twenty-five to remain unmarried in the face of the country's needs
was to give proof of <i>incivisme</i>, to be punished as
<i>incivisme</i> was punished by declaring him outside the law and
sending him to the guillotine. And in the Commune of Poussignot
that amazing resolution of the Jacobins was raised to the
equivalent of a law.</p>
<p>At last the ground was sufficiently prepared for an attack upon
the elusive ci-devant Vicomte de Corbigny. A definite accusation of
<i>incivisme</i>, hitherto difficult, was now rendered easy.</p>
<p>The accusation was laid, and M. de Corbigny was haled before the
bar of the Tribunal to receive the usual admonition. To do honour
to the court and the occasion, he had dressed himself with unusual
care, in garments stored up for ceremonious occasions: a black coat
with silver buttons, silk breeches and stockings and buckled
shoes.</p>
<p>"The Citizen ci-devant Vicomte de Corbigny, belongs by birth to
a class which the Republic has abolished. Himself he has gone
unscathed because of the republican spirit by which he is believed
to be inspired. He should perceive that he is now provided with an
opportunity of placing his republicanism beyond all possibility of
future question.</p>
<p>"Acquainted as I am with his household, in which I have had the
honour to be entertained, I am fortunately in a position to advise
him. A girl of the people who serves him should prove domestically
a very suitable wife. Therefore, this court counsels him not only
to marry, but to marry Filomène Paulard, thus affording an abiding
proof of his acceptance of the religion of equality--a religion in
which France will tolerate no heretics."</p>
<p>The riff-raff largely composing the audience hailed the proposal
uproariously as worthy of Solomon. When that uproar died down,
Monsieur de Corbigny at last spoke. A scarlet flush had overspread
his long and rather melancholy countenance. But his voice remained
calm and steady.</p>
<p>"You know..." He half-turned, so as to include the entire
assembly. "You all know my habits of life and of thought, and the
simple creed by which I have governed my existence. I believe in
communism, and I have given proofs of that belief. The Nation is
above the individual, and I recognize the Nation's right to demand
of me my property and, at need, my life. But I do not recognize the
Nation's right to demand of me my soul..."</p>
<p>Chauvinière impatiently interrupted him. "We have abolished all
that!"</p>
<p>But Corbigny went on as if the interruption had not been: "Nor
do I recognize the Nation's voice in that demand. With submission,
citizen-judges, you were placed here to administer the existing
laws and not to create new ones. The making of laws is the sole
prerogative of the National Convention, and any man or group of men
infringing that prerogative and arrogating any such rights are
themselves guilty of an <i>incivisme</i> for which they may be
indicted."</p>
<p>Chauvinière admired the shrewdness and subtlety of that
counter-attack, and was thankful that it was made before men of too
low an order of intelligence to appreciate it. A growl of anger and
mockery was all it drew from the assembly, and when that subsided
the President spoke without emotion: "You have three days for
consideration, Citizen Corbigny."</p>
<p>Corbigny advanced a step, throwing off his imperturbability. His
eyes blazed in a face that passion turned from red to white. "Three
seconds would be too much, Citizen-President, for consideration;
three centuries not enough to alter my resolve to reject this
infamy."</p>
<p>And whilst the crowd surged snarling and growling, the
President, impassive as doom, insisted: "Nevertheless, you have
three days."<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>AT the leisurely pace of a man who meditates, M. de Corbigny
took his way home up the hill through the April dusk. He did not
relish the thought of dying. Even less, however, did he relish the
thought of the horrible mésalliance by which he might save his
life. The futility of flight was too apparent. He would be hunted
down, and at a time when it was impossible to move openly in the
country without papers he would soon be overtaken and brought back
in ignominy. Let him at least preserve his self-respect. Reluctant
though he might be to die, life, after all, was not so delectable
in these days.</p>
<p>He mounted a stile into one of his meadows, and as he leapt
lightly down upon the turf, he was suddenly aware of a figure,
faintly visible in the gloom, crouching behind the wall. A moment
he stood gazing, then called out, challenging; whereupon the figure
came upright, and was off at speed across the narrow strip of
meadowland towards the woods.</p>
<p>The eccentricity of this behaviour, thought M. de Corbigny,
called for investigation. He was fleet of foot, and he was upon the
fugitive before the latter had covered half the distance to his
goal. He clutched the shoulder of a stripling, clad in the blouse,
loose pantaloons and wooden shoes of a peasant. "A word with you,
my friend. You are too fleet for honesty, to say nothing of your
skulking behind a wall."</p>
<p>"Let me go," snarled a boyish voice. "I have done you no harm."
The figure writhed in his grasp. "Don't dare to detain me!"</p>
<p>"Dare!" Corbigny laughed.</p>
<p>Something bright gleamed suddenly in the boy's hand. On the
instant Corbigny had him in a wrestler's grip which pinned his arms
helplessly to his sides. He hugged the murderous rascal close,
intending to throw him. Instead, as if contact with that young body
had burnt him, he thrust it sharply from him, and stepped back. The
supposed stripling stood before him, breathing hard with head a
little bowed, making no further attempt to escape.</p>
<p>"Who are you? What are you? And why are you dressed as a man?
Answer me. I will not hurt you."</p>
<p>The sudden gentleness of his voice, more, its high-bred
inflection wrought a change in the other's attitude. He threw back
his head, showing a face that gleamed white and ghostly in the
half-light. "Who are <i>you</i>? What is <i>your</i> name?" came
the counter-questions in a voice which left Corbigny little doubt
of the person's quality.</p>
<p>"Until lately I was known as the Vicomte de Corbigny. Since then
I have enjoyed a certain peace as a ci-devant. At the moment I
scarcely know how to describe myself. But this land is still mine,
and that house up yonder, which I shall place at your disposal if
you will deal frankly with me."</p>
<p>"You are a gentleman!"</p>
<p>He inclined his head a little. "It surprises you to meet one at
large in France, of course. But not more than it surprises me to
meet a lady."</p>
<p>He heard the sharp intake of her breath. "How do you know
that?"</p>
<p>"How? I have my instincts, madame--or, is it mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>She hesitated long before passionately answering him: "Oh, if
you are a trickster, play your vile trick. I care not. I am sick
and weary. I should welcome even such rest as the guillotine
brings. I am Cléonie de Montsorbier. You are incredulous? You have
heard of us in prison in Paris. We are a Nivernaise family, and
there should be interest in us hereabouts. You may even have heard
that I was removed to a house of lunatics, but not that I was
removed thence. It's a long story, M. le Vicomte."</p>
<p>"Tell it me as we walk," said he, and, taking her by the arm he
turned her about to face the house whose windows glowed ruddily in
the deepening night.</p>
<p>As they went she told him briefly of her pseudo-secretaryship,
and of her escape at La Charité from her republican protector whom
she left unnamed. She had hoped to shelter at the Château de
Blesson, with her cousins there. But to her dismay, on reaching it
in the dawn, she had found it closed and shuttered, the family
gone. Thence on a tired horse, she had plodded on to Verrues ten
miles away, where another cousin dwelt. She found Verrues a
blackened ruin, and in her weariness and despair, she sat down
before it, and gave way to tears.</p>
<p>Thus she was surprised by a group of scared peasants. Because it
was not in their simple hearts to let a gentlewoman suffer, they
gave her shelter for some days; until fearing lest she should bring
trouble upon them, and also because to lie there in hiding was too
temporary a measure to suit her impatient eager spirit, she
procured from them the peasant garments in which she stood, and
departed, hoping to make her way on foot across the Nivernais and
Burgundy, and thence slip over the frontier into Switzerland. But
the journey had been one of hardships beyond all that she had
feared.</p>
<p>M. de Corbigny surprised her by a little laugh. "Faith,
mademoiselle, almost you set me an example."</p>
<p>"An example?"</p>
<p>"You suggest things..." He broke off. "No, no. I had thought of
it. It is not worth while." He pushed wide the door, and the glow
of light from within smote them with almost blinding violence.</p>
<p>"Be welcome to Corbigny, mademoiselle."</p>
<p>She stepped ahead of him into the spacious and rather shabby
stone hall. He paused a moment to close and make fast the door,
then turned, and his eyes, now accustomed to the light, beheld her
clearly for the first time. Her grey blouse was stained and in
places ragged. She had doffed the shabby hat, which looked as if it
might have been filched from a scarecrow. She had cut her hair, and
it hung loose and ragged now about her neck and ears, just as a
peasant lad's might hang, but the light smote from its golden sheen
an aureole about her little head, so admirably poised, and the
finely-featured face gave the lie to the rest of her.</p>
<p>M. de Corbigny gazed upon her, lost in a rapture of wonder such
as he had never known. So intent was the gaze of his sombre, dark
eyes that at last her glance fell away before him, and she shifted
a little uncomfortably.</p>
<p>But still he gazed and gazed, and the natural wistfulness
deepened in his countenance. When at last he spoke, it was
cryptically, employing the old formula of the gladiator meeting
death. "<i>Moriturus te salutat</i>!" He bowed a little. "Yet it is
good to have seen you first." And then the instincts of his blood
asserting themselves, he put aside all considerations but those due
to a guest.</p>
<p>"You will require garments, mademoiselle. I will call my
housekeeper. Perhaps she may..."</p>
<p>"Ah, no!" she checked him. "Clean linen if you will. Give it me
yourself, or send it to me by a man if you wish. But for the rest,
leave me as I am, nor disclose me to be other. The citizen
Chauvinière is a thought too close for any risks."</p>
<p>"You know the citizen Chauvinière?"</p>
<p>She smiled. It was wonderful, he thought, that she should smile
so. "I have heard of his activities."</p>
<p>He nodded. "You are wise perhaps. Come, then, you shall have
what you require."</p>
<p>Himself he conducted her to a room above, procured for her the
linen she required, and left her, to inform and instruct his
household touching the presence of a boy who was his guest.</p>
<p>Deep dejection sat upon that little company gathered there to
supper in the great kitchen, and Filomène, as she waited upon them,
showed eyes that were red from weeping in a face unusually white.
They had heard the day's events before the Tribunal and the doom
that overhung their master. Filomène herself was outraged in her
every sensibility by the offensive alternative to death which had
been offered the Vicomte. Corbigny alone appeared unmoved by the
sword suspended over him.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>"MADEMOISELLE remain yet another day with us. The more complete
now your rest, the better speed will you make hereafter; so that
the time will not be lost."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier demurred at the proposal. She could
not think of subjecting M. de Corbigny to the risk of her discovery
under his roof.</p>
<p>At this M. de Corbigny laughed with such evident amusement as to
pique her a little, for she could not conceive in what she was
ridiculous. But he explained his laughter. "Mademoiselle, I am in
the enviable position of a man for whom risks have ceased to exist,
whom fear can no longer touch. This is Tuesday, and on Thursday
next I am to die. That is why I laugh at the notion of danger to me
from harbouring you."</p>
<p>"Monsieur! How is this possible? You amuse yourself at my
expense! How can it be that you, who are free..."</p>
<p>"I will explain," he interrupted her, and he did so.</p>
<p>She heard his tale in growing distress and also in growing
admiration for his intrepid calm, for the almost humorous outlook
with which he viewed his desperate situation.</p>
<p>"The beast!" she said, when he had done. "The cruel, mocking
beast! Why do you not seek safety in flight?"</p>
<p>"I thought of it, of course. But it would be useless, and
there's a degradation in failure to which I will not submit. I'll
be no quarry for these revolutionary dogs. If succumb I must, I'll
succumb as my blood demands."</p>
<p>She looked at him in silence with an infinite compassion, an
infinite tenderness. "Is there," she asked after a moment, "no
third course possible? Have you thought well, monsieur?"</p>
<p>Something of her tender concern escaped her in her voice. He
halted before her, and his dark solemn eyes considered her. His
face grew pale as if with fear, and a deeper wistfulness crept into
the lines of it. At last he answered her very slowly. "Yes, I have
thought. And a third course offers. But I hesitate from fear of
being misunderstood."</p>
<p>She almost smiled as she looked up at him. "To a man in your
case can it matter to be misunderstood? Speak freely, then."</p>
<p>He spoke, but not freely. He faltered and stumbled awkwardly in
an utterance that normally was precise and scholarly. "You will not
see, mademoiselle, I beseech you, a lack of...of homage in what I
am to say. In other circumstances...But here time presses. Bear
with me, mademoiselle, though I may seem to you outrageous. Doubt
what you will, but not my truth and sincerity.</p>
<p>"When first I saw you there in the light last night, it seemed
to me...as if my soul leapt from me to embrace your soul. I utter
crudities, perhaps. I can express it in no other way. But so
spontaneous, so...so inevitable was this thing, that it has seemed
to me...It is not a presumption, mademoiselle. It is an instinct, I
think. It has seemed to me that something reciprocal, something
mutual must have taken place. It seemed impossible that a man's
spirit could...experience so much...unsupported. Mademoiselle, I am
ashamed of my poor words. They do not..."</p>
<p>She interrupted him at last. She had risen, and, unbelievable
miracle, as it seemed to him, her breast was leaning on his own,
her face, all white and piteous was upturned to him.</p>
<p>"Ashamed!" she cried. "Ashamed!" There was a music of tenderness
in her voice that dazed his senses. "Your words leave nothing
unsaid. Nothing that is not true, at least. Your instincts were at
no fault, my dear."</p>
<p>His arms went round her. His voice was the voice of a man in
pain. "Love is the fulfilment of every living thing, and I might
have died unfulfilled if you had not come to me at the eleventh
hour."</p>
<p>She shuddered. "I had forgotten. Oh, my dear!" she lay faint
against him.</p>
<p>"No, no," he cried, to hearten her. "You make life possible. If
I had been wrong, nothing further would have mattered. I should
still have died the richer, the nobler for what you brought me. But
since you care...Listen, my dear. The decree is only that I marry.
So that I marry within three days I fulfil the requirements of this
grotesque mockery which they call a law. Filomène was proposed to
me, because I would make no choice for myself. But Filomène or
another, it is all one to them. If you, then, come with me before
the Tribunal, in peasant dress--that will be safer--as a girl whom
I prefer, whom I have chosen for myself. We can invent your place
of origin. That will not be difficult. If, then..."</p>
<p>She broke away from him, and stepped back. "Oh, you don't know
what you are saying!" she cried out in deep distress.</p>
<p>He stood crestfallen, his soaring hopes all checked. "But
if...if...we love each other?" he faltered. "What difficulty, then?
Need the notion of an immediate marriage be so repugnant?"</p>
<p>"It isn't that. It isn't that. Chauvinière!" she said
significantly.</p>
<p>"Chauvinière?" he echoed, not understanding at first. Then light
broke suddenly upon him. "It was he? It was he who...?"</p>
<p>She nodded, her little features twisted in a bitter smile.</p>
<p>There was a tap at the door. Filomène came in with a scared
countenance. "It is the Citizen-Representative," she announced. "He
is here. He asks to see you."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier shrank back in fear. Corbigny came
to his feet, very stiff and straight and suddenly of a
preternatural calm.</p>
<p>"He comes most opportunely." Corbigny's voice had resumed its
normal, pleasant tone. "I was considering going in quest of him.
Detain him a moment or two in the hall, Filomène. Then bring him
in."</p>
<p>Before Filomène was out of the room, Corbigny was at a tall
cupboard of polished mulberry that stood against the wall. He found
Mademoiselle de Montsorbier at his elbow. "Will you hide me in
there?"</p>
<p>He lost a second in staring at her. Then he smiled and shook his
head. "I have no thought to hide you." He took a mahogany case from
a shelf in the cupboard.</p>
<p>"But if he finds me here!"</p>
<p>"It is what I desire." He took up a powder horn and a little
linen bag, and closed the door of the cupboard. "The confident,
overbearing fool!" He crossed to his writing-table, and opened the
box.</p>

<br></p>
<p>ESCORTED by Filomène, Chauvinière swaggered presently into the
library, lithe and active in his long grey coat, tricolour sash
from which a sabre now dangled. Within the threshold he halted,
irony in every line of him. "I am here, my dear ci-devant, to
exhort you in the fraternal spirit..."</p>
<p>He broke off. A slight movement in the corner on his right drew
his glance aside.</p>
<p>"Why? Who's this that..." Again he checked, leaning forward, and
staring. He took a quick step, and stopped again. Then an oath
escaped him, and on the heels of that a laugh, loud and full of
relish. "Why here's a meeting!" He swept off his hat. "It becomes
necessary to uncover." He bowed. "And how long may you have been
here, my dear secretary?"</p>
<p>"Since last night, citizen," said the lady simply, so simply and
calmly that it staggered him.</p>
<p>"Oh since last night, citizen!" he mimicked her. "Since last
night, eh? Name of a name! I find more than I sought." He moved to
advance towards her.</p>
<p>"Stand where you are!"</p>
<p>The cold, crisp tone arrested him. He stiffened as he confronted
Corbigny across half the room. There was in that gentleman's
attitude, in his very calm, something sinister and menacing.
Instantly Chauvinière scented danger, and as instantly would he
have forestalled it, but that he was undone by the mockery in which
he dealt so lavishly. His absurd gesture of mock-deference,
cumbered now his right hand with his doffed hat. Before he could
slip that hand into his bosom to pluck thence the pistol which he
carried ready for just such emergencies, it was necessary to be rid
of the hat. He tucked it swiftly under his left arm. But got no
farther.</p>
<p>It was the danger signal to Corbigny, and Corbigny now covered
him with a heavy duelling pistol, steadied upon his left forearm.
"Move a finger, Citizen-Representative, and I'll kill you."</p>
<p>Chauvinière obeyed, but none too literally. He planted his feet
wide, and folded his hands behind him. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>"Really! Really! My dear ci-devant! Why should you desire to
intimidate me?"</p>
<p>"You misapprehend me. I am not proposing to intimidate you."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"To kill you."</p>
<p>Again Chauvinière laughed, but he paled a little under his
tan.</p>
<p>"Let us be practical, citizen. How can my death serve you?"</p>
<p>Corbigny remained unperturbed. "You are forgetting that my life
being already forfeit, I can lose nothing by killing you."</p>
<p>"You mean that you intend to murder me in cold blood! It is
inconceivable. After all, you are a gentleman, not an assassin."
There was no mockery now in Chauvinière's voice. It was warmly
earnest. "At least, let us exchange shots, here in this room--at
ten paces, or any distance that you please elsewhere. You cannot do
less than that."</p>
<p>Monsieur de Corbigny resumed his urbanity. "I am desolated to
refuse you even that. If it were a question only of myself, I would
accede gladly. But there is Mademoiselle de Montsorbier. I cannot
allow her fate to depend upon luck or marksmanship."</p>
<p>"Wait!" said the lady sharply, and she advanced a step. "Let us
be practical, as the Citizen-Representative suggested. Let
us..."</p>
<p>Two pistol-shots ringing out almost simultaneously cropped short
her speech.</p>
<p>Her sudden intervention, and perhaps even more the little
forward movement that she made, momentarily drew Corbigny's eyes to
her. In that moment the ever-watchful Chauvinière perceived his
opportunity. Into the bosom of his broad-lapelled coat flashed his
right hand, and out again with a pistol, which he discharged at the
Vicomte, almost without aiming. But swift as was the movement, it
was not swift enough; for, perceiving it, the Vicomte fired no more
than a fraction of a heart-beat later.</p>
<p>Corbigny stepped back, white and shaken, but unharmed. The
other's bullet had grazed his shoulder. Chauvinière reeled to the
wall, pressing over his left breast a hand which grew red almost at
once with the blood oozing between the fingers.</p>
<p>"At least, I've had my shot," he said, and his features twisted
into a grin. "I hope I've given better than I've received.
You'll..."</p>
<p>He broke off to cough. His features writhed, his limbs twitched,
and finally he slid down the wall into a little heap from which his
knees protruded sharply.</p>
<p>The Vicomte stepped sharply across to screen him. "Please go,"
he said over his shoulder. "Please go at once."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Montsorbier hesitated, made as if she would
disregard the command, then ended by obeying.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Monsieur de Corbigny came to her in the hall.
He was grave, but quite composed. He found her alone with Filomène.
The Fougereots, he knew, were at work out of doors. She was beside
him at a bound. "We have no time to lose."</p>
<p>"I could not permit that he should continue to live." Thus spoke
the lover, showing his jealousy.</p>
<p>"He would have served us better living."</p>
<p>"I desired no service of him; not even a service that might have
saved my life."</p>
<p>"Oh, will you listen! My life, too, is at issue. We might have
constrained from him three lines of writing to inform the members
of the Tribunal that he had suddenly been called away to Nevers or
Paris. Then we could have locked him in the cellar to give us time
to get away. Your hastiness spoilt all."</p>
<p>He stood suddenly contrite before her.</p>
<p>"Now we must repair the thing as best we can. I'll try when I am
calmer, when I have ceased to shake if I ever do. Oh, I am a little
coward, when all is said."</p>
<p>He took her in his arms to comfort her and to still her tremors
as well as further to question her. But she presently withdrew,
bidding him to make ready for a journey. "You think that it can
profit me to attempt to escape?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"I think it can, if you'll be guided by me this time."</p>
<p>She issued orders which he did not understand. But in his
penitence he bowed to them, nor probed their significance in view
of her assurance. She desired to be made free of his wardrobe, and
she further desired that Fougereot be summoned at once and sent to
her.</p>
<p>When, more than an hour later, she rejoined him, he was waiting
for her, spurred and booted, a cloak and a valise on the settle
beside him.</p>
<p>From his wardrobe she had contrived to adapt herself garments
which gave her very much the appearance she had worn on her first
flight from Paris as Chauvinière's secretary. She was brisk and
determined in manner, so that Corbigny's wonder grew ever as he
watched and listened. He was beginning to perceive something of the
spirit in her.</p>
<p>Her first question was for Fougereot, who waited there with his
master. "You have made all ready?"</p>
<p>"Everything as mademoiselle commanded."</p>
<p>"And your family?"</p>
<p>"Waiting out of doors with Filomène."</p>
<p>"The scarf and hat?"</p>
<p>"Here, mademoiselle." He pointed to the tricolour sash and the
plumed hat, lying on a chair.</p>
<p>She took them up and proffered them to the Vicomte. "My friend,
you must wear these." He shrank a little. "It is a necessity," she
insisted. "Henceforth, you are the Citizen-Representative
Chauvinière."</p>
<p>She spent a moment in assisting Corbigny to assume the sash of
office, then led him out, Fougereot following. Came brief but very
touching farewells between the seigneur and his shrunken
family.</p>
<p>"You will care for the land," Mademoiselle de Montsorbier told
them, "and count it your own until Monsieur the Vicomte comes to
claim it again."</p>
<p>Corbigny, still half-bemused, mounted his waiting horse, and she
hers; and presently by a path that skirted the little town of
Poussignot they were trotting through the dusk, their faces set
towards Burgundy.</p>
<p>"By dawn we shall be far away," she said. "Henceforth you are
the Representative Chauvinière on a mission to Switzerland, and I
am your secretary Antoine. You had better carry these. They are the
passports of the Committee of Safety to the Representative and his
secretary, enjoining upon all to aid and none to hinder them in the
name of the Republic One and Indivisible. And there are some other
papers, too, of importance, enjoining obedience upon all civil
functionaries."</p>
<p>He was silent a long time in sheer wonder. "I should have known
that you did not hope to strike blindly across the frontier. This
makes assured! Oh, it is as incredible as you are, Cléonie!"</p>
<p>Her laughter answered him, but this time very soft and tender.
And the marriage followed a week later, when they found themselves
amid friends.</p>
