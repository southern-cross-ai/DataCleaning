  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE BEGINNING OF THE HUNT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE most mysterious and baffling thing about Cæsar Valentine
  was to discover the reason for his mystery. It was a mystery which belonged
  to the category of elusive thought, the name that is on the tip of your
  tongue, the fact that is familiar, yet defies exact remembrance.</p>

  <p>When the International Police Conference held its yearly meeting in
  19&mdash; in Geneva, and after three strenuous days&rsquo; discussion which
  embraced matters so widely different as the circulation of forged Swedish
  notes and the philanderings of the Bosnian Ambassador (the conference did its
  best to prevent his assassination, which occurred six months later), the
  question of Cæsar Valentine came up for examination. It was an informal
  discussion, a mere drift of conversation arising out of the Gale case.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what is this man&rsquo;s offence,&rdquo;
  said Lecomte of the Surêté. &ldquo;He is very rich and very popular and
  immensely good-looking&mdash;but none of these qualities is
  criminal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does he get his money?&rdquo; demanded Leary of Washington.
  &ldquo;We had him in America for five years and he did nothing but
  spend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither in France nor in America is that a crime,&rdquo; smiled
  Lecomte.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People who have done business with him have had an unfortunate
  habit of dying suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Hallett of the London C.I.B. who put the matter so bluntly, and
  Leary nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Providence has been very
  good to Mr. Valentine. He was in a big wheat deal in Chicago in &rsquo;13 and
  the market went against him. The principal operator was Burgess&mdash;John
  Boyd Burgess. He had a grudge against Valentine and would have ruined him.
  One morning Burgess was discovered dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft in
  his hotel. He had dropped nineteen floors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M. Lecomte shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"An accident?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Hallett. &ldquo;This man Valentine got friendly
  with a banker in our country&mdash;a man named George Gale. Gale financed him
  out of the bank funds&mdash;but that was never proved. Gale was in the habit
  of taking a nerve tonic. He used to bring one dose in a tiny bottle to the
  office. He was found one night dead in his office with the little bottle in
  his hand. It bore the tonic label but it had contained prussic acid. When the
  auditors came to examine the books of the bank they found a hundred thousand
  pounds had disappeared. Valentine&rsquo;s account was in perfect order. Gale
  went to a suicide&rsquo;s grave&mdash;Valentine, sent a wreath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lecomte with another shrug, &ldquo;I am not
  defending M. Valentine. But it might have been suicide. Valentine might have
  been innocent. Where is your evidence to the contrary? There was an
  investigation, was there not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallett nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And nothing was discovered unflattering to the monsieur! You think
  he is a bad man? I tell you that I will place the full strength of my
  department at your disposal to prove it. I will have him watched day and
  night, for he is in France for six months in the year, but frankly I would
  desire more solid foundations for your suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He ran away with a man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
  Hallett, and Lecomte laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he apologised. &ldquo;That is not an offence under
  the Code Napoleon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the conversation drifted elsewhere.</p>

  <p>A year later Hallett of the C.I.B. sat hunched up in his chair, frowning
  gloomily at a typewritten report which was spread on his desk.</p>

  <p>He sat for half an hour, thinking; then he touched a bell and somebody
  came in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the chief&mdash;and when he began &ldquo;my
  friend&rdquo; he was very serious indeed&mdash;&ldquo;six months ago you came
  to me with certain theories about Mr. Cæsar Valentine. I don&rsquo;t want you
  to interrupt me,&rdquo; he said brusquely as his subordinate seemed likely to
  speak; &ldquo;just hear me through. I like you&mdash;you know that. I trust
  you or I wouldn&rsquo;t send you out on what looks like a hopeless search.
  What is more, I think your theories have some foundation. I have always
  thought so. That is why I&rsquo;ve put you into training and accepted you for
  this department.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A nod was the reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Police work,&rdquo; said Hallett, &ldquo;is a big game of solitaire
  in every sense of the word. If you watch every card and keep your mind
  concentrated on the game <i>and</i> you have luck, it comes out. If you start
  wool-gathering in the earlier stages you&rsquo;ll just miss putting up the
  right card, and you&rsquo;ll be stuck with the deuce of hearts, that
  <i>should</i> have gone up, lying snug and useless at the bottom of the pack.
  Patience is everything. Burns sent a man into the mining camps with the scrap
  of a photograph showing only a murderer&rsquo;s right eye and it was three
  years before this fellow of Burns nailed his man. Lecomte of the Surêté
  waited five years before he caught Madam Serpilot; and I myself as a young
  man trailed the Cully Smith gang for three years, eight months, and twelve
  days before I put Cully where I wanted him&mdash;and it will probably take
  you as long to pull down Cæsar Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When do I start?&rdquo; asked his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; replied Hallett. &ldquo;Nobody must know of your
  movements&mdash;not even at this office. Your pay and expenses will be sent
  to you and you will be entered in the books as &lsquo;on special service
  abroad.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will be difficult, chief; my name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have no name. Henceforth you will be Number Six and there will
  be nothing to identify you with&mdash;who you are. I shall give instructions
  that suggestions, wishes, or such S.O.S. messages as you send will be acted
  upon. Now get out and pull Valentine. This man may be the biggest thing of
  his kind&mdash;and the most dangerous man in the world. On the other hand,
  all the stories that come to Police Headquarters may be lies. It&rsquo;s a
  weird job you&rsquo;ve taken on. You can&rsquo;t jail a man for living
  expensively or for running away with men&rsquo;s wives, and that&rsquo;s his
  known record. Naturally he isn&rsquo;t popular with men and hatred breeds
  lies. You&rsquo;ve got to be bold and discreet, because I have reason to
  believe he has the most complete espionage bureau in the world. It was
  discovering that he subsidised a man here in this office that opened my eyes
  to the possibilities of the case. A man doesn&rsquo;t spend thousands to
  plant an ear at Headquarters unless he has something to fear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Number Six nodded again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s the world before you, my friend,&rdquo; said
  Hallett, &ldquo;and a great reward if you succeed. Find his friends&mdash;you
  can have the entree to every prison in Britain and maybe that will help
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big job,&rdquo; said Number Six, &ldquo;but it is the
  one job in the world I want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I know,&rdquo; agreed Hallett. &ldquo;It will be lonely, but
  you&rsquo;ll probably find a dozen people who will help you&mdash;the men and
  women he has ruined and broken; the fathers of daughters and the husbands of
  wives he has sent to hell. They&rsquo;ll be pretty good allies. Now go!
  I&rsquo;ve given you the finest intensive training that I can give, but maybe
  I haven&rsquo;t taught you just the thing you&rsquo;ll want to
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly and offered his hand and Number Six winced under the
  crushing grip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye and good luck, Number Six,&rdquo; he smiled.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget I shall never know you again if I meet you in the
  street. You are a stranger to me until you step into the witness-box at the
  Old Bailey and give the evidence which will put Mister Valentine permanently
  out of the game!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Number Six went out, nodding to the man at the door&mdash;the grim
  visaged custodian of the custodians&mdash;and for some years Scotland Yard
  lost sight of one against whose name in the Secret and Confidential Register
  of the Criminal Investigation Bureau Hallett wrote in his own hand:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On very particular service. No reference to be made to this agent
  in any report whatever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A year later Hallett summoned Chief Detective Steel to his office and told
  him just as much of his interview with Number Six as he deemed advisable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from Number Six for months,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Go to Paris and keep a fatherly eye on Cæsar Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me this about Number Six, chief,&rdquo; said Detective Steel.
  &ldquo;Is it a man or a woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallett grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar has been six months trying to find out,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fired three clerks for enquiring&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell me
  that I&rsquo;ve got to fire you.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; TRAY-BONG SMITH</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN in prison at Brixton, a man who has no defence and is
  waiting his trial on a charge of murder finds time hanging pretty heavily
  upon his hands. It was due to this ennui of his that &ldquo;Tray-Bong&rdquo;
  Smith, usually an extremely reticent man, condescended to furnish certain
  particulars which enabled the writer to fill in the gaps of this story which
  began for our purpose in Chi So&rsquo;s tea-room, which isn&rsquo;t more than
  a hundred metres from the Quai des Fleurs.</p>

  <p>Chi So was that rarity, a Jap who posed as a Chinee. He ran a restaurant
  in Paris, which, without being fashionable, was popular. People used to come
  across the river to eat the weird messes he prepared, and as many as a dozen
  motor-cars have been seen parked at the end of the narrow street in which
  &ldquo;The Joyous Pedlar&rdquo;&mdash;that was the name of his
  joint&mdash;was situated.</p>

  <p>Tray-Bong Smith had never eaten at Chi So&rsquo;s, but Had been there
  quite a lot. The restaurant was built on a corner lot and was a fairly old
  house. It was probably an inn in the days of Louis, for beneath the building
  was one of the most spacious cellars in Paris. It was a great, vaulted room,
  about thirty feet from the keystone to the floor, and Chi So had turned this
  into what he called a &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; for his regular customers.</p>

  <p>For weeks Tray-Bong Smith had turned into the &ldquo;lounge&rdquo;
  regularly at twelve o&rsquo;clock every night, to bunk down with a pipe and a
  few busy thoughts till four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>There were lots of reasons why he shouldn&rsquo;t wander about Paris at
  night. At this time some sort of international conference was going on, and
  it was impossible to stroll from the Place de la Concorde to the Italiennes
  without falling over a Scotland Yard man who would know him.</p>

  <p>Whether other visitors would have recognised the gaunt unshaven man with
  the shabby suit and the discoloured shirt as the man who won the 100 yards'
  sprint and the long jump at the Oxford and Cambridge Sports is doubtful.
  Certain sections of the police, however, knew him very well indeed.</p>

  <p>In a little cafe in Montmartre where he spent his evenings they had
  christened him &ldquo;Tray-Bong Smith,&rdquo; because of his practice of
  replying to all and sundry who addressed him with this cockneyfied version of
  &ldquo;très bien.&rdquo; Even when he discovered that his French was
  faultless and his &ldquo;tray bong&rdquo; an amusing mannerism, the name
  stuck and it came with him to Chi So&rsquo;s, where he was accounted a
  dangerous man.</p>

  <p>There were days when he counted his sous, days and nights when he would
  disappear from view and come back flush with money, changing thousand-franc
  notes with the nonchalance of a Monte Carlo croupier.</p>

  <p>But when he was visible at all he was a regular attendant at Chi
  So&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>If he was regular in his habits, so was Cæsar Valentine. On Mondays,
  Thursdays, and Saturdays, at two o&rsquo;clock to the minute, he used to make
  his appearance in what the habitues of Chi So&rsquo;s called the private box.
  In one wall, about fifteen feet from the ground, there was a moon-shaped
  opening, in which had been built, either by Chi So or his predecessor, a sort
  of Swiss balcony. It was unlighted and heavily curtained and it was suspected
  that Chi So made quite a respectable income out of letting the box to
  respectable people who wanted to be thrilled by the dope horrors of Paris and
  peregrinating journalists who were writing up Chinatown stories.</p>

  <p>Cæsar Valentine, as a rule, came through a private door direct into the
  cellar, but sometimes he would stalk through the &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; looking
  from side to side with that insolent stare of his, and go out through a small
  door in the wall which communicated, by means of a circular iron staircase,
  with the private box above. And there he would sit for exactly one hour,
  peering down at the smokers, his eyes ranging the whitewashed cavern, which
  with its big Chinese lanterns, its scarlet dado, and the brightly covered
  bunks was not without its picturesque qualities.</p>

  <p>Chi So said that he was a &ldquo;beautiful man,&rdquo; and the description
  was not extravagant. He was invariably in evening dress which fitted him like
  a glove. About six feet in height, with such a face as the old Greek
  sculptors loved to reproduce, his head was covered with a mass of small brown
  curls, slightly&mdash;very slightly&mdash;tinged with grey. The first time
  Tray-Bong Smith saw him he thought he was a man of twenty-eight. The second
  time, when a shaft of light from a torn lantern caught him square, he guessed
  he was nearer fifty. He had big, brown, melancholy eyes, a straight nose, a
  chin a little too rounded for the fastidious taste, and on his cheeks just a
  faint flush of colour.</p>

  <p>The night this story begins, Tray-Bong Smith had turned in at Chi
  So&rsquo;s by the side door which was used by the smokers and taken off his
  mackintosh in the hall. Chi So was there rubbing his hands, a sly and
  detestable little figure, in blue silk blouse and trousers, and he helped him
  off with his coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining, Mr. Thmith?&rdquo; he lisped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like the devil,&rdquo; growled Tray-Bong. &ldquo;A poisonous night,
  even for Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Chi So grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You thmoke plenty to-night, Mr. Thmith. I have thome good thtock in
  from China. Plenty people here to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith grunted a reply and went down the stone stairs and found his bunk.
  Chi always reserved the same bunk for regular customers and Smith&rsquo;s was
  just opposite the &ldquo;private box.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>O San, the pipe man, gave him his instrument of delight, made and lit a
  pill, and then hurried off.</p>

  <p>There was the usual queer lot of people there that night. Society folks, a
  woman or two, the old <i>camelot</i> who sells the story of his life at the
  corner of the Rue Royale, and a gentleman whom Smith recognised as an
  official attached to one of the numerous embassies in Paris. Him he noted for
  future use and profit.</p>

  <p>Old Lefèbre, the camelot, noted the complacent, self-satisfied attitude of
  Tray-Bong and shuffled off to the bunk of a crony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Smit&rsquo; has had a good hunting,&rdquo; he wheezed. &ldquo;He is
  lucky . . . a month ago he came from Enghien with pockets full of mille
  notes, and the body of Tosseau, the racing man was found in the Seine. . . .
  Chi So should keep this place for respectable people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His audience cursed him vilely for interrupting his pleasant dream and the
  camelot went back to his own tangled visions.</p>

  <p>Tray-Bong lay curled up in his bunk, supporting himself on his elbow, and
  dreamt his dreams, which were not the kind of dreams which anybody else in
  the lounge would indulge in.</p>

  <p>At two o&rsquo;clock precisely came Cæsar Valentine, and with him Chi So,
  who usually accompanied him if he came through the lounge. Chi So&rsquo;s
  attitude was servile, his voice a wheedling whine, but Valentine said
  nothing. He strode down between the bunks and paused opposite that on which
  Tray-Bong Smith lay with wide eyes and wakeful.</p>

  <p>Valentine looked for a moment absent-mindedly, and then, turning, walked
  through the door which Chi So had opened and reappeared a little later in the
  gallery. There he sat, his white hands on the plush ledge of the box, his
  chin on the back of his hands, looking down; and it seemed that the unshaven
  Englishman in the bunk below was the principal attraction, for his eyes
  always came back to him.</p>

  <p>At half past two there was a curious stir, a faint chatter of voices from
  the passage-way leading down from the side entrance and the dull sound of
  blows. Then Chi So appeared in a panic and came twittering across the lounge
  to where Tray Bong Smith was lying. Smith was out of the bunk and on his feet
  in an instant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Smit&rsquo; you go quickly; here is the polith&mdash;it
  is for you! Through this door!&rdquo; He indicated the door leading to the
  gallery. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Valentine shall not mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith was through the door in two strides, and, closing it behind him,
  went noiselessly up the narrow iron stairs which led directly into the
  &ldquo;box.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar Valentine turned as he entered, and he spoke for the first time to
  the man who was destined to play so important a part in his life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in trouble?&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At present, no. In a few moments, yes,&rdquo; said Smith, and
  opened his shirt at the front. Cæsar saw the butt of the man&rsquo;s gun
  behind the linen and knew why Tray-Bong invariably lay on his right side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know the way out?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I will show
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled aside a curtain and revealed a rough opening in the wall. Smith
  stepped through and passed along a passage lit by one electric bulb and
  leading apparently, to a blank end.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Straight ahead and then to your right,&rdquo; said the voice of
  Cæsar behind him. &ldquo;The door opens quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fugitive found the door and stepped out into a small courtyard. Cæsar
  Valentine brushed past him, crossed the yard without hesitation, and opening
  another door they found themselves in a side street. It was raining heavily
  and a south-westerly gale was blowing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Cæsar.</p>

  <p>He fastened a big cloak about his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are younger than I and the rain will not hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith grinned in the darkness and loosened the sheath knife he carried in
  his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>Valentine led the way through a labyrinth of alleys, and presently they
  were standing on the deserted quai. Paris was in the throes of a coal famine
  and the lighting had been considerably reduced, which helped, for the quai
  was apparently deserted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Valentine caught his companion by the arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are the person who has the
  ridiculous nickname, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot be answerable for the absurdity of any names which are
  given to me by absurd persons,&rdquo; said Smith a little coldly, and
  Valentine laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tray-Bong Smith?&rdquo; he asked, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought so.&rdquo; Valentine was satisfied. &ldquo;Only I
  did not wish to make a mistake. Not that it is possible that I can make
  mistakes,&rdquo; he added, and the man at his side thought at first that he
  was jesting, but he was serious enough.</p>

  <p>Along the quai Smith could see two dim lights and guessed that these
  belonged to Valentine&rsquo;s motor-car.</p>

  <p>He walked on, a little ahead of the exquisite, toward the car and was less
  than fifty feet from safety when a man came out of the darkness, gripped him
  by the coat and swung him round as he flashed an electric lamp in his
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said in French. &ldquo;Tray-Bong Smith,
  <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas?</i> I want you, my ancient!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Valentine stopped dead and shrunk back into the shadows, watching.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did Tray-Bong Smith hesitate, then with a swift movement
  of his hand he knocked the lamp from the man&rsquo;s hand. In another second
  he had gripped his assailant by the throat and had thrust him back against
  the grey stone parapet behind which the Seine flowed swiftly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want me, eh?&rdquo; he said between his teeth, and Valentine
  saw the quick rise and fall of a glittering blade.</p>

  <p>The man relaxed his grip and slid limply to the ground.</p>

  <p>Smith looked round to left and right, then stooping, lifted the fallen man
  bodily in his arms and flung him across the parapet into the river.</p>

  <p>Only one groan came from the victim, and something amused Tray-Bong Smith,
  for he laughed as he picked his knife from the pavement and threw it after
  the man into the stream.</p>

  <p>Valentine had not moved until the knife was sent flying. Then he came
  forward and Smith could hear his quick breathing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are rapid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said no more than this and walked rapidly toward the car and opened the
  door. The chauffeur could not have seen what had happened, for the quai was
  badly lit&mdash;but there may have been some other spectator. The car moved
  forward until it came almost abreast of the spot where the struggle had
  occurred. Smith thought he saw someone on the pavement, and dropped the
  rain-blurred window to look. The car was moving slowly, and the headlamps of
  the car had only just flashed out their fullest radiance.</p>

  <p>In the light of the lamps was a girl. She was dressed from head to foot in
  black, and stood peering over the parapet into the dark river. As the car
  came up to her she turned her head and the man had a momentary glimpse of the
  saddest and most beautiful face he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>His shoulders were out of the window and he was looking back, when he felt
  Valentine&rsquo;s hand clutch him and pull him back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; he said savagely, &ldquo;what are you doing? Whom
  were you looking at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said Smith, and pulled up the window.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF CÆSAR</h2>

  <p class="first">CÆSAR VALENTINE had several houses and flats in or near
  Paris. Of this fact Tray-Bong Smith was well aware. He thought at first that
  he was being taken to Valentine&rsquo;s beautiful apartments on the Boulevard
  Victor Hugo, but the car went straight across the Place de l&rsquo;Étoile,
  and sped down the Avenue of the Grande Armée.</p>

  <p>It was difficult on such a night to know in what direction they were
  going, but after a while it was apparent to Smith, from the violent nature of
  the road, that they were going in the direction of Maisons Laffitte.
  Presently the car turned into what seemed to be a side lane with high hedges
  on either side. The car bumped and jolted slowly for ten minutes over what
  could not have been anything better than a cart track, then turned abruptly
  to the left and through a dilapidated gate.</p>

  <p>It was too dark to see the house, and when the car stopped and
  Valentine&rsquo;s guest descended he had no time to make any observations. It
  was a fairly big chateau; how big Smith could not tell, for Cæsar opened the
  door with extraordinary quickness and ushered him into a large dark hall. He
  switched on an electric light, and the stranger had time to observe a broad
  flight of stairs leading out of the hall before he was hurried across the
  parquet floor through another door into a large saloon.</p>

  <p>It was one of the few rooms in private houses that deserve the name of
  saloon. It was lofty and spacious, its walls panelled with white wood, its
  ceilings were beautifully carved in the Moorish fashion, and illumination
  came from two rich electroliers. The furniture (observed Smith) was not only
  magnificent, but regal.</p>

  <p>It is queer what things impress one. Smith always remembered that saloon
  by its carpet&mdash;an immense expanse of purple, heavily embroidered in
  gold, the ornamentation consisting of fleurs-de-lis and a cipher
  &ldquo;C.&rdquo; The next thing that impressed him was a beautiful
  coat-of-arms above the big open fireplace. Two of its four quarterings held
  the lily of France, one, three gold bars, and the fourth a bull upon a golden
  ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Cæsar imperiously. &ldquo;You would like a
  little wine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pressed aside one of the panels of the wall and took out a tray
  containing bottle and glasses. These he carried to the visitor and placed on
  the table by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said curtly, and Smith poured out a stiff glass of
  whisky.</p>

  <p>Cæsar took off his wet cloak and flung it on the back of the chair,
  strolled to the fireplace, switched on an electric radiator, and stood with
  his back to the glow, surveying the other quizzically.</p>

  <p>An imposing figure was Valentine in his immaculate evening dress. Smith
  approved the snowy white shirt-front and the three pearl studs, the thin
  platinum chain stretched across the white waistcoat, and guessed the reason
  for the little mocking smile that curled Cæsar&rsquo;s fine lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend, Tray-Bong Smith,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;have you
  ever seen a man guillotined?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Half a dozen,&rdquo; said the other promptly. &ldquo;On to the
  board, head in the kang!* Snick! Head in basket! Vive la France!&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* kang (<i>sic</i>): presumably meaning <i>"lunette"</i>
  i.e., the wooden frame used to fix the head during execution by
  guillotine.]</p>

  <p>Valentine frowned as though he were annoyed at the flippancy in the tone
  of his guest. Then he laughed and nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the man I want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is
  the attitude to adopt toward life. But never forget, Smith, that you must not
  laugh at authority. Authority is sublime, beyond ridicule, cruel, unjust,
  tragic, but never humorous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith was slipping off his wet coat as the other spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put it before the fire,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Better still,
  throw it out through that door.&rdquo; He pointed to a door to the right of
  the fireplace. &ldquo;Madonna Beatrice will see to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith obeyed him to the letter, wondering who might be Madonna Beatrice.
  Suddenly Cæsar looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there any blood on your hands?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I aimed at the fifth intercostal space,&rdquo; he said calmly.
  &ldquo;There would be little blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar nodded approvingly as his companion examined his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not taken much opium to-night,&rdquo; he said. He stepped
  toward the man and peered into his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never take opium,&rdquo; said Tray-Bong coolly. &ldquo;I do not
  go to Chi So&rsquo;s to smoke, but to watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Cæsar laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An admirable lieutenant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you must not be
  too clever with me, Smith. I have taken a great risk for you. And let me tell
  you that I also came to Chi So&rsquo;s to watch, and to watch you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith had guessed that already, but said nothing. &ldquo;To watch
  you,&rdquo; Cæsar repeated. &ldquo;Chi So&rsquo;s business was built on my
  money. The place is useful to me. He tells me news that I want to hear, and
  when I learnt that an English criminal was hiding in Paris from the police,
  that he was wanted for murder in America and for forgery and divers other
  sordid and stupid crimes, we became interested in you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; repeated Smith, and again Cæsar frowned and changed the
  trend of his observations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not approve of crime, your kind of crime. It is stupid and
  small and leads nowhere but to the guillotine or the gallows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith might have offered his own views on crime, but at that moment the
  door opened slowly and a man entered. He was a little, red-haired man, and
  his ruddiness extended to his face, which was flaming. Somehow he matched
  neither Cæsar nor the saloon, for he was showily dressed; a heavy gold
  watch-chain dangled from his waistcoat pocket and his attitude was defiant.
  Smith, a student of men, guessed that he had been drinking, and was not
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Ernest, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ernest advanced unsteadily into the room and glanced from Cæsar to the
  watchful Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;Got a visitor, eh?&rdquo; The
  voice was coarse and uneducated, and it came to the visitor in the nature of
  a shock that he should speak so familiarly to his immaculate host.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a visitor,&rdquo; said Cæsar softly.</p>

  <p>For a moment the little man said nothing, then clearing his throat:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re going to-morrow, are you?&rdquo; repeated Cæsar in
  a mild tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to London. Any objection?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar shook his head and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know where to send my salary, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the
  little man.</p>

  <p>Cæsar licked his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your salary? I thought you were leaving my employment?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know where to send my salary, I suppose?&rdquo; said the little
  man in a tone of menace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a ten years&rsquo;
  holiday.&rdquo; He laughed at his own humour. &ldquo;A ten years&rsquo;
  holiday,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, ain&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m to send you your salary for ten years, eh?&rdquo;
  said Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; threatened the
  man. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been here doing your dirty work for three years
  for nothing. Let <i>him</i> do it!&rdquo; He nodded to Smith. &ldquo;See how
  he likes it. I could write a book about you, Mr. Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And it would be very interesting, I&rsquo;m sure. And have you
  waited up all the evening to tell me this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. I&rsquo;ve got a lot to tell you, and I should tell
  you some more if that man wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep it until the morning,&rdquo; said Cæsar, dropping his hand
  good-humouredly on the other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Go back to bed, my
  friend, and ask Madonna Beatrice to come to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madonna Beatrice!&rdquo; sneered the other. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
  beauty, she is!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The visitor thought he saw Cæsar&rsquo;s face go pink, but the big man
  laughed softly to himself, and walking slowly to the door, he very gently
  pushed his unruly servitor forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a curious characteristic of servants,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;that they invariably imagine they know their masters&rsquo; guilty
  secrets. You have probably had a similar experience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never keep servants who share my secrets,&rdquo; said Smith,
  &ldquo;and to this fact I ascribe my freedom and well-being.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a gentle tap at the door and Cæsar turned quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Madonna,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>The woman who entered piqued the visitor&rsquo;s curiosity. Cæsar had a
  reputation for affairs. It was a reputation not particularly creditable to
  himself. Smith had expected to see a young and beautiful girl, but the woman
  who came in had no claim to beauty. She was an old woman, squat and fat, her
  face was dark and disfigured with tiny warts. Her grey-black hair was brushed
  back smoothly from her head and gathered in a bun behind; and to add to her
  grotesqueness she was dressed in a robe of bright emerald-green, cut square
  at the breast. About her neck was a huge gold necklace of barbaric design,
  and her fat hands were covered with jewels. Yet, old as she was, and
  laughable as was her get-up, there was something about her poise that spoke
  of strength and power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; said Cæsar softly, and he spoke in liquid Spanish,
  &ldquo;our friend here is staying with us for some time. Will you see that
  his room is made ready for him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at Smith with her heavy eyes and nodded. But he had discovered
  something which interested him more than her fantastic attire. He was looking
  at her foot, that observant man, and saw that she was wearing thick boots.
  Moreover they were wet and muddy, as though she had been wandering in the
  storm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Si, senor,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>The visitor wondered why the man called her &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; which
  is an Italian form of address, when he had spoken to her in Spanish. Cæsar,
  who was an extraordinary mind-reader, answered his unspoken query when she
  had gone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madonna Beatrice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is both Spanish and
  Italian, as I will explain to you one of these days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made no further reference to the events of the night, but chatted
  pleasantly enough on crime in the abstract.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The little criminal is a deplorable object,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I cite, for example, my friend Ernest. Ernest is a blackguard, a
  card-sharper, and a thief. I took him into my service and brought him to
  France at a moment when the police were searching for him and when he would
  certainly have gone to penal servitude for a number of years. If he had been
  a greater criminal, he would have had a greater mind and a greater heart.
  Also he would have been on his knees to me all his life, for he has lived
  luxuriously, he has money to spend at the races&mdash;I have even had him
  taught French.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Money doesn&rsquo;t buy loyalty, anyway,&rdquo; said Smith
  curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; nodded Cæsar. &ldquo;And yet money buys most of the
  things that are desirable in this world. It even buys the appearance and the
  consequences of loyalty. Money buys allies in war, and a little more money
  would buy their desertion. It could buy my election to the Senate of France
  if I were a French-man&mdash;and if I did not hate the French,&rdquo; he
  added. &ldquo;With money I could sit in this house and re-shape the future of
  Europe. With money you can buy factions and parties and nations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sighed and, turning his back on the other, looked earnestly at the
  coat-of-arms above the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whose arms are those?&rdquo; asked Smith unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; He swung round. &ldquo;Whose arms? You are not a student
  of heraldry? No? Some day I will tell you. Money is everything, and it is so
  easy to secure. Observe me! At nineteen I was penniless. I have never worked,
  I have never speculated, I have never gambled, yet to-day I am a rich man,
  because God gave me a brain.&rdquo; He tapped his forehead. &ldquo;Because I
  am attractive to women, because I am a genius without scruple&mdash;and you
  cannot be a genius and have scruple.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He broke off the conversation as abruptly as before and led the way out
  into the hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your room is ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrow we will
  discuss your future. It would not be wise of you to stay in France, and,
  moreover, I need you in England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The room into which he showed his guest was furnished simply but
  expensively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would like tea in the morning, of course. You are
  English,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will find all the necessities of your
  toilet on your dressing-table, and the Madonna will have put you
  pyjamas&mdash;ah yes, there they are. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE CHAINED LADY</h2>

  <p class="first">TRAY-BONG SMITH stood stock-still listening to Cæsar&rsquo;s
  retiring footsteps. Then he examined the room minutely and carefully. There
  was no lock to the door and no bolt, but that did not greatly worry him.
  Cæsar would not have brought him to Maisons Laffitte to betray him, he was
  sure of that. He sat down in one of the two deep chairs which stood on either
  side of the shuttered fireplace and pulled off his boots, speculating on the
  plans of his new employer.</p>

  <p>For just what reason had Cæsar taken him under his wing? Cæsar had
  witnessed the affair on the Quai des Fleurs and knew that by harbouring the
  man who had committed the act he had rendered himself guilty by the laws of
  France.</p>

  <p>The project ahead must be of vast importance or Cæsar would not have run
  the risk. If the girl had seen&mdash;the girl in black whom Smith had seen
  peering into the river. She must have seen, or why would she have been
  standing on that spot, leaning over the parapet?</p>

  <p>Smith rubbed his chin and frowned. The girl might spoil everything.
  Suppose she went to the police and a newspaper got hold of the story of this
  midnight struggle? He swore to himself as he unlaced his wet boots, slipped
  off his wet clothes, unbuckled the canvas strap which supported the little
  Colt automatic he carried under his shirt, and put the pistol beneath the
  pillow.</p>

  <p>The silk pyjamas which had been left for him were rather long in the leg,
  but he turned them up, and, switching out the light, pulled aside the heavy
  velvet curtains which covered the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>The windows were of the French type which open outward, and these he swung
  wide. There was an easy drop from the window to a flower-bed beneath, so that
  there was no need to worry about a get-away. The rain had ceased and the
  clouds had thinned, though the wind still blew gustily. There was a full
  moon, faintly visible, and in the occasional gleam which lit the countryside
  he was able to take his immediate bearings. That glow in the sky was Paris,
  and if he was near Maisons Laffitte he was due south-west of the city.</p>

  <p>By the light of the moon he looked at the watch on his wrist. It was a
  quarter past three. In two hours the day would break, but he was not sleepy.
  He went back to the window to fix in his mind the exact lay of the ground.
  Immediately facing the window was a broad lawn which ran into the shadows of
  a poplar plantation. To the left he glimpsed the yellow of the drive which
  led to the lane up which he had bumped, and to the main road.</p>

  <p>He lay down on the bed and covered himself with the eiderdown, but he was
  not in the least tired. He lay there thinking about Cæsar and speculating
  upon the future, wondering just what game Cæsar was after and to what purpose
  he intended putting his new protégé.</p>

  <p>A distant clock chimed four, and he was beginning to doze, when he heard a
  sound which brought him wide awake again. It was a queer tinkling sound, like
  the drip-drip of a faucet, and it was some time before he located it as being
  outside of the window. It was the dripping of rain, of course, he told
  himself&mdash;a gutter overflowing on to a window-sill; but nevertheless he
  slipped from the bed and stole softly to the window, for Tray-Bong Smith was
  a suspicious man.</p>

  <p>At first he saw nothing, though most of the clouds had disappeared and the
  moon was shining brightly. Then he saw a sight so eerie, so unexpected, as to
  bring his heart to his throat.</p>

  <p>Walking across the broad lawn was the figure of a woman. She was dressed
  in grey or white&mdash;he could not be certain which&mdash;and she appeared
  to be carrying something in her hand. Smith could not see what that something
  was until she turned and walked back again with the moon on her face, and
  then he heard the jingle of steel plainly. He shaded his eyes from the
  moonbeams and cautiously put his head round the side of the window.</p>

  <p>The woman was walking with curiously short steps, and this mincing gait at
  such an hour was so unreal and so grotesquely unnatural that he might have
  guessed the cause. Her walk brought her to within twenty yards of the window,
  and then Tray-Bong Smith saw and heard.</p>

  <p>Clink, clink, clink!</p>

  <p>Her hands were handcuffed together, and between her two ankles was a steel
  chain that jingled as she walked.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; whispered Smith.</p>

  <p>As he stared at her, he heard a low voice, commanding and surly. It
  sounded as though it came from the shadow of the trees, and the woman turned
  and walked in that direction. Smith watched her until she disappeared, and
  then went back to his bed, a considerably puzzled man.</p>

  <p>But the amazing happenings of the night were not completed. He had begun
  to doze again when he was awakened by a shriek&mdash;a shriek accompanied by
  a crash against the bedroom door, that brought him to his feet, gun in hand.
  The grey of dawn was in the sky, and there was just enough light to see the
  door moving slowly inward.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden it burst open and somebody fell into the room with a
  thud, gibbering and sobbing hideously. It made an attempt to rise and poised
  a moment totteringly on its knees, and Smith recognised him.</p>

  <p>It was the red-haired man, the man called Ernest, but his face was no
  longer scarlet. It was grey and drawn and horrible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar, Cæsar!&rdquo; he whispered, and then collapsed in a
  heap.</p>

  <p>Then came a sound of hurrying feet, and Cæsar came into the room. He was
  in his dressing-gown and pyjamas, and had apparently just wakened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, and looked down. &ldquo;Ernest! What
  are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook the inanimate figure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; this man&rsquo;s drunk again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He lifted him in his strong arms as easily as though he were a child.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo; he said, and laid him on the bed. &ldquo;Put on
  the light, will you, Smith?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tray-Bong Smith obeyed, and Cæsar, bending over the man, looked down at
  his wide-opened eyes. Then he turned to the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said soberly. &ldquo;What a perfectly
  dreadful thing to have happened!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; CÆSAR REVEALS HIMSELF</h2>

  <p class="first">THIS, then, was the introduction of Tray-Bong Smith to the
  house of Cæsar Valentine&mdash;an unfortunate introduction if the police came
  to make enquiries as to this sudden death. But the man Ernest&mdash;his other
  name was Goldberg&mdash;was notoriously subject to fits. He was, moreover,
  given to alcoholic excess, and on two occasions Cæsar had had to send for the
  local doctor to prescribe for his retainer.</p>

  <p>What had happened to the man in the night Smith could only guess. It is
  certain that he had some sort of an attack in the early hours of the morning,
  had dragged himself downstairs to the visitor&rsquo;s room&mdash;why to his
  room? Cæsar explained. The room Smith had taken was one which he had usually
  occupied, and the man&rsquo;s words &ldquo;Cæsar, Cæsar!&rdquo; addressed to
  Tray-Bong had been intended for his host.</p>

  <p>There were the usual inquiries, and the man from Chi So&rsquo;s was amazed
  to discover how readily the authorities accepted Cæsar&rsquo;s explanation.
  Whilst the visiting magistrate was in the house, Smith was hidden in a little
  room in a small tower at one corner of the building. The silent Madonna
  Beatrice brought him his meals, and if there were servants in the house the
  visitor did not see them.</p>

  <p>He was permitted to enter the great saloon that night, and found Cæsar
  smoking a long cigar and reading a book of poems. He looked up as Smith
  entered and motioned him to a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you out of France in a day or two,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;That matter didn&rsquo;t get on to your nerves, I presume? It is very
  unfortunate, very unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunate for all of us,&rdquo; said Smith, taking a cigarette
  from the table and lighting it. &ldquo;You saw him after I went to bed, of
  course?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;of course &rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he died,&rdquo; replied Smith brutally. &ldquo;You saw him
  and had a drink with him&mdash;and he died.&rdquo; Valentine said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; he asked after a while, and
  looked the other straight in the eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For three years I have been a medical student,&rdquo; drawled the
  guest, &ldquo;and in the course of that three years I made acquaintance with
  a drug which is used extensively by oculists. It is a deadly poison, but,
  unlike other deadly poisons, leaves no trace&mdash;except one, which I looked
  for in the unfortunate Ernest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar&rsquo;s lips curled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was it present?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded and Cæsar laughed. He was genuinely amused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better see Monsieur the Magistrate,&rdquo; he said
  mockingly, &ldquo;and reveal your suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a very excellent reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
  the gunman coolly, &ldquo;only I think it is right, as between you and me,
  that there should be no pretence. Put your cards on the table as I&rsquo;ve
  already put mine."</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You put your card in the Seine,&rdquo; said Valentine drily,
  &ldquo;and you did not even send a wreath, as I have done for
  Ernest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose quickly and began to pace the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall see all my cards in time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I need
  such a man as you&mdash;a man without heart or mercy. Some day I will tell
  you a great secret.&rdquo; Smith was looking at him with a curious
  expression. Shaved and clad in a suit which Cæsar had found for him, this man
  from the opium den, this knifer of police agents was an intellectual of
  twenty-seven, not ill-looking by any means.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you your secret now,&rdquo; said Smith, speaking
  slowly, and pointed to the coat-of-arms above the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Why are
  those arms in this house?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why are this cypher and
  these fleurs-de-lis embroidered in your carpet, Mr. Valentine? I don&rsquo;t
  know whether you are a madman, or whether you're sane,&rdquo; Smith spoke in
  that slow drawl of his. &ldquo;If may be just a form of megalomania, and
  I&rsquo;ve seen pretensions almost as extravagant. But I think I&rsquo;ve got
  you down fine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are the arms?&rdquo; asked Valentine steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are the arms of Cæsar Borgia,&rdquo; replied the other.
  &ldquo;A bull on a gold ground is the family arms of the Borgias; the C in
  the carpet was the Borgias&rsquo; cypher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had stopped his pacing and stood now, his head bent forward, his
  narrowed eyes fixed on Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am neither a madman nor a vainglorious fool,&rdquo; he said
  quietly. &ldquo;It is true I am the last in the direct line of that
  illustrious man, Cæsar Borgia, Duke of the Valentinois.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith did not speak for a long time. He had enough to think upon. In his
  early days at Oxford he had posed as an authority on the Renaissance, and
  knew the history of the Borgias backwards. In his old rooms, before things
  smashed to pieces and the lanes of life so violently turned, he had had a
  copy of a cartoon reputedly by da Vinci, inscribed &ldquo;Cæsar Borgia de
  France, Duke of Valentinois, Count of Diois and Issaudun, Pontifical Vicar of
  Imola and Forli.&rdquo; And now he recalled the same bold, womanish face in
  the man who stood looking down at him, enjoying the sensation he had
  caused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Cæsar at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said Smith vacantly; then, &ldquo;from what
  branch of the family do you descend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Through Giralamo,&rdquo; replied Cæsar quickly. &ldquo;Giralamo was
  Cæsar&rsquo;s one son. After Cæsar&rsquo;s fall he was taken to France,
  through France to Spain, and was educated by the Spanish Cardinals. He
  married, and his son went to South America and fought in Peru. The family
  settled in the Americas for two centuries. My grandfather came to England as
  a boy, and I myself was educated in England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; said Smith, and felt that it was a
  feeble thing to say.</p>

  <p>So they stood confronting one another, the man from Chi So&rsquo;s, he of
  the hard-counted sous and the periodical bursts of prosperity, the hired
  assassin and the descendant of Alexander VI&mdash;this was the situation that
  appealed so powerfully to Cæsar and made him thrill with the wonder of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>To men and women too, before now, he had revealed himself, but they had
  been clods to whom the word Borgia meant nothing; conjured up no pictures of
  ducal magnificence or pontifical power.</p>

  <p>Smith knew and appreciated the splendour of the revelation. He was
  genuinely inspired by the other&rsquo;s confidence and would have pushed
  enquiries which in Cæsar&rsquo;s then generous spirit must have been
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>It was the Madonna Beatrice who snapped the tension. She came hurriedly
  into the saloon without knocking, and Cæsar, at the sight of her face, walked
  across to meet her. There was a conversation in low tones. Cæsar uttered an
  exclamation of surprise, and then he looked round at his companion
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring her in,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Bring her in?</p>

  <p>Smith was alert now. Was he to see that mysterious apparition about whom
  he intended in good time to tackle Cæsar? Or was it some inamorata of
  his&mdash;his question was answered almost before it was framed.</p>

  <p>Madonna Beatrice waddled back into the room, and at her heels followed a
  tall, straight girl, so beautiful that she took the man&rsquo;s breath
  away.</p>

  <p>She looked from Cæsar to him and back again to Cæsar, her head held high,
  something of disdain in her attitude, and then she came slowly across to
  where Cæsar stood and brushed his cheek with her lips.</p>

  <p>Smith looked at Cæsar. There was a smile in his eyes which indicated
  amusement and annoyance. Then he turned to his new-found friend and stretched
  out his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stephanie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Mr. Smith. Smith&mdash;I
  want you to meet&mdash;my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His daughter! Smith&rsquo;s mouth opened in an involuntary grimace of
  surprise, and then, recovering himself, he held out his hand, which she took.
  Her steady eyes fixed him for a spell, and then she turned away. &ldquo;When
  did you come to Paris?&rdquo; asked Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; said the girl, and the man Smith could have gasped
  again at the lie, for she was the girl in black who had stood upon the Quai
  des Fleurs the night before and had seen him throw the detective into the
  Seine. That she had been a witness he knew when he looked into her eyes.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; CÆSAR TELLS OF NUMBER SIX</h2>

  <p class="first">TRAY-BONG SMITH was a light sleeper, but he did not hear
  Cæsar Valentine come into his room at four o&rsquo;clock next morning. As he
  felt a hand grip his shoulder he twisted round and he heard Cæsar&rsquo;s
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cannot turn so that you can use the pistol under your pillow,
  my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be lamentable if I died as a
  result of that kind of accident.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing is wrong,&rdquo; replied his host. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
  brought your clothes.&rdquo; He himself was in his dressing-gown. &ldquo;I
  think they will fit you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He must have been in the room some time, for afterwards the visitor found
  new garments lying neatly folded on two chairs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The heavy overcoat I bought in Paris yesterday,&rdquo; said Cæsar;
  &ldquo;you will need that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; Smith demanded lazily as he slipped out
  of bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A friend of mine is going to London&mdash;a young aviator who
  travels between France and England for his own pleasure. He has kindly given
  you a seat in his machine, and I have arranged the passport, which you will
  find in your coat-pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To London&mdash;what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait for me,&rdquo; said Cæsar, &ldquo;and apply yourself
  diligently to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His keen ear heard a footfall in the passage, and he went out and returned
  with a tray on which a breakfast was laid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Madonna Beatrice,&rdquo; he explained, and closed the door
  behind him. &ldquo;What are you to do in London? I will tell you, my friend.
  I intended telling you last night, but the unexpected arrival of&mdash;my
  daughter&rdquo;&mdash;he paused before the description&mdash;&ldquo;made it
  impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not know you had a daughter. You don&rsquo;t look old enough
  to have a girl of that age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; he said, and did not seem inclined to pursue
  the subject. &ldquo;In London&mdash;by the way, is there any reason why you
  should not go to London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I have a perfectly
  clean bill&mdash;in England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar dismissed the subject with a courteous gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In London you will stay at the Bilton Hotel,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You will communicate with me at an address which you will find in a
  small notebook I have also put in your pocket. But you will avoid meeting me
  unless there is an absolute necessity. Your task &rdquo;&mdash;he spoke
  slowly&mdash;&ldquo;is, as I said before, to find Number Six.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Number Six?&rdquo; Smith stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scotland Yard is a great institution,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I
  have every respect for its personnel, but not a tremendous amount for its
  methods. For some reason&rdquo;&mdash;he had seated himself on the edge of
  the bed and was watching his guest taking breakfast&mdash;&ldquo;Scotland
  Yard is suspicious of me. I have spent a lot of time and a lot of money in
  England, and Scotland Yard does not know exactly where it comes from. In
  addition, there have been one or two unfortunate incidents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith did not ask what those unfortunate incidents were, nor did his
  employer volunteer any information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am one of those men,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;who like to know
  the worst quickly. It worries me when I cannot see my opponent&rsquo;s hand.
  And I spend a great deal of money in discovering just what kind of
  difficulties I am likely to meet with. I have had a man in the Clerks&rsquo;
  Department at Scotland Yard for a considerable time; and nearly a year ago
  this man communicated with me, informing me that the Commissioner of the
  Criminal Intelligence Bureau had commissioned an agent to watch me and
  examine my private life.&rdquo; Smith clicked his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And this watching
  gentleman&mdash;is he Number Six?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He or she is Number Six,&rdquo; he repeated gravely. &ldquo;Whether
  it is a man or a woman I have been unable to discover. The person is
  described as Number Six in the records&mdash;there is some reason for the
  secrecy. Scotland Yard believes that I am a sinister individual, and it is
  remarkable that the agent they have chosen is not an ordinary member of the
  police force, but some enemy of mine&mdash;or rather, some person who regards
  himself or herself as my enemy, for&mdash;er&mdash;private reasons. There
  are, of course &rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;people
  who hate me. There is a man named Welland. You will find his address in the
  book. I have not met the gentleman recently, but twenty years ago I met his
  wife.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I think she was happier with me than she was
  with him&mdash;for a while,&rdquo; he added.</p>

  <p>Smith yawned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If this is a love-story, spare me,&rdquo; he said; but the other
  seemed lost in a reverie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately she died, and his child, who came with her, also
  died. It was unfortunate.&rdquo; Cæsar leant his chin on his palms and looked
  at the floor, thinking deeply. &ldquo;It was unfortunate,&rdquo; he said, and
  looked up quickly. &ldquo;Welland is in some form of Government service. He
  has told an associate that he will kill me; but that, of course, does not
  worry me. He may or may not be Number Six. You will be astute enough to
  discover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there anybody else?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are the relatives of a certain Mr. Gale,&rdquo; said Cæsar
  thoughtfully. &ldquo;Mr. Gale was associated with me in business. Things went
  wrong and Mr. Gale&mdash;committed suicide. It was unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded again. He had heard of Mr. Gale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember the case, though I didn&rsquo;t associate you with it.
  Gale was a bank manager, and after his death it was discovered that some
  hundred thousand pounds had disappeared from the funds of the
  bank.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was unfortunate,&rdquo; repeated Cæsar. &ldquo;People knew that
  I had had some dealings with him, and his wife made rather a painful scene.
  She accused me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged again. &ldquo;She died a
  little time afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man from Chi So&rsquo;s flung the question brutally, and Cæsar smiled
  and dropped his hand on the questioner&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a man after my own heart,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He went away soon after to dress, for he had to conduct his man to the
  private aviation field where his friend was waiting. It was doubtful whether
  the pilot had any stronger sense of friendship for Cæsar than the payment of
  handsome fee could ensure, but he was a good pilot, and Tray-Bong Smith
  landed at Croydon in time for a second breakfast and on the whole was glad to
  be back in England.</p>

  <p>Excessive sentimentality was not to be expected from a member of Mr.
  Smith&rsquo;s profession for all his youth and for a certain refinement of
  mind he had displayed, yet he left France with just the faintest hint of an
  ache in his heart. Perhaps &ldquo;ache&rdquo; is rather a strong word for an
  unsatisfied desire. He had hoped to see the girl again&mdash;Stephanie, of
  the Secret. He carried with him an impression of her no less vivid because it
  had been taken in a flash&mdash;an impression of grey-blue eyes, of a
  complexion as clear as milk, of faultless features, and of lips so red that
  he had thought for a second they had been &ldquo;made up.&rdquo; Mr. Smith
  was not of the impressionable kind, but this impression had just stayed with
  him in his mind and in his heart, though they had not exchanged more than
  half a dozen words.</p>

  <p>The daughter of Cæsar! Tray-Bong laughed. An offspring of the Borgias!
  More beautiful than her greatly advertised ancestor Lucrezia&mdash;that poor,
  simpering, colourless thing, who had achieved a place in history to which
  neither her talents nor her spurious iniquities entitled her.</p>

  <p>He dismissed Stephanie from his mind with an effort, and concentrated upon
  the errand which Cæsar had chosen for him. He was completely puzzled by
  Cæsar&rsquo;s choice of hotel. The Bilton is not only fashionable, but
  conspicuous. If he had been sent to one of the small caravanserais in
  Bloomsbury, where a man falls readily into oblivion, he could have better
  understood; or to one of the big hotels where everybody is nobody, that would
  have been understandable. But Bilton&rsquo;s Hotel was neither inexpensive
  nor obscure. It is situated near Cork Street and frequented by men and women
  of the leisured classes&mdash;the very place where a man was likely to run
  across people who had seen him in Paris or in Rome, or had known him before
  disgrace had fallen upon his name.</p>

  <p>When he reached the hotel, he found that not only had his room been
  reserved for him, but that Cæsar had instructed the manager as to what room
  he should occupy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be able to put your things into forty-one until the
  afternoon, sir,&rdquo; said the manager (which was the first intimation Mr.
  Smith had that No. 41 had been reserved at all). &ldquo;The room is still in
  the occupation of the gentleman who is leaving by this afternoon&rsquo;s
  train.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took Tray-Bong aside and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I hope you
  don&rsquo;t mind my asking you a personal question,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You are not&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; He seemed at loss for a word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Smith, interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a noisy sleeper? Excuse my asking, sir. I mean,
  you don&rsquo;t snore?&rdquo; said the manager.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that I am aware of.&rdquo; Mr. Smith was secretly amused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ask you because Mr. Ross is so particular, and he&rsquo;s been a
  client of ours now for thirty years, and it happens that he sleeps in the
  next room to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Ross? Who&rsquo;s Mr. Ross?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>The manager was surprised apparently there existed one benighted heathen
  in the City of London who did not know Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross was an American
  millionaire&mdash;not only a millionaire, but a millionaire several times
  over. He was a bachelor and eccentric, a difficult man and a not particularly
  generous man, Smith gathered. He spent most of his day at the Reform Club,
  and though he had lived in and about England for thirty years he had no
  friends. Moreover, he occupied the next room, No. 40.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A millionaire who has no friends must be rather a curiosity,&rdquo;
  said Smith, and agreed not to snore.</p>

  <p>Cæsar had supplied him well with money, and his first call that day was
  upon a tailor in Bond Street. After he had been measured and had given his
  orders for a fairly extensive wardrobe, he strolled down to the Strand. He
  had not been in London for twelve months, and the sight and the smell of it
  were lovely to his senses.</p>

  <p>It was at the junction of the Strand with Trafalgar Square that he met the
  one man in London he did not desire to meet. Smith saw him some distance
  away, but made no attempt to avoid him.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking Hallett, of the Criminal Investigation Bureau; a
  peak-faced man, with white, unruly hair and heavy grey moustache; it was not
  a face one could forget. Tray-Bong was passing him, but Hallett stood still
  in his path.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said in that paternal way of his. &ldquo;Back in
  London, Mr. Tray-Bong Smith?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Back in London, Chief,&rdquo; said Smith cheerily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing queer stories about you,&rdquo; said
  Hallett. &ldquo;Murders and robberies in galore.&rdquo; There was a twinkle
  in his eye, and a twinkle in Hallett&rsquo;s eye did not necessarily bode
  well for any man. &ldquo;Be careful, my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There
  may be very serious trouble for you. Don&rsquo;t say I did not warn
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;But if there is going to be any bad
  trouble for me, there are going to be some very serious happenings for other
  people. And if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d rather not be seen talking to
  you, Chief&mdash;it gets a fellow a bad name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallett chuckled grimly and passed on.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE STORY OF WELLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">SMITH went on his way to the Strand. It had struck him as
  being rather remarkable that Cæsar had given him the addresses with
  instructions to pursue enquiries which he could have had made by any private
  enquiry firm in London. After all, it was only necessary that they should
  supply him with the movements of the suspected persons, and furnish him with
  sufficient material to prove or disprove the truth of his theory. But there
  were quite a number of things Mr. Smith did not understand.</p>

  <p>On the riverside of the Strand and running parallel with that famous
  thoroughfare is John Street, and it was to 104 John Street that he directed
  his steps. This was the address which he had found in the little book against
  the name of Welland.</p>

  <p>It was an old-fashioned Adam&rsquo;s house, and, scrutinising it from the
  opposite pavement, Smith came to the conclusion that, whoever might have
  occupied it twenty years ago, it was now one of those genteel tenements which
  abound in the West End. The different pattern of curtains and blinds on each
  floor strengthened this conclusion, which was confirmed when he crossed the
  road and found a little pearl button labelled &ldquo;Housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The janitor was an old gentleman of sixty or seventy&mdash;a cheerful old
  soul who wore the faded ribbon of the '81 African campaign on his
  waistcoat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland?&rdquo; he said in surprise. &ldquo;Good Lord, no! Mr.
  Welland doesn&rsquo;t live here. Why, he&rsquo;s been gone&mdash;let me see,
  it must be nigh on twenty years ago. Well, that&rsquo;s a curious thing, your
  asking after Mr. Welland!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith thought it was curious too, but asked:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why is it curious?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man hesitated a moment, then said, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and led
  the way down to a basement kitchen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you know Mr. Welland?&rdquo; asked Tray-Bong, when they reached
  the janitor&rsquo;s cosy little apartment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; he said contemptuously. &ldquo;As well as I know
  my own hand. As nice a man as ever I met, Mr. Welland was. He had the three
  upper floors.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Ah! it was very sad, very sad
  indeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the whole story,&rdquo; said Smith with
  truth.</p>

  <p>It was true, too, that he had never taken Cæsar wholly at his word. If he
  was a true Borgia, he was a liar, an exploiter of his friends, treacherous to
  his enemies, and wholly unreliable. Cæsar was using him&mdash;well and good.
  He was out to use Cæsar; and he gave his employer credit for this amount of
  intelligence, that Cæsar was never in any doubt that his employee&rsquo;s end
  was a purely selfish one.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cummins, the janitor, was in a communicative mood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the whole story, eh?&rdquo; he said with some
  enjoyment. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say that I know the whole of it myself.
  But what I know I can tell you. Mr. Welland lived in this house, in those
  identical rooms, when he was a bachelor and before he met the young lady he
  married. He came back to this house after his honeymoon, and his little
  girl&mdash;poor little soul!&mdash;was born in this house. He was a very
  happy sort of gentleman, but I don&rsquo;t think his wife found the life
  quite up to her expectations. She was one of these complaining ladies who was
  always worrying about what other women have in the way of dresses and
  jewellery, and Mr. Welland, who was an artistic sort of man, used to worry a
  lot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About eight months after the baby was born, Mr. Welland brought a
  gentleman home to dinner. I know, because when he had a party, I used to wait
  at table, and on this occasion I got into what I call my butler&rsquo;s suit,
  and did a bit of handing round. A very nice gentleman, to all appearance, was
  this Mr.&mdash;now, what was his name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Valentine?&rdquo; suggested Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir,&rdquo; said the janitor. &ldquo;A
  nice-looking fellow, but what a rascal! What a scoundrel! A regular
  West-Ender, he was. Plenty of money, carriages and horses, a big house in
  Belgrave Square, and what not. Well, the long and the short of it is that Mr.
  Valentine used to call when Mr. Welland was away in the City. And sometimes
  he would call when Mr. Welland was home, but not often. Then Mr. Welland and
  his wife had an awful row&mdash;I think it was over a ring which this fellow
  Valentine gave her&mdash;and one afternoon when the governor came
  home&mdash;I always called him the governor&mdash;she had gone and taken the
  baby with her. Bolted, sir! Gone off to America by all accounts with
  Valentine, and that was the end of <i>her!</i> Mr. Welland took on something
  terrible. He was like a madman, and I remember as though it was yesterday his
  coming to me and saying, &lsquo;Cummins, sooner or later that man will die at
  my hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What happened to Mrs. Welland?&rdquo; asked Smith. There was no
  need to ask if he trusted Cæsar, but he did not trust Cæsar.</p>

  <p>Cummins shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Died, sir. I only heard of it by accident about two years ago. She
  and the baby died of some fever&mdash;yellow fever, I think it was.
  It&rsquo;s curious you should come here asking about Mr. Welland,&rdquo; he
  said, getting on to his feet and going across to a dresser. &ldquo;I was
  turning out this drawer only this morning, and I found this picture; one he
  gave me on his wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled open a drawer and took out a cabinet photograph, handing it to
  the visitor. It was the face of an artist, refined and delicate, yet with a
  strength in its lines that one might not have expected after hearing the
  janitor&rsquo;s account of the man&rsquo;s breakdown. The high forehead, the
  long, thin nose, the firm jaw, were features impossible to forget.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you couldn&rsquo;t let me have this photograph to make a
  reproduction?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The janitor looked dubiously at Mr. Smith and then at the photograph.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t like to part with it. You see, it&rsquo;s
  written on,&rdquo; he said, pointing to an inscription. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, though, if you like to pay for it. I&rsquo;ll
  have a copy made.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will suit me admirably,&rdquo; said Smith, and passed across a
  pound note to seal the bargain.</p>

  <p>He went out into John Street puzzled. What was Cæsar&rsquo;s game in
  sending him to conduct these enquiries? He must have known that Welland was
  no longer in John Street. It was as certain as anything that he had employed
  detectives to trace the man. And yet had he? This imperious and imperial
  Cæsar had a lofty contempt for the small things of life; and was it not
  possible that Welland had faded from his mind until the next time that
  Scotland Yard had put some mysterious detective on his track and set his mind
  wondering as to the shadower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

  <p>Cæsar was not to be judged by ordinary standards, Smith concluded as he
  walked back to his hotel. He expected to find some sort of communication from
  him, for Cæsar had said that he was leaving Paris by the midday train and
  would arrive that evening. But there was no letter or telegram.</p>

  <p>He went up to his room, which was now ready for him, and sat down to
  consider the somewhat complicated situation. Here was he, Tray-Bong Smith
  (how quickly the Paris underworld had caught on that nickname!), engaged by
  one who was probably the most dangerous man in the world, to carry out what
  was practically detective work on the strength of having thrown a man into
  the Seine!</p>

  <p>What sort of villainies he required of him Smith was curious to know. He
  would dearly have loved to stay on in Paris. The mystery of the manacled
  woman intrigued him vastly. It was one of the most creepy experiences he had
  had, he the man without nerves. That she was Cæsar&rsquo;s prisoner, he did
  not doubt, and that the deep, booming voice that had called her from the
  shadow of the poplars was the voice of Madonna Beatrice he was certain. What
  had this woman done? Why did Cæsar, the last of the Borgias, who had, Smith
  suspected, so quick a way with his enemies, retain her in custody when he
  could have so readily and so easily rid himself of the necessity of keeping
  her locked up?</p>

  <p>If Cæsar had come to him and said, &ldquo;Slay this woman&mdash;I have not
  the courage,&rdquo; Tray-Bong would have understood. That he would have
  killed in cold blood is unlikely. Tray-Bong Smith did not kill women.</p>

  <p>Acting on a sudden impulse, he went out again to the British Museum,
  where, in the reading-room, he revived his acquaintance with the Borgias, for
  it was certain that Cæsar had not only inherited their vices but was a
  faithful copyist of their methods.</p>

  <p>The book he chose was a small monograph by an eminent American professor,
  the best he knew, and it took him an hour and a half to read it from cover to
  cover. Tray-Bong Smith had always held that the coincidences of life are part
  of life&rsquo;s normality. That they are not confined to plays and stories,
  any observer will agree; but the fact that he should be there in the British
  Museum reading-room studying a life of the Borgias on the very day and at the
  very minute another person should have been waiting impatiently to read that
  identical book was remarkable.</p>

  <p>He took the book back to the clerk and thought the frock-coated attendant
  breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you haven&rsquo;t kept it any longer, sir,&rdquo; he
  said, scribbled out a ticket, and carried the book over to an old man who was
  sitting bolt upright in a chair, his gnarled hands on the handle of an
  umbrella, his stern, lined face turned resentfully in Smith&rsquo;s
  direction.</p>

  <p>The old man took the book with a grunt and shuffled off to a reading
  table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think a man worth all those millions would come
  in and sit here waiting for a book that he could have bought for a few
  shillings,&rdquo; said the attendant when he returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worth all those millions?&rdquo; repeated Smith, looking after the
  bowed figure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Mr. Ross. You&rsquo;ve heard of Ross, the
  millionaire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith had heard of Ross, the millionaire, curiously enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the gentleman,&rdquo; said the attendant.
  &ldquo;They say he would rather walk ten miles than spend
  twopence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you something more about him,&rdquo; said he
  cryptically. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like people who snore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar&rsquo;s lieutenant took another look at the old man before he went
  out. He was about seventy, Smith guessed, and the main feature of his face
  was a white beard so closely clipped that he had the appearance of being
  unshaven. That and his shabby clothing impressed Smith most.</p>

  <p>He dined at the hotel and had intended going to a theatre, but when he
  came out into the hall the porter handed him an envelope addressed in
  typewritten characters to &ldquo;T. B. Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened it. The letter inside was also typewritten. It ran:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Watch Ross. His lawyers are Baker and Sepley, of 129 Great James
  Street. If he goes to them or sends for them, he must be immediately
  destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the lower right-hand corner were the words &ldquo;Quai Fleurs,&rdquo;
  which was at once a reminder and an indication of the source from whence the
  letter came.</p>

  <p>So that was Cæsar&rsquo;s game, and that was why he had sent the man from
  Chi So&rsquo;s to London and had arranged Room 41 for him. He was to watch
  this old man, this student of the Borgias, and in certain eventualities he
  was to be destroyed, and Smith was to destroy him.</p>

  <p>The watcher put the letter away in his pocket and grinned to himself.</p>

  <p>The lordly Cæsar stepped too readily into the character of tyrant.
  Tray-Bong Smith was to be the hired assassin and have the police of the
  metropolis on his heels, or else to be exposed for something that had
  happened in France and for which he was not liable in England. Anyway, Cæsar
  was in London. That was news.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A NOTE FROM NOWHERE</h2>

  <p class="first">TRAY-BONG SMITH sat in the lounge of the hotel reading the
  evening papers and watched Mr. Ross come from the dining-room and take the
  elevator to the second floor. After a while he followed, going into his own
  room and waiting until he heard the snap of the electric switch which told
  him that the old man had retired. He wasn&rsquo;t likely to see his lawyer
  between the hours of nine and twelve, thought Tray-Bong Smith, and sallied
  forth into the West End to find amusement.</p>

  <p>A man watching the hotel saw him return at 11.30, signalled to the shadow
  who had followed Mr. Smith all that evening and compared notes. Smith may or
  may not have known that he was being watched. He might have guessed as much
  after Hallett&rsquo;s warning. He went upstairs to bed and to sleep, and was
  on the point of undressing when he heard the soft thud of a door closing, and
  it seemed that the sound came from the next room. He switched out his light,
  drew the door open gently, and listened, but there was no further sound.</p>

  <p>No. 40, the room occupied by Mr. Ross, was, as he had learnt earlier in
  the evening, not so much a room as a suite. It consisted of two
  apartments&mdash;a bedroom with a bath, and a sitting-room which led from the
  bedroom, and access to which could be had direct from the passage through a
  door marked 40A.</p>

  <p>Smith stepped out into the corridor, walked softly to No. 40 and listened.
  There was no sound. He went on to 40A and listened again, and after a while
  he was rewarded by the murmur of voices.</p>

  <p>He strolled to the end of the passage to see if there were any hotel
  servants, but Bilton&rsquo;s is one of those eminently respectable hostelries
  patronised in the main by elderly people who retire early, and he walked back
  down the corridor and tried the door of 40. To his surprise it was unlocked
  and he stepped in, closing the door behind him. It would be a simple matter
  to explain how he, a stranger to the hotel, had walked into the wrong
  room.</p>

  <p>A line of light along the floor showed him where the communicating door
  was, and he made bold to turn on the light for a second, and discovered, as
  he had expected, that the bed was unoccupied and the room empty. He put out
  the light noiselessly and tiptoed across the room, putting his ear to the
  door. Two people were talking; the one voice gruff and harsh, the second so
  soft that he could hardly hear a word that was spoken, for it was the voice
  of a woman. And somehow that voice was familiar.</p>

  <p>Tray-Bong Smith crouched down and looked through the keyhole, but could
  see no more than the back of a chair. He listened intently, but could hear
  nothing intelligible. Once he heard Ross say:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they are on earth we will find them,&rdquo; and he thought he
  heard the old man say, &ldquo;It is remarkable&mdash;I should have been
  deceived . . .&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then most unexpectedly a hand fell on the doorknob and he hurried back
  through the room and was out in the corridor before it could have been
  opened. He had no time to close the door, but pulled it to after him and was
  in his own room in something under two seconds.</p>

  <p>He waited patiently behind his own closed door, listening, but there was
  no sound, and after five minutes had passed he ventured to open it. There he
  stood in the darkness for nearly half an hour before the two came out. He
  heard the man say &ldquo;Good night, my dear. God bless you!&rdquo; and
  thought he heard the sound of a kiss. Smith opened the door wider. The lights
  from the corridor were on full and there was no possibility of making a
  mistake.</p>

  <p>The figure that came past the door was not, as he had expected, a
  woman&mdash;but Ross himself! The old man had gone out and left the woman
  behind. For a while Smith was too bewildered to make a move, then, seizing
  his hat from the bed, he raced down the corridor in pursuit of the old man.
  He must have gone down by the stairs, for the elevator was descending as he
  reached the end of the corridor and he came to the ground-floor in time to
  see the figure pass through the swing-doors out into the night. There was a
  car waiting, evidently for him, for he stepped in without giving the driver
  instructions and it moved off. Smith called a passing taxi.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Follow that car,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He had no difficulty, the streets were empty of traffic, for the theatres
  had been closed for an hour. The chauffeur, however, was cautious and the way
  fortunately led through theatreland, and the taxi was on the tail of the car
  all the way up Regent Street into Portland Place.</p>

  <p>At a house in Portland Place the car stopped, the old man descended and
  let himself into the big mansion with a key. Smith noted the
  number&mdash;409. He had stopped his own cab well behind the car, which,
  contrary to his expectations, did not move off. Mr. Smith dismissed his car,
  and standing in the cover of a doorway, he waited.</p>

  <p>In half an hour the door of 409 opened and a girl came out, wearing a long
  black cloak.</p>

  <p>Smith slipped from his place of concealment and walked rapidly toward
  her.</p>

  <p>She moved as quickly to the car, but the street standard showed her face
  clearly.</p>

  <p>It was Stephanie&mdash;Cæsar&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now what has happened to old man Ross?&rdquo; said the puzzled Mr.
  Smith, and went to bed that night with the problem unsolved.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Cæsar sent for him the next morning, adopting in his typewritten note that
  royal-command tone of his which so suited him.</p>

  <p>The men met in Green Park. It was a bright, sunny day and Cæsar was
  dressed in grey. He was something of a dandy in his attire and again the
  fastidious Smith approved.</p>

  <p>Cæsar motioned his confederate to a garden chair by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend sending for you, Smith,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but one or two things have happened, and I thought it advisable to see
  you in order to let you know where you can get into touch with me in any
  emergency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know exactly where I can get into touch with you, with or without
  an emergency,&rdquo; said Tray-Bong calmly. &ldquo;409 Portland Place, I
  think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;My name is not in any
  of the reference books.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Smith with a fine gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shadowed me! I was out late last night,&rdquo; said he
  accusingly, and the other laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I give you my word that I have never shadowed you in my
  life,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t see how I can shadow Mr.
  Ross and you at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how did you know?&rdquo; insisted Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little bird told me,&rdquo; bantered Smith. &ldquo;Please let me
  have my mystery too, Mr. Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shadowed me,&rdquo; he said, nodding, and then dismissed the
  subject. &ldquo;What do you think of Ross?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A worthy old gentleman,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I like his
  appearance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made no reference to the fact that he had seen &ldquo;the worthy old
  gentleman&rdquo; letting himself into Cæsar&rsquo;s house with a key. That
  could wait.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is worth from ten to twenty millions,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
  &ldquo;He has no heir, he has no will, and on his death his property reverts
  to the State.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;That is my mystery.&rdquo;
  He did not speak again for a moment. He had that queer trick of breaking off
  a conversation and letting his fancy and thoughts roam at will; but presently
  he returned to the subject of the old man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men and women work and sweat from morning till night,&rdquo; he
  said musingly, &ldquo;year in and year out, for just sufficient food and rest
  as will enable them to carry on with more work. I do not work because I have
  brains, and because I do not regard human life from the same angle as the
  commonplace person; neither do you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you realise
  that if Mr. Ross at this moment sat down and wrote on a sheet of paper half a
  dozen lines, signed it, and had his signature witnessed by a chambermaid or a
  valet, those few lines would make us enormously wealthy men and give us all
  the power in the world?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean if he made a will in our favour and providentially
  died?&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very direct,&rdquo; Cæsar laughed softly. &ldquo;But
  hasn&rsquo;t it ever struck you how simple a matter is the transfer of
  property when one of the conditions of transfer is the death of one of the
  parties? If you or I were to burgle the Bank of England, there would be no
  hope for us unless we spent years of unremitting labour in organising and
  preparing for our coup&mdash;and then the chances are that we should
  fail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you and I wished to forge a little cheque, say on Mr.
  Ross&rsquo;s account, we have to overcome the suspicions and safeguards
  imposed by dozens of very intelligent men, all of whom would have to be
  hoodwinked separately. And then in the end we might fail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I have realised,&rdquo; Mr. Smith agreed with a grimace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it not a more simple matter,&rdquo; mused Cæsar, &ldquo;to
  induce Mr. Ross to sign a document of half-a-dozen lines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;I should say that it would
  be a very difficult matter. It would be easier, if you will forgive the
  directness, to arrange his untimely demise than to induce his signature.
  Otherwise, if I may be bold, there would be one of your famous wreaths on
  order.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His eyes twinkled. Any tribute to the inevitability of his success pleased
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At present my object in life is to prevent him signing those
  half-dozen lines for anybody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I particularly desire
  that Mr. Ross should die without making any provision for the disposal of his
  fortune.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thought you told
  me that his estate would go to the Crown?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he had no heirs,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;Always remember that,
  if he had no heirs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But has he?&rdquo; demanded his companion. &ldquo;He is a
  bachelor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a widower,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;He had one child who was
  estranged from him and who died. In all probability, if that child was alive,
  he would make a will leaving his property to a dogs&rsquo; home or something
  equally absurd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slowly an idea was taking shape and form in Smith&rsquo;s mind. Very, very
  slowly certain dark places were becoming clear. He was a quick thinker, and
  what were mysteries to most people were not mysteries to him. In some
  respects even Cæsar could not match his ready powers of induction. Tray-Bong
  Smith had been genuinely puzzled and baffled by certain experiences in the
  past few days, but now he began to &ldquo;see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How old would his daughter be if she were alive?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forty-seven,&rdquo; said Cæsar readily. &ldquo;Three years younger
  than I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So he was fifty. There were days when he looked it, but on this morning he
  would have passed easily for thirty-five.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forty-seven,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;She ran away from home when
  she was something over twenty, and married a fiddler, or something of the
  sort. The old man made a will leaving his property to an orphan
  asylum&mdash;cut her right out of it. When he heard of her death, he tore up
  the will, intending, I think, to make another one. You see, I am very well
  informed upon Mr. Ross&rsquo;s private life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose she isn&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo; drawled Smith, and the big man
  swung round in his chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. It was the first time
  Smith had seen him display any kind of perturbation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose she isn&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

  <p>Cæsar shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case she would inherit the fortune&mdash;if he
  died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you produce her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you produce her and let her go into an English court and tell
  of years spent in almost solitary confinement in some forgotten room on your
  French estate? Would you like her to tell the Judge of the High Court how you
  let her out for exercise in the middle of the night, manacled hand and
  foot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar&rsquo;s face went white and drawn and he looked his fifty, but the
  man with the absurd nickname went on remorselessly, for he was determined
  that Cæsar Valentine should put his cards down, face uppermost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A woman marries a wandering fiddler, you say? I gather that&rsquo;s
  an extravagance of yours and means no more than that she married a musician.
  A fairly prosperous amateur musician, unless I am mistaken, by the name of
  Welland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He winced&mdash;the second score for Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You discover her relationship with Ross, and persuade her to go
  abroad with you, waiting for the divorce which you think Welland will obtain
  but which he doesn&rsquo;t. Then the woman gets restless; perhaps her child
  dies. She certainly remains in the land of the living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar was calm enough now, and a cynical smile was hovering at the corners
  of his mouth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful fellow!&rdquo; he said mockingly. &ldquo;You have told
  almost all the truth. The child died, and in the meantime Stephanie is born.
  It is my intention to produce Stephanie as the heiress of the Ross millions.
  Now you know it all, or you&rsquo;ve guessed it all. You&rsquo;re clever,
  Smith&mdash;a cleverer man than I thought. There&rsquo;s a fortune in this
  for you if you&rsquo;ll work with me; and if you
  don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A quick and a painless death, eh?&rdquo; smiled Smith. &ldquo;But
  watch that my knife is not swifter than your alkaloids.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked down. There was an envelope lying at his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you drop that?&rdquo; asked Smith, and stooped and picked it
  up. &ldquo;It has your name on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t drop it,&rdquo; he said, and read the
  superscription: &ldquo;Cæsar Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was gummed and sealed with wax. He tore open the flap with a frown.
  Smith saw his face harden and he blinked rapidly. Was there fear in his eyes
  as he handed the letter to his tool? Smith thought there was.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did this come from?&rdquo; he gasped and looked around, but
  nobody was in sight.</p>

  <p>There were three lines of handwriting in what is called
  &ldquo;pen-print&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the letters were printed in big
  capitals. The note began:</p>

  <p class="smcap">&ldquo;Cæsar! You are but mortal. Remember this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was signed <span class="smcap">&ldquo;Number Six.&rdquo;</span></p>

  <p>Smith read it through with a qualm, but Cæsar, snatching it from his hand,
  crumbled it into a ball and tossed it away with an oath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;if I find you before you find
  me, beware of Cæsar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think we shall find Welland first,&rdquo; said Smith confidently
  and laughed.</p>

  <p>It was the laugh Cæsar had heard that rainy night on the Quai des Fleurs
  when Tray-Bong Smith had flung a knife into the Seine.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; MR. SMITH IS BURGLED</h2>

  <p class="first">GREAT criminals, like great heroes, do not bear too close an
  inspection. There were chinks in the armour of Cæsar Valentine which Smith, a
  cool Professor of Humanity, had never suspected. The man&rsquo;s vanity was
  colossal, but had the compensation of an immense capability. He was
  brilliantly clever, and in many respects Mr. Smith admitted he had the most
  wonderful mind he had ever rubbed against. He had the genius not so much of
  generalship as of diplomacy, and in this respect resembled his remarkable
  ancestor, if ancestor he was. The Borgia did not win his battles on the
  field, but in the treasury. If he carried one walled city by assault, he
  carried ten by bribery.</p>

  <p>Cæsar sent for Smith that afternoon again, and this time the man went to
  409 Portland Place, and was shown by a footman into the handsome library,
  where Cæsar was waiting with every evidence of impatience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland must be found,&rdquo; he greeted the other. &ldquo;I have
  put the matter into the hands of a private detective agency, and I have told
  them to go ahead, regardless of expense. I am satisfied that the man is still
  living, because he was seen by one of my agents in York only two years
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why the devil did you send me to search for him?&rdquo;
  demanded Smith unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the off-chance of his having communicated with that
  address,&rdquo; he said, and probably he was speaking the truth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are two men who may be at the back of this Number Six folly.
  One is old Gale&rsquo;s son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gale&rsquo;s son is in the Argentine,&rdquo; interrupted Smith.
  &ldquo;He is farming on a ranch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did you find that out?&rdquo; demanded Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was easy,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;The officials of the
  bank you robbed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I robbed?&rdquo; said Cæsar quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody robbed,&rdquo; said Smith with a wave of his hand.
  &ldquo;It is hardly important who did it. At any rate, these officials are in
  touch with young Gale, who apparently has undertaken to restore all the money
  that the bank lost. So you can rule out Gale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it must be Welland,&rdquo; said Cæsar. "It must be Welland! My
  information from Scotland Yard is beyond doubt. The man who calls himself
  Number Six&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He may as well be a woman,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No woman would dare,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;No woman would dare!
  No, it is Welland. It is an amateur who got into touch with the Chief of the
  Intelligence Bureau and persuaded him to let him take on the job. Remember,
  they have nothing against me at Scotland Yard. They have no proof; they know
  nothing of any crime that I might have committed. They have only a suspicion,
  an uneasiness&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith agreed with him. There was no sense in disagreeing with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to Ross,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;I will attend to
  Welland. He has had no visitors?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ross? None.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody has been to see him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith shook his head. He could lie as well as Cæsar Valentine. After all,
  he had certain interests of his own to look after, and did not apologise even
  to himself for the deception. Much more must happen in the tangled skein of
  Cæsar&rsquo;s affairs before Smith revealed his hand. Cæsar had the
  satisfaction of having him under his thumb. Smith also had a thumb, and was
  greatly desirous of meeting his employer on level terms.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith loved life as dearly as any, and he knew that every ounce of
  weight he could bring to bear upon this singular man at the psychological
  moment was so much life insurance. The mystery of Mr. Ross and his
  inexplicable visit to 409 Portland Place in Cæsar&rsquo;s absence had yet to
  be solved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would you have done, supposing you hadn&rsquo;t met me?&rdquo;
  he asked him suddenly. &ldquo;Your unhappy Ernest would have been a poor
  substitute in this game!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ernest served his purpose,&rdquo; said the other coldly. &ldquo;He
  performed certain duties which were essential, but he had a valet&rsquo;s
  mind. Poor Ernest!&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

  <p>He was not being hypocritical, thought Smith on his way back to the hotel.
  Indeed Smith was certain that the man was profoundly sorry that the necessity
  had arisen for removing a troublesome servant. There must have been certain
  coarse fibres in Cæsar&rsquo;s composition which responded to this uncouth
  little man and his crudities.</p>

  <p>What villainies Ernest performed Smith was never able to discover, but
  that was because the full range of Cæsar&rsquo;s activities has never been
  wholly revealed. Smith came into the Borgia&rsquo;s life at the climax of a
  great plot which had been developing for years, and Cæsar had had to get that
  money to live in the style he regarded as necessary for his comfort, and the
  unwilling contributors to his income had been drawn from all stages of
  society.</p>

  <p>Watching Mr. Ross was a monotonous business and Smith pined for a more
  active life, and did not disguise his feelings from Cæsar when he met him the
  next morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t give you a throat to cut every
  day,&rdquo; said Cæsar sardonically. &ldquo;You will attend to Mr.
  Ross.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Ross spends most of his time in the Reform Club reading dull
  English magazines,&rdquo; complained Tray-Bong with some slight exasperation.
  &ldquo;I have already got wet through watching those infernal
  premises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; said Cæsar definitely.</p>

  <p>That evening he telephoned through in a state of excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s found!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to see him.&rdquo; It almost sounded
  as though Cæsar&rsquo;s voice was shaking. &ldquo;He was picked up in
  Manchester&mdash;he is staying at a poor lodging in the suburbs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith awkwardly. He did not know what else he
  could say. &ldquo;You are seeing him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Cæsar had hung up his receiver. He had abrupt habits.</p>

  <p>Whatever Mr. Smith thought of this interview is not known. He had troubles
  of his own next day, as he discovered on returning to his hotel. In twelve
  months&rsquo; sojourn in the French capital he had acquired a reputation and
  a nickname, which is more than some people better placed than he could boast.
  But he was only human, and had the strongest objection to his trunks and his
  private writing-case being ransacked by amateur hands. Only an amateur would
  cut off the lock of the new leather portfolio he had bought the day before
  and leave its contents to litter his dressing-table. Only an amateur would go
  through his clothes without replacing them upon the hooks where they rightly
  belonged.</p>

  <p>Smith sent for the manager of Bilton&rsquo;s Hotel and showed him the
  chaos which the visitor had left, and the manager was duly apologetic. He did
  not remember any strange man or woman coming to the hotel, nor did the
  chambermaid. The only stranger who had put in an appearance was &ldquo;the
  young lady who called on Mr. Ross&rdquo;&mdash;and she, of course, was too
  young-ladylike to commit this act of vandalism.</p>

  <p>At the mention of the young lady Mr. Smith&rsquo;s mind grew calmer. He
  had a fear that some misguided but well-meaning officer from Scotland Yard
  had taken it upon himself to substantiate a passing suspicion. The active and
  intelligent young officers who pass into the Criminal Investigation
  Department are prone to be zealous, and Smith would have hated to have been
  compelled to call upon the steely-eyed Mr. Hallett with a complaint against
  his promising boys.</p>

  <p>Obviously an amateur&rsquo;s work, thought he, as he again inspected the
  evidence of the hasty search; for there was a little smear of blood on the
  blotting-pad.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE LADY WHO MODELLED</h2>

  <p class="first">SMITH drove up to 409 Portland Place. Mr. Valentine was out,
  the pompous footman told him, and would not be back until late that evening.
  Was the young lady in? Yes, she was. Would he ask her to be kind enough to
  see him, asked Smith, and gave him a card inscribed &ldquo;Lord Henry
  Jones&rdquo;&mdash;one of those comic visiting-cards which one uses on the
  Continent with such effect, the French being wholly ignorant of the fact that
  nobody could be called &ldquo;Lord Henry Jones&rdquo; and live.</p>

  <p>He was shown into the drawing-room and she came down, holding a card in
  her hand, and stopped dead at the door at the sight of the, to her, sinister
  figure. Smith was, by all records, a hardened man and not unacquainted with
  beautiful women, but he never saw this girl but his tongue did not cleave to
  the roof of his mouth, and he was not reduced from the cool, sane man of
  affairs to a stammering fool. It was not her beauty alone, or her
  spirituality; it was something worshipful in her, to which his heart
  responded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Smith stammered like a schoolboy. &ldquo;I came to
  see you on a matter of importance.&rdquo; He looked at her hand. One finger
  was neatly bandaged, and then he laughed, incidentally recovering something
  of his self-possession.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father is out,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I am afraid I
  cannot be of any assistance to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can be a lot of assistance to me, Miss Valentine,&rdquo; said
  the man coolly. &ldquo;You can give me, for example, a great deal of
  information.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First about your finger,&rdquo; said he boldly. &ldquo;Have you
  hurt it badly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you cut open my writing-case this morning,&rdquo; said Smith
  gently, &ldquo;I fear the knife or scissors slipped. You left a little of
  your blue blood behind.&rdquo; Her face had gone pink, and for one delicious
  moment she looked ridiculous. There is nothing more wonderful than to see
  somebody of whom you stand in awe looking a little foolish. She was wise
  enough not to attempt to reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ask me to sit down?&rdquo; asked Smith. She waved
  her hand to a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you expect to find in my writing-case?&rdquo; he rallied
  her. &ldquo;Evidence of my excessive criminality?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You seem to forget that I was
  on the Quai des Fleurs that night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not say what night, but it was not necessary to ask her for an
  explanation. What Smith marvelled at was her extraordinary coolness. She did
  not tremble&mdash;she who had witnessed what must have been to her a terrible
  crime. She spoke as coolly of &ldquo;that night&rdquo; as though she had been
  a participant rather than a horrified spectator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Curiously enough, I
  always remember things like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But sarcasm was wasted on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have some tea now that you&rsquo;re here, Mr. Smith? I
  take tea very early.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded. He was prepared to drink tea, or something more noxious, so
  that it was delivered to him by her hand&mdash;into such a condition had this
  man fallen.</p>

  <p>She rang a bell and then came back to her chair, and looked across at him
  with a little smile in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;m a burglar, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re anything of the
  sort,&rdquo; stammered Smith. &ldquo;The fact is, I thought&mdash;possibly
  your father had told you to come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he floundered
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are a queer lot of people, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she said
  unexpectedly. &ldquo;My father, you, and I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Mr. Ross,&rdquo; added Smith softly, and she looked at him for
  a moment startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Mr. Ross. Mr. Valentine
  put you in the next room to him to watch him, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was a most disconcerting person, and again Tray-Bong Smith was
  embarrassed. He had long before discovered that the best way to get out of an
  embarrassing situation is to return the embarrassment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is necessary for me to watch Mr. Ross on
  behalf of your father,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;especially when he can sit
  at home and watch him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought Mr. Ross was a visitor to this house,&rdquo; said Smith
  innocently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A visitor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her eyes were fixed on his, and then suddenly he saw a light dawn, and her
  face went pink. For a second or two she controlled the laughter which was
  bubbling at her lips, and then she fell back in the chair and laughed long
  and musically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Ross here! And did you
  see him come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Smith boldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And did you see him go?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him go,&rdquo; admit fed the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but you should have, done,&rdquo; she said with mock
  seriousness. &ldquo;You should have seen him home and tucked him into bed.
  Isn&rsquo;t that what you&rsquo;re paid for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith winced under the scarcely veiled scorn in the tone. Or was it
  good-humoured malice?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you saw Mr. Ross come here,&rdquo; she said after a while.
  &ldquo;And did you tell my father? No, of course you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told him&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; and she looked at him queerly.</p>

  <p>At that moment a footman brought in a silver tea-tray and set the table,
  and further conversation was impossible. When the man had gone and the girl
  had filled the cups, she sat with her folded hands on her lap, looking down
  as though she were resolving some problem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll think it is
  dreadful of me, that I speak so lightly over the terrible scene I witnessed
  on the Quai des Fleurs, but I have a reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I know your reason,&rdquo; said Smith quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if you do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course, I ought to
  shrink away from you and shout for the police when you come near, for
  you&rsquo;re a horrid criminal, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith grinned uncomfortably. She alone of all the people in the world had
  a trick of making him feel a fool.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although I
  have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A clean bill in England&mdash;I know all about that,&rdquo; said
  the girl; and he stared at her, wondering who had used that phrase before,
  and was startled to remember that it was himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather a queer girl because I&rsquo;ve had rather a queer
  life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see, the earlier days of my life were spent
  in a little New Jersey town&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How eccentric!&rdquo; murmured Smith, as he stirred his tea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sarcastic,&rdquo; said the girl with a smile.
  &ldquo;I was very, very happy in America, except that I didn&rsquo;t seem to
  have any parents around. Father only came occasionally, and he is
  rather&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;forbidding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All the time her eyes were fixed on his, and Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might have stayed on in New Jersey for a very long time,&rdquo;
  she went on; &ldquo;in fact, all my life, because I love the place; only, you
  see&rdquo;&mdash;again she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I made rather a terrific
  discovery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How terrific?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;At
  least, not at present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was curious enough now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you told me,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;it might
  help me a lot, and help you too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully and shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you this much,
  and I&rsquo;m not going to ask you to keep my secret, because I&rsquo;m sure
  you will&mdash;I have rather a secret of yours, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had a horrible fear you were going to betray
  me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Smith, but she stopped him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk about that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One of
  these days I&rsquo;m going to surprise you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was it you discovered in New Jersey?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After mother&mdash;died,&rdquo; said the girl slowly, &ldquo;and
  father went to Europe, he left a lot of things with his lawyer, Judge Cramb.
  The judge used to pay all my expenses and the cost of the upkeep of the
  house, and give me an allowance every month when I was old enough to have an
  allowance; and generally he acted as father&rsquo;s agent. Well, whilst Mr.
  Valentine was away in Europe, the old judge died suddenly and his practice
  passed into the hands of strangers. The first thing the strangers did was to
  send back a small black box which father had kept in the judge&rsquo;s office
  for safe keeping. I rather fancy that at the time of his death the judge was
  not acting for father at all, because my money used to come through the
  Farmers&rsquo; Bank, and I suppose that the new lawyer, finding his office
  cluttered up with old boxes, thought he would make a clean sweep, so
  father&rsquo;s effects came back to me. I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea as
  to what I should do with it until Mrs. Temple, the lady who was looking after
  me, suggested that I should send it to him in Europe by registered post. Of
  course, I couldn&rsquo;t send a big heavy box, so I tried to find a key which
  would fit the lock, and after a while found one. The box was full of papers,
  all tied neatly into bundles, except for a few loose documents and
  photographs. I took them out, addressed a big envelope and sent it to father,
  and it was whilst I was going over the loose papers that I saw something
  which decided me to come to Europe. Father had often asked me to come, though
  I don&rsquo;t think he seriously meant me to leave America. But now I made up
  my mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo; asked Smith quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two years ago,&rdquo; replied Stephanie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you came to Europe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father knew?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said the girl indifferently, &ldquo;he agreed; in
  fact, I think he was pleased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith thought awhile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That explains a lot,&rdquo; he said; then asked carelessly,
  &ldquo;What do you do with your days?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The answer was the last he expected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I model in wax,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t father
  tell you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Model?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will show you,&rdquo; she said, and led him out of the drawing-
  room through the big hall to a little room at the back of the house. The
  &ldquo;room&rdquo; was really a small conservatory which had been furnished
  with a long deal bench, a few chairs, and a cupboard.</p>

  <p>He looked at the beautiful little figures, finished and unfinished, that
  decorated the bench, and was genuinely astonished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist, Miss Stephanie&mdash;Miss Valentine,&rdquo;
  he corrected himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stephanie would do,&rdquo; she said with a little smile.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an artist, am I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t know much about art,&rdquo; began
  Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you know just what you like?&rdquo; she said dryly. &ldquo;Now
  you&rsquo;ve disappointed me, Mr. Smith. I thought a man with your artistic
  temperament would really have said something original.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were exquisite little models; a shepherdess in the French style was
  as perfect a thing as Smith had seen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you colour them yourself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded. She glanced round, and Smith saw a look of anxiety in her face
  and followed the direction of her eyes. It was at a cupboard against the wall
  that she was looking, and almost before he discovered the cause of her
  anxiety she had darted across the room, shut the cupboard door and locked it,
  and thrusting the key into her pocket, turned a very red face to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Family skeleton?&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The family skeleton,&rdquo; she replied steadily. &ldquo;Now come
  back and finish your tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was perturbed, and Smith wondered what there was in that mysterious
  cupboard, which she was so anxious to hide. And what had amused her so when
  he had told her that he had been shadowing Mr. Ross? She was a strange girl.
  He did not understand her, and what he did not understand worried him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The family skeleton,&rdquo; she said unexpectedly after a long
  silence. &ldquo;There are a lot of skeletons in this family, Mr.
  Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are in most families,&rdquo; said Smith lamely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we&rdquo;&mdash;she lingered on the
  word&mdash;&ldquo;we&mdash;Borgias&mdash;have more than our share, Mr.
  Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Borgias?&rdquo; said Smith softly. &ldquo;What do you mean by
  Borgias?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know? Of course you knew!&rdquo; she said
  derisively. She had recovered something of her spirits and her old flippancy.
  &ldquo;Have you never heard of the illustrious house of the Borgias? Can you
  understand why father did not call me Lucrezia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Oh yes, I think I
  can,&rdquo; and he nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is your explanation?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My explanation is the mysterious box that you discovered in your
  little Jersey town,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;The box and the contents
  thereof.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She got up from her seat and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed your tea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  think you ought to get back.&rdquo; And Smith was in the street before he
  realised that he had been summarily dismissed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; JOHN WELLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the morning of this interview a warder opened the cell
  door in Strangeways Gaol, and woke John Welland from a troublous sleep. He
  was not known to the officials of Strangeways Gaol as John Welland, but the
  name he had assumed is unimportant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the warder briefly, and went
  out.</p>

  <p>John Welland rose and dressed himself. Gaol delivery at Strangeways is at
  nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but the big prison clock was booming the
  midday hour before the discharged men were released to their waiting friends.
  It was half past twelve when John Welland came through the little black
  wicket door and walked down the street in the direction of the cars.</p>

  <p>A prisoner who had been released that morning, and who had been detained
  outside the gaol by his numerous friends, jerked his head in the direction of
  the retreating figure and said something which diverted the attention of his
  friends from their hero and to the man. Welland boarded a street-car and
  drove to the far end of the city, where he changed into a car which brought
  him back again but by another route. He alighted and walked for a mile and a
  half, taking such short cuts as would suggest that he feared being watched
  and followed. Presently he came to a quiet street, and turned in at a little
  house at one end. There was nobody to greet him, but a tiny fire burnt in the
  kitchen, and somebody had laid a plate and a cup and saucer. He put the
  kettle on and climbed a steep little flight of stairs which led to a neat
  bedroom, changing his clothes for others which he took from a hanging-
  cupboard.</p>

  <p>The face that looked into the mirror was grey and lined, the face of a
  prematurely old man. For fully five minutes he stood looking at himself, as
  though communing with the reflection; then with a sigh he descended the
  stairs, made and poured his tea, and sat down before the fire, his elbows on
  his knees, his chin in his palm.</p>

  <p>He heard the door unlocked, and looked round as a motherly-looking woman
  came in with a loaded market-basket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, mister,&rdquo; she said in a broad Lancashire
  dialect. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be back this morning, but I didn&rsquo;t
  think you&rsquo;d be here so early. Have you made your tea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Welland. He was Welland at
  home, at any rate.</p>

  <p>She made no reference to his absence; probably she was used to it. As she
  disposed of the contents of the basket she chattered incessantly&mdash;so
  incessantly that he rose presently and went into the little parlour and
  closed the door behind him. The woman went about her work until from the
  parlour came the faint strains of a violin, and then she sat to listen. It
  was a sad refrain he was playing&mdash;something Andalusian, with a sob at
  its end&mdash;and the good woman shook her head.</p>

  <p>Presently Welland came out again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said his housekeeper, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d play
  something cheerful, Mr. Welland. Those tunes get on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They soothe mine,&rdquo; said Welland with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a champion player,&rdquo; agreed the busy lady.
  &ldquo;And I like a tune on the fiddle. Did you ever play in public, Mr.
  Welland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland nodded as he took down a pipe from the mantelshelf, stuffed it
  from an old pouch and lit it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Beck triumphantly. &ldquo;I was
  telling my husband this morning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t tell your husband much about me, Mrs.
  Beck?&rdquo; said the man quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not too much. I&rsquo;m proper careful. I told a young man who
  came here yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland took out his pipe and looked round, his grey eyebrows lowered in a
  frown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What young man came here yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He came to enquire if you were at home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I was at home,&rdquo; said Welland. &ldquo;Did he mention my
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did an&rsquo; all,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  what struck me as funny. He&rsquo;s the first person that&rsquo;s ever been
  to this house and asked for you by name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told him you might be home to-morrow and you might be home next
  week, but I don&rsquo;t know for certain, Mr. Welland; you&rsquo;re not very
  regular. I told him you were away for months at a
  time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland pressed his lips together. He knew it was useless to reproach the
  woman. After all, it might be some tax-collector or somebody canvassing for
  charity, for these poor streets yield a rich harvest to the charity-monger;
  or perhaps it was the vicar renewing his attempts to become
  acquainted&mdash;an effort on the vicar&rsquo;s part which had been so
  uncompromisingly repulsed that he never called again in person.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mrs. Beck,&rdquo; said Welland. &ldquo;Only I
  don&rsquo;t like my business spoken of, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never speak of your business, Mr. Welland,&rdquo; said the woman,
  aggrieved. &ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; she added huffily.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nowt to me what you do with your time. For owt I know you
  might be a burglar or a policeman, you&rsquo;re away from home so
  often.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland made no reply. That afternoon, when the woman had finished her
  labours, had laid the tea and gone back to her own home, his mind went back
  to this young man visitor, and he put the chain on the door, determined not
  to answer the knock of any caller.</p>

  <p>None came until nightfall. He was sitting in his parlour with drawn
  blinds, reading by the light of an oil-lamp, when he heard a tap-tap on his
  door. He put down the book and listened. Presently it came
  again&mdash;tap-tap. In this tiny house the front door was within half a
  dozen feet of where he sat, and he walked out into the narrow passage. Again
  came the knock.</p>

  <p>It sounded as though somebody was tapping on the door with the head of a
  stick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Welland.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; said a muffled voice. &ldquo;I want to see you,
  Welland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; was the reply, and John Welland recognised the
  voice and his face went as white as death.</p>

  <p>For a moment his head swam, and he had to hold on to the wall for support.
  Then after a while he steadied his nerves, but his hands were trembling when
  he flung back the catch of the chain and threw the door open wide. The night
  was dark, for the moon had not risen, and he could only see the tall figure
  standing on the flagged path outside as an indistinct mass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He had secured control of his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; asked the visitor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; said John Welland, and every word was an effort.
  &ldquo;You are Cæsar Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He led the way into the parlour and Cæsar followed, and so they stood for
  a breathing-space, one on each side of a little circular table on which the
  oil-lamp burnt, the tall man towering above his enemy, Welland watching him
  with eyes that burnt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Welland who spoke first.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to see you on an important matter,&rdquo; said Cæsar
  coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is my wife?&rdquo; asked Welland, breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>Cæsar shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your wife is dead,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you know that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is my child?&rdquo; asked Welland.</p>

  <p>Again Cæsar shrugged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you raise a subject which is as painful to me as it is to
  you?&rdquo; he asked in a tone of complaint, as though he were the injured
  person. Then, without invitation, he sat down. &ldquo;Welland,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;you must be reasonable. The past is dead. Why nurse your
  hatred?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The hatred harbours me,&rdquo; said the other grimly. &ldquo;It is
  the link which binds me to life, Valentine, and will keep me living until
  with these hands&rdquo;&mdash;he stretched them forth and they were
  trembling&mdash;&ldquo;until with these hands I kill you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Melodrama!&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;You will kill me? Well, here I
  am. Kill, my friend. Have you no gun or knife? Are you afraid? You who
  threatened to kill, and who have held this threat over my head all this time,
  now is your opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slipped from his pocket something which glittered, and laid it on the
  table before the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said. It was a silver-plated revolver.
  &ldquo;Shoot. I guarantee that the bullet is heavy enough to kill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland looked from the pistol to the man and shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You shall die in good time,
  and you shall suffer even more than I have suffered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A silence fell again, and Welland went on:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad I have seen you,&rdquo; he said, speaking half to
  himself. &ldquo;You have not changed. You are as you were&mdash;look at
  me.&rdquo; He flung out his arms. &ldquo;You should be happy, Valentine, for
  all your life you have taken that which you wanted, and I have lost&mdash;oh
  my God! what have I lost?&rdquo; He covered his face with his hands, and
  Cæsar watched him curiously. Then the big man picked up the revolver and put
  it back in his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall die in good time, eh!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Well,
  here&rsquo;s to that good time! You had your chance. I asked you to divorce
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Divorce!&rdquo; groaned the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She could have married again and been happy. Now, Welland, are you
  going to be sensible?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you said all you wanted to say?&rdquo; asked Welland steadily.
  &ldquo;Because if you have, you can go. I say I am glad I have seen you. It
  has revived whatever hopes and ambitions were fading from my heart. I have
  gone through hell for you, Cæsar Valentine. I have suffered beyond your
  understanding in order that one day&mdash;one day&mdash;&rdquo; He nodded,
  and despite his calm and self-possession Cæsar felt a cold chill creeping
  down his spine.</p>

  <p>He was angry at the thought that any man should bring that thrill of fear
  to his heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your chance, Welland,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
  if you&rsquo;ve missed it, that is your fault. Now I have come to put the
  matter plainly to you. I believe you&rsquo;re in some Government service. I
  have reason to believe that you have been employed to spy on me, and I tell
  you here and now that the man is not born who will net Cæsar
  Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He brought his fist down on the table and the lamp jumped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like a fool I left you alone, and never once did it occur to me
  that I had the whole game in my hands if I acted instead of waiting for you
  to make your wife a free woman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had stepped round the table until he was side by side with the man he
  had wronged. Then suddenly, without warning, his two hands shot out and
  gripped Welland by the throat. Welland was strong, but Cæsar was superhuman
  in his strength. He swung the man backwards over a chair and crashed him to
  the floor, his hands never releasing their grip. Welland struggled
  desperately, but his struggles were in vain. Cæsar&rsquo;s knees were upon
  his arms, those vice-like hands of his were pressing steadily at his
  throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; whispered Cæsar, &ldquo;they will find you
  hanging&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and he looked round. Again the knock came,
  and the voice of a woman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you up, Mr. Welland? I can see your light. It&rsquo;s only Mrs.
  Beck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar released his grip and crept out of the room as Welland struggled to
  a chair, voiceless, half-senseless, and incapable of further movement. The
  big man stepped back into the room and blew out the lamp; then he came back
  and opened the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All in the dark?&rdquo; said the woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Ay,
  but I could have sworn I saw a light!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He let her pass, then leapt through the door, slamming it behind him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE MYSTERIOUS MR. ROSS</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;YOU look as if you&rsquo;ve had a bad night, my
  friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Tray-Bong Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A bad night?&rdquo; said Cæsar absently. &ldquo;Er&mdash;oh, yes, I
  didn&rsquo;t get back to town until late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see your Mr. Welland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar did not reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I gather you did,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;and that the interview
  was one you don&rsquo;t care to think about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am wondering just what Welland will do,&rdquo; he said after a
  while. &ldquo;With any kind of luck I should have known, but I was
  interrupted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That sounds like an interesting story spoilt by
  over-modesty,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Will you be kind enough to tell me just
  what happened when you met this interesting Mr. Welland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ought to have sent you,&rdquo; said Cæsar moodily.
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something weak about us Borgias, a cursed desire for the
  theatrical. I can imagine that you would have made no mistake,&rdquo; and
  then he told his companion the story. Smith was grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At any moment you, the artist in slaughter, are liable to be
  arrested for a very vulgar, common assault with intent to do grievous bodily
  harm, if I may employ the stilted phraseology of an indictment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will not take action. I tell you the man is fanatical. He is
  satisfied in his mind that some day he will kill me, and nothing less than
  killing me will please him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better you than me,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;You would be well
  advised to go careful, Mr. Cæsar Valentine. You can&rsquo;t play those
  monkey-tricks in England and get away with &rsquo;em. If Welland is Number
  Six, then you&rsquo;re going to have the devil&rsquo;s own trouble before
  you&rsquo;re rid of his attentions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland <i>is</i> Number Six,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;My agent
  made enquiries. He spends his time running about up and down the country.
  He&rsquo;s away for long periods. Moreover&mdash;and this is
  important&mdash;he has been visiting the gaols.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As a boarder?&rdquo; asked Smith flippantly, but Cæsar was in no
  mood for jests.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you that I was pretty well informed as to what happened at
  Scotland Yard. As a matter of fact, when Hallett, the chief of the Criminal
  Intelligence Bureau, gave his instructions to the mysterious Number Six,
  there was a man of mine planted in the library, which was the next room. He
  had bored a hole through the wall, which was covered by the bookshelf in the
  chief&rsquo;s office and one of the bookshelves in the library. By taking out
  one book and pushing away another, he could hear practically all that went
  on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that is how it was done, eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
  have had a pretty good man. Well, what about the prisons?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was Hallett&rsquo;s instructions,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;He
  told this man, or this woman, that he or she had the entree to all the
  prisons. He was under the impression that I had friends or confederates who
  might be undergoing terms of imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather a stupid idea,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
  likely to have gaol-birds as your accomplices.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have you,&rdquo; answered Cæsar, a little tactlessly, Smith
  thought. But the man from Chi So&rsquo;s laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have never been in prison&mdash;yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
  you think that Welland is Number Six?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Because you
  have traced him to a few of His Majesty&rsquo;s gaols?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the kind of man who&rsquo;d take this job on?
  Didn&rsquo;t Hallett say that his agent was an amateur? All the evidence
  points to Welland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paced up and down his library, his hands behind him, a considerably
  ruffled man.</p>

  <p>Smith had come to Portland Place before breakfast that morning rather in
  the hope of seeing the girl than of interviewing Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Welland now?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Lancashire, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then
  stopped dead and looked down at his blotting pad. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see
  that before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>Cæsar took the envelope from his writing-table. It was sealed and
  addressed as was the letter he had found at his feet in Green Park. He tore
  it open, and read the typewritten message aloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clæsar, you are but mortal. Remember! Number Six!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared at the paper stupidly, then sank down heavily into his
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Smith to himself, &ldquo;our Cæsar is
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Cæsar&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled. Welland took no action, though for
  days Mr. Smith was in such a state of apprehension that he twice mislaid the
  millionaire to watch whose comings and goings was his duty. In that period
  two things occurred which worried him. The first was the absence from town of
  Stephanie. Cæsar mentioned casually that she had gone up to Scotland for a
  couple of days, and seemed on the whole relieved by her absence. And then Mr.
  Ross confined himself to his room and refused to come out and be watched.
  That did not worry Smith greatly, except that he thought it was
  extraordinary.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the second day the mystery of Mr. Ross deepened. Smith
  had been unaccountably sleepy through his dinner, and went upstairs to his
  room to lie down. He was lying on his bed, half asleep, when he heard the
  handle of his door turned, and presently somebody came in and after a
  moment&rsquo;s hesitation switched on the light. In the second of time
  between the switching on of the light and its extinguishment he caught a
  glimpse of old Ross in a dressing-gown, just a momentary glimpse, and then
  the light was snapped out. There was a patter of feet, and the old
  man&rsquo;s door closed with a slam, and Smith heard the key turned in the
  lock.</p>

  <p>That in itself was remarkable. That the man he had been set to watch
  should be watching him and, taking advantage of his absence, as he had
  evidently thought, should have entered the room, was astounding. Smith was
  quite awake now, and walked down the corridor, inspecting the door, wondering
  in his mind what excuse he could find for knocking and interviewing his
  neighbour. He thought better of it, and went downstairs into the hall; and
  there he found waiting for him the shock of his life, for, standing near the
  reception-desk was Mr. Ross, wearing a heavy ulster and a cloth cap, which
  gave his queer old face an odd appearance.</p>

  <p>Smith stared as the old man shuffled across to the elevator and was
  whisked up to his floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did Mr. Ross come from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, shaking his head.
  &ldquo;I thought he was in his room. He hasn&rsquo;t been out of his room all
  day and I certainly didn&rsquo;t see him go through the vestibule.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>He was waiting in the hall, undecided as to what he should do, when
  piquancy was added to the situation by the arrival of a small page-boy, who
  requested him to go to Mr. Ross&rsquo;s room.</p>

  <p>Tray-Bong Smith followed the diminutive messenger, and was ushered into
  the bedroom, where Mr. Ross was waiting in the identical dressing-gown he had
  worn when he had stepped into Smith&rsquo;s room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I owe you an apology, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; growled the old man.
  &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith obeyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have been wandering rather restlessly about the hotel
  of late, and I made a mistake and stepped into your room about half an hour
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Smith; &ldquo;and then you made a mistake and
  stepped into the hall, dressing yourself on route.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man&rsquo;s grim face relaxed in a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
  observant, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a wonderful detective you
  would have made!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Was he being sarcastic? Smith rather thought he was. He wondered at first
  why the old man had sent for him, but the soft sound of footsteps on the
  carpet outside the door reached his ears and he wondered no longer. Of
  course, the old man had brought him to the bedroom whilst his double was
  escaping from the sitting-room.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is related of great criminals, and no biographer would
  miss recording this aspect of their lives, that there come to them moments of
  remorse and memory, when the shades of their victims crowd in upon them and
  bring them to the borders of madness.</p>

  <p>The full extent of Cæsar Valentine&rsquo;s wrongdoing has never been, and
  probably never will be, known; but it is certain that, were he given to
  sentimental reminiscences, and did he allow his mind to dwell upon the past,
  there would be memories enough and to spare to trouble his nights.</p>

  <p>But the truth about him is that he had no regrets, and to those who knew
  him best showed no sign of remorse. Tray-Bong Smith, calling at Portland
  Place, discovered that Cæsar too had his hobby. When Smith was shown into the
  library he found Cæsar sitting at his table polishing something vigorously.
  There were two little marble moulds before him, and in one of these was a
  circular brown object, to which from time to time Cæsar applied a coat of
  amber-coloured varnish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What on earth is that?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does it look like?&rdquo; said Cæsar without looking up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It looks for all the world like a button.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just what it is,&rdquo; said Cæsar Valentine
  cheerfully. &ldquo;You never suspected me of being a button maker?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith looked closer, and found that the other had spoken the truth. It was
  a button, a very commonplace, bone-looking button, and when Cæsar had prised
  it out of the mould and turned it over and over on his hand admiringly, he
  placed it on a sheet of paper and put the paper on the mantelshelf.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A new process,&rdquo; said Cæsar carelessly. &ldquo;There might be
  a lot of money in this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a weird devil,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;I hardly know
  what to make of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar smiled as he collected the moulds and the other implements he had
  been employing, and put them in a drawer of his desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know somebody who doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of you,&rdquo;
  he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Smith quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A hard-faced gentleman named Steele. I believe he is a
  detective-sergeant at Scotland Yard. He has been watching you&mdash;I suppose
  you know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was not aware of it,&rdquo; said Smith, and Cæsar laughed at his
  discomfiture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you walk into the drawing-room and look through the window, you
  will see him standing on the opposite side of the road,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Smith went out of the room and returned presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s
  Steele. I don&rsquo;t know the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make yourself comfortable, Smith,&rdquo; said Cæsar, dismissing the
  detective with a characteristic gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a
  proposal up to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting. Is there money in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A great deal of money in it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for you and for
  me. I want you to marry Stephanie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith half-rose from his chair in astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marry Stephanie?&rdquo; he said incredulously. &ldquo;Your
  daughter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you to marry Stephanie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is why I
  attached you to my entourage. You don&rsquo;t suppose I wanted to hire an
  assassin to settle my feuds, do you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I watched you for a long time in Paris,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
  &ldquo;You were the kind of man that I'd been looking for for a year.
  You&rsquo;re educated, you were once a gentleman, you have a manner, and to
  my surprise I found Stephanie speaking quite approvingly of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As a possible husband?&rdquo; asked Smith dryly.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t discuss you in that aspect,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Smith&rsquo;s heart was beating rapidly. He had to exercise all his powers
  to keep his face expressionless. Stephanie! It was incredible and in some
  respects terrible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re not married already?&rdquo; asked Cæsar, and
  Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That, of course, would have complicated matters,&rdquo; nodded
  Cæsar. &ldquo;As things stand now, the matter is easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled open a drawer and took out a paper, handing it to the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is an agreement, you will observe, as between you and me, that
  in the event of your wife inheriting a fortune, you will deliver to me
  one-half of your share.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It required all Smith&rsquo;s self-control to keep his voice steady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose my&mdash;wife does not agree?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That will be settled before your marriage,&rdquo; said Cæsar.
  &ldquo;She will sign a document undertaking to place three-quarters of her
  inheritance in your hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith laughed, a helpless, irritating laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a lot for granted,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stephanie will agree,&rdquo; replied Cæsar, and pushed a bell on
  his table. A servant came in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask Miss Valentine to come to the library,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; demanded the agitated Smith when
  the man had left. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to ask her now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Cæsar sharply.</p>

  <p>The girl came in and nodded to Tray-Bong Smith, and looked enquiringly at
  her father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stephanie, I have just designed your future,&rdquo; said
  Valentine.</p>

  <p>She did not reply, but her eyes never left his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have decided,&rdquo; said Cæsar, leaning back in his chair and
  putting his finger-tips together, &ldquo;that you shall marry my friend Mr.
  Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl&rsquo;s mouth opened in an &ldquo;oh!&rdquo; of astonishment as
  she looked from Cæsar to the awkward young man who stood crumbling his soft
  hat in his hand.</p>

  <p>Smith expected an outburst and a refusal; he might have expected tears; he
  certainly did not anticipate the course of the conversation which followed.
  The girl had gone white. She was surprised but not horrified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she said meekly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish the wedding to take place next week,&rdquo; Cæsar went on.
  &ldquo;I can give you a generous allowance, and at my death you will inherit
  a considerable amount of property.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall require of you that you will sign an agreement with your
  future&mdash;husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith stood on one foot in his embarrassment.</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;&mdash;that three-quarters of the money which you may
  inherit from me or from anybody else will be assigned to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl looked at Smith, a long, scrutinising glance, which he could not
  meet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Smith willing?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite willing,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;You understand,
  Stephanie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Cæsar, and with a gracious smile dismissed
  her.</p>

  <p>Smith sat there spellbound, incapable of speech, and Cæsar looked at him
  curiously with a cynical little smile on his handsome face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Smith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you seem to be somewhat
  overcome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what you have done?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Cæsar coolly. &ldquo;I have given you a
  very charming wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have engaged your daughter to a man&mdash;like me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was something in his tone which led Cæsar to scrutinise him more
  keenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you suffering from
  a conscience?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My conscience has never troubled me very much,&rdquo; replied
  Smith, shaking his head, &ldquo;and to ease your mind I can tell you that I
  do not intend turning over a new leaf. No, what puzzles me is your condition
  of mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I assure you it is normal,&rdquo; replied Cæsar.</p>

  <p>There was a faint click and he looked round. Near the fireplace was a
  small polished wooden box with two apertures. Behind one of these a little
  red disk had fallen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my detector,&rdquo; smiled Cæsar. &ldquo;There are three
  telephone extensions in this house, and I had that fixed so that I might know
  if any of my conversations were being overheard. That shows that one of the
  telephones is in use and that the receiver is off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled his own instrument towards him and gently released the hook,
  covering the transmitter with his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is sometimes useful to know what one&rsquo;s servants are
  talking about,&rdquo; he said, and put the receiver to his ear.</p>

  <p>Smith, watching him, saw his face harden. He did not utter a sound, but
  sat motionless until the little red disk disappeared. Then he restored his
  receiver to the hook and stood up. What he had heard must have been more than
  ordinarily unnerving. For the second time Smith saw his employer really
  troubled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he said suddenly, and walked from the room,
  Smith at his heels. He passed up the stairs to the second floor, and pausing
  before a door, he beckoned Smith with a gesture and walked in. It was
  evidently Stephanie&rsquo;s own room. Smith recognised this by the furnishing
  and decoration long before he saw the girl, who had risen at Cæsar&rsquo;s
  entrance as though she had some premonition of its import.</p>

  <p>Cæsar&rsquo;s face was set and ugly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want me, father?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To whom were you telephoning?&rdquo; he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Telephoning?&rdquo; The other man surprised a look of alarm.
  &ldquo;To a friend&mdash;to a girl friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Cæsar harshly. &ldquo;You were
  telephoning to Ross. When did you meet Ross?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were telling him of my plan to make you marry Smith, and you
  were arranging to meet him this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did you meet Ross? Under what circumstances? Answer me.&rdquo;
  He strode across the room and caught her by her shoulders, and Smith
  followed, him. &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; shouted Cæsar, and shook her.</p>

  <p>Then Smith caught his arm and pulled him gently backward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn you! Don&rsquo;t interfere!&rdquo; snapped Cæsar. &ldquo;I am
  going to get the truth out of this girl. What have you told Ross? By heaven!
  I&rsquo;ll kill you if you don&rsquo;t answer me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl&rsquo;s pleading eyes looked past her father to Tray-Bong Smith,
  and that unworthy man tightened his grip on Cæsar&rsquo;s arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to do any good by bullying her,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried Cæsar savagely, but the grip on his arm was
  surprisingly firm, and he released the girl. But he was not done with
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Upstairs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She obeyed, and the two men followed. On the top floor was a room looking
  out from the back of the house, and into this the big man thrust the
  girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay there until you learn to speak,&rdquo; he said,
  and he slammed the door upon her, and, turning the key in the lock, put it
  into his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Smith, you&rsquo;ll wait here until I come back. I&rsquo;m going to
  settle with this young lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no warder,&rdquo; said Smith sulkily, and the other
  stormed at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fool! You madman! Don&rsquo;t you realise that you&rsquo;re
  placing your life in this girl&rsquo;s hands? If she is in communication with
  Ross, if she has told him things such as she might have told him&mdash;if she
  knows My God! I wonder if she knows!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood biting his fingers and scowling at the closed door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait here on the landing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will be back in
  half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was gone less than that time, and came back white with rage, coming up
  the stairs of the house two at a time. Smith was waiting on the landing, a
  lank cigarette drooping from his mouth, his hands thrust into his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you so. This girl has betrayed me to Ross. She
  knows&mdash;damn her! She knows!&rdquo; said Cæsar breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Knows what?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She knows that she is Welland&rsquo;s daughter. You fool,
  didn&rsquo;t you guess that all along?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welland&rsquo;s daughter! The heiress to Ross&rsquo;s millions. It
  isn&rsquo;t essential that this girl should live&mdash;not essential to me,
  you understand, Smith? If the little fool had kept her mouth shut! How she
  discovered the fact that she was Welland&rsquo;s daughter is a mystery to
  me&mdash;we could have been rich men, and we may be rich men still.
  You&rsquo;re in the swim as deeply as I am. It&rsquo;s our lives that are at
  stake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Smith with a return to his drawl. &ldquo;What is
  the commission? Do I cut her throat? Because if you tell me to do that, I
  reply &lsquo;Nothing doing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar swallowed his rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need do nothing,&rdquo; he said in a quieter tone, &ldquo;but
  you&rsquo;ve got to help me&mdash;after.&rdquo; He took a key from his pocket
  and pushed it in the lock, then took a little silver box from his waistcoat
  pocket. &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Smith, and a slow smile
  dawned on Cæsar&rsquo;s face. He opened the door and stepped in, and there
  was a momentary silence. Then a curse came from the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; said Smith in a tone of amazement.
  &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked into the room, but it was empty. The windows were closed; there
  was no other door, but the girl had vanished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, look, look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith could have sworn he heard Cæsar&rsquo;s teeth chatter as he pointed
  with shaking fingers to one of the walls. There was an envelope suspended by
  its gummed edge. In pencil were the five words:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cæsar, you are but mortal,&rdquo; and in the corner, the cipher
  &ldquo;Six.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The next day Cæsar had disappeared from London, leaving a hurried note for
  his confederate. It contained peremptory instructions for Smith that he
  should take up his quarters in Portland Place pending Cæsar&rsquo;s return;
  and this was an invitation which Mr. Smith accepted without hesitation; for
  his consuming vice was curiosity. So to Portland Place he came, occupying
  Cæsar&rsquo;s own room.</p>

  <p>It somewhat interfered with his comfort that before leaving Cæsar had
  summarily dismissed the modest staff of servants that ran the house. Mr.
  Smith sympathised with an indignant butler, and left a protesting footman
  with the impression that in Smith he had a friend for life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was only the young lady that kept me in this job,&rdquo; said
  the butler. &ldquo;Mr. Valentine is not the kind of gentleman that I like to
  be in service with. He&rsquo;s here to-day and gone to-morrow, so to speak,
  and for months there&rsquo;s nobody in this house except all sorts of queer
  people&mdash;begging your pardon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;m
  queer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The young lady was a perfect hangel,&rdquo; said the butler
  solemnly. &ldquo;A real lady if ever there was one. And a wonderful maker of
  images.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; nodded Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She worked in wax. She made a model of me, sir, that was so
  lifelike that my wife said she wouldn&rsquo;t know me and the statue
  apart,&rdquo; said the butler impressively. &ldquo;She had only to look at a
  person once or twice and she could make a sort of statue of him&mdash;what do
  you call it, head and shoulders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bust?&rdquo; suggested Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word. I never knew whether it was bust or
  burst&mdash;bust seems a bit vulgar to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith got rid of the loquacious old gentleman, for he was impatient to
  explore the conservatory workroom and particularly to examine the contents of
  the mystery cupboard. He had formed his own ideas as to what he would
  discover; and when, with his skeleton key, he turned the lock and flung back
  the door, he sat down and admired the artistry of this girl.</p>

  <p>Facing him was a most lifelike Mr. Ross. It was not Mr. Ross really, but a
  hard wax mask that hung on a peg; and next to Mr. Ross was Cæsar
  himself&mdash;unmistakably Cæsar, with the fine nose, the full lips and the
  womanly chin. Next to these exhibits&mdash;and Smith went red and
  hot&mdash;was a life-size mask of Smith himself. He took it down, fixed it to
  his face, and looked at himself in a small round mirror that hung on the
  wall. The eye-spaces had been so cut and thinned that it was almost
  impossible to detect where the real man and the counterfeit began and
  ended.</p>

  <p>The mask did not fit him well. It was made for a smaller face&mdash;the
  face of Miss Stephanie Welland. He passed his delicate fingers over the
  interior with a loving touch, and laid the thing upon the bench. Then he sat
  down to consider the situation. It was Stephanie who had impersonated old Mr.
  Ross at the hotel, Stephanie who had come in to search his room, believing he
  was away, and Stephanie who had made her escape by the kitchen entrance of
  the hotel. He had guessed all that, but he had not believed it possible that
  her disguise could be so perfect.</p>

  <p>So old Mr. Ross knew that she was his granddaughter, and had gone
  away&mdash;where? He had been absent two days whilst Stephanie was
  impersonating him in his rooms (Smith remembered that Cæsar had told him that
  she had gone to Scotland). There would be little difficulty in imposing upon
  the servants of the hotel. Mr. Ross was a tetchy man and the servant never
  went to his rooms unless they were sent for. That was one part of the mystery
  cleared up, at any rate.</p>

  <p>The box which Stephanie had received from the American lawyers, and which
  she had opened, had obviously contained particulars of her own birth. When
  Cæsar said that Mrs. Welland&rsquo;s girl had died he had lied as surely as
  when he had spoken of the unfortunate wife of John Welland as being dead; for
  that she was the woman of the manacles, the tragic figure that crossed the
  midnight lawn at Maison Laffitte, Smith was certain.</p>

  <p>He sat for an hour regarding these examples of Stephanie Welland&rsquo;s
  artistic training, then he gathered the masks together, wrapped them in paper
  and carried them to his rooms. Somehow he knew instinctively that the days of
  Cæsar Valentine were numbered, and incidentally the days of Tray-Bong Smith.
  He shrugged his shoulders at the thought.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE LAST COUP</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is a little hotel overlooking the beauties of
  Babbacombe Bay in Devonshire. Its lawn stretches to the edge of the cliff;
  its gardens are secluded from public view by high hedges of rambler roses.
  Under a big garden umbrella sat an old man and a girl. A table was spread for
  breakfast, and Mr. Ross was reading the morning newspaper whilst Stephanie
  was looking out over the sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, putting down the paper and looking over
  his glasses with a puzzled frown, &ldquo;this is the third day, and we have
  heard no news from M. Lecomte.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl patted his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re likely to get news for a little
  while,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure M. Lecomte is doing his best.
  He searched Cæsar&rsquo;s chateau from end to end, and he is perfectly
  confident that my mother is alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she was not there,&rdquo; persisted the old man, shaking his
  head. &ldquo;That is bad. This man Cæsar is a devil, I tell
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She had been there a few days before,&rdquo; said the girl.
  &ldquo;This woman&mdash;what is her name, Madonna Beatrice?&mdash;admitted it
  when they arrested her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has Cæsar heard of her arrest?&rdquo; asked the other quickly.</p>

  <p>The girl made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t really worry as to whether Cæsar has heard or not. I
  am confident that he brought mother to England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man muttered something uncomplimentary to the French police.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;d only searched the chateau when I was in
  Paris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there were all sorts of formalities to be
  overcome. Apparently Cæsar is regarded as an American subject, and they had
  to consult the Consulate; and then the infernal Consulate had to consult
  somebody else to discover whether he was American or English. Who was this
  Madonna person?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An old servant of the Valentines, I believe,&rdquo; said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall have him yet,&rdquo; muttered the old man, and took up his
  paper again.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Tray-Bong Smith made his appearance, a passable
  figure in grey flannels, who strolled nonchalantly across the lawn toward the
  group. At sight of him the girl rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Ross sharply. &ldquo;Mr.
  Smith?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; said Tray-Bong Smith. &ldquo;I have
  not the slightest intention of joining your party, but I have very specific
  instructions from my worthy friend Mr. Valentine to present myself here at
  nine o&rsquo;clock, and here I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old man scowled up at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you can go as quickly as you came,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
  &ldquo;We want no people of your calibre here, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A car had stopped on the public road opposite the entrance to the hotel
  garden. The girl heard it and Smith heard it, but neither attached any
  significance to so commonplace an event. Perhaps, had they seen the man and
  woman who alighted, or been witnesses of the menacing gesture of the man and
  the shrinking submission of the woman, even the venom in the old man&rsquo;s
  tone would have been unheeded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can go back to your employer,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;and
  tell him that I am afraid neither of him nor of his hired cut-throats. Such
  men as you, enjoying all the advantages of education and birth, who descend
  to the level you have reached, are more contemptible in the eyes of decent
  men and women than the poor wretched creatures who fill our gaols.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith smiled a little crookedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your views upon my character,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;are
  particularly interesting. Your granddaughter will probably tell
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and here came the grand interruption.</p>

  <p>Smith alone of the three understood just what it meant and drew a long,
  sighing breath as a faded woman walked haltingly towards them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>The girl was watching the intruder wonderingly. The old man still held to
  his scowl. The newcomer was a frail lady with an old colourless face, and the
  hands she put before her as she groped like a blind woman across the lawn
  were blue-veined and almost transparent. Then the girl screamed and flew
  towards her, and at her approach the woman halted and shrank back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;mother, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; sobbed
  Stephanie, and caught the faded creature in her arms. . . .</p>

  <p>A waiter staggering under a laden tray came down a narrow path that led
  from the kitchen through the rosary into the lawn. He was surprised to see a
  tall man sitting on one of the garden seats that abound in these shady
  walks&mdash;more surprised when the stranger beckoned to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;could you get me a glass of
  water?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly sir,&rdquo; said the waiter. &ldquo;I am just taking
  coffee down to a gentleman on the lawn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take you a minute,&rdquo; said the man faintly and
  took out a handful of silver. &ldquo;I have heart trouble. My life may depend
  upon your help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The waiter put down the tray and hurried back to the kitchen and returned
  in something under a minute. The stranger took the glass with a shaking
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I feel better now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The waiter picked up the tray, pocketed the liberal tip, and carried the
  tray to this strangely assorted group on the lawn. When he returned, the
  stranger had gone.</p>

  <p>The fourth member of that group, Smith, felt awkward and out of place. Yet
  he must hold on, for Cæsar could not have telegraphed to him insisting upon
  his arrival at the Bellevue at an exact hour unless there was more of the
  game to be played out. He had drawn aside from the three, and heard little of
  what was said. He recognised the woman immediately as the apparition he had
  looked upon from his bedroom window at Maisons Laffitte.</p>

  <p>It was old Ross who beckoned him forward, and if his tone was not
  friendly, it had lost some of its antagonism.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;did you know of
  this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;except that I suspect this
  lady was kept a prisoner at Cæsar&rsquo;s house at Maisons
  Laffitte.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know why he has released her, why he brought her here this
  morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know nothing except that I had instructions from my employer to
  be here at a certain hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was an awkward moment and a situation which required the most delicate
  handling. After a little while he was withdrawing when the woman beckoned him
  back. She was sitting looking listlessly from her daughter to the old man. A
  dazed, grey woman, incapable, it seemed, of understanding what was going on
  around her, but at the man&rsquo;s movements she roused herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Smith?&rdquo; she said. She spoke slowly as one who was not
  accustomed to speaking. &ldquo;He told me you were to wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Smith quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was there&mdash;in the car.&rdquo; She pointed to the way she
  had come. &ldquo;But I think he has gone now. He did not wish to wait and see
  father,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;But you were here. He said that. We
  must always do what Cæsar says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith came back to the little group and at a nod from the old man seated
  himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I signed the paper he asked me to sign,&rdquo; said the woman,
  &ldquo;on the boat yesterday, and one of the sailors&mdash;a steward, I
  think&mdash;signed it too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A paper?&rdquo; said the girl quickly. &ldquo;What kind of paper,
  mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman's brows contracted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a peculiar
  word.&rdquo; She looked strangely at the girl. &ldquo;I had a little child
  once,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>Stephanie drew the woman&rsquo;s head down upon her shoulder and comforted
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us hear the story, my dear,&rdquo; said Ross gently. &ldquo;I
  am sure Mr. Smith will not mind staying. Stephanie, my child, pour out the
  coffee, and a cup for Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a week ago, I think,&rdquo; said the woman more calmly.
  &ldquo;Cæsar came to the house and told me he was taking me back to England
  to my father, and of course I was glad. It has been very&mdash;very dull at
  the Chateau, you know. And everything has been so mysterious, and sometimes
  Cæsar has been quite cruel. They were afraid of my running away; that&rsquo;s
  why they only used to allow me to come out at night with horrible things on
  my hands and ankles so that I couldn&rsquo;t run. I tried to run away
  once,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Smith was watching her over the brim of his cup as he sipped his
  coffee.</p>

  <p>Stephanie had lifted her cup and it was at her lips when Smith struck it
  from her hand. The hot coffee spilt over her dainty dress and she sprang up
  in alarm and indignation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; said Smith coolly. &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt the
  story and the light repast; but there&rsquo;s a taste about this coffee which
  I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Ross.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only mean,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, &ldquo;that it seems to me
  rather likely that friend Cæsar is removing the just and the unjust at one
  fell swoop; and, speaking for myself, I should prefer to live a little while
  longer.&rdquo; He smelt the coffee, then beckoned the waiter, who was visible
  at the far end of the lawn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coffee tastes funny, sir?&rdquo; said the waiter in surprise.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why that should be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was lifting the cup when Smith stopped him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless you want to be a very dead waiter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
  should recommend you not to taste it. Just tell me. Did you bring this coffee
  straight from the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the man, mystified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you meet anybody on the way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;yes, I did,&rdquo; corrected the man. &ldquo;There
  was a gentleman who was ill and asked me to get him a glass of
  water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which you did,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;leaving the coffee behind.
  I see.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;All right, that will do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I take the coffee back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Smith grimly. &ldquo;Leave the coffee
  here. I want to make absolutely certain that Cæsar Valentine has
  double-crossed me, but I&rsquo;d rather like to make the experiment on
  something less human. Bring me a bottle&mdash;a whisky bottle will
  do&mdash;to put this coffee in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence when the waiter had gone. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
  mean to suggest that he would be as diabolical as that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not concerned with the morality of his actions or the
  purity of his intentions,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;but I am pretty certain
  that our friend contemplated a vulgar and wholesale murder which would remove
  in one swoop every person with a knowledge of his infamy.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE END</h2>

  <p class="first">CÆSAR VALENTINE received the note written from
  Bilton&rsquo;s Hotel, and was considerably annoyed to discover that the
  signature was T. B. Smith. It was a note at once peremptory and reassuring,
  for Smith had made no reference to the deplorable happenings at Babbacombe on
  the previous day.</p>

  <p>Cæsar came to Bilton&rsquo;s Hotel and went straight up to Smith&rsquo;s
  room. Remarkably enough it was Ross&rsquo;s old room, but Cæsar did not seem
  to notice this. Smith was sprawling in an armchair, smoking the pipe of
  peace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo! You back?&rdquo; greeted Cæsar. &ldquo;I expected you at
  Portland Place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut the door and sit down,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;I am not
  returning to Portland Place. I think this little caravanserai is
  safer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Cæsar with a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean, Valentine, that you&rsquo;ve tried to double-cross me, and
  it&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll do it. Now I&rsquo;m talking to you as
  man to man, and get all that I say into your mind and memory. I came in with
  you on the understanding that we were going to play fair all the way round,
  that there were to be no mysteries and no secrets. Now, you know my record
  and I pretty well know yours, and I want the whole facts of certain
  circumstances and certain relationships of yours in the past before I go any
  farther.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I refuse to offer you my confidence?&rdquo; asked Cæsar.
  &ldquo;Are you going to the police or something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to the police, and I&rsquo;m not particularly
  afraid of the police coming to me,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;You have nothing
  against me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except a murder in Paris,&rdquo; suggested Cæsar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; Smith shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Paris is
  Paris, and London is London. Cæsar, you tried yesterday morning to put me out
  of action. Don&rsquo;t lie about it; I know just the strength of that affair,
  and I&rsquo;ve had the coffee analysed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Coffee analysed?&rdquo; said Cæsar with a puzzled air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come off it!&rdquo; said Smith crudely. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get down
  to facts. There&rsquo;s a pretty big combination against you, and probably
  against me. I think it&rsquo;s stronger against you than me. Now you know
  just how much you have to fear, and I think if you let your mind wander
  round, you&rsquo;ll guess the identity of your weird enemy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean Number Six?&rdquo; said Cæsar sharply. &ldquo;It must be
  either Welland or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or the Gale boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us hear all about the Gale boy,&rdquo; said Smith,
  &ldquo;because this is something I have not heard before from you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cæsar thought for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you might as well know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;George Gale,
  the bank manager, had a son. I believe after the tragedy he went to the
  Argentine, and I am under the impression that he is still there. In fact, I
  seem to remember your telling me as much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you fear Gale&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; he asked, and Cæsar
  did not reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the truth about that Gale case, Cæsar? I can&rsquo;t go on
  much longer unless I know just what difficulties I have to face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gale died,&rdquo; said Cæsar sullenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His death was providential, I gather,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In a way it was,&rdquo; said Cæsar. &ldquo;I owed him a lot of
  money; in fact I had put him in wrong. If he had opened his mouth I should
  have been arrested for fraud, and on the day of his death he had practically
  decided to make a statement to the police. I knew of his practice of taking a
  nerve tonic at mid-day, and managed to get hold of one of his empty bottles
  and substituted it for the one in his study.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that empty bottle contained something particularly noxious in
  the way of acids, I presume?&rdquo; said Smith steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hydrocyanic,&rdquo; replied Cæsar. &ldquo;Now you know the whole
  truth of it. I&rsquo;m not going to explain to you the nature of the fraud,
  but it was a pretty bad one, and the old man was, of course, not in
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith did not reply. He sat hunched up in his Chair, looking at the
  carpet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Somehow I thought there would
  come a time in our association when you would talk, and talk freely. You seem
  to be in pretty bad trouble, Cæsar,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Just leave me
  to think things out, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Cæsar went back to Portland Place cursing himself that he had been so
  communicative. As for Smith, he was interviewing Detective Steele, who had
  occupied the next room and had taken a shorthand note of the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>Cæsar had gone to Bilton&rsquo;s Hotel expecting something more than
  reproaches from his confederate, and it was absolutely essential that he
  should placate him, even if in the act of placation it was necessary to throw
  some light upon the dark past.</p>

  <p>It is history now that Cæsar Valentine was arrested as he was entering his
  house and taken to Marlborough Street Police Station and charged with murder
  and attempted murder. He was relieved to discover a handcuffed Smith waiting
  in the charge-room to share his ignominy.</p>

  <p>They were rushed before the magistrate, charged and remanded, and for
  seven days these two men occupied adjoining cells in Brixton Gaol, and
  enjoyed the extraordinary privilege of meeting together in the
  exercise-ground. Then one morning Smith disappeared, and Cæsar did not see
  him again until he stepped on to the witness-stand at the Old Bailey and
  began his evidence thus:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is John Gale. I am an officer of the Criminal Investigation
  Bureau, and I am known in the official records as Number Six....&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A week after the trial and its inevitable ending, John Gale, alias Smith,
  alias Number Six, met a pretty girl in the tea-room of the Piccadilly
  Hotel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re awfully glad it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo; said
  the girl, and Gale nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I wanted to know from you,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never understood your attitude to me, Stephanie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said demurely. &ldquo;I thought
  I&rsquo;d been rather nice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. I mean, when you were watching Cæsar
  Valentine in Paris, you were the witness of what was apparently a terrible
  crime on the Quai des Fleurs.&rdquo; She nodded. &ldquo;Yet you never showed
  the horror and the loathing which one would have expected a properly
  constituted girl would have expressed for a man who had been guilty of such a
  vile deed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I looked over the parapet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I really
  did think a murder had been committed. But when I saw the two boats with the
  French Police picking up the murdered man, and heard him using terrible
  language about the necessity for jumping in the Seine at midnight, I knew the
  whole scene had been carefully staged in order to bring you into close
  contact with Cæsar Valentine. If I had any doubt at all,&rdquo; she said,
  &ldquo;that doubt was dissipated when you let me out of the room in Portland
  Place and I saw you scribbling your message on an envelope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the only possible way I could get into close touch with
  Cæsar, as soon as I found he had taken an interest in me, as I knew he would,
  after the stories I had carefully circulated through Chi So&rsquo;s about my
  depravity. I had those boats and that &lsquo;murdered man&rsquo; waiting on
  the Quai des Fleurs night after night until a favourable opportunity
  occurred. You see, I&rsquo;m only an amateur detective, but I have wonderful
  ideas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What I admire about you,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;is your extreme
  modesty.&rdquo; Then, more seriously: &ldquo;Have you discovered my
  father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found him weeks ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve been rather cruel in keeping
  him away from mother and me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Surely there is no
  reason why we cannot see him at once?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a very great reason,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;In
  three weeks&rsquo; time I will bring you to your father, who is wholly
  ignorant of the fact that you and his wife are alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why in three weeks?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is my secret and his,&rdquo; said John Gale quietly, and the
  girl did not pursue the subject.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Cæsar Valentine was destined to meet his enemy first. On a certain morning
  they aroused him from a deep sleep, and he woke to find that the convict
  clothes he had been wearing the day before had been taken away, and that the
  suit he had worn at his trial had been substituted.</p>

  <p>He rose and dressed, and refused the ministrations of the chaplain, and
  ate a hearty breakfast. At a quarter to eight came the governor, and behind
  him John Gale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Gale!&rdquo; Cæsar greeted him. &ldquo;This is the end of
  the road. It has been a most amusing experience. Take my advice,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Have a hobby; it keeps you out of mischief. Even if it&rsquo;s
  only button-making, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Gale made no response, and the Governor signalled to somebody at the door,
  and a man walked in with the straps of his office in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Cæsar, and to everybody&rsquo;s surprise he
  fell on his knees by the side of his box and buried his face in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>Then he rose, turned, and faced Welland.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he breathed, and he seemed to have difficulty in
  talking. &ldquo;You&mdash;the hangman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have waited for this day,&rdquo; he said, and deftly strapped
  Cæsar&rsquo;s hands behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have waited in vain,&rdquo; said Cæsar loudly. &ldquo;Look
  there, my clever fellow. How many buttons are there on my coat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Welland looked and saw that a thread was hanging where a button had
