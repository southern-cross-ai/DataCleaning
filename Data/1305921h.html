<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">SOUTH of Florence by some sixty miles, and west
of Rome by almost thrice the distance, upon three hills, is
Siena, the most equable of the cities of Tuscany.</p>

<p>On the Terzo di Città in I know not what <i>contrada</i>, is
the Palazzo Festini.</p>

<p>It stands aloof in its gloomy and dilapidated magnificence,
and since it dates from the adjacent Baptistery of S. Giovanni,
it leaves the impression of being a crumbling and disgruntled
fragment of the sacred edifice that has wandered away in sullen
rage to decay at its leisure.</p>

<p>Here, in penurious grandeur, dwelt the Festinis, who claimed
descent from none other than Guido Novello, of whom Compagni,
the arch-apologist, wrote: "<i>Il conte Guido non aspettò il
fine, ma senza dare colpo di spada si parti.</i>"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Count Guido did not wait for the end, but
departed without a stroke of his sword.]</p>

<p>The Festini was a family to the name of which the Italian
nobility listened with immobile faces. And if you chose to
praise them they would politely agree; or if you condemned them
they would listen in silence; but if you questioned them as to
their standing in the hierarchy, you might be sure that, from
Rome to Milan, your inquiry would be met by an immediate, but
even, change of subject.</p>

<p>The Festinis, whatever might be their relationship with Guido
the Coward, effectively carried on the methods of the Polomei,
the Salvani, the Ponzi, the Piccolomini, and the
Forteguerri.</p>

<p>The vendettas of the middle ages were revived and sustained
by these products of nineteenth century civilization, and old
Salvani Festini had, as was notoriously evident, gone outside
the circumscribed range of his own family grievances, and had
allied himself, either actively or sympathetically, with every
secret society that menaced the good government of Italy.</p>

<p>It was a hot June afternoon, in the year '99, when a man and
two youths sat at their midday meal in the gloomy dining-room of
the Palazzo.</p>

<p>The man who sat at the head of the table was, despite his
age, a broad-shouldered man of apparent vitality; a leonine head
surmounted by a mane of grey hair would have distinguished him
without the full beard which fell over his black velvet
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Yet, for all his patriarchal appearance, there was something
in the seamed white face, in the cold eyes which stared from
under his busy brows, which was sinister and menacing.</p>

<p>He ate in silence, scarcely troubling to answer the questions
which were put to him.</p>

<p>The boy on his right was a beautiful lad of seventeen; he had
the ivory complexion, the perfect, clean-cut, patrician features
which characterized the Italian nobility. His lustrous brown
eyes, his delicate mouth, his almost effeminate chin, testified
for the race from which he sprang.</p>

<p>The young man sitting opposite was four years older. He was
at the stage when youth was merging into manhood, with
disastrous consequences to facial contours. He seemed thin,
almost hollow-jawed, and only the steady quality of his grave
eyes saved him from positive ugliness.</p>

<p>"But, father," asked the younger lad, "what makes you think
that the Government suspects that you know about the 'Red
Hand'?"</p>

<p>The older youth said nothing, but his inquiring eyes were
fixed upon his father.</p>

<p>Salvani Festini brought his mind back to the present with a
start.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>His voice was gruff, but not unkindly, as he addressed the
boy; and the light of unconscious pride which shone in his eyes
as he looked at the youth, softened the forbidding expression of
his face.</p>

<p>"I am very well informed, my son," he said with a gentle
growl. "You know we have excellent information. The carbineers
are pursuing their investigations, and that infernal friend of
yours"&mdash;he turned to the elder son&mdash;"is at the head of
the inquisitors."</p>

<p>The youth addressed smiled.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>The old man shot a glance of suspicion at his son.</p>

<p>"Tillizini," he said shortly. "The old fool&mdash;why doesn't
he keep to his books and his lectures?"</p>

<p>"He has been very kind to me," said the younger man. He spoke
thoughtfully, reflectively. "I am sorry he has annoyed you,
father; but it is his business&mdash;this investigation of
crime."</p>

<p>"Crime!" roared the old man. "How dare you, a son of mine,
sitting at my own table, refer to the actions of the 'Red Hand'
as crime!"</p>

<p>His face went red with rage, and he cast a glance of
malevolence at his heir which might well have shocked a more
susceptible man.</p>

<p>But Antonio Festini was used to such exhibitions. He was
neither embarrassed nor distressed by this fresh exhibition of
his father's dislike. He knew, and did not resent, the
favouritism shown to Simone, his brother. It did not make him
love his brother less, nor dislike his father more.</p>

<p>Antonio Festini had many qualities which his countrymen do
not usually possess. This phlegmatic, philosophical attitude of
mind had been bred in him. Some remote ancestor, cool, daring,
possibly with a touch of colder blood in his ancestry, had
transmitted to this calm youth some of the power of
detachment.</p>

<p>He knew his father hated the old professor of anthropology at
Florence; for the Festinis, even to this day, preserved the
spirit of antagonism which the Sienese of half a thousand years
ago had adopted to the Florentine.</p>

<p>There were schools enough in Siena; a college most famous for
its lawyers and its doctors.</p>

<p>Simone was graduating there, and what was good enough for
Simone should surely be good enough for Antonio.</p>

<p>But the elder son had chosen Florence with that deliberation
which had always been his peculiarity, even from his earliest
childhood, and in face of all opposition, in defiance of all the
Festini tradition, it was to Florence he went.</p>

<p>Tillizini, that remarkable scientist, had conceived a
friendship for the boy; had taken him under his wing, and had
trained him in his own weird, irregular, and inconsequent
way.</p>

<p>Tillizini was a master of crime, and he possessed an
encyclopaedic knowledge of men. He was at the beck and call of
the secret police from one end of Italy to the other, and, so
rumour said, was in receipt of retaining fees from the
governments of other nations.</p>

<p>It was Tillizini who had set himself to work to track down
the "Red Hand" which had terrorized the South of Italy for so
many years, and had now extended its sphere of operations to the
north.</p>

<p>And it was a hateful fact that his work had been crowned with
success. His investigations had laid by the heels no less a
person than the considerable Matteo degli Orsoni, the Roman
lawyer, who, for so many years, had directed the operations of
one of the most powerful sections of the "Red Hand."</p>

<p>There was something like fear in the old man's breast, though
he was too good a Festini to display it; and it was fear which
leavened his rage.</p>

<p>"You shall hear a different tale of this Tillizini," he
growled, "mark you that, Antonio. Some day he will be found
dead&mdash; a knife in his heart, or his throat cut, or a bullet
wound in his head&mdash;who knows? The 'Red Hand' is no amusing
organization." He looked long and keenly at his son. Simone
leant over, his elbows on the table, his chin resting on his
hands, and eyed his brother with dispassionate interest.</p>

<p>"What does Tillizini know of me?" asked the old man suddenly.
"What have you told him?"</p>

<p>Antonio smiled.</p>

<p>"That is an absurd question, father," he said; "you do not
imagine that I should speak to Signor Tillizini of you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the other gruffly. "Oh! I know your breed.
There is something of your mother in you. Those Bonnichi would
sell their wives for a hundred lira!"</p>

<p>Not even the reference to his mother aroused the young man to
anger. He sat with his hands thrust into the pockets of his
riding breeches, his head bent a little forward, looking at his
father steadily, speculatively, curiously.</p>

<p>For a few minutes they stared at one another, and the boy on
the other side of the table glanced from father to brother, from
brother to father, eagerly.</p>

<p>At last the old man withdrew his eyes with a shrug, and
Antonio leant across the table, and plucked two grapes from a
big silver dish in the centre, with a hand to which neither
annoyance nor fear contributed a tremor.</p>

<p>The old man turned to his favourite.</p>

<p>"You may expect the birri here to-day or to-morrow," he said.
"There will be a search for papers. A crowd of dirty Neapolitans
will go rummaging through this house. I suppose you would like
me to ask your friend, Tillizini, to stay to dinner?" he said,
turning to the other with a little sneer.</p>

<p>"As to that, you must please yourself, father; I should be
very delighted if you did."</p>

<p>"By faith, you would," snarled the old man. "If I had an
assurance that the old dog would choke, I'd invite him. I know
your Tillizini," he said gratingly, "Paulo Tillizini." He
laughed, but there was no humour in his laughter.</p>

<p>Antonio rose from the table, folded his serviette into a
square and placed it neatly between the two Venetian goblets
which were in front of him.</p>

<p>"I have your permission to retire?" he said, with a
ceremonious little bow.</p>

<p>A jerk of the head was the only answer.</p>

<p>With another little bow to his brother, the young man left
the room. He walked through the flagged and gloomy hall to the
ponderous door of the Palazzo.</p>

<p>A servant in faded livery opened the door, and he stepped out
into the blinding sunlight. The heat struck up at him from the
paved street as from a blast furnace.</p>

<p>He had no definite plans for spending the afternoon, but he
was anxious to avoid any further conflict with his father; and
though he himself did not approve of the association which his
house had formed with the many desperate, guilty bands which
tyrannized over Italy, yet he was anxious to think out a method
by which the inevitable exposure and disgrace might be
avoided.</p>

<p>There was no question of sentiment as far as he was
concerned. He had reached the point where he had come to regard
not only his father, but his younger brother, so eager to assist
and so anxious for the day when he would be able to take an
active part in the operations of the League, as people outside
the range of his affections.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should gravitate towards the Piazza
del Campo. All Siena moved naturally to this historic fan-like
space, with its herring-boned brick pavement, and its
imperishable association with the trials and triumphs of
Siena.</p>

<p>He stood by the broad central pavement which marks the course
of the Pallio, deep in thought, oblivious of the many curious
glances which were thrown in his direction. For despite the heat
of the day, all Siena was abroad.</p>

<p>Had he been less engrossed by his thoughts, he might have
regarded it as curious that the Sienese, who hold this hour
sacred to the siesta, should have so thronged the square and the
street, on a hot June afternoon.</p>

<p>Standing there, absorbed by his thoughts, he heard his name
spoken softly behind him, and turned.</p>

<p>He snatched off his soft felt hat with a smile, and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you, Signor Tillizini," he said.</p>

<p>The pleasure of the meeting, however, was over-clouded a
second later, as he realized with a sense of apprehension that
the old professor's visit was not without gloomy significance to
his house.</p>

<p>Professor Tillizini, at that time, was in his eightieth year.
As straight as a die, his emaciated and aesthetic face was
relieved by two burning eyes in which the soul of the man
throbbed and lived.</p>

<p>He took the arm of his pupil and led him across the piazza at
a slow pace.</p>

<p>"Antonio mio," he said with grave affection, "I am come
because the Government desires certain information. You know,
although I have not told you, that we are inquiring into a
certain organization."</p>

<p>He laid his thin white hand upon the other's shoulder, and
stopped, peering down into the boy's face with keen
attention.</p>

<p>"Antonio," he said slowly, "that investigation is to be
directed toward your father and his actions."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "I know," he said simply.</p>

<p>"I am glad you know," said Tillizini, with a little sigh of
relief. "It has rather worried me. I wanted to tell you some
time ago that such an inquiry was inevitable, but I did not
think I would be doing my duty to the State if I gave that
information."</p>

<p>Antonio smiled a little sadly.</p>

<p>"It does not matter, Signor," he said; "as a matter of fact,
my father knows, and is expecting you."</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"That I expected too," he said, "or rather let me be
frank&mdash;I hoped he would be; for a policeman expected is a
policeman defeated," he smiled.</p>

<p>They walked a little way in silence, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied in your mind that my father is concerned
in all these outrages?" asked Antonio.</p>

<p>The old man looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"Are you not also?" he asked.</p>

<p>The heir of the Festinis made no reply. As if by mutual
consent they changed the subject and spoke of other matters.</p>

<p>The old man was awaiting the arrival of the police officers;
that much Antonio guessed.</p>

<p>They spoke of the college at Florence and of mutual friends.
Then, by easy stages, the professor approached his favourite
subject&mdash;the subject of his life-work.</p>

<p>"It is a thousand pities, is it not?" he said, "that, having
got so far, the good God will not give me another hundred years
of life?"</p>

<p>He smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"At the end of which time I should require another hundred,"
he said philosophically. "It is as well, perhaps, that we cannot
have our desires. "It would have satisfied me," he continued,
"had I a son to carry on my work. Here again I am denied. I have
not, I admit," he said, with that naiveté which was his charm,
"even in my life provided myself with a wife. That was an
oversight for which I am now being punished."</p>

<p>He stopped as a tall officer in the uniform of the carbineers
came swinging across the Piazza del Campo, and Antonio Festini
instinctively stepped away from his master's side.</p>

<p>The two spoke together, and by and by, with a little nod of
farewell and a fleeting shadow of pity in his eyes, Tillizini
accompanied the tall officer in the direction of the Palazzo
Festini.</p>

<p>Antonio watched him until he was out of sight. Then he
resumed his aimless pacing up and down the Piazza, his hands
behind his back, his head sunk forward on his breast.</p>

<p>Tillizini accompanied the tall officer to the Festini Palace.
He pulled the rusty bell that hung by the side of the great
door, and was admitted.</p>

<p>He was conducted with all the ceremony which his obvious rank
demanded&mdash;for was not there an officer of carbineers
accompanying him, and did not that officer treat him with great
deference?&mdash;to the big salon of the Festinis.</p>

<p>It was an apartment bleak and bare. The ancient splendours of
the painted ceiling were dim and dingy, the marble flagged floor
was broken in places, and no attempt had been made to repair it.
The few chairs, and the French table which had been pushed
against the wall, seemed lost in that wilderness of chilly
marble.</p>

<p>In a few moments Count Festini came in. He was still dressed
in his velvet coat and waistcoat, and the riding breeches and
boots which he and his sons invariably wore, for they were great
horsemen, and had but that one taste in common.</p>

<p>He favoured Tillizini with a bow, which the professor
returned.</p>

<p>"I am at your Excellency's disposition," he said formally,
and waited.</p>

<p>"Count Festini," said Tillizini, "I have come upon an
unpleasant mission."</p>

<p>"That is regrettable," said Count Festini shortly.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to ask you to allow me to conduct a personal
examination of your papers."</p>

<p>"That is not only unfortunate, but outrageous," said Festini,
yet without the sign of irritation which the carbineer officer,
his fingers nervously twitching the whistle which would summon
his men, had expected.</p>

<p>"It is not my wish," Tillizini went on, "to make this visit
any more disagreeable to your Excellency than is necessary,
therefore I ask you to regard me rather as a friend who desires
to clear your name from aspersions which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will spare me your speeches," said Count Festini
shortly. "I know you, Paulo Tillizini. I thought you were a
gentleman, and entrusted you with the education of my son. I
find you are a policeman. In these days," he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;" the Italian nobility&mdash;and if I remember
aright, you come from the house of one
Buonsignori?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tillizini bowed.</p>

<p>"In these days," Festini went on, "it is necessary, I
presume, for our decaying nobility to find some means of
providing portions for their marriageable daughters."</p>

<p>"In my case," said Tillizini, "that is unnecessary."</p>

<p>He spoke suavely and calmly: every word which Count Festini
had uttered was, by the code which both men understood, a deadly
insult. Yet Tillizini preserved the same outward show of
unconcern which Festini had seen so disastrously reproduced in
his son.</p>

<p>"I can only add," the old man went on, "this one
fact&mdash;that to whatever depths a member of a noble house may
sink in assisting the State to bring justice to the men who are
setting the laws of the country at defiance, it is possible,
Signor, for a man to sink still, lower, and to be one of those
whose dreadful acts, and whose cruel practices, set the
machinery of the law in motion."</p>

<p>He spoke in his passionless, even tones, and a red flush
crept over the Count's face.</p>

<p>"You may search as you wish," he said. "My house is at your
disposition. Here are my keys."</p>

<p>He produced from his pocket a steel ring on which a dozen
keys hung.</p>

<p>Tillizini made no attempt to take them.</p>

<p>"If you will conduct me to your bedroom," he said, "I shall
not trouble you with any further search."</p>

<p>For a second only Count Festini hesitated. A swift cloud of
apprehension passed across his face. Then with a bow he extended
his hand to the door.</p>

<p>He followed them into the hall and led the way up the stairs.
His room was a large one, facing the road. It was as poorly
furnished as the remainder of the house. Tillizini closed the
door behind him, and the officer stood, barring all egress.</p>

<p>"Here are my keys."</p>

<p>Again Count Festini held out the polished bunch.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not want them," said Tillizini. He stood
squarely before the man. "I think it is as well, Count," he said
gently, "that I should tell you what I know. Four days ago a man
was arrested in the act of placing a bomb on the railway line
between Rome and Florence. He was apparently a new recruit, but
after he was arrested it was discovered that he was a man who
stood very high in the councils of the Florentine branch of your
excellent society."</p>

<p>Festini said nothing. He listened with every interest.</p>

<p>"In some way," Tillizini went on, "this man had discovered
many secrets which I am sure the 'Red Hand' had no intention of
revealing. He may have acted as secretary to one of the heads of
your Order. At any rate, he knew that documents incriminating
yourself and a very large number of influential people in Italy
were secreted in this house."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Festini, coldly. "You have the keys; you may
verify for yourself the truth of your informant's statement."
Again Tillizini made no attempt to take the keys from him.</p>

<p>"He knew more than I have told," he said slowly. "He
indicated to me a hiding-place which I gather is known only to
you and to the leaders of your band."</p>

<p>He walked to the end of the room, where four long windows lit
the apartment. Between the second and the third hung a picture
in a deep gold frame. He passed his hand gingerly over the
scroll-work on the left side of the frame.</p>

<p>Presently he found what he wanted, and pressed.</p>

<p>The bottom half of the rich carving opened like a narrow
drawer.</p>

<p>Festini watched him, motionless, as he took a bundle of
papers from the secret recess behind the hinge moulding.</p>

<p>Tillizini examined them briefly at the window and placed them
carefully in the inside pocket of his coat. He looked at Festini
long and earnestly, but before he could speak the door was
opened and Simone Festini came in quickly.</p>

<p>He walked to his father.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, and bent his angry brows upon the old
professor.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, my son," said Count Festini.</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon the boy's head and smiled.</p>

<p>"You must go downstairs until I have finished my business
with his Excellency."</p>

<p>The boy hesitated.</p>

<p>"Why should I go?" he asked.</p>

<p>He scented the danger and was hard to move. He looked round
from one to the other, alert, suspicious, almost cat-like.</p>

<p>"If anything should happen to me, Simone," said Count Festini
softly, "I beg you to believe that I have provided for you
handsomely, and there is a provision which is greater than any I
can offer you&mdash;the protection and the friendship, and as I
hope one day, the leadership, of comrades who will serve you
well. And now you must go."</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed the young man on the cheek.</p>

<p>Simone went out, dry-eyed, but full of understanding. In the
hall below he came face to face with his brother, who had
returned from the Piazza.</p>

<p>"Come this way, Antonio," said the boy gravely.</p>

<p>He walked first into the dining-room where an hour ago they
had been seated together at their meal.</p>

<p>"Our father is under arrest, I think," he said, still coolly,
as though he were surveying a commonplace happening. "I also
think I know what will happen next. Now, I ask you, which way do
you go if I take up our father's work?"</p>

<p>His eyes were bright with suppressed excitement; he had grown
suddenly to a man in that brief consciousness of impending
responsibility.</p>

<p>Antonio looked at him sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I go the straight way, Simone," he said quietly. "Whichever
way is honest and clean and kindly, I go that way."</p>

<p>"Buono!" said the other. "Then we part here unless God sends
a miracle&mdash;you to your destiny and I to mine."</p>

<p>He stopped and went deadly white, and looking at him, Antonio
saw the beads of sweat upon his brow.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked, and stepped forward to his
side, but the boy pushed him back.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said, "nothing."</p>

<p>He held himself stiffly erect, his beautiful face raised, his
eyes fixed on the discoloured decorations of the ceiling.</p>

<p>For he had heard the pistol shot, muffled as it was by
intervening doors and thick walls, that told the end for Count
Festini.</p>

<p>Tillizini, hurrying down to break the news to him, found him
fully prepared.</p>

<p>"I thank your Excellency," said the boy. "I knew. Your
Excellency will not live to see the result of your work, for you
are an old man, but if you did, you will behold the revenge
which I shall extract from the world for this murder, for I am
very young, and, by God's favour, I have many years to live."
Tillizini said nothing, but he went back to Florence a sad
man.</p>

<p>Three months afterwards he again visited Siena, and in the
Via Cavour, in broad daylight, he was shot down by two masked
men who made good their escape; and, in his chair, at the
College of Anthropology at Florence, there reigned, in good
time, Tillizini the younger.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; SIR RALPH DELIVERS
JUDGMENT</h2>

<p class="first">IT was absurd to call the affair "the Red Hand
Trial," because the "Red Hand" had played no part in the case so
far as the burglary was concerned.</p>

<p>It was a very commonplace burglary with a well-known, albeit
humble member of Burboro's community in the dock. He had been
found in a house in the early hours of the morning, he had given
an incoherent explanation to the alert butler who had captured
him, and, beyond a rigmarole of a story that some mysterious
Italian had sent him thither, there was no hint of the workings
of the extraordinary association which at the moment agitated
the law-abiding people of Britain.</p>

<p>It was equally absurd and grossly unfair to accuse the
newspapers who referred to it as "the Red Hand Case," of
unjustifiable sensationalism. After all, there was an Italian
mentioned in connexion with the charge&mdash;quite enough in
those days of panic to justify the reference.</p>

<p>The Session House was crowded, for the case had excited more
than usual interest. All the county was there. Lady Morte-Mannery
occupied a seat on the Bench, as was her right. Most of
the house-party from East Mannery had driven over and was seated
in privileged places, to the no small inconvenience of the Bar
and the representatives of the Press, the latter of whom
bitterly and indignantly resented this encroachment upon their
already restricted domain.</p>

<p>But Sir Ralph Morte-Mannery, the Chairman of the Session, had
a short way with critics and professed, though his practice did
not always come into line with his theory, that the Press might
be ignored and impressed with a sense of its own
unworthiness.</p>

<p>The Pressmen in the Session House at Burboro' were constantly
undergoing that mysterious process which is known as "being put
in their place." They desired, most earnestly, that the
principle should be applied now, for their places were occupied
by the guests of the Chairman.</p>

<p>Hilary George, K.C., sat with his colleagues, though only as
a spectator. He was curious to see in operation the workings of
justice, as Sir Ralph conceived it.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph's sentences were notorious, his judgments had
before now come up for revision. He was, perhaps, the best hated
man in the country. Mothers frightened their obstreperous
children with references to Sir Ralph. He was the bogey man of
the poacher, a moral scarecrow to tramps, people who slept out
at night, and suchlike dangerous characters.</p>

<p>A little man, spare and bony, his clothes, though carefully
fitted, seemed to hang upon him; his face was long and white,
and solemn; his lips drooped mournfully at each corner. A pair
of gold-mounted pince-nez struck an angle on his pendulous nose
as to suggest that they were so placed in order not to obstruct
his line of vision. His hair was white and thin; he had two
dirty-grey tufts of side-whisker, and affected a Gladstonian
collar. His voice, when he spoke, was querulous and complaining;
he gave the impression that he felt a personal resentment toward
the unfortunate prisoner in the dock, for having dragged him
from his comfortable library to this ill-ventilated court.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was a man hovering about the age of sixty. His
wife, who was looking supremely lovely in her black velvet cloak
and her big black hat, which one white feather lightened, was
nearly thirty years his junior. A beautiful woman by some
standards. Junoesque, imperial, commanding; her lips in repose
were thin and straight, and if the truth be told, a little
repellent. Some people found them so. Hilary George, for one, a
daring rider to hounds, and wont to employ the phraseology of
the field, confessed that he never saw those lips tighten but a
voice within him uttered the warning, "'Ware! 'ware!"</p>

<p>She was a beautiful woman, and a disappointed woman. She had
married Sir Ralph Morte-Mannery, five years before, in the
supreme faith that she had emerged for ever from that atmosphere
of penury which had surrounded her girlhood; that she had said
"good-bye" to the strivings, the scrimpings and the make-believe
of shabby gentility with which a mother with social aspirations
and an income of a £150 a year had enclouded her.</p>

<p>But Vera Forsyth found she had moved from an atmosphere of
penury enforced by circumstances to an atmosphere of penury
practised for love of it. Sir Ralph was a mean man, he was
little short of a miser, and he had the settled conviction that,
in taking care of the pennies, he was appointed as by divine
right, the natural heir to hundreds.</p>

<p>It seemed to her, in her first year of marriage, that she
could never escape from the eternal account book. He was a man
who believed in domestic stock-taking. He knew, better than she,
the prevalent price of potatoes, and he noted with pain any
advance in the grocer's bill, and set himself the congenial task
of discovering the cause for any such swollen expenditure.</p>

<p>Now she looked along the Bench at her husband curiously; he
was always a source of interest to her. She needed some such
interest to sustain her in her everyday acquaintance with this
man.</p>

<p>He was summing up with gross partiality. Though he had had
one or two bad raps from the Court of Criminal Appeal, he was
not to be turned from his set purpose, which was to rid the
country of those who showed a disinclination to distinguish the
difference between meum and teum.</p>

<p>All who knew the circumstances realized that the summing up
was in the veriest bad taste. The young man, white of face, who
stood by the dock's edge, his shaking hands clasping and
unclasping the iron rail before him, was being tried for
burglary, and the burglary was at Sir Ralph's own place.</p>

<p>"He has told you, Gentlemen of the Jury," went on Sir Ralph
in his speech, "that a mysterious Italian asked him to break
into the house, where somebody would be waiting to give him an
equally mysterious packet. He did not intend to steal, so he
tells you; he was merely carrying out the instructions of this
mythical&mdash;perhaps I ought not to say 'mythical,'" said Sir
Ralph hastily, with the recollection of a Lord Chief Justice's
comments on a judgment of his&mdash;"but which may to you,
Gentlemen of the Jury, appear to be a mythical person.</p>

<p>"He tells you that he was induced by his poverty to go to
Highlawn at midnight, to effect an entrance through the kitchen,
and there to wait until some cloaked, masked individual brought
him a packet which he was to bring away. He tells you that he
had no intention whatever of robbing the owner. He was merely
being the accomplice of some person in the house."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph leant back with a little contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Gentlemen of the Jury," he said, throwing out his
hands, with pseudo good-nature, "if you believe that, of course
you still must convict the man on the charge of being an
accomplice. As you know, there is in this house a very valuable
collection of Renaissance jewellery; and when the Counsel for
the Crown tells you, as he has told you, that the inference to
be drawn from the man's presence in the kitchen, where the
butler discovered him, is that he intended to make a raid upon
that jewellery, you are, perhaps, as justified in believing that
suggestion as you are in believing that of the prisoner's
Counsel&mdash;that he was merely acting as an innocent agent in
the matter."</p>

<p>He said a few more words, summarized such of the evidence as
had not come under his previous purview, and commended the jury
to their deliberations with the air of benevolence which
invariably enwrapped the peroration of his more malignant
speeches.</p>

<p>The jury tramped out, and a buzz of conversation overhung the
court. The prisoner lingered a little by the rails; he looked
down at the delicate face of his girl-wife, this woman of
seventeen, who had sat throughout the trial tense and haggard,
listening to the evidence.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped, dear," he said. He was a man of the
working classes, but his voice showed an unusual culture.</p>

<p>The girl could only raise her piteous eyes to his; her lips
trembled, she could frame no answer. She knew that her young
husband spoke the truth. Poverty had ground them down to
desperation, but to whatever end it might drive them, it would
never make her man a thief.</p>

<p>The jury were back in five minutes. They shuffled into the
box, and answered to their names, keeping their eyes averted
from the prisoner at the Bar. The Clerk of Assizes put his
questions to them.</p>

<p>"Do you find the prisoner 'Guilty' or 'Not Guilty' of the
crime of burglary?"</p>

<p>"Guilty," said the foreman, in a high, nervous voice.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph nodded his head approvingly. He turned to the
prisoner as the Clerk said, "Have you anything to say before the
sentence is passed?"</p>

<p>The man in the dock took a swift glance at the drooping
figure of his wife. She had fainted, and a kindly policeman was
lifting her to carry her from the court.</p>

<p>"The story I have told," he said, speaking clearly and
without hesitation, "was a true story. I had no idea of burgling
your house, Sir Ralph. I merely went there because I thought I
was acting as the agent of somebody who was carrying on some
sort of&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated. "I hardly like to say
it&mdash;some sort of intrigue," he continued boldly, "and did
not want this fact to leak out."</p>

<p>His eyes roved round the Bench and halted when they met those
of Lady Morte-Mannery. They looked at each other; she calmly,
incuriously, he hopefully, with a wondering, puzzled stare.</p>

<p>"It is my first offence," he went on. "I have never been in
this position before, and although the jury have found me
'Guilty,' my lord, I do hope that you will take a lenient view
of my offence, not only for my own sake, but for the sake of my
wife and unborn child." His voice shook a little as he pleaded.
It was the only sign of emotion he had given.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph nodded again. It was a grim nod. It put a period to
the prisoner's speech. The Chairman adjusted his gold pince-nez,
and bent his head from left to right, consulting his
colleagues.</p>

<p>"Your offence, George Mansingham," he said, "is peculiarly
abhorrent to me. I do not consider the fact that the house
burgled was my own. Fortunately I am unaffected by personal
considerations, and the fact that I, myself, was away from home
that night enables me to try this case in an unprejudiced
spirit."</p>

<p>He looked down at the paper on his desk musingly. Then he
suddenly jerked his head up.</p>

<p>"You will be kept in penal servitude for seven years," he
said.</p>

<p>Something like a gasp ran through the court. Hilary George,
monocle in eye, half started to his feet, then sank back again.
The man in the dock stood dazed.</p>

<p>"Seven years," he repeated, and shook his head as though he
could not understand it, then turned and stepped down the stairs
which led to the cells below.</p>

<p>Hilary George was a stout man; he had a large fresh face, and
eyes that told plainly of his immense vitality and joy of life.
Seeing him you thought of an overgrown boy, and the monocle, as
a friend had remarked, seemed out of place in one so young. He
had one of the biggest practices at the Bar; he was a skilful
lawyer and a brilliant debater.</p>

<p>You might think him an easy man to manage, with his parted
lips that showed two rows of white even teeth and that look of
surprise and delight which shone in his eyes. But no man who had
ever tried to persuade Hilary George against his will or against
his better judgment, had ever repeated the attempt.</p>

<p>He stood now, an immaculate figure, on the steps of the
Session House. He was not smiling, he looked as grave as his
facial conformation would allow. Very slowly, very deliberately,
he buttoned the white gloves over his huge hands. He looked at
his watch, and, as he did so, the East Mannery party came out,
Lady Morte-Mannery a little ahead, Sir Ralph following with two
or three of his guests.</p>

<p>"Will you drive over in the car with us, or will you take the
wagonette," asked Sir Ralph, pleasantly. He was rather in awe of
the big barrister&mdash;as much in awe as he could be of
anybody&mdash;and he invariably cloaked his uneasiness with a
certain perkiness of manner which passed with Sir Ralph for
good-humour.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming over, Ralph," said Hilary George,
quietly.</p>

<p>The Chairman raised his brows.</p>

<p>"Not coming over?" he repeated. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to town," said Hilary, slowly as before.</p>

<p>"But why? What has happened? I thought you were keen on the
shooting."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say why," said Hilary. "If you'll be good
enough to tell my man to bring my boxes to the
station&mdash;I'll amuse myself in Burboro' for another
hour."</p>

<p>"But what is the reason?" persisted Sir Ralph. "Have you had
any news? Is there any necessity for your going back to
town?"</p>

<p>Hilary scratched his chin reflectively.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," he said, and faced the other squarely.
"You've just sentenced a man to seven years penal
servitude."</p>

<p>"Yes?" replied Sir Ralph, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"It was a perfectly beastly sentence," said the K.C., and
every word cut like a knife. "A perfectly beastly, malicious,
vindictive, unjust sentence," he repeated, "and I would not stay
another hour in the house of the man who passed it.</p>

<p>"More than this!" he said, with a sudden accession of
fierceness and benevolent malignity, if the paradox may be
allowed, which almost paralyzed his hearer, "I will not rest
until that sentence is reduced. My solicitors shall take it to
the Court of Appeal."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;how dare you!" spluttered Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"A perfectly beastly sentence," repeated the other, with
annoying deliberation. "Don't talk to me, Sir Ralph, I'm not a
tyro, I'm a barrister. I know the game better than you. I know
what sentence was justifiable there. I know exactly how your own
personal prejudice stepped in to confine this man&mdash;this
young man, a first offender&mdash;to a living hell."</p>

<p>He spoke with vehemence, his plump face growing redder and
redder as his anger rose.</p>

<p>"I will never forgive you, Hilary," cried Sir Ralph, shaking
with anger. "You have mortally offended me. You know I believe
in long sentences."</p>

<p>"I don't care a damn what you believe in,'' said the other,
and his very calmness emphasized the strength of his language.
"I bid you good morning."</p>

<p>He walked over to where Lady Morte-Mannery stood watching
them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Lady Morte-Mannery," he said, a little stiffly.
"I shall not be coming back to the house. An important
engagement has called me to London."</p>

<p>She murmured her sorrow conventionally, though she was by no
means displeased to see the back of a man whom at first she had
regarded as one who might easily be influenced to her views. Her
views, it may here be remarked, were peculiar.</p>

<p>"Why has he gone?" she asked her husband, as the car drove
through the main street of Burboro'.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph, who was glowering with rage, vouchsafed a snarling
answer.</p>

<p>"How do I know? Why do you ask ridiculous questions? Because
he's a fool," he went on viciously. "Because he's a blackguard.
He's grossly insulted me, and I'll never forgive him." He was in
a white heat of temper, and for the whole day brooded on the
affront which had been offered him.</p>

<p>Vera made one or two ineffectual attempts to smooth his
ruffled plumage. She was particularly anxious to get him into a
good mood. She had one or two requests to make, which in his
present frame of mind she knew would be rejected without
thought. Her efforts were unavailing.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't potter round," he growled, when she went
into the library on the pretext of tidying away some books which
had been left out by some careless guest.</p>

<p>"Oh, come here," he said, as she was going out of the room.
"Here's a bill from Burt's. How many packets of prepared oats
did we have in last week?"</p>

<p>"I forget, dear," she said.</p>

<p>"Six," he growled. "Do you know we have never had more than
four before?"</p>

<p>"Mr. George liked it for breakfast," she answered.</p>

<p>"Mr. George!" he almost shouted. "Don't mention that man's
name. Why is Bulgered charging 1s. 0½ d. a pound for his beef?
It's monstrous&mdash;change the butcher. I wish to goodness
you'd show some interest in the conduct of your house,
Vera."</p>

<p>He scowled at her under his white shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"You go on as if I was made of money. Practise some sense of
economy. My dear girl, before you were married you counted every
penny. Imagine they are your mother's, and count mine."</p>

<p>With a shrug, she left him. He was utterly impossible in
these moods. She went into the drawing-room wondering how she
should approach her lord on the subject which lay uppermost in
her mind. A girl sat in one of the windows, reading. She looked
up with a smile as Vera entered.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a bore?" she said. "They've just told me that Mr.
George has gone back to town. He played such beautiful piquet.
Why has he gone?"</p>

<p>She rose lazily, putting her book down. She was a tall,
beautiful girl, of that exquisite colouring which is the English
gentlewoman's heritage. The well-poised head was crowned with a
luxurious mass of russet gold hair. Her eyebrows, two delicate
lines of jet black, were set over a pair of the loveliest eyes
that man ever looked into. At least, so thought many a man who
knew her. Even Sir Ralph, self-engrossed and contemptuous, he
said, of beauty, had commented upon their liquid loveliness.</p>

<p>A straight nose, and a firm, rebellious chin, a perfectly
calm mouth, completed the picture. As she moved she displayed
the grace of her slender figure. Every movement suggested the
life of freedom&mdash;freedom of field and
road&mdash;eloquently, as did her complexion of the softening
qualities of her native Ireland.</p>

<p>"The horrible thing about being a poor relation," she said,
as she dropped her strong hand affectionately on the other's
shoulder, "is that one can't command the friends of one's rich
relations. I should have told Hilary George: 'You cannot go to
London, however pressing your business may be, because my niece
Marjorie, wants somebody to play piquet with her.'"</p>

<p>Vera shook the hand from her shoulder with a scarcely
perceptible movement.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Marjorie," she said a little tartly.
"Ralph's very worried. Hilary has been awfully rude to your
uncle."</p>

<p>The girl's eyebrows rose.</p>

<p>"Rude?" she repeated. "Why, I thought they were such good
friends."</p>

<p>"He has been very rude," she said again. "By the way," she
said, "your man is coming down to-day, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed. She drew herself up a little.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't say that sort of thing, Vera," she said.
"I do try to be nice to you, and you never lose an opportunity
of speaking unkindly."</p>

<p>Vera laughed, and strolled across to the piano. "I didn't
know that was unkind," she said, as she seated herself, and
pulled out some music from the rack at her side.</p>

<p>The girl followed her, her hands behind her back; she stood
behind her.</p>

<p>"Do you like me, Vera?" she asked.</p>

<p>Vera looked round, and stared at her.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she said, "don't be absurd. I don't dislike
you."</p>

<p>"But you do," persisted the other. "I have seen it so often.
I've had such convincing evidence, and it makes me a little
unhappy." She drew up a chair by the side of the piano and sat
down.</p>

<p>"Don't play," she said, "just let us have a heart-to-heart
talk."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of talk I loathe. I've just been having a
heart-to-heart talk about Quaker oats," said the other. "But
this young man&mdash;what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Gillingford&mdash;Frank Gillingford," said Marjorie,
steadily.</p>

<p>"You are rather keen on him, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am hoping that he is rather keen on me," said the girl,
her sense of humour getting the better of her resentment.</p>

<p>"What is he, an engineer or something?" asked Vera, touching
the keys lightly with her sensitive hands.</p>

<p>"Something of the sort." And Marjorie changed the
conversation. "Didn't uncle rather&mdash;rather"&mdash;she
hesitated for a simile&mdash;"as Mr. George would say, 'whack it
into' that unfortunate person?"</p>

<p>"You mean the burglar?"</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't think he got any more than he deserved," said
Vera.</p>

<p>"Do you really think he came after uncle's collection?</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Vera, without looking round. "It is a very
valuable one. There are medallions there worth three or four
hundred pounds each&mdash;there is one there worth a thousand,
at least," she added quickly. "I believe that is so."</p>

<p>"But what use would they be to him?" persisted the girl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" Vera shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are asking me to give a psychological survey of a
burglar's mind," she said, "and that I am not prepared to
do."</p>

<p>Marjorie walked back to the window and looked out on to the
dismal landscape. It had been raining for the last hour, and the
trees looked especially miserable, half enveloped as they were
by a mist which was driving up from the Medway valley.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't advise you to discuss the question of that
sentence with your uncle," said Vera across her shoulder. "He is
rather sore; I think that was the cause of his quarrel with
Hilary George."</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. She could not understand Vera. She
had always been an enigma to her. That she was a disappointed
woman, Marjorie knew. She had expected to inherit a life of
luxurious calm; instead, she had merely succeeded the house-keeper,
whom Sir Ralph had thoughtfully discharged, and had,
moreover, dated his discharge as from the date of his
wedding.</p>

<p>Vera was an ambitious woman. She had set no limit upon her
possibilities. She had come, as she had thought, into a wider
world, to a larger life, with scope for the exercise of her
undoubted genius, but had found herself restricted to the
prosaic duties of housekeeping for a querulous and a mean old
man.</p>

<p>Marjorie's reverie was cut short by the sudden cessation of
the music. There was a little pause, and then Vera's voice
asked&mdash;"Where could I raise five hundred pounds?"</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE CALL OF
TILLIZINI</h2>

<p class="first">MARJORIE turned with a start.</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds?" she repeated.</p>

<p>Vera nodded.</p>

<p>"I want that sum," she said, "for a purpose. You understand
that this is confidential?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," said Marjorie, "but it is a lot of money.
Couldn't you get it from Uncle Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Ralph," repeated the other, contemptuously. "He
wouldn't give five hundred potatoes! A demand for five hundred
pounds would estrange us for the rest of our lives."</p>

<p>She gave a bitter little laugh.</p>

<p>Marjorie knit her pretty brows in thought.</p>

<p>"I can't think of anybody," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Then don't," said Vera, briskly. "I don't know exactly why I
asked you."</p>

<p>Further discussion of the subject was made impossible by the
arrival of Sir Ralph himself.</p>

<p>He had evidently forgotten that any strained relations
existed between himself and his wife, or that her iniquitous
extravagance in prepared oats had ever come between them.</p>

<p>"Vera," he said, going towards her, "did you notice a man in
the court to-day, a peculiarly foreign-looking man?"</p>

<p>She thought a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a person sitting near&mdash;" she nearly said
Hilary George, but deemed it tactful to mention another
barrister who had been engaged in the case.</p>

<p>"How did he impress you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I should like to say that he did not impress me at all," she
said, with a smile. She was most anxious to restore him to good
humour. "But unfortunately, I did take particular notice of him;
rather a distinguished-looking man, clean-shaven and with a
lined, thoughtful face."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the man," he said. "I've just had a note from him. I
didn't know he was in Burboro'. That is Tillizini."</p>

<p>He said this impressively. At the moment, Tillizini's name
was in the mouth of half the population of England.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"None other," he said. "I had a note from one of the under
secretaries of the Home Office saying that he was coming down. I
don't know why our little burglary should have attracted his
attention, but at any rate he could not have been very
interested, for he did not turn up until to-day. He has just
sent a note to tell me that he is staying at the George, and I
have written to ask him to come up to dinner to-night."</p>

<p>She made a little face.</p>

<p>"He's a detective or something, isn't he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"More than a detective."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was rather inclined to be irritable if you did not
rise to his values. It was better to over-estimate them than to
under-estimate them in any case.</p>

<p>"Surely you have read the papers?" he went on, with his best
magisterial air. "You couldn't very well escape his name
nowadays. He is the man whom the English Government brought over
as a sort of consultant, to deal with this terrible outbreak of
crime."</p>

<p>"I've heard something about it," said his wife, carelessly.
"The 'Black Hand' or the 'Red Hand'&mdash;I forget exactly what
colour it is."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph frowned.</p>

<p>"You must not treat these matters frivolously, Vera," he
said, coldly. "I've had reason to speak to you before on similar
occasions. The 'Red Hand' is a very mysterious organization,
which is striking at the very heart of our domestic security.
Any man, and I may add any woman, should be extremely grateful
to those who, by their gifts of divination, are endeavouring to
shield the innocent victims of a band of organized
criminals."</p>

<p>Vera hated her husband when he made speeches to her. She knew
more about the "Red Hand" and its workings than she was prepared
to discuss with Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>It was a pose of hers, as it was a pose of certain members of
her class, to profess a profound ignorance upon matters which
were engaging the attention of newspaper readers. The pose of
ignorance is a popular one with members of the leisured classes;
popular, because it suggests their superiority to the influences
which surround them; because it signalizes their independence of
chronicled facts, and because, too, it is the easiest of all
poses to assume and to sustain.</p>

<p>Vera had caught the trick and found it a profitable one. It
lent her an overpowering naivete, which had a paralysing effect
upon the better-informed but socially inferior members of the
community, and it precluded one being bored by a long recital of
the news which one had read in the morning papers in a more
concise or a more accurate form. Her interest in the great
Italian detective for the moment was a conventionally domestic
one, for she rose from the music-stool.</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell Parker to set another place," she
said.</p>

<p>"If he accepts," interjected Marjorie.</p>

<p>Vera raised her eyebrows with a little smile.</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Marjorie, of course he will accept."</p>

<p>"What do we call him&mdash;Inspector or Sergeant or
something?" she asked of Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>The spirit of revolt was stirring within her, and she
permitted herself a facetiousness of attitude which ordinarily
she would not have expressed. And this, despite the subconscious
desire to soothe him into a complaisant mood.</p>

<p>She never for one moment imagined that he would advance her
the money she required, but he might let her have a portion of
it if she could only invent a story sufficiently plausible. The
truth was out of the question. She smiled to herself at the
thought. She was an imaginative woman but not sufficiently so to
picture Sir Ralph in that moment of confession. She needed the
money as she had never needed money before. It was not for
herself&mdash;her own wants were few and her tastes simple. She
might, perhaps, induce her husband to let her have a hundred if
she could invent a good reason&mdash;and it would have to be a
superlatively good reason to induce Sir Ralph to part with his
money.</p>

<p>Somehow the old weariness of it all, the old distaste for the
life she was living, came over her, and induced her to treat the
subject in a manner in which she knew her husband would heartily
disapprove.</p>

<p>"You will call him Doctor Tillizini,' said Sir Ralph sternly.
"He is a professor of anthropology in the Florentine School of
Medicine. He is a gentleman, Vera, and I shall expect you to
treat him as such."</p>

<p>Marjorie, who had been an interested spectator of the passage
between husband and wife, had discreetly withdrawn to her book
and her chair by the window. As Sir Ralph turned to go, she
rose.</p>

<p>"I say, what fun," she said. "Is he really coming,
Uncle?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph nodded.</p>

<p>"I hope so. I can do no more than invite him, but he is such
a busy man that he may probably have to go back to town. At any
rate, I am certain," he said, a little pompously, "that he will
approve most heartily of my treatment of that rascal to-day. I
think it is monstrous the way Hilary George went on..."</p>

<p>He was still sore over his treatment by his whilom friend,
and he launched forth into a sea of explanation and
justification, and, incidentally, gave the girl a fairly garbled
version of the scene which had occurred outside the Session
House&mdash;a scene in which he had played, by his account, a
dignified and proper part, and in which Hilary had lost his
temper to a distressing degree.</p>

<p>The fire of Sir Ralph's eloquence burnt itself down to
glowerings and splutterings of incoherent disapproval.</p>

<p>"Hilary George," he said, "will regret this." He spoke in the
satisfied tone of one who had made special arrangements with
Providence to that end.</p>

<p>Marjorie was following her uncle from the room, when a glance
from Vera brought her back. The older woman waited until the
door had closed behind her husband.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," she said, in the mild and honeyed tone which the
girl recognized as her "At Home" voice, "I want you to do
something for me."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, dear," said the girl warmly.</p>

<p>Lady Morte-Mannery fingered the little silver ornaments on
one of the tables which abounded in the drawing-room, and placed
them as though they were pawns in a new game she was playing.
She seemed to be concentrating her attention upon this pastime
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I want you to do something very special for me," she
repeated. "Of course, I know I can trust you about that money,
and now I want to ask you to help me with a little ruse. This
man who is coming to-day," she said, "this Italian person, is
really not the kind of man I want to meet. I hate detectives and
all those crude, melodramatic individuals. They talk about crime
and things, and besides," she hesitated, "I can trust you, can't
I?"</p>

<p>She looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl gravely, wondering what was coming.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, dear," said Vera slowly, and still playing
her mysterious game with the comfit boxes and Dutch silver, "I'm
a member of a club. It's a ladies' club; you won't find it in
Whittaker because we do not care to advertise our existence,
although of course we are registered. Well, we had rather a
bother there, two or three months ago. We&mdash;we. Why should I
deceive you?" she said in a burst of confidence, and with her
rare smile. "We were raided! You see, dear, we played rather
heavily. We did not confine ourselves to the prosaic game of
Bridge. Some woman&mdash;I forget her name&mdash;introduced
baccarat, and we had a little wheel too; you know."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"It was awfully fascinating, and one lost and won quite a
considerable sum. And then there was a bother, and the police
came in one night quite unexpectedly. Your dear Uncle Ralph was
in town for the May Meetings, and I had quite a lot of time on
my hands.</p>

<p>"It was very fortunate I escaped any serious consequences of
my rashness. I gave a false name, and was brought up the next
morning at Bow Street with the rest of the women&mdash;you
remember, the case created quite a sensation&mdash;and I was
bound over in a false name. Nobody recognized me and nobody but
you is any the wiser."</p>

<p>She stopped again, and shot a swift, side-long glance at the
girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be shocked," she said, the acid in her tone
asserting itself. "It wasn't so very dreadful, only this
Tillizini man was in court that day, and I think he may have
recognized me."</p>

<p>"How awkward!" said Marjorie. "Really, Vera, I'm not a bit
shocked, and it's not for me, any way, to sit in judgment on
your actions. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to help me when I tell Sir Ralph that I am too
ill to entertain this person. I'll go straight away to bed, and
I want you, like an angel, to do the honours."</p>

<p>"Why, with pleasure," said Marjorie, with a little smile.</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Vera, a little hardly, "Ralph won't bully you
before visitors, nor will he refer pointedly to your needless
extravagance in potatoes. Ralph is rather a fanatic on the
question of potatoes," she said. "There is a standard by which
he judges all phases of domestic economy."</p>

<p>Marjorie was filled with an infinite pity for the girl. She
was not more than seven or eight years older than herself, still
young enough to find joy in the colour and movement of life.</p>

<p>"I will do anything I can," she said. For the second time
that day she laid her hand upon the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't paw me, dear," said Vera, with sudden asperity, and
the warm, generous heart of the girl was chilled. Vera saw this,
and tried to make amends.</p>

<p>"Please don't bother about me, dear," she said, in a softer
tone. "I am rather jagged; too jagged, indeed, to meet
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that point the door of the drawing-room was opened, and
William, the butler, came in importantly. He stood by the open
door.</p>

<p>"Professor Tillizini," he announced.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; A HUNTER OF MEN</h2>

<p class="first">IT seemed to Marjorie that Vera shrank back at
the name.</p>

<p>The girl waited for her to go forward and greet the newcomer,
but as she made no move Marjorie realized that she was called
upon, even now, to perform the duties of hostess.</p>

<p>The man in the doorway was tall; he looked taller, perhaps,
because of his slimness. He was clad from head to foot in black,
and the big flowing tie at his neck was of the same sober hue.
He carried in his hand a black soft felt hat, from which the
butler had made several ineffectual attempts to detach him.</p>

<p>His face was long and thin, sallow and lined; his eyes were
big and grey, and steady. They were terribly alive and
expressive, Marjorie thought. They gave the impression that the
whole process of life was comprehended in their depths. His hair
was black and was brushed smoothly behind his ears. He was
neither handsome nor ugly. His face was an unusual one,
attractive, because of its very character and strength. The
mouth was big and sensitive; the ungloved hands were long and
white, and as delicate as a surgeon's.</p>

<p>He gave a quick glance from one to the other.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry to intrude upon you," he said. There was no
trace of any foreign accent in his voice. "I expected to find
Sir Ralph. He is out&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>He had a quick, alert method of talking. He was eager to the
point of anticipating the reply. Before the girl could answer he
had gone on.</p>

<p>"He has kindly asked me to dine to-night. I am so sorry I
cannot. I must be back in London in an hour or two. There are
one or two interviews of importance which I have arranged."</p>

<p>His smile was a dazzling one; it lit up the whole of his
face, and changed him from a somewhat morose, funereal figure,
to a new and radiant being.</p>

<p>Marjorie noticed that he was almost handsome in his
amusement. The smile came and went like a gleam of sunshine seen
through a rift of storm-cloud.</p>

<p>"You are Miss Marjorie Meagh," he said, "and you, madam,"
with a little bow, "are Lady Morte-Mannery." His head twisted
for a moment inquiringly. That, and the bow, were the only
little signs he gave of his continental origin.</p>

<p>Vera forced a smile to her face. She came forward, a little
embarrassed. She had hoped to escape without an introduction and
to have developed a convenient headache to keep out of his
way.</p>

<p>"I saw you in court," said Tillizini, quickly. "It was an
interesting case, was it not? That poor man!"</p>

<p>He threw out his arms with a gesture of pity.</p>

<p>"I do not know why you sympathize with him," said Vera.</p>

<p>"Seven years!" Tillizini shook his head. "It is a long time,
Madam, for a man&mdash;innocent."</p>

<p>Again the little shrug. The tall man paced the room
nervously.</p>

<p>"You have heard his story. He said that he came to this house
to meet an individual who would give him a packet."</p>

<p>"But surely you do not believe that?" said the other, with
amused contempt.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe that," said Tillizini, calmly and gravely.
"Why should I not? The man's every attitude, every word, spoke
eloquently to me, of his sincerity."</p>

<p>"Do you believe, then, in this mysterious Italian?" said
Vera.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vera, don't you remember?" Marjorie broke in suddenly,
and with some excitement, "there was an Italian in the town. We
saw him the day before the robbery. Don't you remember?" she
asked again. "A very short man, with a long Inverness cape which
reached to his heels. We passed him in the car on the Breckley
road, and I remarked to you that he was either an Italian or a
Spaniard because of the peculiar way he was holding his
cigarette."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!"</p>

<p>It was Tillizini, tremendously vital, all a-quiver like some
delicately strung zither whose strings had been set vibrating by
a musician's hand.</p>

<p>"He was short and stout, and was dressed in black," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"A moustache&mdash;no?" said Tillizini.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"He was clean-shaven."</p>

<p>"You were going the same direction&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>Again the girl nodded, with a smile at the man's eager
question.</p>

<p>"And did he turn his face towards you or from you? From
you?"</p>

<p>Again the girl nodded.</p>

<p>"He did not want you to see his face?" Tillizini himself
shook his head in answer.</p>

<p>"What rubbish, Marjorie!" broke in Vera, petulantly. "I don't
remember anything of the sort. There are always organ-grinders
with monkeys and things of that sort coming through the village,
or ice-cream people who come down from Chatham. You are letting
your imagination run away with you." Marjorie was amazed. She
remembered now the incident most distinctly. She had spoken of
it to Vera in the evening, at dinner. It was amazing that she
herself had forgotten it until this moment.</p>

<p>"But you must remember," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't remember," answered the other shortly. "Besides, you
are very wrong to give Mr. Tillizini a false clue. There can be
no doubt that this man, Mansingham, burgled the house for no
other reason than to steal Sir Ralph's collection."</p>

<p>"Instigated by the Italian," said Tillizini. "Oh, you English
people," he said, with a despairing shrug, "I am desolated when
I speak with you. You have such a fear of melodrama. You are so
insistent upon the fact that the obvious must be the only
possible explanation!"</p>

<p>He shook his head again in humorous resignation. From any
other man the outburst might have sounded as a piece of
unpardonable impertinence. But Tillizini had the extraordinary
gift of creating an atmosphere of old-established friendship.
Even Vera, frankly antagonistic, had a vague sense of having
discussed this matter before in identical terms with the man who
spoke so disparagingly of her compatriots.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I must see Sir Ralph before I go back. Where shall I find
him?"</p>

<p>Vera had a shrewd idea that at that moment Sir Ralph was
engaged in a heated interview with the offending butcher who had
put a halfpenny upon the price of beef, but she did not think it
fair to her husband, or consonant with her own dignity, to admit
as much.</p>

<p>"He'll return very soon," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply, for no reason as far as she could
see. There had been nothing in her tone to justify the look of
quick interest which came to his face.</p>

<p>"I have met you before somewhere, Lady Morte-Mannery," he
said quickly, "and it is very unusual for me that I cannot for
the moment recall the circumstance."</p>

<p>"Really?" said Vera, in a tone which suggested that she had
no interest in the matter, "one does have these queer
impressions&mdash;you'll excuse me now, won't you, doctor," she
said, "I have got rather a bad headache and I thought of lying
down. Miss Meagh will entertain you till Sir Ralph returns."</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the door and opened it for her, and
favoured her with a little bow as she passed. Then he closed the
door and walked slowly back to Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Where, where, where?" he said, tapping his chin and looking
solemnly at the girl.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"You must not confuse me with the Oracle," she said. "You
know, doctor, we ask such questions of you."</p>

<p>Again that beautiful smile of his illuminated the sombre
countenance.</p>

<p>"I was asking this Oracle," he said, tapping his breast. "And
now I remember. There was a raid on a gambling house. It was run
by one of my compatriots, and I was in court."</p>

<p>"I hope you will forget that, Doctor Tillizini," said
Marjorie, quietly. "Lady Morte-Mannery may have been very
foolish to have been found in such a place, but it would not be
kind to remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped when she saw the look of astonishment on the
other's face.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he said, with his winning smile, "you do not
suggest that Lady Morte-Mannery was in any way implicated? It
would be wicked, it would be absurd, it would be villainous," he
said extravagantly, "to associate such a lady with so sordid a
business."</p>

<p>"This was a very commonplace raid," he went on, "they were
mostly Italians engaged, and mostly people of very low origin,
and my interest in the case was merely the hope of identifying
some of the participants as gentlemen who had another interest
for me. Lady Mannery was in court, certainly, but she was in
court as the guest of the magistrate, Mr. Curtain, the
Metropolitan Police Magistrate, who, I think, is some relation
of Sir Ralph." This was so, as Marjorie knew. Then why had Vera
lied to her? She understood how easy it was for her to make up
the story; but why give that as an excuse for not wanting to
meet Tillizini?</p>

<p>"There is Sir Ralph," she said suddenly. She had seen the car
go past the window. "Do you mind staying here alone, while I go
and tell him you are here?"</p>

<p>He opened the door for her, with his quaint little bow. She
met Sir Ralph in the hall, and explained the fact that the
visitor was waiting.</p>

<p>"Where is Vera?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She has gone to lie down," said Marjorie, "she has a very
bad headache."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph swore under his breath.</p>

<p>It was her main weapon of defence&mdash;that headache. A
convenient, but, to his mind, grossly unfair method of evading
her responsibilities. He was more incensed now because he felt
that not only had she failed to do the honours of his house
towards a man for whose position he had an immense respect, but
she had escaped from the just consequence of her carelessness.
He had discovered that it was entirely due to her that the extra
halfpenny had been put upon beef. She had acquiesced to the
imposition in a letter which the butcher had triumphantly
produced to vindicate his character.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, at the disadvantage which every man must
be, half of whose mind is occupied by a private grievance, when
he met Tillizini.</p>

<p>The two men went off to the library for about a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>At the end of that time they returned to the drawing-room&mdash;
Tillizini to take his leave of the girl&mdash;and Sir Ralph to
see him to his waiting fly.</p>

<p>Marjorie saw that the Chairman of the Burboro' Sessions was
considerably ruffled. His face was red, his thin grey hair
untidy&mdash;ever a sign of perturbation. He was, too, a little
stiff with his guest.</p>

<p>As for Tillizini, he was the same imperturbable, cool,
masterful man. Yes, that was the word which Marjorie sought.
This man was masterful to an extent which she could not
divine.</p>

<p>"Some day I shall meet you again," said Tillizini, as he took
the girl's hand in his own. She was surprised at the strength of
his grip. "I would not go so soon, but Sir Ralph has kindly
given me permission to see this man, Mansingham, who was
convicted to-day."</p>

<p>"I think your labours are entirely misdirected, Professor,"
said Sir Ralph, gruffly. "You will learn nothing from him but a
pack of lies."</p>

<p>"Ah, but lies!" said Tillizini, with an ecstatic gesture.
"They are so interesting, Sir Ralph, so much more interesting
than the commonplace truth, and so much more informative."</p>

<p>The elder man, who prided himself in post-prandial speeches
upon being a plain, blunt Englishman, and inferentially typical
of all that was best in an Englishman, had no mind for
paradoxes. He grunted unsympathetically.</p>

<p>"You are an Italian," he said. "I suppose these things amuse
you. But here in England we believe in the obvious. It saves a
lot of trouble and it is generally accurate. You know," he said
testily, "these stories of mysterious organizations are all very
well for novels. I admit that in your country you have the
Camorra, and the possession of that factor probably unbalances
your judgment; but I assure you "&mdash;he laid his hands with
heavy and paternal solicitude upon the younger man's
shoulder&mdash;"nothing of that sort."</p>

<p>They were standing by the window; the dusk was beginning to
fall, and the gas had not yet been lit. He got so far, when of a
sudden a pane of glass, on a level with Tillizini's head,
splintered with a crash. It seemed to splinter three times in
rapid succession, and simultaneously from without came a thick
staccato <i>"Crack! crack! crack!"</i></p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE "RED HAND" DRAW
BLANK</h2>

<p class="first">SIR RALPH felt the whiz of bullets as they
passed him, heard the smash of the picture they struck on the
opposite wall, and jumped back, white and shaking. Tillizini
reached out his hand and thrust the girl back to cover with one
motion.</p>

<p>In an instant he was down on his knees, crawling quickly to
the window. He reached up his hands, threw up the sash, and
leant out suddenly. For a second he stood thus, and then a jet
of flame leapt from his hand, and they were deafened with the
report of his Browning. Again he fired, and waited. Then he
turned, and came back to them, a beatific smile illuminating his
face.</p>

<p>"You were saying," he said calmly, "that these things do not
happen in England?"</p>

<p>His voice was even and unshaken. The hand that raised a
spotless white handkerchief to wipe a streak of blood from his
forehead, did not tremble.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Sir Ralph, in agitation. "It must have
been a poacher or something. Those beggars hate me!"</p>

<p>"Poachers do not use Mauser pistols," said Tillizini quietly.
"If you take the trouble to dig out the bullets from your wall,
which I am afraid is somewhat damaged, you will discover that
they bear no resemblance whatever to the pellets which, I
understand, filled the cartridges of your friends. No," he
smiled, "those shots were not intended for you, Sir Ralph. They
were very much intended for me."</p>

<p>He looked wistfully out of the window.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I didn't hit him," he said. "I saw him fairly
distinctly as he made his way through the trees."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Sir Ralph anxiously.</p>

<p>Tillizini looked at him with an expression of slyness.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" he answered, deliberately. "I think it was the
Italian who sent William Mansingham to your house to receive a
packet."</p>

<p>"But from whom?" asked Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"That we shall know some day," replied the other,
evasively.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Sir Ralph went down to the railway station to
meet Tillizini and to see him off. He was consumed with
curiosity as to the result of the interview which he had granted
the detective.</p>

<p>Whether he had the right of instructing the warders of the
local gaol to admit Tillizini was a moot point; but since the
Italian had such extraordinarily wide powers deputed to him by
the Home Office, it was probable that the interview would have
taken place even without Sir Ralph's permission.</p>

<p>The Chairman had hinted that it would be graceful, if not
decent, for Tillizini to see the prisoner in his presence, but
the Italian had artistically overlooked the suggestion.</p>

<p>It was five minutes before the train left that Tillizini
sprang out of the fly which brought him to the station entrance.
He was smoking a long, thin cigar, and was, as Sir Ralph judged,
tremendously pleased with himself, for between his clenched
teeth he hummed a little tune as he strode through the
booking-hall on to the platform.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the Chairman, curiously, "what had our friend
to say for himself?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that you do not know," replied the other, brightly.
"He merely repeated the story that he told in the dock about my
mysterious fellow-countryman. He gave me one or two details,
which were more interesting to me than they would be to
you."</p>

<p>"Such as?" suggested Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well," Tillizini hesitated. "He told me that his instructor
had informed him that the packet would be small enough to put in
his waistcoat pocket."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p>"There are a dozen objects in my collection which might be
carried in a man's waistcoat pocket. No!" he corrected himself,
"there are at least fifty. By the way," he said suddenly,
"you've never asked to see my collection."</p>

<p>Tillizini shook his head vigorously, amusement in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"That would be unnecessary," he said. "I know every article
you have, Sir Ralph, its size, its origin, almost the price you
paid for it."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph turned to him in surprise.</p>

<p>"But how?" he asked wonderingly. "I have only my private
catalogue, and no copy exists outside my house."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Tillizini. "Let me enumerate them."</p>

<p>He told them off on his hands, finger by finger.</p>

<p>"Number 1, an Egyptian locket from the Calliciti
collection&mdash;gold, studded with uncut rubies&mdash;value,
£420. Number 2, a plaque of Tanagra ware, rather an unusual
specimen in a frame of soft gold, inscribed with Syrian mottoes.
Number 3, a crystal medallion, taken by Napoleon from Naples, on
the inverse side a bust of Beatrice D'Este, on the reverse side
Il Moro, the Duke of Milan, value&mdash;by the way, I didn't
give you the previous value because I don't know it&mdash;£600.
Number 4, a Venetian charm in the shape of a harp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," gasped Sir Ralph, "these facts, regarding my
collection are only known to me.</p>

<p>"They are also known to me," said the other.</p>

<p>The train had come in as they were speaking. Tillizini walked
towards an empty carriage, and entered it. He closed the door
behind him, and leant out of the window.</p>

<p>"There are many things to be learnt, and this is not the
least of them," he said. "Between the man with the secret, and
the man who knows that secret, there are intermediaries who have
surprised the first and informed the second."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was puzzling this out when the train drew out of
the station, and its tail lights vanished through the tunnel
which penetrates Burboro' Hill.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Tillizini locked both doors and pulled down
all the blinds of his carriage. He had no doubt as to the
sinister intentions of the man or men who had dogged his
footsteps so persistently since he had left London. If he was to
be killed, he decided that it should not be by a shot fired by a
man from the footboard.</p>

<p>It was a fast train from Burboro' to London, and the first
stop would be at London Bridge. He took the central seat of the
carriage, put his feet up upon the opposite cushions, laid his
Browning pistol on the seat beside him, and composed himself to
read. He had half a dozen London papers in the satchel which was
his inseparable companion.</p>

<p>One of these he had systematically exhausted on the journey
down; he now turned his attention to another. His scrutiny was
concentrated upon the advertisement columns. He did not bother
with the agonies, because he knew that no up-to-date criminal
would employ such method of communication.</p>

<p>One by one he examined the prosaic announcements under the
heading "Domestic Servants Wanted." He reached the end without
discovering anything exciting. He laid the paper down and took
up another.</p>

<p>Half-way down the "Domestic Wants" column his eye was
arrested by a notice. To the ordinary reader it was the
commonplace requirement of an average housewife. It
ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"Cook-General; Italian cooking preferred.
Four in family. Fridays; not Thursdays as previously announced.
State amount willing to give."</p>

<br>

<p>The address was an advertising agency in the City. He read it
again; took a little penknife from his waistcoat pocket, and
carefully cut it from the paper.</p>

<p>There were many peculiarities about that announcement. There
was a certain egotism in the "Fridays, not Thursdays as
previously announced," which was unusual in this type of
advertisement. Who cared whether it was Thursday or Friday that
had been previously given, presumably, as the evening "out"?</p>

<p>But the glaring error in the advertisement lay in the last
paragraph. The average advertiser would be more anxious to know
what wages the newcomer would require, and would most certainly
never suggest that the "Cook-General" whose services were
sought, should contribute, in addition to her labour, anything
in the nature of payment for the privilege."</p>

<p>Tillizini looked up at the roof of the carriage in thought.
To-day was Monday. Something had been arranged for Thursday. It
had been postponed till the following day. For that something a
price was to be paid, possibly an advance on the original price
agreed upon was demanded. The advertiser would hardly undertake
to perform the service without some previous agreement as to
price.</p>

<p>He did not in any way associate the announcement with the
recent events at Highlawn; they were but part of the big game
which was being played. The emissaries of that terrible society
whose machinations he had set himself to frustrate were no doubt
travelling by the same train. He was so used to this espionage
that he ignored it, without despising it. He was ever prepared
for the move, inevitable as it seemed to him, which would be
made against his life and against his security.</p>

<p>It was too much to expect that the "Red Hand" would forgive
him the work he had accomplished in America. He had cleared the
United States from the greatest scourge of modern times.</p>

<p>It was no fault of his that they had taken advantage of the
lax immigration laws of England to settle in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>He replaced the papers in his satchel, and just before the
train ran into London Bridge he let up the spring blinds of the
compartment. It was dark, and wet, and miserable. He made no
attempt to alight at the station. It was not a safe place, as he
knew by experience, for a threatened man to end his journey.</p>

<p>There were dark tunnels which led to the main entrance of the
station&mdash;tunnels in which a man might be done to death, if
by chance he were the only passenger negotiating the exit; and
no one would be any the wiser for five minutes or so, sufficient
time, that, to allow these professional murderers to escape.</p>

<p>Outside Waterloo he pulled the blinds down again. He did
these things automatically, without any fear. He took the same
precaution as the everyday citizen takes in crossing the road.
He looked from left to right before crossing this dangerous
highway of his.</p>

<p>Flush with the railway bridge which crosses the river to
Charing Cross station is a footpath, Old Hungerford
footbridge.</p>

<p>Three men were waiting there at intervals that wet and
blusterous night to watch the Burboro' train come in. They saw
it from a position which enabled them, had the opportunity
presented, of shooting into the carriage.</p>

<p>Tillizini did not know this, but he could guess it. It was
not an unlikely contingency.</p>

<p>On the crowded station of Charing Cross he was safe enough.
Moreover, there were two men, who had spent the afternoon
unostentatiously wandering about the station, who picked him up
as he came through the barrier.</p>

<p>He gave one of them a little nod, which none but the keenest
observer would have noticed.</p>

<p>The two Scotland Yard men, whose duty it was to shadow him in
London, walked closely behind him, and remained upon the
pavement outside until he had entered the waiting electric
brougham.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE STORY OF THE "RED
HAND"</h2>

<p class="first">PROFESSOR ANTONIO TILLIZINI is a name around
which has centred the fiercest controversy. No scientist is ever
likely to forget his extraordinary paper read before the Royal
Society at Sheffield. It was entitled prosaically, "Some
Reflections upon the Inadequacy of the Criminal Code," and was
chiefly remarkable from the layman's point of view in that the
professor in the course of his address calmly admitted that he
had found it necessary to kill ten criminals at various stages
of his career. He was sufficiently discreet to offer no further
information on the subject, and, though his enemies endeavoured,
on the clue he had offered them, to bring at least one crime
home to the Italian, they were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>More significant of the trend of public opinion, Tillizini
was not deprived of his chair of Anthropology at the Florence
University, nor did London society bar its doors to the
foreigner who was a self-confessed slayer of men.</p>

<p>More than this, it is known that in preparing their Criminal
Law Amendment Bill of 19&mdash;, the Government sought the
advice of this extraordinary man.</p>

<p>But it was in connexion with the remarkable outburst of crime
of a peculiar character that the young man who spent six months
of the year in England and six months in his beloved Italy, and
of whom the epigram had been perpetrated, that he thought in
English and acted in Italian, that he first came largely into
the public eye.</p>

<p>It was said of him that all the secrets of the Borgias were
known to him; there were dark hints amongst the superstitious of
necromancy, and this reputation, generally held among the
Italian colony in London, served him in good stead when the days
came for him to tackle the "Red Hand."</p>

<p>The organization known as the "Red Hand" had been driven from
America by the heroism and resourcefulness of Teum, the famous
Cincinnati detective. Laws, drastic to the point of brutality,
had been instituted; the system of inquiry known as the "Third
Degree" had been elaborated so that it only stopped short of the
more extreme methods of the Spanish Inquisition, to cope with
the increase in blackmail and murder in which the "Red Hand"
specialized.</p>

<p>There was a lull in this type of crime after the
electrocution of the Seven Men of Pittsburg, but the silence of
the "Red Hand" was broken at last.</p>

<p>It was in December, 19&mdash;, that Carlo Gattini, a wealthy
Italian living in Cromwell Square Gardens, received a curt
typewritten request that he should place a thousand pounds in
banknotes under a certain seat in Hyde Park. The hour and the
date were mentioned, and the letter was signed by a small red
hand, evidently impressed by a rubber stamp.</p>

<p>Mr. Gattini smiled and handed the letter to the police.</p>

<p>At their suggestion he replied through the agony columns of
The Times, agreeing to the request; a package was made up and
placed beneath the seat described, and four Scotland Yard men
waited through the whole of one dismal evening for the "Red
Hand" messenger. He did not come. He either suspected or knew;
so there the matter should have ended by the severe and
unromantic police code.</p>

<p>But on the following morning another letter came to the
Italian. It was brief:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We give you another chance. Go to the police again and you
are a dead man. Place £2,000 in notes in an envelope and leave
it under the first bush in your garden."</p>

<p>In alarm, Gattini went to the police. They pooh-poohed any
suggestion of danger. Plain-clothes men were concealed in the
house and in the garden; other secret service men were stationed
in the house opposite, but again the messenger did not come, nor
did the Italian receive any further communication.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve Mr. Gattini returned from the City after a
busy day. He was a widower, and lived alone, save for four
servants&mdash;an elderly woman who acted as cook, a housemaid,
and two menservants.</p>

<p>At 7.30 his valet went to his room to announce dinner.
Gattini's door was locked.</p>

<p>The man knocked, but received no answer. He knocked again,
without result.</p>

<p>He returned to the servants' hall and announced his failure,
and he and the chauffeur went to the front of the house and
looked up at the window of Mr. Gattini's room.</p>

<p>It was in darkness.</p>

<p>It happened providentially that a Scotland Yard man had
called in at that moment in connexion with the threatening
letters, and the servants confided their apprehensions.</p>

<p>The three men went to the door of Gattini's room and knocked
loudly. There was no reply, and, putting their shoulders to the
door, they burst it open.</p>

<p>One of them switched on a light.</p>

<p>At first they saw nothing; the room was apparently empty...
then they saw.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man had been struck down as he sat at his
dressing-table. The knife that had cut short his life was
missing, but it was evident that he had died without a cry.</p>

<p>This was the first murder&mdash;there were others to
follow.</p>

<p>The request for money came to Sir Christoforo Angeli, a rich
banker, and a naturalized Britisher. He treated the threat as
lightly as Gattini had done... he was shot dead as he stood at
his window one Spring afternoon, and no man but he saw the
murderer.</p>

<p>Again there came a lull, but it was evident to the police,
ransacking Europe for a clue, that the apparent inactivity was
less significant of a cessation on the part of the gang, as it
was of their successes. Men in terror of their lives were paying
and keeping information away from the police. A reign of terror
was in progress, when, exhausting the wealthier members of the
Italian colony, the gang turned its attention to other sources
of income.</p>

<p>Henry S. Grein, a wealthy Chicago broker, and known
throughout Europe for his art collections, received the
stereotyped demand. He 'phoned the police, and Scotland Yard
sent its best man to interview the millionaire at the Fitz
Hotel, where he was staying.</p>

<p>"I pay nothing," said the millionaire. He was tall and
hard-faced, with a mouth like a rat trap, and the secret service
man knew that here the "Red Hand" had come up against a tough
proposition. "It is your business to see that I do not get
killed; you may make what arrangements you like, but I am going
to offer a reward of $20,000 for the arrest of the gang, or the
leader."</p>

<p>Then began that extraordinary feud which first opened the
eyes of the public to the condition of affairs which
existed.</p>

<p>The history of Grein's fight with his assassins on the roof
of the Fitz Hotel, his shooting down of the man Antonio Ferrino
who had gained admission to his bedroom, the abortive attempt to
blow up the Fitz Hotel by dynamite; all these facts are so much
history. It was on the morning that Henry S. Grein's body was
found floating on the Thames off Cleopatra's Needle that the
Government turned to Tillizini.</p>

<p>On the evening of his return from Burboro' Tillizini sat at
his broad desk working out a side issue of the problem. The red
glow from the shaded lamp by his side gave his face a sinister
appearance which ordinarily it did not possess. It was a thin
and deeply-lined face, a little sallow and a shade bluish about
the jaw and upper lip; the nose was long and pinched, the
eyebrows black and arched; but whatever unpleasant impression
the somewhat Mephistophelean features may have produced, that
impression was forgotten in the pleasant shock which came to the
observer who saw Tillizini's eyes.</p>

<p>Italian as he was in every feature, his eyes were almost
Irish in their soft greyness; big and clear and luminous, the
long black lashes which shaded them gave them an added
beauty.</p>

<p>With his left hand resting on his book to keep the stiff
volume open at the page, he reached across the table to a gold
cigarette box, took a long, thin cigarette, and lit it at the
small electric lamp which stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>The room wherein he sat was lofty and spacious. The ceiling
and the fireplace were as Adam's magic art had left them. The
walls were half panelled in dark oak and, save for a small
water-colour sketch of a woodland scene on the left of the
fireplace, they were innocent of pictures.</p>

<p>Along one wall ran a bookshelf that stretched from the outer
wall to a door near the window.</p>

<p>The windows were long and narrow and were hung with dull red
curtains. There was cosiness in the big gilt screen by the fire,
in the roomy club chair, the soft thick carpet and the tiny
clock that ticked musically over the mantelshelf.</p>

<p>Tillizini read steadily, the smoke of his cigarette rising in
blue coils to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Suddenly he closed the book with a snap and rose
noiselessly.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock: it was an idle glance, for he knew
the time. He had an eerie sub-consciousness of the hour, be it
day or night.</p>

<p>He walked to one of the three windows and looked out upon the
Embankment.</p>

<p>He saw a crescent of cold lights that stretched towards
Blackfriars and was intersected dimly by the bulk of Waterloo
Bridge. Across the river was an illuminated sign imploring him
to drink somebody's wine at his own expense; farther down a tall
tower of reappearing and vanishing light urged him to the
consumption of the only whisky worth while.</p>

<p>The professor watched without a smile.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright splash of light started, and was as
suddenly extinguished. Again it flamed&mdash;dazzling, white,
palpitating light&mdash; and again vanished.</p>

<p>Tillizini stepped back quickly. From a cupboard he took a
strange-looking lamp and a coil of wire. He rapidly affixed the
plugged end with a connexion in the wall, then he switched out
all the lights of the room, and waited. Again the bright light
flickered on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The professor touched a key at the base of the lamp, and from
its conical-shaped projector shot a swift beam of soft blue
light.</p>

<p>Twice he did this, when the light on the other bank began to
wink furiously and at a breakneck pace. Long wink, short wink,
long, short; without a pause it raced onward with its urgent
message.</p>

<p>As the lamp spoke Tillizini answered it shortly. He read the
message as easily as though it were in a printed book, for he
knew English as well as he knew his mother tongue, and,
moreover, he was an expert in such matters.</p>

<p>The light on the other shore ceased talking, and Tillizini
closed the window at which he had been standing, replaced his
projector in his cupboard, and the little table on which it had
stood against the wall. Then he drew down the blind and switched
on the ceiling light.</p>

<p>He stood over his desk and wrote rapidly the purport of the
message he had received. It was written in small cramped signs
which might have been, and probably were, a shorthand which he
alone understood. He had scarcely finished when the musical
thrill of an electric bell arrested him. He pressed an electric
push inserted in the leg of the table, hastily slipped his
notebook into a drawer, and turned as the door opened.</p>

<p>The neatly-dressed manservant ushered in a visitor.</p>

<p>"Inspector Crocks," he announced.</p>

<p>Crocks was short and stout and jovial. His head was as bald
as a billiard ball, his peaked beard was shot with grey; he was
a bourgeois of the bourgeois; yet, for all his unpromising
appearance, Tillizini had no delusions where this smart
policeman was concerned.</p>

<p>"Sit down, inspector"&mdash;he indicated a chair. "A
cigarette?"</p>

<p>The inspector smiled.</p>

<p>"Too subtle for me," he said, "I'm a pipe smoker."</p>

<p>"Fill up," said the professor, with a little smile.</p>

<p>He did not insult his visitor by offering him tobacco, for he
knew that it was an attention which all pipe-smokers resent,
calling into question as it does their own discrimination and
judgment.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, as the other slowly filled his polished
briar.</p>

<p>"Your countrymen&mdash;if you will pardon me&mdash;are not
helpful, they are a little&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are liars," said the young professor calmly. "All men
are liars when they are afraid, and I tell you these poor devils
are afraid in a way you cannot understand. Not for themselves,
but for their children, their wives and their old mothers and
fathers." He rose from the table and walked slowly up and down
the room.</p>

<p>"These men you want are merciless&mdash;you don't know what I
mean by merciless. It is a word which to you signifies a certain
unjust harshness, cruelty, perhaps. But, my friend... cruelty!"
He laughed, a bitter little laugh. "You don't know what cruelty
is, not the type of cruelty which flourishes on the shores of
the Adriatic. I won't tell you, it would spoil your night's
sleep."</p>

<p>The detective smiled.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;a little," he said quietly, puffing a cloud of
smoke and watching it disperse with a thoughtful eye.</p>

<p>"Your idea," the professor continued, "is to catch
them&mdash;very good. And when you have caught them to secure
evidence against them&mdash;very good again," he said drily;
"one is as easy as the other. Now my view is that they are
vermin, society's rats, to be exterminated without trial and
without remorse."</p>

<p>He spoke quietly; there was no trace of emotion in his voice
nor in his gesture. The hand that went searching for a cigarette
in the gold box was steady; yet Crocks, no sentimentalist,
shivered.</p>

<p>"I know that is your view," he said, with a forced smile,
"yet it is not the view which finds favour in this country; it
is a view which would get you into serious trouble with the
authorities and might even bring you to the Old Bailey on the
capital charge."</p>

<p>The professor laughed&mdash;a low, musical laugh. He ran his
fingers through his grey-streaked hair with a characteristic
gesture, then sank into the padded chair by the desk.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said briskly, "what have you discovered?"</p>

<p>The detective shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, "that is, nothing worth while. The gang
is unreachable&mdash;the people who can give information are
dumb brutes; they are either afraid, or in league with the 'Red
Hand.' I've tried threatening them; I've tried bribing them;
neither is of the least use."</p>

<p>Tillizini laughed softly.</p>

<p>"And the 'Red Hand'&mdash;have they made any further
move?"</p>

<p>The detective's hand went to his pocket. He drew forth a
bundle of papers enclosed in an elastic band. From this he
extracted a letter.</p>

<p>"This has been addressed to the Sa' Remo Ambassador," he
said. "I won't trouble to read it to you; it is the usual sort
of thing. Only this time it is a child who is threatened."</p>

<p>"A child!"</p>

<p>Tillizini's black brows met in an ugly frown. "That is their
principal card," he said slowly, "I wondered how long they would
keep their hands off the children; what does he threaten, our
unknown?"</p>

<p>"Abduction first&mdash;murder afterwards, if the abduction
fails."</p>

<p>Tillizini took the letter from the other's hand and read it
carefully. He held the paper to the light.</p>

<p>"This is the American gang&mdash;I thought we'd wiped them
out, but it was evidently a bigger organization than I
credited."</p>

<p>The musical little bell rang overhead. Tillizini raised his
eyes, listening. After the shortest interval the bell rang
again.</p>

<p>The professor nodded. A big black box stood at one corner of
the table&mdash;he unlocked it, the detective watching him
curiously. With the turning of the key and the lifting of the
lid, the front fell away, revealing three sedate rows of crystal
phials.</p>

<p>Tillizini took one from the front, slipped it in his pocket,
then bent down and pressed the bell in the table.</p>

<p>The door opened to admit a servant, followed by a fresh-coloured
young man evidently of the working class. Crocks looked
at him, saw he was an Englishman, and wondered in what way the
two men had become acquainted. The young man accepted a seat at
the invitation of Tillizini.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said the professor pleasantly, "you are
willing to go on with this matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said the other, firmly.</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"I got your message," he said. He turned to the
detective.</p>

<p>"This man's name is Carter," he said briefly; "he is an
out-of-work plumber, unmarried, without family, and prepared to take
risks. You have been in the army, I think?" he said.</p>

<p>The newcomer nodded. He sat uneasily on the edge of his chair
as though unused to good society, and with obvious
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I advertised," Tillizini went on, "for a man who was willing
to risk his life; I'm paying him two hundred pounds, and he is
earning it."</p>

<p>Crocks was mystified.</p>

<p>"Exactly what does he do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That," said Tillizini, with a slow smile, "is exactly what
he does not know."</p>

<p>He turned to the other man, who grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I carry out instructions," he said, "and I've had a hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"Lucid enough, Mr. Crocks; he does nothing except live in a
lodging in Soho, make his way to a wharf over there," he pointed
out of the window, "every evening at about this hour, signal to
me a fairly unintelligible message, and afterwards walk slowly
across Westminster Bridge, along the Embankment, up Villiers
Street, and so to my house."</p>

<p>He paced the room with long swinging strides.</p>

<p>"He has taken his life in his hands, and he knows it," he
said. "I have told him that he will probably be assassinated,
but that does not deter him."</p>

<p>"In these hard times," said the soldier, "a little thing like
that doesn't worry you; it is better to be assassinated than to
be starved to death, and I have been out of work for twelve
months until Mr. Tillizini gave me this job."</p>

<p>"He receives two hundred pounds," Tillizini went on, "by
contract. I have paid him one hundred, I shall pay him another
hundred to-night and his expenses. Probably," he said, with a
little smile, "he may escape with minor injuries, in which case
I shall congratulate him heartily."</p>

<p>He turned briskly to the man.</p>

<p>"Now let me have all the papers you have got in that pocket.
Put them on the table."</p>

<p>The man dived into his various pockets and produced scraps of
paper, memorandum, pocket-books&mdash;all the literary
paraphernalia of his class.</p>

<p>From his pocket Tillizini took the phial he had removed from
the medicine chest. He unstoppered it, and a pungent, sickly
odour filled the room. With the moist tip of the stopper he
touched each article the man had laid on the table.</p>

<p>"You will get used to the smell," he said, with a smile; "you
won't notice it after a while."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Crocks, curiously.</p>

<p>"You will be surprised when I tell you," said the other. "It
is double distilled attar of roses, the vilest smell in the
world in its present stage, and this bottle I have in my hand is
worth commercially, twenty-five pounds."</p>

<p>At a nod from Tillizini, Carter gathered up his papers and
replaced them in his pockets.</p>

<p>"You have a revolver?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the man. "I'm just getting used to it. I
don't understand these automatic pistols, but I went down to
Wembley the other day and had some practice."</p>

<p>"I hope that no occasion will arise for you to have practice
nearer at hand," said Tillizini, dryly.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and the servant came.</p>

<p>"Get Mr. Carter some supper," he ordered. He nodded to the
man as he left.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" asked Crocks.</p>

<p>"That you shall see," said the other.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said the bewildered detective. "Why
should you give this man so large a sum to do nothing more than
send electric signals to you every evening?"</p>

<p>Tillizini sat down at his desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crocks," he said, "it would be false modesty on my part
if I pretended that my movements escape the notice of the 'Red
Hand.' I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that I do not go
in or out of this house without the organization being aware of
the fact. Every step I take is watched; every action of mine is
considered in the light of a possible menace to the society.</p>

<p>"This society knows that every evening I am engaged in the
exchange of messages with a man south of the Thames. The very
mysteriousness will naturally appeal to the Latin temperament,
and its significance will be magnified. On the second night you
may be sure that Carter was located. You may also be sure that
he was watched from the wharf and followed to this house."</p>

<p>A light began to dawn upon the detective. "Then Carter is a
decoy?"</p>

<p>"A two hundred pound decoy," said the other, gravely. "He
knows the risk, I am paying him a big sum; fortunately he is
something of a signaller, and so he is able to tell me through a
code of our own what is happening on the other side of the
river. I freely admit," he smiled, "that so far nothing has
happened worth recording."</p>

<p>"They will kill him," said Crocks.</p>

<p>"They will try," said the other quietly; "he is a pretty
resourceful man, I think. I am hoping that nothing worse will
happen than that they will seek a gentler method of solving the
mystery which surrounds him. Hallo!" The door was thrust open
suddenly, and the servant flew in.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir&mdash;&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Tillizini was on his feet. "Is it
Carter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;he's in the kitchen. I heard a ring at the
bell, and the girl"&mdash;he went on incoherently&mdash;"a girl
sort of fell in. What am I to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"Fell in?" Tillizini stepped quickly past him, and went down
the broad stairs, two at a time, to the hall.</p>

<p>The man had had sufficient presence of mind to close the door
after the strange visitor's appearance.</p>

<p>Lying on the carpeted floor of the hall was the form of a
woman. Tillizini, practised as he was in every subtle move of
the gang, stepped forward cautiously. She lay under an
overhanging light, and he was able to see her face. He lifted
her and walked quickly back up the stairs with his burden.</p>

<p>Crocks was standing in the doorway of the room.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tillizini made no reply. He carried the limp figure and laid
it on the settee by the wall.</p>

<p>"What happened?" he asked the man shortly.</p>

<p>"I heard the bell ring, sir," said the agitated servant, "and
I went to the door thinking it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind all that&mdash;be brief," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>"Well, I opened the door, sir, and she must have fainted
against it. I'd just time to catch her and to drag her into the
hall before she went off."</p>

<p>"Did you see anybody outside?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the man.</p>

<p>"You closed the door behind you, I see," said Tillizini
approvingly. "Really, I shall make something of you,
Thomas."</p>

<p>From his medicine case he took a slender phial, removed the
stopper, and wetted the tip of his finger with the contents. He
brushed this along the lips of the unconscious girl.</p>

<p>"She has only fainted," he said, while with a quick, deft
hand he felt the pulse, and his sensitive fingers pressed the
neck ever so slightly.</p>

<p>The drug he had given her had a marvellously rapid
effect.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes almost immediately and looked round. Then
she caught sight of Tillizini's face.</p>

<p>"Don't try to speak," he said, gently. "Just wait. I will get
you a little wine, though I don't think you will require
it."</p>

<p>She tried to sit up, but his firm hand restrained her.</p>

<p>"Lie quietly for a little while," he said. "This gentleman is
a detective from Scotland Yard. You need have no fear."</p>

<p>"Are you Dr. Tillizini?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"My husband&mdash;you've seen him?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded again.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. He was the man who was sentenced at Burboro'."</p>

<p>A look of pain passed across the white-faced girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was sentenced," she said, weakly. "He was innocent,
but he was sentenced." Tears welled into her eyes.</p>

<p>Tillizini had the narrow blue phial in the palm of his hand.
Again he tilted it, and again the tip of his little finger swept
across the lips of the girl. She knit her brows.</p>

<p>"What is that?" she said. "It is very sweet stuff."</p>

<p>The professor smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very sweet, my child," he said, "but it will do
you a lot of good."</p>

<p>His prediction was verified, for in a few minutes she sat
up&mdash;calm and collected.</p>

<p>"I heard you had been to see my husband," she said. "I wanted
to talk to you, but you had gone; and then I thought I would
write to you, and I was starting my letter when a gentleman
came."</p>

<p>"Which gentleman?" asked Tillizini.</p>

<p>"The Italian gentleman," she replied&mdash;"the one my
husband said had asked him to go to Highlawn. Oh, I knew it
wasn't true that he burgled Sir Ralph. Poor as we were, he would
never have done such a thing."</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded, he raised his hand with a reproving little
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Italian came, and what did he want?"</p>

<p>She was calm again.</p>

<p>"He gave me some money," said the girl, "and told me that he
would see that my husband was released, and I was so grateful
because I felt so sure that he would go to Sir Ralph and tell
him, and George would be let out of gaol."</p>

<p>She was little more than a child, and the men who listened
were too full of pity to smile at her naive conception of Sir
Ralph's power.</p>

<p>"And then," she went on, "he asked me a dreadful thing."</p>

<p>She shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>"He asked me to do that for which my husband was
convicted."</p>

<p>"To go to the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded.</p>

<p>"And to take a package?"</p>

<p>Again the girl nodded.</p>

<p>"And you were to do this on Friday night?"</p>

<p>His eyes were blazing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>A little look of fear came into her face. She was out of her
depth in these plots and machinations, this simple country girl,
who had entered into the responsibilities and trials of marriage
at an age when most girls were at school.</p>

<p>"I know," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>He walked up and down the apartment, his hands thrust in his
pockets, his head bent.</p>

<p>"You won't be able to do it now. They've watched you come up
here; I suppose that's why you came to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I am so afraid of these men. We are quiet
country folk. We have never been mixed up in anything like
this."</p>

<p>Tillizini considered a moment; then he took down the
telephone receiver and gave a number. He had a brief
conversation with somebody in Italian and he spoke with an air
of authority. He hung the receiver up again.</p>

<p>"I have telephoned for a lady to come here to take you to her
house," he said. "I don't think these people will bother you at
all, because you know nothing which can possibly affect them one
way or the other. I suppose," he said, turning to Crocks, "that
you can give me a couple of men to look after this girl till she
reaches the house where I am sending her?"</p>

<p>Crocks nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll take her myself," he said, jovially. "I am worth two
men."</p>

<p>Tillizini smiled.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think," he said, "that you are worth three. The
one you are, the one you can be, and the one you never appear to
be!"</p>

<p>Crocks chuckled.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE THREE</h2>

<p class="first">IF you walk from London Bridge along Tooley
Street, through Rotherhithe, you come to Lower Deptford. Passing
through this, you reach Deptford proper, and leading off from
the left you will find a long straight road which crosses the
Ravensbourne, and connects Greenwich&mdash;the one quaint corner
of London which steadfastly refuses to be entirely
modernized&mdash;with its more busy neighbour.</p>

<p>The connecting road once accommodated the well-to-do middle
class of Deptford, in the days when Deptford was a prosperous
port, and when swarthy seafaring men with gold ear-rings
recalled the brave days when the Great Peter himself worked in
the shipyard and lived in a piggish fashion at Evelyn House.</p>

<p>The houses are narrow-fronted and of a set pattern. There are
overhanging wooden canopies to each of the doors; in some one
finds traces of oak panelling, but usually the present-day
tenants have utilized such of the wood as they can detach for
the purpose of lighting their fires. For what was once
Deptford's glory is now Deptford's slum. The great houses ring
with the shrill voices of innumerable children. Floor after
floor is let out in tenements, and in some cases a dozen
families occupy the restricted space which, in olden times,
barely sufficed to accommodate the progeny of opulent ship
chandlers.</p>

<p>When Mill Lane was Rowtonized, its hovels, its insanitary
dens and its quaint little cottages pulled down by a wise
borough architect, the Italian colony which had made its home in
that unsalubrious neighbourhood moved northward and distributed
itself along the road of ancient respectability.</p>

<p>In the main the Italian made a good neighbour, quiet, sober,
inoffensive; his piano-organ stalled in the confined area of the
back yard, was, perhaps, a nuisance to men who loved to sleep
far into the morning, but he gave little offence otherwise.</p>

<p>In one of these houses, on an upper floor, three men were
sitting round a table. A large fiasco of Chianti occupied the
place of honour upon the table, and glasses had been set for the
men by one who was evidently the host. The windows were heavily
curtained and shuttered, the door itself had been edged with
felt by the careful tenant, and as a further precaution against
interruption there sat outside the door, two steps down the
narrow stairs, the dark figure of a man, whose duty it was to
see that the conference was not disturbed.</p>

<p>The host was a tall man, immensely powerful; his black hair
was cropped short; his face, lined and seamed, was half hidden
by a bushy black beard.</p>

<p>His shirt opened to show a patch of hairy chest, and the
powerful arms revealed by the rolled-up sleeves spoke of
enormous strength. They spoke truly, for Tommasino Patti bore in
his own country the nickname "Il Bue," which signifies, "The
Ox."</p>

<p>It was as "Il Bue" that his companions knew him, though there
was nothing bovine in the evil but intelligent face, nor in his
lithe, quick movements.</p>

<p>The man on his left was short and stout; clean-shaven save
for a black moustache, carefully twisted to a curl at either
end. He was short of breath, and spoke like one with chronic
asthma, in deep, rumbling, wheezy tones.</p>

<p>Facing Il Bue was a young man who contrasted remarkably with
his companions. For, whilst the giant was careless to the point
of slovenliness in his attire, and the stout man but little
better, this third member of the council was dressed with
exquisite care.</p>

<p>He was a slim and graceful young man of medium height;
handsome, with his olive skin, his fine forehead, and his slight
dark moustache. He wore a suit of simple cut, which fitted him
perfectly. His cravat was of dull black silk, and the only
jewellery he wore was a black pearl in his cravat, and a thin
gold chain across his waistcoat.</p>

<p>He was a man who had been carefully valeted, and, from the
dove-grey spats on his boots to his manicured finger-tips, he
was correctness personified. His silk-lined overcoat lay
carefully folded over the back of the chair, with a soft black
felt hat on top. He himself lounged in the one comfortable chair
which the room boasted&mdash;and his legs thrown over the arm of
the chair displayed a glimpse of grey silk socks. He looked
little more than twenty, though he was in reality much
older.</p>

<p>His attitude towards the others was one of amused curiosity.
From time to time he examined his beautiful nails with
solicitude, as though he found them much more interesting than
the conversation. And yet the talk was startling enough.</p>

<p>The stout man had finished the story of his adventure.</p>

<p>"And Signors," he said appealingly, "I, myself, could have
secured this jewel, but for the restrictions which your
Excellencies placed on me."</p>

<p>He spoke alternately to Il Bue and the young man at the foot
of the table.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, in extravagant despair, "why is it necessary
that you should employ a third person&mdash;one without finesse,
like this man, Mansingham, who blunders through the house,
awakes the servants, and is arrested? It was tempting
Providence, Signors; it would be almost as much a temptation to
employ the girl."</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p>"You are a fool," he said.</p>

<p>They were speaking in liquid Italian, and the youth's voice
was soft and melodious.</p>

<p>"Have we no example of the folly of acting otherwise?"</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows, and for a moment a baleful light
shone in his eyes, changing the whole character of his face.</p>

<p>"Listen, my little man." He tapped the table before him, and
spoke with quiet emphasis. "What may seem simple to you is not
so simple to us. It is the rule of 'Our Friends,' when such a
raid is carried out, that the person who abstracts and the
person who immediately receives shall be unknown to one another.
Moreover," he said, carefully choosing his words, "it is
necessary, since a certain happening which you may remember,
that the medallion, if medallion it be, shall be received by two
of our brethren, and not by one."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I repeat," he said, "And not by one."</p>

<p>He looked at Il Bue, still smiling, and then at the stout
man.</p>

<p>"A year ago," he said, "we had marked down something we
required. It was a medallion. One of those two medallions, I
know, contains a secret which will make us rich. We commissioned
a brother skilled in scientific abstraction to remove that
jewel. It follows, my dear Pietro, that the same set of brains
which can wield, with great skill, a set of tools for the
removal of locks or the forcing of glass cases may be entirely
inefficient or inadequate when it comes to the removal and the
safeguarding of the treasure. In stealing, as in all other
sciences, the specialist has the advantage; we instruct one
specialist to take the medallion from its case&mdash;wherever it
may be&mdash;we employ two other specialists jointly to receive
that jewel and to take it to a place of safety&mdash;watching
each other the while. You follow me?"</p>

<p>The stout man nodded grudgingly, and the young man went
on.</p>

<p>"The gentleman," he said, with grim humour, "who received
that precious relic of which the society stood in the greatest
need, disappeared with it. He was false to his oath, false to
his kin; he demonstrated the falsity of the English adage, that
there was honour amongst thieves&mdash;and indeed there is
not&mdash;and, although eventually we found him, we never found
the jewel."</p>

<p>He took a flat gold cigarette case from his pocket, took out
a cigarette and lit it.</p>

<p>"It would have been no satisfaction to us to remove this
erring friend. It was fortunate that he saved us the trouble by
removing himself. We did not find the jewel," he repeated. "That
most desirable thing he had, in his panic, handed to some
peasant or other. That peasant we have at last located."</p>

<p>He exchanged a swift glance with Il Bue, and the big man
nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>"Whether we shall get the jewel remains to be seen,"
continued the exquisite young man, puffing rings of smoke at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"At any rate, the necessity for taking precautions in the
matter of receiving these articles which are so precious to us,
and which are located with such great pains and with such
labour, must be fairly obvious."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Now, I have little time to spare. Let me see what is to be
seen."</p>

<p>The big man rose and walked heavily across the room. He put
his hand under the pillow of a truckle bed which stood in the
corner, and pulled out a long, flat box. He brought it to the
other, and opened it with a key which hung with a crucifix about
his neck.</p>

<p>It was a curious collection which met the young man's eyes.
The box was almost filled with lockets of every conceivable
shape and description. There were lockets of gold and of silver,
lockets carved from crystal, lockets so encrusted with jewels
that it was impossible to tell what was the subsidiary metal.
Some bore a painted miniature, others were brilliant with
enamels.</p>

<p>The young man fingered them with quick and skilful hands. He
lifted them one by one from their box, laid them in the palm of
his hand, and turned them; and, as he examined, he rejected.</p>

<p>He finished his labours at last.</p>

<p>"They are very valuable," he said, "but not of the value I
hoped. We have to search still further. I believe that the
locket which is in the possession of this foolish man
Morte-Mannery is more likely to be the one we seek than any other.
We must lose no time and spare no pains to secure it."</p>

<p>He took a flat leather wallet from his inside coat pocket,
opened it and removed a sheet of paper. There was a drawing in
pencil.</p>

<p>"This is it," he said, "if any is."</p>

<p>He passed the design to the stout man.</p>

<p>"You observe those curious arabesques, that cupid, that tiny
hoofed devil? That is the master's own work."</p>

<p>He spoke with enthusiasm. For one moment the sinister object
of the chase was lost sight of in his artistic appreciation of
the design.</p>

<p>"There are two such lockets in the world."</p>

<p>He spoke more quickly now.</p>

<p>"One we may secure to-night. The other on Friday. We must
make some arrangements. If necessary I will go down myself and
receive the locket. This drawing," he pointed to the paper,
"almost decides me. We can afford to slacken our efforts
elsewhere and concentrate them upon Burboro'. By the way, what
money is wanted?"</p>

<p>"A thousand English pounds," said the stout man,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The young man laughed.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to ask for a thousand pounds for something
which may be of no value whatever," he said. "You must promise
her&mdash;where is she, by the way?"</p>

<p>"She will be in town to-night, Signor," said Pietro.</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"She is very faithful and enthusiastic," he said; "a curious
woman, our Lisa," he mused, as he rose.</p>

<p>Il Bue jumped to his feet and assisted him with his
overcoat.</p>

<p>"You will probably find her useful, to-night."</p>

<p>"Why don't you trust her to get the jewel from this pig's
house?" asked the tall man gruffly.</p>

<p>The young exquisite smiled.</p>

<p>"My poor man," he said, "if I do not trust a brother, why
should I trust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said, a little harshly, as he stood by the door
buttoning his coat, "I take no more risks. My father warned me
against any such folly, and I neglected his warning. I have had
to pay the price for my neglect. Who is outside?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Beppo," said Il Bue. "I had to have somebody who was
reliable. Beppo loves the dark."</p>

<p>"He is an unwholesome beast," said the young man, lightly.
"He would cut my throat or yours for a piastre."</p>

<p>"That may be," said the other, with a growl, "but a man whose
neck is in danger, and whose life depends upon keeping faith, is
one to employ for such work."</p>

<p>They opened the door, the brawny host leading the way,
carrying a hand-lamp. A figure sat crouched on the stairs, his
knees drawn up and his head bent low.</p>

<p>"A pretty sentry! He's asleep!" said the young man.</p>

<p>Il Bue leant down, and grasped the man by the neck.</p>

<p>"Wake up, you dog," he hissed. "Is this the way?"</p>

<p>Then he stopped, for the head fell back jerkily, and a handle
of a dagger protruding from his heart gave them a complete
explanation of his silence.</p>

<p>Yes! there he lay&mdash;this man, who had perjured himself
clear of the scaffold in two countries&mdash;this jackal of a
villainous confederacy&mdash;and the three men stared at him in
amazement and horror.</p>

<p>The former state only could be applied to the young man, who,
without any pause, without any sign of emotion, continued
buttoning his gloves.</p>

<p>"There is only one man who could have done that," he said,
thoughtfully, "and that man is Antonio Tillizini."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE GOLDEN
ANTONIO</h2>

<p class="first">"SIGNOR&mdash;for the love of Heaven!" The
Strand was crowded with a matinee throng, and the idle folk
which promenade that famous thoroughfare before the Easter
holiday filled the sidewalks.</p>

<p>To the man in a hurry the name of the loitering, sauntering
pleasure-seekers was anathema. Frank Gallinford was that man in
a hurry, for the 6.30 Burboro' express waits for no man, and,
though Charing Cross was in sight, there remained only two
minutes to get through the crowd, into the station, and on to
the platform.</p>

<p>He cursed the idlers deeply and earnestly as he elbowed and
pushed his way forward. To leave the pavement was to court
disaster, for the roadway was blocked with traffic, and moreover
an intelligent authority had had it dug up at its busiest
portion and railed off to half its width for "repairs."</p>

<p>Frank Gallinford had stepped from the kerb into the roadway,
and from the roadway on to the kerb again, dodging between the
hawkers who vended their wares; he had sprung away from the
wheels of devastating motor-cars, and buffeted stout and
leisurely gentlemen in his effort to reach the station on time,
but he seemed as far from his objective as ever.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly felt his sleeve clutched and the
words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Signor, in the name of Mary!"</p>

<p>They were gasped rather than spoken, and the language
employed was Italian.</p>

<p>Frank stopped and looked round with a bewildered frown. Who
spoke to him in Italian in this most English Strand&mdash;and
who knew that he was acquainted with the language?</p>

<p>The man at his elbow was unquestionably Latin. His long,
cadaverous face, covered with a week's growth of beard, was
working almost convulsively in his agitation. The big black eyes
that stared at him from beneath two shaggy brows blazed as only
Southern eyes can blaze.</p>

<p>In a moment the Englishman's anxiety to catch his train was
forgotten. The soft accents which he knew so well, and loved so
well, came to his ears like the first sigh of the breeze that
ripples the Adriatic on summer nights. It stirred memories of a
simple and charming peasantry, it brought visions of the marble
palaces of the old Venetian nobility.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend?" he asked, kindly.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak to you here," said the man, dropping his
voice and speaking quickly. "You remember me,
Signor?&mdash;Romano&mdash;I was your foreman on the harbour
works at Cattaro."</p>

<p>Frank remembered, and his hand dropped in a friendly salute
on the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Remember you, Miguelo mio!" he laughed, "why, however could
I forget you! You were the man who swam out to me when I was
seized with cramp&mdash;confound you, you saved my life!"</p>

<p>A faint smile flickered across the lips of the little
Italian, and then the look of anxiety came again.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he whispered, "this is urgent, you do not know,
you cannot understand."</p>

<p>With no other word, he plunged into the throng, and Frank
Gallinford, keeping him in sight, followed.</p>

<p>Romano turned the first corner he reached. It was a steep
street which led down into the Adelphi.</p>

<p>Here the stream of traffic dried up. Into the gloomy depths
only the most experienced travellers, who knew this contributed
a short cut to the District Railway station, ventured, and the
two men had the thoroughfare to themselves.</p>

<p>When they had gone fifty yards the Italian stopped, and Frank
observed that he chose a spot midway between two street-lamps
where the light was dimmest and most uncertain.</p>

<p>"Signor," he said, speaking rapidly, almost incoherently,
"you know me a little. I am a mason, and I was brought to London
to work on the new Italian restaurant in Regent Street. I have
no friend in London, no one to whom I can turn&mdash;and I am in
despair "&mdash;he wrung his hands, and his voice, though he
kept it low by sheer effort of control, was shrill,&mdash;"and
then I saw your face&mdash;your strong, calm English face in
that great crowd, Signor&mdash;like a saint, Signor...."</p>

<p>Frank was too accustomed to the extravagance of the Italian
compliment to feel embarrassed, though he had never overcome the
sense of shyness which comes to the more phlegmatic Anglo-Saxon
in face of florid flattery.</p>

<p>"I am not feeling particularly angelic, Miguelo," he said,
with a rueful smile as the recollection of his lost train
occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Signor," the man went on. "Years ago, when I was
younger, I was in New York&mdash;and for a joke, Signor&mdash;I
swear it was no more than a youthful jest&mdash;I joined a
Society. I took oaths&mdash;I thought nothing of it. Then I went
away to my own country, later to Montenegro, then to Italy
again&mdash;and now to London. And, Signor, they have found me,
my Society. And they tell me I must do horrible
things&mdash;horrible&mdash;horrible."</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands and groaned. Frank was
puzzled. He knew of these secret societies, had indeed seen
their milder manifestations. He had endured an exasperating
strike on more occasions than one as a result of some offence
given to an official of a society. But never had he glimpsed the
tragedy, the underlying horror of these mysterious
associations.</p>

<p>He laid his hand gently on the other's arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, soothingly, "you need not
worry&mdash;this is England. These things do not happen here. If
you are threatened, go to the police."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" protested the man, frantic with terror; "you do
not understand. My only hope is to get away ... if I could reach
the Argentine&mdash;come&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>He dragged the other with him to the nearest street-lamp,
fumbling in his pocket the while.</p>

<p>"They want me for many reasons," he said, "and for this most
of all."</p>

<p>His coat was one of those heavy cloth coats which Italian
labourers wear, the corners of the pockets ornamented with tiny
triangles of rusty black velvet. From the depths of a pocket the
man produced a little case. It looked like a jewel case, and the
Englishman observed that it was very new. Romano's trembling
hand sought for the catch. He found it after a while, and the
satin-lined lid flew open. On a bed of dark blue velvet lay a
little medallion.</p>

<p>"San Antonio," said the Italian, in a hushed, eager
voice.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful piece of work. The back	ground was made up
of small diamonds, the Saint with the Babe was in gold relief.
This was no stamped and minted impression, but a piece of rare
and delicate carving.</p> <p>"Signor," said Miguelo, "a month
ago a man who was a

friend of mine brought this to me&mdash;how it came to him I do
not know. He asked me to take care of it, and in
time&mdash;these were his words, Signor&mdash;to restore
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>A motor-car came swiftly down the street, and the Italian
looked round apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Take it!"</p>

<p>He thrust the case into Gallinford's hands, clicking it closed
as he did it.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take it&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>The car drew up abreast of them and, as the lacquered door
swung open, Romano shrank back against the railings.</p>

<p>Two men alighted, and they were followed by a woman.</p>

<p>She was tall, slim, graceful. Frank could not see her face,
for it was thickly veiled, but her voice was low and sweet.</p>

<p>"This is the man," she said, and pointed to the cowering
Italian.</p>

<p>The two men sprang at Romano and caught him by the arms.
There was the click of handcuffs.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" asked Gallinford, though, with
a sinking heart, he anticipated the answer.</p>

<p>"This man has taken a jewel of mine," the lady replied.</p>

<p>"What does she say&mdash;what does she say?" asked the
Italian. The conversation had been in English; Frank
translated.</p>

<p>"It is a lie&mdash;a lie!&mdash;&mdash;" screamed Romano,
struggling desperately as they dragged him toward the car; "save
me, for God's sake, Signor!"</p>

<p>The Englishman hesitated. He had all the national repugnance
of a "scene." He knew that the Italian would at any rate be safe
at the police station&mdash;and if he were guilty, as it seemed
probable, he needed no protection. The whole story was a
cock-and-bull invention.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To Marlborough Street," said one of the men gruffly.</p>

<p>"Go quietly, Miguelo," said Frank, turning to the struggling
man, "I will follow you."</p>

<p>But the prisoner had gone limp, he had fainted.</p>

<p>They lifted him into the car and the men jumped in after. The
woman waited expectantly. Then Frank saw a second car behind. As
the first car manoeuvred to turn, he heard voices in
altercation. Miguelo had recovered from his swoon; there was a
scuffle, and the Italian's head appeared at the window.</p>

<p>"Signor!" there was agony in his voice, "tell Signor
Tillizini&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hand was placed over his mouth, and he was dragged back as
the car rolled up the hill and into the slow-moving traffic.</p>

<p>Frank waited. He half expected the woman to speak. Then it
occurred to him that she would regard him, if not as an
accomplice, at least as a friend of the arrested man, and he
went red.</p>

<p>She stepped lightly into the second car. This did not turn,
but made its way downhill.</p>

<p>It was on the point of moving off when he remembered with a
shock that, if he was not the thief, he was all unwillingly a
receiver. The jewel was still in his pocket.</p>

<p>The car was on the move when he realized this and sprang to
the door of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "a word&mdash;I have something to
say&mdash;I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Through the open window of the car he saw the woman draw
back.</p>

<p>"I want you&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and jumped back as he
saw the flash of descending steel.</p>

<p>He was just in time.</p>

<p>The thin stiletto aimed at him struck the edge of the window,
and Frank, temporarily dazed, stumbled to his knees in the muddy
road as the car jerked ahead and vanished round the corner of
Adam Street.</p>

<p>One glimpse he got of a white hand still clasping the hilt of
the quivering poignard&mdash;a white hand on a finger of which
glowed a square black opal.</p>

<p>He rose slowly to his feet, dumbfounded. He was furiously
angry. She had evidently mistaken him for a robber.</p>

<p>He brushed the mud from his knees with a handkerchief, and
collected his thoughts, swearing softly.</p>

<p>Here was he, a prosaic young engineer on his way to meet his
fiancee in prosaic Burboro', engaged in an adventure which was
three parts melodrama and one part comedy.</p>

<p>"This comes from listening to plausible Italians?" he said,
savagely. He made his way to the Strand and hailed a
taxicab.</p>

<p>"Marlborough Street Police Station," he directed.</p>

<p>He would rid himself of this infernal jewel and clear
himself, at any rate.</p>

<p>The sergeant returned his greeting curtly, taking in the
mud-stained figure with professional suspicion.</p>

<p>"Romano," he said. "No, we haven't a Romano here."</p>

<p>"He has just been arrested by two of your men," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"No warrant has been executed for a man of that name," said
the sergeant, shaking his head. "Just wait a minute and I'll ask
Bow Street."</p>

<p>He went into an adjoining room, and Frank heard the tinkle of
a telephone.</p>

<p>By and by the officer returned.</p>

<p>"Neither Bow Street nor Vine Street know anything about it,"
he said.</p>

<p>Briefly the young man told the story of the arrest, omitting
only the fact that the jewel reposed in his pocket. He had no
desire to find himself detained. With Miguelo to confirm his
story and with the prosecutrix present to identify the jewel, it
would be different. And he had, too, an overpowering desire to
explain to the murderous lady, in person, his honourable
intentions.</p>

<p>"No sir," the sergeant went on, "we've no
Italians&mdash;we've had enough of them since the 'Red Hand'
started operations in England. But since Mr. Tillizini began
working for Scotland Yard, they haven't been so busy."</p>

<p>"Tillizini?" cried Frank, with a start.</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the gentleman," he said, complacently; "if you want
to know anything about Italian criminals, you'd better see
him&mdash;108, Adelphi Terrace; anyway, you'd best come back
again&mdash;the C.I.D. men may be working independently."</p>

<p>Frank walked in the neighbourhood of the station until ten
o'clock that night. He sent a wire to his host and dined at a
Piccadilly restaurant.</p>

<p>The clock was striking the hour when he again mounted the
steps of Marlborough Street Station.</p>

<p>The sergeant was not alone. Three over-coated men were
talking together in one cormer of the room.</p>

<p>"Here he is," said the sergeant, and the three turned and
surveyed the young engineer gravely.</p>

<p>"What was the name of that Italian you were inquiring about?"
asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Miguelo della Romano," replied Frank. "Have you found
him?"</p>

<p>The officer nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"Picked him up in the Embankment Gardens&mdash;an hour ago,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"In the mortuary," said the sergeant, "with twenty-five
knife-wounds in his body."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE RARE
COLLECTION</h2>

<p class="first">MARJORIE MEAGH sat at breakfast with her
uncle.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was in an unusually irritable mood. Breakfast was
never a pleasant meal for him, but his fault-finding was
generally concentrated upon the domestic shortcomings of his
wife and the quality of the food.</p>

<p>Now they took a wider range. He put down his paper suddenly
and savagely.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven Vera wouldn't go dashing off to town," he
said.</p>

<p>Although he was a domestic tyrant of a common type, he stood
in some little awe of his young wife. On three occasions in
their lives she had startled him by the vehemence of her
rebellion, and with every explosion he had grown less
self-confident and less satisfied with his own capacity for
commanding the situation.</p>

<p>Marjorie looked up from her letters.</p>

<p>"Vera is making a serious study of the drama," she said. "You
must remember, uncle, that if by any chance she does succeed as
a playwright it will mean an immense income to her."</p>

<p>She was very tactful. She knew that monetary considerations
influenced her uncle. It was Vera's career, which she had
discovered two years before, when a little play, written for a
charitable entertainment, had met with recognition at the hands
of the critics.</p>

<p>Though it had pleasantly surprised her husband to the
possibility of his having discovered a self-supporting wife, it
had been also a source of constant irritation to him. It meant
expense, constant visits to the Metropolis, the cost of seats at
a theatre, though this latter expense had happily been spared
him of late by the discovery of a relation engaged in newspaper
work, who had provided complimentary tickets.</p>

<p>But it meant opening the flat in town; it meant the
detachment of a servant from a household where the domestic
arrangements, as planned by Sir Ralph, were so devised as to
fully occupy every moment of the time of every person
engaged.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph took up the paper only to put it down again a
moment later.</p>

<p>"That scoundrel, Mansingham, has appealed," he said. "It is
monstrous."</p>

<p>The institution of the Court of Criminal Appeal was a sore
point with Sir Ralph. He felt that its creation had been
expressly designed for the purpose of annoying him. He had
written letters to Times about it, and had expressed himself, at
such public functions as gave him opportunity, in no gentle
terms. It was remarkable, under the circumstances, that the
Court of Appeal continued to sit.</p>

<p>"It is monstrous," he said again. "It is a slight upon the
men who are engaged in carrying out the work of administering
criminal law."</p>

<p>His anger came in little spasms. He had a fresh grievance
every few moments. Again his paper came down after an
interval.</p>

<p>"That young man, Gallinford, did not arrive last night,
Marjorie," he said, severely. "The young men of to-day seem to
be lamentably deficient in good manners."</p>

<p>"He wired, uncle," protested the girl. "He said that he was
detained in town."</p>

<p>"Bah!" snapped her uncle, "that isn't good enough. I am a man
of the world, Marjorie. These flimsy excuses do not suffice for
me, and I advise you, if you desire to be happy&mdash;and the
only way to be happy," he said parenthetically, "is to be
without illusions&mdash;to view these unsupported excuses with
suspicion. He is a young man," he went on, elaborating his
grievance, "newly arrived in England after a long absence in a
barbarous country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Italy, uncle," she murmured, "it isn't exactly barbarous,
is it?"</p>

<p>"Barbarous?" he said explosively. "Why, here are two Italian
murders in one day!" He flourished the paper in support of his
contention.</p>

<p>"Of course it is barbarous! And he comes back to civilization
after a long absence, to a beautiful girl, and I admit that you
are that, Marjorie," he said comfortably, with an air of one who
was partly responsible for her beauty, "and instead of rushing,
as he should, and as young men did in my day, to his fiancee, he
breaks his journey in town! It is perfectly inexcusable!"</p>

<p>She did not defend her lover. She knew how valueless such
arguments were with her uncle. He was entirely without
inclination to reason&mdash;at breakfast-time, at any rate.</p>

<p>For the rest of the meal he grumbled spasmodically behind the
paper. He reminded her irresistibly of a dog with a bone. From
time to time he fired little sentences at her&mdash;sentences
which had neither beginning nor end, and were generally
associated with the Government's shortcomings.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the grind of carriage wheels coming up the
carriage drive, and jumped from the table. She gave one glance
through the window and, without a word to her uncle, flew from
the room.</p>

<p>He glared after her in astonishment. In a few minutes she
came back, with a delicate flush on her face and laughter in her
eyes, leading a tall, broad-shouldered young man, brown of face
and smiling a little uneasily, for he did not contemplate the
coming interview with any great sense of joy.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Gallinford, uncle," said the girl. "You have met
him before, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph not only had met him before, but did not wish to
meet him then. He was in no mood for introductions to strange
people. He had, moreover, a grievance against this young man who
had so slighted his hospitality. He greeted Frank Gallinford
with a grunt in which he expressed in his bluff, hearty English
way, as he imagined it, at once his welcome and a foretaste of
the reprimand which was coming.</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, sir," said Frank.</p>

<p>He held out a big, hearty hand and shook Sir Ralph's.</p>

<p>"I owe you an apology for not having come last night."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph inclined his head. There was no doubt whatever
about the apology being due.</p>

<p>"I had a little adventure," Frank went on, and proceeded to
relate the chief events of the previous evening.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he had made up his mind to accept
no explanation as being adequate, Sir Ralph found himself
listening with keen interest. The girl's face showed her
concern.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank," she said, in a shocked voice, "how terrible! Was
he killed?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"I had an interview with the famous detective&mdash;what is
his name?"</p>

<p>"Tillizini?" said Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank, "that was his name. A remarkable chap. Of
course I handed the locket over to the police, and Tillizini has
it now."</p>

<p>"It's very extraordinary," said Sir Ralph, with a puzzled
frown. "Your description of the locket sounds very much like one
I have in my collection."</p>

<p>A sudden panic of fear passed over him. What if this was the
famous locket? What if it had been abstracted without his
noticing it?</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said.</p>

<p>Half-way to the door he turned. "Will you come along with
me?&mdash;perhaps your description of the medallion may be
useful. I have got a fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You don't think it's yours?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Sir Ralph. He was obviously agitated.
They followed him from the room to his study&mdash;a handsome
combination between that and the library. From a steel drawer in
his desk he took a key and led the way again upstairs.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was more than an amateur collector. Whatever his
judgments might be on the Bench, there were few who could
dispute his knowledge of those articles of virtue which it was
his delight to collect. The Morte-Mannery collection, though a
small one, was famous. It was Sir Ralph's pleasure, from time to
time during the year, to show his treasures to the great
connoisseurs of Europe.</p>

<p>The joy of possessing something which nobody else had, or if
they had, only in a minor degree and in a less valuable form;
and, moreover, to hold these wonders of dead craftsmen which
were coveted by less fortunate people, and which is the basis of
every true collector's pride, was the great passion of Sir Ralph
Morte-Mannery's life.</p>

<p>He had devoted forty years to securing and arranging the
hundred and fifty lockets which formed his collection. The room
in which they lay had been specially constructed with a view to
resisting fire and burglars.</p>

<p>It was an open secret that, in rebuilding Highlawns after he
had acquired it, the whole scheme of renovation had circled
about the collection room. It was more like a prison than a
museum, thought Frank, as he followed his conductor through the
narrow entrance guarded with steel doors faced with
rosewood.</p>

<p>It was lighted by a large window, heavily barred, and the
glass itself being set with strong steel network. Burglar alarms
of the most ingenious character rendered entrance without
detection almost impossible. Floors, wall and roof were of
reinforced concrete. One long case ran the length of the room, a
strip of carpet on each side forming the only attempt that had
been made at comfort. The cases themselves were under heavy
wooden shutters, and these Sir Ralph unlocked.</p>

<p>It was a disappointing display to the average man. Row after
row of medallions, dull gold, silver, jewels, enamels. There was
nothing to excite the enthusiasm of any other than a
connoisseur.</p>

<p>Very quickly, one by one, Sir Ralph unshuttered the cases,
his anxious eyes running over the neatly-ticketed rows.</p>

<p>"No," he said, after a survey, "nothing has gone. I thought
from your description that my Leonard...."</p>

<p>The fire of the enthusiast came to his eyes. With hands that
shook a little he unlocked one case, and lifted out a small gold
medallion.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Frank in astonishment as he took it in his
hand, "this is the very locket which the man gave me!"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph smiled.</p>

<p>"That is impossible," he said. "Impossible! Only two such
lockets were known, and one has been irretrievably lost." He
held the little jewel in his hand gingerly. "This and its fellow
were made by the greatest artist that the world has ever known,
Leonardo da Vinci. The date is probably 1387, and the design is
Leonardo's own. It expresses something of the master's genius.
As you know, he was a man who was not satisfied with painting
pictures; there was no branch of art, from sculpture, to the
very mixing of paint, in which he did not interest himself. He
was a doctor and a chemist of no mean qualities, and it was
after the great plague in Milan in 1386 that he made the two
lockets, of which this is the only one extant.</p>

<p>"One he gave to his patron, Il Moro, the usurper of the
Duchy, and the other he gave a year or two subsequently to
Caesar Borgia. They were both commemorations of his patron's
escape from the plague. You will observe on the back"&mdash;he
turned the jewel over gently&mdash;"there is an allegorical
representation. You see the picture of the little fiend?
"&mdash;he pointed it oat with his little finger&mdash;"that
represents the sickness which visited the whole of Italy. You
see the angel?&mdash;that must represent his 'unconquerable
patrons.' What the other signs are&mdash;" he smiled, and this
cheerless room saw all the smiles that Sir Ralph was prepared to
bestow upon the world&mdash;"are incomprehensible to me.
Probably Leonardo was a Futurist."</p>

<p>He chuckled at his own harmless jest, and the girl listened
to him wonderingly, for he was a different man in this
atmosphere. She had never seen him so before; he was human, and
tender and keen.</p>

<p>"The other medallion," Sir Ralph went on, "was stolen from
the Dublin museum. The thief was traced, after a great deal of
trouble, to a cross-Channel boat; he was seen to go on the boat
to cross from Harwich to the Hook of Holland. There must have
been some of his confederates on board, for in the night a great
outcry was heard in one of the cabins, and the detective who
watched him saw him fleeing along the deck pursued by two
foreigners. Before they could either arrest the men who were
following or capture the man himself, he had leapt overboard,
and with him, it was presumed, had passed the second
medallion."</p>

<p>"What was the meaning of it all?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>"We don't know. It was supposed at the time that he was
endeavouring to give the jewel to some of his confederates, and
that in the act of doing so he was seen. The men who were
chasing him that night on the ship gave a plausible explanation;
they said they thought he was mad and endeavouring to commit
suicide, and they were trying to prevent him."</p>

<p>He turned the jewel over again, and looked at it lovingly
before he replaced it in its case.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was your unfortunate man had," he said, "it was
not the fellow to this." Outside, he was himself again, cold,
hard, commonplace, but that little glimpse of his true character
revealed much to Marjorie.</p>

<p>She understood now the ferocity of the sentence he had passed
upon Mansingham. His collection was more than wife or child,
more precious than ambition; his passion was strong enough to
override his sense of justice.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch with a frown. He had remembered one of
the unpleasant facts of life.</p>

<p>"Vera has not returned. I thought she would have come down by
the same train as you."</p>

<p>"I was the only passenger for Burboro', as far as I can
remember," said Frank.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph looked at his watch again.</p>

<p>"There's another train in by now," he said, "she ought to be
here."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken the words when Vera's voice was heard in
the hall below, making inquiries of the servants.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are," she cried.</p>

<p>She looked up as the party descended the broad stairway into
the hall. For a moment a look of wonder came into her eyes at
the sight of Frank.</p>

<p>"You have never met Mr. Gallinford, have you?" asked
Marjorie, as she introduced them.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to meet you now, at any rate," said Vera,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>She was glad, too, that there was some other interest to
temper her husband's annoyance. That he should be annoyed she
took for granted. It was the atmosphere which invariably met her
on her return from town.</p>

<p>He looked again at his watch and then at her, and she
understood the significance of the examination.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," she said, carelessly. "I lost the fast train
and had to take the slow one. It was very annoying. I think my
watch must have been wrong."</p>

<p>Vera had a very beautiful voice, low and rich, and full of
beautiful qualities.</p>

<p>"You've been seeing our wonderful collection?" she said.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph snorted. He hated any claim to partnership in
respect to his medallions, and Vera knew it. It was her oblique
reply to his unspoken attack.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen the best of them; you ought to see the
belts," she said.</p>

<p>"That is a collection which is not sufficiently complete,"
interrupted Sir Ralph stiffly, "to be examined. Really, Vera, I
wish you would not embarrass me by these references."</p>

<p>He strode off to the library, leaving them alone.</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>"He's a great trial sometimes," she said, half to
herself.</p>

<p>Then she turned to the girl, and Marjorie noticed with
pleasure that the moodiness and depression of yesterday was
entirely dissipated. She was at her brightest, her ready smile
came and went.</p>

<p>In a few moments she was chatting with Frank Gallinford about
Italy as though she had known him all her life.</p>

<p>"It must be a quaint country," she said. "You know, I've a
peculiar affection for the land, I am half Italian myself."</p>

<p>"Are you really?"</p>

<p>It was Marjorie who asked the question with girlish delight.
"Oh, I say, how romantic! Don't you ever want to stab uncle with
a stiletto or something?"</p>

<p>She laughed, but Frank's smile was a trifle grim. He had too
vivid a recollection of somebody striking at him with a stiletto
to derive the full amount of amusement out of the question. That
was part of the story which he had not deemed it necessary to
tell.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," drawled Vera, "I never feel sufficiently
bloodthirsty."</p>

<p>Suddenly Frank's face went drawn and grey. He stepped back
with a little cry.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Marjorie, in alarm.</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>"But really&mdash;aren't you ill?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, it's a little passing giddiness," he muttered. He was
seized with an over-powering anxiety to get away.</p>

<p>"I forgot," said the girl, sympathetically, "you've had such
a trying night. I'll see if your room is ready; perhaps if you
were to lie down for an hour or two you would be better."</p>

<p>He nodded, and, raising his head, met Vera's curious
eyes.</p>

<p>"If you will forgive the impertinence," he said, slowly,
"that is a curious ring of yours."</p>

<p>She turned white and put her hands quickly behind her back;
but too late&mdash;he had seen the square black opal&mdash;for
the second time in twenty-four hours.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; COUNT FESTINI</h2>

<p class="first">"WHY, Miss Meagh, how perfectly
delightful!"</p>

<p>Marjorie turned with a start. She was leaving Victoria
Station, and had stopped at a bookstall to buy a few
magazines.</p>

<p>She had been visiting Ida Mansingham, the wife of the
convict, who was in a nursing home. She had had a bad nervous
breakdown, and it was due to the generosity of George Hilary and
Tillizini that she had been placed in comfort.</p>

<p>A young man was standing before her, his white teeth showing
in a smile of sheer delight.</p>

<p>"How extraordinary! I have not seen you for two months. Where
have you been hiding?"</p>

<p>She offered her hand with some embarrassment. Her last
parting with Count Festini had been such that it seemed that
they could never meet again on terms of commonplace friendship.
His passionate declaration still rang in her ears. He had come
to Ireland for the hunting, had fallen&mdash;so he
declared&mdash;hopelessly in love with her, and had declared his
passion.</p>

<p>He had stormed and raved when she had gently refused him;
yes, this well-bred and perfectly-mannered young man had behaved
more like a madman than a sane product of twentieth century
civilization.</p>

<p>And here he was as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"I tried to find where you were," he said.</p>

<p>His eyes had the tender softness of the South. His voice was
without any trace of foreign accent. He was, as usual, she
observed, faultlessly dressed, with none of the ostentation or
errors in taste which so often in the foreigner mar the good
tailor's best efforts.</p>

<p>"I have been away in the country," she said, a little
hurriedly.</p>

<p>She was expecting Frank at the station. He might come up at
any moment. She wondered what would be the effect on this
volcanic young man if she introduced the big Englishman as her
fiancé.</p>

<p>"And I have been tied to town," he said. "Oh, what a
deplorable place London is for those whose business keeps them
there! It is delightful to the visitor, to the dilettante, but
for the unfortunate dweller by compulsion, terrible."</p>

<p>He threw out his hands in mock despair.</p>

<p>"London is a bad habit," he went on, "and the ideal one, for
it is a bad habit one can get away from when one likes."</p>

<p>"Few bad habits are like that," she smiled.</p>

<p>He had apparently completely recovered from his infatuation
and was genial only to a point of correctness.</p>

<p>Some thought occurred to her, and she smiled.</p>

<p>"Do I amuse you?" he said, with a twinkle in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," she said, "how curious it is that I seem to
have met nothing but Italians&mdash;to have lived almost in an
atmosphere of Renaissance the last few days."</p>

<p>His eyes steadied.</p>

<p>"That is very curious," he said, quietly. "I could have
almost said the same. And who are the Italians who have been
favoured by association with the most lovely lady in
England?"</p>

<p>She raised her hand.</p>

<p>"Please," she said, softly, "let us forget."</p>

<p>"I could never forget," he said.</p>

<p>He spoke calmly enough for her ease and comfort.</p>

<p>"But I have agreed myself to forego hope. After all," his
shoulders rose imperceptibly, "one cannot have all the things
one wants in this world. I have most of them, yet one which is
more than all the others together, is denied me. That is my
punishment."</p>

<p>He smiled again. "But you did not answer me."</p>

<p>She hesitated. She had no wish to talk of Tillizini. He was
one of those mysterious individuals engaged in a business of
such a character that it seemed that any reference to him would
be a betrayal. She saw the absurdity of this view almost as
quickly as she formulated the idea.</p>

<p>"One of them," she said, "was Professor Tillizini."</p>

<p>His cigarette was half way to his mouth. He checked its
course for the fraction of a second.</p>

<p>"Signor Tillizini," he drawled. "How very interesting. And
what had the great Antonio to tell you? Did he ask for your
finger-prints, or take a sample of your blood, or express any
desire to measure your head?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, with a laugh. "He didn't do anything so
dreadful. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Slightly," he said, carelessly. "Everybody in Italy, of
course, knows Tillizini, and I should imagine almost everybody
in England is similarly informed. And where did you meet this
great man?" he bantered.</p>

<p>"At Burboro'," she said. "He came to visit my uncle."</p>

<p>"At Burboro'?"</p>

<p>Again she noticed the slight emphasis to his words.</p>

<p>He was looking at her steadily, speculatively, she thought.
He was quick to realize that his attitude was a little more than
disinterested, for he gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"You think I am inquisitive, do you not?" he said. "But don't
you know that everything associated with you has immense
interest for me? You see," he said, apologetically, "I have
never met your uncle. I didn't know that you had such a
relative&mdash; though most people have. At any rate, I have
discovered where you are staying," he said, with laughing
menace. "I have only to run to ground this uncle of yours, and
the rest will be easy. I shall come to Burboro'," he threatened,
with one slim finger raised in mock earnestness, and go round
asking 'Has anybody seen Miss Marjorie's uncle?' It will create
a little sensation, will it not?"</p>

<p>"I will save you that trouble," she smiled. "My uncle is Sir
Ralph Morte-Mannery."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," he nodded his head. "I thought it might
be."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, he is a great man; one hears of him. He is a
judge; and something of a collector, too."</p>

<p>She had seen a tall form walking towards them, and went pink
again.</p>

<p>"I want to introduce you, Count Festini," she said, "to my
fiancé, Mr. Frank Gallinford."</p>

<p>She averted her eyes from his face, and did not see the
sudden tightening of his lips, nor the curious, quick droop of
his eyelids.</p>

<p>"This is Count Festini," she said.</p>

<p>The big Englishman put out his hand, and grasped the other's
heartily. He was almost head and shoulders above the dapper
young man, but, to Frank's surprise, it was no soft, effeminate
grasp which was returned. It was a grip which reminded him of
the vice-like grip of Tillizini's.</p>

<p>Frank was a typical Englishman&mdash;tall, broad-shouldered,
lean of face and limb; grey, honest eyes shone with pleasure to
meet a friend of his beloved.</p>

<p>"I wish you would bring us just a handful of your beautiful
Italian sunshine, Count," he said. "In this city of gloom, and
depression, and inquests&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inquests?" interrupted Marjorie.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, on that unfortunate man who was murdered. I have got to
give evidence to-day."</p>

<p>"Which man is this?" asked the Count, interested.</p>

<p>"The man who was found in the Embankment Gardens."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>It was only an ejaculation, but Frank looked at him in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you know him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I only know what I have read in the papers," said the other,
calmly. "May I ask, Mr. Gallinford, exactly what part you played
in that tragedy?"</p>

<p>"I was the man that was with him when he was kidnapped," said
he. "I have felt awful ever since. If I could only have kept
with him I might have saved his life."</p>

<p>"Or lost your own," said the Count. "These people are not
particular to a life or two. You have lived long enough in my
country to realize that we do not place the exaggerated value
upon human life that you Northerners do."</p>

<p>"You cannot have an exaggerated value on human life," said
Frank, gravely. "It is the most precious thing in the
world."</p>

<p>The Count shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That is a point of view," he said. "It is not mine. For my
part I regard life as the least valuable of our possessions. It
is a huge gramophone record on which all the strident and
unpleasant sounds of life are received and held at one and the
same time. And the whole makes a tremendous discord," he said,
speaking half to himself. "The music of life is drowned,
overwhelmed, deadened by the harsher notes of strife and
ambition. For me," he smiled, "I think that the clean record is
best."</p>

<p>"What is the 'clean record'?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Sleep," said the other, a little bitterly, "or death. It is
one and the same."</p>

<p>He offered his hand with a charming smile.</p>

<p>"I am keeping you both," he said. "Where may I have the
pleasure of seeing you again, Miss Meagh?"</p>

<p>"I shall be staying with my uncle for another month," she
said.</p>

<p>He nodded pleasantly to Frank, and, turning, walked quickly
away. He stopped at a little cigarette kiosk on the station, and
watching them out of the corners of his eyes, he saw that they
were passing slowly from the station. He turned, when they had
disappeared through one of the exits. His face had no longer
that pleasant, soft quality which had distinguished it a few
minutes before. It was hard and set, and his eyes glowed
angrily. He stood watching the exit through which they had
disappeared, then he went to a telephone box. From this he
emerged in five minutes, collected, suave and cheerful.</p>

<p>It was Thursday, the night before the attempt would be made.
If the locket was not abstracted, he thought he knew a way by
which it might be attained&mdash;and it was a pleasant way to
him. The only fear he had in his mind was whether he would
resist the temptation which would arise in the experiment.
Whether his love of gain would over-master the growing passion
which fired his breast for this cold, beautiful
Englishwoman.</p>

<p>He had learnt enough now to know that the second locket was
in the possession of Tillizini. It was a house which, under
ordinary circumstances, might be burgled; but now it was
Tillizini's. The name inspired awe amongst the lawless men who
were working for their illicit profits.</p>

<p>Before now the very sight of this professor's thin, refined
face had stayed the assassin's dagger, from very fright. The
very mention of Tillizini was sufficient to cause a stir of
uneasiness amongst these villains, in whom the dictates of fear
and pity were dead.</p>

<p>But the name had no such effect upon Count Festini. He was
superior to fear of any man. He came from a line of men who, for
hundreds of years, had dominated one secret society or the
other. The Festinis went back to the bad old days of Italian
history, when assassination was a quick and easy method of
ridding members of his family from embarrassment.</p>

<p>It was in his blood. It was part of his composition. Young as
he was, he had been the directing force of the terrorizing
organization which had worked the Eastern States of America into
a ferment of terror.</p>

<p>Tillizini, swift and terrible in his working, wise in his
judgment, had broken that organization.</p>

<p>Festini was no fool. He had recognized that the game was up
in America. There was no use in running his head against a brick
wall. He had foreseen the possibility of transplanting the
strength of his government to England. They were a soft people,
used to crime of a certain type, crime which was generally
without violence. It was the last stand of the "Red Hand." Its
members had been driven from every country in Europe. It was
only a matter of time when lethargic England would drive and
stamp the organization out of existence.</p>

<p>But, in that short space of time, Festini was preparing his
coup&mdash;the greatest and most terrible of his wicked plans.
He would strike, not individuals, for that was too
dangerous&mdash;he would blackmail the nation, but first he must
obtain possession of those lockets.</p>

<p>He sprang into a cab outside the station, and drove to a
little street in Soho. It was a tiny restaurant where he knew he
would find Il Bue. There was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>The man he sought had not arrived, and the Count sat down and
waited, ordering a plate of soup from the obsequious
head-waiter.</p>

<p>The big man came in shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>"Talk in English as much as you can," said Festini.</p>

<p>"The man is a brother," replied the other.</p>

<p>"That does not matter," said the Count. "Talk in English, if
you please. You have sent your men to Burboro'?"</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"You have followed my instructions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, fair one. The men I have sent looked like Englishmen.
They are the best we can get."</p>

<p>"Trustworthy?"</p>

<p>The other nodded, and smiled crookedly.</p>

<p>"As trustworthy as men could be who are up to their eyes...."
He gave a significant little gesture, and Festini smiled a
little.</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall have any difficulty," he said. "When
you get the locket, bring it straight to me. You will be at the
station to receive them. Take it from their hands; do not leave
the station until you have it in your hand. I shall be waiting
for you at Deptford. Now, what of Tillizini?"</p>

<p>A look of fear came into the big man's eyes.</p>

<p>"Tillizini?" he said, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, impatiently. "What do you fear? He is
only a man, my Ox. One of the lockets is in his possession. It
is in that big room of his that overlooks the Thames Embankment.
Now, can that be secured?"</p>

<p>The big Italian shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Signor," he said, earnestly, "it cannot be done. There is
not one of our men who would dare to. You know he is no
man&mdash;this Tillizini&mdash;he is a devil. Remember Beppo
Ferosti! Only the other night, killed on the stairs, by a man
who heard all we said. And we none the wiser! It is not
possible, Signor, to trap this man. We have tried.</p>

<p>"Did we not try in New York?" he went on, vehemently. "We
bribed the waiter of his hotel, we drugged him, we went to his
room at night and dragged him out of bed, wrapped him in a sheet
and threw him down the elevator shaft. Signor, he dropped eight
stories," he said, impressively, "and when we went later to see
him at the bottom, it was not him at all. It was poor Antonio
Barricci&mdash;the man who had been in charge of all the
arrangements&mdash;who had planned his death. We had not seen
his face in the dark, because we dared not carry lights. We
simply took the drugged form from the bed and carried it to the
elevator shaft.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how we sent the man from Florence to kill
him? We never saw that man again," the big man's voice shook a
little, for the man from Florence had been his brother.
"Tillizini sent me his hand&mdash;that is all&mdash;by parcel
post! Just the hand of the man from Rome, with the rings of the
brotherhood still upon his finger. No name to identify the
sender, and the postmark 'Paris.'</p>

<p>"It cannot be done, I tell you," he said, "the man is not
human."</p>

<p>Festini was listening with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"He is sufficiently human, my friend," he said, softly, "only
he is more clever than the men who have been pitted against him.
Now I propose, myself, to arrange matters with Signor Tillizini.
I have tried every one of our agents, and they have all failed.
I must take up my share of the work. Here is a dangerous enemy,
who may spoil our plans. To-night, whilst our friends are
reconnoitring the ground at Burboro', I myself will work
independently."</p>

<p>"Shall I come with you?" asked the other, eagerly. "Signor, I
would give my life for you."</p>

<p>He spoke with sincerity. There was no questioning the honesty
of the dog-like faithfulness of this big man.</p>

<p>Again Festini smiled.</p>

<p>"I will work alone, my good friend," he said, and tapped the
other on the shoulder with his white hand, approvingly. "These
things must be done with subtlety if they are to succeed."</p>

<p>He rested his head upon his hands for a few minutes, deep in
thought. The other waited patiently, his deep-set eyes filled
with love and admiration for the master whose house he had
served all his life.</p>

<p>"There is a man," said Festini, suddenly, "who is a sort of
agent of this Tillizini. Now, you shall go to him and kill
him."</p>

<p>He spoke as though it were a very ordinary transaction which
he had asked the other to undertake.</p>

<p>Il Bue nodded.</p>

<p>"It will be simple," he said. "I can do it to-night."</p>

<p>Festini was still thinking.</p>

<p>"No," he said, after a while, "do not kill him. Take him away
to the house by the river. You know where I mean?"</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"When you have got him safe, send a letter to Tillizini
saying that you have him, and demanding a ransom&mdash;say of
£500, and leave the rest to me."</p>

<p>The big man rose.</p>

<p>"I will see about this at once, Signor," he said. "God
prosper you."</p>

<p>With which commendation he left the restaurant.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; A WAY OF
TILLIZINI'S</h2>

<p class="first">TILLIZINI was sitting in his room, examining a
number of photographs that he had received that morning from
Florence, when the note came to him.</p>

<p>He opened and read it.</p>

<p>It was brief and to the point.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"We have taken your spy. You will give us five
hundred English pounds, and he shall be released. By Order of
<span class="smcap">The Red Hand</span>."</p>

<br>

<p>He folded it carefully.</p>

<p>"Is the messenger still waiting?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the servant, "it was a boy who handed it
in."</p>

<p>Tillizini examined the note again, and smiled. He rose from
the table and went to the telephone which stood on a small
bracket near the wall. He gave a Treasury number which is not in
the telephone book, it is only to be found in the small volume
issued to Cabinet Ministers and to public officials, and in a
few seconds he was connected with Inspector Crocks.</p>

<p>"They have taken my man," he said; "at least they say they
have, and I suppose they are speaking the truth. They demand
£500 for his immediate release."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the inspector's voice.</p>

<p>"I'm going to release him," said the other, "though I have my
doubts as to whether they really want the money."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were driving to Smith's lodgings. The
landlady gave him all the information he required, and another
hour's search revealed the place where his man had been
captured. As he thought, it was on the wharf from whence he
usually set his make-believe flash-signals. There were signs of
a little struggle. Some children, playing in the dark street
from which the wharf was gained, had seen four men, very drunk
as they thought, staggering to a waiting motor-car.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">There is a little club in Soho where men, with
certain political views, may be found between the hours of
eleven at night and five in the morning.</p>

<p>At a quarter to twelve the stout man Pietro, who had formed
the third at the Deptford conference, entered the club and,
after a fruitless inspection of its members, came out again.</p>

<p>He walked through Soho, crossed Oxford Street, and entered
one of the slummy thoroughfares which abound in the
neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>He let himself into a gloomy house with a key, and closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p>His room was on the ground floor. He unlocked the door, went
in, and again closed and locked it before he struck a match.</p>

<p>His hands were fumbling with a match-box when there was a
quick, blinding flash, and he found himself standing in a circle
of light thrown by an electric light.</p>

<p>"Don't move," said a voice, "or I will kill you."</p>

<p>The intruder spoke in Italian.</p>

<p>"You may light the gas," said the unknown.</p>

<p>The circle of light followed the alarmed man, as he moved to
the centre of the room, reached up and ignited an incandescent
burner.</p>

<p>"Tillizini!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"It is I," said the other easily. "Your doors are
shut&mdash;yes. Your windows are shuttered, of course. Sit
down."</p>

<p>Shaking in every limb, the man obeyed. The revolver in the
professor's hand was an excellent excuse for obedience.</p>

<p>"Where have you been to-night?"</p>

<p>"That is no business of yours," growled the other. "You have
no right to come into my room. What have you stolen?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," said Tillizini, calmly. "Stand up again,
put your hands above your head. Thank you, Signor."</p>

<p>His deft fingers searched the other, removed a revolver from
the hip-pocket and a knife from inside the waistband of his
trousers. These he laid on the table, first jerking open the
chamber of the revolver scientifically. There was a little
clatter of cartridges as they fell on the floor.</p>

<p>"Now I want your hand," he said. "Hold it out."</p>

<p>Hesitatingly, the other man obeyed, his fearful eyes fixed
upon the calm face of the other.</p>

<p>Tillizini leant over and raised the hand to his face. His
sensitive nostrils dilated. He had no difficulty in detecting
the scent of the attar of roses with which his spy's papers had
been impregnated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you are the man I want."</p>

<p>The fear deepened in the stout man's eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he gasped.</p>

<p>He had a superstitious dread of this undefeatable man. With
the ignorance of his kind he had endowed him with powers which
were almost supernatural.</p>

<p>"I want the man you helped to kidnap to-night, or if you did
not help to kidnap, assisted in searching," said the Italian,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"It's a lie," said the other. "I know nothing about a
kidnapped man."</p>

<p>"The man you searched to-night," continued Tillizini,
unemotionally, "whose pockets you ransacked, whose papers you
examined. Where is he?"</p>

<p>The look of fear in the man's face was ludicrous.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I know," said Tillizini. "That is sufficient."</p>

<p>He waited for the stout man to speak, but in whatever fear he
stood of the detective, his terror of reprisal from his comrades
was a greater factor.</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing&mdash;nothing," he said,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then you shall come a little journey with me," said
Tillizini. "We will leave the light, if you don't mind. Get
up."</p>

<p>He went to the door and, standing with his back against it,
unlocked it.</p>

<p>"You will go first," he said.</p>

<p>Outside the street was deserted, save for a number of
children who were playing noisily in the roadway.</p>

<p>"To the right," said Tillizini, curtly.</p>

<p>The man obeyed.</p>

<p>Drawn up by the opposite side of the pavement a little way
along was a pair-horse brougham. Opposite this Pietro waited
till Tillizini's voice stopped him.</p>

<p>"Get in."</p>

<p>Again the man obeyed and Tillizini followed. He closed the
door, and the prisoner noted that he gave no instructions as to
where the man was to drive. Evidently that had already been
arranged. His wonder was dissipated when he found the carriage
driving along the Thames Embankment. He was going to Tillizini's
house. He pulled himself together. He was half losing his nerve.
After all, Tillizini could not torture him here, in the heart of
London, and he a Government official.</p>

<p>It was to Adelphi Terrace that the carriage drove and pulled
up before the detective's house.</p>

<p>"Get out."</p>

<p>The map followed his instructions. Tillizini's ring was
instantly answered by a servant. The two men stepped into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Has anybody been?" asked the detective, in English.</p>

<p>"No, sir, except a man called with a parcel for you."</p>

<p>"A parcel?" He looked thoughtful. "A large parcel?" he asked,
idly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, a smallish parcel," replied the man. "He would not
leave it until I signed for it."</p>

<p>"I see," said the detective, "and so you left him at the hall
door whilst you went down to get a pencil?"</p>

<p>The man smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, I took the parcel from him&mdash;there it is on
the hall table. I wouldn't leave the door."</p>

<p>Tillizini's lips twitched. In the most tragic moments of his
life he could find sources of amusement. He scarcely gave the
parcel more than a passing glance. Instead, his eyes rapidly
surveyed the floor. He opened the door, and looked at the lock.
It was a patent lock with a small catch. From the slot into
which the bevelled snap caught he extracted two little threads.
He examined them briefly and kept them between the finger and
thumb of his left hand. All the time he kept his hold upon his
revolver, though the servant did not observe it.</p>

<p>"Very good, Thomas," he said, as he closed the door again,
"you may go. <i>Marchez, mon ami</i>."</p>

<p>This last was to his prisoner. Pietro obeyed. He mounted the
broad staircase to the dark landing above, and Tillizini stepped
close to his prisoner.</p>

<p>"Go through that door," he said.</p>

<p>Pietro did so.</p>

<p>He flung the door open, hesitated a moment, then stepped in.
When the Italian's hand was on the knob of the door, Tillizini
spoke. He was addressing apparently a person below.</p>

<p>"All right, Thomas," he said loudly, "you may bring up that
parcel now."</p>

<p>Then he pushed Pietro into the room. It was in complete
darkness, as he expected. The captive stood hesitating in the
doorway for a fraction of a second, Tillizini behind him,
waiting. He had only to wait for an infinitesimal space of time.
From the darkness in the room four shots rang out in rapid
succession and Pietro pitched forward on his face, a dying
man.</p>

<p>Tillizini had moved swiftly under cover of the doorway. He
offered no view of himself to his hidden enemy. He heard the
quick steps of Thomas. In the hall below were governing switches
by which any room in the house could be illuminated. A quick
order from Tillizini, and the lights blazed up in his room.</p>

<p>He sprang in, leaping over the twitching form of the fallen
man. The room was empty; it offered no cover to any person in
hiding. There was no need to search beyond the open window. The
man who had waited there had already prepared and carried into
effect his escape.</p>

<p>Tillizini shut down the switch and the room was in darkness
again. He flew to the window. A slender rope had been fastened
to the leg of his heavy writing table. It extended across the
room, through the open window, and now swung to and fro in the
breeze below.</p>

<p>The street was empty. There was no profit in searching
farther. He closed down the window and 'phoned the police.</p>

<p>The man on the floor was too far gone for help. He was dying
when Tillizini reached his side. With the help of the servant
and a hastily-summoned policeman he was laid on the settee,
where a few nights before the helpless and innocent victim of
the "Red Hand's" plotting had lain.</p>

<p>Tillizini's busy hands plucked phial after phial from his
medicine chest... the man revived a little, but it was evident,
long before the police surgeon came, that he had no chance. He
looked up at Tillizini's emotionless face with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Signor," he said, in Italian, "I ought to have known
better&mdash;it was thus you trapped others. I have certain
monies at the bank"&mdash;he named the institution&mdash;"I wish
that money to go to my sister, who is a widow at Sezzori."</p>

<p>"That I will send, Pietro."</p>

<p>"You know my name," said the dying man.</p>

<p>"I know you very well," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>The man looked at him bleakly.</p>

<p>"Some day," he said, at last&mdash;his voice was growing
fainter&mdash;"they will have you, our brave 'Red Hand,' Signor,
and there will be a great killing."</p>

<p>He checked himself and looked round at the uncomprehending
policeman, who could not understand the language, and at the
servant, obviously English and agitated by the extraordinary
character of the evening.</p>

<p>Then he half whispered.</p>

<p>"There is something I wish to tell you, Signor."</p>

<p>His voice was now difficult to hear. Tillizini bent his head
to catch the words, and in that moment the dying man mustered
his last reserve of strength; by sheer effort of malignant will
he called into play all the vital forces which were left alive
within him. As Tillizini's head sank lower and lower, Pietro's
hand crept to his side.</p>

<p>"Signor," he whispered, "take that!" Quick as he was,
Tillizini was quicker. As he whipped round, his vice-like grip
held the other's wrist, and the gleaming knife fell with a
clatter to the polished floor. Then with a quick jerk he flung
the man's hand down on the settee and stood up, smiling.</p>

<p>"How like a rat, Pietro, how like a rat!" And the dying man,
unrepentant of his many villainies, of the sorrow and the
suffering he had brought to so many people, saw with the glaze
of death filming his eyes, the lips of Tillizini part in an
amused and contemptuous smile.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">An hour later Tillizini sat in the private
office of Inspector Crocks, of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"It was a narrow squeak for you," said the inspector,
admiringly.</p>

<p>"There were two," said Tillizini, dryly. "Which one do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"The first, I think, was the most serious," said the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"Now it's strange that you should say that," said Tillizini.
"I think the second was&mdash;the dagger was poisoned. I
discovered that soon after."</p>

<p>"Poisoned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with a poison that is not a particularly pleasant
one&mdash;tetanus," he said.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said the inspector, genuinely shocked. "That's
the germ of lock-jaw, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"That is it," he said, cheerfully. "A pleasant end especially
planned for me. I tell you these men are scientists in a crude
way. I knew he was upstairs waiting, the first man. An old trick
that, you've probably had it played on innocent suburban folk of
this city hundreds of times."</p>

<p>The inspector agreed with a gesture.</p>

<p>"When the amiable Thomas closed the door, our friend who
delivered the parcel quickly put up a piece of canvas paper
backed with a strong silk fabric. The door caught in the staple,
but so did the strong silk. When he considered the coast was
clear and he judged Thomas to be out of the way, he had but to
pull the projecting end&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know the trick," said the inspector. "I've seen it done a
score of times."</p>

<p>"I suspected something of the sort," said Tillizini, "but
mostly I suspected a parcel. I thought, too, that the kidnapping
of Smith was a ruse to get me out so that a warm welcome might
be prepared for me when I came back."</p>

<p>"Have you found the man?"</p>

<p>"He'll be found," said Tillizini, "by to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I've got men out now hunting for him," said Crocks. "It's
rather a difficult job, Tillizini, dealing with your
people."</p>

<p>Tillizini smiled.</p>

<p>"They are somewhat different to the average English
criminal," he said. "One of these days when you are in Florence,
Inspector, you must come to my museum and I'll show you the
skulls of typical criminals of all countries. I will explain
then to you just why our Southern men are more dangerous to
handle, and if you would be patient with me," he favoured the
policeman with his little bow, "I would then as briefly as
possible give you the basis by which you may forejudge men's
actions."</p>

<p>"In other words," said the Inspector, jovially, "you'll give
me elementary lessons in necromancy."</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," said Tillizini. He had had half an
hour with Crocks and with the Commissioner. Another crime had
been laid at the door of the "Red Hand." A worrying business for
the English police, however satisfactory it might be to
Tillizini.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and looked at his watch; it was nearly
twelve. The inspector followed his example.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to my house," he said, "will you come?"</p>

<p>"I have an hour to spare," said the other, "and I like your
room, it's rather restful. If I shan't be in the way I'll come
round and get a few particulars at first hand."</p>

<p>"Come along," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>He passed through the broad corridors of Scotland Yard, down
the stone stairway, and out by the entrance near the arch. The
policeman on duty at the door saluted him respectfully.</p>

<p>They strolled together leisurely back to the house in Adelphi
Terrace. Tillizini rang; it was an act of laziness on his part
that he did not find his key. There was no reply, and he rang
again. Then he opened the door himself and stepped in. The two
hall lights were burning, but there was no sign of Thomas.</p>

<p>Tillizini closed the door behind him. Thomas was usually to
be found in the basement. He walked to the end of the passage
and called over the stairs, but again without reply. Neatly
folded on a little dumb waiter, placed for better security
beneath a glass, was a note. Tillizini pulled it out, took it up
and read it. It explained much. It was addressed to the man,
Thomas.</p>

<br>

<p class="note"><i>"I have been arrested in connexion with
to-day's crime,"</i> it said; <i>"please bring my overcoat at once to Bow Street."</i></p>

<br>

<p>It was signed, "Antonio Tillizini."</p>

<p>Without a word he handed the wire to the English
detective.</p>

<p>"We will now go and discover things," he said, and led the
way upstairs.</p>

<p>He did not trouble to arm himself because he knew the ways of
the "Red Hand" too well to believe that any of the organization
were present. They had probably had half an hour after Thomas
had hurried away with the necessary overcoat. They would do what
they wanted to do in ten minutes.</p>

<p>He opened the door of his room and walked in without fear. He
switched on the light. The room was in confusion. There had been
a diligent and damaging search. The drawers of his desk had been
ripped open and the floor was covered with papers and splinters
of rosewood.</p>

<p>Not even the chairs and the settee had escaped attention.
They had been cut open and their stuffings pulled out. The legs
of one chair had been lopped off as by a machette. Strangely
enough, the little case of medicines, which still stood open on
his desk, had been left intact. The "Red Hand" had too great a
respect for Tillizini's knowledge of chemistry, and they had had
such illuminating lessons of his knowledge of high explosives,
that they had left this severely alone, excepting that there was
plenty of evidence that each phial had been carefully and
cautiously lifted from its velvet-lined well and examined.</p>

<p>With a quick glance at the damage done, the Italian walked
with rapid strides across the room, lifted up one corner of the
carpet and slipped back a narrow panel in the floor. It had been
cunningly constructed by Tillizini's own hand. It would be
almost impossible for anybody not in the secret to know that
such a receptacle existed. He thrust in his hand, and felt for a
little while with a grim smile, then his hand slowly withdrew.
The detective saw that he held a paper.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"For the locket, thanks," he read; "now you
shall hear from us, Tillizini."</p>

<br>

<p>The Italian said nothing. He stood in the middle of the room,
his hands clasped on his breast, his head sunk in thought.</p>

<p>"They have taken the locket," said Inspector Crocks,
aghast.</p>

<p>Tillizini did not reply.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, and Thomas, still with his
master's overcoat on his arm, entered.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir; did you&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<p>Tillizini raised his head.</p>

<p>"Thomas," he said, "I have told you under no circumstances
must you leave this house. Your failure to carry out my
instructions, however, is mainly my fault. To-morrow I will draw
you a little sign which you will see on any letter or wire I
send, and know that it comes from me."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir," said Thomas. Tillizini waved his
apologies away.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said, "all this; rather," he smiled, "I
owe you an apology. You have a little child, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Thomas, wonderingly. "You carry his portrait
in a locket, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," replied Thomas. "Why, you know I do, sir. I
brought you the locket to see the other day."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, Thomas," said Tillizini, gravely, "that I
have lost it&mdash;I hope it may be recovered. I put it in a
safe place, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing, sir," said Thomas. "I can get another. It
wasn't worth half a crown."</p>

<p>"A token of a father's love is invaluable," said Tillizini,
the corners of his lips turning up.</p>

<p>He took his revolver from his pocket, pressed a spring near
the trigger guard, and a little silver lid flew open in the
butt. He held his hand under it and shook it, and something fell
out wrapped in silver tissue. He unrolled the paper and handed
the contents to Crocks.</p>

<p>"I am almost inclined to ask you to keep this in Scotland
Yard," he said, "yet I don't think they will burgle me
again."</p>

<p>It was the medallion!</p>

<p>"As for that which they have stolen," Tillizini went on, "it
is regrettable. I feel I shall never forgive myself for losing
that charming locket of yours."</p>

<p>His voice was filled with gentle mockery, and the servant
grinned a little sheepishly, mumbling his depreciation of any
fuss at so small a loss.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all annoyed, sir," he said, awkwardly.</p>

<p>What was true of Thomas was not true of the two leaders of
the "Red Hand" who at that moment were sitting in a little room
in Deptford examining with consternation and chagrin the plump
and smiling features of a healthy child of two.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; LADY MORTE-MANNERY
HELPS A FRIEND</h2>

<p class="first">SIR RALPH MORTE-MANNERY was in an amiable mood.
He had just read a most complimentary reference to his own
perspicacity and genius in a French journal devoted to the
interests of collectors. His gaiety had affected the other
members of the little dinner party, and had tempered somewhat
the natural annoyance of the quashing of George Mansingham's
conviction.</p>

<p>That unfortunate man had been released, not because the
judges of the Appeal Court thought that his sentence was
excessive, but because, in summing up, Sir Ralph had outraged
most of the canons of good taste which it is possible for a
judge to outrage.</p>

<p>In giving judgment their lordships had said many bitter
things about Sir Ralph; indeed, so unkind had been some of their
comments, that Hilary George, listening with that air of
delighted wonder which was his normal attitude toward life, had
felt a sinking of his heart as he thought of the humiliation
which by his efforts he had brought upon his sometime
friend.</p>

<p>Hilary was too good a man and too good a sportsman to exult
in his victory. He was a strong man, too. None but a strong man
would have taken the first train to Burboro' and carried the
news of the result to a man who would consider himself as being
almost within his legal rights in slaying the messenger.</p>

<p>There had been a stiff little meeting in the library; later,
something like a reconciliation. Hilary, in terms which his old
friendship permitted, gave the result of the finding, toning
down the more vigorous of the judges' remarks, and inwardly
praying that The Times, in its record of the case, would
sub-edit it as mercifully.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph had been prepared for some such upset. He himself
was an excellent lawyer where his prejudices did not interfere
with his judgment. The lawyer in him had told him that his
sentence had been excessive, just as the collector in him
demanded as emphatically that the man should have been hung. But
Hilary, with his baby face and his babbling humour, and his
readiness to laugh at jokes against himself, had broken down the
reserve of the older man, and had been invited to stay on.</p>

<p>Over the dinner-table Sir Ralph even drank his health in
facetious terms. The host's humour was not of a great quality.
But it was quite sufficient, as indeed it is in the case of all
men whose flashes of humour are few and far between. He insisted
on referring to Hilary as the "enemy" or "my oppressor," and it
gave him considerable amusement to do so.</p>

<p>"Now, Hilary," he said, with heavy jocularity, "you must give
us all the news of the best criminal circles. What are the 'Red
Hand' doing? Really, they are killing as many people as the
motor-buses."</p>

<p>"Those people who know best," said Hilary, gravely, "are
viewing the inactivity of the 'Red Hand' with some apprehension.
I happen to know the Government is rather worried about it.
These men are brilliantly organized, and they will stop at
nothing."</p>

<p>"Has anybody discovered," asked Marjorie, "why they are
rifling the collections? There was an article in the <i>Post
Herald</i> about it the other day."</p>

<p>Hilary shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I can understand it," he said, "there's
something behind it. I don't want to bother you, Ralph," he went
on, "but doesn't it ever strike you, as a lawyer and as a man of
keen perceptions, that there really might have been some 'Red
Hand' move behind that burglary of yours?"</p>

<p>Sir Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think it was likely; of course, it might be so,"
he conceded graciously, though in his heart of hearts he was
perfectly satisfied that it was nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>"Their latest exploit," said Hilary, "was to kidnap one of
Tillizini's agents. The man was taken away overnight and turned
up whole and hearty in the morning. For some reason they'd given
an order for his release, being, I think, under the impression
that they'd killed Tillizini and there was no necessity to
retain his agent. The man could give very little account of his
movements, except that he had been more or less stupefied by the
administration of a drug which somewhat dulled his powers of
recollection. He was unable to assist the police in locating the
house where he had been taken. He was found in a dazed condition
sitting on one of the seats on London Bridge in the early hours
of the morning, and has been in a more or less semi-conscious
condition ever since."</p>

<p>"That's very interesting." Frank, who was seated next to
Marjorie, leant across the table. "I've seen men like that in
Italy; it's a sort of opium preparation that some of the
peasants take. There is a slang term for it in Italian, an
abbreviation of <i>non mi ricordo</i>."</p>

<p>"He remembers nothing, any way," said Hilary,
"except&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"Except what?" asked Vera.</p>

<p>She had been a silent listener to the conversation. She was
looking very beautiful to-night, Hilary thought. She wore a
dress of grey chiffon velvet, one big pink rose in her
corsage.</p>

<p>"I forget now," said Hilary. He remembered that he had
received his information in confidence and that he himself might
be associated in the case at a later period.</p>

<p>"By the way," he went on, "I saw you in town the other
day."</p>

<p>Vera raised her delicate eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Really," she drawled, "that was awfully clever of you. Where
was I?"</p>

<p>"You were in Oxford Street," said Hilary. "That was an
awfully swagger motor-car you were driving in; was it
Festini's?"</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"Festini?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw you with Festini," he said hastily.</p>

<p>For a man with such a wide knowledge of human creatures and,
moreover, so versed in the ways of society, he seemed to be
making an unusual number of <i>faux pas</i>.</p>

<p>"I do not know Festini," she said, "if you mean Count
Festini, whose name one sees through the medium of the public
press as moving in exalted circles; nor have I ever been in a
motor-car in Oxford Street since I drove with Sir Ralph to
Buzzard's last Christmas."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," murmured the barrister.</p>

<p>Vera changed the subject with an easy grace. She was a
perfect hostess, though she required all her self-control to
prevent her showing the anger she felt.</p>

<p>"Go on telling us something about the 'Red Hand'," she said.
"What is this immense coup one hears about? I am awfully keen to
know."</p>

<p>"Nobody seems to have any information on that subject," said
Hilary, "not even Tillizini."</p>

<p>"Not even Tillizini?" she repeated in mock amazement.</p>

<p>"Not even Tillizini," repeated Hilary. "He seems to be as
much in the dark as any of us."</p>

<p>"People are getting a little jumpy," said Sir Ralph, as, at a
signal from Vera, the two women rose from the table. "There was
another article in this morning's paper. I know the journalists
who are generally behind the scenes in these things expect
something pretty big to happen. The police are guarding all the
public buildings, and every Cabinet Minister is being shadowed
with as much care as though the 'Red Hand' was a suffragist
organization."</p>

<p>The party laughed politely at Sir Ralph's little gibe.</p>

<p>"I can confirm that," said Frank, as he selected a cigar from
the box which Marjorie offered him. "The various corporations
responsible for their safety have asked a number of engineers to
make an inspection of the bridges."</p>

<p>"Across the Thames?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "There's a water-guard every night for these," he
said; "all the signs are pretty ominous."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph and Hilary strolled away. They were both interested
in the collection, and Vera joined the other two.</p>

<p>"I am not going to stay long with you," she smiled; "don't
look so alarmed, Mr. Gallinford."</p>

<p>She was genuine in her desire to propitiate him. His attitude
towards her was a little strange and stiff. If she knew the
reason, she gave no indication. In a way, he amused her. He was
so open and so English. She experienced the resentment of her
remote ancestry stirring within her at his dogged, unwavering
honesty. Her attitude to the distress of Marjorie was at once
polite and antagonistic. She, Marjorie, had remonstrated with
him without effect. With all her pride in her lover, she desired
that he should stand well with others and should inspire in them
the same admiration which she herself felt for him.</p>

<p>Vera's attempt at conciliation on this occasion was crowned
with no greater success than her previous effort. After a while
she yawned slightly behind her hand. She apologized
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Do not think you poor people are boring me," she said, "but
I've had some rather trying nights lately. Where are you going?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I am going into the billiard-room to play Marjorie a hundred
up," said Frank, with an heroic attempt to be genial.</p>

<p>Vera nodded.</p>

<p>"And I've got my accounts to bring up to date."</p>

<p>She made a wry little face. "Pity me," she demanded, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, dear?" asked Marjorie.</p>

<p>Vera shook her head.</p>

<p>"Accounts," she said, with thinly-veiled acrimony, "are
mysteries into which I trust your future husband will never
initiate you."</p>

<p>With a nod she passed out of the room. She returned a few
minutes later as though she had left something behind, and found
the room empty. She made her way to the billiard-room; the game
had just started, so they were settled for at least half an
hour.</p>

<p>She looked at the jewelled watch on her wrist; it wanted five
minutes to ten. She came back to the hall and went up the stairs
slowly, and as slowly walked past the museum. The iron door was
closed, but its rosewood covering stood ajar. Ralph was engaged
in an argument on the respective values of Renaissance artists
which would last for at least an hour. She quickened her steps.
At the other end of the corridor her own room was situated.
Highlawns had been reconstructed to suit Sir Ralph's
convenience. In a sense it was convenient to her too, for she
had chosen a small room in a wing which was never fully occupied
unless Sir Ralph had an unusually large house-party.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her and locked it. It was a pretty
room, furnished with taste, though it contained little that
could by any stretch of imagination be termed valuable. Sir
Ralph had his own views on the luxury of the age, and the
simplicity, not to say the meanness, of his domestic
arrangements, was a concrete expression of his disapproval of
modern luxurious tendencies.</p>

<p>The room possessed, what is unusual in English country
houses, long French windows which opened on to a balcony. She
looked at her watch again, then drew a heavy curtain across her
door. The gas was burning dimly. The room might have been a
sitting-room but for the big white bed which stood in an alcove,
screened from view by thick silk curtains.</p>

<p>She did not trouble to turn up the light. She looked at it
for a moment in doubt, and then walked to the window. Again she
looked at the light hesitatingly, and, walking back, turned it
out. She opened the window and stepped out on to the
balcony.</p>

<p>It was a mild, pleasant night. The moon was hidden behind a
bank of clouds, but there was sufficient light to distinguish
the more prominent objects in the big, sweet-smelling garden
below. She looked carefully left and right, and saw nothing. She
went back to her room to get a rug, and resumed her vigil. The
clock of the village church had struck ten in its lugubrious
tones when she heard a slight sound in the garden below.</p>

<p>She walked back to her room quickly, opened a cupboard, and
took out a silk ladder; there was a hook attached, and this she
fastened with deft fingers to a socket in the balcony, fixed in
the wall, ostensibly to support the sunblinds when their cover
was necessary.</p>

<p>She dropped, the ladder over. A dark form rose from the
shadow of the portico beneath and mounted the swaying cordage.
He leapt lightly over the balustrade, and stopped for a moment
to pull up the ladder after him, and to lay it on the floor of
the balcony.</p>

<p>She took his hand and led him into the room, closed the
windows, shuttered them, and pulled the velvet curtains across.
Then she lit the gas and returned to him. She laid her two hands
upon his shoulders, and looked hungrily into his face.</p>

<p>Beautiful as she was, the love which shone in her eyes
transfigured her face and intensified her loveliness.</p>

<p>"It is you!" she breathed. "Oh, thank you for coming
yourself! I was afraid that you would send one of those wretched
men of yours."</p>

<p>Festini smiled kindly. He patted her cheek caressingly.</p>

<p>"I had to come," he said, "though it is not long since I saw
you."</p>

<p>"It is two days," she said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"So it is," he smiled. "You got my letter?"</p>

<p>For answer she took a crumpled envelope from her breast.</p>

<p>"You ought to burn that," he said, half seriously. "It is a
very dangerous thing to keep letters, even though they are
apparently innocent.</p>

<p>"You have come alone?" she asked.</p>

<p>He inclined his head. The hand that rested in his was
shaking, but not from fear.</p>

<p>"I have missed you so. I hate this place," she said,
vehemently. "It is a prison to me. It eats out my
heart&mdash;this life. Festini," she said, and again her two
hands were laid on his shoulder, and her face searched his, "you
cannot understand what an existence this is."</p>

<p>"It is only for a little while, my child," he said.</p>

<p>She was older than he, but his paternal manner was
perfect.</p>

<p>"Later we will go away, and leave this dull land for a more
pleasant one. Leave these grey skies, for the blue of our Italy,
and these drab, drizzling fields for the sun-washed vineyards of
our own land."</p>

<p>He kissed her lightly again. He was anxious to get to
business. None knew the relations of these two, for Festini kept
his secret well. Even in the innermost council of his
association, he spoke of her as though she were the veriest
stranger.</p>

<p>"I want to go somewhere," she said, moodily, "out of this! I
planned to see you in Ireland last year, and at the last moment
Ralph would not let me go."</p>

<p>She turned suddenly to him.</p>

<p>"You must have met Marjorie there."</p>

<p>"Marjorie?" he said, innocently.</p>

<p>"We were going together," she went on, "and when I found she
had to go alone&mdash;after all my planning&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head with a sad little smile. "I dared not send
a letter by her, or give you an excuse for falling in love with
her," she rallied him.</p>

<p>"I don't remember her. What was she like?" said Festini,
calmly.</p>

<p>"She remembered you," said Vera. "She maddened me by her
chatter of you. I am happy to say that she did not like you very
much."</p>

<p>Festini smiled.</p>

<p>"So few people do," he said.</p>

<p>He slipped off his overcoat.</p>

<p>"We are perfectly safe from interruption here?" he asked.</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"There is no danger whatever."</p>

<p>"Now then," he said, briskly, "let us talk for quite five
minutes, dear."</p>

<p>They sat head to head, talking. Five minutes became ten. The
young man spoke quickly, vehemently; and she answered in
monosyllables. It was nothing to her that he asked so much. She
would have sacrificed more than her husband's possessions to
please him.</p>

<p>Every law in the world, save the law of gravitation, is
suspended in the woman in love. Faith, honour, every known
principle went by the board. She had no sense of right or wrong
where he was concerned. Only a desire to serve him.</p>

<p>"You had best make the attempt between three and four," he
said. "I will be here in the garden, waiting. I have a cycle
hidden near by, and a car will be waiting for me on the London
road."</p>

<p>"I wanted to say something to you," she said suddenly. "I
hate admitting a failure, and, dearie, I tried so hard."</p>

<p>His quick intuition divined her meaning. "Oh, the money," he
said, lightly. "Don't let that bother you. I managed to get
some. We've been out of luck lately. This infernal man,
Tillizini, has dammed our usual sources. We had a windfall last
week, and in a month's time," he said, and she saw the soft
light die from the eyes and the delicate mouth harden in one
straight line, "in a month's time!" he repeated, "we shall be
very rich. And England will be very sore."</p>

<p>With lightning change he brightened again, and was his own
insouciant self.</p>

<p>"Don't let the money worry you. We have quite a lot now," he
said. "I, somehow, didn't fancy you'd be able to raise the five
hundred."</p>

<p>He rose to go and she assisted him with his coat.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, "that niece of yours&mdash;what did
you say her name was?"</p>

<p>"Marjorie."</p>

<p>"That is the name," he nodded. "I seem to remember her. Where
is she now?" He put the question carelessly.</p>

<p>"She's in the house," replied Vera.</p>

<p>"What a curious coincidence!" he smiled. "She doesn't speak
about me nowadays, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>Vera shook her head. It had occurred to the young man that
the girl might have referred to their meeting at Victoria.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, how stupid of me!" he said, suddenly. "I saw
her the other day&mdash;on some station&mdash;I remember her
now. A tall, healthy-looking, robust person."</p>

<p>His description was not flattering to Marjorie, but it was
eminently pleasing to the woman, who was jealous of every other
interest he had in life.</p>

<p>"That is not kind," she smiled, "but I think it more or less
describes her."</p>

<p>"She was with a tall man, I remember."</p>

<p>"He is in the house too," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He is in the house too," he repeated, and his voice was
hard.</p>

<p>She thought he was tired, and moved to the window. Her hand
was on the curtain. She stood waiting, then, with a little sigh,
she nestled close to him.</p>

<p>"I want you so," she breathed. "My God, I do so want you! You
don't know what it means&mdash;what I feel...."</p>

<p>He laughed, a gentle, tolerant laugh.</p>

<p>He held out his arms, for a second she lay on his breast, her
heart beating wildly&mdash;perfectly and divinely happy.</p>

<p>"I must go now," he said, gently. "I am afraid of being
caught."</p>

<p>With some reluctance she opened the window. He stood for a
moment on the balcony, reconnoitring the position.</p>

<p>The coast was clear. In a second he was over the balustrade,
and had slipped noiselessly to the ground.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE SECOND
MEDALLION</h2>

<p class="first">SHE waited till he disappeared in the shadow of
the garden; then pulled up the ladder and placed it in a drawer
within the wardrobe, from whence she had extracted it, and
closed the windows.</p>

<p>He had left very definite instructions, and she went over
them in her mind to make absolutely sure.</p>

<p>The medallion she knew. She had prepared a drawing especially
for this man whose influence was the guiding and dominant thing
in her life.</p>

<p>She looked round carefully to remove all trace of the
visitor's presence. Then she unlocked the door and went out.</p>

<p>As she passed the little museum, Sir Ralph and his guest
emerged. He looked at her in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Hello, Vera," he said pleasantly, for him, "I thought you
were with the others."</p>

<p>"I've been doing my accounts," she said, with a little
grimace.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph chuckled. In his more pleasant moods he took a
humorous view of his own economies.</p>

<p>He was fastening the door of the museum, when Vera
intervened.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see those medallions of yours again," she
said.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was pleased. Vera took too little interest in his
collection to satisfy him. It was one of his grievances that she
did not enter into what he termed the "larger side of his
life."</p>

<p>"Come along, come along," he said, "only do not provoke
Hilary to a discussion on art, because he is the veriest
Philistine."</p>

<p>He chuckled again.</p>

<p>The museum was the one room in the house lighted by
electricity. Here once more Sir Ralph had been guilty of an
extravagance which was entirely foreign to his nature. He had
had a storage battery installed especially for the illumination
of his treasure house.</p>

<p>The girl looked at the medallions with more than usual
interest. She had seen them before, and recently, though this
Sir Ralph did not know. She had a twofold object in asking for
this inspection. Her husband had grown nervous as a result of
the activity of the "Red Hand," and had signified his intention
of changing all the locks. She wanted to make certain that he
had not carried out his plans.</p>

<p>Her first glance reassured her. They had not been altered,
nor had he changed the position of the medallions.</p>

<p>"They are very beautiful," she said.</p>

<p>In point of fact she thought them very uninteresting, but it
was not politic to express this view.</p>

<p>"They grow on you, do they not?" said Sir Ralph,
enthusiastically. "I shall make a connoisseur of you in time,
Vera."</p>

<p>She went downstairs ahead of the two men, in a thoughtful
mood.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when the little party broke up, and
retired to their rooms.</p>

<p>Frank was one of the last to go upstairs. He passed through
the drawing-room, and found Vera tidying away the chessmen with
which Sir Ralph and Hilary had been amusing themselves.</p>

<p>He would have gone straight on, but something induced him to
stop.</p>

<p>"Good night, Lady Morte-Mannery," he said.</p>

<p>She was bending over the table and did not trouble to raise
her head.</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Gallinford," she said.</p>

<p>He still waited.</p>

<p>"I feel that I ought to explain something that is in my
mind," he said, a trifle uncomfortably. He had no great command
of language, and was somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't, if I were you," she said, quietly. "Let matters
go as they are, and be charitable."</p>

<p>She was in a melting mood to-night. For no reason that she
could think of, she felt a desire to stand well with the world,
and especially with that section of the world which this
good-looking English youth represented.</p>

<p>"There is a key-word," she said, "which explains the most
contradictory situations&mdash;the most unlikely and unthinkable
follies. You may know that key-word."</p>

<p>"I only know one," he said, gently, "and that is 'Love.'"</p>

<p>Vera smiled at him. It was a dazzling, human smile, that
revealed in a flash the deeps of her nature.</p>

<p>"That is the word," she said, and went on with her
tidying.</p>

<p>He stood a second longer; then, with another "Good night" he
left her, puzzled and a little ashamed of his own attitude
towards her.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs Marjorie was waiting to say
"Goodnight," and in a moment all thought of the woman he had
left in the drawing-room below, and her cryptic utterances, were
obliterated from his mind.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Vera had been reading before her bedroom fire.
She had spent the whole of the night reading and thinking. The
reading had been mechanical; she could not recall a single
sentence or one situation from the thrilling novel which lay
upon her knee.</p>

<p>She looked up at the little clock over the mantelpiece. The
hands pointed to a quarter to four.</p>

<p>She rose and took from a hanging cupboard a long dark
raincoat, and this she put on over her dressing-gown, buttoning it
carefully so that it should not inconvenience her movements.</p>

<p>She unlocked and opened a drawer of her writing-table and
took out a red morocco case.</p>

<p>This she again unlocked with a key attached to a bunch she
had taken from under her pillow. The case was apparently empty,
but she pressed a spring and the bottom of the box flew up.</p>

<p>Three beautifully fashioned keys lay on the velvet in the
false bottom. She took them in her hand, closed the box, and
extinguished the light.</p>

<p>She waited by the door for a moment or two, listening. Then
she opened it and stepped out into the dark corridor.</p>

<p>She had twenty or thirty yards to walk, but her mocassined
feet made no sound upon the thick carpet. The house lay wrapped
in slumber, as silent as death.</p>

<p>She could hear nothing save the rattle within the wainscot of
a foraging mouse. She walked on until she came to the museum.
Here she halted again, listening.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph slept in a room on the farther side and,
fortunately, was a heavy sleeper. Hilary had the room on the
other.</p>

<p>She inserted the key, opened the rosewood door, took the
other key and turned it in the steel door.</p>

<p>Noiselessly the well-oiled lock shot back. She pushed the
door open and entered, closing both doors behind her. She could
not lock them from the inside, but there was no chance of a
casual passer observing that it had been opened&mdash;even if
casual wanderers were likely at this hour of the morning.</p>

<p>She took from the pocket of her rain-coat a tiny electric
lamp, and flashed it over the cases. She found the one she
wanted, unshuttered it deftly, opened the glass case, and lifted
out the medallion.</p>

<p>She made a quick inspection of it, to make sure that she had
the right jewel.</p>

<p>Noiselessly she slipped through the door, locked it behind
her, and fastened the outer covering quickly.</p>

<p>Then she turned to retrace her steps to her room.</p>

<p>She took one step and then stopped, rooted to the ground with
terror and dismay, for, confronting her, she saw a bulky
form.</p>

<p>There was not enough light to show her his face, but she knew
it was Hilary George.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he asked, softly.</p>

<p>She was paralysed with terror. She could not force her tongue
to speak.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" he asked, and his voice rose.</p>

<p>With a superhuman effort she recovered her self-possession.</p>

<p>If he spoke louder he would wake Sir Ralph, and that would be
the end of things.</p>

<p>"It is I," she said, speaking in the same tone.</p>

<p>"Lady Morte-Mannery? I am sorry," he whispered. "I thought I
heard somebody in the grounds, and I listened, but heard nothing
more, so I got a little uneasy.</p>

<p>"It's all right," she said, speaking in the same tone as
before. "I have been to Sir Ralph's room to get a little
veronal. I cannot sleep."</p>

<p>With a whispered apology he went back to his room.</p>

<p>It was on the other side of the treasure house, and she
wondered if she had made any noise. Had he seen her come out?
His next words lifted a weight from her heart.</p>

<p>"I couldn't see where you came from," he said, "or who you
were. I hope I didn't frighten you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, lightly.</p>

<p>With another apology he went into his room, and closed the
door softly behind him.</p>

<p>She flew along the passage to her room, her heart beating
wildly. Once in the room, she locked the door and drew the
curtain across it. Then she lit the gas with an unsteady hand.
She caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror over the
fireplace, and was shocked at its drawn and haggard
appearance.</p>

<p>There was still part of the work to be done.</p>

<p>Hilary had heard somebody in the garden. That would be
Festini. She looked to make sure that she had the jewel, then
she turned out the light again, opened the shutters, and crept
out on to the balcony.</p>

<p>She saw a dark figure standing in the shadow of some bushes.
The man came forward as she appeared.</p>

<p>"Catch!" she whispered.</p>

<p>He held out his hand as she threw.</p>

<p>He caught the medallion neatly, and put it in his pocket,
then turned without a word and plunged into the bushes.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment&mdash;a little disappointed feeling in
her heart. After all she had risked, all she had dared, she had
hoped for some word of thanks.</p>

<p>She was turning to re-enter the room when a sibilant voice
held her.</p>

<p>Her heart bounded. He had come back. She looked down at the
dark figure beneath. "Did you get it?" he whispered, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"Get it?" she said, in bewilderment, "I have just given it to
you."</p>

<p>"Given it to me?" his voice was harsh. "You have given me
nothing. I have been waiting here for half an hour."</p>

<p>She staggered back against the balustrade, half sick with
fear.</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me," said the voice impatiently, growing
louder. "Who was it you gave it to?"</p>

<p>"I gave it to a man," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Through those bushes," she said. Without another word he ran
in the direction the other man had taken.</p>

<p>She had time to get back to the room, close the shutters and
pull the curtains, before she fell half-swooning upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Festini was light of foot, quick, and with the almost cat-like
ability of picking his way in the dark. He had not gone
twenty yards before he saw the man ahead.</p>

<p>There was no time for finesse.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, Festini had changed his plans. He had
dropped the idea of coming by cycle, and his car now stood,
purring gently, in a little lane which adjoined the house.</p>

<p>As he sighted the man ahead, he whipped out his automatic
pistol and fired twice.</p>

<p>Without a sound the man sank to the ground.</p>

<p>Festini had no time to examine his victim. He knew that he
was still alive, as he bent over him and searched his waistcoat
pockets.</p>

<p>In one of these he had hoped to find the jewel, but it was
not there.</p>

<p>But it was in the clasped hand of the stricken man.</p>

<p>Festini found it, wrenched open the fingers, and possessed
himself of the prize.</p>

<p>"Now! Do your worst," he hissed, as he swung round and shook
his fist, as at a world that was at war with him, "do your
worst!"</p>

<p>The sound of the shot had awakened the people of the house.
Lights appeared in two or three rooms.</p>

<p>Vera, lying on the floor, was roused to consciousness by a
loud knocking at her door.</p>

<p>She got up slowly. Her head was still dizzy, and she
staggered as she walked.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is I," said her husband's voice. "Open the door. Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p>She plunged her hands into a jug of water that stood on the
washstand, and passed them over her face. The touch of the
chilly water revived her. She dabbed her face with a towel with
one hand as she opened the door with the other.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>She was steadying herself. She had heard the shot, and she
was prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph was in his dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Where was the firing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I heard no firing," she said, steadily.</p>

<p>"Somebody fired a pistol in the garden," said Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>She heard Hilary's voice in the passage.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Lady Morte-Mannery?" said his voice.</p>

<p>"I am quite all right," she replied. "What is wrong?"</p>

<p>Her voice was shaky and high-pitched, but in a dull way she
knew that her agitation would be excusable. There had been shots
in the garden, somebody had been shot&mdash;who? At that moment
there came to her a quick pang of fear.</p>

<p>"Somebody is shot?" she asked, tensely. "Who is shot?"</p>

<p>"There was a man in the garden, trying to enter the house,"
said Hilary's voice. "Possibly he was detected."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph crossed the room, and, opening the shutters, went
out on to the balcony. Two men were already on the lawn
below.</p>

<p>"Have you found anything?" he called. He was addressing the
two hastily-aroused servants who were conducting the search
outside.</p>

<p>Vera listened; her heart almost stopped beating, when the
groom's voice replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's a man shot in the shrubbery, Sir Ralph. He looks
like a foreigner."</p>

<p>She clenched her hands and waited&mdash;rigid
&mdash;expressionless.</p>

<p>"What sort of man?" asked Sir Ralph, testily. "What do you
mean by a foreigner, Philip?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's a clean-shaven gentleman," said the servant. "I
don't think he's badly hurt. A tall man."</p>

<p>A great joy surged over the woman.</p>

<p>It was not he; whoever it was, whether this wounded man lived
or died&mdash;it was not Festini.</p>

<p>She listened. There was a new voice.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Sir Ralph," it said.</p>

<p>She recognized it, and set her teeth. Part of the
conversation came to her in little gusts.</p>

<p>"It was just a little clip of a bullet across the temple...
that is the second time they have missed me.... I'm afraid
you've lost something...."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Tillizini.</p>

<p>In the big hall they assembled, a dishevelled assembly,
hastily garmented.</p>

<p>Tillizini's wound was a superficial one. The bullet had
struck behind his ear, glancing over the parietal bone and
temporarily stunning him. He was very cheerful.</p>

<p>"I only came down to-night by car," he said, "because I
received information which led me to believe that the attempt
would be made upon you. Now," he said, "I am ready."</p>

<p>He stood up.</p>

<p>"I want to examine your little museum," he said, "and
discover what is lost."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't have lost anything from there," said Sir
Ralph, confidently. "There are alarms in every window, and
almost every pane."</p>

<p>"There are no alarms on the door, are there?" asked
Tillizini.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph looked surprised.</p>

<p>"They are not necessary," he said.</p>

<p>He led the way, and the others followed.</p>

<p>He opened the treasure house, and they flocked in behind him.
He was a little in advance of Tillizini, and he turned in the
doorway to switch on the light.</p>

<p>At that moment Vera saw the evidence of her criminal folly.
On the top of one of the shuttered cases was the little jewelled
electric lamp which Sir Ralph had in a fit of unusual generosity
given her.</p>

<p>Tillizini saw it too. He was as quick as she, and quicker to
move. With one step he stood between the tell-tale lamp and the
gaze of the half-awake people in the doorway. His hand went out
and covered it.</p>

<p>When Sir Ralph turned the lamp had disappeared.</p>

<p>There was a quick inspection.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" cried the knight. "They have taken the
Leonardo!"</p>

<p>"I thought they had," said Tillizini calmly, "and I thought I
should be able to restore it&mdash;but, for the moment, that
pleasure is denied me."</p>

<p>"But is it possible?" said Sir Ralph, bewildered. "Nobody
could have got in here without my knowing!"</p>

<p>He was almost tearful in his grief.</p>

<p>"It was invaluable," he said. "It cannot be replaced. It is
the only one of the kind in the world. What does it
mean&mdash;what does it mean, Tillizini? You must tell me
everything! I insist upon knowing! I won't be kept in the
dark!"</p>

<p>He raved and stormed as though Tillizini had been responsible
for the theft. It was some time before he became calmer, and
then the Italian was by no means informative.</p>

<p>Vera, silent and watchful, waited. Whatever happened, Festini
was safe! By now he would be far on his way to London. He had
the parcel, that was enough: she had served him, she asked for
no more.</p>

<p>From the moment that Tillizini had put out his hand and
covered the lamp she knew that he had guessed her secret. Would
he betray her? To her surprise and relief he made no reference
to what he must have seen and known.</p>

<p>Yet he was distressed and worried&mdash;she saw
that&mdash;but it was with the greater issue, with the danger
which confronted civilization.</p>

<p>He walked up and down the hall&mdash;a remarkable figure,
with the white bandage encircling his head, his hands thrust
deep into his pockets, his chin blue and unshaven, his eyes
tired, with an infinite weariness.</p>

<p>He took no part in the fruitless discussion as to how the
thief effected an entry. He had all the information he required
on that subject. He paused in his walk and took from his pocket
a shining object&mdash;laid it in the palm of his hand and
examined it.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph, attracted by the glow of dull gold in his hand,
stepped forward with a startled cry.</p>

<p>"Why, that is the locket!" he cried.</p>

<p>Tillizini shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is one very much like it," he said, "but it is not the
one. It is the famous locket that was stolen from the Dublin
collection, and which is at the present moment supposed to be at
the bottom of the North Sea. It was given to a fellow-passenger
on that boat to guard and to return to me. You remember I was
charged with the investigation of its disappearance?"</p>

<p>He walked to the fireplace.</p>

<p>There were two overhanging gas-brackets which gave a clear
light.</p>

<p>He held the medallion with both hands, using only two fingers
of each. He gave it a sharp twist and it fell in two.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Why, I did not know that these things opened!" he said
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I could most devoutly wish that they did not," said
Tillizini grimly.</p>

<p>He damped his finger a little, and drew forth from the
locket's interior what looked like four discs of paper, as
indeed they were. They were covered with fine writing&mdash;so
fine that it was almost impossible to read them without the aid
of a reading glass.</p>

<p>"Do you understand Italian?" asked Tillizini.</p>

<p>"A little," said Sir Ralph, "but not enough to read
this."</p>

<p>"Take a good look at it," said the other; "it is from the
hand of the greatest genius that ever lived since Jerusalem was
a vassal state of Rome."</p>

<p>He spoke reverently&mdash;almost adoringly&mdash;of his
famous compatriot.</p>

<p>"That is the hand of Leonardo da Vinci," he said in a hushed
voice.</p>

<p>"And what is it all about?" asked Frank, "and isn't it
written backwards?"</p>

<p>He had been examining the microscopic writing with his keen
eyes.</p>

<p>Tillizini smiled.</p>

<p>"The master wrote with his left hand invariably&mdash;always
working back to the left. This will help you."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a tiny mirror in a leather case.</p>

<p>"Read," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>Frank carried the little discs nearer to the light, and
brought them with the mirror closer to his eyes. Marjorie,
watching him, saw his lips move as he read the Italian, saw his
brows pucker in a puzzled frown, then her lover looked up
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "this is all about a plague." Tillizini
nodded.</p>

<p>"The Great Plague," he said, "or, as modern scientists call
it, the Fourth Plague, which broke out simultaneously in Italy
and Ireland in the same year. It was the one plague which our
modern doctors are unable to understand or fathom. As a matter
of fact, the only man who understood it was Leonardo da Vinci.
He was, as you know well, Sir Ralph, more than a painter. He had
the scientific mind perfectly developed. He was the first to
foresee the coming of the aeroplane and the armoured ship. He
was an engineer, a sculptor, a chemist, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"What is the use? I cannot enumerate his qualities," he said.
"He was so above the heads of his contemporaries that they were
unable to realize what kind of genius was in their midst. Even
posterity can hardly do him justice. He alone understood the
Fourth Plague&mdash;its meaning and its cause.</p>

<p>"That plague came into existence by the cultivation of a
germ, though this, of course, he did not know because the
microscope was denied him, but he guessed it&mdash;with that
wonderful, God-like intuition of his, he guessed it," said
Tillizini, his face glowing with enthusiasm and pride.</p>

<p>"The conditions under which the plague came into being,
conditions which were undreamed of, even by those who saw them
under their eyes, were revealed to Leonardo da Vinci.
Ordinarily," he went on, "they would in this year of grace be
produced."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"Under the modern system," said Tillizini, "that plague could
never appear again. But there are six drugs which you might find
in the British Pharmacopoeia," he continued, "which, if you were
to mix them, would produce a gas."</p>

<p>He spoke impressively, and with the assurance of the
practical scientist.</p>

<p>"That gas, passed through a filter of vegetable matter, would
set up conditions which made the plague of 1500 possible."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Frank. "Do you mean to say that you can
produce a plague synthetically?"</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what Leonardo da Vinci discovered. This is
the secret."</p>

<p>He held the flimsy discs in his hands.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that Leonardo did produce a plague
synthetically, two years after. At any rate, some such outbreak
occurred in the town where his laboratory was situated. It is
believed that, as a result of that plague, Mona Lisa Gioconda
lost her life."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is the woman in the picture," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"That is the woman in the picture," repeated Tillizini, "the
one woman in the world whom Leonardo ever loved. The one great
softening influence that ever came into his life. His
investigations into the cause of the plague he set forth,
concisely, on these little filaments. The lockets he fashioned
himself. One, as you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know the history," said Sir Ralph. "I was telling Mr.
Gallinford only the other day. How extraordinary it is that that
old-world story should be revived."</p>

<p>"But why do the 'Red Hand' want these lockets?"</p>

<p>"They only want one. Either one will do," said Tillizini.
"Don't you realize? To-morrow, with the aid of a man with even
the most elementary knowledge of chemistry, they could devastate
London&mdash;and not only London, but the whole of England, or,
if it please them, the whole of Europe, working from different
centres."</p>

<p>As the little party stood stricken to silence, the full
horror of the danger dawning upon them, Tillizini heard a
long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>Vera had stumbled forward in a dead faint, and Frank had just
time to catch her before she fell.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION OF
MARJORIE</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a week after the burglary at Highlawns
that a perfectly happy man went whistling to his work. He walked
with a brisk step, carrying his lunch in a gaily-coloured
handkerchief, with a tin can full of tea for his breakfast.
George Mansingham raised his eyes to the sky, which was just
turning grey, in thankfulness at his freedom.</p>

<p>Work had been found for him through the medium of Hilary
George, at a little farm outside the town. He and his wife had
been installed in a tiny cottage on Sir Ralph's estate. To give
Sir Ralph his due, he had freely admitted the injustice of the
sentence he had passed; if not to the man, at least to himself,
which was something; and it needed little pleading on the part
of Hilary George, who had taken an interest in the case, to
induce him to let his untenanted cottage to the man he had
wronged.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, he found his employer and his son up
and about. There is much work to be done before the sun comes up
over the edge of the world. There are horses to be fed and
groomed, sheep and cattle that require attention, cows to be
milked, and milk to be carried.</p>

<p>The sky grew lighter, the sun came up, it seemed to him with
a rush, but he was too busy to notice the progress of the time.
At half-past eight nature called him to breakfast. He sat down
to his frugal meal, first placing two nosebags on the heads of
the horses, for he was now engaged in ploughing the ten-acre lot
Farmer Wensell farmed. His meal quickly disposed of, he pulled a
bulky book from the inside of his jacket pocket and began to
read. He had a passion for self-education, and at the moment
Merejowski's Forerunner, which Marjorie had lent him, had a
special significance, not only for him, but for the whole of
England. He was so intent upon the pages of this wonderful
romance that he did not notice the girl who was crossing the
field with such free strides.</p>

<p>He heard his name called and looked up; then he sprang to his
feet, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"You're very absorbed, Mansingham," smiled Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," said the other, "it's a wonderful book, and he's
a wonderful man. I'm not surprised all the world's talking about
him just now."</p>

<p>"It's not because of his genius that they are speaking of
him," said the girl, gravely.</p>

<p>She carried a paper under her arm; in fact she had been down
to Burboro' Station to get the journal.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible business, miss," said the man. He put the
book down. "It doesn't seem possible, in a civilized age, and in
a country like England. Is there any fresh news this morning,
miss?"</p>

<p>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The 'Red Hand' have addressed the Premier," she said, "and
they have demanded ten million pounds, an act of indemnity
passed by the House of Commons, and freedom to leave the
country."</p>

<p>The man looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"Why, they'll never get that, will they, miss?" he asked.
"It's against all reason, a demand like that! Suppose it's not
true, suppose they haven't discovered this plague&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it, Mansingham," she said. "Mr.
Gallinford knows it to be true. He has been investigating,
looking up old documents relating to the plague of 1500. These
men have it in their power to decimate the whole of
England."</p>

<p>The subject they were discussing filled the minds of men
throughout Great Britain that day; nay, throughout Europe.
Wherever civilized people foregathered, the cable and the
telegraph had carried the news of the threat which overhung the
country. It was the final demand of the "Red Hand," a demand
which at first had been pooh-poohed, and had been discussed by
Government officials as a problem which called for immediate
solution.</p>

<p>The "Red Hand" had acted swiftly. Three days after the locket
had disappeared from Burboro' a startling proclamation of the
"Red Hand," printed in blood-red characters, had covered the
hoardings and the walls of London. Then it was for the first
time that England woke to a realization of the terrible danger
which threatened her. It was incomprehensible, unbelievable. It
was almost fantastic. Men who read it smiled helplessly as
though they were reading something which was beyond their
understanding. And yet the proclamation was clear enough. It
ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">To the People of
London.</p>

<p class="quote">We, the Directors of the "Red Hand," demand of
the English Government&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">(a) The sum of Ten Million Pounds.</p>

<p class="quote">( b) An act of indemnity releasing every member
of the Fraternity from all and every penalty to which he may be
liable as a result of his past actions.</p>

<p class="quote">(c) A safe conduct to each and every Member of
the "Red Hand," and facilities, if so required, for leaving the
country.</p>

<p class="quote">In the event of the Government's refusing,
after ten days' grace, we, the Directors of the "Red Hand," will
spread in London the Plague which was known as the Fourth
Plague, and which destroyed six hundred thousand people in the
year 1500. The bacillus of that plague is in our possession and
has been synthetically prepared and tested.</p>

<p class="quote">Citizens! Bring pressure on your Government to
accede to our demands, and save us the necessity for inflicting
this terrible disease upon you!</p><br>

<p>It bore no signature or seal. It was absurd, of course.
Evening papers, necessarily hurried and having little time to
analyse its true meaning, made fun of it. But a different note
appeared in the comments of the morning papers. Every known
scientist and doctor of note who was reachable had been
interviewed, and they one and all agreed that there was more
than an idle threat in the pronouncement.</p>

<p>The papers called it variously, "The Terror," "The Threat of
the 'Red Hand,' "Blackmailing London," and their columns were
filled with every available piece of data concerning the
terrible scourge which had swept through Italy and Ireland in
the year of desolation.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible business," said Mansingham again. "I am
afraid there is something in it."</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>With a courtesy which is not usually found in men of his
class, he accompanied her to the end of the field, and assisted
her across the rough stile leading on to the road. She had made
a detour from the little station to speak to Mansingham. She was
interested in him, and it was a pact between the barrister and
herself that she should keep, as he put it, a friendly eye upon
his protégé.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning; the world was flooded with the
lemon sunlight of early spring. The trees were bright with vivid
green, and primroses and wild violets flowered profusely by the
hedgerows. She shook away the gloom and depression to which the
thought of this terrible menace had subjected her, and stepped
out briskly, humming a little tune.</p>

<p>Half-way across the field, Mansingham, retracing his steps,
picked up one of the papers she had been carrying, and hurried
after her.</p>

<p>She had a twenty minutes' walk before she reached Highlawns,
which stood some quarter of a mile from the town's limits, but
she was of an age, and it was such a morning, when one's feet
seem to move without effort, and song comes unbidden to the
lips.</p>

<p>She heard the whirl of a motor-car behind her, and moved
closer to the hedge to allow it to pass. Unconsciously she
turned to see who was the occupant. At that moment the car
jarred itself to a standstill at her side. A young man, dressed
from head to foot in a white linen dust-coat, sprang out.</p>

<p>"Count Festini!" she cried in amazement.</p>

<p>"Count Festini," he repeated, with his most charming smile.
"I wanted to see you, won't you get in? I am going up to the
house?" he said.</p>

<p>She hesitated. She would much rather have walked that
morning. But it would have been an act of rudeness to have
refused his offer of a lift, and besides, it occurred to her
that she was already overdue for breakfast, and Sir Ralph's
temper of late had not been of the best.</p>

<p>She stepped into the car, and at that moment Mansingham, a
little out of breath, broke through the hedge behind it.</p>

<p>"What a curious idea," Marjorie said, as Festini took his
place beside her.</p>

<p>"What is a curious idea?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A closed car on a day like this," she said. "Why, I thought
you Italians loved the sun."</p>

<p>"We love the sun," he said, "untempered by such winds as you
seem to produce exclusively in England."</p>

<p>He stepped forward and pulled down a red blind which hid the
chauffeur and the road ahead from view. She watched him without
understanding the necessity for his act. Then with a quick move
he pulled the blinds down on each side of the car. It was now
moving forward at a great pace. At this rate, she felt, they
must be very near indeed to Highlawns. They had, in fact, passed
the house, as the embarrassed Mansingham, clinging to the back
of the car and waiting for it to slow up so that he could
restore the girl's paper, saw to his bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" the girl asked coldly. "If you please,
Count Festini, let those blinds up."</p>

<p>"In a little while," he said.</p>

<p>"I insist," she stamped her foot. "You have no right to do
such a thing."</p>

<p>She was hot and angry in a moment as the full realization of
his offence came to her.</p>

<p>"In a moment," he repeated; "for the present we will have the
blinds down, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" she asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"You look very pretty when you're angry," he smiled.</p>

<p>The insolent assurance in his tone made her feel a sudden
giddiness. They must have passed Highlawns by now.</p>

<p>"Stop the car," she demanded.</p>

<p>"The car will stop later," he said; "in the meantime," he
caught her hand as she attempted to release the blind, "in the
meantime," he repeated, holding her wrist tightly, "you will be
pleased to consider yourself my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Your prisoner!" exclaimed the affrighted girl. Her face had
gone very white.</p>

<p>"My prisoner," said Festini, pleasantly. "I am particularly
desirous of holding you to ransom. Don't you realize," his eyes
were blazing with excitement, "don't you realize," he cried,
"what you are to me? I do. In these last few days," he went on,
speaking rapidly, "I have seen all the wealth that any man could
desire. And it is nothing to me. Do you know why? Because there
is one thing in the world that I want more than anything, and
you are that thing."</p>

<p>Both his hands were holding her now. She could not move.. She
was as much fascinated by his deadly earnestness as paralysed by
the grip on her arms.</p>

<p>"I desire you," he said. His voice dropped until it thrilled.
"You, more than anything in the world&mdash;Marjorie. You are
unattainable one way; I must secure you in another."</p>

<p>The girl shrank back into a corner of the car, watching the
man, fascinated. She tried to scream, but no sound came. Festini
watched her, his eyes glowing with the fire of his passion. His
hot hand was closed over hers almost convulsively.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'm doing!" he said, speaking rapidly, "do
you know what I'm risking for you? Can't you realize that I am
imparting a new danger to myself and to my organization by this
act? But I want you; I want you more than anything in the
world," he said passionately.</p>

<p>She found her voice.</p>

<p>"You are mad," she said, "you are wickedly mad."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"What you say is true," he answered moodily, "yet in my
madness I am obeying the same laws which govern humanity.
Something here," he struck his breast, "tells me that you are
the one woman for me. That is an instinct which I obey. Is it
mad? Then we are all mad; all animated creation is mad."</p>

<p>The fierce joy of possession overcame him; she struggled and
screamed, but the whir of the engine drowned her voice. In a
moment she was in his arms, held tightly to him, his hot lips
against her cheeks. He must have caught a glimpse of the
loathing and horror in her face, for of a sudden he released
her, and she shrank back, pale and shaking.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said, huskily, "you&mdash;you say I am
mad&mdash;you make me mad."</p>

<p>His moods changed as swiftly as the April sky. Now he was
pleading; all the arguments he could muster he advanced. He was
almost cheerful, he swore he would release her, reached out his
hand to signal the driver, and repented his generosity.</p>

<p>Then he spoke quickly and savagely of the fate which would be
hers if she resisted him. It was the memory of that tall,
handsome lover of hers that roused him to this fury. He was as
exhausted as she when the car turned from the main road, as she
judged by the jolting of the wheels. After ten minutes' run, it
slowed down and finally stopped.</p>

<p>He jumped up, opened the carriage door and sprang out, then
turned to assist her. A cold, sweet wind greeted her, a wind
charged with the scent of brine. She stood upon a rolling down,
within a hundred yards the sea stretched greyly to the horizon.
There was no house in sight save one small cottage. About the
cottage stood two or three men. She uttered a cry of
thankfulness and started off towards them, when a laugh from
Festini stopped her.</p>

<p>"I'll introduce you myself," he said sarcastically.</p>

<p>She turned to run towards the sea, but in two strides he was
up to her and had caught her by the arm. Then a huge hand
gripped his neck, with a quick jerk he was spun round. His eyes
blazing with anger, he turned upon his assailant. George
Mansingham, tall and broad, grimed with the dust of the road,
for he had maintained an uncomfortable position hanging on to
the back of the car for two hours, met the vicious charge of
Festini with one long, swinging blow, and the Italian went down
to the ground stunned.</p>

<p>The girl was dazed by the suddenness of the rescue, until
Mansingham aroused her to action.</p>

<p>"This way, miss!" he said.</p>

<p>He caught her unceremoniously round the waist, swung her up
as if she were a child, and leapt across a ditch which drained
this section of the downs.</p>

<p>"Run!" he whispered. He too had seen the men and guessed they
were in the confederacy. The girl gathered up all her reserve of
strength and ran like the wind, Mansingham loping easily at her
side.</p>

<p>The wind carried the voices of their pursuers. One staccato
shot rang out, a bullet whistled past them, then some one in
authority must have given the order to stop firing. And indeed
it was more dangerous for the men than for the fugitives.</p>

<p>There was a coastguard station half a mile along the cliff
road, and, although neither the girl nor Mansingham realized the
fact, they instinctively felt that the coastline offered the
best means of escape. Then suddenly Marjorie tripped and fell.
Mansingham stopped in his stride and turned to lift her. As he
raised her to her feet he uttered an exclamation of despair.</p>

<p>Facing him were two men, indubitably Italians, and their
revolvers covered him. He had come against the "Red Hand"
outpost.</p>

<p>It was all over in ten minutes. The pursuers came up, the
girl was snatched from his protecting arms. He fought well; man
after man fell before his huge fists. Then a knife, deftly
thrown, struck him by the haft full between the eyes and he went
down like a log.</p>

<p>Festini, breathless, his face marred by an ugly redness which
was fast developing into a bruise, directed operations.</p>

<p>"If you make a sound," he said, "or attempt to attract the
attention of any person you see, you will have that person's
death on your hands, and probably your own."</p>

<p>He spoke curtly, impersonally, as though she herself were
Mansingham.</p>

<p>"Do not hurt him," she gasped. She referred to the prostrate
form of the farm-labourer, now stirring to life. Festini made no
answer. He was of a race which did not readily forgive a
blow.</p>

<p>"Take her away," he said.</p>

<p>He remained behind with his two familiars. "I think we will
cut his throat, Signor," said Il Bue, "and that will be an end
to him."</p>

<p>"And an end to us," said Festini; "this coast is patrolled,
the man will be found, and the whole coastline searched."</p>

<p>He walked a dozen paces to the edge of the cliff and looked
down. There was a sheer fall here of two hundred feet, and the
tide was in.</p>

<p>"There is twenty feet of water here," he said,
significantly.</p>

<p>They carried the reviving man by the head and feet to the
edge of the cliff. They swung him twice and then released their
hold, his arms and legs outstretched like a starfish. Round and
round he twirled in that brief space of time, Festini and the
other watching. Then the water splashed whitely and the dark
figure disappeared.</p>

<p>They waited a little while, there was no reappearance, and
Festini and his lieutenant retraced their footsteps to the
cottage, the third man following.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; TILLIZINI LEAVES A
MARK</h2>

<p class="first">THE period of ultimatum was drawing to a close.
For four days longer England had the opportunity of agreeing to
the terms which the "Red Hand" had laid down.</p>

<p>In his big library at Downing Street, occupying the chair
which great and famous men had occupied for the past century,
the Prime Minister, grave and preoccupied, sat in conference
with Tillizini.</p>

<p>The Italian was unusually spick and span that morning. He had
dressed himself with great care, an ominous sign for the
organization he had set himself to exterminate. For this was one
of his eccentricities, and it had passed into a legend among the
criminal classes in Italy, that a neat Tillizini was a dangerous
Tillizini. There is a saying in Florence, "Tillizini has a new
coat&mdash;who is for the galleys?"</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was fingering his pen absently, making
impossible little sketches upon his blotting pad.</p>

<p>"Then you associate the disappearance of Miss Marjorie Meagh
with the operations of the 'Red Hand'?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the other.</p>

<p>"And what of the man, Mansingham?"</p>

<p>"That, too," said Tillizini. "They were seen together in a
field where Mansingham was working, his book and his coat were
found as he had left them, and then he and she walked together
to the stile. He is seen by another labourer to walk back slowly
across the field, to suddenly stoop and pick up something,
probably the lady's handkerchief or bag, it is immaterial which.
He runs back to the stile, jumps over, and evidently follows the
lady. From that moment neither he nor she are seen again. One
woman I questioned at a cottage by the roadside remembers a big
car passing about that time. I place the three circumstances
together."</p>

<p>"But surely," said the Prime Minister, "they would hardly
take the man. What object had they? What object in taking the
lady so far as that was concerned?" Tillizini looked out of the
window. From where he sat he commanded a view of Green Park, a
bright and spirited scene. The guard had just been relieved at
the Horse Guards, and they were riding across the parade ground,
their cuirasses glittering in the sun, their polished helmets so
many mirrors reflecting the rays of light. He watched them
sadly, and the great crowd that marched on either side of them.
Not all the arms of England, all her military and naval
strength, her laws and splendid institutions, could save her
from the malignity of the "Red Hand."</p>

<p>He turned with a start to the Prime Minister, and found that
gentleman regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>"In a sense," he said, "I do not mind this abduction, always
providing that neither of these people are injured. I cannot
understand why they should have bothered; but it is these side
issues of private vengeance which invariably bring the big
organizations to grief."</p>

<p>"Seriously, Professor Tillizini," said the Premier, "do you
think that these men will carry their threat into
execution?"</p>

<p>"Seriously, I do," said Tillizini. "Your experts scoffed at
the idea of the 'Red Hand' being able to cultivate this
particular germ. The 'Red Hand's' reply must have been a little
startling to them." He smiled. "If I remember rightly they sent
a little of the culture to your Bacteriological Institute.
Animals which were inoculated died with all the symptoms which
have been described by the fifteenth-century writers."</p>

<p>The Premier nodded his head.</p>

<p>"We cannot give the money, that is impossible; you recognize
that, Professor?" Tillizini assented.</p>

<p>"It would mean the negation of all law; it would create a
precedent which would put an end to all the authority of
civilization; it were better that all England should be ravaged
by this disease than that a single penny should leave the
Treasury. That is my view. I am prepared," he said quietly, "to
accept not only the responsibility of that action, but the first
consequence of these men's machinations. This I have intimated
through the public press. The only hope is that we may secure
the culture, and not only secure it, but locate the laboratory
where the cultivation is being made. It is a hope," he shrugged
his shoulders. "I know you are doing all you can, Tillizini," he
said quickly, "and Scotland Yard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard is working splendidly," said Tillizini. "Your
police organization is rather wonderful."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Four days," he said, "is a very long time."</p>

<p>"You will take any steps you deem necessary for the public
safety?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure of that, sir," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>The Premier twisted his blotter in his preoccupation.</p>

<p>"They say of you, Professor," he said deliberately, "that you
do not hesitate to commit what in the eyes of the law-abiding
world might be considered as criminal acts, in order to further
justice."</p>

<p>"I have never hesitated," said Tillizini, "if you
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean nothing in particular," said the Premier; "only I
tell you this, if you deem it necessary to go outside the law to
administer preventive punishment, I assure you that I will
secure you the necessary indemnity from Parliament."</p>

<p>Tillizini bowed.</p>

<p>"I have to thank your Excellency for that," he said, "and you
may be sure I shall not abuse the power, and that no crime I
commit will ever need an act of indemnity."</p>

<p>The Premier looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Tillizini, with his sweetest smile, "my
crimes are never brought home to me."</p>

<p>With another bow he left the room.</p>

<p>Outside the house in Downing Street, Inspector Crocks was
waiting.</p>

<p>"I got you some telegrams," he said, genially. "I am rapidly
deteriorating into a private secretary'."</p>

<p>Tillizini smiled. A feeling of affection had grown up between
these two men, so differently constituted, so temperamentally
apart. When Crocks had been detailed to assist Tillizini in his
work, there were many sceptical people who smiled behind their
hands, for anybody more unlike the detective of fiction than the
inspector could not easily be imagined. Yet he was a shrewd,
clever man, subtle to a point of brilliancy. A rapid and
effective organizer, with a knowledge of the criminal underworld
which few men possess.</p>

<p>Tillizini tore open the telegrams; he read them twice, then
he crumpled them into a ball and thrust them into his coat
pocket. The letters, after glancing at the address and the
postmark, he placed unopened in the inside pocket of his frock
coat.</p>

<p>"I didn't show you the telegrams," he said to the other,
"because they were in code."</p>

<p>In a few words he communicated the gist of their contents.
Tillizini's code-book was in his head.</p>

<p>"I am going to see my decoy now."</p>

<p>"Is he still alive?" asked the inspector with simulated
surprise.</p>

<p>"He was, a few minutes ago," said Tillizini. For once he did
not treat the subject facetiously, and the inspector knew that
the question he had put in good-humour had a serious
application.</p>

<p>"I secured him a position," said Tillizini suddenly; "he is
an outside porter at Victoria. It will afford him an excellent
opportunity of becoming acquainted with contrary humanity."</p>

<p>"And at the same time he will be able to give you a little
information," said Crocks. "I think it is an excellent scheme.
He doesn't look clever, and I don't think he is particularly
clever, but he has got the power which so few police officers
possess, unfortunately. The moment a man begins to look
important his value decreases."</p>

<p>Tillizini laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, unimportant man!" he said cryptically.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two parted. The detective went back
to Scotland Yard and Tillizini hailed a cab and drove to an
address in South London.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve that day the fast train from Burboro' to
Victoria steamed slowly into the big terminus. Vera Morte-Mannery
was one of the first to descend. Her foot touched the
platform almost before the train stopped.</p>

<p>She walked quickly through the barrier into the large space
at the end of the station.</p>

<p>She looked round anxiously, and then up at the clock. The man
she sought was not there. She strolled aimlessly from one side
of the station to the other, and was returning to the bookstall,
when Festini, with rapid strides, came into the station.</p>

<p>She caught his eye and he checked himself and turned about
carelessly. He walked out of the station and she followed. At
his uplifted finger a car came out of the rank and drew
alongside the pavement.</p>

<p>Without a word she got in and he followed. They drove in
silence until the car turned into Hyde Park and slowed down in
obedience to the regulations.</p>

<p>Then she turned to him suddenly and, with a breaking voice,
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is Marjorie Meagh?"</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Marjorie Meagh?" he asked. "You do not mean to tell me that
you have brought me to London to ask me a question like
that?"</p>

<p>"Where is Marjorie Meagh?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"How on earth should I know?"</p>

<p>"Festini," she said, pleadingly, "let us be frank with one
another. Marjorie has been taken by the 'Red Hand.' You are the
'Red Hand.'"</p>

<p>"Hush!" he muttered, savagely; "don't shout, people could
hear you on the sidewalks!"</p>

<p>His manner to her had changed. It was a little cold, a little
impatient, more than a little intolerant. She had detected the
changed atmosphere the moment she had met him.</p>

<p>She pressed her lips tightly together and remained silent for
a little while.</p>

<p>"What is your object in taking her?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is hidden from you. Do you not trust me?"</p>

<p>"Trust you!" she laughed bitterly. "Have I not trusted you to
the fullest extent?" she asked. "That question should rather
come from me. You do not trust me, Festini."</p>

<p>It was less a statement than a pleading. She wanted him to
deny it, but no denial came.</p>

<p>"There are things which it is not right for me to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked; "is there any secret of the 'Red Hand'
which I do not know?"</p>

<p>He smiled a little uneasily.</p>

<p>"You did not know anything about the Fourth Plague," he said,
softly.</p>

<p>"I do not complain of that," she said, "it was too great a
thing to trust with any man or woman. But there is nothing so
subtle in this kidnapping of Marjorie Meagh."</p>

<p>He spread out his hands with a gesture of helplessness.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," he said. "There is something behind this
which you cannot know."</p>

<p>"There is something behind it which I can guess!" she said
fiercely. "You love Marjorie&mdash;you have taken her because
you love her. Don't deny it. I can see it in your face. Oh, you
liar! You liar!"</p>

<p>He had never seen her like this. It was a new force he was
encountering, one which at once pleased and piqued him.</p>

<p>She had been all softness, all yielding to him before, an
easy conquest for this handsome man, with his soft voice and his
eloquent eyes.</p>

<p>In her anger she was a little terrible, but she did not
terrify him. He was used to opposition, and had a quick way with
it. There was enough of woman in him to appreciate her feelings.
But, like the autocrat he was, he resented her revolt, and in
his resentment said more than it was wise, under the
circumstances, to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," he said, coolly. "I do love her. Why
should I deny it? I do not love you any less because I love her.
She is on a different plane to you and I."</p>

<p>Vera was breathing quickly; her bosom rose and fell with the
intensity of her pent up rage. She did not speak again for a
minute; she was conquering an insane desire to throw herself
from the car, to run anywhere out of his sight, as she had gone,
she knew, out of his heart. The fires of humiliation and
jealousy burnt too fiercely within her for words.</p>

<p>Again and again she checked the wild torrent of speech that
rose to her lips and choked in the checking.</p>

<p>And this was the end! The end of her dream, the reward for
all her work, for all her treachery to those who loved her, the
last stretch of the happy road which she had fondly thought led
to eternity.</p>

<p>From time to time he looked at her out of the corner of his
eye.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said at last, speaking composedly, "your
great plan has come to fruition. You have no further use for
me?"</p>

<p>"Do not say that, Vera," he said.</p>

<p>He was immensely relieved to discover how well she had taken
the news, which, cold-blooded as he was, he had no desire, and
if the truth be told, no intention of telling her.</p>

<p>"You are indispensable," he said. He tried to take her hand,
but she withdrew it. "It is only the exigencies of the scheme we
have in hand which has prevented me from taking you more fully
into my confidence. As to Marjorie, I want you to be generous,"
he said. "I want you to realize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," she said, wearily. "Were you ever
sincere, Festini, were you ever faithful?"</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"I swear," he began.</p>

<p>"Don't swear," she said. "I think I understand." She smiled
bravely. "I'll get out here," she said. "I'd like a little walk.
This was not exactly the outcome of the morning's meeting that I
expected," she went on; "although I was jealous, I never
realized that my suspicions were true."</p>

<p>He tried by argument to persuade her to remain with him, but
she was determined. She tapped the window and the car drew up.
As she alighted, he assisted her. She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Festini," she said. His eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"You must see me again, there is no goodbye with me," he
said, abruptly. "I have told you you are indispensable&mdash;I
mean that."</p>

<p>She made no reply. Gently she relaxed her clasp, and her hand
fell listlessly to her side. Then she turned abruptly and walked
away.</p>

<p>He stood watching her until she was out of sight. Could he
trust her? He had a large knowledge of men, a larger of women.
He had weighed all the chances; she would not betray him, he
thought. These English people love to suffer in silence, to hug
to their secret hearts their greatest griefs.</p>

<p>He smiled, shrugged his shoulders, and, turning to the
driver, directed him to a fashionable restaurant. For men, even
great conspirators, must lunch.</p>

<p>He stopped the car in Oxford Street to buy an evening
newspaper. It was filled, as had been the morning journals, with
speculations on the Fourth Plague. Would the "Red Hand" put
their threat into execution? One journal had found a scientist
who had discovered a specific, another gave a perfect pen
picture of Tillizini. Wild and improbable rumours found
prominence, there was nothing of any real account. He was
closing the paper when a little paragraph which had evidently
been inserted to fill up caught his eye at the bottom of the
column.</p>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"The unfortunate man, Mansingham, who has
added to the tragic variety of his career by being associated
with the disappearance of Miss Marjorie Meagh, was an expert
swimmer, and at the annual meeting of the Burboro' Aquatic Club
last night sympathetic references were made to his
disappearance."</p> <br>

<p>Festini frowned. A swimmer? Of course it was absurd. But
there might have been grave danger in throwing him into the
water. He was stunned, though, and three days had passed without
any sign of his reappearance.</p>

<p>He knew, by careful inquiry, that nobody had been picked up
on the coast, but it sometimes happened that weeks elapsed
before the sea gave up its dead. It was absurd to bother about
that. But throughout his luncheon he found the thought intruding
in his mind. Suppose this man turned up? It would have been
better to have followed out the suggestion of Il Bue and have
killed him right away.</p>

<p>The waiter brought him his bill, and he paid, tipping the
servant lavishly.</p>

<p>He walked out of the hall into the big vestibule of the
restaurant, selected a cigar at the little cigar counter, and
strolled out into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>His car, driven by a trusted member of the "Red Hand,"
followed him along the broad, crowded thoroughfare at a snail's
pace.</p>

<p>At the corner of Piccadilly Circus he suddenly came face to
face with Frank Gallinford.</p>

<p>The Englishman was looking ill; the strain of the past few
days was telling on him. The loss of his fiancée was preying on
his mind; he had not slept. His agents were searching the
country from end to end. He had also established a little police
organization of his own, for Frank Gallinford was a fairly
wealthy man.</p>

<p>The two men stopped, staring at each other for the fraction
of a second, then Festini held out his hand with a suave
smile.</p>

<p>"How do you do Mr. Gallinford?" he said.</p>

<p>Frank was in no mood for conversation or condolence. He
uttered a few conventional words, shook hands hurriedly and
passed on, leaving Festini to finish his stroll.</p>

<p>Frank had not gone twenty yards before somebody pressed his
arm softly. He looked round. A tall man was standing at his
side. At first he did not recognize him in his rough workman's
kit and his little moustache, but when he spoke he knew him.</p>

<p>"Go back after Festini," said Tillizini quickly. "Talk to him
about anything you like, hold him in conversation for a few
minutes," he turned and walked back with the other a little way,
"and when you get into St. James' Street turn off to the right.
The street is up. Induce him by any art in your power to go to
the other end of that street."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"No, do not ask, 'Why,'" said Tillizini. He gave one of his
rare gestures of impatience. "Do as I tell you."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. Though he had no heart for the job, he
quickened his steps and overtook Festini.</p>

<p>Tillizini watched them. He saw them strolling aimlessly
along, and turn into the street he had indicated. The waiting
car on the other side of the road entered the street and then
stopped; the road was up, and beyond half-way down there was no
thoroughfare. The chauffeur looked round anxiously. He had to
back out and make a detour by the way of the lower end of Regent
Street and Piccadilly. He had another alternative, which was to
wait. He looked undecided. He was assisted in his decision as to
what he should do by the gesture of a policeman, who ordered him
back to the main street.</p>

<p>Very slowly the car backed out. It was a minute or two before
he could bring the long Napier into the stream of traffic moving
up towards Piccadilly Circus. There was a block here, and
another wait ensued.</p>

<p>Tillizini had posted himself where he could watch every
movement. He saw the look of anxiety on the chauffeur's face.
The opportunity he had been waiting for for the last two hours
now presented itself. He threaded his way through the block of
traffic and passed the car. He took something from his pocket
and, bending over the rear wheel, pressed down his hand upon it.
A broad strip of rubber with a steel clamp at either end.</p>

<p>Deftly he fixed it over the wheel. In its centre an arrow
head projected. It had been carefully prepared and only the
expert, interested in the accessories of cars, would have
thought it unusual.</p>

<p>With one glance to see that his work had been well done, he
slipped through the traffic, and gained the other side of the
road. He walked a little way down Regent Street, from thence he
saw the two men talking. Festini was walking back. He had missed
the car and had understood why it had failed to follow him.</p>

<p>Tillizini saw him take a hurried farewell of Frank and walk
quickly up the street. The professor smiled. It appealed to him,
this spectacle of Festini and his car playing hide-and-seek with
one another.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to rejoin Frank, instead he called a cab,
which came reluctantly, for this man in working clothes did not
inspire confidence, and drove straight to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>That night every police station in England received a
notification, and in the early hours of the morning, policemen
on foot, cyclists and mounted men were searching the wet roads
for the track of a motor car which displayed an arrow at regular
intervals.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE HOUSE BY THE
RIVER</h2>

<p class="first">FROM her window Marjorie could see the broad
and sluggish river. When the fog did not veil every object from
sight, she caught a glimpse of big ships passing up and down;
fussy little tugs drawing strings of lighters, brown-sailed
barges that went with stately leisure to the sea. In the
foreground was marshland, uncultivated.</p>

<p>The sluggish river, for such it was at a distance of a
quarter of a mile, was the River Thames; the marshland was that
unlovely stretch of swamp on its north bank, between Southend
and Barking.</p>

<p>By putting her face close to the window she could see a
small, low-roofed building, tarred and weatherproof, from which
men in white overalls came and went.</p>

<p>The house she was in was an old one, as houses go. It was
built of brick; the rooms were lofty and cold and a little
damp.</p>

<p>Even in the room which had been allotted to her use, the
paper had peeled off the wall in great pieces, and not even the
fire, which the hard-faced Italian woman who attended her kept
fed, dispelled the chilly dreariness of the apartment.</p>

<p>She had been brought here by night from the house on the
cliff. She had lain down to sleep after supper in her Kentish
prison and had awakened to find herself lying in the room she
now tenanted.</p>

<p>The knowledge that they must have drugged her food filled her
with panic.</p>

<p>The day following her arrival she had refused to eat or
drink, and now it was not until the Italian woman had partaken
from the dishes she supplied, before Marjorie's eyes, that the
girl consented to touch the food.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she numbered amongst her accomplishments a
working knowledge of Italian. Of late she had polished up her
acquaintance with the language. Frank's work mainly lay in
Italy, and she had seen the necessity for becoming
proficient.</p>

<p>But she received no satisfactory reply to any of her
inquiries. She had not seen Festini since that day on the cliff,
though she had heard his voice often enough.</p>

<p>She guessed rather than knew that in the little low-roofed
house near by, was being prepared that terrible culture which
was to bring England to her knees in submission.</p>

<p>Everything that Festini could do to relieve the monotony of
her life, he had done.</p>

<p>She was plentifully supplied with books and papers, and to
serve her table he had secured a perfect Italian cook.</p>

<p>The only man she had spoken to was a tall giant of a man,
whom she had seen on the cliff with Festini.</p>

<p>He answered her questions gruffly, and in monosyllables.</p>

<p>He had merely come into the room, she gathered, to see to the
security of the bars which had been fixed outside the window.
She was ill with anxiety; she dare not give her imagination its
rein.</p>

<p>It was Frank she thought of&mdash;Frank, whom she knew would
be distracted with grief; and at night she alternately wept and
prayed for the strength and sanctuary of his arms.</p>

<p>It was on the third day following her abduction. She was
sitting trying to read by the window, when the click of the lock
brought her to her feet.</p>

<p>She heard the voice of Festini outside, and in a moment he
had come into the room, locking the door behind him.</p>

<p>They stood confronting one another. She had walked swiftly to
the centre of the room, and placed the table between them.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, with his pleasant smile, "I hope you have
everything you want."</p>

<p>She made no reply at once. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want my freedom," she said.</p>

<p>"That," he said, with a little bow, "I am sorry I cannot
grant you. It is necessary for my health and security that you
should stay a little longer. Afterwards, I hope to make you the
wife of one of the richest men in Europe."</p>

<p>"That will never be," she said, steadily. "I would sooner be
the first victim of the plague you threaten, than endure that
humiliation."</p>

<p>He winced at the words.</p>

<p>"It is no humiliation," he said, a little haughtily. "In my
veins runs the best blood of Italy. It is an honour to be the
chosen bride of Festini."</p>

<p>She was amazed at the unexpected vanity of the man.</p>

<p>She had never regarded him, even at the most friendly period
of their relationship, as more than a rather good-looking,
well-mannered member of the middle classes. That he should esteem
his birth as being sufficient to make him superior to censure was
a strange point of view.</p>

<p>She looked at him, in spite of herself, with an added
interest.</p>

<p>"I ask you to be my wife," he said.</p>

<p>He emphasized the words.</p>

<p>"You ought to realize that, in addition to doing you an
honour, I am also acting with great magnanimity. You are here
alone," he said, "entirely and absolutely at my mercy. You are
surrounded by men and women who would question no act of mine,
however barbarous it might seem to you. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>She understood too well.</p>

<p>She was safe unless she made quasi-friendly relationships
impossible. She had need to temporize.</p>

<p>He may have guessed what was passing in her mind.</p>

<p>"Understand," he said, "there is no escape from here, except
as my wife. I will be patient without you. I have been patient
with you," he went on. "To-morrow a priest will marry us
according to the rights of my Church."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said, a little mockingly. "It is rather soon,
is it not? And you have no trousseau!"</p>

<p>He waved the objection away.</p>

<p>"That is a detail which can either be arranged or can be
overridden."</p>

<p>He made no attempt to touch her.</p>

<p>"May I sit down?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded, and he drew a chair forward to the table and
seated himself.</p>

<p>"I think I ought to take you a little into my confidence," he
said, in his pleasant, matter-of-fact manner. "It is necessary
to expedite matters. Your friend&mdash;how do you pronounce his
name&mdash;Mansingham?&mdash;was picked up by a fishing smack. I
think he swam out to sea and picked up the smack, but it is
immaterial. He is alive, and, I have reason to believe,
talkative."</p>

<p>He saw the look of hope spring up in her face, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"The fact that he will be able to identify me with this act
of abduction," he went on, "embarrasses me, but, fortunately,
our scheme is so far advanced that there is no longer any
necessity for me to disguise my association with the 'Red
Hand.'"</p>

<p>"The only thing which is a trifle annoying is that I must
stay in this deadly place a few more days. All the work that is
to be done my agents can do. But for your presence here it would
be an impossible situation. Not for all the gold in England
could I rusticate by the banks of the Thames&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>His dazzling smile bewildered the girl. He had a trick of
discussing the most outrageous propositions with a serious and
convincing air. It was all superficial, but then his
superficiality bit deeper into him than into most men.</p>

<p>At heart she knew him to be a cold-blooded and remorseless
man, who would stop at nothing to gain his ends. It was only
that the veneer of civilization was thicker, that the brute
within him did not lie so close to the surface, which
distinguished him from his comrades.</p>

<p>But the streak of cruelty was there, as he showed.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, "I met Mr. Gallinford the other day,
and condoled with him upon your disappearance."</p>

<p>"You brute!" she flamed. "How dare you mock me!"</p>

<p>"I like you when you are like that," he said, admiringly.
"You almost tempt me to continue to tell how ill and worn he
looks."</p>

<p>He laughed, but there was no note of merriment in the
sound.</p>

<p>"A singularly thick-headed man! Had he been an Italian he
would have known by my face, by the change in my eyes when your
name was mentioned, that it was I"&mdash;he pointed to
himself&mdash;"who had robbed him. But then these Englishmen are
so phlegmatic! They soon forget. You must not worry very much
about your Frank," he said, as he rose to go. "In a year or two
he will have married some comfortable Englishwoman, and have
settled down to a life made up with shooting pheasants and
discussing defective drainage."</p>

<p>She was incapable of reply.</p>

<p>He went out of the room and locked the door behind him,
leaving her alone, with her head on her arms&mdash;weeping from
very anger.</p>

<p>He found Il Bue in the room below with two men who had just
come in from the laboratory he had arranged in the wooden
shed.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, moodily, as he flung himself into a chair
at the head of the table. "What are the developments?"</p>

<p>"Signor," said one of the men, "everything is ready. We have
secured perfect cultures, even more perfect than those
dispatched to the Bacteriological Institution." Festini
nodded.</p>

<p>"To-morrow I shall receive the Government's reply. I have
asked them to advertise that reply in the columns of a
newspaper."</p>

<p>"And what will it be?" asked Il Bue, his eyes fixed upon
Festini's face.</p>

<p>Festini shrugged.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" he said. "I think at the eleventh hour they will
agree to my terms."</p>

<p>One of the assistants in white was a thick-set man with a
sour, bad-tempered face. He took no part in the subsequent
discussion on the methods to be adopted for the distribution of
the plague.</p>

<p>Festini had made elaborate precautions and had issued
exhaustive literature for distribution amongst the members of
the "Red Hand."</p>

<p>He was sincere in his desire that the agents of his
organization should escape the consequences of their own
villainy.</p>

<p>When the discussion was finished, the surly man jerked his
head round to Festini. He was sitting on his right hand, his
elbows on the table, his big, fleshy hands clasped.</p>

<p>"What about this woman, Signor Festini?" he asked.</p>

<p>The young man looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"'This woman'?" he repeated, softly, "I do not know who you
mean."</p>

<p>The stout man jerked his head upwards. He was the kind of man
who moved in jerks.</p>

<p>"She who is upstairs," he said.</p>

<p>Festini got up very slowly from the table.</p>

<p>"You will understand, Gregorio," he said, in his honeyed
tones, "that you will never refer to that lady in such a way.
Indeed," he said, carefully, "you will never refer to her at
all."</p>

<p>"There are no secrets from the brethren," grumbled the man.
"We all want to know what is the plan with regard to her."
Without a word Festini's hand leapt out; his quick, strong
fingers caught the other by the throat; with a sidelong twist he
forced the man's head back over the table.</p>

<p>Festini was a strong man despite his frail physique.</p>

<p>"You dog!" he hissed in the man's purple face. "Must I answer
to you for all I do?" The man struggled to recover his balance,
but a long bright blade flashed in front of his eyes.</p>

<p>Festini hesitated, then he released his grip, and the man
staggered up to his feet.</p>

<p>"Remember this," said the Count. "Remember it all your life,
Gregorio. It may serve you well one day&mdash;the recollection."
The man was livid and shaking.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Signor," he said, humbly; "it was thoughtless. I
did not intend to offend your Excellency."</p>

<p>With a curt nod Festini dismissed him.</p>

<p>"And understand," he said, "that I will not spare any man who
speaks slightingly or lightly of the lady who is to be the
Countess Festini. There is my plan, if you wish to know it. That
is enough&mdash;too much, perhaps&mdash;certainly enough. I give
you my best &mdash;you must give me obedience and faith. That is
all I ask."</p>

<p>He was in no mood of tolerance.</p>

<p>George Mansingham had arrived in England, and by this time
Tillizini knew what he had already guessed. London was unsafe
for Festini, and he was the type of man who scorned any
disguise.</p>

<p>He must fret away his time in this God-forsaken spot; the
fulfilment of his plans demanded it.</p>

<p>He stopped in the house long enough to don the white overall
which had distinguished his companions, and went into the long
wooden shed, Il Bue and the two men joining him at the entrance
of the hut.</p>

<p>The only light came through a big skylight. House and shed
had formed part of a boat-builder's establishment, long since
bankrupt and fallen into decay. It suited his purpose admirably.
It was far enough away from the high road to obtain seclusion.
He had a plausible excuse for the presence of his men. The
premises were ostensibly part of the properties of a little
company he had formed some time before for the manufacture of
synthetic rubber.</p>

<p>There is something about synthetic rubber and its
manufacturers and inventors which keep an amused public at
bay.</p>

<p>The shed was divided into two parts. In the first there were
a number of test tubes, retorts and scientific apparatus upon a
large bench.</p>

<p>The entrance to the second room was obtained through a stout
door, which was fastened by two padlocks.</p>

<p>These the big man unfastened. Before he opened the door he
pulled up from his chin an antiseptic mask, which he brought
over his face and secured to the hood of his white gown.</p>

<p>The others followed his example.</p>

<p>They took up rubber gloves from the bench in the outer room
and drew them on. Il Bue pulled the door open and a faint sweet
scent came out to greet them.</p>

<p>In the centre of the inner and smaller compartment was a long
narrow table on which, at intervals, rested four deep porcelain
dishes under glass bell-covers.</p>

<p>They were no more to the sight than narrow strips of glass
coated with a light-brown gelatinous substance, but each glass
case held death in a terrible form.</p>

<p>Festini looked at them curiously. It was almost impossible to
believe that these innocent-looking strips of dull glass could
play so powerful a part.</p>

<p>"That is all?" said he, half to himself.</p>

<p>"That is all, Signor," said Il Bue.</p>

<p>His big face was twisted in a puzzled grin.</p>

<p>"It seems a very simple thing," he said, suspiciously; "why,
I could smash it out of existence with a blow of my fist."</p>

<p>The man with the sour face looked up at him sideways.</p>

<p>"You would die very soon," he said.</p>

<p>He was the chemist of the party, a brilliant man with strange
gifts, who had been brought into association with the "Red Hand"
and found an outlet in their operations for the lawless and
perverse spirit within him.</p>

<p>Festini turned and led the way from the room. He waited till
Il Bue re-padlocked the door, then he stepped out of the shed,
slipping down his mask.</p>

<p>The fresh air came to him like a sweet, refreshing draught;
it seemed to him that he had tasted the very atmosphere of death
and desolation in that tiny room; that it was already tainted
with the plague he was about to spread wide-cast.</p>

<p>He made no other attempt to see the girl; he was satisfied
with that one interview. He remained in his room, reading by the
aid of a portable electric lamp such comments of the Press upon
the "Red Hand" as his agents had collected.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock there were two new arrivals. In one of these
Festini was particularly interested; it was the priest he had
secured for the marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>Psychologists have endeavoured to get at the state of
Festini's mind; to analyse by set formula the exact proportions.
Was he wholly villain? Were the fantastic acts of chivalry,
preposterous as they were, remembering the circumstances in
which they were displayed, indications of a better nature?</p>

<p>Tillizini, in his exhaustive analysis of the man's character,
had attributed such acts as this contemplated marriage as merely
evidence of habit. Festini's long association with men and women
of his class had endowed him with an habitual respect for
certain conventions. This was Tillizini's estimate, and was
probably an accurate one, for he knew the man.</p>

<p>The priest he had chosen had been brought post-haste from
Italy, and had travelled night and day. He was a man known to
the association as being "safe": he himself was suspected of
complicity in certain outrages which had shocked Italy in the
year before the great trial. He himself had stood with the other
sixty prisoners in a cage in the criminal court, but, thanks to
ingenious perjury, he had escaped punishment.</p>

<p>Festini greeted him without cordiality, with the grave
respect which a true son of the Church shows to his spiritual
superior, and with the faint hint of patronage which the greater
intellect instinctively adopts towards the lesser.</p>

<p>He gave orders for the priest's accommodation, and, after the
brief interview, was again left alone.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when Festini threw himself down on a
truckle bed to snatch a few hours' sleep. In the early hours of
the morning his spies would bring him news of the Premier's
reply. He fell into an uneasy, fitful sleep, a sleep disturbed
by bad dreams, such as were not usual with him.</p>

<p>There came a light knock and he went to the door. Il Bue was
waiting.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Festini.</p>

<p>"One of the brethren has just come in," said the man, who was
palpably disturbed. "He came on his cycle from where he has been
watching the London road, and he says that some soldiers are
marching from London."</p>

<p>Festini made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Did you wake me to tell me that?" he asked, irritably.
"Haven't you been long enough in England, my friend, to know
that soldiers have nothing whatever to do with police work? This
is not Italy, it is England. Go&mdash;tell your scout to return
to his post, to watch not for the army, but for Tillizini and
his friends."</p>

<p>He went back to his room and again lay on the bed, pulling a
soft, camel-hair rug over him. He tossed from side to side but
could not sleep; he got up after a little while, and went out. A
man was keeping guard outside the door.</p>

<p>"Go to Catrina," he said, "and tell her to make me some
chocolate."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the woman brought him in a steaming bowl
on a tray. She set it before him and he acknowledged it with a
curt word of thanks, when a thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Catrina," he said, calling her back, "your lady is
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>padrone</i>," she replied. "I saw her two hours ago,
before she was asleep."</p>

<p>Festini nodded.</p>

<p>"See her again now," he said, "I will go up with you."</p>

<p>Taking a lamp from the bracket in the narrow passage of the
house, the woman led the way upstairs, and Festini followed.</p>

<p>He waited outside the door whilst the woman unlocked it and
entered. He heard a smothered exclamation.</p>

<p>"Padrone!" cried the woman, wildly. "Padrone!"</p>

<p>He rushed into the room. The little bed in the corner was
empty. The window was open and three of the bars were missing.
Marjorie Meagh had gone!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; TILLIZINI
ADDRESSES THE HOUSE</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH it was past midnight the streets of
London were alive with people; shops were open, lights blazed
from windows which ordinarily would have been in darkness. The
motor services which carried the Londoner to and from his home
were still running; special editions of the evening papers were
on sale in the streets, and about the House of Commons, where
the crowd grew in intensity, they found a ready sale.</p>

<p>Between Whitehall and Victoria Street some thirty thousand
people had assembled, but the police had no difficulty in
controlling the assembly or in securing a passage way for the
constant stream of cars which were passing to and from the House
of Commons. The character of the crowd was an interesting one.
These were no idle sightseers, attracted by the chance of a
little excitement; it was the silk-hatted middle class of
England, overcoated, muffled, bespectacled, waiting patiently
for news which meant all the difference between life and death
to them.</p>

<p>For once in its history the House of Commons was sitting in
secret session. At eleven o'clock that night, by the Speaker's
direction, the galleries had been cleared, and strangers had
been excluded, not only from the lobby, but from the precincts
of the House. Parliament had resolved itself into a National
Jury.</p>

<p>At five minutes after twelve a great car, covered with dust,
came slowly along Whitehall. It bore three small lamps on its
radiator, arranged in the form of a triangle. Unchallenged the
car passed Bridge Street and into Palace Yard. About the
entrance of the House were a crowd of policemen, but they made a
way for the tall man in the dusty coat who sprang from the seat
by the side of the driver. Two men were waiting for him; Hilary
George, M.P., was one, and Inspector Crocks the other.</p>

<p>The three passed into the interior of the House and made
their way to a small Committee room which had been prepared for
them.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Crocks. His face was of an unusual pallor, and
he spoke with the irritability which is peculiar to the man
undergoing a great nervous strain.</p>

<p>Tillizini slowly divested himself of his great coat, laid it
across a chair, and walked to the fire. He stood for a while,
warming his hands at the blaze; then he spoke.</p>

<p>"I have located them," he said, "definitely."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Crocks.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt?" asked Hilary. Tillizini shook his head.
He took a book from his inside pocket, opened it, and extracted
three slips of paper. They were advertisements cut from a
newspaper of the week before.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, "whether you have noticed
these?"</p>

<p>They bent over the table, the three heads together, reading
the advertisement.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," said Hilary; "this is an
advertisement offering good prices for pigeons." He examined the
other. "This is the same," he said.</p>

<p>"They're all the same," said Tillizini, quietly. "Do you
notice that they advertise that they want old pigeons?"</p>

<p>Hilary nodded.</p>

<p>"The address is at a place in London. The man who advertised
had thousands of replies, and has made thousands of purchases,
too. Throughout the week basket after basket of birds has come
consigned to him at the various London termini; they have been
collected by the agents of the 'Red Hand' and forwarded to
Festini."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Crocks, puzzled. "He's not going to start a
pigeon-shooting competition?"</p>

<p>Tillizini laughed. He had walked back to the fire and was
bending over it, his hands almost touching the flames.</p>

<p>"If you will believe me," he said, "I have been looking for
that advertisement for quite a long time." He straightened
himself and stood with his back to the fire, his hands behind
him. Then he asked suddenly: "How is the 'Red Hand' to
distribute the germs of this plague? Has that thought ever
occurred to you? How can they, without danger to themselves,
spread broadcast the seeds of the Black Death?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" said Hilary, as the significance of the move
suddenly dawned upon him.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," Tillizini went on, "if the Premier's
reply is unfavourable, they will release these thousands of
pigeons, and release also, in a portable form, sufficient of the
culture to spread death in whichever neighbourhood the pigeon
lands. Naturally, being old birds, they will fly straight back
to the homes they have left. It is very ingenious. They might of
course have done the same thing by post, but there was a certain
amount of risk attached to that. The present method is one which
would appeal to Festini. I arrested a man this afternoon who has
been collecting the birds. He is obviously one of the 'Red
Hand,' though he protests against such an imputation."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" asked Hilary. "You had better see the
Prime Minister at once."</p>

<p>The door opened and a young man came in hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Is Professor Tillizini here?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hilary indicated the detective.</p>

<p>"Will you come at once, Professor? The Prime Minister wishes
you to stand at the bar of the House to explain to the
honourable members exactly the position."</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>He followed his conductor along the broad corridor, across
the lobby, through two swing doors. He suddenly found himself in
a large chamber; it gave him the impression of being dimly
lighted. On either side he saw row after row of faces rising in
tiers. At the further end, behind a big table surmounted by a
gold mace, sat a wigged and gowned figure on a canopied chair.
Near the table on his left a man rose and spoke to the Speaker.
Tillizini could not hear the words he said. The moment
afterwards the grave figure in the wig and gown invited him
forward.</p>

<p>Tillizini knew something of the august character of this
legislative assembly; he knew, since it was his business to
know, with what jealousy it guarded its doors against the
unelected stranger, and he experienced a feeling of unreality as
he walked along the floor of the House and made his way, at the
invitation of the Premier's beckoning finger, to a place on the
Front Bench.</p>

<p>The House was in silence. A faint murmur of "Hear, Hear," had
greeted him, but that had died away. A strange figure he made,
still powdered with the fine dust of the road, unshaven,
grimy.</p>

<p>He sank down on the cushioned bench by the Premier's side,
and looked with curious eyes at the Mother of Parliaments.</p>

<p>Amidst dead silence the Prime Minister rose and addressed the
Speaker.</p>

<p>"Mr. Speaker," he said, "it is within my province, had I so
desired, to have asked you to vacate the chair and for the House
to resolve itself into a Committee. Under those circumstances we
should have had extensive powers, one such power being our right
to summon any stranger before us to give evidence.</p>

<p>"But the time is so very short, and the issues are so very
serious, that I have asked you to rule, as an extraordinary
ruling, that Professor Tillizini be allowed to address the House
from this place."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister sat down, and the bearded man in the chair
looked at Tillizini, and nodded again. For a moment the
professor did not understand its significance; then a whispered
word from the Premier at his side brought him to his feet, a
little embarrassed, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>He spoke hesitatingly, halting now and then for a word,
thanking the House for its indulgence and for the remarkable
privilege it had granted him.</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister," he went on, "has asked me to give you a
brief outline of the history of the 'Red Hand.' He thinks, and I
agree, that you should be made fully aware of one fact only that
the 'Red Hand' threatens to perform."</p>

<p>For five minutes he traced the history of the organization;
its growth from the famous Three Finger Society of Sicily; he
spoke briefly of its crimes, both on the Continent and in
America, for he had the details at his finger-tips, and he
himself had been engaged in unravelling many of the mysteries
which had surrounded the work of these men.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said, "what plans this Parliament has
formed for ridding the country of so dangerous and so terrible a
force. No plan," he spoke earnestly and emphatically, and
punctuated his speech with characteristic gestures, "which you
may decide upon, can be effective unless it includes some system
of physical extermination. I do not make myself clear, perhaps,"
he said, hurriedly, "although I have a very large acquaintance
with your language." He emphasized his point with one finger on
the palm of his hand. "These men are going to destroy you and
your kind. Believe me, they will have no compunction; the plague
will be spread throughout England unless you take the most
drastic steps within the next few hours. There is no existing
law on the statute books which exactly provides for the present
situation. You must create a new method to deal with a new
crime, and, Mr. Speaker, whatever this House does, whatever
steps it takes, however dreadful may be the form of punishment
which it, in its wisdom, may devise, it cannot be too drastic or
too severe to deal with the type of criminal organization which
the 'Red Hand' represents. I can, if I wish," he said, with a
smile, "arrest fifty members of the 'Red Hand' to-night. I
could, with a little care, succeed in assassinating
Festini."</p>

<p>He spoke in a matter-of-fact tone, as though assassination
were everyday work, and a little shiver ran through the House.
He was sensible to such undefinable impressions in others.</p>

<p>"You do not like the word?" he said, with a smile, "and
neither do I. I used it because I felt that it was a word which
would be more in keeping with the facts from your point of view.
To me, some removals are justified; they are more, they are
necessary. One must meet cunning with cunning, crime with crime.
The law does not adequately meet all modern crime, even the
English law. Science has produced a new type of criminal; but
the modern parliaments of the world have not as yet devised a
new type of punishment. The criminal code requires drastic
revisions, as drastic as those which it received when it erased
from its statute book such awful and vindictive punishments as
were accorded to sheep-stealers."</p>

<p>He went on to tell as much of his later discoveries as he
felt it was expedient to announce to the House. He could never
overcome his suspicion of crowds. The House of Commons, with its
serried ranks of members, was a crowd to him, an intellectual, a
sympathetic and brilliant crowd, but a crowd nevertheless, which
might contain, for aught he knew, one man who would betray his
plans to the enemy.</p>

<p>The House gasped when told the story of the pigeons.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that you have an Act in
contemplation; the terms of that Act have been briefly
communicated to me, and I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, and the
members of this House, that there is no provision in that
measure which is not justified by the circumstances. Within
seven days," he said, solemnly, "this country will be ravaged by
the most malignant form of epidemic disease that has been known
in modern history. The horrors of the great plague of London
will be multiplied, the ports of every foreign country will be
closed to your commerce; you will be shunned by every
grain-bearing ship that sails the sea.</p>

<p>"You are face to face, not only with death in its most
terrible form, but with starvation, with anarchy, with civil war
perhaps. And yet, knowing this, I tell you that you would be
false to your great traditions if you paid one single penny to
this infamous confederacy."</p>

<p>He sat down amidst a murmured cheer.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he had walked out behind the Speaker's
chair, and was in the Prime Minister's sitting-room. That
statesman came in soon afterwards.</p>

<p>"The Act will pass to-night," he said; "the Lords are
sitting, and I hope to get the Assent early in the morning. Can
you rest to-night, Professor?"</p>

<p>Tillizini shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is no rest for me to-night," he said.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. The hands pointed a quarter after
twelve. An attendant brought in a tray with coffee. After he had
retired, the Prime Minister asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are satisfied with such steps as we have taken?"</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think the number will be sufficient."</p>

<p>"We have sent four infantry brigades by route march to-night,"
said the Premier. "The cavalry and artillery are coming
from Colchester."</p>

<p>"The destroyers?" asked Tillizini.</p>

<p>"They left Chatham at sunset to-night with orders to steam
slowly up the river." Tillizini nodded again.</p>

<p>"There will be one waiting for you at Tilbury," said the
Prime Minister, "that was in accordance with your wishes."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tillizini entered his car, wrapped in his
great coat, and the great Mercedes sped noiselessly out through
the guarded gate, through the press of people in Whitehall, into
Trafalgar Square, then turned to the right along the Strand. It
slowed down to pass a market van, which had emerged from the
street leading from Waterloo Bridge. As it did so a man walked
quickly from the sidewalk and leapt on to the footboard of the
car.</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged man, poorly dressed, and he was
apparently Italian, for it was in that language he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Signor Tillizini?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tillizini, in the same language.</p>

<p>The man made no reply. His hand went up with a lightning
jerk. Before his fingers had closed on the trigger, Tillizini's
had grasped the pistol near the trigger guard, He half rose to
his feet and, with a quick swing of his body such as wrestlers
employ, he pulled the man into the car. It was all over in a
second. Before the passers-by and the loungers about the
sidewalk realized what had happened, the man was in the car, his
pistol reposed in Tillizini's pocket, and the Italian
detective's foot was pressing lightly but suggestively on his
throat.</p>

<p>"Keep very still," said Tillizini, bending over. "Put your
hands up, so."</p>

<p>The man obeyed with a whimper of pain; then something hard
and cold snapped around his wrists.</p>

<p>"Now you may sit up," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>He dragged the man to his feet and threw him into a corner
seat. From his breast pocket he produced a little electric lamp
and flashed it in the man's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Tillizini, with a little laugh. "I think I
have seen you before."</p>

<p>He recognized him as one of the many thousand of agents which
the "Red Hand" possessed.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me, Signor?" asked the man
sullenly.</p>

<p>"That I will tell you later," replied the other.</p>

<p>In the East India Dock Road he stopped the car at a
police-station and bundled the captive out. The inspector was
inclined to resent the spectacle of a strange-looking foreign
gentleman hauling a handcuffed compatriot into the charge-room.
But at a word from Tillizini he became obsequiousness
itself.</p>

<p>"Search him," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>He unlocked the handcuffs, a pair of his own, and two
constables, with scientific deftness born of experience, made a
quick but careful examination of the man's possessions. He
seemed to be well supplied with money, Tillizini noticed; he had
no papers of any kind. A pencil and two stamps and some
unaddressed telegraph forms, comprised the sum of his
property.</p>

<p>Tillizini carried the telegraph forms to the inspector's desk
and examined them carefully. They were innocent of address or
writing, but he saw impressions which showed that another
telegram had been written on top of one of them with pencil. He
looked at it closely but he could detect nothing. From his
pocket he took a soft crayon and gently rubbed the impression
over. Gradually the words came to light. The address was
unintelligible. It had evidently been written upon a harder
substance. There were two words in Italian, and Tillizini had
little difficulty in deciphering them.</p>

<p>"Lisa goes," he read.</p>

<p>He looked at the man.</p>

<p>"Who is Lisa?" he asked. But before the prisoner could shake
his head in pretended ignorance, Tillizini knew, and smothered
an exclamation that came to his lips.</p>

<p>Vera had gone to her sometime lover. Here was a complication
indeed.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; MARJORIE CROSSES
THE MARSH</h2>

<p class="first">MARJORIE had retired for the night at eleven
o'clock. She had given up an attempt to bar the door against
intruders, for her efforts to barricade herself in had been
resented by the woman, and, moreover, they had been so
ineffectual as to render the attempt a waste of time and
energy.</p>

<p>The house boasted one storey, the ground and the first floor;
her room was on the upper floor at the back of the house. It had
been chosen partly for the reason that it was undoubtedly the
most habitable of the apartments which the ramshackle dwelling
boasted, and partly because from this position she could see
little or nothing of the movements of those members of the "Red
Hand" who were engaged in the nefarious work of preparing the
culture.</p>

<p>The night was an unusually clear one, and when, after half an
hour of sleeplessness, she arose to escape from the tumult of
thought which assailed her, her steps turned instinctively to
the one outlet upon the world which the room afforded. She leant
her arms on the old-fashioned window-sill and looked wistfully
out to the twinkling points of light upon the river.</p>

<p>No sound broke the stillness of the night, the house was
wrapped in silence. Now and then there came to her the faint
echo of a siren farther down the river. She stood for some time,
and then, with a shiver, realized that the night was by no means
warm.</p>

<p>Festini and his servants had provided her with a long black
cloak. She took it down from its peg on the wall and wrapped it
about her. Her fingers were still busy with the fastening at her
throat, when a little sharp, metallic tap at the window made her
turn with a start.</p>

<p>Her heart beat quickly as she stood motionless, watching. She
waited nearly a minute before it came again. It was as though
somebody were at the window.... There could be nobody there, she
told herself. She walked softly to the window and opened it. The
bars had been so placed that they came almost flush with the
brickwork. It was impossible for her to see who stood directly
below.</p>

<p>She waited a little while longer and heard a hiss. She stood
back. She did not know why, but it seemed that the unknown was
warning her. Then something fell on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>She stooped and ran her hand lightly along the uncarpeted
boards. Presently she found what she sought. It was a little
pebble, but she was led to it by catching her fingers in a thin
piece of twine, and by and by she had drawn up to the window a
piece of thicker string.</p>

<p>She understood its meaning now. Rapidly she drew it in. There
was a heavier weight at the end of it, and presently she came
upon a stout, closely-woven hemp rope. This was the end of the
series. Somebody on the ground without held the rope with gentle
firmness.</p>

<p>Her hands trembling with excitement, she knotted the end
about one of the bars of the window, and felt the man outside
test the strength of it. Again and again he pulled as she
watched anxiously the amateur knots she had tied.</p>

<p>To her delight they showed no signs of slipping.</p>

<p>The rope went taut again. There was a steady strain on it.
She heard no sound, and it was with a startling suddenness that
the bare head of a man appeared above the window-sill; he
reached up and clasped a bar and came to rest sitting lightly on
the ledge without.</p>

<p>"Don't make a sound," he whispered. He went to work
methodically. The bars had been screwed on to a square of wood
fitted into the window space, stapled and morticed into the
brickwork itself.</p>

<p>She could not see his face, and he spoke too low for her
ordinarily to recognize his voice; but this was Tillizini, and
she knew it. He lost no time. A little electric lamp showed him
the method by which the bars were fastened. They had been
screwed on from the outside, sufficient security for the girl
within, though offering no serious obstacle to a man armed with
a screwdriver without.</p>

<p>Tillizini worked at fever heat. Clinging on to one bar, with
one of his thin legs thrust through into the room, he had two
bars out in ten minutes.</p>

<p>As he removed them he handed them to the girl, and she placed
them quietly upon the bed.</p>

<p>He stepped lightly into the room, re-tied the rope to one of
the remaining bars, fastened one end about her waist, and
assisted her through the window.</p>

<p>"Stay at the bottom until I come," he said.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait; whilst her fingers were still
unfastening the knot around her waist Tillizini was coming down
the rope hand over hand.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he whispered. He disappeared into the darkness in the
direction of the shed. Piled up alongside was basket after
basket of a pattern. He walked swiftly along, unfastening the
trap-fronts as he did so. Soon it would be light, and at the
first sign of dawn the pigeons would begin their homeward
flight. He returned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Move very slowly," he whispered, "and follow me."</p>

<p>They crouched down, and almost at a crawl crossed the big
yard, the limits of which were still defined. They gained the
marsh which lay between them and the river.</p>

<p>Still Tillizini showed no signs of abandoning his caution,
and the girl, cramped and aching from her unaccustomed
exertions, wondered why he still moved almost on hands and knees
when the danger seemed to be past.</p>

<p>The ground underfoot was swampy, with every step she went
ankle deep into liquid mud, she was breathing with difficulty,
and her back ached with an intolerable, nagging pain. She felt
she could go no farther; it seemed to her that she had been
moving for hours across miles of country, although, in fact, she
had not gone two hundred yards from the house, when Tillizini
stopped, and motioned her forward.</p>

<p>"Stay here," he whispered.</p>

<p>Although the marsh was apparently a dead level, there were
little hummocks and rises at irregular intervals, and toward one
of the former he moved stealthily.</p>

<p>She thought she saw the black figure of a man sitting on the
one dry space in the marsh, but fancy plays strange tricks on a
dark and starless night, and her heart had beaten wildly a dozen
times during that agonizing crawl at imaginary figures
contesting her way of escape.</p>

<p>The man on the hummock was no figment of imagination,
however; he sat cross-legged like a tailor, a big sheep-skin rug
about his shoulders, a long-barrelled revolver on his knee.</p>

<p>The duty of outpost in this direction had fallen to Gregorio,
the sour-faced man who had aroused Festini's anger earlier
during the day.</p>

<p>The "Red Hand" had established a system of sentries to
preclude any surprises, and from where he sat Gregorio could
keep a clear lookout upon the river approaches to the house.</p>

<p>He sat wide awake and alert, his fingers touching the trigger
of his revolver. All this Tillizini guessed rather than saw. He
knew that any act of violence, unless it was unexpected and
deadly, would produce an alarm. The bold way was the only means
possible. He rose and straightened himself, and went squelching
forward across the oozy ground.</p>

<p>Gregorio heard him and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he asked, softly.</p>

<p>"It is I, Brother," said Tillizini in Italian.</p>

<p>He yawned.</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong?" asked Gregorio, peering forward in the
darkness to distinguish the newcomer.</p>

<p>Tillizini's answer was to yawn again loudly and prodigiously,
as one who had been recently wakened from his proper sleep and
had reluctantly obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>His yawn extended for the half a dozen paces that separated
him from the sentry.</p>

<p>Gregorio had no suspicion. His finger mechanically went from
the trigger to the butt of the revolver, which now hung loosely
at his side.</p>

<p>"What d&mdash;?" he began again.</p>

<p>Then like a bolt from a crossbow Tillizini launched himself
at the man's throat. His left hand gripped the revolver, he
wrenched it from the man's hand. In that motion he had him by
the throat, and the two men were rolling on the ground.</p>

<p>The sentry's yell for help was strangled in his throat.</p>

<p>Marjorie, a dozen yards away, kneeling in the cold marsh with
clasped hands and parted lips, heard the sound of the struggle
and heard, too, a stifled cry, and then a silence.</p>

<p>A few seconds later Tillizini came back to her.</p>

<p>"You may get up," he said softly, "there is no need for any
further concealment."</p>

<p>He gave her his arm and assisted the half-fainting girl the
remainder of the journey.</p>

<p>At the water's edge he found the little Canadian canoe that
had carried him across the river, and helped her into it. He
followed, and, seizing his paddle, with two strokes he sent the
little craft swiftly into the stream.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">FESTINI stared dumbfounded at the window. He
saw the dangling rope, and knew in what deadly peril he
stood.</p>

<p>The girl had been rescued from the outside; he saw the bars
laid on the bed, and the little heap of twine and cord beneath
the window told its own story.</p>

<p>With a curse of rage he ran from the room.</p>

<p>In a moment he had the house roused.</p>

<p>In the rooms below a dozen trusted members of the "Red Hand"
were sleeping; another dozen were out watching the roads.</p>

<p>"They cannot have gone far," said Festini. "On your life see
that they are captured."</p>

<p>He himself went with a man in the direction of the river, the
most likely way of escape. He knew every position his scouts
occupied, and he half walked and half ran through the clogging
marsh to where Gregorio had been posted. He was the most
reliable of all the men who were on duty.</p>

<p>He came to the foot of the little hummock, and called
softly.</p>

<p>Gregorio made no reply.</p>

<p>Festini ran up the gentle slope. He flashed his lamp over a
prostrate form.</p>

<p>"Turn him over," he said calmly.</p>

<p>He looked down at the dead man's face, and a weary foreboding
of defeat oppressed him. Without a word he turned and walked
slowly back to the house.</p>

<p>Every step he took said, "Tillizini! Tillizini!
Tillizini!"</p>

<p>This was the end. He knew it. His mind was less occupied with
thoughts of escape than with a riot of plans to make his exit
memorable.</p>

<p>The Premier had refused.</p>

<p>He did not require the arrival of a messenger to tell him
that. Tillizini had located the laboratory, that fact was
evident. How, Festini could not guess, but the last card of the
"Red Hand" was not played. He had still the germs of this
terrible disease. They themselves would be the first victims and
leave behind their dreadful heritage to humanity.</p>

<p>He wondered why the professor had not struck at him. Surely
at this, the eleventh hour, he felt no compunction? Festini
dismissed the possibility with a smile. He knew the breed too
well to imagine that pity or any tender sentiment could
influence the anthropologist.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the girl. She explained all. It would be
Tillizini's first care to place her in safety.</p>

<p>He left word that the guard should be narrowed to a smaller
circle about the house. He went to his room, searched his
pockets and found letters which he had no desire should fall
into the hands of the enemy. He burnt them, and sat down to the
table to write a letter. He was in the midst of this when Il Bue
came in.</p>

<p>"Our men have found a woman," he said.</p>

<p>"A woman!" Festini jumped to his feet, his eyes kindling.</p>

<p>"It is not your lady, Signor," said the man, and the other's
heart sank like a plummet.</p>

<p>"Where did you find her? What was she doing?"</p>

<p>"Making her way to the house," said Il Bue.</p>

<p>"Bring her here."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the man returned and ushered a woman into
the room.</p>

<p>Festini, dapper and handsome in his well-fitting greatcoat,
his feet covered with the mud of the marsh, stood, his hand
resting on the bare table, an electric reading-lamp the only
illumination the room possessed.</p>

<p>It was innocent of furniture; save for the dull glow of the
fire in the broken hearth, it was cheerless. The damp had
stripped the walls of its paper, there was an indefinable air of
decay in the room.</p>

<p>The woman standing in the doorway took all this in as she
advanced slowly towards him, her eyes fixed on his face.</p>

<p>"Vera!" he gasped, and stared.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Let your man go away," she said.</p>

<p>At a sign from Festini the big man withdrew, closing the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"Why have you come? How did you get here? How did you know I
was here?" He fired the questions at her.</p>

<p>She made no reply, taking off her long fur coat
deliberately.</p>

<p>"I have come," she said at last, "to be with you at the great
moment."</p>

<p>His brows knit. "What do you mean?" he said.</p>

<p>"You are doomed, Festini. I discovered it last night. Sir
Ralph had confidential information from the Government, ordering
him to be present at the end."</p>

<p>"'The end'?" he repeated. "I don't understand. When is the
end to be?"</p>

<p>"To-day," she answered steadily.</p>

<p>"But you, you," he said, "why have you come?"</p>

<p>She did not speak for a moment, her eyes were still fixed on
his.</p>

<p>"I have served you well," she said slowly, "let me serve you
to the end."</p>

<p>"But there may be danger for you."</p>

<p>"There will be danger," she said.</p>

<p>"I cannot allow this; go back to your friends. Leave me to
fight this out alone."</p>

<p>She shook her head with a little smile.</p>

<p>"We fight this out together, Festini. I have come to stay.
They have traced you."</p>

<p>"Tillizini?" he asked, without resentment. She nodded.</p>

<p>"He saw your car in town, suspected you, fastened a band to
the wheel. That band bore a particular mark. I did not know this
until last night. The police all over the country have been
examining the roads for signs of that car. Tillizini did the
rest."</p>

<p>"I see. What is happening?"</p>

<p>"The place is surrounded," she said.</p>

<p>"Surrounded?" he did not raise his voice. He was not,
apparently, alarmed. He put the question eagerly; it seemed to
her that his interest in the method which had been employed to
trap him was greater than any dread of the consequence.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>She led him to the window of the room. It was on the opposite
side of the house to that which Marjorie had been confined, and
commanded an uninterrupted view of the country for six or seven
miles. The overnight mists had cleared away and it was a calm,
still night. The low hills of the horizon could be easily
distinguished.</p>

<p>He saw a sprinkling of lights that were familiar to him. They
were the lights of a hamlet, two miles distant, and at intervals
a flickering gleam told him where the road lay.</p>

<p>They watched in silence. Then, of a sudden, they saw a new
light. It was whiter than the others; it flickered three times,
and was dark. Flickered again with irregular intervals, and kept
winking and winking, as though it were a candle blown by the
wind.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that is a signal lamp. Are there
soldiers?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"There are a dozen regiments on this side alone," she
said.</p>

<p>"Infantry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "and horse soldiers, and I saw guns
coming through Witham."</p>

<p>"And on the river side?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think they have some torpedo boats. They came up from
Chatham last night."</p>

<p>He walked round to the other side of the house, but could see
nothing. He went back to his room and found a pair of night
glasses, and searched the river with a long and steady
scrutiny.</p>

<p>Then he distinguished the low-lying hulls of the destroyers,
anchored in midstream, their lights out&mdash;no sign of
life.</p>

<p>He nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, for the second time. "Come back with
me."</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder affectionately, and she
thrilled at the touch.</p>

<p>She had not asked about Marjorie, but now the thought
occurred to her. He divined it before she spoke.</p>

<p>"The girl is gone," he said. "Tillizini released her less
than half an hour ago; he also released some pigeons," he said,
with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>He told her what had happened.</p>

<p>"I think it is best," she said, gravely.</p>

<p>There was no resentment in her heart against his treachery,
nor did he feel it necessary to explain his act, or express his
contrition.</p>

<p>Those two had much in common&mdash;as he had always realized.
They took things for granted.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, after he had sat at the table, his head
in his hands, deep in thought, "there is no question of
surrender?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"They will accept no surrender," she said. "They have come to
exterminate you. They dare not take you for fear of your
disseminating the plague."</p>

<p>"They are very wise," he said; "but yet I think...."</p>

<p>He bit his knuckles thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he began again, then shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>He walked with a firm step to the door and called in Il Bue.
In a few words he made the position clear.</p>

<p>"Get the rifles out of the cellar," he said, "and serve out
ammunition to the men. We are going to make a fight for it, but
I tell you there is no chance of escape. The least we can do is
to leave behind a little souvenir of our earnestness and <i>bona
fides</i>."</p>

<p>When the man had gone, he turned to Vera. "Dear," he said,
gently, "you must go back."</p>

<p>"I have come to stay," she said. "I want no better end than
this."</p>

<p>He looked at her thoughtfully, tenderly. Then he took her
face in both his hands, and kissed her on the lips.</p>

<p>"As you will," he said; "it will strengthen me as nothing
else could strengthen me, to have you by me."</p>

<p>He kissed her again, and her head fell on his shoulder, her
arms stole about his neck.</p>

<p>She was happy. Whatever other joys life had held for her,
they were as nothing to this.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">An hour before dawn Festini left the woman who
had braved so much for him, and went the rounds. A new sentry
had been posted in the place of Gregorio. Festini was returning
and crossing the room which had served as a common room and
office for the band, when the tinkle of a bell held him. He
turned back.</p>

<p>He had had the house connected by telephone, but an hour
before the arrival of Tillizini, though he did not know this,
the wires had been cut. He walked to the instrument and took
down the receiver. Was it possible that by some chance they had
overlooked the wire, and that he could communicate with the
agents of the "Red Hand" in London? The thought had not occurred
to him before, but at the first word which reached him his lips
curled in an ironic smile.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Festini?" said the voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Count, "my friend Tillizini, I think?"</p>

<p>"It is I," said the voice calmly. "Have you nothing to say to
me?"</p>

<p>Festini bent his head. For a long time he remained
silent.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," he said. "You have won and I have
lost; that is too obvious to need any labouring."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>Festini thought he detected a note of sadness.</p>

<p>"Nothing else," he replied firmly. "What can I say? Except
that I lose with a good heart. After all, I have so frequently
laid down my creed in regard to such trivial matters as life and
death, that even now, confronting the supreme crisis of my life,
I can find no more comforting thought than that creed
offers."</p>

<p>He heard Tillizini's voice break into a little laugh; a low,
amused, yet despairing little laugh.</p>

<p>"How like you, Festini!" he said. "How like you!"</p>

<p>"What else?" asked the Count. "You did not expect me to
recant or to offer you terms? You would have despised me as much
as I should despise you if you proffered me a way of escape. I
suppose," he asked, "you are speaking from some place of
security?"</p>

<p>"I am speaking from one of the destroyers," said the other.
"We have tapped your wire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is cut, I presume," said Festini, coolly.</p>

<p>"Which is cut," repeated the other. "What of Vera?" asked
Tillizini suddenly.</p>

<p>"I would rather not discuss that," said Festini, a little
haughtily.</p>

<p>"She is with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is here," replied Festini, after a little
hesitation. "In justice to myself, I have tried to persuade her
to go back. I can conduct her outside these lines without any
difficulty."</p>

<p>"And she refuses?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she refuses," said Festini. "And I think it is better
so."</p>

<p>He stood with his elbow against the wall, his feet crossed;
one who was not acquainted with the circumstances might have
thought he was conducting a very ordinary and commonplace
conversation, which involved more than ordinary thought, but
that had not more than ordinary consequences.</p>

<p>There was another long silence, which Festini broke.</p>

<p>"In all your philosophy, Tillizini," he said, "and I concede
you a vast and interesting knowledge of human affairs, has it
ever occurred to you how wonderful a thing is a woman? Put out
of your mind the passions and the follies of life, and come down
to the essentials and the utilitarian part of existence. Is
there anything so devoted, so self-effacing, so purely noble? I
think," Tillizini heard him laugh&mdash;a bright, happy, joyous
laugh&mdash;"I think that all the bother and stress and scheming
of my life, all the crime, as you would call it, all the
endeavour and disappointment was worth this: here is my reward,
probably more tangible and beautiful than the ten millions we
ask from your Government&mdash;by the way, I suppose they have
adopted you now?" he added, mockingly.</p>

<p>"It is worth much," said Tillizini.</p>

<p>"It is worth all," said Festini, and his voice vibrated;
"without this philosophy is futile, life has been wasted."</p>

<p>There was another long pause.</p>

<p>"You have nothing else to say?" asked Tillizini.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Festini. "Nothing more than I have said. Is
not that enough?" he asked. "What a glutton you are, Tillizini,"
he bantered him. "What do you desire&mdash;a tearful repentance?
An admission of my manifold sins and wickednesses? A plea for
mercy? King's Evidence?" He laughed again. "You never expected
that, my friend?"</p>

<p>"No, I never expected that," said Tillizini's voice. "I don't
know exactly what I did expect. I think that is all."</p>

<p>"I will say <i>au revoir</i>," said Festini.</p>

<p>"Farewell," said the other's voice suddenly.</p>

<p>There was such a long wait now that Festini thought the other
must have hung up his receiver.</p>

<p>He was on the point of following his example, when
Tillizini's voice spoke again.</p>

<p>"And <i>bon voyage</i>!" it said.</p>

<p>Festini laughed, and the receivers clicked together.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE WORKING OF THE
ACT</h2>

<p class="first">THE dawn came up greyly over Essex.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Morte-Mannery, wrapped in furs, dozing in his car,
was awakened by the arrival of a pannikin of coffee.</p>

<p>A young officer, great-coated to his ears, held the carriage
door open, and smilingly offered it to the other.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it isn't much, Sir Ralph," he said, "but it is
all we can give you."</p>

<p>"Is it time?" asked Sir Ralph.</p>

<p>"Nearly," said the other.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph sipped the coffee, and, handing the cup to the
waiting orderly, stepped out of the carriage on to the road.</p>

<p>Left and right he saw troops standing under arms&mdash;
khaki-clad infantry men&mdash;line upon line of them. Behind, on a
rise, the horses of a field battery were being harnessed to the
limbers. In the centre of the river the grim little destroyers
lay anchored, a cable's length from one another, and were
swinging with the tide.</p>

<p>In the centre of the flat green plain was a house. A long,
low-roofed shed was in close proximity. There was no sign of
life save for the lazy smoke which rose from the one chimney of
the house.</p>

<p>Two mounted officers came cantering up to where the knight
stood. One saluted him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sir Ralph; your justices are waiting."</p>

<p>He dismounted, and handing the horse to a waiting soldier,
the two men walked along the road.</p>

<p>They reached the line of soldiers which were nearest to the
house. A long table had been set up in the centre of the
road&mdash;a table covered with green baize, which was set about
by a heterogeneous collection of chairs, commandeered from the
neighbouring village.</p>

<p>A man in a tall hat and a fur coat was pacing up and down as
Sir Ralph came up. He turned and raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Sir Ralph Morte-Mannery," he said, formally, "I am
commissioned by His Majesty's Government to hand you a copy of
the Act which was passed last night by the House of Commons and
which has received the Assent in the early hours of this
morning."</p>

<p>He handed the document to Sir Ralph, who took it with a
little bow.</p>

<p>"You will find yourself specified here as the Commissioner to
execute the provisions of this Act."</p>

<p>Sir Ralph opened the envelope and took out four
closely-printed sheets of paper.</p>

<p>They bore the inscription&mdash;"The Preservation of Law
Act."</p>

<p>He read the preamble. It was an Act which had been called
into existence by the danger which threatened England. He came
to that part which defined the Commissioner's duties, and
mastered it. Then he stood up by the table, and four men took
their places, two on either side.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph removed his hat, and faced the gloomy house.</p>

<p>He read from the document in his hand, and his voice was a
little shrill and shaky.</p>

<p>Frank Gallinford, standing a little apart with Tillizini,
watched the extraordinary scene with breathless interest. The
sense of the tragedy of that moment oppressed him.</p>

<p>He heard the knight's voice quiver as he read the short
sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>".... Whereas I, Ralph Morte-Mannery, His Majesty's
Commissioner, by this Act appointed, declare all those persons
who at present inhabit and sojourn in the place known as
Falley's Wharf, in the county of Essex, are persons without
benefit of Law, and whereas I declare them to be guilty of a
crime, which by this Act is specified as deserving of the
punishment of death, now I, by virtue of the power and authority
vested in me do pass upon them all, jointly and severally, the
sentence which the Law demands, that they shall be shot until
they are dead, and their bodies shall afterwards be
burnt...."</p>

<p>His voice broke a little. When he had finished reading they
saw his lips moving as if in prayer.</p>

<p>Then from the house came the first challenge of the "Red
Hand."</p>

<p>There was a distant "click-clock," and Sir Ralph pitched
forward over the table&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Festini had seen the ceremony, and guessed its import. He was
an excellent marksman....</p>

<p>For twenty-five minutes the fight raged. The Infantry, by
short rushes occupying every scrap of cover which the flat plain
offered, opened a vigorous fire upon the shed.</p>

<p>Three minutes after the infantry attack had begun the 73rd
Battery of the Field Artillery came into action. And
simultaneously the destroyers began dropping their tiny shells
into the doomed house.</p>

<p>But the "Red Hand" died hard. Shot after shot came from the
building. The hut was in flames&mdash;part of the house itself
was shot away, exposing its bare interior.</p>

<p>Then Frank gripped Tillizini's arm.</p>

<p>"My God!" he said. "Look!"</p>

<p>On the roof-top two figures had suddenly appeared&mdash;a man
and a woman. The man stood calmly regarding the destructive host
that was advancing before him. The woman, Frank saw through his
glasses, had her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Frank reeled back.</p>

<p>"It's Vera!" he gasped.</p>

<p>Tillizini nodded.</p>

<p>"So it seems," he said. "She is a greater woman than I
thought."</p>

<p>That was his only comment.</p>

<p>They stood there&mdash;a mark for all&mdash;but the presence
of the woman brought the rifles of the advancing soldiers down.
Unscathed they stood. They saw Festini's hand go up in defiance.
Then he suddenly tumbled and swayed.</p>

<p>The woman sprang to his side and caught him, holding him
close to her breast.</p>

<p>What was plain to be seen by the land force was hidden from
the men on the torpedo boats.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;right above her head&mdash;a shrapnel shell
burst&mdash;and the two, clasped in one another's arms, sank out
of sight as the roof of the burning building collapsed.</p>

<p>Frank turned to Tillizini. The man's face was whiter than
usual, and his eyes were wide open, staring.</p>

<p>The Englishman could not speak; he wiped his streaming brow
with a handkerchief, and his hand was trembling.</p>

<p>"England owes you something, Professor Tillizini," said
Frank, aghast, looking with wonder at the silent figure.</p>

<p>Tillizini made no reply.</p>

<p>When, later in the day, weary and ill-looking, he presented
himself at the Premier's house and received the congratulations
which the Minister felt were his due, he was more inclined to
appraise the part he had played.</p>

<p>"The detection of this gang," said the Premier warmly, "and
the destruction of the most dangerous man in Europe, is due
entirely to you, Signor Tillizini. You have frustrated him at
every turn. It might almost seem," he smiled, "that you were
inside his mind and knew what he would do next."</p>

<p>"That is very likely," said Tillizini, absently. "I knew
Festini well, and his methods extremely well. I know something
of his boyhood&mdash;something of his parents&mdash;the
conditions of his life.</p>

<p>"Old Count Festini had two sons; the elder, for some reason
or other, he hated, the younger he petted and spoiled. Count
Festini had always been a leader in this type of organization.
It is said that he had pursued a vendetta for two hundred years.
The old man had put a period to it by destroying the last of the
opposition factors.</p>

<p>"It is not the fault of the man who died to-day," he said
slowly, "that he was what he was. He was reared and trained to
the work&mdash;was a ready and willing tool for the 'Red Hand,'
until by his very genius he became their master."</p>

<p>"What happened to the elder brother?" asked the Premier
curiously.</p>

<p>"I am the elder brother," said Tillizini, and he smiled, a
little crookedly.</p>
