<h2><a id="biblio">BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</a></h2>

<p class="first">The eight stories in this collection made their first appearance in 1919 under the series title "The Policy Sleuth" in <i>The Sunday Post</i>, a popular weekly newspaper published in Dundee, Scotland, by the DC Thomson Company. They were reprinted in 1921-1922 by the American <i>Argosy</i> magazine, some of them under different titles. In 1929 the stories were collected, edited and published in book form by the Readers Library Publishing Co., London, under the title "The Big Four."</p>

<p>The present RGL edition is based on this book. It also includes the <i>Argosy</i> versions of the first and third stories, from which the reader may gain an impression of the editorial changes made by the publishers of "The Big Four."</p>

<h2><a id="note">EDITOR'S NOTE</a></h2>

<p class="first">"The Big Four" is the big noise in the
underworld of International Crookdom. You must know that there
are in Europe four separate and distinct gangs of big men. They
generally work independently of one another but, on occasions,
they combine for their mutual benefit.</p>

<p>In this exciting book we have a detective perfectly and
fashionably "turned out." His presence bears the hallmark of
"good tone." In the opening pages we learn that he has just
returned from New York where he had been pursuing his interesting
and highly exciting calling. Along with his immaculate appearance
and his good looks he is possessed of immense audacity,
imperturbable coolness and cheek that are the usual stock-in-
trade of the successful detective.</p>

<p>He is at once appointed by the dour Scotsman at the head of
the Federated Assurances as a private detective attached to the
Company.</p>

<p class="firstblurb">There and then he plunges into a regular
maëlstrom of adventures.</p>

<p> It is on the track of the notorious "Big Four" that Mr.
Robert Brewer sets out.</p>

<p>His quest takes him to Monte Carlo in the winter, Ostend,
Goodwood, Cowes in the summer, and country houses in the autumn:
for these "Undesirables" follow the fashionable world just as the
sharks follow the liner&mdash;and for very much the same
reason.</p>

<p>The various characters that take part in the exciting and
thrilling adventures through which Bob Brewer passes until he
absolutely lands his fish into his net&mdash;a landing that is
unique both in its conception and execution&mdash;are all clearly
drawn and wonderfully interesting types; while some of the twists
and turns that he employs are as clever as anything Mr. Edgar
Wallace has ever invented.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Wallace we have already given biographical notes in
each of the previous books published by us. But, at any rate, we
may remind our readers that his knowledge of the underworld and
the methods of Scotland Yard are extraordinary. There is no
living writer so amazingly well-equipped in this respect.</p>

<p>Further, after serving as a soldier in the British army he
became a well-known figure in Fleet Street, and his journalistic
experiences, which were both "extensive and peculiar," have stood
him in good stead&mdash;for he saw life from many angles: from
the highest to the lowest grades of the social scale.</p>

<p>Of course, as is well known, his opinion on racing matters is
paramount.</p>

<h2><a id="story1a">Ia. &mdash; THE BIG FOUR SYNDICATE<br>
AND THE MAN WHO SMASHED IT</a></h2>

<h3>Original magazine title: "Reddy at Monte Carlo"</h3>

<p class="first">TO all outward appearance, Douglas Campbell was
a dour and possibly a short-tempered man of forty-eight, tall and
broad of shoulder. He had what women describe as a bad-tempered
face, since, through no fault of his own, his eyebrows met.</p>

<p>As chairman and general manager of the Federated Assurances it
was only right and proper that he should be credited with a total
absence of any sense of humour. He was, as all who have met him
will testify, a grave and serious man, who used precise language
cautiously.</p>

<p>He sat at his table one spring morning reading his
correspondence. Presently he put the letters down and looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"I am expecting Mr. Robert Brewer in a few minutes," he said.
"Show him straight in, and see that we are not interrupted."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said his secretary.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and the secretary took from the
hands of the clerk a visiting card.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Brewer," he said.</p>

<p>"Show him in," said Campbell, rising expectantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Brewer was young, perfectly and fashionably
attired, and carried in his very presence the hallmark of "good
tone." On his upper lip was a tiny well-regulated moustache; in
his right eye was a monocle; and about him generally was that air
of buoyant freshness which can only come from the consciousness
of youth.</p>

<p>He advanced to Campbell with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"My dear old Highlander, you're glad to see me!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," said Campbell. "Sit down. That
will do, Mr. George. You're looking very bright and beautiful
this morning."</p>

<p>"Aren't I?" said Mr. Bob Brewer delightedly. "Dear old thing,
I feel positively pretty. Now let us get down to business. I
gather you haven't brought me from New York to hand me
compliments."</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful man, Bob," said Campbell admiringly. "Man!
If I'd had half your cheek when I was your age, if I'd been half
as stuck on myself as you are, if I'd had just a little touch of
your coolness, audacity, and unscrupulousness, I'd have been a
millionaire!"</p>

<p>"Instead of which you are a two-millionaire," said Bob Brewer,
"whilst I'm a poor devil of an insurance detective, finding it
very hard to make both ends meet."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell drew up his chair close to the table, and lowered
his voice.</p>

<p>"Bob, the chairmen of three of our companies have advised our
sending to you. I represent six of the biggest insurance
companies in this country, mostly burglary, accident, and that
sort of thing. You know the kind of business. You've been
connected with it yourself."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"We insure society against their follies and carelessness,"
Mr. Campbell went on, "and, frankly, it hasn't paid. Bob, you've
heard about the sins of society? Well, I'll tell you what its
principal sin is&mdash;lack of grey matter. We've got the finest
and the best clients in Britain, the cream of the whole bunch.
Everybody with money and personal adornment is insured with us.
But, Bob, their trouble is that whilst they had enough brains to
get their money they haven't got enough to keep it.</p>

<p>"You know what they are," he went on. "They move like
automatons from one fashionable place to another, and they move
in a crowd like a flock of sheep. They're at Harrogate, they're
at Paris Plage, they're at Ostend in July, at Deauville at the
end of July, at Aix in the season, at Monte Carlo, at St. Moritz,
and only the happy fact that we've been at war with Germany
prevents them going to Wiesbaden at the proper time. Now, when
that army moves, Bob, there's another little army which follows
it. They're the camp followers, or scamp followers, or whatever
you like to call them. They're the parasites who live upon these
mugs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what vulgarity!" murmured Bob.</p>

<p>"They're mugs and nothing else," said Campbell. "If they
weren't mugs they'd be original. They'd go to St. Moritz in the
summer, and Ostend in the winter. But, as I was saying, there's a
young army of parasites that moves with them and lives on them,
and unless we want to go broke it's our job to frustrate their
knavish tricks, as the Old Book says."</p>

<p>"You're a whale on insurance, Campbell, but you're rather
short in the literary line. The clever little line you quote is
not, as you imagine, from the Old Book!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter where it's from," Campbell went on. "The
point is this&mdash;we've got to put a man on specially to watch
over these sheep, and see that they are not torn limb from limb
by the wolves. We are going to offer you a very big salary to
take this job on and give you permission to accept any private
commissions that may come your way. Is it a bet?"</p>

<p>"It all depends upon what your idea of a handsome salary is,"
said Bob with a little grin. "In the old days it used to be
somewhere in the region of £300 or £400 per annum."</p>

<p>"We are more broad-minded now," said Campbell, "and we never
talk under thousands."</p>

<p>Brewer looked at him and nodded.</p>

<p>"Take down the notice," he said, "I am engaged."</p>

<p>Campbell walked to the door and turned the key.</p>

<p>"I'll introduce you to the names of the king-bird of all the
birds of prey," he said; "he's the boss-man of the Big
Four&mdash;'Reddy' Smith."</p>

<p>Bob laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Reddy, eh?" he said; "why, I need no introduction to Reddy!
You couldn't live in the seams of New York City and not know
him."</p>

<p>"Does he know you?" asked the other quickly.</p>

<p>"He does not," replied Bob. "We've never met in the way of
business, but I know him. You see, in New York, I was on the
commercial side of insurance&mdash;trade frauds and that sort of
thing. Reddy was a con man, an advertisement faker. He used to
sell non-existent shares to the deluded agriculturists of the
Middle West. I have seen him at exercise in a prison yard, but I
doubt if he knows me. As a matter of fact, I was on his track
about a year ago, before he sailed for Europe."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"All I know about him," he said; "I have secured from the
police. He has been working with a swell crowd in France, but
they never brought any charge home to him, although it is pretty
well known he was concerned in one or two bad robberies. I have
information that he is at Monte Carlo. Unfortunately a number of
our clients are there also, including a selection of our
brightest muno profiteers."</p>

<p>"From which effort of word-making I gather you mean gentlemen
who have made profits out of munitions," suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Campbell. "Reddy doesn't work alone. There's a
whole gang. You will find them and their womenfolk there,
encrusted with precious stones and clothed in rainbow raiment.
They will be eating ice-creams with diamond spoons, and new peas
with golden knives, and you will possibly interrupt Mr. Reddy
just as he is telling the most bloated of these about a diamond
mine that he has discovered in Sicily. Reddy always carries a few
spare diamonds as a convincing proof."</p>

<p>"What help do I get from the French police?" asked Bob, and in
reply his new employer pulled open the drawer and took out a
small leather-bound book.</p>

<p>"Here is your authority, signed by the Minister of the
Interior, and countersigned by the Minister of State of Monaco.
The authorities in Monaco are more anxious to keep out the crooks
than we are to pinch them."</p>

<p>Bob took the book, examined it, and slipped it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Now off you go. You will live at the best hotels."</p>

<p>"Trust me, old man," said Bob. "Do I draw my salary in
advance, or when I can get it?"</p>

<p>"I knew your father," said Mr. Campbell eyeing him severely,
"and he was a good and thrifty Scot. I knew your mother, and she
was a Macleod and a thrifty soul. But you, Bob, you have just
developed into a spendthrift Englishman, Shall I give you a
little on account?"</p>

<p>"A lot's a little," said Bob. "I will take six months' salary,
and I will let you know what I want for expenses. I shall stay
for a few days in Paris, and Paris costs money."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell sighed and drew a cheque.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Two men sat outside the Cafe de Paris in Monte
Carlo. They were both well-dressed, both clean-shaven, and had
the appearance of citizens of the world, which meant that they
may have been of any nationality, but were probably American.</p>

<p>The elder of the two was sucking a cigar thoughtfully, and
nodding his replies to the other.</p>

<p>Presently he said:</p>

<p>"I have never met him, but I've heard a lot about him. Jimmy,
this place is not going to be healthy after Monday. I think we'll
skip by the Sunday morning train. That gives us four days to draw
dividends. What is this Brewer like?"</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged.</p>

<p>"Search me!" he said. "I know as much about him as you
do."</p>

<p>"You are sure he is coming?" asked Reddy.</p>

<p>"Sure," said the other emphatically. "I saw the telegram
engaging rooms on the clerk's counter this morning. It was sent
from Paris, and asked for the best suite overlooking the entrance
to the Casino. It said he would arrive on Monday, but if he
didn't the rooms were to be held for him until he did
arrive."</p>

<p>Reddy nodded again.</p>

<p>"That gives us four days, and I think we shall get the stuff,"
he added confidently. "Little William certainly looks like easy
money."</p>

<p>He nodded towards the hotel, on the steps of which stood a
resplendent figure in a shepherd's plaid suit and a Homburg hat
of dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p>"He almost sparkles from here," said Reddy admiringly. "Gee!
That fellow is the nearest approach to cash in hand that I have
ever struck."</p>

<p>"What is he?" asked Jimmy curiously. "I saw you talking with
him in the rooms last night."</p>

<p>"He is William Ford. His pa made enough out of fuses to settle
the British National Debt. When the war finished so did pa. He
died off and left a cartload of money to Willie, and Willie's
seeing life for the first time."</p>

<p>"What did you get him with?" asked Reddy.</p>

<p>"With my Montana silver mine," replied the other. "He just
fell for it. Come over and shake hands with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Ford stood with his hands in his pockets, a long amber
cigarette-holder between his teeth, staring about him, and
apparently oblivious to the beauties of the scene. Walking slowly
across the broad, well-swept roadway to the Municipal Gardens, he
bought a newspaper at the little kiosk, and returned to a long
garden seat facing the Casino. It was here that they accosted
him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Ford, I want you to shake hands with Mr.
Kennedy, one of our millionaire ranchers from Texas."</p>

<p>Mr. Ford blinked up at the newcomer, and offered a limp
hand.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said to Reddy, "it's beastly hot, and I
can't read this beastly French newspaper. Do you understand this
beastly language?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure, Mr. Ford," said the other, taking the newspaper
from the young man's hand. "I have seen it, and there's nothing
at all worth reading about unless you are interested in French
racing."</p>

<p>"I hate racing. I think it's beastly," said Mr. Ford,
adjusting a glass in his eye with apparent difficulty. "I am a
business man y'know, Mr. Redwood; gambling doesn't appeal to me.
I risk a few thousands at the beastly table, but it bores
me."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Mr. Redwood cordially; "that's a fool way
of spending your money."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mr. Ford modestly, "I can afford to lose. I
brought a million francs in ready money."</p>

<p>"Which I hope you keep in the hotel safe," said Reddy
warningly. "There are a great many dishonest people in Monte
Carlo."</p>

<p>"Not much," said Mr. Ford scornfully. "I always say if a man
can't look after his beastly money he doesn't deserve to have it.
No; I keep it in my room."</p>

<p>Mr. Reddy drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I haven't come to Monte Carlo to learn how to protect
myself," went on Mr. Ford. "But look here, as a business man, and
without any beastly beating about the bush, what do you want for
this fifth share in your mine?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I want to sell," Reddy said modestly.
"I have come to Monte Carlo to enjoy myself, and not to deal in
stocks and shares."</p>

<p>"You do too much of that at home, Mr. Redwood," chimed in
Jimmy, feeling it was his turn to speak. "Why, Mr. Redwood is
known from one end of Colorado to the other end of Montana as the
biggest man in the mining world. I suppose you deal in five
million shares a year, don't you, Mr. Redwood?"</p>

<p>"About that," said the modest Reddy; "probably not so many,
but somewhere about that figure."</p>

<p>The young man was staring at him with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"You can't frighten me with talk of millions," he said. "I
understand that your Montana mine is capitalised at a million
dollars; that is about £200,000."</p>

<p>Mr. Redwood nodded.</p>

<p>"You say you want £40,000; that is two hundred thousand
dollars for a fifth interest!"</p>

<p>Mr. Redwood nodded again.</p>

<p>"The shares stand at 2.50 in the open market," he said; "and a
fifth share is worth more than twice as much as I am asking for
it. I am tired of mining, tired of making profits. I am going to
get out of my holdings, Jimmy," he said, turning to the
"rancher." "This gentleman wants to buy a share of the Montana
Deep. He's a business man, and there is something about him that
I like."</p>

<p>"But surely," said the shocked "rancher," "you are not going
to sell out your holdings in the Montana Deep? Why, they are the
richest mines in the West. There would be a sensation if this
were known in Wall Street."</p>

<p>Reddy made no reply. He took from his inside pocket a thick
package, and, unrolling it, disclosed some beautifully-printed
share certificates, stamped and sealed. These he looked at
musingly, even regretfully.</p>

<p>"When I think," he said, "of the trouble I have taken to make
this mine a success, why, I hate the idea of parting with them. I
shall be giving them to you, Mr. Ford, for a mere bagatelle.
Exactly the amount you have brought to Monte Carlo in ready money
expecting to lose."</p>

<p>"Of course, I haven't made up my mind that I am going to buy
them," said the young man hastily.</p>

<p>"And I haven't made up my mind that I'm going to sell them
either," smiled the other. "Come and have a drink."</p>

<p>He was too wily a bird to press his victim, and made no
further reference to the deal for two days.</p>

<p>"The time is getting short," said Reddy on the Saturday after
lunch. "Did you hear from Paris?"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded, and produced a telegraph form.</p>

<p>"Brewer is staying at the Hotel Meurice," he said. "That was
the hotel his telegram was sent from. I wired him last night in
the name of the hotel to ask if he still wanted the rooms, and I
watched the counter all morning to see if he replied. Here's a
copy of the telegram. It came just before lunch."</p>

<p>He handed the scribbled slip of paper to the other who
read:</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I want the rooms.&mdash;Brewer."</p>

<p>"The hotel people were a bit puzzled by the wire, but that's
nothing. We shall be gone, anyway, before he arrives. Now, what
about this boob?"</p>

<p>"He has bitten, but he looks like taking a few days to land,"
said Reddy. "I had a chat with him in the rooms, exchanged
confidences with him, told him that I always kept my money under
the pillow, and went out this morning forgetting to take it with
me. He said he kept his money in the bottom drawer of his bureau
under his clothes," he chuckled. "If we don't get his stuff to-
day legitimately, Jimmy, we are going to get it to-night by
coarse, violent methods. Don't trouble to cancel the sleeper, but
we are going to get away by another route."</p>

<p>"How's that?" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I have ordered a car from Nice to meet me outside the Post
Office at two o'clock to-morrow morning. We will take the road as
far as Marseilles, slip on through Narbonne, across the frontier
into Spain, and lie low at Barcelona for a little while. I fixed
another car to meet us at Marseilles on Sunday afternoon outside
the Hotel d'Angleterre."</p>

<p>"Good," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Our room is on the same floor as his. It is easy to swing
from one balcony to another, and he sleeps with his windows open.
I will get into the room and open the door. You will come in, and
if he gives any trouble put him to sleep. We ought to make
Marseilles before midday."</p>

<p>They strolled through the big pillared hall, passed through
the doors into the sale, and spent the next half-hour wandering
from table to table in the track of their victim, who
occasionally hazarded a louis upon a number but was not
apparently engaged in any serious betting.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford at last saw the two Americans, and favoured them with
a pitying smile.</p>

<p>"Beastly nonsense, don't you think," he said. "I say, let's
get out of this place. It makes me ill to see people wasting
their money."</p>

<p>They followed him obediently and he went back to his favourite
garden seat before the Casino.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about that mining proposition, and do
you know I nearly decided to buy your shares; then it struck me
that Montana was a beastly long way off, I and I know nothing
about mining."</p>

<p>"Fortunately you don't have to know," said Reddy. "There is
just nothing for you to do but to sit tight in your beautiful
home in London and watch the dividends pile up."</p>

<p>"That's all right my friend," said the young man in a superior
tone, "but suppose they don't pile up, hey? I will tell you what
I'll do. I will write to a friend of mine, my broker, a beastly
clever fellow, who does all my work for me, and I will get him to
telegraph me. Or suppose I wired him. Telegrams are so much
quicker. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Redwood?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Redwood calmly; "and if he replies
favourably, as of course he will, you will give me a cheque."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the young man, "I will pay you cash."</p>

<p>"I thought you might have put the money into the bank," said
Mr. Redwood, greatly relieved.</p>

<p>'"Not a bit of it! Not a bit of it! I always say that if a
fellow can't look after his beastly money himself he doesn't
deserve to have it. Oh, by the way, I have had a telegram from a
fellow named"&mdash;he fumbled in his pockets&mdash;"from a
fellow named Brewer. A beastly impertinent telegram, telling me
to do nothing until I have seen him. Who the deuce is
Brewer?"</p>

<p>"Brewer," said Mr. Redwood with great earnestness, "is one of
the worst crooks on the Continent. Whatever he lays his hands on
is as good as lost."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," gasped Mr. Ford. "Well, of all the cheek!
Do you think I ought to notify the police?"</p>

<p>"It is quite unnecessary." Reddy was thoroughly enjoying the
humour of the situation.</p>

<p>Ford looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I am going up to La Turbie. I have ordered a motor-car. Would
you two gentlemen like to come up?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Reddy; "I have got a lot of work to do this
afternoon&mdash;letters to write and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The work that Reddy had to do was peculiar to his profession.
He had to study road maps and improvise time-tables. He had to
telegraph to one of the Big Four of Crime, who was in temporary
retirement at Montdidier to fix a passport which would enable him
to cross the frontier. He had to pack his scanty belongings and
make a further reconnaissance of Mr. Ford's room.</p>

<p>He had already discovered that it was impossible to get into
the room by day. By special arrangement with the hotel
proprietors a man stood on guard in the corridor all the time Mr.
Ford was out&mdash;a guard which, owing to the young man's
confidence in himself, was removed at night. Each big room had
its own oblong balcony, and between the balconies was a space of
two feet which a bold and an agile man could easily
negotiate&mdash;and Reddy and his partner were both bold and
agile. Patience was one of his virtues, and most patiently he
waited for the night to fall.</p>

<p>At midnight the rooms closed and a big crowd flocked out, the
doors of limousines banged, the engines of limousines purred;
there was a great melting away of people, and presently the space
before the Casino was clear.</p>

<p>By one o'clock most of the regular habitues of the Casino had
either gone home or had passed across to the Sporting Club, which
did not close until four in the morning, and where baccarat was
played for high stakes, and when Reddy stepped out on to the
balcony there was not a soul in sight.</p>

<p>He listened for a full minute, then swung himself over the
iron rail of the balcony, reached out for the next and in this
way traversed the three balconies which separated him from Mr.
Ford's room.</p>

<p>The windows were wide open, only the wooden jalousies being
closed, and these he opened easily and noiselessly. He slipped
into the room and closed the wooden doors behind him. To make his
way across the room and unlock the door leading to the corridor
was the work of a few seconds. He had listened intently on
entering the room, and had been rewarded by hearing the regular
breathing not to say occasional snore of his victim.</p>

<p>As he unlocked the outer door, Jimmy slipped in, closing it
noiselessly behind him, and turning the key. Reddy felt for the
bottom drawer of the bureau. He had pulled it open, and his hand
was dexterously searching amidst a mass of clothing, when the
room was suddenly flooded with light.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford was sitting up in bed balancing a wicked-looking
Browning pistol on his knees.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands, Reddy," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Reddy indignantly. "I have got into
the wrong room. I am surprised at you, Mr. Ford."</p>

<p>Mr. Ford slipped from his bed, and Reddy noticed that he was
fully dressed save for his coat.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for you, Reddy," Mr. Ford went on. "I am
taking you into custody on a charge of burglary, attempted fraud
by misrepresentation and impersonation. I am taking your pal,
too."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Reddy. "My name is Bob Brewer," said
the young man. "You may have heard of me. I am a notorious crook
who takes everything I can lay my hands on. Put out yours, I am
going to lay hands on you."</p>

25 Dec 1920</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">SCOTLAND YARD is good, but Scotland Yard is
slow. Campbell fingered his chin for three days, wrote on
fourteen cable blanks, and finally wired to "Brewerston, New
York:"</p> <br>

<p class="telegram">COME TAKE CHARGE OUR DETECTIVE DEPARTMENT.
BIG SALARY. EXPENSES REASONABLE. CAMPBELL. FEDERATED
ASSURANCES.</p>

<p><br> To all outward appearance Douglas Campbell was a dour and
possibly a short-tempered man of forty-eight, tall and broad of
shoulder. He had what women describe as a bad-tempered face,
since, through no fault of his own, his eyebrows met, and that,
as everybody knows, is an infallible indication of the choleric
temperament.</p>

<p>As president of the Scottish Federated Assurances, it was only
right and proper that he should be credited with a total absence
of any sense of humor. He was, as all who have met him will
testify, a grave and serious man, who used precise language
cautiously.</p>

<p>He sat at his table one spring morning reading his
correspondence. Presently he put the letters down and looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"I am expecting Mr. Robert Brewer in a few minutes," he said.
"Show him straight in and see that we are not interrupted."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said his secretary.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and the secretary took from the
hands of the clerk a viating card.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brewer, sir," he announced.</p>

<p>"Show him in." Campbell rose expectantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Brewer was young, perfectly and fashionably
attired, and carried in his very presence the hallmark of "good
tone." Clean shaven, big-jawed and bright-eyed, there was about
him that air of buoyant freshness which can only come from the
consciousness of youth.</p>

<p>He advanced to Campbell with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"My dear old Highlander, you're glad to see me!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," said Campbell. "Sit down. That
will do, Mr. George. You're looking very bright and beautiful
this morning."</p>

<p>"Aren't I?" rejoined Mr. Bob Brewer delightedly. "Dear old
top, I feel positively pretty. Now let us get down to the
horrible business. I gather you haven't brought me from New York
to hand me compliments."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell drew up his chair close to the table and lowered
his voice.</p>

<p>"Bob, the presidents of three of our companies have advised
our sending for you. I represent six of the biggest insurance
companies in this country, mostly burglary, accident, and that
sort of thing. You know the kind of business; you've been
connected with it yourself."</p>

<p>Bob Brewer nodded.</p>

<p>"We insure society against their follies and carelessness,"
Mr. Campbell went on, "and frankly, it hasn't paid. Bob, you've
heard about the sins of society? Well, I'll tell you what its
principal sin is&mdash;lack of gray-matter. We've got the finest
and the best clients in Britain&mdash;the cream of the whole
bunch. Everybody with money and personal adornment is insured
with us. But, Bob, their trouble is that, whilst they had enough
brains to get their money, they haven't enough to keep what they
buy with it.</p>

<p>"You know what they are," he went on; "they move like
automatons from one fashionable place to another, and they move
in a crowd like a flock of sheep. We've got to put a man on
specially to watch over these sheep and see that they are not
torn limb from limb by the wolves. We are going to offer you a
very big salary to take this job on, and give you permission to
accept any private commissions that may come your way. Is it a
bet?"</p>

<p>"It all depends upon what your idea of a handsome salary is,"
said Bob with a little grin. "In the old days it used to be
somewhere in the region of fifteen hundred or two thousand
dollars per annum."</p>

<p>"We are more broad-minded how," Campbell assured him, "and we
never talk under ten thousand."</p>

<p>Brewer nodded.</p>

<p>"Take in the board," he said, "I am engaged."</p>

<p>Campbell walked to the door and turned the key.</p>

<p>"I'll introduce you to the names of the kingbird of all the
birds of prey that rend my lambies," he said; "he's the boss man
of the Big Four of Crime&mdash;'Reddy' Smith."</p>

<p>Bob laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Reddy, eh?" he said. "Why, I need no introduction to Reddy!
You couldn't live in the seams of New York City and not know
him."</p>

<p>"Does he know you?" asked the other quickly.</p>

<p>"He does not," replied Bob. "We've never met in the way of
business, but I know him. You see in New York I was on the
commercial side of insurance&mdash;trade frauds and that sort of
thing. Reddy was a con man, an advertisement faker&mdash;he used
to sell non-existent shares to the deluded agriculturists of the
Middle West. I have seen him exercise in a prison yard, but I
doubt if he knows me. As a matter of fact, I was on his track
about a year ago before he sailed for Europe."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"All I know about him," he explained, "I have secured from the
police. He has been working with a swell crowd in France, but
they never brought any charge home to him, although it is pretty
well known he was concerned in one or two bad robberies. I had
information that he is at Monte Carlo. Unfortunately a number of
our clients are there also, including a selection of our
brightest muno-profiteers."</p>

<p>"From which effort of word-making I gather you mean gentlemen
who have made profits out of munitions," suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Campbell. "Reddy doesn't work alone. There's a
whole gang. You will find them and their women-folk there,
incrusted with precious stones and clothed in rainbow raiment.
They will be eating ice-cream with diamond spoons and new peas
with golden knives, and you will possibly interrupt Mr. Reddy
just as he is telling the most bloated of them about a diamond
mine that he has discovered in Sicily. Reddy always carries a few
spare diamonds as a convincing proof."</p>

<p>"What help do I get from the French police?" asked Bob, and in
reply his new employer pulled open the drawer and took out a
small leather-bound book.</p>

<p>"Here is your authority, signed by the Minister of the
Interior and countersigned by the Minister of State of Monaco.
The authorities in Monaco are more anxious to keep out the crooks
than we are to pinch them."</p>

<p>Bob took the book, examined it, and slipped it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Now off you go. You will live at the best hotel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me that," put in Bob briskly. "I can attend
to such little things without any assistance whatsoever."</p>

<p>Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"I will give you a list of the ladies and gentlemen who are at
present relieving the Monte Carlo ratepayers, and who are also
clients of ours. And for the Lord's sake don't forget, Bob, when
you see a diamond as big as a brazil nut sparkling and
scintillating in the overhead lights of the casino, that it is
nine thousand to one that behind that diamond is a fat policy,
and behind that policy is me, sitting with quivering knees
waiting for a claim."</p>

<p>"Trust me, old one," said Bob. "Do I draw my salary in advance
or when I can get it?"</p>

<p>"I knew your father before he committed the unpardonable sin
of naturalizing himself American," said Mr. Campbell, eying
Brewer severely, "and he was a good and thrifty Scot. I knew your
mother, and she was a Macleod, and a thrifty soul. But you, Bob,
you have just developed into a spendthrift Yankee&mdash;one of
the younger set I'm always reading about in the best American
leaders. Shall I give ye a little on account?"</p>

<p>"A lot's a little," said Bob. "I will take six months salary
and I will let you know what I want for expenses. I shall stay
for a few days in Paris, and Paris costs money."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell sighed and drew a check.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="first">TWO men sat outside the Café de Paris in Monte
Carlo. They were both well-dressed, both clean-shaven, and had
the appearance of citizens of the world, which meant that they
may have been of any nationality but were probably American. The
elder of the two was sucking a cigar thoughtfully and nodding his
replies to the other. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"I've never met him, but I've heard about him. Jimmy, this
place is not going to be healthy after Monday. I think we'll skip
by the Sunday morning train. That gives us four days to draw
dividends. What's this Brewer like?"</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged.</p>

<p>"Search me," he said. "I know as much about him as you
do."</p>

<p>"You are sure he is coming?" asked Reddy.</p>

<p>"Sure." The other nodded emphatically. "I saw the telegram
engaging rooms on the clerk's counter this morning. It was sent
from Paris, and asked for the best suite overlooking the entrance
to the Casino. He said he would arrive on Monday, but if he
didn't the rooms were to be held over for him until he did
arrive."</p>

<p>Reddy nodded again.</p>

<p>"That gives us four days, and I think we shall get the stuff,"
he added confidently.</p>

<p>"Little William certainly looks like easy money."</p>

<p>He nodded toward the hotel, on the steps of which stood a
resplendent figure in a shepherd's plaid suit and Homburg hat of
dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p>"He almost sparkles from here," said Reddy admiringly. "Gee!
That fellow is the nearest approach to cash in hand that I've
ever struck."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Jimmy curiously. "I saw you talking with
him in the rooms last night."</p>

<p>"He's William Ford. His pa made enough to settle the British
national debt out of fuses. When the war finished so did pa. He
died off and left a car-load of money to Willie, and Willie's
seeing life for the first time."</p>

<p>"What did you get him with?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"With my Montana silver mine," replied the other. "He just
fell for it. Come over and meet him."</p>

<p>The easy mark aforesaid was affixed to a long garden seat
facing the Casino when they accosted him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Ford, I want you to shake hands with Mr.
James Kennedy, one of our millionaire ranchers from Texas."</p>

<p>William Ford blinked up at the newcomer and offered a limp
hand.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Redwood," he said. "It's beastly hot, and I
can't read this beastly French newspaper. Do you understand the
beastly language?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure, Mr. Ford," and the other took the paper from the
young man's hand.</p>

<p>"I've seen it, and there's nothing at all worth reading about
unless you are interested in French racing."</p>

<p>"I hate racing, I think it's beastly."</p>

<p>Mr. Ford adjusted an eye-glass with apparent difficulty. "I am
a business man, y'know, Mr. Redwood; gambling doesn't appeal to
me. My dear old governor was a business man, too, and I am what
you might call a chip of the old block. Haw! Haw!"</p>

<p>They joined in his laughter politely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm a business man," Mr. Ford went on in a tone which
suggested that the last word had been said on the subject. "I
risk a few thousands at the beastly table, but it bores me."</p>

<p>"Quite right, too," agreed Mr. Reddy heartily; "that's a
fool's way of spending your money."</p>

<p>"Of course," admitted Mr. Ford modestly, "I can afford to
lose. I brought a million francs in ready money."</p>

<p>"Which I hope you keep in the hotel safe," said Reddy
warningly. "There are a great many dishonest people about in
Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>"Not much," retorted Mr. Ford scornfully. "I always say if a
man can't look after his beastly money he doesn't deserve to have
it No, I keep it my room." Mr. Reddy drew a long breath. "I
haven't come to Monte Carlo to learn how to protect myself."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Reddy heartily, "and I hope you are not
going to lose it at the tables."</p>

<p>"I'll watch it!" replied Mr. William Ford. "No, sir. Gambling
isn't any attraction to me."</p>

<p>He changed his tone suddenly.</p>

<p>"As a business man," he went on, "and without any beastly
beating about the bush, what do you want for this fifth share in
your mine?"</p>

<p>Reddy removed his cigar and looked at it.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I want to sell," he answered
modestly. "I have come to Monte Carlo to enjoy myself and not to
deal in stocks and shares."</p>

<p>"You do too much of that at home, Mr. Redwood," chimed in
Jimmy, feeling it was his turn to speak. "Why, Mr. Redwood is
known from one end of Colorado to the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Montana," whispered Mr. Redwood.</p>

<p>"From one end of Colorado to the other end of Montana,"
amended Jimmy obligingly, "as the biggest man in the mining
world. I suppose you deal in five million shares a year, don't
you, Mr. Redwood?"</p>

<p>"About that," confessed the modest Reddy. "Probably not so
many, but somewhere about that figure."</p>

<p>Young Mr. Ford was staring at him with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"You can't frighten me with talk of millions," he said. "I
understand that your Montana mine is capitalized at a million
dollars."</p>

<p>Mr. Redwood nodded.</p>

<p>"You say you want two hundred thousand dollars for a fifth
interest?"</p>

<p>Mr. Redwood nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The shares stand at two dollars and fifty cents in the open
market," he said, "and a fifth share is worth more than twice as
much as I am asking for it. I'm tired of mining; tired of making
profits. I am going to get out of my holdings, Jimmy," he added,
turning to the "rancher." "This gentleman wants to buy a share of
the Montana Deep. He's a business man, and there's something
about him that I like."</p>

<p>"But surely," said the shocked rancher, "you are not going to
sell out your holdings in the Mohtana Deeps. Why, they are the
richest mines in the West. There would be a sensation if this was
known in Wall Street."</p>

<p>Reddy made no reply. He took from his inside pocket a thick
package, and unrolling it, disclosed some beautifully printed
share certificates stamped and sealed. These he looked at
musingly, even regretfully.</p>

<p>"When I think," he said, "of the trouble I have taken to make
this mine a success, why, I hate the idea of parting with them. I
shall be giving them to you, Mr. Ford, for a mere bagatelle.
Exactly the amount you have brought to Monte Carlo in ready money
expecting to lose!"</p>

<p>"Of course I haven't made up my mind that I am going to buy
them," rejoined the young man hastily.</p>

<p>"And I haven't made up my mind that I'm going to sell them,
either," smiled the other. "Come and have a drink."</p>

<p>He was too wily a bird to press his victim, and made no
further reference to the deal for two days.</p>

<p>"The time is getting short," quoth Reddy on the Saturday after
lunch. "Did you hear from Paris?"</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded and produced a telegraph form.</p>

<p>"Brewer is staying at the Hotel Maurice," he said. "At least
that was where his telegram was sent from. I wired him last night
in the name of the hotel to ask if he stull wanted the rooms, and
I watched the counter all the morning to see if he replied. Here
is a copy of the telegram. It came just before lunch."</p>

<p>He handed the scribbled slip of paper to the other, who
read:</p> <br>

<p class="cp"><i>Yes, of course, I want the rooms.
Brewer.</i></p> <br>

<p>"The hotel people were a bit puzzled by the wire, but that's
nothing. We shall be gone anyway before he arrives. Now what
about this boob?"</p>

<p>"He's bitten but he looks like taking a few days to land,"
said Reddy. "I had a chat with him, and exchanged confidences,
told him that I always kept my money under my pillow, and went
out this morning forgetting to take it with me. He said he kept
his money in the bottom drawer of his bureau under his clothes.
If we don't get his stuff to-day legitimately, Jimmy, we are
going to get it to-night by coarse and violent methods. Don't
trouble to cancel the sleeper, but we are going to get away by
another route."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I have ordered a car from Nice to meet me outside the post-
office at two o'clock to-morrow morning. We will take the road as
far as Marseilles, slip on through Narbonne across the frontier
into Spain, and lie low at Barcelona for a little while. I fixed
another car to meet us at Marseilles on Sunday afternoon outside
the Hotel d'Angleterre."</p>

<p>"Good," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Our room is on the same floor as his. It is easy to swing
from one balcony to another, and he sleeps with his windows open.
I will get into the room and open the door. You will come in, and
if he gives any trouble, put him to sleep. We ought to make
Marseilles before midday."</p>

<p>"Perhaps hell buy the goods," suggested Jimmy hopefully.</p>

<p>"He'd better," retorted the older man with a grim smile.
"Look, there he goes, over to the rooms! Let's see what he is
doing."</p>

<p>They went through the big pillared hall. passed through the
doors into the <i>salle</i>, and spent the next half-hour
wandering from table to table in the track of their victim, who
occasionally hazarded a louis upon a number, but was not
apparently engaged in any serious betting.</p>

<p>The rooms are open from ten in the morning till eleven, but
most of the best class gamblers patronize the <i>cercle
privée</i>, a handsome saloon leading from the main hall,
admission to which can only be secured by subscription. Into this
room they followed Ford, and found him standing at the <i>trente
et quarante</i> table watching some exceptionally high play.
<i>Trente et quarante</i> is a game played with six packs of
cards. The dealer lays out in one line as many cards as will make
something over thirty and under forty. The first line of cards
stands for black, the second line he deals stands for red. If the
top line counts thirty-one and the bottom line thirty-two, black
wins, and those who have laid their money upon the space on the
table have their stakes doubled.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford turned, saw the two Americans, and favored them with
a pitying smile.</p>

<p>"Beastly nonsense, don't you think?" he said. "I say, let's
get out of this place. It makes me ill to see people wasting
their money."</p>

<p>They followed him obediently and he went back to his favorite
garden-seat before the Casino.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that mining proposition, and do you
know I nearly decided to buy your shares, then it struck me that
Montana was a beastly long way off, and I know nothing about
mining."</p>

<p>"Fortunately you don't have to know," replied Reddy. "There's
just nothing for you to do but to sit tight in your beautiful
home in London and watch the dividends pile up."</p>

<p>"That's all right, my friend," said the young man in a
superior tone, "but suppose they don't pile up, hey? I'll tell
you what I'll do. I'll write to a friend of mine, my broker, a
beastly clever chap, and get him to telegraph me. Or suppose I
wired him&mdash;yes, that's a wonderful idea. Telegrams are so
much quicker. I'll telegraph to him. You don't mind, do you, Mr.
Redwood? We business people have to be very cautious."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Redwood calmly, "and if he replies
favorably, as of course he will, you will give us a check?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the young man, "I will pay you cash."</p>

<p>"I thought you, might have put the money into the bank." Mr.
Redwood was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, I always say that if a fellow can't look
after his beastly money himself he doesn't deserve to have
it."</p>

<p>"Those are my sentiments, too," said Mr. Redwood with genuine
heartiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, I have had a telegram from a fellow
named"&mdash;Ford fumbled in his pockets&mdash;"from a fellow
named Brewer. A beastly impertinent telegram, telling me to do
nothing until I have seen him. Who the deuce is Brewer?"</p>

<p>"Brewer," said Mr. Redwood with great earnestness, "is one of
the worst crooks on the Continent. Whatever he lays his hands on
is as good as lost."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" gasped Mr. Ford. "Well, of all the cheek!
Do you think I ought to notify the police?"</p>

<p>"It is quite unnecessary." Reddy was thoroughly enjoying the
humor of the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I'm going up to La Turbie. I have ordered a motor-car. Would
you two gentlemen like to join me?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," answered Reddy, "I have a lot of work to do this
afternoon&mdash;letters to write and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The work that Reddy had to do was peculiar to his profession.
He had to study road maps and improvise time-tables. He had to
telegraph to one of the Big Four of Crime who was in temporary
retirement at Montdidier to fix a passport which would enable him
to cross the frontier. He had to pack his scanty belongings and
make a further reconnaissance of Mr. Ford's room. He had already
discovered that it was impossible to get into it by day. By
special arrangement with the hotel proprietors a man stood on
guard in the corridor all the time Mr. Ford was out&mdash;a guard
who, owing to the young man's confidence in himself, was removed
at night.</p>

<p>At midnight the rooms closed and a big crowd flocked out, the
doors of limousines banged, there was a great melting away of
people, and presently the space before the Casino was clear. Mr.
Ford was one of the last to leave the rooms.</p>

<p>Observing him from an upper window in the hotel, Reddy nudged
his companion.</p>

<p>"There he is," he said. "He will have his glass of lemonade in
the lounge and then he'll come up. He was boasting to me that it
took him less than ten minutes to get to sleep. We will give him
an hour. That will allow for the hotel quieting down. By the way,
I have re-arranged the timetable, and the motor-car will be on
the corner at one."</p>

<p>By one o'clock most of the regular <i>habitués</i> of the
Casino had either gone home or had passed across to the Sporting
Club, which did not close till four in the morning, and where
baccarat was played for high stakes, and when Reddy stepped out
onto the balcony there was not a soul in sight. He waited until
he saw a big limousine come slowly into the square and take up
its position at a corner of the hotel block.</p>

<p>"I think we can afford to leave our trunks," he said, with a
touch of humor. "I guess if we attempted to hustle 'em through
the lounge to-night there would be some commotion. Did you tell
that guy on the door that we were going over to the Sporting
Club?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the other.</p>

<p>Reddy made another reconnaissance.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said. "Stroll into the corridor in three
minutes' time. I'll have the door open ready for you."</p>

<p>He waited till Jimmy disappeared, then swung himself over the
iron rail of the balcony, reached out for the next, and in this
way traversed the three balconies which separated him from Mr.
Ford's room. The windows were wide open, only the wooden
jalousies being closed, and these he opened noiselessly. He
slipped into the room and closed the wooden doors behind him. To
make his way across the floor and unlock the door leading to the
corridor was the work of a few seconds. He had listened intently
on entering the place, and had been rewarded by hearing the
regular breathing, not to say occasional snore, of his
victim.</p>

<p>As Reddy unlocked the outer door, Jimmy slipped in, closing it
noiselessly behind him and turning the key. Reddy felt for the
bottom drawer of the bureau, and he had pulled it open and his
hand was dexterously searching amidst a mass of clothing when the
room was suddenly flooded with light.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford was sitting up in bed, balancing a wicked-looking
Browning pistol on his knees.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands, Reddy," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Reddy waxed indignant. "I've got into the
wrong room. I'm surprised at you, Mr. Ford."</p>

<p>Mr. Ford slipped from his bed, and Reddy noticed he was fully
dressed, for his coat.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you, Reddy," Mr. Ford went on. "I am
taking you into custody on a charge of burglary, attempted fraud
by misrepresentation, and upon impersonation. I'm taking your
pal, too."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Reddy.</p>

<p>"My name is Bob Brewer," replied the young man, "you may have
heard of me. I am a notorious crook who takes everything I can
lay my hands on. Put up yours. I'm going to lay hands on
you."</p>

<h2><a id="story2">II. &mdash; THE BURGLARY AT GOODWOOD</a></h2>

<p class="first">BOB BREWER, Temporary Chief of the Federated
Assurance Corporations' Detective Department&mdash;he loved to
roll forth this string of adjectives, and for the mystification
of his friends had added to his visiting card the cryptic
initials, T.C.F.A.C.D.D.&mdash;paused on the second marble step
which led to the imposing entrance of Federated Building, and
fixed his interested gaze upon a young man, the sole occupant of
a beautiful limousine which was passing at that moment.</p>

<p>The young man wore a grey Derby hat and a long cigar, and he
lolled back in the padded interior of the machine with an air of
unspeakable boredom.</p>

<p>"Neatly and nicely posed," said Bob, took a note of the number
displayed on the back of the car, and passed into the interior of
the building.</p>

<p>A clerk recognized him with a nod, and showed him straight
into the general manager's room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Campbell is expecting you, sir," he said. "You got our
wire?"</p>

<p>"I always get wires," smiled Bob. "What's the hurry?"</p>

<p>The clerk hesitated.</p>

<p>"I think you had better see Mr. Campbell," he said.</p>

<p>Douglas Campbell, after the manner of very busy men, seemed to
be doing nothing when Bob came into his office.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he growled. "Shut the door. What&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I got your wire. I had a good crossing. The weather in France
was perfect. I posted my expense account, and I have no money,"
said Bob rapidly; "and after these preliminary pleasantries, I
repeat, what's the hurry?"</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Campbell. "Society, Bob," he began, preparing
to emphasize his points with a paper-knife, "is chiefly
remarkable by its adherence to convention."</p>

<p>"Listen," interrupted Bob; "do I get this lecture on the simps
of society every time I come to see you?"</p>

<p>"Nearly every time you will get it," said Campbell, "because I
want to impress upon you this one fact, that robbing the truly
rich is a simpler matter than taking toffee out of a baby's
mouth. It is because it is so simple that our work's so hard. By
the way," he said suddenly, "I hear that your friend Reddy
escaped from the French police."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"He got away into Spain through no fault of mine," he said.
"He is in Spain still. You are not suggesting that he is laying
for me in London, E.C.?"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I didn't ask you to come here to warn you. I
think we can cut Reddy out for a month or two."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Bob. "Reddy's more concerned about Reddy
than he is about me, and, anyway, he is not so dangerous a man
as, say, Soapy Wilkins."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell sat bolt upright in surprise.</p>

<p>"Soapy Wilkins?" he repeated. "Who the devil has been talking
to you? It was Soapy I wanted to see you about."</p>

<p>Bob Brewer, sitting on the end of the desk swinging his legs,
laughed.</p>

<p>"There is no mystery about Soapy," he said, "and less about my
reference to him. I saw him exactly two minutes ago, riding, so
to speak, in the lap of luxury and a hired motor-car and a grand
outfit which was probably his own."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell looked troubled.</p>

<p>"That's a curious coincidence," he said; "Soapy's staying at
the Hotel Magnificent, and, Bob, Soapy is a standing menace to
capital&mdash;mostly our capital."</p>

<p>"Why don't you get the real police to pull him in?" asked Bob.
"He's a well-known crook. Everybody knows Soapy in America, and I
suppose the police know him here. He is one of the cleverest
crooks in the world, and one of the most dangerous, because, like
lightning, he never strikes twice in the same place. Most
criminals are specialists, and stick to one type of crime. Soapy
is so infernally clever that he can pass from commonplace
burglary to the artistic forgery of bonds without turning a hair,
and get away with both jobs. I admire Soapy&mdash;so named, I
believe, because of his exceptionally pleasant conversational
powers. He is a genius. That fellow has ideas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't send for you to listen to an eulogy of Mr. Soapy
Wilkins," snarled Campbell, "and I deplore your taste that you
can admire any man who at any moment may reduce the dividends of
the Federated Assurances. As to pulling him in, that is
impossible. We are not working in the dear old war days, when you
could deport without trouble any undesirable person who was not
of British nationality. The police have nothing against him, and
cannot move. They are watching him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha ha!" laughed Bob sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I say they are watching him, and your peals of ironic
laughter exactly express my feelings in the matter."</p>

<p>He took a paper out of a basket and laid it on the desk before
him.</p>

<p>"Now, I will tell you why I am worried about Soapy, although
my anxiety may be groundless. Do you know Windhever Castle?"</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the Sussex residence of the Duchess of Manton," he said
promptly, "a great dame, entirely surrounded by money and social
influence."</p>

<p>Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"Windhever Castle is exactly five miles from Goodwood," he
said. "Next week we have Goodwood races, at which all the
fashionable people in Britain will be present. Society goes to
Goodwood because it lies on the weary road which society tramps
from Christmas Day to Christmas Eve. Society goes there because
it is the thing to do."</p>

<p>"Cut out all that society stuff," said Bob, "and come to the
dramatic climax of your interesting story."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell gulped something down.</p>

<p>"I will put it within your comprehension," he said. "Next week
Windhever Castle will be filled with exclusive ladies and
gentlemen who will bring for their adornment bright and beautiful
jewels, all of which are insured by us. Now, what is worrying me
is this. A month ago there was a burglary at Windhever
Castle."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"Did they get anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Mr. Campbell. "As a matter of fact, there
were no guests there, the Duchess being at Ascot with the flock.
There were only a few servants in the house and practically no
portable property. Nevertheless an entrance was effected in the
night, the Duke's safe was opened, three or four locks leading
from the garden to the study were picked, and, in fact, it was a
clean job, and the burglars got away."</p>

<p>"That's strange," said Bob thoughtfully. "Give me some details
of the work which these enterprising fellows performed."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell sketched the work of destruction briefly.</p>

<p>"It took them three hours, eh?" said the thoughtful Bob. "Of
course, it was easy; because, as you said, there were only three
servants in the house, and they had all the time. The burglary
was evidently the work of real fellows&mdash;men who knew their
game, and must have known there was no money in the house. Now,
what the dickens did they expect to find? The job must have cost
them two or three hundred pounds, and professional burglars are
thrifty souls who do not waste money."</p>

<p>"That is what is puzzling me," said Campbell; "as a matter of
fact, the burglary was not reported to us, because the Duke
himself does not insure with our companies, and I only found it
out in a roundabout way. However, forewarned is forearmed. The
Duke has had new patent locks fixed to all the doors, a new
burglar-proof safe of one of the best makes installed, and I
understand that the library, where the safe is situated, is to be
guarded by patrols whilst the house party is in residence."</p>

<p>"Do you connect Soapy with this business?"</p>

<p>"I am bound to," said Campbell. "He is the only big man in
London at the present moment. I want you to go down and see the
Duke&mdash;I have a letter of introduction to him from one of our
clients&mdash;and offer him any assistance which you can. Look
over the servants and see if you can recognize any, and be on
hand on the night of the Goodwood Cup, when the Duchess gives a
big dance, and that safe will contain the Penson emeralds. Lady
Penson is one of the guests, and I have reason to know that her
jewels will be sent down for the occasion. Above all, don't
forget that society&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's nothing you have ever said about society that I am
likely to forget," said Bob, and made his escape.</p>

<p>Windhever Castle is a building in the Georgian style, standing
in beautiful grounds on the Chichester road. The Duke was a
gentleman whose portrait was familiar to every newspaper reader.
He was a small, thin man, with a small, thin face. His expression
was somewhat vacant, and he had probably gained his reputation
for profound thinking by the extent and rarity of his library,
and his habit of never speaking save to disagree with every view
which was expressed to him.</p>

<p>He received Bob in that same library, and offered a limp
hand.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is necessary that you should interest
yourself in the safety of my guests' jewellery," he said; "but as
Lord What's-his-name"&mdash;he looked at the letter of
introduction (he made a point of never remembering names, or, if
he did remember, never committing himself to their
pronunciation)&mdash;"as Lord What's-his-name wishes you to look
after his missus's property, of course you can go anywhere you
like, except into her Grace's boudoir."</p>

<p>"I quite understand. Your Grace has taken every
precaution?"</p>

<p>"Of course you do," said the Duke. "I have told you so,
haven't I? I have a new safe here"&mdash;he pointed to a great
steel cupboard bearing the little name-plate of the best maker.
"I am having a patrol outside the window, changed every hour, and
I think you will agree it will take more than an hour to open
that safe."</p>

<p>Bob did agree. He knew the make; and in the most favourable
circumstances it could not be opened in one hour or in six.</p>

<p>"If Lord What's-his-name doesn't think his missus's jewels are
safe, there's no need for him to come," his Grace went on. "What
the deuce have I spent £200 in getting the house fitted with
burglar alarms, buying a new safe, fixing new locks for,
hey?"</p>

<p>He again held out his limp hand.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. What's-ye-may-call-it, don't make yourself an
infernal nuisance. Go and see my house-steward, and he will do
anything he can for you."</p>

<p>Bob found the house-steward, and interviewed him, though the
interview did not take the form which the Duke might have
expected. He also had an opportunity of seeing, one by one, the
various male servants who were to be on guard outside the library
on the night of the ball.</p>

<p>"There's only one way into the library from the ground," said
the house-steward: "that is through the little door which his
Grace uses, and through two other doors, all of which are fitted
with new locks, and one of the doors is sheeted with steel."</p>

<p>"Could a burglar get in from the house?"</p>

<p>"That is more difficult still," said the house-steward. "He
would have to go through the main corridor, where I shall be on
duty throughout the night."</p>

<p>Bob scratched his chin.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have known all the footmen for years?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Every one of them," said the house-steward promptly. "They
have all lived in this neighbourhood since they were children
and, with one or two exceptions, they-have been here all the
time."</p>

<p>That the appearance of a stranger in a little country village
should fail to excite interest and attention was not to be
expected, Bob knew. In a few hours his business was known, as he
expected it would be known, and the landlord of the little inn at
which he lodged had even tried to get his views on the recent
burglary, which was still the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>"There will be a lot of ladies and gentlemen down here for the
races next week, sir." he said. (He was attending personally upon
Bob at his solitary dinner.) "And I suppose you are down here to
see that there are no more burglaries?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," said Bob.</p>

<p>"By all accounts," said the garrulous landlord, "there won't
be much chance for them this time. The young gentleman who came
down from the safe company said that he defied any burglar to
open their safe."</p>

<p>"I think it will be difficult," agreed Bob good-
humouredly.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery to me," the landlord went on, "why they
burgled the castle. Why, everybody in the village knew that his
Grace was away&mdash;even the silver was at the bank, by all
accounts. I was talking to Mr. Cole, the Duke's valet, about it,
and he said they must have been mad. That's him, sir," he said,
nodding to the window.</p>

<p>Bob looked, and saw one of the manservants he had observed
that morning. He was a man of thirty, soberly dressed and
expressionless of face, as befitted a gentleman's gentleman.</p>

<p>"He often comes in here for a glass of sherry wine," explained
the landlord. "Of course, he is, practically speaking, his
Grace's right-hand man. He was born here, and used to be one of
his Grace's footmen. Then he went to Australia for six years. His
brother died suddenly and he had to go out and look after his
property. It wasn't much, by all accounts," continued the
landlord, "and when he came back to Windhever he had no money,
and it was a bit of luck that his Grace wanted a valet."</p>

<p>Bob rose, strolled through the stone-flagged entrance-hall
into the yard outside. The valet recognized him, and touched his
hat, and Bob got into conversation with him. It was a curious
conversation, for it was all about English hills and their
heights, and the conversation flagged until Bob brought up the
question of the great Tors of Devonshire.</p>

<p>"No, sir; you're wrong," said the valet in answer to one
statement Bob had made; "Hay Tor is the highest. Why, you can see
it for miles!"</p>

<p>"There's a wonderful view from the top," agreed Bob.</p>

<p>"I've never been on top," he said, "but I should say you are
right, sir."</p>

<p>He seemed willing to continue the conversation which, again at
Bob's instigation, took a curious turn, being mainly about
horses, and particularly ponies, and wild ponies at that. Here
again the man's knowledge was extensive. It was a random shot of
Bob's, but he had struck his target.</p>

<p>"You must have a glass of wine with me, Mr. Cole," he said,
and led the way to the private sitting-room he had engaged. It
was Bob who, with his own hands, and despite the protests of the
landlord, bore the glasses and the bottle. He paused outside the
door of the sitting-room to give one of the glasses an extra
polish with his silk handkerchief, for he wanted it very
clean.</p>

<p>'"Here's very good health, sir," said Mr. Cole, and drank his
wine at a gulp.</p>

<p>Bob took the glass from him, placed it carefully on the table,
and led the way into the open again. Then, when he had said good-
night to the valet, he sat down and wrote the following letter to
Douglas Campbell:</p>

<p>'"I think I have smelt out the plot, and can explain the
abortive burglary almost as easily as I shall be able to describe
the burglary which will be committed on the night of the Goodwood
Cup. I hope to send you to-morrow a finger-print which I have
taken off a glass, and which I believe will reveal the identity
of an old lag. The man's name is Cole. He had a mysterious
absence from the village for six years, which immediately
followed the arrest of the Perrers gang. Apparently Cole's
identity is not known to the Duke, and his crime is unknown to
the villagers. At any rate, from his knowledge of the hills of
Dartmoor, and his acquaintance with Dartmoor ponies, I should say
that he had seen the interior of the Princeton prison. The rest,
as they say in books, looks like being easy."</p>

<p>Bob Brewer went to the Goodwood Races for his own pleasure and
profit. Though there might be minor rogues about, he could afford
to concentrate upon the bigger gang, and the bigger gang would
not begin operations before the night. On his return from the
races on the day of the Goodwood Cup he found a telegram awaiting
him. It ran:</p>

<p>"Have made important discovery. Your theories are wrong. Am
going Portsmouth by 7.53 to-night. Motor over and meet me Grand
Hotel 10.15."</p>

<p>Bob folded up the telegram and sent for the landlord.</p>

<p>"I want you to get through to Chichester to any garage you
know and hire me a car," he said. "I have to go to
Portsmouth."</p>

<p>There was some little difficulty about hiring a car in
Goodwood week, but the hour favoured him.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock a noisy but serviceable machine was at the
door. He left instructions that any message which came through to
him by telephone, or any telegram which might arrive should be
repeated to him at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you are going, sir," said the landlord. "I thought
you would be here until after the ball."</p>

<p>"I don't think my presence is necessary," laughed Bob. "In
fact, I don't mind telling you, Mr. Landlord, a confession which
few detectives make: I have been working on the wrong track."</p>

<p>He had to wait a little while because he had put through a
call to London to the residence of Douglas Campbell. It came a
few minutes before he left, and it was Mrs. Campbell who answered
him.</p>

<p>"I have had a telegram from your husband telling me to meet
him at Portsmouth. I suppose that is all right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is going to Portsmouth by the 7.53," replied Mrs.
Campbell's voice.</p>

<p>Bob hung up the receiver. A few minutes later his car was
disappearing in a cloud of dust along the white road to
Chichester.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was the Duke of Manton's boast that he went
to bed early, and, fortunately for him, he had as his guest a
royalty who shared the same views; so that before midnight the
big Georgian house was in darkness, and there was no sound but
the occasional cough of one of the servants told off to guard the
entrance to the library. At a quarter past twelve the coughing
sentry was relieved. Scarcely had his footsteps died away on the
gravel walk when a man came noiselessly from the shrubbery,
crossed the gravel path with scarcely a sound, and approached the
sentry.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Cole?" he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "You had better get a move on. They are
relieving me in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Gee!" said the man, "being a Duke's valet gives you a
pull."</p>

<p>He moved past the sentry on the way to the door, but not very
far past. An arm was flung round his neck, a deft hand slipped
the loaded revolver from his hip pocket, and a voice in his ear
said:</p>

<p>"Are you going rough or going quiet, Soapy?"</p>

<p>"Quiet," said Soapy philosophically, and put up his right hand
mechanically for the handcuff. "So you are not Cole; you're
Brewer, aren't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's so," said Bob. "I will relieve you of all those keys
you have in your pocket, the key of the safe, and the key of the
doors."</p>

<p>"I thought you were in Portsmouth," said Soapy.</p>

<p>"Aw! Come off it!" scoffed Bob. "You didn't think a fake like
that would go, did you?"</p>

<p>"But you got Mrs. Campbell on the 'phone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I happened to know he was going to Portsmouth
anyway, and I suppose you found it out, too. Come on, Soapy, it's
the long, long trail for you."</p>

<p>"It was one of the easiest tricks, and it had been worked
before," explained Bob to the gratified Campbell. "The first
burglary was a fake, and was intended to advertise the insecurity
of the locks and the poor quality of the safe. On top of this,
down comes Soapy as an agent for a safe company, and talks old
man Duke into putting in a new outfit.</p>

<p>"The Duke is as mean as the devil. When Soapy offered to
install safe and locks and burglar alarms for £200&mdash;it was
the fact that the Duke casually mentioned he had paid £200 for a
£400 outfit which put me on to it&mdash;the old man fell for the
bargain. Soapy had an old friend in the house, and all he had to
do was to walk in, unlock the door, unlock the safe, of which he
very naturally had keys&mdash;since he had supplied it&mdash;walk
off with the swag, and nobody would know when or how the burglary
was committed. Of course, it was only accident that Cole had got
a job as valet. He would have been just as useful if he had been
a plain under-footman."</p>

<p>"What did the Duke say?" asked Campbell.</p>

<p>Bob laughed.</p>

<p>"He cursed me. He said he had lost the best valet he had ever
had."</p>

<p>"That's what I say about society," said Mr. Campbell; "they
are thickheaded and heavy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you say about my expenses?" said Bob. "They are a bit
thick and heavy, too!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="story3a">IIIa. &mdash; BACCARAT AT COWES</a></h2>

<h3>Book Version</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN Henry B. Vandersluis determined to break
into English society he went about his work in the same thorough
businesslike manner which had enabled him to create in the
Vandersluis Furniture Corporation the largest wonder of the
furnishing world. Nobody knows accurately how many acres of
ground are covered by the Vandersluis Works at Grand Rapids,
Michigan, and now that Mr. Vandersluis is a British citizen,
having forsworn his allegiance to the United States Government,
it is inexpedient to ask him, since he would probably fix his
uncomfortable monocle and ask:</p>

<p>"Is there such a place as Grand Rapids?"</p>

<p>He brought to Europe in the late 'nineties twenty million
dollars and a passionate admiration for the British aristocracy,
into the ranks of which he set himself to climb.</p>

<p>And Henry B. was some climber. His feet were so impervious to
the icy blasts of  British indifference, and to the rugged
character of the stony steps he was mounting, that they grew
neither cold nor sore.</p>

<p>He bought a wonderful estate in Somersetshire, a town house in
Grosvenor Square, which has more Dukes to the inch than any other
square. He bought a racing stable, and equipped it with
thoroughbred racehorses which pranced down to the starting-gate
very proudly, and came back to the winning-post at their leisure,
and he purchased with real money that curiosity which is so often
described in the public Press, but which is so very seldom seen,
"a floating palace."</p>

<p>The only people who can float palaces are company promoters,
and they only float picture palaces anyway, but the steam yacht
<i>Oisa</i>, or, as it was commonly designated in Southampton,
the <i>Oh I Say</i>, was palatial in its fittings, furnishings,
and feedings. It was beautiful as to line, most powerfully
engined, skilfully captained, officered, and manned, and lacked
only one thing to complete its palatial character. To cut a long
description short, the <i>Oisa</i> was a palace with a king but
without courtiers.</p>

<p>There were wonderful suites, which were suitable for the
habitation of princes. They were mostly occupied by Mr.
Vandersluis's portly city friends, who had no titles and few
"h's" to their names. There was a wonderful reception saloon, in
which Mr. Vandersluis was wont to receive letters from the
aristocracy saying that they deeply regretted that, owing to a
previous engagement, they were unable to avail themselves of his
kind invitation to be present at the gala performance he had
arranged, and begged to remain his very sincerely, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Cowes week was beginning. The roadstead was gay with dainty
white craft. The lawn of the Yacht Squadron was packed with hot
but exclusive humanity. On every yacht, however small, was a gay
little party except on the <i>Oisa</i>, where the party was Henry
B., who was neither gay nor little, for he weighed 260 pounds in
his stockinged feet.</p>

<p>He stood on the high poop of the <i>Oisa</i> surrounded by
comfortable but empty deck chairs, and his secretary, a sallow
young man who chewed gum all day long and far into the night,
gazed through his pince-nez over the sun-kissed waves and
wondered how long the old man would give him ashore.</p>

<p>Henry B. turned from a contemplation of the well-filled yachts
to his own tenant-less poop.</p>

<p>"Fine, isn't it?" he said bitterly. "I have a good mind to
hire a band, open champagne for the deck hands, and cruise
around."</p>

<p>"It will be all right to-morrow," said the secretary, "but I
told you it would be lonely. Why didn't you get Smithers and
Jackson down?"</p>

<p>"Smithers and Jackson are out," snarled Mr. Vandersluis. "Say,
they're no good, those city people. They do nothing except talk
about where they can get the best dinner in London, and how they
put one over on the Bank of England, and all that sort of stuff.
But I think I'll set 'em alight to-morrow," he said with a grim
smile. "All those girls are coming down. You are running a
special train for them?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said his secretary; "there's Gaby de Vere and Gertie
Summers and Teddy Bristowe&mdash;a whole bunch of 'em."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Mr. Vandersluis; "get the women and you
will get the men. I'll bet when they know all that crowd is on
board we will have to put down extra ladders over the side to get
'em up."</p>

<p>He spoke with conviction, but nevertheless he was not
convinced, and after striding up and down the deck for a little
while, he came back to his secretary.</p>

<p>"I thought the other idea would have brought 'em in, George,"
he said pathetically; "I got the best roulette table that you can
find on any of these yachts. D'ye think they know they can have a
game here?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the secretary, "I have put it about very
thoroughly. I have seen a lot of fellows from the other yachts. I
have talked with the servants, and passed the quiet tip that if
anybody likes to come aboard they will be welcome."</p>

<p>"Did you put in the paragraph I told you?"</p>

<p>George nodded, slipped his fingers into his waistcoat pocket,
and pulled out a folded newspaper cutting.</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis adjusted his glasses and read:</p> <br>

<p class="headline">A FLOATING BANK<br> American Millionaire
Carries Half a Million Pounds on His Yacht</p>

<p class="quote">"Mr. Henry B. Vandersluis, a well-known figure
in London society"&mdash;(Mr. Vandersluis groaned)&mdash;"does
not bother about banks when he is on a yachting cruise, and is
ready to move off to any part of the world, and with this
possibility in view he carries aboard with him an enormous sum of
money, reputed to be half a million. There is method in this
apparent eccentricity, because Mr. Vandersluis is a great art
collector, and the necessity for cash transactions in this
business is obvious."</p>

<p>"You would have thought that would attract them," said Mr.
Vandersluis. "I have never known money that didn't, and I don't
suppose my money's different to anybody else's. But somehow we
only attract the fellows we don't want. Who is this?"</p>

<p>He pointed over to the side, where a boat was rowing direct
for the yacht's gangway.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a real fellow," said Mr. Vandersluis
hopefully.</p>

<p>"He looks like a clerk to me," said the unimaginative George.
"Lords don't wear white flannels and black boots&mdash;not the
lords I've met."</p>

<p>The boatman brought his little craft alongside, and the
passenger stepped up the ladder. He lifted his straw hat to Mr.
Vandersluis, and produced carefully from his inside pocket a
letter.</p>

<p>Henry B. was used to receiving letters. He turned it over and
read on the flap, "The Federated Assurances."</p>

<p>"Business, eh?" he said, and ripped it open.</p>

<p>It read:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">Dear Sir,&mdash;I have read with some
uneasiness in the morning Press an account of the large sums of
money which you are carrying on the "Oisa," and I am sending you
this letter by special passenger and, as you may be sure, in no
interfering, but in a helpful spirit, to ask you, in view of all
the circumstances, and particularly bearing in mind the fact that
you are heavily insured against burglary at this office, whether
you would agree to receive as your guest our best detective, Mr.
Robert Brewer, of whom no doubt you have heard in America.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Mr. Brewer informs me that there is at
present in the Isle of Wight a particularly dangerous band of
crooks, and he fears that the announcement in the papers may
induce them to visit you.</p> <br>

<p>("Let 'em!" grunted Mr. Vandersluis.)</p>

<p class="typewriter">Our suggestion is that Mr. Brewer should
come to you to-morrow, disguised as a deck hand (our Mr. Brown,
the bearer of this, will point Mr. Brewer out to you, but it
would be inadvisable that he should meet you). Society, as you
know, is a prey to the malefactors of all nationalities, and it
would be a great pleasure to us to offer you this service, for
which no charge is made."</p> <br>

<p>It was signed "Douglas Campbell."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis folded the letter and looked at the bearer
over his glasses.</p>

<p>"Do you know the contents of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Henry B. pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"I don't like having sleuths on board," he said, "and I think
I am quite capable of looking after my own money, but if this
insurance fellow worries I don't mind. You can send a wire
telling Brewer he can come along. My secretary will see that it
is sent off."</p>

<p>He called to that worthy.</p>

<p>"George, put Mr. Brown up for the night. What do you
drink?"</p>

<p>"Lemonade, sir," said the virtuous Mr. Brown, and Henry B.
Vandersluis, who had fifty unopened cases of Moet and Chandon
1906 in the hold, groaned.</p>

<p>In the evening at dinner, however, Mr. Brown in a spirit of
reckless dissipation, took no less than two glasses of port,
which he insisted upon calling port wine, and under the mellowing
influence of alcohol he babbled freely. He and George and Henry
B. were the sole occupants of the long table, which filled an
almost regal dining-saloon.</p>

<p>"Society, bah!" said Mr. Vandersluis.</p>

<p>"That's what Mr. Campbell says," said Mr. Brown. "He says that
society&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to know what Mr. Campbell said," said Henry B.
inconsistently. "He has no right to discuss society the way he
does. In the first place, he is not a society man; in the second
place, he is society's servant&mdash;my servant."</p>

<p>"That's what Mr. Brewer tells him," said the undaunted Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>"Brewer? Oh, that's the fellow that is coming to-morrow.
What's he like? I seem to remember that I heard about him."</p>

<p>"He is a very nice man," said Brown enthusiastically. "He's a
most wonderful disguiser."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Mr. Vandersluis, "you needn't point him out to me.
I would spot him in a thousand. I know these detectives. There's
something about 'em that is unmistakable. It's a mare's nest,
this crooks' dope. What chance have they got of getting on board
here? I've twenty deck hands and stokers. I am half a mile from
the shore, and I can pull quicker and shoot straighter than any
man lying off Cowes to-night."</p>

<p>"I am sure you can," agreed Mr. Brown, helping himself to
another port wine. "The moment I saw you I said&mdash;'That man
can pull quicker and shoot straighter than any man lying off
Cowes to-night.'"</p>

<p>"They've all tried to skin me&mdash;the Moore gang and the
O'Donovans, and that feller that went over the water for twenty
years. They've all failed. They can't skin me, boy!"</p>

<p>"The first thing I said to myself when I saw you," said Mr.
Brown a little drowsily, "was&mdash;'That's the fellow they can't
skin.'"</p>

<p>Henry B. looked at him with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"It doesn't take much to affect you, and really, I think you
ought to have stuck to lemonade."</p>

<p>"I'm all ri&mdash;" said Mr. Brown heroically attempting to
rise, and sitting down unexpectedly, to judge from his look of
pained surprise which crossed his face.</p>

<p>"Make yourself comfortable in that chair. Here, give him a
hand up."</p>

<p>They lifted Mr. Brown and dropped him into a luxurious arm-
chair originally designed for the comfort of royalty, and there
they left him and went on deck.</p>

<p>It was Henry B.'s practice to sit on the deserted deck till
twelve o'clock, though he found no pleasure in the sound of
revelry by night, the bleating of distant gramophones, or the
sedate and distant "Hump! Hump!" of the Yachts Squadron Band.</p>

<p>George, his secretary, under a deck light, was playing
patience, and Mr. Vandersluis had left his seat, and was leaning
over the rail when a voice in the darkness hailed him. It did not
exactly hail him, but was addressed impersonally&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yacht ahoy!"</p>

<p>The hour was close on midnight, and Mr. Vandersluis hesitated,
for the voice was that of a woman.</p>

<p>Presently the voice spoke again, and this time it was
nearer.</p>

<p>"Help me, will you, please; I've lost an oar."</p>

<p>He peered down in the water, and only a few yards from the
yacht's gangway he detected a small boat. Without waiting to call
a deck hand, he ran down the companion ladder, lifted a coiled
line from its hook, and threw it dexterously in the direction of
the boat. The first time he missed, and had to pull in the wet
rope, but the second time he heard the "thwack!" of it fall
across the gunwales, and he hauled in.</p>

<p>It was a woman, and in the darkness he saw she was in evening-
dress. He lifted her on to the little platform, made fast the
dinghy, and supported her on to the deck. In the overhead lights
he saw she was young and beautiful. Her dress was expensive, and
the rope of pearls about her neck represented a fortune.</p>

<p>The girl was apparently overcome by fatigue, and dropped
limply into one of the padded chairs.</p>

<p>"Get some brandy, George," said Mr. Vandersluis, thrilled by
the adventure, "or open a bottle of that wine," he said,
brightening at the thought.</p>

<p>The girl drank the amber liquid eagerly, and looked up with a
grateful smile.</p>

<p>"I have been very foolish," she said. "I thought I could row
to my father's yacht. When I came out of the club the man was not
in the boat, so I rowed by myself. I am Lady Mary Glendellon,"
she introduced herself, "and my father is the Earl of
Crouboro."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," said Mr. Vandersluis huskily; "I was
hoping to meet your father, but he has had an important
engagement in Wales. I didn't know he was back."</p>

<p>The girl smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he's back," she said. "I am awfully grateful to you.
You have probably saved my life, and my father will never be
sufficiently grateful to you. It was so silly of me. I stayed
later at the club than I should; you see, really, we weren't at
the club at all," she said in a burst of frankness, "but at Lord
Bentel's place, but you mustn't tell father that, and we were
playing baccarat."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis smiled politely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you modern girls," he said. "What would your grandmother
think about playing baccarat."</p>

<p>She laughed and he laughed, and they were good friends at
once&mdash;so good that she refused his offer to provide a boat
for her to row back to her yacht.</p>

<p>"It's lovely here. What a beautiful boat," she said with an
admiring glance round. "Do let me see it before I go." He
escorted her round, and everything delighted her.</p>

<p>"I will come to-morrow and bring father," she said (Mr.
Vandersluis took a deep breath). "They really ought to see this
yacht. It's lovely. And I'll bring the Duchess of Thatcham. She
is a most delightful creature."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of the saloon, and the
girl was in before Henry B. realized that the occupant of one of
the large chairs was a dishevelled clerk. He nodded to his
secretary, who went in advance and skilfully swung the chair
round so that only its back was visible.</p>

<p>"And this is the saloon!" she said.</p>

<p>The table had been cleared, and great bowls of roses had taken
the place of the silver and glass. She sat herself down at one
end of the table, laid a big silk bag before her, and Mr.
Vandersluis sat on her left, his ear sensitive for any snores
which might come from the chair.</p>

<p>"This has been a very exciting day for me," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Are you sure I ought not to order a dinghy for you?" said Mr.
Vandersluis. "Won't the Earl be worried?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she laughed. "I don't think you are quite used to
our ways, Mr.&mdash;I didn't get your name."</p>

<p>"Vandersluis," he informed her.</p>

<p>"Yes, it has been an exciting day," she said, ticking off her
lingers. "I have been nearly lost at sea; I won £1,000 at
baccarat; I was nearly robbed of my pearls."</p>

<p>"Nearly robbed of your pearls?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" said the girl. "There's an awful lot of
people at Cowes&mdash;what do you call them&mdash;it's an
American word?"</p>

<p>"Crooks?" suggested Mr. Vandersluis.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the word. There are two men and a woman. You've
heard about them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis had not heard about them, but he nodded. It
was not his practice to admit that any secret of the world was a
secret to him.</p>

<p>"Well, it was this horrid woman herself&mdash;what do they
call her, Swift Sara?&mdash;isn't it a ridiculous name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have heard of Swift Sara," said Mr. Vandersluis in
truth. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"She came on board this morning," said her Ladyship,
"pretending that she had been engaged by me as a lady's maid. I
was ashore at the time, and as I had engaged a maid, nobody
questioned her. They showed her down to my cabin, and if it had
not been for the astuteness of our chief steward, who wouldn't
let her open a single box until I returned, she would have taken
everything."</p>

<p>"You're a very fortunate young woman. Did she escape?"</p>

<p>Lady Mary nodded.</p>

<p>"She made an excuse to go ashore, and she hasn't been seen
since," she said. "It worried me terribly. Otherwise I would not
have worn my pearls to-night."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis tried to continue the conversation, but he
found the lady absent-minded.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you would get your man to row me ashore?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Ashore?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the fever," she laughed gaily. Dipping her hand into
her bag she produced first a thick pack of cards, and then a
large roll of money.</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis was shocked, but he was amused.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you're not going back to lose that money," he
said.</p>

<p>"I shan't lose it," said the girl with confidence. "Why, I
have won consistently for twelve months."</p>

<p>"Look here, if you want to play baccarat you can play with
me," said Henry B. "I don't want to take your money," he said
hastily as he saw the girl hesitate.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, don't be horrid," she pleaded "If you like I'll
play, but you mustn't tell my father."</p>

<p>So they played, and Mr. Vandersluis won and won, and the
lady's roll grew thinner and thinner. He was wondering what
excuse he could make for returning the money, and congratulating
himself upon having touched the top notch in the most exclusive
set&mdash;for who does not know that the patronage of the Earl of
Crouboro is equivalent to a presentation at Court?&mdash;when she
produced an even bigger roll from the depths of her bag.</p>

<p>"It's all winnings, so you needn't mind taking it," she said.
"It is my bank, and I will make it £2,000."</p>

<p>"Banco!" said Mr. Vandersluis obligingly and lost.</p>

<p>With alternate winnings, he lost consistently for the greater
part of an hour. George was despatched to the safe under Henry
B.'s bunk and came back with a large wad of £100 notes, which
faded and faded and faded until what had resembled a volume of
the encyclopædia bore the appearance of a slender volume of
poems.</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis was getting hot. It was one thing to win from
the aristocracy, and devise means whereby the money could be
restored without hurt to the fair loser, but when the fair loser
had devised a method of her own which hurt nobody's feelings but
his&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open that port light," growled Mr. Vandersluis; "the saloon
is getting hot, and bring some more money."</p>

<p>The money came, and half-way through it her Ladyship looked at
her watch and uttered a little scream of consternation.</p>

<p>"A quarter past two," she said, thrusting some loose notes
into her bag; "really I must go now."</p>

<p>A little light passed the port-hole, and she jumped up and
looked out. "Oh, it's father's steam launch. He must have heard I
was on board," she said. "Good night, Mr. Vandersluis; I'll come
and see you in the morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis, who was perspiring heavily, and was conscious
of severe financial loss, held out his large hand.</p>

<p>"Won't you say good night to me?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Brown who stood by the door, his hands in his
pockets, a beatific smile on his face.</p>

<p>The girl raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"Won't you say good night to me, Sara?" said Bob Brewer. "It's
years and years and years since we met. Do you remember the night
I pinched you at what the newspapers picturesquely described as
your Long Island bower, for robbing James H. Seidlitz of
everything except his beautifully embroidered shirt?"</p>

<p>"Aw, you make me tired!" said the girl, then leapt like
lightning to the port-hole and cried a word of warning.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about your pals," said Bob lazily. "There's been
a police-boat waiting for them ever since you came on board."</p>

<p>"Then, then?" gasped Mr. Vandersluis, "she's not Earl
Crouboro's daughter?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about the Earl's private life," said Bob
carefully, "but if she is he's quite unconscious of the
fact."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"Of course," said Mr. Douglas Campbell, "he had
no claim on us, even if he lost his money at cards. That is a
risk we do not take, but you will get your commission just the
same, Bob. It only shows you that what society wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I want," said Bob, "is ten per cent, on the gross
savings, and I suggest to you that you should put it up to old
man Vandersluis that he hasn't a dog's chance of getting into the
Peerage unless he pays it!"</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">WHEN Henry B. Vamdersluis determined to break
into English society he went about his work in the same thorough,
businesslike manner which had enabled him to create in the
Vandersluis Furniture Corporation&mdash;the largest wonder of the
furnishing world. Nobody knows accurately how many acres of
ground are covered by the Vandersluis Works at Grand Rapids,
Michigan, and now that Mr. Vandersluis is a British citizen,
having forsworn his allegiance to the United States, it is
inexpedient to ask him, since he would probably fix his
uncomfortable monocle and ask:</p>

<p>"Is there such a place as Grand Rapids?"</p>

<p>He brought to Europe in the late nineties twenty million
dollars and a passionate admiration for the British aristocracy,
into the ranks of which he set himself to climb. And Henry B. was
<i>some</i> climber. His feet were so impervious to the icy
blasts of British indifference and to the rugged character of the
stony steps he was mounting that they grew neither cold nor
sore.</p>

<p>He bought a wonderful estate in Somersetshire, a town house in
Grosvenor Square, which has more dukes to the inch than any other
square. He bought a racing stable and equipped it with
thoroughbred race-horses which pranced down to the starting-gate
very proudly and came back to the winning-post at their leisure,
and he purchased with real money that curiosity which is so often
described in the public press but which is so very seldom
seen&mdash;"a floating palace."</p>

<p>The only people who can float palaces are company promoters,
and they only float picture palaces, anyway; but the steam yacht
<i>Oisa</i>, or as it was commonly designated in Southampton, the
<i>Oh I Say</i>, was palatial in its fittings, furnishings and
feedings. It was beautiful as to line, most powerfully engined,
skilfully captained, officered and manned, and lacked only one
thing to complete its palatial character. To cut a long story
short, the <i>Oisa</i> was a palace with a king but without
courtiers.</p>

<p>There were wonderful suites which were suitable for the
habitation of princes. They were mostly occupied by Mr.
Vandersluis's portly city friends who had no titles and few "h's"
to their names. There was a wonderful reception saloon in which
Mr. Vandersluis was wont to receive letters from the aristocracy
saying that they deeply regretted that owing to a previous
engagement they were unable to avail themselves of his kind
invitation to be present at the gala performance he had arranged
and begged to remain his very sincerely, <i>et cetera</i>.</p>

<p>Cowes week was beginning. The roadstead was gay with dainty
white craft. The lawn of the Yacht Squadron was packed with hot
but exclusive humanity. On every yacht, however small, was a gay
little party, except on the <i>Oisa</i>, where the party was
Henry B., who was neither gay nor little, for he weighed two
hundred and sixty pounds in his stocking feet.</p>

<p>He stood on the high poop of the <i>Oisa</i>, surrounded by
comfortable but empty deck-chairs and his secretary, a sallow
young man who chewed gum all day long and far into the night,
gazed through his <i>pince-nez</i> over the sun-kissed waves, and
wondered how long the old man would give him ashore.</p>

<p>Henry B. turned from a contemplation of the well-filled yachts
to his own tenantless poop.</p>

<p>"What was all that rumpus about on Lord Crouboro's yacht this
morning? You started in to tell me, but something interrupted
you."</p>

<p>The secretary smiled.</p>

<p>"Somebody tried to pinch her jewels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is 'her'?" demanded Henry B.</p>

<p>"His daughter &mdash; Lady Mary &mdash; what's the
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Glendellon," said Henry B. promptly, for he was a living
guide to the peerage.</p>

<p>"That's the name. It appears that a woman&mdash;some say it
was that damewho lifted the Croxley Plate at Palm
Beach&mdash;Swift Sarah."</p>

<p>"She ain't at Cowes?" exclaimed Henry B.</p>

<p>The secretary nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the story I heard from Vastor's secretary."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis experienced a jealous pang, for the Yastors
were now veritably British, and noble to boot.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" continued the young man, but for the second time
the story was interrupted.</p>

<p>"I thought my idea would have brought Lord Crouboro on board,"
he said, the name suggesting a theme more interesting than the
fate of Lady Mary's jewels. "They say he and his daughter gamble
and I got the best roulette table that he could find on any of
these yachts. D'ye think they know they can have a game."</p>

<p>"Sure," assented the secretary. "I have put it about very
thoroughly. I have seen a lot of fellows from the other yachts. I
have talked with the servants and passed the quiet tip that if
anybody likes to come aboard they will be welcome."</p>

<p>"Did you put in the paragraph I told you?"</p>

<p>George nodded, slipped his fingers into his waistcoat pocket,
and pulled out a folded newspaper cutting.</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis adjusted his glasses and read:</p> <br>

<p class="headline">A FLOATING BANK.<br> American Millionaire
Carries Half a Million Pounds on His Yacht.</p>

<p class="quote">Mr. Henry B. Vandcrsluis, a well-known figure in
London society&mdash;(Mr. Vandersluis groaned)&mdash;does not
bother about banks when he is on a yachting cruise and is ready
to move off to any part of the world and with this possibility in
view he carries aboard with him an enormous sum of money, reputed
to be half a million. There is method in this apparent
eccentricity because Mr. Vandersluis is a great art collector and
the necessity for cash transactions in this business is
obvious.</p>

<p><br> "I put a million first," explained George, "but the
newspaper fellow asked me to be reasonable, so I cut it down to
half."</p>

<p>"You would have thought that would get them," commented Mr.
Vandersluis. "I have never known money that didn't, and I don't
suppose my money's different from anybody else's. But somehow we
only attract the fellows we don't want. Who is this?"</p>

<p>He pointed over the side where a boat was rowing direct for
the yacht's gangway.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a real fellow," remarked Mr. Vandersluis
hopefully.</p>

<p>"He looks like a clerk to me,said the unimaginative George.
"Lords don't wear white flannels and black boots&mdash;not the
lords I've met."</p>

<p>The boatman brought his little craft alongside, and the
passenger stepped up the ladder. He lifted his straw hat to Mr.
Vandersluis and produced carefully from his inside pocket a
letter.</p>

<p>Henry B. was used to receiving letters. He turned it over and
read on the flap, "The Federated Assurances."</p>

<p>"Business, eh?" he said, ripped it open and read:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">DEAR SIR:</p>

<p>They lifted Mr. Brown and dropped him into a luxurious
armchair originally designed for the comfort of royalty.</p>

<p>Henry B.'s secretary, under a deck light was playing patience,
and Mr. Vandersluis had left his seat and was leaning over the
rail when a voice in the darkness hailed him: "Yacht ahoy!"</p>

<p>The hour was close on midnight, and Mr. Vandersluis hesitated,
for the voice was that of a woman, and it might have been
directed to any of the yachts within a radius of two hundred
yards, for it was a still night.</p>

<p>Presently the voice spoke again, and this time it was
nearer.</p>

<p>"Help me, will you please? I've lost an oar."</p>

<p>He peered down in the water, and only a few yards from the
yacht's gangway he detected a small boat. Without waiting to call
a deck-hand, he ran down the companion ladder.</p>

<p>It was a woman, and in the darkness he saw she was in evening
dress. He lifted her on to the little platform, made fast the
dingey, and supported her to the deck. In the overhead lights he
saw she was young and beautiful. Her dress was expensive, and the
rope of pearls about her neck represented a fortune. This he saw
at once, because it was Henry B.'s way to classify humanity in
dollar units.</p>

<p>The girl was apparently overcome by fatigue and dropped limply
into one of the padded chairs.</p>

<p>"Get some brandy, George," said Mr. Vandersluis, thrilled by
the adventure; "or open a bottle of that wine," he added,
brightening at the thought.</p>

<p>The girl drank the amber liquid eagerly, and looked up with a
grateful smile.</p>

<p>"I have been very foolish," she said. "I thought I could row
to my father's yacht. When I came out of the club the man was not
in the boat, so I rowed by myself. I am Lady Mary Glendellon,"
she introduced herself, "and my father is the Earl of
Crouboro."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," said Mr. Vandersluis huskily. " I was
hoping to meet your father, but he has had an important
engagement in Wales. I didn't know he was back."</p>

<p>The girl smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's back," she said. " I am awfully grateful to
you. You have probably saved my life, and my father will never be
sufficiently thankful to you. It was so silly of me. I stayed
later at the club than I should&mdash;you see, really, we weren't
at the club at all," she added in a burst of frankness, "but at
Lord Bentel's place; but you mustn't tell father that we were
playing baccarat."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis smiled politely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you modern girls," he said, "what would your grandmother
think about playing baccarat."</p>

<p>She laughed, and he laughed, and they were good friends at
once, so good that she refused his offer to provide a boat for
her to row back to her yacht.</p>

<p>"It's lovely here. What a beautiful boat!" she exclaimed with
an admiring glance around. "Do let me see it." He escorted her on
the rounds, and everything delighted her.</p>

<p>"I will come to-morrow and bring father," she said. Mr.
Vandersluis took a deep breath. "He really ought to see this
yacht. It's lovely. And I'll bring the Duchess of Thatcham. She
is a most delightful creature."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the door of the saloon, and the
girl was in before Henry B. realized that the occupant of one of
the large chairs was a disheveled clerk. He nodded to his
secretary, who went in advance and skilfully swung the chair
round so that only its back was visible.</p>

<p>"And this is the saloon!" she said. The table had been
cleared, and great bowls of roses had taken the place of the
silver and glass. She sat herself down at one end of the table,
laid a big silk bag before her, and Mr. Vandersluis sat on her
left, his ear sensitive for any snores which might come from the
chair.</p>

<p>"This has been a very exciting day for me," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Are you sure I ought not to order a dingey for you?"
suggested Mr. Vandersluis. "Won't the Earl be worried?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she laughed. " I don't think you are quite used to
our ways, Mr.&mdash;I didn't get your name."</p>

<p>"Vandersluis," he informed her.</p>

<p>"You see we keep extraordinary hours, and really in society
nobody worries about people unless they don't come in to
breakfast"</p>

<p>"And you say it has been an exciting day," said Mr.
Vandersluis, desiring to continue a conversation which was wholly
delectable.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?" die replied, ticking off her fingers. "I
have been nearly lost at sea. I won one thousand pounds at
baccarat. I was nearly robbed of my pearls."</p>

<p>"Nearly robbed of your pearls?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard. There's an awful lot of people at Cowes.
What do you call them&mdash;it's an American word?"</p>

<p>"Crooks?" suggested Mr. Vandersluis.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the word. There are two men and a woman. You've
heard about them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis had not heard about them, but he nodded. It
was not his practise to admit that any secret of the world was a
secret to him.</p>

<p>"Well, it was this horrid woman herself&mdash;what do they
call her&mdash;Swift Sarah&mdash;isn't it a ridiculous name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have heard of Swift Sarah," said Mr. Vandersluis in
truth. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"She came on board this morning," explained her ladyship,
"pretending that she had been engaged by me as a lady's maid. I
was ashore at the time, and as I had engaged a maid, nobody
questioned her. They showed her down to my cabin, and if it had
not been for the astuteness of our chief steward, who wouldn't
let her open a single box until I returned, she would have taken
everything."</p>

<p>"You're a very fortunate young woman. Did she escape?"</p>

<p>Lady Mary nodded.</p>

<p>"She made an excuse to go ashore and she hasn't been seen
since. It worried me terribly. Otherwise I would not have worn my
pearls to-night."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis tried to continue the conversation, but he
found the lady absent-minded.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you would get your man to row me ashore," she
said.</p>

<p>"Ashore?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the fever," she laughed gaily. Dipping her hand into
her bag, she produced, first a thick pack of cards and then a
large roll of money. Mr. Vandersluis was amused.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you're not going back to lose that money," he
said.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't lose it," answered the girl with confidence. "Why,
I have won consistently for twelve months."</p>

<p>"Look here, if you want to play baccarat you can play with
me," said Henry B. "I don't want to take your money," he added
hastily as he saw the girl hesitate.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't be horrid," she pleaded. "If you like, I'll
play, but you mustn't tell my father."</p>

<p>So they played, and Mr. Vandersluis won and won, and the
lady's roll grew thinner and thinner. He was wondering what
excuse he could make for returning the money, and congratulating
himself upon having touched the top-notch in the most exclusive
set&mdash;for who does not know that the patronage of the Earl of
Crouboro is equivalent to a presentation at court&mdash; when she
produced an even bigger roll from the depths of her bag.</p>

<p>"It's all winnings, so you needn't mind taking it," she said.
"It is my bank, and I will make it two thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Banco!" said Mr. Vandersluis obligingly, and lost.</p>

<p>With alternate winnings he lost consistently for the greater
part of an hour. George was dispatched to the safe under Henry
B.'s bunk, and came back with a large wad of one-hundred-pound
notes. Mr. Vandersluis was getting hot. It was one thing to win
from the aristocracy and devise means whereby the money could be
returned without hurt to the fair loser, but when the fair loser
had devised a method which hurt nobody's feelings but
his&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open that port-light," growled Mr. Vandersluis; "the saloon
is getting hot, and bring some more money."</p>

<p>The money came, and half-way through it, her Ladyship looked
at her watch and uttered a little scream of consternation.</p>

<p>"A quarter past two," she said, thrusting some loose notes
into her bag. " Really, I must go now."</p>

<p>A little light passed the port-hole and she jumped up and
looked out.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is father's steam launch. He must have heard I was on
board. Good night, Mr. Vandersluis, I'll come and see you in the
morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Vandersluis, who was perspiring heavily, and was conscious
of severe financial loss, held out his large hand.</p>

<p>"Won't you say good night to me?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Brown who stood by the door, his hands in his
pockets, smiling.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"Won't you say good night to me, Sarah," went on Bob Brewer.
"It's years and years and years since we met. Do you remember the
night I pinched you at what the newspapers picturesquely
described as your Long Island bower, for robbing James H.
Seidlitz of everything except his beautifully embroidered
shirt?"</p>

<p>"Aw, you make me tired!" said the girl, then leaped like
lightning to the port-hole and cried a word of warning.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about your pals," said Bob lazily. "There's been
a police boat waiting for them since you came aboard."</p>

<p>"Then," gasped Mr. Vandersluis, "she's not the Earl of
Crouboro's daughter?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about the Earl's private life," answered Bob
carefully, "but if she is, he's quite unconscious of the
fact."</p>

<p><br>"OF course," said Mr. Douglas Campbell, "he had no claim
on us, even if he lost his money at cards. That is a risk we do
not take, but you will get your commission just the same, Bob. It
only shows you that what society wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I want," said Bob, "is ten per. cent on the gross
savings, and I suggest to you that you put it up to old man
Vandersluis that he hasn't a dog's chance of getting into the
peerage unless he pays it!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="story4">IV. &mdash; A RACE AT OSTEND</a></h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT do people go to Ostend for?" asked Bob
Brewer irritably, addressing the general manager of Federated
Assurances.</p>

<p>Douglas Campbell shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why do people do anything?" he asked, "because somebody else
does it. Ostend I like, personally. I like to paddle with the
kids and to bathe with the girls."</p>

<p>"Phew!" said Bob, fanning himself vigorously.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Mr. Campbell hastily, "I like the mixed
bathing; I like the sea, and I like the Digue, and I like to sit
in the Kursaal and listen to the orchestra."</p>

<p>"Nobody cares what you like," said Bob. "I am asking why
regular people who have got money to spend do it?"</p>

<p>"Well, there are the races," explained Mr. Campbell; "there's
the Cercle Privee where you can make or lose money, according to
your luck. There's the perfectly delightful air, the
lobsters&mdash;anyway, people go to Ostend, and I have booked you
an inexpensive room at a nice little hotel near the docks."</p>

<p>"You can cancel that," said Bob, "and book me a suite de luxe
at the Splendid, which I understand is the most expensive of the
hotels."</p>

<p>"But, my dear chap, there's nothing on," said the desperate
Mr. Campbell; "you are simply going over with a watching brief.
You are not taking on any special job. In fact, it's a kind of
holiday for you. The directors feel that they would like you to
enjoy yourself without any worry or care. Of course, if you see a
man go up to one of our clients and take his pearl pin, you will
do your best to persuade him not to. But there is no special
reason why you should go over."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't go," said the other.</p>

<p>"At the same time," Mr. Campbell was in a hurry to explain,
"there are four necklaces and a collar of diamonds already there;
about £100,000 worth of pearls which are going on Saturday's
boat, and quite a number of emeralds which are due to leave next
week."</p>

<p>"What am I to do with these interesting jewels if I see them?"
asked Bob. "I presume you mean that people who are owners of
these baubles, and who are heavily insured with this office, are
either in Ostend or are going there. You don't mean to suggest
that three or four necklaces are going to walk arm-in-arm on the
boat, or that I shall meet an emerald in the smoking-room
drinking an absinthe frappe?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean," said Mr. Campbell. "You go over and
keep your eyes skinned."</p>

<p>"It is not keeping my eyes skinned that worries me. It's
sitting on a confoundedly hot beach getting my nose skinned that
worries me. But because you are a nice, kind Scotsman, or rather
you bear a Scottish name, which is altogether different, I will
oblige you. Book me that suite at the Splendid."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you go disguised as a humble tourist?" asked Mr.
Campbell anxiously, "and live in accordance with your role."</p>

<p>"I am going disguised as an arrogant millionaire&mdash;I find
I can live up to that part much better," said Bob.</p>

<p>It was, however, at the more modest establishment, the Hôtel
des Thermes, which during the war had been a regimental
headquarters of the German Army, and had been bombed accordingly,
that Bob took up his residence. He spent the first day in a
motor-car, visiting the battlefields between Dixmude and Ypres,
and came back in a chastened frame of mind.</p>

<p>He went to the Kursaal that night and heard the music,
strolled into the Cercle Privee and found it very interesting,
searched a few cafes in the hope of meeting undesirable
acquaintances, and drew blank, and went to bed that night with
the conviction that whatever temptations divers unattached ropes
of pearls, diamonds and emeralds might offer to the criminal
classes, Ostend at the moment was singularly innocent.</p>

<p>When he turned out to take the early morning sunshine he
thought he had never seen Ostend looking so beautiful. The
flower-beds in the centre of the broad avenue leading to the
Kursaal blazed with colour. The building, white and delicate
looking, the glass-fronted restaurants, the flower-decked
balconies all combined to produce that sense of a holiday which
only the Continental town can bring to the stranger.</p>

<p>After breakfast, he strolled into the office of the chief of
police, and the Belgian greeted him as a long-lost brother, for
they had worked together in New York two years before the
war.</p>

<p>"No," said the chief, "there's no bad men here. We watch the
boats very carefully, and so do the British police at the other
end. Lew Simmons got through, but I pulled him in and sent him
back by the next boat. A couple of crooks&mdash;who came from
Paris by way of Brussels&mdash;I caught the first day they were
here, and they are in prison at Ghent on a charge of travelling
with forged passports. No, Monsieur Brewer, Ostend is
blameless."</p>

<p>"It's too blamed blameless to be good," said Bob. "It isn't
natural with all this portable property lying about, and the
right hooks of crookdom suffering from chronic itch for spoil,
that you should not shelter a lad or two who is collecting
material for his great work on 'How I got Rich at Ostend, By One
who Did It.'"</p>

<p>"It does seem unreal," admitted the Belgian, "but there you
are! I've been through the Coq d'Or crowd with a small tooth-
comb, if you will pardon the vulgarity."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll pardon it," said Bob; "I've been through there
myself. It's full of simple-minded people drinking lemon squash
and playing dominoes. Yet I can't escape the conviction that a
raid is being planned. By-the-way, isn't Teddy Bolter in
Belgium?"</p>

<p>The police chief nodded.</p>

<p>"A reformed character, monsieur," he said emphatically. "He
was in Brussels during the occupation by the Germans, and
rendered invaluable assistance to Belgium. He is running a little
American bar here in this town. You will find it in the rue Petit
Leopold."</p>

<p>"I'll see Teddy," said Bob&mdash;and to Teddy he went.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolter was a stout, broad-shouldered man of middle age. He
carried in his face a cigar, which maintained itself at an angle
of forty-five degrees, and never seemed to grow any shorter.</p>

<p>"Why! if it isn't Mr. Brewer," he said, extending a hearty
hand across the zinc counter. "Well, wonders will never cease.
Will you have a soft drink, Mr. Brewer, or shall I make you a
nice Bronx, Manhattan, Ginsling Martini, Clover Club?"</p>

<p>"Get thee behind me, Satan," said Bob; "how are things,
Teddy?"</p>

<p>"Bright and straight," said Teddy slowly and deliberately,
emphasizing the last word; "and honourable old age for mine and a
lovely little villa at St. Jean de Luz, where I can tell my
golden-haired grandchildren the story of my adventurous
life."</p>

<p>"Very, very pretty," said Bob; "that's the stuff to give 'em,
Teddy. I can see you sitting in front of your château, bathed in
the golden sunlight, spielling the story of how you smashed the
Bank of Detroit and shot up the watchman. It's a story," Bob
mused, "which would bring tears to the eyes of the young and
innocent," he added, "and golden-haired."</p>

<p>"Say, that's all gone by," said Teddy. "I'm straight now, Mr.
Brewer. Gee! If I had my life to live over again."</p>

<p>"It's hardly likely that you will have," said Bob; "so why
worry. Any of the boys here?"</p>

<p>"Boys?" said the puzzled Mr. Bolter, "you don't mean crooks, I
hope, because if you do I haven't seen one for years&mdash;except
my Dago bar-tender, who dipped into the till and lit out for
Holland."</p>

<p>"Deepest regrets," said Bob; "a new experience for you,
Teddy."</p>

<p>Mr. Bolter ignored the implication.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, energetically swabbing the counter as he
spoke. "I'm through with that game. I've got a nice lot of
customers. All the trainers and jockeys come in here, and I get a
lot of information about horses. I suppose you're not staying for
the races, are you, Mr. Brewer?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," said Bob. "My movements are a little
uncertain."</p>

<p>"Here on business, perhaps?" suggested the other
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I am making a business of pleasure just now," said Bob; "but
if I stay on I'll come to you for a tip."</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble to come," said Teddy earnestly. "I can
tell you what will win the big handicap&mdash;Thotis, the English
horse that has come over to run, Mr. Mandle Jones's."</p>

<p>Bob was on his way to the door, but at the name of Mr. Mandle
Jones he turned, for who did not know Mandle Jones (his father
was born Mendlessohn), the young gentleman who had discovered 195
novel ways of losing money?</p>

<p>"I'd like to do you a good turn, sir," Teddy went on, but was
stopped by the queer look in the other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Would you, Teddy?" said Bob quietly. "Well, I don't know that
you owe me any great love."</p>

<p>"Let bygones be bygones," said Teddy stoutly. "You were only
doing your duty, and I'm not a man that harbours malice. You back
Thotis. It arrived from England this morning, and if it doesn't
win I'll eat my boots."</p>

<p>"A fat lot of good that would do me," said Bob, "if I had
backed it. However, I'll take your word for it."</p>

<p>He went back to his hotel, to find a telegram, which
ran:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Urgent; am coming to Ostend. Meet me this afternoon's
boat."</p>

<p>Bob knit his forehead over this, but punctually at the hour
was waiting on the quay when the <i>Princess Clementine</i> came
alongside.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Ostend," said Bob extravagantly, as Douglas
Campbell stepped ashore. "You have just come in time to make
money. I've had a great tip for to-morrow's race."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell looked at him.</p>

<p>"It isn't Thotis by any chance, is it?" he asked, and Bob
stared.</p>

<p>"Now, you've been reading the sporting newspapers," he said.
"What do you know about Thotis?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Campbell; "except that I've come over with the
owner. I want to introduce you to him. Just stand here for a
little while."</p>

<p>The owner was a young man who looked as if he had stepped out
of a band-box, so polished and well creased was he,</p>

<p>"Hello, Campbell!" he said, "I thought I had got rid of
you."</p>

<p>"May I introduce Mr. Robert Brewer?" said Campbell, and the
young man favoured Bob with a nod, and after a few generalities
passed on to join his valet at the Customs counter.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" asked Bob. Campbell did not explain till
they reached the hotel.</p>

<p>"Bob," he said, "I have often talked to you about the follies
of society."</p>

<p>"Too often," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Well," said Campbell, "I am inclined to revise my opinion. I
discovered yesterday that one of our companies had effected a
policy which, for sheer insanity and one-sidedness is about the
worst thing I have seen in all my career. That a member of
society should have put one over on us makes me, as I say, revise
my opinion of the aristocracy."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake!" said Bob, "you are not referring to young
Mendleheimer in these flattering terms."</p>

<p>"That's the man," nodded Mr. Campbell. "His blood may not be
as blue as the Bruces or the Stuarts, but he is very popular and
has money to burn. Now listen to this."</p>

<p>He took out his pocket-book and drew forth a folded paper,
which he opened.</p>

<p>"This is the rough scheme of his policy. 'We undertake to
insure all his personal property against burglary, larceny,
whether larceny from the person or from the house, larceny by
fraud, larceny by trick, and robbery by violence.' Now, nobody
who knows this young man's habits would have effected a policy
like that, and the manager that put it through has been fired and
the director who endorsed the policy has had to resign. It has
six months to run, and hitherto he has been watched by the
insurance company concerned. But now, in the terms of a contract
by which the company in question came into the Federation, the
liability is ours."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Bob.</p>

<p>"Well," said Campbell, "that poor, misguided young man has
brought £30,000 in Bank of England notes to Ostend to back this
very horse you spoke of."</p>

<p>Bob scratched his chin.</p>

<p>"That's absurd," he said; "how could he put £30,000 on his
horse in the totalizer; he would get such a poor return for his
money that it wouldn't be worth doing. Besides, what if he does
lose it, or risk it? You have not insured him against betting
losses."</p>

<p>"We have insured him against larceny by a trick, and I am
convinced it is by a trick he is going to lose it; because,
according to people who understand such things, his horse cannot
be beaten."</p>

<p>"I'll have a talk with him," said Bob, after a moment's
thought; "I am rather curious on one point."</p>

<p>"Talk with him after dinner. He is coming to dine with me to-
night."</p>

<p>Mr. Mandle Jones came to dinner, but with an ill grace,
evidently regretting his appointment.</p>

<p>"Look here, you fellows," he said, "I shan't be able to stay
long, and why you came over goodness knows!" he said to Campbell.
"If you don't mind my being perfectly frank&mdash;that's my weak
point, frankness&mdash;I think it was a bit of cheek of your
company to interfere. Just as if I wasn't to be trusted with
money."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones," said Campbell earnestly, "I was an old friend of
your father, and the least I can do is to look after his son's
interests."</p>

<p>Mandle Jones laughed.</p>

<p>"I know all about you," he said. "I've got a funny insurance
policy which you have just taken over haven't I?" he winked at
Bob. "I forget the details, but do you guarantee me against any
losses I incur at horse-racing?"</p>

<p>"That's the question I was asking," smiled Bob. "I can't see
you losing anyway, if all I hear about the horse is true; but I
certainly can't see you winning anything."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mandle Jones sharply.</p>

<p>Bob shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, you know how the Pari Mutuel works. The money taken by
the totalizer is divided up, less 10 per cent, amongst those who
have backed the winning horse. Suppose you have a big bet,
£30,000 shall I say?"</p>

<p>"You evidently know all about it," grinned Mandle Jones.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you do, and the general public subscribe
£20,000 between them on yours and other horses. That means
£60,000 to be divided out, less 10 per cent. Obviously you cannot
make much more profit than about £10,000."</p>

<p>"Agreed, my buck," smiled Mandle Jones jovially, "and that is
why I am not going to bet on the infernal totalizer."</p>

<p>"But what bookmaker would take your money?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Burgen &amp; Brock," replied the other promptly, and Bob
noted the names. "I have fixed it up with them. They are going to
lay me four to one to my money. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"I think they must be philanthropists," said Bob.</p>

<p>When the young man had left the dining-room he rose.</p>

<p>"I am going out to make a few inquiries, Campbell. Bookmakers
don't bet in that big way, and somehow it doesn't seem natural to
me."</p>

<p>He sought out the hall-porter, a mine of accurate information
on all things Belgian.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, monsieur. I know Burgen &amp; Brock. It is the
oldest established bookmaking firm in Belgium."</p>

<p>"Are they straight?" asked Bob bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, perfectly straight, and in the old days all the
aristocracy who came here used to bet with them. Of course, they
have had a bad time during the war like everybody else. Mr.
Burgen died, and Mr. Brock carries on the business."</p>

<p>He strolled into the Cercle Privee at the Kursaal, and found
two or three men who were associated with British sport whom he
knew well. Lord Tathington was one of these, and his Lordship was
very emphatic.</p>

<p>"Both Burgen and Brock are straight," he said. "Brock, who has
the business now since his partner died, is as honourable a man
as you could wish to deal with. Why do you ask? Have you had a
bet with them?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bob. "Where does Brock live?"</p>

<p>"He has an office in Brussels, but either he or his
representative attend the Ostend races."</p>

<p>Bob looked at his watch. He had ten minutes to catch the night
train to Brussels, and though it meant travelling in evening
dress, he made the journey, arriving in the middle of the
night.</p>

<p>It was not until lunch time on the day of the races that
Douglas Campbell, an uneasy man&mdash;he was cursed with a
psychic sense of impending loss&mdash;saw his sleuth.</p>

<p>"What have you discovered?" asked Campbell.</p>

<p>"Lots of things," replied Bob. "Say, have you ever tried
making inquiries about the stability of a bookmaker at 3 a.m. in
a foreign town? Unless I am greatly mistaken about Mandle Jones,
he is one of those simple souls who have implicit faith in
themselves and nobody else."</p>

<p>Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"So I thought."</p>

<p>"But I think it is a little too late to make explanations to
him. I want you to do exactly as I tell you."</p>

<p>"They are not going to poison the horse, are they?" asked
Campbell.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't imagine so," said Bob. "I believe the horse is
very well guarded, and there is not a chance of getting at him.
At least, my brief inquiries lead to this view."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean when you say I have got to carry out
your instructions?" asked Douglas Campbell fearfully.</p>

<p>"You must agree to every suggestion I make, and now if you are
ready we will go to the Hippodrome."</p>

<p>The Wellington Hippodrome was crowded with race-goers, and
with difficulty they made their way into the paddock. The numbers
had gone up for the first race, but it was not until that race
was being run and the paddock was comparatively empty that they
saw Mandle Jones, who also saw them and tried to avoid them. But
Bob was not to be avoided. He planted himself squarely in the
young owner's way.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones, I have got a plain proposition to make to
you."</p>

<p>"Chuck it off your chest," said Mandle Jones inelegantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you first of all that I am a detective, and
it is my job to make inquiries. Are you backing your horse with
ready money?"</p>

<p>Jones frowned and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said shortly. "I have brought the money with
me."</p>

<p>"In £1000 notes, I presume?" said Bob.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Will you do me this favour?" the detective went on. "Don't
back this horse of yours until it has gone to the post."</p>

<p>"You can bet your life I shan't," smiled the other, "not until
I see him safe on the course do I invest a penny."</p>

<p>"That's promise number one," said Bob. "You have been offered
four to one on your money. Does it seem strange to you that the
bookmakers guarantee this price up to the time of the race?"</p>

<p>"It's a gamble for them," said Mr. Jones. "What's the next
thing you want?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you that later," said Bob.</p>

<p>The crowd came swarming back into the paddock and waited with
patience till the price of the last winner was displayed on the
Pari Mutuel board and then the betting began for the Municipal
Cup.</p>

<p>Bob saw with interest that on the bookmaker's list Thotis was
a two to one chance and was never quoted at more than five to
two. He took his place near the mild and speckled young man who
stood in line with the other bookmakers and bore the magic legend
upon the band of his straw hat&mdash;"Burgen and Brock."</p>

<p>Presently he saw Mr. Mandle Jones approach him, and gripping
Campbell's arm he moved towards him. The horses were leaving the
paddock, and Mr. Jones had kept his promise.</p>

<p>"Don't detain me," said the young man; "put your proposition
as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>"It is this," said Bob. "Burgen &amp; Brock offer you four to
one for your money. Mr. Campbell offers you five to one."</p>

<p>The wail of protest which rose to Campbell's lips was not
heard in the din. Mandle Jones hesitated.</p>

<p>"But you are not a bookmaker."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt Mr. Campbell's ability to pay?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the young man, and looked over Bob's
shoulder to the expectant representative of Burgen &amp;
Brock.</p>

<p>"Is it a bet?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. Mandle Jones came from a race whose passion in life is to
bet a little over the odds.</p>

<p>"It's a bet," he said.</p>

<p>Bob held out his hand and thirty crisp £1000 notes were
counted in.</p>

<p>"You lay me £150,000 to £30,000," said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>Douglas Campbell could make no reply, but Bob was prompt.</p>

<p>"That's the size of it," he said, and gripping Campbell's arm
more closely he led him unprotesting and dazed to the front of
the stands.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you're mad!" gasped Campbell. "Good heavens! we
shall have to pay if it wins. You're mad, Brewer! You've ruined
me!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Bob. "Look at the pretty racehorses lined up at
the gate&mdash;they're off!"</p>

<p>The gate snapped, and ten horses leapt forward like one. Bob
was watching the race through his glasses, and knew the worst
after the horses had gone two furlongs. Right ahead of the field
stretched Thotis, two lengths in front of everything. The race is
easily described. Thotis led from start to finish, and won in a
canter by six lengths.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Bob kindly. "This, I fear, is a slight shock
for you."</p>

<p>Campbell could only shake his head helplessly, and at that
moment the jubilant Mandle Jones came towards them with long
strides.</p>

<p>"How did he do it? Well, Campbell, old sport, I hope you like
bookmaking. You can give me a cheque on your jolly old insurance
company for the £150,000, and I'll take my £30,000 back."</p>

<p>"Don't be precipitate, young sir," said Bob.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other suspiciously.</p>

<p>"The boy, Seul, who rode your horse, is a great pal of a dear
old friend of mine, one Teddy Bolter, of whom you have never
heard, but he is a gentleman who gets his money by fleecing the
mugs."</p>

<p>"Here, I say," said Mr. Jones explosively, "I don't want to
hear a lecture on jockeys."</p>

<p>"Come away, Brewer." It was Douglas Campbell, who had found
his voice, but had found it very shaky. "I will arrange for that
cheque for you, Mr. Jones, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A man ran past from the direction of the weighing-room and
shouted something. "Hey, what's that?" said Bob.</p>

<p>"It sounded to me as though your horse had been disqualified
for carrying short weight," said Bob. "I should go along and find
out if I were you."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones raced back to the weighing-room to discover the sad
truth. Thotis was disqualified. One of the leaden weights which
had been placed in the saddle-bag to bring the jockey's weight up
to that which the horse had to carry had mysteriously
disappeared.</p>

<p>They found it later in the afternoon on an unfrequented part
of the field, where the jockey had thrown it on his way down to
the post, having extracted it whilst seemingly adjusting his
stirrups.</p>

<p>"I went to Brussels last night," said Bob, on the way back to
the hotel, "and found that the business of Burgen &amp; Brock had
been sold earlier this year to Mr. Bolter for £5,000. Bolter did
not associate himself with the business, knowing that sooner or
later he would catch a rich boob lured by the traditional honesty
of the firm. You will probably find that it was Bolter who
suggested this horse running. He has always one or two touts
working for him, and certainly it was Bolter who got in touch
with Mandleheimer and offered him this magnificent bet. We shall
have to give that child back his £30,000, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Campbell, "I suppose we shall. But tell me,
Bob, wasn't I acting as a commission agent?"</p>

<p>"You were," said Bob, anticipating the next question, "but you
get no commission except the commission of a good conscience and
three minutes of excitement that should last you for life."</p>

<p>"I had that all right," said Mr. Campbell, shivering at the
recollection.</p>

<h2><a id="story5">V. &mdash; THE HEPPLEWORTH PEARLS</a></h2>

<p class="first">LORD HEPPLEWORTH looked over his pince-nez at
his young wife, who sat at the other side of the breakfast-
table&mdash;as far, if the truth be told, as she could get from
her lord and master&mdash;and remarked:</p>

<p>"My dear, the young man from the insurance company will be
here at ten o'clock precisely."</p>

<p>Gladys, Countess Heppleworth, yawned.</p>

<p>"What is he coming for?" she asked indifferently, and Lord
Heppleworth shuddered.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "how often have I told you never to employ
a sentence which ends in a preposition? You should ask&mdash;'Why
is he coming?' or, 'For what reason does he come?"</p>

<p>Lady Heppleworth looked wearily out of the window and
suppressed a sigh.</p>

<p>"He is coming, of course, to inquire into the loss of the
Heppleworth pearl," said his Lordship; "a most mysterious and
baffling business, which I confess puzzles even me."</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth was something over fifty, a lean, fair man,
innocent of humour and wholly devoid of imagination. The mystery
of the Heppleworth pearls was not, in the eyes of his friends, so
great a mystery as that of his marriage. The last person in the
world one would have imagined this childless widower would take
to wife was Gladys de Vere, who played small parts in the
Colidrome revues. Society was shocked and grieved, and waited for
Lord Heppleworth's explanation. The possibility that he had
fallen in love with a pretty face and a pert manner did not occur
to them, because they were of the opinion, as are so many people,
that there are certain types of men to whom a pretty face does
not appeal.</p>

<p>The truth is, of course, that no such type of man exists. It
is true to say that Lord Heppleworth never regretted his
marriage. It is equally true that Lady Heppleworth seldom ceased
to regret it. She had had dreams of a most wonderful
time&mdash;of parties, of trips to the Continent, of living in a
gay whirl from morn till night, year in and year out. The reality
was a little different.</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth had an estate in Shropshire, where he spent
eight months of the year, and a town house in London where he
spent four months of the year. He left his town residence for his
country seat on precisely the same day and at exactly the same
hour every year, and he returned as punctually. He dined at the
same restaurant every night; he went to the opera in the season;
he attended committee meetings at his club, and took a mild
interest in bees, with special and particular reference to the
Mason bee. He did not dance or jazz, or do any evil thing, save
play auction bridge for penny points.</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth folded his copy of <i>The Times</i> and rang
the bell for the maid.</p>

<p>"Parker," he said, "there are three pieces of bacon left;
kindly preserve them, I like cold bacon for supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, m'Lord," said the girl.</p>

<p>"And I notice," said his Lordship, "that there were six loaves
of bread purchased last week in excess of the quantity usually
ordered. Can you account for this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'Lord," said the girl. "Her Ladyship had the extra
bread to take into the park to feed the ducks."</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth raised his protruding eyebrows at his
wife.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear," he said reproachfully, "isn't that a
terrible waste? Don't you realize that there are thousands of
poor children who would be most grateful for this bread that you
are literally throwing to the ducks?"</p>

<p>Lady Heppleworth shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll send the bread to the poor," she said.</p>

<p>"That is unnecessary," said his Lordship, "absolutely
unnecessary. There exist philanthropic societies and
institutions, with one of which I am associated, which carry out
the distribution of food in a properly systematic manner."</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do?" asked the girl, flouncing round
exasperated. "Am I to sit here all day long twiddling my
fingers?"</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth raised his hand in protest.</p>

<p>"One moment, my dear," he said. Then, turning to the servant,
"Parker, you may go. Now, my dear," he said when the door had
closed, "let me ask you again to control yourself in the presence
of servants. You have really nothing to complain about. You have
a very generous allowance."</p>

<p>"Generous!" scoffed the girl. "Two hundred a year!"</p>

<p>"A very generous allowance, I assure you," said his Lordship.
"When I was at Eton my father allowed me £50 a year and expected
me to save money on it. And, what is more, I did," he said with
some satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you did," said the girl.</p>

<p>There was a discreet knock at the door, and Parker was back
again.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman to see your Lordship," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Hasn't he a card?" demanded Lord Heppleworth, then looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"It must be the man from the insurance company," he said in a
low tone to his wife. "Show him in here, Parker, You had better
be present, my dear, because you will be able to supply him with
information."</p>

<p>Bob Brewer came into the sunny breakfast-room, bowed to the
girl and nodded to the man, whom he knew by sight.</p>

<p>"You are the young man from the insurance company, I suppose?"
said Lord Heppleworth. "Will you please take a seat? Will you
entertain Mr.&mdash;er?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Brewer's my name," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Will you entertain Mr. Brewer, my dear, whilst I get the
pearls?" said his Lordship.</p>

<p>"I think there's a great deal of fuss being made over the loss
of a pearl," said the girl when her husband had gone.</p>

<p>"A pearl?" repeated Bob, interested, "I understood it was the
necklace that had been stolen."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Lady Heppleworth quickly, "only one pearl. I
suppose he has insured them with you?"</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes; the pearls are insured with us for £25,000. I suppose
you have informed the police?"</p>

<p>"No; I do not think he has informed the police" (she never
referred to Wilfred Emmerly, Earl of Heppleworth and Viscount
Chipstone, in any way otherwise than "he"). "He'll tell you all
about it when he comes back," she said; "I think a great fuss is
being made."</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the return of Lord
Heppleworth, carrying in his hand a flat, black leather case.
This he opened, and displayed against a blue velvet interior one
of the most beautiful ropes of pearls that Bob had ever seen.</p>

<p>"In that string," said his Lordship, "are, or were, sixty-
three pearls. They are famous amongst jewels, having been
acquired by my great grandfather who, as you know, was one of the
Governors of Madras in the reign of William IV. They were
originally the property of an Indian rajah, who gave them to my
ancestor for services which he was fortunate enough to render to
his Highness."</p>

<p>"I know the story," said Bob readily. "Your relation ran away
with the rajah's wife, or something of that sort, and she
happened to be wearing them."</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth coughed.</p>

<p>"There was some scandal, I believe," he said hurriedly, "but
we need not go into that question. At any rate, here are the
pearls&mdash;the finest in Europe. It is a practice of mine, and
has been for years, to insist on my wife wearing the Heppleworth
pearls whenever I take her out.</p>

<p>"I am so particular about these pearls," he added
impressively, "that I make a point of counting them every night
when they go out, and every night when they come in. That also is
an old practice of mine, and one which, perhaps, may seem odd to
you, if you did not know that I am a very careful man. Her
Ladyship will tell you that I am most particular, and that I have
even checked the laundry, both coming and going."</p>

<p>"And it needs checking," said Bob grimly.</p>

<p>"Very well," said his Lordship. "Last night we dined as usual
in the restaurant of the Magnificent Hotel. I counted the pearls,
and there were sixty-three, as I have counted them night after
night&mdash;a fact that my wife will confirm."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll confirm it," said the girl, and Bob was a
little startled at the undercurrent of hostility in her tone.</p>

<p>"I counted sixty-three," said his Lordship impressively. "We
went to the restaurant and, except that my wife went to the
retiring-room to take off her cloak and her furs, she was never
out of my sight a second. We dined, taking an hour and a half
over the meal, and during that period nobody approached her
Ladyship except the waiter. Naturally, I am proud of my pearls,
and I scarcely took my eyes off them during the meal. My wife
went into the retiring-room, put on her cloak and furs, and
returned with me in the car to the house. She took off the pearls
in my presence, and I placed them in this very case; but before
doing so I counted them, and there were only sixty-two."</p>

<p>He looked at Bob.</p>

<p>"Only sixty-two," repeated Bob. "You counted them again, of
course, and you have counted them since."</p>

<p>"I have counted them a dozen times since, and there can be no
mistake. Every pearl in that rope is familiar to me, and the
pearl which is missing is one of the largest."</p>

<p>Bob picked up the rope and examined it carefully.</p>

<p>"There seems to be no sign of a break here," he said; "if a
pearl has been taken off it is the work of an expert. At what do
you value the missing pearl?"</p>

<p>"Between £700 and £1,000," said his Lordship promptly. "It was
one of the best."</p>

<p>"Is there a possibility of it having fallen off in the car
coming back?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said Lord Heppleworth with asperity. "What a
ridiculous question to ask! You've seen the string."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob slowly; "I've seen the string. I'll make a few
inquiries. Her Ladyship has no theories, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," said the girl. "I didn't
even know how many pearls there were."</p>

<p>Bob went back to the office of the Federated Assurances and
saw Douglas Campbell, the managing director.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked that anxious man.</p>

<p>"This holiday adventure of mine is rather a curious business,"
said Bob. "I suppose old Lord Thingumyjig is as honest as the
day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's honest all right," replied Campbell. "Just tell me
exactly what is amiss."</p>

<p>Bob described the loss and the circumstances which preceded
it, and Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"He is perfectly right. There were sixty-three pearls insured,
and if there are now only sixty-two we are liable for the other
one. Did you count them?"</p>

<p>"I took that trouble before I left," said Bob; "and the old
man counted as well."</p>

<p>"What do you think of him?"</p>

<p>"A mean old devil," said Bob irreverently. "I should imagine
that his unhappy wife would be glad of the loss of the pearl if
it's only for the sake of the excitement."</p>

<p>"He's all that," said Campbell. "As I say, I know him well.
He's the sort of man who allows his servants so many ounces of
bread a day, and wants to have all the bones accounted for. He
has plenty of money, but doesn't know how to spend it."</p>

<p>Bob pursued his inquiries in unexpected quarters, and on the
second day he returned with a whole lot of information.</p>

<p>"I can find out nothing about Lord Heppleworth," he said,
"except that, by common consent, he is an unmitigated bore,
painfully mean and frantically pedantic. Lady Heppleworth was in
real life Gladys Surpet&mdash;that wasn't her stage name, but It
was the name she acquired through the accident of birth. She has
no mother or father living, but has one sister and one brother.
The sister has been in a lot of trouble, and was associated in
the Manchester bank fraud. The case was never brought home to
her, but there's no doubt that she was the woman who passed the
drafts on the bank at Carlisle. The brother has not been as
fortunate. He was convicted of larceny two years before the war,
and served twelve months in His Majesty's prison."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?" asked Campbell; "do you think the
brother is in it?"</p>

<p>"I am certain he is not in it. As a matter of fact, he is in
Australia. The last heard of him was that he was poor but honest.
The sister, on the other hand, is still in the black books of the
regular police. And what makes the case look rather queer against
her is that she is known to be an expert jeweller. Old man Surpet
was a working jeweller in a small way of business, and all the
children except Gladys apparently worked in the shop."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain the loss of the pearl," said
Campbell.</p>

<p>"It may help," replied Bob; "at any rate, I am going to renew
my acquaintance with the family, his Lordship having condescended
to invite me to dinner. I may learn something fresh."</p>

<p>He was at the house to time, and found Lady Heppleworth
waiting for him in the drawing-room. She was dressed for dinner,
but he noticed that she was not wearing her pearls. She followed
his glance and smiled.</p>

<p>"You're looking for the pearls?" she said. "Lord Heppleworth
does not invest me with them until we leave the house&mdash;Lord
Heppleworth is rather careful, you know," she said
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I have noticed that," said Bob. Further conversation was
interrupted by the arrival of Lord Heppleworth carrying in his
hand the familiar leather case. This he opened and lifted out the
pearls.</p>

<p>"Sixty-two, my dear," he said with heavy jocularity. "I don't
think you'll lose any to-night, with Mr. Brewer's eye on
you."</p>

<p>She smiled faintly and picked up her cloak from the chair.</p>

<p>"The car is at the door," she said, and led the way out.</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth was by no means an engaging companion. There
were two subjects on which he could speak at length, but without
any great point. One was the habits of the Mason bee, the other
was the high cost of living and the extravagance of servants in
relation thereto. They arrived at the Hotel Magnificent and
waited a few seconds whilst Lady Heppleworth divested herself of
her cloak in the ladies' room, and his lordship led the way to
the table which, it was his boast, he had occupied every night
for the past eighteen seasons.</p>

<p>The dinner was no greater intellectual treat to Bob than the
drive to the hotel had been. Lord Heppleworth was voluble but
uninteresting; Lady Heppleworth was for the most part silent; and
Bob found himself wondering what she was thinking about as she
sat there staring ahead of her, her fingers idly playing with the
pearls about her neck.</p>

<p>"I want you to wait and come back with us," said his Lordship,
when at long last the dinner ended. "I have one or two theories
which I worked up this morning, and have written down for your
examination."</p>

<p>"I have one or two theories myself," smiled Bob, "but I shan't
write them down for your Lordship. Perhaps if you sent your notes
on to me I would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would rather explain them to you," said Lord
Heppleworth.</p>

<p>Bob groaned inwardly, and entered the motor-car, bracing
himself for another two hours of boredom. He was spared that
ordeal, however. When they reached the drawing-room Lord
Heppleworth put out his hand, and obediently his wife removed the
necklace and gave it to her husband. Carefully he counted pearl
by pearl, and suddenly gasped.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he said, and counted again.</p>

<p>"There are only sixty here&mdash;two have gone!"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence as Bob took the rope from Lord
Heppleworth's hand. He had spoken the truth; there were only
sixty pearls left.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" stammered his Lordship, "how could it
have happened? It is incredible!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you did not make a mistake in the counting?"
asked his wife mildly.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like a fool," blurted his Lordship. "Didn't this
detective fellow count them, too? Now, what is your theory,
Brewer?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My theory is a very simple one," said Bob, "namely, that
those two pearls have been taken from the rope by some person or
persons unknown."</p>

<p>"That is a very clever piece of reasoning," sneered
Heppleworth. "Can't you do better than that?"</p>

<p>"Not till to-morrow," said Bob. "I will call on you at ten
o'clock, and with your permission I will take the pearls to an
expert and ask him a few questions."</p>

<p>"I will accompany you," said his Lordship. "That is quite
unnecessary," said Bob. "You can trust the pearls with me, since
we are guaranteeing their value."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he called, and carried the pearls to the best
jeweller in London.</p>

<p>"I want you to see these and tell me if there are any joins in
the string, and if it is possible that two pearls could be
detached from the centre without disturbing the others."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary to unstring them," said the jeweller. "I
can tell you straight away that it is quite possible to detach
two pearls from the centre, if the person who took them had
sufficient time."</p>

<p>"Suppose you wanted to remove two pearls from the centre,"
said Bob, "what would you have to do? I mean to leave the rope
apparently untouched."</p>

<p>"I should have to unstring the pearls one by one, take out the
selected, shorten the string by a corresponding amount, which
means refitting the string to the clasp&mdash;rather a lengthy
business."</p>

<p>"How long would it take you to do?" persisted Bob.</p>

<p>"If I worked hard at it I should probably do it in an hour,"
said the jeweller. "Would it be possible to do it in a few
minutes or a few seconds?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely impossible."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"Suppose, for example, that the lady who was wearing them
wished for any reason to detach a pearl or two, could she do it,
if she were an expert, during the time it takes a lady to put her
hair straight and hang up her cloak?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the' jeweller. "There's nobody in this
world who could fix that job under an hour, and I'm speaking as a
man who has had years of experience."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Bob.</p>

<p>He put the pearls in their case and returned them to Lord
Heppleworth.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I have a theory," he said, "and if you will be kind
enough to allow me to take Lady Heppleworth to dinner to-night
without you, I think I can guarantee a discovery."</p>

<p>Lord Heppleworth pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"It is not my practice, sir," he said, a little stiffly, "to
allow my wife to go to dinner with a stranger."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know anything about your practices, good,
bad, or indifferent," said Bob wearily. "I only know that if you
wish your pearls returned, and you do not want to incur further
losses, you would be well advised if you do what I ask."</p>

<p>"It's a lot of money," said his Lordship, "but, of course, the
insurance company will pay."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said Bob. "Certainly, unless you
agree to my wishes, I shall throw up the case."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lord Heppleworth after a while; "I will
inform my wife."</p>

<p>"She must be wearing her pearls, remember."</p>

<p>His Lordship nodded.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock Bob presented himself and the pearls were
produced with the same ritual which had been observed on the
previous night.</p>

<p>"Sixty," counted Lord Heppleworth. "Now, check them yourself,
Mr. Brewer." Bob checked them, and found that there were sixty..
He made no explanation to her Ladyship until they were in the
car.</p>

<p>"I don't understand all this," she said, a little petulantly;
"why do you want me to go to dinner? Is there anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," said Bob, "but I am under the impression
that you're as anxious to clear up this mystery as anybody."</p>

<p>"Of course I am," she said sharply. "Why should you think
otherwise?"</p>

<p>He waited for her a few seconds while she deposited her cloak,
and then followed her to Lord Heppleworth's table. No more was
said about the object of the somewhat chilly dinner party until
they had reached the coffee stage. Then suddenly Bob asked: "Lady
Heppleworth, you are not particularly happy with your husband,
are you?"</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment, and went red.</p>

<p>"I don't see what business that is of yours," she said
defiantly; "and I don't think Lord Heppleworth would like to know
that you asked that question."</p>

<p>"You can tell him, if you like," said Bob carelessly. "I am
not interested for the moment in what he thinks of me. I am very
much interested in what he will think of you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Let me ask you again," said Bob, "are you particularly happy
with your husband? Do you, for example, harbour any idea of
running away from him and retiring to some quiet, little country
town in Australia, and living your life free from the irritating
atmosphere in which you now move?"</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes. "I don't know what you mean," she said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Let me put it plainly. You have a brother in Australia and
you are anxious to get there. Lord Heppleworth allows you just
about enough money as would pay an ordinary woman's car fares. He
is, not to put too fine a point on it, extraordinarily mean. And
you, who were expecting a very brilliant life as a Peeress of the
realm, find yourself very much in the position of a servant who
hasn't even a Sunday out."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's God's truth," she blazed. "He watches me like a
cat. Why, a year ago, when my brother was starting in Australia,
I couldn't raise £50. Think of that!"</p>

<p>"You could have pawned a ring," suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"He counts the rings every morning and every night," she said,
struggling to suppress the laugh which her sense of humour
provoked. "Isn't he silly? Sometimes I feel I'll cut his throat
and run away. I would, too," she said, "if it wasn't for the fact
that there's nowhere to run to, and there's no money to run
with."</p>

<p>"And now as to the necklace," said Bob, looking at the
glittering white line about her neck. "Will you let me see
it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Why do you want it?" she said.</p>

<p>"I want to put it in my pocket," he said.</p>

<p>Her hand went to her throat.</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," she cried.</p>

<p>"Now, do me a favour," said Bob. "You have a sister, I
understand?"</p>

<p>Her face went very white.</p>

<p>"At the present moment she is acting as cloak-room attendant
at this hotel. When I say 'at this present moment' I am perhaps
wrong," he corrected. "She is more likely to be engaged in taking
a pearl from the rope you slipped off when you went to hang your
cloak, and neatly doctoring the string so that it cannot be
detected. You can do a great deal in the way of stringing pearls
in an hour. You usually sit here for an hour and a half, don't
you?"</p>

<p>She was white as death, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>"The rope you have about your neck." said Bob, "is a rope of
imitation pearls which match yours as near as possible. They were
purchased in the Burlington Arcade two months ago by a woman
answering to the description of your sister. The modus operandi,
as I understand it, is simple. You come in, with your husband,
you take off your coat, slip off the string of pearls and receive
instead the imitation string. With these, you sit at dinner what
time your sister is engaged in pinching whatsoever her hand
findeth to pinch. When you go out you exchange the imitation for
the real, and on arriving home it is discovered, to the
consternation and horror of your ungenerous husband, that you are
one or two pearls short&mdash;correct me if I'm wrong."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I suggest you go to your sister, and ask her to restore the
pearls she has taken, and to give her time to do so we will go to
a theatre, for which I have already booked seats."</p>

<p>"What shall I tell my husband?"</p>

<p>"Tell him nothing," said Bob.</p>

<p>"I wanted the money&mdash;I wanted it badly," she burst forth.
"I don't want to steal. Though Fanny is wrong, I have never done
a dishonest thing in my life. We were going to share the money. I
was going to use my share to get to Australia&mdash;out of this
stifling, horrible place."</p>

<p>Bob thought for a while.</p>

<p>"I think that I can get £200 from your husband as a reward for
the recovery of the pearls," he said. "You can take that £200 and
leave just as soon as you like."</p>

<p>"But what am I to tell my husband?"</p>

<p>"Tell him it was pinched by a Mason bee," said Bob
flippantly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="story6">VI. &mdash; "PINKY" AND THE BANK MANAGER</a></h2>

<h3>Variant title: "The Big Four and the Bank," used in <i>Argosy</i>, 5 Feb 1921</h3>

<p class="first">BOB BREWER was eating his solitary dinner in the
Windsor Restaurant, when to him came his employer and manager,
Mr. Douglas Campbell.</p>

<p>"Bob," said he without preliminary, "I've been round  to your
flat, and heard you were here&mdash;the fact is, I want your
advice."</p>

<p>"My advice," said Bob, with a magnificent wave of his hand,
"is marry the girl!"</p>

<p>The outraged Mr. Campbell spluttered his indignation.</p>

<p>"Why is it," he asked severely, "that you always introduce a
ribald strain into the most serious business conversation? I've
thought very often that maybe it is your mixing with society that
brings you into this state of mind. There's something about
society which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's nothing about society that you haven't already
described," interrupted Bob hastily, "and may I remark, on the
spur of the moment, that I have had a good dinner, and I do not
wish my digestion to be disturbed by long dissertations upon the
sins and follies of the upper classes. Leave them alone,
Campbell; they have their troubles. Now, what is yours?"</p>

<p>"You were telling me a little while back that there were a
great number of criminals in town."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"In fact, I think you mentioned the Big Four."</p>

<p>"The Big Three," corrected Bob. "Poor Bill Hoy is spending the
season at his winter palace on Dartmoor. But I have observed that
the other three are hanging loose. For example, I saw
Reddy&mdash;you've heard of Reddy? He was in this restaurant
about an hour ago. And with him was a young lady known to the
profession as Pink Mirando."</p>

<p>"A queer name," said Mr. Campbell, and asked thoughtfully,
"her complexion, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Complexion nothing," said Bob brutally; "she is called 'Pink'
because she has a penchant for pink garments. I remember
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mr. Campbell hastily, "it is not about her
or any of the gang that I want to speak. It is about the London,
Devon and Cornwall Bank."</p>

<p>Bob produced his case of cigars and handed it across the
table. Mr. Campbell chose the best and lit it before he disclosed
his story.</p>

<p>"I had a visit to-day from M'Kay, the manager of the London,
Devon and Cornwall Bank," he said; "he is an old friend of mine;
we were born in the same town."</p>

<p>"That doesn't make you a friend of his," said Bob. "I suppose
the truth of it is, you both got rich in the same swindle. Well,
what about it?"</p>

<p>"He's worried is poor M'Kay, desperately worried," Campbell
shook his head. "About six months ago one of his branch managers
was found to be betting heavily, and was in debt to a bookmaker.
M'Kay ordered an immediate audit and an examination of all
accounts. Timmes refunded a large overdraft which he had granted
to himself, resigned on the spot, forfeiting his pension and
other emoluments, and left the bank employ."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"I suppose the suggestion is that this man Timmes managed to
get the money to refund his account from some disreputable
acquaintance on the strength of services to be rendered."</p>

<p>Campbell beamed on him.</p>

<p>"Bob, there are moments when you have intelligence," he said
admiringly.</p>

<p>"Go on," commanded Bob, ignoring the flattery. "I've got an
idea that there's some dirty work for me at the end of this yarn
of yours, Campbell."</p>

<p>"That you'll discover," said Campbell. "As I say, the man
disappeared, but he carried away a great deal of information
about the bank, its business and its methods."</p>

<p>"But branch managers haven't very much information that would
be useful to an outsider," said Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," he said, "Timmes, before being appointed to
the branch, had a very confidential position at headquarters. Now
at the headquarters of the bank is a little 'Who's Who' of all
their subordinate officials. The character, the strength, the
weakness of every branch manager, together with confidential
notes on his capacity, are inscribed in a ledger to which Timmes
had access. It was intended that he should be maintained at the
head office, in a responsible position, for, ordinarily, access
to this book is never given to a man who himself is likely to
become a branch manager."</p>

<p>"I see," said Bob; "but he hasn't got the book?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "but Timmes is a man of remarkable memory. They
say that he is one of those freaks who can read a column in the
newspaper twice and repeat it almost word for word. From what he
knows of him now, M'Kay is certain that Timmes has not trusted to
his memory all these years, but must have written his impressions
from the book after he had read it through."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" said Bob.</p>

<p>"Because he approached the branch managers, who were written
in the book as being "generous" or "unworldly," asking their
assistance to help him out of a mess. M'Kay is worried, and very
naturally. He thinks that a raid is being planned upon the bank,
and he and his directors have fallen into such a panic that they
held a board meeting yesterday at which it was decided to get
into communication with me."</p>

<p>Bob raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me the bank's going to insure
themselves against loss?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea," nodded Campbell. "You see, it will take
them the greater part of three months to close certain gaps
through which the trickster and the fraud might be able to crawl!
They want us to cover their risk in that three months, and I have
seen the Federated Directors, and we have agreed to issue the
policy, and the bank has agreed to pay all expenses you may incur
whilst you are covering this policy."</p>

<p>"Poor bank!" said Bob ominously. "It may be cheaper for them
in the end to be robbed."</p>

<p>Bob Brewer made all his plans on the spur of the moment, and
had perfectly decided his line of action before he rose from the
table.</p>

<p>M'Kay, a little man with a bald head and twinkling eye, gave
him a great deal of information, much of which was wholly
useless.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll come right down to brass tacks, Mr. M'Kay," said
Bob. "We will take it for granted that your dear Mr. Timmes is in
the hands of a gang of rogues. I will also take it for granted
that that gang is out to fleece you. The third point, which is
beyond dispute, is that Timmes has supplied the gang with a great
deal of useful information. Now, the only question we have to
deal with is, on which of your branches will the blow fall? You
have, I see, a hundred and eighty branches."</p>

<p>Mr. M'Kay nodded.</p>

<p>"But don't you think," hopefully, "that they will make their
attempt on the principal office of the bank? You see, Timmes
knows more about the principal office than he knows about any of
the branches."</p>

<p>Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is extremely unlikely," said he. "You don't imagine for
one moment that they're going to try any hanky-panky here, where
you're sitting in your office within call, with all the details
of the business at your finger-tips ready to confirm or refute
any documents they may put in? Oh, no; you do the Big Four a
great injustice, Mr. M'Kay."</p>

<p>"But what branch will they select?" asked M'Kay with a wail.
"I can't protect the whole hundred and eighty!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," said Bob, nodding. "At least, I can. But,
first of all, I must see this confidential ledger of yours, which
will give me, at any rate, a clue to their intentions."</p>

<p>It took the greater part of a day, and the decision of a Board
of Directors to get a glimpse of the leather-bound volume in
which was inscribed the virtues and idiosyncrasies of branch
managers and accountants. Bob was locked in a room with this
precious volume, and at first M'Kay insisted that no notes or
extracts from the book should be taken. But Bob dealt with this
restriction in his usual cavalier fashion.</p>

<p>It was a curious volume, and in many ways interesting. Bob
read how one manager was inclined to spiritualism, and of another
"Has a brother who has spent two years in an Inebriates' Home,"
and yet another "had a weakness for whippet racing," but mainly
the entries were as eloquent to the virtues of the London, Devon
and Cornwall Branch Managers as is the average tombstone to the
average citizen.</p>

<p>Bob, plodding earnestly through these lists, came to the 68th
entry.</p> <br>

<p class="quote">"George Bowley, Branch Manager, Merstham
Bassett. Reliable man, interested in Y.M.C.A., but gave up
connection. Single, has been engaged three times, susceptible to
feminine charms. Inclined to be flirtatious. Drinks moderately,
good accountant. Suitable for large farming area, or small town
with no great social attractions."</p> <br>

<p>Bob made a brief note. He toiled through the remaining
entries, discovered one or two suspicious qualities, but it was
on Mr. George Bowley "susceptible to feminine charms," that he
stopped.</p>

<p>He interviewed M'Kay again, and after mentioning two or three
branches, he very casually referred to Merstham Basset.</p>

<p>"What sort of business do you do at Merstham Bassett?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"A big and important business," said M'Kay. "It is a farming
centre, and all the farmers have large accounts. There is also a
branch account for the Duchy of Cornwall which gives it a certain
social importance. You are thinking of Bowley?" he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of him," admitted Bob. "What sort of man is
he?"</p>

<p>"A very good lad, indeed," said M'Kay; "the only fault with
him is that he is inclined to flirting. He was in London the
other day with his latest fiancée.</p>

<p>"This time I hope that boy is going to get married," M'Kay
continued. "I think there is a chance. I like my branch managers
to be married. Marriage anchors them down and steadies them, and
certainly if he is not satisfied with this young lady, he will
never be."</p>

<p>"Pretty?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Pretty as a picture," said M'Kay, with rare enthusiasm. "And
she was jolly well dressed. She was at the age when pink becomes
a woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pink?" said Bob.</p>

<p>"A sort of pink," said M'Kay.</p>

<p>"And beautifully manicured nails," said Bob.</p>

<p>M'Kay looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, since you mention the fact, I remember she did have
beautifully manicured nails. Are you going?" for Bob had
risen.</p>

<p>"I am going," said Bob gaily. "It is me for the open-air life
and joys and delights of Devonshire cream. I am bound for
Merstham Bassett to meet your susceptible manager."</p>

<p>He left Paddington by the midnight sleeper, reached Newton
Abbot in the grey dawn and, entering the car that he had ordered
to meet him, drove to Merstham Bassett. It was a drive which took
him across the wind-swept moor and down into the folds of the
hills which sheltered the little town. He took breakfast at an
inn, and found the landlord communicative, as most landlords
are.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Bob, "have you any other strangers staying
here?"</p>

<p>The landlord nodded. "We have two gentleman who have come down
for the fishing and, of course, several people have taken houses
and cottages in the neighbourhood." He enumerated them all, and
came at length to the name of Miss Kilroy.</p>

<p>"Miss Kilroy," repeated Bob. "Is she a visitor? I seem to know
the name."</p>

<p>"She is the young lady Mr. Bowley is engaged to. He is our
manager at the bank here," explained the landlord. "Quite a
romance so far as I can understand. They met at Torquay about
three months ago. Her father was a banker in Australia, so Mr.
Bowley will be getting somebody who knows the business," he added
humorously.</p>

<p>After breakfast he strolled into the village, not unconscious
of the fact that he was being watched.</p>

<p>The little town consisted of one large and two subsidiary
streets. In the main thoroughfare were the principal shops, and
in a corner lot in the very centre were the premises of the
London, Devon and Cornwall Bank. Into this he turned, showed his
card to the manager, and passed through to that worthy's private
office.</p>

<p>"I have a card of introduction from your general manager,
which you had better see. It is a general introduction to all
your branches," said Bob, and showed his credentials.</p>

<p>The manager, a good-looking young man, scrutinized it and
nodded.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, Mr. Brewer?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, I want to know if you live on the bank
premises?"</p>

<p>"I live up above," said the manager with a smile. "I am a
bachelor&mdash;for the moment&mdash;and have very good
quarters."</p>

<p>"Where do you feed?" asked Bob to the other's surprise.</p>

<p>"As a rule, I have my dinner at the George, over the road,"
said the manager, "but three nights a week my supper is sent into
my room on a tray. There's a side entrance to the bank, as you
probably noticed."</p>

<p>Bob scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There is another question I would like to ask you. You have
supper here three nights a week. Where are you the other four
nights?"</p>

<p>The manager stiffened.</p>

<p>"I have a friend in town," he said rather shortly. "I presume
the bank does not want to know what I do in my spare time?"</p>

<p>"Only to this extent," said Bob, "that I suppose in your
absence from the bank premises there is somebody here?"</p>

<p>"That is so," nodded the manager. "My accountant remains on
duty when I am out. There is always somebody on the
premises."</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Bob. "Now one final question: Do you ever
have guests here in your room?"</p>

<p>The manager hesitated.</p>

<p>"I have not as yet," he said with a show of irritation. "Of
course, if I ask anybody in to have a cup of coffee it is
nobody's business but mine."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Bob. "And remember that this conversation is
nobody's business but yours and mine. I say this in parting,
because I do not want you to say a word to any person, however
dear they may be to you," he particularly emphasized the "dear."
"And perhaps you will tell me whether you have fixed a little
coffee party?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth," said the manager, "I have. My
fiancée and her aunt are coming in to coffee to-morrow evening. I
always feel after market day that I want some sort of relaxation.
It is quite a sight here. By the way," he added, "you are
staying, of course?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm going back to town to-night," he said.</p>

<p>"It is a pity. I should like you to have met my&mdash;a friend
of mine."</p>

<p>"I'll meet her later," said Bob, "if I have any luck."</p>

<p>"By the way, you haven't anything unusual happening to-morrow,
besides market day?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>The manager looked at him with a smile. "You have heard
rumours, eh?" he said. "Yes; a big American syndicate is buying
up a lot of farms in the neighbourhood, and I believe their agent
is coming down tomorrow to make offers to the principal farmers.
At any rate, they are depositing about £60,000 in
cash&mdash;rather a large amount for me," he said, "although
there are market days when I have had as much as £30,000 in my
little vault."</p>

<p>"Why cash?" asked Bob, curiously.</p>

<p>"The farmers here wouldn't take cheques from strangers, you
know," explained Mr. Bowley.</p>

<p>"I see," said Bob.</p>

<p>The next morning the streets of Merstham Bassett were crowded
with farmers' carts and cars, and a brisk trade was driven. But
the principal topic of conversation was undoubtedly the story of
this mysterious American syndicate and its agent.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, and no agent appeared, there were some who
thought the whole thing was a hoax, but this suggestion was
negatived by others who had interviewed the bank manager.
Nevertheless, it was a fact that the agent did not put in his
appearance, and the day closed without event.</p>

<p>It was a weary Mr. Bowley who finally dismissed his clerks and
went up to his snug sanctum and made preparation to receive his
after-supper visitors. That supper, brought in by the old waiter
of the George, was disposed of, the dishes taken away (Mr. Bowley
following the waiter down the stairs to lock the door behind him,
for he was a very careful man), the coffee tray got out, and laid
upon a snowy cloth, and the final touches given to his apartment
before the bell rang.</p>

<p>Bowley hurried down the stairs, opened the door to the two
women, and, locking the portal behind him, he led them upstairs
to his room.</p>

<p>The girl was something more than pretty. The woman who was
with her was as plain, as hard, and as middle-aged as a duenna
should be.</p>

<p>"What a delightful room," said the girl. She was wearing
pink&mdash;and a most becoming shade of pink. "Will all this
furniture be ours, George?"</p>

<p>"Every bit of it," he replied. "But, of course, we won't live
here. I have practically taken a house on the edge of the town,
and am handing these quarters over to my accountant."</p>

<p>"How delicious," said she, ecstatically. "Shall I make the
coffee?"</p>

<p>"I'll make it," said George. "I'll show you how coffee should
be made."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he placed three steaming cups on the
table, and then it was that the elder woman spoke for the first
time.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "look at your boot; it is untied."</p>

<p>The girl thrust out her foot with an exclamation of dismay;
the laces were certainly dragging. "Have I come all the way like
this?" she asked, and stooped.</p>

<p>"Let me," said the obliging Mr. Bowley. He knelt on the floor.
He was in such a position that his back was to the table, and the
hard-faced chaperon found her task an easy one. The phial of
butyl chloride which she had carried in her muff was
expeditiously tilted into the coffee cup nearest Mr. Bowley's
chair.</p>

<p>"That's done," said the young manager and straightened himself
out. "Now you shall try my coffee."</p>

<p>The two women took their cups.</p>

<p>"Delicious," said the girl, sipping daintily. Mr. Bowley
smiled, not without pride. He did not sip; he drank the contents
of his cup at a gulp.</p>

<p>"Not so good as&mdash;"</p>

<p>So far he got when the cup dropped from his hand and he fell
backwards carrying the chair with him.</p>

<p>The girl rose swiftly, walked to the window, lifted the
darkened blind a little, and dropped it again.</p>

<p>"Go down and let the boys in," she said very briskly; "I'll
stay with this guy." The two men who had "come down for the
fishing" had left the comfort of the inn, and were waiting on the
step when the older woman swung the heavy door open.</p>

<p>It was Cris Wall himself, that redoubtable leader of
criminals, who came up the stairs and glanced approvingly at the
girl's handiwork.</p>

<p>She had just searched the unconscious manager, and had
extracted the two keys from his waistcoat. "That is the key of
the safe," she said, "and that's the office door. Get busy, Cris;
has the car arrived?"</p>

<p>"It's at the end of the street," said Wall, taking the keys.
"You won't want your apparatus, Buck," he turned to the second
man, who was carrying a small bag; and Buck grunted.</p>

<p>They went out of the room, and the girl sat in an easy chair
in view of the figure on the floor, took out a cigarette from a
gold case, lit it, and puffed thoughtfully. They were a long time
opening the door of the safe; she had thought that it would be
such a simple matter. Then the door opened.</p>

<p>She did not glance round but threw her cigarette into the
fire-place and rose.</p>

<p>"Finished?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Quite finished."</p>

<p>She swung round, her mouth an "O" of surprise, and faced the
smiling eyes of Bob Brewer.</p>

<p>"Quite finished, Pinky," said the cheerful Bob. "We've been
sitting in the cellar waiting for brother Wall."</p>

<p>He glanced down at the figure on the floor and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I'd like to have saved you that, my son," he said, "but if
you will philander with criminal females, you've got to take
what's coming to you&mdash;ah, would you!" He sprung at the girl,
wrested the little revolver from her hand and flung her
breathless against the wall.</p>

<p>"Pinky," he said, "you ought to be down on your knees praying
that your 'knockout drop' does not kill our young friend here.
They hang women for this, Pinky. Did you know that?"</p>

<p>For answer, she made a dive for the door and he heard her
flying feet patter down the stairs, and laughed, for not only was
the office below filled with police, but a cordon of the
Devonshire Constabulary entirely surrounded the house.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"The American Syndicate is the Big Four who paid
money into the bank only to steal it again," he explained to
Campbell. "Legally, the money which is with the Devon and
Cornwall Bank can be drawn out at any moment, but there are about
six Scotland Yard men at Merstham Bassett waiting to pinch the
fellow who presents a cheque for it."</p>

<p>"What about Bowley&mdash;will he recover?" Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"If his young heart can stand the strain of Pinky," he said,
"it can certainly stand the effect of butyl chloride."</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="story7">VII. &mdash; THE START OF THE WORLD</a></h2>

<p class="first">MR. DOUGLAS CAMPBELL, that eminent man of
affairs, looked twice at a written slip which lay on his desk,
and grunted. It was Bob Brewer's expense account, and the frugal
soul of Mr. Campbell was seared within him. It is true that the
expenses were incurred whilst Bob Brewer was engaged in saving
the Company tens of thousands of pounds, and a penny in every
pound saved would have been sufficient to cover the expenses and
provide a handsome surplus.</p>

<p>But Mr. Campbell did not look at things this way, and when Bob
Brewer went into the office he was met by sad eyes and a shaking
head.</p>

<p>"Man, Brewer, you are eating up the dividends of this
company," said Mr. Campbell soberly.</p>

<p>"By rights there shouldn't be any dividends," said Bob.
"Conducted and managed as this insurance company is conducted and
managed, it should be in the hands of the official receiver if it
weren't for me. I'll bet there isn't another company in the City
that has as many crooks as you have! What's the trouble now?"</p>

<p>"It is your expense at Monte Carlo," groaned Mr. Campbell.
"Look at it&mdash;look at it, man! Laundry, £8 10s. You were only
there a week! Couldn't you make a shirt last you three days?"</p>

<p>Bob Brewer laughed.</p>

<p>"When you talk like that," he said, "I know you have a piece
of work for me, and one which will involve the spending of a
great deal of money. You need have no fear. For this commission,
fill in a blank cheque and trust to my sense of decency."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell locked away the papers in his desk before he
replied.</p>

<p>"Lord Yarrowby&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Bob jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," in an awe-stricken voice, "that you
have had the temerity to insure the Yarrowby diamond?"</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell looked at him uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he challenged. "It is good business; we only take
the risk for a few days, between the time of its arriving at
Southampton and its presentation to the nation."</p>

<p>"A few days too long," said Bob Brewer briskly. "I was scared
all the time that you would take that risk. Why, the whole of the
Big Four are after that stone&mdash;Tommy Waters, Reddy, the Hoy
Brothers&mdash;the whole of the world&mdash;the crooked
world&mdash;is waiting for the Yarrowby diamond."</p>

<p>A great deal of space in the newspaper world had been devoted
to the Yarrowby diamond, its size, weight, and brilliance, and
its romantic discovery in the Yarrowby Mine by Lord Yarrowby
himself when, in turning over a piece of blue clay with his
walking-stick, he had discovered this incomparable gem. The story
of its presentation to the nation had been told and retold until
the Yarrowby diamond was a household word.</p>

<p>It had been cut and polished in South Africa. One of the first
great stones to be so treated, its arrival had been awaited not
only by connoisseurs&mdash;but by the general public&mdash;with
interest which, if it was not breathless, was, at any rate,
sincere.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Mr. Campbell, "I have taken the risk, and
you will go down to Southampton to-night to meet the Manderic,
which arrives to-morrow morning at day-break. Remember we are
only responsible from the moment the package crosses the gangway
until the stone arrives in the hands of the King's Minister."</p>

<p>"May I ask the amount of our risk?" said Bob politely.</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand pounds," said Mr. Campbell with
irritation. "Man, with your gloomy face, you make me nervous!
Now, off you go to Southampton. It should be no bother to you,"
he added pointedly. "Two real detectives will accompany it all
the way from South Africa."</p>

<p>But Bob was too genuinely worried to make any adequate retort.
He caught the first train for Southampton, where he learned the
diamond was being brought over in a special case in Lord
Yarrowby's own stateroom, and was guarded night and day, Lord
Yarrowby himself sleeping within reach of the safe door, whilst
there was a guard at the door of the cabin, and another in the
alley-way. In addition were the two men from Scotland Yard, who
had been specially sent over to keep a vigilant eye on the
general events.</p>

<p>The Castle boat did not put into Southampton until seven
o'clock the next morning, and one of the first of the visitors
aboard was Bob.</p>

<p>He sought out Lord Yarrowby, and he sent down his card.</p>

<p>In the eccentric nobleman's stateroom there were already
occupants. There were two men, probably the detectives, the
ship's purser, Lord Yarrowby himself, and his valet.</p>

<p>It was at the valet that Bob stared, and well he might, for
the man was stripped to his waist, and his self-conscious grin
indicated that he himself was not unconscious of his
position.</p>

<p>Lord Yarrowby, a tall, alert man, saw Bob's amazement with a
gleam of amusement in his eyes. He took the detective's card and
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was expecting you," he said. "This ill-clad person,"
he waved his hand, "is my valet, and he is in that condition
because I never allow anybody to touch the diamonds unless they
are so costumed that it is impossible for them to play monkey
tricks upon me. Look at this."</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out a red stone.</p>

<p>This he handed to Bob with a smile, and the detective looked
at it curiously. It was very light, and was evidently made of
dried clay, a sort of terracotta.</p>

<p>"What is the exact significance of this interesting souvenir?"
asked Bob as he handed it back to its lordly owner.</p>

<p>The great man only laughed.</p>

<p>"I have had three of those since the voyage started, left in
my cabin by some person or persons unknown," he said, "together
with the little slip of paper on which was inscribed the
words&mdash;'The quickness of the hand deceives the eye.' I don't
trust Louis any farther than I can see him"&mdash;he nodded at
his valet&mdash;"I don't trust anybody to be exact, and I'm
following the rule which I have established since this diamond
was cut&mdash;namely, that anybody who handles it must be so
attired that they cannot play tricks. You, I understand, are the
insurance agent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Detective," corrected Bob.</p>

<p>"Very good. Then I am going to show you the jewel of great
price."</p>

<p>There was a safe clamped to the wall of the cabin, and this
the old man opened, taking out a steel box, which he placed on
the table, at the end of which stood the valet.</p>

<p>"Louis will take it out. I don't even trust myself," laughed
his lordship, as he unlocked the box, and stood back.</p>

<p>The valet opened back the lid almost reverently, and lifted
out a mass of wadding. This he laid on the table, and Bob saw
something big and knobbly, tied in a square of blue silk, which
the Swiss deftly unknotted, revealing to the amazed eyes of those
assembled in the cabin, that most gorgeous jewel which was named,
not unreasonably, "Star of the World."</p>

<p>Bob gasped as his lordship lifted the diamond and handed it to
him.</p>

<p>"You are holding a king's fortune in your hand."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, take it back," said Bob hastily; "the
thing dazzles and fascinates me."</p>

<p>The valet had replaced the wadding in the box, and had
methodically laid on top the blue square of silk.</p>

<p>"You see that diamond? You observe it being put back in the
box? You will also see it placed in the trunk and upon the
train," said Lord Yarrowby.</p>

<p>The diamond had been passed back to Louis, and he was busy re-
tying it. From where he stood, Bob could not see his operations
very clearly, and walked along till he stood over the valet, who
had already fastened the blue silk, drew over the protecting
layer of cotton wool, dropped the lid gently and stood back with
extended arms and outstretched fingers.</p>

<p>"Turn round, Louis."</p>

<p>The man swung round, showing his back. Now Bob saw that, save
for a pair of bathing drawers, the man wras quite nude.</p>

<p>"You may think this method rather fantastic," said his
Lordship, "but I've been used to dealing with niggers who can
palm nine carat diamonds between their fingers, and what a nigger
can do a white man can do, eh, Louis?"</p>

<p>The Swiss smiled again.</p>

<p>"Oui, milor'," he said.</p>

<p>His lordship locked the box, and replaced it in the safe, and
snapped the three locks of the safe door.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," said his lordship, "I have a surprise
for you, a very pleasant surprise. I think it will prove to you,
Mr.  Brewer, as you are representing the Insurance Company. This
safe will be taken on to the guard's van, and will be guarded by
ten armed men from now onwards.  Each of these men has been
nominated by old friends of mine, commanding battalions at
present in England. They are all soldiers, all non-commissioned
officers, all men above suspicion. I made the arrangement by
wireless, and I expect the guard will be on board in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>Bob remembered having seen a miscellaneous collection of
soldiers standing on the quay, and a few minutes later he was to
meet them. They came, marching with military precision, into the
cabin, and they were all everything that Lord Yarrowby had
claimed. Hard-faced men, without a smile amongst them, who took
their responsibilities with the greatest seriousness.</p>

<p>Bob watched the transference of the safe to the train: from
its removal from the wall to its arrival on the specially
constructed shelf in the guard's van. Then he drew Lord Yarrowby
aside.</p>

<p>"I want to ask a few questions, if you don't mind answering
them?"</p>

<p>"Ask anything you like," said his genial lordship.</p>

<p>"It is mainly about Louis," said Bob, "who, unless I have been
greatly mistaken, is a paid agent of the Big Four."</p>

<p>Lord Yarrowby lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" And then quickly: "Did you see
him take out&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I saw him take nothing. The diamond is in your safe, where he
put it. I repeat that he is the agent of the Four, or one of the
members of the Four. You must know, Lord Yarrowby, that there is
in Europe four separate and distinct gangs of big men. They
generally work independently of one another, but on great
occasions they combine for mutual benefit. Whether your valet is
one of the agents of the Four in combination or of an individual
gang, I am unable to tell you. I merely assert that he has been
squared."</p>

<p>Lord Yarrowby thrust his hands in his trousers pockets and
scowled at Bob, not unpleasantly, as he hastened to explain,</p>

<p>"I am not doubting your word, only I am puzzled how you made
the discovery."</p>

<p>"I made it this morning," said Bob.</p>

<p>"You know my man?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen him before in my life," smiled the other;
"but let me show you something."</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket and took out half-a-crown and
held it up by his finger-tips, then slowly, and in full view of
his "audience," laid it on the palm of his hand and as slowly
closed his fist.</p>

<p>"Is that half-crown there?" he said.</p>

<p>"I'd like to bet on it," said Lord Yarrowby.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Bob, and opened his hand. It was empty.</p>

<p>"It is a simple trick," Bob went on; "I only did it to show
you that in my extreme youth I practised that sort of thing, and
practice not only enables you to perform these tricks, but it
also helps you to detect them in others?"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?" began his lordship.</p>

<p>"I tell you the diamond is in the safe, and you may accept my
assurance on it, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Lord Yarrowby impatiently. "My dear chap, you are
working on your imagination. Louis has been with me for five
years. His name is Heltz, a native of Rolle, in the canton of
Vaud."</p>

<p>"What do you pay him a week?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I pay him&mdash;well, a hundred a year."</p>

<p>Bob laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"A hundred a year never kept any man faithful," he said.
"Still, I am not worrying about the diamond now, for if it
disappears I know just where I can find it." Lord Yarrowby looked
at him, and a little smile creased his eyes. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>"I like the look of you," he said. "If I didn't I should say
you were a poseur. Now let us to our breakfast."</p>

<p>Bob had a cheerful journey to town, for half or more than half
his worry had disappeared. As the train was nearing London Lord
Yarrowby came along and sat in Bob's compartment.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "I am inclined to agree with you up to
this point, that I won't allow Louis within a hundred yards of
that case again."</p>

<p>"You may do as you wish about that, but I don't suppose he
will want to go near it," said Bob. "In fact, I shouldn't be
surprised if he doesn't bolt the moment he gets to London."</p>

<p>"Without the stone?" asked his lordship incredulously.</p>

<p>"Without the stone," said Bob.</p>

<p>He was thoughtful for a while, then he asked:</p>

<p>"Those little red stones that were put in your cabin, can I
have one?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; I have them in my bag. I will bring one along to
you."</p>

<p>He went through to his compartment and returned presently with
the little terracotta mass. Bob weighed it carefully in his hand,
and then, with a word of thanks, slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>He came into Douglas Campbell's office and reported his
arrival.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, what are you doing here?" demanded the agitated
man. "Don't you understand that I want you to watch that safe day
and night, and never leave it?"</p>

<p>"I am a human being in need of a certain amount of sleep,"
said Bob; "besides, the diamond is all right."</p>

<p>And to prove how right it was, he sat down and related the
story that Lord Yarrowby had told. He had hardly finished his
narrative before Mr. Campbell was bordering upon hysteria.</p>

<p>"Then they are after it, they are after it," he wailed; "for
heaven's sake go, Bob, and don't lose sight of it!"</p>

<p>"The safe is in the vaults of the Bank of England," smiled
Bob. "I doubt whether they'll admit me even on your card; anyway,
you needn't bother. On Tuesday Yarrowby is taking it to the
Colonial Office, where the diamond will be handed over with
musical accompaniment, toastings of champagne, and innumerable
shouting and speeches."</p>

<p>On the Tuesday morning Bob received a telephone message from
Lord Yarrowby, and at once the voice of his Lordship revealed
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I say, that infernal valet of mine hasn't been home all
night!"</p>

<p>"The virtuous Louis?" said Bob with much surprise.</p>

<p>"The virtuous Louis," was the reply. "He was seen at Charing
Cross Station last night."</p>

<p>"He will be in his native cantonment, yodeling amongst the
hills, to-morrow," said Bob easily; "perhaps he'll buy an hotel
with his gains."</p>

<p>"Do you think he has the stone?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he hasn't," said Bob. "Calm your mind, Lord
Yarrowby. I shouldn't be sitting here in my pyjamas discussing
society gossip and items of criminal intelligence if I thought
that the stone had gone."</p>

<p>He heard a grunt, then:</p>

<p>"The presentation is taking place at eleven o'clock. I want
you to be there."</p>

<p>"I shall be there whether you want me or not," said Bob, and
he heard a little chuckle at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>He accompanied the safe from Threadneedle Street to Whitehall,
and was one of the select few who stood near Lord Yarrowby after
his little speech. There followed a speech by the Minister about
industry and patriotism, then Lord Yarrowby, opened the safe
door, and drew forth the smaller box containing the treasure.
This he also opened, not without a certain display of
nervousness, removed the cotton-wool which covered the little
blue bundle, and, with fingers that shook somewhat, untied the
knot which the dexterous Louis had fastened.</p>

<p>And then he stepped back with a hoarse cry, for no diamond was
visible!</p>

<p>In its place was an irregular red stone, which he lifted,
gazing upon it with wide-open, unbelieving eyes.</p>

<p>"It is gone!" he cried in a strangled voice. "My God! He took
it!"</p>

<p>Bob heard a low moan near him, and looked round to catch the
eye of the pallid Mr. Campbell, who had been invited to the
ceremony.</p>

<p>Lord Yarrowby swung round upon Bob, and he was no longer the
genial person whom the detective had met in the cabin.</p>

<p>"You are responsible for this," he said. "You told me that the
diamond was there! If you thought Louis had taken it, you should
have had him arrested!"</p>

<p>One of the Ministers came forward.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that the stone has been stolen?" he
demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>Yarrowby had no words; he could only nod his head.</p>

<p>The silence which followed was almost unnerving. Lord
Yarrowby's eyes fixed Bob.</p>

<p>"What have you to say?" he asked.</p>

<p>Bob was scratching his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I can only say that when the safe left the ship, the diamond
was safe."</p>

<p>"It is a very serious matter for you," said Yarrowby,
recovering himself.</p>

<p>"The stone was insured, then?" asked a Minister.</p>

<p>"For two hundred thousand pounds," said the grim Lord
Yarrowby.</p>

<p>Campbell licked his dry lips.</p>

<p>"The money will be paid if the stone is not recovered," he
said, not without dignity. "If Mr. Brewer says the stone was in
the safe when it came ashore, I have every confidence that he
spoke the truth. We have to find out who had access to the safe
since it has been in England."</p>

<p>"Nobody," said Lord Yarrowby.</p>

<p>"In the meantime," said Bob, "I will take this."</p>

<p>He picked up the terra-cotta rock from its bed of cotton-wool,
and compared it with another stone that he had taken from his
pocket. He then accompanied Campbell down the stairs into
Whitehall.</p>

<p>No word did they speak till they reached the office.</p>

<p>"This is a mighty serious business," breathed Campbell as he
flopped in his chair.</p>

<p>"Take care of that," said Bob, and handed a red stone to the
other; "put it in the safe; I am going out to make a few
investigations. And keep calm!"</p>

<p>His investigation took him to Scotland Yard, at which building
his stay was short. He did not return to the office until three
o'clock, to find Mr. Campbell in a condition bordering on
frenzy.</p>

<p>"I have been telephoning for you all over the place, Brewer,"
he said; "where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Loafing round," said Bob easily.</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard have sent for the stone."</p>

<p>"I know," he said; "they sent a man over with a written order,
and, of course, you gave it to him; in fact, I know you did."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I?" asked Mr. Campbell.</p>

<p>"No harm was done," said Bob; "the intelligent officer who
brought that order is known in real life as Bill Hoy. He is the
biggest man of the Big Four; also the order was forged and did
not come from Scotland Yard at all."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell gasped.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," said Bob; "he was pinched as he came out of the
office&mdash;in fact, we were waiting for him to call. Ah, here
is Lord Yarrowby."</p>

<p>Yarrowby came in at that moment, and with him an official from
the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>To say "he came" in is rather inaccurate; he burst into the
room like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he asked rapidly; "is it true?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly true," said Bob; "we caught the gentleman who
worked the oracle&mdash;Mr. William Hoy, as eminent a thief as
you are likely to meet in your lifetime."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a red stone.</p>

<p>"That which Mr. Hoy called for, and which I gave into Mr.
Campbell's care, knowing that it would be called for, was one
received by his Lordship during the voyage.</p>

<p>"This," and he held the stone in his hand, "is the fellow that
Lord Yarrowby found in the jewel case."</p>

<p>Somebody brought him a glass of water, and he slowly immersed
the stone therein. Instantly the water was coloured red.</p>

<p>"You see, it is almost like clay. In fact, it is clay, and
very porous," explained Bob, and waited.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he lifted it out and laid it upon a paper
with his fingers, pushing aside the stodgy mass.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lord Yarrowby let out a yell.</p>

<p>"The diamond!" he roared.</p>

<p>"The diamond," said Bob calmly. "Simply covered with a
wrapping of clay by your clever Louis, with great dexterity, and
a piece of oil-paper laid on the cotton-wool, whilst we were
examining the diamond in the cabin. When you handed it back he
covered the diamond with a layer of damp clay. So quickly was it
done, and so rapidly did he tie it with its silk, that you did
not realize that all the time he was pinching through the silk to
mould it to the diamond shape. When it dried, as it did in a few
hours, it would resemble one of these pieces of dried clay which
were left in your cabin, with no other idea than to suggest to
you that an attempt was to be made to substitute something of
this sort for the 'Star of the World.'"</p>

<p>"But how could they hope to get hold of the stone?"</p>

<p>Bob laughed.</p>

<p>"It is easier to burgle the safe in an insurance office than a
safe in the Bank of England," he said significantly. "And,
anyway, they didn't depend on burglary, did they, Mr.
Campbell?"</p>

<p>Douglas Campbell shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"The order from Scotland Yard looked right enough," he said.
"Otherwise I wouldn't have handed over the stone."</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't hand it over," said Bob; "so why worry?"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="story8">VIII. &mdash; BOB BREWER'S BIGGEST
COUP</a></h2>

<p class="first">"YOU can say what you like of Reddy," said Joe
Crane impressively, "but you've got to hand it to him that he's
the boy with the brains."</p>

<p>Tyke Sullivan grunted. He was a big, dark-looking man, with a
short, close-cut beard, and his attitude to his smaller companion
was one of ill-disguised contempt.</p>

<p>"He hasn't got it all, Joe," he said, "and I'm telling you
straight that I wouldn't have Reddy in my gang, no, not if he
paid me a thousand dollars a week."</p>

<p>"He's not likely to," said Joe Crane, and went on, "I ain't
saying that he's the best man in the world, and I ain't saying
that I'd have him myself. My ways ain't Reddy's ways, Tyke, and I
don't run the same class of business as Reddy, or for the matter
of that, the same class, of business as you."</p>

<p>They were sitting on the front at Brighton, two apparently
innocent members the leisured classes. Past them promenaded all
Brighton, resident and visitant, for the morning was gay with
lemon sunshine and the sea had a sparkle.</p>

<p>"I like jobs where I can work four-handed and split four
ways," said Joe Crane. "Give me a big house or an hotel, or a
public reception where the wedding presents are all in view, with
a couple of Wine-fed bulls (policemen) to watch, and I'll
guarantee to get nuts to last me through the winter. You, on the
other hand, Tyke," he admitted handsomely, "are in a bigger game.
You work with a crowd of twenty, and you're all for pulling
strings."</p>

<p>"I work without risk," said the other shortly, "and that's
where you and Reddy have got me rattled."</p>

<p>"Here's Reddy&mdash;tell him yourself," interrupted Crane.</p>

<p>Reddy came up at that moment, a resplendent and cheerful
figure, dressed in the height of fashion, a grey Homburg set at a
rakish angle on his grey head, and a long cigar in his mouth.
They edged up to make room for him on the bench they
monopolized.</p>

<p>"We were just talking about you, Reddy," said Joe.</p>

<p>Reddy shot Tyke a swift and appraising glance.</p>

<p>"Cold feet, Tyke?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, something like that," admitted the other; "this policy
sleuth has got me guessing. I'm for home sweet home after that
affair in Devonshire."</p>

<p>"Is that a fact?" said Reddy. "Why, I'm seriously thinking of
leading an honest and respectable life myself."</p>

<p>"Can that stuff!" growled Tyke Sullivan.</p>

<p>"It's a fact," said Reddy, blowing out a cloud of smoke; "I'm
going in for legitimate business, and if you fellows like to take
a share in a new company I've floated, why, you can."</p>

<p>"What sort of company, Reddy?" asked Joe Crane curiously.</p>

<p>"Ship-owning company," said Reddy. "In fact, I'm starting a
line to South America. It is not in my name, but I have bought
all the shares of a corporation that owns one small, fast boat,
which can pull out fifteen knots, and is sailing from London
river on the 7th of next month with a general cargo for Buenos
Ayres."</p>

<p>"That's an idea," said Tyke Sullivan.</p>

<p>"And we sail with her, not from London," said Reddy; "oh, no,
not from London. I have also acquired one large motor-boat, which
is permanently stationed at a place called Seaford."</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" asked Sullivan. "Why not sail straight away
from London?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Reddy, "I have the game of our lives, the one
coup which is going to bust Mister Brewer to everlasting."</p>

<p>"You're beginning to interest me," said Tyke. "Anything big
appeals. Now how big is it?"</p>

<p>"It is the size of London," said the other impressively.</p>

<p>"Money in it?"</p>

<p>"A few," said Reddy. "Just a few. Say five million
dollars."</p>

<p>Sullivan drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I know you're not talking through your hat, and I'll go you
one more fling, Reddy. The idea of squaring accounts with Mr. Bob
Brewer kind of attracts me."</p>

<p>"There is a curious thing about society. I don't know whether
you've noticed it," said Mr. Douglas Campbell.</p>

<p>"I've noticed many curious things about society," said Bob
Brewer gently. "But without any trimmings just throw off your
chest what you are aiming at."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking of the Hospital Ball," said Mr.
Campbell.</p>

<p>"Everybody's thinking about the Hospital Ball," said Bob, "and
everybody's hoping that there'll be such a slump that the ten-
guinea tickets will go for a guinea on the night, but I don't
think that's very likely. Victoria Hall is certain to be crowded
with the elite, and surely it will be packed with women, if your
theory about the cupidity of the female sex has any foundation in
truth."</p>

<p>Campbell nodded.</p>

<p>"It is coming at the height of the London season," he said,
"and I happen to know that all the best people, and even some of
those who want to be amongst the best, have bought their tickets
already. It is the lucky dip which has pulled 'em."</p>

<p>Bob looked at him interestedly, but obviously without
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Lucky dip?" he repeated; "that's a new one on me."</p>

<p>"It is one of the features of the ball," explained Mr.
Campbell. "They are going to have a huge bran tub, and every lady
will have a ticket entitling her to a dip."</p>

<p>"Rather childish," was Bob's comment.</p>

<p>"Not so childish," said Mr.. Campbell; "and this is where my
theory about society comes in. As I have said before,
society&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Bob hurriedly; "get on with the bran tub. Is
there a good prize?"</p>

<p>"A pearl necklace worth five thousand pounds," said Mr.
Campbell impressively. "How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>Bob whistled.</p>

<p>"That'll get 'em there," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course," Campbell went on, "there will be other prizes
worth comparatively nothing. In fact, there's a little gift for
everybody. But the pearl necklace has been donated by an
anonymous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold hard," said Bob in alarm; "you haven't insured the
necklace of this anonymous person against its being drawn, have
you?"</p>

<p>Campbell smiled.</p>

<p>"Not much," he said; "no, thank heaven, we're not concerned in
the Hospital Ball. I'm merely referring to it to prove my
statement that the basis of modern society is cupidity and
swank."</p>

<p>"I always remember the bookmaker who used nightly to thank the
Lord for 'them little horses,'" said Bob. "If society didn't look
silly to you, you'd look silly to your directors. If they weren't
sheep they wouldn't want watchdogs."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," said the philosophical Mr.
Campbell, as he called the waiter to pay his bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Bob Brewer, Chief Detective of the Federated Assurances,
was more than relieved to discover that he had no special duties
in connection with the ball, for he was a busy man in these
days.</p>

<p>The three most powerful members of the Big Four were at large.
Moreover, they were in London, or within reach of London, and,
most unhappy fact of all, they were at large.</p>

<p>One picks up clues in the most unlikely quarters. That
evening, reading his neglected morning newspaper and coming to
the end of the real news, Bob turned to the advertisements and to
the less attractive columns. Amongst these was one
headed&mdash;"Inflated prices for ships?"&mdash;and he read down
until he came to the paragraph:</p>

<p>"...the price which was paid for the <i>Luana</i>, for
example, seems to me to be wholly unjustified. The <i>Luana</i>
is a very fast steamer, but it seems that she is not economical
to work. Her cargo space was sacrificed in construction to give
more speed. However, it is not for us to cavil at Mr. Batterby's
purchase. He is, by the way, a newcomer to the shipping
world."</p>

<p>"Batterby!" said Bob, addressing the ceiling. "That name is
familiar to me."</p>

<p>He went to his safe and took out a little book, which he
opened and laid on his desk. He glanced through the index, and
found the name of "Reddy," and turned up the page. There, written
in Bob's own hand, was the record of that notorious swindler. He
read the entry line by line until he came to the list of Reddy's
aliases.</p>

<p>"Anderson, Redwood, Coleby, Marquis de Castereaux, Newbridge,
Batterby. Harold Batterby!"</p>

<p>Reddy would not be the first criminal who had used the same
alias twice. Indeed, it is characteristic of men who adopt other
names than their own that they repeat themselves.</p>

<p>Harold Batterby!</p>

<p>"Harold" was the Christian name of the ship buyer, as he was
to discover; "a tall greyish man, with a fund of anecdotes," was
the description Bob had secured of the purchaser over the
telephone.</p>

<p>The call to the shipping office proved to be a fortunate one,
for he found a clerk on a visit from the Newcastle office, where
the transaction had been completed. This man had seen Mr. Harold
Batterby, and remembered a red scar on his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said Bob. "I think I'll take a squint at the
<i>Luana</i>."</p>

<p>The ship was lying in London Docks, a yacht-like vessel of
graceful line. She was taking in coal when Bob arrived on the
quay, having already shipped her cargo. More interesting, she was
taking in stores for a voyage, and these included a large number
of cases bearing a familiar Rheims brand. A ship's officer and a
man in a white jacket, whom Bob guessed was the purser, were
checking the goods as they were hoisted aboard.</p>

<p>"Are you taking passengers?" asked Bob of the officer.</p>

<p>The man looked round in surprise.</p>

<p>"No," he replied shortly; "this is a cargo boat."</p>

<p>"It looked rather like a fashionable passenger list," replied
Bob, "with all that champagne going on board."</p>

<p>The officer in charge said nothing.</p>

<p>"Owners travelling, maybe?" suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the laconic officer, without a word of
comment. Then, "I wish we were travelling the other way."</p>

<p>"Homewards?" said Bob, and the man nodded.</p>

<p>"I'd give anything else, except my job, to be home for another
two months. My wife's ill."</p>

<p>"When do you sail?"</p>

<p>"By to-morrow night's tide," said the officer, whose
brusqueness was evidently due to his private troubles, and not to
his resentment at inquiries into his employer's business.</p>

<p>"We are going to some South Coast port to pick up the owner,
and I tried to persuade the skipper to let me join her there. But
it's no go."</p>

<p>Bob nodded. "I have an idea that you won't go very far from
England," he said.</p>

<p>"I wish you meant it," replied the other fervently.</p>

<p>"What is the port?" asked Bob. "I mean the port where you are
picking up your owner?"</p>

<p>The officer shrugged.</p>

<p>"They are making a devil of a mystery of it, but I fancy
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Newhaven."</p>

<p>The detective made a mental note. "Have you any idea when you
pick him up?" The officer shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not for a day or two," he said. "Why are you so keen on
knowing?"</p>

<p>Bob took a chance. He liked the man's face. It was one that
could be trusted. Obviously Reddy had not warned any of the
officers, thinking he had covered his tracks too well, and that
nobody would identify him with "Batterby."</p>

<p>Bob produced his card.</p>

<p>"A detective, eh?" said the officer, interested. "Is anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"A great deal is wrong, but how much I don't know," said Bob.
"All I want you to do is to keep this little matter to yourself.
It may be you can help me, and if you can, my company will pay
you well. You need not worry about being disloyal to your owners;
because, unless I am at fault, your owners will be standing in
the dock at Old Bailey about this time next month, and maybe
you'll be detained in London to give evidence."</p>

<p>The officer smiled.</p>

<p>"That's the biggest bribe you can offer me," he said.</p>

<p>Bob told him as much as he thought was wise. He argued that it
was as well to have somebody on the ship who would act for him,
and this officer promised to fulfill all requirements.</p>

<p>"One thing I know," said the officer, when Bob had finished,
"is that we are being held up at Newhaven or somewhere on the
coast, because the owner wants to go to a ball."</p>

<p>"A ball! The Hospital Ball?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it is the Hospital Ball," replied the
other; "but I know it is a ball of some kind, and he is motoring
down to the coast immediately after." Bob began to see things
clearly. He made arrangements with the officer, drove straight
back to town, and began to pick up the thread at that end. The
secretary of the Hospital Ball was a woman who was something of
an expert in the organization of charity functions.</p>

<p>"Who is the promoter of the present festivities?" Bob asked
her,</p>

<p>"That, I am afraid, is a secret," said the organizer.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be afraid of," said the detective,
"because I happen to know that it is Mr. Harold Batterby."</p>

<p>"Well, if you knew why did you ask?" demanded the lady tartly.
But Bob, in his most ingratiating manner, assured her that he had
great influence in Fleet Street and thereupon she obligingly told
him all she knew.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed long conferences at the offices of the
Federated Assurances, conferences at which the strangest people
were represented. Not only did the Commissioner of Police send
his men, but the Admiralty was represented, and when the
<i>Luana</i> came rolling down the Channel on the morning of the
ball, two lean destroyers made their appearance from nowhere in
particular, and took a parallel course.</p>

<p>And when the <i>Luana</i> dropped anchor off Seaford two
destroyers also dropped anchor, a circumstance which puzzled the
captain of the <i>Luana</i>, but was plainly understood by her
second officer.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">There was no doubt that the ball was a
magnificent success. All approaches to Victoria Hall were blocked
with motor cars bearing that which was best, brightest and most
popular in society to the great pillared saloon, where men and
women were to dance for six hours in the cause of charity.</p>

<p>Reddy, a fine figure of a man in evening dress, was in one of
the boxes overlooking the floor, thoughtfully smoking a cigar.
His companion was Joe Crane, and Joe was incoherent with
admiration.</p>

<p>"There's class here, Joe," said Reddy, after a long silence;
"look at that woman's emeralds, they are a wonderful colour!"</p>

<p>"You're really a genius," said the enthusiastic Joe; "nobody
but you could have thought of it, Reddy. Is that the place?"</p>

<p>He pointed to a purple-curtained door.</p>

<p>Above the curtain was a neatly painted sign:&mdash;</p> <br>

<p class="sign">LUCKY DIP!<br> red tickets at 11 o'clock.</p>
<br>

<p>"Every woman has a ticket," he explained, "and before eleven
we will start queueing them up. There is a smaller hall inside
where the ladies with red tickets go."</p>

<p>"Who have the red tickets?" asked Joe, who had not been
admitted to all the secrets of the organization.</p>

<p>"The tickets," said Reddy, "were distributed at the door. The
women with the big jewels have got the red, and the others have
got the white. Do you see, Joe?"</p>

<p>Joe chuckled.</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful man, Reddy," he I said, "but where do I
come in?"</p>

<p>"You stand by the car at the side entrance and help put the
stuff aboard. Tyke Sullivan and me will attend to the women."</p>

<p>"Supposing the motor breaks down?" inquired the anxious
Joe.</p>

<p>"I've got three of them on the road in case of accidents,"
replied Reddy. "They will fall in behind us as we pass, so we'll
always have a car handy in case the first one dies. The ship is
at Seaford. I have had a wire from the captain. Young Joyce will
take the motor boat on to Portsmouth, leave it there, and make
the best of his way to South America. I don't think I have left
anything undone. Look at that one!"</p>

<p>He pointed to a tall fair woman in a high dress, about whose
neck blazed a fortune.</p>

<p>"She's a red ticket," he said with satisfaction.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eleven, amidst laughter and a babble of talk,
the ladies began to take their places in the queue, according to
their numbers on the red cards which had been given them on their
entrance to the hall.</p>

<p>The red tickets were to go at eleven, the white tickets were
to line up an hour later. The tall fair woman was in the first
batch&mdash;this Joe noticed with satisfaction before he left to
take up his post.</p>

<p>At eleven the curtains were pulled aside, the big doors
opened, and the crowd trooped in, the tickets being examined as
they passed. Then the doors were closed, the heavy curtains
pulled, and the white ticket-holders left speculating amongst
themselves as to the chances they had of securing the big
prize.</p>

<p>In the small hall a curious scene was being enacted. The eager
dippers were crowded together at one end of the brilliantly-lit
room, in the centre of which was a circular tub filled with bran.
Reddy, a self-possessed master of ceremonies, explained the
<i>modus operandi</i>, but it was one for which the ladies were
not prepared. Outside in the big ball a noisy coon band had taken
its place practically against the door, and the sound of its din
came faintly to the people in the smaller saloon.</p>

<p>"Ladies," said Reddy, "I want you to pay attention to what I'm
saying, because it is absolutely necessary that you should
understand me. My assistant is putting a sheet over the bran tub,
as you will perceive. This," he produced from his hip pocket a
long-barrelled revolver, "this, as you will also perceive, is a
gun, and it is loaded in six chambers. You will all of you walk
past that tub and deposit the jewels which you have about your
necks, your earrings, brooches and rings on that sheet. I would
explain to you that if I am captured by the police I shall go to
gaol for twenty years. I would much rather be hung for the murder
of one, or several of you.</p>

<p>"Therefore I tell you, that if any of you raise your voices or
shout or disobey me, that one I will instantly shoot. If I do not
do it, my friends here," he jerked his head to the hard-faced
girl who drew herself up by his side, and Tyke Sullivan, his back
to the door of the main hall, examining an automatic pistol,
"will do it for me. There's no use in shouting," he said as a
faint scream rose from the mass of palpitating women, "because
there's a band just outside the door which prevents your screams
being heard. I've got exactly three minutes, so hurry. You
first."</p>

<p>He glared at the tall, fair woman.</p>

<p>"On to the sheet with that necklace of yours, madam. And step
lively!"</p>

<p>The tall woman walked forward, unclasped the collar from her
neck, dropped it into the sheet, and walked round past the girl
and Reddy. Another woman followed, moaning her fear, and with
trembling hands unfastened the pearl necklace from her throat. A
third victim was on the way, when the tall, fair woman turned
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I've got the drop on you, Reddy. A flick of your eye and
you're a dead man!" Reddy dropped his revolver with a crash, and
his hands went up. Not so big Sullivan, who swung round at the
sound of the masculine voice, his gun upraised. Before he could
bring the barrel level Bob fired, three rapid shots, like the
rap-tap-tap of a drum, and big Sullivan went down to his knees,
gripping a bloody arm.</p>

<p>And then pandemonium broke loose. At the sound of the shots
the last tense nerves gave way, and the scene that followed
beggars description.</p>

<p>Half an hour later an elegantly dressed "lady," whose blonde
hair lay on the table beside her, sat smoking a pipe in the
office of the Chief Detective Commissioner of Scotland Yard.
Facing him across the table was a dazed but admiring Mr.
Campbell, the managing director of the Federated Assurances.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a big haul, Brewer," said the Commissioner, "the
biggest haul we've had for years, and though we shall get the
credit for it, of course, the credit is all yours."</p>

<p>"I suppose you pulled in every one of the gang?" demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>"Every one," nodded the officer; "they couldn't very well get
out of the cordon we put round Victoria Hall. We even got the
gentleman who was manipulating the motor boat at Seaford. This
puts the Big Four permanently out of business. Incidentally," he
turned to Campbell, "it saves your company something in the
region of half a million&mdash;there were enough jewels in that
little room to pay a moderate national debt. You had a bad time
with the women, didn't you, Brewer?"</p>

<p>Bob shuddered.</p>

<p>"Terrible," he said briefly. "They thought I was a perfect
lady, and wanted to hug me."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and glanced down at his beautiful
gown.</p>

<p>"It took two lady's maids and a valet to dress me," he
said.</p>

<p>"Bob," said Mr. Campbell, tremulous with emotion, "the company
will never be able to reward you for this night's work."</p>

<p>"Won't they?" said Bob ominously, "then it's your job to see
that they do. In the meantime, come along and help me unlace my
stays."</p>  <hr>
