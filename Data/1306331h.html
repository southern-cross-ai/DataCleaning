  <h2><a id="ch101"
     name="ch101"></a>I. &mdash; INTO THE DESERT</h2>

  <p class="first">The Jebel es Zubleh is a mountain fifty miles and more in
  length, and so narrow that its tracery on the map gives it a likeness to a
  caterpillar crawling from the south to the north. Standing on its
  red-and-white cliffs, and looking off under the path of the rising sun, one
  sees only the Desert of Arabia, where the east winds, so hateful to
  vinegrowers of Jericho, have kept their playgrounds since the beginning. Its
  feet are well covered by sands tossed from the Euphrates, there to lie, for
  the mountain is a wall to the pasture-lands of Moab and Ammon on the
  west&mdash;lands which else had been of the desert a part.</p>

  <p>The Arab has impressed his language upon everything south and east of
  Judea, so, in his tongue, the old Jebel is the parent of numberless wadies
  which, intersecting the Roman road&mdash;now a dim suggestion of what once it
  was, a dusty path for Syrian pilgrims to and from Mecca&mdash;run their
  furrows, deepening as they go, to pass the torrents of the rainy season into
  the Jordan, or their last receptacle, the Dead Sea. Out of one of these
  wadies&mdash;or, more particularly, out of that one which rises at the
  extreme end of the Jebel, and, extending east of north, becomes at length the
  bed of the Jabbok River&mdash;a traveller passed, going to the table-lands of
  the desert. To this person the attention of the reader is first besought.</p>

  <p>Judged by his appearance, he was quite forty-five years old. His beard,
  once of the deepest black, flowing broadly over his breast, was streaked with
  white. His face was brown as a parched coffee-berry, and so hidden by a red
  kufiyeh (as the kerchief of the head is at this day called by the children of
  the desert) as to be but in part visible. Now and then he raised his eyes,
  and they were large and dark. He was clad in the flowing garments so
  universal in the East; but their style may not be described more
  particularly, for he sat under a miniature tent, and rode a great white
  dromedary.</p>

  <p>It may be doubted if the people of the West ever overcome the impression
  made upon them by the first view of a camel equipped and loaded for the
  desert. Custom, so fatal to other novelties, affects this feeling but little.
  At the end of long journeys with caravans, after years of residence with the
  Bedawin, the Western-born, wherever they may be, will stop and wait the
  passing of the stately brute. The charm is not in the figure, which not even
  love can make beautiful; nor in the movement, the noiseless stepping, or the
  broad careen. As is the kindness of the sea to a ship, so that of the desert
  to its creature. It clothes him with all its mysteries; in such manner, too,
  that while we are looking at him we are thinking of them: therein is the
  wonder. The animal which now came out of the wady might well have claimed the
  customary homage. Its color and height; its breadth of foot; its bulk of
  body, not fat, but overlaid with muscle; its long, slender neck, of swanlike
  curvature; the head, wide between the eyes, and tapering to a muzzle which a
  lady's bracelet might have almost clasped; its motion, step long and elastic,
  tread sure and soundless&mdash;all certified its Syrian blood, old as the
  days of Cyrus, and absolutely priceless. There was the usual bridle, covering
  the forehead with scarlet fringe, and garnishing the throat with pendent
  brazen chains, each ending with a tinkling silver bell; but to the bridle
  there was neither rein for the rider nor strap for a driver. The furniture
  perched on the back was an invention which with any other people than of the
  East would have made the inventor renowned. It consisted of two wooden boxes,
  scarce four feet in length, balanced so that one hung at each side; the inner
  space, softly lined and carpeted, was arranged to allow the master to sit or
  lie half reclined; over it all was stretched a green awning. Broad back and
  breast straps, and girths, secured with countless knots and ties, held the
  device in place. In such manner the ingenious sons of Cush had contrived to
  make comfortable the sunburnt ways of the wilderness, along which lay their
  duty as often as their pleasure.</p>

  <p>When the dromedary lifted itself out of the last break of the wady, the
  traveller had passed the boundary of El Belka, the ancient Ammon. It was
  morning-time. Before him was the sun, half curtained in fleecy mist; before
  him also spread the desert; not the realm of drifting sands, which was
  farther on, but the region where the herbage began to dwarf; where the
  surface is strewn with boulders of granite, and gray and brown stones,
  interspersed with languishing acacias and tufts of camel-grass. The oak,
  bramble, and arbutus lay behind, as if they had come to a line, looked over
  into the well-less waste and crouched with fear.</p>

  <p>And now there was an end of path or road. More than ever the camel seemed
  insensibly driven; it lengthened and quickened its pace, its head pointed
  straight towards the horizon; through the wide nostrils it drank the wind in
  great draughts. The litter swayed, and rose and fell like a boat in the
  waves. Dried leaves in occasional beds rustled underfoot. Sometimes a perfume
  like absinthe sweetened all the air. Lark and chat and rock-swallow leaped to
  wing, and white partridges ran whistling and clucking out of the way. More
  rarely a fox or a hyena quickened his gallop, to study the intruders at a
  safe distance. Off to the right rose the hills of the Jebel, the pearl-gray
  veil resting upon them changing momentarily into a purple which the sun would
  make matchless a little later. Over their highest peaks a vulture sailed on
  broad wings into widening circles. But of all these things the tenant under
  the green tent saw nothing, or, at least, made no sign of recognition. His
  eyes were fixed and dreamy. The going of the man, like that of the animal,
  was as one being led.</p>

  <p>For two hours the dromedary swung forward, keeping the trot steadily and
  the line due east. In that time the traveller never changed his position, nor
  looked to the right or left. On the desert, distance is not measured by miles
  or leagues, but by the saat, or hour, and the manzil, or halt: three and a
  half leagues fill the former, fifteen or twenty-five the latter; but they are
  the rates for the common camel. A carrier of the genuine Syrian stock can
  make three leagues easily. At full speed he overtakes the ordinary winds. As
  one of the results of the rapid advance, the face of the landscape underwent
  a change. The Jebel stretched along the western horizon, like a pale-blue
  ribbon. A tell, or hummock of clay and cemented sand, arose here and there.
  Now and then basaltic stones lifted their round crowns, outposts of the
  mountain against the forces of the plain; all else, however, was sand,
  sometimes smooth as the beaten beach, then heaped in rolling ridges; here
  chopped waves, there long swells. So, too, the condition of the atmosphere
  changed. The sun, high risen, had drunk his fill of dew and mist, and warmed
  the breeze that kissed the wanderer under the awning; far and near he was
  tinting the earth with faint milk-whiteness, and shimmering all the sky.</p>

  <p>Two hours more passed without rest or deviation from the course.
  Vegetation entirely ceased. The sand, so crusted on the surface that it broke
  into rattling flakes at every step, held undisputed sway. The Jebel was out
  of view, and there was no landmark visible. The shadow that before followed
  had now shifted to the north, and was keeping even race with the objects
  which cast it; and as there was no sign of halting, the conduct of the
  traveller became each moment more strange.</p>

  <p>No one, be it remembered, seeks the desert for a pleasure-ground. Life and
  business traverse it by paths along which the bones of things dead are strewn
  as so many blazons. Such are the roads from well to well, from pasture to
  pasture. The heart of the most veteran sheik beats quicker when he finds
  himself alone in the pathless tracts. So the man with whom we are dealing
  could not have been in search of pleasure; neither was his manner that of a
  fugitive; not once did he look behind him. In such situations fear and
  curiosity are the most common sensations; he was not moved by them. When men
  are lonely, they stoop to any companionship; the dog becomes a comrade, the
  horse a friend, and it is no shame to shower them with caresses and speeches
  of love. The camel received no such token, not a touch, not a word.</p>

  <p>Exactly at noon the dromedary, of its own will, stopped, and uttered the
  cry or moan, peculiarly piteous, by which its kind always protest against an
  overload, and sometimes crave attention and rest. The master thereupon
  bestirred himself, waking, as it were, from sleep. He threw the curtains of
  the houdah up, looked at the sun, surveyed the country on every side long and
  carefully, as if to identify an appointed place. Satisfied with the
  inspection, he drew a deep breath and nodded, much as to say, "At last, at
  last!" A moment after, he crossed his hands upon his breast, bowed his head,
  and prayed silently. The pious duty done, he prepared to dismount. From his
  throat proceeded the sound heard doubtless by the favorite camels of
  Job&mdash;Ikh! ikh!&mdash;the signal to kneel. Slowly the animal obeyed,
  grunting the while. The rider then put his foot upon the slender neck, and
  stepped upon the sand.</p>

  tall as powerful. Loosening the silken rope which held the kufiyeh on his
  head, he brushed the fringed folds back until his face was bare&mdash;a
  strong face, almost negro in color; yet the low, broad forehead, aquiline
  nose, the outer corners of the eyes turned slightly upward, the hair profuse,
  straight, harsh, of metallic lustre, and falling to the shoulder in many
  plaits, were signs of origin impossible to disguise. So looked the Pharaohs
  and the later Ptolemies; so looked Mizraim, father of the Egyptian race. He
  wore the kamis, a white cotton shirt tight-sleeved, open in front, extending
  to the ankles and embroidered down the collar and breast, over which was
  thrown a brown woollen cloak, now, as in all probability it was then, called
  the aba, an outer garment with long skirt and short sleeves, lined inside
  with stuff of mixed cotton and silk, edged all round with a margin of clouded
  yellow. His feet were protected by sandals, attached by thongs of soft
  leather. A sash held the kamis to his waist. What was very noticeable,
  considering he was alone, and that the desert was the haunt of leopards and
  lions, and men quite as wild, he carried no arms, not even the crooked stick
  used for guiding camels; wherefore we may at least infer his errand peaceful,
  and that he was either uncommonly bold or under extraordinary protection.</p>

  <p>The traveller's limbs were numb, for the ride had been long and wearisome;
  so he rubbed his hands and stamped his feet, and walked round the faithful
  servant, whose lustrous eyes were closing in calm content with the cud he had
  already found. Often, while making the circuit, he paused, and, shading his
  eyes with his hands, examined the desert to the extremest verge of vision;
  and always, when the survey was ended, his face clouded with disappointment,
  slight, but enough to advise a shrewd spectator that he was there expecting
  company, if not by appointment; at the same time, the spectator would have
  been conscious of a sharpening of the curiosity to learn what the business
  could be that required transaction in a place so far from civilized
  abode.</p>

  <p>However disappointed, there could be little doubt of the stranger's
  confidence in the coming of the expected company. In token thereof, he went
  first to the litter, and, from the cot or box opposite the one he had
  occupied in coming, produced a sponge and a small gurglet of water, with
  which he washed the eyes, face, and nostrils of the camel; that done, from
  the same depository he drew a circular cloth, red-and white-striped, a bundle
  of rods, and a stout cane. The latter, after some manipulation, proved to be
  a cunning device of lesser joints, one within another, which, when united
  together, formed a centre pole higher than his head. When the pole was
  planted, and the rods set around it, he spread the cloth over them, and was
  literally at home&mdash;a home much smaller than the habitations of emir and
  sheik, yet their counterpart in all other respects. From the litter again he
  brought a carpet or square rug, and covered the floor of the tent on the side
  from the sun. That done, he went out, and once more, and with greater care
  and more eager eyes, swept the encircling country. Except a distant jackal,
  galloping across the plain, and an eagle flying towards the Gulf of Akaba,
  the waste below, like the blue above it, was lifeless.</p>

  <p>He turned to the camel, saying low, and in a tongue strange to the desert,
  "We are far from home, O racer with the swiftest winds&mdash;we are far from
  home, but God is with us. Let us be patient."</p>

  <p>Then he took some beans from a pocket in the saddle, and put them in a bag
  made to hang below the animal's nose; and when he saw the relish with which
  the good servant took to the food, he turned and again scanned the world of
  sand, dim with the glow of the vertical sun.</p>

  <p>"They will come," he said, calmly. "He that led me is leading them. I will
  make ready."</p>

  <p>From the pouches which lined the interior of the cot, and from a willow
  basket which was part of its furniture, he brought forth materials for a
  meal: platters close-woven of the fibres of palms; wine in small gurglets of
  skin; mutton dried and smoked; stoneless shami, or Syrian pomegranates; dates
  of El Shelebi, wondrous rich and grown in the nakhil, or palm orchards, of
  Central Arabia; cheese, like David's "slices of milk;" and leavened bread
  from the city bakery&mdash;all which he carried and set upon the carpet under
  the tent. As the final preparation, about the provisions he laid three pieces
  of silk cloth, used among refined people of the East to cover the knees of
  guests while at table&mdash;a circumstance significant of the number of
  persons who were to partake of his entertainment&mdash;the number he was
  awaiting.</p>

  <p>All was now ready. He stepped out: lo! in the east a dark speck on the
  face of the desert. He stood as if rooted to the ground; his eyes dilated;
  his flesh crept chilly, as if touched by something supernatural. The speck
  grew; became large as a hand; at length assumed defined proportions. A little
  later, full into view swung a duplication of his own dromedary, tall and
  white, and bearing a houdah, the travelling litter of Hindostan. Then the
  Egyptian crossed his hands upon his breast, and looked to heaven.</p>

  <p>"God only is great!" he exclaimed, his eyes full of tears, his soul in
  awe.</p>

  <p>The stranger drew nigh&mdash;at last stopped. Then he, too, seemed just
  waking. He beheld the kneeling camel, the tent, and the man standing
  prayerfully at the door. He crossed his hands, bent his head, and prayed
  silently; after which, in a little while, he stepped from his camel's neck to
  the sand, and advanced towards the Egyptian, as did the Egyptian towards him.
  A moment they looked at each other; then they embraced&mdash;that is, each
  threw his right arm over the other's shoulder, and the left round the side,
  placing his chin first upon the left, then upon the right breast.</p>

  <p>"Peace be with thee, O servant of the true God!" the stranger said.</p>

  <p>"And to thee, O brother of the true faith!&mdash;to thee peace and
  welcome," the Egyptian replied, with fervor.</p>

  <p>The new-comer was tall and gaunt, with lean face, sunken eyes, white hair
  and beard, and a complexion between the hue of cinnamon and bronze. He, too,
  was unarmed. His costume was Hindostani; over the skull-cap a shawl was wound
  in great folds, forming a turban; his body garments were in the style of the
  Egyptian's, except that the aba was shorter, exposing wide flowing breeches
  gathered at the ankles. In place of sandals, his feet were clad in
  half-slippers of red leather, pointed at the toes. Save the slippers, the
  costume from head to foot was of white linen. The air of the man was high,
  stately, severe. Visvamitra, the greatest of the ascetic heroes of the Iliad
  of the East, had in him a perfect representative. He might have been called a
  Life drenched with the wisdom of Brahma&mdash;Devotion Incarnate. Only in his
  eyes was there proof of humanity; when he lifted his face from the Egyptian's
  breast, they were glistening with tears.</p>

  <p>"God only is great!" he exclaimed, when the embrace was finished.</p>

  <p>"And blessed are they that serve him!" the Egyptian answered, wondering at
  the paraphrase of his own exclamation. "But let us wait," he added, "let us
  wait; for see, the other comes yonder!"</p>

  <p>They looked to the north, where, already plain to view, a third camel, of
  the whiteness of the others, came careening like a ship. They waited,
  standing together&mdash;waited until the new-comer arrived, dismounted, and
  advanced towards them.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, O my brother!" he said, while embracing the Hindoo.</p>

  <p>And the Hindoo answered, "God's will be done!"</p>

  <p>The last comer was all unlike his friends: his frame was slighter; his
  complexion white; a mass of waving light hair was a perfect crown for his
  small but beautiful head; the warmth of his dark-blue eyes certified a
  delicate mind, and a cordial, brave nature. He was bareheaded and unarmed.
  Under the folds of the Tyrian blanket which he wore with unconscious grace
  appeared a tunic, short-sleeved and low-necked, gathered to the waist by a
  band, and reaching nearly to the knee; leaving the neck, arms, and legs bare.
  Sandals guarded his feet. Fifty years, probably more, had spent themselves
  upon him, with no other effect, apparently, than to tinge his demeanor with
  gravity and temper his words with forethought. The physical organization and
  the brightness of soul were untouched. No need to tell the student from what
  kindred he was sprung; if he came not himself from the groves of Athene', his
  ancestry did.</p>

  <p>When his arms fell from the Egyptian, the latter said, with a tremulous
  voice, "The Spirit brought me first; wherefore I know myself chosen to be the
  servant of my brethren. The tent is set, and the bread is ready for the
  breaking. Let me perform my office."</p>

  <p>Taking each by the hand, he led them within, and removed their sandals and
  washed their feet, and he poured water upon their hands, and dried them with
  napkins.</p>

  <p>Then, when he had laved his own hands, he said, "Let us take care of
  ourselves, brethren, as our service requires, and eat, that we may be strong
  for what remains of the day's duty. While we eat, we will each learn who the
  others are, and whence they come, and how they are called."</p>

  <p>He took them to the repast, and seated them so that they faced each other.
  Simultaneously their heads bent forward, their hands crossed upon their
  breasts, and, speaking together, they said aloud this simple grace:</p>

  <p>"Father of all&mdash;God!&mdash;what we have here is of thee; take our
  thanks and bless us, that we may continue to do thy will."</p>

  <p>With the last word they raised their eyes, and looked at each other in
  wonder. Each had spoken in a language never before heard by the others; yet
  each understood perfectly what was said. Their souls thrilled with divine
  emotion; for by the miracle they recognized the Divine Presence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch103"
     name="ch103"></a>III. &mdash; THE ATHENIAN SPEAKS&mdash;FAITH</h2>

  <p class="first">To speak in the style of the period, the meeting just
  described took place in the year of Rome 747. The month was December, and
  winter reigned over all the regions east of the Mediterranean. Such as ride
  upon the desert in this season go not far until smitten with a keen appetite.
  The company under the little tent were not exceptions to the rule. They were
  hungry, and ate heartily; and, after the wine, they talked.</p>

  <p>"To a wayfarer in a strange land nothing is so sweet as to hear his name
  on the tongue of a friend," said the Egyptian, who assumed to be president of
  the repast. "Before us lie many days of companionship. It is time we knew
  each other. So, if it be agreeable, he who came last shall be first to
  speak."</p>

  <p>Then, slowly at first, like one watchful of himself, the Greek began:</p>

  <p>"What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly know where
  to begin or what I may with propriety speak. I do not yet understand myself.
  The most I am sure of is that I am doing a Master's will, and that the
  service is a constant ecstasy. When I think of the purpose I am sent to
  fulfil, there is in me a joy so inexpressible that I know the will is
  God's."</p>

  <p>The good man paused, unable to proceed, while the others, in sympathy with
  his feelings, dropped their gaze.</p>

  <p>"Far to the west of this," he began again, "there is a land which may
  never be forgotten; if only because the world is too much its debtor, and
  because the indebtedness is for things that bring to men their purest
  pleasures. I will say nothing of the arts, nothing of philosophy, of
  eloquence, of poetry, of war: O my brethren, hers is the glory which must
  shine forever in perfected letters, by which He we go to find and proclaim
  will be made known to all the earth. The land I speak of is Greece. I am
  Gaspar, son of Cleanthes the Athenian.</p>

  <p>"My people," he continued, "were given wholly to study, and from them I
  derived the same passion. It happens that two of our philosophers, the very
  greatest of the many, teach, one the doctrine of a Soul in every man, and its
  Immortality; the other the doctrine of One God, infinitely just. From the
  multitude of subjects about which the schools were disputing, I separated
  them, as alone worth the labor of solution; for I thought there was a
  relation between God and the soul as yet unknown. On this theme the mind can
  reason to a point, a dead, impassable wall; arrived there, all that remains
  is to stand and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice came to me over
  the wall. In despair, I tore myself from the cities and the schools."</p>

  <p>At these words a grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face of the
  Hindoo.</p>

  <p>"In the northern part of my country&mdash;in Thessaly," the Greek
  proceeded to say, "there is a mountain famous as the home of the gods, where
  Theus, whom my countrymen believe supreme, has his abode; Olympus is its
  name. Thither I betook myself. I found a cave in a hill where the mountain,
  coming from the west, bends to the southeast; there I dwelt, giving myself up
  to meditation&mdash;no, I gave myself up to waiting for what every breath was
  a prayer&mdash;for revelation. Believing in God, invisible yet supreme, I
  also believed it possible so to yearn for him with all my soul that he would
  take compassion and give me answer."</p>

  <p>"And he did&mdash;he did!" exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his hands from
  the silken cloth upon his lap.</p>

  <p>"Hear me, brethren," said the Greek, calming himself with an effort. "The
  door of my hermitage looks over an arm of the sea, over the Thermaic Gulf.
  One day I saw a man flung overboard from a ship sailing by. He swam ashore. I
  received and took care of him. He was a Jew, learned in the history and laws
  of his people; and from him I came to know that the God of my prayers did
  indeed exist; and had been for ages their lawmaker, ruler, and king. What was
  that but the Revelation I dreamed of? My faith had not been fruitless; God
  answered me!"</p>

  <p>"As he does all who cry to him with such faith," said the Hindoo.</p>

  <p>"But, alas!" the Egyptian added, "how few are there wise enough to know
  when he answers them!"</p>

  <p>"That was not all," the Greek continued. "The man so sent to me told me
  more. He said the prophets who, in the ages which followed the first
  revelation, walked and talked with God, declared he would come again. He gave
  me the names of the prophets, and from the sacred books quoted their very
  language. He told me, further, that the second coming was at hand&mdash;was
  looked for momentarily in Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>The Greek paused, and the brightness of his countenance faded.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he said, after a little&mdash;"it is true the man told me
  that as God and the revelation of which he spoke had been for the Jews alone,
  so it would be again. He that was to come should be King of the Jews. 'Had he
  nothing for the rest of the world?' I asked. 'No,' was the answer, given in a
  proud voice&mdash;'No, we are his chosen people.' The answer did not crush my
  hope. Why should such a God limit his love and benefaction to one land, and,
  as it were, to one family? I set my heart upon knowing. At last I broke
  through the man's pride, and found that his fathers had been merely chosen
  servants to keep the Truth alive, that the world might at last know it and be
  saved. When the Jew was gone, and I was alone again, I chastened my soul with
  a new prayer&mdash;that I might be permitted to see the King when he was
  come, and worship him. One night I sat by the door of my cave trying to get
  nearer the mysteries of my existence, knowing which is to know God; suddenly,
  on the sea below me, or rather in the darkness that covered its face, I saw a
  star begin to burn; slowly it arose and drew nigh, and stood over the hill
  and above my door, so that its light shone full upon me. I fell down, and
  slept, and in my dream I heard a voice say:</p>

  <p>"'O Gaspar! Thy faith hath conquered! Blessed art thou! With two others,
  come from the uttermost parts of the earth, thou shalt see Him that is
  promised, and be a witness for him, and the occasion of testimony in his
  behalf. In the morning arise, and go meet them, and keep trust in the Spirit
  that shall guide thee.'</p>

  <p>"And in the morning I awoke with the Spirit as a light within me
  surpassing that of the sun. I put off my hermit's garb, and dressed myself as
  of old. From a hiding-place I took the treasure which I had brought from the
  city. A ship went sailing past. I hailed it, was taken aboard, and landed at
  Antioch. There I bought the camel and his furniture. Through the gardens and
  orchards that enamel the banks of the Orontes, I journeyed to Emesa,
  Damascus, Bostra, and Philadelphia; thence hither. And so, O brethren, you
  have my story. Let me now listen to you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch104"
     name="ch104"></a>IV. &mdash; SPEECH OF THE HINDOO&mdash;LOVE</h2>

  <p class="first">The Egyptian and the Hindoo looked at each other; the former
  waved his hand; the latter bowed, and began:</p>

  <p>"Our brother has spoken well. May my words be as wise."</p>

  <p>He broke off, reflected a moment, then resumed:</p>

  <p>"You may know me, brethren, by the name of Melchior. I speak to you in a
  language which, if not the oldest in the world, was at least the soonest to
  be reduced to letters&mdash;I mean the Sanscrit of India. I am a Hindoo by
  birth. My people were the first to walk in the fields of knowledge, first to
  divide them, first to make them beautiful. Whatever may hereafter befall, the
  four Vedas must live, for they are the primal fountains of religion and
  useful intelligence. From them were derived the Upa-Vedas, which, delivered
  by Brahma, treat of medicine, archery, architecture, music, and the
  four-and-sixty mechanical arts; the Ved-Angas, revealed by inspired saints,
  and devoted to astronomy, grammar, prosody, pronunciation, charms and
  incantations, religious rites and ceremonies; the Up-Angas, written by the
  sage Vyasa, and given to cosmogony, chronology, and geography; therein also
  are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, heroic poems, designed for the
  perpetuation of our gods and demi-gods. Such, O brethren, are the Great
  Shastras, or books of sacred ordinances. They are dead to me now; yet through
  all time they will serve to illustrate the budding genius of my race. They
  were promises of quick perfection. Ask you why the promises failed? Alas! the
  books themselves closed all the gates of progress. Under pretext of care for
  the creature, their authors imposed the fatal principle that a man must not
  address himself to discovery or invention, as Heaven had provided him all
  things needful. When that condition became a sacred law, the lamp of Hindoo
  genius was let down a well, where ever since it has lighted narrow walls and
  bitter waters.</p>

  <p>"These allusions, brethren, are not from pride, as you will understand
  when I tell you that the Shastras teach a Supreme God called Brahm; also,
  that the Puranas, or sacred poems of the Up-Angas, tell us of Virtue and Good
  Works, and of the Soul. So, if my brother will permit the saying"&mdash;the
  speaker bowed deferentially to the Greek&mdash;"ages before his people were
  known, the two great ideas, God and the Soul, had absorbed all the forces of
  the Hindoo mind. In further explanation let me say that Brahm is taught, by
  the same sacred books, as a Triad&mdash;Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Of these,
  Brahma is said to have been the author of our race; which, in course of
  creation, he divided into four castes. First, he peopled the worlds below and
  the heavens above; next, he made the earth ready for terrestrial spirits;
  then from his mouth proceeded the Brahman caste, nearest in likeness to
  himself, highest and noblest, sole teachers of the Vedas, which at the same
  time flowed from his lips in finished state, perfect in all useful knowledge.
  From his arms next issued the Kshatriya, or warriors; from his breast, the
  seat of life, came the Vaisya, or producers&mdash;shepherds, farmers,
  merchants; from his foot, in sign of degradation, sprang the Sudra, or
  serviles, doomed to menial duties for the other classes&mdash;serfs,
  domestics, laborers, artisans. Take notice, further, that the law, so born
  with them, forbade a man of one caste becoming a member of another; the
  Brahman could not enter a lower order; if he violated the laws of his own
  grade, he became an outcast, lost to all but outcasts like himself."</p>

  <p>At this point, the imagination of the Greek, flashing forward upon all the
  consequences of such a degradation, overcame his eager attention, and he
  exclaimed, "In such a state, O brethren, what mighty need of a loving
  God!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," added the Egyptian, "of a loving God like ours."</p>

  <p>The brows of the Hindoo knit painfully; when the emotion was spent, he
  proceeded, in a softened voice.</p>

  <p>"I was born a Brahman. My life, consequently, was ordered down to its
  least act, its last hour. My first draught of nourishment; the giving me my
  compound name; taking me out the first time to see the sun; investing me with
  the triple thread by which I became one of the twice-born; my induction into
  the first order&mdash;were all celebrated with sacred texts and rigid
  ceremonies. I might not walk, eat, drink, or sleep without danger of
  violating a rule. And the penalty, O brethren, the penalty was to my soul!
  According to the degrees of omission, my soul went to one of the
  heavens&mdash;Indra's the lowest, Brahma's the highest; or it was driven back
  to become the life of a worm, a fly, a fish, or a brute. The reward for
  perfect observance was Beatitude, or absorption into the being of Brahm,
  which was not existence as much as absolute rest."</p>

  <p>The Hindoo gave himself a moment's thought; proceeding, he said: "The part
  of a Brahman's life called the first order is his student life. When I was
  ready to enter the second order&mdash;that is to say, when I was ready to
  marry and become a householder&mdash;I questioned everything, even Brahm; I
  was a heretic. From the depths of the well I had discovered a light above,
  and yearned to go up and see what all it shone upon. At last&mdash;ah, with
  what years of toil!&mdash;I stood in the perfect day, and beheld the
  principle of life, the element of religion, the link between the soul and
  God&mdash;Love!"</p>

  <p>The shrunken face of the good man kindled visibly, and he clasped his
  hands with force. A silence ensued, during which the others looked at him,
  the Greek through tears. At length he resumed:</p>

  <p>"The happiness of love is in action; its test is what one is willing to do
  for others. I could not rest. Brahm had filled the world with so much
  wretchedness. The Sudra appealed to me, so did the countless devotees and
  victims. The island of Ganga Lagor lies where the sacred waters of the Ganges
  disappear in the Indian Ocean. Thither I betook myself. In the shade of the
  temple built there to the sage Kapila, in a union of prayers with the
  disciples whom the sanctified memory of the holy man keeps around his house,
  I thought to find rest. But twice every year came pilgrimages of Hindoos
  seeking the purification of the waters. Their misery strengthened my love.
  Against its impulse to speak I clenched my jaws; for one word against Brahm
  or the Triad or the Shastras would doom me; one act of kindness to the
  outcast Brahmans who now and then dragged themselves to die on the burning
  sands&mdash;a blessing said, a cup of water given&mdash;and I became one of
  them, lost to family, country, privileges, caste. The love conquered! I spoke
  to the disciples in the temple; they drove me out. I spoke to the pilgrims;
  they stoned me from the island. On the highways I attempted to preach; my
  hearers fled from me, or sought my life. In all India, finally, there was not
  a place in which I could find peace or safety&mdash;not even among the
  outcasts, for, though fallen, they were still believers in Brahm. In my
  extremity, I looked for a solitude in which to hide from all but God. I
  followed the Ganges to its source, far up in the Himalayas. When I entered
  the pass at Hurdwar, where the river, in unstained purity, leaps to its
  course through the muddy lowlands, I prayed for my race, and thought myself
  lost to them forever. Through gorges, over cliffs, across glaciers, by peaks
  that seemed star-high, I made my way to the Lang Tso, a lake of marvellous
  beauty, asleep at the feet of the Tise Gangri, the Gurla, and the Kailas
  Parbot, giants which flaunt their crowns of snow everlastingly in the face of
  the sun. There, in the centre of the earth, where the Indus, Ganges, and
  Brahmapootra rise to run their different courses; where mankind took up their
  first abode, and separated to replete the world, leaving Balk, the mother of
  cities, to attest the great fact; where Nature, gone back to its primeval
  condition, and secure in its immensities, invites the sage and the exile,
  with promise of safety to the one and solitude to the other&mdash;there I
  went to abide alone with God, praying, fasting, waiting for death."</p>

  <p>Again the voice fell, and the bony hands met in a fervent clasp.</p>

  <p>"One night I walked by the shores of the lake, and spoke to the listening
  silence, 'When will God come and claim his own? Is there to be no
  redemption?' Suddenly a light began to glow tremulously out on the water;
  soon a star arose, and moved towards me, and stood overhead. The brightness
  stunned me. While I lay upon the ground, I heard a voice of infinite
  sweetness say, 'Thy love hath conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of India!
  The redemption is at hand. With two others, from far quarters of the earth,
  thou shalt see the Redeemer, and be a witness that he hath come. In the
  morning arise, and go meet them; and put all thy trust in the Spirit which
  shall guide thee.'</p>

  <p>"And from that time the light has stayed with me; so I knew it was the
  visible presence of the Spirit. In the morning I started to the world by the
  way I had come. In a cleft of the mountain I found a stone of vast worth,
  which I sold in Hurdwar. By Lahore, and Cabool, and Yezd, I came to Ispahan.
  There I bought the camel, and thence was led to Bagdad, not waiting for
  caravans. Alone I traveled, fearless, for the Spirit was with me, and is with
  me yet. What glory is ours, O brethren! We are to see the Redeemer&mdash;to
  speak to him&mdash;to worship him! I am done."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch105"
     name="ch105"></a>V. &mdash; THE EGYPTIAN'S STORY&mdash;GOOD WORKS</h2>

  <p class="first">The vivacious Greek broke forth in expressions of joy and
  congratulations; after which the Egyptian said, with characteristic
  gravity:</p>

  <p>"I salute you, my brother. You have suffered much, and I rejoice in your
  triumph. If you are both pleased to hear me, I will now tell you who I am,
  and how I came to be called. Wait for me a moment."</p>

  <p>He went out and tended the camels; coming back, he resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Your words, brethren, were of the Spirit," he said, in commencement; "and
  the Spirit gives me to understand them. You each spoke particularly of your
  countries; in that there was a great object, which I will explain; but to
  make the interpretation complete, let me first speak of myself and my people.
  I am Balthasar the Egyptian."</p>

  <p>The last words were spoken quietly, but with so much dignity that both
  listeners bowed to the speaker.</p>

  <p>"There are many distinctions I might claim for my race," he continued;
  "but I will content myself with one. History began with us. We were the first
  to perpetuate events by records kept. So we have no traditions; and instead
  of poetry, we offer you certainty. On the facades of palaces and temples, on
  obelisks, on the inner walls of tombs, we wrote the names of our kings, and
  what they did; and to the delicate papyri we intrusted the wisdom of our
  philosophers and the secrets of our religion&mdash;all the secrets but one,
  whereof I will presently speak. Older than the Vedas of Para-Brahm or the
  Up-Angas of Vyasa, O Melchior; older than the songs of Homer or the
  metaphysics of Plato, O my Gaspar; older than the sacred books or kings of
  the people of China, or those of Siddartha, son of the beautiful Maya; older
  than the Genesis of Mosche the Hebrew&mdash;oldest of human records are the
  writings of Menes, our first king." Pausing an instant, he fixed his large
  eves kindly upon the Greek, saying, "In the youth of Hellas, who, O Gaspar,
  were the teachers of her teachers?"</p>

  <p>The Greek bowed, smiling.</p>

  <p>"By those records," Balthasar continued, "we know that when the fathers
  came from the far East, from the region of the birth of the three sacred
  rivers, from the centre of the earth&mdash;the Old Iran of which you spoke, O
  Melchior&mdash;came bringing with them the history of the world before the
  Flood, and of the Flood itself, as given to the Aryans by the sons of Noah,
  they taught God, the Creator and the Beginning, and the Soul, deathless as
  God. When the duty which calls us now is happily done, if you choose to go
  with me, I will show you the sacred library of our priesthood; among others,
  the Book of the Dead, in which is the ritual to be observed by the soul after
  Death has despatched it on its journey to judgment. The ideas&mdash;God and
  the Immortal Soul&mdash;were borne to Mizraim over the desert, and by him to
  the banks of the Nile. They were then in their purity, easy of understanding,
  as what God intends for our happiness always is; so, also, was the first
  worship&mdash;a song and a prayer natural to a soul joyous, hopeful, and in
  love with its Maker."</p>

  <p>Here the Greek threw up his hands, exclaiming, "Oh! the light deepens
  within me!"</p>

  <p>"And in me!" said the Hindoo, with equal fervor.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian regarded them benignantly, then went on, saying, "Religion is
  merely the law which binds man to his Creator: in purity it has but these
  elements&mdash;God, the Soul, and their Mutual Recognition; out of which,
  when put in practise, spring Worship, Love, and Reward. This law, like all
  others of divine origin&mdash;like that, for instance, which binds the earth
  to the sun&mdash;was perfected in the beginning by its Author. Such, my
  brothers, was the religion of the first family; such was the religion of our
  father Mizraim, who could not have been blind to the formula of creation,
  nowhere so discernible as in the first faith and the earliest worship.
  Perfection is God; simplicity is perfection. The curse of curses is that men
  will not let truths like these alone."</p>

  <p>He stopped, as if considering in what manner to continue.</p>

  <p>"Many nations have loved the sweet waters of the Nile," he said next; "the
  Ethiopian, the Pali-Putra, the Hebrew, the Assyrian, the Persian, the
  Macedonian, the Roman&mdash;of whom all, except the Hebrew, have at one time
  or another been its masters. So much coming and going of peoples corrupted
  the old Mizraimic faith. The Valley of Palms became a Valley of Gods. The
  Supreme One was divided into eight, each personating a creative principle in
  nature, with Ammon-Re at the head. Then Isis and Osiris, and their circle,
  representing water, fire, air, and other forces, were invented. Still the
  multiplication went on until we had another order, suggested by human
  qualities, such as strength, knowledge, love, and the like."</p>

  <p>"In all which there was the old folly!" cried the Greek, impulsively.
  "Only the things out of reach remain as they came to us."</p>

  <p>The Egyptian bowed, and proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Yet a little further, O my brethren, a little further, before I come to
  myself. What we go to will seem all the holier of comparison with what is and
  has been. The records show that Mizraim found the Nile in possession of the
  Ethiopians, who were spread thence through the African desert; a people of
  rich, fantastic genius, wholly given to the worship of nature. The Poetic
  Persian sacrificed to the sun, as the completest image of Ormuzd, his God;
  the devout children of the far East carved their deities out of wood and
  ivory; but the Ethiopian, without writing, without books, without mechanical
  faculty of any kind, quieted his soul by the worship of animals, birds, and
  insects, holding the cat sacred to Re, the bull to Isis, the beetle to Pthah.
  A long struggle against their rude faith ended in its adoption as the
  religion of the new empire. Then rose the mighty monuments that cumber the
  river-bank and the desert&mdash;obelisk, labyrinth, pyramid, and tomb of
  king, blent with tomb of crocodile. Into such deep debasement, O brethren,
  the sons of the Aryan fell!"</p>

  <p>Here, for the first time, the calmness of the Egyptian forsook him: though
  his countenance remained impassive, his voice gave way.</p>

  <p>"Do not too much despise my countrymen," he began again. "They did not all
  forget God. I said awhile ago, you may remember, that to papyri we intrusted
  all the secrets of our religion except one; of that I will now tell you. We
  had as king once a certain Pharaoh, who lent himself to all manner of changes
  and additions. To establish the new system, he strove to drive the old
  entirely out of mind. The Hebrews then dwelt with us as slaves. They clung to
  their God; and when the persecution became intolerable, they were delivered
  in a manner never to be forgotten. I speak from the records now. Mosche,
  himself a Hebrew, came to the palace, and demanded permission for the slaves,
  then millions in number, to leave the country. The demand was in the name of
  the Lord God of Israel. Pharaoh refused. Hear what followed. First, all the
  water, that in the lakes and rivers, like that in the wells and vessels,
  turned to blood. Yet the monarch refused. Then frogs came up and covered all
  the land. Still he was firm. Then Mosche threw ashes in the air, and a plague
  attacked the Egyptians. Next, all the cattle, except of the Hebrews, were
  struck dead. Locusts devoured the green things of the valley. At noon the day
  was turned into a darkness so thick that lamps would not burn. Finally, in
  the night all the first-born of the Egyptians died; not even Pharaoh's
  escaped. Then he yielded. But when the Hebrews were gone he followed them
  with his army. At the last moment the sea was divided, so that the fugitives
  passed it dry-shod. When the pursuers drove in after them, the waves rushed
  back and drowned horse, foot, charioteers, and king. You spoke of revelation,
  my Gaspar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The blue eyes of the Greek sparkled.</p>

  <p>"I had the story from the Jew," he cried. "You confirm it, O
  Balthasar!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but through me Egypt speaks, not Mosche. I interpret the marbles.
  The priests of that time wrote in their way what they witnessed, and the
  revelation has lived. So I come to the one unrecorded secret. In my country,
  brethren, we have, from the day of the unfortunate Pharaoh, always had two
  religions&mdash;one private, the other public; one of many gods, practised by
  the people; the other of one God, cherished only by the priesthood. Rejoice
  with me, O brothers! All the trampling by the many nations, all the harrowing
  by kings, all the inventions of enemies, all the changes of time, have been
  in vain. Like a seed under the mountains waiting its hour, the glorious Truth
  has lived; and this&mdash;this is its day!"</p>

  <p>The wasted frame of the Hindoo trembled with delight, and the Greek cried
  aloud,</p>

  <p>"It seems to me the very desert is singing."</p>

  <p>From a gurglet of water near-by the Egyptian took a draught, and
  proceeded:</p>

  <p>"I was born at Alexandria, a prince and a priest, and had the education
  usual to my class. But very early I became discontented. Part of the faith
  imposed was that after death upon the destruction of the body, the soul at
  once began its former progression from the lowest up to humanity, the highest
  and last existence; and that without reference to conduct in the mortal life.
  When I heard of the Persian's Realm of Light, his Paradise across the bridge
  Chinevat, where only the good go, the thought haunted me; insomuch that in
  the day, as in the night, I brooded over the comparative ideas Eternal
  Transmigration and Eternal Life in Heaven. If, as my teacher taught, God was
  just, why was there no distinction between the good and the bad? At length it
  became clear to me, a certainty, a corollary of the law to which I reduced
  pure religion, that death was only the point of separation at which the
  wicked are left or lost, and the faithful rise to a higher life; not the
  nirvana of Buddha, or the negative rest of Brahma, O Melchior; nor the better
  condition in hell, which is all of Heaven allowed by the Olympic faith, O
  Gaspar; but life&mdash;life active, joyous, everlasting&mdash;LIFE WITH GOD!
  The discovery led to another inquiry. Why should the Truth be longer kept a
  secret for the selfish solace of the priesthood? The reason for the
  suppression was gone. Philosophy had at least brought us toleration. In Egypt
  we had Rome instead of Rameses. One day, in the Brucheium, the most splendid
  and crowded quarter of Alexandria, I arose and preached. The East and West
  contributed to my audience. Students going to the Library, priests from the
  Serapeion, idlers from the Museum, patrons of the race-course, countrymen
  from the Rhacotis&mdash;a multitude&mdash;stopped to hear me. I preached God,
  the Soul, Right and Wrong, and Heaven, the reward of a virtuous life. You, O
  Melchior, were stoned; my auditors first wondered, then laughed. I tried
  again; they pelted me with epigrams, covered my God with ridicule, and
  darkened my Heaven with mockery. Not to linger needlessly, I fell before
  them."</p>

  <p>The Hindoo here drew a long sigh, as he said, "The enemy of man is man, my
  brother."</p>

  <p>Balthasar lapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"I gave much thought to finding the cause of my failure, and at last
  succeeded," he said, upon beginning again. "Up the river, a day's journey
  from the city, there is a village of herdsmen and gardeners. I took a boat
  and went there. In the evening I called the people together, men and women,
  the poorest of the poor. I preached to them exactly as I had preached in the
  Brucheium. They did not laugh. Next evening I spoke again, and they believed
  and rejoiced, and carried the news abroad. At the third meeting a society was
  formed for prayer. I returned to the city then. Drifting down the river,
  under the stars, which never seemed so bright and so near, I evolved this
  lesson: To begin a reform, go not into the places of the great and rich; go
  rather to those whose cups of happiness are empty&mdash;to the poor and
  humble. And then I laid a plan and devoted my life. As a first step, I
  secured my vast property, so that the income would be certain, and always at
  call for the relief of the suffering. From that day, O brethren, I travelled
  up and down the Nile, in the villages, and to all the tribes, preaching One
  God, a righteous life, and reward in Heaven. I have done good&mdash;it does
  not become me to say how much. I also know that part of the world to be ripe
  for the reception of Him we go to find."</p>

  <p>A flush suffused the swarthy cheek of the speaker; but he overcame the
  feeling, and continued:</p>

  <p>"The years so given, O my brothers, were troubled by one
  thought&mdash;When I was gone, what would become of the cause I had started?
  Was it to end with me? I had dreamed many times of organization as a fitting
  crown for my work. To hide nothing from you, I had tried to effect it, and
  failed. Brethren, the world is now in the condition that, to restore the old
  Mizraimic faith, the reformer must have a more than human sanction; he must
  not merely come in God's name, he must have the proofs subject to his word;
  he must demonstrate all he says, even God. So preoccupied is the mind with
  myths and systems; so much do false deities crowd every place&mdash;earth,
  air, sky; so have they become of everything a part, that return to the first
  religion can only be along bloody paths, through fields of persecution; that
  is to say, the converts must be willing to die rather than recant. And who in
  this age can carry the faith of men to such a point but God himself? To
  redeem the race&mdash;I do not mean to destroy it&mdash;to REDEEM the race,
  he must make himself once more manifest; HE MUST COME IN PERSON."</p>

  <p>Intense emotion seized the three.</p>

  <p>"Are we not going to find him?" exclaimed the Greek.</p>

  <p>"You understand why I failed in the attempt to organize," said the
  Egyptian, when the spell was past. "I had not the sanction. To know that my
  work must be lost made me intolerably wretched. I believed in prayer, and to
  make my appeals pure and strong, like you, my brethren, I went out of the
  beaten ways, I went where man had not been, where only God was. Above the
  fifth cataract, above the meeting of rivers in Sennar, up the Bahr el Abiad,
  into the far unknown of Africa, I went. There, in the morning, a mountain
  blue as the sky flings a cooling shadow wide over the western desert, and,
  with its cascades of melted snow, feeds a broad lake nestling at its base on
  the east. The lake is the mother of the great river. For a year and more the
  mountain gave me a home. The fruit of the palm fed my body, prayer my spirit.
  One night I walked in the orchard close by the little sea. 'The world is
  dying. When wilt thou come? Why may I not see the redemption, O God?' So I
  prayed. The glassy water was sparkling with stars. One of them seemed to
  leave its place, and rise to the surface, where it became a brilliancy
  burning to the eyes. Then it moved towards me, and stood over my head,
  apparently in hand's reach. I fell down and hid my face. A voice, not of the
  earth, said, 'Thy good works have conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of
  Mizraim! The redemption cometh. With two others, from the remotenesses of the
  world, thou shalt see the Saviour, and testify for him. In the morning arise,
  and go meet them. And when ye have all come to the holy city of Jerusalem,
  ask of the people, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
  seen his star in the East and are sent to worship him. Put all thy trust in
  the Spirit which will guide thee.'</p>

  <p>"And the light became an inward illumination not to be doubted, and has
  stayed with me, a governor and a guide. It led me down the river to Memphis,
  where I made ready for the desert. I bought my camel, and came hither without
  rest, by way of Suez and Kufileh, and up through the lands of Moab and Ammon.
  God is with us, O my brethren!"</p>

  <p>He paused, and thereupon, with a prompting not their own, they all arose,
  and looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"I said there was a purpose in the particularity with which we described
  our people and their histories," so the Egyptian proceeded. "He we go to find
  was called 'King of the Jews;' by that name we are bidden to ask for him.
  But, now that we have met, and heard from each other, we may know him to be
  the Redeemer, not of the Jews alone, but of all the nations of the earth. The
  patriarch who survived the Flood had with him three sons, and their families,
  by whom the world was repeopled. From the old Aryana-Vaejo, the
  well-remembered Region of Delight in the heart of Asia, they parted. India
  and the far East received the children of the first; the descendant of the
  youngest, through the North, streamed into Europe; those of the second
  overflowed the deserts about the Red Sea, passing into Africa; and though
  most of the latter are yet dwellers in shifting tents, some of them became
  builders along the Nile."</p>

  <p>By a simultaneous impulse the three joined hands.</p>

  <p>"Could anything be more divinely ordered?" Balthasar continued. "When we
  have found the Lord, the brothers, and all the generations that have
  succeeded them, will kneel to him in homage with us. And when we part to go
  our separate ways, the world will have learned a new lesson&mdash;that Heaven
  may be won, not by the sword, not by human wisdom, but by Faith, Love, and
  Good Works."</p>

  <p>There was silence, broken by sighs and sanctified with tears; for the joy
  that filled them might not be stayed. It was the unspeakable joy of souls on
  the shores of the River of Life, resting with the Redeemed in God's
  presence.</p>

  <p>Presently their hands fell apart, and together they went out of the tent.
  The desert was still as the sky. The sun was sinking fast. The camels
  slept.</p>

  <p>A little while after, the tent was struck, and, with the remains of the
  repast, restored to the cot; then the friends mounted, and set out single
  file, led by the Egyptian. Their course was due west, into the chilly night.
  The camels swung forward in steady trot, keeping the line and the intervals
  so exactly that those following seemed to tread in the tracks of the leader.
  The riders spoke not once.</p>

  <p>By-and-by the moon came up. And as the three tall white figures sped, with
  soundless tread, through the opalescent light, they appeared like specters
  flying from hateful shadows. Suddenly, in the air before them, not farther up
  than a low hill-top flared a lambent flame; as they looked at it, the
  apparition contracted into a focus of dazzling lustre. Their hearts beat
  fast; their souls thrilled; and they shouted as with one voice, "The Star!
  the Star! God is with us!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch106"
     name="ch106"></a>VI. &mdash; THE JOPPA GATE</h2>

  <p class="first">In an aperture of the western wall of Jerusalem hang the
  "oaken valves" called the Bethlehem or Joppa Gate. The area outside of them
  is one of the notable places of the city. Long before David coveted Zion
  there was a citadel there. When at last the son of Jesse ousted the Jebusite,
  and began to build, the site of the citadel became the northwest corner of
  the new wall, defended by a tower much more imposing than the old one. The
  location of the gate, however, was not disturbed, for the reasons, most
  likely, that the roads which met and merged in front of it could not well be
  transferred to any other point, while the area outside had become a
  recognized market-place. In Solomon's day there was great traffic at the
  locality, shared in by traders from Egypt and the rich dealers from Tyre and
  Sidon. Nearly three thousand years have passed, and yet a kind of commerce
  clings to the spot. A pilgrim wanting a pin or a pistol, a cucumber or a
  camel, a house or a horse, a loan or a lentil, a date or a dragoman, a melon
  or a man, a dove or a donkey, has only to inquire for the article at the
  Joppa Gate. Sometimes the scene is quite animated, and then it suggests, What
  a place the old market must have been in the days of Herod the Builder! And
  to that period and that market the reader is now to be transferred.</p>

  <p>Following the Hebrew system, the meeting of the wise men described in the
  preceding chapters took place in the afternoon of the twenty-fifth day of the
  third month of the year; that is say, on the twenty-fifth day of December.
  The year was the second of the 193d Olympiad, or the 747th of Rome; the
  sixty-seventh of Herod the Great, and the thirty-fifth of his reign; the
  fourth before the beginning of the Christian era. The hours of the day, by
  Judean custom, begin with the sun, the first hour being the first after
  sunrise; so, to be precise; the market at the Joppa Gate during the first
  hour of the day stated was in full session, and very lively. The massive
  valves had been wide open since dawn. Business, always aggressive, had pushed
  through the arched entrance into a narrow lane and court, which, passing by
  the walls of the great tower, conducted on into the city. As Jerusalem is in
  the hill country, the morning air on this occasion was not a little crisp.
  The rays of the sun, with their promise of warmth, lingered provokingly far
  up on the battlements and turrets of the great piles about, down from which
  fell the crooning of pigeons and the whir of the flocks coming and going.</p>

  <p>As a passing acquaintance with the people of the Holy City, strangers as
  well as residents, will be necessary to an understanding of some of the pages
  which follow, it will be well to stop at the gate and pass the scene in
  review. Better opportunity will not offer to get sight of the populace who
  will afterwhile go forward in a mood very different from that which now
  possesses them.</p>

  <p>The scene is at first one of utter confusion&mdash;confusion of action,
  sounds, colors, and things. It is especially so in the lane and court. The
  ground there is paved with broad unshaped flags, from which each cry and jar
  and hoof-stamp arises to swell the medley that rings and roars up between the
  solid impending walls. A little mixing with the throng, however, a little
  familiarity with the business going on, will make analysis possible.</p>

  <p>Here stands a donkey, dozing under panniers full of lentils, beans,
  onions, and cucumbers, brought fresh from the gardens and terraces of
  Galilee. When not engaged in serving customers, the master, in a voice which
  only the initiated can understand, cries his stock. Nothing can be simpler
  than his costume&mdash;sandals, and an unbleached, undyed blanket, crossed
  over one shoulder and girt round the waist. Near-by, and far more imposing
  and grotesque, though scarcely as patient as the donkey, kneels a camel,
  raw-boned, rough, and gray, with long shaggy tufts of fox-colored hair under
  its throat, neck, and body, and a load of boxes and baskets curiously
  arranged upon an enormous saddle. The owner is an Egyptian, small, lithe, and
  of a complexion which has borrowed a good deal from the dust of the roads and
  the sands of the desert. He wears a faded tarbooshe, a loose gown,
  sleeveless, unbelted, and dropping from the neck to the knee. His feet are
  bare. The camel, restless under the load, groans and occasionally shows his
  teeth; but the man paces indifferently to and fro, holding the driving-strap,
  and all the time advertising his fruits fresh from the orchards of the
  Kedron&mdash;grapes, dates, figs, apples, and pomegranates.</p>

  <p>At the corner where the lane opens out into the court, some women sit with
  their backs against the gray stones of the wall. Their dress is that common
  to the humbler classes of the country&mdash;a linen frock extending the full
  length of the person, loosely gathered at the waist, and a veil or wimple
  broad enough, after covering the head, to wrap the shoulders. Their
  merchandise is contained in a number of earthen jars, such as are still used
  in the East for bringing water from the wells, and some leathern bottles.
  Among the jars and bottles, rolling upon the stony floor, regardless of the
  crowd and cold, often in danger but never hurt, play half a dozen half-naked
  children, their brown bodies, jetty eyes, and thick black hair attesting the
  blood of Israel. Sometimes, from under the wimples, the mothers look up, and
  in the vernacular modestly bespeak their trade: in the bottles "honey of
  grapes," in the jars "strong drink." Their entreaties are usually lost in the
  general uproar, and they fare illy against the many competitors: brawny
  fellows with bare legs, dirty tunics, and long beards, going about with
  bottles lashed to their backs, and shouting "Honey of wine! Grapes of
  En-Gedi!" When a customer halts one of them, round comes the bottle, and,
  upon lifting the thumb from the nozzle, out into the ready cup gushes the
  deep-red blood of the luscious berry.</p>

  <p>Scarcely less blatant are the dealers in birds&mdash;doves, ducks, and
  frequently the singing bulbul, or nightingale, most frequently pigeons; and
  buyers, receiving them from the nets, seldom fail to think of the perilous
  life of the catchers, bold climbers of the cliffs; now hanging with hand and
  foot to the face of the crag, now swinging in a basket far down the mountain
  fissure.</p>

  <p>Blent with peddlers of jewelry&mdash;sharp men cloaked in scarlet and
  blue, top-heavy under prodigious white turbans, and fully conscious of the
  power there is in the lustre of a ribbon and the incisive gleam of gold,
  whether in bracelet or necklace, or in rings for the finger or the
  nose&mdash;and with peddlers of household utensils, and with dealers in
  wearing-apparel, and with retailers of unguents for anointing the person, and
  with hucksters of all articles, fanciful as well as of need, hither and
  thither, tugging at halters and ropes, now screaming, now coaxing, toil the
  venders of animals&mdash;donkeys, horses, calves, sheep, bleating kids, and
  awkward camels; animals of every kind except the outlawed swine. All these
  are there; not singly, as described, but many times repeated; not in one
  place, but everywhere in the market.</p>

  <p>Turning from this scene in the lane and court, this glance at the sellers
  and their commodities, the reader has need to give attention, in the next
  place, to visitors and buyers, for which the best studies will be found
  outside the gates, where the spectacle is quite as varied and animated;
  indeed, it may be more so, for there are superadded the effects of tent,
  booth, and sook, greater space, larger crowd, more unqualified freedom, and
  the glory of the Eastern sunshine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch107"
     name="ch107"></a>VII. &mdash; TYPICAL CHARACTERS AT THE JOPPA GATE</h2>

  <p class="first">Let us take our stand by the gate, just out of the edge of
  the currents&mdash;one flowing in, the other out&mdash;and use our eyes and
  ears awhile.</p>

  <p>In good time! Here come two men of a most noteworthy class.</p>

  <p>"Gods! How cold it is!" says one of them, a powerful figure in armor; on
  his head a brazen helmet, on his body a shining breastplate and skirts of
  mail. "How cold it is! Dost thou remember, my Caius, that vault in the
  Comitium at home which the flamens say is the entrance to the lower world? By
  Pluto! I could stand there this morning, long enough at least to get warm
  again!"</p>

  <p>The party addressed drops the hood of his military cloak, leaving bare his
  head and face, and replies, with an ironic smile, "The helmets of the legions
  which conquered Mark Antony were full of Gallic snow; but thou&mdash;ah, my
  poor friend!&mdash;thou hast just come from Egypt, bringing its summer in thy
  blood."</p>

  <p>And with the last word they disappear through the entrance. Though they
  had been silent, the armor and the sturdy step would have published them
  Roman soldiers.</p>

  <p>From the throng a Jew comes next, meager of frame, round-shouldered, and
  wearing a coarse brown robe; over his eyes and face, and down his back, hangs
  a mat of long, uncombed hair. He is alone. Those who meet him laugh, if they
  do not worse; for he is a Nazarite, one of a despised sect which rejects the
  books of Moses, devotes itself to abhorred vows, and goes unshorn while the
  vows endure.</p>

  <p>As we watch his retiring figure, suddenly there is a commotion in the
  crowd, a parting quickly to the right and left, with exclamations sharp and
  decisive. Then the cause comes&mdash;a man, Hebrew in feature and dress. The
  mantle of snow-white linen, held to his head by cords of yellow silk, flows
  free over his shoulders; his robe is richly embroidered, a red sash with
  fringes of gold wraps his waist several times. His demeanor is calm; he even
  smiles upon those who, with such rude haste, make room for him. A leper? No,
  he is only a Samaritan. The shrinking crowd, if asked, would say he is a
  mongrel&mdash;an Assyrian&mdash;whose touch of the robe is pollution; from
  whom, consequently, an Israelite, though dying, might not accept life. In
  fact, the feud is not of blood. When David set his throne here on Mount Zion,
  with only Judah to support him, the ten tribes betook themselves to Shechem,
  a city much older, and, at that date, infinitely richer in holy memories. The
  final union of the tribes did not settle the dispute thus begun. The
  Samaritans clung to their tabernacle on Gerizim, and, while maintaining its
  superior sanctity, laughed at the irate doctors in Jerusalem. Time brought no
  assuagement of the hate. Under Herod, conversion to the faith was open to all
  the world except the Samaritans; they alone were absolutely and forever shut
  out from communion with Jews.</p>

  <p>As the Samaritan goes in under the arch of the gate, out come three men so
  unlike all whom we have yet seen that they fix our gaze, whether we will or
  not. They are of unusual stature and immense brawn; their eyes are blue, and
  so fair is their complexion that the blood shines through the skin like blue
  pencilling; their hair is light and short; their heads, small and round, rest
  squarely upon necks columnar as the trunks of trees. Woollen tunics, open at
  the breast, sleeveless and loosely girt, drape their bodies, leaving bare
  arms and legs of such development that they at once suggest the arena; and
  when thereto we add their careless, confident, insolent manner, we cease to
  wonder that the people give them way, and stop after they have passed to look
  at them again. They are gladiators&mdash;wrestlers, runners, boxers,
  swordsmen; professionals unknown in Judea before the coming of the Roman;
  fellows who, what time they are not in training, may be seen strolling
  through the king's gardens or sitting with the guards at the palace gates; or
  possibly they are visitors from Caesarea, Sebaste, or Jericho; in which
  Herod, more Greek than Jew, and with all a Roman's love of games and bloody
  spectacles, has built vast theaters, and now keeps schools of fighting-men,
  drawn, as is the custom, from the Gallic provinces or the Slavic tribes on
  the Danube.</p>

  <p>"By Bacchus!" says one of them, drawing his clenched hand to his shoulder,
  "their skulls are not thicker than eggshells."</p>

  <p>The brutal look which goes with the gesture disgusts us, and we turn
  happily to something more pleasant.</p>

  <p>Opposite us is a fruit-stand. The proprietor has a bald head, a long face,
  and a nose like the beak of a hawk. He sits upon a carpet spread upon the
  dust; the wall is at his back; overhead hangs a scant curtain, around him,
  within hand's reach and arranged upon little stools, lie osier boxes full of
  almonds, grapes, figs, and pomegranates. To him now comes one at whom we
  cannot help looking, though for another reason than that which fixed our eyes
  upon the gladiators; he is really beautiful&mdash;a beautiful Greek. Around
  his temples, holding the waving hair, is a crown of myrtle, to which still
  cling the pale flowers and half ripe berries. His tunic, scarlet in color, is
  of the softest woollen fabric; below the girdle of buff leather, which is
  clasped in front by a fantastic device of shining gold, the skirt drops to
  the knee in folds heavy with embroidery of the same royal metal; a scarf,
  also woollen, and of mixed white and yellow, crosses his throat and falls
  trailing at his back; his arms and legs, where exposed, are white as ivory,
  and of the polish impossible except by perfect treatment with bath, oil,
  brushes, and pincers.</p>

  <p>The dealer, keeping his seat, bends forward, and throws his hands up until
  they meet in front of him, palm downwards and fingers extended.</p>

  <p>"What hast thou, this morning, O son of Paphos?" says the young Greek,
  looking at the boxes rather than at the Cypriote. "I am hungry. What hast
  thou for breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"Fruits from the Pedius&mdash;genuine&mdash;such as the singers of Antioch
  take of mornings to restore the waste of their voices," the dealer answers,
  in a querulous nasal tone.</p>

  <p>"A fig, but not one of thy best, for the singers of Antioch!" says the
  Greek. "Thou art a worshiper of Aphrodite, and so am I, as the myrtle I wear
  proves; therefore I tell thee their voices have the chill of a Caspian wind.
  Seest thou this girdle?&mdash;a gift of the mighty Salome&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The king's sister!" exclaims the Cypriote, with another salaam.</p>

  <p>"And of royal taste and divine judgment. And why not? She is more Greek
  than the king. But&mdash;my breakfast! Here is thy money&mdash;red coppers of
  Cyprus. Give me grapes, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou not take the dates also?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not an Arab."</p>

  <p>"Nor figs?"</p>

  <p>"That would be to make me a Jew. No, nothing but the grapes. Never waters
  mixed so sweetly as the blood of the Greek and the blood of the grape."</p>

  <p>The singer in the grimed and seething market, with all his airs of the
  court, is a vision not easily shut out of mind by such as see him; as if for
  the purpose, however, a person follows him challenging all our wonder. He
  comes up the road slowly, his face towards the ground; at intervals he stops,
  crosses his hands upon his breast, lengthens his countenance, and turns his
  eyes towards heaven, as if about to break into prayer. Nowhere, except in
  Jerusalem, can such a character be found. On his forehead, attached to the
  band which keeps the mantle in place, projects a leathern case, square in
  form; another similar case is tied by a thong to the left arm; the borders of
  his robe are decorated with deep fringe; and by such signs&mdash;the
  phylacteries, the enlarged borders of the garment, and the savor of intense
  holiness pervading the whole man&mdash;we know him to be a Pharisee, one of
  an organization (in religion a sect, in politics a party) whose bigotry and
  power will shortly bring the world to grief.</p>

  <p>The densest of the throng outside the gate covers the road leading off to
  Joppa. Turning from the Pharisee, we are attracted by some parties who, as
  subjects of study, opportunely separate themselves from the motley crowd.
  First among them a man of very noble appearance&mdash;clear, healthful
  complexion; bright black eyes; beard long and flowing, and rich with
  unguents; apparel well-fitting, costly, and suitable for the season. He
  carries a staff, and wears, suspended by a cord from his neck, a large golden
  seal. Several servants attend him, some of them with short swords stuck
  through their sashes; when they address him, it is with the utmost deference.
  The rest of the party consists of two Arabs of the pure desert stock; thin,
  wiry men, deeply bronzed, and with hollow cheeks, and eyes of almost evil
  brightness; on their heads red tarbooshes; over their abas, and wrapping the
  left shoulder and the body so as to leave the right arm free, brown woollen
  haicks, or blankets. There is loud chaffering, for the Arabs are leading
  horses and trying to sell them; and, in their eagerness, they speak in high,
  shrill voices. The courtly person leaves the talking mostly to his servants;
  occasionally he answers with much dignity; directly, seeing the Cypriote, he
  stops and buys some figs. And when the whole party has passed the portal,
  close after the Pharisee, if we betake ourselves to the dealer in fruits, he
  will tell, with a wonderful salaam, that the stranger is a Jew, one of the
  princes of the city, who has travelled, and learned the difference between
  the common grapes of Syria and those of Cyprus, so surpassingly rich with the
  dews of the sea.</p>

  <p>And so, till towards noon, sometimes later, the steady currents of
  business habitually flow in and out of the Joppa Gate, carrying with them
  every variety of character; including representatives of all the tribes of
  Israel, all the sects among whom the ancient faith has been parcelled and
  refined away, all the religious and social divisions, all the adventurous
  rabble who, as children of art and ministers of pleasure, riot in the
  prodigalities of Herod, and all the peoples of note at any time compassed by
  the Caesars and their predecessors, especially those dwelling within the
  circuit of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>In other words, Jerusalem, rich in sacred history, richer in connection
  with sacred prophecies&mdash;the Jerusalem of Solomon, in which silver was as
  stones, and cedars as the sycamores of the vale&mdash;had come to be but a
  copy of Rome, a center of unholy practises, a seat of pagan power. A Jewish
  king one day put on priestly garments, and went into the Holy of Holies of
  the first temple to offer incense, and he came out a leper; but in the time
  of which we are reading, Pompey entered Herod's temple and the same Holy of
  Holies, and came out without harm, finding but an empty chamber, and of God
  not a sign.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch108"
     name="ch108"></a>VIII. &mdash; JOSEPH AND MARY GOING TO BETHLEHEM</h2>

  <p class="first">The reader is now besought to return to the court described
  as part of the market at the Joppa Gate. It was the third hour of the day,
  and many of the people had gone away; yet the press continued without
  apparent abatement. Of the new-comers, there was a group over by the south
  wall, consisting of a man, a woman, and a donkey, which requires extended
  notice.</p>

  <p>The man stood by the animal's head, holding a leading-strap, and leaning
  upon a stick which seemed to have been chosen for the double purpose of goad
  and staff. His dress was like that of the ordinary Jews around him, except
  that it had an appearance of newness. The mantle dropping from his head, and
  the robe or frock which clothed his person from neck to heel, were probably
  the garments he was accustomed to wear to the synagogue on Sabbath days. His
  features were exposed, and they told of fifty years of life, a surmise
  confirmed by the gray that streaked his otherwise black beard. He looked
  around him with the half-curious, half-vacant stare of a stranger and
  provincial.</p>

  <p>The donkey ate leisurely from an armful of green grass, of which there was
  an abundance in the market. In its sleepy content, the brute did not admit of
  disturbance from the bustle and clamor about; no more was it mindful of the
  woman sitting upon its back in a cushioned pillion. An outer robe of dull
  woollen stuff completely covered her person, while a white wimple veiled her
  head and neck. Once in a while, impelled by curiosity to see or hear
  something passing, she drew the wimple aside, but so slightly that the face
  remained invisible.</p>

  <p>At length the man was accosted.</p>

  <p>"Are you not Joseph of Nazareth?"</p>

  <p>The speaker was standing close by.</p>

  <p>"I am so called," answered Joseph, turning gravely around; "And
  you&mdash;ah, peace be unto you! my friend, Rabbi Samuel!"</p>

  <p>"The same give I back to you." The Rabbi paused, looking at the woman,
  then added, "To you, and unto your house and all your helpers, be peace."</p>

  <p>With the last word, he placed one hand upon his breast, and inclined his
  head to the woman, who, to see him, had by this time withdrawn the wimple
  enough to show the face of one but a short time out of girlhood. Thereupon
  the acquaintances grasped right hands, as if to carry them to their lips; at
  the last moment, however, the clasp was let go, and each kissed his own hand,
  then put its palm upon his forehead.</p>

  <p>"There is so little dust upon your garments," the Rabbi said, familiarly,
  "that I infer you passed the night in this city of our fathers."</p>

  <p>"No," Joseph replied, "as we could only make Bethany before the night
  came, we stayed in the khan there, and took the road again at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"The journey before you is long, then&mdash;not to Joppa, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Only to Bethlehem."</p>

  <p>The countenance of the Rabbi, theretofore open and friendly, became
  lowering and sinister, and he cleared his throat with a growl instead of a
  cough.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I see," he said. "You were born in Bethlehem, and wend
  thither now, with your daughter, to be counted for taxation, as ordered by
  Caesar. The children of Jacob are as the tribes in Egypt were&mdash;only they
  have neither a Moses nor a Joshua. How are the mighty fallen!"</p>

  <p>Joseph answered, without change of posture or countenance,</p>

  <p>"The woman is not my daughter."</p>

  <p>But the Rabbi clung to the political idea; and he went on, without
  noticing the explanation, "What are the Zealots doing down in Galilee?"</p>

  <p>"I am a carpenter, and Nazareth is a village," said Joseph, cautiously.
  "The street on which my bench stands is not a road leading to any city.
  Hewing wood and sawing plank leave me no time to take part in the disputes of
  parties."</p>

  <p>"But you are a Jew," said the Rabbi, earnestly. "You are a Jew, and of the
  line of David. It is not possible you can find pleasure in the payment of any
  tax except the shekel given by ancient custom to Jehovah."</p>

  <p>Joseph held his peace.</p>

  <p>"I do not complain," his friend continued, "of the amount of the
  tax&mdash;a denarius is a trifle. Oh no! The imposition of the tax is the
  offense. And, besides, what is paying it but submission to tyranny? Tell me,
  is it true that Judas claims to be the Messiah? You live in the midst of his
  followers."</p>

  <p>"I have heard his followers say he was the Messiah," Joseph replied.</p>

  <p>At this point the wimple was drawn aside, and for an instant the whole
  face of the woman was exposed. The eyes of the Rabbi wandered that way, and
  he had time to see a countenance of rare beauty, kindled by a look of intense
  interest; then a blush overspread her cheeks and brow, and the veil was
  returned to its place.</p>

  <p>The politician forgot his subject.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter is comely," he said, speaking lower.</p>

  <p>"She is not my daughter," Joseph repeated.</p>

  <p>The curiosity of the Rabbi was aroused; seeing which, the Nazarene
  hastened to say further, "She is the child of Joachim and Anna of Bethlehem,
  of whom you have at least heard, for they were of great repute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," remarked the Rabbi, deferentially, "I know them. They were lineally
  descended from David. I knew them well."</p>

  <p>"Well, they are dead now," the Nazarene proceeded. "They died in Nazareth.
  Joachim was not rich, yet he left a house and garden to be divided between
  his daughters Marian and Mary. This is one of them; and to save her portion
  of the property, the law required her to marry her next of kin. She is now my
  wife."</p>

  <p>"And you were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Her uncle."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! And as you were both born in Bethlehem, the Roman compels you
  to take her there with you to be also counted."</p>

  <p>The Rabbi clasped his hands, and looked indignantly to heaven, exclaiming,
  "The God of Israel still lives! The vengeance is his!"</p>

  <p>With that he turned and abruptly departed. A stranger near by, observing
  Joseph's amazement, said, quietly, "Rabbi Samuel is a zealot. Judas himself
  is not more fierce."</p>

  <p>Joseph, not wishing to talk with the man, appeared not to hear, and busied
  himself gathering in a little heap the grass which the donkey had tossed
  abroad; after which he leaned upon his staff again, and waited.</p>

  <p>In another hour the party passed out the gate, and, turning to the left,
  took the road into Bethlehem. The descent into the valley of Hinnom was quite
  broken, garnished here and there with straggling wild olive-trees. Carefully,
  tenderly, the Nazarene walked by the woman's side, leading-strap in hand. On
  their left, reaching to the south and east round Mount Zion, rose the city
  wall, and on their right the steep prominences which form the western
  boundary of the valley.</p>

  <p>Slowly they passed the Lower Pool of Gihon, out of which the sun was fast
  driving the lessening shadow of the royal hill; slowly they proceeded,
  keeping parallel with the aqueduct from the Pools of Solomon, until near the
  site of the country-house on what is now called the Hill of Evil Counsel;
  there they began to ascend to the plain of Rephaim. The sun streamed garishly
  over the stony face of the famous locality, and under its influence Mary, the
  daughter of Joachim, dropped the wimple entirely, and bared her head. Joseph
  told the story of the Philistines surprised in their camp there by David. He
  was tedious in the narrative, speaking with the solemn countenance and
  lifeless manner of a dull man. She did not always hear him.</p>

  <p>Wherever on the land men go, and on the sea ships, the face and figure of
  the Jew are familiar. The physical type of the race has always been the same;
  yet there have been some individual variations. "Now he was ruddy, and withal
  of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to." Such was the son of Jesse
  when brought before Samuel. The fancies of men have been ever since ruled by
  the description. Poetic license has extended the peculiarities of the
  ancestor to his notable descendants. So all our ideal Solomons have fair
  faces, and hair and beard chestnut in the shade, and of the tint of gold in
  the sun. Such, we are also made believe, were the locks of Absalom the
  beloved. And, in the absence of authentic history, tradition has dealt no
  less lovingly by her whom we are now following down to the native city of the
  ruddy king.</p>

  <p>She was not more than fifteen. Her form, voice, and manner belonged to the
  period of transition from girlhood. Her face was perfectly oval, her
  complexion more pale than fair. The nose was faultless; the lips, slightly
  parted, were full and ripe, giving to the lines of the mouth warmth,
  tenderness, and trust; the eyes were blue and large, and shaded by drooping
  lids and long lashes; and, in harmony with all, a flood of golden hair, in
  the style permitted to Jewish brides, fell unconfined down her back to the
  pillion on which she sat. The throat and neck had the downy softness
  sometimes seen which leaves the artist in doubt whether it is an effect of
  contour or color. To these charms of feature and person were added others
  more indefinable&mdash;an air of purity which only the soul can impart, and
  of abstraction natural to such as think much of things impalpable. Often,
  with trembling lips, she raised her eyes to heaven, itself not more deeply
  blue; often she crossed her hands upon her breast, as in adoration and
  prayer; often she raised her head like one listening eagerly for a calling
  voice. Now and then, midst his slow utterances, Joseph turned to look at her,
  and, catching the expression kindling her face as with light, forgot his
  theme, and with bowed head, wondering, plodded on.</p>

  <p>So they skirted the great plain, and at length reached the elevation Mar
  Elias; from which, across a valley, they beheld Bethlehem, the old, old House
  of Bread, its white walls crowning a ridge, and shining above the brown
  scumbling of leafless orchards. They paused there, and rested, while Joseph
  pointed out the places of sacred renown; then they went down into the valley
  to the well which was the scene of one of the marvellous exploits of David's
  strong men. The narrow space was crowded with people and animals. A fear came
  upon Joseph&mdash;a fear lest, if the town were so thronged, there might not
  be house-room for the gentle Mary. Without delay, he hurried on, past the
  pillar of stone marking the tomb of Rachel, up the gardened slope, saluting
  none of the many persons he met on the way, until he stopped before the
  portal of the khan that then stood outside the village gates, near a junction
  of roads.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch109"
     name="ch109"></a>IX. &mdash; THE CAVE AT BETHLEHEM</h2>

  <p class="first">To understand thoroughly what happened to the Nazarene at
  the khan, the reader must be reminded that Eastern inns were different from
  the inns of the Western world. They were called khans, from the Persian, and,
  in simplest form, were fenced enclosures, without house or shed, often
  without a gate or entrance. Their sites were chosen with reference to shade,
  defence, or water. Such were the inns that sheltered Jacob when he went to
  seek a wife in Padan-Aram. Their like may been seen at this day in the
  stopping-places of the desert. On the other hand, some of them, especially
  those on the roads between great cities, like Jerusalem and Alexandria, were
  princely establishments, monuments to the piety of the kings who built them.
  In ordinary, however, they were no more than the house or possession of a
  sheik, in which, as in headquarters, he swayed his tribe. Lodging the
  traveller was the least of their uses; they were markets, factories, forts;
  places of assemblage and residence for merchants and artisans quite as much
  as places of shelter for belated and wandering wayfarers. Within their walls,
  all the year round, occurred the multiplied daily transactions of a town.</p>

  <p>The singular management of these hostelries was the feature likely to
  strike a Western mind with most force. There was no host or hostess; no
  clerk, cook, or kitchen; a steward at the gate was all the assertion of
  government or proprietorship anywhere visible. Strangers arriving stayed at
  will without rendering account. A consequence of the system was that whoever
  came had to bring his food and culinary outfit with him, or buy them of
  dealers in the khan. The same rule held good as to his bed and bedding, and
  forage for his beasts. Water, rest, shelter, and protection were all he
  looked for from the proprietor, and they were gratuities. The peace of
  synagogues was sometimes broken by brawling disputants, but that of the khans
  never. The houses and all their appurtenances were sacred: a well was not
  more so.</p>

  <p>The khan at Bethlehem, before which Joseph and his wife stopped, was a
  good specimen of its class, being neither very primitive nor very princely.
  The building was purely Oriental; that is to say, a quadrangular block of
  rough stones, one story high, flat-roofed, externally unbroken by a window,
  and with but one principal entrance&mdash;a doorway, which was also a
  gateway, on the eastern side, or front. The road ran by the door so near that
  the chalk dust half covered the lintel. A fence of flat rocks, beginning at
  the northeastern corner of the pile, extended many yards down the slope to a
  point from whence it swept westwardly to a limestone bluff; making what was
  in the highest degree essential to a respectable khan&mdash;a safe enclosure
  for animals.</p>

  <p>In a village like Bethlehem, as there was but one sheik, there could not
  well be more than one khan; and, though born in the place, the Nazarene, from
  long residence elsewhere, had no claim to hospitality in the town. Moreover,
  the enumeration for which he was coming might be the work of weeks or months;
  Roman deputies in the provinces were proverbially slow; and to impose himself
  and wife for a period so uncertain upon acquaintances or relations was out of
  the question. So, before he drew nigh the great house, while he was yet
  climbing the slope, in the steep places toiling to hasten the donkey, the
  fear that he might not find accommodations in the khan became a painful
  anxiety; for he found the road thronged with men and boys who, with great
  ado, were taking their cattle, horses, and camels to and from the valley,
  some to water, some to the neighboring caves. And when he was come close by,
  his alarm was not allayed by the discovery of a crowd investing the door of
  the establishment, while the enclosure adjoining, broad as it was, seemed
  already full.</p>

  <p>"We cannot reach the door," Joseph said, in his slow way. "Let us stop
  here, and learn, if we can, what has happened."</p>

  <p>The wife, without answering, quietly drew the wimple aside. The look of
  fatigue at first upon her face changed to one of interest. She found herself
  at the edge of an assemblage that could not be other than a matter of
  curiosity to her, although it was common enough at the khans on any of the
  highways which the great caravans were accustomed to traverse. There were men
  on foot, running hither and thither, talking shrilly and in all the tongues
  of Syria; men on horseback screaming to men on camels; men struggling
  doubtfully with fractious cows and frightened sheep; men peddling bread and
  wine; and among the mass a herd of boys apparently in chase of a herd of
  dogs. Everybody and everything seemed to be in motion at the same time.
  Possibly the fair spectator was too weary to be long attracted by the scene;
  in a little while she sighed, and settled down on the pillion, and, as if in
  search of peace and rest, or in expectation of some one, looked off to the
  south, and up to the tall cliffs of the Mount of Paradise, then faintly
  reddening under the setting sun.</p>

  <p>While she was thus looking, a man pushed his way out of the press, and,
  stopping close by the donkey, faced about with an angry brow. The Nazarene
  spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"As I am what I take you to be, good friend&mdash;a son of Judah&mdash;may
  I ask the cause of this multitude?"</p>

  <p>The stranger turned fiercely; but, seeing the solemn countenance of
  Joseph, so in keeping with his deep, slow voice and speech, he raised his
  hand in half-salutation, and replied,</p>

  <p>"Peace be to you, Rabbi! I am a son of Judah, and will answer you. I dwell
  in Beth-Dagon, which, you know, is in what used to be the land of the tribe
  of Dan."</p>

  <p>"On the road to Joppa from Modin," said Joseph.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have been in Beth-Dagon," the man said, his face softening yet
  more. "What wanderers we of Judah are! I have been away from the
  ridge&mdash;old Ephrath, as our father Jacob called it&mdash;for many years.
  When the proclamation went abroad requiring all Hebrews to be numbered at the
  cities of their birth&mdash; That is my business here, Rabbi."</p>

  <p>Joseph's face remained stolid as a mask, while he remarked, "I have come
  for that also&mdash;I and my wife."</p>

  <p>The stranger glanced at Mary and kept silence. She was looking up at the
  bald top of Gedor. The sun touched her upturned face, and filled the violet
  depths of her eyes, and upon her parted lips trembled an aspiration which
  could not have been to a mortal. For the moment, all the humanity of her
  beauty seemed refined away: she was as we fancy they are who sit close by the
  gate in the transfiguring light of Heaven. The Beth-Dagonite saw the original
  of what, centuries after, came as a vision of genius to Sanzio the divine,
  and left him immortal.</p>

  <p>"Of what was I speaking? Ah! I remember. I was about to say that when I
  heard of the order to come here, I was angry. Then I thought of the old hill,
  and the town, and the valley falling away into the depths of Cedron; of the
  vines and orchards, and fields of grain, unfailing since the days of Boaz and
  Ruth, of the familiar mountains&mdash;Gedor here, Gibeah yonder, Mar Elias
  there&mdash;which, when I was a boy, were the walls of the world to me; and I
  forgave the tyrants and came&mdash;I, and Rachel, my wife, and Deborah and
  Michal, our roses of Sharon."</p>

  <p>The man paused again, looking abruptly at Mary, who was now looking at him
  and listening. Then he said, "Rabbi, will not your wife go to mine? You may
  see her yonder with the children, under the leaning olive-tree at the bend of
  the road. I tell you"&mdash;he turned to Joseph and spoke positively&mdash;"I
  tell you the khan is full. It is useless to ask at the gate."</p>

  <p>Joseph's will was slow, like his mind; he hesitated, but at length
  replied, "The offer is kind. Whether there be room for us or not in the
  house, we will go see your people. Let me speak to the gate-keeper myself. I
  will return quickly."</p>

  <p>And, putting the leading-strap in the stranger's hand, he pushed into the
  stirring crowd.</p>

  <p>The keeper sat on a great cedar block outside the gate. Against the wall
  behind him leaned a javelin. A dog squatted on the block by his side.</p>

  <p>"The peace of Jehovah be with you," said Joseph, at last confronting the
  keeper.</p>

  <p>"What you give, may you find again; and, when found, be it many times
  multiplied to you and yours," returned the watchman, gravely, though without
  moving.</p>

  <p>"I am a Bethlehemite," said Joseph, in his most deliberate way. "Is there
  not room for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is not."</p>

  <p>"You may have heard of me&mdash;Joseph of Nazareth. This is the house of
  my fathers. I am of the line of David."</p>

  <p>These words held the Nazarene's hope. If they failed him, further appeal
  was idle, even that of the offer of many shekels. To be a son of Judah was
  one thing&mdash;in the tribal opinion a great thing; to be of the house of
  David was yet another; on the tongue of a Hebrew there could be no higher
  boast. A thousand years and more had passed since the boyish shepherd became
  the successor of Saul and founded a royal family. Wars, calamities, other
  kings, and the countless obscuring processes of time had, as respects
  fortune, lowered his descendants to the common Jewish level; the bread they
  ate came to them of toil never more humble; yet they had the benefit of
  history sacredly kept, of which genealogy was the first chapter and the last;
  they could not become unknown, while, wherever they went In Israel,
  acquaintance drew after it a respect amounting to reverence.</p>

  <p>If this were so in Jerusalem and elsewhere, certainly one of the sacred
  line might reasonably rely upon it at the door of the khan of Bethlehem. To
  say, as Joseph said, "This is the house of my fathers," was to say the truth
  most simply and literally; for it was the very house Ruth ruled as the wife
  of Boaz, the very house in which Jesse and his ten sons, David the youngest,
  were born, the very house in which Samuel came seeking a king, and found him;
  the very house which David gave to the son of Barzillai, the friendly
  Gileadite; the very house in which Jeremiah, by prayer, rescued the remnant
  of his race flying before the Babylonians.</p>

  <p>The appeal was not without effect. The keeper of the gate slid down from
  the cedar block, and, laying his hand upon his beard, said, respectfully,
  "Rabbi, I cannot tell you when this door first opened in welcome to the
  traveller, but it was more than a thousand years ago; and in all that time
  there is no known instance of a good man turned away, save when there was no
  room to rest him in. If it has been so with the stranger, just cause must the
  steward have who says no to one of the line of David. Wherefore, I salute you
  again; and, if you care to go with me, I will show you that there is not a
  lodging-place left in the house; neither in the chambers, nor in the lewens,
  nor in the court&mdash;not even on the roof. May I ask when you came?"</p>

  <p>"But now."</p>

  <p>The keeper smiled.</p>

  <p>"'The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be as one born among you, and
  thou shalt love him as thyself.' Is not that the law, Rabbi?"</p>

  <p>Joseph was silent.</p>

  <p>"If it be the law, can I say to one a long time come, 'Go thy way; another
  is here to take thy place?'"</p>

  <p>Yet Joseph held his peace.</p>

  <p>"And, if I said so, to whom would the place belong? See the many that have
  been waiting, some of them since noon."</p>

  <p>"Who are all these people?" asked Joseph, turning to the crowd. "And why
  are they here at this time?"</p>

  <p>"That which doubtless brought you, Rabbi&mdash;the decree of the
  Caesar"&mdash;the keeper threw an interrogative glance at the Nazarene, then
  continued&mdash;"brought most of those who have lodging in the house. And
  yesterday the caravan passing from Damascus to Arabia and Lower Egypt
  arrived. These you see here belong to it&mdash;men and camels."</p>

  <p>Still Joseph persisted.</p>

  <p>"The court is large," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it is heaped with cargoes&mdash;with bales of silk, and pockets
  of spices, and goods of every kind."</p>

  <p>Then for a moment the face of the applicant lost its stolidity; the
  lustreless, staring eyes dropped. With some warmth he next said, "I do not
  care for myself, but I have with me my wife, and the night is
  cold&mdash;colder on these heights than in Nazareth. She cannot live in the
  open air. Is there not room in the town?"</p>

  <p>"These people"&mdash;the keeper waved his hand to the throng before the
  door&mdash;"have all besought the town, and they report its accommodations
  all engaged."</p>

  <p>Again Joseph studied the ground, saying, half to himself, "She is so
  young! if I make her bed on the hill, the frosts will kill her."</p>

  <p>Then he spoke to the keeper again.</p>

  <p>"It may be you knew her parents, Joachim and Anna, once of Bethlehem, and,
  like myself, of the line of David."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew them. They were good people. That was in my youth."</p>

  <p>This time the keeper's eyes sought the ground in thought. Suddenly he
  raised his head.</p>

  <p>"If I cannot make room for you," he said, "I cannot turn you away. Rabbi,
  I will do the best I can for you. How many are of your party?"</p>

  <p>Joseph reflected, then replied, "My wife and a friend with his family,
  from Beth-Dagon, a little town over by Joppa; in all, six of us."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You shall not lie out on the ridge. Bring your people, and
  hasten; for, when the sun goes down behind the mountain, you know the night
  comes quickly, and it is nearly there now."</p>

  <p>"I give you the blessing of the houseless traveller; that of the sojourner
  will follow."</p>

  <p>So saying, the Nazarene went back joyfully to Mary and the Beth-Dagonite.
  In a little while the latter brought up his family, the women mounted on
  donkeys. The wife was matronly, the daughters were images of what she must
  have been in youth; and as they drew nigh the door, the keeper knew them to
  be of the humble class.</p>

  <p>"This is she of whom I spoke," said the Nazarene; "and these are our
  friends."</p>

  <p>Mary's veil was raised.</p>

  <p>"Blue eyes and hair of gold," muttered the steward to himself, seeing but
  her. "So looked the young king when he went to sing before Saul."</p>

  <p>Then he took the leading-strap from Joseph, and said to Mary, "Peace to
  you, O daughter of David!" Then to the others, "Peace to you all!" Then to
  Joseph, "Rabbi, follow me."</p>

  <p>The party were conducted into a wide passage paved with stone, from which
  they entered the court of the khan. To a stranger the scene would have been
  curious; but they noticed the lewens that yawned darkly upon them from all
  sides, and the court itself, only to remark how crowded they were. By a lane
  reserved in the stowage of the cargoes, and thence by a passage similar to
  the one at the entrance, they emerged into the enclosure adjoining the house,
  and came upon camels, horses, and donkeys, tethered and dozing in close
  groups; among them were the keepers, men of many lands; and they, too, slept
  or kept silent watch. They went down the slope of the crowded yard slowly,
  for the dull carriers of the women had wills of their own. At length they
  turned into a path running towards the gray limestone bluff overlooking the
  khan on the west.</p>

  <p>"We are going to the cave," said Joseph, laconically.</p>

  <p>The guide lingered till Mary came to his side.</p>

  <p>"The cave to which we are going," he said to her, "must have been a resort
  of your ancestor David. From the field below us, and from the well down in
  the valley, he used to drive his flocks to it for safety; and afterwards,
  when he was king, he came back to the old house here for rest and health,
  bringing great trains of animals. The mangers yet remain as they were in his
  day. Better a bed on the floor where he has slept than one in the court-yard
  or out by the roadside. Ah, here is the house before the cave!"</p>

  <p>This speech must not be taken as an apology for the lodging offered. There
  was no need of apology. The place was the best then at disposal. The guests
  were simple folks, by habits of life easily satisfied. To the Jew of that
  period, moreover, abode in caverns was a familiar idea, made so by every-day
  occurrences, and by what he heard of Sabbaths in the synagogues. How much of
  Jewish history, how many of the many exciting incidents in that history, had
  transpired in caves! Yet further, these people were Jews of Bethlehem, with
  whom the idea was especially commonplace; for their locality abounded with
  caves great and small, some of which had been dwelling-places from the time
  of the Emim and Horites. No more was there offence to them in the fact that
  the cavern to which they were being taken had been, or was, a stable. They
  were the descendants of a race of herdsmen, whose flocks habitually shared
  both their habitations and wanderings. In keeping with a custom derived from
  Abraham, the tent of the Bedawin yet shelters his horses and children alike.
  So they obeyed the keeper cheerfully, and gazed at the house, feeling only a
  natural curiosity. Everything associated with the history of David was
  interesting to them.</p>

  <p>The building was low and narrow, projecting but a little from the rock to
  which it was joined at the rear, and wholly without a window. In its blank
  front there was a door, swung on enormous hinges, and thickly daubed with
  ochreous clay. While the wooden bolt of the lock was being pushed back, the
  women were assisted from their pillions. Upon the opening of the door, the
  keeper called out,</p>

  <p>"Come in!"</p>

  <p>The guests entered, and stared about them. It became apparent immediately
  that the house was but a mask or covering for the mouth of a natural cave or
  grotto, probably forty feet long, nine or ten high, and twelve or fifteen in
  width. The light streamed through the doorway, over an uneven floor, falling
  upon piles of grain and fodder, and earthenware and household property,
  occupying the centre of the chamber. Along the sides were mangers, low enough
  for sheep, and built of stones laid in cement. There were no stalls or
  partitions of any kind. Dust and chaff yellowed the floor, filled all the
  crevices and hollows, and thickened the spider-webs, which dropped from the
  ceiling like bits of dirty linen; otherwise the place was cleanly, and, to
  appearance, as comfortable as any of the arched lewens of the khan proper. In
  fact, a cave was the model and first suggestion of the lewen.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" said the guide. "These piles upon the floor are for travellers
  like yourselves. Take what of them you need."</p>

  <p>Then he spoke to Mary.</p>

  <p>"Can you rest here?"</p>

  <p>"The place is sanctified," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I leave you then. Peace be with you all!"</p>

  <p>When he was gone, they busied themselves making the cave habitable.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch110"
     name="ch110"></a>X.. &mdash; THE LIGHT IN THE SKY</h2>

  <p class="first">At a certain hour in the evening the shouting and stir of
  the people in and about the khan ceased; at the same time, every Israelite,
  if not already upon his feet, arose, solemnized his face, looked towards
  Jerusalem, crossed his hands upon his breast, and prayed; for it was the
  sacred ninth hour, when sacrifices were offered in the temple on Moriah, and
  God was supposed to be there. When the hands of the worshippers fell down,
  the commotion broke forth again; everybody hastened to bread, or to make his
  pallet. A little later, the lights were put out, and there was silence, and
  then sleep.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">About midnight some one on the roof cried out, "What light
  is that in the sky? Awake, brethren, awake and see!"</p>

  <p>The people, half asleep, sat up and looked; then they became wide-awake,
  though wonder-struck. And the stir spread to the court below, and into the
  lewens; soon the entire tenantry of the house and court and enclosure were
  out gazing at the sky.</p>

  <p>And this was what they saw. A ray of light, beginning at a height
  immeasurably beyond the nearest stars, and dropping obliquely to the earth;
  at its top, a diminishing point; at its base, many furlongs in width; its
  sides blending softly with the darkness of the night, its core a roseate
  electrical splendor. The apparition seemed to rest on the nearest mountain
  southeast of the town, making a pale corona along the line of the summit. The
  khan was touched luminously, so that those upon the roof saw each other's
  faces, all filled with wonder.</p>

  <p>Steadily, through minutes, the ray lingered, and then the wonder changed
  to awe and fear; the timid trembled; the boldest spoke in whispers.</p>

  <p>"Saw you ever the like?" asked one.</p>

  <p>"It seems just over the mountain there. I cannot tell what it is, nor did
  I ever see anything like it," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Can it be that a star has burst and fallen?" asked another, his tongue
  faltering.</p>

  <p>"When a star falls, its light goes out."</p>

  <p>"I have it!" cried one, confidently. "The shepherds have seen a lion, and
  made fires to keep him from the flocks."</p>

  <p>The men next the speaker drew a breath of relief, and said, "Yes, that is
  it! The flocks were grazing in the valley over there to-day."</p>

  <p>A bystander dispelled the comfort.</p>

  <p>"No, no! Though all the wood in all the valleys of Judah was brought
  together in one pile and fired, the blaze would not throw a light so strong
  and high."</p>

  <p>After that there was silence on the house-top, broken but once again while
  the mystery continued.</p>

  <p>"Brethren!" exclaimed a Jew of venerable mien, "what we see is the ladder
  our father Jacob saw in his dream. Blessed be the Lord God of our
  fathers!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch111"
     name="ch111"></a>XI. &mdash; CHRIST IS BORN</h2>

  <p class="first">A mile and a half, it may be two miles, southeast of
  Bethlehem, there is a plain separated from the town by an intervening swell
  of the mountain. Besides being well sheltered from the north winds, the vale
  was covered with a growth of sycamore, dwarf-oak, and pine trees, while in
  the glens and ravines adjoining there were thickets of olive and mulberry;
  all at this season of the year invaluable for the support of sheep, goats,
  and cattle, of which the wandering flocks consisted.</p>

  <p>At the side farthest from the town, close under a bluff, there was an
  extensive marah, or sheepcot, ages old. In some long-forgotten foray, the
  building had been unroofed and almost demolished. The enclosure attached to
  it remained intact, however, and that was of more importance to the shepherds
  who drove their charges thither than the house itself. The stone wall around
  the lot was high as a man's head, yet not so high but that sometimes a
  panther or a lion, hungering from the wilderness, leaped boldly in. On the
  inner side of the wall, and as an additional security against the constant
  danger, a hedge of the rhamnus had been planted, an invention so successful
  that now a sparrow could hardly penetrate the overtopping branches, armed as
  they were with great clusters of thorns hard as spikes.</p>

  <p>The day of the occurrences which occupy the preceding chapters, a number
  of shepherds, seeking fresh walks for their flocks, led them up to this
  plain; and from early morning the groves had been made ring with calls, and
  the blows of axes, the bleating of sheep and goats, the tinkling of bells,
  the lowing of cattle, and the barking of dogs. When the sun went down, they
  led the way to the marah, and by nightfall had everything safe in the field;
  then they kindled a fire down by the gate, partook of their humble supper,
  and sat down to rest and talk, leaving one on watch.</p>

  <p>There were six of these men, omitting the watchman; and afterwhile they
  assembled in a group near the fire, some sitting, some lying prone. As they
  went bareheaded habitually, their hair stood out in thick, coarse, sunburnt
  shocks; their beard covered their throats, and fell in mats down the breast;
  mantles of the skin of kids and lambs, with the fleece on, wrapped them from
  neck to knee, leaving the arms exposed; broad belts girthed the rude garments
  to their waists; their sandals were of the coarsest quality; from their right
  shoulders hung scrips containing food and selected stones for slings, with
  which they were armed; on the ground near each one lay his crook, a symbol of
  his calling and a weapon of offence.</p>

  <p>Such were the shepherds of Judea! In appearance, rough and savage as the
  gaunt dogs sitting with them around the blaze; in fact, simple-minded,
  tender-hearted; effects due, in part, to the primitive life they led, but
  chiefly to their constant care of things lovable and helpless.</p>

  <p>They rested and talked, and their talk was all about their flocks, a dull
  theme to the world, yet a theme which was all the world to them. If in
  narrative they dwelt long upon affairs of trifling moment; if one of them
  omitted nothing of detail in recounting the loss of a lamb, the relation
  between him and the unfortunate should be remembered: at birth it became his
  charge, his to keep all its days, to help over the floods, to carry down the
  hollows, to name and train; it was to be his companion, his object of thought
  and interest, the subject of his will; it was to enliven and share his
  wanderings; in its defense he might be called on to face the lion or
  robber&mdash;to die.</p>

  <p>The great events, such as blotted out nations and changed the mastery of
  the world, were trifles to them, if perchance they came to their knowledge.
  Of what Herod was doing in this city or that, building palaces and gymnasia,
  and indulging forbidden practises, they occasionally heard. As was her habit
  in those days, Rome did not wait for people slow to inquire about her; she
  came to them. Over the hills along which he was leading his lagging herd, or
  in the fastnesses in which he was hiding them, not unfrequently the shepherd
  was startled by the blare of trumpets, and, peering out, beheld a cohort,
  sometimes a legion, in march; and when the glittering crests were gone, and
  the excitement incident to the intrusion over, he bent himself to evolve the
  meaning of the eagles and gilded globes of the soldiery, and the charm of a
  life so the opposite of his own.</p>

  <p>Yet these men, rude and simple as they were, had a knowledge and a wisdom
  of their own. On Sabbaths they were accustomed to purify themselves, and go
  up into the synagogues, and sit on the benches farthest from the ark. When
  the chazzan bore the Torah round, none kissed it with greater zest; when the
  sheliach read the text, none listened to the interpreter with more absolute
  faith; and none took away with them more of the elder's sermon, or gave it
  more thought afterwards. In a verse of the Shema they found all the learning
  and all the law of their simple lives&mdash;that their Lord was One God, and
  that they must love him with all their souls. And they loved him, and such
  was their wisdom, surpassing that of kings.</p>

  <p>While they talked, and before the first watch was over, one by one the
  shepherds went to sleep, each lying where he had sat.</p>

  <p>The night, like most nights of the winter season in the hill country, was
  clear, crisp, and sparkling with stars. There was no wind. The atmosphere
  seemed never so pure, and the stillness was more than silence; it was a holy
  hush, a warning that heaven was stooping low to whisper some good thing to
  the listening earth.</p>

  <p>By the gate, hugging his mantle close, the watchman walked; at times he
  stopped, attracted by a stir among the sleeping herds, or by a jackal's cry
  off on the mountain-side. The midnight was slow coming to him; but at last it
  came. His task was done; now for the dreamless sleep with which labor blesses
  its wearied children! He moved towards the fire, but paused; a light was
  breaking around him, soft and white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly.
  The light deepened; things before invisible came to view; he saw the whole
  field, and all it sheltered. A chill sharper than that of the frosty
  air&mdash;a chill of fear&mdash;smote him. He looked up; the stars were gone;
  the light was dropping as from a window in the sky; as he looked, it became a
  splendor; then, in terror, he cried,</p>

  <p>"Awake, awake!"</p>

  <p>Up sprang the dogs, and, howling, ran away.</p>

  <p>The herds rushed together bewildered.</p>

  <p>The men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" they asked, in one voice.</p>

  <p>"See!" cried the watchman, "the sky is on fire!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the light became intolerably bright, and they covered their eyes,
  and dropped upon their knees; then, as their souls shrank with fear, they
  fell upon their faces blind and fainting, and would have died had not a voice
  said to them,</p>

  <p>"Fear not!"</p>

  <p>And they listened.</p>

  <p>"Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall
  be to all people."</p>

  <p>The voice, in sweetness and soothing more than human, and low and clear,
  penetrated all their being, and filled them with assurance. They rose upon
  their knees, and, looking worshipfully, beheld in the centre of a great glory
  the appearance of a man, clad in a robe intensely white; above its shoulders
  towered the tops of wings shining and folded; a star over its forehead glowed
  with steady lustre, brilliant as Hesperus; its hands were stretched towards
  them in blessing; its face was serene and divinely beautiful.</p>

  <p>They had often heard, and, in their simple way, talked, of angels; and
  they doubted not now, but said, in their hearts, The glory of God is about
  us, and this is he who of old came to the prophet by the river of Ulai.</p>

  <p>Directly the angel continued:</p>

  <p>"For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is
  Christ the Lord!"</p>

  <p>Again there was a rest, while the words sank into their minds.</p>

  <p>"And this shall be a sign unto you," the annunciator said next. "Ye shall
  find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger."</p>

  <p>The herald spoke not again; his good tidings were told; yet he stayed
  awhile. Suddenly the light, of which he seemed the centre, turned roseate and
  began to tremble; then up, far as the men could see, there was flashing of
  white wings, and coming and going of radiant forms, and voices as of a
  multitude chanting in unison,</p>

  <p>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards
  men!"</p>

  <p>Not once the praise, but many times.</p>

  <p>Then the herald raised his eyes as seeking approval of one far off; his
  wings stirred, and spread slowly and majestically, on their upper side white
  as snow, in the shadow vari-tinted, like mother-of-pearl; when they were
  expanded many cubits beyond his stature, he arose lightly, and, without
  effort, floated out of view, taking the light up with him. Long after he was
  gone, down from the sky fell the refrain in measure mellowed by distance,
  "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men."</p>

  <p>When the shepherds came fully to their senses, they stared at each other
  stupidly, until one of them said, "It was Gabriel, the Lord's messenger unto
  men."</p>

  <p>None answered.</p>

  <p>"Christ the Lord is born; said he not so?"</p>

  <p>Then another recovered his voice, and replied, "That is what he said."</p>

  <p>"And did he not also say, in the city of David, which is our Bethlehem
  yonder. And that we should find him a babe in swaddling-clothes?"</p>

  <p>"And lying in a manger."</p>

  <p>The first speaker gazed into the fire thoughtfully, but at length said,
  like one possessed of a sudden resolve, "There is but one place in Bethlehem
  where there are mangers; but one, and that is in the cave near the old khan.
  Brethren, let us go see this thing which has come to pass. The priests and
  doctors have been a long time looking for the Christ. Now he is born, and the
  Lord has given us a sign by which to know him. Let us go up and worship
  him."</p>

  <p>"But the flocks!"</p>

  <p>"The Lord will take care of them. Let us make haste."</p>

  <p>Then they all arose and left the marah.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Around the mountain and through the town they passed, and
  came to the gate of the khan, where there was a man on watch.</p>

  <p>"What would you have?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We have seen and heard great things to-night," they replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, we, too, have seen great things, but heard nothing. What did you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go down to the cave in the enclosure, that we may be sure; then we
  will tell you all. Come with us, and see for yourself."</p>

  <p>"It is a fool's errand."</p>

  <p>"No, the Christ is born."</p>

  <p>"The Christ! How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go and see first."</p>

  <p>The man laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"The Christ indeed! How are you to know him?"</p>

  <p>"He was born this night, and is now lying in a manger, so we were told;
  and there is but one place in Bethlehem with mangers."</p>

  <p>"The cave?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Come with us."</p>

  <p>They went through the court-yard without notice, although there were some
  up even then talking about the wonderful light. The door of the cavern was
  open. A lantern was burning within, and they entered unceremoniously.</p>

  <p>"I give you peace," the watchman said to Joseph and the Beth Dagonite.
  "Here are people looking for a child born this night, whom they are to know
  by finding him in swaddling-clothes and lying in a manger."</p>

  <p>For a moment the face of the stolid Nazarene was moved; turning away, he
  said, "The child is here."</p>

  <p>They were led to one of the mangers, and there the child was. The lantern
  was brought, and the shepherds stood by mute. The little one made no sign; it
  was as others just born.</p>

  <p>"Where is the mother?" asked the watchman.</p>

  <p>One of the women took the baby, and went to Mary, lying near, and put it
  in her arms. Then the bystanders collected about the two.</p>

  <p>"It is the Christ!" said a shepherd, at last.</p>

  <p>"The Christ!" they all repeated, falling upon their knees in worship. One
  of them repeated several times over,</p>

  <p>"It is the Lord, and his glory is above the earth and heaven."</p>

  <p>And the simple men, never doubting, kissed the hem of the mother's robe,
  and with joyful faces departed. In the khan, to all the people aroused and
  pressing about them, they told their story; and through the town, and all the
  way back to the marah, they chanted the refrain of the angels, "Glory to God
  in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!"</p>

  <p>The story went abroad, confirmed by the light so generally seen; and the
  next day, and for days thereafter, the cave was visited by curious crowds, of
  whom some believed, though the greater part laughed and mocked.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch112"
     name="ch112"></a>XII. &mdash; THE WISE MEN ARRIVE AT JERUSALEM</h2>

  <p class="first">The eleventh day after the birth of the child in the cave,
  about mid-afternoon, the three wise men approached Jerusalem by the road from
  Shechem. After crossing Brook Cedron, they met many people, of whom none
  failed to stop and look after them curiously.</p>

  <p>Judea was of necessity an international thoroughfare; a narrow ridge,
  raised, apparently, by the pressure of the desert on the east, and the sea on
  the west, was all she could claim to be; over the ridge, however, nature had
  stretched the line of trade between the east and the south; and that was her
  wealth. In other words, the riches of Jerusalem were the tolls she levied on
  passing commerce. Nowhere else, consequently, unless in Rome, was there such
  constant assemblage of so many people of so many different nations; in no
  other city was a stranger less strange to the residents than within her walls
  and purlieus. And yet these three men excited the wonder of all whom they met
  on the way to the gates.</p>

  <p>A child belonging to some women sitting by the roadside opposite the Tombs
  of the Kings saw the party coming; immediately it clapped its hands, and
  cried, "Look, look! What pretty bells! What big camels!"</p>

  <p>The bells were silver; the camels, as we have seen, were of unusual size
  and whiteness, and moved with singular stateliness; the trappings told of the
  desert and of long journeys thereon, and also of ample means in possession of
  the owners, who sat under the little canopies exactly as they appeared at the
  rendezvous beyond the Jebel. Yet it was not the bells or the camels, or their
  furniture, or the demeanor of the riders, that were so wonderful; it was the
  question put by the man who rode foremost of the three.</p>

  <p>The approach to Jerusalem from the north is across a plain which dips
  southward, leaving the Damascus Gate in a vale or hollow. The road is narrow,
  but deeply cut by long use, and in places difficult on account of the cobbles
  left loose and dry by the washing of the rains. On either side, however,
  there stretched, in the old time, rich fields and handsome olive-groves,
  which must, in luxurious growth, have been beautiful, especially to
  travellers fresh from the wastes of the desert. In this road, the three
  stopped before the party in front of the Tombs.</p>

  <p>"Good people," said Balthasar, stroking his plaited beard, and bending
  from his cot, "is not Jerusalem close by?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the woman into whose arms the child had shrunk. "If the
  trees on yon swell were a little lower you could see the towers on the
  market-place."</p>

  <p>Balthasar gave the Greek and the Hindoo a look, then asked,</p>

  <p>"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"</p>

  <p>The women gazed at each other without reply.</p>

  <p>"You have not heard of him?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell everybody that we have seen his star in the east, and are come
  to worship him."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the friends rode on. Of others they asked the same question,
  with like result. A large company whom they met going to the Grotto of
  Jeremiah were so astonished by the inquiry and the appearance of the
  travellers that they turned about and followed them into the city.</p>

  <p>So much were the three occupied with the idea of their mission that they
  did not care for the view which presently rose before them in the utmost
  magnificence: for the village first to receive them on Bezetha; for Mizpah
  and Olivet, over on their left; for the wall behind the village, with its
  forty tall and solid towers, superadded partly for strength, partly to
  gratify the critical taste of the kingly builder; for the same towered wall
  bending off to the right, with many an angle, and here and there an embattled
  gate, up to the three great white piles Phasaelus, Mariamne, and Hippicus;
  for Zion, tallest of the hills, crowned with marble palaces, and never so
  beautiful; for the glittering terraces of the temple on Moriah, admittedly
  one of the wonders of the earth; for the regal mountains rimming the sacred
  city round about until it seemed in the hollow of a mighty bowl.</p>

  <p>They came, at length, to a tower of great height and strength, overlooking
  the gate which, at that time, answered to the present Damascus Gate, and
  marked the meeting-place of the three roads from Shechem, Jericho, and
  Gibeon. A Roman guard kept the passage-way. By this time the people following
  the camels formed a train sufficient to draw the idlers hanging about the
  portal; so that when Balthasar stopped to speak to the sentinel, the three
  became instantly the centre of a close circle eager to hear all that
  passed.</p>

  <p>"I give you peace," the Egyptian said, in a clear voice.</p>

  <p>The sentinel made no reply.</p>

  <p>"We have come great distances in search of one who is born King of the
  Jews. Can you tell us where he is?"</p>

  <p>The soldier raised the visor of his helmet, and called loudly. From an
  apartment at the right of the passage an officer appeared.</p>

  <p>"Give way," he cried, to the crowd which now pressed closer in; and as
  they seemed slow to obey, he advanced twirling his javelin vigorously, now
  right, now left; and so he gained room.</p>

  <p>"What would you?" he asked of Balthasar, speaking in the idiom of the
  city.</p>

  <p>And Balthasar answered in the same,</p>

  <p>"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"</p>

  <p>"Herod?" asked the officer, confounded.</p>

  <p>"Herod's kingship is from Caesar; not Herod."</p>

  <p>"There is no other King of the Jews."</p>

  <p>"But we have seen the star of him we seek, and come to worship him."</p>

  <p>The Roman was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Go farther," he said, at last. "Go farther. I am not a Jew. Carry the
  question to the doctors in the Temple, or to Hannas the priest, or, better
  still, to Herod himself. If there be another King of the Jews, he will find
  him."</p>

  <p>Thereupon he made way for the strangers, and they passed the gate. But,
  before entering the narrow street, Balthasar lingered to say to his friends,
  "We are sufficiently proclaimed. By midnight the whole city will have heard
  of us and of our mission. Let us to the khan now."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch113"
     name="ch113"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE WITNESSES BEFORE HEROD</h2>

  <p class="first">That evening, before sunset, some women were washing clothes
  on the upper step of the flight that led down into the basin of the Pool of
  Siloam. They knelt each before a broad bowl of earthenware. A girl at the
  foot of the steps kept them supplied with water, and sang while she filled
  the jar. The song was cheerful, and no doubt lightened their labor.
  Occasionally they would sit upon their heels, and look up the slope of Ophel,
  and round to the summit of what is now the Mount of Offence, then faintly
  glorified by the dying sun.</p>

  <p>While they plied their hands, rubbing and wringing the clothes in the
  bowls, two other women came to them, each with an empty jar upon her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you," one of the new-comers said.</p>

  <p>The laborers paused, sat up, wrung the water from their hands, and
  returned the salutation.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly night&mdash;time to quit."</p>

  <p>"There is no end to work," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"But there is a time to rest, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To hear what may be passing," interposed another.</p>

  <p>"What news have you?"</p>

  <p>"Then you have not heard?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"They say the Christ is born," said the newsmonger, plunging into her
  story.</p>

  <p>It was curious to see the faces of the laborers brighten with interest; on
  the other side down came the jars, which, in a moment, were turned into seats
  for their owners.</p>

  <p>"The Christ!" the listeners cried.</p>

  <p>"So they say."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody; it is common talk."</p>

  <p>"Does anybody believe it?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon three men came across Brook Cedron on the road from
  Shechem," the speaker replied, circumstantially, intending to smother doubt.
  "Each one of them rode a camel spotless white, and larger than any ever
  before seen in Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>The eyes and mouths of the auditors opened wide.</p>

  <p>"To prove how great and rich the men were," the narrator continued, "they
  sat under awnings of silk; the buckles of their saddles were of gold, as was
  the fringe of their bridles; the bells were of silver, and made real music.
  Nobody knew them; they looked as if they had come from the ends of the world.
  Only one of them spoke, and of everybody on the road, even the women and
  children, he asked this question&mdash;'Where is he that is born King of the
  Jews?' No one gave them answer&mdash;no one understood what they meant; so
  they passed on, leaving behind them this saying: 'For we have seen his star
  in the east, and are come to worship him.' They put the question to the Roman
  at the gate; and he, no wiser than the simple people on the road, sent them
  up to Herod."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"At the khan. Hundreds have been to look at them already, and hundreds
  more are going."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody knows. They are said to be Persians&mdash;wise men who talk with
  the stars&mdash;prophets, it may be, like Elijah and Jeremiah."</p>

  <p>"What do they mean by King of the Jews?"</p>

  <p>"The Christ, and that he is just born."</p>

  <p>One of the women laughed, and resumed her work, saying, "Well, when I see
  him I will believe."</p>

  <p>Another followed her example: "And I&mdash;well, when I see him raise the
  dead, I will believe."</p>

  <p>A third said, quietly, "He has been a long time promised. It will be
  enough for me to see him heal one leper."</p>

  <p>And the party sat talking until the night came, and, with the help of the
  frosty air, drove them home.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later in the evening, about the beginning of the first
  watch, there was an assemblage in the palace on Mount Zion, of probably fifty
  persons, who never came together except by order of Herod, and then only when
  he had demanded to know some one or more of the deeper mysteries of the
  Jewish law and history. It was, in short, a meeting of the teachers of the
  colleges, of the chief priests, and of the doctors most noted in the city for
  learning&mdash;the leaders of opinion, expounders of the different creeds;
  princes of the Sadducees; Pharisaic debaters; calm, soft-spoken, stoical
  philosophers of the Essene socialists.</p>

  <p>The chamber in which the session was held belonged to one of the interior
  court-yards of the palace, and was quite large and Romanesque. The floor was
  tessellated with marble blocks; the walls, unbroken by a window, were
  frescoed in panels of saffron yellow; a divan occupied the centre of the
  apartment, covered with cushions of bright-yellow cloth, and fashioned in
  form of the letter U, the opening towards the doorway; in the arch of the
  divan, or, as it were, in the bend of the letter, there was an immense bronze
  tripod, curiously inlaid with gold and silver, over which a chandelier
  dropped from the ceiling, having seven arms, each holding a lighted lamp. The
  divan and the lamp were purely Jewish.</p>

  <p>The company sat upon the divan after the style of Orientals, in costume
  singularly uniform, except as to color. They were mostly men advanced in
  years; immense beards covered their faces; to their large noses were added
  the effects of large black eyes, deeply shaded by bold brows; their demeanor
  was grave, dignified, even patriarchal. In brief, their session was that of
  the Sanhedrim.</p>

  <p>He who sat before the tripod, however, in the place which may be called
  the head of the divan, having all the rest of his associates on his right and
  left, and, at the same time, before him, evidently president of the meeting,
  would have instantly absorbed the attention of a spectator. He had been cast
  in large mould, but was now shrunken and stooped to ghastliness; his white
  robe dropped from his shoulders in folds that gave no hint of muscle or
  anything but an angular skeleton. His hands, half concealed by sleeves of
  silk, white and crimson striped, were clasped upon his knees. When he spoke,
  sometimes the first finger of the right hand extended tremulously; he seemed
  incapable of other gesture. But his head was a splendid dome. A few hairs,
  whiter than fine-drawn silver, fringed the base; over a broad, full-sphered
  skull the skin was drawn close, and shone in the light with positive
  brilliance; the temples were deep hollows, from which the forehead beetled
  like a wrinkled crag; the eyes were wan and dim; the nose was pinched; and
  all the lower face was muffed in a beard flowing and venerable as Aaron's.
  Such was Hillel the Babylonian! The line of prophets, long extinct in Israel,
  was now succeeded by a line of scholars, of whom he was first in
  learning&mdash;a prophet in all but the divine inspiration! At the age of one
  hundred and six, he was still Rector of the Great College.</p>

  <p>On the table before him lay outspread a roll or volume of parchment
  inscribed with Hebrew characters; behind him, in waiting, stood a page richly
  habited.</p>

  <p>There had been discussion, but at this moment of introduction the company
  had reached a conclusion; each one was in an attitude of rest, and the
  venerable Hillel, without moving, called the page.</p>

  <p>"Hist!"</p>

  <p>The youth advanced respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Go tell the king we are ready to give him answer."</p>

  <p>The boy hurried away.</p>

  <p>After a time two officers entered and stopped, one on each side the door;
  after them slowly followed a most striking personage&mdash;an old man clad in
  a purple robe bordered with scarlet, and girt to his waist by a band of gold
  linked so fine that it was pliable as leather; the latchets of his shoes
  sparkled with precious stones; a narrow crown wrought in filigree shone
  outside a tarbooshe of softest crimson plush, which, encasing his head, fell
  down the neck and shoulders, leaving the throat and neck exposed. Instead of
  a seal, a dagger dangled from his belt. He walked with a halting step,
  leaning heavily upon a staff. Not until he reached the opening of the divan,
  did he pause or look up from the floor; then, as for the first time conscious
  of the company, and roused by their presence, he raised himself, and looked
  haughtily round, like one startled and searching for an enemy&mdash;so dark,
  suspicious, and threatening was the glance. Such was Herod the Great&mdash;a
  body broken by diseases, a conscience seared with crimes, a mind
  magnificently capable, a soul fit for brotherhood with the Caesars; now
  seven-and-sixty years old, but guarding his throne with a jealousy never so
  vigilant, a power never so despotic, and a cruelty never so inexorable.</p>

  <p>There was a general movement on the part of the assemblage&mdash;a bending
  forward in salaam by the more aged, a rising-up by the more courtierly,
  followed by low genuflections, hands upon the beard or breast.</p>

  <p>His observations taken, Herod moved on until at the tripod opposite the
  venerable Hillel, who met his cold glance with an inclination of the head,
  and a slight lifting of the hands.</p>

  <p>"The answer!" said the king, with imperious simplicity, addressing Hillel,
  and planting his staff before him with both hands. "The answer!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the patriarch glowed mildly, and, raising his head, and
  looking the inquisitor full in the face, he answered, his associates giving
  him closest attention,</p>

  <p>"With thee, O king, be the peace of God, of Abraham, Isaac, and
  Jacob!"</p>

  <p>His manner was that of invocation; changing it, he resumed:</p>

  <p>"Thou hast demanded of us where the Christ should be born."</p>

  <p>The king bowed, though the evil eyes remained fixed upon the sage's
  face.</p>

  <p>"That is the question."</p>

  <p>"Then, O king, speaking for myself, and all my brethren here, not one
  dissenting, I say, in Bethlehem of Judea."</p>

  <p>Hillel glanced at the parchment on the tripod; and, pointing with his
  tremulous finger, continued, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written
  by the prophet, 'And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, art not the least
  among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come a governor that shall
  rule my people Israel.'"</p>

  <p>Herod's face was troubled, and his eyes fell upon the parchment while he
  thought. Those beholding him scarcely breathed; they spoke not, nor did he.
  At length he turned about and left the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Brethren," said Hillel, "we are dismissed."</p>

  <p>The company then arose, and in groups departed.</p>

  <p>"Simeon," said Hillel again.</p>

  <p>A man, quite fifty years old, but in the hearty prime of life, answered
  and came to him.</p>

  <p>"Take up the sacred parchment, my son; roll it tenderly."</p>

  <p>The order was obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Now lend me thy arm; I will to the litter."</p>

  <p>The strong man stooped; with his withered hands the old one took the
  offered support, and, rising, moved feebly to the door.</p>

  <p>So departed the famous Rector, and Simeon, his son, who was to be his
  successor in wisdom, learning, and office.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Yet later in the evening the wise men were lying in a lewen
  of the khan awake. The stones which served them as pillows raised their heads
  so they could look out of the open arch into the depths of the sky; and as
  they watched the twinkling of the stars, they thought of the next
  manifestation. How would it come? What would it be? They were in Jerusalem at
  last; they had asked at the gate for Him they sought; they had borne witness
  of his birth; it remained only to find him; and as to that, they placed all
  trust in the Spirit. Men listening for the voice of God, or waiting a sign
  from Heaven, cannot sleep.</p>

  <p>While they were in this condition, a man stepped in under the arch,
  darkening the lewen.</p>

  <p>"Awake!" he said to them; "I bring you a message which will not be put
  off."</p>

  <p>They all sat up.</p>

  <p>"From whom?" asked the Egyptian.</p>

  <p>"Herod the king."</p>

  <p>Each one felt his spirit thrill.</p>

  <p>"Are you not the steward of the khan?" Balthasar asked next.</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"What would the king with us?"</p>

  <p>"His messenger is without; let him answer."</p>

  <p>"Tell him, then, to abide our coming."</p>

  <p>"You were right, O my brother!" said the Greek, when the steward was gone.
  "The question put to the people on the road, and to the guard at the gate,
  has given us quick notoriety. I am impatient; let us up quickly."</p>

  <p>They arose, put on their sandals, girt their mantles about them, and went
  out.</p>

  <p>"I salute you, and give you peace, and pray your pardon; but my master,
  the king, has sent me to invite you to the palace, where he would have speech
  with you privately."</p>

  <p>Thus the messenger discharged his duty.</p>

  <p>A lamp hung in the entrance, and by its light they looked at each other,
  and knew the Spirit was upon them. Then the Egyptian stepped to the steward,
  and said, so as not to be heard by the others, "You know where our goods are
  stored in the court, and where our camels are resting. While we are gone,
  make all things ready for our departure, if it should be needful."</p>

  <p>"Go your way assured; trust me," the steward replied.</p>

  <p>"The king's will is our will," said Balthasar to the messenger. "We will
  follow you."</p>

  <p>The streets of the Holy City were narrow then as now, but not so rough and
  foul; for the great builder, not content with beauty, enforced cleanliness
  and convenience also. Following their guide, the brethren proceeded without a
  word. Through the dim starlight, made dimmer by the walls on both sides,
  sometimes almost lost under bridges connecting the house-tops, out of a low
  ground they ascended a hill. At last they came to a portal reared across the
  way. In the light of fires blazing before it in two great braziers, they
  caught a glimpse of the structure, and also of some guards leaning
  motionlessly upon their arms. They passed into a building unchallenged. Then
  by passages and arched halls; through courts, and under colonnades not always
  lighted; up long flights of stairs, past innumerable cloisters and chambers,
  they were conducted into a tower of great height. Suddenly the guide halted,
  and, pointing through an open door, said to them,</p>

  <p>"Enter. The king is there."</p>

  <p>The air of the chamber was heavy with the perfume of sandal-wood, and all
  the appointments within were effeminately rich. Upon the floor, covering the
  central space, a tufted rug was spread, and upon that a throne was set. The
  visitors had but time, however, to catch a confused idea of the
  place&mdash;of carved and gilt ottomans and couches; of fans and jars and
  musical instruments; of golden candlesticks glittering in their own lights;
  of walls painted in the style of the voluptuous Grecian school, one look at
  which had made a Pharisee hide his head with holy horror. Herod, sitting upon
  the throne to receive them, clad as when at the conference with the doctors
  and lawyers, claimed all their minds.</p>

  <p>At the edge of the rug, to which they advanced uninvited, they prostrated
  themselves. The king touched a bell. An attendant came in, and placed three
  stools before the throne.</p>

  <p>"Seat yourselves," said the monarch, graciously.</p>

  <p>"From the North Gate," he continued, when they were at rest, "I had this
  afternoon report of the arrival of three strangers, curiously mounted, and
  appearing as if from far countries. Are you the men?"</p>

  <p>The Egyptian took the sign from the Greek and the Hindoo, and answered,
  with the profoundest salaam, "Were we other than we are, the mighty Herod,
  whose fame is as incense to the whole world, would not have sent for us. We
  may not doubt that we are the strangers."</p>

  <p>Herod acknowledged the speech with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? Whence do you come?" he asked, adding significantly, "Let
  each speak for himself."</p>

  <p>In turn they gave him account, referring simply to the cities and lands of
  their birth, and the routes by which they came to Jerusalem. Somewhat
  disappointed, Herod plied them more directly.</p>

  <p>"What was the question you put to the officer at the gate?"</p>

  <p>"We asked him, Where is he that is born King of the Jews."</p>

  <p>"I see now why the people were so curious. You excite me no less. Is there
  another King of the Jews?"</p>

  <p>The Egyptian did not blanch.</p>

  <p>"There is one newly born."</p>

  <p>An expression of pain knit the dark face of the monarch, as if his mind
  were swept by a harrowing recollection.</p>

  <p>"Not to me, not to me!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Possibly the accusing images of his murdered children flitted before him;
  recovering from the emotion, whatever it was, he asked, steadily, "Where is
  the new king?"</p>

  <p>"That, O king, is what we would ask."</p>

  <p>"You bring me a wonder&mdash;a riddle surpassing any of Solomon's," the
  inquisitor said next. "As you see, I am in the time of life when curiosity is
  as ungovernable as it was in childhood, when to trifle with it is cruelty.
  Tell me further, and I will honor you as kings honor each other. Give me all
  you know about the newly born, and I will join you in the search for him; and
  when we have found him, I will do what you wish; I will bring him to
  Jerusalem, and train him in kingcraft; I will use my grace with Caesar for
  his promotion and glory. Jealousy shall not come between us, so I swear. But
  tell me first how, so widely separated by seas and deserts, you all came to
  hear of him."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you truly, O king."</p>

  <p>"Speak on," said Herod.</p>

  <p>Balthasar raised himself erect, and said, solemnly,</p>

  <p>"There is an Almighty God."</p>

  <p>Herod was visibly startled.</p>

  <p>"He bade us come hither, promising that we should find the Redeemer of the
  World; that we should see and worship him, and bear witness that he was come;
  and, as a sign, we were each given to see a star. His Spirit stayed with us.
  O king, his Spirit is with us now!"</p>

  <p>An overpowering feeling seized the three. The Greek with difficulty
  restrained an outcry. Herod's gaze darted quickly from one to the other; he
  was more suspicious and dissatisfied than before.</p>

  <p>"You are mocking me," he said. "If not, tell me more. What is to follow
  the coming of the new king?"</p>

  <p>"The salvation of men."</p>

  <p>"From what?"</p>

  <p>"Their wickedness."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By the divine agencies&mdash;Faith, Love, and Good Works."</p>

  <p>"Then"&mdash;Herod paused, and from his look no man could have said with
  what feeling he continued&mdash;"you are the heralds of the Christ. Is that
  all?"</p>

  <p>Balthasar bowed low.</p>

  <p>"We are your servants, O king."</p>

  <p>The monarch touched a bell, and the attendant appeared.</p>

  <p>"Bring the gifts," the master said.</p>

  <p>The attendant went out, but in a little while returned, and, kneeling
  before the guests, gave to each one an outer robe or mantle of scarlet and
  blue, and a girdle of gold. They acknowledged the honors with Eastern
  prostrations.</p>

  <p>"A word further," said Herod, when the ceremony was ended. "To the officer
  of the gate, and but now to me, you spoke of seeing a star in the east."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Balthasar, "his star, the star of the newly born."</p>

  <p>"What time did it appear?"</p>

  <p>"When we were bidden come hither."</p>

  <p>Herod arose, signifying the audience was over. Stepping from the throne
  towards them, he said, with all graciousness,</p>

  <p>"If, as I believe, O illustrious men, you are indeed the heralds of the
  Christ just born, know that I have this night consulted those wisest in
  things Jewish, and they say with one voice he should be born in Bethlehem of
  Judea. I say to you, go thither; go and search diligently for the young
  child; and when you have found him bring me word again, that I may come and
  worship him. To your going there shall be no let or hindrance. Peace be with
  you!"</p>

  <p>And, folding his robe about him, he left the chamber.</p>

  <p>Directly the guide came, and led them back to the street, and thence to
  the khan, at the portal of which the Greek said, impulsively, "Let us to
  Bethlehem, O brethren, as the king has advised."</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried the Hindoo. "The Spirit burns within me."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said Balthasar, with equal warmth. "The camels are ready."</p>

  <p>They gave gifts to the steward, mounted into their saddles, received
  directions to the Joppa Gate, and departed. At their approach the great
  valves were unbarred, and they passed out into the open country, taking the
  road so lately travelled by Joseph and Mary. As they came up out of Hinnom,
  on the plain of Rephaim, a light appeared, at first wide-spread and faint.
  Their pulses fluttered fast. The light intensified rapidly; they closed their
  eyes against its burning brilliance: when they dared look again, lo! the
  star, perfect as any in the heavens, but low down and moving slowly before
  them. And they folded their hands, and shouted, and rejoiced with exceeding
  great joy.</p>

  <p>"God is with us! God is with us!" they repeated, in frequent cheer, all
  the way, until the star, rising out of the valley beyond Mar Elias, stood
  still over a house up on the slope of the hill near the town.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch114"
     name="ch114"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE WISE FIND THE CHILD</h2>

  <p class="first">It was now the beginning of the third watch, and at
  Bethlehem the morning was breaking over the mountains in the east, but so
  feebly that it was yet night in the valley. The watchman on the roof of the
  old khan, shivering in the chilly air, was listening for the first
  distinguishable sounds with which life, awakening, greets the dawn, when a
  light came moving up the hill towards the house. He thought it a torch in
  some one's hand; next moment he thought it a meteor; the brilliance grew,
  however, until it became a star. Sore afraid, he cried out, and brought
  everybody within the walls to the roof. The phenomenon, in eccentric motion,
  continued to approach; the rocks, trees, and roadway under it shone as in a
  glare of lightning; directly its brightness became blinding. The more timid
  of the beholders fell upon their knees, and prayed, with their faces hidden;
  the boldest, covering their eyes, crouched, and now and then snatched glances
  fearfully. Afterwhile the khan and everything thereabout lay under the
  intolerable radiance. Such as dared look beheld the star standing still
  directly over the house in front of the cave where the Child had been
  born.</p>

  <p>In the height of this scene, the wise men came up, and at the gate
  dismounted from their camels, and shouted for admission. When the steward so
  far mastered his terror as to give them heed, he drew the bars and opened to
  them. The camels looked spectral in the unnatural light, and, besides their
  outlandishness, there were in the faces and manner of the three visitors an
  eagerness and exaltation which still further excited the keeper's fears and
  fancy; he fell back, and for a time could not answer the question they put to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is not this Bethlehem of Judea?"</p>

  <p>But others came, and by their presence gave him assurance.</p>

  <p>"No, this is but the khan; the town lies farther on."</p>

  <p>"Is there not here a child newly born?"</p>

  <p>The bystanders turned to each other marvelling, though some of them
  answered, "Yes, yes."</p>

  <p>"Show us to him!" said the Greek, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Show us to him!" cried Balthasar, breaking through his gravity; "for we
  have seen his star, even that which ye behold over the house, and are come to
  worship him."</p>

  <p>The Hindoo clasped his hands, exclaiming, "God indeed lives! Make haste,
  make haste! The Savior is found. Blessed, blessed are we above men!"</p>

  <p>The people from the roof came down and followed the strangers as they were
  taken through the court and out into the enclosure; at sight of the star yet
  above the cave, though less candescent than before, some turned back afraid;
  the greater part went on. As the strangers neared the house, the orb arose;
  when they were at the door, it was high up overhead vanishing; when they
  entered, it went out lost to sight. And to the witnesses of what then took
  place came a conviction that there was a divine relation between the star and
  the strangers, which extended also to at least some of the occupants of the
  cave. When the door was opened, they crowded in.</p>

  <p>The apartment was lighted by a lantern enough to enable the strangers to
  find the mother, and the child awake in her lap.</p>

  <p>"Is the child thine?" asked Balthasar of Mary.</p>

  <p>And she who had kept all the things in the least affecting the little one,
  and pondered them in her heart, held it up in the light, saying,</p>

  <p>"He is my son!"</p>

  <p>And they fell down and worshipped him.</p>

  <p>They saw the child was as other children: about its head was neither
  nimbus nor material crown; its lips opened not in speech; if it heard their
  expressions of joy, their invocations, their prayers, it made no sign
  whatever, but, baby-like, looked longer at the flame in the lantern than at
  them.</p>

  <p>In a little while they arose, and, returning to the camels, brought gifts
  of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and laid them before the child, abating
  nothing of their worshipful speeches; of which no part is given, for the
  thoughtful know that the pure worship of the pure heart was then what it is
  now, and has always been, an inspired song.</p>

  <p>And this was the Savior they had come so far to find!</p>

  <p>Yet they worshipped without a doubt.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Their faith rested upon the signs sent them by him whom we have since come
  to know as the Father; and they were of the kind to whom his promises were so
  all-sufficient that they asked nothing about his ways. Few there were who had
  seen the signs and heard the promises&mdash;the Mother and Joseph, the
  shepherds, and the Three&mdash;yet they all believed alike; that is to say,
  in this period of the plan of salvation, God was all and the Child nothing.
  But look forward, O reader! A time will come when the signs will all proceed
  from the Son. Happy they who then believe in him!</p>

  <p>Let us wait that period.</p>

  years, to the beginning of the administration of Valerius Gratus, the fourth
  imperial governor of Judea&mdash;a period which will be remembered as rent by
  political agitations in Jerusalem, if, indeed, it be not the precise time of
  the opening of the final quarrel between the Jew and the Roman.</p>

  <p>In the interval Judea had been subjected to changes affecting her in many
  ways, but in nothing so much as her political status. Herod the Great died
  within one year after the birth of the Child&mdash;died so miserably that the
  Christian world had reason to believe him overtaken by the Divine wrath. Like
  all great rulers who spend their lives in perfecting the power they create,
  he dreamed of transmitting his throne and crown&mdash;of being the founder of
  a dynasty. With that intent, he left a will dividing his territories between
  his three sons, Antipas, Philip, and Archelaus, of whom the last was
  appointed to succeed to the title. The testament was necessarily referred to
  Augustus, the emperor, who ratified all its provisions with one exception: he
  withheld from Archelaus the title of king until he proved his capacity and
  loyalty; in lieu thereof, he created him ethnarch, and as such permitted him
  to govern nine years, when, for misconduct and inability to stay the
  turbulent elements that grew and strengthened around him, he was sent into
  Gaul as an exile.</p>

  <p>Caesar was not content with deposing Archelaus; he struck the people of
  Jerusalem in a manner that touched their pride, and keenly wounded the
  sensibilities of the haughty habitues of the Temple. He reduced Judea to a
  Roman province, and annexed it to the prefecture of Syria. So, instead of a
  king ruling royally from the palace left by Herod on Mount Zion, the city
  fell into the hands of an officer of the second grade, an appointee called
  procurator, who communicated with the court in Rome through the Legate of
  Syria, residing in Antioch. To make the hurt more painful, the procurator was
  not permitted to establish himself in Jerusalem; Caesarea was his seat of
  government. Most humiliating, however, most exasperating, most studied,
  Samaria, of all the world the most despised&mdash;Samaria was joined to Judea
  as a part of the same province! What ineffable misery the bigoted Separatists
  or Pharisees endured at finding themselves elbowed and laughed at in the
  procurator's presence in Caesarea by the devotees of Gerizim!</p>

  <p>In this rain of sorrows, one consolation, and one only, remained to the
  fallen people: the high-priest occupied the Herodian palace in the
  market-place, and kept the semblance of a court there. What his authority
  really was is a matter of easy estimate. Judgment of life and death was
  retained by the procurator. Justice was administered in the name and
  according to the decretals of Rome. Yet more significant, the royal house was
  jointly occupied by the imperial exciseman, and all his corps of assistants,
  registrars, collectors, publicans, informers, and spies. Still, to the
  dreamers of liberty to come, there was a certain satisfaction in the fact
  that the chief ruler in the palace was a Jew. His mere presence there day
  after day kept them reminded of the covenants and promises of the prophets,
  and the ages when Jehovah governed the tribes through the sons of Aaron; it
  was to them a certain sign that he had not abandoned them: so their hopes
  lived, and served their patience, and helped them wait grimly the son of
  Judah who was to rule Israel.</p>

  <p>Judea had been a Roman province eighty years and more&mdash;ample time for
  the Caesars to study the idiosyncrasies of the people&mdash;time enough, at
  least, to learn that the Jew, with all his pride, could be quietly governed
  if his religion were respected. Proceeding upon that policy, the predecessors
  of Gratus had carefully abstained from interfering with any of the sacred
  observances of their subjects. But he chose a different course: almost his
  first official act was to expel Hannas from the high-priesthood, and give the
  place to Ishmael, son of Fabus.</p>

  <p>Whether the act was directed by Augustus, or proceeded from Gratus
  himself, its impolicy became speedily apparent. The reader shall be spared a
  chapter on Jewish politics; a few words upon the subject, however, are
  essential to such as may follow the succeeding narration critically. At this
  time, leaving origin out of view, there were in Judea the party of the nobles
  and the Separatist or popular party. Upon Herod's death, the two united
  against Archelaus; from temple to palace, from Jerusalem to Rome, they fought
  him; sometimes with intrigue, sometimes with the actual weapons of war. More
  than once the holy cloisters on Moriah resounded with the cries of
  fighting-men. Finally, they drove him into exile. Meantime throughout this
  struggle the allies had their diverse objects in view. The nobles hated
  Joazar, the high-priest; the Separatists, on the other hand, were his zealous
  adherents. When Herod's settlement went down with Archelaus, Joazar shared
  the fall. Hannas, the son of Seth, was selected by the nobles to fill the
  great office; thereupon the allies divided. The induction of the Sethian
  brought them face to face in fierce hostility.</p>

  <p>In the course of the struggle with the unfortunate ethnarch, the nobles
  had found it expedient to attach themselves to Rome. Discerning that when the
  existing settlement was broken up some form of government must needs follow,
  they suggested the conversion of Judea into a province. The fact furnished
  the Separatists an additional cause for attack; and, when Samaria was made
  part of the province, the nobles sank into a minority, with nothing to
  support them but the imperial court and the prestige of their rank and
  wealth; yet for fifteen years&mdash;down, indeed, to the coming of Valerius
  Gratus&mdash;they managed to maintain themselves in both palace and
  Temple.</p>

  <p>Hannas, the idol of his party, had used his power faithfully in the
  interest of his imperial patron. A Roman garrison held the Tower of Antonia;
  a Roman guard kept the gates of the palace; a Roman judge dispensed justice
  civil and criminal; a Roman system of taxation, mercilessly executed, crushed
  both city and country; daily, hourly, and in a thousand ways, the people were
  bruised and galled, and taught the difference between a life of independence
  and a life of subjection; yet Hannas kept them in comparative quiet. Rome had
  no truer friend; and he made his loss instantly felt. Delivering his
  vestments to Ishmael, the new appointee, he walked from the courts of the
  Temple into the councils of the Separatists, and became the head of a new
  combination, Bethusian and Sethian.</p>

  <p>Gratus, the procurator, left thus without a party, saw the fires which, in
  the fifteen years, had sunk into sodden smoke begin to glow with returning
  life. A month after Ishmael took the office, the Roman found it necessary to
  visit him in Jerusalem. When from the walls, hooting and hissing him, the
  Jews beheld his guard enter the north gate of the city and march to the Tower
  of Antonia, they understood the real purpose of the visit&mdash;a full cohort
  of legionaries was added to the former garrison, and the keys of their yoke
  could now be tightened with impunity. If the procurator deemed it important
  to make an example, alas for the first offender!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch202"
     name="ch202"></a>II. &mdash; BEN-HUR AND MESSALA</h2>

  <p class="first">With the foregoing explanation in mind, the reader is
  invited to look into one of the gardens of the palace on Mount Zion. The time
  was noonday in the middle of July, when the heat of summer was at its
  highest.</p>

  <p>The garden was bounded on every side by buildings, which in places arose
  two stories, with verandas shading the doors and windows of the lower story,
  while retreating galleries, guarded by strong balustrades, adorned and
  protected the upper. Here and there, moreover, the structures fell into what
  appeared low colonnades, permitting the passage of such winds as chanced to
  blow, and allowing other parts of the house to be seen, the better to realize
  its magnitude and beauty. The arrangement of the ground was equally pleasant
  to the eye. There were walks, and patches of grass and shrubbery, and a few
  large trees, rare specimens of the palm, grouped with the carob, apricot, and
  walnut. In all directions the grade sloped gently from the centre, where
  there was a reservoir, or deep marble basin, broken at intervals by little
  gates which, when raised, emptied the water into sluices bordering the
  walks&mdash;a cunning device for the rescue of the place from the aridity too
  prevalent elsewhere in the region.</p>

  <p>Not far from the fountain, there was a small pool of clear water
  nourishing a clump of cane and oleander, such as grow on the Jordan and down
  by the Dead Sea. Between the clump and the pool, unmindful of the sun shining
  full upon them in the breathless air, two boys, one about nineteen, the other
  seventeen, sat engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur and Messala</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>They were both handsome, and, at first glance, would have been pronounced
  brothers. Both had hair and eyes black; their faces were deeply browned; and,
  sitting, they seemed of a size proper for the difference in their ages.</p>

  <p>The elder was bareheaded. A loose tunic, dropping to the knees, was his
  attire complete, except sandals and a light-blue mantle spread under him on
  the seat. The costume left his arms and legs exposed, and they were brown as
  the face; nevertheless, a certain grace of manner, refinement of features,
  and culture of voice decided his rank. The tunic, of softest woollen,
  gray-tinted, at the neck, sleeves, and edge of the skirt bordered with red,
  and bound to the waist by a tasselled silken cord, certified him the Roman he
  was. And if in speech he now and then gazed haughtily at his companion and
  addressed him as an inferior, he might almost be excused, for he was of a
  family noble even in Rome&mdash;a circumstance which in that age justified
  any assumption. In the terrible wars between the first Caesar and his great
  enemies, a Messala had been the friend of Brutus. After Philippi, without
  sacrifice of his honor, he and the conqueror became reconciled. Yet later,
  when Octavius disputed for the empire, Messala supported him. Octavius, as
  the Emperor Augustus, remembered the service, and showered the family with
  honors. Among other things, Judea being reduced to a province, he sent the
  son of his old client or retainer to Jerusalem, charged with the receipt and
  management of the taxes levied in that region; and in that service the son
  had since remained, sharing the palace with the high-priest. The youth just
  described was his son, whose habit it was to carry about with him all too
  faithfully a remembrance of the relation between his grandfather and the
  great Romans of his day.</p>

  <p>The associate of the Messala was slighter in form, and his garments were
  of fine white linen and of the prevalent style in Jerusalem; a cloth covered
  his head, held by a yellow cord, and arranged so as to fall away from the
  forehead down low over the back of the neck. An observer skilled in the
  distinctions of race, and studying his features more than his costume, would
  have soon discovered him to be of Jewish descent. The forehead of the Roman
  was high and narrow, his nose sharp and aquiline, while his lips were thin
  and straight, and his eyes cold and close under the brows. The front of the
  Israelite, on the other hand, was low and broad; his nose long, with expanded
  nostrils; his upper lip, slightly shading the lower one, short and curving to
  the dimpled corners, like a Cupid's bow; points which, in connection with the
  round chin, full eyes, and oval cheeks reddened with a wine-like glow, gave
  his face the softness, strength, and beauty peculiar to his race. The
  comeliness of the Roman was severe and chaste, that of the Jew rich and
  voluptuous.</p>

  <p>"Did you not say the new procurator is to arrive to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>The question proceeded from the younger of the friends, and was couched in
  Greek, at the time, singularly enough, the language everywhere prevalent in
  the politer circles of Judea; having passed from the palace into the camp and
  college; thence, nobody knew exactly when or how, into the Temple itself,
  and, for that matter, into precincts of the Temple far beyond the gates and
  cloisters&mdash;precincts of a sanctity intolerable for a Gentile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-morrow," Messala answered.</p>

  <p>"Who told you?"</p>

  <p>"I heard Ishmael, the new governor in the palace&mdash;you call him high
  priest&mdash;tell my father so last night. The news had been more credible, I
  grant you, coming from an Egyptian, who is of a race that has forgotten what
  truth is, or even from an Idumaean, whose people never knew what truth was;
  but, to make quite certain, I saw a centurion from the Tower this morning,
  and he told me preparations were going on for the reception; that the
  armorers were furbishing the helmets and shields, and regilding the eagles
  and globes; and that apartments long unused were being cleansed and aired as
  if for an addition to the garrison&mdash;the body-guard, probably, of the
  great man."</p>

  <p>A perfect idea of the manner in which the answer was given cannot be
  conveyed, as its fine points continually escape the power behind the pen. The
  reader's fancy must come to his aid; and for that he must be reminded that
  reverence as a quality of the Roman mind was fast breaking down, or, rather,
  it was becoming unfashionable. The old religion had nearly ceased to be a
  faith; at most it was a mere habit of thought and expression, cherished
  principally by the priests who found service in the Temple profitable, and
  the poets who, in the turn of their verses, could not dispense with the
  familiar deities: there are singers of this age who are similarly given. As
  philosophy was taking the place of religion, satire was fast substituting
  reverence; insomuch that in Latin opinion it was to every speech, even to the
  little diatribes of conversation, as salt to viands, and aroma to wine. The
  young Messala, educated in Rome, but lately returned, had caught the habit
  and manner; the scarce perceptible movement of the outer corner of the lower
  eyelid, the decided curl of the corresponding nostril, and a languid
  utterance affected as the best vehicle to convey the idea of general
  indifference, but more particularly because of the opportunities it afforded
  for certain rhetorical pauses thought to be of prime importance to enable the
  listener to take the happy conceit or receive the virus of the stinging
  epigram. Such a stop occurred in the answer just given, at the end of the
  allusion to the Egyptian and Idumaean. The color in the Jewish lad's cheeks
  deepened, and he may not have heard the rest of the speech, for he remained
  silent, looking absently into the depths of the pool.</p>

  <p>"Our farewell took place in this garden. 'The peace of the Lord go with
  you!'&mdash;your last words. 'The gods keep you!' I said. Do you remember?
  How many years have passed since then?"</p>

  <p>"Five," answered the Jew, gazing into the water.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have reason to be thankful to&mdash;whom shall I say? The gods?
  No matter. You have grown handsome; the Greeks would call you
  beautiful&mdash;happy achievement of the years! If Jupiter would stay content
  with one Ganymede, what a cup-bearer you would make for the emperor! Tell me,
  my Judah, how the coming of the procurator is of such interest to you."</p>

  <p>Judah bent his large eyes upon the questioner; the gaze was grave and
  thoughtful, and caught the Roman's, and held it while he replied, "Yes, five
  years. I remember the parting; you went to Rome; I saw you start, and cried,
  for I love you. The years are gone, and you have come back to me accomplished
  and princely&mdash;I do not jest; and yet&mdash;yet&mdash;I do wish you were
  the Messala you went away."</p>

  <p>The fine nostril of the satirist stirred, and he put on a longer drawl as
  he said, "No, no; not a Ganymede&mdash;an oracle, my Judah. A few lessons
  from my teacher of rhetoric hard by the Forum&mdash;I will give you a letter
  to him when you become wise enough to accept a suggestion which I am reminded
  to make you&mdash;a little practise of the art of mystery, and Delphi will
  receive you as Apollo himself. At the sound of your solemn voice, the Pythia
  will come down to you with her crown. Seriously, O my friend, in what am I
  not the Messala I went away? I once heard the greatest logician in the world.
  His subject was Disputation. One saying I remember&mdash;'Understand your
  antagonist before you answer him.' Let me understand you."</p>

  <p>The lad reddened under the cynical look to which he was subjected; yet he
  replied, firmly, "You have availed yourself, I see, of your opportunities;
  from your teachers you have brought away much knowledge and many graces. You
  talk with the ease of a master, yet your speech carries a sting. My Messala,
  when he went away, had no poison in his nature; not for the world would he
  have hurt the feelings of a friend."</p>

  <p>The Roman smiled as if complimented, and raised his patrician head a toss
  higher.</p>

  <p>"O my solemn Judah, we are not at Dodona or Pytho. Drop the oracular, and
  be plain. Wherein have I hurt you?"</p>

  <p>The other drew a long breath, and said, pulling at the cord about his
  waist, "In the five years, I, too, have learned somewhat. Hillel may not be
  the equal of the logician you heard, and Simeon and Shammai are, no doubt,
  inferior to your master hard by the Forum. Their learning goes not out into
  forbidden paths; those who sit at their feet arise enriched simply with
  knowledge of God, the law, and Israel; and the effect is love and reverence
  for everything that pertains to them. Attendance at the Great College, and
  study of what I heard there, have taught me that Judea is not as she used to
  be. I know the space that lies between an independent kingdom and the petty
  province Judea is. I were meaner, viler, than a Samaritan not to resent the
  degradation of my country. Ishmael is not lawfully high-priest, and he cannot
  be while the noble Hannas lives; yet he is a Levite; one of the devoted who
  for thousands of years have acceptably served the Lord God of our faith and
  worship. His&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Messala broke in upon him with a biting laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I understand you now. Ishmael, you say, is a usurper, yet to believe
  an Idumaean sooner than Ishmael is to sting like an adder. By the drunken son
  of Semele, what it is to be a Jew! All men and things, even heaven and earth,
  change; but a Jew never. To him there is no backward, no forward; he is what
  his ancestor was in the beginning. In this sand I draw you a
  circle&mdash;there! Now tell me what more a Jew's life is? Round and round,
  Abraham here, Isaac and Jacob yonder, God in the middle. And the
  circle&mdash;by the master of all thunders! the circle is too large. I draw
  it again&mdash;" He stopped, put his thumb upon the ground, and swept the
  fingers about it. "See, the thumb spot is the Temple, the finger-lines Judea.
  Outside the little space is there nothing of value? The arts! Herod was a
  builder; therefore he is accursed. Painting, sculpture! to look upon them is
  sin. Poetry you make fast to your altars. Except in the synagogue, who of you
  attempts eloquence? In war all you conquer in the six days you lose on the
  seventh. Such your life and limit; who shall say no if I laugh at you?
  Satisfied with the worship of such a people, what is your God to our Roman
  Jove, who lends us his eagles that we may compass the universe with our arms?
  Hillel, Simeon, Shammai, Abtalion&mdash;what are they to the masters who
  teach that everything is worth knowing that can be known?"</p>

  <p>The Jew arose, his face much flushed.</p>

  <p>"No, no; keep your place, my Judah, keep your place," Messala cried,
  extending his hand.</p>

  <p>"You mock me."</p>

  <p>"Listen a little further. Directly"&mdash;the Roman smiled
  derisively&mdash;"directly Jupiter and his whole family, Greek and Latin,
  will come to me, as is their habit, and make an end of serious speech. I am
  mindful of your goodness in walking from the old house of your fathers to
  welcome me back and renew the love of our childhood&mdash;if we can. 'Go,'
  said my teacher, in his last lecture&mdash;'Go, and, to make your lives
  great, remember Mars reigns and Eros has found his eyes.' He meant love is
  nothing, war everything. It is so in Rome. Marriage is the first step to
  divorce. Virtue is a tradesman's jewel. Cleopatra, dying, bequeathed her
  arts, and is avenged; she has a successor in every Roman's house. The world
  is going the same way; so, as to our future, down Eros, up Mars! I am to be a
  soldier; and you, O my Judah, I pity you; what can you be?"</p>

  <p>The Jew moved nearer the pool; Messala's drawl deepened.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I pity you, my fine Judah. From the college to the synagogue; then
  to the Temple; then&mdash;oh, a crowning glory!&mdash;the seat in the
  Sanhedrim. A life without opportunities; the gods help you! But I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Judah looked at him in time to see the flush of pride that kindled in his
  haughty face as he went on.</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;ah, the world is not all conquered. The sea has islands
  unseen. In the north there are nations yet unvisited. The glory of completing
  Alexander's march to the Far East remains to some one. See what possibilities
  lie before a Roman."</p>

  <p>Next instant he resumed his drawl.</p>

  <p>"A campaign into Africa; another after the Scythian; then&mdash;a legion!
  Most careers end there; but not mine. I&mdash;by Jupiter! what a
  conception!&mdash;I will give up my legion for a prefecture. Think of life in
  Rome with money&mdash;money, wine, women, games&mdash;poets at the banquet,
  intrigues in the court, dice all the year round. Such a rounding of life may
  be&mdash;a fat prefecture, and it is mine. O my Judah, here is Syria! Judea
  is rich; Antioch a capital for the gods. I will succeed Cyrenius, and
  you&mdash;shall share my fortune."</p>

  <p>The sophists and rhetoricians who thronged the public resorts of Rome,
  almost monopolizing the business of teaching her patrician youth, might have
  approved these sayings of Messala, for they were all in the popular vein; to
  the young Jew, however, they were new, and unlike the solemn style of
  discourse and conversation to which he was accustomed. He belonged, moreover,
  to a race whose laws, modes, and habits of thought forbade satire and humor;
  very naturally, therefore, he listened to his friend with varying feelings;
  one moment indignant, then uncertain how to take him. The superior airs
  assumed had been offensive to him in the beginning; soon they became
  irritating, and at last an acute smart. Anger lies close by this point in all
  of us; and that the satirist evoked in another way. To the Jew of the
  Herodian period patriotism was a savage passion scarcely hidden under his
  common humor, and so related to his history, religion, and God that it
  responded instantly to derision of them. Wherefore it is not speaking too
  strongly to say that Messala's progress down to the last pause was exquisite
  torture to his hearer; at that point the latter said, with a forced
  smile,</p>

  <p>"There are a few, I have heard, who can afford to make a jest of their
  future; you convince me, O my Messala, that I am not one of them."</p>

  <p>The Roman studied him; then replied, "Why not the truth in a jest as well
  as a parable? The great Fulvia went fishing the other day; she caught more
  than all the company besides. They said it was because the barb of her hook
  was covered with gold."</p>

  <p>"Then you were not merely jesting?"</p>

  <p>"My Judah, I see I did not offer you enough," the Roman answered, quickly,
  his eyes sparkling. "When I am prefect, with Judea to enrich me, I&mdash;will
  make you high-priest."</p>

  <p>The Jew turned off angrily.</p>

  <p>"Do not leave me," said Messala.</p>

  <p>The other stopped irresolute.</p>

  <p>"Gods, Judah, how hot the sun shines!" cried the patrician, observing his
  perplexity. "Let us seek a shade."</p>

  <p>Judah answered, coldly,</p>

  <p>"We had better part. I wish I had not come. I sought a friend and find
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Roman," said Messala, quickly.</p>

  <p>The hands of the Jew clenched, but controlling himself again, he started
  off. Messala arose, and, taking the mantle from the bench, flung it over his
  shoulder, and followed after; when he gained his side, he put his hand upon
  his shoulder and walked with him.</p>

  <p>"This is the way&mdash;my hand thus&mdash;we used to walk when we were
  children. Let us keep it as far as the gate."</p>

  <p>Apparently Messala was trying to be serious and kind, though he could not
  rid his countenance of the habitual satirical expression. Judah permitted the
  familiarity.</p>

  <p>"You are a boy; I am a man; let me talk like one."</p>

  <p>The complacency of the Roman was superb. Mentor lecturing the young
  Telemachus could not have been more at ease.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe in the Parcae? Ah, I forgot, you are a Sadducee: the
  Essenes are your sensible people; they believe in the sisters. So do I. How
  everlastingly the three are in the way of our doing what we please! I sit
  down scheming. I run paths here and there. Perpol! Just when I am reaching to
  take the world in hand, I hear behind me the grinding of scissors. I look,
  and there she is, the accursed Atropos! But, my Judah, why did you get mad
  when I spoke of succeeding old Cyrenius? You thought I meant to enrich myself
  plundering your Judea. Suppose so; it is what some Roman will do. Why not
  I?"</p>

  <p>Judah shortened his step.</p>

  <p>"There have been strangers in mastery of Judea before the Roman," he said,
  with lifted hand. "Where are they, Messala? She has outlived them all. What
  has been will be again."</p>

  <p>Messala put on his drawl.</p>

  <p>"The Parcae have believers outside the Essenes. Welcome, Judah, welcome to
  the faith!"</p>

  <p>"No, Messala, count me not with them. My faith rests on the rock which was
  the foundation of the faith of my fathers back further than Abraham; on the
  covenants of the Lord God of Israel."</p>

  <p>"Too much passion, my Judah. How my master would have been shocked had I
  been guilty of so much heat in his presence! There were other things I had to
  tell you, but I fear to now."</p>

  <p>When they had gone a few yards, the Roman spoke again.</p>

  <p>"I think you can hear me now, especially as what I have to say concerns
  yourself. I would serve you, O handsome as Ganymede; I would serve you with
  real good-will. I love you&mdash;all I can. I told you I meant to be a
  soldier. Why not you also? Why not you step out of the narrow circle which,
  as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and customs allow?"</p>

  <p>Judah made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Who are the wise men of our day?" Messala continued. "Not they who
  exhaust their years quarrelling about dead things; about Baals, Joves, and
  Jehovahs; about philosophies and religions. Give me one great name, O Judah;
  I care not where you go to find it&mdash;to Rome, Egypt, the East, or here in
  Jerusalem&mdash;Pluto take me if it belong not to a man who wrought his fame
  out of the material furnished him by the present; holding nothing sacred that
  did not contribute to the end, scorning nothing that did! How was it with
  Herod? How with the Maccabees? How with the first and second Caesars? Imitate
  them. Begin now. At hand see&mdash;Rome, as ready to help you as she was the
  Idumaean Antipater."</p>

  <p>The Jewish lad trembled with rage; and, as the garden gate was close by,
  he quickened his steps, eager to escape.</p>

  <p>"O Rome, Rome!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Be wise," continued Messala. "Give up the follies of Moses and the
  traditions; see the situation as it is. Dare look the Parcae in the face, and
  they will tell you, Rome is the world. Ask them of Judea, and they will
  answer, She is what Rome wills."</p>

  <p>They were now at the gate. Judah stopped, and took the hand gently from
  his shoulder, and confronted Messala, tears trembling in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I understand you, because you are a Roman; you cannot understand
  me&mdash;I am an Israelite. You have given me suffering to-day by convincing
  me that we can never be the friends we have been&mdash;never! Here we part.
  The peace of the God of my fathers abide with you!"</p>

  <p>Messala offered him his hand; the Jew walked on through the gateway. When
  he was gone, the Roman was silent awhile; then he, too, passed through,
  saying to himself, with a toss of the head,</p>

  <p>"Be it so. Eros is dead, Mars reigns!"</p>

  <p class="first">From the entrance to the Holy City, equivalent to what is
  now called St. Stephen's Gate, a street extended westwardly, on a line
  parallel with the northern front of the Tower of Antonia, though a square
  from that famous castle. Keeping the course as far as the Tyropoeon Valley,
  which it followed a little way south, it turned and again ran west until a
  short distance beyond what tradition tells us was the Judgment Gate, from
  whence it broke abruptly south. The traveller or the student familiar with
  the sacred locality will recognize the thoroughfare described as part of the
  Via Dolorosa&mdash;with Christians of more interest, though of a melancholy
  kind, than any street in the world. As the purpose in view does not at
  present require dealing with the whole street, it will be sufficient to point
  out a house standing in the angle last mentioned as marking the change of
  direction south, and which, as an important centre of interest, needs
  somewhat particular description.</p>

  <p>The building fronted north and west, probably four hundred feet each way,
  and, like most pretentious Eastern structures, was two stories in height, and
  perfectly quadrangular. The street on the west side was about twelve feet
  wide, that on the north not more than ten; so that one walking close to the
  walls, and looking up at them, would have been struck by the rude,
  unfinished, uninviting, but strong and imposing, appearance they presented;
  for they were of stone laid in large blocks, undressed&mdash;on the outer
  side, in fact, just as they were taken from the quarry. A critic of this age
  would have pronounced the house fortelesque in style, except for the windows,
  with which it was unusually garnished, and the ornate finish of the doorways
  or gates. The western windows were four in number, the northern only two, all
  set on the line of the second story in such manner as to overhang the
  thoroughfares below. The gates were the only breaks of wall externally
  visible in the first story; and, besides being so thickly riven with iron
  bolts as to suggest resistance to battering-rams, they were protected by
  cornices of marble, handsomely executed, and of such bold projection as to
  assure visitors well informed of the people that the rich man who resided
  there was a Sadducee in politics and creed.</p>

  <p>Not long after the young Jew parted from the Roman at the palace up on the
  Market-place, he stopped before the western gate of the house described, and
  knocked. The wicket (a door hung in one of the valves of the gate) was opened
  to admit him. He stepped in hastily, and failed to acknowledge the low salaam
  of the porter.</p>

  <p>To get an idea of the interior arrangement of the structure, as well as to
  see what more befell the youth, we will follow him.</p>

  <p>The passage into which he was admitted appeared not unlike a narrow tunnel
  with panelled walls and pitted ceiling. There were benches of stone on both
  sides, stained and polished by long use. Twelve or fifteen steps carried him
  into a court-yard, oblong north and south, and in every quarter, except the
  east, bounded by what seemed the fronts of two-story houses; of which the
  lower floor was divided into lewens, while the upper was terraced and
  defended by strong balustrading. The servants coming and going along the
  terraces; the noise of millstones grinding; the garments fluttering from
  ropes stretched from point to point; the chickens and pigeons in full
  enjoyment of the place; the goats, cows, donkeys, and horses stabled in the
  lewens; a massive trough of water, apparently for the common use, declared
  this court appurtenant to the domestic management of the owner. Eastwardly
  there was a division wall broken by another passage-way in all respects like
  the first one.</p>

  <p>Clearing the second passage, the young man entered a second court,
  spacious, square, and set with shrubbery and vines, kept fresh and beautiful
  by water from a basin erected near a porch on the north side. The lewens here
  were high, airy, and shaded by curtains striped alternate white and red. The
  arches of the lewens rested on clustered columns. A flight of steps on the
  south ascended to the terraces of the upper story, over which great awnings
  were stretched as a defence against the sun. Another stairway reached from
  the terraces to the roof, the edge of which, all around the square, was
  defined by a sculptured cornice, and a parapet of burned-clay tiling,
  sexangular and bright red. In this quarter, moreover, there was everywhere
  observable a scrupulous neatness, which, allowing no dust in the angles, not
  even a yellow leaf upon a shrub, contributed quite as much as anything else
  to the delightful general effect; insomuch that a visitor, breathing the
  sweet air, knew, in advance of introduction, the refinement of the family he
  was about calling upon.</p>

  <p>A few steps within the second court, the lad turned to the right, and,
  choosing a walk through the shrubbery, part of which was in flower, passed to
  the stairway, and ascended to the terrace&mdash;a broad pavement of white and
  brown flags closely laid, and much worn. Making way under the awning to a
  doorway on the north side, he entered an apartment which the dropping of the
  screen behind him returned to darkness. Nevertheless, he proceeded, moving
  over a tiled floor to a divan, upon which he flung himself, face downwards,
  and lay at rest, his forehead upon his crossed arms.</p>

  <p>About nightfall a woman came to the door and called; he answered, and she
  went in.</p>

  <p>"Supper is over, and it is night. Is not my son hungry?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Are you sick?"</p>

  <p>"I am sleepy."</p>

  <p>"Your mother has asked for you."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In the summer-house on the roof."</p>

  <p>He stirred himself, and sat up.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Bring me something to eat."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"What you please, Amrah. I am not sick, but indifferent. Life does not
  seem as pleasant as it did this morning. A new ailment, O my Amrah; and you
  who know me so well, who never failed me, may think of the things now that
  answer for food and medicine. Bring me what you choose."</p>

  <p>Amrah's questions, and the voice in which she put them&mdash;low,
  sympathetic, and solicitous&mdash;were significant of an endeared relation
  between the two. She laid her hand upon his forehead; then, as satisfied,
  went out, saying, "I will see."</p>

  <p>After a while she returned, bearing on a wooden platter a bowl of milk,
  some thin cakes of white bread broken, a delicate paste of brayed wheat, a
  bird broiled, and honey and salt. On one end of the platter there was a
  silver goblet full of wine, on the other a brazen hand-lamp lighted.</p>

  <p>The room was then revealed: its walls smoothly plastered; the ceiling
  broken by great oaken rafters, brown with rain stains and time; the floor of
  small diamond-shaped white and blue tiles, very firm and enduring; a few
  stools with legs carved in imitation of the legs of lions; a divan raised a
  little above the floor, trimmed with blue cloth, and partially covered by an
  immense striped woollen blanket or shawl&mdash;in brief, a Hebrew
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>The same light also gave the woman to view. Drawing a stool to the divan,
  she placed the platter upon it, then knelt close by ready to serve him. Her
  face was that of a woman of fifty, dark-skinned, dark-eyed, and at the moment
  softened by a look of tenderness almost maternal. A white turban covered her
  head, leaving the lobes of the ear exposed, and in them the sign that settled
  her condition&mdash;an orifice bored by a thick awl. She was a slave, of
  Egyptian origin, to whom not even the sacred fiftieth year could have brought
  freedom; nor would she have accepted it, for the boy she was attending was
  her life. She had nursed him through babyhood, tended him as a child, and
  could not break the service. To her love he could never be a man.</p>

  <p>He spoke but once during the meal.</p>

  <p>"You remember, O my Amrah," he said, "the Messala who used to visit me
  here days at a time."</p>

  <p>"I remember him."</p>

  <p>"He went to Rome some years ago, and is now back. I called upon him
  to-day."</p>

  <p>A shudder of disgust seized the lad.</p>

  <p>"I knew something had happened," she said, deeply interested. "I never
  liked the Messala. Tell me all."</p>

  <p>But he fell into musing, and to her repeated inquiries only said, "He is
  much changed, and I shall have nothing more to do with him."</p>

  <p>When Amrah took the platter away, he also went out, and up from the
  terrace to the roof.</p>

  <p>The reader is presumed to know somewhat of the uses of the house-top in
  the East. In the matter of customs, climate is a lawgiver everywhere. The
  Syrian summer day drives the seeker of comfort into the darkened lewen;
  night, however, calls him forth early, and the shadows deepening over the
  mountain-sides seem veils dimly covering Circean singers; but they are far
  off, while the roof is close by, and raised above the level of the shimmering
  plain enough for the visitation of cool airs, and sufficiently above the
  trees to allure the stars down closer, down at least into brighter shining.
  So the roof became a resort&mdash;became playground, sleeping-chamber,
  boudoir, rendezvous for the family, place of music, dance, conversation,
  reverie, and prayer.</p>

  <p>The motive that prompts the decoration, at whatever cost, of interiors in
  colder climes suggested to the Oriental the embellishment of his house-top.
  The parapet ordered by Moses became a potter's triumph; above that, later,
  arose towers, plain and fantastic; still later, kings and princes crowned
  their roofs with summer-houses of marble and gold. When the Babylonian hung
  gardens in the air, extravagance could push the idea no further.</p>

  <p>The lad whom we are following walked slowly across the house-top to a
  tower built over the northwest corner of the palace. Had he been a stranger,
  he might have bestowed a glance upon the structure as he drew nigh it, and
  seen all the dimness permitted&mdash;a darkened mass, low, latticed,
  pillared, and domed. He entered, passing under a half-raised curtain. The
  interior was all darkness, except that on four sides there were arched
  openings like doorways, through which the sky, lighted with stars, was
  visible. In one of the openings, reclining against a cushion from a divan, he
  saw the figure of a woman, indistinct even in white floating drapery. At the
  sound of his steps upon the floor, the fan in her hand stopped, glistening
  where the starlight struck the jewels with which it was sprinkled, and she
  sat up, and called his name.</p>

  <p>"Judah, my son!"</p>

  <p>"It is I, mother," he answered, quickening his approach.</p>

  <p>Going to her, he knelt, and she put her arms around him, and with kisses
  pressed him to her bosom.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch204"
     name="ch204"></a>IV. &mdash; THE STRANGE THINGS BEN-HUR WANTS TO KNOW</h2>

  <p class="first">The mother resumed her easy position against the cushion,
  while the son took place on the divan, his head in her lap. Both of them,
  looking out of the opening, could see a stretch of lower house-tops in the
  vicinity, a bank of blue-blackness over in the west which they knew to be
  mountains, and the sky, its shadowy depths brilliant with stars. The city was
  still. Only the winds stirred.</p>

  <p>"Amrah tells me something has happened to you," she said, caressing his
  cheek. "When my Judah was a child, I allowed small things to trouble him, but
  he is now a man. He must not forget"&mdash;her voice became very
  soft&mdash;"that one day he is to be my hero."</p>

  <p>She spoke in the language almost lost in the land, but which a
  few&mdash;and they were always as rich in blood as in
  possessions&mdash;cherished in its purity, that they might be more certainly
  distinguished from Gentile peoples&mdash;the language in which the loved
  Rebekah and Rachel sang to Benjamin.</p>

  <p>The words appeared to set him thinking anew; after a while, however, he
  caught the hand with which she fanned him, and said, "Today, O my mother, I
  have been made to think of many things that never had place in my mind
  before. Tell me, first, what am I to be?"</p>

  <p>"Have I not told you? You are to be my hero."</p>

  <p>He could not see her face, yet he knew she was in play. He became more
  serious.</p>

  <p>"You are very good, very kind, O my mother. No one will ever love me as
  you do."</p>

  <p>He kissed the hand over and over again.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand why you would have me put off the question," he
  continued. "Thus far my life has belonged to you. How gentle, how sweet your
  control has been! I wish it could last forever. But that may not be. It is
  the Lord's will that I shall one day become owner of myself&mdash;a day of
  separation, and therefore a dreadful day to you. Let us be brave and serious.
  I will be your hero, but you must put me in the way. You know the
  law&mdash;every son of Israel must have some occupation. I am not exempt, and
  ask now, shall I tend the herds? or till the soil? or drive the saw? or be a
  clerk or lawyer? What shall I be? Dear, good mother, help me to an
  answer."</p>

  <p>"Gamaliel has been lecturing today," she said, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If so, I did not hear him."</p>

  <p>"Then you have been walking with Simeon, who, they tell me, inherits the
  genius of his family."</p>

  <p>"No, I have not seen him. I have been up on the Market-place, not to the
  Temple. I visited the young Messala."</p>

  <p>A certain change in his voice attracted the mother's attention. A
  presentiment quickened the beating of her heart; the fan became motionless
  again.</p>

  <p>"The Messala!" she said. "What could he say to so trouble you?"</p>

  <p>"He is very much changed."</p>

  <p>"You mean he has come back a Roman."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Roman!" she continued, half to herself. "To all the world the word means
  master. How long has he been away?"</p>

  <p>"Five years."</p>

  <p>She raised her head, and looked off into the night.</p>

  <p>"The airs of the Via Sacra are well enough in the streets of the Egyptian
  and in Babylon; but in Jerusalem&mdash;our Jerusalem&mdash;the covenant
  abides."</p>

  <p>And, full of the thought, she settled back into her easy place. He was
  first to speak.</p>

  <p>"What Messala said, my mother, was sharp enough in itself; but, taken with
  the manner, some of the sayings were intolerable."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand you. Rome, her poets, orators, senators, courtiers,
  are mad with affectation of what they call satire."</p>

  <p>"I suppose all great peoples are proud," he went on, scarcely noticing the
  interruption; "but the pride of that people is unlike all others; in these
  latter days it is so grown the gods barely escape it."</p>

  <p>"The gods escape!" said the mother, quickly. "More than one Roman has
  accepted worship as his divine right."</p>

  <p>"Well, Messala always had his share of the disagreeable quality. When he
  was a child, I have seen him mock strangers whom even Herod condescended to
  receive with honors; yet he always spared Judea. For the first time, in
  conversation with me to-day, he trifled with our customs and God. As you
  would have had me do, I parted with him finally. And now, O my dear mother, I
  would know with more certainty if there be just ground for the Roman's
  contempt. In what am I his inferior? Is ours a lower order of people? Why
  should I, even in Caesar's presence; feel the shrinking of a slave? Tell me
  especially why, if I have the soul, and so choose, I may not hunt the honors
  of the world in all its fields? Why may not I take sword and indulge the
  passion of war? As a poet, why may not I sing of all themes? I can be a
  worker in metals, a keeper of flocks, a merchant, why not an artist like the
  Greek? Tell me, O my mother&mdash;and this is the sum of my trouble&mdash;why
  may not a son of Israel do all a Roman may?"</p>

  <p>The reader will refer these questions back to the conversation in the
  Market-place; the mother, listening with all her faculties awake, from
  something which would have been lost upon one less interested in
  him&mdash;from the connections of the subject, the pointing of the questions,
  possibly his accent and tone&mdash;was not less swift in making the same
  reference. She sat up, and in a voice quick and sharp as his own, replied, "I
  see, I see! From association Messala, in boyhood, was almost a Jew; had he
  remained here, he might have become a proselyte, so much do we all borrow
  from the influences that ripen our lives; but the years in Rome have been too
  much for him. I do not wonder at the change; yet"&mdash;her voice
  fell&mdash;"he might have dealt tenderly at least with you. It is a hard,
  cruel nature which in youth can forget its first loves."</p>

  <p>Her hand dropped lightly upon his forehead, and the fingers caught in his
  hair and lingered there lovingly, while her eyes sought the highest stars in
  view. Her pride responded to his, not merely in echo, but in the unison of
  perfect sympathy. She would answer him; at the same time, not for the world
  would she have had the answer unsatisfactory: an admission of inferiority
  might weaken his spirit for life. She faltered with misgivings of her own
  powers.</p>

  <p>"What you propose, O my Judah, is not a subject for treatment by a woman.
  Let me put its consideration off till to-morrow, and I will have the wise
  Simeon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not send me to the Rector," he said, abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I will have him come to us."</p>

  <p>"No, I seek more than information; while he might give me that better than
  you, O my mother, you can do better by giving me what he cannot&mdash;the
  resolution which is the soul of a man's soul."</p>

  <p>She swept the heavens with a rapid glance, trying to compass all the
  meaning of his questions.</p>

  <p>"While craving justice for ourselves, it is never wise to be unjust to
  others. To deny valor in the enemy we have conquered is to underrate our
  victory; and if the enemy be strong enough to hold us at bay, much more to
  conquer us"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"self-respect bids us seek some other
  explanation of our misfortunes than accusing him of qualities inferior to our
  own."</p>

  <p>Thus, speaking to herself rather than to him, she began:</p>

  <p>"Take heart, O my son. The Messala is nobly descended; his family has been
  illustrious through many generations. In the days of Republican
  Rome&mdash;how far back I cannot tell&mdash;they were famous, some as
  soldiers, some as civilians. I can recall but one consul of the name; their
  rank was senatorial, and their patronage always sought because they were
  always rich. Yet if to-day your friend boasted of his ancestry, you might
  have shamed him by recounting yours. If he referred to the ages through which
  the line is traceable, or to deeds, rank, or wealth&mdash;such allusions,
  except when great occasion demands them, are tokens of small minds&mdash;if
  he mentioned them in proof of his superiority, then without dread, and
  standing on each particular, you might have challenged him to a comparison of
  records."</p>

  <p>Taking a moment's thought, the mother proceeded:</p>

  <p>"One of the ideas of fast hold now is that time has much to do with the
  nobility of races and families. A Roman boasting his superiority on that
  account over a son of Israel will always fail when put to the proof. The
  founding of Rome was his beginning; the very best of them cannot trace their
  descent beyond that period; few of them pretend to do so; and of such as do,
  I say not one could make good his claim except by resort to tradition.
  Messala certainly could not. Let us look now to ourselves. Could we
  better?"</p>

  <p>A little more light would have enabled him to see the pride that diffused
  itself over her face.</p>

  <p>"Let us imagine the Roman putting us to the challenge. I would answer him,
  neither doubting nor boastful."</p>

  <p>Her voice faltered; a tender thought changed the form of the argument.</p>

  <p>"Your father, O my Judah, is at rest with his fathers; yet I remember, as
  though it were this evening, the day he and I, with many rejoicing friends,
  went up into the Temple to present you to the Lord. We sacrificed the doves,
  and to the priest I gave your name, which he wrote in my
  presence&mdash;'Judah, son of Ithamar, of the House of Hur.' The name was
  then carried away, and written in a book of the division of records devoted
  to the saintly family.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you when the custom of registration in this mode began. We
  know it prevailed before the flight from Egypt. I have heard Hillel say
  Abraham caused the record to be first opened with his own name, and the names
  of his sons, moved by the promises of the Lord which separated him and them
  from all other races, and made them the highest and noblest, the very chosen
  of the earth. The covenant with Jacob was of like effect. 'In thy seed shall
  all the nations of the earth be blessed'&mdash;so said the angel to Abraham
  in the place Jehovah-jireh. 'And the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I
  give it, and to thy seed'&mdash;so the Lord himself said to Jacob asleep at
  Bethel on the way to Haran. Afterwards the wise men looked forward to a just
  division of the land of promise; and, that it might be known in the day of
  partition who were entitled to portions, the Book of Generations was begun.
  But not for that alone. The promise of a blessing to all the earth through
  the patriarch reached far into the future. One name was mentioned in
  connection with the blessing&mdash;the benefactor might be the humblest of
  the chosen family, for the Lord our God knows no distinctions of rank or
  riches. So, to make the performance clear to men of the generation who were
  to witness it, and that they might give the glory to whom it belonged, the
  record was required to be kept with absolute certainty. Has it been so
  kept?"</p>

  <p>The fan played to and fro, until, becoming impatient, he repeated the
  question, "Is the record absolutely true?"</p>

  <p>"Hillel said it was, and of all who have lived no one was so well-informed
  upon the subject. Our people have at times been heedless of some parts of the
  law, but never of this part. The good rector himself has followed the Books
  of Generations through three periods&mdash;from the promises to the opening
  of the Temple; thence to the Captivity; thence, again, to the present. Once
  only were the records disturbed, and that was at the end of the second
  period; but when the nation returned from the long exile, as a first duty to
  God, Zerubbabel restored the Books, enabling us once more to carry the lines
  of Jewish descent back unbroken fully two thousand years. And now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused as if to allow the hearer to measure the time comprehended in
  the statement.</p>

  <p>"And now," she continued, "what becomes of the Roman boast of blood
  enriched by ages? By that test, the sons of Israel watching the herds on old
  Rephaim yonder are nobler than the noblest of the Marcii."</p>

  <p>"And I, mother&mdash;by the Books, who am I?"</p>

  <p>"What I have said thus far, my son, had reference to your question. I will
  answer you. If Messala were here, he might say, as others have said, that the
  exact trace of your lineage stopped when the Assyrian took Jerusalem, and
  razed the Temple, with all its precious stores; but you might plead the pious
  action of Zerubbabel, and retort that all verity in Roman genealogy ended
  when the barbarians from the West took Rome, and camped six months upon her
  desolated site. Did the government keep family histories? If so, what became
  of them in those dreadful days? No, no; there is verity in our Books of
  Generations; and, following them back to the Captivity, back to the
  foundation of the first Temple, back to the march from Egypt, we have
  absolute assurance that you are lineally sprung from Hur, the associate of
  Joshua. In the matter of descent sanctified by time, is not the honor
  perfect? Do you care to pursue further? if so, take the Torah, and search the
  Book of Numbers, and of the seventy-two generations after Adam, you can find
  the very progenitor of your house."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a time in the chamber on the roof.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, O my mother," Judah next said, clasping both her hands in
  his; "I thank you with all my heart. I was right in not having the good
  rector called in; he could not have satisfied me more than you have. Yet to
  make a family truly noble, is time alone sufficient?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you forget, you forget; our claim rests not merely upon time; the
  Lord's preference is our especial glory."</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of the race, and I, mother, of the family&mdash;our
  family. In the years since Father Abraham, what have they achieved? What have
  they done? What great things to lift them above the level of their
  fellows?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, thinking she might all this time have mistaken his object.
  The information he sought might have been for more than satisfaction of
  wounded vanity. Youth is but the painted shell within which, continually
  growing, lives that wondrous thing the spirit of man, biding its moment of
  apparition, earlier in some than in others. She trembled under a perception
  that this might be the supreme moment come to him; that as children at birth
  reach out their untried hands grasping for shadows, and crying the while, so
  his spirit might, in temporary blindness, be struggling to take hold of its
  impalpable future. They to whom a boy comes asking, Who am I, and what am I
  to be? have need of ever so much care. Each word in answer may prove to the
  after-life what each finger-touch of the artist is to the clay he is
  modelling.</p>

  <p>"I have a feeling, O my Judah," she said, patting his cheek with the hand
  he had been caressing&mdash;"I have the feeling that all I have said has been
  in strife with an antagonist more real than imaginary. If Messala is the
  enemy, do not leave me to fight him in the dark. Tell me all he said."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch205"
     name="ch205"></a>V. &mdash; ROME AND ISRAEL&mdash;A COMPARISON</h2>

  <p class="first">The young Israelite proceeded then, and rehearsed his
  conversation with Messala, dwelling with particularity upon the latter's
  speeches in contempt of the Jews, their customs, and much pent round of
  life.</p>

  <p>Afraid to speak the while, the mother listened, discerning the matter
  plainly. Judah had gone to the palace on the Market-place, allured by love of
  a playmate whom he thought to find exactly as he had been at the parting
  years before; a man met him, and, in place of laughter and references to the
  sports of the past, the man had been full of the future, and talked of glory
  to be won, and of riches and power. Unconscious of the effect, the visitor
  had come away hurt in pride, yet touched with a natural ambition; but she,
  the jealous mother, saw it, and, not knowing the turn the aspiration might
  take, became at once Jewish in her fear. What if it lured him away from the
  patriarchal faith? In her view, that consequence was more dreadful than any
  or all others. She could discover but one way to avert it, and she set about
  the task, her native power reinforced by love to such degree that her speech
  took a masculine strength and at times a poet's fervor.</p>

  <p>"There never has been a people," she began, "who did not think themselves
  at least equal to any other; never a great nation, my son, that did not
  believe itself the very superior. When the Roman looks down upon Israel and
  laughs, he merely repeats the folly of the Egyptian, the Assyrian, and the
  Macedonian; and as the laugh is against God, the result will be the
  same."</p>

  <p>Her voice became firmer.</p>

  <p>"There is no law by which to determine the superiority of nations; hence
  the vanity of the claim, and the idleness of disputes about it. A people
  risen, run their race, and die either of themselves or at the hands of
  another, who, succeeding to their power, take possession of their place, and
  upon their monuments write new names; such is history. If I were called upon
  to symbolize God and man in the simplest form, I would draw a straight line
  and a circle, and of the line I would say, 'This is God, for he alone moves
  forever straightforward,' and of the circle, 'This is man&mdash;such is his
  progress.' I do not mean that there is no difference between the careers of
  nations; no two are alike. The difference, however, is not, as some say, in
  the extent of the circle they describe or the space of earth they cover, but
  in the sphere of their movement, the highest being nearest God.</p>

  <p>"To stop here, my son, would be to leave the subject where we began. Let
  us go on. There are signs by which to measure the height of the circle each
  nation runs while in its course. By them let us compare the Hebrew and the
  Roman.</p>

  <p>"The simplest of all the signs is the daily life of the people. Of this I
  will only say, Israel has at times forgotten God, while the Roman never knew
  him; consequently comparison is not possible.</p>

  <p>"Your friend&mdash;or your former friend&mdash;charged, if I understood
  you rightly, that we have had no poets, artists, or warriors; by which he
  meant, I suppose, to deny that we have had great men, the next most certain
  of the signs. A just consideration of this charge requires a definition at
  the commencement. A great man, O my boy, is one whose life proves him to have
  been recognized, if not called, by God. A Persian was used to punish our
  recreant fathers, and he carried them into captivity; another Persian was
  selected to restore their children to the Holy Land; greater than either of
  them, however, was the Macedonian through whom the desolation of Judea and
  the Temple was avenged. The special distinction of the men was that they were
  chosen by the Lord, each for a divine purpose; and that they were Gentiles
  does not lessen their glory. Do not lose sight of this definition while I
  proceed.</p>

  <p>"There is an idea that war is the most noble occupation of men, and that
  the most exalted greatness is the growth of battle-fields. Because the world
  has adopted the idea, be not you deceived. That we must worship something is
  a law which will continue as long as there is anything we cannot understand.
  The prayer of the barbarian is a wail of fear addressed to Strength, the only
  divine quality he can clearly conceive; hence his faith in heroes. What is
  Jove but a Roman hero? The Greeks have their great glory because they were
  the first to set Mind above Strength. In Athens the orator and philosopher
  were more revered than the warrior. The charioteer and the swiftest runner
  are still idols of the arena; yet the immortelles are reserved for the
  sweetest singer. The birthplace of one poet was contested by seven cities.
  But was the Hellene the first to deny the old barbaric faith? No. My son,
  that glory is ours; against brutalism our fathers erected God; in our
  worship, the wail of fear gave place to the Hosanna and the Psalm. So the
  Hebrew and the Greek would have carried all humanity forward and upward. But,
  alas! the government of the world presumes war as an eternal condition;
  wherefore, over Mind and above God, the Roman has enthroned his Caesar, the
  absorbent of all attainable power, the prohibition of any other
  greatness.</p>

  <p>"The sway of the Greek was a flowering time for genius. In return for the
  liberty it then enjoyed, what a company of thinkers the Mind led forth? There
  was a glory for every excellence, and a perfection so absolute that in
  everything but war even the Roman has stooped to imitation. A Greek is now
  the model of the orators in the Forum; listen, and in every Roman song you
  will hear the rhythm of the Greek; if a Roman opens his mouth speaking wisely
  of moralities, or abstractions, or of the mysteries of nature, he is either a
  plagiarist or the disciple of some school which had a Greek for its founder.
  In nothing but war, I say again, has Rome a claim to originality. Her games
  and spectacles are Greek inventions, dashed with blood to gratify the
  ferocity of her rabble; her religion, if such it may be called, is made up of
  contributions from the faiths of all other peoples; her most venerated gods
  are from Olympus&mdash;even her Mars, and, for that matter, the Jove she much
  magnifies. So it happens, O my son, that of the whole world our Israel alone
  can dispute the superiority of the Greek, and with him contest the palm of
  original genius.</p>

  <p>"To the excellences of other peoples the egotism of a Roman is a
  blindfold, impenetrable as his breastplate. Oh, the ruthless robbers! Under
  their trampling the earth trembles like a floor beaten with flails. Along
  with the rest we are fallen&mdash;alas that I should say it to you, my son!
  They have our highest places, and the holiest, and the end no man can tell;
  but this I know&mdash;they may reduce Judea as an almond broken with hammers,
  and devour Jerusalem, which is the oil and sweetness thereof; yet the glory
  of the men of Israel will remain a light in the heavens overhead out of
  reach: for their history is the history of God, who wrote with their hands,
  spake with their tongues, and was himself in all the good they did, even the
  least; who dwelt with them, a Lawgiver on Sinai, a Guide in the wilderness,
  in war a Captain, in government a King; who once and again pushed back the
  curtains of the pavilion which is his resting-place, intolerably bright, and,
  as a man speaking to men, showed them the right, and the way to happiness,
  and how they should live, and made them promises binding the strength of his
  Almightiness with covenants sworn to everlastingly. O my son, could it be
  that they with whom Jehovah thus dwelt, an awful familiar, derived nothing
  from him?&mdash;that in their lives and deeds the common human qualities
  should not in some degree have been mixed and colored with the divine? that
  their genius should not have in it, even after the lapse of ages, some little
  of heaven?"</p>

  <p>For a time the rustling of the fan was all the sound heard in the
  chamber.</p>

  <p>"In the sense which limits art to sculpture and painting, it is true," she
  next said, "Israel has had no artists."</p>

  <p>The admission was made regretfully, for it must be remembered she was a
  Sadducee, whose faith, unlike that of the Pharisees, permitted a love of the
  beautiful in every form, and without reference to its origin.</p>

  <p>"Still he who would do justice," she proceeded, "will not forget that the
  cunning of our hands was bound by the prohibition, 'Thou shalt not make unto
  thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything;' which the Sopherim
  wickedly extended beyond its purpose and time. Nor should it be forgotten
  that long before Daedalus appeared in Attica and with his wooden statues so
  transformed sculpture as to make possible the schools of Corinth and AEgina,
  and their ultimate triumphs the Poecile and Capitolium&mdash;long before the
  age of Daedalus, I say, two Israelites, Bezaleel and Aholiab, the
  master-builders of the first tabernacle, said to have been skilled 'in all
  manner of workmanship,' wrought the cherubim of the mercy-seat above the ark.
  Of gold beaten, not chiseled, were they; and they were statues in form both
  human and divine. 'And they shall stretch forth their wings on high, .... and
  their faces shall look one to another.' Who will say they were not beautiful?
  or that they were not the first statues?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see now why the Greek outstripped us," said Judah, intensely
  interested. "And the ark; accursed be the Babylonians who destroyed it!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Judah, be of faith. It was not destroyed, only lost, hidden away too
  safely in some cavern of the mountains. One day&mdash;Hillel and Shammai both
  say so&mdash;one day, in the Lord's good time, it will be found and brought
  forth, and Israel dance before it, singing as of old. And they who look upon
  the faces of the cherubim then, though they have seen the face of the ivory
  Minerva, will be ready to kiss the hand of the Jew from love of his genius,
  asleep through all the thousands of years."</p>

  <p>The mother, in her eagerness, had risen into something like the rapidity
  and vehemence of a speech-maker; but now, to recover herself, or to pick up
  the thread of her thought, she rested awhile.</p>

  <p>"You are so good, my mother," he said, in a grateful way. "And I will
  never be done saying so. Shammai could not have talked better, nor Hillel. I
  am a true son of Israel again."</p>

  <p>"Flatterer!" she said. "You do not know that I am but repeating what I
  heard Hillel say in an argument he had one day in my presence with a sophist
  from Rome."</p>

  <p>"Well, the hearty words are yours."</p>

  <p>Directly all her earnestness returned.</p>

  <p>"Where was I? Oh yes, I was claiming for our Hebrew fathers the first
  statues. The trick of the sculptor, Judah, is not all there is of art, any
  more than art is all there is of greatness. I always think of great men
  marching down the centuries in groups and goodly companies, separable
  according to nationalities; here the Indian, there the Egyptian, yonder the
  Assyrian; above them the music of trumpets and the beauty of banners; and on
  their right hand and left, as reverent spectators, the generations from the
  beginning, numberless. As they go, I think of the Greek, saying, 'Lo! The
  Hellene leads the way.' Then the Roman replies, 'Silence! what was your place
  is ours now; we have left you behind as dust trodden on.' And all the time,
  from the far front back over the line of march, as well as forward into the
  farthest future, streams a light of which the wranglers know nothing, except
  that it is forever leading them on&mdash;the Light of Revelation! Who are
  they that carry it? Ah, the old Judean blood! How it leaps at the thought! By
  the light we know them. Thrice blessed, O our fathers, servants of God,
  keepers of the covenants! Ye are the leaders of men, the living and the dead.
  The front is thine; and though every Roman were a Caesar, ye shall not lose
  it!"</p>

  <p>Judah was deeply stirred.</p>

  <p>"Do not stop, I pray you," he cried. "You give me to hear the sound of
  timbrels. I wait for Miriam and the women who went after her dancing and
  singing."</p>

  <p>She caught his feeling, and, with ready wit, wove it into her speech.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my son. If you can hear the timbrel of the prophetess, you can
  do what I was about to ask; you can use your fancy, and stand with me, as if
  by the wayside, while the chosen of Israel pass us at the head of the
  procession. Now they come&mdash;the patriarchs first; next the fathers of the
  tribes. I almost hear the bells of their camels and the lowing of their
  herds. Who is he that walks alone between the companies? An old man, yet his
  eye is not dim, nor his natural force abated. He knew the Lord face to face!
  Warrior, poet, orator, lawgiver, prophet, his greatness is as the sun at
  morning, its flood of splendor quenching all other lights, even that of the
  first and noblest of the Caesars. After him the judges. And then the
  kings&mdash;the son of Jesse, a hero in war, and a singer of songs eternal as
  that of the sea; and his son, who, passing all other kings in riches and
  wisdom, and while making the Desert habitable, and in its waste places
  planting cities, forgot not Jerusalem which the Lord had chosen for his seat
  on earth. Bend lower, my son! These that come next are the first of their
  kind, and the last. Their faces are raised, as if they heard a voice in the
  sky and were listening. Their lives were full of sorrows. Their garments
  smell of tombs and caverns. Hearken to a woman among them&mdash;'Sing ye to
  the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously!' Nay, put your forehead in the
  dust before them! They were tongues of God, his servants, who looked through
  heaven, and, seeing all the future, wrote what they saw, and left the writing
  to be proven by time. Kings turned pale as they approached them, and nations
  trembled at the sound of their voices. The elements waited upon them. In
  their hands they carried every bounty and every plague. See the Tishbite and
  his servant Elisha! See the sad son of Hilkiah, and him, the seer of visions,
  by the river of Chebar! And of the three children of Judah who refused the
  image of the Babylonian, lo! that one who, in the feast to the thousand
  lords, so confounded the astrologers. And yonder&mdash;O my son, kiss the
  dust again!&mdash;yonder the gentle son of Amoz, from whom the world has its
  promise of the Messiah to come!"</p>

  <p>In this passage the fan had been kept in rapid play; it stopped now, and
  her voice sank low.</p>

  <p>"You are tired," she said.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I was listening to a new song of Israel."</p>

  <p>The mother was still intent upon her purpose, and passed the pleasant
  speech.</p>

  <p>"In such light as I could, my Judah, I have set our great men before
  you&mdash;patriarchs, legislators, warriors, singers, prophets. Turn we to
  the best of Rome. Against Moses place Caesar, and Tarquin against David;
  Sylla against either of the Maccabees; the best of the consuls against the
  judges; Augustus against Solomon, and you are done: comparison ends there.
  But think then of the prophets&mdash;greatest of the great."</p>

  <p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me. I was thinking of the soothsayer who warned Caius Julius
  against the Ides of March, and fancied him looking for the omens of evil
  which his master despised in the entrails of a chicken. From that picture
  turn to Elijah sitting on the hill-top on the way to Samaria, amid the
  smoking bodies of the captains and their fifties, warning the son of Ahab of
  the wrath of our God. Finally, O my Judah&mdash;if such speech be
  reverent&mdash;how shall we judge Jehovah and Jupiter unless it be by what
  their servants have done in their names? And as for what you shall
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She spoke the latter words slowly, and with a tremulous utterance.</p>

  <p>"As for what you shall do, my boy&mdash;serve the Lord, the Lord God of
  Israel, not Rome. For a child of Abraham there is no glory except in the
  Lord's ways, and in them there is much glory."</p>

  <p>"I may be a soldier then?" Judah asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Did not Moses call God a man of war?"</p>

  <p>There was then a long silence in the summer chamber.</p>

  <p>"You have my permission," she said, finally; "if only you serve the Lord
  instead of Caesar."</p>

  <p>He was content with the condition, and by-and-by fell asleep. She arose
  then, and put the cushion under his head, and, throwing a shawl over him and
  kissing him tenderly, went away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch206"
     name="ch206"></a>VI. &mdash; THE ACCIDENT TO GRATUS</h2>

  <p class="first">The good man, like the bad, must die; but, remembering the
  lesson of our faith, we say of him and the event, "No matter, he will open
  his eyes in heaven." Nearest this in life is the waking from healthful sleep
  to a quick consciousness of happy sights and sounds.</p>

  <p>When Judah awoke, the sun was up over the mountains; the pigeons were
  abroad in flocks, filling the air with the gleams of their white wings; and
  off southeast he beheld the Temple, an apparition of gold in the blue of the
  sky. These, however, were familiar objects, and they received but a glance;
  upon the edge of the divan, close by him, a girl scarcely fifteen sat singing
  to the accompaniment of a nebel, which she rested upon her knee, and touched
  gracefully. To her he turned listening; and this was what she sang:</p>

  <h3>THE SONG</h3>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Wake not, but hear me, love!<br>
  Adrift, adrift on slumber's sea,<br>
  Thy spirit call to list to me.<br>
  Wake not, but hear me, love!<br>
  A gift from Sleep, the restful king,<br>
  All happy, happy dreams I bring.</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Wake not, but hear me, love!<br>
  Of all the world of dreams 'tis thine<br>
  This once to choose the most divine.<br>
  So choose, and sleep, my love!<br>
  But ne'er again in choice be free,<br>
  Unless, unless&mdash;thou dream'st of me."</p><br>

  <p>She put the instrument down, and, resting her hands in her lap, waited for
  him to speak. And as it has become necessary to tell somewhat of her, we will
  avail ourselves of the chance, and add such particulars of the family into
  whose privacy we are brought as the reader may wish to know.</p>

  <p>The favors of Herod had left surviving him many persons of vast estate.
  Where this fortune was joined to undoubted lineal descent from some famous
  son of one of the tribes, especially Judah, the happy individual was
  accounted a Prince of Jerusalem&mdash;a distinction which sufficed to bring
  him the homage of his less favored countrymen, and the respect, if nothing
  more, of the Gentiles with whom business and social circumstance brought him
  into dealing. Of this class none had won in private or public life a higher
  regard than the father of the lad whom we have been following. With a
  remembrance of his nationality which never failed him, he had yet been true
  to the king, and served him faithfully at home and abroad. Some offices had
  taken him to Rome, where his conduct attracted the notice of Augustus, who
  strove without reserve to engage his friendship. In his house, accordingly,
  were many presents, such as had gratified the vanity of kings&mdash;purple
  togas, ivory chairs, golden pateroe&mdash;chiefly valuable on account of the
  imperial hand which had honorably conferred them. Such a man could not fail
  to be rich; yet his wealth was not altogether the largess of royal patrons.
  He had welcomed the law that bound him to some pursuit; and, instead of one,
  he entered into many. Of the herdsmen watching flocks on the plains and
  hill-sides, far as old Lebanon, numbers reported to him as their employer; in
  the cities by the sea, and in those inland, he founded houses of traffic; his
  ships brought him silver from Spain, whose mines were then the richest known;
  while his caravans came twice a year from the East, laden with silks and
  spices. In faith he was a Hebrew, observant of the law and every essential
  rite; his place in the synagogue and Temple knew him well; he was thoroughly
  learned in the Scriptures; he delighted in the society of the
  college-masters, and carried his reverence for Hillel almost to the point of
  worship. Yet he was in no sense a Separatist; his hospitality took in
  strangers from every land; the carping Pharisees even accused him of having
  more than once entertained Samaritans at his table. Had he been a Gentile,
  and lived, the world might have heard of him as the rival of Herodes Atticus:
  as it was, he perished at sea some ten years before this second period of our
  story, in the prime of life, and lamented everywhere in Judea. We are already
  acquainted with two members of his family&mdash;his widow and son; the only
  other was a daughter&mdash;she whom we have seen singing to her brother.</p>

  <p>Tirzah was her name, and as the two looked at each other, their
  resemblance was plain. Her features had the regularity of his, and were of
  the same Jewish type; they had also the charm of childish innocency of
  expression. Home-life and its trustful love permitted the negligent attire in
  which she appeared. A chemise buttoned upon the right shoulder, and passing
  loosely over the breast and back and under the left arm, but half concealed
  her person above the waist, while it left the arms entirely nude. A girdle
  caught the folds of the garment, marking the commencement of the skirt. The
  coiffure was very simple and becoming&mdash;a silken cap, Tyrian-dyed; and
  over that a striped scarf of the same material, beautifully embroidered, and
  wound about in thin folds so as to show the shape of the head without
  enlarging it; the whole finished by a tassel dropping from the crown point of
  the cap. She had rings, ear and finger; anklets and bracelets, all of gold;
  and around her neck there was a collar of gold, curiously garnished with a
  network of delicate chains, to which were pendants of pearl. The edges of her
  eyelids were painted, and the tips of her fingers stained. Her hair fell in
  two long plaits down her back. A curled lock rested upon each cheek in front
  of the ear. Altogether it would have been impossible to deny her grace,
  refinement, and beauty.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty, my Tirzah, very pretty!" he said, with animation.</p>

  <p>"The song?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and the singer, too. It has the conceit of a Greek. Where did
  you get it?"</p>

  <p>"You remember the Greek who sang in the theatre last month? They said he
  used to be a singer at the court for Herod and his sister Salome. He came out
  just after an exhibition of wrestlers, when the house was full of noise. At
  his first note everything became so quiet that I heard every word. I got the
  song from him."</p>

  <p>"But he sang in Greek."</p>

  <p>"And I in Hebrew."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. I am proud of my little sister. Have you another as good?"</p>

  <p>"Very many. But let them go now. Amrah sent me to tell you she will bring
  you your breakfast, and that you need not come down. She should be here by
  this time. She thinks you sick&mdash;that a dreadful accident happened you
  yesterday. What was it? Tell me, and I will help Amrah doctor you. She knows
  the cures of the Egyptians, who were always a stupid set; but I have a great
  many recipes of the Arabs who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are even more stupid than the Egyptians," he said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? Very well, then," she replied, almost without pause, and
  putting her hands to her left ear. "We will have nothing to do with any of
  them. I have here what is much surer and better&mdash;the amulet which was
  given to some of our people&mdash;I cannot tell when, it was so far
  back&mdash;by a Persian magician. See, the inscription is almost worn
  out."</p>

  <p>She offered him the earring, which he took, looked at, and handed back,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"If I were dying, Tirzah, I could not use the charm. It is a relic of
  idolatry, forbidden every believing son and daughter of Abraham. Take it, but
  do not wear it any more."</p>

  <p>"Forbidden! Not so," she said. "Our father's mother wore it I do not know
  how many Sabbaths in her life. It has cured I do not know how many
  people&mdash;more than three anyhow. It is approved&mdash;look, here is the
  mark of the rabbis."</p>

  <p>"I have no faith in amulets."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to his in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What would Amrah say?"</p>

  <p>"Amrah's father and mother tended sakiyeh for a garden on the Nile."</p>

  <p>"But Gamaliel!"</p>

  <p>"He says they are godless inventions of unbelievers and Shechemites."</p>

  <p>Tirzah looked at the ring doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Wear it, my little sister. It becomes you&mdash;it helps make you
  beautiful, though I think you that without help."</p>

  <p>Satisfied, she returned the amulet to her ear just as Amrah entered the
  summer chamber, bearing a platter, with wash-bowl, water, and napkins.</p>

  <p>Not being a Pharisee, the ablution was short and simple with Judah. The
  servant then went out, leaving Tirzah to dress his hair. When a lock was
  disposed to her satisfaction, she would unloose the small metallic mirror
  which, as was the fashion among her fair countrywomen, she wore at her
  girdle, and gave it to him, that he might see the triumph, and how handsome
  it made him. Meanwhile they kept up their conversation.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Tirzah?&mdash;I am going away."</p>

  <p>She dropped her hands with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Going away! When? Where? For what?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Three questions, all in a breath! What a body you are!" Next instant he
  became serious. "You know the law requires me to follow some occupation. Our
  good father set me an example. Even you would despise me if I spent in
  idleness the results of his industry and knowledge. I am going to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will go with you."</p>

  <p>"You must stay with mother. If both of us leave her she will die."</p>

  <p>The brightness faded from her face.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, yes! But&mdash;must you go? Here in Jerusalem you can learn all
  that is needed to be a merchant&mdash;if that is what you are thinking
  of."</p>

  <p>"But that is not what I am thinking of. The law does not require the son
  to be what the father was."</p>

  <p>"What else can you be?"</p>

  <p>"A soldier," he replied, with a certain pride of voice.</p>

  <p>Tears came into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You will be killed."</p>

  <p>"If God's will, be it so. But, Tirzah, the soldiers are not all
  killed."</p>

  <p>She threw her arms around his neck, as if to hold him back.</p>

  <p>"We are so happy! Stay at home, my brother."</p>

  <p>"Home cannot always be what it is. You yourself will be going away before
  long."</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her earnestness.</p>

  <p>"A prince of Judah, or some other of one of the tribes, will come soon and
  claim my Tirzah, and ride away with her, to be the light of another house.
  What will then become of me?"</p>

  <p>She answered with sobs.</p>

  <p>"War is a trade," he continued, more soberly. "To learn it thoroughly, one
  must go to school, and there is no school like a Roman camp."</p>

  <p>"You would not fight for Rome?" she asked, holding her breath.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;even you hate her. The whole world hates her. In that, O
  Tirzah, find the reason of the answer I give you&mdash; Yes, I will fight for
  her, if, in return, she will teach me how one day to fight against her."</p>

  <p>"When will you go?"</p>

  <p>Amrah's steps were then heard returning.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" he said. "Do not let her know of what I am thinking."</p>

  <p>The faithful slave came in with breakfast, and placed the waiter holding
  it upon a stool before them; then, with white napkins upon her arm, she
  remained to serve them. They dipped their fingers in a bowl of water, and
  were rinsing them, when a noise arrested their attention. They listened, and
  distinguished martial music in the street on the north side of the house.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers from the Praetorium! I must see them," he cried, springing from
  the divan, and running out.</p>

  <p>In a moment more he was leaning over the parapet of tiles which guarded
  the roof at the extreme northeast corner, so absorbed that he did not notice
  Tirzah by his side, resting one hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Their position&mdash;the roof being the highest one in the
  locality&mdash;commanded the house-tops eastward as far as the huge irregular
  Tower of Antonia, which has been already mentioned as a citadel for the
  garrison and military headquarters for the governor. The street, not more
  than ten feet wide, was spanned here and there by bridges, open and covered,
  which, like the roofs along the way, were beginning to be occupied by men,
  women, and children, called out by the music. The word is used, though it is
  hardly fitting; what the people heard when they came forth was rather an
  uproar of trumpets and the shriller litui so delightful to the soldiers.</p>

  <p>The array after a while came into view of the two upon the house of the
  Hurs. First, a vanguard of the light-armed&mdash;mostly slingers and
  bowmen&mdash;marching with wide intervals between their ranks and files; next
  a body of heavy-armed infantry, bearing large shields, and hastoe longoe, or
  spears identical with those used in the duels before Ilium; then the
  musicians; and then an officer riding alone, but followed closely by a guard
  of cavalry; after them again, a column of infantry also heavy-armed, which,
  moving in close order, crowded the streets from wall to wall, and appeared to
  be without end.</p>

  <p>The brawny limbs of the men; the cadenced motion from right to left of the
  shields; the sparkle of scales, buckles, and breastplates and helms, all
  perfectly burnished; the plumes nodding above the tall crests; the sway of
  ensigns and iron-shod spears; the bold, confident step, exactly timed and
  measured; the demeanor, so grave, yet so watchful; the machine-like unity of
  the whole moving mass&mdash;made an impression upon Judah, but as something
  felt rather than seen. Two objects fixed his attention&mdash;the eagle of the
  legion first&mdash;a gilded effigy perched on a tall shaft, with wings
  outspread until they met above its head. He knew that, when brought from its
  chamber in the Tower, it had been received with divine honors.</p>

  <p>The officer riding alone in the midst of the column was the other
  attraction. His head was bare; otherwise he was in full armor. At his left
  hip he wore a short sword; in his hand, however, he carried a truncheon,
  which looked like a roll of white paper. He sat upon a purple cloth instead
  of a saddle, and that, and a bridle with a forestall of gold and reins of
  yellow silk broadly fringed at the lower edge, completed the housings of the
  horse.</p>

  <p>While the man was yet in the distance, Judah observed that his presence
  was sufficient to throw the people looking at him into angry excitement. They
  would lean over the parapets or stand boldly out, and shake their fists at
  him; they followed him with loud cries, and spit at him as he passed under
  the bridges; the women even flung their sandals, sometimes with such good
  effect as to hit him. When he was nearer, the yells became
  distinguishable&mdash;"Robber, tyrant, dog of a Roman! Away with Ishmael!
  Give us back our Hannas!"</p>

  <p>When quite near, Judah could see that, as was but natural, the man did not
  share the indifference so superbly shown by the soldiers; his face was dark
  and sullen, and the glances he occasionally cast at his persecutors were full
  of menace; the very timid shrank from them.</p>

  <p>Now the lad had heard of the custom, borrowed from a habit of the first
  Caesar, by which chief commanders, to indicate their rank, appeared in public
  with only a laurel vine upon their heads. By that sign he knew this
  officer&mdash;VALERIUS GRATUS, THE NEW PROCURATOR OF JUDEA!</p>

  <p>To say truth now, the Roman under the unprovoked storm had the young Jew's
  sympathy; so that when he reached the corner of the house, the latter leaned
  yet farther over the parapet to see him go by, and in the act rested a hand
  upon a tile which had been a long time cracked and allowed to go unnoticed.
  The pressure was strong enough to displace the outer piece, which started to
  fall. A thrill of horror shot through the youth. He reached out to catch the
  missile. In appearance the motion was exactly that of one pitching something
  from him. The effort failed&mdash;nay, it served to push the descending
  fragment farther out over the wall. He shouted with all his might. The
  soldiers of the guard looked up; so did the great man, and that moment the
  missile struck him, and he fell from his seat as dead.</p>

  <p>The cohort halted; the guards leaped from their horses, and hastened to
  cover the chief with their shields. On the other hand, the people who
  witnessed the affair, never doubting that the blow had been purposely dealt,
  cheered the lad as he yet stooped in full view over the parapet, transfixed
  by what he beheld, and by anticipation of the consequences flashed all too
  plainly upon him.</p>

  <p>A mischievous spirit flew with incredible speed from roof to roof along
  the line of march, seizing the people, and urging them all alike. They laid
  hands upon the parapets and tore up the tiling and the sunburnt mud of which
  the house-tops were for the most part made, and with blind fury began to
  fling them upon the legionaries halted below. A battle then ensued.
  Discipline, of course, prevailed. The struggle, the slaughter, the skill of
  one side, the desperation of the other, are alike unnecessary to our story.
  Let us look rather to the wretched author of it all.</p>

  <p>He arose from the parapet, his face very pale.</p>

  <p>"O Tirzah, Tirzah! What will become of us?"</p>

  <p>She had not seen the occurrence below, but was listening to the shouting
  and watching the mad activity of the people in view on the houses. Something
  terrible was going on, she knew; but what it was, or the cause, or that she
  or any of those dear to her were in danger, she did not know.</p>

  <p>"What has happened? What does it all mean?" she asked, in sudden
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"I have killed the Roman governor. The tile fell upon him."</p>

  <p>An unseen hand appeared to sprinkle her face with the dust of
  ashes&mdash;it grew white so instantly. She put her arm around him, and
  looked wistfully, but without a word, into his eyes. His fears had passed to
  her, and the sight of them gave him strength.</p>

  <p>"I did not do it purposely, Tirzah&mdash;it was an accident," he said,
  more calmly.</p>

  <p>"What will they do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked off over the tumult momentarily deepening in the street and on
  the roofs, and thought of the sullen countenance of Gratus. If he were not
  dead, where would his vengeance stop? And if he were dead, to what height of
  fury would not the violence of the people lash the legionaries? To evade an
  answer, he peered over the parapet again, just as the guard were assisting
  the Roman to remount his horse.</p>

  <p>"He lives, he lives, Tirzah! Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers!"</p>

  <p>With that outcry, and a brightened countenance, he drew back and replied
  to her question.</p>

  <p>"Be not afraid, Tirzah. I will explain how it happened, and they will
  remember our father and his services, and not hurt us."</p>

  <p>He was leading her to the summer-house, when the roof jarred under their
  feet, and a crash of strong timbers being burst away, followed by a cry of
  surprise and agony, arose apparently from the court-yard below. He stopped
  and listened. The cry was repeated; then came a rush of many feet, and voices
  lifted in rage blent with voices in prayer; and then the screams of women in
  mortal terror. The soldiers had beaten in the north gate, and were in
  possession of the house. The terrible sense of being hunted smote him. His
  first impulse was to fly; but where? Nothing but wings would serve him.
  Tirzah, her eyes wild with fear, caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"O Judah, what does it mean?"</p>

  <p>The servants were being butchered&mdash;and his mother! Was not one of the
  voices he heard hers? With all the will left him, he said, "Stay here, and
  wait for me, Tirzah. I will go down and see what is the matter, and come back
  to you."</p>

  <p>His voice was not steady as he wished. She clung closer to him.</p>

  <p>Clearer, shriller, no longer a fancy, his mother's cry arose. He hesitated
  no longer.</p>

  <p>"Come, then, let us go."</p>

  <p>The terrace or gallery at the foot of the steps was crowded with soldiers.
  Other soldiers with drawn swords ran in and out of the chambers. At one place
  a number of women on their knees clung to each other or prayed for mercy.
  Apart from them, one with torn garments, and long hair streaming over her
  face, struggled to tear loose from a man all whose strength was tasked to
  keep his hold. Her cries were shrillest of all; cutting through the clamor,
  they had risen distinguishably to the roof. To her Judah sprang&mdash;his
  steps were long and swift, almost a winged flight&mdash;"Mother, mother!" he
  shouted. She stretched her hands towards him; but when almost touching them
  he was seized and forced aside. Then he heard some one say, speaking
  loudly,</p>

  <p>"That is he!"</p>

  <p>Judah looked, and saw&mdash;Messala.</p>

  <p>"What, the assassin&mdash;that?" said a tall man, in legionary armor of
  beautiful finish. "Why, he is but a boy."</p>

  <p>"Gods!" replied Messala, not forgetting his drawl. "A new philosophy! What
  would Seneca say to the proposition that a man must be old before he can hate
  enough to kill? You have him; and that is his mother; yonder his sister. You
  have the whole family."</p>

  <p>For love of them, Judah forgot his quarrel.</p>

  <p>"Help them, O my Messala! Remember our childhood and help them.
  I&mdash;Judah&mdash;pray you."</p>

  <p>Messala affected not to hear.</p>

  <p>"I cannot be of further use to you," he said to the officer. "There is
  richer entertainment in the street. Down Eros, up Mars!"</p>

  <p>With the last words he disappeared. Judah understood him, and, in the
  bitterness of his soul, prayed to Heaven.</p>

  <p>"In the hour of thy vengeance, O Lord," he said, "be mine the hand to put
  it upon him!"</p>

  <p>By great exertion, he drew nearer the officer.</p>

  <p>"O sir, the woman you hear is my mother. Spare her, spare my sister
  yonder. God is just, he will give you mercy for mercy."</p>

  <p>The man appeared to be moved.</p>

  <p>"To the Tower with the women!" he shouted, "but do them no harm. I will
  demand them of you." Then to those holding Judah, he said, "Get cords, and
  bind his hands, and take him to the street. His punishment is reserved."</p>

  <p>The mother was carried away. The little Tirzah, in her home attire,
  stupefied with fear, went passively with her keepers. Judah gave each of them
  a last look, and covered his face with his hands, as if to possess himself of
  the scene fadelessly. He may have shed tears, though no one saw them.</p>

  <p>There took place in him then what may be justly called the wonder of life.
  The thoughtful reader of these pages has ere this discerned enough to know
  that the young Jew in disposition was gentle even to womanliness&mdash;a
  result that seldom fails the habit of loving and being loved. The
  circumstances through which he had come had made no call upon the harsher
  elements of his nature, if such he had. At times he had felt the stir and
  impulses of ambition, but they had been like the formless dreams of a child
  walking by the sea and gazing at the coming and going of stately ships. But
  now, if we can imagine an idol, sensible of the worship it was accustomed to,
  dashed suddenly from its altar, and lying amidst the wreck of its little
  world of love, an idea may be had of what had befallen the young Ben-Hur, and
  of its effect upon his being. Yet there was no sign, nothing to indicate that
  he had undergone a change, except that when he raised his head, and held his
  arms out to be bound, the bend of the Cupid's bow had vanished from his lips.
  In that instant he had put off childhood and become a man.</p>

  <p>A trumpet sounded in the court-yard. With the cessation of the call, the
  gallery was cleared of the soldiery; many of whom, as they dared not appear
  in the ranks with visible plunder in their hands, flung what they had upon
  the floor, until it was strewn with articles of richest virtu. When Judah
  descended, the formation was complete, and the officer waiting to see his
  last order executed.</p>

  <p>The mother, daughter, and entire household were led out of the north gate,
  the ruins of which choked the passageway. The cries of the domestics, some of
  whom had been born in the house, were most pitiable. When, finally, the
  horses and all the dumb tenantry of the place were driven past him, Judah
  began to comprehend the scope of the procurator's vengeance. The very
  structure was devoted. Far as the order was possible of execution, nothing
  living was to be left within its walls. If in Judea there were others
  desperate enough to think of assassinating a Roman governor, the story of
  what befell the princely family of Hur would be a warning to them, while the
  ruin of the habitation would keep the story alive.</p>

  <p>The officer waited outside while a detail of men temporarily restored the
  gate.</p>

  <p>In the street the fighting had almost ceased. Upon the houses here and
  there clouds of dust told where the struggle was yet prolonged. The cohort
  was, for the most part, standing at rest, its splendor, like its ranks, in
  nowise diminished. Borne past the point of care for himself, Judah had heart
  for nothing in view but the prisoners, among whom he looked in vain for his
  mother and Tirzah.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, from the earth where she had been lying, a woman arose and
  started swiftly back to the gate. Some of the guards reached out to seize
  her, and a great shout followed their failure. She ran to Judah, and,
  dropping down, clasped his knees, the coarse black hair powdered with dust
  veiling her eyes.</p>

  <p>"O Amrah, good Amrah," he said to her, "God help you; I cannot."</p>

  <p>She could not speak.</p>

  <p>He bent down, and whispered, "Live, Amrah, for Tirzah and my mother. They
  will come back, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A soldier drew her away; whereupon she sprang up and rushed through the
  gateway and passage into the vacant court-yard.</p>

  <p>"Let her go," the officer shouted. "We will seal the house, and she will
  starve."</p>

  <p>The men resumed their work, and, when it was finished there, passed round
  to the west side. That gate was also secured, after which the palace of the
  Hurs was lost to use.</p>

  <p>The cohort at length marched back to the Tower, where the procurator
  stayed to recover from his hurts and dispose of his prisoners. On the tenth
  day following, he visited the Market-place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch207"
     name="ch207"></a>VII. &mdash; A GALLEY SLAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">Next day a detachment of legionaries went to the desolated
  palace, and, closing the gates permanently, plastered the corners with wax,
  and at the sides nailed a notice in Latin:</p>

  <p class="sign">"This Is the Property of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>In the haughty Roman idea, the sententious announcement was thought
  sufficient for the purpose&mdash;and it was.</p>

  <p>The day after that again, about noon, a decurion with his command of ten
  horsemen approached Nazareth from the south&mdash;that is, from the direction
  of Jerusalem. The place was then a straggling village, perched on a
  hill-side, and so insignificant that its one street was little more than a
  path well beaten by the coming and going of flocks and herds. The great plain
  of Esdraelon crept close to it on the south, and from the height on the west
  a view could be had of the shores of the Mediterranean, the region beyond the
  Jordan, and Hermon. The valley below, and the country on every side, were
  given to gardens, vineyards, orchards, and pasturage. Groves of palm-trees
  Orientalized the landscape. The houses, in irregular assemblage, were of the
  humbler class&mdash;square, one-story, flat-roofed, and covered with
  bright-green vines. The drought that had burned the hills of Judea to a
  crisp, brown and lifeless, stopped at the boundary-line of Galilee.</p>

  <p>A trumpet, sounded when the cavalcade drew near the village, had a magical
  effect upon the inhabitants. The gates and front doors cast forth groups
  eager to be the first to catch the meaning of a visitation so unusual.</p>

  <p>Nazareth, it must be remembered, was not only aside from any great
  highway, but within the sway of Judas of Gamala; wherefore it should not be
  hard to imagine the feelings with which the legionaries were received. But
  when they were up and traversing the street, the duty that occupied them
  became apparent, and then fear and hatred were lost in curiosity, under the
  impulse of which the people, knowing there must be a halt at the well in the
  northeastern part of the town, quit their gates and doors, and closed in
  after the procession.</p>

  <p>A prisoner whom the horsemen were guarding was the object of curiosity. He
  was afoot, bareheaded, half naked, his hands bound behind him. A thong fixed
  to his wrists was looped over the neck of a horse. The dust went with the
  party when in movement, wrapping him in yellow fog, sometimes in a dense
  cloud. He drooped forward, footsore and faint. The villagers could see he was
  young.</p>

  <p>At the well the decurion halted, and, with most of the men, dismounted.
  The prisoner sank down in the dust of the road, stupefied, and asking
  nothing: apparently he was in the last stage of exhaustion. Seeing, when they
  came near, that he was but a boy, the villagers would have helped him had
  they dared.</p>

  <p>In the midst of their perplexity, and while the pitchers were passing
  among the soldiers, a man was descried coming down the road from Sepphoris.
  At sight of him a woman cried out, "Look! Yonder comes the carpenter. Now we
  will hear something."</p>

  <p>The person spoken of was quite venerable in appearance. Thin white locks
  fell below the edge of his full turban, and a mass of still whiter beard
  flowed down the front of his coarse gray gown. He came slowly, for, in
  addition to his age, he carried some tools&mdash;an axe, a saw, and a
  drawing-knife, all very rude and heavy&mdash;and had evidently travelled some
  distance without rest.</p>

  <p>He stopped close by to survey the assemblage.</p>

  <p>"O Rabbi, good Rabbi Joseph!" cried a woman, running to him. "Here is a
  prisoner; come ask the soldiers about him, that we may know who he is, and
  what he has done, and what they are going to do with him."</p>

  <p>The rabbi's face remained stolid; he glanced at the prisoner, however, and
  presently went to the officer.</p>

  <p>"The peace of the Lord be with you!" he said, with unbending gravity.</p>

  <p>"And that of the gods with you," the decurion replied.</p>

  <p>"Are you from Jerusalem?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Your prisoner is young."</p>

  <p>"In years, yes."</p>

  <p>"May I ask what he has done?"</p>

  <p>"He is an assassin."</p>

  <p>The people repeated the word in astonishment, but Rabbi Joseph pursued his
  inquest.</p>

  <p>"Is he a son of Israel?"</p>

  <p>"He is a Jew," said the Roman, dryly.</p>

  <p>The wavering pity of the bystanders came back.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of your tribes, but can speak of his family," the speaker
  continued. "You may have heard of a prince of Jerusalem named
  Hur&mdash;Ben-Hur, they called him. He lived in Herod's day."</p>

  <p>"I have seen him," Joseph said.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is his son."</p>

  <p>Exclamations became general, and the decurion hastened to stop them.</p>

  <p>"In the streets of Jerusalem, day before yesterday, he nearly killed the
  noble Gratus by flinging a tile upon his head from the roof of a
  palace&mdash;his father's, I believe."</p>

  <p>There was a pause in the conversation during which the Nazarenes gazed at
  the young Ben-Hur as at a wild beast.</p>

  <p>"Did he kill him?" asked the rabbi.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"He is under sentence."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the galleys for life."</p>

  <p>"The Lord help him!" said Joseph, for once moved out of his stolidity.</p>

  <p>Thereupon a youth who came up with Joseph, but had stood behind him
  unobserved, laid down an axe he had been carrying, and, going to the great
  stone standing by the well, took from it a pitcher of water. The action was
  so quiet that before the guard could interfere, had they been disposed to do
  so, he was stooping over the prisoner, and offering him drink.</p>

  <p>The hand laid kindly upon his shoulder awoke the unfortunate Judah, and,
  looking up, he saw a face he never forgot&mdash;the face of a boy about his
  own age, shaded by locks of yellowish bright chestnut hair; a face lighted by
  dark-blue eyes, at the time so soft, so appealing, so full of love and holy
  purpose, that they had all the power of command and will. The spirit of the
  Jew, hardened though it was by days and nights of suffering, and so
  embittered by wrong that its dreams of revenge took in all the world, melted
  under the stranger's look, and became as a child's. He put his lips to the
  pitcher, and drank long and deep. Not a word was said to him, nor did he say
  a word.</p>

  <p>When the draught was finished, the hand that had been resting upon the
  sufferer's shoulder was placed upon his head, and stayed there in the dusty
  locks time enough to say a blessing; the stranger then returned the pitcher
  to its place on the stone, and, taking his axe again, went back to Rabbi
  Joseph. All eyes went with him, the decurion's as well as those of the
  villagers.</p>

  <p>This was the end of the scene at the well. When the men had drunk, and the
  horses, the march was resumed. But the temper of the decurion was not as it
  had been; he himself raised the prisoner from the dust, and helped him on a
  horse behind a soldier. The Nazarenes went to their houses&mdash;among them
  Rabbi Joseph and his apprentice.</p>

  <p>And so, for the first time, Judah and the son of Mary met and parted.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch301"
     name="ch301"></a>I. &mdash; QUINTUS ARRIUS GOES TO SEA</h2>

  <p class="first">The city of Misenum gave name to the promontory which it
  crowned, a few miles southwest of Naples. An account of ruins is all that
  remains of it now; yet in the year of our Lord 24&mdash;to which it is
  desirable to advance the reader&mdash;the place was one of the most important
  on the western coast of Italy.[1]</p>

  <p>[1] The Roman government, it will be remembered, had two harbors in which
  great fleets were constantly kept&mdash;Ravenna and Misenum.</p>

  <p>In the year mentioned, a traveller coming to the promontory to regale
  himself with the view there offered, would have mounted a wall, and, with the
  city at his back, looked over the bay of Neapolis, as charming then as now;
  and then, as now, he would have seen the matchless shore, the smoking cone,
  the sky and waves so softly, deeply blue, Ischia here and Capri yonder; from
  one to the other and back again, through the purpled air, his gaze would have
  sported; at last&mdash;for the eyes do weary of the beautiful as the palate
  with sweets&mdash;at last it would have dropped upon a spectacle which the
  modern tourist cannot see&mdash;half the reserve navy of Rome astir or at
  anchor below him. Thus regarded, Misenum was a very proper place for three
  masters to meet, and at leisure parcel the world among them.</p>

  <p>In the old time, moreover, there was a gateway in the wall at a certain
  point fronting the sea&mdash;an empty gateway forming the outlet of a street
  which, after the exit, stretched itself, in the form of a broad mole, out
  many stadia into the waves.</p>

  <p>The watchman on the wall above the gateway was disturbed, one cool
  September morning, by a party coming down the street in noisy conversation.
  He gave one look, then settled into his drowse again.</p>

  <p>There were twenty or thirty persons in the party, of whom the greater
  number were slaves with torches, which flamed little and smoked much, leaving
  on the air the perfume of the Indian nard. The masters walked in advance
  arm-in-arm. One of them, apparently fifty years old, slightly bald, and
  wearing over his scant locks a crown of laurel, seemed, from the attentions
  paid him, the central object of some affectionate ceremony. They all sported
  ample togas of white wool broadly bordered with purple. A glance had sufficed
  the watchman. He knew, without question, they were of high rank, and
  escorting a friend to ship after a night of festivity. Further explanation
  will be found in the conversation they carried on.</p>

  <p>"No, my Quintus," said one, speaking to him with the crown, "it is ill of
  Fortune to take thee from us so soon. Only yesterday thou didst return from
  the seas beyond the Pillars. Why, thou hast not even got back thy land
  legs."</p>

  <p>"By Castor! if a man may swear a woman's oath," said another, somewhat
  worse of wine, "let us not lament. Our Quintus is but going to find what he
  lost last night. Dice on a rolling ship is not dice on shore&mdash;eh,
  Quintus?"</p>

  <p>"Abuse not Fortune!" exclaimed a third. "She is not blind or fickle. At
  Antium, where our Arrius questions her, she answers him with nods, and at sea
  she abides with him holding the rudder. She takes him from us, but does she
  not always give him back with a new victory?"</p>

  <p>"The Greeks are taking him away," another broke in. "Let us abuse them,
  not the gods. In learning to trade they forgot how to fight."</p>

  <p>With these words, the party passed the gateway, and came upon the mole,
  with the bay before them beautiful in the morning light. To the veteran
  sailor the plash of the waves was like a greeting. He drew a long breath, as
  if the perfume of the water were sweeter than that of the nard, and held his
  hand aloft.</p>

  <p>"My gifts were at Praeneste, not Antium&mdash;and see! Wind from the west.
  Thanks, O Fortune, my mother!" he said, earnestly.</p>

  <p>The friends all repeated the exclamation, and the slaves waved their
  torches.</p>

  <p>"She comes&mdash;yonder!" he continued, pointing to a galley outside the
  mole. "What need has a sailor for other mistress? Is your Lucrece more
  graceful, my Caius?"</p>

  <p>He gazed at the coming ship, and justified his pride. A white sail was
  bent to the low mast, and the oars dipped, arose, poised a moment, then
  dipped again, with wing-like action, and in perfect time.</p>

  <p>"Yes, spare the gods," he said, soberly, his eyes fixed upon the vessel.
  "They send us opportunities. Ours the fault if we fail. And as for the
  Greeks, you forget, O my Lentulus, the pirates I am going to punish are
  Greeks. One victory over them is of more account than a hundred over the
  Africans."</p>

  <p>"Then thy way is to the Aegean?"</p>

  <p>The sailor's eyes were full of his ship.</p>

  <p>"What grace, what freedom! A bird hath not less care for the fretting of
  the waves. See!" he said, but almost immediately added, "Thy pardon, my
  Lentulus. I am going to the Aegean; and as my departure is so near, I will
  tell the occasion&mdash;only keep it under the rose. I would not that you
  abuse the duumvir when next you meet him. He is my friend. The trade between
  Greece and Alexandria, as ye may have heard, is hardly inferior to that
  between Alexandria and Rome. The people in that part of the world forgot to
  celebrate the Cerealia, and Triptolemus paid them with a harvest not worth
  the gathering. At all events, the trade is so grown that it will not brook
  interruption a day. Ye may also have heard of the Chersonesan pirates, nested
  up in the Euxine; none bolder, by the Bacchae! Yesterday word came to Rome
  that, with a fleet, they had rowed down the Bosphorus, sunk the galleys off
  Byzantium and Chalcedon, swept the Propontis, and, still unsated, burst
  through into the Aegean. The corn-merchants who have ships in the East
  Mediterranean are frightened. They had audience with the Emperor himself, and
  from Ravenna there go to-day a hundred galleys, and from Misenum"&mdash;he
  paused as if to pique the curiosity of his friends, and ended with an
  emphatic&mdash;"one."</p>

  <p>"Happy Quintus! We congratulate thee!"</p>

  <p>"The preferment forerunneth promotion. We salute thee duumvir; nothing
  less."</p>

  <p>"Quintus Arrius, the duumvir, hath a better sound than Quintus Arrius, the
  tribune."</p>

  <p>In such manner they showered him with congratulations.</p>

  <p>"I am glad with the rest," said the bibulous friend, "very glad; but I
  must be practical, O my duumvir; and not until I know if promotion will help
  thee to knowledge of the tesserae will I have an opinion as to whether the
  gods mean thee ill or good in this&mdash;this business."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, many thanks!" Arrius replied, speaking to them collectively. "Had
  ye but lanterns, I would say ye were augurs. Perpol! I will go further, and
  show what master diviners ye are! See&mdash;and read."</p>

  <p>From the folds of his toga he drew a roll of paper, and passed it to them,
  saying, "Received while at table last night from&mdash;Sejanus."</p>

  <p>The name was already a great one in the Roman world; great, and not so
  infamous as it afterwards became.</p>

  <p>"Sejanus!" they exclaimed, with one voice, closing in to read what the
  minister had written.</p>

  <p>"Sejanus to C. Coecilius Rufus, Duumvir.</p>

  <p>"ROME, XIX. Kal. Sept.</p>

  <p>"Caesar hath good report of Quintus Arrius, the tribune. In particular he
  bath heard of his valor, manifested in the western seas, insomuch that it is
  his will that the said Quintus be transferred instantly to the East.</p>

  <p>"It is our Caesar's will, further, that you cause a hundred triremes, of
  the first class, and full appointment, to be despatched without delay against
  the pirates who have appeared in the Aegean, and that Quintus be sent to
  command the fleet so despatched.</p>

  <p>"Details are thine, my Caecilius.</p>

  <p>"The necessity is urgent, as thou will be advised by the reports enclosed
  for thy perusal and the information of the said Quintus.</p>

  <p>"SEJANUS."</p>

  <p>Arrius gave little heed to the reading. As the ship drew more plainly out
  of the perspective, she became more and more an attraction to him. The look
  with which he watched her was that of an enthusiast. At length he tossed the
  loosened folds of his toga in the air; in reply to the signal, over the
  aplustre, or fan-like fixture at the stern of the vessel, a scarlet flag was
  displayed; while several sailors appeared upon the bulwarks, and swung
  themselves hand over hand up the ropes to the antenna, or yard, and furled
  the sail. The bow was put round, and the time of the oars increased one half;
  so that at racing speed she bore down directly towards him and his friends.
  He observed the manoeuvring with a perceptible brightening of the eyes. Her
  instant answer to the rudder, and the steadiness with which she kept her
  course, were especially noticeable as virtues to be relied upon in
  action.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"By the Nymphae!" said one of the friends, giving back the roll, "we may
  not longer say our friend will be great; he is already great. Our love will
  now have famous things to feed upon. What more hast thou for us?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more," Arrius replied. "What ye have of the affair is by this
  time old news in Rome, especially between the palace and the Forum. The
  duumvir is discreet; what I am to do, where go to find my fleet, he will tell
  on the ship, where a sealed package is waiting me. If, however, ye have
  offerings for any of the altars to-day, pray the gods for a friend plying oar
  and sail somewhere in the direction of Sicily. But she is here, and will come
  to," he said, reverting to the vessel. "I have interest in her masters; they
  will sail and fight with me. It is not an easy thing to lay ship side on a
  shore like this; so let us judge their training and skill."</p>

  <p>"What, is she new to thee?"</p>

  <p>"I never saw her before; and, as yet, I know not if she will bring me one
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Is that well?"</p>

  <p>"It matters but little. We of the sea come to know each other quickly; our
  loves, like our hates, are born of sudden dangers."</p>

  <p>The vessel was of the class called naves liburnicae&mdash;long, narrow,
  low in the water, and modelled for speed and quick manoeuvre. The bow was
  beautiful. A jet of water spun from its foot as she came on, sprinkling all
  the prow, which rose in graceful curvature twice a man's stature above the
  plane of the deck. Upon the bending of the sides were figures of Triton
  blowing shells. Below the bow, fixed to the keel, and projecting forward
  under the water-line, was the rostrum, or beak, a device of solid wood,
  reinforced and armed with iron, in action used as a ram. A stout molding
  extended from the bow the full length of the ship's sides, defining the
  bulwarks, which were tastefully crenelated; below the molding, in three rows,
  each covered with a cap or shield of bull-hide, were the holes in which the
  oars were worked&mdash;sixty on the right, sixty on the left. In further
  ornamentation, caducei leaned against the lofty prow. Two immense ropes
  passing across the bow marked the number of anchors stowed on the
  foredeck.</p>

  <p>The simplicity of the upper works declared the oars the chief dependence
  of the crew. A mast, set a little forward of midship, was held by fore and
  back stays and shrouds fixed to rings on the inner side of the bulwarks. The
  tackle was that required for the management of one great square sail and the
  yard to which it was hung. Above the bulwarks the deck was visible.</p>

  <p>Save the sailors who had reefed the sail, and yet lingered on the yard,
  but one man was to be seen by the party on the mole, and he stood by the prow
  helmeted and with a shield.</p>

  <p>The hundred and twenty oaken blades, kept white and shining by pumice and
  the constant wash of the waves, rose and fell as if operated by the same
  hand, and drove the galley forward with a speed rivalling that of a modern
  steamer.</p>

  <p>So rapidly, and apparently, so rashly, did she come that the landsmen of
  the tribune's party were alarmed. Suddenly the man by the prow raised his
  hand with a peculiar gesture; whereupon all the oars flew up, poised a moment
  in air, then fell straight down. The water boiled and bubbled about them; the
  galley shook in every timber, and stopped as if scared. Another gesture of
  the hand, and again the oars arose, feathered, and fell; but this time those
  on the right, dropping towards the stern, pushed forward; while those on the
  left, dropping towards the bow, pulled backwards. Three times the oars thus
  pushed and pulled against each other. Round to the right the ship swung as
  upon a pivot; then, caught by the wind, she settled gently broadside to the
  mole.</p>

  <p>The movement brought the stern to view, with all its
  garniture&mdash;Tritons like those at the bow; name in large raised letters;
  the rudder at the side; the elevated platform upon which the helmsman sat, a
  stately figure in full armor, his hand upon the rudder-rope; and the
  aplustre, high, gilt, carved, and bent over the helmsman like a great
  runcinate leaf.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the rounding-to, a trumpet was blown brief and shrill, and
  from the hatchways out poured the marines, all in superb equipment, brazen
  helms, burnished shields and javelins. While the fighting-men thus went to
  quarters as for action, the sailors proper climbed the shrouds and perched
  themselves along the yard. The officers and musicians took their posts. There
  was no shouting or needless noise. When the oars touched the mole, a bridge
  was sent out from the helmsman's deck. Then the tribune turned to his party
  and said, with a gravity he had not before shown:</p>

  <p>"Duty now, O my friends."</p>

  <p>He took the chaplet from his head and gave it to the dice-player.</p>

  <p>"Take thou the myrtle, O favorite of the tesserae!" he said. "If I return,
  I will seek my sestertii again; if I am not victor, I will not return. Hang
  the crown in thy atrium."</p>

  <p>To the company he opened his arms, and they came one by one and received
  his parting embrace.</p>

  <p>"The gods go with thee, O Quintus!" they said.</p>

  <p>"Farewell," he replied.</p>

  <p>To the slaves waving their torches he waved his hand; then he turned to
  the waiting ship, beautiful with ordered ranks and crested helms, and shields
  and javelins. As he stepped upon the bridge, the trumpets sounded, and over
  the aplustre rose the vexillum purpureum, or pennant of a commander of a
  fleet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch302"
     name="ch302"></a>II. &mdash; AT THE OAR</h2>

  <p class="first">The tribune, standing upon the helmsman's deck with the
  order of the duumvir open in his hand, spoke to the chief of the rowers.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">&gt;[* Called hortator. ]</p>

  <p>"What force hast thou?"</p>

  <p>"Of oarsmen, two hundred and fifty-two; ten supernumeraries.</p>

  <p>"Making reliefs of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eighty-four."</p>

  <p>"And thy habit?"</p>

  <p>"It has been to take off and put on every two hours."</p>

  <p>The tribune mused a moment.</p>

  <p>"The division is hard, and I will reform it, but not now. The oars may not
  rest day or night."</p>

  <p>Then to the sailing-master he said,</p>

  <p>"The wind is fair. Let the sail help the oars."</p>

  <p>When the two thus addressed were gone, he turned to the chief
  pilot.[2]</p>

  <p>[2] Called rector.</p>

  <p>"What service hast thou had?"</p>

  <p>"Two-and-thirty years."</p>

  <p>"In what seas chiefly?"</p>

  <p>"Between our Rome and the East."</p>

  <p>"Thou art the man I would have chosen."</p>

  <p>The tribune looked at his orders again.</p>

  <p>"Past the Camponellan cape, the course will be to Messina. Beyond that,
  follow the bend of the Calabrian shore till Melito is on thy left,
  then&mdash; Knowest thou the stars that govern in the Ionian Sea?"</p>

  <p>"I know them well."</p>

  <p>"Then from Melito course eastward for Cythera. The gods willing, I will
  not anchor until in the Bay of Antemona. The duty is urgent. I rely upon
  thee."</p>

  <p>A prudent man was Arrius&mdash;prudent, and of the class which, while
  enriching the altars at Praeneste and Antium, was of opinion, nevertheless,
  that the favor of the blind goddess depended more upon the votary's care and
  judgment than upon his gifts and vows. All night as master of the feast he
  had sat at table drinking and playing; yet the odor of the sea returned him
  to the mood of the sailor, and he would not rest until he knew his ship.
  Knowledge leaves no room for chances. Having begun with the chief of the
  rowers, the sailing-master, and the pilot, in company with the other
  officers&mdash;the commander of the marines, the keeper of the stores, the
  master of the machines, the overseer of the kitchen or fires&mdash;he passed
  through the several quarters. Nothing escaped his inspection. When he was
  through, of the community crowded within the narrow walls he alone knew
  perfectly all there was of material preparation for the voyage and its
  possible incidents; and, finding the preparation complete, there was left him
  but one thing further&mdash;thorough knowledge of the personnel of his
  command. As this was the most delicate and difficult part of his task,
  requiring much time, he set about it his own way.</p>

  <p>At noon that day the galley was skimming the sea off Paestum. The wind was
  yet from the west, filling the sail to the master's content. The watches had
  been established. On the foredeck the altar had been set and sprinkled with
  salt and barley, and before it the tribune had offered solemn prayers to Jove
  and to Neptune and all the Oceanidae, and, with vows, poured the wine and
  burned the incense. And now, the better to study his men, he was seated in
  the great cabin, a very martial figure.</p>

  <p>The cabin, it should be stated, was the central compartment of the galley,
  in extent quite sixty-five by thirty feet, and lighted by three broad
  hatchways. A row of stanchions ran from end to end, supporting the roof, and
  near the centre the mast was visible, all bristling with axes and spears and
  javelins. To each hatchway there were double stairs descending right and
  left, with a pivotal arrangement at the top to allow the lower ends to be
  hitched to the ceiling; and, as these were now raised, the compartment had
  the appearance of a skylighted hall.</p>

  <p>The reader will understand readily that this was the heart of the ship,
  the home of all aboard&mdash;eating-room, sleeping-chamber, field of
  exercise, lounging-place off duty&mdash;uses made possible by the laws which
  reduced life there to minute details and a routine relentless as death.</p>

  <p>At the after-end of the cabin there was a platform, reached by several
  steps. Upon it the chief of the rowers sat; in front of him a sounding-table,
  upon which, with a gavel, he beat time for the oarsmen; at his right a
  clepsydra, or water-clock, to measure the reliefs and watches. Above him, on
  a higher platform, well guarded by gilded railing, the tribune had his
  quarters, overlooking everything, and furnished with a couch, a table, and a
  cathedra, or chair, cushioned, and with arms and high back&mdash;articles
  which the imperial dispensation permitted of the utmost elegance.</p>

  <p>Thus at ease, lounging in the great chair, swaying with the motion of the
  vessel, the military cloak half draping his tunic, sword in belt, Arrius kept
  watchful eye over his command, and was as closely watched by them. He saw
  critically everything in view, but dwelt longest upon the rowers. The reader
  would doubtless have done the same: only he would have looked with much
  sympathy, while, as is the habit with masters, the tribune's mind ran forward
  of what he saw, inquiring for results.</p>

  <p>The spectacle was simple enough of itself. Along the sides of the cabin,
  fixed to the ship's timbers, were what at first appeared to be three rows of
  benches; a closer view, however, showed them a succession of rising banks, in
  each of which the second bench was behind and above the first one, and the
  third above and behind the second. To accommodate the sixty rowers on a side,
  the space devoted to them permitted nineteen banks separated by intervals of
  one yard, with a twentieth bank divided so that what would have been its
  upper seat or bench was directly above the lower seat of the first bank. The
  arrangement gave each rower when at work ample room, if he timed his
  movements with those of his associates, the principle being that of soldiers
  marching with cadenced step in close order. The arrangement also allowed a
  multiplication of banks, limited only by the length of the galley.</p>

  <p>As to the rowers, those upon the first and second benches sat, while those
  upon the third, having longer oars to work, were suffered to stand. The oars
  were loaded with lead in the handles, and near the point of balance hung to
  pliable thongs, making possible the delicate touch called feathering, but, at
  the same time, increasing the need of skill, since an eccentric wave might at
  any moment catch a heedless fellow and hurl him from his seat. Each oar-hole
  was a vent through which the laborer opposite it had his plenty of sweet air.
  Light streamed down upon him from the grating which formed the floor of the
  passage between the deck and the bulwark over his head. In some respects,
  therefore, the condition of the men might have been much worse. Still, it
  must not be imagined that there was any pleasantness in their lives.
  Communication between them was not allowed. Day after day they filled their
  places without speech; in hours of labor they could not see each other's
  faces; their short respites were given to sleep and the snatching of food.
  They never laughed; no one ever heard one of them sing. What is the use of
  tongues when a sigh or a groan will tell all men feel while, perforce, they
  think in silence? Existence with the poor wretches was like a stream under
  ground sweeping slowly, laboriously on to its outlet, wherever that might
  chance to be.</p>

  <p>O Son of Mary! The sword has now a heart&mdash;and thine the glory! So
  now; but, in the days of which we are writing, for captivity there was
  drudgery on walls, and in the streets and mines, and the galleys both of war
  and commerce were insatiable. When Druilius won the first sea-fight for his
  country, Romans plied the oars, and the glory was to the rower not less than
  the marine. These benches which now we are trying to see as they were
  testified to the change come with conquest, and illustrated both the policy
  and the prowess of Rome. Nearly all the nations had sons there, mostly
  prisoners of war, chosen for their brawn and endurance. In one place a
  Briton; before him a Libyan; behind him a Crimean. Elsewhere a Scythian, a
  Gaul, and a Thebasite. Roman convicts cast down to consort with Goths and
  Longobardi, Jews, Ethiopians, and barbarians from the shores of Maeotis. Here
  an Athenian, there a red-haired savage from Hibernia, yonder blue-eyed giants
  of the Cimbri.</p>

  <p>In the labor of the rowers there was not enough art to give occupation to
  their minds, rude and simple as they were. The reach forward, the pull, the
  feathering the blade, the dip, were all there was of it; motions most perfect
  when most automatic. Even the care forced upon them by the sea outside grew
  in time to be a thing instinctive rather than of thought. So, as the result
  of long service, the poor wretches became imbruted&mdash;patient, spiritless,
  obedient&mdash;creatures of vast muscle and exhausted intellects, who lived
  upon recollections generally few but dear, and at last lowered into the
  semi-conscious alchemic state wherein misery turns to habit, and the soul
  takes on incredible endurance.</p>

  <p>From right to left, hour after hour, the tribune, swaying in his
  easy-chair, turned with thought of everything rather than the wretchedness of
  the slaves upon the benches. Their motions, precise, and exactly the same on
  both sides of the vessel, after a while became monotonous; and then he amused
  himself singling out individuals. With his stylus he made note of objections,
  thinking, if all went well, he would find among the pirates of whom he was in
  search better men for the places.</p>

  <p>There was no need of keeping the proper names of the slaves brought to the
  galleys as to their graves; so, for convenience, they were usually identified
  by the numerals painted upon the benches to which they were assigned. As the
  sharp eyes of the great man moved from seat to seat on either hand, they came
  at last to number sixty, which, as has been said, belonged properly to the
  last bank on the left-hand side, but, wanting room aft, had been fixed above
  the first bench of the first bank. There they rested.</p>

  <p>The bench of number sixty was slightly above the level of the platform,
  and but a few feet away. The light glinting through the grating over his head
  gave the rower fairly to the tribune's view&mdash;erect, and, like all his
  fellows, naked, except a cincture about the loins. There were, however, some
  points in his favor. He was very young, not more than twenty. Furthermore,
  Arrius was not merely given to dice; he was a connoisseur of men physically,
  and when ashore indulged a habit of visiting the gymnasia to see and admire
  the most famous athletae. From some professor, doubtless, he had caught the
  idea that strength was as much of the quality as the quantity of the muscle,
  while superiority in performance required a certain mind as well as strength.
  Having adopted the doctrine, like most men with a hobby, he was always
  looking for illustrations to support it.</p>

  <p>The reader may well believe that while the tribune, in the search for the
  perfect, was often called upon to stop and study, he was seldom perfectly
  satisfied&mdash;in fact, very seldom held as long as on this occasion.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of each movement of the oar, the rower's body and face
  were brought into profile view from the platform; the movement ended with the
  body reversed, and in a pushing posture. The grace and ease of the action at
  first suggested a doubt of the honesty of the effort put forth; but it was
  speedily dismissed; the firmness with which the oar was held while in the
  reach forward, its bending under the push, were proofs of the force applied;
  not that only, they as certainly proved the rower's art, and put the critic
  in the great arm-chair in search of the combination of strength and
  cleverness which was the central idea of his theory.</p>

  <p>In course of the study, Arrius observed the subject's youth; wholly
  unconscious of tenderness on that account, he also observed that he seemed of
  good height, and that his limbs, upper and nether, were singularly perfect.
  The arms, perhaps, were too long, but the objection was well hidden under a
  mass of muscle, which, in some movements, swelled and knotted like kinking
  cords. Every rib in the round body was discernible; yet the leanness was the
  healthful reduction so strained after in the palaestrae. And altogether there
  was in the rower's action a certain harmony which, besides addressing itself
  to the tribune's theory, stimulated both his curiosity and general
  interest.</p>

  <p>Very soon he found himself waiting to catch a view of the man's face in
  full. The head was shapely, and balanced upon a neck broad at the base, but
  of exceeding pliancy and grace. The features in profile were of Oriental
  outline, and of that delicacy of expression which has always been thought a
  sign of blood and sensitive spirit. With these observations, the tribune's
  interest in the subject deepened.</p>

  <p>"By the gods," he said to himself, "the fellow impresses me! He promises
  well. I will know more of him."</p>

  <p>Directly the tribune caught the view he wished&mdash;the rower turned and
  looked at him.</p>

  <p>"A Jew! and a boy!"</p>

  <p>Under the gaze then fixed steadily upon him, the large eyes of the slave
  grew larger&mdash;the blood surged to his very brows&mdash;the blade lingered
  in his hands. But instantly, with an angry crash, down fell the gavel of the
  hortator. The rower started, withdrew his face from the inquisitor, and, as
  if personally chidden, dropped the oar half feathered. When he glanced again
  at the tribune, he was vastly more astonished&mdash;he was met with a kindly
  smile.</p>

  <p>Meantime the galley entered the Straits of Messina, and, skimming past the
  city of that name, was after a while turned eastward, leaving the cloud over
  AEtna in the sky astern.</p>

  <p>Often as Arrius resumed to his platform in the cabin he returned to study
  the rower, and he kept saying to himself, "The fellow hath a spirit. A Jew is
  not a barbarian. I will know more of him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch303"
     name="ch303"></a>III. &mdash; ARRIUS AND BEN-HUR ON DECK</h2>

  <p class="first">The fourth day out, and the Astroea&mdash;so the galley was
  named&mdash;speeding through the Ionian Sea. The sky was clear, and the wind
  blew as if bearing the good-will of all the gods.</p>

  <p>As it was possible to overtake the fleet before reaching the bay east of
  the island of Cythera, designated for assemblage, Arrius, somewhat impatient,
  spent much time on deck. He took note diligently of matters pertaining to his
  ship, and as a rule was well pleased. In the cabin, swinging in the great
  chair, his thought continually reverted to the rower on number sixty.</p>

  <p>"Knowest thou the man just come from yon bench?" he at length asked of the
  hortator.</p>

  <p>A relief was going on at the moment.</p>

  <p>"From number sixty?" returned the chief.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The chief looked sharply at the rower then going forward.</p>

  <p>"As thou knowest," he replied "the ship is but a month from the maker's
  hand, and the men are as new to me as the ship."</p>

  <p>"He is a Jew," Arrius remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The noble Quintus is shrewd."</p>

  <p>"He is very young," Arrius continued.</p>

  <p>"But our best rower," said the other. "I have seen his oar bend almost to
  breaking."</p>

  <p>"Of what disposition is he?"</p>

  <p>"He is obedient; further I know not. Once he made request of me."</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>"He wished me to change him alternately from the right to the left."</p>

  <p>"Did he give a reason?"</p>

  <p>"He had observed that the men who are confined to one side become
  misshapen. He also said that some day of storm or battle there might be
  sudden need to change him, and he might then be unserviceable."</p>

  <p>"Perpol! The idea is new. What else hast thou observed of him?"</p>

  <p>"He is cleanly above his companions."</p>

  <p>"In that he is Roman," said Arrius, approvingly. "Have you nothing of his
  history?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word."</p>

  <p>The tribune reflected awhile, and turned to go to his own seat.</p>

  <p>"If I should be on deck when his time is up," he paused to say, "send him
  to me. Let him come alone."</p>

  <p>About two hours later Arrius stood under the aplustre of the galley; in
  the mood of one who, seeing himself carried swiftly towards an event of
  mighty import, has nothing to do but wait&mdash;the mood in which philosophy
  vests an even-minded man with the utmost calm, and is ever so serviceable.
  The pilot sat with a hand upon the rope by which the rudder paddles, one on
  each side of the vessel, were managed. In the shade of the sail some sailors
  lay asleep, and up on the yard there was a lookout. Lifting his eyes from the
  solarium set under the aplustre for reference in keeping the course, Arrius
  beheld the rower approaching.</p>

  <p>"The chief called thee the noble Arrius, and said it was thy will that I
  should seek thee here. I have come."</p>

  <p>Arrius surveyed the figure, tall, sinewy, glistening in the sun, and
  tinted by the rich red blood within&mdash;surveyed it admiringly, and with a
  thought of the arena; yet the manner was not without effect upon him: there
  was in the voice a suggestion of life at least partly spent under refining
  influences; the eyes were clear and open, and more curious than defiant. To
  the shrewd, demanding, masterful glance bent upon it, the face gave back
  nothing to mar its youthful comeliness&mdash;nothing of accusation or
  sullenness or menace, only the signs which a great sorrow long borne
  imprints, as time mellows the surface of pictures. In tacit acknowledgment of
  the effect, the Roman spoke as an older man to a younger, not as a master to
  a slave.</p>

  <p>"The hortator tells me thou art his best rower."</p>

  <p>"The hortator is very kind," the rower answered.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou seen much service?"</p>

  <p>"About three years."</p>

  <p>"At the oars?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot recall a day of rest from them."</p>

  <p>"The labor is hard; few men bear it a year without breaking, and
  thou&mdash;thou art but a boy."</p>

  <p>"The noble Arrius forgets that the spirit hath much to do with endurance.
  By its help the weak sometimes thrive, when the strong perish."</p>

  <p>"From thy speech, thou art a Jew."</p>

  <p>"My ancestors further back than the first Roman were Hebrews."</p>

  <p>"The stubborn pride of thy race is not lost in thee," said Arrius,
  observing a flush upon the rower's face.</p>

  <p>"Pride is never so loud as when in chains."</p>

  <p>"What cause hast thou for pride?"</p>

  <p>"That I am a Jew."</p>

  <p>Arrius smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have not been to Jerusalem," he said; "but I have heard of its princes.
  I knew one of them. He was a merchant, and sailed the seas. He was fit to
  have been a king. Of what degree art thou?"</p>

  <p>"I must answer thee from the bench of a galley. I am of the degree of
  slaves. My father was a prince of Jerusalem, and, as a merchant, he sailed
  the seas. He was known and honored in the guest-chamber of the great
  Augustus."</p>

  <p>"His name?"</p>

  <p>"Ithamar, of the house of Hur."</p>

  <p>The tribune raised his hand in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"A son of Hur&mdash;thou?"</p>

  <p>After a silence, he asked,</p>

  <p>"What brought thee here?"</p>

  <p>Judah lowered his head, and his breast labored hard. When his feelings
  were sufficiently mastered, he looked the tribune in the face, and
  answered,</p>

  <p>"I was accused of attempting to assassinate Valerius Gratus, the
  procurator."</p>

  <p>"Thou!" cried Arrius, yet more amazed, and retreating a step. "Thou that
  assassin! All Rome rang with the story. It came to my ship in the river by
  Lodinum."</p>

  <p>The two regarded each other silently.</p>

  <p>"I thought the family of Hur blotted from the earth," said Arrius,
  speaking first.</p>

  <p>A flood of tender recollections carried the young man's pride away; tears
  shone upon his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Mother&mdash;mother! And my little Tirzah! Where are they? O tribune,
  noble tribune, if thou knowest anything of them"&mdash;he clasped his hands
  in appeal&mdash;"tell me all thou knowest. Tell me if they are
  living&mdash;if living, where are they? and in what condition? Oh, I pray
  thee, tell me!"</p>

  <p>He drew nearer Arrius, so near that his hands touched the cloak where it
  dropped from the latter's folded arms.</p>

  <p>"The horrible day is three years gone," he continued&mdash;"three years, O
  tribune, and every hour a whole lifetime of misery&mdash;a lifetime in a
  bottomless pit with death, and no relief but in labor&mdash;and in all that
  time not a word from any one, not a whisper. Oh, if, in being forgotten, we
  could only forget! If only I could hide from that scene&mdash;my sister torn
  from me, my mother's last look! I have felt the plague's breath, and the
  shock of ships in battle; I have heard the tempest lashing the sea, and
  laughed, though others prayed: death would have been a riddance. Bend the
  oar&mdash;yes, in the strain of mighty effort trying to escape the haunting
  of what that day occurred. Think what little will help me. Tell me they are
  dead, if no more, for happy they cannot be while I am lost. I have heard them
  call me in the night; I have seen them on the water walking. Oh, never
  anything so true as my mother's love! And Tirzah&mdash;her breath was as the
  breath of white lilies. She was the youngest branch of the palm&mdash;so
  fresh, so tender, so graceful, so beautiful! She made my day all morning. She
  came and went in music. And mine was the hand that laid them low!
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dost thou admit thy guilt?" asked Arrius, sternly.</p>

  <p>The change that came upon Ben-Hur was wonderful to see, it was so instant
  and extreme. The voice sharpened; the hands arose tight-clenched; every fibre
  thrilled; his eyes inflamed.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast heard of the God of my fathers," he said; "of the infinite
  Jehovah. By his truth and almightiness, and by the love with which he hath
  followed Israel from the beginning, I swear I am innocent!"</p>

  <p>The tribune was much moved.</p>

  <p>"O noble Roman!" continued Ben-Hur, "give me a little faith, and, into my
  darkness, deeper darkening every day, send a light!"</p>

  <p>Arrius turned away, and walked the deck.</p>

  <p>"Didst thou not have a trial?" he asked, stopping suddenly.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The Roman raised his head, surprised.</p>

  <p>"No trial&mdash;no witnesses! Who passed judgment upon thee?"</p>

  <p>Romans, it should be remembered, were at no time such lovers of the law
  and its forms as in the ages of their decay.</p>

  <p>"They bound me with cords, and dragged me to a vault in the Tower. I saw
  no one. No one spoke to me. Next day soldiers took me to the seaside. I have
  been a galley-slave ever since."</p>

  <p>"What couldst thou have proven?"</p>

  <p>"I was a boy, too young to be a conspirator. Gratus was a stranger to me.
  If I had meant to kill him, that was not the time or the place. He was riding
  in the midst of a legion, and it was broad day. I could not have escaped. I
  was of a class most friendly to Rome. My father had been distinguished for
  his services to the emperor. We had a great estate to lose. Ruin was certain
  to myself, my mother, my sister. I had no cause for malice, while every
  consideration&mdash;property, family, life, conscience, the Law&mdash;to a
  son of Israel as the breath of his nostrils&mdash;would have stayed my hand,
  though the foul intent had been ever so strong. I was not mad. Death was
  preferable to shame; and, believe me, I pray, it is so yet."</p>

  <p>"Who was with thee when the blow was struck?"</p>

  <p>"I was on the house-top&mdash;my father's house. Tirzah was with
  me&mdash;at my side&mdash;the soul of gentleness. Together we leaned over the
  parapet to see the legion pass. A tile gave way under my hand, and fell upon
  Gratus. I thought I had killed him. Ah, what horror I felt!"</p>

  <p>"Where was thy mother?"</p>

  <p>"In her chamber below."</p>

  <p>"What became of her?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur clenched his hands, and drew a breath like a gasp.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. I saw them drag her away&mdash;that is all I know. Out of
  the house they drove every living thing, even the dumb cattle, and they
  sealed the gates. The purpose was that she should not return. I, too, ask for
  her. Oh for one word! She, at least, was innocent. I can forgive&mdash;but I
  pray thy pardon, noble tribune! A slave like me should not talk of
  forgiveness or of revenge. I am bound to an oar for life."</p>

  <p>Arrius listened intently. He brought all his experience with slaves to his
  aid. If the feeling shown in this instance were assumed, the acting was
  perfect; on the other hand, if it were real, the Jew's innocence might not be
  doubted; and if he were innocent, with what blind fury the power had been
  exercised! A whole family blotted out to atone an accident! The thought
  shocked him.</p>

  <p>There is no wiser providence than that our occupations, however rude or
  bloody, cannot wear us out morally; that such qualities as justice and mercy,
  if they really possess us, continue to live on under them, like flowers under
  the snow. The tribune could be inexorable, else he had not been fit for the
  usages of his calling; he could also be just; and to excite his sense of
  wrong was to put him in the way to right the wrong. The crews of the ships in
  which he served came after a time to speak of him as the good tribune. Shrewd
  readers will not want a better definition of his character.</p>

  <p>In this instance there were many circumstances certainly in the young
  man's favor, and some to be supposed. Possibly Arrius knew Valerius Gratus
  without loving him. Possibly he had known the elder Hur. In the course of his
  appeal, Judah had asked him of that; and, as will be noticed, he had made no
  reply.</p>

  <p>For once the tribune was at loss, and hesitated. His power was ample. He
  was monarch of the ship. His prepossessions all moved him to mercy. His faith
  was won. Yet, he said to himself, there was no haste&mdash;or, rather, there
  was haste to Cythera; the best rower could not then be spared; he would wait;
  he would learn more; he would at least be sure this was the prince Ben-Hur,
  and that he was of a right disposition. Ordinarily, slaves were liars.</p>

  <p>"It is enough," he said aloud. "Go back to thy place."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur bowed; looked once more into the master's face, but saw nothing
  for hope. He turned away slowly, looked back, and said,</p>

  <p>"If thou dost think of me again, O tribune, let it not be lost in thy mind
  that I prayed thee only for word of my people&mdash;mother, sister."</p>

  <p>He moved on.</p>

  <p>Arrius followed him with admiring eyes.</p>

  <p>"Perpol!" he thought. "With teaching, what a man for the arena! What a
  runner! Ye gods! what an arm for the sword or the cestus!&mdash;Stay!" he
  said aloud.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur stopped, and the tribune went to him.</p>

  <p>"If thou wert free, what wouldst thou do?"</p>

  <p>"The noble Arrius mocks me!" Judah said, with trembling lips.</p>

  <p>"No; by the gods, no!"</p>

  <p>"Then I will answer gladly. I would give myself to duty the first of life.
  I would know no other. I would know no rest until my mother and Tirzah were
  restored to home. I would give every day and hour to their happiness. I would
  wait upon them; never a slave more faithful. They have lost much, but, by the
  God of my fathers, I would find them more!"</p>

  <p>The answer was unexpected by the Roman. For a moment he lost his
  purpose.</p>

  <p>"I spoke to thy ambition," he said, recovering. "If thy mother and sister
  were dead, or not to be found, what wouldst thou do?"</p>

  <p>A distinct pallor overspread Ben-Hur's face, and he looked over the sea.
  There was a struggle with some strong feeling; when it was conquered, he
  turned to the tribune.</p>

  <p>"What pursuit would I follow?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Tribune, I will tell thee truly. Only the night before the dreadful day
  of which I have spoken, I obtained permission to be a soldier. I am of the
  same mind yet; and, as in all the earth there is but one school of war,
  thither I would go."</p>

  <p>"The palaestra!" exclaimed Arrius.</p>

  <p>"No; a Roman camp."</p>

  <p>"But thou must first acquaint thyself with the use of arms."</p>

  <p>Now a master may never safely advise a slave. Arrius saw his indiscretion,
  and, in a breath, chilled his voice and manner.</p>

  <p>"Go now," he said, "and do not build upon what has passed between us.
  Perhaps I do but play with thee. Or"&mdash;he looked away musingly&mdash;"or,
  if thou dost think of it with any hope, choose between the renown of a
  gladiator and the service of a soldier. The former may come of the favor of
  the emperor; there is no reward for thee in the latter. Thou art not a Roman.
  Go!"</p>

  <p>A short while after Ben-Hur was upon his bench again.</p>

  <p>A man's task is always light if his heart is light. Handling the oar did
  not seem so toilsome to Judah. A hope had come to him, like a singing bird.
  He could hardly see the visitor or hear its song; that it was there, though,
  he knew; his feelings told him so. The caution of the tribune&mdash;"Perhaps
  I do but play with thee"&mdash;was dismissed often as it recurred to his
  mind. That he had been called by the great man and asked his story was the
  bread upon which he fed his hungry spirit. Surely something good would come
  of it. The light about his bench was clear and bright with promises, and he
  prayed.</p>

  <p>"O God! I am a true son of the Israel thou hast so loved! Help me, I pray
  thee!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch304"
     name="ch304"></a>IV. &mdash; "No. 60"</h2>

  <p class="first">In the Bay of Antemona, east of Cythera the island, the
  hundred galleys assembled. There the tribune gave one day to inspection. He
  sailed then to Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades, midway the coasts of
  Greece and Asia, like a great stone planted in the centre of a highway, from
  which he could challenge everything that passed; at the same time, he would
  be in position to go after the pirates instantly, whether they were in the
  AEgean or out on the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>As the fleet, in order, rowed in towards the mountain shores of the
  island, a galley was descried coming from the north. Arrius went to meet it.
  She proved to be a transport just from Byzantium, and from her commander he
  learned the particulars of which he stood in most need.</p>

  <p>The pirates were from all the farther shores of the Euxine. Even Tanais,
  at the mouth of the river which was supposed to feed Palus Maeotis, was
  represented among them. Their preparations had been with the greatest
  secrecy. The first known of them was their appearance off the entrance to the
  Thracian Bosphorus, followed by the destruction of the fleet in station
  there. Thence to the outlet of the Hellespont everything afloat had fallen
  their prey. There were quite sixty galleys in the squadron, all well manned
  and supplied. A few were biremes, the rest stout triremes. A Greek was in
  command, and the pilots, said to be familiar with all the Eastern seas, were
  Greek. The plunder had been incalculable. The panic, consequently, was not on
  the sea alone; cities, with closed gates, sent their people nightly to the
  walls. Traffic had almost ceased.</p>

  <p>Where were the pirates now?</p>

  <p>To this question, of most interest to Arrius, he received answer.</p>

  <p>After sacking Hephaestia, on the island of Lemnos, the enemy had coursed
  across to the Thessalian group, and, by last account, disappeared in the
  gulfs between Euboea and Hellas.</p>

  <p>Such were the tidings.</p>

  <p>Then the people of the island, drawn to the hill-tops by the rare
  spectacle of a hundred ships careering in united squadron, beheld the advance
  division suddenly turn to the north, and the others follow, wheeling upon the
  same point like cavalry in a column. News of the piratical descent had
  reached them, and now, watching the white sails until they faded from sight
  up between Rhene and Syros, the thoughtful among them took comfort, and were
  grateful. What Rome seized with strong hand she always defended: in return
  for their taxes, she gave them safety.</p>

  <p>The tribune was more than pleased with the enemy's movements; he was
  doubly thankful to Fortune. She had brought swift and sure intelligence, and
  had lured his foes into the waters where, of all others, destruction was most
  assured. He knew the havoc one galley could play in a broad sea like the
  Mediterranean, and the difficulty of finding and overhauling her; he knew,
  also, how those very circumstances would enhance the service and glory if, at
  one blow, he could put a finish to the whole piratical array.</p>

  <p>If the reader will take a map of Greece and the AEgean, he will notice the
  island of Euboea lying along the classic coast like a rampart against Asia,
  leaving a channel between it and the continent quite a hundred and twenty
  miles in length, and scarcely an average of eight in width. The inlet on the
  north had admitted the fleet of Xerxes, and now it received the bold raiders
  from the Euxine. The towns along the Pelasgic and Meliac gulfs were rich and
  their plunder seductive. All things considered, therefore, Arrius judged that
  the robbers might be found somewhere below Thermopylae. Welcoming the chance,
  he resolved to enclose them north and south, to do which not an hour could be
  lost; even the fruits and wines and women of Naxos must be left behind. So he
  sailed away without stop or tack until, a little before nightfall, Mount Ocha
  was seen upreared against the sky, and the pilot reported the Euboean
  coast.</p>

  <p>At a signal the fleet rested upon its oars. When the movement was resumed,
  Arrius led a division of fifty of the galleys, intending to take them up the
  channel, while another division, equally strong, turned their prows to the
  outer or seaward side of the island, with orders to make all haste to the
  upper inlet, and descend sweeping the waters.</p>

  <p>To be sure, neither division was equal in number to the pirates; but each
  had advantages in compensation, among them, by no means least, a discipline
  impossible to a lawless horde, however brave. Besides, it was a shrewd count
  on the tribune's side, if, peradventure, one should be defeated, the other
  would find the enemy shattered by his victory, and in condition to be easily
  overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Meantime Ben-Hur kept his bench, relieved every six hours. The rest in the
  Bay of Antemona had freshened him, so that the oar was not troublesome, and
  the chief on the platform found no fault.</p>

  <p>People, generally, are not aware of the ease of mind there is in knowing
  where they are, and where they are going. The sensation of being lost is a
  keen distress; still worse is the feeling one has in driving blindly into
  unknown places. Custom had dulled the feeling with Ben-Hur, but only
  measurably. Pulling away hour after hour, sometimes days and nights together,
  sensible all the time that the galley was gliding swiftly along some of the
  many tracks of the broad sea, the longing to know where he was, and whither
  going, was always present with him; but now it seemed quickened by the hope
  which had come to new life in his breast since the interview with the
  tribune. The narrower the abiding-place happens to be, the more intense is
  the longing; and so he found. He seemed to hear every sound of the ship in
  labor, and listened to each one as if it were a voice come to tell him
  something; he looked to the grating overhead, and through it into the light
  of which so small a portion was his, expecting, he knew not what; and many
  times he caught himself on the point of yielding to the impulse to speak to
  the chief on the platform, than which no circumstance of battle would have
  astonished that dignitary more.</p>

  <p>In his long service, by watching the shifting of the meager sunbeams upon
  the cabin floor when the ship was under way, he had come to know, generally,
  the quarter into which she was sailing. This, of course, was only of clear
  days like those good-fortune was sending the tribune. The experience had not
  failed him in the period succeeding the departure from Cythera. Thinking they
  were tending towards the old Judean country, he was sensitive to every
  variation from the course. With a pang, he had observed the sudden change
  northward which, as has been noticed, took place near Naxos: the cause,
  however, he could not even conjecture; for it must be remembered that, in
  common with his fellow-slaves, he knew nothing of the situation, and had no
  interest in the voyage. His place was at the oar, and he was held there
  inexorably, whether at anchor or under sail. Once only in three years had he
  been permitted an outlook from the deck. The occasion we have seen. He had no
  idea that, following the vessel he was helping drive, there was a great
  squadron close at hand and in beautiful order; no more did he know the object
  of which it was in pursuit.</p>

  <p>When the sun, going down, withdrew his last ray from the cabin, the galley
  still held northward. Night fell, yet Ben-Hur could discern no change. About
  that time the smell of incense floated down the gangways from the deck.</p>

  <p>"The tribune is at the altar," he thought. "Can it be we are going into
  battle?"</p>

  <p>He became observant.</p>

  <p>Now he had been in many battles without having seen one. From his bench he
  had heard them above and about him, until he was familiar with all their
  notes, almost as a singer with a song. So, too, he had become acquainted with
  many of the preliminaries of an engagement, of which, with a Roman as well as
  a Greek, the most invariable was the sacrifice to the gods. The rites were
  the same as those performed at the beginning of a voyage, and to him, when
  noticed, they were always an admonition.</p>

  <p>A battle, it should be observed, possessed for him and his fellow-slaves
  of the oar an interest unlike that of the sailor and marine; it came, not of
  the danger encountered but of the fact that defeat, if survived, might bring
  an alteration of condition&mdash;possibly freedom&mdash;at least a change of
  masters, which might be for the better.</p>

  <p>In good time the lanterns were lighted and hung by the stairs, and the
  tribune came down from the deck. At his word the marines put on their armor.
  At his word again, the machines were looked to, and spears, javelins, and
  arrows, in great sheaves, brought and laid upon the floor, together with jars
  of inflammable oil, and baskets of cotton balls wound loose like the wicking
  of candles. And when, finally, Ben-Hur saw the tribune mount his platform and
  don his armor, and get his helmet and shield out, the meaning of the
  preparations might not be any longer doubted, and he made ready for the last
  ignominy of his service.</p>

  <p>To every bench, as a fixture, there was a chain with heavy anklets. These
  the hortator proceeded to lock upon the oarsmen, going from number to number,
  leaving no choice but to obey, and, in event of disaster, no possibility of
  escape.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">On board the Astroea. The galley slaves in chains.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>In the cabin, then, a silence fell, broken, at first, only by the sough of
  the oars turning in the leathern cases. Every man upon the benches felt the
  shame, Ben-Hur more keenly than his companions. He would have put it away at
  any price. Soon the clanking of the fetters notified him of the progress the
  chief was making in his round. He would come to him in turn; but would not
  the tribune interpose for him?</p>

  <p>The thought may be set down to vanity or selfishness, as the reader
  pleases; it certainly, at that moment, took possession of Ben-Hur. He
  believed the Roman would interpose; anyhow, the circumstance would test the
  man's feelings. If, intent upon the battle, he would but think of him, it
  would be proof of his opinion formed&mdash;proof that he had been tacitly
  promoted above his associates in misery&mdash;such proof as would justify
  hope.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur waited anxiously. The interval seemed like an age. At every turn
  of the oar he looked towards the tribune, who, his simple preparations made,
  lay down upon the couch and composed himself to rest; whereupon number sixty
  chid himself, and laughed grimly, and resolved not to look that way
  again.</p>

  <p>The hortator approached. Now he was at number one&mdash;the rattle of the
  iron links sounded horribly. At last number sixty! Calm from despair, Ben-Hur
  held his oar at poise, and gave his foot to the officer. Then the tribune
  stirred&mdash;sat up&mdash;beckoned to the chief.</p>

  <p>A strong revulsion seized the Jew. From the hortator, the great man
  glanced at him; and when he dropped his oar all the section of the ship on
  his side seemed aglow. He heard nothing of what was said; enough that the
  chain hung idly from its staple in the bench, and that the chief, going to
  his seat, began to beat the sounding-board. The notes of the gavel were never
  so like music. With his breast against the leaded handle, he pushed with all
  his might&mdash;pushed until the shaft bent as if about to break.</p>

  <p>The chief went to the tribune, and, smiling, pointed to number sixty.</p>

  <p>"What strength!" he said.</p>

  <p>"And what spirit!" the tribune answered. "Perpol! He is better without the
  irons. Put them on him no more."</p>

  <p>So saying, he stretched himself upon the couch again.</p>

  <p>The ship sailed on hour after hour under the oars in water scarcely
  rippled by the wind. And the people not on duty slept, Arrius in his place,
  the marines on the floor.</p>

  <p>Once&mdash;twice&mdash;Ben-Hur was relieved; but he could not sleep. Three
  years of night, and through the darkness a sunbeam at last! At sea adrift and
  lost, and now land! Dead so long, and, lo! the thrill and stir of
  resurrection. Sleep was not for such an hour. Hope deals with the future; now
  and the past are but servants that wait on her with impulse and suggestive
  circumstance. Starting from the favor of the tribune, she carried him forward
  indefinitely. The wonder is, not that things so purely imaginative as the
  results she points us to can make us so happy, but that we can receive them
  as so real. They must be as gorgeous poppies under the influence of which,
  under the crimson and purple and gold, reason lies down the while, and is
  not. Sorrows assuaged, home and the fortunes of his house restored; mother
  and sister in his arms once more&mdash;such were the central ideas which made
  him happier that moment than he had ever been. That he was rushing, as on
  wings, into horrible battle had, for the time, nothing to do with his
  thoughts. The things thus in hope were unmixed with doubts&mdash;they WERE.
  Hence his joy so full, so perfect, there was no room in his heart for
  revenge. Messala, Gratus, Rome, and all the bitter, passionate memories
  connected with them, were as dead plagues&mdash;miasms of the earth above
  which he floated, far and safe, listening to singing stars.</p>

  <p>The deeper darkness before the dawn was upon the waters, and all things
  going well with the Astroea, when a man, descending from the deck, walked
  swiftly to the platform where the tribune slept, and awoke him. Arrius arose,
  put on his helmet, sword, and shield, and went to the commander of the
  marines.</p>

  <p>"The pirates are close by. Up and ready!" he said, and passed to the
  stairs, calm, confident, insomuch that one might have thought, "Happy fellow!
  Apicius has set a feast for him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch305"
     name="ch305"></a>V. &mdash; THE SEA FIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">Every soul aboard, even the ship, awoke. Officers went to
  their quarters. The marines took arms, and were led out, looking in all
  respects like legionaries. Sheaves of arrows and armfuls of javelins were
  carried on deck. By the central stairs the oil-tanks and fire-balls were set
  ready for use. Additional lanterns were lighted. Buckets were filled with
  water. The rowers in relief assembled under guard in front of the chief. As
  Providence would have it, Ben-Hur was one of the latter. Overhead he heard
  the muffled noises of the final preparations&mdash;of the sailors furling
  sail, spreading the nettings, unslinging the machines, and hanging the armor
  of bull-hide over the side. Presently quiet settled about the galley again;
  quiet full of vague dread and expectation, which, interpreted, means
  READY.</p>

  <p>At a signal passed down from the deck, and communicated to the hortator by
  a petty officer stationed on the stairs, all at once the oars stopped.</p>

  <p>What did it mean?</p>

  <p>Of the hundred and twenty slaves chained to the benches, not one but asked
  himself the question. They were without incentive. Patriotism, love of honor,
  sense of duty, brought them no inspiration. They felt the thrill common to
  men rushed helpless and blind into danger. It may be supposed the dullest of
  them, poising his oar, thought of all that might happen, yet could promise
  himself nothing; for victory would but rivet his chains the firmer, while the
  chances of the ship were his; sinking or on fire, he was doomed to her
  fate.</p>

  <p>Of the situation without they might not ask. And who were the enemy? And
  what if they were friends, brethren, countrymen? The reader, carrying the
  suggestion forward, will see the necessity which governed the Roman when, in
  such emergencies, he locked the hapless wretches to their seats.</p>

  <p>There was little time, however, for such thought with them. A sound like
  the rowing of galleys astern attracted Ben-Hur, and the Astroea rocked as if
  in the midst of countering waves. The idea of a fleet at hand broke upon
  him&mdash;a fleet in manoeuvre&mdash;forming probably for attack. His blood
  started with the fancy.</p>

  <p>Another signal came down from the deck. The oars dipped, and the galley
  started imperceptibly. No sound from without, none from within, yet each man
  in the cabin instinctively poised himself for a shock; the very ship seemed
  to catch the sense, and hold its breath, and go crouched tiger-like.</p>

  <p>In such a situation time is inappreciable; so that Ben-Hur could form no
  judgment of distance gone. At last there was a sound of trumpets on deck,
  full, clear, long blown. The chief beat the sounding-board until it rang; the
  rowers reached forward full length, and, deepening the dip of their oars,
  pulled suddenly with all their united force. The galley, quivering in every
  timber, answered with a leap. Other trumpets joined in the clamor&mdash;all
  from the rear, none forward&mdash;from the latter quarter only a rising sound
  of voices in tumult heard briefly. There was a mighty blow; the rowers in
  front of the chief's platform reeled, some of them fell; the ship bounded
  back, recovered, and rushed on more irresistibly than before. Shrill and high
  arose the shrieks of men in terror; over the blare of trumpets, and the grind
  and crash of the collision, they arose; then under his feet, under the keel,
  pounding, rumbling, breaking to pieces, drowning, Ben-Hur felt something
  overridden. The men about him looked at each other afraid. A shout of triumph
  from the deck&mdash;the beak of the Roman had won! But who were they whom the
  sea had drunk? Of what tongue, from what land were they?</p>

  <p>No pause, no stay! Forward rushed the Astroea; and, as it went, some
  sailors ran down, and plunging the cotton balls into the oil-tanks, tossed
  them dripping to comrades at the head of the stairs: fire was to be added to
  other horrors of the combat.</p>

  <p>Directly the galley heeled over so far that the oarsmen on the uppermost
  side with difficulty kept their benches. Again the hearty Roman cheer, and
  with it despairing shrieks. An opposing vessel, caught by the grappling-hooks
  of the great crane swinging from the prow, was being lifted into the air that
  it might be dropped and sunk.</p>

  <p>The shouting increased on the right hand and on the left; before, behind,
  swelled an indescribable clamor. Occasionally there was a crash, followed by
  sudden peals of fright, telling of other ships ridden down, and their crews
  drowned in the vortexes.</p>

  <p>Nor was the fight all on one side. Now and then a Roman in armor was borne
  down the hatchway, and laid bleeding, sometimes dying, on the floor.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The fight on the galley.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Sometimes, also, puffs of smoke, blended with steam, and foul with the
  scent of roasting human flesh, poured into the cabin, turning the dimming
  light into yellow murk. Gasping for breath the while, Ben-Hur knew they were
  passing through the cloud of a ship on fire, and burning up with the rowers
  chained to the benches.</p>

  <p>The Astroea all this time was in motion. Suddenly she stopped. The oars
  forward were dashed from the hands of the rowers, and the rowers from their
  benches. On deck, then, a furious trampling, and on the sides a grinding of
  ships afoul of each other. For the first time the beating of the gavel was
  lost in the uproar. Men sank on the floor in fear or looked about seeking a
  hiding-place. In the midst of the panic a body plunged or was pitched
  headlong down the hatchway, falling near Ben-Hur. He beheld the half-naked
  carcass, a mass of hair blackening the face, and under it a shield of
  bull-hide and wicker-work&mdash;a barbarian from the white-skinned nations of
  the North whom death had robbed of plunder and revenge. How came he there? An
  iron hand had snatched him from the opposing deck&mdash;no, the Astroea had
  been boarded! The Romans were fighting on their own deck? A chill smote the
  young Jew: Arrius was hard pressed&mdash;he might be defending his own life.
  If he should be slain! God of Abraham forefend! The hopes and dreams so
  lately come, were they only hopes and dreams? Mother and
  sister&mdash;house&mdash;home&mdash;Holy Land&mdash;was he not to see them,
  after all? The tumult thundered above him; he looked around; in the cabin all
  was confusion&mdash;the rowers on the benches paralyzed; men running blindly
  hither and thither; only the chief on his seat imperturbable, vainly beating
  the sounding-board, and waiting the orders of the tribune&mdash;in the red
  murk illustrating the matchless discipline which had won the world.</p>

  <p>The example had a good effect upon Ben-Hur. He controlled himself enough
  to think. Honor and duty bound the Roman to the platform; but what had he to
  do with such motives then? The bench was a thing to run from; while, if he
  were to die a slave, who would be the better of the sacrifice? With him
  living was duty, if not honor. His life belonged to his people. They arose
  before him never more real: he saw them, their arms outstretched; he heard
  them imploring him. And he would go to them. He started&mdash;stopped. Alas!
  a Roman judgment held him in doom. While it endured, escape would be
  profitless. In the wide, wide earth there was no place in which he would be
  safe from the imperial demand; upon the land none, nor upon the sea. Whereas
  he required freedom according to the forms of law, so only could he abide in
  Judea and execute the filial purpose to which he would devote himself: in
  other land he would not live. Dear God! How he had waited and watched and
  prayed for such a release! And how it had been delayed! But at last he had
  seen it in the promise of the tribune. What else the great man's meaning? And
  if the benefactor so belated should now be slain! The dead come not back to
  redeem the pledges of the living. It should not be&mdash;Arrius should not
  die. At least, better perish with him than survive a galley-slave.</p>

  <p>Once more Ben-Hur looked around. Upon the roof of the cabin the battle yet
  beat; against the sides the hostile vessels yet crushed and grided. On the
  benches, the slaves struggled to tear loose from their chains, and, finding
  their efforts vain, howled like madmen; the guards had gone upstairs;
  discipline was out, panic in. No, the chief kept his chair, unchanged, calm
  as ever&mdash;except the gavel, weaponless. Vainly with his clangor he filled
  the lulls in the din. Ben-Hur gave him a last look, then broke away&mdash;not
  in flight, but to seek the tribune.</p>

  <p>A very short space lay between him and the stairs of the hatchway aft. He
  took it with a leap, and was half-way up the steps&mdash;up far enough to
  catch a glimpse of the sky blood-red with fire, of the ships alongside, of
  the sea covered with ships and wrecks, of the fight closed in about the
  pilot's quarter, the assailants many, the defenders few&mdash;when suddenly
  his foothold was knocked away, and he pitched backward. The floor, when he
  reached it, seemed to be lifting itself and breaking to pieces; then, in a
  twinkling, the whole after-part of the hull broke asunder, and, as if it had
  all the time been lying in wait, the sea, hissing and foaming, leaped in, and
  all became darkness and surging water to Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>It cannot be said that the young Jew helped himself in this stress.
  Besides his usual strength, he had the indefinite extra force which nature
  keeps in reserve for just such perils to life; yet the darkness, and the
  whirl and roar of water, stupefied him. Even the holding his breath was
  involuntary.</p>

  <p>The influx of the flood tossed him like a log forward into the cabin,
  where he would have drowned but for the refluence of the sinking motion. As
  it was, fathoms under the surface the hollow mass vomited him forth, and he
  arose along with the loosed debris. In the act of rising, he clutched
  something, and held to it. The time he was under seemed an age longer than it
  really was; at last he gained the top; with a great gasp he filled his lungs
  afresh, and, tossing the water from his hair and eyes, climbed higher upon
  the plank he held, and looked about him.</p>

  <p>Death had pursued him closely under the waves; he found it waiting for him
  when he was risen&mdash;waiting multiform.</p>

  <p>Smoke lay upon the sea like a semitransparent fog, through which here and
  there shone cores of intense brilliance. A quick intelligence told him that
  they were ships on fire. The battle was yet on; nor could he say who was
  victor. Within the radius of his vision now and then ships passed, shooting
  shadows athwart lights. Out of the dun clouds farther on he caught the crash
  of other ships colliding. The danger, however, was closer at hand. When the
  Astroea went down, her deck, it will be recollected, held her own crew, and
  the crews of the two galleys which had attacked her at the same time, all of
  whom were ingulfed. Many of them came to the surface together, and on the
  same plank or support of whatever kind continued the combat, begun possibly
  in the vortex fathoms down. Writhing and twisting in deadly embrace,
  sometimes striking with sword or javelin, they kept the sea around them in
  agitation, at one place inky-black, at another aflame with fiery reflections.
  With their struggles he had nothing to do; they were all his enemies: not one
  of them but would kill him for the plank upon which he floated. He made haste
  to get away.</p>

  <p>About that time he heard oars in quickest movement, and beheld a galley
  coming down upon him. The tall prow seemed doubly tall, and the red light
  playing upon its gilt and carving gave it an appearance of snaky life. Under
  its foot the water churned to flying foam.</p>

  <p>He struck out, pushing the plank, which was very broad and unmanageable.
  Seconds were precious&mdash;half a second might save or lose him. In the
  crisis of the effort, up from the sea, within arm's reach, a helmet shot like
  a gleam of gold. Next came two hands with fingers extended&mdash;large hands
  were they, and strong&mdash;their hold once fixed, might not be loosed.
  Ben-Hur swerved from them appalled. Up rose the helmet and the head it
  encased&mdash;then two arms, which began to beat the water wildly&mdash;the
  head turned back, and gave the face to the light. The mouth gaping wide; the
  eyes open, but sightless, and the bloodless pallor of a drowning
  man&mdash;never anything more ghastly! Yet he gave a cry of joy at the sight,
  and as the face was going under again, he caught the sufferer by the chain
  which passed from the helmet beneath the chin, and drew him to the plank.</p>

  <p>The man was Arrius, the tribune.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur rescues Tribune Arrius.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>For a while the water foamed and eddied violently about Ben-Hur, taxing
  all his strength to hold to the support and at the same time keep the Roman's
  head above the surface. The galley had passed, leaving the two barely outside
  the stroke of its oars. Right through the floating men, over heads helmeted
  as well as heads bare, she drove, in her wake nothing but the sea sparkling
  with fire. A muffled crash, succeeded by a great outcry, made the rescuer
  look again from his charge. A certain savage pleasure touched his
  heart&mdash;the Astroea was avenged.</p>

  <p>After that the battle moved on. Resistance turned to flight. But who were
  the victors? Ben-Hur was sensible how much his freedom and the life of the
  tribune depended upon that event. He pushed the plank under the latter until
  it floated him, after which all his care was to keep him there. The dawn came
  slowly. He watched its growing hopefully, yet sometimes afraid. Would it
  bring the Romans or the pirates? If the pirates, his charge was lost.</p>

  <p>At last morning broke in full, the air without a breath. Off to the left
  he saw the land, too far to think of attempting to make it. Here and there
  men were adrift like himself. In spots the sea was blackened by charred and
  sometimes smoking fragments. A galley up a long way was lying to with a torn
  sail hanging from the tilted yard, and the oars all idle. Still farther away
  he could discern moving specks, which he thought might be ships in flight or
  pursuit, or they might be white birds a-wing.</p>

  <p>An hour passed thus. His anxiety increased. If relief came not speedily,
  Arrius would die. Sometimes he seemed already dead, he lay so still. He took
  the helmet off, and then, with greater difficulty, the cuirass; the heart he
  found fluttering. He took hope at the sign, and held on. There was nothing to
  do but wait, and, after the manner of his people, pray.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch306"
     name="ch306"></a>VI. &mdash; ARRIUS ADOPTS BEN-HUR</h2>

  <p class="first">The throes of recovery from drowning are more painful than
  the drowning. These Arrius passed through, and, at length, to Ben-Hur's
  delight, reached the point of speech.</p>

  <p>Gradually, from incoherent questions as to where he was, and by whom and
  how he had been saved, he reverted to the battle. The doubt of the victory
  stimulated his faculties to full return, a result aided not a little by a
  long rest&mdash;such as could be had on their frail support. After a while he
  became talkative.</p>

  <p>"Our rescue, I see, depends upon the result of the fight. I see also what
  thou hast done for me. To speak fairly, thou hast saved my life at the risk
  of thy own. I make the acknowledgment broadly; and, whatever cometh, thou
  hast my thanks. More than that, if fortune doth but serve me kindly, and we
  get well out of this peril, I will do thee such favor as becometh a Roman who
  hath power and opportunity to prove his gratitude. Yet, yet it is to be seen
  if, with thy good intent, thou hast really done me a kindness; or, rather,
  speaking to thy good-will"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"I would exact of thee a
  promise to do me, in a certain event, the greatest favor one man can do
  another&mdash;and of that let me have thy pledge now."</p>

  <p>"If the thing be not forbidden, I will do it," Ben-Hur replied.</p>

  <p>Arrius rested again.</p>

  <p>"Art thou, indeed, a son of Hur, the Jew?" he next asked.</p>

  <p>"It is as I have said."</p>

  <p>"I knew thy father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Judah drew himself nearer, for the tribune's voice was weak&mdash;he drew
  nearer, and listened eagerly&mdash;at last he thought to hear of home.</p>

  <p>"I knew him, and loved him," Arrius continued.</p>

  <p>There was another pause, during which something diverted the speaker's
  thought.</p>

  <p>"It cannot be," he proceeded, "that thou, a son of his, hast not heard of
  Cato and Brutus. They were very great men, and never as great as in death. In
  their dying, they left this law&mdash;A Roman may not survive his
  good-fortune. Art thou listening?"</p>

  <p>"I hear."</p>

  <p>"It is a custom of gentlemen in Rome to wear a ring. There is one on my
  hand. Take it now."</p>

  <p>He held the hand to Judah, who did as he asked.</p>

  <p>"Now put it on thine own hand."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur did so.</p>

  <p>"The trinket hath its uses," said Arrius next. "I have property and money.
  I am accounted rich even in Rome. I have no family. Show the ring to my
  freedman, who hath control in my absence; you will find him in a villa near
  Misenum. Tell him how it came to thee, and ask anything, or all he may have;
  he will not refuse the demand. If I live, I will do better by thee. I will
  make thee free, and restore thee to thy home and people; or thou mayst give
  thyself to the pursuit that pleaseth thee most. Dost thou hear?"</p>

  <p>"I could not choose but hear."</p>

  <p>"Then pledge me. By the gods&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, good tribune, I am a Jew."</p>

  <p>"By thy God, then, or in the form most sacred to those of thy
  faith&mdash;pledge me to do what I tell thee now, and as I tell thee; I am
  waiting, let me have thy promise."</p>

  <p>"Noble Arrius, I am warned by thy manner to expect something of gravest
  concern. Tell me thy wish first."</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou promise then?"</p>

  <p>"That were to give the pledge, and&mdash; Blessed be the God of my
  fathers! yonder cometh a ship!"</p>

  <p>"In what direction?"</p>

  <p>"From the north."</p>

  <p>"Canst thou tell her nationality by outward signs?"</p>

  <p>"No. My service hath been at the oars."</p>

  <p>"Hath she a flag?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot see one."</p>

  <p>Arrius remained quiet some time, apparently in deep reflection.</p>

  <p>"Does the ship hold this way yet?" he at length asked.</p>

  <p>"Still this way."</p>

  <p>"Look for the flag now."</p>

  <p>"She hath none."</p>

  <p>"Nor any other sign?"</p>

  <p>"She hath a sail set, and is of three banks, and cometh swiftly&mdash;that
  is all I can say of her."</p>

  <p>"A Roman in triumph would have out many flags. She must be an enemy. Hear
  now," said Arrius, becoming grave again, "hear, while yet I may speak. If the
  galley be a pirate, thy life is safe; they may not give thee freedom; they
  may put thee to the oar again; but they will not kill thee. On the other
  hand, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The tribune faltered.</p>

  <p>"Perpol!" he continued, resolutely. "I am too old to submit to dishonor.
  In Rome, let them tell how Quintus Arrius, as became a Roman tribune, went
  down with his ship in the midst of the foe. This is what I would have thee
  do. If the galley prove a pirate, push me from the plank and drown me. Dost
  thou hear? Swear thou wilt do it."</p>

  <p>"I will not swear," said Ben-Hur, firmly; "neither will I do the deed. The
  Law, which is to me most binding, O tribune, would make me answerable for thy
  life. Take back the ring"&mdash;he took the seal from his finger&mdash;"take
  it back, and all thy promises of favor in the event of delivery from this
  peril. The judgment which sent me to the oar for life made me a slave, yet I
  am not a slave; no more am I thy freedman. I am a son of Israel, and this
  moment, at least, my own master. Take back the ring."</p>

  <p>Arrius remained passive.</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt not?" Judah continued. "Not in anger, then, nor in any despite,
  but to free myself from a hateful obligation, I will give thy gift to the
  sea. See, O tribune!"</p>

  <p>He tossed the ring away. Arrius heard the splash where it struck and sank,
  though he did not look.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast done a foolish thing," he said; "foolish for one placed as thou
  art. I am not dependent upon thee for death. Life is a thread I can break
  without thy help; and, if I do, what will become of thee? Men determined on
  death prefer it at the hands of others, for the reason that the soul which
  Plato giveth us is rebellious at the thought of self-destruction; that is
  all. If the ship be a pirate, I will escape from the world. My mind is fixed.
  I am a Roman. Success and honor are all in all. Yet I would have served thee;
  thou wouldst not. The ring was the only witness of my will available in this
  situation. We are both lost. I will die regretting the victory and glory
  wrested from me; thou wilt live to die a little later, mourning the pious
  duties undone because of this folly. I pity thee."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur saw the consequences of his act more distinctly than before, yet
  he did not falter.</p>

  <p>"In the three years of my servitude, O tribune, thou wert the first to
  look upon me kindly. No, no! There was another." The voice dropped, the eyes
  became humid, and he saw plainly as if it were then before him the face of
  the boy who helped him to a drink by the old well at Nazareth. "At least," he
  proceeded, "thou wert the first to ask me who I was; and if, when I reached
  out and caught thee, blind and sinking the last time, I, too, had thought of
  the many ways in which thou couldst be useful to me in my wretchedness, still
  the act was not all selfish; this I pray you to believe. Moreover, seeing as
  God giveth me to know, the ends I dream of are to be wrought by fair means
  alone. As a thing of conscience, I would rather die with thee than be thy
  slayer. My mind is firmly set as thine; though thou wert to offer me all
  Rome, O tribune, and it belonged to thee to make the gift good, I would not
  kill thee. Thy Cato and Brutus were as little children compared to the Hebrew
  whose law a Jew must obey."</p>

  <p>"But my request. Hast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thy command would be of more weight, and that would not move me. I have
  said."</p>

  <p>Both became silent, waiting.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked often at the coming ship. Arrius rested with closed eyes,
  indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Art thou sure she is an enemy?" Ben-Hur asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"She stops, and puts a boat over the side."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou see her flag?"</p>

  <p>"Is there no other sign by which she may be known if Roman?"</p>

  <p>"If Roman, she hath a helmet over the mast's top."</p>

  <p>"Then be of cheer. I see the helmet."</p>

  <p>Still Arrius was not assured.</p>

  <p>"The men in the small boat are taking in the people afloat. Pirates are
  not humane."</p>

  <p>"They may need rowers," Arrius replied, recurring, possibly, to times when
  he had made rescues for the purpose.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was very watchful of the actions of the strangers.</p>

  <p>"The ship moves off," he said.</p>

  <p>"Whither?"</p>

  <p>"Over on our right there is a galley which I take to be deserted. The
  new-comer heads towards it. Now she is alongside. Now she is sending men
  aboard."</p>

  <p>Then Arrius opened his eyes and threw off his calm.</p>

  <p>"Thank thou thy God," he said to Ben-Hur, after a look at the galleys,
  "thank thou thy God, as I do my many gods. A pirate would sink, not save, yon
  ship. By the act and the helmet on the mast I know a Roman. The victory is
  mine. Fortune hath not deserted me. We are saved. Wave thy hand&mdash;call to
  them&mdash;bring them quickly. I shall be duumvir, and thou! I knew thy
  father, and loved him. He was a prince indeed. He taught me a Jew was not a
  barbarian. I will take thee with me. I will make thee my son. Give thy God
  thanks, and call the sailors. Haste! The pursuit must be kept. Not a robber
  shall escape. Hasten them!"</p>

  <p>Judah raised himself upon the plank, and waved his hand, and called with
  all his might; at last he drew the attention of the sailors in the small
  boat, and they were speedily taken up.</p>

  <p>Arrius was received on the galley with all the honors due a hero so the
  favorite of Fortune. Upon a couch on the deck he heard the particulars of the
  conclusion of the fight. When the survivors afloat upon the water were all
  saved and the prize secured, he spread his flag of commandant anew, and
  hurried northward to rejoin the fleet and perfect the victory. In due time
  the fifty vessels coming down the channel closed in upon the fugitive
  pirates, and crushed them utterly; not one escaped. To swell the tribune's
  glory, twenty galleys of the enemy were captured.</p>

  <p>Upon his return from the cruise, Arrius had warm welcome on the mole at
  Misenum. The young man attending him very early attracted the attention of
  his friends there; and to their questions as to who he was the tribune
  proceeded in the most affectionate manner to tell the story of his rescue and
  introduce the stranger, omitting carefully all that pertained to the latter's
  previous history. At the end of the narrative, he called Ben-Hur to him, and
  said, with a hand resting affectionately upon his shoulder,</p>

  <p>"Good friends, this is my son and heir, who, as he is to take my
  property&mdash;if it be the will of the gods that I leave any&mdash;shall be
  known to you by my name. I pray you all to love him as you love me."</p>

  <p>Speedily as opportunity permitted, the adoption was formally perfected.
  And in such manner the brave Roman kept his faith with Ben-Hur, giving him
  happy introduction into the imperial world. The month succeeding Arrius's
  return, the armilustrium was celebrated with the utmost magnificence in the
  theater of Scaurus. One side of the structure was taken up with military
  trophies; among which by far the most conspicuous and most admired were
  twenty prows, complemented by their corresponding aplustra, cut bodily from

  <h2><a id="ch401"
     name="ch401"></a>I. &mdash; BEN-HUR RETURNS EAST</h2>

  <p class="first">The month to which we now come is July, the year that of our
  Lord 29, and the place Antioch, then Queen of the East, and next to Rome the
  strongest, if not the most populous, city in the world.</p>

  <p>There is an opinion that the extravagance and dissoluteness of the age had
  their origin in Rome, and spread thence throughout the empire; that the great
  cities but reflected the manners of their mistress on the Tiber. This may be
  doubted. The reaction of the conquest would seem to have been upon the morals
  of the conqueror. In Greece she found a spring of corruption; so also in
  Egypt; and the student, having exhausted the subject, will close the books
  assured that the flow of the demoralizing river was from the East westwardly,
  and that this very city of Antioch, one of the oldest seats of Assyrian power
  and splendor, was a principal source of the deadly stream.</p>

  <p>A transport galley entered the mouth of the river Orontes from the blue
  waters of the sea. It was in the forenoon. The heat was great, yet all on
  board who could avail themselves of the privilege were on deck&mdash;Ben-Hur
  among others.</p>

  <p>The five years had brought the young Jew to perfect manhood. Though the
  robe of white linen in which he was attired somewhat masked his form, his
  appearance was unusually attractive. For an hour and more he had occupied a
  seat in the shade of the sail, and in that time several fellow-passengers of
  his own nationality had tried to engage him in conversation, but without
  avail. His replies to their questions had been brief, though gravely
  courteous, and in the Latin tongue. The purity of his speech, his cultivated
  manners, his reticence, served to stimulate their curiosity the more. Such as
  observed him closely were struck by an incongruity between his demeanor,
  which had the ease and grace of a patrician, and certain points of his
  person. Thus his arms were disproportionately long; and when, to steady
  himself against the motion of the vessel, he took hold of anything near by,
  the size of his hands and their evident power compelled remark; so the wonder
  who and what he was mixed continually with a wish to know the particulars of
  his life. In other words, his air cannot be better described than as a
  notice&mdash;This man has a story to tell.</p>

  <p>The galley, in coming, had stopped at one of the ports of Cyprus, and
  picked up a Hebrew of most respectable appearance, quiet, reserved, paternal.
  Ben-Hur ventured to ask him some questions; the replies won his confidence,
  and resulted finally in an extended conversation.</p>

  <p>It chanced also that as the galley from Cyprus entered the receiving bay
  of the Orontes, two other vessels which had been sighted out in the sea met
  it and passed into the river at the same time; and as they did so both the
  strangers threw out small flags of brightest yellow. There was much
  conjecture as to the meaning of the signals. At length a passenger addressed
  himself to the respectable Hebrew for information upon the subject.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know the meaning of the flags," he replied; "they do not signify
  nationality&mdash;they are merely marks of ownership."</p>

  <p>"Has the owner many ships?"</p>

  <p>"He has."</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>"I have dealt with him."</p>

  <p>The passengers looked at the speaker as if requesting him to go on.
  Ben-Hur listened with interest.</p>

  <p>"He lives in Antioch," the Hebrew continued, in his quiet way. "That he is
  vastly rich has brought him into notice, and the talk about him is not always
  kind. There used to be in Jerusalem a prince of very ancient family named
  Hur."</p>

  <p>Judah strove to be composed, yet his heart beat quicker.</p>

  <p>"The prince was a merchant, with a genius for business. He set on foot
  many enterprises, some reaching far East, others West. In the great cities he
  had branch houses. The one in Antioch was in charge of a man said by some to
  have been a family servant called Simonides, Greek in name, yet an Israelite.
  The master was drowned at sea. His business, however, went on, and was
  scarcely less prosperous. After a while misfortune overtook the family. The
  prince's only son, nearly grown, tried to kill the procurator Gratus in one
  of the streets of Jerusalem. He failed by a narrow chance, and has not since
  been heard of. In fact, the Roman's rage took in the whole house&mdash;not
  one of the name was left alive. Their palace was sealed up, and is now a
  rookery for pigeons; the estate was confiscated; everything that could be
  traced to the ownership of the Hurs was confiscated. The procurator cured his
  hurt with a golden salve."</p>

  <p>The passengers laughed.</p>

  <p>"You mean he kept the property," said one of them.</p>

  <p>"They say so," the Hebrew replied; "I am only telling a story as I
  received it. And, to go on, Simonides, who had been the prince's agent here
  in Antioch, opened trade in a short time on his own account, and in a space
  incredibly brief became the master merchant of the city. In imitation of his
  master, he sent caravans to India; and on the sea at present he has galleys
  enough to make a royal fleet. They say nothing goes amiss with him. His
  camels do not die, except of old age; his ships never founder; if he throw a
  chip into the river, it will come back to him gold."</p>

  <p>"How long has he been going on thus?"</p>

  <p>"Not ten years."</p>

  <p>"He must have had a good start."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they say the procurator took only the prince's property ready at
  hand&mdash;his horses, cattle, houses, land, vessels, goods. The money could
  not be found, though there must have been vast sums of it. What became of it
  has been an unsolved mystery."</p>

  <p>"Not to me," said a passenger, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"I understand you," the Hebrew answered. "Others have had your idea. That
  it furnished old Simonides his start is a common belief. The procurator is of
  that opinion&mdash;or he has been&mdash;for twice in five years he has caught
  the merchant, and put him to torture."</p>

  <p>Judah griped the rope he was holding with crushing force.</p>

  <p>"It is said," the narrator continued, "that there is not a sound bone in
  the man's body. The last time I saw him he sat in a chair, a shapeless
  cripple, propped against cushions."</p>

  <p>"So tortured!" exclaimed several listeners in a breath.</p>

  <p>"Disease could not have produced such a deformity. Still the suffering
  made no impression upon him. All he had was his lawfully, and he was making
  lawful use of it&mdash;that was the most they wrung from him. Now, however,
  he is past persecution. He has a license to trade signed by Tiberius
  himself."</p>

  <p>"He paid roundly for it, I warrant."</p>

  <p>"These ships are his," the Hebrew continued, passing the remark. "It is a
  custom among his sailors to salute each other upon meeting by throwing out
  yellow flags, sight of which is as much as to say, 'We have had a fortunate
  voyage.'"</p>

  <p>The story ended there.</p>

  <p>When the transport was fairly in the channel of the river, Judah spoke to
  the Hebrew.</p>

  <p>"What was the name of the merchant's master?"</p>

  <p>"Ben-Hur, Prince of Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"What became of the prince's family?"</p>

  <p>"The boy was sent to the galleys. I may say he is dead. One year is the
  ordinary limit of life under that sentence. The widow and daughter have not
  been heard of; those who know what became of them will not speak. They died
  doubtless in the cells of one of the castles which spot the waysides of
  Judea."</p>

  <p>Judah walked to the pilot's quarter. So absorbed was he in thought that he
  scarcely noticed the shores of the river, which from sea to city were
  surpassingly beautiful with orchards of all the Syrian fruits and vines,
  clustered about villas rich as those of Neapolis. No more did he observe the
  vessels passing in an endless fleet, nor hear the singing and shouting of the
  sailors, some in labor, some in merriment. The sky was full of sunlight,
  lying in hazy warmth upon the land and the water; nowhere except over his
  life was there a shadow.</p>

  <p>Once only he awoke to a momentary interest, and that was when some one
  pointed out the Grove of Daphne, discernible from a bend in the river.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch402"
     name="ch402"></a>II. &mdash; ON THE ORONTES</h2>

  <p class="first">When the city came into view, the passengers were on deck,
  eager that nothing of the scene might escape them. The respectable Jew
  already introduced to the reader was the principal spokesman.</p>

  <p>"The river here runs to the west," he said, in the way of general answer.
  "I remember when it washed the base of the walls; but as Roman subjects we
  have lived in peace, and, as always happens in such times, trade has had its
  will; now the whole river front is taken up with wharves and docks.
  Yonder"&mdash;the speaker pointed southward&mdash;"is Mount Casius, or, as
  these people love to call it, the Mountains of Orontes, looking across to its
  brother Amnus in the north; and between them lies the Plain of Antioch.
  Farther on are the Black Mountains, whence the Ducts of the Kings bring the
  purest water to wash the thirsty streets and people; yet they are forests in
  wilderness state, dense, and full of birds and beasts."</p>

  <p>"Where is the lake?" one asked.</p>

  <p>"Over north there. You can take horse, if you wish to see it&mdash;or,
  better, a boat, for a tributary connects it with the river."</p>

  <p>"The Grove of Daphne!" he said, to a third inquirer. "Nobody can describe
  it; only beware! It was begun by Apollo, and completed by him. He prefers it
  to Olympus. People go there for one look&mdash;just one&mdash;and never come
  away. They have a saying which tells it all&mdash;'Better be a worm and feed
  on the mulberries of Daphne than a king's guest.'"</p>

  <p>"Then you advise me to stay away from it?"</p>

  <p>"Not I! Go you will. Everybody goes, cynic philosopher, virile boy, women,
  and priests&mdash;all go. So sure am I of what you will do that I assume to
  advise you. Do not take quarters in the city&mdash;that will be loss of time;
  but go at once to the village in the edge of the grove. The way is through a
  garden, under the spray of fountains. The lovers of the god and his Penaean
  maid built the town; and in its porticos and paths and thousand retreats you
  will find characters and habits and sweets and kinds elsewhere impossible.
  But the wall of the city! there it is, the masterpiece of Xeraeus, the master
  of mural architecture."</p>

  <p>All eyes followed his pointing finger.</p>

  <p>"This part was raised by order of the first of the Seleucidae. Three
  hundred years have made it part of the rock it rests upon."</p>

  <p>The defense justified the encomium. High, solid, and with many bold
  angles, it curved southwardly out of view.</p>

  <p>"On the top there are four hundred towers, each a reservoir of water," the
  Hebrew continued. "Look now! Over the wall, tall as it is, see in the
  distance two hills, which you may know as the rival crests of Sulpius. The
  structure on the farthest one is the citadel, garrisoned all the year round
  by a Roman legion. Opposite it this way rises the Temple of Jupiter, and
  under that the front of the legate's residence&mdash;a palace full of
  offices, and yet a fortress against which a mob would dash harmlessly as a
  south wind."</p>

  <p>At this point the sailors began taking in sail, whereupon the Hebrew
  exclaimed, heartily, "See! you who hate the sea, and you who have vows, get
  ready your curses and your prayers. The bridge yonder, over which the road to
  Seleucia is carried, marks the limit of navigation. What the ship unloads for
  further transit, the camel takes up there. Above the bridge begins the island
  upon which Calinicus built his new city, connecting it with five great
  viaducts so solid time has made no impression upon them, nor floods nor
  earthquakes. Of the main town, my friends, I have only to say you will be
  happier all your lives for having seen it."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, the ship turned and made slowly for her wharf under the
  wall, bringing even more fairly to view the life with which the river at that
  point was possessed. Finally, the lines were thrown, the oars shipped, and
  the voyage was done. Then Ben-Hur sought the respectable Hebrew.</p>

  <p>"Let me trouble you a moment before saying farewell."</p>

  <p>The man bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"Your story of the merchant has made me curious to see him. You called him
  Simonides?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is a Jew with a Greek name."</p>

  <p>"Where is he to be found?"</p>

  <p>The acquaintance gave a sharp look before he answered,</p>

  <p>"I may save you mortification. He is not a money-lender."</p>

  <p>"Nor am I a money-borrower," said Ben-Hur, smiling at the other's
  shrewdness.</p>

  <p>The man raised his head and considered an instant.</p>

  <p>"One would think," he then replied, "that the richest merchant in Antioch
  would have a house for business corresponding to his wealth; but if you would
  find him in the day, follow the river to yon bridge, under which he quarters
  in a building that looks like a buttress of the wall. Before the door there
  is an immense landing, always covered with cargoes come and to go. The fleet
  that lies moored there is his. You cannot fail to find him."</p>

  <p>"I give you thanks."</p>

  <p>"The peace of our fathers go with you."</p>

  <p>"And with you."</p>

  <p>With that they separated.</p>

  <p>Two street-porters, loaded with his baggage, received Ben-Hur's orders
  upon the wharf.</p>

  <p>"To the citadel," he said; a direction which implied an official military
  connection.</p>

  <p>Two great streets, cutting each other at right angles, divided the city
  into quarters. A curious and immense structure, called the Nymphaeum, arose
  at the foot of the one running north and south. When the porters turned south
  there, the new-comer, though fresh from Rome, was amazed at the magnificence
  of the avenue. On the right and left there were palaces, and between them
  extended indefinitely double colonnades of marble, leaving separate ways for
  footmen, beasts, and chariots; the whole under shade, and cooled by fountains
  of incessant flow.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was not in mood to enjoy the spectacle. The story of Simonides
  haunted him. Arrived at the Omphalus&mdash;a monument of four arches wide as
  the streets, superbly illustrated, and erected to himself by Epiphanes, the
  eighth of the Seleucidae&mdash;he suddenly changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"I will not go to the citadel to-night," he said to the porters. "Take me
  to the khan nearest the bridge on the road to Seleucia."</p>

  <p>The party faced about, and in good time he was deposited in a public house
  of primitive but ample construction, within stone's-throw of the bridge under
  which old Simonides had his quarters. He lay upon the house-top through the
  night. In his inner mind lived the thought, "Now&mdash;now I will hear of
  home&mdash;and mother&mdash;and the dear little Tirzah. If they are on earth,
  I will find them."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch403"
     name="ch403"></a>III. &mdash; THE DEMAND ON SIMONIDES</h2>

  <p class="first">Next day early, to the neglect of the city, Ben-Hur sought
  the house of Simonides. Through an embattled gateway he passed to a
  continuity of wharves; thence up the river midst a busy press, to the
  Seleucian Bridge, under which he paused to take in the scene.</p>

  <p>There, directly under the bridge, was the merchant's house, a mass of gray
  stone, unhewn, referable to no style, looking, as the voyager had described
  it, like a buttress of the wall against which it leaned. Two immense doors in
  front communicated with the wharf. Some holes near the top, heavily barred,
  served as windows. Weeds waved from the crevices, and in places black moss
  splotched the otherwise bald stones.</p>

  <p>The doors were open. Through one of them business went in; through the
  other it came out; and there was hurry, hurry in all its movements.</p>

  <p>On the wharf there were piles of goods in every kind of package, and
  groups of slaves, stripped to the waist, going about in the abandon of
  labor.</p>

  <p>Below the bridge lay a fleet of galleys, some loading, others unloading. A
  yellow flag blew out from each masthead. From fleet and wharf, and from ship
  to ship, the bondmen of traffic passed in clamorous counter-currents.</p>

  <p>Above the bridge, across the river, a wall rose from the water's edge,
  over which towered the fanciful cornices and turrets of an imperial palace,
  covering every foot of the island spoken of in the Hebrew's description. But,
  with all its suggestions, Ben-Hur scarcely noticed it. Now, at last, he
  thought to hear of his people&mdash;this, certainly, if Simonides had indeed
  been his father's slave. But would the man acknowledge the relation? That
  would be to give up his riches and the sovereignty of trade so royally
  witnessed on the wharf and river. And what was of still greater consequence
  to the merchant, it would be to forego his career in the midst of amazing
  success, and yield himself voluntarily once more a slave. Simple thought of
  the demand seemed a monstrous audacity. Stripped of diplomatic address, it
  was to say, You are my slave; give me all you have, and&mdash;yourself.</p>

  <p>Yet Ben-Hur derived strength for the interview from faith in his rights
  and the hope uppermost in his heart. If the story to which he was yielding
  were true, Simonides belonged to him, with all he had. For the wealth, be it
  said in justice, he cared nothing. When he started to the door determined in
  mind, it was with a promise to himself&mdash;"Let him tell me of mother and
  Tirzah, and I will give him his freedom without account."</p>

  <p>He passed boldly into the house.</p>

  <p>The interior was that of a vast depot where, in ordered spaces, and under
  careful arrangement, goods of every kind were heaped and pent. Though the
  light was murky and the air stifling, men moved about briskly; and in places
  he saw workmen with saws and hammers making packages for shipments. Down a
  path between the piles he walked slowly, wondering if the man of whose genius
  there were here such abounding proofs could have been his father's slave? If
  so, to what class had he belonged? If a Jew, was he the son of a servant? Or
  was he a debtor or a debtor's son? Or had he been sentenced and sold for
  theft? These thoughts, as they passed, in nowise disturbed the growing
  respect for the merchant of which he was each instant more and more
  conscious. A peculiarity of our admiration for another is that it is always
  looking for circumstances to justify itself.</p>

  <p>At length a man approached and spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"What would you have?"</p>

  <p>"I would see Simonides, the merchant."</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way?"</p>

  <p>By a number of paths left in the stowage, they finally came to a flight of
  steps; ascending which, he found himself on the roof of the depot, and in
  front of a structure which cannot be better described than as a lesser stone
  house built upon another, invisible from the landing below, and out west of
  the bridge under the open sky. The roof, hemmed in by a low wall, seemed like
  a terrace, which, to his astonishment, was brilliant with flowers; in the
  rich surrounding, the house sat squat, a plain square block, unbroken except
  by a doorway in front. A dustless path led to the door, through a bordering
  of shrubs of Persian rose in perfect bloom. Breathing a sweet attar-perfume,
  he followed the guide.</p>

  <p>At the end of a darkened passage within, they stopped before a curtain
  half parted. The man called out,</p>

  <p>"A stranger to see the master."</p>

  <p>A clear voice replied, "In God's name, let him enter."</p>

  <p>A Roman might have called the apartment into which the visitor was ushered
  his atrium. The walls were paneled; each panel was comparted like a modern
  office-desk, and each compartment crowded with labelled folios all filemot
  with age and use. Between the panels, and above and below them, were borders
  of wood once white, now tinted like cream, and carved with marvellous
  intricacy of design. Above a cornice of gilded balls, the ceiling rose in
  pavilion style until it broke into a shallow dome set with hundreds of panes
  of violet mica, permitting a flood of light deliciously reposeful. The floor
  was carpeted with gray rugs so thick that an invading foot fell half buried
  and soundless.</p>

  <p>In the midlight of the room were two persons&mdash;a man resting in a
  chair high-backed, broad-armed, and lined with pliant cushions; and at his
  left, leaning against the back of the chair, a girl well forward into
  womanhood. At sight of them Ben-Hur felt the blood redden his forehead;
  bowing, as much to recover himself as in respect, he lost the lifting of the
  hands, and the shiver and shrink with which the sitter caught sight of
  him&mdash;an emotion as swift to go as it had been to come. When he raised
  his eyes the two were in the same position, except the girl's hand had fallen
  and was resting lightly upon the elder's shoulder; both of them were
  regarding him fixedly.</p>

  <p>"If you are Simonides, the merchant, and a Jew"&mdash;Ben-Hur stopped an
  instant&mdash;"then the peace of the God of our father Abraham upon you
  and&mdash;yours."</p>

  <p>The last word was addressed to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I am the Simonides of whom you speak, by birthright a Jew," the man made
  answer, in a voice singularly clear. "I am Simonides, and a Jew; and I return
  you your salutation, with prayer to know who calls upon me."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked as he listened, and where the figure of the man should have
  been in healthful roundness, there was only a formless heap sunk in the
  depths of the cushions, and covered by a quilted robe of sombre silk. Over
  the heap shone a head royally proportioned&mdash;the ideal head of a
  statesman and conqueror&mdash;a head broad of base and domelike in front,
  such as Angelo would have modelled for Caesar. White hair dropped in thin
  locks over the white brows, deepening the blackness of the eyes shining
  through them like sullen lights. The face was bloodless, and much puffed with
  folds, especially under the chin. In other words, the head and face were
  those of a man who might move the world more readily than the world could
  move him&mdash;a man to be twice twelve times tortured into the shapeless
  cripple he was, without a groan, much less a confession; a man to yield his
  life, but never a purpose or a point; a man born in armor, and assailable
  only through his loves. To him Ben-Hur stretched his hands, open and palm up,
  as he would offer peace at the same time he asked it.</p>

  <p>"I am Judah, son of Ithamar, late head of the House of Hur, and a prince
  of Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>The merchant's right hand lay outside the robe&mdash;a long, thin hand,
  articulate to deformity with suffering. It closed tightly; otherwise there
  was not the slightest expression of feeling of any kind on his part; nothing
  to warrant an inference of surprise or interest; nothing but this calm
  answer,</p>

  <p>"The princes of Jerusalem, of the pure blood, are always welcome in my
  house; you are welcome. Give the young man a seat, Esther."</p>

  <p>The girl took an ottoman near by, and carried it to Ben-Hur. As she arose
  from placing the seat, their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"The peace of our Lord with you," she said, modestly. "Be seated and at
  rest."</p>

  <p>When she resumed her place by the chair, she had not divined his purpose.
  The powers of woman go not so far: if the matter is of finer feeling, such as
  pity, mercy, sympathy, that she detects; and therein is a difference between
  her and man which will endure as long as she remains, by nature, alive to
  such feelings. She was simply sure he brought some wound of life for
  healing.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur did not take the offered seat, but said, deferentially, "I pray
  the good master Simonides that he will not hold me an intruder. Coming up the
  river yesterday, I heard he knew my father."</p>

  <p>"I knew the Prince Hur. We were associated in some enterprises lawful to
  merchants who find profit in lands beyond the sea and the desert. But sit, I
  pray you&mdash;and, Esther, some wine for the young man. Nehemiah speaks of a
  son of Hur who once ruled the half part of Jerusalem; an old house; very old,
  by the faith! In the days of Moses and Joshua even some of them found favor
  in the sight of the Lord, and divided honors with those princes among men. It
  can hardly be that their descendant, lineally come to us, will refuse a cup
  of wine-fat of the genuine vine of Sorek, grown on the south hill-sides of
  Hebron."</p>

  <p>By the time of the conclusion of this speech, Esther was before Ben-Hur
  with a silver cup filled from a vase upon a table a little removed from the
  chair. She offered the drink with downcast face. He touched her hand gently
  to put it away. Again their eyes met; whereat he noticed that she was small,
  not nearly to his shoulder in height; but very graceful, and fair and sweet
  of face, with eyes black and inexpressibly soft. She is kind and pretty, he
  thought, and looks as Tirzah would were she living. Poor Tirzah! Then he said
  aloud,</p>

  <p>"No, thy father&mdash;if he is thy father?"&mdash;he paused.</p>

  <p>"I am Esther, the daughter of Simonides," she said, with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Then, fair Esther, thy father, when he has heard my further speech, will
  not think worse of me if yet I am slow to take his wine of famous extract;
  nor less I hope not to lose grace in thy sight. Stand thou here with me a
  moment!"</p>

  <p>Both of them, as in common cause, turned to the merchant. "Simonides!" he
  said, firmly, "my father, at his death, had a trusted servant of thy name,
  and it has been told me that thou art the man!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden start of the wrenched limbs under the robe, and the
  thin hand clenched.</p>

  <p>"Esther, Esther!" the man called, sternly; "here, not there, as thou art
  thy mother's child and mine&mdash;here, not there, I say!"</p>

  <p>The girl looked once from father to visitor; then she replaced the cup
  upon the table, and went dutifully to the chair. Her countenance sufficiently
  expressed her wonder and alarm.</p>

  <p>Simonides lifted his left hand, and gave it into hers, lying lovingly upon
  his shoulder, and said, dispassionately, "I have grown old in dealing with
  men&mdash;old before my time. If he who told thee that whereof thou speakest
  was a friend acquainted with my history, and spoke of it not harshly, he must
  have persuaded thee that I could not be else than a man distrustful of my
  kind. The God of Israel help him who, at the end of life, is constrained to
  acknowledge so much! My loves are few, but they are. One of them is a soul
  which"&mdash;he carried the hand holding his to his lips, in manner
  unmistakable&mdash;"a soul which to this time has been unselfishly mine, and
  such sweet comfort that, were it taken from me, I would die."</p>

  <p>Esther's head drooped until her cheek touched his.</p>

  <p>"The other love is but a memory; of which I will say further that, like a
  benison of the Lord, it hath a compass to contain a whole family, if
  only"&mdash;his voice lowered and trembled&mdash;"if only I knew where they
  were."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur's face suffused, and, advancing a step, he cried, impulsively, "My
  mother and sister! Oh, it is of them you speak!"</p>

  <p>Esther, as if spoken to, raised her head; but Simonides returned to his
  calm, and answered, coldly, "Hear me to the end. Because I am that I am, and
  because of the loves of which I have spoken, before I make return to thy
  demand touching my relations to the Prince Hur, and as something which of
  right should come first, do thou show me proofs of who thou art. Is thy
  witness in writing? Or cometh it in person?"</p>

  <p>The demand was plain, and the right of it indisputable. Ben-Hur blushed,
  clasped his hands, stammered, and turned away at loss. Simonides pressed
  him.</p>

  <p>"The proofs, the proofs, I say! Set them before me&mdash;lay them in my
  hands!"</p>

  <p>Yet Ben-Hur had no answer. He had not anticipated the requirement; and,
  now that it was made, to him as never before came the awful fact that the
  three years in the galley had carried away all the proofs of his identity;
  mother and sister gone, he did not live in the knowledge of any human being.
  Many there were acquainted with him, but that was all. Had Quintus Arrius
  been present, what could he have said more than where he found him, and that
  he believed the pretender to be the son of Hur? But, as will presently appear
  in full, the brave Roman sailor was dead. Judah had felt the loneliness
  before; to the core of life the sense struck him now. He stood, hands
  clasped, face averted, in stupefaction. Simonides respected his suffering,
  and waited in silence.</p>

  <p>"Master Simonides," he said, at length, "I can only tell my story; and I
  will not that unless you stay judgment so long, and with good-will deign to
  hear me."</p>

  <p>"Speak," said Simonides, now, indeed, master of the
  situation&mdash;"speak, and I will listen the more willingly that I have not
  denied you to be the very person you claim yourself."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur proceeded then, and told his life hurriedly, yet with the feeling
  which is the source of all eloquence; but as we are familiar with it down to
  his landing at Misenum, in company with Arrius, returned victorious from the
  AEgean, at that point we will take up the words.</p>

  <p>"My benefactor was loved and trusted by the emperor, who heaped him with
  honorable rewards. The merchants of the East contributed magnificent
  presents, and he became doubly rich among the rich of Rome. May a Jew forget
  his religion? or his birthplace, if it were the Holy Land of our fathers? The
  good man adopted me his son by formal rites of law; and I strove to make him
  just return: no child was ever more dutiful to father than I to him. He would
  have had me a scholar; in art, philosophy, rhetoric, oratory, he would have
  furnished me the most famous teacher. I declined his insistence, because I
  was a Jew, and could not forget the Lord God, or the glory of the prophets,
  or the city set on the hills by David and Solomon. Oh, ask you why I accepted
  any of the benefactions of the Roman? I loved him; next place, I thought with
  his help, array influences which would enable me one day to unseal the
  mystery close-locking the fate of my mother and sister; and to these there
  was yet another motive of which I shall not speak except to say it controlled
  me so far that I devoted myself to arms, and the acquisition of everything
  deemed essential to thorough knowledge of the art of war. In the palaestrae
  and circuses of the city I toiled, and in the camps no less; and in all of
  them I have a name, but not that of my fathers. The crowns I won&mdash;and on
  the walls of the villa by Misenum there are many of them&mdash;all came to me
  as the son of Arrius, the duumvir. In that relation only am I known among
  Romans.... In steadfast pursuit of my secret aim, I left Rome for Antioch,
  intending to accompany the Consul Maxentius in the campaign he is organizing
  against the Parthians. Master of personal skill in all arms, I seek now the
  higher knowledge pertaining to the conduct of bodies of men in the field. The
  consul has admitted me one of his military family. But yesterday, as our ship
  entered the Orontes, two other ships sailed in with us flying yellow flags. A
  fellow-passenger and countryman from Cyprus explained that the vessels
  belonged to Simonides, the master-merchant of Antioch; he told us, also, who
  the merchant was; his marvellous success in commerce; of his fleets and
  caravans, and their coming and going; and, not knowing I had interest in the
  theme beyond my associate listeners, he said Simonides was a Jew, once the
  servant of the Prince Hur; nor did he conceal the cruelties of Gratus, or the
  purpose of their infliction."</p>

  <p>At this allusion Simonides bowed his head, and, as if to help him conceal
  his feelings and her own deep sympathy, the daughter hid her face on his
  neck. Directly he raised his eyes, and said, in a clear voice, "I am
  listening."</p>

  <p>"O good Simonides!" Ben-Hur then said, advancing a step, his whole soul
  seeking expression, "I see thou art not convinced, and that yet I stand in
  the shadow of thy distrust."</p>

  <p>The merchant held his features fixed as marble, and his tongue as
  still.</p>

  <p>"And not less clearly, I see the difficulties of my position," Ben-Hur
  continued. "All my Roman connection I can prove; I have only to call upon the
  consul, now the guest of the governor of the city; but I cannot prove the
  particulars of thy demand upon me. I cannot prove I am my father's son. They
  who could serve me in that&mdash;alas! they are dead or lost."</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands; whereupon Esther arose, and, taking
  the rejected cup to him, said, "The wine is of the country we all so love.
  Drink, I pray thee!"</p>

  <p>The voice was sweet as that of Rebekah offering drink at the well near
  Nahor the city; he saw there were tears in her eyes, and he drank, saying,
  "Daughter of Simonides, thy heart is full of goodness; and merciful art thou
  to let the stranger share it with thy father. Be thou blessed of our God! I
  thank thee."</p>

  <p>Then he addressed himself to the merchant again:</p>

  <p>"As I have no proof that I am my father's son, I will withdraw that I
  demanded of thee, O Simonides, and go hence to trouble you no more; only let
  me say I did not seek thy return to servitude nor account of thy fortune; in
  any event, I would have said, as now I say, that all which is product of thy
  labor and genius is thine; keep it in welcome. I have no need of any part
  thereof. When the good Quintus, my second father, sailed on the voyage which
  was his last, he left me his heir, princely rich. If, therefore, thou cost
  think of me again, be it with remembrance of this question, which, as I do
  swear by the prophets and Jehovah, thy God and mine, was the chief purpose of
  my coming here: What cost thou know&mdash;what canst thou tell me&mdash;of my
  mother and Tirzah, my sister&mdash;she who should be in beauty and grace even
  as this one, thy sweetness of life, if not thy very life? Oh! what canst thou
  tell me of them?"</p>

  <p>The tears ran down Esther's cheeks; but the man was wilful: in a clear
  voice, he replied,</p>

  <p>"I have said I knew the Prince Ben-Hur. I remember hearing of the
  misfortune which overtook his family. I remember the bitterness with which I
  heard it. He who wrought such misery to the widow of my friend is the same
  who, in the same spirit, hath since wrought upon me. I will go further, and
  say to you, I have made diligent quest concerning the family, but&mdash;I
  have nothing to tell you of them. They are lost."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur uttered a great groan.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then it is another hope broken!" he said, struggling with his
  feelings. "I am used to disappointments. I pray you pardon my intrusion; and
  if I have occasioned you annoyance, forgive it because of my sorrow. I have
  nothing now to live for but vengeance. Farewell."</p>

  <p>At the curtain he turned, and said, simply, "I thank you both."</p>

  <p>"Peace go with you," the merchant said.</p>

  <p>Esther could not speak for sobbing.</p>

  <p>And so he departed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch404"
     name="ch404"></a>IV. &mdash; SIMONIDES AND ESTHER</h2>

  <p class="first">Scarcely was Ben-Hur gone, when Simonides seemed to wake as
  from sleep: his countenance flushed; the sullen light of his eyes changed to
  brightness; and he said, cheerily,</p>

  <p>"Esther, ring&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>She went to the table, and rang a service-bell.</p>

  <p>One of the panels in the wall swung back, exposing a doorway which gave
  admittance to a man who passed round to the merchant's front, and saluted him
  with a half-salaam.</p>

  <p>"Malluch, here&mdash;nearer&mdash;to the chair," the master said,
  imperiously. "I have a mission which shall not fail though the sun should.
  Hearken! A young man is now descending to the store-room&mdash;tall, comely,
  and in the garb of Israel; follow him, his shadow not more faithful; and
  every night send me report of where he is, what he does, and the company he
  keeps; and if, without discovery, you overhear his conversations, report them
  word for word, together with whatever will serve to expose him, his habits,
  motives, life. Understand you? Go quickly! Stay, Malluch: if he leave the
  city, go after him&mdash;and, mark you, Malluch, be as a friend. If he
  bespeak you, tell him what you will to the occasion most suited, except that
  you are in my service, of that, not a word. Haste&mdash;make haste!"</p>

  <p>The man saluted as before, and was gone.</p>

  <p>Then Simonides rubbed his wan hands together, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"What is the day, daughter?" he said, in the midst of the mood. "What is
  the day? I wish to remember it for happiness come. See, and look for it
  laughing, and laughing tell me, Esther."</p>

  <p>The merriment seemed unnatural to her; and, as if to entreat him from it,
  she answered, sorrowfully, "Woe's me, father, that I should ever forget this
  day!"</p>

  <p>His hands fell down the instant, and his chin, dropping upon his breast,
  lost itself in the muffling folds of flesh composing his lower face.</p>

  <p>"True, most true, my daughter!" he said, without looking up. "This is the
  twentieth day of the fourth month. To-day, five years ago, my Rachel, thy
  mother, fell down and died. They brought me home broken as thou seest me, and
  we found her dead of grief. Oh, to me she was a cluster of camphire in the
  vineyards of En-Gedi! I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my
  honeycomb with my honey. We laid her away in a lonely place&mdash;in a tomb
  cut in the mountain; no one near her. Yet in the darkness she left me a
  little light, which the years have increased to a brightness of morning." He
  raised his hand and rested it upon his daughter's head. "Dear Lord, I thank
  thee that now in my Esther my lost Rachel liveth again!"</p>

  <p>Directly he lifted his head, and said, as with a sudden thought, "Is it
  not clear day outside?"</p>

  <p>"It was, when the young man came in."</p>

  <p>"Then let Abimelech come and take me to the garden, where I can see the
  river and the ships, and I will tell thee, dear Esther, why but now my mouth
  filled with laughter, and my tongue with singing, and my spirit was like to a
  roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices."</p>

  <p>In answer to the bell a servant came, and at her bidding pushed the chair,
  set on little wheels for the purpose, out of the room to the roof of the
  lower house, called by him his garden. Out through the roses, and by beds of
  lesser flowers, all triumphs of careful attendance, but now unnoticed, he was
  rolled to a position from which he could view the palace-tops over against
  him on the island, the bridge in lessening perspective to the farther shore,
  and the river below the bridge crowded with vessels, all swimming amidst the
  dancing splendors of the early sun upon the rippling water. There the servant
  left him with Esther.</p>

  <p>The much shouting of laborers, and their beating and pounding, did not
  disturb him any more than the tramping of people on the bridge floor almost
  overhead, being as familiar to his ear as the view before him to his eye, and
  therefore unnoticeable, except as suggestions of profits in promise.</p>

  <p>Esther sat on the arm of the chair nursing his hand, and waiting his
  speech, which came at length in the calm way, the mighty will having carried
  him back to himself.</p>

  <p>"When the young man was speaking, Esther, I observed thee, and thought
  thou wert won by him."</p>

  <p>Her eyes fell as she replied,</p>

  <p>"Speak you of faith, father, I believed him."</p>

  <p>"In thy eyes, then, he is the lost son of the Prince Hur?"</p>

  <p>"If he is not&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"And if he is not, Esther?"</p>

  <p>"I have been thy handmaiden, father, since my mother answered the call of
  the Lord God; by thy side I have heard and seen thee deal in wise ways with
  all manner of men seeking profit, holy and unholy; and now I say, if indeed
  the young man be not the prince he claims to be, then before me falsehood
  never played so well the part of righteous truth."</p>

  <p>"By the glory of Solomon, daughter, thou speakest earnestly. Dost thou
  believe thy father his father's servant?"</p>

  <p>"I understood him to ask of that as something he had but heard."</p>

  <p>For a time Simonides' gaze swam among his swimming ships, though they had
  no place in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Well, thou art a good child, Esther, of genuine Jewish shrewdness, and of
  years and strength to hear a sorrowful tale. Wherefore give me heed, and I
  will tell you of myself, and of thy mother, and of many things pertaining to
  the past not in thy knowledge or thy dreams&mdash;things withheld from the
  persecuting Romans for a hope's sake, and from thee that thy nature should
  grow towards the Lord straight as the reed to the sun.... I was born in a
  tomb in the valley of Hinnom, on the south side of Zion. My father and mother
  were Hebrew bond-servants, tenders of the fig and olive trees growing, with
  many vines, in the King's Garden hard by Siloam; and in my boyhood I helped
  them. They were of the class bound to serve forever. They sold me to the
  Prince Hur, then, next to Herod the King, the richest man in Jerusalem. From
  the garden he transferred me to his storehouse in Alexandria of Egypt, where
  I came of age. I served him six years, and in the seventh, by the law of
  Moses, I went free."</p>

  <p>Esther clapped her hands lightly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then, thou art not his father's servant!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, daughter, hear. Now, in those days there were lawyers in the
  cloisters of the Temple who disputed vehemently, saying the children of
  servants bound forever took the condition of their parents; but the Prince
  Hur was a man righteous in all things, and an interpreter of the law after
  the straitest sect, though not of them. He said I was a Hebrew servant
  bought, in the true meaning of the great lawgiver, and, by sealed writings,
  which I yet have, he set me free."</p>

  <p>"And my mother?" Esther asked.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt hear all, Esther; be patient. Before I am through thou shalt
  see it were easier for me to forget myself than thy mother.... At the end of
  my service, I came up to Jerusalem to the Passover. My master entertained me.
  I was in love with him already, and I prayed to be continued in his service.
  He consented, and I served him yet another seven years, but as a hired son of
  Israel. In his behalf I had charge of ventures on the sea by ships, and of
  ventures on land by caravans eastward to Susa and Persepolis, and the lands
  of silk beyond them. Perilous passages were they, my daughter; but the Lord
  blessed all I undertook. I brought home vast gains for the prince, and richer
  knowledge for myself, without which I could not have mastered the charges
  since fallen to me.... One day I was a guest in his house in Jerusalem. A
  servant entered with some sliced bread on a platter. She came to me first. It
  was then I saw thy mother, and loved her, and took her away in my secret
  heart. After a while a time came when I sought the prince to make her my
  wife. He told me she was bond-servant forever; but if she wished, he would
  set her free that I might be gratified. She gave me love for love, but was
  happy where she was, and refused her freedom. I prayed and besought, going
  again and again after long intervals. She would be my wife, she all the time
  said, if I would become her fellow in servitude. Our father Jacob served yet
  other seven years for his Rachel. Could I not as much for mine? But thy
  mother said I must become as she, to serve forever. I came away, but went
  back. Look, Esther, look here."</p>

  <p>He pulled out the lobe of his left ear.</p>

  <p>"See you not the scar of the awl?"</p>

  <p>"I see it," she said; "and, oh, I see how thou didst love my mother!"</p>

  <p>"Love her, Esther! She was to me more than the Shulamite to the singing
  king, fairer, more spotless; a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters,
  and streams from Lebanon. The master, even as I required him, took me to the
  judges, and back to his door, and thrust the awl through my ear into the
  door, and I was his servant forever. So I won my Rachel. And was ever love
  like mine?"</p>

  <p>Esther stooped and kissed him, and they were silent, thinking of the
  dead.</p>

  <p>"My master was drowned at sea, the first sorrow that ever fell upon me,"
  the merchant continued. "There was mourning in his house, and in mine here in
  Antioch, my abiding-place at the time. Now, Esther, mark you! When the good
  prince was lost, I had risen to be his chief steward, with everything of
  property belonging to him in my management and control. Judge you how much he
  loved and trusted me! I hastened to Jerusalem to render account to the widow.
  She continued me in the stewardship. I applied myself with greater diligence.
  The business prospered, and grew year by year. Ten years passed; then came
  the blow which you heard the young man tell about&mdash;the accident, as he
  called it, to the Procurator Gratus. The Roman gave it out an attempt to
  assassinate him. Under that pretext, by leave from Rome, he confiscated to
  his own use the immense fortune of the widow and children. Nor stopped he
  there. That there might be no reversal of the judgment, he removed all the
  parties interested. From that dreadful day to this the family of Hur have
  been lost. The son, whom I had seen as a child, was sentenced to the galleys.
  The widow and daughter are supposed to have been buried in some of the many
  dungeons of Judea, which, once closed upon the doomed, are like sepulchers
  sealed and locked. They passed from the knowledge of men as utterly as if the
  sea had swallowed them unseen. We could not hear how they died&mdash;nay, not
  even that they were dead."</p>

  <p>Esther's eyes were dewy with tears.</p>

  <p>"Thy heart is good, Esther, good as thy mother's was; and I pray it have
  not the fate of most good hearts&mdash;to be trampled upon by the unmerciful
  and blind. But hearken further. I went up to Jerusalem to give help to my
  benefactress, and was seized at the gate of the city and carried to the
  sunken cells of the Tower of Antonia; why, I knew not, until Gratus himself
  came and demanded of me the moneys of the House of Hur, which he knew, after
  our Jewish custom of exchange, were subject to my draft in the different
  marts of the world. He required me to sign to his order. I refused. He had
  the houses, lands, goods, ships, and movable property of those I served; he
  had not their moneys. I saw, if I kept favor in the sight of the Lord, I
  could rebuild their broken fortunes. I refused the tyrant's demands. He put
  me to torture; my will held good, and he set me free, nothing gained. I came
  home and began again, in the name of Simonides of Antioch, instead of the
  Prince Hur of Jerusalem. Thou knowest, Esther, how I have prospered; that the
  increase of the millions of the prince in my hands was miraculous; thou
  knowest how, at the end of three years, while going up to Caesarea, I was
  taken and a second time tortured by Gratus to compel a confession that my
  goods and moneys were subject to his order of confiscation; thou knowest he
  failed as before. Broken in body, I came home and found my Rachel dead of
  fear and grief for me. The Lord our God reigned, and I lived. From the
  emperor himself I bought immunity and license to trade throughout the world.
  To-day&mdash;praised be He who maketh the clouds his chariot and walketh upon
  the winds!&mdash;to-day, Esther, that which was in my hands for stewardship
  is multiplied into talents sufficient to enrich a Caesar."</p>

  <p>He lifted his head proudly; their eyes met; each read the other's thought.
  "What shall I with the treasure, Esther?" he asked, without lowering his
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"My father," she answered, in a low voice, "did not the rightful owner
  call for it but now?"</p>

  <p>Still his look did not fail.</p>

  <p>"And thou, my child; shall I leave thee a beggar?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, father, am not I, because I am thy child, his bond-servant? And of
  whom was it written, 'Strength and honor are her clothing, and she shall
  rejoice in time to come?'"</p>

  <p>A gleam of ineffable love lighted his face as he said, "The Lord hath been
  good to me in many ways; but thou, Esther, art the sovereign excellence of
  his favor."</p>

  <p>He drew her to his breast and kissed her many times.</p>

  <p>"Hear now," he said, with clearer voice&mdash;"hear now why I laughed this
  morning. The young man faced me the apparition of his father in comely youth.
  My spirit arose to salute him. I felt my trial-days were over and my labors
  ended. Hardly could I keep from crying out. I longed to take him by the hand
  and show the balance I had earned, and say, 'Lo, 'tis all thine! and I am thy
  servant, ready now to be called away.' And so I would have done, Esther, so I
  would have done, but that moment three thoughts rushed to restrain me. I will
  be sure he is my master's son&mdash;such was the first thought; if he is my
  master's son, I will learn somewhat of his nature. Of those born to riches,
  bethink you, Esther, how many there are in whose hands riches are but
  breeding curses"&mdash;he paused, while his hands clutched, and his voice
  shrilled with passion&mdash;"Esther, consider the pains I endured at the
  Roman's hands; nay, not Gratus's alone: the merciless wretches who did his
  bidding the first time and the last were Romans, and they all alike laughed
  to hear me scream. Consider my broken body, and the years I have gone shorn
  of my stature; consider thy mother yonder in her lonely tomb, crushed of soul
  as I of body; consider the sorrows of my master's family if they are living,
  and the cruelty of their taking-off if they are dead; consider all, and, with
  Heaven's love about thee, tell me, daughter, shall not a hair fall or a red
  drop run in expiation? Tell me not, as the preachers sometimes do&mdash;tell
  me not that vengeance is the Lord's. Does he not work his will harmfully as
  well as in love by agencies? Has he not his men of war more numerous than his
  prophets? Is not his the law, Eye for eye, hand for hand, foot for foot? Oh,
  in all these years I have dreamed of vengeance, and prayed and provided for
  it, and gathered patience from the growing of my store, thinking and
  promising, as the Lord liveth, it will one day buy me punishment of the
  wrong-doers? And when, speaking of his practise with arms, the young man said
  it was for a nameless purpose, I named the purpose even as he
  spoke&mdash;vengeance! and that, Esther, that it was&mdash;the third thought
  which held me still and hard while his pleading lasted, and made me laugh
  when he was gone."</p>

  <p>Esther caressed the faded hands, and said, as if her spirit with his were
  running forward to results, "He is gone. Will he come again?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, Malluch the faithful goes with him, and will bring him back when I am
  ready."</p>

  <p>"And when will that be, father?"</p>

  <p>"Not long, not long. He thinks all his witnesses dead. There is one living
  who will not fail to know him, if he be indeed my master's son."</p>

  <p>"His mother?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, daughter, I will set the witness before him; till then let us rest
  the business with the Lord. I am tired. Call Abimelech."</p>

  <p>Esther called the servant, and they returned into the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch405"
     name="ch405"></a>V. &mdash; THE GROVE OF DAPHNE</h2>

  <p class="first">When Ben-Hur sallied from the great warehouse, it was with
  the thought that another failure was to be added to the many he had already
  met in the quest for his people; and the idea was depressing exactly in
  proportion as the objects of his quest were dear to him; it curtained him
  round about with a sense of utter loneliness on earth, which, more than
  anything else, serves to eke from a soul cast down its remaining interest in
  life.</p>

  <p>Through the people, and the piles of goods, he made way to the edge of the
  landing, and was tempted by the cool shadows darkening the river's depth. The
  lazy current seemed to stop and wait for him. In counteraction of the spell,
  the saying of the voyager flashed into memory&mdash;"Better be a worm, and
  feed upon the mulberries of Daphne, than a king's guest." He turned, and
  walked rapidly down the landing and back to the khan.</p>

  <p>"The road to Daphne!" the steward said, surprised at the question Ben-Hur
  put to him. "You have not been here before? Well, count this the happiest day
  of your life. You cannot mistake the road. The next street to the left, going
  south, leads straight to Mount Sulpius, crowned by the altar of Jupiter and
  the Amphitheater; keep it to the third cross street, known as Herod's
  Colonnade; turn to your right there, and hold the way through the old city of
  Seleucus to the bronze gates of Epiphanes. There the road to Daphne
  begins&mdash;and may the gods keep you!"</p>

  <p>A few directions respecting his baggage, and Ben-Hur set out.</p>

  <p>The Colonnade of Herod was easily found; thence to the brazen gates, under
  a continuous marble portico, he passed with a multitude mixed of people from
  all the trading nations of the earth.</p>

  <p>It was about the fourth hour of the day when he passed out the gate, and
  found himself one of a procession apparently interminable, moving to the
  famous Grove. The road was divided into separate ways for footmen, for men on
  horses, and men in chariots; and those again into separate ways for outgoers
  and incomers. The lines of division were guarded by low balustrading, broken
  by massive pedestals, many of which were surmounted with statuary. Right and
  left of the road extended margins of sward perfectly kept, relieved at
  intervals by groups of oak and sycamore trees, and vine-clad summer-houses
  for the accommodation of the weary, of whom, on the return side, there were
  always multitudes. The ways of the footmen were paved with red stone, and
  those of the riders strewn with white sand compactly rolled, but not so solid
  as to give back an echo to hoof or wheel. The number and variety of fountains
  at play were amazing, all gifts of visiting kings, and called after them. Out
  southwest to the gates of the Grove, the magnificent thoroughfare stretched a
  little over four miles from the city.</p>

  <p>In his wretchedness of feeling, Ben-Hur barely observed the royal
  liberality which marked the construction of the road. Nor more did he at
  first notice the crowd going with him. He treated the processional displays
  with like indifference. To say truth, besides his self-absorption, he had not
  a little of the complacency of a Roman visiting the provinces fresh from the
  ceremonies which daily eddied round and round the golden pillar set up by
  Augustus as the centre of the world. It was not possible for the provinces to
  offer anything new or superior. He rather availed himself of every
  opportunity to push forward through the companies in the way, and too
  slow-going for his impatience. By the time he reached Heracleia, a suburban
  village intermediate the city and the Grove, he was somewhat spent with
  exercise, and began to be susceptible of entertainment. Once a pair of goats
  led by a beautiful woman, woman and goats alike brilliant with ribbons and
  flowers, attracted his attention. Then he stopped to look at a bull of mighty
  girth, and snowy white, covered with vines freshly cut, and bearing on its
  broad back a naked child in a basket, the image of a young Bacchus, squeezing
  the juice of ripened berries into a goblet, and drinking with libational
  formulas. As he resumed his walk, he wondered whose altars would be enriched
  by the offerings. A horse went by with clipped mane, after the fashion of the
  time, his rider superbly dressed. He smiled to observe the harmony of pride
  between the man and the brute. Often after that he turned his head at hearing
  the rumble of wheels and the dull thud of hoofs; unconsciously he was
  becoming interested in the styles of chariots and charioteers, as they
  rustled past him going and coming. Nor was it long until he began to make
  notes of the people around him. He saw they were of all ages, sexes, and
  conditions, and all in holiday attire. One company was uniformed in white,
  another in black; some bore flags, some smoking censers; some went slowly,
  singing hymns; others stepped to the music of flutes and tabrets. If such
  were the going to Daphne every day in the year, what a wondrous sight Daphne
  must be! At last there was a clapping of hands, and a burst of joyous cries;
  following the pointing of many fingers, he looked and saw upon the brow of a
  hill the templed gate of the consecrated Grove. The hymns swelled to louder
  strains; the music quickened time; and, borne along by the impulsive current,
  and sharing the common eagerness, he passed in, and, Romanized in taste as he
  was, fell to worshiping the place.</p>

  <p>Rearward of the structure which graced the entrance-way&mdash;a purely
  Grecian pile&mdash;he stood upon a broad esplanade paved with polished stone;
  around him a restless exclamatory multitude, in gayest colors, relieved
  against the iridescent spray flying crystal-white from fountains; before him,
  off to the southwest, dustless paths radiated out into a garden, and beyond
  that into a forest, over which rested a veil of pale-blue vapor. Ben-Hur
  gazed wistfully, uncertain where to go. A woman that moment exclaimed,</p>

  <p>"Beautiful! But where to now?"</p>

  <p>Her companion, wearing a chaplet of bays, laughed and answered, "Go to,
  thou pretty barbarian! The question implies an earthly fear; and did we not
  agree to leave all such behind in Antioch with the rusty earth? The winds
  which blow here are respirations of the gods. Let us give ourselves to
  waftage of the winds."</p>

  <p>"But if we should get lost?"</p>

  <p>"O thou timid! No one was ever lost in Daphne, except those on whom her
  gates close forever."</p>

  <p>"And who are they?" she asked, still fearful.</p>

  <p>"Such as have yielded to the charms of the place and chosen it for life
  and death. Hark! Stand we here, and I will show you of whom I speak."</p>

  <p>Upon the marble pavement there was a scurry of sandalled feet; the crowd
  opened, and a party of girls rushed about the speaker and his fair friend,
  and began singing and dancing to the tabrets they themselves touched. The
  woman, scared, clung to the man, who put an arm about her, and, with kindled
  face, kept time to the music with the other hand overhead. The hair of the
  dancers floated free, and their limbs blushed through the robes of gauze
  which scarcely draped them. Words may not be used to tell of the
  voluptuousness of the dance. One brief round, and they darted off through the
  yielding crowd lightly as they had come.</p>

  <p>"Now what think you?" cried the man to the woman.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Devadasi&mdash;priestesses devoted to the Temple of Apollo. There is an
  army of them. They make the chorus in celebrations. This is their home.
  Sometimes they wander off to other cities, but all they make is brought here
  to enrich the house of the divine musician. Shall we go now?"</p>

  <p>Next minute the two were gone.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took comfort in the assurance that no one was ever lost in Daphne,
  and he, too, set out&mdash;where, he knew not.</p>

  <p>A sculpture reared upon a beautiful pedestal in the garden attracted him
  first. It proved to be the statue of a centaur. An inscription informed the
  unlearned visitor that it exactly represented Chiron, the beloved of Apollo
  and Diana, instructed by them in the mysteries of hunting, medicine, music,
  and prophecy. The inscription also bade the stranger look out at a certain
  part of the heavens, at a certain hour of the clear night, and he would
  behold the dead alive among the stars, whither Jupiter had transferred the
  good genius.</p>

  <p>The wisest of the centaurs continued, nevertheless, in the service of
  mankind. In his hand he held a scroll, on which, graven in Greek, were
  paragraphs of a notice:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"O Traveller! "Art thou a stranger?</p>

  <p class="quote">"I. Hearken to the singing of the brooks, and fear not the
  rain of the fountains; so will the Naiades learn to love thee.</p>

  <p class="quote">"II. The invited breezes of Daphne are Zephyrus and Auster;
  gentle ministers of life, they will gather sweets for thee; when Eurus blows,
  Diana is elsewhere hunting; when Boreas blusters, go hide, for Apollo is
  angry.</p>

  <p class="quote">"III. The shades of the Grove are thine in the day; at night
  they belong to Pan and his Dryades. Disturb them not.</p>

  <p class="quote">"IV. Eat of the Lotus by the brooksides sparingly, unless
  thou wouldst have surcease of memory, which is to become a child of
  Daphne.</p>

  <p class="quote">"V. Walk thou round the weaving spider&mdash;'tis Arachne at
  work for Minerva.</p>

  <p class="quote">"VI. Wouldst thou behold the tears of Daphne, break but a
  bud from a laurel bough&mdash;and die.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Heed thou! "And stay and be happy."</p><br>

  <p>Ben-Hur left the interpretation of the mystic notice to others fast
  enclosing him, and turned away as the white bull was led by. The boy sat in
  the basket, followed by a procession; after them again, the woman with the
  goats; and behind her the flute and tabret players, and another procession of
  gift-bringers.</p>

  <p>"Whither go they?" asked a bystander.</p>

  <p>Another made answer, "The bull to Father Jove; the goat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did not Apollo once keep the flocks of Admetus?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, the goat to Apollo!"</p>

  <p>The goodness of the reader is again besought in favor of an explanation. A
  certain facility of accommodation in the matter of religion comes to us after
  much intercourse with people of a different faith; gradually we attain the
  truth that every creed is illustrated by good men who are entitled to our
  respect, but whom we cannot respect without courtesy to their creed. To this
  point Ben-Hur had arrived. Neither the years in Rome nor those in the galley
  had made any impression upon his religious faith; he was yet a Jew. In his
  view, nevertheless, it was not an impiety to look for the beautiful in the
  Grove of Daphne.</p>

  <p>The remark does not interdict the further saying, if his scruples had been
  ever so extreme, not improbably he would at this time have smothered them. He
  was angry; not as the irritable, from chafing of a trifle; nor was his anger
  like the fool's, pumped from the wells of nothing, to be dissipated by a
  reproach or a curse; it was the wrath peculiar to ardent natures rudely
  awakened by the sudden annihilation of a hope&mdash;dream, if you
  will&mdash;in which the choicest happinesses were thought to be certainly in
  reach. In such case nothing intermediate will carry off the passion&mdash;the
  quarrel is with Fate.</p>

  <p>Let us follow the philosophy a little further, and say to ourselves, it
  were well in such quarrels if Fate were something tangible, to be despatched
  with a look or a blow, or a speaking personage with whom high words were
  possible; then the unhappy mortal would not always end the affair by
  punishing himself.</p>

  <p>In ordinary mood, Ben-Hur would not have come to the Grove alone, or,
  coming alone, he would have availed himself of his position in the consul's
  family, and made provision against wandering idly about, unknowing and
  unknown; he would have had all the points of interest in mind, and gone to
  them under guidance, as in the despatch of business; or, wishing to squander
  days of leisure in the beautiful place, he would have had in hand a letter to
  the master of it all, whoever he might be. This would have made him a
  sightseer, like the shouting herd he was accompanying; whereas he had no
  reverence for the deities of the Grove, nor curiosity; a man in the blindness
  of bitter disappointment, he was adrift, not waiting for Fate, but seeking it
  as a desperate challenger.</p>

  <p>Every one has known this condition of mind, though perhaps not all in the
  same degree; every one will recognize it as the condition in which he has
  done brave things with apparent serenity; and every one reading will say,
  Fortunate for Ben-Hur if the folly which now catches him is but a friendly
  harlequin with whistle and painted cap, and not some Violence with a pointed
  sword pitiless.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch406"
     name="ch406"></a>VI. &mdash; THE MULBERRIES OF DAPHNE</h2>

  <p class="first">Ben-Hur entered the woods with the processions. He had not
  interest enough at first to ask where they were going; yet, to relieve him
  from absolute indifference, he had a vague impression that they were in
  movement to the temples, which were the central objects of the Grove, supreme
  in attractions.</p>

  <p>Presently, as singers dreamfully play with a flitting chorus, he began
  repeating to himself, "Better be a worm, and feed on the mulberries of
  Daphne, than a king's guest." Then of the much repetition arose questions
  importunate of answer. Was life in the Grove so very sweet? Wherein was the
  charm? Did it lie in some tangled depth of philosophy? Or was it something in
  fact, something on the surface, discernible to every-day wakeful senses?
  Every year thousands, forswearing the world, gave themselves to service here.
  Did they find the charm? And was it sufficient, when found, to induce
  forgetfulness profound enough to shut out of mind the infinitely diverse
  things of life? those that sweeten and those that embitter? hopes hovering in
  the near future as well as sorrows born of the past? If the Grove were so
  good for them, why should it not be good for him? He was a Jew; could it be
  that the excellences were for all the world but children of Abraham?
  Forthwith he bent all his faculties to the task of discovery, unmindful of
  the singing of the gift-bringers and the quips of his associates.</p>

  <p>In the quest, the sky yielded him nothing; it was blue, very blue, and
  full of twittering swallows&mdash;so was the sky over the city.</p>

  <p>Further on, out of the woods at his right hand, a breeze poured across the
  road, splashing him with a wave of sweet smells, blent of roses and consuming
  spices. He stopped, as did others, looking the way the breeze came.</p>

  <p>"A garden over there?" he said, to a man at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Rather some priestly ceremony in performance&mdash;something to Diana, or
  Pan, or a deity of the woods."</p>

  <p>The answer was in his mother tongue. Ben-Hur gave the speaker a surprised
  look.</p>

  <p>"A Hebrew?" he asked him.</p>

  <p>The man replied with a deferential smile,</p>

  <p>"I was born within a stone's-throw of the market-place in Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was proceeding to further speech, when the crowd surged forward,
  thrusting him out on the side of the walk next the woods, and carrying the
  stranger away. The customary gown and staff, a brown cloth on the head tied
  by a yellow rope, and a strong Judean face to avouch the garments of honest
  right, remained in the young man's mind, a kind of summary of the man.</p>

  <p>This took place at a point where a path into the woods began, offering a
  happy escape from the noisy processions. Ben-Hur availed himself of the
  offer.</p>

  <p>He walked first into a thicket which, from the road, appeared in a state
  of nature, close, impenetrable, a nesting-place for wild birds. A few steps,
  however, gave him to see the master's hand even there. The shrubs were
  flowering or fruit-bearing; under the bending branches the ground was pranked
  with brightest blooms; over them the jasmine stretched its delicate bonds.
  From lilac and rose, and lily and tulip, from oleander and strawberry-tree,
  all old friends in the gardens of the valleys about the city of David, the
  air, lingering or in haste, loaded itself with exhalations day and night; and
  that nothing might be wanting to the happiness of the nymphs and naiads, down
  through the flower-lighted shadows of the mass a brook went its course
  gently, and by many winding ways.</p>

  <p>Out of the thicket, as he proceeded, on his right and left, issued the cry
  of the pigeon and the cooing of turtle-doves; blackbirds waited for him, and
  bided his coming close; a nightingale kept its place fearless, though he
  passed in arm's-length; a quail ran before him at his feet, whistling to the
  brood she was leading, and as he paused for them to get out of his way, a
  figure crawled from a bed of honeyed musk brilliant with balls of golden
  blossoms. Ben-Hur was startled. Had he, indeed, been permitted to see a satyr
  at home? The creature looked up at him, and showed in its teeth a hooked
  pruning-knife; he smiled at his own scare, and, lo! the charm was evolved!
  Peace without fear&mdash;peace a universal condition&mdash;that it was!</p>

  <p>He sat upon the ground beneath a citron-tree, which spread its gray roots
  sprawling to receive a branch of the brook. The nest of a titmouse hung close
  to the bubbling water, and the tiny creature looked out of the door of the
  nest into his eyes. "Verily, the bird is interpreting to me," he thought. "It
  says, 'I am not afraid of you, for the law of this happy place is Love.'"</p>

  <p>The charm of the Grove seemed plain to him; he was glad, and determined to
  render himself one of the lost in Daphne. In charge of the flowers and
  shrubs, and watching the growth of all the dumb excellences everywhere to be
  seen, could not he, like the man with the pruning-knife in his mouth, forego
  the days of his troubled life&mdash;forego them forgetting and forgotten?</p>

  <p>But by-and-by his Jewish nature began to stir within him.</p>

  <p>The charm might be sufficient for some people. Of what kind were they?</p>

  <p>Love is delightful&mdash;ah! how pleasant as a successor to wretchedness
  like his. But was it all there was of life? All?</p>

  <p>There was an unlikeness between him and those who buried themselves
  contentedly here. They had no duties&mdash;they could not have had; but
  he&mdash;</p>

  <p>"God of Israel!" he cried aloud, springing to his feet, with burning
  cheeks&mdash;"Mother! Tirzah! Cursed be the moment, cursed the place, in
  which I yield myself happy in your loss!"</p>

  <p>He hurried away through the thicket, and came to a stream flowing with the
  volume of a river between banks of masonry, broken at intervals by gated
  sluiceways. A bridge carried the path he was traversing across the stream;
  and, standing upon it, he saw other bridges, no two of them alike. Under him
  the water was lying in a deep pool, clear as a shadow; down a little way it
  tumbled with a roar over rocks; then there was another pool, and another
  cascade; and so on, out of view; and bridges and pools and resounding
  cascades said, plainly as inarticulate things can tell a story, the river was
  running by permission of a master, exactly as the master would have it,
  tractable as became a servant of the gods.</p>

  <p>Forward from the bridge he beheld a landscape of wide valleys and
  irregular heights, with groves and lakes and fanciful houses linked together
  by white paths and shining streams. The valleys were spread below, that the
  river might be poured upon them for refreshment in days of drought, and they
  were as green carpets figured with beds and fields of flowers, and flecked
  with flocks of sheep white as balls of snow; and the voices of shepherds
  following the flocks were heard afar. As if to tell him of the pious
  inscription of all he beheld, the altars out under the open sky seemed
  countless, each with a white-gowned figure attending it, while processions in
  white went slowly hither and thither between them; and the smoke of the
  altars half-risen hung collected in pale clouds over the devoted places.</p>

  <p>Here, there, happy in flight, intoxicated in pause, from object to object,
  point to point, now in the meadow, now on the heights, now lingering to
  penetrate the groves and observe the processions, then lost in efforts to
  pursue the paths and streams which trended mazily into dim perspectives to
  end finally in&mdash; Ah, what might be a fitting end to scene so beautiful!
  What adequate mysteries were hidden behind an introduction so marvellous!
  Here and there, the speech was beginning, his gaze wandered, so he could not
  help the conviction, forced by the view, and as the sum of it all, that there
  was peace in the air and on the earth, and invitation everywhere to come and
  lie down here and be at rest.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a revelation dawned upon him&mdash;the Grove was, in fact, a
  temple&mdash;one far-reaching, wall-less temple!</p>

  <p>Never anything like it!</p>

  <p>The architect had not stopped to pother about columns and porticos,
  proportions or interiors, or any limitation upon the epic he sought to
  materialize; he had simply made a servant of Nature&mdash;art can go no
  further. So the cunning son of Jupiter and Callisto built the old Arcadia;
  and in this, as in that, the genius was Greek.</p>

  <p>From the bridge Ben-Hur went forward into the nearest valley.</p>

  <p>He came to a flock of sheep. The shepherd was a girl, and she beckoned
  him, "Come!"</p>

  <p>Farther on, the path was divided by an altar&mdash;a pedestal of black
  gneiss, capped with a slab of white marble deftly foliated, and on that a
  brazier of bronze holding a fire. Close by it, a woman, seeing him, waved a
  wand of willow, and as he passed called him, "Stay!" And the temptation in
  her smile was that of passionate youth.</p>

  <p>On yet further, he met one of the processions; at its head a troop of
  little girls, nude except as they were covered with garlands, piped their
  shrill voices into a song; then a troop of boys, also nude, their bodies
  deeply sun-browned, came dancing to the song of the girls; behind them the
  procession, all women, bearing baskets of spices and sweets to the
  altars&mdash;women clad in simple robes, careless of exposure. As he went by
  they held their hands to him, and said, "Stay, and go with us." One, a Greek,
  sang a verse from Anacreon:</p>

  <p class="verse">"For to-day I take or give;<br>
  For to-day I drink and live;<br>
  For to-day I beg or borrow;<br>
  Who knows about the silent morrow?"</p><br>

  <p>But he pursued his way indifferent, and came next to a grove luxuriant, in
  the heart of the vale at the point where it would be most attractive to the
  observing eye. As it came close to the path he was travelling, there was a
  seduction in its shade, and through the foliage he caught the shining of what
  appeared a pretentious statue; so he turned aside, and entered the cool
  retreat.</p>

  <p>The grass was fresh and clean. The trees did not crowd each other; and
  they were of every kind native to the East, blended well with strangers
  adopted from far quarters; here grouped in exclusive companionship palm-trees
  plumed like queens; there sycamores, overtopping laurels of darker foliage;
  and evergreen oaks rising verdantly, with cedars vast enough to be kings on
  Lebanon; and mulberries; and terebinths so beautiful it is not hyperbole to
  speak of them as blown from the orchards of Paradise.</p>

  <p>The statue proved to be a Daphne of wondrous beauty. Hardly, however, had
  he time to more than glance at her face: at the base of the pedestal a girl
  and a youth were lying upon a tiger's skin asleep in each other's arms; close
  by them the implements of their service&mdash;his axe and sickle, her
  basket&mdash;flung carelessly upon a heap of fading roses.</p>

  <p>The exposure startled him. Back in the hush of the perfumed thicket he
  discovered, as he thought, that the charm of the great Grove was peace
  without fear, and almost yielded to it; now, in this sleep in the day's broad
  glare&mdash;this sleep at the feet of Daphne&mdash;he read a further chapter
  to which only the vaguest allusion is sufferable. The law of the place was
  Love, but Love without Law.</p>

  <p>And this was the sweet peace of Daphne!</p>

  <p>This the life's end of her ministers!</p>

  <p>For this kings and princes gave of their revenues!</p>

  <p>For this a crafty priesthood subordinated nature&mdash;her birds and
  brooks and lilies, the river, the labor of many hands, the sanctity of
  altars, the fertile power of the sun!</p>

  <p>It would be pleasant now to record that as Ben-Hur pursued his walk
  assailed by such reflections, he yielded somewhat to sorrow for the votaries
  of the great outdoor temple; especially for those who, by personal service,
  kept it in a state so surpassingly lovely. How they came to the condition was
  not any longer a mystery; the motive, the influence, the inducement, were
  before him. Some there were, no doubt, caught by the promise held out to
  their troubled spirits of endless peace in a consecrated abode, to the beauty
  of which, if they had not money, they could contribute their labor; this
  class implied intellect peculiarly subject to hope and fear; but the great
  body of the faithful could not be classed with such. Apollo's nets were wide,
  and their meshes small; and hardly may one tell what all his fishermen
  landed: this less for that they cannot be described than because they ought
  not to be. Enough that the mass were of the sybarites of the world, and of
  the herds in number vaster and in degree lower&mdash;devotees of the unmixed
  sensualism to which the East was almost wholly given. Not to any of the
  exaltations&mdash;not to the singing-god, or his unhappy mistress; not to any
  philosophy requiring for its enjoyment the calm of retirement, nor to any
  service for the comfort there is in religion, nor to love in its holier
  sense&mdash;were they abiding their vows. Good reader, why shall not the
  truth be told here? Why not learn that, at this age, there were in all earth
  but two peoples capable of exaltations of the kind referred to&mdash;those
  who lived by the law of Moses, and those who lived by the law of Brahma. They
  alone could have cried you, Better a law without love than a love without
  law.</p>

  <p>Besides that, sympathy is in great degree a result of the mood we are in
  at the moment: anger forbids the emotion. On the other hand, it is easiest
  taken on when we are in a state of most absolute self-satisfaction. Ben-Hur
  walked with a quicker step, holding his head higher; and, while not less
  sensitive to the delightfulness of all about him, he made his survey with
  calmer spirit, though sometimes with curling lip; that is to say, he could
  not so soon forget how nearly he himself had been imposed upon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch407"
     name="ch407"></a>VII. &mdash; THE STADIUM IN THE GROVE</h2>

  <p class="first">In front of Ben-Hur there was a forest of cypress-trees,
  each a column tall and straight as a mast. Venturing into the shady precinct,
  he heard a trumpet gayly blown, and an instant after saw lying upon the grass
  close by the countryman whom he had run upon in the road going to the
  temples. The man arose, and came to him.</p>

  <p>"I give you peace again," he said, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Ben-Hur replied, then asked, "Go you my way?"</p>

  <p>"I am for the stadium, if that is your way."</p>

  <p>"The stadium!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The trumpet you heard but now was a call for the competitors."</p>

  <p>"Good friend," said Ben-Hur, frankly, "I admit my ignorance of the Grove;
  and if you will let me be your follower, I will be glad."</p>

  <p>"That will delight me. Hark! I hear the wheels of the chariots. They are
  taking the track."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur listened a moment, then completed the introduction by laying his
  hand upon the man's arm, and saying, "I am the son of Arrius, the duumvir,
  and thou?"</p>

  <p>"I am Malluch, a merchant of Antioch."</p>

  <p>"Well, good Malluch, the trumpet, and the gride of wheels, and the
  prospect of diversion excite me. I have some skill in the exercises. In the
  palaestrae of Rome I am not unknown. Let us to the course."</p>

  <p>Malluch lingered to say, quickly, "The duumvir was a Roman, yet I see his
  son in the garments of a Jew."</p>

  <p>"The noble Arrius was my father by adoption," Ben-Hur answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I see, and beg pardon."</p>

  <p>Passing through the belt of forest, they came to a field with a track laid
  out upon it, in shape and extent exactly like those of the stadia. The
  course, or track proper, was of soft earth, rolled and sprinkled, and on both
  sides defined by ropes, stretched loosely upon upright javelins. For the
  accommodation of spectators, and such as had interests reaching forward of
  the mere practise, there were several stands shaded by substantial awnings,
  and provided with seats in rising rows. In one of the stands the two
  new-comers found places.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur counted the chariots as they went by&mdash;nine in all.</p>

  <p>"I commend the fellows," he said, with good-will. "Here in the East, I
  thought they aspired to nothing better than the two; but they are ambitious,
  and play with royal fours. Let us study their performance."</p>

  <p>Eight of the fours passed the stand, some walking, others on the trot, and
  all unexceptionably handled; then the ninth one came on the gallop. Ben-Hur
  burst into exclamation.</p>

  <p>"I have been in the stables of the emperor, Malluch, but, by our father
  Abraham of blessed memory! I never saw the like of these."</p>

  <p>The last four was then sweeping past. All at once they fell into
  confusion. Some one on the stand uttered a sharp cry. Ben-Hur turned, and saw
  an old man half-risen from an upper seat, his hands clenched and raised, his
  eyes fiercely bright, his long white beard fairly quivering. Some of the
  spectators nearest him began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"They should respect his beard at least. Who is he?" asked Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"A mighty man from the Desert, somewhere beyond Moab, and owner of camels
  in herds, and horses descended, they say, from the racers of the first
  Pharaoh&mdash;Sheik Ilderim by name and title."</p>

  <p>Thus Malluch replied.</p>

  <p>The driver meanwhile exerted himself to quiet the four, but without avail.
  Each ineffectual effort excited the sheik the more.</p>

  <p>"Abaddon seize him!" yelled the patriarch, shrilly. "Run! fly! do you
  hear, my children?" The question was to his attendants, apparently of the
  tribe. "Do you hear? They are Desert-born, like yourselves. Catch
  them&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>The plunging of the animals increased.</p>

  <p>"Accursed Roman!" and the sheik shook his fist at the driver. "Did he not
  swear he could drive them&mdash;swear it by all his brood of bastard Latin
  gods? Nay, hands off me&mdash;off, I say! They should run swift as eagles,
  and with the temper of hand-bred lambs, he swore. Cursed be he&mdash;cursed
  the mother of liars who calls him son! See them, the priceless! Let him touch
  one of them with a lash, and"&mdash;the rest of the sentence was lost in a
  furious grinding of his teeth. "To their heads, some of you, and speak
  them&mdash;a word, one is enough, from the tent-song your mothers sang you.
  Oh, fool, fool that I was to put trust in a Roman!"</p>

  <p>Some of the shrewder of the old man's friends planted themselves between
  him and the horses. An opportune failure of breath on his part helped the
  stratagem.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur, thinking he comprehended the sheik, sympathized with him. Far
  more than mere pride of property&mdash;more than anxiety for the result of
  the race&mdash;in his view it was within the possible for the patriarch,
  according to his habits of thought and his ideas of the inestimable, to love
  such animals with a tenderness akin to the most sensitive passion.</p>

  <p>They were all bright bays, unspotted, perfectly matched, and so
  proportioned as to seem less than they really were. Delicate ears pointed
  small heads; the faces were broad and full between the eyes; the nostrils in
  expansion disclosed membrane so deeply red as to suggest the flashing of
  flame; the necks were arches, overlaid with fine mane so abundant as to drape
  the shoulders and breast, while in happy consonance the forelocks were like
  ravellings of silken veils; between the knees and the fetlocks the legs were
  flat as an open hand, but above the knees they were rounded with mighty
  muscles, needful to upbear the shapely close-knit bodies; the hoofs were like
  cups of polished agate; and in rearing and plunging they whipped the air, and
  sometimes the earth, with tails glossy-black and thick and long. The sheik
  spoke of them as the priceless, and it was a good saying.</p>

  <p>In this second and closer look at the horses, Ben-Hur read the story of
  their relation to their master. They had grown up under his eyes, objects of
  his special care in the day, his visions of pride in the night, with his
  family at home in the black tent out on the shadeless bosom of the desert, as
  his children beloved. That they might win him a triumph over the haughty and
  hated Roman, the old man had brought his loves to the city, never doubting
  they would win, if only he could find a trusty expert to take them in hand;
  not merely one with skill, but of a spirit which their spirits would
  acknowledge. Unlike the colder people of the West, he could not protest the
  driver's inability, and dismiss him civilly; an Arab and a sheik, he had to
  explode, and rive the air about him with clamor.</p>

  <p>Before the patriarch was done with his expletives, a dozen hands were at
  the bits of the horses, and their quiet assured. About that time, another
  chariot appeared upon the track; and, unlike the others, driver, vehicle, and
  races were precisely as they would be presented in the Circus the day of
  final trial. For a reason which will presently be more apparent, it is
  desirable now to give this turnout plainly to the reader.</p>

  <p>There should be no difficulty in understanding the carriage known to us
  all as the chariot of classical renown. One has but to picture to himself a
  dray with low wheels and broad axle, surmounted by a box open at the tail
  end. Such was the primitive pattern. Artistic genius came along in time, and,
  touching the rude machine, raised it into a thing of beauty&mdash;that, for
  instance, in which Aurora, riding in advance of the dawn, is given to our
  fancy.</p>

  <p>The jockeys of the ancients, quite as shrewd and ambitious as their
  successors of the present, called their humblest turnout a two, and their
  best in grade a four; in the latter, they contested the Olympics and the
  other festal shows founded in imitation of them.</p>

  <p>The same sharp gamesters preferred to put their horses to the chariot all
  abreast; and for distinction they termed the two next the pole yoke-steeds,
  and those on the right and left outside trace-mates. It was their judgment,
  also, that, by allowing the fullest freedom of action, the greatest speed was
  attainable; accordingly, the harness resorted to was peculiarly simple; in
  fact, there was nothing of it save a collar round the animal's neck, and a
  trace fixed to the collar, unless the lines and a halter fall within the
  term. Wanting to hitch up, the masters pinned a narrow wooden yoke, or
  cross-tree, near the end of the pole, and, by straps passed through rings at
  the end of the yoke, buckled the latter to the collar. The traces of the
  yokesteeds they hitched to the axle; those of the trace-mates to the top rim
  of the chariot-bed. There remained then but the adjustment of the lines,
  which, judged by the modern devices, was not the least curious part of the
  method. For this there was a large ring at the forward extremity of the pole;
  securing the ends to that ring first, they parted the lines so as to give one
  to each horse, and proceeded to pass them to the driver, slipping them
  separately through rings on the inner side of the halters at the mouth.</p>

  <p>With this plain generalization in mind, all further desirable knowledge
  upon the subject can be had by following the incidents of the scene
  occurring.</p>

  <p>The other contestants had been received in silence; the last comer was
  more fortunate. While moving towards the stand from which we are viewing the
  scene, his progress was signalized by loud demonstrations, by clapping of
  hands and cheers, the effect of which was to centre attention upon him
  exclusively. His yoke-steeds, it was observed, were black, while the
  trace-mates were snow-white. In conformity to the exacting canons of Roman
  taste, they had all four been mutilated; that is to say, their tails had been
  clipped, and, to complete the barbarity, their shorn manes were divided into
  knots tied with flaring red and yellow ribbons.</p>

  <p>In advancing, the stranger at length reached a point where the chariot
  came into view from the stand, and its appearance would of itself have
  justified the shouting. The wheels were very marvels of construction. Stout
  bands of burnished bronze reinforced the hubs, otherwise very light; the
  spokes were sections of ivory tusks, set in with the natural curve outward to
  perfect the dishing, considered important then as now; bronze tires held the
  fellies, which were of shining ebony. The axle, in keeping with the wheels,
  was tipped with heads of snarling tigers done in brass, and the bed was woven
  of willow wands gilded with gold.</p>

  <p>The coming of the beautiful horses and resplendent chariot drew Ben-Hur to
  look at the driver with increased interest.</p>

  <p>Who was he?</p>

  <p>When Ben-Hur asked himself the question first, he could not see the man's
  face, or even his full figure; yet the air and manner were familiar, and
  pricked him keenly with a reminder of a period long gone.</p>

  <p>Who could it be?</p>

  <p>Nearer now, and the horses approaching at a trot. From the shouting and
  the gorgeousness of the turnout, it was thought he might be some official
  favorite or famous prince. Such an appearance was not inconsistent with
  exalted rank. Kings often struggled for the crown of leaves which was the
  prize of victory. Nero and Commodus, it will be remembered, devoted
  themselves to the chariot. Ben-Hur arose and forced a passage down nearly to
  the railing in front of the lower seat of the stand. His face was earnest,
  his manner eager.</p>

  <p>And directly the whole person of the driver was in view. A companion rode
  with him, in classic description a Myrtilus, permitted men of high estate
  indulging their passion for the race-course. Ben-Hur could see only the
  driver, standing erect in the chariot, with the reins passed several times
  round his body&mdash;a handsome figure, scantily covered by a tunic of
  light-red cloth; in the right hand a whip; in the other, the arm raised and
  lightly extended, the four lines. The pose was exceedingly graceful and
  animated. The cheers and clapping of hands were received with statuesque
  indifference. Ben-Hur stood transfixed&mdash;his instinct and memory had
  served him faithfully&mdash;THE DRIVER WAS MESSALA.</p>

  <p>By the selection of horses, the magnificence of the chariot, the attitude,
  and display of person&mdash;above all, by the expression of the cold, sharp,
  eagle features, imperialized in his countrymen by sway of the world through
  so many generations, Ben-Hur knew Messala unchanged, as haughty, confident,
  and audacious as ever, the same in ambition, cynicism, and mocking
  insouciance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch408"
     name="ch408"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE FOUNTAIN OF CASTALIA</h2>

  <p class="first">As Ben-Hur descended the steps of the stand, an Arab arose
  upon the last one at the foot, and cried out,</p>

  <p>"Men of the East and West&mdash;hearken! The good Sheik Ilderim giveth
  greeting. With four horses, sons of the favorites of Solomon the Wise, he
  bath come up against the best. Needs he most a mighty man to drive them.
  Whoso will take them to his satisfaction, to him he promiseth enrichment
  forever. Here&mdash;there&mdash;in the city and in the Circuses, and wherever
  the strong most do congregate, tell ye this his offer. So saith my master,
  Sheik Ilderim the Generous."</p>

  <p>The proclamation awakened a great buzz among the people under the awning.
  By night it would be repeated and discussed in all the sporting circles of
  Antioch. Ben-Hur, hearing it, stopped and looked hesitatingly from the herald
  to the sheik. Malluch thought he was about to accept the offer, but was
  relieved when he presently turned to him, and asked, "Good Malluch, where to
  now?"</p>

  <p>The worthy replied, with a laugh, "Would you liken yourself to others
  visiting the Grove for the first time, you will straightway to hear your
  fortune told."</p>

  <p>"My fortune, said you? Though the suggestion has in it a flavor of
  unbelief, let us to the goddess at once."</p>

  <p>"Nay, son of Arrius, these Apollonians have a better trick than that.
  Instead of speech with a Pythia or a Sibyl, they will sell you a plain
  papyrus leaf, hardly dry from the stalk, and bid you dip it in the water of a
  certain fountain, when it will show you a verse in which you may hear of your
  future."</p>

  <p>The glow of interest departed from Ben-Hur's face.</p>

  <p>"There are people who have no need to vex themselves about their future,"
  he said, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Then you prefer to go to the temples?"</p>

  <p>"The temples are Greek, are they not?"</p>

  <p>"They call them Greek."</p>

  <p>"The Hellenes were masters of the beautiful in art; but in architecture
  they sacrificed variety to unbending beauty. Their temples are all alike. How
  call you the fountain?"</p>

  <p>"Castalia."</p>

  <p>"Oh! it has repute throughout the world. Let us thither."</p>

  <p>Malluch kept watch on his companion as they went, and saw that for the
  moment at least his good spirits were out. To the people passing he gave no
  attention; over the wonders they came upon there were no exclamations;
  silently, even sullenly, he kept a slow pace.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the sight of Messala had set Ben-Hur to thinking. It seemed
  scarce an hour ago that the strong hands had torn him from his mother, scarce
  an hour ago that the Roman had put seal upon the gates of his father's house.
  He recounted how, in the hopeless misery of the life&mdash;if such it might
  be called&mdash;in the galleys, he had had little else to do, aside from
  labor, than dream dreams of vengeance, in all of which Messala was the
  principal. There might be, he used to say to himself, escape for Gratus, but
  for Messala&mdash;never! And to strengthen and harden his resolution, he was
  accustomed to repeat over and over, Who pointed us out to the persecutors?
  And when I begged him for help&mdash;not for myself&mdash;who mocked me, and
  went away laughing? And always the dream had the same ending. The day I meet
  him, help me, thou good God of my people!&mdash;help me to some fitting
  special vengeance!</p>

  <p>And now the meeting was at hand.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, if he had found Messala poor and suffering, Ben-Hur's feeling had
  been different; but it was not so. He found him more than prosperous; in the
  prosperity there was a dash and glitter&mdash;gleam of sun on gilt of
  gold.</p>

  <p>So it happened that what Malluch accounted a passing loss of spirit was
  pondering when the meeting should be, and in what manner he could make it
  most memorable.</p>

  <p>They turned after a while into an avenue of oaks, where the people were
  going and coming in groups; footmen here, and horsemen; there women in
  litters borne slaves; and now and then chariots rolled by thunderously.</p>

  <p>At the end of the avenue the road, by an easy grade, descended into a
  lowland, where, on the right hand, there was a precipitous facing of gray
  rock, and on the left an open meadow of vernal freshness. Then they came in
  view of the famous Fountain of Castalia.</p>

  <p>Edging through a company assembled at the point, Ben-Hur beheld a jet of
  sweet water pouring from the crest of a stone into a basin of black marble,
  where, after much boiling and foaming, it disappeared as through a
  funnel.</p>

  <p>By the basin, under a small portico cut in the solid wall, sat a priest,
  old, bearded, wrinkled, cowled&mdash;never being more perfectly eremitish.
  From the manner of the people present, hardly might one say which was the
  attraction, the fountain, forever sparkling, or the priest, forever there. He
  heard, saw, was seen, but never spoke. Occasionally a visitor extended a hand
  to him with a coin in it. With a cunning twinkle of the eyes, he took the
  money, and gave the party in exchange a leaf of papyrus.</p>

  <p>The receiver made haste to plunge the papyrus into the basin; then,
  holding the dripping leaf in the sunlight, he would be rewarded with a
  versified inscription upon its face; and the fame of the fountain seldom
  suffered loss by poverty of merit in the poetry. Before Ben-Hur could test
  the oracle, some other visitors were seen approaching across the meadow, and
  their appearance piqued the curiosity of the company, his not less than
  theirs.</p>

  <p>He saw first a camel, very tall and very white, in leading of a driver on
  horseback. A houdah on the animal, besides being unusually large, was of
  crimson and gold. Two other horsemen followed the camel with tall spears in
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What a wonderful camel!" said one of the company.</p>

  <p>"A prince from afar," another one suggested.</p>

  <p>"More likely a king."</p>

  <p>"If he were on an elephant, I would say he was a king."</p>

  <p>A third man had a very different opinion.</p>

  <p>"A camel&mdash;and a white camel!" he said, authoritatively. "By Apollo,
  friends, they who come yonder&mdash;you can see there are two of
  them&mdash;are neither kings nor princes; they are women!"</p>

  <p>In the midst of the dispute the strangers arrived.</p>

  <p>The camel seen at hand did not belie his appearance afar. A taller,
  statelier brute of his kind no traveller at the fountain, though from the
  remotest parts, had ever beheld. Such great black eyes! such exceedingly fine
  white hair! feet so contractile when raised, so soundless in planting, so
  broad when set!&mdash;nobody had ever seen the peer of this camel. And how
  well he became his housing of silk, and all its frippery of gold in fringe
  and gold in tassel! The tinkling of silver bells went before him, and he
  moved lightly, as if unknowing of his burden.</p>

  <p>But who were the man and woman under the houdah?</p>

  <p>Every eye saluted them with the inquiry.</p>

  <p>If the former were a prince or a king, the philosophers of the crowd might
  not deny the impartiality of Time. When they saw the thin, shrunken face
  buried under an immense turban, the skin of the hue of a mummy, making it
  impossible to form an idea of his nationality, they were pleased to think the
  limit of life was for the great as well as the small. They saw about his
  person nothing so enviable as the shawl which draped him.</p>

  <p>The woman was seated in the manner of the East, amidst veils and laces of
  surpassing fineness. Above her elbows she wore armlets fashioned like coiled
  asps, and linked to bracelets at the wrists by strands of gold; otherwise the
  arms were bare and of singular natural grace, complemented with hands
  modelled daintily as a child's. One of the hands rested upon the side of the
  carriage, showing tapered fingers glittering with rings, and stained at the
  tips till they blushed like the pink of mother-of-pearl. She wore an open
  caul upon her head, sprinkled with beads of coral, and strung with
  coin-pieces called sunlets, some of which were carried across her forehead,
  while others fell down her back, half-smothered in the mass of her straight
  blue-black hair, of itself an incomparable ornament, not needing the veil
  which covered it, except as a protection against sun and dust. From her
  elevated seat she looked upon the people calmly, pleasantly, and apparently
  so intent upon studying them as to be unconscious of the interest she herself
  was exciting; and, what was unusual&mdash;nay, in violent contravention of
  the custom among women of rank in public&mdash;she looked at them with an
  open face.</p>

  <p>It was a fair face to see; quite youthful; in form, oval: complexion not
  white, like the Greek; nor brunet, like the Roman; nor blond, like the Gaul;
  but rather the tinting of the sun of the Upper Nile upon a skin of such
  transparency that the blood shone through it on cheek and brow with nigh the
  ruddiness of lamplight. The eyes, naturally large, were touched along the
  lids with the black paint immemorial throughout the East. The lips were
  slightly parted, disclosing, through their scarlet lake, teeth of glistening
  whiteness. To all these excellences of countenance the reader is finally
  besought to superadd the air derived from the pose of a small head, classic
  in shape, set upon a neck long, drooping, and graceful&mdash;the air, we may
  fancy, happily described by the word queenly.</p>

  <p>As if satisfied with the survey of people and locality, the fair creature
  spoke to the driver&mdash;an Ethiopian of vast brawn, naked to the
  waist&mdash;who led the camel nearer the fountain, and caused it to kneel;
  after which he received from her hand a cup, and proceeded to fill it at the
  basin. That instant the sound of wheels and the trampling of horses in rapid
  motion broke the silence her beauty had imposed, and, with a great outcry,
  the bystanders parted in every direction, hurrying to get away.</p>

  <p>"The Roman has a mind to ride us down. Look out!" Malluch shouted to
  Ben-Hur, setting him at the same time an example of hasty flight.</p>

  <p>The latter faced to the direction the sounds came from, and beheld Messala
  in his chariot pushing the four straight at the crowd. This time the view was
  near and distinct.</p>

  <p>The parting of the company uncovered the camel, which might have been more
  agile than his kind generally; yet the hoofs were almost upon him, and he
  resting with closed eyes, chewing the endless cud with such sense of security
  as long favoritism may be supposed to have bred in him. The Ethiopian wrung
  his hands afraid. In the houdah, the old man moved to escape; but he was
  hampered with age, and could not, even in the face of danger, forget the
  dignity which was plainly his habit. It was too late for the woman to save
  herself. Ben-Hur stood nearest them, and he called to Messala,</p>

  <p>"Hold! Look where thou goest! Back, back!"</p>

  <p>The patrician was laughing in hearty good-humor; and, seeing there was but
  one chance of rescue, Ben-Hur stepped in, and caught the bits of the left
  yoke-steed and his mate. "Dog of a Roman! Carest thou so little for life?" he
  cried, putting forth all his strength. The two horses reared, and drew the
  others round; the tilting of the pole tilted the chariot; Messala barely
  escaped a fall, while his complacent Myrtilus rolled back like a clod to the
  ground. Seeing the peril past, all the bystanders burst into derisive
  laughter.</p>

  <p>The matchless audacity of the Roman then manifested itself. Loosing the
  lines from his body, he tossed them to one side, dismounted, walked round the
  camel, looked at Ben-Hur, and spoke partly to the old man and partly to the
  woman.</p>

  <p>"Pardon, I pray you&mdash;I pray you both. I am Messala," he said; "and,
  by the old Mother of the earth, I swear I did not see you or your camel! As
  to these good people&mdash;perhaps I trusted too much to my skill. I sought a
  laugh at them&mdash;the laugh is theirs. Good may it do them!"</p>

  <p>The good-natured, careless look and gesture he threw the bystanders
  accorded well with the speech. To hear what more he had to say, they became
  quiet. Assured of victory over the body of the offended, he signed his
  companion to take the chariot to a safer distance, and addressed himself
  boldly to the woman.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast interest in the good man here, whose pardon, if not granted
  now, I shall seek with the greater diligence hereafter; his daughter, I
  should say."</p>

  <p>She made him no reply.</p>

  <p>"By Pallas, thou art beautiful! Beware Apollo mistake thee not for his
  lost love. I wonder what land can boast herself thy mother. Turn not away. A
  truce! a truce! There is the sun of India in thine eyes; in the corners of
  thy mouth, Egypt hath set her love-signs. Perpol! Turn not to that slave,
  fair mistress, before proving merciful to this one. Tell me at least that I
  am pardoned."</p>

  <p>At this point she broke in upon him.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou come here?" she asked, smiling, and with gracious bend of the
  head to Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Take the cup and fill it, I pray thee," she said to the latter. "My
  father is thirsty."</p>

  <p>"I am thy most willing servant!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur turned about to do the favor, and was face to face with Messala.
  Their glances met; the Jew's defiant; the Roman's sparkling with humor.</p>

  <p>"O stranger, beautiful as cruel!" Messala said, waving his hand to her.
  "If Apollo get thee not, thou shalt see me again. Not knowing thy country, I
  cannot name a god to commend thee to; so, by all the gods, I will commend
  thee to&mdash;myself!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Myrtilus had the four composed and ready, he returned to the
  chariot. The woman looked after him as he moved away, and whatever else there
  was in her look, there was no displeasure. Presently she received the water;
  her father drank; then she raised the cup to her lips, and, leaning down,
  gave it to Ben-Hur; never action more graceful and gracious.</p>

  <p>"Keep it, we pray of thee! It is full of blessings&mdash;all thine!"</p>

  <p>Immediately the camel was aroused, and on his feet, and about to go, when
  the old man called,</p>

  <p>"Stand thou here."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur went to him respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast served the stranger well to-day. There is but one God. In his
  holy name I thank thee. I am Balthasar, the Egyptian. In the Great Orchard of
  Palms, beyond the village of Daphne, in the shade of the palms, Sheik Ilderim
  the Generous abideth in his tents, and we are his guests. Seek us there. Thou
  shalt have welcome sweet with the savor of the grateful."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was left in wonder at the old man's clear voice and reverend
  manner. As he gazed after the two departing, he caught sight of Messala going
  as he had come, joyous, indifferent, and with a mocking laugh.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch409"
     name="ch409"></a>IX. &mdash; THE CHARIOT RACE DISCUSSED</h2>

  <p class="first">As a rule, there is no surer way to the dislike of men than
  to behave well where they have behaved badly. In this instance, happily,
  Malluch was an exception to the rule. The affair he had just witnessed raised
  Ben-Hur in his estimation, since he could not deny him courage and address;
  could he now get some insight into the young man's history, the results of
  the day would not be all unprofitable to good master Simonides.</p>

  <p>On the latter point, referring to what he had as yet learned, two facts
  comprehended it all&mdash;the subject of his investigation was a Jew, and the
  adopted son of a famous Roman. Another conclusion which might be of
  importance was beginning to formulate itself in the shrewd mind of the
  emissary; between Messala and the son of the duumvir there was a connection
  of some kind. But what was it?&mdash;and how could it be reduced to
  assurance? With all his sounding, the ways and means of solution were not at
  call. In the heat of the perplexity, Ben-Hur himself came to his help. He
  laid his hand on Malluch's arm and drew him out of the crowd, which was
  already going back to its interest in the gray old priest and the mystic
  fountain.</p>

  <p>"Good Malluch," he said, stopping, "may a man forget his mother?"</p>

  <p>The question was abrupt and without direction, and therefore of the kind
  which leaves the person addressed in a state of confusion. Malluch looked
  into Ben-Hur's face for a hint of meaning, but saw, instead, two bright-red
  spots, one on each cheek, and in his eyes traces of what might have been
  repressed tears; then he answered, mechanically, "No!" adding, with fervor,
  "never;" and a moment after, when he began to recover himself, "If he is an
  Israelite, never!" And when at length he was completely recovered&mdash;"My
  first lesson in the synagogue was the Shema; my next was the saying of the
  son of Sirach, 'Honor thy father with thy whole soul, and forget not the
  sorrows of thy mother.'"</p>

  <p>The red spots on Ben-Hur's face deepened.</p>

  <p>"The words bring my childhood back again; and, Malluch, they prove you a
  genuine Jew. I believe I can trust you."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur let go the arm he was holding, and caught the folds of the gown
  covering his own breast, and pressed them close, as if to smother a pain, or
  a feeling there as sharp as a pain.</p>

  <p>"My father," he said, "bore a good name, and was not without honor in
  Jerusalem, where he dwelt. My mother, at his death, was in the prime of
  womanhood; and it is not enough to say of her she was good and beautiful: in
  her tongue was the law of kindness, and her works were the praise of all in
  the gates, and she smiled at days to come. I had a little sister, and she and
  I were the family, and we were so happy that I, at least, have never seen
  harm in the saying of the old rabbi, 'God could not be everywhere, and,
  therefore, he made mothers.' One day an accident happened to a Roman in
  authority as he was riding past our house at the head of a cohort; the
  legionaries burst the gate and rushed in and seized us. I have not seen my
  mother or sister since. I cannot say they are dead or living. I do not know
  what became of them. But, Malluch, the man in the chariot yonder was present
  at the separation; he gave us over to the captors; he heard my mother's
  prayer for her children, and he laughed when they dragged her away. Hardly
  may one say which graves deepest in memory, love or hate. To-day I knew him
  afar&mdash;and, Malluch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He caught the listener's arm again.</p>

  <p>"And, Malluch, he knows and takes with him now the secret I would give my
  life for: he could tell if she lives, and where she is, and her condition; if
  she&mdash;no, THEY&mdash;much sorrow has made the two as one&mdash;if they
  are dead, he could tell where they died, and of what, and where their bones
  await my finding."</p>

  <p>"And will he not?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Jew, and he is a Roman."</p>

  <p>"But Romans have tongues, and Jews, though ever so despised, have methods
  to beguile them."</p>

  <p>"For such as he? No; and, besides, the secret is one of state. All my
  father's property was confiscated and divided."</p>

  <p>Malluch nodded his head slowly, much as to admit the argument; then he
  asked anew, "Did he not recognize you?"</p>

  <p>"He could not. I was sent to death in life, and have been long since
  accounted of the dead."</p>

  <p>"I wonder you did not strike him," said Malluch, yielding to a touch of
  passion.</p>

  <p>"That would have been to put him past serving me forever. I would have had
  to kill him, and Death, you know, keeps secrets better even than a guilty
  Roman."</p>

  <p>The man who, with so much to avenge, could so calmly put such an
  opportunity aside must be confident of his future or have ready some better
  design, and Malluch's interest changed with the thought; it ceased to be that
  of an emissary in duty bound to another. Ben-Hur was actually asserting a
  claim upon him for his own sake. In other words, Malluch was preparing to
  serve him with good heart and from downright admiration.</p>

  <p>After brief pause, Ben-Hur resumed speaking.</p>

  <p>"I would not take his life, good Malluch; against that extreme the
  possession of the secret is for the present, at least, his safeguard; yet I
  may punish him, and so you give me help, I will try."</p>

  <p>"He is a Roman," said Malluch, without hesitation; "and I am of the tribe
  of Judah. I will help you. If you choose, put me under oath&mdash;under the
  most solemn oath."</p>

  <p>"Give me your hand, that will suffice."</p>

  <p>As their hands fell apart, Ben-Hur said, with lightened feeling, "That I
  would charge you with is not difficult, good friend; neither is it dreadful
  to conscience. Let us move on."</p>

  <p>They took the road which led to the right across the meadow spoken of in
  the description of the coming to the fountain. Ben-Hur was first to break the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Sheik Ilderim the Generous?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Where is his Orchard of Palms? or, rather, Malluch, how far is it beyond
  the village of Daphne?"</p>

  <p>Malluch was touched by a doubt; he recalled the prettiness of the favor
  shown him by the woman at the fountain, and wondered if he who had the
  sorrows of a mother in mind was about to forget them for a lure of love; yet
  he replied, "The Orchard of Palms lies beyond the village two hours by horse,
  and one by swift camel."</p>

  <p>"Thank you; and to your knowledge once more. Have the games of which you
  told me been widely published? and when will they take place?"</p>

  <p>The questions were suggestive; and if they did not restore Malluch his
  confidence, they at least stimulated his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, they will be of ample splendor. The prefect is rich, and could
  afford to lose his place; yet, as is the way with successful men, his love of
  riches is nowise diminished; and to gain a friend at court, if nothing more,
  he must make ado for the Consul Maxentius, who is coming hither to make final
  preparations for a campaign against the Parthians. The money there is in the
  preparations the citizens of Antioch know from experience; so they have had
  permission to join the prefect in the honors intended for the great man. A
  month ago heralds went to the four quarters to proclaim the opening of the
  Circus for the celebration. The name of the prefect would be of itself good
  guarantee of variety and magnificence, particularly throughout the East; but
  when to his promises Antioch joins hers, all the islands and the cities by
  the sea stand assured of the extraordinary, and will be here in person or by
  their most famous professionals. The fees offered are royal."</p>

  <p>"And the Circus&mdash;I have heard it is second only to the Maximus."</p>

  <p>"At Rome, you mean. Well, ours seats two hundred thousand people, yours
  seats seventy-five thousand more; yours is of marble, so is ours; in
  arrangement they are exactly the same."</p>

  <p>"Are the rules the same?"</p>

  <p>Malluch smiled.</p>

  <p>"If Antioch dared be original, son of Arrius, Rome would not be the
  mistress she is. The laws of the Circus Maximus govern except in one
  particular: there but four chariots may start at once, here all start without
  reference to number."</p>

  <p>"That is the practise of the Greeks," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Antioch is more Greek than Roman."</p>

  <p>"So then, Malluch, I may choose my own chariot?"</p>

  <p>"Your own chariot and horses. There is no restriction upon either."</p>

  <p>While replying, Malluch observed the thoughtful look on Ben-Hur's face
  give place to one of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"One thing more now, O Malluch. When will the celebration be?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! your pardon," the other answered. "To-morrow&mdash;and the next day,"
  he said, counting aloud, "then, to speak in the Roman style, if the sea-gods
  be propitious, the consul arrives. Yes, the sixth day from this we have the
  games."</p>

  <p>"The time is short, Malluch, but it is enough." The last words were spoken
  decisively. "By the prophets of our old Israel! I will take to the reins
  again. Stay! a condition; is there assurance that Messala will be a
  competitor?"</p>

  <p>Malluch saw now the plan, and all its opportunities for the humiliation of
  the Roman; and he had not been true descendant of Jacob if, with all his
  interest wakened, he had not rushed to a consideration of the chances. His
  voice actually trembled as he said, "Have you the practise?"</p>

  <p>"Fear not, my friend. The winners in the Circus Maximus have held their
  crowns these three years at my will. Ask them&mdash;ask the best of
  them&mdash;and they will tell you so. In the last great games the emperor
  himself offered me his patronage if I would take his horses in hand and run
  them against the entries of the world."</p>

  <p>"But you did not?"</p>

  <p>Malluch spoke eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I am a Jew"&mdash;Ben-Hur seemed shrinking within himself as he
  spoke&mdash;"and, though I wear a Roman name, I dared not do professionally a
  thing to sully my father's name in the cloisters and courts of the Temple. In
  the palaestrae I could indulge practise which, if followed into the Circus,
  would become an abomination; and if I take to the course here, Malluch, I
  swear it will not be for the prize or the winner's fee."</p>

  <p>"Hold&mdash;swear not so!" cried Malluch. "The fee is ten thousand
  sestertii&mdash;a fortune for life!"</p>

  <p>"Not for me, though the prefect trebled it fifty times. Better than that,
  better than all the imperial revenues from the first year of the first
  Caesar&mdash;I will make this race to humble my enemy. Vengeance is permitted
  by the law."</p>

  <p>Malluch smiled and nodded as if saying, "Right, right&mdash;trust me a Jew
  to understand a Jew."</p>

  <p>"The Messala will drive," he said, directly. "He is committed to the race
  in many ways&mdash;by publication in the streets, and in the baths and
  theaters, the palace and barracks; and, to fix him past retreat, his name is
  on the tablets of every young spendthrift in Antioch."</p>

  <p>"In wager, Malluch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in wager; and every day he comes ostentatiously to practise, as you
  saw him."</p>

  <p>"Ah! and that is the chariot, and those the horses, with which he will
  make the race? Thank you, thank you, Malluch! You have served me well
  already. I am satisfied. Now be my guide to the Orchard of Palms, and give me
  introduction to Sheik Ilderim the Generous."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"To-day. His horses may be engaged to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You like them, then?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur answered with animation,</p>

  <p>"I saw them from the stand an instant only, for Messala then drove up, and
  I might not look at anything else; yet I recognized them as of the blood
  which is the wonder as well as the glory of the deserts. I never saw the kind
  before, except in the stables of Caesar; but once seen, they are always to be
  known. To-morrow, upon meeting, I will know you, Malluch, though you do not
  so much as salute me; I will know you by your face, by your form, by your
  manner; and by the same signs I will know them, and with the same certainty.
  If all that is said of them be true, and I can bring their spirit under
  control of mine, I can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Win the sestertii!" said Malluch, laughing.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Ben-Hur, as quickly. "I will do what better becomes a man
  born to the heritage of Jacob&mdash;I will humble mine enemy in a most public
  place. But," he added, impatiently, "we are losing time. How can we most
  quickly reach the tents of the sheik?"</p>

  <p>Malluch took a moment for reflection.</p>

  <p>"It is best we go straight to the village, which is fortunately near by;
  if two swift camels are to be had for hire there, we will be on the road but
  an hour."</p>

  <p>"Let us about it, then."</p>

  <p>The village was an assemblage of palaces in beautiful gardens,
  interspersed with khans of princely sort. Dromedaries were happily secured,
  and upon them the journey to the famous Orchard of Palms was begun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch410"
     name="ch410"></a>X. &mdash; BEN-HUR HEARS OF CHRIST</h2>

  <p class="first">Beyond the village the country was undulating and
  cultivated; in fact, it was the garden-land of Antioch, with not a foot lost
  to labor. The steep faces of the hills were terraced; even the hedges were
  brighter of the trailing vines which, besides the lure of shade, offered
  passers-by sweet promises of wine to come, and grapes in clustered purple
  ripeness. Over melon-patches, and through apricot and fig-tree groves, and
  groves of oranges and limes, the white-washed houses of the farmers were
  seen; and everywhere Plenty, the smiling daughter of Peace, gave notice by
  her thousand signs that she was at home, making the generous traveller merry
  at heart, until he was even disposed to give Rome her dues. Occasionally,
  also, views were had of Taurus and Lebanon, between which, a separating line
  of silver, the Orontes placidly pursued its way.</p>

  <p>In course of their journey the friends came to the river, which they
  followed with the windings of the road, now over bold bluffs, and then into
  vales, all alike allotted for country-seats, and if the land was in full
  foliage of oak and sycamore and myrtle, and bay and arbutus, and perfuming
  jasmine, the river was bright with slanted sunlight, which would have slept
  where it fell but for ships in endless procession, gliding with the current,
  tacking for the wind, or bounding under the impulse of oars&mdash;some
  coming, some going, and all suggestive of the sea, and distant peoples, and
  famous places, and things coveted on account of their rarity. To the fancy
  there is nothing so winsome as a white sail seaward blown, unless it be a
  white sail homeward bound, its voyage happily done. And down the shore the
  friends went continuously till they came to a lake fed by back-water from the
  river, clear, deep, and without current. An old palm-tree dominated the angle
  of the inlet; turning to the left at the foot of the tree, Malluch clapped
  his hands and shouted,</p>

  <p>"Look, look! The Orchard of Palms!"</p>

  <p>The scene was nowhere else to be found unless in the favored oases of
  Arabia or the Ptolemaean farms along the Nile; and to sustain a sensation new
  as it was delightful, Ben-Hur was admitted into a tract of land apparently
  without limit and level as a floor. All under foot was fresh grass, in Syria
  the rarest and most beautiful production of the soil; if he looked up, it was
  to see the sky paley blue through the groinery of countless date-bearers,
  very patriarchs of their kind, so numerous and old, and of such mighty girth,
  so tall, so serried, so wide of branch, each branch so perfect with fronds,
  plumy and waxlike and brilliant, they seemed enchanters enchanted. Here was
  the grass coloring the very atmosphere; there the lake, cool and clear,
  rippling but a few feet under the surface, and helping the trees to their
  long life in old age. Did the Grove of Daphne excel this one? And the palms,
  as if they knew Ben-Hur's thought, and would win him after a way of their
  own, seemed, as he passed under their arches, to stir and sprinkle him with
  dewy coolness.</p>

  <p>The road wound in close parallelism with the shore of the lake; and when
  it carried the travellers down to the water's edge, there was always on that
  side a shining expanse limited not far off by the opposite shore, on which,
  as on this one, no tree but the palm was permitted.</p>

  <p>"See that," said Malluch, pointing to a giant of the place. "Each ring
  upon its trunk marks a year of its life. Count them from root to branch, and
  if the sheik tells you the grove was planted before the Seleucidae were heard
  of in Antioch, do not doubt him."</p>

  <p>One may not look at a perfect palm-tree but that, with a subtlety all its
  own, it assumes a presence for itself, and makes a poet of the beholder. This
  is the explanation of the honors it has received, beginning with the artists
  of the first kings, who could find no form in all the earth to serve them so
  well as a model for the pillars of their palaces and temples; and for the
  same reason Ben-Hur was moved to say,</p>

  <p>"As I saw him at the stand to-day, good Malluch, Sheik Ilderim appeared to
  be a very common man. The rabbis in Jerusalem would look down upon him, I
  fear, as a son of a dog of Edom. How came he in possession of the Orchard?
  And how has he been able to hold it against the greed of Roman
  governors?"</p>

  <p>"If blood derives excellence from time, son of Arrius, then is old Ilderim
  a man, though he be an uncircumcised Edomite."</p>

  <p>Malluch spoke warmly.</p>

  <p>"All his fathers before him were sheiks. One of them&mdash;I shall not say
  when he lived or did the good deed&mdash;once helped a king who was being
  hunted with swords. The story says he loaned him a thousand horsemen, who
  knew the paths of the wilderness and its hiding-places as shepherds know the
  scant hills they inhabit with their flocks; and they carried him here and
  there until the opportunity came, and then with their spears they slew the
  enemy, and set him upon his throne again. And the king, it is said,
  remembered the service, and brought the son of the Desert to this place, and
  bade him set up his tent and bring his family and his herds, for the lake and
  trees, and all the land from the river to the nearest mountains, were his and
  his children's forever. And they have never been disturbed in the possession.
  The rulers succeeding have found it policy to keep good terms with the tribe,
  to whom the Lord has given increase of men and horses, and camels and riches,
  making them masters of many highways between cities; so that it is with them
  any time they please to say to commerce, 'Go in peace,' or 'Stop,' and what
  they say shall be done. Even the prefect in the citadel overlooking Antioch
  thinks it happy day with him when Ilderim, surnamed the Generous on account
  of good deeds done unto all manner of men, with his wives and children, and
  his trains of camels and horses, and his belongings of sheik, moving as our
  fathers Abraham and Jacob moved, comes up to exchange briefly his bitter
  wells for the pleasantness you see about us."</p>

  <p>"How is it, then?" said Ben-Hur, who had been listening unmindful of the
  slow gait of the dromedaries. "I saw the sheik tear his beard while he cursed
  himself that he had put trust in a Roman. Caesar, had he heard him, might
  have said, 'I like not such a friend as this; put him away.'"</p>

  <p>"It would be but shrewd judgment," Malluch replied, smiling. "Ilderim is
  not a lover of Rome; he has a grievance. Three years ago the Parthians rode
  across the road from Bozra to Damascus, and fell upon a caravan laden, among
  other things, with the incoming tax-returns of a district over that way. They
  slew every creature taken, which the censors in Rome could have forgiven if
  the imperial treasure had been spared and forwarded. The farmers of the
  taxes, being chargeable with the loss, complained to Caesar, and Caesar held
  Herod to payment, and Herod, on his part, seized property of Ilderim, whom he
  charged with treasonable neglect of duty. The sheik appealed to Caesar, and
  Caesar has made him such answer as might be looked for from the unwinking
  sphinx. The old man's heart has been aching sore ever since, and he nurses
  his wrath, and takes pleasure in its daily growth."</p>

  <p>"He can do nothing, Malluch."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Malluch, "that involves another explanation, which I will
  give you, if we can draw nearer. But see!&mdash;the hospitality of the sheik
  begins early&mdash;the children are speaking to you."</p>

  <p>The dromedaries stopped, and Ben-Hur looked down upon some little girls of
  the Syrian peasant class, who were offering him their baskets filled with
  dates. The fruit was freshly gathered, and not to be refused; he stooped and
  took it, and as he did so a man in the tree by which they were halted cried,
  "Peace to you, and welcome!"</p>

  <p>Their thanks said to the children, the friends moved on at such gait as
  the animals chose.</p>

  <p>"You must know," Malluch continued, pausing now and then to dispose of a
  date, "that the merchant Simonides gives me his confidence, and sometimes
  flatters me by taking me into council; and as I attend him at his house, I
  have made acquaintance with many of his friends, who, knowing my footing with
  the host, talk to him freely in my presence. In that way I became somewhat
  intimate with Sheik Ilderim."</p>

  <p>For a moment Ben-Hur's attention wandered. Before his mind's eye there
  arose the image, pure, gentle, and appealing, of Esther, the merchant's
  daughter. Her dark eyes bright with the peculiar Jewish lustre met his in
  modest gaze; he heard her step as when she approached him with the wine, and
  her voice as she tendered him the cup; and he acknowledged to himself again
  all the sympathy she manifested for him, and manifested so plainly that words
  were unnecessary, and so sweetly that words would have been but a detraction.
  The vision was exceeding pleasant, but upon his turning to Malluch, it flew
  away.</p>

  <p>"A few weeks ago," said Malluch, continuing, "the old Arab called on
  Simonides, and found me present. I observed he seemed much moved about
  something, and, in deference, offered to withdraw, but he himself forbade me.
  'As you are an Israelite,' he said, 'stay, for I have a strange story to
  tell.' The emphasis on the word Israelite excited my curiosity. I remained,
  and this is in substance his story&mdash;I cut it short because we are
  drawing nigh the tent, and I leave the details to the good man himself. A
  good many years ago, three men called at Ilderim's tent out in the
  wilderness. They were all foreigners, a Hindoo, a Greek, and an Egyptian; and
  they had come on camels, the largest he had ever seen, and all white. He
  welcomed them, and gave them rest. Next morning they arose and prayed a
  prayer new to the sheik&mdash;a prayer addressed to God and his
  son&mdash;this with much mystery besides. After breaking fast with him, the
  Egyptian told who they were, and whence they had come. Each had seen a star,
  out of which a voice had bidden them go to Jerusalem and ask, Where is he
  that is born King of the Jews?' They obeyed. From Jerusalem they were led by
  a star to Bethlehem, where, in a cave, they found a child newly born, which
  they fell down and worshipped; and after worshipping it, and giving it costly
  presents, and bearing witness of what it was, they took to their camels, and
  fled without pause to the sheik, because if Herod&mdash;meaning him surnamed
  the Great&mdash;could lay hands upon them, he would certainly kill them. And,
  faithful to his habit, the sheik took care of them, and kept them concealed
  for a year, when they departed, leaving with him gifts of great value, and
  each going a separate way."</p>

  <p>"It is, indeed, a most wonderful story," Ben-Hur exclaimed at its
  conclusion. "What did you say they were to ask at Jerusalem?"</p>

  <p>"They were to ask, 'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?'"</p>

  <p>"Was that all?"</p>

  <p>"There was more to the question, but I cannot recall it."</p>

  <p>"And they found the child?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and worshipped him."</p>

  <p>"It is a miracle, Malluch."</p>

  <p>"Ilderim is a grave man, though excitable as all Arabs are. A lie on his
  tongue is impossible."</p>

  <p>Malluch spoke positively. Thereupon the dromedaries were forgotten, and,
  quite as unmindful of their riders, they turned off the road to the growing
  grass.</p>

  <p>"Has Ilderim heard nothing more of the three men?" asked Ben-Hur. "What
  became of them?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, that was the cause of his coming to Simonides the day of which I
  was speaking. Only the night before that day the Egyptian reappeared to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Here at the door of the tent to which we are coming."</p>

  <p>"How knew he the man?"</p>

  <p>"As you knew the horses to-day&mdash;by face and manner."</p>

  <p>"By nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"He rode the same great white camel, and gave him the same
  name&mdash;Balthasar, the Egyptian."</p>

  <p>"It is a wonder of the Lord's!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur spoke with excitement.</p>

  <p>And Malluch, wondering, asked, "Why so?"</p>

  <p>"Balthasar, you said?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Balthasar, the Egyptian."</p>

  <p>"That was the name the old man gave us at the fountain today."</p>

  <p>Then, at the reminder, Malluch became excited.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he said; "and the camel was the same&mdash;and you saved the
  man's life."</p>

  <p>"And the woman," said Ben-Hur, like one speaking to himself&mdash;"the
  woman was his daughter."</p>

  <p>He fell to thinking; and even the reader will say he was having a vision
  of the woman, and that it was more welcome than that of Esther, if only
  because it stayed longer with him; but no&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Tell me again," he said, presently. "Were the three to ask, 'Where is he
  that is to be King of the Jews?'"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly. The words were BORN TO BE KING OF THE JEWS. Those were the
  words as the old sheik caught them first in the desert, and he has ever since
  been waiting the coming of the king; nor can any one shake his faith that he
  will come."</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;as king?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and bringing the doom of Rome&mdash;so says the sheik."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur kept silent awhile, thinking and trying to control his
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"The old man is one of many millions," he said, slowly&mdash;"one of many
  millions each with a wrong to avenge; and this strange faith, Malluch, is
  bread and wine to his hope; for who but a Herod may be King of the Jews while
  Rome endures? But, following the story, did you hear what Simonides said to
  him?"</p>

  <p>"If Ilderim is a grave man, Simonides is a wise one," Malluch replied. "I
  listened, and he said&mdash; But hark! Some one comes overtaking us."</p>

  <p>The noise grew louder, until presently they heard the rumble of wheels
  mixed with the beating of horse-hoofs&mdash;a moment later Sheik Ilderim
  himself appeared on horseback, followed by a train, among which were the four
  wine-red Arabs drawing the chariot. The sheik's chin, in its muffling of long
  white beard, was drooped upon his breast. Our friends had out-travelled him;
  but at sight of them he raised his head and spoke kindly.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you!&mdash;Ah, my friend Malluch! Welcome! And tell me you are
  not going, but just come; that you have something for me from the good
  Simonides&mdash;may the Lord of his fathers keep him in life for many years
  to come! Ay, take up the straps, both of you, and follow me. I have bread and
  leben, or, if you prefer it, arrack, and the flesh of young kid. Come!"</p>

  <p>They followed after him to the door of the tent, in which, when they were
  dismounted, he stood to receive them, holding a platter with three cups
  filled with creamy liquor just drawn from a great smoke-stained skin bottle,
  pendent from the central post.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he said, heartily, "drink, for this is the fear-naught of the
  tentmen."</p>

  <p>They each took a cup, and drank till but the foam remained.</p>

  <p>"Enter now, in God's name."</p>

  <p>And when they were gone in, Malluch took the sheik aside, and spoke to him
  privately; after which he went to Ben-Hur and excused himself.</p>

  <p>"I have told the sheik about you, and he will give you the trial of his
  horses in the morning. He is your friend. Having done for you all I can, you
  must do the rest, and let me return to Antioch. There is one there who has my
  promise to meet him to-night. I have no choice but to go. I will come back
  to-morrow prepared, if all goes well in the meantime, to stay with you until
  the games are over."</p>

  <p>With blessings given and received, Malluch set out in return.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch411"
     name="ch411"></a>XI. &mdash; THE WISE SERVANT AND HIS DAUGHTER</h2>

  <p class="first">What time the lower horn of a new moon touched the
  castellated piles on Mount Sulpius, and two thirds of the people of Antioch
  were out on their house-tops comforting themselves with the night breeze when
  it blew, and with fans when it failed, Simonides sat in the chair which had
  come to be a part of him, and from the terrace looked down over the river,
  and his ships a-swing at their moorings. The wall at his back cast its shadow
  broadly over the water to the opposite shore. Above him the endless tramp
  upon the bridge went on. Esther was holding a plate for him containing his
  frugal supper&mdash;some wheaten cakes, light as wafers, some honey, and a
  bowl of milk, into which he now and then dipped the wafers after dipping them
  into the honey.</p>

  <p>"Malluch is a laggard to-night," he said, showing where his thoughts
  were.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe he will come?" Esther asked.</p>

  <p>"Unless he has taken to the sea or the desert, and is yet following on, he
  will come."</p>

  <p>Simonides spoke with quiet confidence.</p>

  <p>"He may write," she said.</p>

  <p>"Not so, Esther. He would have despatched a letter when he found he could
  not return, and told me so; because I have not received such a letter, I know
  he can come, and will."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," she said, very softly.</p>

  <p>Something in the utterance attracted his attention; it might have been the
  tone, it might have been the wish. The smallest bird cannot light upon the
  greatest tree without sending a shock to its most distant fibre; every mind
  is at times no less sensitive to the most trifling words.</p>

  <p>"You wish him to come, Esther?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, lifting her eyes to his.</p>

  <p>"Why? Can you tell me?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;she hesitated, then began again&mdash;"because the young
  man is&mdash;" The stop was full.</p>

  <p>"Our master. Is that the word?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you still think I should not suffer him to go away without telling
  him to come, if he chooses, and take us&mdash;and all we have&mdash;all,
  Esther&mdash;the goods, the shekels, the ships, the slaves, and the mighty
  credit, which is a mantle of cloth of gold and finest silver spun for me by
  the greatest of the angels of men&mdash;Success."</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Does that move you nothing? No?" he said, with the slightest taint of
  bitterness. "Well, well, I have found, Esther, the worst reality is never
  unendurable when it comes out from behind the clouds through which we at
  first see it darkly&mdash;never&mdash;not even the rack. I suppose it will be
  so with death. And by that philosophy the slavery to which we are going must
  afterwhile become sweet. It pleases me even now to think what a favored man
  our master is. The fortune cost him nothing&mdash;not an anxiety, not a drop
  of sweat, not so much as a thought; it attaches to him undreamed of, and in
  his youth. And, Esther, let me waste a little vanity with the reflection; he
  gets what he could not go into the market and buy with all the pelf in a
  sum&mdash;thee, my child, my darling; thou blossom from the tomb of my lost
  Rachel!"</p>

  <p>He drew her to him, and kissed her twice&mdash;once for herself, once for
  her mother.</p>

  <p>"Say not so,". she said, when his hand fell from her neck. "Let us think
  better of him; he knows what sorrow is, and will set us free."</p>

  <p>"Ah, thy instincts are fine, Esther; and thou knowest I lean upon them in
  doubtful cases where good or bad is to be pronounced of a person standing
  before thee as he stood this morning. But&mdash;but"&mdash;his voice rose and
  hardened&mdash;"these limbs upon which I cannot stand&mdash;this body drawn
  and beaten out of human shape&mdash;they are not all I bring him of myself.
  Oh no, no! I bring him a soul which has triumphed over torture and Roman
  malice keener than any torture&mdash;I bring him a mind which has eyes to see
  gold at a distance farther than the ships of Solomon sailed, and power to
  bring it to hand&mdash;ay, Esther, into my palm here for the fingers to grip
  and keep lest it take wings at some other's word&mdash;a mind skilled at
  scheming"&mdash;he stopped and laughed&mdash;"Why, Esther, before the new
  moon which in the courts of the Temple on the Holy Hill they are this moment
  celebrating passes into its next quartering I could ring the world so as to
  startle even Caesar; for know you, child, I have that faculty which is better
  than any one sense, better than a perfect body, better than courage and will,
  better than experience, ordinarily the best product of the longest
  lives&mdash;the faculty divinest of men, but which"&mdash;he stopped, and
  laughed again, not bitterly, but with real zest&mdash;"but which even the
  great do not sufficiently account, while with the herd it is a
  non-existent&mdash;the faculty of drawing men to my purpose and holding them
  faithfully to its achievement, by which, as against things to be done, I
  multiply myself into hundreds and thousands. So the captains of my ships
  plough the seas, and bring me honest returns; so Malluch follows the youth,
  our master, and will"&mdash;just then a footstep was heard upon the
  terrace&mdash;"Ha, Esther! said I not so? He is here&mdash;and we will have
  tidings. For thy sake, sweet child&mdash;my lily just budded&mdash;I pray the
  Lord God, who has not forgotten his wandering sheep of Israel, that they be
  good and comforting. Now we will know if he will let thee go with all thy
  beauty, and me with all my faculties."</p>

  <p>Malluch came to the chair.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, good master," he said, with a low obeisance&mdash;"and to
  you, Esther, most excellent of daughters."</p>

  <p>He stood before them deferentially, and the attitude and the address left
  it difficult to define his relation to them; the one was that of a servant,
  the other indicated the familiar and friend. On the other side, Simonides, as
  was his habit in business, after answering the salutation went straight to
  the subject.</p>

  <p>"What of the young man, Malluch?"</p>

  <p>The events of the day were told quietly and in the simplest words, and
  until he was through there was no interruption; nor did the listener in the
  chair so much as move a hand during the narration; but for his eyes, wide
  open and bright, and an occasional long-drawn breath, he might have been
  accounted an effigy.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you, Malluch," he said, heartily, at the conclusion;
  "you have done well&mdash;no one could have done better. Now what say you of
  the young man's nationality?"</p>

  <p>"He is an Israelite, good master, and of the tribe of Judah."</p>

  <p>"You are positive?"</p>

  <p>"Very positive."</p>

  <p>"He appears to have told you but little of his life."</p>

  <p>"He has somewhere learned to be prudent. I might call him distrustful. He
  baffled all my attempts upon his confidence until we started from the
  Castalian fount going to the village of Daphne."</p>

  <p>"A place of abomination! Why went he there?"</p>

  <p>"I would say from curiosity, the first motive of the many who go; but,
  very strangely, he took no interest in the things he saw. Of the Temple, he
  merely asked if it were Grecian. Good master, the young man has a trouble of
  mind from which he would hide, and he went to the Grove, I think, as we go to
  sepulchres with our dead&mdash;he went to bury it."</p>

  <p>"That were well, if so," Simonides said, in a low voice; then louder,
  "Malluch, the curse of the time is prodigality. The poor make themselves
  poorer as apes of the rich, and the merely rich carry themselves like
  princes. Saw you signs of the weakness in the youth? Did he display
  moneys&mdash;coin of Rome or Israel?"</p>

  <p>"None, none, good master."</p>

  <p>"Surely, Malluch, where there are so many inducements to folly&mdash;so
  much, I mean, to eat and drink&mdash;surely he made you generous offer of
  some sort. His age, if nothing more, would warrant that much."</p>

  <p>"He neither ate nor drank in my company."</p>

  <p>"In what he said or did, Malluch, could you in anywise detect his
  master-idea? You know they peep through cracks close enough to stop the
  wind."</p>

  <p>"Give me to understand you," said Malluch, in doubt.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know we nor speak nor act, much less decide grave questions
  concerning ourselves, except as we be driven by a motive. In that respect,
  what made you of him?"</p>

  <p>"As to that, Master Simonides, I can answer with much assurance. He is
  devoted to finding his mother and sister&mdash;that first. Then he has a
  grievance against Rome; and as the Messala of whom I told you had something
  to do with the wrong, the great present object is to humiliate him. The
  meeting at the fountain furnished an opportunity, but it was put aside as not
  sufficiently public."</p>

  <p>"The Messala is influential," said Simonides, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but the next meeting will be in the Circus."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;and then?"</p>

  <p>"The son of Arrius will win."</p>

  <p>"How know you?"</p>

  <p>Malluch smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am judging by what he says."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"No; there is a much better sign&mdash;his spirit."</p>

  <p>"Ay; but, Malluch, his idea of vengeance&mdash;what is its scope? Does he
  limit it to the few who did him the wrong, or does he take in the many? And
  more&mdash;is his feeling but the vagary of a sensitive boy, or has it the
  seasoning of suffering manhood to give it endurance? You know, Malluch, the
  vengeful thought that has root merely in the mind is but a dream of idlest
  sort which one clear day will dissipate; while revenge the passion is a
  disease of the heart which climbs up, up to the brain, and feeds itself on
  both alike."</p>

  <p>In this question, Simonides for the first time showed signs of feeling; he
  spoke with rapid utterance, and with clenched hands and the eagerness of a
  man illustrating the disease he described.</p>

  <p>"Good my master," Malluch replied, "one of my reasons for believing the
  young man a Jew is the intensity of his hate. It was plain to me he had
  himself under watch, as was natural, seeing how long he has lived in an
  atmosphere of Roman jealousy; yet I saw it blaze&mdash;once when he wanted to
  know Ilderim's feeling towards Rome, and again when I told him the story of
  the sheik and the wise man, and spoke of the question, 'Where is he that is
  born King of the Jews?'"</p>

  <p>Simonides leaned forward quickly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Malluch, his words&mdash;give me his words; let me judge the
  impression the mystery made upon him."</p>

  <p>"He wanted to know the exact words. Were they TO BE or BORN TO BE? It
  appeared he was struck by a seeming difference in the effect of the two
  phrases."</p>

  <p>Simonides settled back into his pose of listening judge.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Malluch, "I told him Ilderim's view of the mystery&mdash;that
  the king would come with the doom of Rome. The young man's blood rose over
  his cheeks and forehead, and he said earnestly, 'Who but a Herod can be king
  while Rome endures?'"</p>

  <p>"Meaning what?"</p>

  <p>"That the empire must be destroyed before there could be another
  rule."</p>

  <p>Simonides gazed for a time at the ships and their shadows slowly swinging
  together in the river; when he looked up, it was to end the interview.</p>

  <p>"Enough, Malluch," he said. "Get you to eat, and make ready to return to
  the Orchard of Palms; you must help the young man in his coming trial. Come
  to me in the morning. I will send a letter to Ilderim." Then in an undertone,
  as if to himself, he added, "I may attend the Circus myself."</p>

  <p>When Malluch after the customary benediction given and received was gone,
  Simonides took a deep draught of milk, and seemed refreshed and easy of
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Put the meal down, Esther," he said; "it is over."</p>

  <p>She obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Here now."</p>

  <p>She resumed her place upon the arm of the chair close to him.</p>

  <p>"God is good to me, very good," he said, fervently. "His habit is to move
  in mystery, yet sometimes he permits us to think we see and understand him. I
  am old, dear, and must go; but now, in this eleventh hour, when my hope was
  beginning to die, he sends me this one with a promise, and I am lifted up. I
  see the way to a great part in a circumstance itself so great that it shall
  be as a new birth to the whole world. And I see a reason for the gift of my
  great riches, and the end for which they were designed. Verily, my child, I
  take hold on life anew."</p>

  <p>Esther nestled closer to him, as if to bring his thoughts from their
  far-flying.</p>

  <p>"The king has been born" he continued, imagining he was still speaking to
  her, "and he must be near the half of common life. Balthasar says he was a
  child on his mother's lap when he saw him, and gave him presents and worship;
  and Ilderim holds it was twenty-seven years ago last December when Balthasar
  and his companions came to his tent asking a hiding-place from Herod.
  Wherefore the coming cannot now be long delayed. To-night&mdash;to-morrow it
  may be. Holy fathers of Israel, what happiness in the thought! I seem to hear
  the crash of the falling of old walls and the clamor of a universal
  change&mdash;ay, and for the uttermost joy of men, the earth opens to take
  Rome in, and they look up and laugh and sing that she is not, while we are;"
  then he laughed at himself. "Why, Esther, heard you ever the like? Surely, I
  have on me the passion of a singer, the heat of blood and the thrill of
  Miriam and David. In my thoughts, which should be those of a plain worker in
  figures and facts, there is a confusion of cymbals clashing and harp-strings
  loud beaten, and the voices of a multitude standing around a new-risen
  throne. I will put the thinking by for the present; only, dear, when the king
  comes he will need money and men, for as he was a child born of woman he will
  be but a man after all, bound to human ways as you and I are. And for the
  money he will have need of getters and keepers, and for the men leaders.
  There, there! See you not a broad road for my walking, and the running of the
  youth our master?&mdash;and at the end of it glory and revenge for us
  both?&mdash;and&mdash;and"&mdash;he paused, struck with the selfishness of a
  scheme in which she had no part or good result; then added, kissing her, "And
  happiness for thy mother's child."</p>

  <p>She sat still, saying nothing. Then he remembered the difference in
  natures, and the law by which we are not permitted always to take delight in
  the same cause or be equally afraid of the same thing. He remembered she was
  but a girl.</p>

  <p>"Of what are you thinking, Esther?" he said, in his common home-like way.
  "If the thought have the form of a wish, give it me, little one, while the
  power remains mine. For power, you know, is a fretful thing, and hath its
  wings always spread for flight."</p>

  <p>She answered with a simplicity almost childish,</p>

  <p>"Send for him, father. Send for him to-night, and do not let him go into
  the Circus."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, prolonging the exclamation; and again his eyes fell upon
  the river, where the shadows were more shadowy than ever, since the moon had
  sunk far down behind Sulpius, leaving the city to the ineffectual stars.
  Shall we say it, reader? He was touched by a twinge of jealousy. If she
  should really love the young master! Oh no! That could not be; she was too
  young. But the idea had fast grip, and directly held him still and cold. She
  was sixteen. He knew it well. On the last natal day he had gone with her to
  the shipyard where there was a launch, and the yellow flag which the galley
  bore to its bridal with the waves had on it "Esther;" so they celebrated the
  day together. Yet the fact struck him now with the force of a surprise. There
  are realizations which come to us all painfully; mostly, however, such as
  pertain to ourselves; that we are growing old, for instance; and, more
  terrible, that we must die. Such a one crept into his heart, shadowy as the
  shadows, yet substantial enough to wring from him a sigh which was almost a
  groan. It was not sufficient that she should enter upon her young womanhood a
  servant, but she must carry to her master her affections, the truth and
  tenderness and delicacy of which he the father so well knew, because to this
  time they had all been his own undividedly. The fiend whose task it is to
  torture us with fears and bitter thoughts seldom does his work by halves. In
  the pang of the moment, the brave old man lost sight of his new scheme, and
  of the miraculous king its subject. By a mighty effort, however, he
  controlled himself, and asked, calmly, "Not go into the Circus, Esther? Why,
  child?"</p>

  <p>"It is not a place for a son of Israel, father."</p>

  <p>"Rabbinical, rabbinical, Esther! Is that all?"</p>

  <p>The tone of the inquiry was searching, and went to her heart, which began
  to beat loudly&mdash;so loudly she could not answer. A confusion new and
  strangely pleasant fell upon her.</p>

  <p>"The young man is to have the fortune," he said, taking her hand, and
  speaking more tenderly; "he is to have the ships and the shekels&mdash;all,
  Esther, all. Yet I did not feel poor, for thou wert left me, and thy love so
  like the dead Rachel's. Tell me, is he to have that too?"</p>

  <p>She bent over him, and laid her cheek against his head.</p>

  <p>"Speak, Esther. I will be the stronger of the knowledge. In warning there
  is strength."</p>

  <p>She sat up then, and spoke as if she were Truth's holy self.</p>

  <p>"Comfort thee, father. I will never leave thee; though he take my love, I
  will be thy handmaid ever as now."</p>

  <p>And, stooping, she kissed him.</p>

  <p>"And more," she said, continuing: "he is comely in my sight, and the
  pleading of his voice drew me to him, and I shudder to think of him in
  danger. Yes, father, I would be more than glad to see him again. Still, the
  love that is unrequited cannot be perfect love, wherefore I will wait a time,
  remembering I am thy daughter and my mother's."</p>

  <p>"A very blessing of the Lord art thou, Esther! A blessing to keep me rich,
  though all else be lost. And by his holy name and everlasting life, I swear
  thou shalt not suffer."</p>

  <p>At his request, a little later, the servant came and rolled the chair into
  the room, where he sat for a time thinking of the coming of the king, while
  she went off and slept the sleep of the innocent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch412"
     name="ch412"></a>XII. &mdash; A ROMAN ORGY</h2>

  <p class="first">The palace across the river nearly opposite Simonides' place
  is said to have been completed by the famous Epiphanes, and was all such a
  habitation can be imagined; though he was a builder whose taste ran to the
  immense rather than the classical, now so called&mdash;an architectural
  imitator, in other words, of the Persians instead of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>The wall enclosing the whole island to the waters edge, and built for the
  double purpose of bulwark against the river and defence against the mob, was
  said to have rendered the palace unfit for constant occupancy, insomuch that
  the legates abandoned it and moved to another residence erected for them on
  the western ridge of Mount Sulpius, under the Temple of Jupiter. Persons were
  not wanting, however, who flatly denied the bill against the ancient abode.
  They said, with shrewdness at least, that the real object of the removal of
  the legates was not a more healthful locality, but the assurance afforded
  them by the huge barracks, named, according to the prevalent style, citadel,
  situated just over the way on the eastern ridge of the mount. And the opinion
  had plausible showing. Among other pertinent things, it was remarked that the
  palace was kept in perpetual readiness for use; and when a consul, general of
  the army, king, or visiting potentate of any kind arrived at Antioch,
  quarters were at once assigned him on the island.</p>

  <p>As we have to do with but one apartment in the old pile, the residue of it
  is left to the reader's fancy; and as pleases him, he may go through its
  gardens, baths, halls, and labyrinth of rooms to the pavilions on the roof,
  all furnished as became a house of fame in a city which was more nearly
  Milton's "gorgeous East" than any other in the world.</p>

  <p>At this age the apartment alluded to would be termed a saloon. It was
  quite spacious, floored with polished marble slabs, and lighted in the day by
  skylights in which colored mica served as glass. The walls were broken by
  Atlantes, no two of which were alike, but all supporting a cornice wrought
  with arabesques exceedingly intricate in form, and more elegant on account of
  superadditions of color&mdash;blue, green, Tyrian purple, and gold. Around
  the room ran a continuous divan of Indian silks and wool of Cashmere. The
  furniture consisted of tables and stools of Egyptian patterns grotesquely
  carved. We have left Simonides in his chair perfecting his scheme in aid of
  the miraculous king, whose coming he has decided is so close at hand. Esther
  is asleep; and now, having crossed the river by the bridge, and made way
  through the lion-guarded gate and a number of Babylonian halls and courts,
  let us enter the gilded saloon.</p>

  <p>There are five chandeliers hanging by sliding bronze chains from the
  ceiling&mdash;one in each corner, and in the centre one&mdash;enormous
  pyramids of lighted lamps, illuminating even the demoniac faces of the
  Atlantes and the complex tracery of the cornice. About the tables, seated or
  standing, or moving restlessly from one to another, there are probably a
  hundred persons, whom we must study at least for a moment.</p>

  <p>They are all young, some of them little more than boys. That they are
  Italians and mostly Romans is past doubt. They all speak Latin in purity,
  while each one appears in the in-door dress of the great capital on the
  Tiber; that is, in tunics short of sleeve and skirt, a style of vesture well
  adapted to the climate of Antioch, and especially comfortable in the too
  close atmosphere of the saloon. On the divan here and there togas and
  lacernae lie where they have been carelessly tossed, some of them
  significantly bordered with purple. On the divan also lie sleepers stretched
  at ease; whether they were overcome by the heat and fatigue of the sultry day
  or by Bacchus we will not pause to inquire.</p>

  <p>The hum of voices is loud and incessant. Sometimes there is an explosion
  of laughter, sometimes a burst of rage or exultation; but over all prevails a
  sharp, prolonged rattle, at first somewhat confusing to the non-familiar. If
  we approach the tables, however, the mystery solves itself. The company is at
  the favorite games, draughts and dice, singly or together, and the rattle is
  merely of the tesserae, or ivory cubes, loudly shaken, and the moving of the
  hostes on the checkered boards.</p>

  <p>Who are the company?</p>

  <p>"Good Flavius," said a player, holding his piece in suspended movement,
  "thou seest yon lacerna; that one in front of us on the divan. It is fresh
  from the shop, and hath a shoulder-buckle of gold broad as a palm."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Flavius, intent upon his game, "I have seen such before;
  wherefore thine may not be old, yet, by the girdle of Venus, it is not new!
  What of it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Only I would give it to find a man who knows everything."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! For something cheaper, I will find thee here several with purple
  who will take thy offer. But play."</p>

  <p>"There&mdash;check!"</p>

  <p>"So, by all the Jupiters! Now, what sayest thou? Again?"</p>

  <p>"Be it so."</p>

  <p>"And the wager?"</p>

  <p>"A sestertium."</p>

  <p>Then each drew his tablets and stilus and made a memorandum; and, while
  they were resetting the pieces, Flavius returned to his friend's remark.</p>

  <p>"A man who knows everything! Hercle! the oracles would die. What wouldst
  thou with such a monster?"</p>

  <p>"Answer to one question, my Flavius; then, perpol! I would cut his
  throat."</p>

  <p>"And the question?"</p>

  <p>"I would have him tell me the hour&mdash; Hour, said I?&mdash;nay, the
  minute&mdash;Maxentius will arrive to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Good play, good play! I have you! And why the minute?"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou ever stood uncovered in the Syrian sun on the quay at which he
  will land? The fires of the Vesta are not so hot; and, by the Stator of our
  father Romulus, I would die, if die I must, in Rome. Avernus is here; there,
  in the square before the Forum, I could stand, and, with my hand raised thus,
  touch the floor of the gods. Ha, by Venus, my Flavius, thou didst beguile me!
  I have lost. O Fortune!"</p>

  <p>"Again?"</p>

  <p>"I must have back my sestertium."</p>

  <p>"Be it so."</p>

  <p>And they played again and again; and when day, stealing through the
  skylights, began to dim the lamps, it found the two in the same places at the
  same table, still at the game. Like most of the company, they were military
  attaches of the consul, awaiting his arrival and amusing themselves
  meantime.</p>

  <p>During this conversation a party entered the room, and, unnoticed at
  first, proceeded to the central table. The signs were that they had come from
  a revel just dismissed. Some of them kept their feet with difficulty. Around
  the leader's brow was a chaplet which marked him master of the feast, if not
  the giver. The wine had made no impression upon him unless to heighten his
  beauty, which was of the most manly Roman style; he carried his head high
  raised; the blood flushed his lips and cheeks brightly; his eyes glittered;
  though the manner in which, shrouded in a toga spotless white and of ample
  folds, he walked was too nearly imperial for one sober and not a Caesar. In
  going to the table, he made room for himself and his followers with little
  ceremony and no apologies; and when at length he stopped, and looked over it
  and at the players, they all turned to him, with a shout like a cheer.</p>

  <p>"Messala! Messala!" they cried.</p>

  <p>Those in distant quarters, hearing the cry, re-echoed it where they were.
  Instantly there were dissolution of groups, and breaking-up of games, and a
  general rush towards the centre.</p>

  <p>Messala took the demonstration indifferently, and proceeded presently to
  show the ground of his popularity.</p>

  <p>"A health to thee, Drusus, my friend," he said to the player next at his
  right; "a health&mdash;and thy tablets a moment."</p>

  <p>He raised the waxen boards, glanced at the memoranda of wagers, and tossed
  them down.</p>

  <p>"Denarii, only denarii&mdash;coin of cartmen and butchers!" he said, with
  a scornful laugh. "By the drunken Semele, to what is Rome coming, when a
  Caesar sits o' nights waiting a turn of fortune to bring him but a beggarly
  denarius!"</p>

  <p>The scion of the Drusi reddened to his brows, but the bystanders broke in
  upon his reply by surging closer around the table, and shouting, "The
  Messala! the Messala!"</p>

  <p>"Men of the Tiber," Messala continued, wresting a box with the dice in it
  from a hand near-by, "who is he most favored of the gods? A Roman. Who is he
  lawgiver of the nations? A Roman. Who is he, by sword right, the universal
  master?"</p>

  <p>The company were of the easily inspired, and the thought was one to which
  they were born; in a twinkling they snatched the answer from him.</p>

  <p>"A Roman, a Roman!" they shouted.</p>

  <p>"Yet&mdash;yet"&mdash;he lingered to catch their ears&mdash;"yet there is
  a better than the best of Rome."</p>

  <p>He tossed his patrician head and paused, as if to sting them with his
  sneer.</p>

  <p>"Hear ye?" he asked. "There is a better than the best of Rome."</p>

  <p>"Ay&mdash;Hercules!" cried one.</p>

  <p>"Bacchus!" yelled a satirist.</p>

  <p>"Jove&mdash;Jove!" thundered the crowd.</p>

  <p>"No," Messala answered, "among men."</p>

  <p>"Name him, name him!" they demanded.</p>

  <p>"I will," he said, the next lull. "He who to the perfection of Rome hath
  added the perfection of the East; who to the arm of conquest, which is
  Western, hath also the art needful to the enjoyment of dominion, which is
  Eastern."</p>

  <p>"Perpol! His best is a Roman, after all," some one shouted; and there was
  a great laugh, and long clapping of hands&mdash;an admission that Messala had
  the advantage.</p>

  <p>"In the East" he continued, "we have no gods, only Wine, Women, and
  Fortune, and the greatest of them is Fortune; wherefore our motto, 'Who
  dareth what I dare?'&mdash;fit for the senate, fit for battle, fittest for
  him who, seeking the best, challenges the worst."</p>

  <p>His voice dropped into an easy, familiar tone, but without relaxing the
  ascendancy he had gained.</p>

  <p>"In the great chest up in the citadel I have five talents coin current in
  the markets, and here are the receipts for them."</p>

  <p>From his tunic he drew a roll of paper, and, flinging it on the table,
  continued, amidst breathless silence, every eye having him in view fixed on
  his, every ear listening:</p>

  <p>"The sum lies there the measure of what I dare. Who of you dares so much!
  You are silent. Is it too great? I will strike off one talent. What! still
  silent? Come, then, throw me once for these three talents&mdash;only three;
  for two; for one&mdash;one at least&mdash;one for the honor of the river by
  which you were born&mdash;Rome East against Rome West!&mdash;Orontes the
  barbarous against Tiber the sacred!"</p>

  <p>He rattled the dice overhead while waiting.</p>

  <p>"The Orontes against the Tiber!" he repeated, with an increase of scornful
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>Not a man moved; then he flung the box upon the table and, laughing, took
  up the receipts.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! By the Olympian Jove, I know now ye have fortunes to make or
  to mend; therefore are ye come to Antioch. Ho, Cecilius!"</p>

  <p>"Here, Messala!" cried a man behind him; "here am I, perishing in the mob,
  and begging a drachma to settle with the ragged ferryman. But, Pluto take me!
  these new ones have not so much as an obolus among them."</p>

  <p>The sally provoked a burst of laughter, under which the saloon rang and
  rang again. Messala alone kept his gravity.</p>

  <p>"Go, thou," he said to Cecilius, "to the chamber whence we came, and bid
  the servants bring the amphorae here, and the cups and goblets. If these our
  countrymen, looking for fortune, have not purses, by the Syrian Bacchus, I
  will see if they are not better blessed with stomachs! Haste thee!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Drusus, with a laugh heard throughout the apartment.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, my friend! Be thou not offended because I levelled the Caesar in
  thee down to the denarii. Thou seest I did but use the name to try these fine
  fledglings of our old Rome. Come, my Drusus, come!" He took up the box again
  and rattled the dice merrily. "Here, for what sum thou wilt, let us measure
  fortunes."</p>

  <p>The manner was frank, cordial, winsome. Drusus melted in a moment.</p>

  <p>"By the Nymphae, yes!" he said, laughing. "I will throw with thee,
  Messala&mdash;for a denarius."</p>

  <p>A very boyish person was looking over the table watching the scene.
  Suddenly Messala turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The lad drew back.</p>

  <p>"Nay, by Castor! and his brother too! I meant not offence. It is a rule
  among men, in matters other than dice, to keep the record closest when the
  deal is least. I have need of a clerk. Wilt thou serve me?"</p>

  <p>The young fellow drew his tablets ready to keep the score: the manner was
  irresistible.</p>

  <p>"Hold, Messala, hold!" cried Drusus. "I know not if it be ominous to stay
  the poised dice with a question; but one occurs to me, and I must ask it
  though Venus slap me with her girdle."</p>

  <p>"Nay, my Drusus, Venus with her girdle off is Venus in love. To thy
  question&mdash;I will make the throw and hold it against mischance.
  Thus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned the box upon the table and held it firmly over the dice.</p>

  <p>And Drusus asked, "Did you ever see one Quintus Arrius?"</p>

  <p>"The duumvir?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;his son?"</p>

  <p>"I knew not he had a son."</p>

  <p>"Well, it is nothing," Drusus added, indifferently; "only, my Messala,
  Pollux was not more like Castor than Arrius is like thee."</p>

  <p>The remark had the effect of a signal: twenty voices took it up.</p>

  <p>"True, true! His eyes&mdash;his face," they cried.</p>

  <p>"What!" answered one, disgusted. "Messala is a Roman; Arrius is a
  Jew."</p>

  <p>"Thou sayest right," a third exclaimed. "He is a Jew, or Momus lent his
  mother the wrong mask."</p>

  <p>There was promise of a dispute; seeing which, Messala interposed. "The
  wine is not come, my Drusus; and, as thou seest, I have the freckled Pythias
  as they were dogs in leash. As to Arrius, I will accept thy opinion of him,
  so thou tell me more about him."</p>

  <p>"Well, be he Jew or Roman&mdash;and, by the great god Pan, I say it not in
  disrespect of thy feelings, my Messala!&mdash;this Arrius is handsome and
  brave and shrewd. The emperor offered him favor and patronage, which he
  refused. He came up through mystery, and keepeth distance as if he felt
  himself better or knew himself worse than the rest of us. In the palaestrae
  he was unmatched; he played with the blue-eyed giants from the Rhine and the
  hornless bulls of Sarmatia as they were willow wisps. The duumvir left him
  vastly rich. He has a passion for arms, and thinks of nothing but war.
  Maxentius admitted him into his family, and he was to have taken ship with
  us, but we lost him at Ravenna. Nevertheless he arrived safely. We heard of
  him this morning. Perpol! Instead of coming to the palace or going to the
  citadel, he dropped his baggage at the khan, and hath disappeared again."</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the speech Messala listened with polite indifference;
  as it proceeded, he became more attentive; at the conclusion, he took his
  hand from the dice-box, and called out, "Ho, my Caius! Dost thou hear?"</p>

  <p>A youth at his elbow&mdash;his Myrtilus, or comrade, in the day's chariot
  practice&mdash;answered, much pleased with the attention, "Did I not, my
  Messala, I were not thy friend."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou remember the man who gave thee the fall to-day?"</p>

  <p>"By the love-locks of Bacchus, have I not a bruised shoulder to help me
  keep it in mind?" and he seconded the words with a shrug that submerged his
  ears.</p>

  <p>"Well, be thou grateful to the Fates&mdash;I have found thy enemy.
  Listen."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Messala turned to Drusus.</p>

  <p>"Tell us more of him&mdash;perpol!&mdash;of him who is both Jew and
  Roman&mdash;by Phoebus, a combination to make a Centaur lovely! What garments
  doth he affect, my Drusus?"</p>

  <p>"Those of the Jews."</p>

  <p>"Hearest thou, Caius?" said Messala. "The fellow is young&mdash;one; he
  hath the visage of a Roman&mdash;two; he loveth best the garb of a
  Jew&mdash;three; and in the palaestrae fame and fortune come of arms to throw
  a horse or tilt a chariot, as the necessity may order&mdash;four. And,
  Drusus, help thou my friend again. Doubtless this Arrius hath tricks of
  language; otherwise he could not so confound himself, to-day a Jew, to-morrow
  a Roman; but of the rich tongue of Athene&mdash;discourseth he in that as
  well?"</p>

  <p>"With such purity, Messala, he might have been a contestant in the
  Isthmia."</p>

  <p>"Art thou listening, Caius?" said Messala. "The fellow is qualified to
  salute a woman&mdash;for that matter Aristomache herself&mdash;in the Greek;
  and as I keep the count, that is five. What sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>"Thou hast found him, my Messala," Caius answered; "or I am not
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Thy pardon, Drusus&mdash;and pardon of all&mdash;for speaking in riddles
  thus," Messala said, in his winsome way. "By all the decent gods, I would not
  strain thy courtesy to the point of breaking, but now help thou me.
  See!"&mdash;he put his hand on the dice-box again, laughing&mdash;"See how
  close I hold the Pythias and their secret! Thou didst speak, I think, of
  mystery in connection with the coming of the son of Arrius. Tell me of
  that."</p>

  <p>"'Tis nothing, Messala, nothing," Drusus replied; "a child's story. When
  Arrius, the father, sailed in pursuit of the pirates, he was without wife or
  family; he returned with a boy&mdash;him of whom we speak&mdash;and next day
  adopted him."</p>

  <p>"Adopted him?" Messala repeated. "By the gods, Drusus, thou dost, indeed,
  interest me! Where did the duumvir find the boy? And who was he?"</p>

  <p>"Who shall answer thee that, Messala? who but the young Arrius himself?
  Perpol! in the fight the duumvir&mdash;then but a tribune&mdash;lost his
  galley. A returning vessel found him and one other&mdash;all of the crew who
  survived&mdash;afloat upon the same plank. I give you now the story of the
  rescuers, which hath this excellence at least&mdash;it hath never been
  contradicted. They say, the duumvir's companion on the plank was a
  Jew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A Jew!" echoed Messala.</p>

  <p>"And a slave."</p>

  <p>"How Drusus? A slave?"</p>

  <p>"When the two were lifted to the deck, the duumvir was in his tribune's
  armor, and the other in the vesture of a rower."</p>

  <p>Messala rose from leaning against the table.</p>

  <p>"A galley"&mdash;he checked the debasing word, and looked around, for once
  in his life at loss. Just then a procession of slaves filed into the room,
  some with great jars of wine, others with baskets of fruits and confections,
  others again with cups and flagons, mostly silver. There was inspiration in
  the sight. Instantly Messala climbed upon a stool.</p>

  <p>"Men of the Tiber," he said, in a clear voice, "let us turn this waiting
  for our chief into a feast of Bacchus. Whom choose ye for master?"</p>

  <p>Drusus arose.</p>

  <p>"Who shall be master but the giver of the feast?" he said. "Answer,
  Romans."</p>

  <p>They gave their reply in a shout.</p>

  <p>Messala took the chaplet from his head, gave it to Drusus, who climbed
  upon the table, and, in the view of all, solemnly replaced it, making Messala
  master of the night.</p>

  <p>"There came with me into the room," he said, "some friends just risen from
  table. That our feast may have the approval of sacred custom, bring hither
  that one of them most overcome by wine."</p>

  <p>A din of voices answered, "Here he is, here he is!"</p>

  <p>And from the floor where he had fallen, a youth was brought forward, so
  effeminately beautiful he might have passed for the drinking-god
  himself&mdash;only the crown would have dropped from his head, and the
  thyrsus from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Lift him upon the table," the master said.</p>

  <p>It was found he could not sit.</p>

  <p>"Help him, Drusus, as the fair Nyone may yet help thee."</p>

  <p>Drusus took the inebriate in his arms.</p>

  <p>Then addressing the limp figure, Messala said, amidst profound silence, "O
  Bacchus! greatest of the gods, be thou propitious to-night. And for myself,
  and these thy votaries, I vow this chaplet"&mdash;and from his head he raised
  it reverently&mdash;"I vow this chaplet to thy altar in the Grove of
  Daphne."</p>

  <p>He bowed, replaced the crown upon his locks, then stooped and uncovered
  the dice, saying, with a laugh, "See, my Drusus, by the ass of Silenus, the
  denarius is mine!"</p>

  <p>There was a shout that set the floor to quaking, and the grim Atlantes to
  dancing, and the orgies began.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch413"
     name="ch413"></a>XIII. &mdash; A DRIVER FOR ILDERIM'S ARABS</h2>

  <p class="first">Sheik Ilderim was a man of too much importance to go about
  with a small establishment. He had a reputation to keep with his tribe, such
  as became a prince and patriarch of the greatest following in all the Desert
  east of Syria; with the people of the cities he had another reputation, which
  was that of one of the richest personages not a king in all the East; and,
  being rich in fact&mdash;in money as well as in servants, camels, horses, and
  flocks of all kinds&mdash;he took pleasure in a certain state, which, besides
  magnifying his dignity with strangers, contributed to his personal pride and
  comfort. Wherefore the reader must not be misled by the frequent reference to
  his tent in the Orchard of Palms. He had there really a respectable dowar;
  that is to say, he had there three large tents&mdash;one for himself, one for
  visitors, one for his favorite wife and her women; and six or eight lesser
  ones, occupied by his servants and such tribal retainers as he had chosen to
  bring with him as a body-guard&mdash;strong men of approved courage, and
  skillful with bow, spear, and horses.</p>

  <p>To be sure, his property of whatever kind was in no danger at the Orchard;
  yet as the habits of a man go with him to town not less than the country, and
  as it is never wise to slip the bands of discipline, the interior of the
  dowar was devoted to his cows, camels, goats, and such property in general as
  might tempt a lion or a thief.</p>

  <p>To do him full justice, Ilderim kept well all the customs of his people,
  abating none, not even the smallest; in consequence his life at the Orchard
  was a continuation of his life in the Desert; nor that alone, it was a fair
  reproduction of the old patriarchal modes&mdash;the genuine pastoral life of
  primitive Israel.</p>

  <p>Recurring to the morning the caravan arrived at the Orchard&mdash;"Here,
  plant it here," he said, stopping his horse, and thrusting a spear into the
  ground. "Door to the south; the lake before it thus; and these, the children
  of the Desert, to sit under at the going-down of the sun."</p>

  <p>At the last words he went to a group of three great palm-trees, and patted
  one of them as he would have patted his horse's neck, or the cheek of the
  child of his love.</p>

  <p>Who but the sheik could of right say to the caravan, Halt! or of the tent,
  Here be it pitched? The spear was wrested from the ground, and over the wound
  it had riven in the sod the base of the first pillar of the tent was planted,
  marking the centre of the front door. Then eight others were planted&mdash;in
  all, three rows of pillars, three in a row. Then, at call, the women and
  children came, and unfolded the canvas from its packing on the camels. Who
  might do this but the women? Had they not sheared the hair from the brown
  goats of the flock? and twisted it into thread? and woven the thread into
  cloth? and stitched the cloth together, making the perfect roof, dark-brown
  in fact, though in the distance black as the tents of Kedar? And, finally,
  with what jests and laughter, and pulls altogether, the united following of
  the sheik stretched the canvas from pillar to pillar, driving the stakes and
  fastening the cords as they went! And when the walls of open reed matting
  were put in place&mdash;the finishing-touch to the building after the style
  of the Desert&mdash;with what hush of anxiety they waited the good man's
  judgment! When he walked in and out, looking at the house in connection with
  the sun, the trees, and the lake, and said, rubbing his hands with might of
  heartiness, "Well done! Make the dowar now as ye well know, and to-night we
  will sweeten the bread with arrack, and the milk with honey, and at every
  fire there shall be a kid. God with ye! Want of sweet water there shall not
  be, for the lake is our well; neither shall the bearers of burden hunger, or
  the least of the flock, for here is green pasture also. God with you all, my
  children! Go."</p>

  <p>And, shouting, the many happy went their ways then to pitch their own
  habitations. A few remained to arrange the interior for the sheik; and of
  these the men-servants hung a curtain to the central row of pillars, making
  two apartments; the one on the right sacred to Ilderim himself, the other
  sacred to his horses&mdash;his jewels of Solomon&mdash;which they led in, and
  with kisses and love-taps set at liberty. Against the middle pillar they then
  erected the arms-rack, and filled it with javelins and spears, and bows,
  arrows, and shields; outside of them hanging the master's sword, modelled
  after the new moon; and the glitter of its blade rivalled the glitter of the
  jewels bedded in its grip. Upon one end of the rack they hung the housings of
  the horses, gay some of them as the livery of a king's servant, while on the
  other end they displayed the great man's wearing apparel&mdash;his robes
  woollen and robes linen, his tunics and trousers, and many colored kerchiefs
  for the head. Nor did they give over the work until he pronounced it
  well.</p>

  <p>Meantime the women drew out and set up the divan, more indispensable to
  him than the beard down-flowing over his breast, white as Aaron's. They put a
  frame together in shape of three sides of a square, the opening to the door,
  and covered it with cushions and base curtains, and the cushions with a
  changeable spread striped brown and yellow; at the corners they placed
  pillows and bolsters sacked in cloth blue and crimson; then around the divan
  they laid a margin of carpet, and the inner space they carpeted as well; and
  when the carpet was carried from the opening of the divan to the door of the
  tent, their work was done; whereupon they again waited until the master said
  it was good. Nothing remained then but to bring and fill the jars with water,
  and hang the skin bottles of arrack ready for the hand&mdash;to-morrow the
  leben. Nor might an Arab see why Ilderim should not be both happy and
  generous&mdash;in his tent by the lake of sweet waters, under the palms of
  the Orchard of Palms.</p>

  <p>Such was the tent at the door of which we left Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>Servants were already waiting the master's direction. One of them took off
  his sandals; another unlatched Ben-Hur's Roman shoes; then the two exchanged
  their dusty outer garments for fresh ones of white linen.</p>

  <p>"Enter&mdash;in God's name, enter, and take thy rest," said the host,
  heartily, in the dialect of the Market-place of Jerusalem; forthwith he led
  the way to the divan.</p>

  <p>"I will sit here," he said next, pointing; "and there the stranger."</p>

  <p>A woman&mdash;in the old time she would have been called a
  handmaid&mdash;answered, and dexterously piled the pillows and bolsters as
  rests for the back; after which they sat upon the side of the divan, while
  water was brought fresh from the lake, and their feet bathed and dried with
  napkins.</p>

  <p>"We have a saying in the Desert," Ilderim began, gathering his beard, and
  combing it with his slender fingers, "that a good appetite is the promise of
  a long life. Hast thou such?"</p>

  <p>"By that rule, good sheik, I will live a hundred years. I am a hungry wolf
  at thy door," Ben-Hur replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, thou shalt not be sent away like a wolf. I will give thee the best
  of the flocks."</p>

  <p>Ilderim clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>"Seek the stranger in the guest-tent, and say I, Ilderim, send him a
  prayer that his peace may be as incessant as the flowing of waters."</p>

  <p>The man in waiting bowed.</p>

  <p>"Say, also," Ilderim continued, "that I have returned with another for
  breaking of bread; and, if Balthasar the wise careth to share the loaf, three
  may partake of it, and the portion of the birds be none the less."</p>

  <p>The second servant went away.</p>

  <p>"Let us take our rest now."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Ilderim settled himself upon the divan, as at this day merchants
  sit on their rugs in the bazaars of Damascus; and when fairly at rest, he
  stopped combing his beard, and said, gravely, "That thou art my guest, and
  hast drunk my leben, and art about to taste my salt, ought not to forbid a
  question: Who art thou?"</p>

  <p>"Sheik Ilderim," said Ben-Hur, calmly enduring his gaze, "I pray thee not
  to think me trifling with thy just demand; but was there never a time in thy
  life when to answer such a question would have been a crime to thyself?"</p>

  <p>"By the splendor of Solomon, yes!" Ilderim answered. "Betrayal of self is
  at times as base as the betrayal of a tribe."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, thanks, good sheik!" Ben-Hur exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Never answer became thee better. Now I know thou dost but seek assurance
  to justify the trust I have come to ask, and that such assurance is of more
  interest to thee than the affairs of my poor life."</p>

  <p>The sheik in his turn bowed, and Ben-Hur hastened to pursue his
  advantage.</p>

  <p>"So it please thee then," he said, "first, I am not a Roman, as the name
  given thee as mine implieth."</p>

  <p>Ilderim clasped the beard overflowing his breast, and gazed at the speaker
  with eyes faintly twinkling through the shade of the heavy close-drawn
  brows.</p>

  <p>"In the next place," Ben-Hur continued, "I am an Israelite of the tribe of
  Judah."</p>

  <p>The sheik raised his brows a little.</p>

  <p>"Nor that merely. Sheik, I am a Jew with a grievance against Rome compared
  with which thine is not more than a child's trouble."</p>

  <p>The old man combed his beard with nervous haste, and let fall his brows
  until even the twinkle of the eyes went out.</p>

  <p>"Still further: I swear to thee, Sheik Ilderim&mdash;I swear by the
  covenant the Lord made with my fathers&mdash;so thou but give me the revenge
  I seek, the money and the glory of the race shall be thine."</p>

  <p>Ilderim's brows relaxed; his head arose; his face began to beam; and it
  was almost possible to see the satisfaction taking possession of him.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" he said. "If at the roots of thy tongue there is a lie in coil,
  Solomon himself had not been safe against thee. That thou art not a
  Roman&mdash;that as a Jew thou hast a grievance against Rome, and revenge to
  compass, I believe; and on that score enough. But as to thy skill. What
  experience hast thou in racing with chariots? And the horses&mdash;canst thou
  make them creatures of thy will?&mdash;to know thee? to come at call? to go,
  if thou sayest it, to the last extreme of breath and strength? and then, in
  the perishing moment, out of the depths of thy life thrill them to one
  exertion the mightiest of all? The gift, my son, is not to every one. Ah, by
  the splendor of God! I knew a king who governed millions of men, their
  perfect master, but could not win the respect of a horse. Mark! I speak not
  of the dull brutes whose round it is to slave for slaves&mdash;the debased in
  blood and image&mdash;the dead in spirit; but of such as mine here&mdash;the
  kings of their kind; of a lineage reaching back to the broods of the first
  Pharaoh; my comrades and friends, dwellers in tents, whom long association
  with me has brought up to my plane; who to their instincts have added our
  wits and to their senses joined our souls, until they feel all we know of
  ambition, love, hate, and contempt; in war, heroes; in trust, faithful as
  women. Ho, there!"</p>

  <p>A servant came forward.</p>

  <p>"Let my Arabs come!"</p>

  <p>The man drew aside part of the division curtain of the tent, exposing to
  view a group of horses, who lingered a moment where they were as if to make
  certain of the invitation.</p>

  <p>"Come!" Ilderim said to them. "Why stand ye there? What have I that is not
  yours? Come, I say!"</p>

  <p>They stalked slowly in.</p>

  <p>"Son of Israel," the master said, "thy Moses was a mighty man,
  but&mdash;ha, ha ha!&mdash;I must laugh when I think of his allowing thy
  fathers the plodding ox and the dull, slow-natured ass, and forbidding them
  property in horses. Ha, ha, ha! Thinkest thou he would have done so had he
  seen that one&mdash;and that&mdash;and this?" At the word he laid his hand
  upon the face of the first to reach him, and patted it with infinite pride
  and tenderness.</p>

  <p>"It is a misjudgment, sheik, a misjudgment," Ben-Hur said, warmly. "Moses
  was a warrior as well as a lawgiver beloved by God; and to follow
  war&mdash;ah, what is it but to love all its creatures&mdash;these among the
  rest?"</p>

  <p>A head of exquisite turn&mdash;with large eyes, soft as a deer's, and half
  hidden by the dense forelock, and small ears, sharp-pointed and sloped well
  forward&mdash;approached then quite to his breast, the nostrils open, and the
  upper lip in motion. "Who are you?" it asked, plainly as ever man spoke.
  Ben-Hur recognized one of the four racers he had seen on the course, and gave
  his open hand to the beautiful brute.</p>

  <p>"They will tell you, the blasphemers!&mdash;may their days shorten as they
  grow fewer!"&mdash;the sheik spoke with the feeling of a man repelling a
  personal defamation&mdash;"they will tell you, I say, that our horses of the
  best blood are derived from the Nesaean pastures of Persia. God gave the
  first Arab a measureless waste of sand, with some treeless mountains, and
  here and there a well of bitter waters; and said to him, 'Behold thy
  country!' And when the poor man complained, the Mighty One pitied him, and
  said again, 'Be of cheer! for I will twice bless thee above other men.' The
  Arab heard, and gave thanks, and with faith set out to find the blessings. He
  travelled all the boundaries first, and failed; then he made a path into the
  desert, and went on and on&mdash;and in the heart of the waste there was an
  island of green very beautiful to see; and in the heart of the island, lo! a
  herd of camels, and another of horses! He took them joyfully and kept them
  with care for what they were&mdash;best gifts of God. And from that green
  isle went forth all the horses of the earth; even to the pastures of Nesaea
  they went; and northward to the dreadful vales perpetually threshed by blasts
  from the Sea of Chill Winds. Doubt not the story; or if thou dost, may never
  amulet have charm for an Arab again. Nay, I will give thee proof."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the records of the tribe," he said to the servant who
  responded.</p>

  <p>While waiting, the sheik played with the horses, patting their cheeks,
  combing their forelocks with his fingers, giving each one a token of
  remembrance. Presently six men appeared with chests of cedar reinforced by
  bands of brass, and hinged and bolted with brass.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Ilderim, when they were all set down by the divan, "I meant
  not all of them; only the records of the horses&mdash;that one. Open it and
  take back the others."</p>

  <p>The chest was opened, disclosing a mass of ivory tablets strung on rings
  of silver wire; and as the tablets were scarcely thicker than wafers, each
  ring held several hundreds of them.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Ilderim, taking some of the rings in his hand&mdash;"I know
  with what care and zeal, my son, the scribes of the Temple in the Holy City
  keep the names of the newly born, that every son of Israel may trace his line
  of ancestry to its beginning, though it antedate the patriarchs. My
  fathers&mdash;may the recollection of them be green forever!&mdash;did not
  think it sinful to borrow the idea, and apply it to their dumb servants. See
  these tablets!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took the rings, and separating the tablets saw they bore rude
  hieroglyphs in Arabic, burned on the smooth surface by a sharp point of
  heated metal.</p>

  <p>"Canst thou read them, O son of Israel?"</p>

  <p>"No. Thou must tell me their meaning."</p>

  <p>"Know thou, then, each tablet records the name of a foal of the pure blood
  born to my fathers through the hundreds of years passed; and also the names
  of sire and dam. Take them, and note their age, that thou mayst the more
  readily believe."</p>

  <p>Some of the tablets were nearly worn away. All were yellow with age.</p>

  <p>"In the chest there, I can tell thee now, I have the perfect history;
  perfect because certified as history seldom is&mdash;showing of what stock
  all these are sprung&mdash;this one, and that now supplicating thy notice and
  caress; and as they come to us here, their sires, even the furthest removed
  in time, came to my sires, under a tent-roof like this of mine, to eat their
  measure of barley from the open hand, and be talked to as children; and as
  children kiss the thanks they have not speech to express. And now, O son of
  Israel, thou mayst believe my declaration&mdash;if I am a lord of the Desert,
  behold my ministers! Take them from me, and I become as a sick man left by
  the caravan to die. Thanks to them, age hath not diminished the terror of me
  on the highways between cities; and it will not while I have strength to go
  with them. Ha, ha, ha! I could tell thee marvels done by their ancestors. In
  a favoring time I may do so; for the present, enough that they were never
  overtaken in retreat; nor, by the sword of Solomon, did they ever fail in
  pursuit! That, mark you, on the sands and under saddle; but now&mdash;I do
  not know&mdash;I am afraid, for they are under yoke the first time, and the
  conditions of success are so many. They have the pride and the speed and the
  endurance. If I find them a master, they will win. Son of Israel! so thou art
  the man, I swear it shall be a happy day that brought thee thither. Of
  thyself now speak."</p>

  <p>"I know now," said Ben-Hur, "why it is that in the love of an Arab his
  horse is next to his children; and I know, also, why the Arab horses are the
  best in the world; but, good sheik, I would not have you judge me by words
  alone; for, as you know, all promises of men sometimes fail. Give me the
  trial first on some plain hereabout, and put the four in my hand
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Ilderim's face beamed again, and he would have spoken.</p>

  <p>"A moment, good sheik, a moment!" said Ben-Hur. "Let me say further. From
  the masters in Rome I learned many lessons, little thinking they would serve
  me in a time like this. I tell thee these thy sons of the Desert, though they
  have separately the speed of eagles and the endurance of lions, will fail if
  they are not trained to run together under the yoke. For bethink thee, sheik,
  in every four there is one the slowest and one the swiftest; and while the
  race is always to the slowest, the trouble is always with the swiftest. It
  was so to-day; the driver could not reduce the best to harmonious action with
  the poorest. My trial may have no better result; but if so, I will tell thee
  of it: that I swear. Wherefore, in the same spirit I say, can I get them to
  run together, moved by my will, the four as one, thou shalt have the
  sestertii and the crown, and I my revenge. What sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>Ilderim listened, combing his beard the while. At the end he said, with a
  laugh, "I think better of thee, son of Israel. We have a saying in the
  Desert, 'If you will cook the meal with words, I will promise an ocean of
  butter.' thou shalt have the horses in the morning."</p>

  <p>At that moment there was a stir at the rear entrance to the tent.</p>

  <p>"The supper&mdash;it is here! and yonder my friend Balthasar, whom thou
  shalt know. He hath a story to tell which an Israelite should never tire of
  hearing."</p>

  <p>And to the servants he added,</p>

  <p>"Take the records away, and return my jewels to their apartment."</p>

  <p>And they did as he ordered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch414"
     name="ch414"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE DOWAR IN THE ORCHARD OF PALMS</h2>

  <p class="first">If the reader will return now to the repast of the wise men
  at their meeting in the desert, he will understand the preparations for the
  supper in Ilderim's tent. The differences were chiefly such as were incident
  to ampler means and better service.</p>

  <p>Three rugs were spread on the carpet within the space so nearly enclosed
  by the divan; a table not more than a foot in height was brought and set
  within the same place, and covered with a cloth. Off to one side a portable
  earthenware oven was established under the presidency of a woman whose duty
  it was to keep the company in bread, or, more precisely, in hot cakes of
  flour from the handmills grinding with constant sound in a neighboring
  tent.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Balthasar was conducted to the divan, where Ilderim and Ben-Hur
  received him standing. A loose black gown covered his person; his step was
  feeble, and his whole movement slow and cautious, apparently dependent upon a
  long staff and the arm of a servant.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, my friend," said Ilderim, respectfully. "Peace and
  welcome."</p>

  <p>The Egyptian raised his head and replied, "And to thee, good
  sheik&mdash;to thee and thine, peace and the blessing of the One
  God&mdash;God the true and loving."</p>

  <p>The manner was gentle and devout, and impressed Ben-Hur with a feeling of
  awe; besides which the blessing included in the answering salutation had been
  partly addressed to him, and while that part was being spoken, the eyes of
  the aged guest, hollow yet luminous, rested upon his face long enough to stir
  an emotion new and mysterious, and so strong that he again and again during
  the repast scanned the much wrinkled and bloodless face for its meaning; but
  always there was the expression bland, placid, and trustful as a child's. A
  little later he found that expression habitual.</p>

  <p>"This is he, O Balthasar," said the sheik, laying his hand on Ben-Hur's
  arm, "who will break bread with us this evening."</p>

  <p>The Egyptian glanced at the young man, and looked again surprised and
  doubting; seeing which the sheik continued, "I have promised him my horses
  for trial to-morrow; and if all goes well, he will drive them in the
  Circus."</p>

  <p>Balthasar continued his gaze.</p>

  <p>"He came well recommended," Ilderim pursued, much puzzled. "You may know
  him as the son of Arrius, who was a noble Roman sailor, though"&mdash;the
  sheik hesitated, then resumed, with a laugh&mdash;"though he declares himself
  an Israelite of the tribe of Judah; and, by the splendor of God, I believe
  that he tells me!"</p>

  <p>Balthasar could no longer withhold explanation.</p>

  <p>"To-day, O most generous sheik, my life was in peril, and would have been
  lost had not a youth, the counterpart of this one&mdash;if, indeed, he be not
  the very same&mdash;intervened when all others fled, and saved me." Then he
  addressed Ben-Hur directly, "Art thou not he?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot answer so far," Ben-Hur replied, with modest deference. "I am he
  who stopped the horses of the insolent Roman when they were rushing upon thy
  camel at the Fountain of Castalia. Thy daughter left a cup with me."</p>

  <p>From the bosom of his tunic he produced the cup, and gave it to
  Balthasar.</p>

  <p>A glow lighted the faded countenance of the Egyptian.</p>

  <p>"The Lord sent thee to me at the Fountain to-day," he said, in a tremulous
  voice, stretching his hand towards Ben-Hur; "and he sends thee to me now. I
  give him thanks; and praise him thou, for of his favor I have wherewith to
  give thee great reward, and I will. The cup is thine; keep it."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took back the gift, and Balthasar, seeing the inquiry upon
  Ilderim's face, related the occurrence at the Fountain.</p>

  <p>"What!" said the sheik to Ben-Hur. "Thou saidst nothing of this to me,
  when better recommendation thou couldst not have brought. Am I not an Arab,
  and sheik of my tribe of tens of thousands? And is not he my guest? And is it
  not in my guest-bond that the good or evil thou dost him is good or evil done
  to me? Whither shouldst thou go for reward but here? And whose the hand to
  give it but mine?"</p>

  <p>His voice at the end of the speech rose to cutting shrillness.</p>

  <p>"Good sheik, spare me, I pray. I came not for reward, great or small; and
  that I may be acquitted of the thought, I say the help I gave this excellent
  man would have been given as well to thy humblest servant."</p>

  <p>"But he is my friend, my guest&mdash;not my servant; and seest thou not in
  the difference the favor of Fortune?" Then to Balthasar the sheik subjoined,
  "Ah, by the splendor of God! I tell thee again he is not a Roman."</p>

  <p>With that he turned away, and gave attention to the servants, whose
  preparations for the supper were about complete.</p>

  <p>The reader who recollects the history of Balthasar as given by himself at
  the meeting in the desert will understand the effect of Ben-Hur's assertion
  of disinterestedness upon that worthy. In his devotion to men there had been,
  it will be remembered, no distinctions; while the redemption which had been
  promised him in the way of reward&mdash;the redemption for which he was
  waiting&mdash;was universal. To him, therefore, the assertion sounded
  somewhat like an echo of himself. He took a step nearer Ben-Hur, and spoke to
  him in the childlike way.</p>

  <p>"How did the sheik say I should call you? It was a Roman name, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Arrius, the son of Arrius."</p>

  <p>"Yet thou art not a Roman?"</p>

  <p>"All my people were Jews."</p>

  <p>"Were, saidst thou? Are they not living?"</p>

  <p>The question was subtle as well as simple; but Ilderim saved Ben-Hur from
  reply.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said to them, "the meal is ready."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur gave his arm to Balthasar, and conducted him to the table, where
  shortly they were all seated on their rugs Eastern fashion. The lavers were
  brought them, and they washed and dried their hands; then the sheik made a
  sign, the servants stopped, and the voice of the Egyptian arose tremulous
  with holy feeling.</p>

  <p>"Father of All&mdash;God! What we have is of thee; take our thanks, and
  bless us, that we may continue to do thy will."</p>

  <p>It was the grace the good man had said simultaneously with his brethren
  Gaspar the Greek and Melchior the Hindoo, the utterance in diverse tongues
  out of which had come the miracle attesting the Divine Presence at the meal
  in the desert years before.</p>

  <p>The table to which they immediately addressed themselves was, as may be
  thought, rich in the substantials and delicacies favorite in the
  East&mdash;in cakes hot from the oven, vegetables from the gardens, meats
  singly, compounds of meats and vegetables, milk of kine, and honey and
  butter&mdash;all eaten or drunk, it should be remarked, without any of the
  modern accessories&mdash;knives, forks, spoons, cups, or plates; and in this
  part of the repast but little was said, for they were hungry. But when the
  dessert was in course it was otherwise. They laved their hands again, had the
  lap-cloths shaken out, and with a renewed table and the sharp edge of their
  appetites gone they were disposed to talk and listen.</p>

  <p>With such a company&mdash;an Arab, a Jew, and an Egyptian, all believers
  alike in one God&mdash;there could be at that age but one subject of
  conversation; and of the three, which should be speaker but he to whom the
  Deity had been so nearly a personal appearance, who had seen him in a star,
  had heard his voice in direction, had been led so far and so miraculously by
  his Spirit? And of what should he talk but that of which he had been called
  to testify?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch415"
     name="ch415"></a>XV. &mdash; BALTHASAR IMPRESSES BEN-HUR</h2>

  <p class="first">The shadows cast over the Orchard of Palms by the mountains
  at set of sun left no sweet margin time of violet sky and drowsing earth
  between the day and night. The latter came early and swift; and against its
  glooming in the tent this evening the servants brought four candlesticks of
  brass, and set them by the corners of the table. To each candlestick there
  were four branches, and on each branch a lighted silver lamp and a supply cup
  of olive-oil. In light ample, even brilliant, the group at dessert continued
  their conversation, speaking in the Syriac dialect, familiar to all peoples
  in that part of the world.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian told his story of the meeting of the three in the desert, and
  agreed with the sheik that it was in December, twenty-seven years before,
  when he and his companions fleeing from Herod arrived at the tent praying
  shelter. The narrative was heard with intense interest; even the servants
  lingering when they could to catch its details. Ben-Hur received it as became
  a man listening to a revelation of deep concern to all humanity, and to none
  of more concern than the people of Israel. In his mind, as we shall presently
  see, there was crystallizing an idea which was to change his course of life,
  if not absorb it absolutely.</p>

  <p>As the recital proceeded, the impression made by Balthasar upon the young
  Jew increased; at its conclusion, his feeling was too profound to permit a
  doubt of its truth; indeed, there was nothing left him desirable in the
  connection but assurances, if such were to be had, pertaining exclusively to
  the consequences of the amazing event.</p>

  <p>And now there is wanting an explanation which the very discerning may have
  heretofore demanded; certainly it can be no longer delayed. Our tale begins,
  in point of date not less than fact, to trench close upon the opening of the
  ministry of the Son of Mary, whom we have seen but once since this same
  Balthasar left him worshipfully in his mother's lap in the cave by Bethlehem.
  Henceforth to the end the mysterious Child will be a subject of continual
  reference; and slowly though surely the current of events with which we are
  dealing will bring us nearer and nearer to him, until finally we see him a
  man&mdash;we would like, if armed contrariety of opinion would permit it, to
  add&mdash;A MAN WHOM THE WORLD COULD NOT DO WITHOUT. Of this declaration,
  apparently so simple, a shrewd mind inspired by faith will make
  much&mdash;and in welcome. Before his time, and since, there have been men
  indispensable to particular people and periods; but his indispensability was
  to the whole race, and for all time&mdash;a respect in which it is unique,
  solitary, divine.</p>

  <p>To Sheik Ilderim the story was not new. He had heard it from the three
  wise men together under circumstances which left no room for doubt; he had
  acted upon it seriously, for the helping a fugitive escape from the anger of
  the first Herod was dangerous. Now one of the three sat at his table again, a
  welcome guest and revered friend. Sheik Ilderim certainly believed the story;
  yet, in the nature of things, its mighty central fact could not come home to
  him with the force and absorbing effect it came to Ben-Hur. He was an Arab,
  whose interest in the consequences was but general; on the other hand,
  Ben-Hur was an Israelite and a Jew, with more than a special interest
  in&mdash;if the solecism can be pardoned&mdash;the truth of the fact. He laid
  hold of the circumstance with a purely Jewish mind.</p>

  <p>From his cradle, let it be remembered, he had heard of the Messiah; at the
  colleges he had been made familiar with all that was known of that Being at
  once the hope, the fear, and the peculiar glory of the chosen people; the
  prophets from the first to the last of the heroic line foretold him; and the
  coming had been, and yet was, the theme of endless exposition with the
  rabbis&mdash;in the synagogues, in the schools, in the Temple, of fast-days
  and feast-days, in public and in private, the national teachers expounded and
  kept expounding until all the children of Abraham, wherever their lots were
  cast, bore the Messiah in expectation, and by it literally, and with iron
  severity, ruled and moulded their lives.</p>

  <p>Doubtless, it will be understood from this that there was much argument
  among the Jews themselves about the Messiah, and so there was; but the
  disputation was all limited to one point, and one only&mdash;when would he
  come?</p>

  <p>Disquisition is for the preacher; whereas the writer is but telling a
  tale, and that he may not lose his character, the explanation he is making
  requires notice merely of a point connected with the Messiah about which the
  unanimity among the chosen people was matter of marvellous astonishment: he
  was to be, when come, the KING OF THE JEWS&mdash;their political King, their
  Caesar. By their instrumentality he was to make armed conquest of the earth,
  and then, for their profit and in the name of God, hold it down forever. On
  this faith, dear reader, the Pharisees or Separatists&mdash;the latter being
  rather a political term&mdash;in the cloisters and around the altars of the
  Temple, built an edifice of hope far overtopping the dream of the Macedonian.
  His but covered the earth; theirs covered the earth and filled the skies;
  that is to say, in their bold, boundless fantasy of blasphemous egotism, God
  the Almighty was in effect to suffer them for their uses to nail him by the
  ear to a door in sign of eternal servitude.</p>

  <p>Returning directly to Ben-Hur, it is to be observed now that there were
  two circumstances in his life the result of which had been to keep him in a
  state comparatively free from the influence and hard effects of the audacious
  faith of his Separatist countrymen.</p>

  <p>In the first place, his father followed the faith of the Sadducees, who
  may, in a general way, be termed the Liberals of their time. They had some
  loose opinions in denial of the soul. They were strict constructionists and
  rigorous observers of the Law as found in the books of Moses; but they held
  the vast mass of Rabbinical addenda to those books in derisive contempt. They
  were unquestionably a sect, yet their religion was more a philosophy than a
  creed; they did not deny themselves the enjoyments of life, and saw many
  admirable methods and productions among the Gentile divisions of the race. In
  politics they were the active opposition of the Separatists. In the natural
  order of things, these circumstances and conditions, opinions and
  peculiarities, would have descended to the son as certainly and really as any
  portion of his father's estate; and, as we have seen, he was actually in
  course of acquiring them, when the second saving event overtook him.</p>

  <p>Upon a youth of Ben-Hur's mind and temperament the influence of five years
  of affluent life in Rome can be appreciated best by recalling that the great
  city was then, in fact, the meeting-place of the nations&mdash;their
  meeting-place politically and commercially, as well as for the indulgence of
  pleasure without restraint. Round and round the golden mile-stone in front of
  the Forum&mdash;now in gloom of eclipse, now in unapproachable
  splendor&mdash;flowed all the active currents of humanity. If excellences of
  manner, refinements of society, attainments of intellect, and glory of
  achievement made no impression upon him, how could he, as the son of Arrius,
  pass day after day, through a period so long, from the beautiful villa near
  Misenum into the receptions of Caesar, and be wholly uninfluenced by what he
  saw there of kings, princes, ambassadors, hostages, and delegates, suitors
  all of them from every known land, waiting humbly the yes or no which was to
  make or unmake them? As mere assemblages, to be sure, there was nothing to
  compare with the gatherings at Jerusalem in celebration of the Passover; yet
  when he sat under the purple velaria of the Circus Maximus one of three
  hundred and fifty thousand spectators, he must have been visited by the
  thought that possibly there might be some branches of the family of man
  worthy divine consideration, if not mercy, though they were of the
  uncircumcised&mdash;some, by their sorrows, and, yet worse, by their
  hopelessness in the midst of sorrows, fitted for brotherhood in the promises
  to his countrymen.</p>

  <p>That he should have had such a thought under such circumstances was but
  natural; we think so much, at least, will be admitted: but when the
  reflection came to him, and he gave himself up to it, he could not have been
  blind to a certain distinction. The wretchedness of the masses, and their
  hopeless condition, had no relation whatever to religion; their murmurs and
  groans were not against their gods or for want of gods. In the oak-woods of
  Britain the Druids held their followers; Odin and Freya maintained their
  godships in Gaul and Germany and among the Hyperboreans; Egypt was satisfied
  with her crocodiles and Anubis; the Persians were yet devoted to Ormuzd and
  Ahriman, holding them in equal honor; in hope of the Nirvana, the Hindoos
  moved on patient as ever in the rayless paths of Brahm; the beautiful Greek
  mind, in pauses of philosophy, still sang the heroic gods of Homer; while in
  Rome nothing was so common and cheap as gods. According to whim, the masters
  of the world, because they were masters, carried their worship and offerings
  indifferently from altar to altar, delighted in the pandemonium they had
  erected. Their discontent, if they were discontented, was with the number of
  gods; for, after borrowing all the divinities of the earth they proceeded to
  deify their Caesars, and vote them altars and holy service. No, the unhappy
  condition was not from religion, but misgovernment and usurpations and
  countless tyrannies. The Avernus men had been tumbled into, and were praying
  to be relieved from, was terribly but essentially political. The
  supplication&mdash;everywhere alike, in Lodinum, Alexandria, Athens,
  Jerusalem&mdash;was for a king to conquer with, not a god to worship.</p>

  <p>Studying the situation after two thousand years, we can see and say that
  religiously there was no relief from the universal confusion except some God
  could prove himself a true God, and a masterful one, and come to the rescue;
  but the people of the time, even the discerning and philosophical, discovered
  no hope except in crushing Rome; that done, the relief would follow in
  restorations and reorganizations; therefore they prayed, conspired, rebelled,
  fought, and died, drenching the soil to-day with blood, to-morrow with
  tears&mdash;and always with the same result.</p>

  <p>It remains to be said now that Ben-Hur was in agreement with the mass of
  men of his time not Romans. The five years' residence in the capital served
  him with opportunity to see and study the miseries of the subjugated world;
  and in full belief that the evils which afflicted it were political, and to
  be cured only by the sword, he was going forth to fit himself for a part in
  the day of resort to the heroic remedy. By practice of arms he was a perfect
  soldier; but war has its higher fields, and he who would move successfully in
  them must know more than to defend with shield and thrust with spear. In
  those fields the general finds his tasks, the greatest of which is the
  reduction of the many into one, and that one himself; the consummate captain
  is a fighting-man armed with an army. This conception entered into the scheme
  of life to which he was further swayed by the reflection that the vengeance
  he dreamed of, in connection with his individual wrongs, would be more surely
  found in some of the ways of war than in any pursuit of peace.</p>

  <p>The feelings with which he listened to Balthasar can be now understood.
  The story touched two of the most sensitive points of his being so they rang
  within him. His heart beat fast&mdash;and faster still when, searching
  himself, he found not a doubt either that the recital was true in every
  particular, or that the Child so miraculously found was the Messiah.
  Marvelling much that Israel rested so dead to the revelation, and that he had
  never heard of it before that day, two questions presented themselves to him
  as centring all it was at that moment further desirable to know:</p>

  <p>Where was the Child then?</p>

  <p>And what was his mission?</p>

  <p>With apologies for the interruptions, he proceeded to draw out the
  opinions of Balthasar, who was in nowise loath to speak.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch416"
     name="ch416"></a>XVI. &mdash; CHRIST IS COMING&mdash;BALTHASAR</h2>

  <p class="first">"If I could answer you," Balthasar said, in his simple,
  earnest, devout way&mdash;"oh, if I knew where he is, how quickly I would go
  to him! The seas should not stay me, nor the mountains."</p>

  <p>"You have tried to find him, then?" asked Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>A smile flitted across the face of the Egyptian.</p>

  <p>"The first task I charged myself with after leaving the shelter given me
  in the desert"&mdash;Balthasar cast a grateful look at Ilderim&mdash;"was to
  learn what became of the Child. But a year had passed, and I dared not go up
  to Judea in person, for Herod still held the throne bloody-minded as ever. In
  Egypt, upon my return, there were a few friends to believe the wonderful
  things I told them of what I had seen and heard&mdash;a few who rejoiced with
  me that a Redeemer was born&mdash;a few who never tired of the story. Some of
  them came up for me looking after the Child. They went first to Bethlehem,
  and found there the khan and the cave; but the steward&mdash;he who sat at
  the gate the night of the birth, and the night we came following the
  star&mdash;was gone. The king had taken him away, and he was no more
  seen."</p>

  <p>"But they found some proofs, surely," said Ben-Hur, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, proofs written in blood&mdash;a village in mourning; mothers yet
  crying for their little ones. You must know, when Herod heard of our flight,
  he sent down and slew the youngest-born of the children of Bethlehem. Not one
  escaped. The faith of my messengers was confirmed; but they came to me saying
  the Child was dead, slain with the other innocents."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" exclaimed Ben-Hur, aghast. "Dead, sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, my son, I did not say so. I said they, my messengers, told me the
  Child was dead. I did not believe the report then; I do not believe it
  now."</p>

  <p>"I see&mdash;thou hast some special knowledge."</p>

  <p>"Not so, not so," said Balthasar, dropping his gaze. "The Spirit was to go
  with us no farther than to the Child. When we came out of the cave, after our
  presents were given and we had seen the babe, we looked first thing for the
  star; but it was gone, and we knew we were left to ourselves. The last
  inspiration of the Holy One&mdash;the last I can recall&mdash;was that which
  sent us to Ilderim for safety."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the sheik, fingering his beard nervously. "You told me you
  were sent to me by a Spirit&mdash;I remember it."</p>

  <p>"I have no special knowledge," Balthasar continued, observing the
  dejection which had fallen upon Ben-Hur; "but, my son, I have given the
  matter much thought&mdash;thought continuing through years, inspired by
  faith, which, I assure you, calling God for witness, is as strong in me now
  as in the hour I heard the voice of the Spirit calling me by the shore of the
  lake. If you will listen, I will tell you why I believe the Child is
  living."</p>

  <p>Both Ilderim and Ben-Hur looked assent, and appeared to summon their
  faculties that they might understand as well as hear. The interest reached
  the servants, who drew near to the divan, and stood listening. Throughout the
  tent there was the profoundest silence.</p>

  <p>"We three believe in God."</p>

  <p>Balthasar bowed his head as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"And he is the Truth," he resumed. "His word is God. The hills may turn to
  dust, and the seas be drunk dry by south winds; but his word shall stand,
  because it is the Truth."</p>

  <p>The utterance was in a manner inexpressibly solemn.</p>

  <p>"The voice, which was his, speaking to me by the lake, said, 'Blessed art
  thou, O son of Mizraim! The Redemption cometh. With two others from the
  remotenesses of the earth, thou shalt see the Savior.' I have seen the
  Savior&mdash;blessed be his name!&mdash;but the Redemption, which was the
  second part of the promise, is yet to come. Seest thou now? If the Child be
  dead, there is no agent to bring the Redemption about, and the word is
  naught, and God&mdash;nay, I dare not say it!"</p>

  <p>He threw up both hands in horror.</p>

  <p>"The Redemption was the work for which the Child was born; and so long as
  the promise abides, not even death can separate him from his work until it is
  fulfilled, or at least in the way of fulfilment. Take you that now as one
  reason for my belief; then give me further attention."</p>

  <p>The good man paused.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou not taste the wine? It is at thy hand&mdash;see," said Ilderim,
  respectfully.</p>

  <p>Balthasar drank, and, seeming refreshed, continued:</p>

  <p>"The Savior I saw was born of woman, in nature like us, and subject to all
  our ills&mdash;even death. Let that stand as the first proposition. Consider
  next the work set apart to him. Was it not a performance for which only a man
  is fitted?&mdash;a man wise, firm, discreet&mdash;a man, not a child? To
  become such he had to grow as we grow. Bethink you now of the dangers his
  life was subject to in the interval&mdash;the long interval between childhood
  and maturity. The existing powers were his enemies; Herod was his enemy; and
  what would Rome have been? And as for Israel&mdash;that he should not be
  accepted by Israel was the motive for cutting him off. See you now. What
  better way was there to take care of his life in the helpless growing time
  than by passing him into obscurity? Wherefore I say to myself, and to my
  listening faith, which is never moved except by yearning of love&mdash;I say
  he is not dead, but lost; and, his work remaining undone, he will come again.
  There you have the reasons for my belief. Are they not good?"</p>

  <p>Ilderim's small Arab eyes were bright with understanding, and Ben-Hur,
  lifted from his dejection, said heartily, "I, at least, may not gainsay them.
  What further, pray?"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou not enough, my son? Well," he began, in calmer tone, "seeing
  that the reasons were good&mdash;more plainly, seeing it was God's will that
  the Child should not be found&mdash;I settled my faith into the keeping of
  patience, and took to waiting." He raised his eyes, full of holy trust, and
  broke off abstractedly&mdash;"I am waiting now. He lives, keeping well his
  mighty secret. What though I cannot go to him, or name the hill or the vale
  of his abiding-place? He lives&mdash;it may be as the fruit in blossom, it
  may be as the fruit just ripening; but by the certainty there is in the
  promise and reason of God, I know he lives."</p>

  <p>A thrill of awe struck Ben-Hur&mdash;a thrill which was but the dying of
  his half-formed doubt.</p>

  <p>"Where thinkest thou he is?" he asked, in a low voice, and hesitating,
  like one who feels upon his lips the pressure of a sacred silence.</p>

  <p>Balthasar looked at him kindly, and replied, his mind not entirely freed
  from its abstraction,</p>

  <p>"In my house on the Nile, so close to the river that the passers-by in
  boats see it and its reflection in the water at the same time&mdash;in my
  house, a few weeks ago, I sat thinking. A man thirty years old, I said to
  myself, should have his fields of life all ploughed, and his planting well
  done; for after that it is summer-time, with space scarce enough to ripen his
  sowing. The Child, I said further, is now twenty-seven&mdash;his time to
  plant must be at hand. I asked myself, as you here asked me, my son, and
  answered by coming hither, as to a good resting-place close by the land thy
  fathers had from God. Where else should he appear, if not in Judea? In what
  city should he begin his work, if not in Jerusalem? Who should be first to
  receive the blessings he is to bring, if not the children of Abraham, Isaac,
  and Jacob; in love, at least, the children of the Lord? If I were bidden go
  seek him, I would search well the hamlets and villages on the slopes of the
  mountains of Judea and Galilee falling eastwardly into the valley of the
  Jordan. He is there now. Standing in a door or on a hill-top, only this
  evening he saw the sun set one day nearer the time when he himself shall
  become the light of the world."</p>

  <p>Balthasar ceased, with his hand raised and finger pointing as if at Judea.
  All the listeners, even the dull servants outside the divan, affected by his
  fervor, were startled as if by a majestic presence suddenly apparent within
  the tent. Nor did the sensation die away at once: of those at the table, each
  sat awhile thinking. The spell was finally broken by Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"I see, good Balthasar," he said, "that thou hast been much and strangely
  favored. I see, also, that thou art a wise man indeed. It is not in my power
  to tell how grateful I am for the things thou hast told me. I am warned of
  the coming of great events, and borrow somewhat from thy faith. Complete the
  obligation, I pray thee, by telling further of the mission of him for whom
  thou art waiting, and for whom from this night I too shall wait as becomes a
  believing son of Judah. He is to be a Savior, thou saidst; is he not to be
  King of the Jews also?"</p>

  <p>"My son," said Balthasar, in his benignant way, "the mission is yet a
  purpose in the bosom of God. All I think about it is wrung from the words of
  the Voice in connection with the prayer to which they were in answer. Shall
  we refer to them again?"</p>

  <p>"Thou art the teacher."</p>

  <p>"The cause of my disquiet," Balthasar began, calmly&mdash;"that which made
  me a preacher in Alexandria and in the villages of the Nile; that which drove
  me at last into the solitude where the Spirit found me&mdash;was the fallen
  condition of men, occasioned, as I believed, by loss of the knowledge of God.
  I sorrowed for the sorrows of my kind&mdash;not of one class, but all of
  them. So utterly were they fallen it seemed to me there could be no
  Redemption unless God himself would make it his work; and I prayed him to
  come, and that I might see him. 'Thy good works have conquered. The
  Redemption cometh; thou shalt see the Savior'&mdash;thus the Voice spake; and
  with the answer I went up to Jerusalem rejoicing. Now, to whom is the
  Redemption? To all the world. And how shall it be? Strengthen thy faith, my
  son! Men say, I know, that there will be no happiness until Rome is razed
  from her hills. That is to say, the ills of the time are not, as I thought
  them, from ignorance of God, but from the misgovernment of rulers. Do we need
  to be told that human governments are never for the sake of religion? How
  many kings have you heard of who were better than their subjects? Oh no, no!
  The Redemption cannot be for a political purpose&mdash;to pull down rulers
  and powers, and vacate their places merely that others may take and enjoy
  them. If that were all of it, the wisdom of God would cease to be surpassing.
  I tell you, though it be but the saying of blind to blind, he that comes is
  to be a Savior of souls; and the Redemption means God once more on earth, and
  righteousness, that his stay here may be tolerable to himself."</p>

  <p>Disappointment showed plainly on Ben-Hur's face&mdash;his head drooped;
  and if he was not convinced, he yet felt himself incapable that moment of
  disputing the opinion of the Egyptian. Not so Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"By the splendor of God!" he cried, impulsively, "the judgment does away
  with all custom. The ways of the world are fixed, and cannot be changed.
  There must be a leader in every community clothed with power, else there is
  no reform."</p>

  <p>Balthasar received the burst gravely.</p>

  <p>"Thy wisdom, good sheik, is of the world; and thou dost forget that it is
  from the ways of the world we are to be redeemed. Man as a subject is the
  ambition of a king; the soul of a man for its salvation is the desire of a
  God."</p>

  <p>Ilderim, though silenced, shook his head, unwilling to believe. Ben-Hur
  took up the argument for him.</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;I call thee such by permission," he said&mdash;"for whom
  wert thou required to ask at the gates of Jerusalem?"</p>

  <p>The sheik threw him a grateful look.</p>

  <p>"I was to ask of the people," said Balthasar, quietly, "'Where is he that
  is born King of the Jews?'"</p>

  <p>"And you saw him in the cave by Bethlehem?"</p>

  <p>"We saw and worshipped him, and gave him presents&mdash;Melchior, gold;
  Gaspar, frankincense; and I, myrrh."</p>

  <p>"When thou dost speak of fact, O father, to hear thee is to believe," said
  Ben-Hur; "but in the matter of opinion, I cannot understand the kind of king
  thou wouldst make of the Child&mdash;I cannot separate the ruler from his
  powers and duties."</p>

  <p>"Son," said Balthasar, "we have the habit of studying closely the things
  which chance to lie at our feet, giving but a look at the greater objects in
  the distance. Thou seest now but the title&mdash;KING OF THE JEWS; wilt thou
  lift thine eyes to the mystery beyond it, the stumbling-block will disappear.
  Of the title, a word. Thy Israel hath seen better days&mdash;days in which
  God called thy people endearingly his people, and dealt with them through
  prophets. Now, if in those days he promised them the Savior I
  saw&mdash;promised him as KING OF THE JEWS&mdash;the appearance must be
  according to the promise, if only for the word's sake. Ah, thou seest the
  reason of my question at the gate!&mdash;thou seest, and I will no more of
  it, but pass on. It may be, next, thou art regarding the dignity of the
  Child; if so, bethink thee&mdash;what is it to be a successor of
  Herod?&mdash;by the world's standard of honor, what? Could not God better by
  his beloved? If thou canst think of the Almighty Father in want of a title,
  and stooping to borrow the inventions of men, why was I not bidden ask for a
  Caesar at once? Oh, for the substance of that whereof we speak, look higher,
  I pray thee! Ask rather of what he whom we await shall be king; for I do
  tell, my son, that is the key to the mystery, which no man shall understand
  without the key."</p>

  <p>Balthasar raised his eyes devoutly.</p>

  <p>"There is a kingdom on the earth, though it is not of it&mdash;a kingdom
  of wider bounds than the earth&mdash;wider than the sea and the earth, though
  they were rolled together as finest gold and spread by the beating of
  hammers. Its existence is a fact as our hearts are facts, and we journey
  through it from birth to death without seeing it; nor shall any man see it
  until he hath first known his own soul; for the kingdom is not for him, but
  for his soul. And in its dominion there is glory such as hath not entered
  imagination&mdash;original, incomparable, impossible of increase."</p>

  <p>"What thou sayest, father, is a riddle to me," said Ben-Hur. "I never
  heard of such a kingdom."</p>

  <p>"Nor did I," said Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"And I may not tell more of it," Balthasar added, humbly dropping his
  eyes. "What it is, what it is for, how it may be reached, none can know until
  the Child comes to take possession of it as his own. He brings the key of the
  viewless gate, which he will open for his beloved, among whom will be all who
  love him, for of such only the redeemed will be."</p>

  <p>After that there was a long silence, which Balthasar accepted as the end
  of the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Good sheik," he said, in his placid way, "to-morrow or the next day I
  will go up to the city for a time. My daughter wishes to see the preparations
  for the games. I will speak further about the time of our going. And, my son,
  I will see you again. To you both, peace and good-night."</p>

  <p>They all arose from the table. The sheik and Ben-Hur remained looking
  after the Egyptian until he was conducted out of the tent.</p>

  <p>"Sheik Ilderim," said Ben-Hur then, "I have heard strange things tonight.
  Give me leave, I pray, to walk by the lake that I may think of them."</p>

  <p>"Go; and I will come after you."</p>

  <p>They washed their hands again; after which, at a sign from the master, a
  servant brought Ben-Hur his shoes, and directly he went out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch417"
     name="ch417"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE KINGDOM&mdash;SPIRITUAL OR
     POLITICAL?</h2>

  <p class="first">Up a little way from the dower there was a cluster of palms,
  which threw its shade half in the water, half on the land. A bulbul sang from
  the branches a song of invitation. Ben-Hur stopped beneath to listen. At any
  other time the notes of the bird would have driven thought away; but the
  story of the Egyptian was a burden of wonder, and he was a laborer carrying
  it, and, like other laborers, there was to him no music in the sweetest music
  until mind and body were happily attuned by rest.</p>

  <p>The night was quiet. Not a ripple broke upon the shore. The old stars of
  the old East were all out, each in its accustomed place; and there was summer
  everywhere&mdash;on land, on lake, in the sky.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur's imagination was heated, his feelings aroused, his will all
  unsettled.</p>

  <p>So the palms, the sky, the air, seemed to him of the far south zone into
  which Balthasar had been driven by despair for men; the lake, with its
  motionless surface, was a suggestion of the Nilotic mother by which the good
  man stood praying when the Spirit made its radiant appearance. Had all these
  accessories of the miracle come to Ben-Hur? or had he been transferred to
  them? And what if the miracle should be repeated&mdash;and to him? He feared,
  yet wished, and even waited for the vision. When at last his feverish mood
  was cooled, permitting him to become himself, he was able to think.</p>

  <p>His scheme of life has been explained. In all reflection about it
  heretofore there had been one hiatus which he had not been able to bridge or
  fill up&mdash;one so broad he could see but vaguely to the other side of it.
  When, finally, he was graduated a captain as well as a soldier, to what
  object should he address his efforts? Revolution he contemplated, of course;
  but the processes of revolution have always been the same, and to lead men
  into them there have always been required, first, a cause or presence to
  enlist adherents; second, an end, or something as a practical achievement. As
  a rule he fights well who has wrongs to redress; but vastly better fights he
  who, with wrongs as a spur, has also steadily before him a glorious result in
  prospect&mdash;a result in which he can discern balm for wounds, compensation
  for valor, remembrance and gratitude in the event of death.</p>

  <p>To determine the sufficiency of either the cause or the end, it was
  needful that Ben-Hur should study the adherents to whom he looked when all
  was ready for action. Very naturally, they were his countrymen. The wrongs of
  Israel were to every son of Abraham, and each one was a cause vastly holy,
  vastly inspiring.</p>

  <p>Ay, the cause was there; but the end&mdash;what should it be?</p>

  <p>The hours and days he had given this branch of his scheme were past
  calculation&mdash;all with the same conclusion&mdash;a dim, uncertain,
  general idea of national liberty. Was it sufficient? He could not say no, for
  that would have been the death of his hope; he shrank from saying yes,
  because his judgment taught him better. He could not assure himself even that
  Israel was able single-handed to successfully combat Rome. He knew the
  resources of that great enemy; he knew her art was superior to her resources.
  A universal alliance might suffice, but, alas! that was impossible,
  except&mdash;and upon the exception how long and earnestly he had
  dwelt!&mdash;except a hero would come from one of the suffering nations, and
  by martial successes accomplish a renown to fill the whole earth. What glory
  to Judea could she prove the Macedonia of the new Alexander! Alas, again!
  Under the rabbis valor was possible, but not discipline. And then the taunt
  of Messala in the garden of Herod&mdash;"All you conquer in the six days, you
  lose on the seventh."</p>

  <p>So it happened he never approached the chasm thinking to surmount it, but
  he was beaten back; and so incessantly had he failed in the object that he
  had about given it over, except as a thing of chance. The hero might be
  discovered in his day, or he might not. God only knew. Such his state of
  mind, there need be no lingering upon the effect of Malluch's skeleton
  recital of the story of Balthasar. He heard it with a bewildering
  satisfaction&mdash;a feeling that here was the solution of the
  trouble&mdash;here was the requisite hero found at last; and he a son of the
  Lion tribe, and King of the Jews! Behind the hero, lo! the world in arms.</p>

  <p>The king implied a kingdom; he was to be a warrior glorious as David, a
  ruler wise and magnificent as Solomon; the kingdom was to be a power against
  which Rome was to dash itself to pieces. There would be colossal war, and the
  agonies of death and birth&mdash;then peace, meaning, of course, Judean
  dominion forever.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur's heart beat hard as for an instant he had a vision of Jerusalem
  the capital of the world, and Zion, the site of the throne of the Universal
  Master.</p>

  <p>It seemed to the enthusiast rare fortune that the man who had seen the
  king was at the tent to which he was going. He could see him there, and hear
  him, and learn of him what all he knew of the coming change, especially all
  he knew of the time of its happening. If it were at hand, the campaign with
  Maxentius should be abandoned; and he would go and set about organizing and
  arming the tribes, that Israel might be ready when the great day of the
  restoration began to break.</p>

  <p>Now, as we have seen, from Balthasar himself Ben-Hur had the marvelous
  story. Was he satisfied?</p>

  <p>There was a shadow upon him deeper than that of the cluster of
  palms&mdash;the shadow of a great uncertainty, which&mdash;take note, O
  reader! which pertained more to the kingdom than the king.</p>

  <p>"What of this kingdom? And what is it to be?" Ben-Hur asked himself in
  thought.</p>

  <p>Thus early arose the questions which were to follow the Child to his end,
  and survive him on earth&mdash;incomprehensible in his day, a dispute in
  this&mdash;an enigma to all who do not or cannot understand that every man is
  two in one&mdash;a deathless Soul and a mortal Body.</p>

  <p>"What is it to be?" he asked.</p>

  <p>For us, O reader, the Child himself has answered; but for Ben-Hur there
  were only the words of Balthasar, "On the earth, yet not of it&mdash;not for
  men, but for their souls&mdash;a dominion, nevertheless, of unimaginable
  glory."</p>

  <p>What wonder the hapless youth found the phrases but the darkening of a
  riddle?</p>

  <p>"The hand of man is not in it," he said, despairingly. "Nor has the king
  of such a kingdom use for men; neither toilers, nor councillors, nor
  soldiers. The earth must die or be made anew, and for government new
  principles must be discovered&mdash;something besides armed
  hands&mdash;something in place of Force. But what?"</p>

  <p>Again, O reader!</p>

  <p>That which we will not see, he could not. The power there is in Love had
  not yet occurred to any man; much less had one come saying directly that for
  government and its objects&mdash;peace and order&mdash;Love is better and
  mightier than Force.</p>

  <p>In the midst of his reverie a hand was laid upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I have a word to say, O son of Arrius," said Ilderim, stopping by his
  side&mdash;"a word, and then I must return, for the night is going."</p>

  <p>"I give you welcome, sheik."</p>

  <p>"As to the things you have heard but now," said Ilderim, almost without
  pause, "take in belief all save that relating to the kind of kingdom the
  Child will set up when he comes; as to so much keep virgin mind until you
  hear Simonides the merchant&mdash;a good man here in Antioch, to whom I will
  make you known. The Egyptian gives you coinage of his dreams which are too
  good for the earth; Simonides is wiser; he will ring you the sayings of your
  prophets, giving book and page, so you cannot deny that the Child will be
  King of the Jews in fact&mdash;ay, by the splendor of God! a king as Herod
  was, only better and far more magnificent. And then, see you, we will taste
  the sweetness of vengeance. I have said. Peace to you!"</p>

  <p>"Stay&mdash;sheik!"</p>

  <p>If Ilderim heard his call, he did not stay.</p>

  <p>"Simonides again!" said Ben-Hur, bitterly. "Simonides here, Simonides
  there; from this one now, then from that! I am like to be well ridden by my
  father's servant, who knows at least to hold fast that which is mine;
  wherefore he is richer, if indeed he be not wiser, than the Egyptian. By the
  covenant! it is not to the faithless a man should go to find a faith to
  keep&mdash;and I will not. But, hark! singing&mdash;and the voice a
  woman's&mdash;or an angel's! It comes this way."</p>

  <p>Down the lake towards the dower came a woman singing. Her voice floated
  along the hushed water melodious as a flute, and louder growing each instant.
  Directly the dipping of oars was heard in slow measure; a little later the
  words were distinguishable&mdash;words in purest Greek, best fitted of all
  the tongues of the day for the expression of passionate grief.</p><br>

  <h3>THE LAMENT. (Egyptian.)</h3>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">I sigh as I sing for the story land<br>
  Across the Syrian sea.<br>
  The odorous winds from the musky sand<br>
  Were breaths of life to me.<br>
  They play with the plumes of the whispering palm<br>
  For me, alas! no more;<br>
  Nor more does the Nile in the moonlit calm<br>
  Moan past the Memphian shore.</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">O Nilus! thou god of my fainting soul!<br>
  In dreams thou comest to me;<br>
  And, dreaming, I play with the lotus bowl,<br>
  And sing old songs to thee;<br>
  And hear from afar the Memnonian strain,<br>
  And calls from dear Simbel;<br>
  And wake to a passion of grief and pain<br>
  That e'er I said&mdash;Farewell!</p><br>

  <p>At the conclusion of the song the singer was past the cluster of palms.
  The last word&mdash;farewell&mdash;floated past Ben-Hur weighted with all the
  sweet sorrow of parting. The passing of the boat was as the passing of a
  deeper shadow into the deeper night.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur drew a long breath hardly distinguishable from a sigh.</p>

  <p>"I know her by the song&mdash;the daughter of Balthasar. How beautiful it
  was! And how beautiful is she!"</p>

  <p>He recalled her large eyes curtained slightly by the drooping lids, the
  cheeks oval and rosy rich, the lips full and deep with dimpling in the
  corners, and all the grace of the tall lithe figure.</p>

  <p>"How beautiful she is!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>And his heart made answer by a quickening of its movement.</p>

  <p>Then, almost the same instant, another face, younger and quite as
  beautiful&mdash;more childlike and tender, if not so
  passionate&mdash;appeared as if held up to him out of the lake.</p>

  <p>"Esther!" he said, smiling. "As I wished, a star has been sent to me."</p>

  <p>He turned, and passed slowly back to the tent.</p>

  <p>His life had been crowded with griefs and with vengeful
  preparations&mdash;too much crowded for love. Was this the beginning of a
  happy change?</p>

  <p>And if the influence went with him into the tent, whose was it? Esther had
  given him a cup. So had the Egyptian. And both had come to him at the same
  time under the palms.</p>

  <p>Which?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch501"
     name="ch501"></a>I. &mdash; MESSALA DOFFS HIS CHAPLET</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning after the bacchanalia in the saloon of the
  palace, the divan was covered with young patricians. Maxentius might come,
  and the city throng to receive him; the legion might descend from Mount
  Sulpius in glory of arms and armor; from Nymphaeum to Omphalus there might be
  ceremonial splendors to shame the most notable ever before seen or heard of
  in the gorgeous East; yet would the many continue to sleep ignominiously on
  the divan where they had fallen or been carelessly tumbled by the indifferent
  slaves; that they would be able to take part in the reception that day was
  about as possible as for the lay-figures in the studio of a modern artist to
  rise and go bonneted and plumed through the one, two, three of a waltz.</p>

  <p>Not all, however, who participated in the orgy were in the shameful
  condition. When dawn began to peer through the skylights of the saloon,
  Messala arose, and took the chaplet from his head, in sign that the revel was
  at end; then he gathered his robe about him, gave a last look at the scene,
  and, without a word, departed for his quarters. Cicero could not have retired
  with more gravity from a night-long senatorial debate.</p>

  <p>Three hours afterwards two couriers entered his room, and from his own
  hand received each a despatch, sealed and in duplicate, and consisting
  chiefly of a letter to Valerius Gratus, the procurator, still resident in
  Caesarea. The importance attached to the speedy and certain delivery of the
  paper may be inferred. One courier was to proceed overland, the other by sea;
  both were to make the utmost haste.</p>

  <p>It is of great concern now that the reader should be fully informed of the
  contents of the letter thus forwarded, and it is accordingly given:</p>

  <p class="letter">"ANTIOCH, XII. Kal. Jul.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Messala to Gratus.</p>

  <p class="letter">"O my Midas!</p>

  <p class="letter">"I pray thou take no offense at the address, seeing it is
  one of love and gratitude, and an admission that thou art most fortunate
  among men; seeing, also, that thy ears are as they were derived from thy
  mother, only proportionate to thy matured condition.</p>

  <p class="letter">"O my Midas!</p>

  <p class="letter">"I have to relate to thee an astonishing event, which,
  though as yet somewhat in the field of conjecture, will, I doubt not, justify
  thy instant consideration.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Allow me first to revive thy recollection. Remember, a
  good many years ago, a family of a prince of Jerusalem, incredibly ancient
  and vastly rich&mdash;by name Ben-Hur. If thy memory have a limp or ailment
  of any kind, there is, if I mistake not, a wound on thy head which may help
  thee to a revival of the circumstance.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Next, to arouse thy interest. In punishment of the attempt
  upon thy life&mdash;for dear repose of conscience, may all the gods forbid it
  should ever prove to have been an accident!&mdash;the family were seized and
  summarily disposed of, and their property confiscated. And inasmuch, O my
  Midas! as the action had the approval of our Caesar, who was as just as he
  was wise&mdash;be there flowers upon his altars forever!&mdash;there should
  be no shame in referring to the sums which were realized to us respectively
  from that source, for which it is not possible I can ever cease to be
  grateful to thee, certainly not while I continue, as at present, in the
  uninterrupted enjoyment of the part which fell to me.</p>

  <p class="letter">"In vindication of thy wisdom&mdash;a quality for which, as
  I am now advised, the son of Gordius, to whom I have boldly likened thee, was
  never distinguished among men or gods&mdash;I recall further that thou didst
  make disposition of the family of Hur, both of us at the time supposing the
  plan hit upon to be the most effective possible for the purposes in view,
  which were silence and delivery over to inevitable but natural death. Thou
  wilt remember what thou didst with the mother and sister of the malefactor;
  yet, if now I yield to a desire to learn whether they be living or dead, I
  know, from knowing the amiability of thy nature, O my Gratus, that thou wilt
  pardon me as one scarcely less amiable than thyself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"As more immediately essential to the present business,
  however, I take the liberty of inviting to thy remembrance that the actual
  criminal was sent to the galleys a slave for life&mdash;so the precept ran;
  and it may serve to make the event which I am about to relate the more
  astonishing by saying here that I saw and read the receipt for his body
  delivered in course to the tribune commanding a galley.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Thou mayst begin now to give me more especial heed, O my
  most excellent Phrygian!</p>

  <p class="letter">"Referring to the limit of life at the oar, the outlaw thus
  justly disposed of should be dead, or, better speaking, some one of the three
  thousand Oceanides should have taken him to husband at least five years ago.
  And if thou wilt excuse a momentary weakness, O most virtuous and tender of
  men! inasmuch as I loved him in childhood, and also because he was very
  handsome&mdash;I used in much admiration to call him my Ganymede&mdash;he
  ought in right to have fallen into the arms of the most beautiful daughter of
  the family. Of opinion, however, that he was certainly dead, I have lived
  quite five years in calm and innocent enjoyment of the fortune for which I am
  in a degree indebted to him. I make the admission of indebtedness without
  intending it to diminish my obligation to thee.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Now I am at the very point of interest.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Last night, while acting as master of the feast for a
  party just from Rome&mdash;their extreme youth and inexperience appealed to
  my compassion&mdash;I heard a singular story. Maxentius, the consul, as you
  know, comes to-day to conduct a campaign against the Parthians. Of the
  ambitious who are to accompany him there is one, a son of the late duumvir
  Quintus Arrius. I had occasion to inquire about him particularly. When Arrius
  set out in pursuit of the pirates, whose defeat gained him his final honors,
  he had no family; when he returned from the expedition, he brought back with
  him an heir. Now be thou composed as becomes the owner of so many talents in
  ready sestertii! The son and heir of whom I speak is he whom thou didst send
  to the galleys&mdash;the very Ben-Hur who should have died at his oar five
  years ago&mdash;returned now with fortune and rank, and possibly as a Roman
  citizen, to&mdash; Well, thou art too firmly seated to be alarmed, but I, O
  my Midas! I am in danger&mdash;no need to tell thee of what. Who should know,
  if thou dost not?</p>

  <p class="letter">"Sayst thou to all this, tut-tut?</p>

  <p class="letter">"When Arrius, the father, by adoption, of this apparition
  from the arms of the most beautiful of the Oceanides (see above my opinion of
  what she should be), joined battle with the pirates, his vessel was sunk, and
  but two of all her crew escaped drowning&mdash;Arrius himself and this one,
  his heir.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The officers who took them from the plank on which they
  were floating say the associate of the fortunate tribune was a young man who,
  when lifted to the deck, was in the dress of a galley slave.</p>

  <p class="letter">"This should be convincing, to say least; but lest thou say
  tut-tut again, I tell thee, O my Midas! that yesterday, by good
  chance&mdash;I have a vow to Fortune in consequence&mdash;I met the
  mysterious son of Arrius face to face; and I declare now that, though I did
  not then recognize him, he is the very Ben-Hur who was for years my playmate;
  the very Ben-Hur who, if he be a man, though of the commonest grade, must
  this very moment of my writing be thinking of vengeance&mdash;for so would I
  were I he&mdash;vengeance not to be satisfied short of life; vengeance for
  country, mother, sister, self, and&mdash;I say it last, though thou mayst
  think it would be first&mdash;for fortune lost.</p>

  <p class="letter">"By this time, O good my benefactor and friend! my Gratus!
  in consideration of thy sestertii in peril, their loss being the worst which
  could befall one of thy high estate&mdash;I quit calling thee after the
  foolish old King of Phrygia&mdash;by this time, I say (meaning after having
  read me so far), I have faith to believe thou hast ceased saying tut-tut, and
  art ready to think what ought to be done in such emergency.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It were vulgar to ask thee now what shall be done. Rather
  let me say I am thy client; or, better yet, thou art my Ulysses whose part it
  is to give me sound direction.</p>

  <p class="letter">"And I please myself thinking I see thee when this letter
  is put into thy hand. I see thee read it once; thy countenance all gravity,
  and then again with a smile; then, hesitation ended, and thy judgment formed,
  it is this, or it is that; wisdom like Mercury's, promptitude like
  Caesar's.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The sun is now fairly risen. An hour hence two messengers
  will depart from my door, each with a sealed copy hereof; one of them will go
  by land, the other by sea, so important do I regard it that thou shouldst be
  early and particularly informed of the appearance of our enemy in this part
  of our Roman world.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I will await thy answer here.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Ben-Hur's going and coming will of course be regulated by
  his master, the consul, who, though he exert himself without rest day and
  night, cannot get away under a month. Thou knowest what work it is to
  assemble and provide for an army destined to operate in a desolate, townless
  country.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I saw the Jew yesterday in the Grove of Daphne; and if he
  be not there now, he is certainly in the neighborhood, making it easy for me
  to keep him in eye. Indeed, wert thou to ask me where he is now, I should
  say, with the most positive assurance, he is to be found at the old Orchard
  of Palms, under the tent of the traitor Sheik Ilderim, who cannot long escape
  our strong hand. Be not surprised if Maxentius, as his first measure, places
  the Arab on ship for forwarding to Rome.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am so particular about the whereabouts of the Jew
  because it will be important to thee, O illustrious! when thou comest to
  consider what is to be done; for already I know, and by the knowledge I
  flatter myself I am growing in wisdom, that in every scheme involving human
  action there are three elements always to be taken into account&mdash;time,
  place, and agency.</p>

  <p class="letter">"If thou sayest this is the place, have thou then no
  hesitancy in trusting the business to thy most loving friend, who would be
  thy aptest scholar as well.</p>

  <p class="letter">MESSALA."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch502"
     name="ch502"></a>II. &mdash; ILDERIM'S ARABS UNDER THE YOKE</h2>

  <p class="first">About the time the couriers departed from Messala's door
  with the despatches (it being yet the early morning hour), Ben-Hur entered
  Ilderim's tent. He had taken a plunge into the lake, and breakfasted, and
  appeared now in an under-tunic, sleeveless, and with skirt scarcely reaching
  to the knee.</p>

  <p>The sheik saluted him from the divan.</p>

  <p>"I give thee peace, son of Arrius," he said, with admiration, for, in
  truth, he had never seen a more perfect illustration of glowing, powerful,
  confident manhood. "I give thee peace and good-will. The horses are ready, I
  am ready. And thou?"</p>

  <p>"The peace thou givest me, good sheik, I give thee in return. I thank thee
  for so much good-will. I am ready."</p>

  <p>Ilderim clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>"I will have the horses brought. Be seated."</p>

  <p>"Are they yoked?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then suffer me to serve myself," said Ben-Hur. "It is needful that I make
  the acquaintance of thy Arabs. I must know them by name, O sheik, that I may
  speak to them singly; nor less must I know their temper, for they are like
  men: if bold, the better of scolding; if timid, the better of praise and
  flattery. Let the servants bring me the harness."</p>

  <p>"And the chariot?" asked the sheik.</p>

  <p>"I will let the chariot alone to-day. In its place, let them bring me a
  fifth horse, if thou hast it; he should be barebacked, and fleet as the
  others."</p>

  <p>Ilderim's wonder was aroused, and he summoned a servant immediately.</p>

  <p>"Bid them bring the harness for the four," he said&mdash;"the harness for
  the four, and the bridle for Sirius."</p>

  <p>Ilderim then arose.</p>

  <p>"Sirius is my love, and I am his, O son of Arrius. We have been comrades
  for twenty years&mdash;in tent, in battle, in all stages of the desert we
  have been comrades. I will show him to you."</p>

  <p>Going to the division curtain, he held it, while Ben-Hur passed under. The
  horses came to him in a body. One with a small head, luminous eyes, neck like
  the segment of a bended bow, and mighty chest, curtained thickly by a
  profusion of mane soft and wavy as a damsel's locks, nickered low and gladly
  at sight of him.</p>

  <p>"Good horse," said the sheik, patting the dark-brown cheek. "Good horse,
  good-morning." Turning then to Ben-Hur, he added, "This is Sirius, father of
  the four here. Mira, the mother, awaits our return, being too precious to be
  hazarded in a region where there is a stronger hand than mine. And much I
  doubt," he laughed as he spoke&mdash;"much I doubt, O son of Arrius, if the
  tribe could endure her absence. She is their glory; they worship her; did she
  gallop over them, they would laugh. Ten thousand horsemen, sons of the
  desert, will ask to-day, 'Have you heard of Mira?' And to the answer, 'She is
  well,' they will say, 'God is good! blessed be God!'"</p>

  <p>"Mira&mdash;Sirius&mdash;names of stars, are they not, O sheik?" asked
  Ben-Hur, going to each of the four, and to the sire, offering his hand.</p>

  <p>"And why not?" replied Ilderim. "Wert thou ever abroad on the desert at
  night?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then thou canst not know how much we Arabs depend upon the stars. We
  borrow their names in gratitude, and give them in love. My fathers all had
  their Miras, as I have mine; and these children are stars no less. There, see
  thou, is Rigel, and there Antares; that one is Atair, and he whom thou goest
  to now is Aldebaran, the youngest of the brood, but none the worse of
  that&mdash;no, not he! Against the wind he will carry thee till it roar in
  thy ears like Akaba; and he will go where thou sayest, son of
  Arrius&mdash;ay, by the glory of Solomon! he will take thee to the lion's
  jaws, if thou darest so much."</p>

  <p>The harness was brought. With his own hands Ben-Hur equipped the horses;
  with his own hands he led them out of the tent, and there attached the
  reins.</p>

  <p>"Bring me Sirius," he said.</p>

  <p>An Arab could not have better sprung to seat on the courser's back.</p>

  <p>"And now the reins."</p>

  <p>They were given him, and carefully separated.</p>

  <p>"Good sheik," he said, "I am ready. Let a guide go before me to the field,
  and send some of thy men with water."</p>

  <p>There was no trouble at starting. The horses were not afraid. Already
  there seemed a tacit understanding between them and the new driver, who had
  performed his part calmly, and with the confidence which always begets
  confidence. The order of going was precisely that of driving, except that
  Ben-Hur sat upon Sirius instead of standing in the chariot. Ilderim's spirit
  arose. He combed his beard, and smiled with satisfaction as he muttered, "He
  is not a Roman, no, by the splendor of God!" He followed on foot, the entire
  tenantry of the dowar&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;pouring after him,
  participants all in his solicitude, if not in his confidence.</p>

  <p>The field, when reached, proved ample and well fitted for the training,
  which Ben-Hur began immediately by driving the four at first slowly, and in
  perpendicular lines, and then in wide circles. Advancing a step in the
  course, he put them next into a trot; again progressing, he pushed into a
  gallop; at length he contracted the circles, and yet later drove
  eccentrically here and there, right, left, forward, and without a break. An
  hour was thus occupied. Slowing the gait to a walk, he drove up to
  Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"The work is done, nothing now but practice," he said. "I give you joy,
  Sheik Ilderim, that you have such servants as these. See," he continued,
  dismounting and going to the horses, "see, the gloss of their red coats is
  without spot; they breathe lightly as when I began. I give thee great joy,
  and it will go hard if"&mdash;he turned his flashing eyes upon the old man's
  face&mdash;"if we have not the victory and our&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, colored, bowed. At the sheik's side he observed, for the first
  time, Balthasar, leaning upon his staff, and two women closely veiled. At one
  of the latter he looked a second time, saying to himself, with a flutter
  about his heart, "'Tis she&mdash;'tis the Egyptian!" Ilderim picked up his
  broken sentence&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The victory, and our revenge!" Then he said aloud, "I am not afraid; I am
  glad. Son of Arrius, thou art the man. Be the end like the beginning, and
  thou shalt see of what stuff is the lining of the hand of an Arab who is able
  to give."</p>

  <p>"I thank thee, good sheik," Ben-Hur returned, modestly. "Let the servants
  bring drink for the horses."</p>

  <p>With his own hands he gave the water.</p>

  <p>Remounting Sirius, he renewed the training, going as before from walk to
  trot, from trot to gallop; finally, he pushed the steady racers into the run,
  gradually quickening it to full speed. The performance then became exciting;
  and there were applause for the dainty handling of the reins, and admiration
  for the four, which were the same, whether they flew forward or wheeled in
  varying curvature. In their action there were unity, power, grace, pleasure,
  all without effort or sign of labor. The admiration was unmixed with pity or
  reproach, which would have been as well bestowed upon swallows in their
  evening flight.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the exercises, and the attention they received from all
  the bystanders, Malluch came upon the ground, seeking the sheik.</p>

  <p>"I have a message for you, O sheik," he said, availing himself of a moment
  he supposed favorable for the speech&mdash;"a message from Simonides, the
  merchant."</p>

  <p>"Simonides!" ejaculated the Arab. "Ah! 'tis well. May Abaddon take all his
  enemies!"</p>

  <p>"He bade me give thee first the holy peace of God," Malluch continued;
  "and then this despatch, with prayer that thou read it the instant of
  receipt."</p>

  <p>Ilderim, standing in his place, broke the sealing of the package delivered
  to him, and from a wrapping of fine linen took two letters, which he
  proceeded to read.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">[No. 1.]</p>

  <p class="letter">"Simonides to Sheik Ilderim.</p>

  <p class="letter">"O friend!</p>

  <p class="letter">"Assure thyself first of a place in my inner heart.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Then&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"There is in thy dowar a youth of fair presence, calling
  himself the son of Arrius; and such he is by adoption.</p>

  <p class="letter">"He is very dear to me.</p>

  <p class="letter">"He hath a wonderful history, which I will tell thee; come
  thou to-day or to-morrow, that I may tell thee the history, and have thy
  counsel.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Meantime, favor all his requests, so they be not against
  honor. Should there be need of reparation, I am bound to thee for it.</p>

  <p class="letter">"That I have interest in this youth, keep thou private.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Remember me to thy other guest. He, his daughter, thyself,
  and all whom thou mayst choose to be of thy company, must depend upon me at
  the Circus the day of the games. I have seats already engaged.</p>

  <p class="letter">"To thee and all thine, peace.</p>

  <p class="letter">"What should I be, O my friend, but thy friend?</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Simonides</span>."</p><br>

  <p class="quote">[No. 2.]</p>

  <p class="letter">"Simonides to Sheik Ilderim.</p>

  <p class="letter">"O friend!</p>

  <p class="letter">"Out of the abundance of my experience, I send you a
  word.</p>

  <p class="letter">"There is a sign which all persons not Romans, and who have
  moneys or goods subject to despoilment, accept as warning&mdash;that is, the
  arrival at a seat of power of some high Roman official charged with
  authority.</p>

  <p class="letter">"To-day comes the Consul Maxentius.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Be thou warned!</p>

  <p class="letter">"Another word of advice.</p>

  <p class="letter">"A conspiracy, to be of effect against thee, O friend, must
  include the Herods as parties; thou hast great properties in their
  dominions.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Wherefore keep thou watch.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Send this morning to thy trusty keepers of the roads
  leading south from Antioch, and bid them search every courier going and
  coming; if they find private despatches relating to thee or thine affairs,
  THOU SHOULDST SEE THEM.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You should have received this yesterday, though it is not
  too late, if you act promptly.</p>

  <p class="letter">"If couriers left Antioch this morning, your messengers
  know the byways, and can get before them with your orders.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Do not hesitate.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Burn this after reading.</p>

  <p class="letter">"O my friend! thy friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Simonides</span>."</p><br>

  <p>Ilderim read the letters a second time, and refolded them in the linen
  wrap, and put the package under his girdle.</p>

  <p>The exercises in the field continued but a little longer&mdash;in all
  about two hours. At their conclusion, Ben-Hur brought the four to a walk, and
  drove to Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"With leave, O sheik," he said, "I will return thy Arabs to the tent, and
  bring them out again this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Ilderim walked to him as he sat on Sirius, and said, "I give them to you,
  son of Arrius, to do with as you will until after the games. You have done
  with them in two hours what the Roman&mdash;may jackals gnaw his bones
  fleshless!&mdash;could not in as many weeks. We will win&mdash;by the
  splendor of God, we will win!"</p>

  <p>At the tent Ben-Hur remained with the horses while they were being cared
  for; then, after a plunge in the lake and a cup of arrack with the sheik,
  whose flow of spirits was royally exuberant, he dressed himself in his Jewish
  garb again, and walked with Malluch on into the Orchard.</p>

  <p>There was much conversation between the two, not all of it important. One
  part, however, must not be overlooked. Ben-Hur was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I will give you," he said, "an order for my property stored in the khan
  this side the river by the Seleucian Bridge. Bring it to me to-day, if you
  can. And, good Malluch&mdash;if I do not overtask you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Malluch protested heartily his willingness to be of service.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Malluch, thank you," said Ben-Hur. "I will take you at your
  word, remembering that we are brethren of the old tribe, and that the enemy
  is a Roman. First, then&mdash;as you are a man of business, which I much fear
  Sheik Ilderim is not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Arabs seldom are," said Malluch, gravely.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I do not impeach their shrewdness, Malluch. It is well, however, to
  look after them. To save all forfeit or hindrance in connection with the
  race, you would put me perfectly at rest by going to the office of the
  Circus, and seeing that he has complied with every preliminary rule; and if
  you can get a copy of the rules, the service may be of great avail to me. I
  would like to know the colors I am to wear, and particularly the number of
  the crypt I am to occupy at the starting; if it be next Messala's on the
  right or left, it is well; if not, and you can have it changed so as to bring
  me next the Roman, do so. Have you good memory, Malluch?"</p>

  <p>"It has failed me, but never, son of Arrius, where the heart helped it as
  now."</p>

  <p>"I will venture, then, to charge you with one further service. I saw
  yesterday that Messala was proud of his chariot, as he might be, for the best
  of Caesar's scarcely surpass it. Can you not make its display an excuse which
  will enable you to find if it be light or heavy? I would like to have its
  exact weight and measurements&mdash;and, Malluch, though you fail in all
  else, bring me exactly the height his axle stands above the ground. You
  understand, Malluch? I do not wish him to have any actual advantage of me. I
  do not care for his splendor; if I beat him, it will make his fall the
  harder, and my triumph the more complete. If there are advantages really
  important, I want them."</p>

  <p>"I see, I see!" said Malluch. "A line dropped from the centre of the axle
  is what you want."</p>

  <p>"Thou hast it; and be glad, Malluch&mdash;it is the last of my
  commissions. Let us return to the dowar."</p>

  <p>At the door of the tent they found a servant replenishing the
  smoke-stained bottles of leben freshly made, and stopped to refresh
  themselves. Shortly afterwards Malluch returned to the city.</p>

  <p>During their absence, a messenger well mounted had been despatched with
  orders as suggested by Simonides. He was an Arab, and carried nothing
  written.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch503"
     name="ch503"></a>III. &mdash; THE ARTS OF CLEOPATRA</h2>

  <p class="first">"Iras, the daughter of Balthasar, sends me with salutation
  and a message," said a servant to Ben-Hur, who was taking his ease in the
  tent.</p>

  <p>"Give me the message."</p>

  <p>"Would it please you to accompany her upon the lake?"</p>

  <p>"I will carry the answer myself. Tell her so."</p>

  <p>His shoes were brought him, and in a few minutes Ben-Hur sallied out to
  find the fair Egyptian. The shadow of the mountains was creeping over the
  Orchard of Palms in advance of night. Afar through the trees came the
  tinkling of sheep bells, the lowing of cattle, and the voices of the herdsmen
  bringing their charges home. Life at the Orchard, it should be remembered,
  was in all respects as pastoral as life on the scantier meadows of the
  desert.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur and Iras.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Sheik Ilderim had witnessed the exercises of the afternoon, being a
  repetition of those of the morning; after which he had gone to the city in
  answer to the invitation of Simonides; he might return in the night; but,
  considering the immensity of the field to be talked over with his friend, it
  was hardly possible. Ben-Hur, thus left alone, had seen his horses cared for;
  cooled and purified himself in the lake; exchanged the field garb for his
  customary vestments, all white, as became a Sadducean of the pure blood;
  supped early; and, thanks to the strength of youth, was well recovered from
  the violent exertion he had undergone.</p>

  <p>It is neither wise nor honest to detract from beauty as a quality. There
  cannot be a refined soul insensible to its influence. The story of Pygmalion
  and his statue is as natural as it is poetical. Beauty is of itself a power;
  and it was now drawing Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian was to him a wonderfully beautiful woman&mdash;beautiful of
  face, beautiful of form. In his thought she always appeared to him as he saw
  her at the fountain; and he felt the influence of her voice, sweeter because
  in tearful expression of gratitude to him, and of her eyes&mdash;the large,
  soft, black, almond-shaped eyes declarative of her race&mdash;eyes which
  looked more than lies in the supremest wealth of words to utter; and
  recurrences of the thought of her were returns just so frequent of a figure
  tall, slender, graceful, refined, wrapped in rich and floating drapery,
  wanting nothing but a fitting mind to make her, like the Shulamite, and in
  the same sense, terrible as an army with banners. In other words, as she
  returned to his fancy, the whole passionate Song of Solomon came with her,
  inspired by her presence. With this sentiment and that feeling, he was going
  to see if she actually justified them. It was not love that was taking him,
  but admiration and curiosity, which might be the heralds of love.</p>

  <p>The landing was a simple affair, consisting of a short stairway, and a
  platform garnished by some lamp-posts; yet at the top of the steps he paused,
  arrested by what he beheld.</p>

  <p>There was a shallop resting upon the clear water lightly as an egg-shell.
  An Ethiop&mdash;the camel-driver at the Castalian fount&mdash;occupied the
  rower's place, his blackness intensified by a livery of shining white. All
  the boat aft was cushioned and carpeted with stuffs brilliant with Tyrian
  red. On the rudder seat sat the Egyptian herself, sunk in Indian shawls and a
  very vapor of most delicate veils and scarfs. Her arms were bare to the
  shoulders; and, not merely faultless in shape, they had the effect of
  compelling attention to them&mdash;their pose, their action, their
  expression; the hands, the fingers even, seemed endowed with graces and
  meaning; each was an object of beauty. The shoulders and neck were protected
  from the evening air by an ample scarf, which yet did not hide them.</p>

  <p>In the glance he gave her, Ben-Hur paid no attention to these details.
  There was simply an impression made upon him; and, like strong light, it was
  a sensation, not a thing of sight or enumeration. Thy lips are like a thread
  of scarlet; thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks.
  Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; for, lo! the winter is past,
  the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the
  singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the
  land&mdash;such was the impression she made upon him translated into
  words.</p>

  <p>"Come," she said, observing him stop, "come, or I shall think you a poor
  sailor."</p>

  <p>The red of his cheek deepened. Did she know anything of his life upon the
  sea? He descended to the platform at once.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid," he said, as he took the vacant seat before her.</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of sinking the boat," he replied, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Wait until we are in deeper water," she said, giving a signal to the
  black, who dipped the oars, and they were off.</p>

  <p>If love and Ben-Hur were enemies, the latter was never more at mercy. The
  Egyptian sat where he could not but see her; she, whom he had already
  engrossed in memory as his ideal of the Shulamite. With her eyes giving light
  to his, the stars might come out, and he not see them; and so they did. The
  night might fall with unrelieved darkness everywhere else; her look would
  make illumination for him. And then, as everybody knows, given youth and such
  companionship, there is no situation in which the fancy takes such complete
  control as upon tranquil waters under a calm night sky, warm with summer. It
  is so easy at such time to glide imperceptibly out of the commonplace into
  the ideal.</p>

  <p>"Give me the rudder," he said.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, "that were to reverse the relation. Did I not ask you
  to ride with me? I am indebted to you, and would begin payment. You may talk
  and I will listen, or I will talk and you will listen: that choice is yours;
  but it shall be mine to choose where we go, and the way thither."</p>

  <p>"And where may that be?"</p>

  <p>"You are alarmed again."</p>

  <p>"O fair Egyptian, I but asked you the first question of every
  captive."</p>

  <p>"Call me Egypt."</p>

  <p>"I would rather call you Iras."</p>

  <p>"You may think of me by that name, but call me Egypt."</p>

  <p>"Egypt is a country, and means many people."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! And such a country!"</p>

  <p>"I see; it is to Egypt we are going."</p>

  <p>"Would we were! I would be so glad."</p>

  <p>She sighed as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"You have no care for me, then," he said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, by that I know you were never there."</p>

  <p>"I never was."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is the land where there are no unhappy people, the desired of all
  the rest of the earth, the mother of all the gods, and therefore supremely
  blest. There, O son of Arrius, there the happy find increase of happiness,
  and the wretched, going, drink once of the sweet water of the sacred river,
  and laugh and sing, rejoicing like children."</p>

  <p>"Are not the very poor with you there as elsewhere?"</p>

  <p>"The very poor in Egypt are the very simple in wants and ways," she
  replied. "They have no wish beyond enough, and how little that is, a Greek or
  a Roman cannot know."</p>

  <p>"But I am neither Greek nor Roman."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have a garden of roses, and in the midst of it is a tree, and its bloom
  is the richest of all. Whence came it, think you?"</p>

  <p>"From Persia, the home of the rose."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"From India, then."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Ah! one of the isles of Greece."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she said: "a traveller found it perishing by the
  roadside on the plain of Rephaim."</p>

  <p>"Oh, in Judea!"</p>

  <p>"I put it in the earth left bare by the receding Nile, and the soft south
  wind blew over the desert and nursed it, and the sun kissed it in pity; after
  which it could not else than grow and flourish. I stand in its shade now, and
  it thanks me with much perfume. As with the roses, so with the men of Israel.
  Where shall they reach perfection but in Egypt?"</p>

  <p>"Moses was but one of millions."</p>

  <p>"Nay, there was a reader of dreams. Will you forget him?"</p>

  <p>"The friendly Pharaohs are dead."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes! The river by which they dwelt sings to them in their tombs; yet
  the same sun tempers the same air to the same people."</p>

  <p>"Alexandria is but a Roman town."</p>

  <p>"She has but exchanged sceptres. Caesar took from her that of the sword,
  and in its place left that of learning. Go with me to the Brucheium, and I
  will show you the college of nations; to the Serapeion, and see the
  perfection of architecture; to the Library, and read the immortals; to the
  theatre, and hear the heroics of the Greeks and Hindoos; to the quay, and
  count the triumphs of commerce; descend with me into the streets, O son of
  Arrius, and, when the philosophers have dispersed, and taken with them the
  masters of all the arts, and all the gods have home their votaries, and
  nothing remains of the day but its pleasures, you shall hear the stories that
  have amused men from the beginning, and the songs which will never, never
  die."</p>

  <p>As he listened, Ben-Hur was carried back to the night when, in the
  summer-house in Jerusalem, his mother, in much the same poetry of patriotism,
  declaimed the departed glories of Israel.</p>

  <p>"I see now why you wish to be called Egypt. Will you sing me a song if I
  call you by that name? I heard you last night."</p>

  <p>"That was a hymn of the Nile," she answered, "a lament which I sing when I
  would fancy I smell the breath of the desert, and hear the surge of the dear
  old river; let me rather give you a piece of the Indian mind. When we get to
  Alexandria, I will take you to the corner of the street where you can hear it
  from the daughter of the Ganga, who taught it to me. Kapila, you should know,
  was one of the most revered of the Hindoo sages."</p>

  <p>Then, as if it were a natural mode of expression, she began the song.</p>

  <h3>KAPILA.</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Kapila, Kapila, so young and true,<br>
  I yearn for a glory like thine,<br>
  And hail thee from battle to ask anew,<br>
  Can ever thy Valor be mine?</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Kapila sat on his charger dun,<br>
  A hero never so grave:<br>
  'Who loveth all things hath fear of none,<br>
  'Tis love that maketh me brave.<br>
  A woman gave me her soul one day,<br>
  The soul of my soul to be alway;<br>
  Thence came my Valor to me,<br>
  Go try it&mdash;try it&mdash;and see.'</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Kapila, Kapila, so old and gray,<br>
  The queen is calling for me;<br>
  But ere I go hence, I wish thou wouldst say,<br>
  How Wisdom first came to thee.</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Kapila stood in his temple door,<br>
  A priest in eremite guise:<br>
  'It did not come as men get their lore,<br>
  'Tis faith that maketh me wise.<br>
  A woman gave me her heart one day,<br>
  The heart of my heart to be alway;<br>
  Thence came my Wisdom to me,<br>
  Go try it&mdash;try it&mdash;and see.'"</p><br>

  <p>Ben-Hur had not time to express his thanks for the song before the keel of
  the boat grated upon the underlying sand, and, next moment, the bow ran upon
  the shore.</p>

  <p>"A quick voyage, O Egypt!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"And a briefer stay!" she replied, as, with a strong push, the black sent
  them shooting into the open water again.</p>

  <p>"You will give me the rudder now."</p>

  <p>"Oh no," said she, laughing. "To you, the chariot; to me, the boat. We are
  merely at the lake's end, and the lesson is that I must not sing any more.
  Having been to Egypt, let us now to the Grove of Daphne."</p>

  <p>"Without a song on the way?" he said, in deprecation.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something of the Roman from whom you saved us to-day," she
  asked.</p>

  <p>The request struck Ben-Hur unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I wish this were the Nile," he said, evasively. "The kings and queens,
  having slept so long, might come down from their tombs, and ride with
  us."</p>

  <p>"They were of the colossi, and would sink our boat. The pygmies would be
  preferable. But tell me of the Roman. He is very wicked, is he not?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"Is he of noble family, and rich?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot speak of his riches."</p>

  <p>"How beautiful his horses were! and the bed of his chariot was gold, and
  the wheels ivory. And his audacity! The bystanders laughed as he rode away;
  they, who were so nearly under his wheels!"</p>

  <p>She laughed at the recollection.</p>

  <p>"They were rabble," said Ben-Hur, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"He must be one of the monsters who are said to be growing up in
  Rome&mdash;Apollos ravenous as Cerberus. Does he reside in Antioch?"</p>

  <p>"He is of the East somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Egypt would suit him better than Syria."</p>

  <p>"Hardly," Ben-Hur replied. "Cleopatra is dead."</p>

  <p>That instant the lamps burning before the door of the tent came into
  view.</p>

  <p>"The dowar!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Ah, then, we have not been to Egypt. I have not seen Karnak or Philae or
  Abydos. This is not the Nile. I have but heard a song of India, and been
  boating in a dream."</p>

  <p>"Philae&mdash;Karnak. Mourn rather that you have not seen the Rameses at
  Aboo Simbel, looking at which makes it so easy to think of God, the maker of
  the heavens and earth. Or why should you mourn at all? Let us go on to the
  river; and if I cannot sing"&mdash;she laughed&mdash;"because I have said I
  would not, yet I can tell you stories of Egypt."</p>

  <p>"Go on! Ay, till morning comes, and the evening, and the next morning!" he
  said, vehemently.</p>

  <p>"Of what shall my stories be? Of the mathematicians?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no."</p>

  <p>"Of the philosophers?"</p>

  <p>"No, no."</p>

  <p>"Of the magicians and genii?"</p>

  <p>"If you will."</p>

  <p>"Of war?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Of love?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a cure for love. It is the story of a queen. Listen
  reverently. The papyrus from which it was taken by the priests of Philae was
  wrested from the hand of the heroine herself. It is correct in form, and must
  be true:</p><br>

  <h3>NE-NE-HOFRA.</h3>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"There is no parallelism in human lives.</p>

  <p class="quote">"No life runs a straight line.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The most perfect life develops as a circle, and terminates
  in its beginning, making it impossible to say, This is the commencement, that
  the end.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Perfect lives are the treasures of God; of great days he
  wears them on the ring-finger of his heart hand."</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"Ne-ne-hofra dwelt in a house close by Essouan, yet closer
  to the first cataract&mdash;so close, indeed, that the sound of the eternal
  battle waged there between river and rocks was of the place a part.</p>

  <p class="quote">"She grew in beauty day by day, so that it was said of her,
  as of the poppies in her father's garden, What will she not be in the time of
  blooming?</p>

  <p class="quote">"Each year of her life was the beginning of a new song more
  delightful than any of those which went before.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Child was she of a marriage between the North, bounded by
  the sea, and the South, bounded by the desert beyond the Luna mountains; and
  one gave her its passion, the other its genius; so when they beheld her, both
  laughed, saying, not meanly, 'She is mine,' but generously, 'Ha, ha! she is
  ours.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"All excellences in nature contributed to her perfection and
  rejoiced in her presence. Did she come or go, the birds ruffled their wings
  in greeting; the unruly winds sank to cooling zephyrs; the white lotus rose
  from the water's depth to look at her; the solemn river loitered on its way;
  the palm-trees, nodding, shook all their plumes; and they seemed to say, this
  one, I gave her of my grace; that, I gave her of my brightness; the other, I
  gave her of my purity: and so each as it had a virtue to give.</p>

  <p class="quote">"At twelve, Ne-ne-hofra was the delight of Essouan; at
  sixteen, the fame of her beauty was universal; at twenty, there was never a
  day which did not bring to her door princes of the desert on swift camels,
  and lords of Egypt in gilded barges; and, going away disconsolate, they
  reported everywhere, 'I have seen her, and she is not a woman, but Athor
  herself.'"</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"Now of the three hundred and thirty successors of good King
  Menes, eighteen were Ethiopians, of whom Oraetes was one hundred and ten
  years old. He had reigned seventy-six years. Under him the people thrived,
  and the land groaned with fatness of plenty. He practised wisdom because,
  having seen so much, he knew what it was. He dwelt in Memphis, having there
  his principal palace, his arsenals, and his treasure-house. Frequently he
  went down to Butos to talk with Latona.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The wife of the good king died. Too old was she for perfect
  embalmment; yet he loved her, and mourned as the inconsolable; seeing which,
  a colchyte presumed one day to speak to him.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'O Oraetes, I am astonished that one so wise and great
  should not know how to cure a sorrow like this.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Tell me a cure,' said the king.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Three times the colchyte kissed the floor, and then he
  replied, knowing the dead could not hear him, 'At Essouan lives Ne-ne-hofra,
  beautiful as Athor the beautiful. Send for her. She has refused all the lords
  and princes, and I know not how many kings; but who can say no to
  Oraetes?'"</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"Ne-ne-hofra descended the Nile in a barge richer than any
  ever before seen, attended by an army in barges each but a little less fine.
  All Nubia and Egypt, and a myriad from Libya, and a host of Troglodytes, and
  not a few Macrobii from beyond the Mountains of the Moon, lined the tented
  shores to see the cortege pass, wafted by perfumed winds and golden oars.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Through a dromos of sphinxes and couchant double-winged
  lions she was borne, and set down before Oraetes sitting on a throne
  specially erected at the sculptured pylon of the palace. He raised her up,
  gave her place by his side, clasped the uraeus upon her arm, kissed her, and
  Ne-ne-hofra was queen of all queens.</p>

  <p class="quote">"That was not enough for the wise Oraetes; he wanted love,
  and a queen happy in his love. So he dealt with her tenderly, showing her his
  possessions, cities, palaces, people; his armies, his ships: and with his own
  hand he led her through his treasure-house, saying, 'O. Ne-ne-hofra! but kiss
  me in love, and they are all thine.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"And, thinking she could be happy, if she was not then, she
  kissed him once, twice, thrice&mdash;kissed him thrice, his hundred and ten
  years notwithstanding.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The first year she was happy, and it was very short; the
  third year she was wretched, and it was very long; then she was enlightened:
  that which she thought love of Oraetes was only daze of his power. Well for
  her had the daze endured! Her spirits deserted her; she had long spells of
  tears, and her women could not remember when they heard her laugh; of the
  roses on her cheeks only ashes remained; she languished and faded gradually,
  but certainly. Some said she was haunted by the Erinnyes for cruelty to a
  lover; others, that she was stricken by some god envious of Oraetes. Whatever
  the cause of her decline, the charms of the magicians availed not to restore
  her, and the prescript of the doctor was equally without virtue. Ne-ne-hofra
  was given over to die.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Oraetes chose a crypt for her up in the tombs of the
  queens; and, calling the master sculptors and painters to Memphis, he set
  them to work upon designs more elaborate than any even in the great galleries
  of the dead kings.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'O thou beautiful as Athor herself, my queen!' said the
  king, whose hundred and thirteen years did not lessen his ardor as a lover,
  'Tell me, I pray, the ailment of which, alas! thou art so certainly perishing
  before my eyes.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'You will not love me any more if I tell you,' she said, in
  doubt and fear.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Not love you! I will love you the more. I swear it, by the
  genii of Amente! by the eye of Osiris, I swear it! Speak!' he cried,
  passionate as a lover, authoritative as a king.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Hear, then,' she said. 'There is an anchorite, the oldest
  and holiest of his class, in a cave near Essouan. His name is Menopha. He was
  my teacher and guardian. Send for him, O Oraetes, and he will tell you that
  you seek to know; he will also help you find the cure for my affliction.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Oraetes arose rejoicing. He went away in spirit a hundred
  years younger than when he came."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"'Speak!' said Oraetes to Menopha, in the palace at
  Memphis.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And Menopha replied, 'Most mighty king, if you were young,
  I should not answer, because I am yet pleased with life; as it is, I will say
  the queen, like any other mortal, is paying the penalty of a crime.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'A crime!' exclaimed Oraetes, angrily.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Menopha bowed very low.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Yes; to herself.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'I am not in mood for riddles,' said the king.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'What I say is not a riddle, as you shall hear. Ne-ne-
  hofra grew up under my eyes, and confided every incident of her life to me;
  among others, that she loved the son of her father's gardener, Barbec by
  name.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Oraetes's frown, strangely enough, began to dissipate.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'With that love in her heart, O king, she came to you; of
  that love she is dying.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Where is the gardener's son now?' asked Oraetes.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'In Essouan.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"The king went out and gave two orders. To one oeris he
  said, 'Go to Essouan and bring hither a youth named Barbec. You will find him
  in the garden of the queen's father;' to another, 'Assemble workmen and
  cattle and tools, and construct for me in Lake Chemmis an island, which,
  though laden with a temple, a palace, and a garden, and all manner of trees
  bearing fruit, and all manner of vines, shall nevertheless float about as the
  winds may blow it. Make the island, and let it be fully furnished by the time
  the moon begins to wane.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then to the queen he said,</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Be of cheer. I know all, and have sent for Barbec.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Ne-ne-hofra kissed his hands.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'You shall have him to yourself, and he you to himself; nor
  shall any disturb your loves for a year.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"She kissed his feet; he raised her, and kissed her in
  return; and the rose came back to her cheek, the scarlet to her lips, and the
  laughter to her heart."</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"For one year Ne-ne-hofra and Barbec the gardener floated as
  the winds blew on the island of Chemmis, which became one of the wonders of
  the world; never a home of love more beautiful; one year, seeing no one and
  existing for no one but themselves. Then she returned in state to the palace
  in Memphis.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Now whom lovest thou best?' asked the king.</p>

  <p class="quote">"She kissed his cheek and said, 'Take me back, O good king,
  for I am cured.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Oraetes laughed, none the worse, that moment, of his
  hundred and fourteen years.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Then it is true, as Menopha said: ha, ha, ha! it is true,
  the cure of love is love.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Even so,' she replied.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Suddenly his manner changed, and his look became
  terrible.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'I did not find it so,' he said.</p>

  <p class="quote">"She shrank affrighted.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Thou guilty!' he continued. 'Thy offense to Oraetes the
  man he forgives; but thy offence to Oraetes the king remains to be
  punished.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"She cast herself at his feet.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Hush!' he cried. 'Thou art dead!'</p>

  <p class="quote">"He clapped his hands, and a terrible procession came
  in&mdash;a procession of parachistes, or embalmers, each with some implement
  or material of his loathsome art.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The King pointed to Ne-ne-hofra.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'She is dead. Do thy work well.'"</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"Ne-ne-hofra the beautiful, after seventy-two days, was
  carried to the crypt chosen for her the year before, and laid with her
  queenly predecessors; yet there was no funeral procession in her honor across
  the sacred lake."</p><br>

  <p>At the conclusion of the story, Ben-Hur was sitting at the Egyptian's
  feet, and her hand upon the tiller was covered by his hand.</p>

  <p>"Menopha was wrong," he said.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Love lives by loving."</p>

  <p>"Then there is no cure for it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Oraetes found the cure."</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Death."</p>

  <p>"You are a good listener, O son of Arrius."</p>

  <p>And so with conversation and stories, they whiled the hours away. As they
  stepped ashore, she said,</p>

  <p>"To-morrow we go to the city."</p>

  <p>"But you will be at the games?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>"I will send you my colors."</p>

  <p>With that they separated.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch504"
     name="ch504"></a>IV. &mdash; MESSALA ON GUARD</h2>

  <p class="first">Ilderim returned to the dowar next day about the third hour.
  As he dismounted, a man whom he recognized as of his own tribe came to him
  and said, "O sheik, I was bidden give thee this package, with request that
  thou read it at once. If there be answer, I was to wait thy pleasure."</p>

  <p>Ilderim gave the package immediate attention. The seal was already broken.
  The address ran, <span class="smcap">To Valerius Gratus at
  Caesarea</span>.</p>

  <p>"Abaddon take him!" growled the sheik, at discovering a letter in
  Latin.</p>

  <p>Had the missive been in Greek or Arabic, he could have read it; as it was,
  the utmost he could make out was the signature in bold Roman
  letters&mdash;<span class="smcap">Messala</span>&mdash;whereat his eyes
  twinkled.</p>

  <p>"Where is the young Jew?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In the field with the horses," a servant replied.</p>

  <p>The sheik replaced the papyrus in its envelopes, and, tucking the package
  under his girdle, remounted the horse. That moment a stranger made his
  appearance, coming, apparently, from the city.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for Sheik Ilderim, surnamed the Generous," the stranger
  said.</p>

  <p>His language and attire bespoke him a Roman.</p>

  <p>What he could not read, he yet could speak; so the old Arab answered, with
  dignity, "I am Sheik Ilderim."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes fell; he raised them again, and said, with forced
  composure, "I heard you had need of a driver for the games."</p>

  <p>Ilderim's lip under the white mustache curled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Go thy way," he said. "I have a driver."</p>

  <p>He turned to ride away, but the man, lingering, spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Sheik, I am a lover of horses, and they say you have the most beautiful
  in the world."</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur and Iras.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The old man was touched; he drew rein, as if on the point of yielding to
  the flattery, but finally replied, "Not to-day, not to-day; some other time I
  will show them to you. I am too busy just now."</p>

  <p>He rode to the field, while the stranger betook himself to town again with
  a smiling countenance. He had accomplished his mission.</p>

  <p>And every day thereafter, down to the great day of the games, a
  man&mdash;sometimes two or three men&mdash;came to the sheik at the Orchard,
  pretending to seek an engagement as driver.</p>

  <p>In such manner Messala kept watch over Ben-Hur.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch505"
     name="ch505"></a>V. &mdash; ILDERIM AND BEN-HUR DELIBERATE</h2>

  <p class="first">The sheik waited, well satisfied, until Ben-Hur drew his
  horses off the field for the forenoon&mdash;well satisfied, for he had seen
  them, after being put through all the other paces, run full speed in such
  manner that it did not seem there were one the slowest and another the
  fastest&mdash;run in other words, as if the four were one.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon, O sheik, I will give Sirius back to you." Ben-Hur patted
  the neck of the old horse as he spoke. "I will give him back, and take to the
  chariot."</p>

  <p>"So soon?" Ilderim asked.</p>

  <p>"With such as these, good sheik, one day suffices. They are not afraid;
  they have a man's intelligence, and they love the exercise. This one," he
  shook a rein over the back of the youngest of the four&mdash;"you called him
  Aldebaran, I believe&mdash;is the swiftest; in once round a stadium he would
  lead the others thrice his length."</p>

  <p>Ilderim pulled his beard, and said, with twinkling eyes, "Aldebaran is the
  swiftest; but what of the slowest?"</p>

  <p>"This is he." Ben-Hur shook the rein over Antares. "This is he: but he
  will win, for, look you, sheik, he will run his utmost all day&mdash;all day;
  and, as the sun goes down, he will reach his swiftest."</p>

  <p>"Right again," said Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"I have but one fear, O sheik."</p>

  <p>The sheik became doubly serious.</p>

  <p>"In his greed of triumph, a Roman cannot keep honor pure. In the
  games&mdash;all of them, mark you&mdash;their tricks are infinite; in chariot
  racing their knavery extends to everything&mdash;from horse to driver, from
  driver to master. Wherefore, good sheik, look well to all thou hast; from
  this till the trial is over, let no stranger so much as see the horses. Would
  you be perfectly safe, do more&mdash;keep watch over them with armed hand as
  well as sleepless eye; then I will have no fear of the end."</p>

  <p>At the door of the tent they dismounted.</p>

  <p>"What you say shall be attended to. By the splendor of God, no hand shall
  come near them except it belong to one of the faithful. To-night I will set
  watches. But, son of Arrius"&mdash;Ilderim drew forth the package, and opened
  it slowly, while they walked to the divan and seated themselves&mdash;"son of
  Arrius, see thou here, and help me with thy Latin."</p>

  <p>He passed the despatch to Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"There; read&mdash;and read aloud, rendering what thou findest into the
  tongue of thy fathers. Latin is an abomination."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was in good spirits, and began the reading carelessly.
  "<span class="smcap">'Messala to Gratus!'</span>" He paused. A premonition
  drove the blood to his heart. Ilderim observed his agitation.</p>

  <p>"Well; I am waiting."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur prayed pardon, and recommenced the paper, which, it is sufficient
  to say, was one of the duplicates of the letter despatched so carefully to
  Gratus by Messala the morning after the revel in the palace.</p>

  <p>The paragraphs in the beginning were remarkable only as proof that the
  writer had not outgrown his habit of mockery; when they were passed, and the
  reader came to the parts intended to refresh the memory of Gratus, his voice
  trembled, and twice he stopped to regain his self-control. By a strong effort
  he continued. "'I recall further,'" he read, "'that thou didst make
  disposition of the family of Hur'"&mdash;there the reader again paused and
  drew a long breath&mdash;"'both of us at the time supposing the plan hit upon
  to be the most effective possible for the purposes in view, which were
  silence and delivery over to inevitable but natural death.'"</p>

  <p>Here Ben-Hur broke down utterly. The paper fell from his hands, and he
  covered his face.</p>

  <p>"They are dead&mdash;dead. I alone am left."</p>

  <p>The sheik had been a silent, but not unsympathetic, witness of the young
  man's suffering; now he arose and said, "Son of Arrius, it is for me to beg
  thy pardon. Read the paper by thyself. When thou art strong enough to give
  the rest of it to me, send word, and I will return."</p>

  <p>He went out of the tent, and nothing in all his life became him
  better.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur flung himself on the divan and gave way to his feelings. When
  somewhat recovered, he recollected that a portion of the letter remained
  unread, and, taking it up, he resumed the reading. "Thou wilt remember," the
  missive ran, "what thou didst with the mother and sister of the malefactor;
  yet, if now I yield to a desire to learn if they be living or
  dead"&mdash;Ben-Hur started, and read again, and then again, and at last
  broke into exclamation. "He does not know they are dead; he does not know it!
  Blessed be the name of the Lord! there is yet hope." He finished the
  sentence, and was strengthened by it, and went on bravely to the end of the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"They are not dead," he said, after reflection; "they are not dead, or he
  would have heard of it."</p>

  <p>A second reading, more careful than the first, confirmed him in the
  opinion. Then he sent for the sheik.</p>

  <p>"In coming to your hospitable tent, O sheik," he said, calmly, when the
  Arab was seated and they were alone, "it was not in my mind to speak of
  myself further than to assure you I had sufficient training to be intrusted
  with your horses. I declined to tell you my history. But the chances which
  have sent this paper to my hand and given it to me to be read are so strange
  that I feel bidden to trust you with everything. And I am the more inclined
  to do so by knowledge here conveyed that we are both of us threatened by the
  same enemy, against whom it is needful that we make common cause. I will read
  the letter and give you explanation; after which you will not wonder I was so
  moved. If you thought me weak or childish, you will then excuse me."</p>

  <p>The sheik held his peace, listening closely, until Ben-Hur came to the
  paragraph in which he was particularly mentioned: "'I saw the Jew yesterday
  in the Grove of Daphne;'" so ran the part, "'and if he be not there now, he
  is certainly in the neighborhood, making it easy for me to keep him in eye.
  Indeed, wert thou to ask me where he is now, I should say, with the most
  positive assurance, he is to be found at the old Orchard of Palms.'"</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;h!" exclaimed Ilderim, in such a tone one might hardly say he was
  more surprised than angry; at the same time, he clutched his beard.</p>

  <p>"'At the old Orchard of Palms,'" Ben-Hur repeated, "'under the tent of the
  traitor Shiek Ilderim.'"</p>

  <p>"Traitor!&mdash;I?" the old man cried, in his shrillest tone, while lip
  and beard curled with ire, and on his forehead and neck the veins swelled and
  beat as they would burst.</p>

  <p>"Yet a moment, sheik," said Ben-Hur, with a deprecatory gesture. "Such is
  Messala's opinion of you. Hear his threat." And he read on&mdash;"'under the
  tent of the traitor Sheik Ilderim, who cannot long escape our strong hand. Be
  not surprised if Maxentius, as his first measure, places the Arab on ship for
  forwarding to Rome.'"</p>

  <p>"To Rome! Me&mdash;Ilderim&mdash;sheik of ten thousand horsemen with
  spears&mdash;me to Rome!"</p>

  <p>He leaped rather than rose to his feet, his arms outstretched, his fingers
  spread and curved like claws, his eyes glittering like a serpent's.</p>

  <p>"O God!&mdash;nay, by all the gods except of Rome!&mdash;when shall this
  insolence end? A freeman am I; free are my people. Must we die slaves? Or,
  worse, must I live a dog, crawling to a master's feet? Must I lick his hand,
  lest he lash me? What is mine is not mine; I am not my own; for breath of
  body I must be beholden to a Roman. Oh, if I were young again! Oh, could I
  shake off twenty years&mdash;or ten&mdash;or five!"</p>

  <p>He ground his teeth and shook his hands overhead; then, under the impulse
  of another idea, he walked away and back again to Ben-Hur swiftly, and caught
  his shoulder with a strong grasp.</p>

  <p>"If I were as thou, son of Arrius&mdash;as young, as strong, as practised
  in arms; if I had a motive hissing me to revenge&mdash;a motive, like thine,
  great enough to make hate holy&mdash; Away with disguise on thy part and on
  mine! Son of Hur, son of Hur, I say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that name all the currents of Ben-Hur's blood stopped; surprised,
  bewildered, he gazed into the Arab's eyes, now close to his, and fiercely
  bright.</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur, I say, were I as thou, with half thy wrongs, bearing about
  with me memories like thine, I would not, I could not, rest." Never pausing,
  his words following each other torrent-like, the old man swept on. "To all my
  grievances, I would add those of the world, and devote myself to vengeance.
  From land to land I would go firing all mankind. No war for freedom but
  should find me engaged; no battle against Rome in which I would not bear a
  part. I would turn Parthian, if I could not better. If men failed me, still I
  would not give over the effort&mdash;ha, ha, ha! By the splendor of God! I
  would herd with wolves, and make friends of lions and tigers, in hope of
  marshalling them against the common enemy. I would use every weapon. So my
  victims were Romans, I would rejoice in slaughter. Quarter I would not ask;
  quarter I would not give. To the flames everything Roman; to the sword every
  Roman born. Of nights I would pray the gods, the good and the bad alike, to
  lend me their special terrors&mdash;tempests, drought, heat, cold, and all
  the nameless poisons they let loose in air, all the thousand things of which
  men die on sea and on land. Oh, I could not sleep. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sheik stopped for want of breath, panting, wringing his hands. And,
  sooth to say, of all the passionate burst Ben-Hur retained but a vague
  impression wrought by fiery eyes, a piercing voice, and a rage too intense
  for coherent expression.</p>

  <p>For the first time in years, the desolate youth heard himself addressed by
  his proper name. One man at least knew him, and acknowledged it without
  demand of identity; and he an Arab fresh from the desert!</p>

  <p>How came the man by his knowledge? The letter? No. It told the cruelties
  from which his family had suffered; it told the story of his own misfortunes,
  but it did not say he was the very victim whose escape from doom was the
  theme of the heartless narrative. That was the point of explanation he had
  notified the sheik would follow the reading of the letter. He was pleased,
  and thrilled with hope restored, yet kept an air of calmness.</p>

  <p>"Good sheik, tell me how you came by this letter."</p>

  <p>"My people keep the roads between cities," Ilderim answered, bluntly.
  "They took it from a courier."</p>

  <p>"Are they known to be thy people?"</p>

  <p>"No. To the world they are robbers, whom it is mine to catch and
  slay."</p>

  <p>"Again, sheik. You call me son of Hur&mdash;my father's name. I did not
  think myself known to a person on earth. How came you by the knowledge?"</p>

  <p>Ilderim hesitated; but, rallying, he answered, "I know you, yet I am not
  free to tell you more."</p>

  <p>"Some one holds you in restraint?"</p>

  <p>The sheik closed his mouth, and walked away; but, observing Ben-Hur's
  disappointment, he came back, and said, "Let us say no more about the matter
  now. I will go to town; when I return, I may talk to you fully. Give me the
  letter."</p>

  <p>Ilderim rolled the papyrus carefully, restored it to its envelopes, and
  became once more all energy.</p>

  <p>"What sayest thou?" he asked, while waiting for his horse and retinue. "I
  told what I would do, were I thou, and thou hast made no answer."</p>

  <p>"I intended to answer, sheik, and I will." Ben-Hur's countenance and voice
  changed with the feeling invoked. "All thou hast said, I will do&mdash;all at
  least in the power of a man. I devoted myself to vengeance long ago. Every
  hour of the five years passed, I have lived with no other thought. I have
  taken no respite. I have had no pleasures of youth. The blandishments of Rome
  were not for me. I wanted her to educate me for revenge. I resorted to her
  most famous masters and professors&mdash;not those of rhetoric or philosophy:
  alas! I had no time for them. The arts essential to a fighting-man were my
  desire. I associated with gladiators, and with winners of prizes in the
  Circus; and they were my teachers. The drill-masters in the great camp
  accepted me as a scholar, and were proud of my attainments in their line. O
  sheik, I am a soldier; but the things of which I dream require me to be a
  captain. With that thought, I have taken part in the campaign against the
  Parthians; when it is over, then, if the Lord spare my life and
  strength&mdash;then"&mdash;he raised his clenched hands, and spoke
  vehemently&mdash;"then I will be an enemy Roman-taught in all things; then
  Rome shall account to me in Roman lives for her ills. You have my answer,
  sheik."</p>

  <p>Ilderim put an arm over his shoulder, and kissed him, saying,
  passionately, "If thy God favor thee not, son of Hur, it is because he is
  dead. Take thou this from me&mdash;sworn to, if so thy preference run: thou
  shalt have my hands, and their fulness&mdash;men, horses, camels, and the
  desert for preparation. I swear it! For the present, enough. Thou shalt see
  or hear from me before night."</p>

  <p>Turning abruptly off, the sheik was speedily on the road to the city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch506"
     name="ch506"></a>VI. &mdash; TRAINING THE FOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">The intercepted letter was conclusive upon a number of
  points of great interest to Ben-Hur. It had all the effect of a confession
  that the writer was a party to the putting-away of the family with murderous
  intent; that he had sanctioned the plan adopted for the purpose; that he had
  received a portion of the proceeds of the confiscation, and was yet in
  enjoyment of his part; that he dreaded the unexpected appearance of what he
  was pleased to call the chief malefactor, and accepted it as a menace; that
  he contemplated such further action as would secure him in the future, and
  was ready to do whatever his accomplice in Caesarea might advise.</p>

  <p>And, now that the letter had reached the hand of him really its subject,
  it was notice of danger to come, as well as a confession of guilt. So when
  Ilderim left the tent, Ben-Hur had much to think about, requiring immediate
  action. His enemies were as adroit and powerful as any in the East. If they
  were afraid of him, he had greater reason to be afraid of them. He strove
  earnestly to reflect upon the situation, but could not; his feelings
  constantly overwhelmed him. There was a certain qualified pleasure in the
  assurance that his mother and sister were alive; and it mattered little that
  the foundation of the assurance was a mere inference. That there was one
  person who could tell him where they were seemed to his hope so long deferred
  as if discovery were now close at hand. These were mere causes of feeling;
  underlying them, it must be confessed he had a superstitious fancy that God
  was about to make ordination in his behalf, in which event faith whispered
  him to stand still.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, referring to the words of Ilderim, he wondered whence the
  Arab derived his information about him; not from Malluch certainly; nor from
  Simonides, whose interests, all adverse, would hold him dumb. Could Messala
  have been the informant? No, no: disclosure might be dangerous in that
  quarter. Conjecture was vain; at the same time, often as Ben-Hur was beaten
  back from the solution, he was consoled with the thought that whoever the
  person with the knowledge might be, he was a friend, and, being such, would
  reveal himself in good time. A little more waiting&mdash;a little more
  patience. Possibly the errand of the sheik was to see the worthy; possibly
  the letter might precipitate a full disclosure.</p>

  <p>And patient he would have been if only he could have believed Tirzah and
  his mother were waiting for him under circumstances permitting hope on their
  part strong as his; if, in other words, conscience had not stung him with
  accusations respecting them.</p>

  <p>To escape such accusations, he wandered far through the Orchard, pausing
  now where the date-gatherers were busy, yet not too busy to offer him of
  their fruit and talk with him; then, under the great trees, to watch the
  nesting birds, or hear the bees swarming about the berries bursting with
  honeyed sweetness, and filling all the green and golden spaces with the music
  of their beating wings.</p>

  <p>By the lake, however, he lingered longest. He might not look upon the
  water and its sparkling ripples, so like sensuous life, without thinking of
  the Egyptian and her marvellous beauty, and of floating with her here and
  there through the night, made brilliant by her songs and stories; he might
  not forget the charm of her manner, the lightness of her laugh, the flattery
  of her attention, the warmth of her little hand under his upon the tiller of
  the boat. From her it was for his thought but a short way to Balthasar, and
  the strange things of which he had been witness, unaccountable by any law of
  nature; and from him, again, to the King of the Jews, whom the good man, with
  such pathos of patience, was holding in holy promise, the distance was even
  nearer. And there his mind stayed, finding in the mysteries of that personage
  a satisfaction answering well for the rest he was seeking. Because, it may
  have been, nothing is so easy as denial of an idea not agreeable to our
  wishes, he rejected the definition given by Balthasar of the kingdom the king
  was coming to establish. A kingdom of souls, if not intolerable to his
  Sadducean faith, seemed to him but an abstraction drawn from the depths of a
  devotion too fond and dreamy. A kingdom of Judea, on the other hand, was more
  than comprehensible: such had been, and, if only for that reason, might be
  again. And it suited his pride to think of a new kingdom broader of domain,
  richer in power, and of a more unapproachable splendor than the old one; of a
  new king wiser and mightier than Solomon&mdash;a new king under whom,
  especially, he could find both service and revenge. In that mood he resumed
  to the dowar.</p>

  <p>The mid-day meal disposed of, still further to occupy himself, Ben-Hur had
  the chariot rolled out into the sunlight for inspection. The word but poorly
  conveys the careful study the vehicle underwent. No point or part of it
  escaped him. With a pleasure which will be better understood hereafter, he
  saw the pattern was Greek, in his judgment preferable to the Roman in many
  respects; it was wider between the wheels, and lower and stronger, and the
  disadvantage of greater weight would be more than compensated by the greater
  endurance of his Arabs. Speaking generally, the carriage-makers of Rome built
  for the games almost solely, sacrificing safety to beauty, and durability to
  grace; while the chariots of Achilles and "the king of men," designed for war
  and all its extreme tests, still ruled the tastes of those who met and
  struggled for the crowns Isthmian and Olympic.</p>

  <p>Next he brought the horses, and, hitching them to the chariot, drove to
  the field of exercise, where, hour after hour, he practised them in movement
  under the yoke. When he came away in the evening, it was with restored
  spirit, and a fixed purpose to defer action in the matter of Messala until
  the race was won or lost. He could not forego the pleasure of meeting his
  adversary under the eyes of the East; that there might be other competitors
  seemed not to enter his thought. His confidence in the result was absolute;
  no doubt of his own skill; and as to the four, they were his full partners in
  the glorious game.</p>

  <p>"Let him look to it, let him look to it! Ha, Antares&mdash;Aldebaran!
  Shall he not, O honest Rigel? and thou, Atair, king among coursers, shall he
  not beware of us? Ha, ha! good hearts!"</p>

  <p>So in rests he passed from horse to horse, speaking, not as a master, but
  the senior of as many brethren.</p>

  <p>After nightfall, Ben-Hur sat by the door of the tent waiting for Ilderim,
  not yet returned from the city. He was not impatient, or vexed, or doubtful.
  The sheik would be heard from, at least. Indeed, whether it was from
  satisfaction with the performance of the four, or the refreshment there is in
  cold water succeeding bodily exercise, or supper partaken with royal
  appetite, or the reaction which, as a kindly provision of nature, always
  follows depression, the young man was in good-humor verging upon elation. He
  felt himself in the hands of Providence no longer his enemy. At last there
  was a sound of horse's feet coming rapidly, and Malluch rode up.</p>

  <p>"Son of Arrius," he said, cheerily, after salutation, "I salute you for
  Sheik Ilderim, who requests you to mount and go to the city. He is waiting
  for you."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur asked no questions, but went in where the horses were feeding.
  Aldebaran came to him, as if offering his service. He played with him
  lovingly, but passed on, and chose another, not of the four&mdash;they were
  sacred to the race. Very shortly the two were on the road, going swiftly and
  in silence.</p>

  <p>Some distance below the Seleucian Bridge, they crossed the river by a
  ferry, and, riding far round on the right bank, and recrossing by another
  ferry, entered the city from the west. The detour was long, but Ben-Hur
  accepted it as a precaution for which there was good reason.</p>

  <p>Down to Simonides' landing they rode, and in front of the great warehouse,
  under the bridge, Malluch drew rein.</p>

  <p>"We are come," he said. "Dismount."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur recognized the place.</p>

  <p>"Where is the sheik?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Come with me. I will show you."</p>

  <p>A watchman took the horses, and almost before he realized it Ben-Hur stood
  once more at the door of the house up on the greater one, listening to the
  response from within&mdash;"In God's name, enter."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch507"
     name="ch507"></a>VII. &mdash; SIMONIDES RENDERS ACCOUNT</h2>

  <p class="first">Malluch stopped at the door; Ben-Hur entered alone.</p>

  <p>The room was the same in which he had formerly interviewed Simonides, and
  it had been in nowise changed, except now, close by the arm-chair, a polished
  brazen rod, set on a broad wooden pedestal, arose higher than a tall man,
  holding lamps of silver on sliding arms, half-a-dozen or more in number, and
  all burning. The light was clear, bringing into view the panelling on the
  walls, the cornice with its row of gilded balls, and the dome dully tinted
  with violet mica.</p>

  <p>Within a few steps, Ben-Hur stopped.</p>

  <p>Three persons were present, looking at him&mdash;Simonides, Ilderim, and
  Esther.</p>

  <p>He glanced hurriedly from one to another, as if to find answer to the
  question half formed in his mind, What business can these have with me? He
  became calm, with every sense on the alert, for the question was succeeded by
  another, Are they friends or enemies?</p>

  <p>At length, his eyes rested upon Esther.</p>

  <p>The men returned his look kindly; in her face there was something more
  than kindness&mdash;something too <i>spirituel</i> for definition, which yet
  went to his inner consciousness without definition.</p>

  <p>Shall it be said, good reader? Back of his gaze there was a comparison in
  which the Egyptian arose and set herself over against the gentle Jewess; but
  it lived an instant, and, as is the habit of such comparisons, passed away
  without a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The guest turned to the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur," said Simonides, repeating the address slowly, and with
  distinct emphasis, as if to impress all its meaning upon him most interested
  in understanding it, "take thou the peace of the Lord God of our
  fathers&mdash;take it from me." He paused, then added, "From me and
  mine."</p>

  <p>The speaker sat in his chair; there were the royal head, the bloodless
  face, the masterful air, under the influence of which visitors forgot the
  broken limbs and distorted body of the man. The full black eyes gazed out
  under the white brows steadily, but not sternly. A moment thus, then he
  crossed his hands upon his breast.</p>

  <p>The action, taken with the salutation, could not be misunderstood, and was
  not.</p>

  <p>"Simonides," Ben-Hur answered, much moved, "the holy peace you tender is
  accepted. As son to father, I return it to you. Only let there be perfect
  understanding between us."</p>

  <p>Thus delicately he sought to put aside the submission of the merchant,
  and, in place of the relation of master and servant, substitute one higher
  and holier.</p>

  <p>Simonides let fall his hands, and, turning to Esther, said, "A seat for
  the master, daughter."</p>

  <p>She hastened, and brought a stool, and stood, with suffused face, looking
  from one to the other&mdash;from Ben-Hur to Simonides, from Simonides to
  Ben-Hur; and they waited, each declining the superiority direction would
  imply. When at length the pause began to be embarrassing, Ben-Hur advanced,
  and gently took the stool from her, and, going to the chair, placed it at the
  merchant's feet.</p>

  <p>"I will sit here," he said.</p>

  <p>His eyes met hers&mdash;an instant only; but both were better of the look.
  He recognized her gratitude, she his generosity and forbearance.</p>

  <p>Simonides bowed his acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"Esther, child, bring me the paper," he said, with a breath of relief.</p>

  <p>She went to a panel in the wall, opened it, took out a roll of papyri, and
  brought and gave it to him.</p>

  <p>"Thou saidst well, son of Hur," Simonides began, while unrolling the
  sheets. "Let us understand each other. In anticipation of the
  demand&mdash;which I would have made hadst thou waived it&mdash;I have here a
  statement covering everything necessary to the understanding required. I
  could see but two points involved&mdash;the property first, and then our
  relation. The statement is explicit as to both. Will it please thee to read
  it now?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur received the papers, but glanced at Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Simonides, "the sheik shall not deter thee from reading. The
  account&mdash;such thou wilt find it&mdash;is of a nature requiring a
  witness. In the attesting place at the end thou wilt find, when thou comest
  to it, the name&mdash;Ilderim, Sheik. He knows all. He is thy friend. All he
  has been to me, that will he be to thee also."</p>

  <p>Simonides looked at the Arab, nodding pleasantly, and the latter gravely
  returned the nod, saying, "Thou hast said."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur replied, "I know already the excellence of his friendship, and
  have yet to prove myself worthy of it." Immediately he continued, "Later, O
  Simonides, I will read the papers carefully; for the present, do thou take
  them, and if thou be not too weary, give me their substance."</p>

  <p>Simonides took back the roll.</p>

  <p>"Here, Esther, stand by me and receive the sheets, lest they fall into
  confusion."</p>

  <p>She took place by his chair, letting her right arm fall lightly across his
  shoulder, so, when he spoke, the account seemed to have rendition from both
  of them jointly.</p>

  <p>"This," said Simonides, drawing out the first leaf, "shows the money I had
  of thy father's, being the amount saved from the Romans; there was no
  property saved, only money, and that the robbers would have secured but for
  our Jewish custom of bills of exchange. The amount saved, being sums I drew
  from Rome, Alexandria, Damascus, Carthage, Valentia, and elsewhere within the
  circle of trade, was one hundred and twenty talents Jewish money."</p>

  <p>He gave the sheet to Esther, and took the next one.</p>

  <p>"With that amount&mdash;one hundred and twenty talents&mdash;I charged
  myself. Hear now my credits. I use the word, as thou wilt see, with reference
  rather to the proceeds gained from the use of the money."</p>

  <p>From separate sheets he then read footings, which, fractions omitted, were
  as follows:</p>
  <pre>
    "CR.

  By ships............................... 60 talents.
   " goods in store......................110   "
   " cargoes in transit.................. 75   "
   " camels, horses, etc................. 20   "
   " warehouses.......................... 10   "
   " bills due........................... 54   "
   " money on hand and subject to draft..224   "
                                         ---
  Total..................................553   "

</pre>

  <p>"To these now, to the five hundred and fifty-three talents gained, add the
  original capital I had from thy father, and thou hast SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
  THREE TALENTS!&mdash;and all thine&mdash;making thee, O son of Hur, the
  richest subject in the world."</p>

  <p>He took the papyri from Esther, and, reserving one, rolled them and
  offered them to Ben-Hur. The pride perceptible in his manner was not
  offensive; it might have been from a sense of duty well done; it might have
  been for Ben-Hur without reference to himself.</p>

  <p>"And there is nothing," he added, dropping his voice, but not his
  eyes&mdash;"there is nothing now thou mayst not do."</p>

  <p>The moment was one of absorbing interest to all present. Simonides crossed
  his hands upon his breast again; Esther was anxious; Ilderim nervous. A man
  is never so on trial as in the moment of excessive good-fortune.</p>

  <p>Taking the roll, Ben-Hur arose, struggling with emotion.</p>

  <p>"All this is to me as a light from heaven, sent to drive away a night
  which has been so long I feared it would never end, and so dark I had lost
  the hope of seeing," he said, with a husky voice. "I give first thanks to the
  Lord, who has not abandoned me, and my next to thee, O Simonides. Thy
  faithfulness outweighs the cruelty of others, and redeems our human nature.
  'There is nothing I cannot do:' be it so. Shall any man in this my hour of
  such mighty privilege be more generous than I? Serve me as a witness now,
  Sheik Ilderim. Hear thou my words as I shall speak them&mdash;hear and
  remember. And thou, Esther, good angel of this good man! hear thou also."</p>

  <p>He stretched his hand with the roll to Simonides.</p>

  <p>"The things these papers take into account&mdash;all of them: ships,
  houses, goods, camels, horses, money; the least as well as the
  greatest&mdash;give I back to thee, O Simonides, making them all thine, and
  sealing them to thee and thine forever."</p>

  <p>Esther smiled through her tears; Ilderim pulled his beard with rapid
  motion, his eyes glistening like beads of jet. Simonides alone was calm.</p>

  <p>"Sealing them to thee and thine forever," Ben-Hur continued, with better
  control of himself, "with one exception, and upon one condition."</p>

  <p>The breath of the listeners waited upon his words.</p>

  <p>"The hundred and twenty talents which were my father's thou shalt return
  to me."</p>

  <p>Ilderim's countenance brightened.</p>

  <p>"And thou shalt join me in search of my mother and sister, holding all
  thine subject to the expense of discovery, even as I will hold mine."</p>

  <p>Simonides was much affected. Stretching out his hand, he said, "I see thy
  spirit, son of Hur, and I am grateful to the Lord that he hath sent thee to
  me such as thou art. If I served well thy father in life, and his memory
  afterwards, be not afraid of default to thee; yet must I say the exception
  cannot stand."</p>

  <p>Exhibiting, then, the reserved sheet, he continued,</p>

  <p>"Thou hast not all the account. Take this and read&mdash;read aloud."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took the supplement, and read it.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Statement of the servants of Hur, rendered by Simonides,
  steward of the estate.<br>
  1. Amrah, Egyptian, keeping the palace in Jerusalem.<br>
  2. Simonides, the steward, in Antioch.<br>
  3. Esther, daughter of Simonides."</p><br>

  <p>Now, in all his thoughts of Simonides, not once had it entered Ben-Hur's
  mind that, by the law, a daughter followed the parent's condition. In all his
  visions of her, the sweet-faced Esther had figured as the rival of the
  Egyptian, and an object of possible love. He shrank from the revelation so
  suddenly brought him, and looked at her blushing; and, blushing, she dropped
  her eyes before him. Then he said, while the papyrus rolled itself
  together,</p>

  <p>"A man with six hundred talents is indeed rich, and may do what he
  pleases; but, rarer than the money, more priceless than the property, is the
  mind which amassed the wealth, and the heart it could not corrupt when
  amassed. O Simonides&mdash;and thou, fair Esther&mdash;fear not. Sheik
  Ilderim here shall be witness that in the same moment ye were declared my
  servants, that moment I declared ye free; and what I declare, that will I put
  in writing. Is it not enough? Can I do more?"</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur," said Simonides, "verily thou dost make servitude lightsome.
  I was wrong; there are some things thou canst not do; thou canst not make us
  free in law. I am thy servant forever, because I went to the door with thy
  father one day, and in my ear the awl-marks yet abide."</p>

  <p>"Did my father that?"</p>

  <p>"Judge him not," cried Simonides, quickly. "He accepted me a servant of
  that class because I prayed him to do so. I never repented the step. It was
  the price I paid for Rachel, the mother of my child here; for Rachel, who
  would not be my wife unless I became what she was."</p>

  <p>"Was she a servant forever?"</p>

  <p>"Even so."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur walked the floor in pain of impotent wish.</p>

  <p>"I was rich before," he said, stopping suddenly. "I was rich with the
  gifts of the generous Arrius; now comes this greater fortune, and the mind
  which achieved it. Is there not a purpose of God in it all? Counsel me, O
  Simonides! Help me to see the right and do it. Help me to be worthy my name,
  and what thou art in law to me, that will I be to thee in fact and deed. I
  will be thy servant forever."</p>

  <p>Simonides' face actually glowed.</p>

  <p>"O son of my dead master! I will do better than help; I will serve thee
  with all my might of mind and heart. Body, I have not; it perished in thy
  cause; but with mind and heart I will serve thee. I swear it, by the altar of
  our God, and the gifts upon the altar! Only make me formally what I have
  assumed to be."</p>

  <p>"Name it," said Ben-Hur, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"As steward the care of the property will be mine."</p>

  <p>"Count thyself steward now; or wilt thou have it in writing?"</p>

  <p>"Thy word simply is enough; it was so with the father, and I will not more
  from the son. And now, if the understanding be perfect"&mdash;Simonides
  paused.</p>

  <p>"It is with me," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"And thou, daughter of Rachel, speak!" said Simonides, lifting her arm
  from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Esther, left thus alone, stood a moment abashed, her color coming and
  going; then she went to Ben-Hur, and said, with a womanliness singularly
  sweet, "I am not better than my mother was; and, as she is gone, I pray you,
  O my master, let me care for my father."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took her hand, and led her back to the chair, saying, "Thou art a
  good child. Have thy will."</p>

  <p>Simonides replaced her arm upon his neck, and there was silence for a time
  in the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch508"
     name="ch508"></a>VIII. &mdash; SPIRITUAL OR POLITICAL?&mdash; SIMONIDES
     ARGUES</h2>

  <p class="first">Simonides looked up, none the less a master.</p>

  <p>"Esther," he said, quietly, "the night is going fast; and, lest we become
  too weary for that which is before us, let the refreshments be brought."</p>

  <p>She rang a bell. A servant answered with wine and bread, which she bore
  round.</p>

  <p>"The understanding, good my master," continued Simonides, when all were
  served, "is not perfect in my sight. Henceforth our lives will run on
  together like rivers which have met and joined their waters. I think their
  flowing will be better if every cloud is blown from the sky above them. You
  left my door the other day with what seemed a denial of the claims which I
  have just allowed in the broadest terms; but it was not so, indeed it was
  not. Esther is witness that I recognized you; and that I did not abandon you,
  let Malluch say."</p>

  <p>"Malluch!" exclaimed Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"One bound to a chair, like me, must have many hands far-reaching, if he
  would move the world from which he is so cruelly barred. I have many such,
  and Malluch is one of the best of them. And, sometimes"&mdash;he cast a
  grateful glance at the sheik&mdash;"sometimes I borrow from others good of
  heart, like Ilderim the Generous&mdash;good and brave. Let him say if I
  either denied or forgot you."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked at the Arab.</p>

  <p>"This is he, good Ilderim, this is he who told you of me?"</p>

  <p>Ilderim's eyes twinkled as he nodded his answer.</p>

  <p>"How, O my master," said Simonides, "may we without trial tell what a man
  is? I knew you; I saw your father in you; but the kind of man you were I did
  not know. There are people to whom fortune is a curse in disguise. Were you
  of them? I sent Malluch to find out for me, and in the service he was my eyes
  and ears. Do not blame him. He brought me report of you which was all
  good."</p>

  <p>"I do not," said Ben-Hur, heartily. "There was wisdom in your
  goodness."</p>

  <p>"The words are very pleasant to me," said the merchant, with feeling,
  "very pleasant. My fear of misunderstanding is laid. Let the rivers run on
  now as God may give them direction."</p>

  <p>After an interval he continued:</p>

  <p>"I am compelled now by truth. The weaver sits weaving, and, as the shuttle
  flies, the cloth increases, and the figures grow, and he dreams dreams
  meanwhile; so to my hands the fortune grew, and I wondered at the increase,
  and asked myself about it many times. I could see a care not my own went with
  the enterprises I set going. The simooms which smote others on the desert
  jumped over the things which were mine. The storms which heaped the seashore
  with wrecks did but blow my ships the sooner into port. Strangest of all, I,
  so dependent upon others, fixed to a place like a dead thing, had never a
  loss by an agent&mdash;never. The elements stooped to serve me, and all my
  servants, in fact, were faithful."</p>

  <p>"It is very strange," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"So I said, and kept saying. Finally, O my master, finally I came to be of
  your opinion&mdash;God was in it&mdash;and, like you, I asked, What can his
  purpose be? Intelligence is never wasted; intelligence like God's never stirs
  except with design. I have held the question in heart, lo! these many years,
  watching for an answer. I felt sure, if God were in it, some day, in his own
  good time, in his own way, he would show me his purpose, making it clear as a
  whited house upon a hill. And I believe he has done so."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur listened with every faculty intent.</p>

  <p>"Many years ago, with my people&mdash;thy mother was with me, Esther,
  beautiful as morning over old Olivet&mdash;I sat by the wayside out north of
  Jerusalem, near the Tombs of the Kings, when three men passed by riding great
  white camels, such as had never been seen in the Holy City. The men were
  strangers, and from far countries. The first one stopped and asked me a
  question. 'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?' As if to allay my
  wonder, he went on to say, 'We have seen his star in the east, and have come
  to worship him.' I could not understand, but followed them to the Damascus
  Gate; and of every person they met on the way&mdash;of the guard at the Gate,
  even&mdash;they asked the question. All who heard it were amazed like me. In
  time I forgot the circumstance, though there was much talk of it as a presage
  of the Messiah. Alas, alas! What children we are, even the wisest! When God
  walks the earth, his steps are often centuries apart. You have seen
  Balthasar?"</p>

  <p>"And heard him tell his story," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"A miracle!&mdash;a very miracle!" cried Simonides. "As he told it to me,
  good my master, I seemed to hear the answer I had so long waited; God's
  purpose burst upon me. Poor will the King be when he comes&mdash;poor and
  friendless; without following, without armies, without cities or castles; a
  kingdom to be set up, and Rome reduced and blotted out. See, see, O my
  master! thou flushed with strength, thou trained to arms, thou burdened with
  riches; behold the opportunity the Lord hath sent thee! Shall not his purpose
  be thine? Could a man be born to a more perfect glory?"</p>

  <p>Simonides put his whole force in the appeal.</p>

  <p>"But the kingdom, the kingdom!" Ben-Hur answered, eagerly. "Balthasar says
  it is to be of souls."</p>

  <p>The pride of the Jew was strong in Simonides, and therefore the slightly
  contemptuous curl of the lip with which he began his reply:</p>

  <p>"Balthasar has been a witness of wonderful things&mdash;of miracles, O my
  master; and when he speaks of them, I bow with belief, for they are of sight
  and sound personal to him. But he is a son of Mizraim, and not even a
  proselyte. Hardly may he be supposed to have special knowledge by virtue of
  which we must bow to him in a matter of God's dealing with our Israel. The
  prophets had their light from Heaven directly, even as he had his&mdash;many
  to one, and Jehovah the same forever. I must believe the
  prophets.&mdash;Bring me the Torah, Esther."</p>

  <p>He proceeded without waiting for her.</p>

  <p>"May the testimony of a whole people be slighted, my master? Though you
  travel from Tyre, which is by the sea in the north, to the capital of Edom,
  which is in the desert south, you will not find a lisper of the Shema, an
  alms-giver in the Temple, or any one who has ever eaten of the lamb of the
  Passover, to tell you the kingdom the King is coming to build for us, the
  children of the covenant, is other than of this world, like our father
  David's. Now where got they the faith, ask you! We will see presently."</p>

  <p>Esther here returned, bringing a number of rolls carefully enveloped in
  dark-brown linen lettered quaintly in gold.</p>

  <p>"Keep them, daughter, to give to me as I call for them," the father said,
  in the tender voice he always used in speaking to her, and continued his
  argument:</p>

  <p>"It were long, good my master&mdash;too long, indeed&mdash;for me to
  repeat to you the names of the holy men who, in the providence of God,
  succeeded the prophets, only a little less favored than they&mdash;the seers
  who have written and the preachers who have taught since the Captivity; the
  very wise who borrowed their lights from the lamp of Malachi, the last of his
  line, and whose great names Hillel and Shammai never tired of repeating in
  the colleges. Will you ask them of the kingdom? Thus, the Lord of the sheep
  in the Book of Enoch&mdash;who is he? Who but the King of whom we are
  speaking? A throne is set up for him; he smites the earth, and the other
  kings are shaken from their thrones, and the scourges of Israel flung into a
  cavern of fire flaming with pillars of fire. So also the singer of the Psalms
  of Solomon&mdash;'Behold, O Lord, and raise up to Israel their king, the son
  of David, at the time thou knowest, O God, to rule Israel, thy children....
  And he will bring the peoples of the heathen under his yoke to serve him....
  And he shall be a righteous king taught of God, ... for he shall rule all the
  earth by the word of his mouth forever.' And last, though not least, hear
  Ezra, the second Moses, in his visions of the night, and ask him who is the
  lion with human voice that says to the eagle&mdash;which is Rome&mdash;'Thou
  hast loved liars, and overthrown the cities of the industrious, and razed
  their walls, though they did thee no harm. Therefore, begone, that the earth
  may be refreshed, and recover itself, and hope in the justice and piety of
  him who made her.' Whereat the eagle was seen no more. Surely, O my master,
  the testimony of these should be enough! But the way to the fountain's head
  is open. Let us go up to it at once.&mdash;Some wine, Esther, and then the
  Torah."</p>

  <p>"Dost thou believe the prophets, master?" he asked, after drinking. "I
  know thou dost, for of such was the faith of all thy kindred.&mdash;Give me,
  Esther, the book which bath in it the visions of Isaiah."</p>

  <p>He took one of the rolls which she had unwrapped for him, and read, "'The
  people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in
  the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.... For unto
  us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon
  his shoulder.... Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be
  no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to
  establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even
  forever.'&mdash;Believest thou the prophets, O my master?&mdash;Now, Esther,
  the word of the Lord that came to Micah."</p>

  <p>She gave him the roll he asked.</p>

  <p>"'But thou,'" he began reading&mdash;"'but thou, Bethlehem Ephrath, though
  thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come
  forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.'&mdash;This was he, the very
  child Balthasar saw and worshipped in the cave. Believest thou the prophets,
  O my master?&mdash;Give me, Esther, the words of Jeremiah."</p>

  <p>Receiving that roll, he read as before, "'Behold, the days come, saith the
  Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign
  and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days
  Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely.' As a king he shall
  reign&mdash;as a king, O my master! Believest thou the prophets?&mdash;Now,
  daughter, the roll of the sayings of that son of Judah in whom there was no
  blemish."</p>

  <p>She gave him the Book of Daniel.</p>

  <p>"Hear, my master," he said: "'I saw in the night visions, and behold, one
  like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven.... And there was given
  him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and
  languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which
  shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be
  destroyed.'&mdash;Believest thou the prophets, O my master?"</p>

  <p>"It is enough. I believe," cried Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"What then?" asked Simonides. "If the King come poor, will not my master,
  of his abundance, give him help?"</p>

  <p>"Help him? To the last shekel and the last breath. But why speak of his
  coming poor?"</p>

  <p>"Give me, Esther, the word of the Lord as it came to Zechariah," said
  Simonides.</p>

  <p>She gave him one of the rolls.</p>

  <p>"Hear how the King will enter Jerusalem." Then he read, "'Rejoice greatly,
  O daughter of Zion.... Behold, thy King cometh unto thee with justice and
  salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an
  ass.'"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked away.</p>

  <p>"What see you, O my master?"</p>

  <p>"Rome!" he answered, gloomily&mdash;"Rome, and her legions. I have dwelt
  with them in their camps. I know them."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Simonides. "Thou shalt be a master of legions for the King,
  with millions to choose from."</p>

  <p>"Millions!" cried Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>Simonides sat a moment thinking.</p>

  <p>"The question of power should not trouble you," he next said.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"You were seeing the lowly King in the act of coming to his own,"
  Simonides answered&mdash;"seeing him on the right hand, as it were, and on
  the left the brassy legions of Caesar, and you were asking, What can he
  do?"</p>

  <p>"It was my very thought."</p>

  <p>"O my master!" Simonides continued. "You do not know how strong our Israel
  is. You think of him as a sorrowful old man weeping by the rivers of Babylon.
  But go up to Jerusalem next Passover, and stand on the Xystus or in the
  Street of Barter, and see him as he is. The promise of the Lord to father
  Jacob coming out of Padan-Aram was a law under which our people have not
  ceased multiplying&mdash;not even in captivity; they grew under foot of the
  Egyptian; the clench of the Roman has been but wholesome nurture to them; now
  they are indeed 'a nation and a company of nations.' Nor that only, my
  master; in fact, to measure the strength of Israel&mdash;which is, in fact,
  measuring what the King can do&mdash;you shall not bide solely by the rule of
  natural increase, but add thereto the other&mdash;I mean the spread of the
  faith, which will carry you to the far and near of the whole known earth.
  Further, the habit is, I know, to think and speak of Jerusalem as Israel,
  which may be likened to our finding an embroidered shred, and holding it up
  as a magisterial robe of Caesar's. Jerusalem is but a stone of the Temple, or
  the heart in the body. Turn from beholding the legions, strong though they
  be, and count the hosts of the faithful waiting the old alarm, 'To your
  tents, O Israel!'&mdash;count the many in Persia, children of those who chose
  not to return with the returning; count the brethren who swarm the marts of
  Egypt and Farther Africa; count the Hebrew colonists eking profit in the
  West&mdash;in Lodinum and the trade-courts of Spain; count the pure of blood
  and the proselytes in Greece and in the isles of the sea, and over in Pontus,
  and here in Antioch, and, for that matter, those of that city lying accursed
  in the shadow of the unclean walls of Rome herself; count the worshippers of
  the Lord dwelling in tents along the deserts next us, as well as in the
  deserts beyond the Nile: and in the regions across the Caspian, and up in the
  old lands of Gog and Magog even, separate those who annually send gifts to
  the Holy Temple in acknowledgment of God&mdash;separate them, that they may
  be counted also. And when you have done counting, lo! my master, a census of
  the sword hands that await you; lo! a kingdom ready fashioned for him who is
  to do 'judgment and justice in the whole earth'&mdash;in Rome not less than
  in Zion. Have then the answer, What Israel can do, that can the King."</p>

  <p>The picture was fervently given.</p>

  <p>Upon Ilderim it operated like the blowing of a trumpet. "Oh that I had
  back my youth!" he cried, starting to his feet.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur sat still. The speech, he saw, was an invitation to devote his
  life and fortune to the mysterious Being who was palpably as much the centre
  of a great hope with Simonides as with the devout Egyptian. The idea, as we
  have seen, was not a new one, but had come to him repeatedly; once while
  listening to Malluch in the Grove of Daphne; afterwards more distinctly while
  Balthasar was giving his conception of what the kingdom was to be; still
  later, in the walk through the old Orchard, it had risen almost, if not
  quite, into a resolve. At such times it had come and gone only an idea,
  attended with feelings more or less acute. Not so now. A master had it in
  charge, a master was working it up; already he had exalted it into a
  <i>cause</i> brilliant with possibilities and infinitely holy. The effect was
  as if a door theretofore unseen had suddenly opened flooding Ben-Hur with
  light, and admitting him to a service which had been his one perfect
  dream&mdash;a service reaching far into the future, and rich with the rewards
  of duty done, and prizes to sweeten and soothe his ambition. One touch more
  was needed.</p>

  <p>"Let us concede all you say, O Simonides," said Ben-Hur&mdash;"that the
  King will come, and his kingdom be as Solomon's; say also I am ready to give
  myself and all I have to him and his cause; yet more, say that I should do as
  was God's purpose in the ordering of my life and in your quick amassment of
  astonishing fortune; then what? Shall we proceed like blind men building?
  Shall we wait till the King comes? Or until he sends for me? You have age and
  experience on your side. Answer."</p>

  <p>Simonides answered at once.</p>

  <p>"We have no choice; none. This letter"&mdash;he produced Messala's
  despatch as he spoke&mdash;"this letter is the signal for action. The
  alliance proposed between Messala and Gratus we are not strong enough to
  resist; we have not the influence at Rome nor the force here. They will kill
  you if we wait. How merciful they are, look at me and judge."</p>

  <p>He shuddered at the terrible recollection.</p>

  <p>"O good my master," he continued, recovering himself; "how strong are
  you&mdash;in purpose, I mean?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur did not understand him.</p>

  <p>"I remember how pleasant the world was to me in my youth," Simonides
  proceeded.</p>

  <p>"Yet," said Ben-Hur, "you were capable of a great sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Yes; for love."</p>

  <p>"Has not life other motives as strong?"</p>

  <p>Simonides shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There is ambition."</p>

  <p>"Ambition is forbidden a son of Israel."</p>

  <p>"What, then, of revenge?"</p>

  <p>The spark dropped upon the inflammable passion; the man's eyes gleamed;
  his hands shook; he answered, quickly, "Revenge is a Jew's of right; it is
  the law."</p>

  <p>"A camel, even a dog, will remember a wrong," cried Ilderim.</p>

  <p>Directly Simonides picked up the broken thread of his thought.</p>

  <p>"There is a work, a work for the King, which should be done in advance of
  his coming. We may not doubt that Israel is to be his right hand; but, alas!
  it is a hand of peace, without cunning in war. Of the millions, there is not
  one trained band, not a captain. The mercenaries of the Herods I do not
  count, for they are kept to crush us. The condition is as the Roman would
  have it; his policy has fruited well for his tyranny; but the time of change
  is at hand, when the shepherd shall put on armor, and take to spear and
  sword, and the feeding flocks be turned to fighting lions. Some one, my son,
  must have place next the King at his right hand. Who shall it be if not he
  who does this work well?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur's face flushed at the prospect, though he said, "I see; but speak
  plainly. A deed to be done is one thing; how to do it is another."</p>

  <p>Simonides sipped the wine Esther brought him, and replied,</p>

  <p>"The sheik, and thou, my master, shall be principals, each with a part. I
  will remain here, carrying on as now, and watchful that the spring go not
  dry. Thou shalt betake thee to Jerusalem, and thence to the wilderness, and
  begin numbering the fighting-men of Israel, and telling them into tens and
  hundreds, and choosing captains and training them, and in secret places
  hoarding arms, for which I shall keep thee supplied. Commencing over in
  Perea, thou shalt go then to Galilee, whence it is but a step to Jerusalem.
  In Perea, the desert will be at thy back, and Ilderim in reach of thy hand.
  He will keep the roads, so that nothing shall pass without thy knowledge. He
  will help thee in many ways. Until the ripening time no one shall know what
  is here contracted. Mine is but a servant's part. I have spoken to Ilderim.
  What sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked at the sheik.</p>

  <p>"It is as he says, son of Hur," the Arab responded. "I have given my word,
  and he is content with it; but thou shalt have my oath, binding me, and the
  ready hands of my tribe, and whatever serviceable thing I have."</p>

  <p>The three&mdash;Simonides, Ilderim, Esther&mdash;gazed at Ben-Hur
  fixedly.</p>

  <p>"Every man," he answered, at first sadly, "has a cup of pleasure poured
  for him, and soon or late it comes to his hand, and he tastes and
  drinks&mdash;every man but me. I see, Simonides, and thou, O generous
  sheik!&mdash;I see whither the proposal tends. If I accept, and enter upon
  the course, farewell peace, and the hopes which cluster around it. The doors
  I might enter and the gates of quiet life will shut behind me, never to open
  again, for Rome keeps them all; and her outlawry will follow me, and her
  hunters; and in the tombs near cities and the dismal caverns of remotest
  hills, I must eat my crust and take my rest."</p>

  <p>The speech was broken by a sob. All turned to Esther, who hid her face
  upon her father's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I did not think of you, Esther," said Simonides, gently, for he was
  himself deeply moved.</p>

  <p>"It is well enough, Simonides," said Ben-Hur. "A man bears a hard doom
  better, knowing there is pity for him. Let me go on."</p>

  <p>They gave him ear again.</p>

  <p>"I was about to say," he continued, "I have no choice, but take the part
  you assign me; and as remaining here is to meet an ignoble death, I will to
  the work at once."</p>

  <p>"Shall we have writings?" asked Simonides, moved by his habit of
  business.</p>

  <p>"I rest upon your word," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"And I," Ilderim answered.</p>

  <p>Thus simply was effected the treaty which was to alter Ben-Hur's life. And
  almost immediately the latter added,</p>

  <p>"It is done, then."</p>

  <p>"May the God of Abraham help us!" Simonides exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"One word now, my friends," Ben-Hur said, more cheerfully. "By your leave,
  I will be my own until after the games. It is not probable Messala will set
  peril on foot for me until he has given the procurator time to answer him;
  and that cannot be in less than seven days from the despatch of his letter.
  The meeting him in the Circus is a pleasure I would buy at whatever
  risk."</p>

  <p>Ilderim, well pleased, assented readily, and Simonides, intent on
  business, added, "It is well; for look you, my master, the delay will give me
  time to do you a good part. I understood you to speak of an inheritance
  derived from Arrius. Is it in property?"</p>

  <p>"A villa near Misenum, and houses in Rome."</p>

  <p>"I suggest, then, the sale of the property, and safe deposit of the
  proceeds. Give me an account of it, and I will have authorities drawn, and
  despatch an agent on the mission forthwith. We will forestall the imperial
  robbers at least this once."</p>

  <p>"You shall have the account to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Then, if there be nothing more, the work of the night is done," said
  Simonides.</p>

  <p>Ilderim combed his beard complacently, saying, "And well done."</p>

  <p>"The bread and wine again, Esther. Sheik Ilderim will make us happy by
  staying with us till to-morrow, or at his pleasure; and thou, my
  master&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let the horses be brought," said Ben-Hur. "I will return to the Orchard.
  The enemy will not discover me if I go now, and"&mdash;he glanced at
  Ilderim&mdash;"the four will be glad to see me."</p>

  <p>As the day dawned, he and Malluch dismounted at the door of the tent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch509"
     name="ch509"></a>IX. &mdash; ESTHER AND BEN-HUR</h2>

  <p class="first">Next night, about the fourth hour, Ben-Hur stood on the
  terrace of the great warehouse with Esther. Below them, on the landing, there
  was much running about, and shifting of packages and boxes, and shouting of
  men, whose figures, stooping, heaving, hauling, looked, in the light of the
  crackling torches kindled in their aid, like the laboring genii of the
  fantastic Eastern tales. A galley was being laden for instant departure.
  Simonides had not yet come from his office, in which, at the last moment, he
  would deliver to the captain of the vessel instructions to proceed without
  stop to Ostia, the seaport of Rome, and, after landing a passenger there,
  continue more leisurely to Valentia, on the coast of Spain.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"
     name="pic10"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1306331h-images/BenHur-09.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur inspects Sheik Ilderim's horses.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The passenger is the agent going to dispose of the estate derived from
  Arrius the duumvir. When the lines of the vessel are cast off, and she is put
  about, and her voyage begun, Ben-Hur will be committed irrevocably to the
  work undertaken the night before. If he is disposed to repent the agreement
  with Ilderim, a little time is allowed him to give notice and break it off.
  He is master, and has only to say the word.</p>

  <p>Such may have been the thought at the moment in his mind. He was standing
  with folded arms, looking upon the scene in the manner of a man debating with
  himself. Young, handsome, rich, but recently from the patrician circles of
  Roman society, it is easy to think of the world besetting him with appeals
  not to give more to onerous duty or ambition attended with outlawry and
  danger. We can even imagine the arguments with which he was pressed; the
  hopelessness of contention with Caesar; the uncertainty veiling everything
  connected with the King and his coming; the ease, honors, state, purchasable
  like goods in market; and, strongest of all, the sense newly acquired of
  home, with friends to make it delightful. Only those who have been wanderers
  long desolate can know the power there was in the latter appeal.</p>

  <p>Let us add now, the world&mdash;always cunning enough of itself; always
  whispering to the weak, Stay, take thine ease; always presenting the sunny
  side of life&mdash;the world was in this instance helped by Ben-Hur's
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Were you ever at Rome?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Esther replied.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to go?"</p>

  <p>"I think not."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of Rome," she answered, with a perceptible tremor of the
  voice.</p>

  <p>He looked at her then&mdash;or rather down upon her, for at his side she
  appeared little more than a child. In the dim light he could not see her face
  distinctly; even the form was shadowy. But again he was reminded of Tirzah,
  and a sudden tenderness fell upon him&mdash;just so the lost sister stood
  with him on the house-top the calamitous morning of the accident to Gratus.
  Poor Tirzah! Where was she now? Esther had the benefit of the feeling evoked.
  If not his sister, he could never look upon her as his servant; and that she
  was his servant in fact would make him always the more considerate and gentle
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"I cannot think of Rome," she continued, recovering her voice, and
  speaking in her quiet womanly way&mdash;"I cannot think of Rome as a city of
  palaces and temples, and crowded with people; she is to me a monster which
  has possession of one of the beautiful lands, and lies there luring men to
  ruin and death&mdash;a monster which it is not possible to resist&mdash;a
  ravenous beast gorging with blood. Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She faltered, looked down, stopped.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Ben-Hur, reassuringly.</p>

  <p>She drew closer to him, looked up again, and said, "Why must you make her
  your enemy? Why not rather make peace with her, and be at rest? You have had
  many ills, and borne them; you have survived the snares laid for you by foes.
  Sorrow has consumed your youth; is it well to give it the remainder of your
  days?"</p>

  <p>The girlish face under his eyes seemed to come nearer and get whiter as
  the pleading went on; he stooped towards it, and asked, softly, "What would
  you have me do, Esther?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated a moment, then asked, in return, "Is the property near Rome
  a residence?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And pretty?"</p>

  <p>"It is beautiful&mdash;a palace in the midst of gardens and shell-strewn
  walks; fountains without and within; statuary in the shady nooks; hills
  around covered with vines, and so high that Neapolis and Vesuvius are in
  sight, and the sea an expanse of purpling blue dotted with restless sails.
  Caesar has a country-seat near-by, but in Rome they say the old Arrian villa
  is the prettiest."</p>

  <p>"And the life there, is it quiet?"</p>

  <p>"There was never a summer day, never a moonlit night, more quiet, save
  when visitors come. Now that the old owner is gone, and I am here, there is
  nothing to break its silence&mdash;nothing, unless it be the whispering of
  servants, or the whistling of happy birds, or the noise of fountains at play;
  it is changeless, except as day by day old flowers fade and fall, and new
  ones bud and bloom, and the sunlight gives place to the shadow of a passing
  cloud. The life, Esther, was all too quiet for me. It made me restless by
  keeping always present a feeling that I, who have so much to do, was dropping
  into idle habits, and tying myself with silken chains, and after a
  while&mdash;and not a long while either&mdash;would end with nothing
  done."</p>

  <p>She looked off over the river.</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Good my master&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Esther&mdash;not that. Call me friend&mdash;brother, if you will;
  I am not your master, and will not be. Call me brother."</p>

  <p>He could not see the flush of pleasure which reddened her face, and the
  glow of the eyes that went out lost in the void above the river.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand," she said, "the nature which prefers the life you
  are going to&mdash;a life of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of violence, and it may be of blood," he said, completing the
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she added, "the nature which could prefer that life to such as
  might be in the beautiful villa."</p>

  <p>"Esther, you mistake. There is no preference. Alas! the Roman is not so
  kind. I am going of necessity. To stay here is to die; and if I go there, the
  end will be the same&mdash;a poisoned cup, a bravo's blow, or a judge's
  sentence obtained by perjury. Messala and the procurator Gratus are rich with
  plunder of my father's estate, and it is more important to them to keep their
  gains now than was their getting in the first instance. A peaceable
  settlement is out of reach, because of the confession it would imply. And
  then&mdash;then&mdash; Ah, Esther, if I could buy them, I do not know that I
  would. I do not believe peace possible to me; no, not even in the sleepy
  shade and sweet air of the marble porches of the old villa&mdash;no matter
  who might be there to help me bear the burden of the days, nor by what
  patience of love she made the effort. Peace is not possible to me while my
  people are lost, for I must be watchful to find them. If I find them, and
  they have suffered wrong, shall not the guilty suffer for it? If they are
  dead by violence, shall the murderers escape? Oh, I could not sleep for
  dreams! Nor could the holiest love, by any stratagem, lull me to a rest which
  conscience would not strangle."</p>

  <p>"Is it so bad then?" she asked, her voice tremulous with feeling. "Can
  nothing, nothing, be done?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took her hand.</p>

  <p>"Do you care so much for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, simply.</p>

  <p>The hand was warm, and in the palm of his it was lost. He felt it tremble.
  Then the Egyptian came, so the opposite of this little one; so tall, so
  audacious, with a flattery so cunning, a wit so ready, a beauty so wonderful,
  a manner so bewitching. He carried the hand to his lips, and gave it
  back.</p>

  <p>"You shall be another Tirzah to me, Esther."</p>

  <p>"Who is Tirzah?"</p>

  <p>"The little sister the Roman stole from me, and whom I must find before I
  can rest or be happy."</p>

  <p>Just then a gleam of light flashed athwart the terrace and fell upon the
  two; and, looking round, they saw a servant roll Simonides in his chair out
  of the door. They went to the merchant, and in the after-talk he was
  principal.</p>

  <p>Immediately the lines of the galley were cast off, and she swung round,
  and, midst the flashing of torches and the shouting of joyous sailors,
  hurried off to the sea&mdash;leaving Ben-Hur committed to the cause of the
  KING WHO WAS TO COME.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch510"
     name="ch510"></a>X. &mdash; POSTED FOR THE RACE</h2>

  <p class="first">The day before the games, in the afternoon, all Ilderim's
  racing property was taken to the city, and put in quarters adjoining the
  Circus. Along with it the good man carried a great deal of property not of
  that class; so with servants, retainers mounted and armed, horses in leading,
  cattle driven, camels laden with baggage, his outgoing from the Orchard was
  not unlike a tribal migration. The people along the road failed not to laugh
  at his motley procession; on the other side, it was observed that, with all
  his irascibility, he was not in the least offended by their rudeness. If he
  was under surveillance, as he had reason to believe, the informer would
  describe the semi-barbarous show with which he came up to the races. The
  Romans would laugh; the city would be amused; but what cared he? Next morning
  the pageant would be far on the road to the desert, and going with it would
  be every movable thing of value belonging to the Orchard&mdash;everything
  save such as were essential to the success of his four. He was, in fact,
  started home; his tents were all folded; the dowar was no more; in twelve
  hours all would be out of reach, pursue who might. A man is never safer than
  when he is under the laugh; and the shrewd old Arab knew it.</p>

  <p>Neither he nor Ben-Hur overestimated the influence of Messala; it was
  their opinion, however, that he would not begin active measures against them
  until after the meeting in the Circus; if defeated there, especially if
  defeated by Ben-Hur, they might instantly look for the worst he could do; he
  might not even wait for advices from Gratus. With this view, they shaped
  their course, and were prepared to betake themselves out of harm's way. They
  rode together now in good spirits, calmly confident of success on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>On the way, they came upon Malluch in waiting for them. The faithful
  fellow gave no sign by which it was possible to infer any knowledge on his
  part of the relationship so recently admitted between Ben-Hur and Simonides,
  or of the treaty between them and Ilderim. He exchanged salutations as usual,
  and produced a paper, saying to the sheik, "I have here the notice of the
  editor of the games, just issued, in which you will find your horses
  published for the race. You will find in it also the order of exercises.
  Without waiting, good sheik, I congratulate you upon your victory."</p>

  <p>He gave the paper over, and, leaving the worthy to master it, turned to
  Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"To you also, son of Arrius, my congratulations. There is nothing now to
  prevent your meeting Messala. Every condition preliminary to the race is
  complied with. I have the assurance from the editor himself."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Malluch," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>Malluch proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Your color is white, and Messala's mixed scarlet and gold. The good
  effects of the choice are visible already. Boys are now hawking white ribbons
  along the streets; tomorrow every Arab and Jew in the city will wear them. In
  the Circus you will see the white fairly divide the galleries with the
  red."</p>

  <p>"The galleries&mdash;but not the tribunal over the Porta Pompae."</p>

  <p>"No; the scarlet and gold will rule there. But if we win"&mdash;Malluch
  chuckled with the pleasure of the thought&mdash;"if we win, how the
  dignitaries will tremble! They will bet, of course, according to their scorn
  of everything not Roman&mdash;two, three, five to one on Messala, because he
  is Roman." Dropping his voice yet lower, he added, "It ill becomes a Jew of
  good standing in the Temple to put his money at such a hazard; yet, in
  confidence, I will have a friend next behind the consul's seat to accept
  offers of three to one, or five, or ten&mdash;the madness may go to such
  height. I have put to his order six thousand shekels for the purpose."</p>

  <p>"Nay, Malluch," said Ben-Hur, "a Roman will wager only in his Roman coin.
  Suppose you find your friend to-night, and place to his order sestertii in
  such amount as you choose. And look you, Malluch&mdash;let him be instructed
  to seek wagers with Messala and his supporters; Ilderim's four against
  Messala's."</p>

  <p>Malluch reflected a moment.</p>

  <p>"The effect will be to centre interest upon your contest."</p>

  <p>"The very thing I seek, Malluch."</p>

  <p>"I see, I see."</p>

  <p>"Ay, Malluch; would you serve me perfectly, help me to fix the public eye
  upon our race&mdash;Messala's and mine."</p>

  <p>Malluch spoke quickly&mdash;"It can be done."</p>

  <p>"Then let it be done," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Enormous wagers offered will answer; if the offers are accepted, all the
  better."</p>

  <p>Malluch turned his eyes watchfully upon Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Shall I not have back the equivalent of his robbery?" said Ben-Hur,
  partly to himself. "Another opportunity may not come. And if I could break
  him in fortune as well as in pride! Our father Jacob could take no
  offence."</p>

  <p>A look of determined will knit his handsome face, giving emphasis to his
  further speech.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it shall be. Hark, Malluch! Stop not in thy offer of sestertii.
  Advance them to talents, if any there be who dare so high. Five, ten, twenty
  talents; ay, fifty, so the wager be with Messala himself."</p>

  <p>"It is a mighty sum," said Malluch. "I must have security."</p>

  <p>"So thou shalt. Go to Simonides, and tell him I wish the matter arranged.
  Tell him my heart is set on the ruin of my enemy, and that the opportunity
  hath such excellent promise that I choose such hazards. On our side be the
  God of our fathers. Go, good Malluch. Let this not slip."</p>

  <p>And Malluch, greatly delighted, gave him parting salutation, and started
  to ride away, but returned presently.</p>

  <p>"Your pardon," he said to Ben-Hur. "There was another matter. I could not
  get near Messala's chariot myself, but I had another measure it; and, from
  his report, its hub stands quite a palm higher from the ground than
  yours."</p>

  <p>"A palm! So much?" cried Ben-Hur, joyfully.</p>

  <p>Then he leaned over to Malluch.</p>

  <p>"As thou art a son of Judah, Malluch, and faithful to thy kin, get thee a
  seat in the gallery over the Gate of Triumph, down close to the balcony in
  front of the pillars, and watch well when we make the turns there; watch
  well, for if I have favor at all, I will&mdash; Nay, Malluch, let it go
  unsaid! Only get thee there, and watch well."</p>

  <p>At that moment a cry burst from Ilderim.</p>

  <p>"Ha! By the splendor of God! what is this?"</p>

  <p>He drew near Ben-Hur with a finger pointing on the face of the notice.</p>

  <p>"Read," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"No; better thou."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took the paper, which, signed by the prefect of the province as
  editor, performed the office of a modern programme, giving particularly the
  several divertisements provided for the occasion. It informed the public that
  there would be first a procession of extraordinary splendor; that the
  procession would be succeeded by the customary honors to the god Consus,
  whereupon the games would begin; running, leaping, wrestling, boxing, each in
  the order stated. The names of the competitors were given, with their several
  nationalities and schools of training, the trials in which they had been
  engaged, the prizes won, and the prizes now offered; under the latter head
  the sums of money were stated in illuminated letters, telling of the
  departure of the day when the simple chaplet of pine or laurel was fully
  enough for the victor, hungering for glory as something better than riches,
  and content with it.</p>

  <p>Over these parts of the programme Ben-Hur sped with rapid eyes. At last he
  came to the announcement of the race. He read it slowly. Attending lovers of
  the heroic sports were assured they would certainly be gratified by an
  Orestean struggle unparalleled in Antioch. The city offered the spectacle in
  honor of the consul. One hundred thousand sestertii and a crown of laurel
  were the prizes. Then followed the particulars. The entries were six in
  all&mdash;fours only permitted; and, to further interest in the performance,
  the competitors would be turned into the course together. Each four then
  received description.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"I. A four of Lysippus the Corinthian&mdash;two grays, a
  bay, and a black; entered at Alexandria last year, and again at Corinth,
  where they were winners. Lysippus, driver. Color, yellow.</p>

  <p class="quote">"II. A four of Messala of Rome&mdash;two white, two black;
  victors of the Circensian as exhibited in the Circus Maximus last year.
  Messala, driver. Colors, scarlet and gold.</p>

  <p class="quote">"III. A four of Cleanthes the Athenian&mdash;three gray, one

  gray, one bay; winners this year at Byzantium. Dicaeus, driver. Color,

  entered at Caesarea, and thrice victors. Admetus, driver. Color, blue.</p>

  <p class="quote">"VI. A four of Ilderim, sheik of the Desert. All bays; first
  race. Ben-Hur, a Jew, driver. Color, white."</p><br>

  <p style="font-variant:small-caps"><small>Ben-Hur, a Jew, Driver!</small></p>

  <p>Why that name instead of Arrius?</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur raised his eyes to Ilderim. He had found the cause of the Arab's
  outcry. Both rushed to the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>The hand was the hand of Messala!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch511"
     name="ch511"></a>XI. &mdash; MAKING THE WAGERS</h2>

  <p class="first">Evening was hardly come upon Antioch, when the Omphalus,
  nearly in the centre of the city, became a troubled fountain from which in
  every direction, but chiefly down to the Nymphaeum and east and west along
  the Colonnade of Herod, flowed currents of people, for the time given up to
  Bacchus and Apollo.</p>

  <p>For such indulgence anything more fitting cannot be imagined than the
  great roofed streets, which were literally miles on miles of porticos wrought
  of marble, polished to the last degree of finish, and all gifts to the
  voluptuous city by princes careless of expenditure where, as in this
  instance, they thought they were eternizing themselves. Darkness was not
  permitted anywhere; and the singing, the laughter, the shouting, were
  incessant, and in compound like the roar of waters dashing through hollow
  grots, confused by a multitude of echoes.</p>

  <p>The many nationalities represented, though they might have amazed a
  stranger, were not peculiar to Antioch. Of the various missions of the great
  empire, one seems to have been the fusion of men and the introduction of
  strangers to each other; accordingly, whole peoples rose up and went at
  pleasure, taking with them their costumes, customs, speech, and gods; and
  where they chose, they stopped, engaged in business, built houses, erected
  altars, and were what they had been at home.</p>

  <p>There was a peculiarity, however, which could not have failed the notice
  of a looker-on this night in Antioch. Nearly everybody wore the colors of one
  or other of the charioteers announced for the morrow's race. Sometimes it was
  in form of a scarf, sometimes a badge; often a ribbon or a feather. Whatever
  the form, it signified merely the wearer's partiality; thus, green published
  a friend of Cleanthes the Athenian, and black an adherent of the Byzantine.
  This was according to a custom, old probably as the day of the race of
  Orestes&mdash;a custom, by the way, worthy of study as a marvel of history,
  illustrative of the absurd yet appalling extremities to which men frequently
  suffer their follies to drag them.</p>

  <p>The observer abroad on this occasion, once attracted to the wearing of
  colors, would have very shortly decided that there were three in
  predominance&mdash;green, white, and the mixed scarlet and gold.</p>

  <p>But let us from the streets to the palace on the island.</p>

  <p>The five great chandeliers in the saloon are freshly lighted. The
  assemblage is much the same as that already noticed in connection with the
  place. The divan has its corps of sleepers and burden of garments, and the
  tables yet resound with the rattle and clash of dice. Yet the greater part of
  the company are not doing anything. They walk about, or yawn tremendously, or
  pause as they pass each other to exchange idle nothings. Will the weather be
  fair to-morrow? Are the preparations for the games complete? Do the laws of
  the Circus in Antioch differ from the laws of the Circus in Rome? Truth is,
  the young fellows are suffering from ennui. Their heavy work is done; that
  is, we would find their tablets, could we look at them, covered with
  memoranda of wagers&mdash;wagers on every contest; on the running, the
  wrestling, the boxing; on everything but the chariot-race.</p>

  <p>And why not on that?</p>

  <p>Good reader, they cannot find anybody who will hazard so much as a
  denarius with them against Messala.</p>

  <p>There are no colors in the saloon but his.</p>

  <p>No one thinks of his defeat.</p>

  <p>Why, they say, is he not perfect in his training? Did he not graduate from
  an imperial lanista? Were not his horses winners at the Circensian in the
  Circus Maximus? And then&mdash;ah, yes! he is a Roman!</p>

  <p>In a corner, at ease on the divan, Messala himself may be seen. Around
  him, sitting or standing, are his courtierly admirers, plying him with
  questions. There is, of course, but one topic.</p>

  <p>Enter Drusus and Cecilius.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cries the young prince, throwing himself on the divan at Messala's
  feet, "Ah, by Bacchus, I am tired!"</p>

  <p>"Whither away?" asks Messala.</p>

  <p>"Up the street; up to the Omphalus, and beyond&mdash;who shall say how
  far? Rivers of people; never so many in the city before. They say we will see
  the whole world at the Circus to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Messala laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"The idiots! Perpol! They never beheld a Circensian with Caesar for
  editor. But, my Drusus, what found you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"O&mdash;ah! You forget," said Cecilius.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Drusus.</p>

  <p>"The procession of whites."</p>

  <p>"Mirabile!" cried Drusus, half rising. "We met a faction of whites, and
  they had a banner. But&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>He fell back indolently.</p>

  <p>"Cruel Drusus&mdash;not to go on," said Messala.</p>

  <p>"Scum of the desert were they, my Messala, and garbage-eaters from the
  Jacob's Temple in Jerusalem. What had I to do with them!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Cecilius, "Drusus is afraid of a laugh, but I am not, my
  Messala."</p>

  <p>"Speak thou, then."</p>

  <p>"Well, we stopped the faction, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Offered them a wager," said Drusus, relenting, and taking the word from
  the shadow's mouth. "And&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;one fellow with not enough
  skin on his face to make a worm for a carp stepped forth, and&mdash;ha, ha,
  ha!&mdash;said yes. I drew my tablets. 'Who is your man?' I asked. 'Ben-Hur,
  the Jew,' said he. Then I: 'What shall it be? How much?' He answered,
  'A&mdash;a&mdash;' Excuse me, Messala. By Jove's thunder, I cannot go on for
  laughter! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>The listeners leaned forward.</p>

  <p>Messala looked to Cecilius.</p>

  <p>"A shekel," said the latter.</p>

  <p>"A shekel! A shekel!"</p>

  <p>A burst of scornful laughter ran fast upon the repetition.</p>

  <p>"And what did Drusus?" asked Messala.</p>

  <p>An outcry over about the door just then occasioned a rush to that quarter;
  and, as the noise there continued, and grew louder, even Cecilius betook
  himself off, pausing only to say, "The noble Drusus, my Messala, put up his
  tablets and&mdash;lost the shekel."</p>

  <p>"A white! A white!"</p>

  <p>"Let him come!"</p>

  <p>"This way, this way!"</p>

  <p>These and like exclamations filled the saloon, to the stoppage of other
  speech. The dice-players quit their games; the sleepers awoke, rubbed their
  eyes, drew their tablets, and hurried to the common centre.</p>

  <p>"I offer you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The person so warmly received was the respectable Jew, Ben-Hur's
  fellow-voyager from Cyprus. He entered grave, quiet, observant. His robe was
  spotlessly white; so was the cloth of his turban. Bowing and smiling at the
  welcome, he moved slowly towards the central table. Arrived there, he drew
  his robe about him in a stately manner, took seat, and waved his hand. The
  gleam of a jewel on a finger helped him not a little to the silence which
  ensued.</p>

  <p>"Romans&mdash;most noble Romans&mdash;I salute you!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Easy, by Jupiter! Who is he?" asked Drusus.</p>

  <p>"A dog of Israel&mdash;Sanballat by name&mdash;purveyor for the army;
  residence, Rome; vastly rich; grown so as a contractor of furnishments which
  he never furnishes. He spins mischiefs, nevertheless, finer than spiders spin
  their webs. Come&mdash;by the girdle of Venus! let us catch him!"</p>

  <p>Messala arose as he spoke, and, with Drusus, joined the mass crowded about
  the purveyor.</p>

  <p>"It came to me on the street," said that person, producing his tablets,
  and opening them on the table with an impressive air of business, "that there
  was great discomfort in the palace because offers on Messala were going
  without takers. The gods, you know, must have sacrifices; and here am I. You
  see my color; let us to the matter. Odds first, amounts next. What will you
  give me?"</p>

  <p>The audacity seemed to stun his hearers.</p>

  <p>"Haste!" he said. "I have an engagement with the consul."</p>

  <p>The spur was effective.</p>

  <p>"Two to one," cried half a dozen in a voice.</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed the purveyor, astonished. "Only two to one, and yours a
  Roman!"</p>

  <p>"Take three, then."</p>

  <p>"Three say you&mdash;only three&mdash;and mine but a dog of a Jew! Give me
  four."</p>

  <p>"Four it is," said a boy, stung by the taunt.</p>

  <p>"Five&mdash;give me five," cried the purveyor, instantly.</p>

  <p>A profound stillness fell upon the assemblage.</p>

  <p>"The consul&mdash;your master and mine&mdash;is waiting for me."</p>

  <p>The inaction became awkward to the many.</p>

  <p>"Give me five&mdash;for the honor of Rome, five."</p>

  <p>"Five let it be," said one in answer.</p>

  <p>There was a sharp cheer&mdash;a commotion&mdash;and Messala himself
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Five let it be," he said.</p>

  <p>And Sanballat smiled, and made ready to write.</p>

  <p>"If Caesar die to-morrow," he said, "Rome will not be all bereft. There is
  at least one other with spirit to take his place. Give me six."</p>

  <p>"Six be it," answered Messala.</p>

  <p>There was another shout louder than the first.</p>

  <p>"Six be it," repeated Messala. "Six to one&mdash;the difference between a
  Roman and a Jew. And, having found it, now, O redemptor of the flesh of
  swine, let us on. The amount&mdash;and quickly. The consul may send for thee,
  and I will then be bereft."</p>

  <p>Sanballat took the laugh against him coolly, and wrote, and offered the
  writing to Messala.</p>

  <p>"Read, read!" everybody demanded.</p>

  <p>And Messala read:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Mem.&mdash;Chariot-race. Messala of Rome, in wager with
  Sanballat, also of Rome, says he will beat Ben-Hur, the Jew. Amount of wager,
  twenty talents. Odds to Sanballat, six to one.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Witnesses: SANBALLAT."</p><br>

  <p>There was no noise, no motion. Each person seemed held in the pose the
  reading found him. Messala stared at the memorandum, while the eyes which had
  him in view opened wide, and stared at him. He felt the gaze, and thought
  rapidly. So lately he stood in the same place, and in the same way hectored
  the countrymen around him. They would remember it. If he refused to sign, his
  hero-ship was lost. And sign he could not; he was not worth one hundred
  talents, nor the fifth part of the sum. Suddenly his mind became a blank; he
  stood speechless; the color fled his face. An idea at last came to his
  relief.</p>

  <p>"Thou Jew!" he said, "where hast thou twenty talents? Show me."</p>

  <p>Sanballat's provoking smile deepened.</p>

  <p>"There," he replied, offering Messala a paper.</p>

  <p>"Read, read!" arose all around.</p>

  <p>Again Messala read:</p>

  <p class="letter">"AT ANTIOCH, Tammuz 16th day.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The bearer, Sanballat of Rome, hath now to his order with
  me fifty talents, coin of Caesar.</p>

  <p class="letter">SIMONIDES."</p><br>

  <p>"Fifty talents, fifty talents!" echoed the throng, in amazement.</p>

  <p>Then Drusus came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" he shouted, "the paper lies, and the Jew is a liar. Who but
  Caesar hath fifty talents at order? Down with the insolent white!"</p>

  <p>The cry was angry, and it was angrily repeated; yet Sanballat kept his
  seat, and his smile grew more exasperating the longer he waited. At length
  Messala spoke.</p>

  <p>"Hush! One to one, my countrymen&mdash;one to one, for love of our ancient
  Roman name."</p>

  <p>The timely action recovered him his ascendancy.</p>

  <p>"O thou circumcised dog!" he continued, to Sanballat, "I gave thee six to
  one, did I not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Jew, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, give me now the fixing of the amount."</p>

  <p>"With reserve, if the amount be trifling, have thy will," answered
  Sanballat.</p>

  <p>"Write, then, five in place of twenty."</p>

  <p>"Hast thou so much?"</p>

  <p>"By the mother of the gods, I will show you receipts."</p>

  <p>"Nay, the word of so brave a Roman must pass. Only make the sum
  even&mdash;six make it, and I will write."</p>

  <p>"Write it so."</p>

  <p>And forthwith they exchanged writings.</p>

  <p>Sanballat immediately arose and looked around him, a sneer in place of his
  smile. No man better than he knew those with whom he was dealing.</p>

  <p>"Romans," he said, "another wager, if you dare! Five talents against five
  talents that the white will win. I challenge you collectively."</p>

  <p>They were again surprised.</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried, louder. "Shall it be said in the Circus to-morrow that a
  dog of Israel went into the saloon of the palace full of Roman
  nobles&mdash;among them the scion of a Caesar&mdash;and laid five talents
  before them in challenge, and they had not the courage to take it up?"</p>

  <p>The sting was unendurable.</p>

  <p>"Have done, O insolent!" said Drusus, "write the challenge, and leave it
  on the table; and to-morrow, if we find thou hast indeed so much money to put
  at such hopeless hazard, I, Drusus, promise it shall be taken."</p>

  <p>Sanballat wrote again, and, rising, said, unmoved as ever, "See, Drusus, I
  leave the offer with you. When it is signed, send it to me any time before
  the race begins. I will be found with the consul in a seat over the Porta
  Pompae. Peace to you; peace to all."</p>

  <p>He bowed, and departed, careless of the shout of derision with which they
  pursued him out of the door.</p>

  <p>In the night the story of the prodigious wager flew along the streets and
  over the city; and Ben-Hur, lying with his four, was told of it, and also
  that Messala's whole fortune was on the hazard.</p>

  <p>And he slept never so soundly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch512"
     name="ch512"></a>XII. &mdash; THE CIRCUS</h2>

  <p class="first">The Circus at Antioch stood on the south bank of the river,
  nearly opposite the island, differing in no respect from the plan of such
  buildings in general.</p>

  <p>In the purest sense, the games were a gift to the public; consequently,
  everybody was free to attend; and, vast as the holding capacity of the
  structure was, so fearful were the people, on this occasion, lest there
  should not be room for them, that, early the day before the opening of the
  exhibition, they took up all the vacant spaces in the vicinity, where their
  temporary shelter suggested an army in waiting.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  <div align="center">
    <br>
    <img src="1306331h-images/BenHur-11.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">A procession of extraordinary splendor.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>At midnight the entrances were thrown wide, and the rabble, surging in,
  occupied the quarters assigned to them, from which nothing less than an
  earthquake or an army with spears could have dislodged them. They dozed the
  night away on the benches, and breakfasted there; and there the close of the
  exercises found them, patient and sight-hungry as in the beginning.</p>

  <p>The better people, their seats secured, began moving towards the Circus
  about the first hour of the morning, the noble and very rich among them
  distinguished by litters and retinues of liveried servants.</p>

  <p>By the second hour, the efflux from the city was a stream unbroken and
  innumerable.</p>

  <p>Exactly as the gnomon of the official dial up in the citadel pointed the
  second hour half gone, the legion, in full panoply, and with all its
  standards on exhibit, descended from Mount Sulpius; and when the rear of the
  last cohort disappeared in the bridge, Antioch was literally
  abandoned&mdash;not that the Circus could hold the multitude, but that the
  multitude was gone out to it, nevertheless.</p>

  <p>A great concourse on the river shore witnessed the consul come over from
  the island in a barge of state. As the great man landed, and was received by
  the legion, the martial show for one brief moment transcended the attraction
  of the Circus.</p>

  <p>At the third hour, the audience, if such it may be termed, was assembled;
  at last, a flourish of trumpets called for silence, and instantly the gaze of
  over a hundred thousand persons was directed towards a pile forming the
  eastern section of the building.</p>

  <p>There was a basement first, broken in the middle by a broad arched
  passage, called the Porta Pompae, over which, on an elevated tribunal
  magnificently decorated with insignia and legionary standards, the consul sat
  in the place of honor. On both sides of the passage the basement was divided
  into stalls termed carceres, each protected in front by massive gates swung
  to statuesque pilasters. Over the stalls next was a cornice crowned by a low
  balustrade; back of which the seats arose in theatre arrangement, all
  occupied by a throng of dignitaries superbly attired. The pile extended the
  width of the Circus, and was flanked on both sides by towers which, besides
  helping the architects give grace to their work, served the velaria, or
  purple awnings, stretched between them so as to throw the whole quarter in a
  shade that became exceedingly grateful as the day advanced.</p>

  <p>This structure, it is now thought, can be made useful in helping the
  reader to a sufficient understanding of the arrangement of the rest of the
  interior of the Circus. He has only to fancy himself seated on the tribunal
  with the consul, facing to the west, where everything is under his eye.</p>

  <p>On the right and left, if he will look, he will see the main entrances,
  very ample, and guarded by gates hinged to the towers.</p>

  <p>Directly below him is the arena&mdash;a level plane of considerable
  extent, covered with fine white sand. There all the trials will take place
  except the running.</p>

  <p>Looking across this sanded arena westwardly still, there is a pedestal of
  marble supporting three low conical pillars of gray stone, much carven. Many
  an eye will hunt for those pillars before the day is done, for they are the
  first goal, and mark the beginning and end of the race-course. Behind the
  pedestal, leaving a passage-way and space for an altar, commences a wall ten
  or twelve feet in breadth and five or six in height, extending thence exactly
  two hundred yards, or one Olympic stadium. At the farther, or westward,
  extremity of the wall there is another pedestal, surmounted with pillars
  which mark the second goal.</p>

  <p>The racers will enter the course on the right of the first goal, and keep
  the wall all the time to their left. The beginning and ending points of the
  contest lie, consequently, directly in front of the consul across the arena;
  and for that reason his seat was admittedly the most desirable in the
  Circus.</p>

  <p>Now if the reader, who is still supposed to be seated on the consular
  tribunal over the Porta Pompae, will look up from the ground arrangement of
  the interior, the first point to attract his notice will be the marking of
  the outer boundary-line of the course&mdash;that is, a plain-faced, solid
  wall, fifteen or twenty feet in height, with a balustrade on its cope, like
  that over the carceres, or stalls, in the east. This balcony, if followed
  round the course, will be found broken in three places to allow passages of
  exit and entrance, two in the north and one in the west; the latter very
  ornate, and called the Gate of Triumph, because, when all is over, the
  victors will pass out that way, crowned, and with triumphal escort and
  ceremonies.</p>

  <p>At the west end the balcony encloses the course in the form of a half
  circle, and is made to uphold two great galleries.</p>

  <p>Directly behind the balustrade on the coping of the balcony is the first
  seat, from which ascend the succeeding benches, each higher than the one in
  front of it; giving to view a spectacle of surpassing interest&mdash;the
  spectacle of a vast space ruddy and glistening with human faces, and rich
  with varicolored costumes.</p>

  <p>The commonalty occupy quarters over in the west, beginning at the point of
  termination of an awning, stretched, it would seem, for the accommodation of
  the better classes exclusively.</p>

  <p>Having thus the whole interior of the Circus under view at the moment of
  the sounding of the trumpets, let the reader next imagine the multitude
  seated and sunk to sudden silence, and motionless in its intensity of
  interest.</p>

  <p>Out of the Porta Pompae over in the east rises a sound mixed of voices and
  instruments harmonized. Presently, forth issues the chorus of the procession
  with which the celebration begins; the editor and civic authorities of the
  city, givers of the games, follow in robes and garlands; then the gods, some
  on platforms borne by men, others in great four-wheel carriages gorgeously
  decorated; next them, again, the contestants of the day, each in costume
  exactly as he will run, wrestle, leap, box, or drive.</p>

  <p>Slowly crossing the arena, the procession proceeds to make circuit of the
  course. The display is beautiful and imposing. Approval runs before it in a
  shout, as the water rises and swells in front of a boat in motion. If the
  dumb, figured gods make no sign of appreciation of the welcome, the editor
  and his associates are not so backward.</p>

  <p>The reception of the athletes is even more demonstrative, for there is not
  a man in the assemblage who has not something in wager upon them, though but
  a mite or farthing. And it is noticeable, as the classes move by, that the
  favorites among them are speedily singled out: either their names are loudest
  in the uproar, or they are more profusely showered with wreaths and garlands
  tossed to them from the balcony.</p>

  <p>If there is a question as to the popularity with the public of the several
  games, it is now put to rest. To the splendor of the chariots and the
  superexcellent beauty of the horses, the charioteers add the personality
  necessary to perfect the charm of their display. Their tunics, short,
  sleeveless, and of the finest woollen texture, are of the assigned colors. A
  horseman accompanies each one of them except Ben-Hur, who, for some
  reason&mdash;possibly distrust&mdash;has chosen to go alone; so, too, they
  are all helmeted but him. As they approach, the spectators stand upon the
  benches, and there is a sensible deepening of the clamor, in which a sharp
  listener may detect the shrill piping of women and children; at the same
  time, the things roseate flying from the balcony thicken into a storm, and,
  striking the men, drop into the chariot-beds, which are threatened with
  filling to the tops. Even the horses have a share in the ovation; nor may it
  be said they are less conscious than their masters of the honors they
  receive.</p>

  <p>Very soon, as with the other contestants, it is made apparent that some of
  the drivers are more in favor than others; and then the discovery follows
  that nearly every individual on the benches, women and children as well as
  men, wears a color, most frequently a ribbon upon the breast or in the hair:
  now it is green, now yellow, now blue; but, searching the great body
  carefully, it is manifest that there is a preponderance of white, and scarlet
  and gold.</p>

  <p>In a modern assemblage called together as this one is, particularly where
  there are sums at hazard upon the race, a preference would be decided by the
  qualities or performance of the horses; here, however, nationality was the
  rule. If the Byzantine and Sidonian found small support, it was because their
  cities were scarcely represented on the benches. On their side, the Greeks,
  though very numerous, were divided between the Corinthian and the Athenian,
  leaving but a scant showing of green and yellow. Messala's scarlet and gold
  would have been but little better had not the citizens of Antioch,
  proverbially a race of courtiers, joined the Romans by adopting the color of
  their favorite. There were left then the country people, or Syrians, the
  Jews, and the Arabs; and they, from faith in the blood of the sheik's four,
  blent largely with hate of the Romans, whom they desired, above all things,
  to see beaten and humbled, mounted the white, making the most noisy, and
  probably the most numerous, faction of all.</p>

  <p>As the charioteers move on in the circuit, the excitement increases; at
  the second goal, where, especially in the galleries, the white is the ruling
  color, the people exhaust their flowers and rive the air with screams.</p>

  <p>"Messala! Messala!"</p>

  <p>"Ben-Hur! Ben-Hur!"</p>

  <p>Such are the cries.</p>

  <p>Upon the passage of the procession, the factionists take their seats and
  resume conversation.</p>

  <p>"Ah, by Bacchus! was he not handsome?" exclaims a woman, whose Romanism is
  betrayed by the colors flying in her hair.</p>

  <p>"And how splendid his chariot!" replies a neighbor, of the same
  proclivities. "It is all ivory and gold. Jupiter grant he wins!"</p>

  <p>The notes on the bench behind them were entirely different.</p>

  <p>"A hundred shekels on the Jew!"</p>

  <p>The voice is high and shrill.</p>

  <p>"Nay, be thou not rash," whispers a moderating friend to the speaker. "The
  children of Jacob are not much given to Gentile sports, which are too often
  accursed in the sight of the Lord."</p>

  <p>"True, but saw you ever one more cool and assured? And what an arm he
  has!"</p>

  <p>"And what horses!" says a third.</p>

  <p>"And for that," a fourth one adds, "they say he has all the tricks of the
  Romans."</p>

  <p>A woman completes the eulogium:</p>

  <p>"Yes, and he is even handsomer than the Roman."</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, the enthusiast shrieks again, "A hundred shekels on the
  Jew!"</p>

  <p>"Thou fool!" answers an Antiochian, from a bench well forward on the
  balcony. "Knowest thou not there are fifty talents laid against him, six to
  one, on Messala? Put up thy shekels, lest Abraham rise and smite thee."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! thou ass of Antioch! Cease thy bray. Knowest thou not it was
  Messala betting on himself?"</p>

  <p>Such the reply.</p>

  <p>And so ran the controversy, not always good-natured.</p>

  <p>When at length the march was ended and the Porta Pompae received back the
  procession, Ben-Hur knew he had his prayer.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the East were upon his contest with Messala.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch513"
     name="ch513"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE START</h2>

  <p class="first">About three o'clock, speaking in modern style, the program
  was concluded except the chariot-race. The editor, wisely considerate of the
  comfort of the people, chose that time for a recess. At once the vomitoria
  were thrown open, and all who could hastened to the portico outside where the
  restaurateurs had their quarters. Those who remained yawned, talked,
  gossiped, consulted their tablets, and, all distinctions else forgotten,
  merged into but two classes&mdash;the winners, who were happy, and the
  losers, who were grum and captious.</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Ben-Hur and Messala before the race.</p><br>

  <p>Now, however, a third class of spectators, composed of citizens who
  desired only to witness the chariot-race, availed themselves of the recess to
  come in and take their reserved seats; by so doing they thought to attract
  the least attention and give the least offence. Among these were Simonides
  and his party, whose places were in the vicinity of the main entrance on the
  north side, opposite the consul.</p>

  <p>As the four stout servants carried the merchant in his chair up the aisle,
  curiosity was much excited. Presently some one called his name. Those about
  caught it and passed it on along the benches to the west; and there was
  hurried climbing on seats to get sight of the man about whom common report
  had coined and put in circulation a romance so mixed of good fortune and bad
  that the like had never been known or heard of before.</p>

  <p>Ilderim was also recognized and warmly greeted; but nobody knew Balthasar
  or the two women who followed him closely veiled.</p>

  <p>The people made way for the party respectfully, and the ushers seated them
  in easy speaking distance of each other down by the balustrade overlooking
  the arena. In providence of comfort, they sat upon cushions and had stools
  for footrests.</p>

  <p>The women were Iras and Esther.</p>

  <p>Upon being seated, the latter cast a frightened look over the Circus, and
  drew the veil closer about her face; while the Egyptian, letting her veil
  fall upon her shoulders, gave herself to view, and gazed at the scene with
  the seeming unconsciousness of being stared at, which, in a woman, is usually
  the result of long social habitude.</p>

  <p>The new-comers generally were yet making their first examination of the
  great spectacle, beginning with the consul and his attendants, when some
  workmen ran in and commenced to stretch a chalked rope across the arena from
  balcony to balcony in front of the pillars of the first goal.</p>

  <p>About the same time, also, six men came in through the Porta Pompae and
  took post, one in front of each occupied stall; whereat there was a prolonged
  hum of voices in every quarter.</p>

  <p>"See, see! The green goes to number four on the right; the Athenian is
  there."</p>

  <p>"And Messala&mdash;yes, he is in number two."</p>

  <p>"The Corinthian&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Watch the white! See, he crosses over, he stops; number one it
  is&mdash;number one on the left."</p>

  <p>"No, the black stops there, and the white at number two."</p>

  <p>"So it is."</p>

  <p>These gate-keepers, it should be understood, were dressed in tunics
  colored like those of the competing charioteers; so, when they took their
  stations, everybody knew the particular stall in which his favorite was that
  moment waiting.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see Messala?" the Egyptian asked Esther.</p>

  <p>The Jewess shuddered as she answered no. If not her father's enemy, the
  Roman was Ben-Hur's.</p>

  <p>"He is beautiful as Apollo."</p>

  <p>As Iras spoke, her large eyes brightened and she shook her jeweled fan.
  Esther looked at her with the thought, "Is he, then, so much handsomer than
  Ben-Hur?" Next moment she heard Ilderim say to her father, "Yes, his stall is
  number two on the left of the Porta Pompae;" and, thinking it was of Ben-Hur
  he spoke, her eyes turned that way. Taking but the briefest glance at the
  wattled face of the gate, she drew the veil close and muttered a little
  prayer.</p>

  <p>Presently Sanballat came to the party.</p>

  <p>"I am just from the stalls, O sheik," he said, bowing gravely to Ilderim,
  who began combing his beard, while his eyes glittered with eager inquiry.
  "The horses are in perfect condition."</p>

  <p>Ilderim replied simply, "If they are beaten, I pray it be by some other
  than Messala."</p>

  <p>Turning then to Simonides, Sanballat drew out a tablet, saying, "I bring
  you also something of interest. I reported, you will remember, the wager
  concluded with Messala last night, and stated that I left another which, if
  taken, was to be delivered to me in writing to-day before the race began.
  Here it is."</p>

  <p>Simonides took the tablet and read the memorandum carefully.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "their emissary came to ask me if you had so much money
  with me. Keep the tablet close. If you lose, you know where to come; if you
  win"&mdash;his face knit hard&mdash;"if you win&mdash;ah, friend, see to it!
  See the signers escape not; hold them to the last shekel. That is what they
  would with us."</p>

  <p>"Trust me," replied the purveyor.</p>

  <p>"Will you not sit with us?" asked Simonides.</p>

  <p>"You are very good," the other returned; "but if I leave the consul, young
  Rome yonder will boil over. Peace to you; peace to all."</p>

  <p>At length the recess came to an end.</p>

  <p>The trumpeters blew a call at which the absentees rushed back to their
  places. At the same time, some attendants appeared in the arena, and,
  climbing upon the division wall, went to an entablature near the second goal
  at the west end, and placed upon it seven wooden balls; then returning to the
  first goal, upon an entablature there they set up seven other pieces of wood
  hewn to represent dolphins.</p>

  <p>"What shall they do with the balls and fishes, O sheik?" asked
  Balthasar.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou never attended a race?"</p>

  <p>"Never before; and hardly know I why I am here."</p>

  <p>"Well, they are to keep the count. At the end of each round run thou shalt
  see one ball and one fish taken down."</p>

  <p>The preparations were now complete, and presently a trumpeter in gaudy
  uniform arose by the editor, ready to blow the signal of commencement
  promptly at his order. Straightway the stir of the people and the hum of
  their conversation died away. Every face near-by, and every face in the
  lessening perspective, turned to the east, as all eyes settled upon the gates
  of the six stalls which shut in the competitors.</p>

  <p>The unusual flush upon his face gave proof that even Simonides had caught
  the universal excitement. Ilderim pulled his beard fast and furious.</p>

  <p>"Look now for the Roman," said the fair Egyptian to Esther, who did not
  hear her, for, with close-drawn veil and beating heart, she sat watching for
  Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>The structure containing the stalls, it should be observed, was in form of
  the segment of a circle, retired on the right so that its central point was
  projected forward, and midway the course, on the starting side of the first
  goal. Every stall, consequently, was equally distant from the starting-line
  or chalked rope above mentioned.</p>

  <p>The trumpet sounded short and sharp; whereupon the starters, one for each
  chariot, leaped down from behind the pillars of the goal, ready to give
  assistance if any of the fours proved unmanageable.</p>

  <p>Again the trumpet blew, and simultaneously the gate-keepers threw the
  stalls open.</p>

  <p>First appeared the mounted attendants of the charioteers, five in all,
  Ben-Hur having rejected the service. The chalked line was lowered to let them
  pass, then raised again. They were beautifully mounted, yet scarcely observed
  as they rode forward; for all the time the trampling of eager horses, and the
  voices of drivers scarcely less eager, were heard behind in the stalls, so
  that one might not look away an instant from the gaping doors.</p>

    <p class="caption">The chariot race begins.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The chalked line up again, the gate-keepers called their men; instantly
  the ushers on the balcony waved their hands, and shouted with all their
  strength, "Down! down!"</p>

  <p>As well have whistled to stay a storm.</p>

  <p>Forth from each stall, like missiles in a volley from so many great guns,
  rushed the six fours; and up the vast assemblage arose, electrified and
  irrepressible, and, leaping upon the benches, filled the Circus and the air
  above it with yells and screams. This was the time for which they had so
  patiently waited!&mdash;this the moment of supreme interest treasured up in
  talk and dreams since the proclamation of the games!</p>

  <p>"He is come&mdash;there&mdash;look!" cried Iras, pointing to Messala.</p>

  <p>"I see him," answered Esther, looking at Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>The veil was withdrawn. For an instant the little Jewess was brave. An
  idea of the joy there is in doing an heroic deed under the eyes of a
  multitude came to her, and she understood ever after how, at such times, the
  souls of men, in the frenzy of performance, laugh at death or forget it
  utterly.</p>

  <p>The competitors were now under view from nearly every part of the Circus,
  yet the race was not begun; they had first to make the chalked line
  successfully.</p>

  <p>The line was stretched for the purpose of equalizing the start. If it were
  dashed upon, discomfiture of man and horses might be apprehended; on the
  other hand, to approach it timidly was to incur the hazard of being thrown
  behind in the beginning of the race; and that was certain forfeit of the
  great advantage always striven for&mdash;the position next the division wall
  on the inner line of the course.</p>

  <p>This trial, its perils and consequences, the spectators knew thoroughly;
  and if the opinion of old Nestor, uttered that time he handed the reins to
  his son, were true&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is not strength, but art, obtained the prize, And to be swift is less
  than to be wise"&mdash;</p>

  <p>all on the benches might well look for warning of the winner to be now
  given, justifying the interest with which they breathlessly watched for the
  result.</p>

  <p>The arena swam in a dazzle of light; yet each driver looked first thing
  for the rope, then for the coveted inner line. So, all six aiming at the same
  point and speeding furiously, a collision seemed inevitable; nor that merely.
  What if the editor, at the last moment, dissatisfied with the start, should
  withhold the signal to drop the rope? Or if he should not give it in
  time?</p>

    <p class="caption">A scene from the chariot race. Ben-Hur whips his
    horses.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The crossing was about two hundred and fifty feet in width. Quick the eye,
  steady the hand, unerring the judgment required. If now one look away! or his
  mind wander! or a rein slip! And what attraction in the ensemble of the
  thousands over the spreading balcony! Calculating upon the natural impulse to
  give one glance&mdash;just one&mdash;in sooth of curiosity or vanity, malice
  might be there with an artifice; while friendship and love, did they serve
  the same result, might be as deadly as malice.</p>

  <p>The divine last touch in perfecting the beautiful is animation. Can we
  accept the saying, then these latter days, so tame in pastime and dull in
  sports, have scarcely anything to compare to the spectacle offered by the six
  contestants. Let the reader try to fancy it; let him first look down upon the
  arena, and see it glistening in its frame of dull-gray granite walls; let him
  then, in this perfect field, see the chariots, light of wheel, very graceful,
  and ornate as paint and burnishing can make them&mdash;Messala's rich with
  ivory and gold; let him see the drivers, erect and statuesque, undisturbed by
  the motion of the cars, their limbs naked, and fresh and ruddy with the
  healthful polish of the baths&mdash;in their right hands goads, suggestive of
  torture dreadful to the thought&mdash;in their left hands, held in careful
  separation, and high, that they may not interfere with view of the steeds,
  the reins passing taut from the fore ends of the carriage-poles; let him see
  the fours, chosen for beauty as well as speed; let him see them in
  magnificent action, their masters not more conscious of the situation and all
  that is asked and hoped from them&mdash;their heads tossing, nostrils in
  play, now distent, now contracted&mdash;limbs too dainty for the sand which
  they touch but to spurn&mdash;limbs slender, yet with impact crushing as
  hammers&mdash;every muscle of the rounded bodies instinct with glorious life,
  swelling, diminishing, justifying the world in taking from them its ultimate
  measure of force; finally, along with chariots, drivers, horses, let the
  reader see the accompanying shadows fly; and, with such distinctness as the
  picture comes, he may share the satisfaction and deeper pleasure of those to
  whom it was a thrilling fact, not a feeble fancy. Every age has its plenty of
  sorrows; Heaven help where there are no pleasures!</p>

  <p>The competitors having started each on the shortest line for the position
  next the wall, yielding would be like giving up the race; and who dared
  yield? It is not in common nature to change a purpose in mid-career; and the
  cries of encouragement from the balcony were indistinguishable and
  indescribable: a roar which had the same effect upon all the drivers.</p>

  <p>The fours neared the rope together. Then the trumpeter by the editor's
  side blew a signal vigorously. Twenty feet away it was not heard. Seeing the
  action, however, the judges dropped the rope, and not an instant too soon,
  for the hoof of one of Messala's horses struck it as it fell. Nothing
  daunted, the Roman shook out his long lash, loosed the reins, leaned forward,
  and, with a triumphant shout, took the wall.</p>

  <p>"Jove with us! Jove with us!" yelled all the Roman faction, in a frenzy of
  delight.</p>

  <p>As Messala turned in, the bronze lion's head at the end of his axle caught
  the fore-leg of the Athenian's right-hand trace-mate, flinging the brute over
  against its yoke-fellow. Both staggered, struggled, and lost their headway.
  The ushers had their will at least in part. The thousands held their breath
  with horror; only up where the consul sat was there shouting.</p>

  <p>"Jove with us!" screamed Drusus, frantically.</p>

  <p>"He wins! Jove with us!" answered his associates, seeing Messala speed
  on.</p>

  <p>Tablet in hand, Sanballat turned to them; a crash from the course below
  stopped his speech, and he could not but look that way.</p>

  <p>Messala having passed, the Corinthian was the only contestant on the
  Athenian's right, and to that side the latter tried to turn his broken four;
  and then; as ill-fortune would have it, the wheel of the Byzantine, who was
  next on the left, struck the tail-piece of his chariot, knocking his feet
  from under him. There was a crash, a scream of rage and fear, and the
  unfortunate Cleanthes fell under the hoofs of his own steeds: a terrible
  sight, against which Esther covered her eyes.</p>

  <p>On swept the Corinthian, on the Byzantine, on the Sidonian.</p>

  <p>Sanballat looked for Ben-Hur, and turned again to Drusus and his
  coterie.</p>

  <p>"A hundred sestertii on the Jew!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Taken!" answered Drusus.</p>

  <p>"Another hundred on the Jew!" shouted Sanballat.</p>

  <p>Nobody appeared to hear him. He called again; the situation below was too
  absorbing, and they were too busy shouting, "Messala! Messala! Jove with
  us!"</p>

  <p>When the Jewess ventured to look again, a party of workmen were removing
  the horses and broken car; another party were taking off the man himself; and
  every bench upon which there was a Greek was vocal with execrations and
  prayers for vengeance. Suddenly she dropped her hands; Ben-Hur, unhurt, was
  to the front, coursing freely forward along with the Roman! Behind them, in a
  group, followed the Sidonian, the Corinthian, and the Byzantine.</p>

  <p>The race was on; the souls of the racers were in it; over them bent the
  myriads.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch514"
     name="ch514"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE RACE</h2>

  <p class="first">When the dash for position began, Ben-Hur, as we have seen,
  was on the extreme left of the six. For a moment, like the others, he was
  half blinded by the light in the arena; yet he managed to catch sight of his
  antagonists and divine their purpose. At Messala, who was more than an
  antagonist to him, he gave one searching look. The air of passionless hauteur
  characteristic of the fine patrician face was there as of old, and so was the
  Italian beauty, which the helmet rather increased; but more&mdash;it may have
  been a jealous fancy, or the effect of the brassy shadow in which the
  features were at the moment cast, still the Israelite thought he saw the soul
  of the man as through a glass, darkly: cruel, cunning, desperate; not so
  excited as determined&mdash;a soul in a tension of watchfulness and fierce
  resolve.</p>

  <p>In a time not longer than was required to turn to his four again, Ben-Hur
  felt his own resolution harden to a like temper. At whatever cost, at all
  hazards, he would humble this enemy! Prize, friends, wagers,
  honor&mdash;everything that can be thought of as a possible interest in the
  race was lost in the one deliberate purpose. Regard for life even should not
  hold him back. Yet there was no passion, on his part; no blinding rush of
  heated blood from heart to brain, and back again; no impulse to fling himself
  upon Fortune: he did not believe in Fortune; far otherwise. He had his plan,
  and, confiding in himself, he settled to the task never more observant, never
  more capable. The air about him seemed aglow with a renewed and perfect
  transparency.</p>

  <p>When not half-way across the arena, he saw that Messala's rush would, if
  there was no collision, and the rope fell, give him the wall; that the rope
  would fall, he ceased as soon to doubt; and, further, it came to him, a
  sudden flash-like insight, that Messala knew it was to be let drop at the
  last moment (prearrangement with the editor could safely reach that point in
  the contest); and it suggested, what more Roman-like than for the official to
  lend himself to a countryman who, besides being so popular, had also so much
  at stake? There could be no other accounting for the confidence with which
  Messala pushed his four forward the instant his competitors were prudentially
  checking their fours in front of the obstruction&mdash;no other except
  madness.</p>

  <p>It is one thing to see a necessity and another to act upon it. Ben-Hur
  yielded the wall for the time.</p>

  <p>The rope fell, and all the fours but his sprang into the course under
  urgency of voice and lash. He drew head to the right, and, with all the speed
  of his Arabs, darted across the trails of his opponents, the angle of
  movement being such as to lose the least time and gain the greatest possible
  advance. So, while the spectators were shivering at the Athenian's mishap,
  and the Sidonian, Byzantine, and Corinthian were striving, with such skill as
  they possessed, to avoid involvement in the ruin, Ben-Hur swept around and
  took the course neck and neck with Messala, though on the outside. The
  marvellous skill shown in making the change thus from the extreme left across
  to the right without appreciable loss did not fail the sharp eyes upon the
  benches; the Circus seemed to rock and rock again with prolonged applause.
  Then Esther clasped her hands in glad surprise; then Sanballat, smiling,
  offered his hundred sestertii a second time without a taker; and then the
  Romans began to doubt, thinking Messala might have found an equal, if not a
  master, and that in an Israelite!</p>

  <p>And now, racing together side by side, a narrow interval between them, the
  two neared the second goal.</p>

  <p><a id="pic17"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur's quadriga in full gallop.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The pedestal of the three pillars there, viewed from the west, was a stone
  wall in the form of a half-circle, around which the course and opposite
  balcony were bent in exact parallelism. Making this turn was considered in
  all respects the most telling test of a charioteer; it was, in fact, the very
  feat in which Oraetes failed. As an involuntary admission of interest on the
  part of the spectators, a hush fell over all the Circus, so that for the
  first time in the race the rattle and clang of the cars plunging after the
  tugging steeds were distinctly heard. Then, it would seem, Messala observed
  Ben-Hur, and recognized him; and at once the audacity of the man flamed out
  in an astonishing manner.</p>

  <p>"Down Eros, up Mars!" he shouted, whirling his lash with practised
  hand&mdash;"Down Eros, up Mars!" he repeated, and caught the well-doing Arabs
  of Ben-Hur a cut the like of which they had never known.</p>

  <p>The blow was seen in every quarter, and the amazement was universal. The
  silence deepened; up on the benches behind the consul the boldest held his
  breath, waiting for the outcome. Only a moment thus: then, involuntarily,
  down from the balcony, as thunder falls, burst the indignant cry of the
  people.</p>

  <p>The four sprang forward affrighted. No hand had ever been laid upon them
  except in love; they had been nurtured ever so tenderly; and as they grew,
  their confidence in man became a lesson to men beautiful to see. What should
  such dainty natures do under such indignity but leap as from death?</p>

  <p>Forward they sprang as with one impulse, and forward leaped the car. Past
  question, every experience is serviceable to us. Where got Ben-Hur the large
  hand and mighty grip which helped him now so well? Where but from the oar
  with which so long he fought the sea? And what was this spring of the floor
  under his feet to the dizzy eccentric lurch with which in the old time the
  trembling ship yielded to the beat of staggering billows, drunk with their
  power? So he kept his place, and gave the four free rein, and called to them
  in soothing voice, trying merely to guide them round the dangerous turn; and
  before the fever of the people began to abate, he had back the mastery. Nor
  that only: on approaching the first goal, he was again side by side with
  Messala, bearing with him the sympathy and admiration of every one not a
  Roman. So clearly was the feeling shown, so vigorous its manifestation, that
  Messala, with all his boldness, felt it unsafe to trifle further.</p>

  <p>As the cars whirled round the goal, Esther caught sight of Ben-Hur's
  face&mdash;a little pale, a little higher raised, otherwise calm, even
  placid.</p>

  <p>Immediately a man climbed on the entablature at the west end of the
  division wall, and took down one of the conical wooden balls. A dolphin on
  the east entablature was taken down at the same time.</p>

  <p>In like manner, the second ball and second dolphin disappeared.</p>

  <p>And then the third ball and third dolphin.</p>

  <p>Three rounds concluded: still Messala held the inside position; still
  Ben-Hur moved with him side by side; still the other competitors followed as
  before. The contest began to have the appearance of one of the double races
  which became so popular in Rome during the later Caesarean
  period&mdash;Messala and Ben-Hur in the first, the Corinthian, Sidonian, and
  Byzantine in the second. Meantime the ushers succeeded in returning the
  multitude to their seats, though the clamor continued to run the rounds,
  keeping, as it were, even pace with the rivals in the course below.</p>

  <p>In the fifth round the Sidonian succeeded in getting a place outside
  Ben-Hur, but lost it directly.</p>

  <p>The sixth round was entered upon without change of relative position.</p>

  <p>Gradually the speed had been quickened&mdash;gradually the blood of the
  competitors warmed with the work. Men and beasts seemed to know alike that
  the final crisis was near, bringing the time for the winner to assert
  himself.</p>

  <p>The interest which from the beginning had centred chiefly in the struggle
  between the Roman and the Jew, with an intense and general sympathy for the
  latter, was fast changing to anxiety on his account. On all the benches the
  spectators bent forward motionless, except as their faces turned following
  the contestants. Ilderim quitted combing his beard, and Esther forgot her
  fears.</p>

  <p>"A hundred sestertii on the Jew!" cried Sanballat to the Romans under the
  consul's awning.</p>

  <p>There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"A talent&mdash;or five talents, or ten; choose ye!"</p>

  <p>He shook his tablets at them defiantly.</p>

  <p>"I will take thy sestertii," answered a Roman youth, preparing to
  write.</p>

  <p>"Do not so," interposed a friend.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Messala hath reached his utmost speed. See him lean over his chariot rim,
  the reins loose as flying ribbons. Look then at the Jew."</p>

  <p>The first one looked.</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" he replied, his countenance falling. "The dog throws all
  his weight on the bits. I see, I see! If the gods help not our friend, he
  will be run away with by the Israelite. No, not yet. Look! Jove with us, Jove
  with us!"</p>

  <p>The cry, swelled by every Latin tongue, shook the velaria over the
  consul's head.</p>

  <p>If it were true that Messala had attained his utmost speed, the effort was
  with effect; slowly but certainly he was beginning to forge ahead. His horses
  were running with their heads low down; from the balcony their bodies
  appeared actually to skim the earth; their nostrils showed blood red in
  expansion; their eyes seemed straining in their sockets. Certainly the good
  steeds were doing their best! How long could they keep the pace? It was but
  the commencement of the sixth round. On they dashed. As they neared the
  second goal, Ben-Hur turned in behind the Roman's car.</p>

  <p>The joy of the Messala faction reached its bound: they screamed and
  howled, and tossed their colors; and Sanballat filled his tablets with wagers
  of their tendering.</p>

  <p>Malluch, in the lower gallery over the Gate of Triumph, found it hard to
  keep his cheer. He had cherished the vague hint dropped to him by Ben-Hur of
  something to happen in the turning of the western pillars. It was the fifth
  round, yet the something had not come; and he had said to himself, the sixth
  will bring it; but, lo! Ben-Hur was hardly holding a place at the tail of his
  enemy's car.</p>

  <p>Over in the east end, Simonides' party held their peace. The merchant's
  head was bent low. Ilderim tugged at his beard, and dropped his brows till
  there was nothing of his eyes but an occasional sparkle of light. Esther
  scarcely breathed. Iras alone appeared glad.</p>

  <p>Along the home-stretch&mdash;sixth round&mdash;Messala leading, next him
  Ben-Hur, and so close it was the old story:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;<br>
  With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds;<br>
  Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,<br>
  And seem just mounting on his car behind;<br>
  Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze, And, hovering<br>
  o'er, their stretching shadow sees."</p><br>

  <p>Thus to the first goal, and round it. Messala, fearful of losing his
  place, hugged the stony wall with perilous clasp; a foot to the left, and he
  had been dashed to pieces; yet, when the turn was finished, no man, looking
  at the wheel-tracks of the two cars, could have said, here went Messala,
  there the Jew. They left but one trace behind them.</p>

  <p>As they whirled by, Esther saw Ben-Hur's face again, and it was whiter
  than before.</p>

  <p>Simonides, shrewder than Esther, said to Ilderim, the moment the rivals
  turned into the course, "I am no judge, good sheik, if Ben-Hur be not about
  to execute some design. His face hath that look."</p>

  <p>To which Ilderim answered, "Saw you how clean they were and fresh? By the
  splendor of God, friend, they have not been running! But now watch!"</p>

  <p>One ball and one dolphin remained on the entablatures; and all the people
  drew a long breath, for the beginning of the end was at hand.</p>

  <p>First, the Sidonian gave the scourge to his four, and, smarting with fear
  and pain, they dashed desperately forward, promising for a brief time to go
  to the front. The effort ended in promise. Next, the Byzantine and the
  Corinthian each made the trial with like result, after which they were
  practically out of the race. Thereupon, with a readiness perfectly
  explicable, all the factions except the Romans joined hope in Ben-Hur, and
  openly indulged their feeling.</p>

  <p>"Ben-Hur! Ben-Hur!" they shouted, and the blent voices of the many rolled
  overwhelmingly against the consular stand.</p>

  <p>From the benches above him as he passed, the favor descended in fierce
  injunctions.</p>

  <p>"Speed thee, Jew!"</p>

  <p>"Take the wall now!"</p>

  <p>"On! loose the Arabs! Give them rein and scourge!"</p>

  <p>"Let him not have the turn on thee again. Now or never!"</p>

  <p>Over the balustrade they stooped low, stretching their hands imploringly
  to him.</p>

  <p>Either he did not hear, or could not do better, for halfway round the
  course and he was still following; at the second goal even still no
  change!</p>

  <p>And now, to make the turn, Messala began to draw in his left-hand steeds,
  an act which necessarily slackened their speed. His spirit was high; more
  than one altar was richer of his vows; the Roman genius was still president.
  On the three pillars only six hundred feet away were fame, increase of
  fortune, promotions, and a triumph ineffably sweetened by hate, all in store
  for him! That moment Malluch, in the gallery, saw Ben-Hur lean forward over
  his Arabs, and give them the reins. Out flew the many-folded lash in his
  hand; over the backs of the startled steeds it writhed and hissed, and hissed
  and writhed again and again; and though it fell not, there were both sting
  and menace in its quick report; and as the man passed thus from quiet to
  resistless action, his face suffused, his eyes gleaming, along the reins he
  seemed to flash his will; and instantly not one, but the four as one,
  answered with a leap that landed them alongside the Roman's car. Messala, on
  the perilous edge of the goal, heard, but dared not look to see what the
  awakening portended. From the people he received no sign. Above the noises of
  the race there was but one voice, and that was Ben-Hur's. In the old Aramaic,
  as the sheik himself, he called to the Arabs,</p>

  <p>"On, Atair! On, Rigel! What, Antares! dost thou linger now? Good
  horse&mdash;oho, Aldebaran! I hear them singing in the tents. I hear the
  children singing and the women&mdash;singing of the stars, of Atair, Antares,
  Rigel, Aldebaran, victory!&mdash;and the song will never end. Well done! Home
  to-morrow, under the black tent&mdash;home! On, Antares! The tribe is waiting
  for us, and the master is waiting! 'Tis done! 'tis done! Ha, ha! We have
  overthrown the proud. The hand that smote us is in the dust. Ours the glory!
  Ha, ha!&mdash;steady! The work is done&mdash;soho! Rest!"</p>

  <p>There had never been anything of the kind more simple; seldom anything so
  instantaneous.</p>

    <p class="caption">Ben-Hur and Messala race side-by-side.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>At the moment chosen for the dash, Messala was moving in a circle round
  the goal. To pass him, Ben-Hur had to cross the track, and good strategy
  required the movement to be in a forward direction; that is, on a like circle
  limited to the least possible increase. The thousands on the benches
  understood it all: they saw the signal given&mdash;the magnificent response;
  the four close outside Messala's outer wheel; Ben-Hur's inner wheel behind
  the other's car&mdash;all this they saw. Then they heard a crash loud enough
  to send a thrill through the Circus, and, quicker than thought, out over the
  course a spray of shining white and yellow flinders flew. Down on its right
  side toppled the bed of the Roman's chariot. There was a rebound as of the
  axle hitting the hard earth; another and another; then the car went to
  pieces; and Messala, entangled in the reins, pitched forward headlong.</p>

  <p>To increase the horror of the sight by making death certain, the Sidonian,
  who had the wall next behind, could not stop or turn out. Into the wreck full
  speed he drove; then over the Roman, and into the latter's four, all mad with
  fear. Presently, out of the turmoil, the fighting of horses, the resound of
  blows, the murky cloud of dust and sand, he crawled, in time to see the
  Corinthian and Byzantine go on down the course after Ben-Hur, who had not
  been an instant delayed.</p>

  <p>The people arose, and leaped upon the benches, and shouted and screamed.
  Those who looked that way caught glimpses of Messala, now under the trampling
  of the fours, now under the abandoned cars. He was still; they thought him
  dead; but far the greater number followed Ben-Hur in his career. They had not
  seen the cunning touch of the reins by which, turning a little to the left,
  he caught Messala's wheel with the iron-shod point of his axle, and crushed
  it; but they had seen the transformation of the man, and themselves felt the
  heat and glow of his spirit, the heroic resolution, the maddening energy of
  action with which, by look, word, and gesture, he so suddenly inspired his
  Arabs. And such running! It was rather the long leaping of lions in harness;
  but for the lumbering chariot, it seemed the four were flying. When the
  Byzantine and Corinthian were halfway down the course, Ben-Hur turned the
  first goal.</p>

  <p>AND THE RACE WAS WON!</p>

  <p>The consul arose; the people shouted themselves hoarse; the editor came
  down from his seat, and crowned the victors.</p>

  <p>The fortunate man among the boxers was a low-browed, yellow-haired Saxon,
  of such brutalized face as to attract a second look from Ben-Hur, who
  recognized a teacher with whom he himself had been a favorite at Rome. From
  him the young Jew looked up and beheld Simonides and his party on the
  balcony. They waved their hands to him. Esther kept her seat; but Iras arose,
  and gave him a smile and a wave of her fan&mdash;favors not the less
  intoxicating to him because we know, O reader, they would have fallen to
  Messala had he been the victor.</p>

  <p>The procession was then formed, and, midst the shouting of the multitude
  which had had its will, passed out of the Gate of Triumph.</p>

  <p>And the day was over.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch515"
     name="ch515"></a>XV. &mdash; THE INVITATION OF IRAS</h2>

  <p class="first">Ben-Hur tarried across the river with Ilderim; for at
  midnight, as previously determined, they would take the road which the
  caravan, then thirty hours out, had pursued.</p>

  <p>The sheik was happy; his offers of gifts had been royal; but Ben-Hur had
  refused everything, insisting that he was satisfied with the humiliation of
  his enemy. The generous dispute was long continued.</p>

  <p>"Think," the sheik would say, "what thou hast done for me. In every black
  tent down to the Akaba and to the ocean, and across to the Euphrates, and
  beyond to the sea of the Scythians, the renown of my Mira and her children
  will go; and they who sing of them will magnify me, and forget that I am in
  the wane of life; and all the spears now masterless will come to me, and my
  sword-hands multiply past counting. Thou dost not know what it is to have
  sway of the desert such as will now be mine. I tell thee it will bring
  tribute incalculable from commerce, and immunity from kings. Ay, by the sword
  of Solomon! doth my messenger seek favor for me of Caesar, that will he get.
  Yet nothing&mdash;nothing?"</p>

  <p>And Ben-Hur would answer,</p>

  <p>"Nay, sheik, have I not thy hand and heart? Let thy increase of power and
  influence inure to the King who comes. Who shall say it was not allowed thee
  for him? In the work I am going to, I may have great need. Saying no now will
  leave me to ask of thee with better grace hereafter."</p>

  <p>In the midst of a controversy of the kind, two messengers
  arrived&mdash;Malluch and one unknown. The former was admitted first.</p>

  <p>The good fellow did not attempt to hide his joy over the event of the
  day.</p>

  <p>"But, coming to that with which I am charged," he said, "the master
  Simonides sends me to say that, upon the adjournment of the games, some of
  the Roman faction made haste to protest against payment of the money
  prize."</p>

  <p>Ilderim started up, crying, in his shrillest tones,</p>

  <p>"By the splendor of God! the East shall decide whether the race was fairly
  won."</p>

  <p>"Nay, good sheik," said Malluch, "the editor has paid the money."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well."</p>

  <p>"When they said Ben-Hur struck Messala's wheel, the editor laughed, and
  reminded them of the blow the Arabs had at the turn of the goal."</p>

  <p>"And what of the Athenian?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" cried Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" echoed Ilderim. "What fortune these Roman monsters have! Messala
  escaped?"</p>

  <p>"Escaped&mdash;yes, O sheik, with life; but it shall be a burden to him.
  The physicians say he will live, but never walk again."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked silently up to heaven. He had a vision of Messala,
  chairbound like Simonides, and, like him, going abroad on the shoulders of
  servants. The good man had abode well; but what would this one with his pride
  and ambition?</p>

  <p>"Simonides bade me say, further," Malluch continued, "Sanballat is having
  trouble. Drusus, and those who signed with him, referred the question of
  paying the five talents they lost to the Consul Maxentius, and he has
  referred it to Caesar. Messala also refused his losses, and Sanballat, in
  imitation of Drusus, went to the consul, where the matter is still in
  advisement. The better Romans say the protestants shall not be excused; and
  all the adverse factions join with them. The city rings with the
  scandal."</p>

  <p>"What says Simonides?" asked Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"The master laughs, and is well pleased. If the Roman pays, he is ruined;
  if he refuses to pay, he is dishonored. The imperial policy will decide the
  matter. To offend the East would be a bad beginning with the Parthians; to
  offend Sheik Ilderim would be to antagonize the Desert, over which lie all
  Maxentius's lines of operation. Wherefore Simonides bade me tell you to have
  no disquiet; Messala will pay."</p>

  <p>Ilderim was at once restored to his good-humor.</p>

  <p>"Let us be off now," he said, rubbing his hands. "The business will do
  well with Simonides. The glory is ours. I will order the horses."</p>

  <p>"Stay," said Malluch. "I left a messenger outside. Will you see him?"</p>

  <p>"By the splendor of God! I forgot him."</p>

  <p>Malluch retired, and was succeeded by a lad of gentle manners and delicate
  appearance, who knelt upon one knee, and said, winningly, "Iras, the daughter
  of Balthasar, well known to good Sheik Ilderim, hath intrusted me with a
  message to the sheik, who, she saith, will do her great favor so he receive
  her congratulations on account of the victory of his four."</p>

  <p>"The daughter of my friend is kind," said Ilderim, with sparkling eyes.
  "Do thou give her this jewel, in sign of the pleasure I have from her
  message."</p>

  <p>He took a ring from his finger as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I will as thou sayest, O sheik," the lad replied, and continued, "The
  daughter of the Egyptian charged me further. She prays the good Sheik Ilderim
  to send word to the youth Ben-Hur that her father hath taken residence for a
  time in the palace of Idernee, where she will receive the youth after the
  fourth hour to-morrow. And if, with her congratulations, Sheik Ilderim will
  accept her gratitude for this other favor done, she will be ever so
  pleased."</p>

  <p>The sheik looked at Ben-Hur, whose face was suffused with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"What will you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"By your leave, O sheik, I will see the fair Egyptian."</p>

  <p>Ilderim laughed, and said, "Shall not a man enjoy his youth?"</p>

  <p>Then Ben-Hur answered the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Say to her who sent you that I, Ben-Hur, will see her at the palace of
  Idernee, wherever that may be, to-morrow at noon."</p>

  <p>The lad arose, and, with silent salute, departed.</p>

  <p>At midnight Ilderim took the road, having arranged to leave a horse and a
  guide for Ben-Hur, who was to follow him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch516"
     name="ch516"></a>XVI. &mdash; IN THE PALACE OF IDERNEE</h2>

  <p class="first">Going next day to fill his appointment with Iras, Ben-Hur
  turned from the Omphalus, which was in the heart of the city, into the
  Colonnade of Herod, and came shortly to the palace of Idernee.</p>

  <p>From the street he passed first into a vestibule, on the sides of which
  were stairways under cover, leading up to a portico. Winged lions sat by the
  stairs; in the middle there was a gigantic ibis spouting water over the
  floor; the lions, ibis, walls, and floor were reminders of the Egyptians:
  everything, even the balustrading of the stairs, was of massive gray
  stone.</p>

  <p>Above the vestibule, and covering the landing of the steps, arose the
  portico, a pillared grace, so light, so exquisitely proportioned, it was at
  that period hardly possible of conception except by a Greek. Of marble snowy
  white, its effect was that of a lily dropped carelessly upon a great bare
  rock.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur paused in the shade of the portico to admire its tracery and
  finish, and the purity of its marble; then he passed on into the palace.
  Ample folding-doors stood open to receive him. The passage into which he
  first entered was high, but somewhat narrow; red tiling formed the floor, and
  the walls were tinted to correspond. Yet this plainness was a warning of
  something beautiful to come.</p>

  <p>He moved on slowly, all his faculties in repose. Presently he would be in
  the presence of Iras; she was waiting for him; waiting with song and story
  and badinage, sparkling, fanciful, capricious&mdash;with smiles which
  glorified her glance, and glances which lent voluptuous suggestion to her
  whisper. She had sent for him the evening of the boat-ride on the lake in the
  Orchard of Palms; she had sent for him now; and he was going to her in the
  beautiful palace of Idernee. He was happy and dreamful rather than
  thoughtless.</p>

  <p>The passage brought him to a closed door, in front of which he paused;
  and, as he did so, the broad leaves began to open of themselves, without
  creak or sound of lock or latch, or touch of foot or finger. The singularity
  was lost in the view that broke upon him.</p>

  <p>Standing in the shade of the dull passage, and looking through the
  doorway, he beheld the atrium of a Roman house, roomy and rich to a fabulous
  degree of magnificence.</p>

  <p>How large the chamber was cannot be stated, because of the deceit there is
  in exact proportions; its depth was vista-like, something never to be said of
  an equal interior. When he stopped to make survey, and looked down upon the
  floor, he was standing upon the breast of a Leda, represented as caressing a
  swan; and, looking farther, he saw the whole floor was similarly laid in
  mosaic pictures of mythological subjects. And there were stools and chairs,
  each a separate design, and a work of art exquisitely composed, and tables
  much carven, and here and there couches which were invitations of themselves.
  The articles of furniture, which stood out from the walls, were duplicated on
  the floor distinctly as if they floated unrippled water; even the panelling
  of the walls, the figures upon them in painting and bas-relief, and the
  fresco of the ceiling were reflected on the floor. The ceiling curved up
  towards the centre, where there was an opening through which the sunlight
  poured without hindrance, and the sky, ever so blue, seemed in hand-reach;
  the impluvium under the opening was guarded by bronzed rails; the gilded
  pillars supporting the roof at the edges of the opening shone like flame
  where the sun struck them, and their reflections beneath seemed to stretch to
  infinite depth. And there were candelabra quaint and curious, and statuary
  and vases; the whole making an interior that would have befitted well the
  house on the Palatine Hill which Cicero bought of Crassus, or that other, yet
  more famous for extravagance, the Tusculan villa of Scaurus.</p>

  <p>Still in his dreamful mood, Ben-Hur sauntered about, charmed by all he
  beheld, and waiting. He did not mind a little delay; when Iras was ready, she
  would come or send a servant. In every well-regulated Roman house the atrium
  was the reception chamber for visitors.</p>

  <p>Twice, thrice, he made the round. As often he stood under the opening in
  the roof, and pondered the sky and its azure depth; then, leaning against a
  pillar, he studied the distribution of light and shade, and its effects; here
  a veil diminishing objects, there a brilliance exaggerating others; yet
  nobody came. Time, or rather the passage of time, began at length to impress
  itself upon him, and he wondered why Iras stayed so long. Again he traced out
  the figures upon the floor, but not with the satisfaction the first
  inspection gave him. He paused often to listen: directly impatience blew a
  little fevered breath upon his spirit; next time it blew stronger and hotter;
  and at last he woke to a consciousness of the silence which held the house in
  thrall, and the thought of it made him uneasy and distrustful. Still he put
  the feeling off with a smile and a promise. "Oh, she is giving the last touch
  to her eyelids, or she is arranging a chaplet for me; she will come
  presently, more beautiful of the delay!" He sat down then to admire a
  candelabrum&mdash;a bronze plinth on rollers, filigree on the sides and
  edges; the post at one end, and on the end opposite it an altar and a female
  celebrant; the lamp-rests swinging by delicate chains from the extremities of
  drooping palm-branches; altogether a wonder in its way. But the silence would
  obtrude itself: he listened even as he looked at the pretty object&mdash;he
  listened, but there was not a sound; the palace was still as a tomb.</p>

  <p>There might be a mistake. No, the messenger had come from the Egyptian,
  and this was the palace of Idernee. Then he remembered how mysteriously the
  door had opened so soundlessly, so of itself. He would see!</p>

  <p>He went to the same door. Though he walked ever so lightly the sound of
  his stepping was loud and harsh, and he shrank from it. He was getting
  nervous. The cumbrous Roman lock resisted his first effort to raise it; and
  the second&mdash;the blood chilled in his cheeks&mdash;he wrenched with all
  his might: in vain&mdash;the door was not even shaken. A sense of danger
  seized him, and for a moment he stood irresolute.</p>

  <p>Who in Antioch had the motive to do him harm?</p>

  <p>Messala!</p>

  <p>And this palace of Idernee? He had seen Egypt in the vestibule, Athens in
  the snowy portico; but here, in the atrium, was Rome; everything about him
  betrayed Roman ownership. True, the site was on the great thoroughfare of the
  city, a very public place in which to do him violence; but for that reason it
  was more accordant with the audacious genius of his enemy. The atrium
  underwent a change; with all its elegance and beauty, it was no more than a
  trap. Apprehension always paints in black.</p>

  <p>The idea irritated Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>There were many doors on the right and left of the atrium, leading,
  doubtless, to sleeping-chambers; he tried them, but they were all firmly
  fastened. Knocking might bring response. Ashamed to make outcry, he betook
  himself to a couch, and, lying down, tried to reflect.</p>

  <p>All too plainly he was a prisoner; but for what purpose? and by whom?</p>

  <p>If the work were Messala's! He sat up, looked about, and smiled defiantly.
  There were weapons in every table. But birds had been starved in golden
  cages; not so would he&mdash;the couches would serve him as battering-rams;
  and he was strong, and there was such increase of might in rage and
  despair!</p>

  <p>Messala himself could not come. He would never walk again; he was a
  cripple like Simonides; still he could move others. And where were there not
  others to be moved by him? Ben-Hur arose, and tried the doors again. Once he
  called out; the room echoed so that he was startled. With such calmness as he
  could assume, he made up his mind to wait a time before attempting to break a
  way out.</p>

  <p>In such a situation the mind has its ebb and flow of disquiet, with
  intervals of peace between. At length&mdash;how long, though, he could not
  have said&mdash;he came to the conclusion that the affair was an accident or
  mistake. The palace certainly belonged to somebody; it must have care and
  keeping: and the keeper would come; the evening or the night would bring him.
  Patience!</p>

  <p>So concluding, he waited.</p>

  <p>Half an hour passed&mdash;a much longer period to Ben-Hur&mdash;when the
  door which had admitted him opened and closed noiselessly as before, and
  without attracting his attention.</p>

  <p>The moment of the occurrence he was sitting at the farther end of the
  room. A footstep startled him.</p>

  <p>"At last she has come!" he thought, with a throb of relief and pleasure,
  and arose.</p>

  <p>The step was heavy, and accompanied with the gride and clang of coarse
  sandals. The gilded pillars were between him and the door; he advanced
  quietly, and leaned against one of them. Presently he heard voices&mdash;the
  voices of men&mdash;one of them rough and guttural. What was said he could
  not understand, as the language was not of the East or South of Europe.</p>

  <p>After a general survey of the room, the strangers crossed to their left,
  and were brought into Ben-Hur's view&mdash;two men, one very stout, both
  tall, and both in short tunics. They had not the air of masters of the house
  or domestics. Everything they saw appeared wonderful to them; everything they
  stopped to examine they touched. They were vulgarians. The atrium seemed
  profaned by their presence. At the same time, their leisurely manner and the
  assurance with which they proceeded pointed to some right or business; if
  business, with whom?</p>

  <p>With much jargon they sauntered this way and that, all the time gradually
  approaching the pillar by which Ben-Hur was standing. Off a little way, where
  a slanted gleam of the sun fell with a glare upon the mosaic of the floor,
  there was a statue which attracted their notice. In examining it, they
  stopped in the light.</p>

  <p>The mystery surrounding his own presence in the palace tended, as we have
  seen, to make Ben-Hur nervous; so now, when in the tall stout stranger he
  recognized the Northman whom he had known in Rome, and seen crowned only the
  day before in the Circus as the winning pugilist; when he saw the man's face,
  scarred with the wounds of many battles, and imbruted by ferocious passions;
  when he surveyed the fellow's naked limbs, very marvels of exercise and
  training, and his shoulders of Herculean breadth, a thought of personal
  danger started a chill along every vein. A sure instinct warned him that the
  opportunity for murder was too perfect to have come by chance; and here now
  were the myrmidons, and their business was with him. He turned an anxious eye
  upon the Northman's comrade&mdash;young, black-eyed, black-haired, and
  altogether Jewish in appearance; he observed, also, that both the men were in
  costume exactly such as professionals of their class were in the habit of
  wearing in the arena. Putting the several circumstances together, Ben-Hur
  could not be longer in doubt: he had been lured into the palace with design.
  Out of reach of aid, in this splendid privacy, he was to die!</p>

  <p>At a loss what to do, he gazed from man to man, while there was enacted
  within him that miracle of mind by which life is passed before us in awful
  detail, to be looked at by ourselves as if it were another's; and from the
  evolvement, from a hidden depth, cast up, as it were, by a hidden hand, he
  was given to see that he had entered upon a new life, different from the old
  one in this: whereas, in that, he had been the victim of violences done to
  him, henceforth he was to be the aggressor. Only yesterday he had found his
  first victim! To the purely Christian nature the presentation would have
  brought the weakness of remorse. Not so with Ben-Hur; his spirit had its
  emotions from the teachings of the first lawgiver, not the last and greatest
  one. He had dealt punishment, not wrong, to Messala. By permission of the
  Lord, he had triumphed; and he derived faith from the
  circumstance&mdash;faith the source of all rational strength, especially
  strength in peril.</p>

  <p>Nor did the influence stop there. The new life was made appear to him a
  mission just begun, and holy as the King to come was holy, and certain as the
  coming of the King was certain&mdash;a mission in which force was lawful if
  only because it was unavoidable. Should he, on the very threshold of such an
  errand, be afraid?</p>

  <p>He undid the sash around his waist, and, baring his head and casting off
  his white Jewish gown, stood forth in an undertunic not unlike those of the
  enemy, and was ready, body and mind. Folding his arms, he placed his back
  against the pillar, and calmly waited.</p>

  <p>The examination of the statue was brief. Directly the Northman turned, and
  said something in the unknown tongue; then both looked at Ben-Hur. A few more
  words, and they advanced towards him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked, in Latin.</p>

  <p>The Northman fetched a smile which did not relieve his face of its
  brutalism, and answered,</p>

  <p>"Barbarians."</p>

  <p>"This is the palace of Idernee. Whom seek you? Stand and answer."</p>

  <p>The words were spoken with earnestness. The strangers stopped; and in his
  turn the Northman asked, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"A Roman."</p>

  <p>The giant laid his head back upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! I have heard how a god once came from a cow licking a salted
  stone; but not even a god can make a Roman of a Jew."</p>

  <p>The laugh over, he spoke to his companion again, and they moved
  nearer.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" said Ben-Hur, quitting the pillar. "One word."</p>

  <p>They stopped again.</p>

  <p>"A word!" replied the Saxon, folding his immense arms across his breast,
  and relaxing the menace beginning to blacken his face. "A word! Speak."</p>

  <p>"You are Thord the Northman."</p>

  <p>The giant opened his blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"You were lanista in Rome."</p>

  <p>Thord nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was your scholar."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thord, shaking his head. "By the beard of Irmin, I had never a
  Jew to make a fighting-man of."</p>

  <p>"But I will prove my saying."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"You came here to kill me."</p>

  <p>"That is true."</p>

  <p>"Then let this man fight me singly, and I will make the proof on his
  body."</p>

  <p>A gleam of humor shone in the Northman's face. He spoke to his companion,
  who made answer; then he replied with the naivete of a diverted child,</p>

  <p>"Wait till I say begin."</p>

  <p>By repeated touches of his foot, he pushed a couch out on the floor, and
  proceeded leisurely to stretch his burly form upon it; when perfectly at
  ease, he said, simply, "Now begin."</p>

  <p>Without ado, Ben-Hur walked to his antagonist.</p>

  <p>"Defend thyself," he said.</p>

  <p>The man, nothing loath, put up his hands.</p>

  <p>As the two thus confronted each other in approved position, there was no
  discernible inequality between them; on the contrary, they were as like as
  brothers. To the stranger's confident smile, Ben-Hur opposed an earnestness
  which, had his skill been known, would have been accepted fair warning of
  danger. Both knew the combat was to be mortal.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur feinted with his right hand. The stranger warded, slightly
  advancing his left arm. Ere he could return to guard, Ben-Hur caught him by
  the wrist in a grip which years at the oar had made terrible as a vise. The
  surprise was complete, and no time given. To throw himself forward; to push
  the arm across the man's throat and over his right shoulder, and turn him
  left side front; to strike surely with the ready left hand; to strike the
  bare neck under the ear&mdash;were but petty divisions of the same act. No
  need of a second blow. The myrmidon fell heavily, and without a cry, and lay
  still.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur turned to Thord.</p>

  <p>"Ha! What! By the beard of Irmin!" the latter cried, in astonishment,
  rising to a sitting posture. Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! I could not have done it better myself."</p>

  <p>He viewed Ben-Hur coolly from head to foot, and, rising, faced him with
  undisguised admiration.</p>

  <p>"It was my trick&mdash;the trick I have practised for ten years in the
  schools of Rome. You are not a Jew. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"You knew Arrius the duumvir."</p>

  <p>"Quintus Arrius? Yes, he was my patron."</p>

  <p>"He had a son."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thord, his battered features lighting dully, "I knew the boy;
  he would have made a king gladiator. Caesar offered him his patronage. I
  taught him the very trick you played on this one here&mdash;a trick
  impossible except to a hand and arm like mine. It has won me many a
  crown."</p>

  <p>"I am that son of Arrius."</p>

  <p>Thord drew nearer, and viewed him carefully; then his eyes brightened with
  genuine pleasure, and, laughing, he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! He told me I would find a Jew here&mdash;a Jew&mdash;a dog of
  a Jew&mdash;killing whom was serving the gods."</p>

  <p>"Who told you so?" asked Ben-Hur, taking the hand.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;Messala&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"When, Thord?"</p>

  <p>"Last night."</p>

  <p>"I thought he was hurt."</p>

  <p>"He will never walk again. On his bed he told me between groans."</p>

  <p>A very vivid portrayal of hate in a few words; and Ben-Hur saw that the
  Roman, if he lived, would still be capable and dangerous, and follow him
  unrelentingly. Revenge remained to sweeten the ruined life; therefore the
  clinging to fortune lost in the wager with Sanballat. Ben-Hur ran the ground
  over, with a distinct foresight of the many ways in which it would be
  possible for his enemy to interfere with him in the work he had undertaken
  for the King who was coming. Why not he resort to the Roman's methods? The
  man hired to kill him could be hired to strike back. It was in his power to
  offer higher wages. The temptation was strong; and, half yielding, he chanced
  to look down at his late antagonist lying still, with white upturned face, so
  like himself. A light came to him, and he asked, "Thord, what was Messala to
  give you for killing me?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand sestertii."</p>

  <p>"You shall have them yet; and so you do now what I tell you, I will add
  three thousand more to the sum."</p>

  <p>The giant reflected aloud,</p>

  <p>"I won five thousand yesterday; from the Roman one&mdash;six. Give me
  four, good Arrius&mdash;four more&mdash;and I will stand firm for you, though
  old Thor, my namesake, strike me with his hammer. Make it four, and I will
  kill the lying patrician, if you say so. I have only to cover his mouth with
  my hand&mdash;thus."</p>

  <p>He illustrated the process by clapping his hand over his own mouth.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Ben-Hur; "ten thousand sestertii is a fortune. It will
  enable you to return to Rome, and open a wine-shop near the Great Circus, and
  live as becomes the first of the lanistae."</p>

  <p>The very scars on the giant's face glowed afresh with the pleasure the
  picture gave him.</p>

  <p>"I will make it four thousand," Ben-Hur continued; "and in what you shall
  do for the money there will be no blood on your hands, Thord. Hear me now.
  Did not your friend here look like me?"</p>

  <p>"I would have said he was an apple from the same tree."</p>

  <p>"Well, if I put on his tunic, and dress him in these clothes of mine, and
  you and I go away together, leaving him here, can you not get your sestertii
  from Messala all the same? You have only to make him believe it me that is
  dead."</p>

  <p>Thord laughed till the tears ran into his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha! Ten thousand sestertii were never won so easily. And a
  wine-shop by the Great Circus!&mdash;all for a lie without blood in it! Ha,
  ha, ha! Give me thy hand, O son of Arrius. Get on now, and&mdash;ha, ha,
  ha!&mdash;if ever you come to Rome, fail not to ask for the wine-shop of
  Thord the Northman. By the beard of Irmin, I will give you the best, though I
  borrow it from Caesar!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands again; after which the exchange of clothes was effected.
  It was arranged then that a messenger should go at night to Thord's
  lodging-place with the four thousand sestertii. When they were done, the
  giant knocked at the front door; it opened to him; and, passing out of the
  atrium, he led Ben-Hur into a room adjoining, where the latter completed his
  attire from the coarse garments of the dead pugilist. They separated directly
  in the Omphalus.</p>

  <p>"Fail not, O son of Arrius, fail not the wine-shop near the Great Circus!
  Ha, ha, ha! By the beard of Irmin, there was never fortune gained so cheap.
  The gods keep you!"</p>

  <p>Upon leaving the atrium, Ben-Hur gave a last look at the myrmidon as he
  lay in the Jewish vestments, and was satisfied. The likeness was striking. If
  Thord kept faith, the cheat was a secret to endure forever.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At night, in the house of Simonides, Ben-Hur told the good
  man all that had taken place in the palace of Idernee; and it was agreed
  that, after a few days, public inquiry should be set afloat for the discovery
  of the whereabouts of the son of Arrius. Eventually the matter was to be
  carried boldly to Maxentius; then, if the mystery came not out, it was
  concluded that Messala and Gratus would be at rest and happy, and Ben-Hur
  free to betake himself to Jerusalem, to make search for his lost people.</p>

  <p>At the leave-taking, Simonides sat in his chair out on the terrace
  overlooking the river, and gave his farewell and the peace of the Lord with
  the impressment of a father. Esther went with the young man to the head of
  the steps.</p>

  <p>"If I find my mother, Esther, thou shalt go to her at Jerusalem, and be a
  sister to Tirzah."</p>

  <p>And with the words he kissed her.</p>

  <p>Was it only a kiss of peace?</p>

  <p>He crossed the river next to the late quarters of Ilderim, where he found
  the Arab who was to serve him as guide. The horses were brought out.</p>

  <p>"This one is thine," said the Arab.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked, and, lo! it was Aldebaran, the swiftest and brightest of
  the sons of Mira, and, next to Sirius, the beloved of the sheik; and he knew
  the old man's heart came to him along with the gift.</p>

  <p>The corpse in the atrium was taken up and buried by night; and, as part of
  Messala's plan, a courier was sent off to Gratus to make him at rest by the
  announcement of Ben-Hur's death&mdash;this time past question.</p>

  <p>Ere long a wine-shop was opened near the Circus Maximus, with inscription
  over the door:</p>

  <h2><a id="ch601"
     name="ch601"></a>I. &mdash; THE TOWER OF ANTONIA&mdash;CELL No. VI</h2>

  <p class="first">Our story moves forward now thirty days from the night Ben-
  Hur left Antioch to go out with Sheik Ilderim into the desert.</p>

  <p>A great change has befallen&mdash;great at least as respects the fortunes
  of our hero. VALERIUS GRATUS HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED BY PONTIUS PILATE!</p>

  <p>The removal, it may be remarked, cost Simonides exactly five talents Roman
  money in hand paid to Sejanus, who was then in height of power as imperial
  favorite; the object being to help Ben-Hur, by lessening his exposure while
  in and about Jerusalem attempting discovery of his people. To such pious use
  the faithful servant put the winnings from Drusus and his associates; all of
  whom, having paid their wagers, became at once and naturally the enemies of
  Messala, whose repudiation was yet an unsettled question in Rome.</p>

  <p>Brief as the time was, already the Jews knew the change of rulers was not
  for the better.</p>

  <p>The cohorts sent to relieve the garrison of Antonia made their entry into
  the city by night; next morning the first sight that greeted the people
  resident in the neighborhood was the walls of the old Tower decorated with
  military ensigns, which unfortunately consisted of busts of the emperor mixed
  with eagles and globes. A multitude, in passion, marched to Caesarea, where
  Pilate was lingering, and implored him to remove the detested images. Five
  days and nights they beset his palace gates; at last he appointed a meeting
  with them in the Circus. When they were assembled, he encircled them with
  soldiers; instead of resisting, they offered him their lives, and conquered.
  He recalled the images and ensigns to Caesarea, where Gratus, with more
  consideration, had kept such abominations housed during the eleven years of
  his reign.</p>

  <p>The worst of men do once in a while vary their wickednesses by good acts;
  so with Pilate. He ordered an inspection of all the prisons in Judea, and a
  return of the names of the persons in custody, with a statement of the crimes
  for which they had been committed. Doubtless, the motive was the one so
  common with officials just installed&mdash;dread of entailed responsibility;
  the people, however, in thought of the good which might come of the measure,
  gave him credit, and, for a period, were comforted. The revelations were
  astonishing. Hundreds of persons were released against whom there were no
  accusations; many others came to light who had long been accounted dead; yet
  more amazing, there was opening of dungeons not merely unknown at the time by
  the people, but actually forgotten by the prison authorities. With one
  instance of the latter kind we have now to deal; and, strange to say, it
  occurred in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Antonia, which will be remembered as occupying two thirds of
  the sacred area on Mount Moriah, was originally a castle built by the
  Macedonians. Afterwards, John Hyrcanus erected the castle into a fortress for
  the defence of the Temple, and in his day it was considered impregnable to
  assault; but when Herod came with his bolder genius, he strengthened its
  walls and extended them, leaving a vast pile which included every
  appurtenance necessary for the stronghold he intended it to be forever; such
  as offices, barracks, armories, magazines, cisterns, and last, though not
  least, prisons of all grades. He levelled the solid rock, and tapped it with
  deep excavations, and built over them; connecting the whole great mass with
  the Temple by a beautiful colonnade, from the roof of which one could look
  down over the courts of the sacred structure. In such condition the Tower
  fell at last out of his hands into those of the Romans, who were quick to see
  its strength and advantages, and convert it to uses becoming such masters.
  All through the administration of Gratus it had been a garrisoned citadel and
  underground prison terrible to revolutionists. Woe when the cohorts poured
  from its gates to suppress disorder! Woe not less when a Jew passed the same
  gates going in under arrest!</p>

  <p>With this explanation, we hasten to our story.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The order of the new procurator requiring a report of the
  persons in custody was received at the Tower of Antonia, and promptly
  executed; and two days have gone since the last unfortunate was brought up
  for examination. The tabulated statement, ready for forwarding, lies on the
  table of the tribune in command; in five minutes more it will be on the way
  to Pilate, sojourning in the palace up on Mount Zion.</p>

  <p>The tribune's office is spacious and cool, and furnished in a style
  suitable to the dignity of the commandant of a post in every respect so
  important. Looking in upon him about the seventh hour of the day, the officer
  appears weary and impatient; when the report is despatched, he will to the
  roof of the colonnade for air and exercise, and the amusement to be had
  watching the Jews over in the courts of the Temple. His subordinates and
  clerks share his impatience.</p>

  <p>In the spell of waiting a man appeared in a doorway leading to an
  adjoining apartment. He rattled a bunch of keys, each heavy as a hammer, and
  at once attracted the chief's attention.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Gesius! come in," the tribune said.</p>

  <p>As the new-comer approached the table behind which the chief sat in an
  easy-chair, everybody present looked at him, and, observing a certain
  expression of alarm and mortification on his face, became silent that they
  might hear what he had to say.</p>

  <p>"O tribune!" he began, bending low, "I fear to tell what now I bring
  you."</p>

  <p>"Another mistake&mdash;ha, Gesius?"</p>

  <p>"If I could persuade myself it is but a mistake, I would not be
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"A crime then&mdash;or, worse, a breach of duty. Thou mayst laugh at
  Caesar, or curse the gods, and live; but if the offence be to the
  eagles&mdash;ah, thou knowest, Gesius&mdash;go on!"</p>

  <p>"It is now about eight years since Valerius Gratus selected me to be
  keeper of prisoners here in the Tower," said the man, deliberately. "I
  remember the morning I entered upon the duties of my office. There had been a
  riot the day before, and fighting in the streets. We slew many Jews, and
  suffered on our side. The affair came, it was said, of an attempt to
  assassinate Gratus, who had been knocked from his horse by a tile thrown from
  a roof. I found him sitting where you now sit, O tribune, his head swathed in
  bandages. He told me of my selection, and gave me these keys, numbered to
  correspond with the numbers of the cells; they were the badges of my office,
  he said, and not to be parted with. There was a roll of parchment on the
  table. Calling me to him, he opened the roll. 'Here are maps of the cells,'
  said he. There were three of them. 'This one,' he went on, 'shows the
  arrangement of the upper floor; this second one gives you the second floor;
  and this last is of the lower floor. I give them to you in trust.' I took
  them from his hand, and he said, further, 'Now you have the keys and the
  maps; go immediately, and acquaint yourself with the whole arrangement; visit
  each cell, and see to its condition. When anything is needed for the security
  of a prisoner, order it according to your judgment, for you are the master
  under me, and no other.'</p>

  <p>"I saluted him, and turned to go away; he called me back. 'Ah, I forgot,'
  he said. 'Give me the map of the third floor.' I gave it to him, and he
  spread it upon the table. 'Here, Gesius,' he said, 'see this cell.' He laid
  his finger on the one numbered V. 'There are three men confined in that cell,
  desperate characters, who by some means got hold of a state secret, and
  suffer for their curiosity, which'&mdash;he looked at me severely&mdash;'in
  such matters is worse than a crime. Accordingly, they are blind and
  tongueless, and are placed there for life. They shall have nothing but food
  and drink, to be given them through a hole, which you will find in the wall
  covered by a slide. Do you hear, Gesius?' I made him answer. 'It is well,' he
  continued. 'One thing more which you shall not forget, or'&mdash;he looked at
  me threateningly&mdash;'The door of their cell&mdash;cell number V. on the
  same floor&mdash;this one, Gesius'&mdash;he put his finger on the particular
  cell to impress my memory&mdash;'shall never be opened for any purpose,
  neither to let one in nor out, not even yourself.' 'But if they die?' I
  asked. 'If they die,' he said, 'the cell shall be their tomb. They were put
  there to die, and be lost. The cell is leprous. Do you understand?' With that
  he let me go."</p>

  <p>Gesius stopped, and from the breast of his tunic drew three parchments,
  all much yellowed by time and use; selecting one of them, he spread it upon
  the table before the tribune, saying, simply, "This is the lower floor."</p>

  <p>The whole company looked at the map:</p>

  <p>"This is exactly, O tribune, as I had it from Gratus. See, there is cell
  number V.," said Gesius.</p>

  <p>"I see," the tribune replied. "Go on now. The cell was leprous, he
  said."</p>

  <p>"I would like to ask you a question," remarked the keeper, modestly.</p>

  <p>The tribune assented.</p>

  <p>"Had I not a right, under the circumstances, to believe the map a true
  one?"</p>

  <p>"What else couldst thou?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it is not a true one."</p>

  <p>The chief looked up surprised.</p>

  <p>"It is not a true one," the keeper repeated. "It shows but five cells upon
  that floor, while there are six."</p>

  <p>"Six, sayest thou?"</p>

  <p>"I will show you the floor as it is&mdash;or as I believe it to be."</p>

  <p>Upon a page of his tablets Gesius drew the following diagram, and gave it
  to the tribune:</p>

  <p>"Thou hast done well," said the tribune, examining the drawing, and
  thinking the narrative at an end. "I will have the map corrected, or, better,
  I will have a new one made, and given thee. Come for it in the morning."</p>

  <p>So saying, he arose.</p>

  <p>"But hear me further, O tribune."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, Gesius, to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"That which I have yet to tell will not wait."</p>

  <p>The tribune good-naturedly resumed his chair.</p>

  <p>"I will hurry," said the keeper, humbly, "only let me ask another
  question. Had I not a right to believe Gratus in what he further told me as
  to the prisoners in cell number V.?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was thy duty to believe there were three prisoners in the
  cell&mdash;prisoners of state&mdash;blind and without tongues."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the keeper, "that was not true either."</p>

  <p>"No!" said the tribune, with returning interest.</p>

  <p>"Hear, and judge for yourself, O tribune. As required, I visited all the
  cells, beginning with those on the first floor, and ending with those on the
  lower. The order that the door of number V. should not be opened had been
  respected; through all the eight years food and drink for three men had been
  passed through a hole in the wall. I went to the door yesterday, curious to
  see the wretches who, against all expectation, had lived so long. The locks
  refused the key. We pulled a little, and the door fell down, rusted from its
  hinges. Going in, I found but one man, old, blind, tongueless, and naked. His
  hair dropped in stiffened mats below his waist. His skin was like the
  parchment there. He held his hands out, and the finger-nails curled and
  twisted like the claws of a bird. I asked him where his companions were. He
  shook his head in denial. Thinking to find the others, we searched the cell.
  The floor was dry; so were the walls. If three men had been shut in there,
  and two of them had died, at least their bones would have endured."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore thou thinkest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think, O tribune, there has been but one prisoner there in the eight
  years."</p>

  <p>The chief regarded the keeper sharply, and said, "Have a care; thou art
  more than saying Valerius lied."</p>

  <p>Gesius bowed, but said, "He might have been mistaken."</p>

  <p>"No, he was right," said the tribune, warmly. "By thine own statement he
  was right. Didst thou not say but now that for eight years food and drink had
  been furnished three men?"</p>

  <p>The bystanders approved the shrewdness of their chief; yet Gesius did not
  seem discomfited.</p>

  <p>"You have but half the story, O tribune. When you have it all, you will
  agree with me. You know what I did with the man: that I sent him to the bath,
  and had him shorn and clothed, and then took him to the gate of the Tower,
  and bade him go free. I washed my hands of him. To-day he came back, and was
  brought to me. By signs and tears he at last made me understand he wished to
  return to his cell, and I so ordered. As they were leading him off, he broke
  away and kissed my feet, and, by piteous dumb imploration, insisted I should
  go with him; and I went. The mystery of the three men stayed in my mind. I
  was not satisfied about it. Now I am glad I yielded to his entreaty."</p>

  <p>The whole company at this point became very still.</p>

  <p>"When we were in the cell again, and the prisoner knew it, he caught my
  hand eagerly, and led me to a hole like that through which we were accustomed
  to pass him his food. Though large enough to push your helmet through, it
  escaped me yesterday. Still holding my hand, he put his face to the hole and
  gave a beast-like cry. A sound came faintly back. I was astonished, and drew
  him away, and called out, 'Ho, here!' At first there was no answer. I called
  again, and received back these words, 'Be thou praised, O Lord!' Yet more
  astonishing, O tribune, the voice was a woman's. And I asked, 'Who are you?'
  and had reply, 'A woman of Israel, entombed here with her daughter. Help us
  quickly, or we die.' I told them to be of cheer, and hurried here to know
  your will."</p>

  <p>The tribune arose hastily.</p>

  <p>"Thou wert right, Gesius," he said, "and I see now. The map was a lie, and
  so was the tale of the three men. There have been better Romans than Valerius
  Gratus."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the keeper. "I gleaned from the prisoner that he had regularly
  given the women of the food and drink he had received."</p>

  <p>"It is accounted for," replied the tribune, and observing the countenances
  of his friends, and reflecting how well it would be to have witnesses, he
  added, "Let us rescue the women. Come all."</p>

  <p>Gesuis was pleased.</p>

  <p>"We will have to pierce the wall," he said. "I found where a door had
  been, but it was filled solidly with stones and mortar."</p>

  <p>The tribune stayed to say to a clerk, "Send workmen after me with tools.
  Make haste; but hold the report, for I see it will have to be corrected."</p>

  <p>In a short time they were gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch602"
     name="ch602"></a>II. &mdash; THE LEPERS</h2>

  <p class="first">"A woman of Israel, entombed here with her daughter. Help us
  quickly, or we die."</p>

  <p>Such was the reply Gesius, the keeper, had from the cell which appears on
  his amended map as VI. The reader, when he observed the answer, knew who the
  unfortunates were, and, doubtless, said to himself, "At last the mother of
  Ben-Hur, and Tirzah, his sister!"</p>

  <p>And so it was.</p>

  <p>The morning of their seizure, eight years before, they had been carried to
  the Tower, where Gratus proposed to put them out of the way. He had chosen
  the Tower for the purpose as more immediately in his own keeping, and cell
  VI. because, first, it could be better lost than any other; and, secondly, it
  was infected with leprosy; for these prisoners were not merely to be put in a
  safe place, but in a place to die. They were, accordingly, taken down by
  slaves in the night-time, when there were no witnesses of the deed; then, in
  completion of the savage task, the same slaves walled up the door, after
  which they were themselves separated, and sent away never to be heard of
  more. To save accusation, and, in the event of discovery, to leave himself
  such justification as might be allowed in a distinction between the
  infliction of a punishment and the commission of a double murder, Gratus
  preferred sinking his victims where natural death was certain, though slow.
  That they might linger along, he selected a convict who had been made blind
  and tongueless, and sank him in the only connecting cell, there to serve them
  with food and drink. Under no circumstances could the poor wretch tell the
  tale or identify either the prisoners or their doomsman. So, with a cunning
  partly due to Messala, the Roman, under color of punishing a brood of
  assassins, smoothed a path to confiscation of the estate of the Hurs, of
  which no portion ever reached the imperial coffers.</p>

  <p>As the last step in the scheme, Gratus summarily removed the old keeper of
  the prisons; not because he knew what had been done&mdash;for he did
  not&mdash;but because, knowing the underground floors as he did, it would be
  next to impossible to keep the transaction from him. Then, with masterly
  ingenuity, the procurator had new maps drawn for delivery to a new keeper,
  with the omission, as we have seen, of cell VI. The instructions given the
  latter, taken with the omission on the map, accomplished the design&mdash;the
  cell and its unhappy tenants were all alike lost.</p>

  <p>What may be thought of the life of the mother and daughter during the
  eight years must have relation to their culture and previous habits.
  Conditions are pleasant or grievous to us according to our sensibilities. It
  is not extreme to say, if there was a sudden exit of all men from the world,
  heaven, as prefigured in the Christian idea, would not be a heaven to the
  majority; on the other hand, neither would all suffer equally in the
  so-called Tophet. Cultivation has its balances. As the mind is made
  intelligent, the capacity of the soul for pure enjoyment is proportionally
  increased. Well, therefore, if it be saved! If lost, however, alas that it
  ever had cultivation! its capacity for enjoyment in the one case is the
  measure of its capacity to suffer in the other. Wherefore repentance must be
  something more than mere remorse for sins; it comprehends a change of nature
  befitting heaven.</p>

  <p>We repeat, to form an adequate idea of the suffering endured by the mother
  of Ben-Hur, the reader must think of her spirit and its sensibilities as much
  as, if not more than, of the conditions of the immurement; the question
  being, not what the conditions were, but how she was affected by them. And
  now we may be permitted to say it was in anticipation of this thought that
  the scene in the summer-house on the roof of the family palace was given so
  fully in the beginning of the Second Book of our story. So, too, to be
  helpful when the inquiry should come up, we ventured the elaborate
  description of the palace of the Hurs.</p>

  <p>In other words, let the serene, happy, luxurious life in the princely
  house be recalled and contrasted with this existence in the lower dungeon of
  the Tower of Antonia; then if the reader, in his effort to realize the misery
  of the woman, persists in mere reference to conditions physical, he cannot go
  amiss; as he is a lover of his kind, tender of heart, he will be melted with
  much sympathy. But will he go further; will he more than sympathize with her;
  will he share her agony of mind and spirit; will he at least try to measure
  it&mdash;let him recall her as she discoursed to her son of God and nations
  and heroes; one moment a philosopher, the next a teacher, and all the time a
  mother.</p>

  <p>Would you hurt a man keenest, strike at his self-love; would you hurt a
  woman worst, aim at her affections.</p>

  <p>With quickened remembrance of these unfortunates&mdash;remembrance of them
  as they were&mdash;let us go down and see them as they are.</p>

  <p>The cell VI. was in form as Gesius drew it on his map. Of its dimensions
  but little idea can be had; enough that it was a roomy, roughened interior,
  with ledged and broken walls and floor.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the site of the Macedonian Castle was separated from the
  site of the Temple by a narrow but deep cliff somewhat in shape of a wedge.
  The workmen, wishing to hew out a series of chambers, made their entry in the
  north face of the cleft, and worked in, leaving a ceiling of the natural
  stone; delving farther, they executed the cells V., IV., III., II., I., with
  no connection with number VI. except through number V. In like manner, they
  constructed the passage and stairs to the floor above. The process of the
  work was precisely that resorted to in carving out the Tombs of the Kings,
  yet to be seen a short distance north of Jerusalem; only when the cutting was
  done, cell VI. was enclosed on its outer side by a wall of prodigious stones,
  in which, for ventilation, narrow apertures were left bevelled like modern
  port-holes. Herod, when he took hold of the Temple and Tower, put a facing
  yet more massive upon this outer wall, and shut up all the apertures but one,
  which yet admitted a little vitalizing air, and a ray of light not nearly
  strong enough to redeem the room from darkness.</p>

  <p>Such was cell VI.</p>

  <p>Startle not now!</p>

  <p>The description of the blind and tongueless wretch just liberated from
  cell V. may be accepted to break the horror of what is coming.</p>

  <p>The two women are grouped close by the aperture; one is seated, the other
  is half reclining against her; there is nothing between them and the bare
  rock. The light, slanting upwards, strikes them with ghastly effect, and we
  cannot avoid seeing they are without vesture or covering. At the same time we
  are helped to the knowledge that love is there yet, for the two are in each
  other's arms. Riches take wings, comforts vanish, hope withers away, but love
  stays with us. Love is God.</p>

  <p>Where the two are thus grouped the stony floor is polished shining smooth.
  Who shall say how much of the eight years they have spent in that space there
  in front of the aperture, nursing their hope of rescue by that timid yet
  friendly ray of light? When the brightness came creeping in, they knew it was
  dawn; when it began to fade, they knew the world was hushing for the night,
  which could not be anywhere so long and utterly dark as with them. The world!
  Through that crevice, as if it were broad and high as a king's gate, they
  went to the world in thought, and passed the weary time going up and down as
  spirits go, looking and asking, the one for her son, the other for her
  brother. On the seas they sought him, and on the islands of the seas; to-day
  he was in this city, to-morrow in that other; and everywhere, and at all
  times, he was a flitting sojourner; for, as they lived waiting for him, he
  lived looking for them. How often their thoughts passed each other in the
  endless search, his coming, theirs going! It was such sweet flattery for them
  to say to each other, "While he lives, we shall not be forgotten; as long as
  he remembers us, there is hope!" The strength one can eke from little, who
  knows till he has been subjected to the trial?</p>

  <p>Our recollections of them in former days enjoin us to be respectful; their
  sorrows clothe them with sanctity. Without going too near, across the
  dungeon, we see they have undergone a change of appearance not to be
  accounted for by time or long confinement. The mother was beautiful as a
  woman, the daughter beautiful as a child; not even love could say so much
  now. Their hair is long, unkempt, and strangely white; they make us shrink
  and shudder with an indefinable repulsion, though the effect may be from an
  illusory glozing of the light glimmering dismally through the unhealthy murk;
  or they may be enduring the tortures of hunger and thirst, not having had to
  eat or drink since their servant, the convict, was taken away&mdash;that is,
  since yesterday.</p>

  <p>Tirzah, reclining against her mother in half embrace, moans piteously.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Tirzah. They will come. God is good. We have been mindful of
  him, and forgotten not to pray at every sounding of the trumpets over in the
  Temple. The light, you see, is still bright; the sun is standing in the south
  sky yet, and it is hardly more than the seventh hour. Somebody will come to
  us. Let us have faith. God is good."</p>

  <p>Thus the mother. The words were simple and effective, although, eight
  years being now to be added to the thirteen she had attained when last we saw
  her, Tirzah was no longer a child.</p>

  <p>"I will try and be strong, mother," she said. "Your suffering must be as
  great as mine; and I do so want to live for you and my brother! But my tongue
  burns, my lips scorch. I wonder where he is, and if he will ever, ever find
  us!"</p>

  <p>There is something in the voices that strikes us singularly&mdash;an
  unexpected tone, sharp, dry, metallic, unnatural.</p>

  <p>The mother draws the daughter closer to her breast, and says, "I dreamed
  about him last night, and saw him as plainly, Tirzah, as I see you. We must
  believe in dreams, you know, because our fathers did. The Lord spoke to them
  so often in that way. I thought we were in the Women's Court just before the
  Gate Beautiful; there were many women with us; and he came and stood in the
  shade of the Gate, and looked here and there, at this one and that. My heart
  beat strong. I knew he was looking for us, and stretched my arms to him, and
  ran, calling him. He heard me and saw me, but he did not know me. In a moment
  he was gone."</p>

  <p>"Would it not be so, mother, if we were to meet him in fact? We are so
  changed."</p>

  <p>"It might be so; but&mdash;" The mother's head droops, and her face knits
  as with a wrench of pain; recovering, however, she goes on&mdash;"but we
  could make ourselves known to him."</p>

  <p>Tirzah tossed her arms, and moaned again.</p>

  <p>"Water, mother, water, though but a drop."</p>

  <p>The mother stares around in blank helplessness. She has named God so
  often, and so often promised in his name, the repetition is beginning to have
  a mocking effect upon herself. A shadow passes before her dimming the dim
  light, and she is brought down to think of death as very near, waiting to
  come in as her faith goes out. Hardly knowing what she does, speaking
  aimlessly, because speak she must, she says again,</p>

  <p>"Patience, Tirzah; they are coming&mdash;they are almost here."</p>

  <p>She thought she heard a sound over by the little trap in the
  partition-wall through which they held all their actual communication with
  the world. And she was not mistaken. A moment, and the cry of the convict
  rang through the cell. Tirzah heard it also; and they both arose, still
  keeping hold of each other.</p>

  <p>"Praised be the Lord forever!" exclaimed the mother, with the fervor of
  restored faith and hope.</p>

  <p>"Ho, there!" they heard next; and then, "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>The voice was strange. What matter? Except from Tirzah, they were the
  first and only words the mother had heard in eight years. The revulsion was
  mighty&mdash;from death to life&mdash;and so instantly!</p>

  <p>"A woman of Israel, entombed here with her daughter. Help us quickly, or
  we die."</p>

  <p>"Be of cheer. I will return."</p>

  <p>The women sobbed aloud. They were found; help was coming. From wish to
  wish hope flew as the twittering swallows fly. They were found; they would be
  released. And restoration would follow&mdash;restoration to all they had
  lost&mdash;home, society, property, son and brother! The scanty light glozed
  them with the glory of day, and, forgetful of pain and thirst and hunger, and
  of the menace of death, they sank upon the floor and cried, keeping fast hold
  of each other the while.</p>

  <p>And this time they had not long to wait. Gesius, the keeper, told his tale
  methodically, but finished it at last. The tribune was prompt.</p>

  <p>"Within there!" he shouted through the trap.</p>

  <p>"Here!" said the mother, rising.</p>

  <p>Directly she heard another sound in another place, as of blows on the
  wall&mdash;blows quick, ringing, and delivered with iron tools. She did not
  speak, nor did Tirzah, but they listened, well knowing the meaning of it
  all&mdash;that a way to liberty was being made for them. So men a long time
  buried in deep mines hear the coming of rescuers, heralded by thrust of bar
  and beat of pick, and answer gratefully with heart-throbs, their eyes fixed
  upon the spot whence the sounds proceed; and they cannot look away, lest the
  work should cease, and they be returned to despair.</p>

  <p>The arms outside were strong, the hands skillful, the will good. Each
  instant the blows sounded more plainly; now and then a piece fell with a
  crash; and liberty came nearer and nearer. Presently the workmen could be
  heard speaking. Then&mdash;O happiness!&mdash;through a crevice flashed a red
  ray of torches. Into the darkness it cut incisive as diamond brilliance,
  beautiful as if from a spear of the morning.</p>

  <p>"It is he, mother, it is he! He has found us at last!" cried Tirzah, with
  the quickened fancy of youth.</p>

  <p>But the mother answered meekly, "God is good!"</p>

  <p>A block fell inside, and another&mdash;then a great mass, and the door was
  open. A man grimed with mortar and stone-dust stepped in, and stopped,
  holding a torch over his head. Two or three others followed with torches, and
  stood aside for the tribune to enter.</p>

  <p>Respect for women is not all a conventionality, for it is the best proof
  of their proper nature. The tribune stopped, because they fled from
  him&mdash;not with fear, be it said, but shame; nor yet, O reader, from shame
  alone! From the obscurity of their partial hiding he heard these words, the
  saddest, most dreadful, most utterly despairing of the human tongue:</p>

  <p>"Come not near us&mdash;unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>The men flared their torches while they stared at each other.</p>

  <p>"Unclean, unclean!" came from the corner again, a slow tremulous wail
  exceedingly sorrowful. With such a cry we can imagine a spirit vanishing from
  the gates of Paradise, looking back the while.</p>

  <p>So the widow and mother performed her duty, and in the moment realized
  that the freedom she had prayed for and dreamed of, fruit of scarlet and gold
  seen afar, was but an apple of Sodom in the hand.</p>

  <p>SHE AND TIRZAH WERE&mdash;LEPERS!</p>

  <p>Possibly the reader does not know all the word means. Let him be told it
  with reference to the Law of that time, only a little modified in this.</p>

  <p>"These four are accounted as dead&mdash;the blind, the leper, the poor,
  and the childless." Thus the Talmud.</p>

  <p>That is, to be a leper was to be treated as dead&mdash;to be excluded from
  the city as a corpse; to be spoken to by the best beloved and most loving
  only at a distance; to dwell with none but lepers; to be utterly
  unprivileged; to be denied the rites of the Temple and the synagogue; to go
  about in rent garments and with covered mouth, except when crying, "Unclean,
  unclean!" to find home in the wilderness or in abandoned tombs; to become a
  materialized specter of Hinnom and Gehenna; to be at all times less a living
  offence to others than a breathing torment to self; afraid to die, yet
  without hope except in death.</p>

  <p>Once&mdash;she might not tell the day or the year, for down in the haunted
  hell even time was lost&mdash;once the mother felt a dry scurf in the palm of
  her right hand, a trifle which she tried to wash away. It clung to the member
  pertinaciously; yet she thought but little of the sign till Tirzah complained
  that she, too, was attacked in the same way. The supply of water was scant,
  and they denied themselves drink that they might use it as a curative. At
  length the whole hand was attacked; the skin cracked open, the fingernails
  loosened from the flesh. There was not much pain withal, chiefly a steadily
  increasing discomfort. Later their lips began to parch and seam. One day the
  mother, who was cleanly to godliness, and struggled against the impurities of
  the dungeon with all ingenuity, thinking the enemy was taking hold on
  Tirzah's face, led her to the light, and, looking with the inspiration of a
  terrible dread, lo! the young girl's eyebrows were white as snow.</p>

  <p>Oh, the anguish of that assurance!</p>

  <p>The mother sat awhile speechless, motionless, paralyzed of soul, and
  capable of but one thought&mdash;leprosy, leprosy!</p>

  <p>When she began to think, mother-like, it was not of herself, but her
  child, and, mother-like, her natural tenderness turned to courage, and she
  made ready for the last sacrifice of perfect heroism. She buried her
  knowledge in her heart; hopeless herself, she redoubled her devotion to
  Tirzah, and with wonderful ingenuity&mdash;wonderful chiefly in its very
  inexhaustibility&mdash;continued to keep the daughter ignorant of what they
  were beset with, and even hopeful that it was nothing. She repeated her
  little games, and retold her stories, and invented new ones, and listened
  with ever so much pleasure to the songs she would have from Tirzah, while on
  her own wasting lips the psalms of the singing king and their race served to
  bring soothing of forgetfulness, and keep alive in them both the recollection
  of the God who would seem to have abandoned them&mdash;the world not more
  lightly or utterly.</p>

  <p>Slowly, steadily, with horrible certainty, the disease spread, after a
  while bleaching their heads white, eating holes in their lips and eyelids,
  and covering their bodies with scales; then it fell to their throats
  shrilling their voices, and to their joints, hardening the tissues and
  cartilages&mdash;slowly, and, as the mother well knew, past remedy, it was
  affecting their lungs and arteries and bones, at each advance making the
  sufferers more and more loathsome; and so it would continue till death, which
  might be years before them.</p>

  <p>Another day of dread at length came&mdash;the day the mother, under
  impulsion of duty, at last told Tirzah the name of their ailment; and the
  two, in agony of despair, prayed that the end might come quickly.</p>

  <p>Still, as is the force of habit, these so afflicted grew in time not
  merely to speak composedly of their disease; they beheld the hideous
  transformation of their persons as of course, and in despite clung to
  existence. One tie to earth remained to them; unmindful of their own
  loneliness, they kept up a certain spirit by talking and dreaming of Ben-Hur.
  The mother promised reunion with him to the sister, and she to the mother,
  not doubting, either of them, that he was equally faithful to them, and would
  be equally happy of the meeting. And with the spinning and respinning of this
  slender thread they found pleasure, and excused their not dying. In such
  manner as we have seen, they were solacing themselves the moment Gesius
  called them, at the end of twelve hours' fasting and thirst.</p>

  <p>The torches flashed redly through the dungeon, and liberty was come. "God
  is good," the widow cried&mdash;not for what had been, O reader, but for what
  was. In thankfulness for present mercy, nothing so becomes us as losing sight
  of past ills.</p>

  <p>The tribune came directly; then in the corner to which she had fled,
  suddenly a sense of duty smote the elder of the women, and straightway the
  awful warning&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>Ah, the pang the effort to acquit herself of that duty cost the mother!
  Not all the selfishness of joy over the prospect could keep her blind to the
  consequences of release, now that it was at hand. The old happy life could
  never be again. If she went near the house called home, it would be to stop
  at the gate and cry, "Unclean, unclean!" She must go about with the yearnings
  of love alive in her breast strong as ever, and more sensitive even, because
  return in kind could not be. The boy of whom she had so constantly thought,
  and with all sweet promises such as mothers find their purest delight in,
  must, at meeting her, stand afar off. If he held out his hands to her, and
  called "Mother, mother," for very love of him she must answer, "Unclean,
  unclean!" And this other child, before whom, in want of other covering, she
  was spreading her long tangled locks, bleached unnaturally white&mdash;ah!
  that she was she must continue, sole partner of her blasted remainder of
  life. Yet, O reader, the brave woman accepted the lot, and took up the cry
  which had been its sign immemorially, and which thenceforward was to be her
  salutation without change&mdash;"Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>The tribune heard it with a tremor, but kept his place.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two women dying of hunger and thirst. Yet"&mdash;the mother did not
  falter&mdash;"come not near us, nor touch the floor or the wall. Unclean,
  unclean!"</p>

  <p>"Give me thy story, woman&mdash;thy name, and when thou wert put here, and
  by whom, and for what."</p>

  <p>"There was once in this city of Jerusalem a Prince Ben-Hur, the friend of
  all generous Romans, and who had Caesar for his friend. I am his widow, and
  this one with me is his child. How may I tell you for what we were sunk here,
  when I do not know, unless it was because we were rich? Valerius Gratus can
  tell you who our enemy was, and when our imprisonment began. I cannot. See to
  what we have been reduced&mdash;oh, see, and have pity!"</p>

  <p>The air was heavy with the pest and the smoke of the torches, yet the
  Roman called one of the torch-bearers to his side, and wrote the answer
  nearly word for word. It was terse, and comprehensive, containing at once a
  history, an accusation, and a prayer. No common person could have made it,
  and he could not but pity and believe.</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt have relief, woman," he said, closing the tablets. "I will
  send thee food and drink."</p>

  <p>"And raiment, and purifying water, we pray you, O generous Roman!"</p>

  <p>"As thou wilt," he replied.</p>

  <p>"God is good," said the widow, sobbing. "May his peace abide with
  you!"</p>

  <p>"And, further," he added, "I cannot see thee again. Make preparation, and
  to-night I will have thee taken to the gate of the Tower, and set free. Thou
  knowest the law. Farewell."</p>

  <p>He spoke to the men, and went out the door.</p>

  <p>Very shortly some slaves came to the cell with a large gurglet of water, a
  basin and napkins, a platter with bread and meat, and some garments of
  women's wear; and, setting them down within reach of the prisoners, they ran
  away.</p>

  <p>About the middle of the first watch, the two were conducted to the gate,
  and turned into the street. So the Roman quit himself of them, and in the
  city of their fathers they were once more free.</p>

  <p>Up to the stars, twinkling merrily as of old, they looked; then they asked
  themselves,</p>

  <p>"What next? and where to?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch603"
     name="ch603"></a>III. &mdash; JERUSALEM AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">About the hour Gesius, the keeper, made his appearance
  before the tribune in the Tower of Antonia, a footman was climbing the
  eastern face of Mount Olivet. The road was rough and dusty, and vegetation on
  that side burned brown, for it was the dry season in Judea. Well for the
  traveller that he had youth and strength, not to speak of the cool, flowing
  garments with which he was clothed.</p>

  <p>He proceeded slowly, looking often to his right and left; not with the
  vexed, anxious expression which marks a man going forward uncertain of the
  way, but rather the air with which one approaches as old acquaintance after a
  long separation&mdash;half of pleasure, half of inquiry; as if he were
  saying, "I am glad to be with you again; let me see in what you are
  changed."</p>

  <p>As he arose higher, he sometimes paused to look behind him over the
  gradually widening view terminating in the mountains of Moab; but when at
  length he drew near the summit, he quickened his step, unmindful of fatigue,
  and hurried on without pause or turning of the face. On the summit&mdash;to
  reach which he bent his steps somewhat right of the beaten path&mdash;he came
  to a dead stop, arrested as if by a strong hand. Then one might have seen his
  eyes dilate, his cheeks flush, his breath quicken, effects all of one bright
  sweeping glance at what lay before him.</p>

  <p>The traveller, good reader, was no other than Ben-Hur; the spectacle,
  Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>Not the Holy City of to-day, but the Holy City as left by Herod&mdash;the
  Holy City of the Christ. Beautiful yet, as seen from old Olivet, what must it
  have been then?</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur betook him to a stone and sat down, and, stripping his head of the
  close white handkerchief which served it for covering, made the survey at
  leisure.</p>

  <p>The same has been done often since by a great variety of persons, under
  circumstances surpassingly singular&mdash;by the son of Vespasian, by the
  Islamite, by the Crusader, conquerors all of them; by many a pilgrim from the
  great New World, which waited discovery nearly fifteen hundred years after
  the time of our story; but of the multitude probably not one has taken that
  view with sensations more keenly poignant, more sadly sweet, more proudly
  bitter, than Ben-Hur. He was stirred by recollections of his countrymen,
  their triumphs and vicissitudes, their history the history of God. The city
  was of their building, at once a lasting testimony of their crimes and
  devotion, their weakness and genius, their religion and their irreligion.
  Though he had seen Rome to familiarity, he was gratified. The sight filled a
  measure of pride which would have made him drunk with vainglory but for the
  thought, princely as the property was, it did not any longer belong to his
  countrymen; the worship in the Temple was by permission of strangers; the
  hill where David dwelt was a marbled cheat&mdash;an office in which the
  chosen of the Lord were wrung and wrung for taxes, and scourged for very
  deathlessness of faith. These, however, were pleasures and griefs of
  patriotism common to every Jew of the period; in addition, Ben-Hur brought
  with him a personal history which would not out of mind for other
  consideration whatever, which the spectacle served only to freshen and
  vivify.</p>

  <p>A country of hills changes but little; where the hills are of rock, it
  changes not at all. The scene Ben-Hur beheld is the same now, except as
  respects the city. The failure is in the handiwork of man alone.</p>

  <p>The sun dealt more kindly by the west side of Olivet than by the east, and
  men were certainly more loving towards it. The vines with which it was
  partially clad, and the sprinkling of trees, chiefly figs and old wild
  olives, were comparatively green. Down to the dry bed of the Cedron the
  verdure extended, a refreshment to the vision; there Olivet ceased and Moriah
  began&mdash;a wall of bluff boldness, white as snow, founded by Solomon,
  completed by Herod. Up, up the wall the eye climbed course by course of the
  ponderous rocks composing it&mdash;up to Solomon's Porch, which was as the
  pedestal of the monument, the hill being the plinth. Lingering there a
  moment, the eye resumed its climbing, going next to the Gentiles' Court, then
  to the Israelites' Court, then to the Women's Court, then to the Court of the
  Priests, each a pillared tier of white marble, one above the other in
  terraced retrocession; over them all a crown of crowns infinitely sacred,
  infinitely beautiful, majestic in proportions, effulgent with beaten
  gold&mdash;lo! the Tent, the Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies. The Ark was not
  there, but Jehovah was&mdash;in the faith of every child of Israel he was
  there a personal Presence. As a temple, as a monument, there was nowhere
  anything of man's building to approach that superlative apparition. Now, not
  a stone of it remains above another. Who shall rebuild that building? When
  shall the rebuilding be begun? So asks every pilgrim who has stood where
  Ben-Hur was&mdash;he asks, knowing the answer is in the bosom of God, whose
  secrets are not least marvellous in their well-keeping. And then the third
  question, What of him who foretold the ruin which has so certainly befallen?
  God? Or man of God? Or&mdash;enough that the question is for us to
  answer.</p>

  <p>And still Ben-Hur's eyes climbed on and up&mdash;up over the roof of the
  Temple, to the hill Zion, consecrated to sacred memories, inseparable from
  the anointed kings. He knew the Cheesemonger's Valley dipped deep down
  between Moriah and Zion; that it was spanned by the Xystus; that there were
  gardens and palaces in its depths; but over them all his thoughts soared with
  his vision to the great grouping on the royal hill&mdash;the house of
  Caiaphas, the Central Synagogue, the Roman Praetorium, Hippicus the eternal,
  and the sad but mighty cenotaphs Phasaelus and Mariamne&mdash;all relieved
  against Gareb, purpling in the distance. And when midst them he singled out
  the palace of Herod, what could he but think of the King Who Was Coming, to
  whom he was himself devoted, whose path he had undertaken to smooth, whose
  empty hands he dreamed of filling? And forward ran his fancy to the day the
  new King should come to claim his own and take possession of it&mdash;of
  Moriah and its Temple; of Zion and its towers and palaces; of Antonia,
  frowning darkly there just to the right of the Temple; of the new unwalled
  city of Bezetha; of the millions of Israel to assemble with palm-branches and
  banners, to sing rejoicing because the Lord had conquered and given them the
  world.</p>

  <p>Men speak of dreaming as if it were a phenomenon of night and sleep. They
  should know better. All results achieved by us are self-promised, and all
  self-promises are made in dreams awake. Dreaming is the relief of labor, the
  wine that sustains us in act. We learn to love labor, not for itself, but for
  the opportunity it furnishes for dreaming, which is the great under-monotone
  of real life, unheard, unnoticed, because of its constancy. Living is
  dreaming. Only in the grave are there no dreams. Let no one smile at Ben-Hur
  for doing that which he himself would have done at that time and place under
  the same circumstances.</p>

  <p>The sun stooped low in its course. Awhile the flaring disk seemed to perch
  itself on the far summit of the mountains in the west, brazening all the sky
  above the city, and rimming the walls and towers with the brightness of gold.
  Then it disappeared as with a plunge. The quiet turned Ben-Hur's thought
  homeward. There was a point in the sky a little north of the peerless front
  of the Holy of Holies upon which he fixed his gaze: under it, straight as a
  leadline would have dropped, lay his father's house, if yet the house
  endured.</p>

  <p>The mellowing influences of the evening mellowed his feelings, and,
  putting his ambitions aside, he thought of the duty that was bringing him to
  Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>Out in the desert while with Ilderim, looking for strong places and
  acquainting himself with it generally, as a soldier studies a country in
  which he has projected a campaign, a messenger came one evening with the news
  that Gratus was removed, and Pontius Pilate sent to take his place.</p>

  <p>Messala was disabled and believed him dead; Gratus was powerless and gone;
  why should Ben-Hur longer defer the search for his mother and sister? There
  was nothing to fear now. If he could not himself see into the prisons of
  Judea, he could examine them with the eyes of others. If the lost were found,
  Pilate could have no motive in holding them in custody&mdash;none, at least,
  which could not be overcome by purchase. If found, he would carry them to a
  place of safety, and then, in calmer mind, his conscience at rest, this one
  first duty done, he could give himself more entirely to the King Who Was
  Coming. He resolved at once. That night he counselled with Ilderim, and
  obtained his assent. Three Arabs came with him to Jericho, where he left them
  and the horses, and proceeded alone and on foot. Malluch was to meet him in
  Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur's scheme, be it observed, was as yet a generality.</p>

  <p>In view of the future, it was advisable to keep himself in hiding from the
  authorities, particularly the Romans. Malluch was shrewd and trusty; the very
  man to charge with the conduct of the investigation.</p>

  <p>Where to begin was the first point. He had no clear idea about it. His
  wish was to commence with the Tower of Antonia. Tradition not of long
  standing planted the gloomy pile over a labyrinth of prison-cells, which,
  more even than the strong garrison, kept it a terror to the Jewish fancy. A
  burial, such as his people had been subjected to, might be possible there.
  Besides, in such a strait, the natural inclination is to start search at the
  place where the loss occurred, and he could not forget that his last sight of
  the loved ones was as the guard pushed them along the street in the direction
  to the Tower. If they were not there now, but had been, some record of the
  fact must remain, a clew which had only to be followed faithfully to the
  end.</p>

  <p>Under this inclination, moreover, there was a hope which he could not
  forego. From Simonides he knew Amrah, the Egyptian nurse, was living. It will
  be remembered, doubtless, that the faithful creature, the morning the
  calamity overtook the Hurs, broke from the guard and ran back into the
  palace, where, along with other chattels, she had been sealed up. During the
  years following, Simonides kept her supplied; so she was there now, sole
  occupant of the great house, which, with all his offers, Gratus had not been
  able to sell. The story of its rightful owners sufficed to secure the
  property from strangers, whether purchasers or mere occupants. People going
  to and fro passed it with whispers. Its reputation was that of a haunted
  house; derived probably from the infrequent glimpses of poor old Amrah,
  sometimes on the roof, sometimes in a latticed window. Certainly no more
  constant spirit ever abided than she; nor was there ever a tenement so
  shunned and fitted for ghostly habitation. Now, if he could get to her,
  Ben-Hur fancied she could help him to knowledge which, though faint, might
  yet be serviceable. Anyhow, sight of her in that place, so endeared by
  recollection, would be to him a pleasure next to finding the objects of his
  solicitude.</p>

  <p>So, first of all things, he would go to the old house, and look for
  Amrah.</p>

  <p>Thus resolved, he arose shortly after the going-down of the sun, and began
  descent of the Mount by the road which, from the summit, bends a little north
  of east. Down nearly at the foot, close by the bed of the Cedron, he came to
  the intersection with the road leading south to the village of Siloam and the
  pool of that name. There he fell in with a herdsman driving some sheep to
  market. He spoke to the man, and joined him, and in his company passed by
  Gethsemane on into the city through the Fish Gate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch604"
     name="ch604"></a>IV. &mdash; BEN-HUR AT HIS FATHER'S GATE</h2>

  <p class="first">It was dark when, parting with the drover inside the gate,
  Ben-Hur turned into a narrow lane leading to the south. A few of the people
  whom he met saluted him. The bouldering of the pavement was rough. The houses
  on both sides were low, dark, and cheerless; the doors all closed: from the
  roofs, occasionally, he heard women crooning to children. The loneliness of
  his situation, the night, the uncertainty cloaking the object of his coming,
  all affected him cheerlessly. With feelings sinking lower and lower, he came
  directly to the deep reservoir now known as the Pool of Bethesda, in which
  the water reflected the over-pending sky. Looking up, he beheld the northern
  wall of the Tower of Antonia, a black frowning heap reared into the dim
  steel-gray sky. He halted as if challenged by a threatening sentinel.</p>

  <p>The Tower stood up so high, and seemed so vast, resting apparently upon
  foundations so sure, that he was constrained to acknowledge its strength. If
  his mother were there in living burial, what could he do for her? By the
  strong hand, nothing. An army might beat the stony face with ballista and
  ram, and be laughed at. Against him alone, the gigantic southeast turret
  looked down in the self-containment of a hill. And he thought, cunning is so
  easily baffled; and God, always the last resort of the helpless&mdash;God is
  sometimes so slow to act!</p>

  <p>In doubt and misgiving, he turned into the street in front of the Tower,
  and followed it slowly on to the west.</p>

  <p>Over in Bezetha he knew there was a khan, where it was his intention to
  seek lodging while in the city; but just now he could not resist the impulse
  to go home. His heart drew him that way.</p>

  <p>The old formal salutation which he received from the few people who passed
  him had never sounded so pleasantly. Presently, all the eastern sky began to
  silver and shine, and objects before invisible in the west&mdash;chiefly the
  tall towers on Mount Zion&mdash;emerged as from a shadowy depth, and put on
  spectral distinctness, floating, as it were, above the yawning blackness of
  the valley below, very castles in the air.</p>

  <p>He came, at length, to his father's house.</p>

  <p>Of those who read this page, some there will be to divine his feelings
  without prompting. They are such as had happy homes in their youth, no matter
  how far that may have been back in time&mdash;homes which are now the
  starting-points of all recollection; paradises from which they went forth in
  tears, and which they would now return to, if they could, as little children;
  places of laughter and singing, and associations dearer than any or all the
  triumphs of after-life.</p>

  <p>At the gate on the north side of the old house Ben-Hur stopped. In the
  corners the wax used in the sealing-up was still plainly seen, and across the
  valves was the board with the inscription&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign">"This Is the Property of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>Nobody had gone in or out the gate since the dreadful day of the
  separation. Should he knock as of old? It was useless, he knew; yet he could
  not resist the temptation. Amrah might hear, and look out of one of the
  windows on that side. Taking a stone, he mounted the broad stone step, and
  tapped three times. A dull echo replied. He tried again, louder than before;
  and again, pausing each time to listen. The silence was mocking. Retiring
  into the street, he watched the windows; but they, too, were lifeless. The
  parapet on the roof was defined sharply against the brightening sky; nothing
  could have stirred upon it unseen by him, and nothing did stir.</p>

  <p>From the north side he passed to the west, where there were four windows
  which he watched long and anxiously, but with as little effect. At times his
  heart swelled with impotent wishes; at others, he trembled at the deceptions
  of his own fancy. Amrah made no sign&mdash;not even a ghost stirred.</p>

  <p>Silently, then, he stole round to the south. There, too, the gate was
  sealed and inscribed. The mellow splendor of the August moon, pouring over
  the crest of Olivet, since termed the Mount of Offence, brought the lettering
  boldly out; and he read, and was filled with rage. All he could do was to
  wrench the board from its nailing, and hurl it into the ditch. Then he sat
  upon the step, and prayed for the New King, and that his coming might be
  hastened. As his blood cooled, insensibly he yielded to the fatigue of long
  travel in the summer heat, and sank down lower, and, at last, slept.</p>

  <p>About that time two women came down the street from the direction of the
  Tower of Antonia, approaching the palace of the Hurs. They advanced
  stealthily, with timid steps, pausing often to listen. At the corner of the
  rugged pile, one said to the other, in a low voice,</p>

  <p>"This is it, Tirzah!"</p>

  <p>And Tirzah, after a look, caught her mother's hand, and leaned upon her
  heavily, sobbing, but silent.</p>

  <p>"Let us go on, my child, because"&mdash;the mother hesitated and trembled;
  then, with an effort to be calm, continued&mdash;"because when morning comes
  they will put us out of the gate of the city to&mdash;return no more."</p>

  <p>Tirzah sank almost to the stones.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes!" she said, between sobs; "I forgot. I had the feeling of going
  home. But we are lepers, and have no homes; we belong to the dead!"</p>

  <p>The mother stooped and raised her tenderly, saying, "We have nothing to
  fear. Let us go on."</p>

  <p>Indeed, lifting their empty hands, they could have run upon a legion and
  put it to flight.</p>

  <p>And, creeping in close to the rough wall, they glided on, like two ghosts,
  till they came to the gate, before which they also paused. Seeing the board,
  they stepped upon the stone in the scarce cold tracks of Ben-Hur, and read
  the inscription&mdash;"This is the Property of the Emperor."</p>

  <p>Then the mother clasped her hands, and, with upraised eyes, moaned in
  unutterable anguish.</p>

  <p>"What now, mother? You scare me!"</p>

  <p>And the answer was, presently, "Oh, Tirzah, the poor are dead! He is
  dead!"</p>

  <p>"Who, mother?"</p>

  <p>"Your brother! They took everything from him&mdash;everything&mdash;even
  this house!"</p>

  <p>"Poor!" said Tirzah, vacantly.</p>

  <p>"He will never be able to help us."</p>

  <p>"And then, mother?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, my child, we must find a seat by the wayside,
  and beg alms as the lepers do; beg, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tirzah leaned upon her again, and said, whispering, "Let us&mdash;let us
  die!"</p>

  <p>"No!" the mother said, firmly. "The Lord has appointed our times, and we
  are believers in the Lord. We will wait on him even in this. Come away!"</p>

  <p>She caught Tirzah's hand as she spoke, and hastened to the west corner of
  the house, keeping close to the wall. No one being in sight there, they kept
  on to the next corner, and shrank from the moonlight, which lay exceedingly
  bright over the whole south front, and along a part of the street. The
  mother's will was strong. Casting one look back and up to the windows on the
  west side, she stepped out into the light, drawing Tirzah after her; and the
  extent of their amiction was then to be seen&mdash;on their lips and cheeks,
  in their bleared eyes, in their cracked hands; especially in the long, snaky
  locks, stiff with loathsome ichor, and, like their eyebrows, ghastly white.
  Nor was it possible to have told which was mother, which daughter; both alike
  seemed witch-like old.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" said the mother. "There is some one lying upon the step&mdash;a
  man. Let us go round him."</p>

  <p>They crossed to the opposite side of the street quickly, and, in the shade
  there, moved on till before the gate, where they stopped.</p>

  <p>"He is asleep, Tirzah!"</p>

  <p>The man was very still.</p>

  <p>"Stay here, and I will try the gate."</p>

  <p>So saying, the mother stole noiselessly across, and ventured to touch the
  wicket; she never knew if it yielded, for that moment the man sighed, and,
  turning restlessly, shifted the handkerchief on his head in such manner that
  the face was left upturned and fair in the broad moonlight. She looked down
  at it and started; then looked again, stooping a little, and arose and
  clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in mute appeal. An instant
  so, and she ran back to Tirzah.</p>

  <p>"As the Lord liveth, the man is my son&mdash;thy brother!" she said, in an
  awe-inspiring whisper.</p>

  <p>"My brother?&mdash;Judah?"</p>

  <p>The mother caught her hand eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she said, in the same enforced whisper, "let us look at him
  together&mdash;once more&mdash;only once&mdash;then help thou thy servants,
  Lord!"</p>

  <p>They crossed the street hand in hand ghostly-quick, ghostly-still. When
  their shadows fell upon him, they stopped. One of his hands was lying out
  upon the step palm up. Tirzah fell upon her knees, and would have kissed it;
  but the mother drew her back.</p>

  <p>"Not for thy life; not for thy life! Unclean, unclean!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Tirzah shrank from him, as if he were the leprous one.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was handsome as the manly are. His cheeks and forehead were
  swarthy from exposure to the desert sun and air; yet under the light mustache
  the lips were red, and the teeth shone white, and the soft beard did not hide
  the full roundness of chin and throat. How beautiful he appeared to the
  mother's eyes! How mightily she yearned to put her arms about him, and take
  his head upon her bosom and kiss him, as had been her wont in his happy
  childhood! Where got she the strength to resist the impulse? From her love,
  O, reader!&mdash;her mother-love, which, if thou wilt observe well, hath this
  unlikeness to any other love: tender to the object, it can be infinitely
  tyrannical to itself, and thence all its power of self-sacrifice. Not for
  restoration to health and fortune, not for any blessing of life, not for life
  itself, would she have left her leprous kiss upon his cheek! Yet touch him
  she must; in that instant of finding him she must renounce him forever! How
  bitter, bitter hard it was, let some other mother say! She knelt down, and,
  crawling to his feet, touched the sole of one of his sandals with her lips,
  yellow though it was with the dust of the street&mdash;and touched it again
  and again; and her very soul was in the kisses.</p>

  <p>He stirred, and tossed his hand. They moved back, but heard him mutter in
  his dream,</p>

  <p>"Mother! Amrah! Where is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He fell off into the deep sleep.</p>

  <p>Tirzah stared wistfully. The mother put her face in the dust, struggling
  to suppress a sob so deep and strong it seemed her heart was bursting. Almost
  she wished he might waken.</p>

  <p>He had asked for her; she was not forgotten; in his sleep he was thinking
  of her. Was it not enough?</p>

  <p>Presently mother beckoned to Tirzah, and they arose, and taking one more
  look, as if to print his image past fading, hand in hand they recrossed the
  street. Back in the shade of the wall there, they retired and knelt, looking
  at him, waiting for him to wake&mdash;waiting some revelation, they knew not
  what. Nobody has yet given us a measure for the patience of a love like
  theirs.</p>

  <p>By-and-by, the sleep being yet upon him, another woman appeared at the
  corner of the palace. The two in the shade saw her plainly in the light; a
  small figure, much bent, dark-skinned, gray-haired, dressed neatly in
  servant's garb, and carrying a basket full of vegetables.</p>

  <p>At sight of the man upon the step the new-comer stopped; then, as if
  decided, she walked on&mdash;very lightly as she drew near the sleeper.
  Passing round him, she went to the gate, slid the wicket latch easily to one
  side, and put her hand in the opening. One of the broad boards in the left
  valve swung ajar without noise. She put the basket through, and was about to
  follow, when, yielding to curiosity, she lingered to have one look at the
  stranger whose face was below her in open view.</p>

  <p>The spectators across the street heard a low exclamation, and saw the
  woman rub her eyes as if to renew their power, bend closer down, clasp her
  hands, gaze wildly around, look at the sleeper, stoop and raise the outlying
  hand, and kiss it fondly&mdash;that which they wished so mightily to do, but
  dared not.</p>

  <p>Awakened by the action, Ben-Hur instinctively withdrew the hand; as he did
  so, his eyes met the woman's.</p>

  <p>"Amrah! O Amrah, is it thou?" he said.</p>

  <p>The good heart made no answer in words, but fell upon his neck, crying for
  joy.</p>

  <p>Gently he put her arms away, and lifting the dark face wet with tears,
  kissed it, his joy only a little less than hers. Then those across the way
  heard him say,</p>

  <p>"Mother&mdash;Tirzah&mdash;O Amrah, tell me of them! Speak, speak, I pray
  thee!"</p>

  <p>Amrah only cried afresh.</p>

  <p>"Thou has seen them, Amrah. Thou knowest where they are; tell me they are
  at home."</p>

  <p>Tirzah moved, but her mother, divining her purpose, caught her and
  whispered, "Do not go&mdash;not for life. Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>Her love was in tyrannical mood. Though both their hearts broke, he should
  not become what they were; and she conquered.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Amrah, so entreated, only wept the more.</p>

  <p>"Wert thou going in?" he asked, presently, seeing the board swung back.
  "Come, then. I will go with thee." He arose as he spoke. "The Romans&mdash;be
  the curse of the Lord upon them!&mdash;the Romans lied. The house is mine.
  Rise, Amrah, and let us go in." A moment and they were gone, leaving the two
  in the shade to behold the gate staring blankly at them&mdash;the gate which
  they might not ever enter more. They nestled together in the dust.</p>

  <p>They had done their duty.</p>

  <p>Their love was proven.</p>

  <p>Next morning they were found, and driven out the city with stones.</p>

  <p>"Begone! Ye are of the dead; go to the dead!"</p>

  <p>With the doom ringing in their ears, they went forth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch605"
     name="ch605"></a>V. &mdash; THE TOMB ABOVE THE KING'S GARDEN</h2>

  <p class="first">Nowadays travellers in the Holy Land looking for the famous
  place with the beautiful name, the King's Garden, descend the bed of the
  Cedron or the curve of Gihon and Hinnom as far as the old well En-rogel, take
  a drink of the sweet living water, and stop, having reached the limit of the
  interesting in that direction. They look at the great stones with which the
  well is curbed, ask its depth, smile at the primitive mode of drawing the
  purling treasure, and waste some pity on the ragged wretch who presides over
  it; then, facing about, they are enraptured with the mounts Moriah and Zion,
  both of which slope towards them from the north, one terminating in Ophel,
  the other in what used to be the site of the city of David. In the
  background, up far in the sky, the garniture of the sacred places is visible:
  here the Haram, with its graceful dome; yonder the stalward remains of
  Hippicus, defiant even in ruins. When that view has been enjoyed, and is
  sufficiently impressed upon the memory, the travellers glance at the Mount of
  Offence standing in rugged stateliness at their right hand, and then at the
  Hill of Evil Counsel over on the left, in which, if they be well up in
  Scriptural history and in the traditions rabbinical and monkish, they will
  find a certain interest not to be overcome by superstitious horror.</p>

  <p>It were long to tell all the points of interest grouped around that hill;
  for the present purpose, enough that its feet are planted in the veritable
  orthodox Hell of the moderns&mdash;the Hell of brimstone and fire&mdash;in
  the old nomenclature Gehenna; and that now, as in the days of Christ, its
  bluff face opposite the city on the south and southeast is seamed and pitted
  with tombs which have been immemorially the dwelling-places of lepers, not
  singly, but collectively. There they set up their government and established
  their society; there they founded a city and dwelt by themselves, avoided as
  the accursed of God.</p>

  <p>The second morning after the incidents of the preceding chapter, Amrah
  drew near the well En-rogel, and seated herself upon a stone. One familiar
  with Jerusalem, looking at her, would have said she was the favorite servant
  of some well-to-do family. She brought with her a water-jar and a basket, the
  contents of the latter covered with a snow-white napkin. Placing them on the
  ground at her side, she loosened the shawl which fell from her head, knit her
  fingers together in her lap, and gazed demurely up to where the hill drops
  steeply down into Aceldama and the Potter's Field.</p>

  <p>It was very early, and she was the first to arrive at the well. Soon,
  however, a man came bringing a rope and a leathern bucket. Saluting the
  little dark-faced woman, he undid the rope, fixed it to the bucket, and
  waited customers. Others who chose to do so might draw water for themselves,
  he was a professional in the business, and would fill the largest jar the
  stoutest woman could carry for a gerah.</p>

  <p>Amrah sat still, and had nothing to say. Seeing the jar, the man asked
  after a while if she wished it filled; she answered him civilly, "Not now;"
  whereupon he gave her no more attention. When the dawn was fairly defined
  over Olivet, his patrons began to arrive, and he had all he could do to
  attend to them. All the time she kept her seat, looking intently up at the
  hill.</p>

  <p>The sun made its appearance, yet she sat watching and waiting; and while
  she thus waits, let us see what her purpose is.</p>

  <p>Her custom had been to go to market after nightfall. Stealing out
  unobserved, she would seek the shops in the Tyropoeon, or those over by the
  Fish Gate in the east, make her purchases of meat and vegetables, and return
  and shut herself up again.</p>

  <p>The pleasure she derived from the presence of Ben-Hur in the old house
  once more may be imagined. She had nothing to tell him of her mistress or
  Tirzah&mdash;nothing. He would have had her move to a place not so lonesome;
  she refused. She would have had him take his own room again, which was just
  as he had left it; but the danger of discovery was too great, and he wished
  above all things to avoid inquiry. He would come and see her often as
  possible. Coming in the night, he would also go away in the night. She was
  compelled to be satisfied, and at once occupied herself contriving ways to
  make him happy. That he was a man now did not occur to her; nor did it enter
  her mind that he might have put by or lost his boyish tastes; to please him,
  she thought to go on her old round of services. He used to be fond of
  confections; she remembered the things in that line which delighted him most,
  and resolved to make them, and have a supply always ready when he came. Could
  anything be happier? So next night, earlier than usual, she stole out with
  her basket, and went over to the Fish Gate Market. Wandering about, seeking
  the best honey, she chanced to hear a man telling a story.</p>

  <p>What the story was the reader can arrive at with sufficient certainty when
  told that the narrator was one of the men who had held torches for the
  commandant of the Tower of Antonia when, down in cell VI., the Hurs were
  found. The particulars of the finding were all told, and she heard them, with
  the names of the prisoners, and the widow's account of herself.</p>

  <p>The feelings with which Amrah listened to the recital were such as became
  the devoted creature she was. She made her purchases, and returned home in a
  dream. What a happiness she had in store for her boy! She had found his
  mother!</p>

  <p>She put the basket away, now laughing, now crying. Suddenly she stopped
  and thought. It would kill him to be told that his mother and Tirzah were
  lepers. He would go through the awful city over on the Hill of Evil
  Counsel&mdash;into each infected tomb he would go without rest, asking for
  them, and the disease would catch him, and their fate would be his. She wrung
  her hands. What should she do?</p>

  <p>Like many a one before her, and many a one since, she derived inspiration,
  if not wisdom, from her affection, and came to a singular conclusion.</p>

  <p>The lepers, she knew, were accustomed of mornings to come down from their
  sepulchral abodes in the hill, and take a supply of water for the day from
  the well En-rogel. Bringing their jars, they would set them on the ground and
  wait, standing afar until they were filled. To that the mistress and Tirzah
  must come; for the law was inexorable, and admitted no distinction. A rich
  leper was no better than a poor one.</p>

  <p>So Amrah decided not to speak to Ben-Hur of the story she had heard, but
  go alone to the well and wait. Hunger and thirst would drive the unfortunates
  thither, and she believed she could recognize them at sight; if not, they
  might recognize her.</p>

  <p>Meantime Ben-Hur came, and they talked much. To-morrow Malluch would
  arrive; then the search should be immediately begun. He was impatient to be
  about it. To amuse himself he would visit the sacred places in the vicinity.
  The secret, we may be sure, weighed heavily on the woman, but she held her
  peace.</p>

  <p>When he was gone she busied herself in the preparation of things good to
  eat, applying her utmost skill to the work. At the approach of day, as
  signalled by the stars, she filled the basket, selected a jar, and took the
  road to En-rogel, going out by the Fish Gate which was earliest open, and
  arriving as we have seen.</p>

  <p>Shortly after sunrise, when business at the well was most pressing, and
  the drawer of water most hurried; when, in fact, half a dozen buckets were in
  use at the same time, everybody making haste to get away before the cool of
  the morning melted into the heat of the day, the tenantry of the hill began
  to appear and move about the doors of their tombs. Somewhat later they were
  discernible in groups, of which not a few were children so young that they
  suggested the holiest relation. Numbers came momentarily around the turn of
  the bluff&mdash;women with jars upon their shoulders, old and very feeble men
  hobbling along on staffs and crutches. Some leaned upon the shoulders of
  others; a few&mdash;the utterly helpless&mdash;lay, like heaps of rags, upon
  litters. Even that community of superlative sorrow had its love-light to make
  life endurable and attractive. Distance softened without entirely veiling the
  misery of the outcasts.</p>

  <p>From her seat by the well Amrah kept watch upon the spectral groups. She
  scarcely moved. More than once she imagined she saw those she sought. That
  they were there upon the hill she had no doubt; that they must come down and
  near she knew; when the people at the well were all served they would
  come.</p>

  <p>Now, quite at the base of the bluff there was a tomb which had more than
  once attracted Amrah by its wide gaping. A stone of large dimensions stood
  near its mouth. The sun looked into it through the hottest hours of the day,
  and altogether it seemed uninhabitable by anything living, unless, perchance,
  by some wild dogs returning from scavenger duty down in Gehenna. Thence,
  however, and greatly to her surprise, the patient Egyptian beheld two women
  come, one half supporting, half leading, the other. They were both
  white-haired; both looked old; but their garments were not rent, and they
  gazed about them as if the locality were new. The witness below thought she
  even saw them shrink terrified at the spectacle offered by the hideous
  assemblage of which they found themselves part. Slight reasons, certainly, to
  make her heart beat faster, and draw her attention to them exclusively; but
  so they did.</p>

  <p>The two remained by the stone awhile; then they moved slowly, painfully,
  and with much fear towards the well, whereat several voices were raised to
  stop them; yet they kept on. The drawer of water picked up some pebbles, and
  made ready to drive them back. The company cursed them. The greater company
  on the hill shouted shrilly, "Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>"Surely," thought Amrah of the two, as they kept coming&mdash;"surely,
  they are strangers to the usage of lepers."</p>

  <p>She arose, and went to meet them, taking the basket and jar. The alarm at
  the well immediately subsided.</p>

  <p>"What a fool," said one, laughing, "what a fool to give good bread to the
  dead in that way!"</p>

  <p>"And to think of her coming so far!" said another. "I would at least make
  them meet me at the gate."</p>

  <p>Amrah, with better impulse, proceeded. If she should be mistaken! Her
  heart arose into her throat. And the farther she went the more doubtful and
  confused she became. Four or five yards from where they stood waiting for her
  she stopped.</p>

  <p>That the mistress she loved! whose hand she had so often kissed in
  gratitude! whose image of matronly loveliness she had treasured in memory so
  faithfully! And that the Tirzah she had nursed through babyhood! whose pains
  she had soothed, whose sports she had shared! that the smiling, sweet-faced,
  songful Tirzah, the light of the great house, the promised blessing of her
  old age! Her mistress, her darling&mdash;they? The soul of the woman sickened
  at the sight.</p>

  <p>"These are old women," she said to herself. "I never saw them before. I
  will go back."</p>

  <p>She turned away.</p>

  <p>"Amrah," said one of the lepers.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian dropped the jar, and looked back, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Who called me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Amrah."</p>

  <p>The servant's wondering eyes settled upon the speaker's face.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"We are they you are seeking."</p>

  <p>Amrah fell upon her knees.</p>

  <p>"O my mistress, my mistress! As I have made your God my God, be he praised
  that he has led me to you!"</p>

  <p>And upon her knees the poor overwhelmed creature began moving forward.</p>

  <p>"Stay, Amrah! Come not nearer. Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>The words sufficed. Amrah fell upon her face, sobbing so loud the people
  at the well heard her. Suddenly she arose upon her knees again.</p>

  <p>"O my mistress, where is Tirzah?"</p>

  <p>"Here I am, Amrah, here! Will you not bring me a little water?"</p>

  <p>The habit of the servant renewed itself. Putting back the coarse hair
  fallen over her face, Amrah arose and went to the basket and uncovered
  it.</p>

  <p>"See," she said, "here are bread and meat."</p>

  <p>She would have spread the napkin upon the ground, but the mistress spoke
  again,</p>

  <p>"Do not so, Amrah. Those yonder may stone you, and refuse us drink. Leave
  the basket with me. Take up the jar and fill it, and bring it here. We will
  carry them to the tomb with us. For this day you will then have rendered all
  the service that is lawful. Haste, Amrah."</p>

  <p>The people under whose eyes all this had passed made way for the servant,
  and even helped her fill the jar, so piteous was the grief her countenance
  showed.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" a woman asked.</p>

  <p>Amrah meekly answered, "They used to be good to me."</p>

  <p>Raising the jar upon her shoulder, she hurried back. In forgetfulness, she
  would have gone to them, but the cry "Unclean, unclean! Beware!" arrested
  her. Placing the water by the basket, she stepped back, and stood off a
  little way.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Amrah," said the mistress, taking the articles into
  possession. "This is very good of you."</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing more I can do?" asked Amrah.</p>

  <p>The mother's hand was upon the jar, and she was fevered with thirst; yet
  she paused, and rising, said firmly, "Yes, I know that Judah has come home. I
  saw him at the gate night before last asleep on the step. I saw you wake
  him."</p>

  <p>Amrah clasped her hands.</p>

  <p>"O my mistress! You saw it, and did not come!"</p>

  <p>"That would have been to kill him. I can never take him in my arms again.
  I can never kiss him more. O Amrah, Amrah, you love him, I know!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the true heart, bursting into tears again, and kneeling. "I
  would die for him."</p>

  <p>"Prove to me what you say, Amrah."</p>

  <p>"I am ready."</p>

  <p>"Then you shall not tell him where we are or that you have seen
  us&mdash;only that, Amrah."</p>

  <p>"But he is looking for you. He has come from afar to find you."</p>

  <p>"He must not find us. He shall not become what we are. Hear, Amrah. You
  shall serve us as you have this day. You shall bring us the little we
  need&mdash;not long now&mdash;not long. You shall come every morning and
  evening thus, and&mdash;and"&mdash;the voice trembled, the strong will almost
  broke down&mdash;"and you shall tell us of him, Amrah; but to him you shall
  say nothing of us. Hear you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it will be so hard to hear him speak of you, and see him going about
  looking for you&mdash;to see all his love, and not tell him so much as that
  you are alive!"</p>

  <p>"Can you tell him we are well, Amrah?"</p>

  <p>The servant bowed her head in her arms.</p>

  <p>"No," the mistress continued; "wherefore to be silent altogether. Go now,
  and come this evening. We will look for you. Till then, farewell."</p>

  <p>"The burden will be heavy, O my mistress, and hard to bear," said Amrah,
  falling upon her face.</p>

  <p>"How much harder would it be to see him as we are," the mother answered as
  she gave the basket to Tirzah. "Come again this evening," she repeated,
  taking up the water, and starting for the tomb.</p>

  <p>Amrah waited kneeling until they had disappeared; then she took the road
  sorrowfully home.</p>

  <p>In the evening she returned; and thereafter it became her custom to serve
  them in the morning and evening, so that they wanted for nothing needful. The
  tomb, though ever so stony and desolate, was less cheerless than the cell in
  the Tower had been. Daylight gilded its door, and it was in the beautiful
  world. Then, one can wait death with so much more faith out under the open
  sky.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch606"
     name="ch606"></a>VI. &mdash; A TRICK OF PILATE'S&mdash;THE COMBAT</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning of the first day of the seventh
  month&mdash;Tishri in the Hebrew, October in English&mdash;Ben-Hur arose from
  his couch in the khan ill satisfied with the whole world.</p>

  <p>Little time had been lost in consultation upon the arrival of Malluch. The
  latter began the search at the Tower of Antonia, and began it boldly, by a
  direct inquiry of the tribune commanding. He gave the officer a history of
  the Hurs, and all the particulars of the accident to Gratus, describing the
  affair as wholly without criminality. The object of the quest now, he said,
  was if any of the unhappy family were discovered alive to carry a petition to
  the feet of Caesar, praying restitution of the estate and return to their
  civil rights. Such a petition, he had no doubt, would result in an
  investigation by the imperial order, a proceeding of which the friends of the
  family had no fear.</p>

  <p>In reply the tribune stated circumstantially the discovery of the women in
  the Tower, and permitted a reading of the memorandum he had taken of their
  account of themselves; when leave to copy it was prayed, he even permitted
  that.</p>

  <p>Malluch thereupon hurried to Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>It were useless to attempt description of the effect the terrible story
  had upon the young man. The pain was not relieved by tears or passionate
  outcries; it was too deep for any expression. He sat still a long time, with
  pallid face and laboring heart. Now and then, as if to show the thoughts
  which were most poignant, he muttered,</p>

  <p>"Lepers, lepers! They&mdash;my mother and Tirzah&mdash;they lepers! How
  long, how long, O Lord!"</p>

  <p>One moment he was torn by a virtuous rage of sorrow, next by a longing for
  vengeance which, it must be admitted, was scarcely less virtuous.</p>

  <p>At length he arose.</p>

  <p>"I must look for them. They may be dying."</p>

  <p>"Where will you look?" asked Malluch.</p>

  <p>"There is but one place for them to go."</p>

  <p>Malluch interposed, and finally prevailed so far as to have the management
  of the further attempt intrusted to him. Together they went to the gate over
  on the side opposite the Hill of Evil Counsel, immemorially the lepers'
  begging-ground. There they stayed all day, giving alms, asking for the two
  women, and offering rich rewards for their discovery. So they did in
  repetition day after day through the remainder of the fifth month, and all
  the sixth. There was diligent scouring of the dread city on the hill by
  lepers to whom the rewards offered were mighty incentives, for they were only
  dead in law. Over and over again the gaping tomb down by the well was
  invaded, and its tenants subjected to inquiry; but they kept their secret
  fast. The result was failure. And now, the morning of the first day of the
  seventh month, the extent of the additional information gained was that not
  long before two leprous women had been stoned from the Fish Gate by the
  authorities. A little pressing of the clew, together with some shrewd
  comparison of dates, led to the sad assurance that the sufferers were the
  Hurs, and left the old questions darker than ever. Where were they? And what
  had become of them?</p>

  <p>"It was not enough that my people should be made lepers," said the son,
  over and over again, with what intensity of bitterness the reader may
  imagine; "that was not enough. Oh no! They must be stoned from their native
  city! My mother is dead! she has wandered to the wilderness! she is dead!
  Tirzah is dead! I alone am left. And for what? How long, O God, thou Lord God
  of my fathers, how long shall this Rome endure?"</p>

  <p>Angry, hopeless, vengeful, he entered the court of the khan, and found it
  crowded with people come in during the night. While he ate his breakfast, he
  listened to some of them. To one party he was specially attracted. They were
  mostly young, stout, active, hardy men, in manner and speech provincial. In
  their look, the certain indefinable air, the pose of the head, glance of the
  eye, there was a spirit which did not, as a rule, belong to the outward
  seeming of the lower orders of Jerusalem; the spirit thought by some to be a
  peculiarity of life in mountainous districts, but which may be more surely
  traced to a life of healthful freedom. In a short time he ascertained they
  were Galileans, in the city for various purposes, but chiefly to take part in
  the Feast of Trumpets, set for that day. They became to him at once objects
  of interest, as hailing from the region in which he hoped to find readiest
  support in the work he was shortly to set about.</p>

  <p>While observing them, his mind running ahead in thought of achievements
  possible to a legion of such spirits disciplined after the severe Roman
  style, a man came into the court, his face much flushed, his eyes bright with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Why are you here?" he said to the Galileans. "The rabbis and elders are
  going from the Temple to see Pilate. Come, make haste, and let us go with
  them."</p>

  <p>They surrounded him in a moment.</p>

  <p>"To see Pilate! For what?"</p>

  <p>"They have discovered a conspiracy. Pilate's new aqueduct is to be paid
  for with money of the Temple."</p>

  <p>"What, with the sacred treasure?"</p>

  <p>They repeated the question to each other with flashing eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is Corban&mdash;money of God. Let him touch a shekel of it if he
  dare!"</p>

  <p>"Come," cried the messenger. "The procession is by this time across the
  bridge. The whole city is pouring after. We may be needed. Make haste!"</p>

  <p>As if the thought and the act were one, there was quick putting away of
  useless garments, and the party stood forth bareheaded, and in the short
  sleeveless under-tunics they were used to wearing as reapers in the field and
  boatmen on the lake&mdash;the garb in which they climbed the hills following
  the herds, and plucked the ripened vintage, careless of the sun. Lingering
  only to tighten their girdles, they said, "We are ready."</p>

  <p>Then Ben-Hur spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"Men of Galilee," he said, "I am a son of Judah. Will you take me in your
  company?"</p>

  <p>"We may have to fight," they replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then, I will not be first to run away!"</p>

  <p>They took the retort in good humor, and the messenger said, "You seem
  stout enough. Come along."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur put off his outer garments.</p>

  <p>"You think there may be fighting?" he asked, quietly, as he tightened his
  girdle.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"With whom?"</p>

  <p>"The guard."</p>

  <p>"Legionaries?"</p>

  <p>"Whom else can a Roman trust?"</p>

  <p>"What have you to fight with?"</p>

  <p>They looked at him silently.</p>

  <p>"Well," he continued, "we will have to do the best we can; but had we not
  better choose a leader? The legionaries always have one, and so are able to
  act with one mind."</p>

  <p>The Galileans stared more curiously, as if the idea were new to them.</p>

  <p>"Let us at least agree to stay together," he said. "Now I am ready, if you
  are."</p>

  <p>"Yes, let us go."</p>

  <p>The khan, it should not be forgotten, was in Bezetha, the new town; and to
  get to the Praetorium, as the Romans resonantly styled the palace of Herod on
  Mount Zion, the party had to cross the lowlands north and west of the Temple.
  By streets&mdash;if they may be so called&mdash;trending north and south,
  with intersections hardly up to the dignity of alleys, they passed rapidly
  round the Akra district to the Tower of Mariamne, from which the way was
  short to the grand gate of the walled heights. In going, they overtook, or
  were overtaken by, people like themselves stirred to wrath by news of the
  proposed desecration. When, at length, they reached the gate of the
  Praetorium, the procession of elders and rabbis had passed in with a great
  following, leaving a greater crowd clamoring outside.</p>

  <p>A centurion kept the entrance with a guard drawn up full armed under the
  beautiful marble battlements. The sun struck the soldiers fervidly on helm
  and shield; but they kept their ranks indifferent alike to its dazzle and to
  the mouthings of the rabble. Through the open bronze gates a current of
  citizens poured in, while a much lesser one poured out.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?" one of the Galileans asked an outcomer.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the reply. "The rabbis are before the door of the palace
  asking to see Pilate. He has refused to come out. They have sent one to tell
  him they will not go away till he has heard them. They are waiting."</p>

  <p>"Let us go in," said Ben-Hur, in his quiet way, seeing what his companions
  probably did not, that there was not only a disagreement between the suitors
  and the governor, but an issue joined, and a serious question as to who
  should have his will.</p>

  <p>Inside the gate there was a row of trees in leaf, with seats under them.
  The people, whether going or coming, carefully avoided the shade cast
  gratefully upon the white, clean-swept pavement; for, strange as it may seem,
  a rabbinical ordinance, alleged to have been derived from the law, permitted
  no green thing to be grown within the walls of Jerusalem. Even the wise king,
  it was said, wanting a garden for his Egyptian bride, was constrained to
  found it down in the meeting-place of the valleys above En-rogel.</p>

  <p>Through the tree-tops shone the outer fronts of the palace. Turning to the
  right, the party proceeded a short distance to a spacious square, on the west
  side of which stood the residence of the governor. An excited multitude
  filled the square. Every face was directed towards a portico built over a
  broad doorway which was closed. Under the portico there was another array of
  legionaries.</p>

  <p>The throng was so close the friends could not well have advanced if such
  had been their desire; they remained therefore in the rear, observers of what
  was going on. About the portico they could see the high turbans of the
  rabbis, whose impatience communicated at times to the mass behind them; a cry
  was frequent to the effect "Pilate, if thou be a governor, come forth, come
  forth!"</p>

  <p>Once a man coming out pushed through the crowd, his face red with
  anger.</p>

  <p>"Israel is of no account here," he said, in a loud voice. "On this holy
  ground we are no better than dogs of Rome."</p>

  <p>"Will he not come out, think you?"</p>

  <p>"Come? Has he not thrice refused?"</p>

  <p>"What will the rabbis do?"</p>

  <p>"As at Caesarea&mdash;camp here till he gives them ear."</p>

  <p>"He will not dare touch the treasure, will he?" asked one of the
  Galileans.</p>

  <p>"Who can say? Did not a Roman profane the Holy of Holies? Is there
  anything sacred from Romans?"</p>

  <p>An hour passed, and though Pilate deigned them no answer, the rabbis and
  crowd remained. Noon came, bringing a shower from the west, but no change in
  the situation, except that the multitude was larger and much noisier, and the
  feeling more decidedly angry. The shouting was almost continuous, Come forth,
  come forth! The cry was sometimes with disrespectful variations. Meanwhile
  Ben-Hur held his Galilean friends together. He judged the pride of the Roman
  would eventually get the better of his discretion, and that the end could not
  be far off. Pilate was but waiting for the people to furnish him an excuse
  for resort to violence.</p>

  <p>And at last the end came. In the midst of the assemblage there was heard
  the sound of blows, succeeded instantly by yells of pain and rage, and a most
  furious commotion. The venerable men in front of the portico faced about
  aghast. The common people in the rear at first pushed forward; in the centre,
  the effort was to get out; and for a short time the pressure of opposing
  forces was terrible. A thousand voices made inquiry, raised all at once; as
  no one had time to answer, the surprise speedily became a panic.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur kept his senses.</p>

  <p>"You cannot see?" he said to one of the Galileans.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I will raise you up."</p>

  <p>He caught the man about the middle, and lifted him bodily.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I see now," said the man. "There are some armed with clubs, and they are
  beating the people. They are dressed like Jews."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Romans, as the Lord liveth! Romans in disguise. Their clubs fly like
  flails! There, I saw a rabbi struck down&mdash;an old man! They spare
  nobody!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur let the man down.</p>

  <p>"Men of Galilee," he said, "it is a trick of Pilate's. Now, will you do
  what I say, we will get even with the club-men."</p>

  <p>The Galilean spirit arose.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" they answered.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to the trees by the gate, and we may find the planting of
  Herod, though unlawful, has some good in it after all. Come!"</p>

  <p>They ran back all of them fast as they could; and, by throwing their
  united weight upon the limbs, tore them from the trunks. In a brief time
  they, too, were armed. Returning, at the corner of the square they met the
  crowd rushing madly for the gate. Behind, the clamor continued&mdash;a medley
  of shrieks, groans, and execrations.</p>

  <p>"To the wall!" Ben-Hur shouted. "To the wall!&mdash;and let the herd go
  by!"</p>

  <p>So, clinging to the masonry at their right hand, they escaped the might of
  the rush, and little by little made headway until, at last, the square was
  reached.</p>

  <p>"Keep together now, and follow me!"</p>

  <p>By this time Ben-Hur's leadership was perfect; and as he pushed into the
  seething mob his party closed after him in a body. And when the Romans,
  clubbing the people and making merry as they struck them down, came hand to
  hand with the Galileans, lithe of limb, eager for the fray, and equally
  armed, they were in turn surprised. Then the shouting was close and fierce;
  the crash of sticks rapid and deadly; the advance furious as hate could make
  it. No one performed his part as well as Ben-Hur, whose training served him
  admirably; for, not merely he knew to strike and guard; his long arm, perfect
  action, and incomparable strength helped him, also, to success in every
  encounter. He was at the same time fighting-man and leader. The club he
  wielded was of goodly length and weighty, so he had need to strike a man but
  once. He seemed, moreover, to have eyes for each combat of his friends, and
  the faculty of being at the right moment exactly where he was most needed. In
  his fighting cry there were inspiration for his party and alarm for his
  enemies. Thus surprised and equally matched, the Romans at first retired, but
  finally turned their backs and fled to the portico. The impetuous Galileans
  would have pursued them to the steps, but Ben-Hur wisely restrained them.</p>

  <p>"Stay, my men!" he said. "The centurion yonder is coming with the guard.
  They have swords and shields; we cannot fight them. We have done well; let us
  get back and out of the gate while we may."</p>

  <p>They obeyed him, though slowly; for they had frequently to step over their
  countrymen lying where they had been felled; some writhing and groaning, some
  praying help, others mute as the dead. But the fallen were not all Jews. In
  that there was consolation.</p>

  <p>The centurion shouted to them as they went off; Ben-Hur laughed at him,
  and replied in his own tongue, "If we are dogs of Israel, you are jackals of
  Rome. Remain here, and we will come again."</p>

  <p>The Galileans cheered, and laughing went on.</p>

  <p>Outside the gate there was a multitude the like of which Ben-Hur had never
  seen, not even in the circus at Antioch. The house-tops, the streets, the
  slope of the hill, appeared densely covered with people wailing and praying.
  The air was filled with their cries and imprecations.</p>

  <p>The party were permitted to pass without challenge by the outer guard. But
  hardly were they out before the centurion in charge at the portico appeared,
  and in the gateway called to Ben-Hur,</p>

  <p>"Ho, insolent! Art thou a Roman or a Jew?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur answered, "I am a son of Judah, born here. What wouldst thou with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Stay and fight."</p>

  <p>"Singly?"</p>

  <p>"As thou wilt!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur laughed derisively.</p>

  <p>"O brave Roman! Worthy son of the bastard Roman Jove! I have no arms."</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt have mine," the centurion answered. "I will borrow of the
  guard here."</p>

  <p>The people in hearing of the colloquy became silent; and from them the
  hush spread afar. But lately Ben-Hur had beaten a Roman under the eyes of
  Antioch and the Farther East; now, could he beat another one under the eyes
  of Jerusalem, the honor might be vastly profitable to the cause of the New
  King. He did not hesitate. Going frankly to the centurion, he said, "I am
  willing. Lend me thy sword and shield."</p>

  <p>"And the helm and breastplate?" asked the Roman.</p>

  <p>"Keep them. They might not fit me."</p>

  <p>The arms were as frankly delivered, and directly the centurion was ready.
  All this time the soldiers in rank close by the gate never moved; they simply
  listened. As to the multitude, only when the combatants advanced to begin the
  fight the question sped from mouth to mouth, "Who is he?" And no one
  knew.</p>

  <p>Now the Roman supremacy in arms lay in three things&mdash;submission to
  discipline, the legionary formation of battle, and a peculiar use of the
  short sword. In combat, they never struck or cut; from first to last they
  thrust&mdash;they advanced thrusting, they retired thrusting; and generally
  their aim was at the foeman's face. All this was well known to Ben-Hur. As
  they were about to engage he said,</p>

  <p>"I told thee I was a son of Judah; but I did not tell that I am
  lanista-taught. Defend thyself!"</p>

  <p>At the last word Ben-Hur closed with his antagonist. A moment, standing
  foot to foot, they glared at each other over the rims of their embossed
  shields; then the Roman pushed forward and feinted an under-thrust. The Jew
  laughed at him. A thrust at the face followed. The Jew stepped lightly to the
  left; quick as the thrust was, the step was quicker. Under the lifted arm of
  the foe he slid his shield, advancing it until the sword and sword-arm were
  both caught on its upper surface; another step, this time forward and left,
  and the man's whole right side was offered to the point. The centurion fell
  heavily on his breast, clanging the pavement, and Ben-Hur had won. With his
  foot upon his enemy's back, he raised his shield overhead after a
  gladiatorial custom, and saluted the imperturbable soldiers by the gate.</p>

  <p>When the people realized the victory they behaved like mad. On the houses
  far as the Xystus, fast as the word could fly, they waved their shawls and
  handkerchiefs and shouted; and if he had consented, the Galileans would have
  carried Ben-Hur off upon their shoulders.</p>

  <p>To a petty officer who then advanced from the gate he said, "Thy comrade
  died like a soldier. I leave him undespoiled. Only his sword and shield are
  mine."</p>

  <p>With that, he walked away. Off a little he spoke to the Galileans.</p>

  <p>"Brethren, you have behaved well. Let us now separate, lest we be pursued.
  Meet me to-night at the khan in Bethany. I have something to propose to you
  of great interest to Israel."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" they asked him.</p>

  <p>"A son of Judah," he answered, simply.</p>

  <p>A throng eager to see him surged around the party.</p>

  <p>"Will you come to Bethany?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will come."</p>

  <p>"Then bring with you this sword and shield that I may know you."</p>

  <p>Pushing brusquely through the increasing crowd, he speedily
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>At the instance of Pilate, the people went up from the city, and carried
  off their dead and wounded, and there was much mourning for them; but the
  grief was greatly lightened by the victory of the unknown champion, who was
  everywhere sought, and by every one extolled. The fainting spirit of the
  nation was revived by the brave deed; insomuch that in the streets and up in
  the Temple even, amidst the solemnities of the feast, old tales of the
  Maccabees were told again, and thousands shook their heads whispering
  wisely,</p>

  <p>"A little longer, only a little longer, brethren, and Israel will come to
  her own. Let there be faith in the Lord, and patience."</p>

  <p>In such manner Ben-Hur obtained hold on Galilee, and paved the way to
  greater services in the cause of the King Who Was Coming.</p>

  <p>And with what result we shall see.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch701"
     name="ch701"></a>I. &mdash; JERUSALEM GOES OUT TO A PROPHET</h2>

  <p class="first">The meeting took place in the khan of Bethany as appointed.
  Thence Ben-Hur went with the Galileans into their country, where his exploits
  up in the old Market-place gave him fame and influence. Before the winter was
  gone he raised three legions, and organized them after the Roman pattern. He
  could have had as many more, for the martial spirit of that gallant people
  never slept. The proceeding, however, required careful guarding as against
  both Rome and Herod Antipas. Contenting himself for the present with the
  three, he strove to train and educate them for systematic action. For that
  purpose he carried the officers over into the lava-beds of Trachonitis, and
  taught them the use of arms, particularly the javelin and sword, and the
  manoeuvering peculiar to the legionary formation; after which he sent them
  home as teachers. And soon the training became a pastime of the people.</p>

  <p>As may be thought, the task called for patience, skill, zeal, faith, and
  devotion on his part&mdash;qualities into which the power of inspiring others
  in matters of difficulty is always resolvable; and never man possessed them
  in greater degree or used them to better effect. How he labored! And with
  utter denial of self! Yet withal he would have failed but for the support he
  had from Simonides, who furnished him arms and money, and from Ilderim, who
  kept watch and brought him supplies. And still he would have failed but for
  the genius of the Galileans.</p>

  <p>Under that name were comprehended the four tribes&mdash;Asher, Zebulon,
  Issachar, and Naphthali&mdash;and the districts originally set apart to them.
  The Jew born in sight of the Temple despised these brethren of the north; but
  the Talmud itself has said, "The Galilean loves honor, and the Jew
  money."</p>

  <p>Hating Rome fervidly as they loved their own country, in every revolt they
  were first in the field and last to leave it. One hundred and fifty thousand
  Galilean youths perished in the final war with Rome. For the great festal
  days, they went up to Jerusalem marching and camping like armies; yet they
  were liberal in sentiment, and even tolerant to heathenism. In Herod's
  beautiful cities, which were Roman in all things, in Sepphoris and Tiberias
  especially, they took pride, and in the building them gave loyal support.
  They had for fellow-citizens men from the outside world everywhere, and lived
  in peace with them. To the glory of the Hebrew name they contributed poets
  like the singer of the Song of Songs and prophets like Hosea.</p>

  <p>Upon such a people, so quick, so proud, so brave, so devoted, so
  imaginative, a tale like that of the coming of the King was all-powerful.
  That he was coming to put Rome down would have been sufficient to enlist them
  in the scheme proposed by Ben-Hur; but when, besides, they were assured he
  was to rule the world, more mighty than Caesar, more magnificent than
  Solomon, and that the rule was to last forever, the appeal was irresistible,
  and they vowed themselves to the cause body and soul. They asked Ben-Hur his
  authority for the sayings, and he quoted the prophets, and told them of
  Balthasar in waiting over in Antioch; and they were satisfied, for it was the
  old much-loved legend of the Messiah, familiar to them almost as the name of
  the Lord; the long-cherished dream with a time fixed for its realization. The
  King was not merely coming now; he was at hand.</p>

  <p>So with Ben-Hur the winter months rolled by, and spring came, with
  gladdening showers blown over from the summering sea in the west; and by that
  time so earnestly and successfully had he toiled that he could say to himself
  and his followers, "Let the good King come. He has only to tell us where he
  will have his throne set up. We have the sword-hands to keep it for him."</p>

  <p>And in all his dealings with the many men they knew him only as a son of
  Judah, and by that name.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One evening, over in Trachonitis, Ben-Hur was sitting with
  some of his Galileans at the mouth of the cave in which he quartered, when an
  Arab courier rode to him, and delivered a letter. Breaking the package, he
  read,</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Jerusalem, Nisan IV.</p>

  <p class="letter">"A prophet has appeared who men say is Elias. He has been
  in the wilderness for years, and to our eyes he is a prophet; and such also
  is his speech, the burden of which is of one much greater than himself, who,
  he says, is to come presently, and for whom he is now waiting on the eastern
  shore of the River Jordan. I have been to see and hear him, and the one he is
  waiting for is certainly the King you are awaiting. Come and judge for
  yourself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"All Jerusalem is going out to the prophet, and with many
  people else the shore on which he abides is like Mount Olivet in the last
  days of the Passover.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"Malluch.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>Ben-Hur's face flushed with joy.</p>

  <p>"By this word, O my friends," he said&mdash;"by this word, our waiting is
  at end. The herald of the King has appeared and announced him."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the letter read, they also rejoiced at the promise it held
  out.</p>

  <p>"Get ready now," he added, "and in the morning set your faces homeward;
  when arrived there, send word to those under you, and bid them be ready to
  assemble as I may direct. For myself and you, I will go see if the King be
  indeed at hand, and send you report. Let us, in the meantime, live in the
  pleasure of the promise."</p>

  <p>Going into the cave, he addressed a letter to Ilderim, and another to
  Simonides, giving notice of the news received, and of his purpose to go up
  immediately to Jerusalem. The letters he despatched by swift messengers. When
  night fell, and the stars of direction came out, he mounted, and with an Arab
  guide set out for the Jordan, intending to strike the track of the caravans
  between Rabbath-Ammon and Damascus.</p>

  <p>The guide was sure, and Aldebaran swift; so by midnight the two were out
  of the lava fastness speeding southward.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch702"
     name="ch702"></a>II. &mdash; NOONING BY THE POOL&mdash;IRAS</h2>

  <p class="first">It was Ben-Hur's purpose to turn aside at the break of day,
  and find a safe place in which to rest; but the dawn overtook him while out
  in the Desert, and he kept on, the guide promising to bring him afterwhile to
  a vale shut in by great rocks, where there were a spring, some
  mulberry-trees, and herbage in plenty for the horses.</p>

  <p>As he rode thinking of the wondrous events so soon to happen, and of the
  changes they were to bring about in the affairs of men and nations, the
  guide, ever on the alert, called attention to an appearance of strangers
  behind them. Everywhere around the Desert stretched away in waves of sand,
  slowly yellowing in the growing light, and without any green thing visible.
  Over on the left, but still far off, a range of low mountains extended,
  apparently interminable. In the vacancy of such a waste an object in motion
  could not long continue a mystery.</p>

  <p>"It is a camel with riders," the guide said, directly.</p>

  <p>"Are there others behind?" said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"It is alone. No, there is a man on horseback&mdash;the driver,
  probably."</p>

  <p>A little later Ben-Hur himself could see the camel was white and unusually
  large, reminding him of the wonderful animal he had seen bring Balthasar and
  Iras to the fountain in the Grove of Daphne. There could be no other like it.
  Thinking then of the fair Egyptian, insensibly his gait became slower, and at
  length fell into the merest loiter, until finally he could discern a
  curtained houdah, and two persons seated within it. If they were Balthasar
  and Iras! Should he make himself known to them? But it could not be: this was
  the Desert&mdash;and they were alone. But while he debated the question the
  long swinging stride of the camel brought its riders up to him. He heard the
  ringing of the tiny bells, and beheld the rich housings which had been so
  attractive to the crowd at the Castalian fount. He beheld also the Ethiopian,
  always attendant upon the Egyptians. The tall brute stopped close by his
  horse, and Ben-Hur, looking up, lo! Iras herself under the raised curtain
  looking down at him, her great swimming eyes bright with astonishment and
  inquiry!</p>

  <p>"The blessing of the true God upon you!" said Balthasar, in his tremulous
  voice.</p>

  <p>"And to thee and thine be the peace of the Lord," Ben-Hur replied.</p>

  <p>"My eyes are weak with years," said Balthasar; "but they approve you that
  son of Hur whom lately I knew an honored guest in the tent of Ilderim the
  Generous."</p>

  <p>"And thou art that Balthasar, the wise Egyptian, whose speech concerning
  certain holy things in expectation is having so much to do with the finding
  me in this waste place. What dost thou here?"</p>

  <p>"He is never alone who is where God is&mdash;and God is everywhere,"
  Balthasar answered, gravely; "but in the sense of your asking, there is a
  caravan short way behind us going to Alexandria; and as it is to pass through
  Jerusalem, I thought best to avail myself of its company as far as the Holy
  City, whither I am journeying. This morning, however, in discontent with its
  slow movement&mdash;slower because of a Roman cohort in attendance upon
  it&mdash;we rose early, and ventured thus far in advance. As to robbers along
  the way, we are not afraid, for I have here a signet of Sheik Ilderim;
  against beasts of prey, God is our sufficient trust."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur bowed and said, "The good sheik's signet is a safeguard wherever
  the wilderness extends, and the lion shall be swift that overtakes this king
  of his kind."</p>

  <p>He patted the neck of the camel as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Yet," said Iras, with a smile which was not lost upon the youth, whose
  eyes, it must be admitted, had several times turned to her during the
  interchange of speeches with the elder&mdash;"Yet even he would be better if
  his fast were broken. Kings have hunger and headaches. If you be, indeed, the
  Ben-Hur of whom my father has spoken, and whom it was my pleasure to have
  known as well, you will be happy, I am sure, to show us some near path to
  living water, that with its sparkle we may grace a morning's meal in the
  Desert."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur, nothing loath, hastened to answer.</p>

  <p>"Fair Egyptian, I give you sympathy. Can you bear suffering a little
  longer, we will find the spring you ask for, and I promise that its draught
  shall be as sweet and cooling as that of the more famous Castalia. With
  leave, we will make haste."</p>

  <p>"I give you the blessing of the thirsty," she replied; "and offer you in
  return a bit of bread from the city ovens, dipped in fresh butter from the
  dewy meadows of Damascus."</p>

  <p>"A most rare favor! Let us go on."</p>

  <p>So saying, Ben-Hur rode forward with the guide, one of the inconveniences
  of travelling with camels being that it is necessarily an interdiction of
  polite conversation.</p>

  <p>Afterwhile the party came to a shallow wady, down which, turning to the
  right hand, the guide led them. The bed of the cut was somewhat soft from
  recent rains, and quite bold in its descent. Momentarily, however, it
  widened; and erelong the sides became bluffs ribbed with rocks much scarred
  by floods rushing to lower depths ahead. Finally, from a narrow passage, the
  travellers entered a spreading vale which was very delightful; but come upon
  suddenly from the yellow, unrelieved, verdureless plain, it had the effect of
  a freshly discovered Paradise. The water-channels winding here and there,
  definable by crisp white shingling, appeared like threads tangled among
  islands green with grasses and fringed with reeds. Up from the final depths
  of the valley of the Jordan some venturous oleanders had crept, and with
  their large bloom now starred the sunken place. One palm-tree arose in royal
  assertion. The bases of the boundary-walls were cloaked with clambering
  vines, and under a leaning cliff over on the left the mulberry grove had
  planted itself, proclaiming the spring which the party were seeking. And
  thither the guide conducted them, careless of whistling partridges and lesser
  birds of brighter hues roused whirring from the reedy coverts.</p>

  <p>The water started from a crack in the cliff which some loving hand had
  enlarged into an arched cavity. Graven over it in bold Hebraic letters was
  the word <span class="smcap">God.</span> The graver had no doubt drunk there,
  and tarried many days, and given thanks in that durable form. From the arch
  the stream ran merrily over a flag spotted with bright moss, and leaped into
  a pool glassy clear; thence it stole away between grassy banks, nursing the
  trees before it vanished in the thirsty sand. A few narrow paths were
  noticeable about the margin of the pool; otherwise the space around was
  untrodden turf, at sight of which the guide was assured of rest free from
  intrusion by men. The horses were presently turned loose, and from the
  kneeling camel the Ethiopian assisted Balthasar and Iras; whereupon the old
  man, turning his face to the east, crossed his hands reverently upon his
  breast and prayed.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a cup," Iras said, with some impatience.</p>

  <p>From the houdah the slave brought her a crystal goblet; then she said to
  Ben-Hur,</p>

  <p>"I will be your servant at the fountain."</p>

  <p>They walked to the pool together. He would have dipped the water for her,
  but she refused his offer, and kneeling, held the cup to be filled by the
  stream itself; nor yet content, when it was cooled and overrunning, she
  tendered him the first draught.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, putting the graceful hand aside, and seeing only the large
  eyes half hidden beneath the arches of the upraised brows, "be the service
  mine, I pray."</p>

  <p>She persisted in having her way.</p>

  <p>"In my country, O son of Hur, we have a saying, 'Better a cupbearer to the
  fortunate than minister to a king.'"</p>

  <p>"Fortunate!" he said.</p>

  <p>There were both surprise and inquiry in the tone of his voice and in his
  look, and she said quickly,</p>

  <p>"The gods give us success as a sign by which we may know them on our side.
  Were you not winner in the Circus?"</p>

  <p>His cheeks began to flush.</p>

  <p>"That was one sign. There is another. In a combat with swords you slew a
  Roman."</p>

  <p>The flush deepened&mdash;not so much for the triumphs themselves as the
  flattery there was in the thought that she had followed his career with
  interest. A moment, and the pleasure was succeeded by a reflection. The
  combat, he knew, was matter of report throughout the East; but the name of
  the victor had been committed to a very few&mdash;Malluch, Ilderim, and
  Simonides. Could they have made a confidante of the woman? So with wonder and
  gratification he was confused; and seeing it, she arose and said, holding the
  cup over the pool,</p>

  <p>"O gods of Egypt! I give thanks for a hero discovered&mdash;thanks that
  the victim in the Palace of Idernee was not my king of men. And so, O holy
  gods, I pour and drink."</p>

  <p>Part of the contents of the cup she returned to the stream, the rest she
  drank. When she took the crystal from her lips, she laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"O son of Hur, is it a fashion of the very brave to be so easily overcome
  by a woman? Take the cup now, and see if you cannot find a happy word in it
  for me"</p>

  <p>He took the cup, and stooped to refill it.</p>

  <p>"A son of Israel has no gods whom he can libate," he said, playing with
  the water to hide his amazement, now greater than before. What more did the
  Egyptian know about him? Had she been told of his relations with Simonides?
  And there was the treaty with Ilderim&mdash;had she knowledge of that also?
  He was struck with mistrust. Somebody had betrayed his secrets, and they were
  serious. And, besides, he was going to Jerusalem, just then of all the world
  the place where such intelligence possessed by an enemy might be most
  dangerous to him, his associates, and the cause. But was she an enemy? It is
  well for us that, while writing is slow, thought is instantaneous. When the
  cup was fairly cooled, he filled it and arose, saying, with indifference well
  affected,</p>

  <p>"Most fair, were I an Egyptian or a Greek or a Roman, I would
  say"&mdash;he raised the goblet overhead as he spoke&mdash;"O ye better gods!
  I give thanks that there are yet left to the world, despite its wrongs and
  sufferings, the charm of beauty and the solace of love, and I drink to her
  who best represents them&mdash;to Iras, loveliest of the daughters of the
  Nile!"</p>

  <p>She laid her hand softly upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You have offended against the law. The gods you have drunk to are false
  gods. Why shall I not tell the rabbis on you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he replied, laughing, "that is very little to tell for one who knows
  so much else that is really important."</p>

  <p>"I will go further&mdash;I will go to the little Jewess who makes the
  roses grow and the shadows flame in the house of the great merchant over in
  Antioch. To the rabbis I will accuse you of impenitence; to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, to her?"</p>

  <p>"I will repeat what you have said to me under the lifted cup, with the
  gods for witnesses."</p>

  <p>He was still a moment, as if waiting for the Egyptian to go on. With
  quickened fancy he saw Esther at her father's side listening to the
  despatches he had forwarded&mdash;sometimes reading them. In her presence he
  had told Simonides the story of the affair in the Palace of Idernee. She and
  Iras were acquainted; this one was shrewd and worldly; the other was simple
  and affectionate, and therefore easily won. Simonides could not have broken
  faith&mdash;nor Ilderim&mdash;for if not held by honor, there was no one,
  unless it might be himself, to whom the consequences of exposure were more
  serious and certain. Could Esther have been the Egyptian's informant? He did
  not accuse her; yet a suspicion was sown with the thought, and suspicions, as
  we all know, are weeds of the mind which grow of themselves, and most rapidly
  when least wanted. Before he could answer the allusion to the little Jewess,
  Balthasar came to the pool.</p>

  <p>"We are greatly indebted to you, son of Hur," he said, in his grave
  manner. "This vale is very beautiful; the grass, the trees, the shade, invite
  us to stay and rest, and the spring here has the sparkle of diamonds in
  motion, and sings to me of a loving God. It is not enough to thank you for
  the enjoyment we find; come sit with us, and taste our bread."</p>

  <p>"Suffer me first to serve you."</p>

  <p>With that Ben-Hur filled the goblet, and gave it to Balthasar, who lifted
  his eyes in thanksgiving.</p>

  <p>Immediately the slave brought napkins; and after laving their hands and
  drying them, the three seated themselves in Eastern style under the tent
  which years before had served the Wise Men at the meeting in the Desert. And
  they ate heartily of the good things taken from the camel's pack.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch703"
     name="ch703"></a>III. &mdash; THE LIFE OF A SOUL</h2>

  <p class="first">The tent was cosily pitched beneath a tree where the gurgle
  of the stream was constantly in ear. Overhead the broad leaves hung
  motionless on their stems; the delicate reed-stalks off in the pearly haze
  stood up arrowy-straight; occasionally a home-returning bee shot humming
  athwart the shade, and a partridge creeping from the sedge drank, whistled to
  his mate, and ran away. The restfulness of the vale, the freshness of the
  air, the garden beauty, the Sabbath stillness, seemed to have affected the
  spirits of the elder Egyptian; his voice, gestures, and whole manner were
  unusually gentle; and often as he bent his eyes upon Ben-Hur conversing with
  Iras, they softened with pity.</p>

  <p>"When we overtook you, son of Hur," he said, at the conclusion of the
  repast, "it seemed your face was also turned towards Jerusalem. May I ask,
  without offence, if you are going so far?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to the Holy City."</p>

  <p>"For the great need I have to spare myself prolonged toil, I will further
  ask you, Is there a shorter road than that by Rabbath-Ammon?"</p>

  <p>"A rougher route, but shorter, lies by Gerasa and Rabbath-Gilead. It is
  the one I design taking."</p>

  <p>"I am impatient," said Balthasar. "Latterly my sleep has been visited by
  dreams&mdash;or rather by the same dream in repetition. A voice&mdash;it is
  nothing more&mdash;comes and tells me, 'Haste&mdash;arise! He whom thou hast
  so long awaited is at hand.'"</p>

  <p>"You mean he that is to be King of the Jews?" Ben-Hur asked, gazing at the
  Egyptian in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Even so."</p>

  <p>"Then you have heard nothing of him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except the words of the voice in the dream."</p>

  <p>"Here, then, are tidings to make you glad as they made me."</p>

  <p>From his gown Ben-Hur drew the letter received from Malluch. The hand the
  Egyptian held out trembled violently. He read aloud, and as he read his
  feelings increased; the limp veins in his neck swelled and throbbed. At the
  conclusion he raised his suffused eyes in thanksgiving and prayer. He asked
  no questions, yet had no doubts.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast been very good to me, O God," he said. "Give me, I pray thee,
  to see the Saviour again, and worship him, and thy servant will be ready to
  go in peace."</p>

  <p>The words, the manner, the singular personality of the simple prayer,
  touched Ben-Hur with a sensation new and abiding. God never seemed so actual
  and so near by; it was as if he were there bending over them or sitting at
  their side&mdash;a Friend whose favors were to be had by the most
  unceremonious asking&mdash;a Father to whom all his children were alike in
  love&mdash;Father, not more of the Jew than of the Gentile&mdash;the
  Universal Father, who needed no intermediates, no rabbis, no priests, no
  teachers. The idea that such a God might send mankind a Saviour instead of a
  king appeared to Ben-Hur in a light not merely new, but so plain that he
  could almost discern both the greater want of such a gift and its greater
  consistency with the nature of such a Deity. So he could not resist
  asking,</p>

  <p>"Now that he has come, O Balthasar, you still think he is to be a Saviour,
  and not a king?"</p>

  <p>Balthasar gave him a look thoughtful as it was tender.</p>

  <p>"How shall I understand you?" he asked, in return. "The Spirit, which was
  the Star that was my guide of old, has not appeared to me since I met you in
  the tent of the good sheik; that is to say, I have not seen or heard it as
  formerly. I believe the voice that spoke to me in my dreams was it; but other
  than that I have no revelation."</p>

  <p>"I will recall the difference between us," said Ben-Hur, with deference.
  "You were of opinion that he would be a king, but not as Caesar is; you
  thought his sovereignty would be spiritual, not of the world."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," the Egyptian answered; "and I am of the same opinion now. I see
  the divergence in our faith. You are going to meet a king of men, I a Saviour
  of souls."</p>

  <p>He paused with the look often seen when people are struggling, with
  introverted effort, to disentangle a thought which is either too high for
  quick discernment or too subtle for simple expression.</p>

  <p>"Let me try, O son of Hur," he said, directly, "and help you to a clear
  understanding of my belief; then it may be, seeing how the spiritual kingdom
  I expect him to set up can be more excellent in every sense than anything of
  mere Caesarean splendor, you will better understand the reason of the
  interest I take in the mysterious person we are going to welcome.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you when the idea of a Soul in every man had its origin.
  Most likely the first parents brought it with them out of the garden in which
  they had their first dwelling. We all do know, however, that it has never
  perished entirely out of mind. By some peoples it was lost, but not by all;
  in some ages it dulled and faded, in others it was overwhelmed with doubts;
  but, in great goodness, God kept sending us at intervals mighty intellects to
  argue it back to faith and hope.</p>

  <p>"Why should there be a Soul in every man? Look, O son of Hur&mdash;for one
  moment look at the necessity of such a device. To lie down and die, and be no
  more&mdash;no more forever&mdash;time never was when man wished for such an
  end; nor has the man ever been who did not in his heart promise himself
  something better. The monuments of the nations are all protests against
  nothingness after death; so are statues and inscriptions; so is history. The
  greatest of our Egyptian kings had his effigy cut-out of a hill of solid
  rock. Day after day he went with a host in chariots to see the work; at last
  it was finished, never effigy so grand, so enduring: it looked like
  him&mdash;the features were his, faithful even in expression. Now may we not
  think of him saying in that moment of pride, 'Let Death come; there is an
  after-life for me!' He had his wish. The statue is there yet.</p>

  <p>"But what is the after-life he thus secured? Only a recollection by
  men&mdash;a glory unsubstantial as moonshine on the brow of the great bust; a
  story in stone&mdash;nothing more. Meantime what has become of the king?
  There is an embalmed body up in the royal tombs which once was his&mdash;an
  effigy not so fair to look at as the other out in the Desert. But where, O
  son of Hur, where is the king himself? Is he fallen into nothingness? Two
  thousand years have gone since he was a man alive as you and I are. Was his
  last breath the end of him?</p>

  <p>"To say yes would be to accuse God; let us rather accept his better plan
  of attaining life after death for us&mdash;actual life, I mean&mdash;the
  something more than a place in mortal memory; life with going and coming,
  with sensation, with knowledge, with power and all appreciation; life eternal
  in term though it may be with changes of condition.</p>

  <p>"Ask you what God's plan is? The gift of a Soul to each of us at birth,
  with this simple law&mdash;there shall be no immortality except through the
  Soul. In that law see the necessity of which I spoke.</p>

  <p>"Let us turn from the necessity now. A word as to the pleasure there is in
  the thought of a Soul in each of us. In the first place, it robs death of its
  terrors by making dying a change for the better, and burial but the planting
  of a seed from which there will spring a new life. In the next place, behold
  me as I am&mdash;weak, weary, old, shrunken in body, and graceless; look at
  my wrinkled face, think of my failing senses, listen to my shrilled voice.
  Ah! what happiness to me in the promise that when the tomb opens, as soon it
  will, to receive the worn-out husk I call myself, the now viewless doors of
  the universe, which is but the palace of God, will swing wide ajar to receive
  me, a liberated immortal Soul!</p>

  <p>"I would I could tell the ecstasy there must be in that life to come! Do
  not say I know nothing about it. This much I know, and it is enough for
  me&mdash;the being a Soul implies conditions of divine superiority. In such a
  being there is no dust, nor any gross thing; it must be finer than air, more
  impalpable than light, purer than essence&mdash;it is life in absolute
  purity.</p>

  <p>"What now, O son of Hur? Knowing so much, shall I dispute with myself or
  you about the unnecessaries&mdash;about the form of my soul? Or where it is
  to abide? Or whether it eats and drinks? Or is winged, or wears this or that?
  No. It is more becoming to trust in God. The beautiful in this world is all
  from his hand declaring the perfection of taste; he is the author of all
  form; he clothes the lily, he colors the rose, he distils the dew-drop, he
  makes the music of nature; in a word, he organized us for this life, and
  imposed its conditions; and they are such guaranty to me that, trustful as a
  little child, I leave to him the organization of my Soul, and every
  arrangement for the life after death. I know he loves me."</p>

  <p>The good man stopped and drank, and the hand carrying the cup to his lips
  trembled; and both Iras and Ben-Hur shared his emotion and remained silent.
  Upon the latter a light was breaking. He was beginning to see, as never
  before, that there might be a spiritual kingdom of more import to men than
  any earthly empire; and that after all a Saviour would indeed be a more godly
  gift than the greatest king.</p>

  <p>"I might ask you now," said Balthasar, continuing, "whether this human
  life, so troubled and brief, is preferable to the perfect and everlasting
  life designed for the Soul? But take the question, and think of it for
  yourself, formulating thus: Supposing both to be equally happy, is one hour
  more desirable than one year? From that then advance to the final inquiry,
  what are threescore and ten years on earth to all eternity with God?
  By-and-by, son of Hur, thinking in such manner, you will be filled with the
  meaning of the fact I present you next, to me the most amazing of all events,
  and in its effects the most sorrowful; it is that the very idea of life as a
  Soul is a light almost gone out in the world. Here and there, to be sure, a
  philosopher may be found who will talk to you of a Soul, likening it to a
  principle; but because philosophers take nothing upon faith, they will not go
  the length of admitting a Soul to be a being, and on that account its purpose
  is compressed darkness to them.</p>

  <p>"Everything animate has a mind measurable by its wants. Is there to you no
  meaning in the singularity that power in full degree to speculate upon the
  future was given to man alone? By the sign as I see it, God meant to make us
  know ourselves created for another and a better life, such being in fact the
  greatest need of our nature. But, alas! into what a habit the nations have
  fallen! They live for the day, as if the present were the all in all, and go
  about saying, 'There is no to-morrow after death; or if there be, since we
  know nothing about it, be it a care unto itself.' So when Death calls them,
  'Come,' they may not enter into enjoyment of the glorious after-life because
  of their unfitness. That is to say, the ultimate happiness of man was
  everlasting life in the society of God. Alas, O son of Hur, that I should say
  it! but as well yon sleeping camel constant in such society as the holiest
  priests this day serving the highest altars in the most renowned temples. So
  much are men given to this lower earthly life! So nearly have they forgotten
  that other which is to come!</p>

  <p>"See now, I pray you, that which is to be saved to us.</p>

  <p>"For my part, speaking with the holiness of truth, I would not give one
  hour of life as a Soul for a thousand years of life as a man."</p>

  <p>Here the Egyptian seemed to become unconscious of companionship and fall
  away into abstraction.</p>

  <p>"This life has its problems," he said, "and there are men who spend their
  days trying to solve them; but what are they to the problems of the
  hereafter? What is there like knowing God? Not a scroll of the mysteries, but
  the mysteries themselves would for that hour at least lie before me revealed;
  even the innermost and most awful&mdash;the power which now we shrink from
  thought of&mdash;which rimmed the void with shores, and lighted the darkness,
  and out of nothing appointed the universe. All places would be opened. I
  would be filled with divine knowledge; I would see all glories, taste all
  delights; I would revel in being. And if, at the end of the hour, it should
  please God to tell me, 'I take thee into my service forever,' the furthest
  limit of desire would be passed; after which the attainable ambitions of
  life, and its joys of whatever kind, would not be so much as the tinkling of
  little bells."</p>

  <p>Balthasar paused as if to recover from very ecstasy of feeling; and to
  Ben-Hur it seemed the speech had been the delivery of a Soul speaking for
  itself.</p>

  <p>"I pray pardon, son of Hur," the good man continued, with a bow the
  gravity of which was relieved by the tender look that followed it, "I meant
  to leave the life of a Soul, its conditions, pleasures, superiority, to your
  own reflection and finding out. The joy of the thought has betrayed me into
  much speech. I set out to show, though ever so faintly, the reason of my
  faith. It grieves me that words are so weak. But help yourself to truth.
  Consider first the excellence of the existence which was reserved for us
  after death, and give heed to the feelings and impulses the thought is sure
  to awaken in you&mdash;heed them, I say, because they are your own Soul
  astir, doing what it can to urge you in the right way. Consider next that the
  afterlife has become so obscured as to justify calling it a lost light. If
  you find it, rejoice, O son of Hur&mdash;rejoice as I do, though in beggary
  of words. For then, besides the great gift which is to be saved to us, you
  will have found the need of a Saviour so infinitely greater than the need of
  a king; and he we are going to meet will not longer hold place in your hope a
  warrior with a sword or a monarch with a crown.</p>

  <p>"A practical question presents itself&mdash;How shall we know him at
  sight? If you continue in your belief as to his character&mdash;that he is to
  be a king as Herod was&mdash;of course you will keep on until you meet a man
  clothed in purple and with a sceptre. On the other hand, he I look for will
  be one poor, humble, undistinguished&mdash;a man in appearance as other men;
  and the sign by which I will know him will be never so simple. He will offer
  to show me and all mankind the way to the eternal life; the beautiful pure
  Life of the Soul."</p>

  <p>The company sat a moment in silence which was broken by Balthasar.</p>

  <p>"Let us arise now," he said&mdash;"let us arise and set forward again.
  What I have said has caused a return of impatience to see him who is ever in
  my thought; and if I seem to hurry you, O son of Hur&mdash;and you, my
  daughter&mdash;be that my excuse."</p>

  <p>At his signal the slave brought them wine in a skin bottle; and they
  poured and drank, and shaking the lap-cloths out arose.</p>

  <p>While the slave restored the tent and wares to the box under the houdah,
  and the Arab brought up the horses, the three principals laved themselves in
  the pool.</p>

  <p>In a little while they were retracing their steps back through the wady,
  intending to overtake the caravan if it had passed them by.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch704"
     name="ch704"></a>IV. &mdash; BEN-HUR KEEPS WATCH WITH IRAS</h2>

  <p class="first">The caravan, stretched out upon the Desert, was very
  picturesque; in motion, however, it was like a lazy serpent. By-and-by its
  stubborn dragging became intolerably irksome to Balthasar, patient as he was;
  so, at his suggestion, the party determined to go on by themselves.</p>

  <p>If the reader be young, or if he has yet a sympathetic recollection of the
  romanticisms of his youth, he will relish the pleasure with which Ben-Hur,
  riding near the camel of the Egyptians, gave a last look at the head of the
  straggling column almost out of sight on the shimmering plain.</p>

  <p>To be definite as may be, and perfectly confidential, Ben-Hur found a
  certain charm in Iras's presence. If she looked down upon him from her high
  place, he made haste to get near her; if she spoke to him, his heart beat out
  of its usual time. The desire to be agreeable to her was a constant impulse.
  Objects on the way, though ever so common, became interesting the moment she
  called attention to them; a black swallow in the air pursued by her pointing
  finger went off in a halo; if a bit of quartz or a flake of mica was seen to
  sparkle in the drab sand under kissing of the sun, at a word he turned aside
  and brought it to her; and if she threw it away in disappointment, far from
  thinking of the trouble he had been put to, he was sorry it proved so
  worthless, and kept a lookout for something better&mdash;a ruby, perchance a
  diamond. So the purple of the far mountains became intensely deep and rich if
  she distinguished it with an exclamation of praise; and when, now and then,
  the curtain of the houdah fell down, it seemed a sudden dulness had dropped
  from the sky bedraggling all the landscape. Thus disposed, yielding to the
  sweet influence, what shall save him from the dangers there are in days of
  the close companionship with the fair Egyptian incident to the solitary
  journey they were entered upon?</p>

  <p>For that there is no logic in love, nor the least mathematical element, it
  is simply natural that she shall fashion the result who has the wielding of
  the influence.</p>

  <p>To quicken the conclusion, there were signs, too, that she well knew the
  influence she was exercising over him. From some place under hand she had
  since morning drawn a caul of golden coins, and adjusted it so the gleaming
  strings fell over her forehead and upon her cheeks, blending lustrously with
  the flowing of her blue-black hair. From the same safe deposit she had also
  produced articles of jewelry&mdash;rings for finger and ear, bracelets, a
  necklace of pearls&mdash;also, a shawl embroidered with threads of fine
  gold&mdash;the effect of all which she softened with a scarf of Indian lace
  skillfully folded about her throat and shoulders. And so arrayed, she plied
  Ben-Hur with countless coquetries of speech and manner; showering him with
  smiles; laughing in flute-like tremolo&mdash;and all the while following him
  with glances, now melting-tender, now sparkling-bright. By such play Antony
  was weaned from his glory; yet she who wrought his ruin was really not half
  so beautiful as this her countrywoman.</p>

  <p>And so to them the nooning came, and the evening.</p>

  <p>The sun at its going down behind a spur of the old Bashan, left the party
  halted by a pool of clear water of the rains out in the Abilene Desert. There
  the tent was pitched, the supper eaten, and preparations made for the
  night.</p>

  <p>The second watch was Ben-Hur's; and he was standing, spear in hand, within
  arm-reach of the dozing camel, looking awhile at the stars, then over the
  veiled land. The stillness was intense; only after long spells a warm breath
  of wind would sough past, but without disturbing him, for yet in thought he
  entertained the Egyptian, recounting her charms, and sometimes debating how
  she came by his secrets, the uses she might make of them, and the course he
  should pursue with her. And through all the debate Love stood off but a
  little way&mdash;a strong temptation, the stronger of a gleam of policy
  behind. At the very moment he was most inclined to yield to the allurement, a
  hand very fair even in the moonless gloaming was laid softly upon his
  shoulder. The touch thrilled him; he started, turned&mdash;and she was
  there.</p>

  <p>"I thought you asleep," he said, presently.</p>

  <p>"Sleep is for old people and little children, and I came out to look at my
  friends, the stars in the south&mdash;those now holding the curtains of
  midnight over the Nile. But confess yourself surprised!"</p>

  <p>He took the hand which had fallen from his shoulder, and said, "Well, was
  it by an enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no! To be an enemy is to hate, and hating is a sickness which Isis
  will not suffer to come near me. She kissed me, you should know, on the heart
  when I was a child."</p>

  <p>"Your speech does not sound in the least like your father's. Are you not
  of his faith?"</p>

  <p>"I might have been"&mdash;and she laughed low&mdash;"I might have been had
  I seen what he has. I may be when I get old like him. There should be no
  religion for youth, only poetry and philosophy; and no poetry except such as
  is the inspiration of wine and mirth and love, and no philosophy that does
  not nod excuse for follies which cannot outlive a season. My father's God is
  too awful for me. I failed to find him in the Grove of Daphne. He was never
  heard of as present in the atria of Rome. But, son of Hur, I have a
  wish."</p>

  <p>"A wish! Where is he who could say it no?"</p>

  <p>"I will try you."</p>

  <p>"Tell it then."</p>

  <p>"It is very simple. I wish to help you."</p>

  <p>She drew closer as she spoke.</p>

  <p>He laughed, and replied, lightly, "O Egypt!&mdash;I came near saying dear
  Egypt!&mdash;does not the sphinx abide in your country?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You are one of its riddles. Be merciful, and give me a little clew to
  help me understand you. In what do I need help? And how can you help me?"</p>

  <p>She took her hand from him, and, turning to the camel, spoke to it
  endearingly, and patted its monstrous head as it were a thing of beauty.</p>

  <p>"O thou last and swiftest and stateliest of the herds of Job! Sometimes
  thou, too, goest stumbling, because the way is rough and stony and the burden
  grievous. How is it thou knowest the kind intent by a word; and always makest
  answer gratefully, though the help offered is from a woman? I will kiss thee,
  thou royal brute!"&mdash;she stooped and touched its broad forehead with her
  lips, saying immediately, "because in thy intelligence there is no
  suspicion!"</p>

  <p>And Ben-Hur, restraining himself, said calmly, "The reproach has not
  failed its mark, O Egypt! I seem to say thee no; may it not be because I am
  under seal of honor, and by my silence cover the lives and fortunes of
  others?"</p>

  <p>"May be!" she said, quickly. "It is so."</p>

  <p>He shrank a step, and asked, his voice sharp with amazement, "What all
  knowest thou?"</p>

  <p>She answered, after a laugh,</p>

  <p>"Why do men deny that the senses of women are sharper than theirs? Your
  face has been under my eyes all day. I had but to look at it to see you bore
  some weight in mind; and to find the weight, what had I to do more than
  recall your debates with my father? Son of Hur!"&mdash;she lowered her voice
  with singular dexterity, and, going nearer, spoke so her breath was warm upon
  his cheek&mdash;"son of Hur! he thou art going to find is to be King of the
  Jews, is he not?"</p>

  <p>His heart beat fast and hard.</p>

  <p>"A King of the Jews like Herod, only greater," she continued.</p>

  <p>He looked away&mdash;into the night, up to the stars; then his eyes met
  hers, and lingered there; and her breath was on his lips, so near was
  she.</p>

  <p>"Since morning," she said, further, "we have been having visions. Now if I
  tell you mine, will you serve me as well? What! silent still?"</p>

  <p>She pushed his hand away, and turned as if to go; but he caught her, and
  said, eagerly, "Stay&mdash;stay and speak!"</p>

  <p>She went back, and with her hand upon his shoulder, leaned against him;
  and he put his arm around her, and drew her close, very close; and in the
  caress was the promise she asked.</p>

  <p>"Speak, and tell me thy visions, O Egypt, dear Egypt! A prophet&mdash;nay,
  not the Tishbite, not even the Lawgiver&mdash;could have refused an asking of
  thine. I am at thy will. Be merciful&mdash;merciful, I pray."</p>

  <p>The entreaty passed apparently unheard, for looking up and nestling in his
  embrace, she said, slowly, "The vision which followed me was of magnificent
  war&mdash;war on land and sea&mdash;with clashing of arms and rush of armies,
  as if Caesar and Pompey were come again, and Octavius and Antony. A cloud of
  dust and ashes arose and covered the world, and Rome was not any more; all
  dominion returned to the East; out of the cloud issued another race of
  heroes; and there were vaster satrapies and brighter crowns for giving away
  than were ever known. And, son of Hur, while the vision was passing, and
  after it was gone, I kept asking myself, 'What shall he not have who served
  the King earliest and best?'"</p>

  <p>Again Ben-Hur recoiled. The question was the very question which had been
  with him all day. Presently he fancied he had the clew he wanted.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, "I have you now. The satrapies and crowns are the things to
  which you would help me. I see, I see! And there never was such queen as you
  would be, so shrewd, so beautiful, so royal&mdash;never! But, alas, dear
  Egypt! by the vision as you show it me the prizes are all of war, and you are
  but a woman, though Isis did kiss you on the heart. And crowns are starry
  gifts beyond your power of help, unless, indeed, you have a way to them more
  certain than that of the sword. If so, O Egypt, Egypt, show it me, and I will
  walk in it, if only for your sake."</p>

  <p>She removed his arm, and said, "Spread your cloak upon the
  sand&mdash;here, so I can rest against the camel. I will sit, and tell you a
  story which came down the Nile to Alexandria, where I had it."</p>

  <p>He did as she said, first planting the spear in the ground near by.</p>

  <p>"And what shall I do?" he said, ruefully, when she was seated. "In
  Alexandria is it customary for the listeners to sit or stand?"</p>

  <p>From the comfortable place against the old domestic she answered,
  laughing, "The audiences of story-tellers are wilful, and sometimes they do
  as they please."</p>

  <p>Without more ado he stretched himself upon the sand, and put her arm about
  his neck.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," he said.</p>

  <p>And directly she began:</p><br>

  <h3>HOW THE BEAUTIFUL CAME TO THE EARTH.</h3>

  <p class="quote">"You must know, in the first place, that Isis was&mdash;and,
  for that matter, she may yet be&mdash;the most beautiful of deities; and
  Osiris, her husband, though wise and powerful, was sometimes stung with
  jealousy of her, for only in their loves are the gods like mortals.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The palace of the Divine Wife was of silver, crowning the
  tallest mountain in the moon, and thence she passed often to the sun, in the
  heart of which, a source of eternal light, Osiris kept his palace of gold too
  shining for men to look at.</p>

  <p class="quote">"One time&mdash;there are no days with the gods&mdash;while
  she was full pleasantly with him on the roof of the golden palace, she
  chanced to look, and afar, just on the line of the universe, saw Indra
  passing with an army of simians, all borne upon the backs of flying eagles.
  He, the Friend of Living Things&mdash;so with much love is Indra
  called&mdash;was returning from his final war with the hideous
  Rakshakas&mdash;returning victorious; and in his suite were Rama, the hero,
  and Sita, his bride, who, next to Isis herself, was the very most beautiful.
  And Isis arose, and took off her girdle of stars, and waved it to
  Sita&mdash;to Sita, mind you&mdash;waved it in glad salute. And instantly,
  between the marching host and the two on the golden roof, a something as of
  night fell, and shut out the view; but it was not night&mdash;only the frown
  of Osiris.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It happened the subject of his speech that moment was such
  as none else than they could think of; and he arose, and said, majestically,
  'Get thee home. I will do the work myself. To make a perfectly happy being I
  do not need thy help. Get thee gone.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Now Isis had eyes large as those of the white cow which in
  the temple eats sweet grasses from the hands of the faithful even while they
  say their prayers; and her eyes were the color of the cows, and quite as
  tender. And she too arose and said, smiling as she spoke, so her look was
  little more than the glow of the moon in the hazy harvest-month, 'Farewell,
  good my lord. You will call me presently, I know; for without me you cannot
  make the perfectly happy creature of which you were thinking, any
  more'&mdash;and she stopped to laugh, knowing well the truth of the
  saying&mdash;'any more, my lord, than you yourself can be perfectly happy
  without me.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'We will see,' he said.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And she went her way, and took her needles and her chair,
  and on the roof of the silver palace sat watching and knitting.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And the will of Osiris, at labor in his mighty breast, was
  as the sound of the mills of all the other gods grinding at once, so loud
  that the near stars rattled like seeds in a parched pod; and some dropped out
  and were lost. And while the sound kept on she waited and knit; nor lost she
  ever a stitch the while.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Soon a spot appeared in the space over towards the sun; and
  it grew until it was great as the moon, and then she knew a world was
  intended; but when, growing and growing, at last it cast her planet in the
  shade, all save the little point lighted by her presence, she knew how very
  angry he was; yet she knit away, assured that the end would be as she had
  said.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And so came the earth, at first but a cold gray mass
  hanging listless in the hollow void. Later she saw it separate into
  divisions; here a plain, there a mountain, yonder a sea, all as yet without a
  sparkle. And then, by a river-bank, something moved; and she stopped her
  knitting for wonder. The something arose, and lifted its hands to the sun in
  sign of knowledge whence it had its being. And this First Man was beautiful
  to see. And about him were the creations we call nature&mdash;the grass, the
  trees, birds, beasts, even the insects and reptiles.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And for a time the man went about happy in his life: it was
  easy to see how happy he was. And in the lull of the sound of the laboring
  will Isis heard a scornful laugh, and presently the words, blown across from
  the sun,</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Thy help, indeed! Behold a creature perfectly happy!'</p>

  <p class="quote">"And Isis fell to knitting again, for she was patient as
  Osiris was strong; and if he could work, she could wait; and wait she did,
  knowing that mere life is not enough to keep anything content.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And sure enough. Not long until the Divine Wife could see a
  change in the man. He grew listless, and kept to one place prone by the
  river, and looked up but seldom, and then always with a moody face. Interest
  was dying in him. And when she made sure of it, even while she was saying to
  herself, 'The creature is sick of his being,' there was a roar of the
  creative will at work again, and in a twinkling the earth, theretofore all a
  thing of coldest gray, flamed with colors; the mountains swam in purple, the
  plains bearing grass and trees turned green, the sea blue, and the clouds
  varied infinitely."</p>

  <p class="quote">"And the man sprang up and clapped his hands, for he was
  cured and happy again.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And Isis smiled, and knit away, saying to herself, 'It was
  well thought, and will do a little while; but mere beauty in a world is not
  enough for such a being. My lord must try again.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"With the last word, the thunder of the will at work shook
  the moon, and, looking, Isis dropped her knitting and clapped her hands; for
  theretofore everything on the earth but the man had been fixed to a given
  place; now all living, and much that was not living, received the gift of
  Motion. The birds took to wing joyously; beasts great and small went about,
  each in its way; the trees shook their verdurous branches, nodding to the
  enamoured winds; the rivers ran to the seas, and the seas tossed in their
  beds and rolled in crested waves, and with surging and ebbing painted the
  shores with glistening foam; and over all the clouds floated like sailed
  ships unanchored.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And the man rose up happy as a child; whereat Osiris was
  pleased, so that he shouted, 'Ha, ha! See how well I am doing without
  thee!'</p>

  <p class="quote">"The good wife took up her work, and answered ever so
  quietly, 'It was well thought, my lord&mdash;ever so well thought&mdash;and
  will serve awhile.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"And as before, so again. The sight of things in motion
  became to the man as of course. The birds in flight, the rivers running, the
  seas in tumult of action, ceased to amuse him, and he pined again even
  worse.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And Isis waited, saying to herself, 'Poor creature! He is
  more wretched than ever.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"And, as if he heard the thought, Osiris stirred, and the
  noise of his will shook the universe; the sun in its central seat alone stood
  firm. And Isis looked, but saw no change; then while she was smiling, assured
  that her lord's last invention was sped, suddenly the creature arose, and
  seemed to listen; and his face brightened, and he clapped his hands for joy,
  for Sounds were heard the first time on earth&mdash;sounds dissonant, sounds
  harmonious. The winds murmured in the trees; the birds sang, each kind a song
  of its own, or chattered in speech; the rivulets running to the rivers became
  so many harpers with harps of silver strings all tinkling together; and the
  rivers running to the seas surged on in solemn accord, while the seas beat
  the land to a tune of thunder. There was music, music everywhere, and all the
  time; so the man could not but be happy.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then Isis mused, thinking how well, how wondrous well, her
  lord was doing; but presently she shook her head: Color, Motion,
  Sound&mdash;and she repeated them slowly&mdash;there was no element else of
  beauty except Form and Light, and to them the earth had been born. Now,
  indeed, Osiris was done; and if the creature should again fall off into
  wretchedness, her help must be asked; and her fingers flew&mdash;two, three,
  five, even ten stitches she took at once.</p>

  <p class="quote">"And the man was happy a long time&mdash;longer than ever
  before; it seemed, indeed, he would never tire again. But Isis knew better;
  and she waited and waited, nor minded the many laughs flung at her from the
  sun; she waited and waited, and at last saw signs of the end. Sounds became
  familiar to him, and in their range, from the chirruping of the cricket under
  the roses to the roar of the seas and the bellow of the clouds in storm,
  there was not anything unusual. And he pined and sickened, and sought his
  place of moping by the river, and at last fell down motionless.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then Isis in pity spoke.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'My lord,' she said, 'the creature is dying.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"But Osiris, though seeing it all, held his peace; he could
  do no more.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Shall I help him?' she asked.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Osiris was too proud to speak.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Then Isis took the last stitch in her knitting, and
  gathering her work in a roll of brilliance flung it off&mdash;flung it so it
  fell close to the man. And he, hearing the sound of the fall so near by,
  looked up, and lo! a Woman&mdash;the First Woman&mdash;was stooping to help
  him! She reached a hand to him; he caught it and arose; and nevermore was
  miserable, but evermore happy."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Such, O son of Hur! is the genesis of the beautiful, as
  they tell it on the Nile."</p><br>

  <p>She paused.</p>

  <p>"A pretty invention, and cunning," he said, directly; "but it is
  imperfect. What did Osiris afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," she replied. "He called the Divine Wife back to the sun, and
  they went on all pleasantly together, each helping the other."</p>

  <p>"And shall I not do as the first man?"</p>

  <p>He carried the hand resting upon his neck to his lips. "In love&mdash;in
  love!" he said.</p>

  <p>His head dropped softly into her lap.</p>

  <p>"You will find the King," she said, placing her other hand caressingly
  upon his head. "You will go on and find the King and serve him. With your
  sword you will earn his richest gifts; and his best soldier will be my
  hero."</p>

  <p>He turned his face, and saw hers close above. In all the sky there was
  that moment nothing so bright to him as her eyes, enshadowed though they
  were. Presently he sat up, and put his arms about her, and kissed her
  passionately, saying, "O Egypt, Egypt! If the King has crowns in gift, one
  shall be mine; and I will bring it and put it here over the place my lips
  have marked. You shall be a queen&mdash;my queen&mdash;no one more beautiful!
  And we will be ever, ever so happy!"</p>

  <p>"And you will tell me everything, and let me help you in all?" she said,
  kissing him in return.</p>

  <p>The question chilled his fervor.</p>

  <p>"Is it not enough that I love you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Perfect love means perfect faith," she replied. "But never mind&mdash;you
  will know me better."</p>

  <p>She took her hand from him and arose.</p>

  <p>"You are cruel," he said.</p>

  <p>Moving away, she stopped by the camel, and touched its front face with her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"O thou noblest of thy kind!&mdash;that, because there is no suspicion in
  thy love."</p>

  <p>An instant, and she was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch705"
     name="ch705"></a>V. &mdash; AT BETHABARA</h2>

  <p class="first">The third day of the journey the party nooned by the river
  Jabbok, where there were a hundred or more men, mostly of Peraea, resting
  themselves and their beasts. Hardly had they dismounted, before a man came to
  them with a pitcher of water and a bowl, and offered them drink; as they
  received the attention with much courtesy, he said, looking at the camel, "I
  am returning from the Jordan, where just now there are many people from
  distant parts, travelling as you are, illustrious friend; but they had none
  of them the equal of your servant here. A very noble animal. May I ask of
  what breed he is sprung?"</p>

  <p>Balthasar answered, and sought his rest; but Ben-Hur, more curious, took
  up the remark.</p>

  <p>"At what place on the river are the people?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"At Bethabara."</p>

  <p>"It used to be a lonesome ford," said Ben-Hur. "I cannot understand how it
  can have become of such interest."</p>

  <p>"I see," the stranger replied; "you, too, are from abroad, and have not
  heard the good tidings."</p>

  <p>"What tidings?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a man has appeared out of the wilderness&mdash;a very holy
  man&mdash;with his mouth full of strange words, which take hold of all who
  hear them. He calls himself John the Nazarite, son of Zacharias, and says he
  is the messenger sent before the Messiah."</p>

  <p>Even Iras listened closely while the man continued:</p>

  <p>"They say of this John that he has spent his life from childhood in a cave
  down by En-Gedi, praying and living more strictly than the Essenes. Crowds go
  to hear him preach. I went to hear him with the rest."</p>

  <p>"Have all these, your friends, been there?"</p>

  <p>"Most of them are going; a few are coming away."</p>

  <p>"What does he preach?"</p>

  <p>"A new doctrine&mdash;one never before taught in Israel, as all say. He
  calls it repentance and baptism. The rabbis do not know what to make of him;
  nor do we. Some have asked him if he is the Christ, others if he is Elias;
  but to them all he has the answer, 'I am the voice of one crying in the
  wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord!'"</p>

  <p>At this point the man was called away by his friends; as he was going,
  Balthasar spoke.</p>

  <p>"Good stranger!" he said, tremulously, "tell us if we shall find the
  preacher at the place you left him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, at Bethabara."</p>

  <p>"Who should this Nazarite be?" said Ben-Hur to Iras, "if not the herald of
  our King?"</p>

  <p>In so short a time he had come to regard the daughter as more interested
  in the mysterious personage he was looking for than the aged father!
  Nevertheless, the latter with a positive glow in his sunken eyes half arose,
  and said,</p>

  <p>"Let us make haste. I am not tired."</p>

  <p>They turned away to help the slave.</p>

  <p>There was little conversation between the three at the stopping-place for
  the night west of Ramoth-Gilead.</p>

  <p>"Let us arise early, son of Hur," said the old man. "The Saviour may come,
  and we not there."</p>

  <p>"The King cannot be far behind his herald," Iras whispered, as she
  prepared to take her place on the camel.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow we will see!" Ben-Hur replied, kissing her hand.</p>

  <p>Next day about the third hour, out of the pass through which, skirting the
  base of Mount Gilead, they had journeyed since leaving Ramoth, the party came
  upon the barren steppe east of the sacred river. Opposite them they saw the
  upper limit of the old palm lands of Jericho, stretching off to the
  hill-country of Judea. Ben-Hur's blood ran quickly, for he knew the ford was
  close at hand.</p>

  <p>"Content you, good Balthasar," he said; "we are almost there."</p>

  <p>The driver quickened the camel's pace. Soon they caught sight of booths
  and tents and tethered animals; and then of the river, and a multitude
  collected down close by the bank, and yet another multitude on the western
  shore. Knowing that the preacher was preaching, they made greater haste; yet,
  as they were drawing near, suddenly there was a commotion in the mass, and it
  began to break up and disperse.</p>

  <p>They were too late!</p>

  <p>"Let us stay here," said Ben-Hur to Balthasar, who was wringing his hands.
  "The Nazarite may come this way."</p>

  <p>The people were too intent upon what they had heard, and too busy in
  discussion, to notice the new-comers. When some hundreds were gone by, and it
  seemed the opportunity to so much as see the Nazarite was lost to the latter,
  up the river not far away they beheld a person coming towards them of such
  singular appearance they forgot all else.</p>

  <p>Outwardly the man was rude and uncouth, even savage. Over a thin, gaunt
  visage of the hue of brown parchment, over his shoulders and down his back
  below the middle, in witch-like locks, fell a covering of sun-scorched hair.
  His eyes were burning-bright. All his right side was naked, and of the color
  of his face, and quite as meagre; a shirt of the coarsest
  camel's-hair&mdash;coarse as Bedouin tent-cloth&mdash;clothed the rest of his
  person to the knees, being gathered at the waist by a broad girdle of
  untanned leather. His feet were bare. A scrip, also of untanned leather, was
  fastened to the girdle. He used a knotted staff to help him forward. His
  movement was quick, decided, and strangely watchful. Every little while he
  tossed the unruly hair from his eyes, and peered round as if searching for
  somebody.</p>

  <p>The fair Egyptian surveyed the son of the Desert with surprise, not to say
  disgust. Presently, raising the curtain of the houdah, she spoke to Ben-Hur,
  who sat his horse near by.</p>

  <p>"Is that the herald of thy King?"</p>

  <p>"It is the Nazarite," he replied, without looking up.</p>

  <p>In truth, he was himself more than disappointed. Despite his familiarity
  with the ascetic colonists in En-Gedi&mdash;their dress, their indifference
  to all worldly opinion, their constancy to vows which gave them over to every
  imaginable suffering of body, and separated them from others of their kind as
  absolutely as if they had not been born like them&mdash;and notwithstanding
  he had been notified on the way to look for a Nazarite whose simple
  description of himself was a Voice from the Wilderness&mdash;still Ben-Hur's
  dream of the King who was to be so great and do so much had colored all his
  thought of him, so that he never doubted to find in the forerunner some sign
  or token of the goodliness and royalty he was announcing. Gazing at the
  savage figure before him, the long trains of courtiers whom he had been used
  to see in the thermae and imperial corridors at Rome arose before him,
  forcing a comparison. Shocked, shamed, bewildered, he could only answer,</p>

  <p>"It is the Nazarite."</p>

  <p>With Balthasar it was very different. The ways of God, he knew, were not
  as men would have them. He had seen the Saviour a child in a manger, and was
  prepared by his faith for the rude and simple in connection with the Divine
  reappearance. So he kept his seat, his hands crossed upon his breast, his
  lips moving in prayer. He was not expecting a king.</p>

  <p>In this time of such interest to the new-comers, and in which they were so
  differently moved, another man had been sitting by himself on a stone at the
  edge of the river, thinking yet, probably, of the sermon he had been hearing.
  Now, however, he arose, and walked slowly up from the shore, in a course to
  take him across the line the Nazarite was pursuing and bring him near the
  camel.</p>

  <p>And the two&mdash;the preacher and the stranger&mdash;kept on until they
  came, the former within twenty yards of the animal, the latter within ten
  feet. Then the preacher stopped, and flung the hair from his eyes, looked at
  the stranger, threw his hands up as a signal to all the people in sight; and
  they also stopped, each in the pose of a listener; and when the hush was
  perfect, slowly the staff in the Nazarite's right hand came down and pointed
  to the stranger.</p>

  <p>All those who before were but listeners became watchers also.</p>

  <p>At the same instant, under the same impulse, Balthasar and Ben-Hur fixed
  their gaze upon the man pointed out, and both took the same impression, only
  in different degree. He was moving slowly towards them in a clear space a
  little to their front, a form slightly above the average in stature, and
  slender, even delicate. His action was calm and deliberate, like that
  habitual to men much given to serious thought upon grave subjects; and it
  well became his costume, which was an undergarment full-sleeved and reaching
  to the ankles, and an outer robe called the talith; on his left arm he
  carried the usual handkerchief for the head, the red fillet swinging loose
  down his side. Except the fillet and a narrow border of blue at the lower
  edge of the talith, his attire was of linen yellowed with dust and road
  stains. Possibly the exception should be extended to the tassels, which were
  blue and white, as prescribed by law for rabbis. His sandals were of the
  simplest kind. He was without scrip or girdle or staff.</p>

  <p>These points of appearance, however, the three beholders observed briefly,
  and rather as accessories to the head and face of the man,
  which&mdash;especially the latter&mdash;were the real sources of the spell
  they caught in common with all who stood looking at him.</p>

  <p>The head was open to the cloudless light, except as it was draped with
  hair long and slightly waved, and parted in the middle, and auburn in tint,
  with a tendency to reddish golden where most strongly touched by the sun.
  Under a broad, low forehead, under black well arched brows, beamed eyes
  dark-blue and large, and softened to exceeding tenderness by lashes of the
  great length sometimes seen on children, but seldom, if ever, on men. As to
  the other features, it would have been difficult to decide whether they were
  Greek or Jewish. The delicacy of the nostrils and mouth was unusual to the
  latter type; and when it was taken into account with the gentleness of the
  eyes, the pallor of the complexion, the fine texture of the hair, and the
  softness of the beard, which fell in waves over his throat to his breast,
  never a soldier but would have laughed at him in encounter, never a woman who
  would not have confided in him at sight, never a child that would not, with
  quick instinct, have given him its hand and whole artless trust; nor might
  any one have said he was not beautiful.</p>

  <p>The features, it should be further said, were ruled by a certain
  expression which, as the viewer chose, might with equal correctness have been
  called the effect of intelligence, love, pity, or sorrow; though, in better
  speech, it was a blending of them all&mdash;a look easy to fancy as the mark
  of a sinless soul doomed to the sight and understanding of the utter
  sinfulness of those among whom it was passing; yet withal no one could have
  observed the face with a thought of weakness in the man; so, at least, would
  not they who know that the qualities mentioned&mdash;love, sorrow,
  pity&mdash;are the results of a consciousness of strength to bear suffering
  oftener than strength to do; such has been the might of martyrs and devotees
  and the myriads written down in saintly calendars. And such, indeed, was the
  air of this one.</p>

  <p>Slowly he drew near&mdash;nearer the three.</p>

  <p>Now Ben-Hur, mounted and spear in hand, was an object to claim the glance
  of a king; yet the eyes of the man approaching were all the time raised above
  him&mdash;and not to Iras, whose loveliness has been so often remarked, but
  to Balthasar, the old and unserviceable.</p>

  <p>The hush was profound.</p>

  <p>Presently the Nazarite, still pointing with his staff, cried, in a loud
  voice,</p>

  <p>"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!"</p>

  <p>The many standing still, arrested by the action of the speaker, and
  listening for what might follow, were struck with awe by words so strange and
  past their understanding; upon Balthasar they were overpowering. He was there
  to see once more the Redeemer of men. The faith which had brought him the
  singular privileges of the time long gone abode yet in his heart; and if now
  it gave him a power of vision above that of his fellows&mdash;a power to see
  and know him for whom he was looking&mdash;better than calling the power a
  miracle, let it be thought of as the faculty of a soul not yet entirely
  released from the divine relations to which it had been formerly admitted, or
  as the fitting reward of a life in that age so without examples of
  holiness&mdash;a life itself a miracle. The ideal of his faith was before
  him, perfect in face, form, dress, action, age; and he was in its view, and
  the view was recognition. Ah, now if something should happen to identify the
  stranger beyond all doubt!</p>

  <p>And that was what did happen.</p>

  <p>Exactly at the fitting moment, as if to assure the trembling Egyptian, the
  Nazarite repeated the outcry,</p>

  <p>"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!"</p>

  <p>Balthasar fell upon his knees. For him there was no need of explanation;
  and as if the Nazarite knew it, he turned to those more immediately about him
  staring in wonder, and continued:</p>

  <p>"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred
  before me, for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be
  manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. I saw the
  Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew
  him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,
  Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same
  is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw and bare record, that
  this"&mdash;he paused, his staff still pointing at the stranger in the white
  garments, as if to give a more absolute certainty to both his words and the
  conclusions intended&mdash;"I bare record, THAT THIS IS THE SON OF GOD!"</p>

  <p>"It is he, it is he!" Balthasar cried, with upraised tearful eyes. Next
  moment he sank down insensible.</p>

  <p>In this time, it should be remembered, Ben-Hur was studying the face of
  the stranger, though with an interest entirely different. He was not
  insensible to its purity of feature, and its thoughtfulness, tenderness,
  humility, and holiness; but just then there was room in his mind for but one
  thought&mdash;Who is this man? And what? Messiah or king? Never was
  apparition more unroyal. Nay, looking at that calm, benignant countenance,
  the very idea of war and conquest, and lust of dominion, smote him like a
  profanation. He said, as if speaking to his own heart, Balthasar must be
  right and Simonides wrong. This man has not come to rebuild the throne of
  Solomon; he has neither the nature nor the genius of Herod; king he may be,
  but not of another and greater than Rome.</p>

  <p>It should be understood now that this was not a conclusion with Ben-Hur,
  but an impression merely; and while it was forming, while yet he gazed at the
  wonderful countenance, his memory began to throe and struggle. "Surely," he
  said to himself, "I have seen the man; but where and when?" That the look, so
  calm, so pitiful, so loving, had somewhere in a past time beamed upon him as
  that moment it was beaming upon Balthasar became an assurance. Faintly at
  first, at last a clear light, a burst of sunshine, the scene by the well at
  Nazareth what time the Roman guard was dragging him to the galleys returned,
  and all his being thrilled. Those hands had helped him when he was perishing.
  The face was one of the pictures he had carried in mind ever since. In the
  effusion of feeling excited, the explanation of the preacher was lost by him,
  all but the last words&mdash;words so marvellous that the world yet rings
  with them:</p>

  <p>"&mdash;this is the SON OF GOD!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur leaped from his horse to render homage to his benefactor; but Iras
  cried to him, "Help, son of Hur, help, or my father will die!"</p>

  <p>He stopped, looked back, then hurried to her assistance. She gave him a
  cup; and leaving the slave to bring the camel to its knees, he ran to the
  river for water. The stranger was gone when he came back.</p>

  <p>At last Balthasar was restored to consciousness. Stretching forth his
  hands, he asked, feebly, "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked Iras.</p>

  <p>An intense instant interest shone upon the good man's face, as if a last
  wish had been gratified, and he answered,</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;the Redeemer&mdash;the Son of God, whom I have seen again."</p>

  <p>"Believest thou so?" Iras asked in a low voice of Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"The time is full of wonders; let us wait," was all he said.</p>

  <p>And next day while the three were listening to him, the Nazarite broke off
  in mid-speech, saying reverently, "Behold the Lamb of God!"</p>

  <p>Looking to where he pointed, they beheld the stranger again. As Ben-Hur
  surveyed the slender figure, and holy beautiful countenance compassionate to
  sadness, a new idea broke upon him.</p>

  <p>"Balthasar is right&mdash;so is Simonides. May not the Redeemer be a king
  also?"</p>

  <p>And he asked one at his side, "Who is the man walking yonder?"</p>

  <p>The other laughed mockingly, and replied,</p>

  <p>"He is the son of a carpenter over in Nazareth."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch801"
     name="ch801"></a>I. &mdash; GUESTS IN THE HOUSE OF HUR</h2>

  <p class="first">"Esther&mdash;Esther! Speak to the servant below that he may
  bring me a cup of water."</p>

  <p>"Would you not rather have wine, father?"</p>

  <p>"Let him bring both."</p>

  <p>This was in the summer-house upon the roof of the old palace of the Hurs
  in Jerusalem. From the parapet overlooking the court-yard Esther called to a
  man in waiting there; at the same moment another man-servant came up the
  steps and saluted respectfully.</p>

  <p>"A package for the master," he said, giving her a letter enclosed in linen
  cloth, tied and sealed.</p>

  <p>For the satisfaction of the reader, we stop to say that it is the
  twenty-first day of March, nearly three years after the annunciation of the
  Christ at Bethabara.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, Malluch, acting for Ben-Hur, who could not longer endure
  the emptiness and decay of his father's house, had bought it from Pontius
  Pilate; and, in process of repair, gates, courts, lewens, stairways,
  terraces, rooms, and roof had been cleansed and thoroughly restored; not only
  was there no reminder left of the tragic circumstances so ruinous to the
  family, but the refurnishment was in a style richer than before. At every
  point, indeed, a visitor was met by evidences of the higher tastes acquired
  by the young proprietor during his years of residence in the villa by Misenum
  and in the Roman capital.</p>

  <p>Now it should not be inferred from this explanation that Ben-Hur had
  publicly assumed ownership of the property. In his opinion, the hour for that
  was not yet come. Neither had he yet taken his proper name. Passing the time
  in the labors of preparation in Galilee, he waited patiently the action of
  the Nazarene, who became daily more and more a mystery to him, and by
  prodigies done, often before his eyes, kept him in a state of anxious doubt
  both as to his character and mission. Occasionally he came up to the Holy
  City, stopping at the paternal house; always, however, as a stranger and a
  guest.</p>

  <p>These visits of Ben-Hur, it should also be observed, were for more than
  mere rest from labor. Balthasar and Iras made their home in the palace; and
  the charm of the daughter was still upon him with all its original freshness,
  while the father, though feebler in body, held him an unflagging listener to
  speeches of astonishing power, urging the divinity of the wandering
  miracle-worker of whom they were all so expectant.</p>

  <p>As to Simonides and Esther, they had arrived from Antioch only a few days
  before this their reappearance&mdash;a wearisome journey to the merchant,
  borne, as he had been, in a palanquin swung between two camels, which, in
  their careening, did not always keep the same step. But now that he was come,
  the good man, it seemed, could not see enough of his native land. He
  delighted in the perch upon the roof, and spent most of his day hours there
  seated in an arm-chair, the duplicate of that one kept for him in the cabinet
  over the store-house by the Orontes. In the shade of the summer-house he
  could drink fully of the inspiring air lying lightly upon the familiar hills;
  he could better watch the sun rise, run its course, and set as it used to in
  the far-gone, not a habit lost; and with Esther by him it was so much easier
  up there close to the sky, to bring back the other Esther, his love in youth,
  his wife, dearer growing with the passage of years. And yet he was not
  unmindful of business. Every day a messenger brought him a despatch from
  Sanballat, in charge of the big commerce behind; and every day a despatch
  left him for Sanballat with directions of such minuteness of detail as to
  exclude all judgment save his own, and all chances except those the Almighty
  has refused to submit to the most mindful of men.</p>

  <p>As Esther started in return to the summer-house, the sunlight fell softly
  upon the dustless roof, showing her a woman now&mdash;small, graceful in
  form, of regular features, rosy with youth and health, bright with
  intelligence, beautiful with the outshining of a devoted nature&mdash;a woman
  to be loved because loving was a habit of life irrepressible with her.</p>

  <p>She looked at the package as she turned, paused, looked at it a second
  time more closely than at first; and the blood rose reddening her
  cheeks&mdash;the seal was Ben-Hur's. With quickened steps she hastened
  on.</p>

  <p>Simonides held the package a moment while he also inspected the seal.
  Breaking it open, he gave her the roll it contained.</p>

  <p>"Read," he said.</p>

  <p>His eyes were upon her as he spoke, and instantly a troubled expression
  fell upon his own face.</p>

  <p>"You know who it is from, I see, Esther."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;from&mdash;our master."</p>

  <p>Though the manner was halting, she met his gaze with modest sincerity.
  Slowly his chin sank into the roll of flesh puffed out under it like a
  cushion.</p>

  <p>"You love him, Esther," he said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought well of what you do?"</p>

  <p>"I have tried not to think of him, father, except as the master to whom I
  am dutifully bound. The effort has not helped me to strength."</p>

  <p>"A good girl, a good girl, even as thy mother was," he said, dropping into
  reverie, from which she roused him by unrolling the paper.</p>

  <p>"The Lord forgive me, but&mdash;but thy love might not have been vainly
  given had I kept fast hold of all I had, as I might have done&mdash;such
  power is there in money!"</p>

  <p>"It would have been worse for me had you done so, father; for then I had
  been unworthy a look from him, and without pride in you. Shall I not read
  now?"</p>

  <p>"In a moment," he said. "Let me, for your sake, my child, show you the
  worst. Seeing it with me may make it less terrible to you. His love, Esther,
  is all bestowed."</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said, calmly.</p>

  <p>"The Egyptian has him in her net," he continued. "She has the cunning of
  her race, with beauty to help her&mdash;much beauty, great cunning; but, like
  her race again, no heart. The daughter who despises her father will bring her
  husband to grief."</p>

  <p>"Does she that?"</p>

  <p>Simonides went on:</p>

  <p>"Balthasar is a wise man who has been wonderfully favored for a Gentile,
  and his faith becomes him; yet she makes a jest of it. I heard her say,
  speaking of him yesterday, 'The follies of youth are excusable; nothing is
  admirable in the aged except wisdom, and when that goes from them, they
  should die.' A cruel speech, fit for a Roman. I applied it to myself, knowing
  a feebleness like her father's will come to me also&mdash;nay, it is not far
  off. But you, Esther, will never say of me&mdash;no, never&mdash;'It were
  better he were dead.' No, your mother was a daughter of Judah."</p>

  <p>With half-formed tears, she kissed him, and said, "I am my mother's
  child."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and my daughter&mdash;my daughter, who is to me all the Temple was
  to Solomon."</p>

  <p>After a silence, he laid his hand upon her shoulder, and resumed: "When he
  has taken the Egyptian to wife, Esther, he will think of you with repentance
  and much calling of the spirit; for at last he will awake to find himself but
  the minister of her bad ambition. Rome is the centre of all her dreams. To
  her he is the son of Arrius the duumvir, not the son of Hur, Prince of
  Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>Esther made no attempt to conceal the effect of these words.</p>

  <p>"Save him, father! It is not too late!" she said, entreatingly.</p>

  <p>He answered, with a dubious smile, "A man drowning may be saved; not so a
  man in love."</p>

  <p>"But you have influence with him. He is alone in the world. Show him his
  danger. Tell him what a woman she is."</p>

  <p>"That might save him from her. Would it give him to you, Esther? No," and
  his brows fell darkly over his eyes. "I am a servant, as my fathers were for
  generations; yet I could not say to him, 'Lo, master, my daughter! She is
  fairer than the Egyptian, and loves thee better!' I have caught too much from
  years of liberty and direction. The words would blister my tongue. The stones
  upon the old hills yonder would turn in their beds for shame when I go out to
  them. No, by the patriarchs, Esther, I would rather lay us both with your
  mother to sleep as she sleeps!"</p>

  <p>A blush burned Esther's whole face.</p>

  <p>"I did not mean you to tell him so, father. I was concerned for him
  alone&mdash;for his happiness, not mine. Because I have dared love him, I
  shall keep myself worthy his respect; so only can I excuse my folly. Let me
  read his letter now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, read it."</p>

  <p>She began at once, in haste to conclude the distasteful subject.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Nisan, 8th day.</p>

  <p class="letter">"On the road from Galilee to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The Nazarene is on the way also. With him, though without
  his knowledge, I am bringing a full legion of mine. A second legion follows.
  The Passover will excuse the multitude. He said upon setting out, 'We will go
  up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning
  me shall be accomplished.'</p>

  <p class="letter">"Our waiting draws to an end.</p>

  <p class="letter">"In haste.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Peace to thee, Simonides.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Ben-Hur.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>Esther returned the letter to her father, while a choking sensation
  gathered in her throat. There was not a word in the missive for her&mdash;not
  even in the salutation had she a share&mdash;and it would have been so easy
  to have written "and to thine, peace." For the first time in her life she
  felt the smart of a jealous sting.</p>

  <p>"The eighth day," said Simonides, "the eighth day; and this, Esther, this
  is the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The ninth," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Ah, then, they may be in Bethany now."</p>

  <p>"And possibly we may see him to-night," she added, pleased into momentary
  forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>"It may be, it may be! To-morrow is the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and he
  may wish to celebrate it; so may the Nazarene; and we may see him&mdash;we
  may see both of them, Esther."</p>

  <p>At this point the servant appeared with the wine and water. Esther helped
  her father, and in the midst of the service Iras came upon the roof.</p>

  <p>To the Jewess the Egyptian never appeared so very, very beautiful as at
  that moment. Her gauzy garments fluttered about her like a little cloud of
  mist; her forehead, neck, and arms glittered with the massive jewelry so
  affected by her people. Her countenance was suffused with pleasure. She moved
  with buoyant steps, and self-conscious, though without affectation. Esther at
  the sight shrank within herself, and nestled closer to her father.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, Simonides, and to the pretty Esther peace," said Iras,
  inclining her head to the latter. "You remind me, good master&mdash;if I may
  say it without offence-you remind me of the priests in Persia who climb their
  temples at the decline of day to send prayers after the departing sun. Is
  there anything in the worship you do not know, let me call my father. He is
  Magian-bred."</p>

  <p>"Fair Egyptian," the merchant replied, nodding with grave politeness,
  "your father is a good man who would not be offended if he knew I told you
  his Persian lore is the least part of his wisdom."</p>

  <p>Iras's lip curled slightly.</p>

  <p>"To speak like a philosopher, as you invite me," she said, "the least part
  always implies a greater. Let me ask what you esteem the greater part of the
  rare quality you are pleased to attribute to him."</p>

  <p>Simonides turned upon her somewhat sternly.</p>

  <p>"Pure wisdom always directs itself towards God; the purest wisdom is
  knowledge of God; and no man of my acquaintance has it in higher degree, or
  makes it more manifest in speech and act, than the good Balthasar."</p>

  <p>To end the parley, he raised the cup and drank.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian turned to Esther a little testily.</p>

  <p>"A man who has millions in store, and fleets of ships at sea, cannot
  discern in what simple women like us find amusement. Let us leave him. By the
  wall yonder we can talk."</p>

  <p>They went to the parapet then, stopping at the place where, years before,
  Ben-Hur loosed the broken tile upon the head of Gratus.</p>

  <p>"You have not been to Rome?" Iras began, toying the while with one of her
  unclasped bracelets.</p>

  <p>"No," said Esther, demurely.</p>

  <p>"Have you not wished to go?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Ah, how little there has been of your life!"</p>

  <p>The sigh that succeeded the exclamation could not have been more piteously
  expressive had the loss been the Egyptian's own. Next moment her laugh might
  have been heard in the street below; and she said "Oh, oh, my pretty
  simpleton! The half-fledged birds nested in the ear of the great bust out on
  the Memphian sands know nearly as much as you."</p>

  <p>Then, seeing Esther's confusion, she changed her manner, and said in a
  confiding tone, "You must not take offence. Oh no! I was playing. Let me kiss
  the hurt, and tell you what I would not to any other&mdash;not if Simbel
  himself asked it of me, offering a lotus-cup of the spray of the Nile!"</p>

  <p>Another laugh, masking excellently the look she turned sharply upon the
  Jewess, and she said, "The King is coming."</p>

  <p>Esther gazed at her in innocent surprise.</p>

  <p>"The Nazarene," Iras continued&mdash;"he whom our fathers have been
  talking about so much, whom Ben-Hur has been serving and toiling for so
  long"&mdash;her voice dropped several tones lower&mdash;"the Nazarene will be
  here to-morrow, and Ben-Hur to-night."</p>

  <p>Esther struggled to maintain her composure, but failed: her eyes fell, the
  tell-tale blood surged to her cheek and forehead, and she was saved sight of
  the triumphant smile that passed, like a gleam, over the face of the
  Egyptian.</p>

  <p>"See, here is his promise."</p>

  <p>And from her girdle she took a roll.</p>

  <p>"Rejoice with me, O my friend! He will be here tonight! On the Tiber there
  is a house, a royal property, which he has pledged to me; and to be its
  mistress is to be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A sound of some one walking swiftly along the street below interrupted the
  speech, and she leaned over the parapet to see. Then she drew back, and
  cried, with hands clasped above her head, "Now blessed be Isis! 'Tis
  he&mdash;Ben-Hur himself! That he should appear while I had such thought of
  him! There are no gods if it be not a good omen. Put your arms about me,
  Esther&mdash;and a kiss!"</p>

  <p>The Jewess looked up. Upon each cheek there was a glow; her eyes sparkled
  with a light more nearly of anger than ever her nature emitted before. Her
  gentleness had been too roughly overridden. It was not enough for her to be
  forbidden more than fugitive dreams of the man she loved; a boastful rival
  must tell her in confidence of her better success, and of the brilliant
  promises which were its rewards. Of her, the servant of a servant, there had
  been no hint of remembrance; this other could show his letter, leaving her to
  imagine all it breathed. So she said,</p>

  <p>"Dost thou love him so much, then, or Rome so much better?"</p>

  <p>The Egyptian drew back a step; then she bent her haughty head quite near
  her questioner.</p>

  <p>"What is he to thee, daughter of Simonides?"</p>

  <p>Esther, all thrilling, began, "He is my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A thought blasting as lightning stayed the words: she paled, trembled,
  recovered, and answered,</p>

  <p>"He is my father's friend."</p>

  <p>Her tongue had refused to admit her servile condition.</p>

  <p>Iras laughed more lightly than before.</p>

  <p>"Not more than that?" she said. "Ah, by the lover-gods of Egypt, thou
  mayst keep thy kisses&mdash;keep them. Thou hast taught me but now that there
  are others vastly more estimable waiting me here in Judea; and"&mdash;she
  turned away, looking back over her shoulder&mdash;"I will go get them. Peace
  to thee."</p>

  <p>Esther saw her disappear down the steps, when, putting her hands over her
  face, she burst into tears so they ran scalding through her
  fingers&mdash;tears of shame and choking passion. And, to deepen the paroxysm
  to her even temper so strange, up with a new meaning of withering force rose
  her father's words&mdash;"Thy love might not have been vainly given had I
  kept fast hold of all I had, as I might have done."</p>

  <p>And all the stars were out, burning low above the city and the dark wall
  of mountains about it, before she recovered enough to go back to the
  summer-house, and in silence take her accustomed place at her father's side,
  humbly waiting his pleasure. To such duty it seemed her youth, if not her
  life, must be given. And, let the truth be said, now that the pang was spent,
  she went not unwillingly back to the duty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch802"
     name="ch802"></a>II. &mdash; BEN-HUR TELLS OF THE NAZARENE</h2>

  <p class="first">An hour or thereabouts after the scene upon the roof,
  Balthasar and Simonides, the latter attended by Esther, met in the great
  chamber of the palace; and while they were talking, Ben-Hur and Iras came in
  together.</p>

  <p>The young Jew, advancing in front of his companion, walked first to
  Balthasar, and saluted him, and received his reply; then he turned to
  Simonides, but paused at sight of Esther.</p>

  <p>It is not often we have hearts roomy enough for more than one of the
  absorbing passions at the same time; in its blaze the others may continue to
  live, but only as lesser lights. So with Ben-Hur, much study of
  possibilities, indulgence of hopes and dreams, influences born of the
  condition of his country, influences more direct&mdash;that of Iras, for
  example&mdash;had made him in the broadest worldly sense ambitious; and as he
  had given the passion place, allowing it to become a rule, and finally an
  imperious governor, the resolves and impulses of former days faded
  imperceptibly out of being, and at last almost out of recollection. It is at
  best so easy to forget our youth; in his case it was but natural that his own
  sufferings and the mystery darkening the fate of his family should move him
  less and less as, in hope at least, he approached nearer and nearer the goals
  which occupied all his visions. Only let us not judge him too harshly.</p>

  <p>He paused in surprise at seeing Esther a woman now, and so beautiful; and
  as he stood looking at her a still voice reminded him of broken vows and
  duties undone: almost his old self returned.</p>

  <p>For an instant he was startled; but recovering, he went to Esther, and
  said, "Peace to thee, sweet Esther&mdash;peace; and thou, Simonides"&mdash;he
  looked to the merchant as he spoke&mdash;"the blessing of the Lord be thine,
  if only because thou hast been a good father to the fatherless."</p>

  <p>Esther heard him with downcast face; Simonides answered,</p>

  <p>"I repeat the welcome of the good Balthasar, son of Hur&mdash;welcome to
  thy father's house; and sit, and tell us of thy travels, and of thy work, and
  of the wonderful Nazarene&mdash;who he is, and what. If thou art not at ease
  here, who shall be? Sit, I pray&mdash;there, between us, that we may all
  hear."</p>

  <p>Esther stepped out quickly and brought a covered stool, and set it for
  him.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said to her, gratefully.</p>

  <p>When seated, after some other conversation, he addressed himself to the
  men.</p>

  <p>"I have come to tell you of the Nazarene."</p>

  <p>The two became instantly attentive.</p>

  <p>"For many days now I have followed him with such watchfulness as one may
  give another upon whom he is waiting so anxiously. I have seen him under all
  circumstances said to be trials and tests of men; and while I am certain he
  is a man as I am, not less certain am I that he is something more."</p>

  <p>"What more?" asked Simonides.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Some one coming into the room interrupted him; he turned, and arose with
  extended hands.</p>

  <p>"Amrah! Dear old Amrah!" he cried.</p>

  <p>She came forward; and they, seeing the joy in her face, thought not once
  how wrinkled and tawny it was. She knelt at his feet, clasped his knees, and
  kissed his hands over and over; and when he could he put the lank gray hair
  from her cheeks, and kissed them, saying, "Good Amrah, have you nothing,
  nothing of them&mdash;not a word&mdash;not one little sign?"</p>

  <p>Then she broke into sobbing which made him answer plainer even than the
  spoken word.</p>

  <p>"God's will has been done," he next said, solemnly, in a tone to make each
  listener know he had no hope more of finding his people. In his eyes there
  were tears which he would not have them see, because he was a man.</p>

  <p>When he could again, he took seat, and said, "Come, sit by me,
  Amrah&mdash;here. No? then at my feet; for I have much to say to these good
  friends of a wonderful man come into the world."</p>

  <p>But she went off, and stooping with her back to the wall, joined her hands
  before her knees, content, they all thought, with seeing him. Then Ben-Hur,
  bowing to the old men, began again:</p>

  <p>"I fear to answer the question asked me about the Nazarene without first
  telling you some of the things I have seen him do; and to that I am the more
  inclined, my friends, because to-morrow he will come to the city, and go up
  into the Temple, which he calls his father's house, where, it is further
  said, he will proclaim himself. So, whether you are right, O Balthasar, or
  you, Simonides, we and Israel shall know to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Balthasar rubbed his hands tremulously together, and asked, "Where shall I
  go to see him?"</p>

  <p>"The pressure of the crowd will be very great. Better, I think, that you
  all go upon the roof above the cloisters&mdash;say upon the Porch of
  Solomon."</p>

  <p>"Can you be with us?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ben-Hur, "my friends will require me, perhaps, in the
  procession."</p>

  <p>"Procession!" exclaimed Simonides. "Does he travel in state?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur saw the argument in mind.</p>

  <p>"He brings twelve men with him, fishermen, tillers of the soil, one a
  publican, all of the humbler class; and he and they make their journeys on
  foot, careless of wind, cold, rain, or sun. Seeing them stop by the wayside
  at nightfall to break bread or lie down to sleep, I have been reminded of a
  party of shepherds going back to their flocks from market, not of nobles and
  kings. Only when he lifts the corners of his handkerchief to look at some one
  or shake the dust from his head, I am made known he is their teacher as well
  as their companion&mdash;their superior not less than their friend.</p>

  <p>"You are shrewd men," Ben-Hur resumed, after a pause. "You know what
  creatures of certain master motives we are, and that it has become little
  less than a law of our nature to spend life in eager pursuit of certain
  objects; now, appealing to that law as something by which we may know
  ourselves, what would you say of a man who could be rich by making gold of
  the stones under his feet, yet is poor of choice?"</p>

  <p>"The Greeks would call him a philosopher," said Iras.</p>

  <p>"Nay, daughter," said Balthasar, "the philosophers had never the power to
  do such thing."</p>

  <p>"How know you this man has?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur answered quickly, "I saw him turn water into wine."</p>

  <p>"Very strange, very strange," said Simonides; "but it is not so strange to
  me as that he should prefer to live poor when he could be so rich. Is he so
  poor?"</p>

  <p>"He owns nothing, and envies nobody his owning. He pities the rich. But
  passing that, what would you say to see a man multiply seven loaves and two
  fishes, all his store, into enough to feed five thousand people, and have
  full baskets over? That I saw the Nazarene do."</p>

  <p>"You saw it?" exclaimed Simonides.</p>

  <p>"Ay, and ate of the bread and fish."</p>

  <p>"More marvellous still," Ben-Hur continued, "what would you say of a man
  in whom there is such healing virtue that the sick have but to touch the hem
  of his garment to be cured, or cry to him afar? That, too, I witnessed, not
  once, but many times. As we came out of Jericho two blind men by the wayside
  called to the Nazarene, and he touched their eyes, and they saw. So they
  brought a palsied man to him, and he said merely, 'Go unto thy house,' and
  the man went away well. What say you to these things?"</p>

  <p>The merchant had no answer.</p>

  <p>"Think you now, as I have heard others argue, that what I have told you
  are tricks of jugglery? Let me answer by recalling greater things which I
  have seen him do. Look first to that curse of God&mdash;comfortless, as you
  all know, except by death&mdash;leprosy."</p>

  <p>At these words Amrah dropped her hands to the floor, and in her eagerness
  to hear him half arose.</p>

  <p>"What would you say," said Ben-Hur, with increased earnestness&mdash;"what
  would you say to have seen that I now tell you? A leper came to the Nazarene
  while I was with him down in Galilee, and said, 'Lord, if thou wilt, thou
  canst make me clean.' He heard the cry, and touched the outcast with his
  hand, saying, 'Be thou clean;' and forthwith the man was himself again,
  healthful as any of us who beheld the cure, and we were a multitude."</p>

  <p>Here Amrah arose, and with her gaunt fingers held the wiry locks from her
  eyes. The brain of the poor creature had long since gone to heart, and she
  was troubled to follow the speech.</p>

  <p>"Then, again," said Ben-Hur, without stop, "ten lepers came to him one day
  in a body, and falling at his feet, called out&mdash;I saw and heard it
  all&mdash;called out, 'Master, Master, have mercy upon us!' He told them,
  'Go, show yourselves to the priest, as the law requires; and before you are
  come there ye shall be healed.'"</p>

  <p>"And were they?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. On the road going their infirmity left them, so that there was
  nothing to remind us of it except their polluted clothes."</p>

  <p>"Such thing was never heard before&mdash;never in all Israel!" said
  Simonides, in undertone.</p>

  <p>And then, while he was speaking, Amrah turned away, and walked noiselessly
  to the door, and went out; and none of the company saw her go.</p>

  <p>"The thoughts stirred by such things done under my eyes I leave you to
  imagine," said Ben-Hur, continuing; "but my doubts, my misgivings, my
  amazement, were not yet at the full. The people of Galilee are, as you know,
  impetuous and rash; after years of waiting their swords burned their hands;
  nothing would do them but action. 'He is slow to declare himself; let us
  force him,' they cried to me. And I too became impatient. If he is to be
  king, why not now? The legions are ready. So as he was once teaching by the
  seaside we would have crowned him whether or not; but he disappeared, and was
  next seen on a ship departing from the shore. Good Simonides, the desires
  that make other men mad&mdash;riches, power, even kingships offered out of
  great love by a great people&mdash;move this one not at all. What say
  you?"</p>

  <p>The merchant's chin was low upon his breast; raising his head, he replied,
  resolutely, "The Lord liveth, and so do the words of the prophets. Time is in
  the green yet; let to-morrow answer."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said Balthasar, smiling.</p>

  <p>And Ben-Hur said, "Be it so." Then he went on: "But I have not yet done.
  From these things, not too great to be above suspicion by such as did not see
  them in performance as I did, let me carry you now to others infinitely
  greater, acknowledged since the world began to be past the power of man. Tell
  me, has any one to your knowledge ever reached out and taken from Death what
  Death has made his own? Who ever gave again the breath of a life lost? Who
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God!" said Balthasar, reverently.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur bowed.</p>

  <p>"O wise Egyptian! I may not refuse the name you lend me. What would
  you&mdash;or you, Simonides&mdash;what would you either or both have said had
  you seen as I did, a man, with few words and no ceremony, without effort more
  than a mother's when she speaks to wake her child asleep, undo the work of
  Death? It was down at Nain. We were about going into the gate, when a company
  came out bearing a dead man. The Nazarene stopped to let the train pass.
  There was a woman among them crying. I saw his face soften with pity. He
  spoke to her, then went and touched the bier, and said to him who lay upon it
  dressed for burial, 'Young man, I say unto thee, Arise!' And instantly the
  dead sat up and talked."</p>

  <p>"God only is so great," said Balthasar to Simonides.</p>

  <p>"Mark you," Ben-Hur proceeded, "I do but tell you things of which I was a
  witness, together with a cloud of other men. On the way hither I saw another
  act still more mighty. In Bethany there was a man named Lazarus, who died and
  was buried; and after he had lain four days in a tomb, shut in by a great
  stone, the Nazarene was shown to the place. Upon rolling the stone away, we
  beheld the man lying inside bound and rotting. There were many people
  standing by, and we all heard what the Nazarene said, for he spoke in a loud
  voice: 'Lazarus, come forth!' I cannot tell you my feelings when in answer,
  as it were, the man arose and came out to us with all his cerements about
  him. 'Loose him,' said the Nazarene next, 'loose him, and let him go.' And
  when the napkin was taken from the face of the resurrected, lo, my friends!
  the blood ran anew through the wasted body, and he was exactly as he had been
  in life before the sickness that took him off. He lives yet, and is hourly
  seen and spoken to. You may go see him to-morrow. And now, as nothing more is
  needed for the purpose, I ask you that which I came to ask, it being but a
  repetition of what you asked me, O Simonides, What more than a man is this
  Nazarene?"</p>

  <p>The question was put solemnly, and long after midnight the company sat and
  debated it; Simonides being yet unwilling to give up his understanding of the
  sayings of the prophets, and Ben-Hur contending that the elder disputants
  were both right&mdash;that the Nazarene was the Redeemer, as claimed by
  Balthasar, and also the destined king the merchant would have.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow we will see. Peace to you all."</p>

  <p>So saying, Ben-Hur took his leave, intending to return to Bethany.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch803"
     name="ch803"></a>III. &mdash; THE LEPERS LEAVE THEIR TOMB</h2>

  <p class="first">The first person to go out of the city upon the opening of
  the Sheep's Gate next morning was Amrah, basket on arm. No questions were
  asked her by the keepers, since the morning itself had not been more regular
  in coming than she; they knew her somebody's faithful servant, and that was
  enough for them.</p>

  <p>Down the eastern valley she took her way. The side of Olivet, darkly
  green, was spotted with white tents recently put up by people attending the
  feasts; the hour, however, was too early for the strangers to be abroad;
  still, had it not been so, no one would have troubled her. Past Gethsemane;
  past the tombs at the meeting of the Bethany roads; past the sepulchral
  village of Siloam she went. Occasionally the decrepit little body staggered;
  once she sat down to get her breath; rising shortly, she struggled on with
  renewed haste. The great rocks on either hand, if they had had ears, might
  have heard her mutter to herself; could they have seen, it would have been to
  observe how frequently she looked up over the Mount, reproving the dawn for
  its promptness; if it had been possible for them to gossip, not improbably
  they would have said to each other, "Our friend is in a hurry this morning;
  the mouths she goes to feed must be very hungry."</p>

  <p>When at last she reached the King's Garden she slackened her gait; for
  then the grim city of the lepers was in view, extending far round the pitted
  south hill of Hinnom.</p>

  <p>As the reader must by this time have surmised, she was going to her
  mistress, whose tomb, it will be remembered, overlooked the well
  En-Rogel.</p>

  <p>Early as it was, the unhappy woman was up and sitting outside, leaving
  Tirzah asleep within. The course of the malady had been terribly swift in the
  three years. Conscious of her appearance, with the refined instincts of her
  nature, she kept her whole person habitually covered. Seldom as possible she
  permitted even Tirzah to see her.</p>

  <p>This morning she was taking the air with bared head, knowing there was no
  one to be shocked by the exposure. The light was not full, but enough to show
  the ravages to which she had been subject. Her hair was snow-white and
  unmanageably coarse, falling over her back and shoulders like so much silver
  wire. The eyelids, the lips, the nostrils, the flesh of the cheeks, were
  either gone or reduced to fetid rawness. The neck was a mass of ash-colored
  scales. One hand lay outside the folds of her habit rigid as that of a
  skeleton; the nails had been eaten away; the joints of the fingers, if not
  bare to the bone, were swollen knots crusted with red secretion. Head, face,
  neck, and hand indicated all too plainly the condition of the whole body.
  Seeing her thus, it was easy to understand how the once fair widow of the
  princely Hur had been able to maintain her incognito so well through such a
  period of years.</p>

  <p>When the sun would gild the crest of Olivet and the Mount of Offence with
  light sharper and more brilliant in that old land than in the West, she knew
  Amrah would come, first to the well, then to a stone midway the well and the
  foot of the hill on which she had her abode, and that the good servant would
  there deposit the food she carried in the basket, and fill the water-jar
  afresh for the day. Of her former plentitude of happiness, that brief visit
  was all that remained to the unfortunate. She could then ask about her son,
  and be told of his welfare, with such bits of news concerning him as the
  messenger could glean. Usually the information was meagre enough, yet
  comforting; at times she heard he was at home; then she would issue from her
  dreary cell at break of day, and sit till noon, and from noon to set of sun,
  a motionless figure draped in white, looking, statue-like, invariably to one
  point&mdash;over the Temple to the spot under the rounded sky where the old
  house stood, dear in memory, and dearer because he was there. Nothing else
  was left her. Tirzah she counted of the dead; and as for herself, she simply
  waited the end, knowing every hour of life was an hour of
  dying&mdash;happily, of painless dying.</p>

  <p>The things of nature about the hill to keep her sensitive to the world's
  attractions were wretchedly scant; beasts and birds avoided the place as if
  they knew its history and present use; every green thing perished in its
  first season; the winds warred upon the shrubs and venturous grasses, leaving
  to drought such as they could not uproot. Look where she would, the view was
  made depressingly suggestive by tombs&mdash;tombs above her, tombs below,
  tombs opposite her own tomb&mdash;all now freshly whitened in warning to
  visiting pilgrims. In the sky&mdash;clear, fair, inviting&mdash;one would
  think she might have found some relief to her ache of mind; but, alas! in
  making the beautiful elsewhere the sun served her never so
  unfriendly&mdash;it did but disclose her growing hideousness. But for the sun
  she would not have been the horror she was to herself, nor been waked so
  cruelly from dreams of Tirzah as she used to be. The gift of seeing can be
  sometimes a dreadful curse.</p>

  <p>Does one ask why she did not make an end to her sufferings?</p>

  <p>THE LAW FORBADE HER!</p>

  <p>A Gentile may smile at the answer; but so will not a son of Israel.</p>

  <p>While she sat there peopling the dusky solitude with thoughts even more
  cheerless, suddenly a woman came up the hill staggering and spent with
  exertion.</p>

  <p>The widow arose hastily, and covering her head, cried, in a voice
  unnaturally harsh, "Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>In a moment, heedless of the notice, Amrah was at her feet. All the
  long-pent love of the simple creature burst forth: with tears and passionate
  exclamations she kissed her mistress's garments, and for a while the latter
  strove to escape from her; then, seeing she could not, she waited till the
  violence of the paroxysm was over.</p>

  <p>"What have you done, Amrah?" she said. "Is it by such disobedience you
  prove your love for us? Wicked woman! You are lost; and he&mdash;your
  master&mdash;you can never, never go back to him."</p>

  <p>Amrah grovelled sobbing in the dust.</p>

  <p>"The ban of the Law is upon you, too; you cannot return to Jerusalem. What
  will become of us? Who will bring us bread? O wicked, wicked Amrah! We are
  all, all undone alike!"</p>

  <p>"Mercy, mercy!" Amrah answered from the ground.</p>

  <p>"You should have been merciful to yourself, and by so doing been most
  merciful to us. Now where can we fly? There is no one to help us. O false
  servant! The wrath of the Lord was already too heavy upon us."</p>

  <p>Here Tirzah, awakened by the noise, appeared at the door of the tomb. The
  pen shrinks from the picture she presented. In the half-clad apparition,
  patched with scales, lividly seamed, nearly blind, its limbs and extremities
  swollen to grotesque largeness, familiar eyes however sharpened by love could
  not have recognized the creature of childish grace and purity we first beheld
  her.</p>

  <p>"Is it Amrah, mother?"</p>

  <p>The servant tried to crawl to her also.</p>

  <p>"Stay, Amrah!" the widow cried, imperiously. "I forbid you touching her.
  Rise, and get you gone before any at the well see you here. Nay, I
  forgot&mdash;it is too late! You must remain now and share our doom. Rise, I
  say!"</p>

  <p>Amrah rose to her knees, and said, brokenly and with clasped hands, "O
  good mistress! I am not false&mdash;I am not wicked. I bring you good
  tidings."</p>

  <p>"Of Judah?" and as she spoke, the widow half withdrew the cloth from her
  head.</p>

  <p>"There is a wonderful man," Amrah continued, "who has power to cure you.
  He speaks a word, and the sick are made well, and even the dead come to life.
  I have come to take you to him."</p>

  <p>"Poor Amrah!" said Tirzah, compassionately.</p>

  <p>"No," cried Amrah, detecting the doubt underlying the
  expression&mdash;"no, as the Lord lives, even the Lord of Israel, my God as
  well as yours, I speak the truth. Go with me, I pray, and lose no time. This
  morning he will pass by on his way to the city. See! the day is at hand. Take
  the food here&mdash;eat, and let us go."</p>

  <p>The mother listened eagerly. Not unlikely she had heard of the wonderful
  man, for by this time his fame had penetrated every nook in the land.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A Nazarene."</p>

  <p>"Who told you about him?"</p>

  <p>"Judah."</p>

  <p>"Judah told you? Is he at home?"</p>

  <p>"He came last night."</p>

  <p>The widow, trying to still the beating of her heart, was silent
  awhile.</p>

  <p>"Did Judah send you to tell us this?" she next asked.</p>

  <p>"No. He believes you dead."</p>

  <p>"There was a prophet once who cured a leper," the mother said thoughtfully
  to Tirzah; "but he had his power from God." Then addressing Amrah, she asked,
  "How does my son know this man so possessed?"</p>

  <p>"He was travelling with him, and heard the lepers call, and saw them go
  away well. First there was one man; then there were ten; and they were all
  made whole."</p>

  <p>The elder listener was silent again. The skeleton hand shook. We may
  believe she was struggling to give the story the sanction of faith, which is
  always an absolutist in demand, and that it was with her as with the men of
  the day, eye-witnesses of what was done by the Christ, as well as the myriads
  who have succeeded them. She did not question the performance, for her own
  son was the witness testifying through the servant; but she strove to
  comprehend the power by which work so astonishing could be done by a man.
  Well enough to make inquiry as to the fact; to comprehend the power, on the
  other hand, it is first necessary to comprehend God; and he who waits for
  that will die waiting. With her, however, the hesitation was brief. To Tirzah
  she said,</p>

  <p>"This must be the Messiah!"</p>

  <p>She spoke not coldly, like one reasoning a doubt away, but as a woman of
  Israel familiar with the promises of God to her race&mdash;a woman of
  understanding, ready to be glad over the least sign of the realization of the
  promises.</p>

  <p>"There was a time when Jerusalem and all Judea were filled with a story
  that he was born. I remember it. By this time he should be a man. It must
  be&mdash;it is he. Yes," she said to Amrah, "we will go with you. Bring the
  water which you will find in the tomb in a jar, and set the food for us. We
  will eat and be gone."</p>

  <p>The breakfast, partaken under excitement, was soon despatched, and the
  three women set out on their extraordinary journey. As Tirzah had caught the
  confident spirit of the others, there was but one fear that troubled the
  party. Bethany, Amrah said, was the town the man was coming from; now from
  that to Jerusalem there were three roads, or rather paths&mdash;one over the
  first summit of Olivet, a second at its base, a third between the second
  summit and the Mount of Offence. The three were not far apart; far enough,
  however, to make it possible for the unfortunates to miss the Nazarene if
  they failed the one he chose to come by.</p>

  <p>A little questioning satisfied the mother that Amrah knew nothing of the
  country beyond the Cedron, and even less of the intentions of the man they
  were going to see, if they could. She discerned, also, that both Amrah and
  Tirzah&mdash;the one from confirmed habits of servitude, the other from
  natural dependency&mdash;looked to her for guidance; and she accepted the
  charge.</p>

  <p>"We will go first to Bethphage," she said to them. "There, if the Lord
  favor us, we may learn what else to do."</p>

  <p>They descended the hill to Tophet and the King's Garden, and paused in the
  deep trail furrowed through them by centuries of wayfaring.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of the road," the matron said. "Better that we keep to the
  country among the rocks and trees. This is feast-day, and on the hill-sides
  yonder I see signs of a great multitude in attendance. By going across the
  Mount of Offence here we may avoid them."</p>

  <p>Tirzah had been walking with great difficulty; upon hearing this her heart
  began to fail her.</p>

  <p>"The mount is steep, mother; I cannot climb it."</p>

  <p>"Remember, we are going to find health and life. See, my child, how the
  day brightens around us! And yonder are women coming this way to the well.
  They will stone us if we stay here. Come, be strong this once."</p>

  <p>Thus the mother, not less tortured herself, sought to inspire the
  daughter; and Amrah came to her aid. To this time the latter had not touched
  the persons of the afflicted, nor they her; now, in disregard of consequences
  as well as of command, the faithful creature went to Tirzah, and put her arm
  over her shoulder, and whispered, "Lean on me. I am strong, though I am old;
  and it is but a little way off. There&mdash;now we can go."</p>

  <p>The face of the hill they essayed to cross was somewhat broken with pits,
  and ruins of old structures; but when at last they stood upon the top to
  rest, and looked at the spectacle presented them over in the
  northwest&mdash;at the Temple and its courtly terraces, at Zion, at the
  enduring towers white beetling into the sky beyond&mdash;the mother was
  strengthened with a love of life for life's sake.</p>

  <p>"Look, Tirzah," she said&mdash;"look at the plates of gold on the Gate
  Beautiful. How they give back the flames of the sun, brightness for
  brightness! Do you remember we used to go up there? Will it not be pleasant
  to do so again? And think&mdash;home is but a little way off. I can almost
  see it over the roof of the Holy of Holies; and Judah will be there to
  receive us!"</p>

  <p>From the side of the middle summit garnished green with myrtle and olive
  trees, they saw, upon looking that way next, thin columns of smoke rising
  lightly and straight up into the pulseless morning, each a warning of
  restless pilgrims astir, and of the flight of the pitiless hours, and the
  need of haste.</p>

  <p>Though the good servant toiled faithfully to lighten the labor in
  descending the hill-side, not sparing herself in the least, the girl moaned
  at every step; sometimes in extremity of anguish she cried out. Upon reaching
  the road&mdash;that is, the road between the Mount of Offence and the middle
  or second summit of Olivet&mdash;she fell down exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Go on with Amrah, mother, and leave me here," she said, faintly.</p>

  <p>"No, no, Tirzah. What would the gain be to me if I were healed and you
  not? When Judah asks for you, as he will, what would I have to say to him
  were I to leave you?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him I loved him."</p>

  <p>The elder leper arose from bending over the fainting sufferer, and gazed
  about her with that sensation of hope perishing which is more nearly like
  annihilation of the soul than anything else. The supremest joy of the thought
  of cure was inseparable from Tirzah, who was not too old to forget, in the
  happiness of healthful life to come, the years of misery by which she had
  been so reduced in body and broken in spirit. Even as the brave woman was
  about leaving the venture they were engaged in to the determination of God,
  she saw a man on foot coming rapidly up the road from the east.</p>

  <p>"Courage, Tirzah! Be of cheer," she said. "Yonder I know is one to tell us
  of the Nazarene."</p>

  <p>Amrah helped the girl to a sitting posture, and supported her while the
  man advanced.</p>

  <p>"In your goodness, mother, you forget what we are. The stranger will go
  around us; his best gift to us will be a curse, if not a stone."</p>

  <p>"We will see."</p>

  <p>There was no other answer to be given, since the mother was too well and
  sadly acquainted with the treatment outcasts of the class to which she
  belonged were accustomed to at the hands of her countrymen.</p>

  <p>As has been said, the road at the edge of which the group was posted was
  little more than a worn path or trail, winding crookedly through tumuli of
  limestone. If the stranger kept it, he must meet them face to face; and he
  did so, until near enough to hear the cry she was bound to give. Then,
  uncovering her head, a further demand of the law, she shouted shrilly,</p>

  <p>"Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the man came steadily on.</p>

  <p>"What would you have?" he asked, stopping opposite them not four yards
  off.</p>

  <p>"Thou seest us. Have a care," the mother said, with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Woman, I am the courier of him who speaketh but once to such as thou and
  they are healed. I am not afraid."</p>

  <p>"The Nazarene?"</p>

  <p>"The Messiah," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is it true that he cometh to the city to-day?"</p>

  <p>"He is now at Bethphage."</p>

  <p>"On what road, master?"</p>

  <p>"This one."</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands, and looked up thankfully.</p>

  <p>"For whom takest thou him?" the man asked, with pity.</p>

  <p>"The Son of God," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Stay thou here then; or, as there is a multitude with him, take thy stand
  by the rock yonder, the white one under the tree; and as he goeth by fail not
  to call to him; call, and fear not. If thy faith but equal thy knowledge, he
  will hear thee though all the heavens thunder. I go to tell Israel, assembled
  in and about the city, that he is at hand, and to make ready to receive him.
  Peace to thee and thine, woman."</p>

  <p>The stranger moved on.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear, Tirzah? Did you hear? The Nazarene is on the road, on this
  one, and he will hear us. Once more, my child&mdash;oh, only once! and let us
  to the rock. It is but a step."</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged Tirzah took Amrah's hand and arose; but as they were
  going, Amrah said, "Stay; the man is returning." And they waited for him.</p>

  <p>"I pray your grace, woman," he said, upon overtaking them. "Remembering
  that the sun will be hot before the Nazarene arrives, and that the city is
  near by to give me refreshment should I need it, I thought this water would
  do thee better than it will me. Take it and be of good cheer. Call to him as
  he passes."</p>

  <p>He followed the words by offering her a gourd full of water, such as
  foot-travellers sometimes carried with them in their journeys across the
  hills; and instead of placing the gift on the ground for her to take up when
  he was at a safe distance, he gave it into her hand.</p>

  <p>"Art thou a Jew?" she asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"I am that, and better; I am a disciple of the Christ who teacheth daily
  by word and example this thing which I have done unto you. The world hath
  long known the word charity without understanding it. Again I say peace and
  good cheer to thee and thine."</p>

  <p>He went on, and they went slowly to the rock he had pointed out to them,
  high as their heads, and scarcely thirty yards from the road on the right.
  Standing in front of it, the mother satisfied herself they could be seen and
  heard plainly by passers-by whose notice they desired to attract. There they
  cast themselves under the tree in its shade, and drank of the gourd, and
  rested refreshed. Ere long Tirzah slept, and fearing to disturb her, the
  others held their peace.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch804"
     name="ch804"></a>IV. &mdash; THE MIRACLE</h2>

  <p class="first">During the third hour the road in front of the resting-
  place of the lepers became gradually more and more frequented by people going
  in the direction of Bethphage and Bethany; now, however, about the
  commencement of the fourth hour, a great crowd appeared over the crest of
  Olivet, and as it defiled down the road thousands in number, the two watchers
  noticed with wonder that every one in it carried a palm-branch freshly cut.
  As they sat absorbed by the novelty, the noise of another multitude
  approaching from the east drew their eyes that way. Then the mother awoke
  Tirzah.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of it all?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," answered the mother. "These we see are from the city going
  to meet him; those we hear in the east are his friends bearing him company;
  and it will not be strange if the processions meet here before us.</p>

  <p>"I fear, if they do, we cannot be heard."</p>

  <p>The same thought was in the elder's mind.</p>

  <p>"Amrah," she asked, "when Judah spoke of the healing of the ten, in what
  words did he say they called to the Nazarene?"</p>

  <p>"Either they said, 'Lord, have mercy upon us,' or 'Master, have
  mercy.'"</p>

  <p>"Only that?"</p>

  <p>"No more that I heard."</p>

  <p>"Yet it was enough," the mother added, to herself.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Amrah, "Judah said he saw them go away well."</p>

  <p>Meantime the people in the east came up slowly. When at length the
  foremost of them were in sight, the gaze of the lepers fixed upon a man
  riding in the midst of what seemed a chosen company which sang and danced
  about him in extravagance of joy. The rider was bareheaded and clad all in
  white. When he was in distance to be more clearly observed, these, looking
  anxiously, saw an olive-hued face shaded by long chestnut hair slightly
  sunburned and parted in the middle. He looked neither to the right nor left.
  In the noisy abandon of his followers he appeared to have no part; nor did
  their favor disturb him in the least, or raise him out of the profound
  melancholy into which, as his countenance showed, he was plunged. The sun
  beat upon the back of his head, and lighting up the floating hair gave it a
  delicate likeness to a golden nimbus. Behind him the irregular procession,
  pouring forward with continuous singing and shouting, extended out of view.
  There was no need of any one to tell the lepers that this was he&mdash;the
  wonderful Nazarene!</p>

  <p>"He is here, Tirzah," the mother said; "he is here. Come, my child."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she glided in front of the white rock and fell upon her
  knees.</p>

  <p>Directly the daughter and servant were by her side. Then at sight of the
  procession in the west, the thousands from the city halted, and began to wave
  their green branches, shouting, or rather chanting (for it was all in one
  voice),</p>

  <p>"Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord!"</p>

  <p>And all the thousands who were of the rider's company, both those near and
  those afar, replied so the air shook with the sound, which was as a great
  wind threshing the side of the hill. Amidst the din, the cries of the poor
  lepers were not more than the twittering of dazed sparrows.</p>

  <p>The moment of the meeting of the hosts was come, and with it the
  opportunity the sufferers were seeking; if not taken, it would be lost
  forever, and they would be lost as well.</p>

  <p>"Nearer, my child&mdash;let us get nearer. He cannot hear us," said the
  mother.</p>

  <p>She arose, and staggered forward. Her ghastly hands were up, and she
  screamed with horrible shrillness. The people saw her&mdash;saw her hideous
  face, and stopped awe-struck&mdash;an effect for which extreme human misery,
  visible as in this instance, is as potent as majesty in purple and gold.
  Tirzah, behind her a little way, fell down too faint and frightened to follow
  farther.</p>

  <p>"The lepers! the lepers!"</p>

  <p>"Stone them!"</p>

  <p>"The accursed of God! Kill them!"</p>

  <p>These, with other yells of like import, broke in upon the hosannas of the
  part of the multitude too far removed to see and understand the cause of the
  interruption. Some there were, however, near by familiar with the nature of
  the man to whom the unfortunates were appealing&mdash;some who, by long
  intercourse with him, had caught somewhat of his divine compassion: they
  gazed at him, and were silent while, in fair view, he rode up and stopped in
  front of the woman. She also beheld his face&mdash;calm, pitiful, and of
  exceeding beauty, the large eyes tender with benignant purpose.</p>

  <p>And this was the colloquy that ensued:</p>

  <p>"O Master, Master! Thou seest our need; thou canst make us clean. Have
  mercy upon us&mdash;mercy!"</p>

  <p>"Believest thou I am able to do this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Thou art he of whom the prophets spake&mdash;thou art the Messiah!" she
  replied.</p>

  <p>His eyes grew radiant, his manner confident.</p>

  <p>"Woman," he said, "great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou
  wilt."</p>

  <p>He lingered an instant after, apparently unconscious of the presence of
  the throng&mdash;an instant&mdash;then he rode away.</p>

  <p>To the heart divinely original, yet so human in all the better elements of
  humanity, going with sure prevision to a death of all the inventions of men
  the foulest and most cruel, breathing even then in the forecast shadow of the
  awful event, and still as hungry and thirsty for love and faith as in the
  beginning, how precious and ineffably soothing the farewell exclamation of
  the grateful woman:</p>

  <p>"To God in the highest, glory! Blessed, thrice blessed, the Son whom he
  hath given us!"</p>

  <p>Immediately both the hosts, that from the city and that from Bethphage,
  closed around him with their joyous demonstrations, with hosannas and waving
  of palms, and so he passed from the lepers forever. Covering her head, the
  elder hastened to Tirzah, and folded her in her arms, crying, "Daughter, look
  up! I have his promise; he is indeed the Messiah. We are saved&mdash;saved!"
  And the two remained kneeling while the procession, slowly going, disappeared
  over the mount. When the noise of its singing afar was a sound scarcely heard
  the miracle began.</p>

  <p>There was first in the hearts of the lepers a freshening of the blood;
  then it flowed faster and stronger, thrilling their wasted bodies with an
  infinitely sweet sense of painless healing. Each felt the scourge going from
  her; their strength revived; they were returning to be themselves. Directly,
  as if to make the purification complete, from body to spirit the quickening
  ran, exalting them to a very fervor of ecstasy. The power possessing them to
  this good end was most nearly that of a draught of swift and happy effect;
  yet it was unlike and superior in that its healing and cleansing were
  absolute, and not merely a delicious consciousness while in progress, but the
  planting, growing, and maturing all at once of a recollection so singular and
  so holy that the simple thought of it should be of itself ever after a
  formless yet perfect thanksgiving.</p>

  <p>To this transformation&mdash;for such it may be called quite as properly
  as a cure&mdash;there was a witness other than Amrah. The reader will
  remember the constancy with which Ben-Hur had followed the Nazarene
  throughout his wanderings; and now, recalling the conversation of the night
  before, there will be little surprise at learning that the young Jew was
  present when the leprous woman appeared in the path of the pilgrims. He heard
  her prayer, and saw her disfigured face; he heard the answer also, and was
  not so accustomed to incidents of the kind, frequent as they had been, as to
  have lost interest in them. Had such thing been possible with him, still the
  bitter disputation always excited by the simplest display of the Master's
  curative gift would have sufficed to keep his curiosity alive. Besides that,
  if not above it as an incentive, his hope to satisfy himself upon the vexed
  question of the mission of the mysterious man was still upon him strong as in
  the beginning; we might indeed say even stronger, because of a belief that
  now quickly, before the sun went down, the man himself would make all known
  by public proclamation. At the close of the scene, consequently, Ben-Hur had
  withdrawn from the procession, and seated himself upon a stone to wait its
  passage.</p>

  <p>From his place he nodded recognition to many of the people&mdash;Galileans
  in his league, carrying short swords under their long abbas. After a little a
  swarthy Arab came up leading two horses; at a sign from Ben-Hur he also drew
  out.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," the young master said, when all were gone by, even the
  laggards. "I wish to be at the city early, and Aldebaran must do me
  service."</p>

  <p>He stroked the broad forehead of the horse, now in his prime of strength
  and beauty, then crossed the road towards the two women.</p>

  <p>They were to him, it should be borne in mind, strangers in whom he felt
  interest only as they were subjects of a superhuman experiment, the result of
  which might possibly help him to solution of the mystery that had so long
  engaged him. As he proceeded, he glanced casually at the figure of the little
  woman over by the white rock, standing there, her face hidden in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"As the Lord liveth, it is Amrah!" he said to himself.</p>

  <p>He hurried on, and passing by the mother and daughter, still without
  recognizing them, he stopped before the servant.</p>

  <p>"Amrah," he said to her, "Amrah, what do you here?"</p>

  <p>She rushed forward, and fell upon her knees before him, blinded by her
  tears, nigh speechless with contending joy and fear.</p>

  <p>"O master, master! Thy God and mine, how good he is!"</p>

  <p>The knowledge we gain from much sympathy with others passing through
  trials is but vaguely understood; strangely enough, it enables us, among
  other things, to merge our identity into theirs often so completely that
  their sorrows and their delights become our own. So poor Amrah, aloof and
  hiding her face, knew the transformation the lepers were undergoing without a
  word spoken to her&mdash;knew it, and shared all their feeling to the full.
  Her countenance, her words, her whole manner, betrayed her condition; and
  with swift presentiment he connected it with the women he had just passed: he
  felt her presence there at that time was in some way associated with them,
  and turned hastily as they arose to their feet. His heart stood still, he
  became rooted in his tracks&mdash;dumb past outcry&mdash;awe-struck.</p>

  <p>The woman he had seen before the Nazarene was standing with her hands
  clasped and eyes streaming, looking towards heaven. The mere transformation
  would have been a sufficient surprise; but it was the least of the causes of
  his emotion. Could he be mistaken? Never was there in life a stranger so like
  his mother; and like her as she was the day the Roman snatched her from him.
  There was but one difference to mar the identity&mdash;the hair of this
  person was a little streaked with gray; yet that was not impossible of
  reconcilement, since the intelligence which had directed the miracle might
  have taken into consideration the natural effects of the passage of years.
  And who was it by her side, if not Tirzah?&mdash;fair, beautiful, perfect,
  more mature, but in all other respects exactly the same in appearance as when
  she looked with him over the parapet the morning of the accident to Gratus.
  He had given them over as dead, and time had accustomed him to the
  bereavement; he had not ceased mourning for them, yet, as something
  distinguishable, they had simply dropped out of his plans and dreams.
  Scarcely believing his senses, he laid his hand upon the servant's head, and
  asked, tremulously,</p>

  <p>"Amrah, Amrah&mdash;my mother! Tirzah! tell me if I see aright."</p>

  <p>"Speak to them, O master, speak to them!" she said.</p>

  <p>He waited no longer, but ran, with outstretched arms, crying, "Mother!
  mother! Tirzah! Here I am!"</p>

  <p>They heard his call, and with a cry as loving started to meet him.
  Suddenly the mother stopped, drew back, and uttered the old alarm,</p>

  <p>"Stay, Judah, my son; come not nearer. Unclean, unclean!"</p>

  <p>The utterance was not from habit, grown since the dread disease struck
  her, as much as fear; and the fear was but another form of the
  ever-thoughtful maternal love. Though they were healed in person, the taint
  of the scourge might be in their garments ready for communication. He had no
  such thought. They were before him; he had called them, they had answered.
  Who or what should keep them from him now? Next moment the three, so long
  separated, were mingling their tears in each other's arms.</p>

  <p>The first ecstasy over, the mother said, "In this happiness, O my
  children, let us not be ungrateful. Let us begin life anew by acknowledgment
  of him to whom we are all so indebted."</p>

  <p>They fell upon their knees, Amrah with the rest; and the prayer of the
  elder outspoken was as a psalm.</p>

  <p>Tirzah repeated it word for word; so did Ben-Hur, but not with the same
  clear mind and questionless faith; for when they were risen, he asked,</p>

  <p>"In Nazareth, where the man was born, mother, they call him the son of a
  carpenter. What is he?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes rested upon him with all their old tenderness, and she answered
  as she had answered the Nazarene himself&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He is the Messiah."</p>

  <p>"And whence has he his power?"</p>

  <p>"We may know by the use he makes of it. Can you tell me any ill he has
  done?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"By that sign then I answer, He has his power from God."</p>

  <p>It is not an easy thing to shake off in a moment the expectations nurtured
  through years until they have become essentially a part of us; and though
  Ben-Hur asked himself what the vanities of the world were to such a one, his
  ambition was obdurate and would not down. He persisted as men do yet every
  day in measuring the Christ by himself. How much better if we measured
  ourselves by the Christ!</p>

  <p>Naturally, the mother was the first to think of the cares of life.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do now, my son? Where shall we go?"</p>

  <p>Then Ben-Hur, recalled to duty, observed how completely every trace of the
  scourge had disappeared from his restored people; that each had back her
  perfection of person; that, as with Naaman when he came up out of the water,
  their flesh had come again like unto the flesh of a little child; and he took
  off his cloak, and threw it over Tirzah.</p>

  <p>"Take it," he said, smiling; "the eye of the stranger would have shunned
  you before, now it shall not offend you."</p>

  <p>The act exposed a sword belted to his side.</p>

  <p>"Is it a time of war?" asked the mother, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, are you armed?"</p>

  <p>"It may be necessary to defend the Nazarene."</p>

  <p>Thus Ben-Hur evaded the whole truth.</p>

  <p>"Has he enemies? Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, mother, they are not all Romans!"</p>

  <p>"Is he not of Israel, and a man of peace?"</p>

  <p>"There was never one more so; but in the opinion of the rabbis and
  teachers he is guilty of a great crime."</p>

  <p>"What crime?"</p>

  <p>"In his eyes the uncircumcised Gentile is as worthy favor as a Jew of the
  strictest habit. He preaches a new dispensation."</p>

  <p>The mother was silent, and they moved to the shade of the tree by the
  rock. Calming his impatience to have them home again and hear their story, he
  showed them the necessity of obedience to the law governing in cases like
  theirs, and in conclusion called the Arab, bidding him take the horses to the
  gate by Bethesda and await him there; whereupon they set out by the way of
  the Mount of Offence. The return was very different from the coming; they
  walked rapidly and with ease, and in good time reached a tomb newly made near
  that of Absalom, overlooking the depths of Cedron. Finding it unoccupied, the
  women took possession, while he went on hastily to make the preparations
  required for their new condition.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch805"
     name="ch805"></a>V. &mdash; PILGRIMS TO THE PASSOVER</h2>

  <p class="first">Ben-Hur pitched two tents out on the Upper Cedron east a
  short space of the Tombs of the Kings, and furnished them with every comfort
  at his command; and thither, without loss of time, he conducted his mother
  and sister, to remain until the examining priest could certify their perfect
  cleansing.</p>

  <p>In course of the duty, the young man had subjected himself to such serious
  defilement as to debar him from participation in the ceremonies of the great
  feast, then near at hand. He could not enter the least sacred of the courts
  of the Temple. Of necessity, not less than choice, therefore, he stayed at
  the tents with his beloved people. There was a great deal to hear from them,
  and a great deal to tell them of himself.</p>

  <p>Stories such as theirs&mdash;sad experiences extending through a lapse of
  years, sufferings of body, acuter sufferings of mind&mdash;are usually long
  in the telling, the incidents seldom following each other in threaded
  connection. He listened to the narrative and all they told him, with outward
  patience masking inward feeling. In fact, his hatred of Rome and Romans
  reached a higher mark than ever; his desire for vengeance became a thirst
  which attempts at reflection only intensified. In the almost savage
  bitterness of his humor many mad impulses took hold of him. The opportunities
  of the highways presented themselves with singular force of temptation; he
  thought seriously of insurrection in Galilee; even the sea, ordinarily a
  retrospective horror to him, stretched itself map-like before his fancy,
  laced and interlaced with lines of passage crowded with imperial plunder and
  imperial travellers; but the better judgment matured in calmer hours was
  happily too firmly fixed to be supplanted by present passion however strong.
  Each mental venture in reach of new expedients brought him back to the old
  conclusion&mdash;that there could be no sound success except in a war
  involving all Israel in solid union; and all musing upon the subject, all
  inquiry, all hope, ended where they began&mdash;in the Nazarene and his
  purposes.</p>

  <p>At odd moments the excited schemer found a pleasure in fashioning a speech
  for that person:</p>

  <p>"Hear, O Israel! I am he, the promised of God, born King of the
  Jews&mdash;come to you with the dominion spoken of by the prophets. Rise now,
  and lay hold on the world!"</p>

  <p>Would the Nazarene but speak these few words, what a tumult would follow!
  How many mouths performing the office of trumpets would take them up and blow
  them abroad for the massing of armies!</p>

  <p>Would he speak them?</p>

  <p>And eager to begin the work, and answering in the worldly way, Ben-Hur
  lost sight of the double nature of the man, and of the other possibility,
  that the divine in him might transcend the human. In the miracle of which
  Tirzah and his mother were the witnesses even more nearly than himself, he
  saw and set apart and dwelt upon a power ample enough to raise and support a
  Jewish crown over the wrecks of the Italian, and more than ample to remodel
  society, and convert mankind into one purified happy family; and when that
  work was done, could any one say the peace which might then be ordered
  without hindrance was not a mission worthy a son of God? Could any one then
  deny the Redeemership of the Christ? And discarding all consideration of
  political consequences, what unspeakable personal glory there would then be
  to him as a man? It was not in the nature of any mere mortal to refuse such a
  career.</p>

  <p>Meantime down the Cedron, and in towards Bezetha, especially on the
  roadsides quite up to the Damascus Gate, the country filled rapidly with all
  kinds of temporary shelters for pilgrims to the Passover. Ben-Hur visited the
  strangers, and talked with them; and returning to his tents, he was each time
  more and more astonished at the vastness of their numbers. And when he
  further discovered that every part of the world was represented among
  them&mdash;cities upon both shores of the Mediterranean far off as the
  Pillars of the West, river-towns in distant India, provinces in northernmost
  Europe; and that, though they frequently saluted him with tongues
  unacquainted with a syllable of the old Hebrew of the fathers, these
  representatives had all the same object&mdash;celebration of the notable
  feast&mdash;an idea tinged mistily with superstitious fancy forced itself
  upon him. Might he not after all have misunderstood the Nazarene? Might not
  that person by patient waiting be covering silent preparation, and proving
  his fitness for the glorious task before him? How much better this time for
  the movement than that other when, by Gennesaret, the Galileans would have
  forced assumption of the crown? Then the support would have been limited to a
  few thousands; now his proclamation would be responded to by
  millions&mdash;who could say how many? Pursuing this theory to its
  conclusions, Ben-Hur moved amidst brilliant promises, and glowed with the
  thought that the melancholy man, under gentle seeming and wondrous
  self-denial, was in fact carrying in disguise the subtlety of a politician
  and the genius of a soldier.</p>

  <p>Several times also, in the meanwhile, low-set, brawny men, bareheaded and
  black-bearded, came and asked for Ben-Hur at the tent; his interviews with
  them were always apart; and to his mother's question who they were he
  answered,</p>

  <p>"Some good friends of mine from Galilee."</p>

  <p>Through them he kept informed of the movements of the Nazarene, and of the
  schemes of the Nazarene's enemies, Rabbinical and Roman. That the good man's
  life was in danger, he knew; but that there were any bold enough to attempt
  to take it at that time, he could not believe. It seemed too securely
  intrenched in a great fame and an assured popularity. The very vastness of
  the attendance in and about the city brought with it a seeming guaranty of
  safety. And yet, to say truth, Ben-Hur's confidence rested most certainly
  upon the miraculous power of the Christ. Pondering the subject in the purely
  human view, that the master of such authority over life and death, used so
  frequently for the good of others, would not exert it in care of himself was
  simply as much past belief as it was past understanding.</p>

  <p>Nor should it be forgotten that all these were incidents of occurrence
  between the twenty-first day of March&mdash;counting by the modern
  calendar&mdash;and the twenty-fifth. The evening of the latter day Ben-Hur
  yielded to his impatience, and rode to the city, leaving behind him a promise
  to return in the night.</p>

  <p>The horse was fresh, and choosing his own gait, sped swiftly. The eyes of
  the clambering vines winked at the rider from the garden fences on the way;
  there was nothing else to see him, nor child nor woman nor man. Through the
  rocky float in the hollows of the road the agate hoofs drummed, ringing like
  cups of steel; but without notice from any stranger. In the houses passed
  there were no tenants; the fires by the tent-doors were out; the road was
  deserted; for this was the first Passover eve, and the hour "between the
  evenings" when the visiting millions crowded the city, and the slaughter of
  lambs in offering reeked the fore-courts of the Temple, and the priests in
  ordered lines caught the flowing blood and carried it swiftly to the dripping
  altars&mdash;when all was haste and hurry, racing with the stars fast coming
  with the signal after which the roasting and the eating and the singing might
  go on, but not the preparation more.</p>

  <p>Through the great northern gate the rider rode, and lo! Jerusalem before
  the fall, in ripeness of glory, illuminated for the Lord.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch806"
     name="ch806"></a>VI. &mdash; A SERPENT OF THE NILE</h2>

  <p class="first">Ben-Hur alighted at the gate of the khan from which the
  three Wise Men more than thirty years before departed, going down to
  Bethlehem. There, in keeping of his Arab followers, he left the horse, and
  shortly after was at the wicket of his father's house, and in a yet briefer
  space in the great chamber. He called for Malluch first; that worthy being
  out, he sent a salutation to his friends the merchant and the Egyptian. They
  were being carried abroad to see the celebration. The latter, he was
  informed, was very feeble, and in a state of deep dejection.</p>

  <p>Young people of that time who were supposed hardly to know their own
  hearts indulged the habit of politic indirection quite as much as young
  people in the same condition indulge it in this time; so when Ben-Hur
  inquired for the good Balthasar, and with grave courtesy desired to know if
  he would be pleased to see him, he really addressed the daughter a notice of
  his arrival. While the servant was answering for the elder, the curtain of
  the doorway was drawn aside, and the younger Egyptian came in, and
  walked&mdash;or floated, upborne in a white cloud of the gauzy raiment she so
  loved and lived in&mdash;to the centre of the chamber, where the light cast
  by lamps from the seven-armed brazen stick planted upon the floor was the
  strongest. With her there was no fear of light.</p>

  <p>The servant left the two alone.</p>

  <p>In the excitement occasioned by the events of the few days past Ben-Hur
  had scarcely given a thought to the fair Egyptian. If she came to his mind at
  all, it was merely as a briefest pleasure, a suggestion of a delight which
  could wait for him, and was waiting.</p>

  <p>But now the influence of the woman revived with all its force the instant
  Ben-Hur beheld her. He advanced to her eagerly, but stopped and gazed. Such a
  change he had never seen!</p>

  <p>Theretofore she had been a lover studious to win him&mdash;in manner all
  warmth, each glance an admission, each action an avowal. She had showered him
  with incense of flattery. While he was present, she had impressed him with
  her admiration; going away, he carried the impression with him to remain a
  delicious expectancy hastening his return. It was for him the painted eyelids
  drooped lowest over the lustrous almond eyes; for him the love-stories caught
  from the professionals abounding in the streets of Alexandria were repeated
  with emphasis and lavishment of poetry; for him endless exclamations of
  sympathy, and smiles, and little privileges with hand and hair and cheek and
  lips, and songs of the Nile, and displays of jewelry, and subtleties of lace
  in veils and scarfs, and other subtleties not less exquisite in flosses of
  Indian silk. The idea, old as the oldest of peoples, that beauty is the
  reward of the hero had never such realism as she contrived for his pleasure;
  insomuch that he could not doubt he was her hero; she avouched it in a
  thousand artful ways as natural with her as her beauty&mdash;winsome ways
  reserved, it would seem, by the passionate genius of old Egypt for its
  daughters.</p>

  <p>Such the Egyptian had been to Ben-Hur from the night of the boat-ride on
  the lake in the Orchard of Palms. But now!</p>

  <p>Elsewhere in this volume the reader may have observed a term of somewhat
  indefinite meaning used reverently in a sacred connection; we repeat it now
  with a general application. There are few persons who have not a double
  nature, the real and the acquired; the latter a kind of addendum resulting
  from education, which in time often perfects it into a part of the being as
  unquestionable as the first. Leaving the thought to the thoughtful, we
  proceed to say that now the real nature of the Egyptian made itself
  manifest.</p>

  <p>It was not possible for her to have received a stranger with repulsion
  more incisive; yet she was apparently as passionless as a statue, only the
  small head was a little tilted, the nostrils a little drawn, and the sensuous
  lower lip pushed the upper the least bit out of its natural curvature.</p>

  <p>She was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"Your coming is timely, O son of Hur," she said, in a voice sharply
  distinct. "I wish to thank you for hospitality; after to-morrow I may not
  have the opportunity to do so."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur bowed slightly without taking his eyes from her.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of a custom which the dice-players observe with good result
  among themselves," she continued. "When the game is over, they refer to their
  tablets and cast up their accounts; then they libate the gods and put a crown
  upon the happy winner. We have had a game&mdash;it has lasted through many
  days and nights. Why, now that it is at an end, shall not we see to which the
  chaplet belongs?"</p>

  <p>Yet very watchful, Ben-Hur answered, lightly, "A man may not balk a woman
  bent on having her way."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she continued, inclining her head, and permitting the sneer to
  become positive&mdash;"tell me, O prince of Jerusalem, where is he, that son
  of the carpenter of Nazareth, and son not less of God, from whom so lately
  such mighty things were expected?"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand impatiently, and replied, "I am not his keeper."</p>

  <p>The beautiful head sank forward yet lower.</p>

  <p>"Has he broken Rome to pieces?"</p>

  <p>Again, but with anger, Ben-Hur raised his hand in deprecation.</p>

  <p>"Where has he seated his capital?" she proceeded. "Cannot I go see his
  throne and its lions of bronze? And his palace&mdash;he raised the dead; and
  to such a one, what is it to raise a golden house? He has but to stamp his
  foot and say the word, and the house is, pillared like Karnak, and wanting
  nothing."</p>

  <p>There was by this time slight ground left to believe her playing; the
  questions were offensive, and her manner pointed with unfriendliness; seeing
  which, he on his side became more wary, and said, with good humor, "O Egypt,
  let us wait another day, even another week, for him, the lions, and the
  palace."</p>

  <p>She went on without noticing the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"And how is it I see you in that garb? Such is not the habit of governors
  in India or vice-kings elsewhere. I saw the satrap of Teheran once, and he
  wore a turban of silk and a cloak of cloth of gold, and the hilt and scabbard
  of his sword made me dizzy with their splendor of precious stones. I thought
  Osiris had lent him a glory from the sun. I fear you have not entered upon
  your kingdom&mdash;the kingdom I was to share with you."</p>

  <p>"The daughter of my wise guest is kinder than she imagines herself; she is
  teaching me that Isis may kiss a heart without making it better."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur spoke with cold courtesy, and Iras, after playing with the pendent
  solitaire of her necklace of coins, rejoined, "For a Jew, the son of Hur is
  clever. I saw your dreaming Caesar make his entry into Jerusalem. You told us
  he would that day proclaim himself King of the Jews from the steps of the
  Temple. I beheld the procession descend the mountain bringing him. I heard
  their singing. They were beautiful with palms in motion. I looked everywhere
  among them for a figure with a promise of royalty&mdash;a horseman in purple,
  a chariot with a driver in shining brass, a stately warrior behind an orbed
  shield, rivalling his spear in stature. I looked for his guard. It would have
  been pleasant to have seen a prince of Jerusalem and a cohort of the legions
  of Galilee."</p>

  <p>She flung her listener a glance of provoking disdain, then laughed
  heartily, as if the ludicrousness of the picture in her mind were too strong
  for contempt.</p>

  <p>"Instead of a Sesostris returning in triumph or a Caesar helmed and
  sworded&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;I saw a man with a woman's face and hair,
  riding an ass's colt, and in tears. The King! the Son of God! the Redeemer of
  the world! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>In spite of himself, Ben-Hur winced.</p>

  <p>"I did not quit my place, O prince of Jerusalem," she said, before he
  could recover. "I did not laugh. I said to myself, 'Wait. In the Temple he
  will glorify himself as becomes a hero about to take possession of the
  world.' I saw him enter the Gate of Shushan and the Court of the Women. I saw
  him stop and stand before the Gate Beautiful. There were people with me on
  the porch and in the courts, and on the cloisters and on the steps of the
  three sides of the Temple there were other people&mdash;I will say a million
  of people, all waiting breathlessly to hear his proclamation. The pillars
  were not more still than we. Ha, ha, ha! I fancied I heard the axles of the
  mighty Roman machine begin to crack. Ha, ha, ha! O prince, by the soul of
  Solomon, your King of the World drew his gown about him and walked away, and
  out by the farthest gate, nor opened his mouth to say a word; and&mdash;the
  Roman machine is running yet!"</p>

  <p>In simple homage to a hope that instant lost&mdash;a hope which, as it
  began to fall and while it was falling, he unconsciously followed with a
  parting look down to its disappearance&mdash;Ben-Hur lowered his eyes.</p>

  <p>At no previous time, whether when Balthasar was plying him with arguments,
  or when miracles were being done before his face, had the disputed nature of
  the Nazarene been so plainly set before him. The best way, after all, to
  reach an understanding of the divine is by study of the human. In the things
  superior to men we may always look to find God. So with the picture given by
  the Egyptian of the scene when the Nazarene turned from the Gate Beautiful;
  its central theme was an act utterly beyond performance by a man under
  control of merely human inspirations. A parable to a parable-loving people,
  it taught what the Christ had so often asserted&mdash;that his mission was
  not political. There was not much more time for thought of all this than that
  allowed for a common respiration; yet the idea took fast hold of Ben-Hur, and
  in the same instant he followed his hope of vengeance out of sight, and the
  man with the woman's face and hair, and in tears, came near to him&mdash;near
  enough to leave something of his spirit behind.</p>

  <p>"Daughter of Balthasar," he said, with dignity, "if this be the game of
  which you spoke to me, take the chaplet&mdash;I accord it yours. Only let us
  make an end of words. That you have a purpose I am sure. To it, I pray, and I
  will answer you; then let us go our several ways, and forget we ever met. Say
  on; I will listen, but not to more of that which you have given me."</p>

  <p>She regarded him intently a moment, as if determining what to
  do&mdash;possibly she might have been measuring his will&mdash;then she said,
  coldly, "You have my leave&mdash;go."</p>

  <p>"Peace to you," he responded, and walked away.</p>

  <p>As he was about passing out of the door, she called to him.</p>

  <p>"A word."</p>

  <p>He stopped where he was, and looked back.</p>

  <p>"Consider all I know about you."</p>

  <p>"O most fair Egyptian," he said, returning, "what all do you know about
  me?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him absently.</p>

  <p>"You are more of a Roman, son of Hur, then any of your Hebrew
  brethren."</p>

  <p>"Am I so unlike my countrymen?" he asked, indifferently.</p>

  <p>"The demi-gods are all Roman now," she rejoined.</p>

  <p>"And therefore you will tell me what more you know about me?"</p>

  <p>"The likeness is not lost upon me. It might induce me to save you."</p>

  <p>"Save me!"</p>

  <p>The pink-stained fingers toyed daintily with the lustrous pendant at the
  throat, and her voice was exceeding low and soft; only a tapping on the floor
  with her silken sandal admonished him to have a care.</p>

  <p>"There was a Jew, an escaped galley-slave, who killed a man in the Palace
  of Idernee," she began, slowly.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was startled.</p>

  <p>"The same Jew slew a Roman soldier before the Market-place here in
  Jerusalem; the same Jew has three trained legions from Galilee to seize the
  Roman governor to-night; the same Jew has alliances perfected for war upon
  Rome, and Ilderim the Sheik is one of his partners."</p>

  <p>Drawing nearer him, she almost whispered,</p>

  <p>"You have lived in Rome. Suppose these things repeated in ears we know of.
  Ah! you change color."</p>

  <p>He drew back from her with somewhat of the look which may be imagined upon
  the face of a man who, thinking to play with a kitten, has run upon a tiger;
  and she proceeded:</p>

  <p>"You are acquainted in the antechamber, and know the Lord Sejanus. Suppose
  it were told him with the proofs in hand&mdash;or without the
  proofs&mdash;that the same Jew is the richest man in the East&mdash;nay, in
  all the empire. The fishes of the Tiber would have fattening other than that
  they dig out of its ooze, would they not? And while they were
  feeding&mdash;ha! son of Hur!&mdash;what splendor there would be on
  exhibition in the Circus! Amusing the Roman people is a fine art; getting the
  money to keep them amused is another art even finer; and was there ever an
  artist the equal of the Lord Sejanus?"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur was not too much stirred by the evident baseness of the woman for
  recollection. Not unfrequently when all the other faculties are numb and
  failing memory does its offices with the greatest fidelity. The scene at the
  spring on the way to the Jordan reproduced itself; and he remembered thinking
  then that Esther had betrayed him, and thinking so now, he said calmly as he
  could,</p>

  <p>"To give you pleasure, daughter of Egypt, I acknowledge your cunning, and
  that I am at your mercy. It may also please you to hear me acknowledge I have
  no hope of your favor. I could kill you, but you are a woman. The Desert is
  open to receive me; and though Rome is a good hunter of men, there she would
  follow long and far before she caught me, for in its heart there are
  wildernesses of spears as well as wildernesses of sand, and it is not
  unlovely to the unconquered Parthian. In the toils as I am&mdash;dupe that I
  have been&mdash;yet there is one thing my due: who told you all you know
  about me? In flight or captivity, dying even, there will be consolation in
  leaving the traitor the curse of a man who has lived knowing nothing but
  wretchedness. Who told you all you know about me?"</p>

  <p>It might have been a touch of art, or might have been sincere&mdash;that
  as it may&mdash;the expression of the Egyptian's face became sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"There are in my country, O son of Hur," she said, presently, "workmen who
  make pictures by gathering vari-colored shells here and there on the
  sea-shore after storms, and cutting them up, and patching the pieces as
  inlaying on marble slabs. Can you not see the hint there is in the practice
  to such as go searching for secrets? Enough that from this person I gathered
  a handful of little circumstances, and from that other yet another handful,
  and that afterwhile I put them together, and was happy as a woman can be who
  has at disposal the fortune and life of a man whom"&mdash;she stopped, and
  beat the floor with her foot, and looked away as if to hide a sudden emotion
  from him; with an air of even painful resolution she presently finished the
  sentence&mdash;"whom she is at loss what to do with."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not enough," Ben-Hur said, unmoved by the play&mdash;"it is not
  enough. To-morrow you will determine what to do with me. I may die."</p>

  <p>"True," she rejoined quickly and with emphasis, "I had something from
  Sheik Ilderim as he lay with my father in a grove out in the Desert. The
  night was still, very still, and the walls of the tent, sooth to say, were
  poor ward against ears outside listening to&mdash;birds and beetles flying
  through the air."</p>

  <p>She smiled at the conceit, but proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Some other things&mdash;bits of shell for the picture&mdash;I had
  from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whom?"</p>

  <p>"The son of Hur himself."</p>

  <p>"Was there no other who contributed?"</p>

  <p>"No, not one."</p>

  <p>Hur drew a breath of relief, and said, lightly, "Thanks. It were not well
  to keep the Lord Sejanus waiting for you. The Desert is not so sensitive.
  Again, O Egypt, peace!"</p>

  <p>To this time he had been standing uncovered; now he took the handkerchief
  from his arm where it had been hanging, and adjusting it upon his head,
  turned to depart. But she arrested him; in her eagerness, she even reached a
  hand to him.</p>

  <p>"Stay," she said.</p>

  <p>He looked back at her, but without taking the hand, though it was very
  noticeable for its sparkling of jewels; and he knew by her manner that the
  reserved point of the scene which was so surprising to him was now to
  come.</p>

  <p>"Stay, and do not distrust me, O son of Hur, if I declare I know why the
  noble Arrius took you for his heir. And, by Isis! by all the gods of Egypt! I
  swear I tremble to think of you, so brave and generous, under the hand of the
  remorseless minister. You have left a portion of your youth in the atria of
  the great capital; consider, as I do, what the Desert will be to you in
  contrast of life. Oh, I give you pity&mdash;pity! And if you but do what I
  say, I will save you. That, also, I swear, by our holy Isis!"</p>

  <p>Words of entreaty and prayer these, poured forth volubly and with
  earnestness and the mighty sanction of beauty.</p>

  <p>"Almost&mdash;almost I believe you," Ben-Hur said, yet hesitatingly, and
  in a voice low and indistinct; for a doubt remained with him grumbling
  against the yielding tendency of the man&mdash;a good sturdy doubt, such a
  one as has saved many a life and fortune.</p>

  <p>"The perfect life for a woman is to live in love; the greatest happiness
  for a man is the conquest of himself; and that, O prince, is what I have to
  ask of you."</p>

  <p>She spoke rapidly, and with animation; indeed, she had never appeared to
  him so fascinating.</p>

  <p>"You had once a friend," she continued. "It was in your boyhood. There was
  a quarrel, and you and he became enemies. He did you wrong. After many years
  you met him again in the Circus at Antioch."</p>

  <p>"Messala!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Messala. You are his creditor. Forgive the past; admit him to
  friendship again; restore the fortune he lost in the great wager; rescue him.
  The six talents are as nothing to you; not so much as a bud lost upon a tree
  already in full leaf; but to him&mdash; Ah, he must go about with a broken
  body; wherever you meet him he must look up to you from the ground. O
  Ben-Hur, noble prince! to a Roman descended as he is beggary is the other
  most odious name for death. Save him from beggary!"</p>

  <p>If the rapidity with which she spoke was a cunning invention to keep him
  from thinking, either she never knew or else had forgotten that there are
  convictions which derive nothing from thought, but drop into place without
  leave or notice. It seemed to him, when at last she paused to have his
  answer, that he could see Messala himself peering at him over her shoulder;
  and in its expression the countenance of the Roman was not that of a
  mendicant or a friend; the sneer was as patrician as ever, and the fine edge
  of the hauteur as flawless and irritating.</p>

  <p>"The appeal has been decided then, and for once a Messala takes nothing. I
  must go and write it in my book of great occurrences&mdash;a judgment by a
  Roman against a Roman! But did he&mdash;did Messala send you to me with this
  request, O Egypt?"</p>

  <p>"He has a noble nature, and judged you by it."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur took the hand upon arm.</p>

  <p>"As you know him in such friendly way, fair Egyptian, tell me, would he do
  for me, there being a reversal of the conditions, that he asks of me? Answer,
  by Isis! Answer, for the truth's sake!"</p>

  <p>There was insistence in the touch of his hand, and in his look also.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she began, "he is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A Roman, you were about to say; meaning that I, a Jew, must not determine
  dues from me to him by any measure of dues from him to me; being a Jew, I
  must forgive him my winnings because he is a Roman. If you have more to tell
  me, daughter of Balthasar, speak quickly, quickly; for by the Lord God of
  Israel, when this heat of blood, hotter waxing, attains its highest, I may
  not be able longer to see that you are a woman, and beautiful! I may see but
  the spy of a master the more hateful because the master is a Roman. Say on,
  and quickly."</p>

  <p>She threw his hand off and stepped back into the full light, with all the
  evil of her nature collected in her eyes and voice.</p>

  <p>"Thou drinker of lees, feeder upon husks! To think I could love thee,
  having seen Messala! Such as thou were born to serve him. He would have been
  satisfied with release of the six talents; but I say to the six thou shalt
  add twenty&mdash;twenty, dost thou hear? The kissings of my little finger
  which thou hast taken from him, though with my consent, shall be paid for;
  and that I have followed thee with affection of sympathy, and endured thee so
  long, enter into the account not less because I was serving him. The merchant
  here is thy keeper of moneys. If by to-morrow at noon he has not thy order
  acted upon in favor of my Messala for six-and-twenty talents&mdash;mark the
  sum!&mdash;thou shalt settle with the Lord Sejanus. Be wise
  and&mdash;farewell."</p>

  <p>As she was going to the door, he put himself in her way.</p>

  <p>"The old Egypt lives in you," he said. "Whether you see Messala to-morrow
  or the next day, here or in Rome, give him this message. Tell him I have back
  the money, even the six talents, he robbed me of by robbing my father's
  estate; tell him I survived the galleys to which he had me sent, and in my
  strength rejoice in his beggary and dishonor; tell him I think the affliction
  of body which he has from my hand is the curse of our Lord God of Israel upon
  him more fit than death for his crimes against the helpless; tell him my
  mother and sister whom he had sent to a cell in Antonia that they might die
  of leprosy, are alive and well, thanks to the power of the Nazarene whom you
  so despise; tell him that, to fill my measure of happiness, they are restored
  to me, and that I will go hence to their love, and find in it more than
  compensation for the impure passions which you leave me to take to him; tell
  him&mdash;this for your comfort, O cunning incarnate, as much as
  his&mdash;tell him that when the Lord Sejanus comes to despoil me he will
  find nothing; for the inheritance I had from the duumvir, including the villa
  by Misenum, has been sold, and the money from the sale is out of reach,
  afloat in the marts of the world as bills of exchange; and that this house
  and the goods and merchandise and the ships and caravans with which Simonides
  plies his commerce with such princely profits are covered by imperial
  safeguards&mdash;a wise head having found the price of the favor, and the
  Lord Sejanus preferring a reasonable gain in the way of gift to much gain
  fished from pools of blood and wrong; tell him if all this were not so, if
  the money and property were all mine, yet should he not have the least part
  of it, for when he finds our Jewish bills, and forces them to give up their
  values, there is yet another resort left me&mdash;a deed of gift to
  Caesar&mdash;so much, O Egypt, I found out in the atria of the great capital;
  tell him that along with my defiance I do not send him a curse in words, but,
  as a better expression of my undying hate, I send him one who will prove to
  him the sum of all curses; and when he looks at you repeating this my
  message, daughter of Balthasar, his Roman shrewdness will tell him all I
  mean. Go now&mdash;and I will go."</p>

  <p>He conducted her to the door, and, with ceremonious politeness, held back
  the curtain while she passed out.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you," he said, as she disappeared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch807"
     name="ch807"></a>VII. &mdash; BEN-HUR RETURNS TO ESTHER</h2>

  <p class="first">When Ben-Hur left the guest-chamber, there was not nearly so
  much life in his action as when he entered it; his steps were slower, and he
  went along with his head quite upon his breast. Having made discovery that a
  man with a broken back may yet have a sound brain, he was reflecting upon the
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Forasmuch as it is easy after a calamity has befallen to look back and see
  the proofs of its coming strewn along the way, the thought that he had not
  even suspected the Egyptian as in Messala's interest, but had gone blindly on
  through whole years putting himself and his friends more and more at her
  mercy, was a sore wound to the young man's vanity. "I remember," he said to
  himself, "she had no word of indignation for the perfidious Roman at the
  Fountain of Castalia! I remember she extolled him at the boat-ride on the
  lake in the Orchard of Palms! And, ah!"&mdash;he stopped, and beat his left
  hand violently with his right&mdash;"ah! that mystery about the appointment
  she made with me at the Palace of Idernee is no mystery now!"</p>

  <p>The wound, it should be observed, was to his vanity; and fortunately it is
  not often that people die of such hurts, or even continue a long time sick.
  In Ben-Hur's case, moreover, there was a compensation; for presently he
  exclaimed aloud, "Praised be the Lord God that the woman took not a more
  lasting hold on me! I see I did not love her."</p>

  <p>Then, as if he had already parted with not a little of the weight on his
  mind, he stepped forward more lightly; and, coming to the place on the
  terrace where one stairway led down to the court-yard below, and another
  ascended to the roof, he took the latter and began to climb. As he made the
  last step in the flight he stopped again.</p>

  <p>"Can Balthasar have been her partner in the long mask she has been
  playing? No, no. Hypocrisy seldom goes with wrinkled age like that. Balthasar
  is a good man."</p>

  <p>With this decided opinion he stepped upon the roof. There was a full moon
  overhead, yet the vault of the sky at the moment was lurid with light cast up
  from the fires burning in the streets and open places of the city, and the
  chanting and chorusing of the old psalmody of Israel filled it with plaintive
  harmonies to which he could not but listen. The countless voices bearing the
  burden seemed to say, "Thus, O son of Judah, we prove our worshipfulness of
  the Lord God, and our loyalty to the land he gave us. Let a Gideon appear, or
  a David, or a Maccabaeus, and we are ready."</p>

  <p>That seemed an introduction; for next he saw the man of Nazareth.</p>

  <p>In certain moods the mind is disposed to mock itself with inapposite
  fancies.</p>

  <p>The tearful woman-like face of the Christ stayed with him while he crossed
  the roof to the parapet above the street on the north side of the house, and
  there was in it no sign of war; but rather as the heavens of calm evenings
  look peace upon everything, so it looked, provoking the old question, What
  manner of man is he?</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur permitted himself one glance over the parapet, then turned and
  walked mechanically towards the summer-house.</p>

  <p>"Let them do their worst," he said, as he went slowly on. "I will not
  forgive the Roman. I will not divide my fortune with him, nor will I fly from
  this city of my fathers. I will call on Galilee first, and here make the
  fight. By brave deeds I will bring the tribes to our side. He who raised up
  Moses will find us a leader, if I fail. If not the Nazarene, then some other
  of the many ready to die for freedom."</p>

  <p>The interior of the summer-house, when Ben-Hur, slow sauntering, came to
  it, was murkily lighted. The faintest of shadows lay along the floor from the
  pillars on the north and west sides. Looking in, he saw the arm-chair usually
  occupied by Simonides drawn to a spot from which a view of the city over
  towards the Market-place could be best had.</p>

  <p>"The good man is returned. I will speak with him, unless he be
  asleep."</p>

  <p>He walked in, and with a quiet step approached the chair. Peering over the
  high back, he beheld Esther nestled in the seat asleep&mdash;a small figure
  snugged away under her father's lap-robe. The hair dishevelled fell over her
  face. Her breathing was low and irregular. Once it was broken by a long sigh,
  ending in a sob. Something&mdash;it might have been the sigh or the
  loneliness in which he found her&mdash;imparted to him the idea that the
  sleep was a rest from sorrow rather than fatigue. Nature kindly sends such
  relief to children, and he was used to thinking Esther scarcely more than a
  child. He put his arms upon the back of the chair, and thought.</p>

  <p>"I will not wake her. I have nothing to tell her&mdash;nothing
  unless&mdash;unless it be my love.... She is a daughter of Judah, and
  beautiful, and so unlike the Egyptian; for there it is all vanity, here all
  truth; there ambition, here duty; there selfishness, here self-sacrifice....
  Nay, the question is not do I love her, but does she love me? She was my
  friend from the beginning. The night on the terrace at Antioch, how
  child-like she begged me not to make Rome my enemy, and had me tell her of
  the villa by Misenum, and of the life there! That she should not see I saw
  her cunning drift I kissed her. Can she have forgotten the kiss! I have not.
  I love her.... They do not know in the city that I have back my people. I
  shrank from telling it to the Egyptian; but this little one will rejoice with
  me over their restoration, and welcome them with love and sweet services of
  hand and heart. She will be to my mother another daughter; in Tirzah she will
  find her other self. I would wake her and tell her these things,
  but&mdash;out on the sorceress of Egypt! Of that folly I could not command
  myself to speak. I will go away, and wait another and a better time. I will
  wait. Fair Esther, dutiful child, daughter of Judah!"</p>

  <p>He retired silently as he came.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch808"
     name="ch808"></a>VIII. &mdash; GETHSEMANE&mdash;"WHOM SEEK YE?"</h2>

  <p class="first">The streets were full of people going and coming, or grouped
  about the fires roasting meat, and feasting and singing, and happy. The odor
  of scorching flesh mixed with the odor of cedar-wood aflame and smoking
  loaded the air; and as this was the occasion when every son of Israel was
  full brother to every other son of Israel, and hospitality was without
  bounds, Ben-Hur was saluted at every step, while the groups by the fires
  insisted, "Stay and partake with us. We are brethren in the love of the
  Lord." But with thanks to them he hurried on, intending to take horse at the
  khan and return to the tents on the Cedron.</p>

  <p>To make the place, it was necessary for him to cross the thoroughfare so
  soon to receive sorrowful Christian perpetuation. There also the pious
  celebration was at its height. Looking up the street, he noticed the flames
  of torches in motion streaming out like pennons; then he observed that the
  singing ceased where the torches came. His wonder rose to its highest,
  however, when he became certain that amidst the smoke and dancing sparks he
  saw the keener sparkling of burnished spear-tips, arguing the presence of
  Roman soldiers. What were they, the scoffing legionaries, doing in a Jewish
  religious procession? The circumstance was unheard of, and he stayed to see
  the meaning of it.</p>

  <p>The moon was shining its best; yet, as if the moon and the torches, and
  the fires in the street, and the rays streaming from windows and open doors
  were not enough to make the way clear, some of the processionists carried
  lighted lanterns; and fancying he discovered a special purpose in the use of
  such equipments, Ben-Hur stepped into the street so close to the line of
  march as to bring every one of the company under view while passing. The
  torches and the lanterns were being borne by servants, each of whom was armed
  with a bludgeon or a sharpened stave. Their present duty seemed to be to pick
  out the smoothest paths among the rocks in the street for certain dignitaries
  among them&mdash;elders and priests; rabbis with long beards, heavy brows,
  and beaked noses; men of the class potential in the councils of Caiaphas and
  Hannas. Where could they be going? Not to the Temple, certainly, for the
  route to the sacred house from Zion, whence these appeared to be coming, was
  by the Xystus. And their business&mdash;if peaceful, why the soldiers?</p>

  <p>As the procession began to go by Ben-Hur, his attention was particularly
  called to three persons walking together. They were well towards the front,
  and the servants who went before them with lanterns appeared unusually
  careful in the service. In the person moving on the left of this group he
  recognized a chief policeman of the Temple; the one on the right was a
  priest; the middle man was not at first so easily placed, as he walked
  leaning heavily upon the arms of the others, and carried his head so low upon
  his breast as to hide his face. His appearance was that of a prisoner not yet
  recovered from the fright of arrest, or being taken to something
  dreadful&mdash;to torture or death. The dignitaries helping him on the right
  and left, and the attention they gave him, made it clear that if he were not
  himself the object moving the party, he was at least in some way connected
  with the object&mdash;a witness or a guide, possibly an informer. So if it
  could be found who he was the business in hand might be shrewdly guessed.
  With great assurance, Ben-Hur fell in on the right of the priest, and walked
  along with him. Now if the man would lift his head! And presently he did so,
  letting the light of the lanterns strike full in his face, pale, dazed,
  pinched with dread; the beard roughed; the eyes filmy, sunken, and
  despairing. In much going about following the Nazarene, Ben-Hur had come to
  know his disciples as well as the Master; and now, at sight of the dismal
  countenance, he cried out,</p>

  <p>"The 'Scariot!"</p>

  <p>Slowly the head of the man turned until his eyes settled upon Ben-Hur, and
  his lips moved as if he were about to speak; but the priest interfered.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou? Begone!" he said to Ben-Hur, pushing him away.</p>

  <p>The young man took the push good-naturedly, and, waiting an opportunity,
  fell into the procession again. Thus he was carried passively along down the
  street, through the crowded lowlands between the hill Bezetha and the Castle
  of Antonia, and on by the Bethesda reservoir to the Sheep Gate. There were
  people everywhere, and everywhere the people were engaged in sacred
  observances.</p>

  <p>It being Passover night, the valves of the Gate stood open. The keepers
  were off somewhere feasting. In front of the procession as it passed out
  unchallenged was the deep gorge of the Cedron, with Olivet beyond, its
  dressing of cedar and olive trees darker of the moonlight silvering all the
  heavens. Two roads met and merged into the street at the gate&mdash;one from
  the northeast, the other from Bethany. Ere Ben-Hur could finish wondering
  whether he were to go farther, and if so, which road was to be taken, he was
  led off down into the gorge. And still no hint of the purpose of the midnight
  march.</p>

  <p>Down the gorge and over the bridge at the bottom of it. There was a great
  clatter on the floor as the crowd, now a straggling rabble, passed over
  beating and pounding with their clubs and staves. A little farther, and they
  turned off to the left in the direction of an olive orchard enclosed by a
  stone wall in view from the road. Ben-Hur knew there was nothing in the place
  but old gnarled trees, the grass, and a trough hewn out of a rock for the
  treading of oil after the fashion of the country. While, yet more
  wonder-struck, he was thinking what could bring such a company at such an
  hour to a quarter so lonesome, they were all brought to a standstill. Voices
  called out excitedly in front; a chill sensation ran from man to man; there
  was a rapid falling-back, and a blind stumbling over each other. The soldiers
  alone kept their order.</p>

  <p>It took Ben-Hur but a moment to disengage himself from the mob and run
  forward. There he found a gateway without a gate admitting to the orchard,
  and he halted to take in the scene.</p>

  <p>A man in white clothes, and bareheaded, was standing outside the entrance,
  his hands crossed before him&mdash;a slender, stooping figure, with long hair
  and thin face&mdash;in an attitude of resignation and waiting.</p>

  <p>It was the Nazarene!</p>

  <p>Behind him, next the gateway, were the disciples in a group; they were
  excited, but no man was ever calmer than he. The torchlight beat redly upon
  him, giving his hair a tint ruddier than was natural to it; yet the
  expression of the countenance was as usual all gentleness and pity.</p>

  <p>Opposite this most unmartial figure stood the rabble, gaping, silent,
  awed, cowering&mdash;ready at a sign of anger from him to break and run. And
  from him to them&mdash;then at Judas, conspicuous in their
  midst&mdash;Ben-Hur looked&mdash;one quick glance, and the object of the
  visit lay open to his understanding. Here was the betrayer, there the
  betrayed; and these with clubs and staves, and the legionaries, were brought
  to take him.</p>

  <p>A man may not always tell what he will do until the trial is upon him.
  This was the emergency for which Ben-Hur had been for years preparing. The
  man to whose security he had devoted himself, and upon whose life he had been
  building so largely, was in personal peril; yet he stood still. Such
  contradictions are there in human nature! To say truth, O reader, he was not
  entirely recovered from the picture of the Christ before the Gate Beautiful
  as it had been given by the Egyptian; and, besides that, the very calmness
  with which the mysterious person confronted the mob held him in restraint by
  suggesting the possession of a power in reserve more than sufficient for the
  peril. Peace and good-will, and love and non-resistance, had been the burden
  of the Nazarene's teaching; would he put his preaching into practice? He was
  master of life; he could restore it when lost; he could take it at pleasure.
  What use would he make of the power now? Defend himself? And how? A
  word&mdash;a breath&mdash;a thought were sufficient. That there would be some
  signal exhibition of astonishing force beyond the natural Ben-Hur believed,
  and in that faith waited. And in all this he was still measuring the Nazarene
  by himself&mdash;by the human standard.</p>

  <p>Presently the clear voice of the Christ arose.</p>

  <p>"Whom seek ye?"</p>

  <p>"Jesus of Nazareth," the priest replied.</p>

  <p>"I am he."</p>

  <p>At these simplest of words, spoken without passion or alarm, the
  assailants fell back several steps, the timid among them cowering to the
  ground; and they might have let him alone and gone away had not Judas walked
  over to him.</p>

  <p>"Hail, master!"</p>

  <p>With this friendly speech, he kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Judas," said the Nazarene, mildly, "betrayest thou the Son of man with a
  kiss? Wherefore art thou come?"</p>

  <p>Receiving no reply, the Master spoke to the crowd again.</p>

  <p>"Whom seek ye?"</p>

  <p>"Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

  <p>"I have told you that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let these go
  their way."</p>

  <p>At these words of entreaty the rabbis advanced upon him; and, seeing their
  intent, some of the disciples for whom he interceded drew nearer; one of them
  cut off a man's ear, but without saving the Master from being taken. And yet
  Ben-Hur stood still! Nay, while the officers were making ready with their
  ropes the Nazarene was doing his greatest charity&mdash;not the greatest in
  deed, but the very greatest in illustration of his forbearance, so far
  surpassing that of men.</p>

  <p>"Suffer ye thus far," he said to the wounded man, and healed him with a
  touch.</p>

  <p>Both friends and enemies were confounded&mdash;one side that he could do
  such a thing, the other that he would do it under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Surely he will not allow them to bind him!"</p>

  <p>Thus thought Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup which my Father hath given me,
  shall I not drink it?" From the offending follower, the Nazarene turned to
  his captors. "Are you come out as against a thief, with swords and staves to
  take me? I was daily with you in the Temple, and you took me not; but this is
  your hour, and the power of darkness."</p>

  <p>The posse plucked up courage and closed about him; and when Ben-Hur looked
  for the faithful they were gone&mdash;not one of them remained.</p>

  <p>The crowd about the deserted man seemed very busy with tongue, hand, and
  foot. Over their heads, between the torch-sticks, through the smoke,
  sometimes in openings between the restless men, Ben-Hur caught momentary
  glimpses of the prisoner. Never had anything struck him as so piteous, so
  unfriended, so forsaken! Yet, he thought, the man could have defended
  himself&mdash;he could have slain his enemies with a breath, but he would
  not. What was the cup his father had given him to drink? And who was the
  father to be so obeyed? Mystery upon mystery&mdash;not one, but many.</p>

  <p>Directly the mob started in return to the city, the soldiers in the lead.
  Ben-Hur became anxious; he was not satisfied with himself. Where the torches
  were in the midst of the rabble he knew the Nazarene was to be found.
  Suddenly he resolved to see him again. He would ask him one question.</p>

  <p>Taking off his long outer garment and the handkerchief from his head, he
  threw them upon the orchard wall, and started after the posse, which he
  boldly joined. Through the stragglers he made way, and by littles at length
  reached the man who carried the ends of the rope with which the prisoner was
  bound.</p>

  <p>The Nazarene was walking slowly, his head down, his hands bound behind
  him; the hair fell thickly over his face, and he stooped more than usual;
  apparently he was oblivious to all going on around him. In advance a few
  steps were priests and elders talking and occasionally looking back. When, at
  length, they were all near the bridge in the gorge, Ben-Hur took the rope
  from the servant who had it, and stepped past him.</p>

  <p>"Master, master!" he said, hurriedly, speaking close to the Nazarene's
  ear. "Dost thou hear, master? A word&mdash;one word. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The fellow from whom he had taken the rope now claimed it.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Ben-Hur continued, "goest thou with these of thine own
  accord?"</p>

  <p>The people were come up now, and in his own ears asking angrily, "Who art
  thou, man?"</p>

  <p>"O master," Ben-Hur made haste to say, his voice sharp with anxiety, "I am
  thy friend and lover. Tell me, I pray thee, if I bring rescue, wilt thou
  accept it?"</p>

  <p>The Nazarene never so much as looked up or allowed the slightest sign of
  recognition; yet the something which when we are suffering is always telling
  it to such as look at us, though they be strangers, failed not now. "Let him
  alone," it seemed to say; "he has been abandoned by his friends; the world
  has denied him; in bitterness of spirit, he has taken farewell of men; he is
  going he knows not where, and he cares not. Let him alone."</p>

  <p>And to that Ben-Hur was now driven. A dozen hands were upon him, and from
  all sides there was shouting, "He is one of them. Bring him along; club
  him&mdash;kill him!"</p>

  <p>With a gust of passion which gave him many times his ordinary force,
  Ben-Hur raised himself, turned once about with arms outstretched, shook the
  hands off, and rushed through the circle which was fast hemming him in. The
  hands snatching at him as he passed tore his garments from his back, so he
  ran off the road naked; and the gorge, in keeping of the friendly darkness,
  darker there than elsewhere, received him safe.</p>

  <p>Reclaiming his handkerchief and outer garments from the orchard wall, he
  followed back to the city gate; thence he went to the khan, and on the good
  horse rode to the tents of his people out by the Tombs of the Kings.</p>

  <p>As he rode, he promised himself to see the Nazarene on the
  morrow&mdash;promised it, not knowing that the unfriended man was taken
  straightway to the house of Hannas to be tried that night.</p>

  <p>The heart the young man carried to his couch beat so heavily he could not
  sleep; for now clearly his renewed Judean kingdom resolved itself into what
  it was&mdash;only a dream. It is bad enough to see our castles overthrown one
  after another with an interval between in which to recover from the shock, or
  at least let the echoes of the fall die away; but when they go
  altogether&mdash;go as ships sink, as houses tumble in earthquakes&mdash;the
  spirits which endure it calmly are made of stuffs sterner than common, and
  Ben-Hur's was not of them. Through vistas in the future, he began to catch
  glimpses of a life serenely beautiful, with a home instead of a palace of
  state, and Esther its mistress. Again and again through the leaden-footed
  hours of the night he saw the villa by Misenum, and with his little
  countrywoman strolled through the garden, and rested in the panelled atrium;
  overhead the Neapolitan sky, at their feet the sunniest of sun-lands and the
  bluest of bays.</p>

  <p>In plainest speech, he was entering upon a crisis with which to-morrow and
  the Nazarene will have everything to do.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch809"
     name="ch809"></a>IX. &mdash; THE GOING TO CALVARY</h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning, about the second hour, two men rode full speed
  to the doors of Ben-Hur's tents, and dismounting, asked to see him. He was
  not yet risen, but gave directions for their admission.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, brethren," he said, for they were of his Galileans, and
  trusted officers. "Will you be seated?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," the senior replied, bluntly, "to sit and be at ease is to let the
  Nazarene die. Rise, son of Judah, and go with us. The judgment has been
  given. The tree of the cross is already at Golgotha."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur stared at them.</p>

  <p>"The cross!" was all he could for the moment say.</p>

  <p>"They took him last night, and tried him," the man continued. "At dawn
  they led him before Pilate. Twice the Roman denied his guilt; twice he
  refused to give him over. At last he washed his hands, and said, 'Be it upon
  you then;' and they answered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who answered?"</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;the priests and people&mdash;'His blood be upon us and our
  children.'"</p>

  <p>"Holy father Abraham!" cried Ben-Hur; "a Roman kinder to an Israelite than
  his own kin! And if&mdash;ah, if he should indeed be the son of God, what
  shall ever wash his blood from their children? It must not be&mdash;'tis time
  to fight!"</p>

  <p>His face brightened with resolution, and he clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>"The horses&mdash;and quickly!" he said to the Arab who answered the
  signal. "And bid Amrah send me fresh garments, and bring my sword! It is time
  to die for Israel, my friends. Tarry without till I come."</p>

  <p>He ate a crust, drank a cup of wine, and was soon upon the road.</p>

  <p>"Whither would you go first?" asked the Galilean.</p>

  <p>"To collect the legions."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" the man replied, throwing up his hands.</p>

  <p>"Why alas?"</p>

  <p>"Master"&mdash;the man spoke with shame&mdash;"master, I and my friend
  here are all that are faithful. The rest do follow the priests."</p>

  <p>"Seeking what?" and Ben-Hur drew rein.</p>

  <p>"To kill him."</p>

  <p>"Not the Nazarene?"</p>

  <p>"You have said it."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur looked slowly from one man to the other. He was hearing again the
  question of the night before: "The cup my Father hath given me, shall I not
  drink it?" In the ear of the Nazarene he was putting his own question, "If I
  bring thee rescue, wilt thou accept it?" He was saying to himself, "This
  death may not be averted. The man has been travelling towards it with full
  knowledge from the day he began his mission: it is imposed by a will higher
  than his; whose but the Lord's! If he is consenting, if he goes to it
  voluntarily, what shall another do?" Nor less did Ben-Hur see the failure of
  the scheme he had built upon the fidelity of the Galileans; their desertion,
  in fact, left nothing more of it. But how singular it should happen that
  morning of all others! A dread seized him. It was possible his scheming, and
  labor, and expenditure of treasure might have been but blasphemous contention
  with God. When he picked up the reins and said, "Let us go, brethren," all
  before him was uncertainty. The faculty of resolving quickly, without which
  one cannot be a hero in the midst of stirring scenes, was numb within
  him.</p>

  <p>"Let us go, brethren; let us to Golgotha."</p>

  <p>They passed through excited crowds of people going south, like themselves.
  All the country north of the city seemed aroused and in motion.</p>

  <p>Hearing that the procession with the condemned might be met with somewhere
  near the great white towers left by Herod, the three friends rode thither,
  passing round southeast of Akra. In the valley below the Pool of Hezekiah,
  passage-way against the multitude became impossible, and they were compelled
  to dismount, and take shelter behind the corner of a house and wait.</p>

  <p>The waiting was as if they were on a river bank, watching a flood go by,
  for such the people seemed.</p>

  <p>There are certain chapters in the First Book of this story which were
  written to give the reader an idea of the composition of the Jewish
  nationality as it was in the time of Christ. They were also written in
  anticipation of this hour and scene; so that he who has read them with
  attention can now see all Ben-Hur saw of the going to the crucifixion&mdash;a
  rare and wonderful sight!</p>

  <p>Half an hour&mdash;an hour&mdash;the flood surged by Ben-Hur and his
  companions, within arm's reach, incessant, undiminished. At the end of that
  time he could have said, "I have seen all the castes of Jerusalem, all the
  sects of Judea, all the tribes of Israel, and all the nationalities of earth
  represented by them." The Libyan Jew went by, and the Jew of Egypt, and the
  Jew from the Rhine; in short, Jews from all East countries and all West
  countries, and all islands within commercial connection; they went by on
  foot, on horseback, on camels, in litters and chariots, and with an infinite
  variety of costumes, yet with the same marvellous similitude of features
  which to-day particularizes the children of Israel, tried as they have been
  by climates and modes of life; they went by speaking all known tongues, for
  by that means only were they distinguishable group from group; they went by
  in haste&mdash;eager, anxious, crowding&mdash;all to behold one poor Nazarene
  die, a felon between felons.</p>

  <p>These were the many, but they were not all.</p>

  <p>Borne along with the stream were thousands not Jews&mdash;thousands hating
  and despising them&mdash;Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Syrians, Africans, Egyptians,
  Easterns. So that, studying the mass, it seemed the whole world was to be
  represented, and, in that sense, present at the crucifixion.</p>

  <p>The going was singularly quiet. A hoof-stroke upon a rock, the glide and
  rattle of revolving wheels, voices in conversation, and now and then a
  calling voice, were all the sounds heard above the rustle of the mighty
  movement. Yet was there upon every countenance the look with which men make
  haste to see some dreadful sight, some sudden wreck, or ruin, or calamity of
  war. And by such signs Ben-Hur judged that these were the strangers in the
  city come up to the Passover, who had had no part in the trial of the
  Nazarene, and might be his friends.</p>

  <p>At length, from the direction of the great towers, Ben-Hur heard, at first
  faint in the distance, a shouting of many men.</p>

  <p>"Hark! they are coming now," said one of his friends.</p>

  <p>The people in the street halted to hear; but as the cry rang on over their
  heads, they looked at each other, and in shuddering silence moved along.</p>

  <p>The shouting drew nearer each moment; and the air was already full of it
  and trembling, when Ben-Hur saw the servants of Simonides coming with their
  master in his chair, and Esther walking by his side; a covered litter was
  next behind them.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, O Simonides&mdash;and to you, Esther," said Ben-Hur,
  meeting them. "If you are for Golgotha, stay until the procession passes; I
  will then go with you. There is room to turn in by the house here."</p>

  <p>The merchant's large head rested heavily upon his breast; rousing himself,
  he answered, "Speak to Balthasar; his pleasure will be mine. He is in the
  litter."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur hastened to draw aside the curtain. The Egyptian was lying within,
  his wan face so pinched as to appear like a dead man's. The proposal was
  submitted to him.</p>

  <p>"Can we see him?" he inquired, faintly.</p>

  <p>"The Nazarene? yes; he must pass within a few feet of us."</p>

  <p>"Dear Lord!" the old man cried, fervently. "Once more, once more! Oh, it
  is a dreadful day for the world!"</p>

  <p>Shortly the whole party were in waiting under shelter of the house. They
  said but little, afraid, probably, to trust their thoughts to each other;
  everything was uncertain, and nothing so much so as opinions. Balthasar drew
  himself feebly from the litter, and stood supported by a servant; Esther and
  Ben-Hur kept Simonides company.</p>

  <p>Meantime the flood poured along, if anything, more densely than before;
  and the shouting came nearer, shrill up in the air, hoarse along the earth,
  and cruel. At last the procession was up.</p>

  <p>"See!" said Ben-Hur, bitterly; "that which cometh now is Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>The advance was in possession of an army of boys, hooting and screaming,
  "The King of the Jews! Room, room for the King of the Jews!"</p>

  <p>Simonides watched them as they whirled and danced along, like a cloud of
  summer insects, and said, gravely, "When these come to their inheritance, son
  of Hur, alas for the city of Solomon!"</p>

  <p>A band of legionaries fully armed followed next, marching in sturdy
  indifference, the glory of burnished brass about them the while.</p>

  <p>Then came the NAZARENE!</p>

  <p>He was nearly dead. Every few steps he staggered as if he would fall. A
  stained gown badly torn hung from his shoulders over a seamless undertunic.
  His bare feet left red splotches upon the stones. An inscription on a board
  was tied to his neck. A crown of thorns had been crushed hard down upon his
  head, making cruel wounds from which streams of blood, now dry and blackened,
  had run over his face and neck. The long hair, tangled in the thorns, was
  clotted thick. The skin, where it could be seen, was ghastly white. His hands
  were tied before him. Back somewhere in the city he had fallen exhausted
  under the transverse beam of his cross, which, as a condemned person, custom
  required him to bear to the place of execution; now a countryman carried the
  burden in his stead. Four soldiers went with him as a guard against the mob,
  who sometimes, nevertheless, broke through, and struck him with sticks, and
  spit upon him. Yet no sound escaped him, neither remonstrance nor groan; nor
  did he look up until he was nearly in front of the house sheltering Ben-Hur
  and his friends, all of whom were moved with quick compassion. Esther clung
  to her father; and he, strong of will as he was, trembled. Balthasar fell
  down speechless. Even Ben-Hur cried out, "O my God! my God!" Then, as if he
  divined their feelings or heard the exclamation, the Nazarene turned his wan
  face towards the party, and looked at them each one, so they carried the look
  in memory through life. They could see he was thinking of them, not himself,
  and the dying eyes gave them the blessing he was not permitted to speak.</p>

  <p>"Where are thy legions, son of Hur?" asked Simonides, aroused.</p>

  <p>"Hannas can tell thee better than I."</p>

  <p>"What, faithless?"</p>

  <p>"All but these two."</p>

  <p>"Then all is lost, and this good man must die!"</p>

  <p>The face of the merchant knit convulsively as he spoke, and his head sank
  upon his breast. He had borne his part in Ben-Hur's labors well, and he had
  been inspired by the same hopes, now blown out never to be rekindled.</p>

  <p>Two other men succeeded the Nazarene bearing cross-beams.</p>

  <p>"Who are these?" Ben-Hur asked of the Galileans.</p>

  <p>"Thieves appointed to die with the Nazarene," they replied.</p>

  <p>Next in the procession stalked a mitred figure clad all in the golden
  vestments of the high-priest. Policemen from the Temple curtained him round
  about; and after him, in order, strode the sanhedrim, and a long array of
  priests, the latter in their plain white garments, overwrapped by abnets of
  many folds and gorgeous colors.</p>

  <p>"The son-in-law of Hannas," said Ben-Hur, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Caiaphas! I have seen him," Simonides replied, adding, after a pause
  during which he thoughtfully watched the haughty pontiff, "And now am I
  convinced. With such assurance as proceeds from clear enlightenment of the
  spirit&mdash;with absolute assurance&mdash;now know I that he who first goes
  yonder with the inscription about his neck is what the inscription proclaims
  him&mdash;KING OF THE JEWS. A common man, an impostor, a felon, was never
  thus waited upon. For look! Here are the nations&mdash;Jerusalem, Israel.
  Here is the ephod, here the blue robe with its fringe, and purple
  pomegranates, and golden bells, not seen in the street since the day Jaddua
  went out to meet the Macedonian&mdash;proofs all that this Nazarene is King.
  Would I could rise and go after him!"</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur listened surprised; and directly, as if himself awakening to his
  unusual display of feeling, Simonides said, impatiently,</p>

  <p>"Speak to Balthasar, I pray you, and let us begone. The vomit of Jerusalem
  is coming."</p>

  <p>Then Esther spoke.</p>

  <p>"I see some women there, and they are weeping. Who are they?"</p>

  <p>Following the pointing of her hand, the party beheld four women in tears;
  one of them leaned upon the arm of a man of aspect not unlike the Nazarene's.
  Presently Ben-Hur answered,</p>

  <p>"The man is the disciple whom the Nazarene loves the best of all; she who
  leans upon his arm is Mary, the Master's mother; the others are friendly
  women of Galilee."</p>

  <p>Esther pursued the mourners with glistening eyes until the multitude
  received them out of sight.</p>

  <p>It may be the reader will fancy the foregoing snatches of conversation
  were had in quiet; but it was not so. The talking was, for the most part,
  like that indulged by people at the seaside under the sound of the surf; for
  to nothing else can the clamor of this division of the mob be so well
  likened.</p>

  <p>The demonstration was the forerunner of those in which, scarce thirty
  years later, under rule of the factions, the Holy City was torn to pieces; it
  was quite as great in numbers, as fanatical and bloodthirsty; boiled and
  raved, and had in it exactly the same elements&mdash;servants, camel-drivers,
  marketmen, gate-keepers, gardeners, dealers in fruits and wines, proselytes,
  and foreigners not proselytes, watchmen and menials from the Temple, thieves,
  robbers, and the myriad not assignable to any class, but who, on such
  occasions as this, appeared no one could say whence, hungry and smelling of
  caves and old tombs&mdash;bareheaded wretches with naked arms and legs, hair
  and beard in uncombed mats, and each with one garment the color of clay;
  beasts with abysmal mouths, in outcry effective as lions calling each other
  across desert spaces. Some of them had swords; a greater number flourished
  spears and javelins; though the weapons of the many were staves and knotted
  clubs, and slings, for which latter selected stones were stored in scrips,
  and sometimes in sacks improvised from the foreskirts of their dirty tunics.
  Among the mass here and there appeared persons of high degree&mdash;scribes,
  elders, rabbis, Pharisees with broad fringing, Sadducees in fine
  cloaks&mdash;serving for the time as prompters and directors. If a throat
  tired of one cry, they invented another for it; if brassy lungs showed signs
  of collapse, they set them going again; and yet the clamor, loud and
  continuous as it was, could have been reduced to a few syllables&mdash;King
  of the Jews! Room for the King of the Jews!&mdash;Defiler of the
  Temple!&mdash;Blasphemer of God!&mdash;Crucify him, crucify him! And of these
  cries the last one seemed in greatest favor, because, doubtless, it was more
  directly expressive of the wish of the mob, and helped to better articulate
  its hatred of the Nazarene.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Simonides, when Balthasar was ready to proceed&mdash;"come,
  let us forward."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur did not hear the call. The appearance of the part of the
  procession then passing, its brutality and hunger for life, were reminding
  him of the Nazarene&mdash;his gentleness, and the many charities he had seen
  him do for suffering men. Suggestions beget suggestions; so he remembered
  suddenly his own great indebtedness to the man; the time he himself was in
  the hands of a Roman guard going, as was supposed, to a death as certain and
  almost as terrible as this one of the cross; the cooling drink he had at the
  well by Nazareth, and the divine expression of the face of him who gave it;
  the later goodness, the miracle of Palm-Sunday; and with these recollections,
  the thought of his present powerlessness to give back help for help or make
  return in kind stung him keenly, and he accused himself. He had not done all
  he might; he could have watched with the Galileans, and kept them true and
  ready; and this&mdash;ah! this was the moment to strike! A blow well given
  now would not merely disperse the mob and set the Nazarene free; it would be
  a trumpet-call to Israel, and precipitate the long-dreamt-of war for freedom.
  The opportunity was going; the minutes were bearing it away; and if lost! God
  of Abraham! Was there nothing to be done&mdash;nothing?</p>

  <p>That instant a party of Galileans caught his eye. He rushed through the
  press and overtook them.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," he said. "I would have speech with you."</p>

  <p>The men obeyed him, and when they were under shelter of the house, he
  spoke again:</p>

  <p>"You are of those who took my swords, and agreed with me to strike for
  freedom and the King who was coming. You have the swords now, and now is the
  time to strike with them. Go, look everywhere, and find our brethren, and
  tell them to meet me at the tree of the cross making ready for the Nazarene.
  Haste all of you! Nay, stand not so! The Nazarene is the King, and freedom
  dies with him."</p>

  <p>They looked at him respectfully, but did not move.</p>

  <p>"Hear you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Then one of them replied,</p>

  <p>"Son of Judah"&mdash;by that name they knew him&mdash;"son of Judah, it is
  you who are deceived, not we or our brethren who have your swords. The
  Nazarene is not the King; neither has he the spirit of a king. We were with
  him when he came into Jerusalem; we saw him in the Temple; he failed himself,
  and us, and Israel; at the Gate Beautiful he turned his back upon God and
  refused the throne of David. He is not King, and Galilee is not with him. He
  shall die the death. But hear you, son of Judah. We have your swords, and we
  are ready now to draw them and strike for freedom; and so is Galilee. Be it
  for freedom, O son of Judah, for freedom! and we will meet you at the tree of
  the cross."</p>

  <p>The sovereign moment of his life was upon Ben-Hur. Could he have taken the
  offer and said the word, history might have been other than it is; but then
  it would have been history ordered by men, not God&mdash;something that never
  was, and never will be. A confusion fell upon him; he knew not how, though
  afterwards he attributed it to the Nazarene; for when the Nazarene was risen,
  he understood the death was necessary to faith in the resurrection, without
  which Christianity would be an empty husk. The confusion, as has been said,
  left him without the faculty of decision; he stood helpless&mdash;wordless
  even. Covering his face with his hand, he shook with the conflict between his
  wish, which was what he would have ordered, and the power that was upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Come; we are waiting for you," said Simonides, the fourth time.</p>

  <p>Thereupon he walked mechanically after the chair and the litter. Esther
  walked with him. Like Balthasar and his friends, the Wise Men, the day they
  went to the meeting in the desert, he was being led along the way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch810"
     name="ch810"></a>X. &mdash; THE CRUCIFIXION</h2>

  <p class="first">When the party&mdash;Balthasar, Simonides, Ben-Hur, Esther,
  and the two faithful Galileans&mdash;reached the place of crucifixion,
  Ben-Hur was in advance leading them. How they had been able to make way
  through the great press of excited people, he never knew; no more did he know
  the road by which they came or the time it took them to come. He had walked
  in total unconsciousness, neither hearing nor seeing anybody or anything, and
  without a thought of where he was going, or the ghostliest semblance of a
  purpose in his mind. In such condition a little child could have done as much
  as he to prevent the awful crime he was about to witness. The intentions of
  God are always strange to us; but not more so than the means by which they
  are wrought out, and at last made plain to our belief.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur came to a stop; those following him also stopped. As a curtain
  rises before an audience, the spell holding him in its sleep-awake rose, and
  he saw with a clear understanding.</p>

  <p>There was a space upon the top of a low knoll rounded like a skull, and
  dry, dusty, and without vegetation, except some scrubby hyssop. The boundary
  of the space was a living wall of men, with men behind struggling, some to
  look over, others to look through it. An inner wall of Roman soldiery held
  the dense outer wall rigidly to its place. A centurion kept eye upon the
  soldiers. Up to the very line so vigilantly guarded Ben-Hur had been led; at
  the line he now stood, his face to the northwest. The knoll was the old
  Aramaic Golgotha&mdash;in Latin, Calvaria; anglicized, Calvary; translated,
  The Skull.</p>

  <p>On its slopes, in the low places, on the swells and higher hills, the
  earth sparkled with a strange enamelling. Look where he would outside the
  walled space, he saw no patch of brown soil, no rock, no green thing; he saw
  only thousands of eyes in ruddy faces; off a little way in the perspective
  only ruddy faces without eyes; off a little farther only a broad, broad
  circle, which the nearer view instructed him was also of faces. And this was
  the ensemble of three millions of people; under it three millions of hearts
  throbbing with passionate interest in what was taking place upon the knoll;
  indifferent as to the thieves, caring only for the Nazarene, and for him only
  as he was an object of hate or fear or curiosity&mdash;he who loved them all,
  and was about to die for them.</p>

  <p>In the spectacle of a great assemblage of people there are always the
  bewilderment and fascination one feels while looking over a stretch of sea in
  agitation, and never had this one been exceeded; yet Ben-Hur gave it but a
  passing glance, for that which was going on in the space described would
  permit no division of his interest.</p>

  <p>Up on the knoll so high as to be above the living wall, and visible over
  the heads of an attending company of notables, conspicuous because of his
  mitre and vestments and his haughty air, stood the high priest. Up the knoll
  still higher, up quite to the round summit, so as to be seen far and near,
  was the Nazarene, stooped and suffering, but silent. The wit among the guard
  had complemented the crown upon his head by putting a reed in his hand for a
  sceptre. Clamors blew upon him like
  blasts&mdash;laughter&mdash;execrations&mdash;sometimes both together
  indistinguishably. A man&mdash;ONLY a man, O reader, would have charged the
  blasts with the remainder of his love for the race, and let it go
  forever.</p>

  <p>All the eyes then looking were fixed upon the Nazarene. It may have been
  pity with which he was moved; whatever the cause, Ben-Hur was conscious of a
  change in his feelings. A conception of something better than the best of
  this life&mdash;something so much better that it could serve a weak man with
  strength to endure agonies of spirit as well as of body; something to make
  death welcome&mdash;perhaps another life purer than this one&mdash;perhaps
  the spirit-life which Balthasar held to so fast, began to dawn upon his mind
  clearer and clearer, bringing to him a certain sense that, after all, the
  mission of the Nazarene was that of guide across the boundary for such as
  loved him; across the boundary to where his kingdom was set up and waiting
  for him. Then, as something borne through the air out of the almost
  forgotten, he heard again, or seemed to hear, the saying of the Nazarene,</p>

  <p>"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."</p>

  <p>And the words repeated themselves over and over, and took form, and the
  dawn touched them with its light, and filled them with a new meaning. And as
  men repeat a question to grasp and fix the meaning, he asked, gazing at the
  figure on the hill fainting under its crown, Who the Resurrection? and who
  the Life?</p>

  <p>"I AM,"</p>

  <p>the figure seemed to say&mdash;and say it for him; for instantly he was
  sensible of a peace such as he had never known&mdash;the peace which is the
  end of doubt and mystery, and the beginning of faith and love and clear
  understanding.</p>

  <p>From this dreamy state Ben-Hur was aroused by the sound of hammering. On
  the summit of the knoll he observed then what had escaped him
  before&mdash;some soldiers and workmen preparing the crosses. The holes for
  planting the trees were ready, and now the transverse beams were being fitted
  to their places.</p>

  <p>"Bid the men make haste," said the high-priest to the centurion.
  "These"&mdash;and he pointed to the Nazarene&mdash;"must be dead by the
  going-down of the sun, and buried that the land may not be defiled. Such is
  the Law."</p>

  <p>With a better mind, a soldier went to the Nazarene and offered him
  something to drink, but he refused the cup. Then another went to him and took
  from his neck the board with the inscription upon it, which he nailed to the
  tree of the cross&mdash;and the preparation was complete.</p>

  <p>"The crosses are ready," said the centurion to the pontiff, who received
  the report with a wave of the hand and the reply,</p>

  <p>"Let the blasphemer go first. The Son of God should be able to save
  himself. We will see."</p>

  <p>The people to whom the preparation in its several stages was visible, and
  who to this time had assailed the hill with incessant cries of impatience,
  permitted a lull which directly became a universal hush. The part of the
  infliction most shocking, at least to the thought, was reached&mdash;the men
  were to be nailed to their crosses. When for that purpose the soldiers laid
  their hands upon the Nazarene first, a shudder passed through the great
  concourse; the most brutalized shrank with dread. Afterwards there were those
  who said the air suddenly chilled and made them shiver.</p>

  <p>"How very still it is!" Esther said, as she put her arm about her father's
  neck.</p>

  <p>And remembering the torture he himself had suffered, he drew her face down
  upon his breast, and sat trembling.</p>

  <p>"Avoid it, Esther, avoid it!" he said. "I know not but all who stand and
  see it&mdash;the innocent as well as the guilty&mdash;may be cursed from this
  hour."</p>

  <p>Balthasar sank upon his knees.</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur," said Simonides, with increasing excitement&mdash;"son of
  Hur, if Jehovah stretch not forth his hand, and quickly, Israel is
  lost&mdash;and we are lost."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur answered, calmly, "I have been in a dream, Simonides, and heard in
  it why all this should be, and why it should go on. It is the will of the
  Nazarene&mdash;it is God's will. Let us do as the Egyptian here&mdash;let us
  hold our peace and pray."</p>

  <p>As he looked up on the knoll again, the words were wafted to him through
  the awful stillness&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE."</p>

  <p>He bowed reverently as to a person speaking.</p>

  <p>Up on the summit meantime the work went on. The guard took the Nazarene's
  clothes from him; so that he stood before the millions naked. The stripes of
  the scourging he had received in the early morning were still bloody upon his
  back; yet he was laid pitilessly down, and stretched upon the
  cross&mdash;first, the arms upon the transverse beam; the spikes were
  sharp&mdash;a few blows, and they were driven through the tender palms; next,
  they drew his knees up until the soles of the feet rested flat upon the tree;
  then they placed one foot upon the other, and one spike fixed both of them
  fast. The dulled sound of the hammering was heard outside the guarded space;
  and such as could not hear, yet saw the hammer as it fell, shivered with
  fear. And withal not a groan, or cry, or word of remonstrance from the
  sufferer: nothing at which an enemy could laugh; nothing a lover could
  regret.</p>

  <p>"Which way wilt thou have him faced?" asked a soldier, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Towards the Temple," the pontiff replied. "In dying I would have him see
  the holy house hath not suffered by him."</p>

  <p>The workmen put their hands to the cross, and carried it, burden and all,
  to the place of planting. At a word, they dropped the tree into the hole; and
  the body of the Nazarene also dropped heavily, and hung by the bleeding
  hands. Still no cry of pain&mdash;only the exclamation divinest of all
  recorded exclamations,</p>

  <p>"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>

  <p>The cross, reared now above all other objects, and standing singly out
  against the sky, was greeted with a burst of delight; and all who could see
  and read the writing upon the board over the Nazarene's head made haste to
  decipher it. Soon as read, the legend was adopted by them and communicated,
  and presently the whole mighty concourse was ringing the salutation from side
  to side, and repeating it with laughter and groans,</p>

  <p>"King of the Jews! Hail, King of the Jews!"</p>

  <p>The pontiff, with a clearer idea of the import of the inscription,
  protested against it, but in vain; so the titled King, looking from the knoll
  with dying eyes, must have had the city of his fathers at rest below
  him&mdash;she who had so ignominiously cast him out.</p>

  <p>The sun was rising rapidly to noon; the hills bared their brown breasts
  lovingly to it; the more distant mountains rejoiced in the purple with which
  it so regally dressed them. In the city, the temples, palaces, towers,
  pinnacles, and all points of beauty and prominence seemed to lift themselves
  into the unrivalled brilliance, as if they knew the pride they were giving
  the many who from time to time turned to look at them. Suddenly a dimness
  began to fill the sky and cover the earth&mdash;at first no more than a
  scarce perceptible fading of the day; a twilight out of time; an evening
  gliding in upon the splendors of noon. But it deepened, and directly drew
  attention; whereat the noise of the shouting and laughter fell off, and men,
  doubting their senses, gazed at each other curiously: then they looked to the
  sun again; then at the mountains, getting farther away; at the sky and the
  near landscape, sinking in shadow; at the hill upon which the tragedy was
  enacting; and from all these they gazed at each other again, and turned pale,
  and held their peace.</p>

  <p>"It is only a mist or passing cloud," Simonides said soothingly to Esther,
  who was alarmed. "It will brighten presently."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur did not think so.</p>

  <p>"It is not a mist or a cloud," he said. "The spirits who live in the
  air&mdash;the prophets and saints&mdash;are at work in mercy to themselves
  and nature. I say to you, O Simonides, truly as God lives, he who hangs
  yonder is the Son of God."</p>

  <p>And leaving Simonides lost in wonder at such a speech from him, he went
  where Balthasar was kneeling near by, and laid his hand upon the good man's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"O wise Egyptian, hearken! Thou alone wert right&mdash;the Nazarene is
  indeed the Son of God."</p>

  <p>Balthasar drew him down to him, and replied, feebly, "I saw him a child in
  the manger where he was first laid; it is not strange that I knew him sooner
  than thou; but oh that I should live to see this day! Would I had died with
  my brethren! Happy Melchior! Happy, happy Gaspar!"</p>

  <p>"Comfort thee!" said Ben-Hur. "Doubtless they too are here."</p>

  <p>The dimness went on deepening into obscurity, and that into positive
  darkness, but without deterring the bolder spirits upon the knoll. One after
  the other the thieves were raised on their crosses, and the crosses planted.
  The guard was then withdrawn, and the people set free closed in upon the
  height, and surged up it, like a converging wave. A man might take a look,
  when a new-comer would push him on, and take his place, to be in turn pushed
  on&mdash;and there were laughter and ribaldry and revilements, all for the
  Nazarene.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! If thou be King of the Jews, save thyself," a soldier
  shouted.</p>

  <p>"Ay," said a priest, "if he will come down to us now, we will believe in
  him."</p>

  <p>Others wagged their heads wisely, saying, "He would destroy the Temple,
  and rebuild it in three days, but cannot save himself."</p>

  <p>Others still: "He called himself the Son of God; let us see if God will
  have him."</p>

  <p>What all there is in prejudice no one has ever said. The Nazarene had
  never harmed the people; far the greater part of them had never seen him
  except in this his hour of calamity; yet&mdash;singular
  contrariety!&mdash;they loaded him with their curses, and gave their sympathy
  to the thieves.</p>

  <p>The supernatural night, dropped thus from the heavens, affected Esther as
  it began to affect thousands of others braver and stronger.</p>

  <p>"Let us go home," she prayed&mdash;twice, three times&mdash;saying, "It is
  the frown of God, father. What other dreadful things may happen, who can
  tell? I am afraid."</p>

  <p>Simonides was obstinate. He said little, but was plainly under great
  excitement. Observing, about the end of the first hour, that the violence of
  the crowding up on the knoll was somewhat abated, at his suggestion the party
  advanced to take position nearer the crosses. Ben-Hur gave his arm to
  Balthasar; yet the Egyptian made the ascent with difficulty. From their new
  stand, the Nazarene was imperfectly visible, appearing to them not more than
  a dark suspended figure. They could hear him, however&mdash;hear his sighing,
  which showed an endurance or exhaustion greater than that of his
  fellow-sufferers; for they filled every lull in the noises with their groans
  and entreaties.</p>

  <p>The second hour after the suspension passed like the first one. To the
  Nazarene they were hours of insult, provocation, and slow dying. He spoke but
  once in the time. Some women came and knelt at the foot of his cross. Among
  them he recognized his mother with the beloved disciple.</p>

  <p>"Woman," he said, raising his voice, "behold thy son!" And to the
  disciple, "Behold thy mother!"</p>

  <p>The third hour came, and still the people surged round the hill, held to
  it by some strange attraction, with which, in probability, the night in
  midday had much to do. They were quieter than in the preceding hour; yet at
  intervals they could be heard off in the darkness shouting to each other,
  multitude calling unto multitude. It was noticeable, also, that coming now to
  the Nazarene, they approached his cross in silence, took the look in silence,
  and so departed. This change extended even to the guard, who so shortly
  before had cast lots for the clothes of the crucified; they stood with their
  officers a little apart, more watchful of the one convict than of the throngs
  coming and going. If he but breathed heavily, or tossed his head in a
  paroxysm of pain, they were instantly on the alert. Most marvellous of all,
  however, was the altered behavior of the high-priest and his following, the
  wise men who had assisted him in the trial in the night, and, in the victim's
  face, kept place by him with zealous approval. When the darkness began to
  fall, they began to lose their confidence. There were among them many learned
  in astronomy, and familiar with the apparitions so terrible in those days to
  the masses; much of the knowledge was descended to them from their fathers
  far back; some of it had been brought away at the end of the Captivity; and
  the necessities of the Temple service kept it all bright. These closed
  together when the sun commenced to fade before their eyes, and the mountains
  and hills to recede; they drew together in a group around their pontiff, and
  debated what they saw. "The moon is at its full," they said, with truth, "and
  this cannot be an eclipse." Then, as no one could answer the question common
  with them all&mdash;as no one could account for the darkness, or for its
  occurrence at that particular time, in their secret hearts they associated it
  with the Nazarene, and yielded to an alarm which the long continuance of the
  phenomenon steadily increased. In their place behind the soldiers, they noted
  every word and motion of the Nazarene, and hung with fear upon his sighs, and
  talked in whispers. The man might be the Messiah, and then&mdash; But they
  would wait and see!</p>

  <p>In the meantime Ben-Hur was not once visited by the old spirit. The
  perfect peace abode with him. He prayed simply that the end might be
  hastened. He knew the condition of Simonides' mind&mdash;that he was
  hesitating on the verge of belief. He could see the massive face weighed down
  by solemn reflection. He noticed him casting inquiring glances at the sun, as
  seeking the cause of the darkness. Nor did he fail to notice the solicitude
  with which Esther clung to him, smothering her fears to accommodate his
  wishes.</p>

  <p>"Be not afraid," he heard him say to her; "but stay and watch with me.
  Thou mayst live twice the span of my life, and see nothing of human interest
  equal to this; and there may be revelations more. Let us stay to the
  close."</p>

  <p>When the third hour was about half gone, some men of the rudest
  class&mdash;wretches from the tombs about the city&mdash;came and stopped in
  front of the centre cross.</p>

  <p>"This is he, the new King of the Jews," said one of them.</p>

  <p>The others cried, with laughter, "Hail, all hail, King of the Jews!"</p>

  <p>Receiving no reply, they went closer.</p>

  <p>"If thou be King of the Jews, or Son of God, come down," they said,
  loudly.</p>

  <p>At this, one of the thieves quit groaning, and called to the Nazarene,
  "Yes, if thou be Christ, save thyself and us."</p>

  <p>The people laughed and applauded; then, while they were listening for a
  reply, the other felon was heard to say to the first one, "Dost thou not fear
  God? We receive the due rewards of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing
  amiss."</p>

  <p>The bystanders were astonished; in the midst of the hush which ensued, the
  second felon spoke again, but this time to the Nazarene:</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."</p>

  <p>Simonides gave a great start. "When thou comest into thy kingdom!" It was
  the very point of doubt in his mind; the point he had so often debated with
  Balthasar.</p>

  <p>"Didst thou hear?" said Ben-Hur to him. "The kingdom cannot be of this
  world. Yon witness saith the King is but going to his kingdom; and, in
  effect, I heard the same in my dream."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Simonides, more imperiously than ever before in speech to
  Ben-Hur. "Hush, I pray thee! If the Nazarene should answer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke the Nazarene did answer, in a clear voice, full of
  confidence:</p>

  <p>"Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise!"</p>

  <p>Simonides waited to hear if that were all; then he folded his hands and
  said, "No more, no more, Lord! The darkness is gone; I see with other
  eyes&mdash;even as Balthasar, I see with eyes of perfect faith."</p>

  <p>The faithful servant had at last his fitting reward. His broken body might
  never be restored; nor was there riddance of the recollection of his
  sufferings, or recall of the years embittered by them; but suddenly a new
  life was shown him, with assurance that it was for him&mdash;a new life lying
  just beyond this one&mdash;and its name was Paradise. There he would find the
  Kingdom of which he had been dreaming, and the King. A perfect peace fell
  upon him.</p>

  <p>Over the way, in front of the cross, however, there were surprise and
  consternation. The cunning casuists there put the assumption underlying the
  question and the admission underlying the answer together. For saying through
  the land that he was the Messiah, they had brought the Nazarene to the cross;
  and, lo! on the cross, more confidently than ever, he had not only reasserted
  himself, but promised enjoyment of his Paradise to a malefactor. They
  trembled at what they were doing. The pontiff, with all his pride, was
  afraid. Where got the man his confidence except from Truth? And what should
  the Truth be but God? A very little now would put them all to flight.</p>

  <p>The breaching of the Nazarene grew harder, his sighs became great gasps.
  Only three hours upon the cross, and he was dying!</p>

  <p>The intelligence was carried from man to man, until every one knew it; and
  then everything hushed; the breeze faltered and died; a stifling vapor loaded
  the air; heat was superadded to darkness; nor might any one unknowing the
  fact have thought that off the hill, out under the overhanging pall, there
  were three millions of people waiting awe-struck what should happen
  next&mdash;they were so still!</p>

  <p>Then there went out through the gloom, over the heads of such as were on
  the hill within hearing of the dying man, a cry of despair, if not
  reproach:</p>

  <p>"My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

  <p>The voice startled all who heard it. One it touched uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>The soldiers in coming had brought with them a vessel of wine and water,
  and set it down a little way from Ben-Hur. With a sponge dipped into the
  liquor, and put on the end of a stick, they could moisten the tongue of a
  sufferer at their pleasure. Ben-Hur thought of the draught he had had at the
  well near Nazareth; an impulse seized him; catching up the sponge, he dipped
  it into the vessel, and started for the cross.</p>

  <p>"Let him be!" the people in the way shouted, angrily. "Let him be!"</p>

  <p>Without minding them, he ran on, and put the sponge to the Nazarene's
  lips.</p>

  <p>Too late, too late!</p>

  <p>The face then plainly seen by Ben-Hur, bruised and black with blood and
  dust as it was, lighted nevertheless with a sudden glow; the eyes opened
  wide, and fixed upon some one visible to them alone in the far heavens; and
  there were content and relief, even triumph, in the shout the victim
  gave.</p>

  <p>"It is finished! It is finished!"</p>

  <p>So a hero, dying in the doing a great deed, celebrates his success with a
  last cheer.</p>

  <p>The light in the eyes went out; slowly the crowned head sank upon the
  laboring breast. Ben-Hur thought the struggle over; but the fainting soul
  recollected itself, so that he and those around him caught the other and last
  words, spoken in a low voice, as if to one listening close by:</p>

  <p>"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit."</p>

  <p>A tremor shook the tortured body; there was a scream of fiercest anguish,
  and the mission and the earthly life were over at once. The heart, with all
  its love, was broken; for of that, O reader, the man died!</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur went back to his friends, saying, simply, "It is over; he is
  dead."</p>

  <p>In a space incredibly short the multitude was informed of the
  circumstance. No one repeated it aloud; there was a murmur which spread from
  the knoll in every direction; a murmur that was little more than a
  whispering, "He is dead! he is dead!" and that was all. The people had their
  wish; the Nazarene was dead; yet they stared at each other aghast. His blood
  was upon them! And while they stood staring at each other, the ground
  commenced to shake; each man took hold of his neighbor to support himself; in
  a twinkling the darkness disappeared, and the sun came out; and everybody, as
  with the same glance, beheld the crosses upon the hill all reeling
  drunken-like in the earthquake. They beheld all three of them; but the one in
  the centre was arbitrary; it alone would be seen; and for that it seemed to
  extend itself upwards, and lift its burden, and swing it to and fro higher
  and higher in the blue of the sky. And every man among them who had jeered at
  the Nazarene; every one who had struck him; every one who had voted to
  crucify him; every one who had marched in the procession from the city; every
  one who had in his heart wished him dead, and they were as ten to one, felt
  that he was in some way individually singled out from the many, and that if
  he would live he must get away quickly as possible from that menace in the
  sky. They started to run; they ran with all their might; on horseback, and
  camels, and in chariots they ran, as well as on foot; but then as if it were
  mad at them for what they had done, and had taken up the cause of the
  unoffending and friendless dead, the earthquake pursued them, and tossed them
  about, and flung them down, and terrified them yet more by the horrible noise
  of great rocks grinding and rending beneath them. They beat their breasts and
  shrieked with fear. His blood was upon them! The home-bred and the foreign,
  priest and layman, beggar, Sadducee, Pharisee, were overtaken in the race,
  and tumbled about indiscriminately. If they called on the Lord, the outraged
  earth answered for him in fury, and dealt them all alike. It did not even
  know wherein the high-priest was better than his guilty brethren; overtaking
  him, it tripped him up also, and smirched the fringimg of his robe, and
  filled the golden bells with sand, and his mouth with dust. He and his people
  were alike in the one thing at least&mdash;the blood of the Nazarene was upon
  them all!</p>

  <p>When the sunlight broke upon the crucifixion, the mother of the Nazarene,
  the disciple, and the faithful women of Galilee, the centurion and his
  soldiers, and Ben-Hur and his party, were all who remained upon the hill.
  These had not time to observe the flight of the multitude; they were too
  loudly called upon to take care of themselves.</p>

  <p>"Seat thyself here," said Ben-Hur to Esther, making a place for her at her
  father's feet. "Now cover thine eyes and look not up; but put thy trust in
  God, and the spirit of yon just man so foully slain."</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Simonides, reverently, "let us henceforth speak of him as the
  Christ."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>Presently a wave of the earthquake struck the hill. The shrieks of the
  thieves upon the reeling crosses were terrible to hear. Though giddy with the
  movements of the ground, Ben-Hur had time to look at Balthasar, and beheld
  him prostrate and still. He ran to him and called&mdash;there was no reply.
  The good man was dead! Then Ben-Hur remembered to have heard a cry in answer,
  as it were, to the scream of the Nazarene in his last moment; but he had not
  looked to see from whom it had proceeded; and ever after he believed the
  spirit of the Egyptian accompanied that of his Master over the boundary into
  the kingdom of Paradise. The idea rested not only upon the cry heard, but
  upon the exceeding fitness of the distinction. If faith were worthy reward in
  the person of Gaspar, and love in that of Melchior, surely he should have
  some special meed who through a long life and so excellently illustrated the
  three virtues in combination&mdash;Faith, Love, and Good Works.</p>

  <p>The servants of Balthasar had deserted their master; but when all was
  over, the two Galileans bore the old man in his litter back to the city.</p>

  <p>It was a sorrowful procession that entered the south gate of the palace of
  the Hurs about the set of sun that memorable day. About the same hour the
  body of the Christ was taken down from the cross.</p>

  <p>The remains of Balthasar were carried to the guest-chamber. All the
  servants hastened weeping to see him; for he had the love of every living
  thing with which he had in anywise to do; but when they beheld his face, and
  the smile upon it, they dried their tears, saying, "It is well. He is happier
  this evening than when he went out in the morning."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur would not trust a servant to inform Iras what had befallen her
  father. He went himself to see her and bring her to the body. He imagined her
  grief; she would now be alone in the world; it was a time to forgive and pity
  her. He remembered he had not asked why she was not of the party in the
  morning, or where she was; he remembered he had not thought of her; and, from
  shame, he was ready to make any amends, the more so as he was about to plunge
  her into such acute grief.</p>

  <p>He shook the curtains of her door; and though he heard the ringing of the
  little bells echoing within, he had no response; he called her name, and
  again he called&mdash;still no answer. He drew the curtain aside and went
  into the room; she was not there. He ascended hastily to the roof in search
  of her; nor was she there. He questioned the servants; none of them had seen
  her during the day. After a long quest everywhere through the house, Ben-Hur
  returned to the guest-chamber, and took the place by the dead which should
  have been hers; and he bethought him there how merciful the Christ had been
  to his aged servant. At the gate of the kingdom of Paradise happily the
  afflictions of this life, even its desertions, are left behind and forgotten
  by those who go in and rest.</p>

  <p>When the gloom of the burial was nigh gone, on the ninth day after the
  healing, the law being fulfilled, Ben-Hur brought his mother and Tirzah home;
  and from that day, in that house the most sacred names possible of utterance
  by men were always coupled worshipfully together,</p>

  <p>GOD THE FATHER AND CHRIST THE SON.</p>

  <p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>About five years after the crucifixion, Esther, the wife of Ben-Hur, sat
  in her room in the beautiful villa by Misenum. It was noon, with a warm
  Italian sun making summer for the roses and vines outside. Everything in the
  apartment was Roman, except that Esther wore the garments of a Jewish matron.
  Tirzah and two children at play upon a lion skin on the floor were her
  companions; and one had only to observe how carefully she watched them to
  know that the little ones were hers.</p>

  <p>Time had treated her generously. She was more than ever beautiful, and in
  becoming mistress of the villa, she had realized one of her cherished
  dreams.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this simple, home-like scene, a servant appeared in the
  doorway, and spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"A woman in the atrium to speak with the mistress."</p>

  <p>"Let her come. I will receive her here."</p>

  <p>Presently the stranger entered. At sight of her the Jewess arose, and was
  about to speak; then she hesitated, changed color, and finally drew back,
  saying, "I have known you, good woman. You are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was Iras, the daughter of Balthasar."</p>

  <p>Esther conquered her surprise, and bade the servant bring the Egyptian a
  seat.</p>

  <p>"No," said Iras, coldly. "I will retire directly."</p>

  <p>The two gazed at each other. We know what Esther presented&mdash;a
  beautiful woman, a happy mother, a contented wife. On the other side, it was
  very plain that fortune had not dealt so gently with her former rival. The
  tall figure remained with some of its grace; but an evil life had tainted the
  whole person. The face was coarse; the large eyes were red and pursed beneath
  the lower lids; there was no color in her cheeks. The lips were cynical and
  hard, and general neglect was leading rapidly to premature old age. Her
  attire was ill chosen and draggled. The mud of the road clung to her sandals.
  Iras broke the painful silence.</p>

  <p>"These are thy children?"</p>

  <p>Esther looked at them, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Will you not speak to them?"</p>

  <p>"I would scare them," Iras replied. Then she drew closer to Esther, and
  seeing her shrink, said, "Be not afraid. Give thy husband a message for me.
  Tell him his enemy is dead, and that for the much misery he brought me I slew
  him."</p>

  <p>"His enemy!"</p>

  <p>"The Messala. Further, tell thy husband that for the harm I sought to do
  him I have been punished until even he would pity me."</p>

  <p>Tears arose in Esther's eyes, and she was about to speak.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Iras, "I do not want pity or tears. Tell him, finally, I have
  found that to be a Roman is to be a brute. Farewell."</p>

  <p>She moved to go. Esther followed her.</p>

  <p>"Stay, and see my husband. He has no feeling against you. He sought for
  you everywhere. He will be your friend. I will be your friend. We are
  Christians."</p>

  <p>The other was firm.</p>

  <p>"No; I am what I am of choice. It will be over shortly."</p>

  <p>"But"&mdash;Esther hesitated&mdash;"have we nothing you would wish;
  nothing to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The countenance of the Egyptian softened; something like a smile played
  about her lips. She looked at the children upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"There is something," she said.</p>

  <p>Esther followed her eyes, and with quick perception answered, "It is
  yours."</p>

  <p>Iras went to them, and knelt on the lion's skin, and kissed them both.
  Rising slowly, she looked at them; then passed to the door and out of it
  without a parting word. She walked rapidly, and was gone before Esther could
  decide what to do.</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur, when he was told of the visit, knew certainly what he had long
  surmised&mdash;that on the day of the crucifixion Iras had deserted her
  father for Messala. Nevertheless, he set out immediately and hunted for her
  vainly; they never saw her more, or heard of her. The blue bay, with all its
  laughing under the sun, has yet its dark secrets. Had it a tongue, it might
  tell us of the Egyptian.</p>

  <p>Simonides lived to be a very old man. In the tenth year of Nero's reign,
  he gave up the business so long centred in the warehouse at Antioch. To the
  last he kept a clear head and a good heart, and was successful.</p>

  <p>One evening, in the year named, he sat in his arm-chair on the terrace of
  the warehouse. Ben-Hur and Esther, and their three children, were with him.
  The last of the ships swung at mooring in the current of the river; all the
  rest had been sold. In the long interval between this and the day of the
  crucifixion but one sorrow had befallen them: that was when the mother of
  Ben-Hur died; and then and now their grief would have been greater but for
  their Christian faith.</p>

  <p>The ship spoken of had arrived only the day before, bringing intelligence
  of the persecution of Christians begun by Nero in Rome, and the party on the
  terrace were talking of the news when Malluch, who was still in their
  service, approached and delivered a package to Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>"Who brings this?" the latter asked, after reading.</p>

  <p>"An Arab."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He left immediately."</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Ben-Hur to Simonides.</p>

  <p>He read then the following letter:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I, Ilderim, the son of Ilderim the Generous, and sheik of
  the tribe of Ilderim, to Judah, son of Hur.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Know, O friend of my father's, how my father loved you.
  Read what is herewith sent, and you will know. His will is my will; therefore
  what he gave is thine.</p>

  <p class="letter">"All the Parthians took from him in the great battle in
  which they slew him I have retaken&mdash;this writing, with other things, and
  vengeance, and all the brood of that Mira who in his time was mother of so
  many stars.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Peace be to you and all yours.</p>

  <p class="letter">"This voice out of the desert is the voice of</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Ilderim, Shiek.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>Ben-Hur next unrolled a scrap of papyrus yellow as a withered mulberry
  leaf. It required the daintiest handling. Proceeding, he read:</p>

  <p>"Ilderim, surnamed the Generous, sheik of the tribe of Ilderim, to the son
  who succeeds me.</p>

  <p>"All I have, O son, shall be thine in the day of thy succession, except
  that property by Antioch known as the Orchard of Palms; and it shall be to
  the son of Hur who brought us such glory in the Circus&mdash;to him and his
  forever.</p>

  <p>"Dishonor not thy father. ILDERIM THE GENEROUS, Sheik."</p>

  <p>"What say you?" asked Ben-Hur, of Simonides.</p>

  <p>Esther took the papers pleased, and read them to herself. Simonides
  remained silent. His eyes were upon the ship; but he was thinking. At length
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Son of Hur," he said, gravely, "the Lord has been good to you in these
  later years. You have much to be thankful for. Is it not time to decide
  finally the meaning of the gift of the great fortune now all in your hand,
  and growing?"</p>

  <p>"I decided that long ago. The fortune was meant for the service of the
  Giver; not a part, Simonides, but all of it. The question with me has been,
  How can I make it most useful in his cause? And of that tell me, I pray
  you."</p>

  <p>Simonides answered,</p>

  <p>"The great sums you have given to the Church here in Antioch, I am witness
  to. Now, instantly almost with this gift of the generous sheik's, comes the
  news of the persecution of the brethren in Rome. It is the opening of a new
  field. The light must not go out in the capital."</p>

  <p>"Tell me how I can keep it alive."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. The Romans, even this Nero, hold two things
  sacred&mdash;I know of no others they so hold&mdash;they are the ashes of the
  dead and all places of burial. If you cannot build temples for the worship of
  the Lord above ground, then build them below the ground; and to keep them
  from profanation, carry to them the bodies of all who die in the faith."</p>

  <p>Ben-Hur arose excitedly.</p>

  <p>"It is a great idea," he said. "I will not wait to begin it. Time forbids
  waiting. The ship that brought the news of the suffering of our brethren
  shall take me to Rome. I will sail to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He turned to Malluch.</p>

  <p>"Get the ship ready, Malluch, and be thou ready to go with me.</p>

  <p>"It is well," said Simonides.</p>

  <p>"And thou, Esther, what sayest thou?" asked Ben-Hur.</p>

  <p>Esther came to his side, and put her hand on his arm, and answered,</p>

  <p>"So wilt thou best serve the Christ. O my husband, let me not hinder, but
  go with thee and help."</p>
