<hr>
<p><span class="a">On</span> the 7th of February,
1773<span class="pagenum">[1773. February.<br>
Sunday 7.]</span>, in the morning, the Resolution being then
about two miles a-head, the wind shifting then to the westward,
brought on a very thick fog; so that we lost sight of her. We
soon after heard a gun, the report of which we imagined to be on
the larboard beam; we then hauled up S.E., and kept firing a
four-pounder every half hour, but had no answer, nor further
sight of her; then we kept the course we steered on before the
fog came on. In the evening it began to blow hard, and was at
intervals more clear, but could see nothing of her, which gave us
much uneasiness. We then tacked and stood to the westward, to
cruise in the place where we last saw her, according to
agreement, in case of separation; but next day came on a very
heavy gale of wind and thick <span class="pagenum">[Monday
8.]</span>weather, that obliged us to bring to, and thereby
prevented us reaching the intended spot. However, the wind coming
more moderate, and the fog in some measure clearing away, we
cruised as near the place as we could get, for three days; when
giving over all hopes of joining company again, we bore away for
winter quarters, distant fourteen hundred leagues, through a sea
entirely unknown and reduced the allowance of water to one quart
per day.</p>
<p>We kept between the latitude of 52° and 53° South, had much
westerly wind, hard gales, with squalls, snow and sleet, with a
long hollow sea from the S.W., so that we judged there is no land
in that quarter. After we reached the longitude of 95° East, we
found the variation decrease very fast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Friday 26.]</span>On the 26th, at
night, we saw a meteor of uncommon brightness in the N.N.W. It
directed its course to the S.W., with a very great light in the
southern sky, such as is known to the northward by the name of
Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. We saw the light for several
nights running; and, what is remarkable, we saw but one ice
island after we parted company with the Resolution, till our
making land, though we were most of the time two or three degrees
to the southward of the latitude we first saw it in. We were
daily attended by great numbers of sea birds, and frequently saw
porpoises curiously spotted white and black.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[March.<br>
Monday 1.]</span>On the 1st of March we were alarmed with the cry
of land by the man at the mast-head, on the larboard beam; which
gave us great joy. We immediately hauled our wind and stood for
it, but to our mortification were disappointed in a few hours;
for, what we took to be land, proved no more than clouds, which
disappeared as we sailed towards them. We then bore away, and
directed our course towards the land laid down in the charts by
the name of Van Diemen's Land, discovered by Tasman in 1642, and
laid down in the latitude 44° South, and longitude 140° East, and
supposed to join to New Holland.</p>
<p>On the 9th of March <span class="pagenum">[Tuesday 9.]</span>,
having little wind and pleasant weather, about nine A. M. being
then in the latitude of 43° 37' South longitude, by lunar
observation, 145° 36' East, and by account 143° 10' East from
Greenwich, we saw the land bearing N.N.E., about eight or nine
leagues distance. It appeared moderately high, and uneven near
the sea; the hills farther back formed a double land, and much
higher. There seemed to be several islands, or broken land, to
the N.W., as the shore trenched; but by reason of clouds that
hung over them, we could not be certain whether they did not join
to the main. We hauled immediately up for it, and by noon were
within three or four leagues of it. A point much like the Ramhead
off Plymouth, which I take to be the same that Tasman calls South
Cape, bore north four leagues off us. The land from this cape
runs directly to the eastward; about four leagues along shore are
three islands about two miles long, and several rocks, resembling
the Mewstone, (particularly one which we so named,) about four or
five leagues E.S.E ½ E. off the above cape, which Tasman has not
mentioned, or laid down in his draughts. After you pass these
islands, the land lies E. by N., and W. by S., by the compass
nearly. It is a bold shore, and seems to afford several bays or
anchoring-places, but believe deep water. From the S.W. cape,
which is in the latitude of 43° 39' South, and longitude 145° 50'
East to the S.E. cape, in the latitude 43° 36' South, longitude
147° East, is nearly sixteen leagues, and sounding from
forty-eight to seventy fathoms, sand and broken shells three or
four leagues off shore. Here the country is hilly and full of
trees, the shore rocky and difficult landing, occasioned by the
wind blowing here continually from the westward, which occasions
such a surf that the sand cannot lie on the shore. We saw no
inhabitants here.</p>
<p>The morning, on the 10th of March<span class=
"pagenum">[Wednes.<br>
10.]</span>, being calm, the ship then about four miles from the
land, sent the great cutter on shore with the second lieutenant,
to find if there was any harbour or good bay. Soon after, it
beginning to blow very hard, made the signal for the boat to
return several times, but they did not see or hear any thing of
it; the ship then three or four leagues off, that we could not
see any thing of the boat, which gave us great uneasiness, as
there was a very great sea. At half-past one P. M. to our great
satisfaction, the boat returned on board safe. They landed, but
with much difficulty, and saw several places where the Indians
had been, and one they lately had left, where they had a fire,
with a great number of pearl escallop shells round it, which
shells they brought on board, with, some burnt sticks and green
boughs. There was a path from this place, through the woods,
which in all probability leads to their habitations; but, by
reason of the weather, had not time to pursue it. The soil seems
to be very rich; the country well clothed with wood, particularly
on the lee side of the hills; plenty of water which falls from
the rocks in beautiful cascades, for two or three hundred feet
perpendicular into the sea; but they did not see the least sign
of any place to anchor in with safety. Hoisted in the boat, and
made sail for Frederick Henry Bay. From noon to three P. M.
running along shore E. by N., at which time we were abreast of
the westernmost point of a very deep bay, called by Tasman,
Stormy Bay. From the west to the east point of this bay there are
several small islands, and black rocks, which we called the
Friars. While crossing this bay we had very heavy squalls and
thick weather; at times, when it cleared up, I saw several fires
in the bottom of the bay, which is near two or three leagues
deep, and has, I doubt not, good places for anchoring, but the
weather being so bad, did not think it safe to stand into it.
From the Friars the land trenches away about N. by E. four
leagues: We had smooth water, and kept in shore, having regular
soundings from twenty to fifteen fathoms water. At half-past six
we hauled round a high bluff point, the rocks whereof were like
so many fluted pillars, and had ten fathoms water, fine sand,
within half a mile of the shore. At seven, being abreast of a
fine bay, and having little wind, we came-to, with the small
bower, in twenty-four fathoms, sandy bottom. Just after we
anchored, being a fine clear evening, had a good observation of
the star Antares and the moon, which gave the longitude of 147°
34' East, being in the latitude of 43° 20' South. We first took
this bay to be that which Tasman called Frederick Henry Bay; but
afterwards found that his is laid down five leagues to the
northward of this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Thursday 11.]</span>At day-break the
next morning, I sent the master in shore to sound the bay, and to
find out a watering-place; at eight he returned, having found a
most excellent harbour, clear ground from side to side, from
eighteen to five fathom water all over the bay, gradually
decreasing as you go in shore. We weighed and turned up into the
bay; the wind being westerly, and very little of it, which
baffled us much in getting in. At seven o'clock in the evening,
we anchored in seven fathoms water, with a small bower, and
moored with the coasting anchor to the westward, the north point
of the bay N.N.E. ½ E. (which we take to be Tasman's
Head<span class="pagenum">[Tuesday 20.]</span>), and the
Eastermost point (which we named Penguin Island, from a curious
one we caught there) N.E. by E ¾ E.; the watering-place W. ½ N.;
about one mile from the shore on each side; Maria's Island, which
is about five or six leagues off, shut in with both points; so
that you are quite land-locked in a most spacious harbour.</p>
<p>We lay here five days, which time was employed in wooding and
watering (which is easily got), and over-hauling the rigging. We
found the country very pleasant; the soil a black, rich, though
thin one; the sides of the hills covered with large trees, and
very thick, growing to a great height before they branch off.
They are all of the evergreen kind, different from any I ever
saw; the wood is very brittle, and easily split; there is a very
little variety of sorts, having seen but two. The leaves of one
are long and narrow; and the seed (of which I got a few) is in
the shape of a button, and has a very agreeable smell. The leaves
of the other are like the bay, and it has a seed like the white
thorn, with an agreeable spicy taste and smell. Out of the trees
we cut down for fire-wood, there issued some gum, which the
surgeon called gum-lac. The trees are mostly burnt or scorched,
near the ground, occasioned by the natives setting fire to the
under-wood, in the most frequented places; and by these means
they have rendered it easy walking. The land birds we saw, are a
bird like a raven; some of the crow kind, black, with the tips of
the feathers of the tail and wings white, their bill long and
very sharp; some paroquets; and several kinds of small birds. The
sea-fowl are ducks, teal, and the sheldrake. I forgot to mention
a large white bird, that one of the gentlemen shot, about the
size of a large kite of the eagle kind. <span class=
"pagenum">[Monday 15.]</span>As for beasts, we saw but one, which
was an <em>opossom</em>; but we observed the dung of some, which
we judged to be of the deer kind. The fish in the bay are scarce;
those we caught were mostly sharks, dog-fish, and a fish called
by the seamen nurses, like the dog-fish, only full of small white
spots; and some small fish not unlike sprats. The lagoons (which
are brackish) abound with trout, and several other sorts of fish,
of which we caught a few with lines, but being much encumbered
with stumps of trees, we could not haul the seine.</p>
<p>While we lay here, we saw several smokes and large fires,
about eight or ten miles in shore to the northward, but did not
see any of the natives; though they frequently come into this
bay, as there were several wigwams or huts, where we found some
bags and nets made of grass, in which I imagine they carry their
provisions and other necessaries. In one of them there was the
stone they strike fire with, and tinder made of bark, but of what
tree could not be distinguished. We found in one of their huts,
one of their spears, which was made sharp at one end, I suppose,
with a shell or stone. Those things we brought away, leaving in
the room of them medals, gun-flints, a few nails, and an old
empty barrel with the iron hoops on it. They seem to be quite
ignorant of every sort of metal. The boughs, of which their huts
are made, are either broken or split, and tied together with
grass in a circular form, the largest end stuck in the ground,
and the smaller parts meeting in a point at the top, and covered
with fern and bark, so poorly done, that they will hardly keep
out a shower of rain. In the middle is the fire-place, surrounded
with heaps of muscle, pearl, scallop, and cray-fish shells, which
I believe<span class="pagenum">[Monday 15]</span> to be their
chief food, though we could not find any of them. They lie on the
ground, on dried grass, round the fire; and I believe they have
no settled place of habitation (as their houses seemed built only
for a few days), but wander about in small parties from place to
place in search of food, and are actuated by no other motive. We
never found more than three or four huts in a place, capable of
containing three or four persons each only; and what is
remarkable, we never saw the least marks either of canoe or boat,
and it is generally thought they have none; being altogether,
from what we could judge, a very ignorant and wretched set of
people, though natives of a country capable of producing every
necessary of life, and a climate the finest in the world. We
found not the least signs of any minerals or metals.</p>
<p>Having completed our wood and water, we sailed from Adventure
Bay, intending to coast it up along shore, till we should fall in
with the land seen by Captain Cook, and discover whether Van
Diemen's Land joins with New Holland<span class=
"pagenum">[Tuesday 16.]</span>. On the 16th, we passed Maria's
Islands, so named by Tassman; they appear to be the same as the
main land. On the 17th<span class="pagenum">[Wednes.<br>
17.]</span>, having passed Shouten's Islands, we hauled in for
the main land, and stood along shore at the distance of two or
three leagues off. The country here appears to be very thickly
inhabited, as there was a continual fire along shore as we
sailed. The land hereabouts is much pleasanter, low, and even;
but no signs of a harbour or bay, where a ship might anchor with
safety. The weather being bad, and blowing hard at S.S.E., we
could not send a boat on shore to have any intercourse with the
inhabitants. In the latitude of 40° 50' South, the land trenches
away to the westward, which I believe forms a deep bay, as we saw
from the deck several smokes arising a-back of the islands that
lay before it, when we could not see the least signs of land from
the mast head.</p>

<br>
<p>From the latitude of 40° 50' South, to the latitude of 39° 50'
South, is nothing but islands and shoals; the land high, rocky,
and barren. On the 19th<span class="pagenum">[Friday 19.]</span>,
in the latitude of 40° 30' South, observing breakers about half a
mile within shore of us, we sounded, and finding but eight
fathoms, immediately hauled off, deepened our water to fifteen
fathoms, then bore away and kept along shore again. From the
latitude of 39° 50' to 39° S., we saw no land, but had regular
soundings from fifteen to thirty fathoms. As we stood on to the
northward, we made land again in about 39°; after which we
discontinued our northerly course, as we found the ground very
uneven, and shoal-water some distance off. I think it a very
dangerous shore to fall in with.</p>
<p>The Coast, from Adventure Bay to the place where we stood away
for New Zealand, lies in the direction S. ½ W., and N. ½ E.,
about seventy-five leagues; and it is my opinion that there are
no straits between New Holland and Van Diemen's Land, but a very
deep bay.--I should have stood farther to the northward, but the
wind blowing strong at S.S.E., and looking likely to haul round
to the eastward, which would have blown right on the land, I
therefore thought it more proper to leave the coast and steer for
New Zealand.</p>
<p>After we left Van Diemen's Land, we had very uncertain
weather, with rain and very heavy gusts of wind. On the
24th<span class="pagenum">[Wednes.<br>
24.]</span>, we were surprised with a very severe squall, that
reduced us from top-gallant sails to reefed courses, in the space
of an hour. The sea rising equally quick, we shipped many waves,
one of which stove the large cutter, and drove the small one from
her lashing in the waist; and with much difficulty we saved her
from being washed overboard. This gale lasted twelve hours, after
which we had more moderate weather, intermixed with calms. We
frequently hoisted out the boats to try the currents, and in
general found a small drift to the W.S.W. We shot many birds; and
had, upon the whole, good weather; but as we got near to the
land, it came on thick and dirty for several days, till we made
the coast of New Zealand in 40° 30' South, having made
twenty-four degrees of longitude, from Adventure Bay, after a
passage of fifteen days.</p>
<p>We had the winds much southerly in this passage, and I was
under some apprehensions of not being able to fetch the straits,
which would have obliged us to steer away for George's Island; I
would therefore advise any who sail to this part, to keep to the
southward, particularly in the fall of the year, when the S. and
S.E. winds prevail.</p>
<p>The land, when we first made it, appeared high, and formed a
confused jumble of hills and mountains. We steered along shore to
the northward, but were much retarded in our course by reason of
the swell from the N.E. At noon, on the 3rd of April<span class=
"pagenum">[April.<br>
Saturday 3.]</span>, Cape Farewell, which is the south point of
the entrance of the west side of the straits, bore E. by N. ½ N.
by the compass, three or four leagues distant. About eight
o'clock we entered the straits, and steered N.E. till midnight;
then brought-to till day-light, and had soundings from forty-five
to fifty-eight fathoms, sand and broken shells. <span class=
"pagenum">[Sunday 4.]</span>At day-light, made sail and steered
S.E. by E.; had light airs; Mount Egmont N.N.E. eleven or twelve
leagues, and Point Stephens S.E. ½ E. seven leagues. At noon,
Mount Egmont N. by E. twelve leagues; Stephens Island S.E. five
leagues. In the afternoon we put the dredge over-board in
sixty-five fathoms; but caught nothing except a few small
scallops, two or three oysters, and broken shells.</p>
<p>Standing to the eastward for Charlotte's Sound, with a light
breeze at N.W., in the morning on the 5th<span class=
"pagenum">[Monday 5.]</span>, Stephens Island bearing S.W. by W.
four leagues, we were taken a-back with a strong easterly gale,
which obliged us to haul our wind to the S.E. and work to
windward up under Port Jackson. The course from Stephens Island
to Point Jackson, is nearly S.E. by the compass, eleven leagues
distant, depth of water from forty to thirty-two fathoms, sandy
ground. As we stood off and on, we fired several guns, but saw no
signs of any inhabitants. In the afternoon, at half-past two,
o'clock, finding the tide set the ship to the westward, we
anchored with the coasting anchor in thirty-nine fathoms water,
muddy ground; Point Jackson S.E. ½ E. three leagues; the east
point of an inlet (about four leagues to the westward of Point
Jackson, and which appears to be a good harbour) S.W. by W. ½ W.
At eight P. M. the tide slackening, we weighed and made sail
(having while at anchor caught several fish with hook and line),
and found the tide to run to the westward, at the rate of two and
a half knots per hour. Standing to the east, we found no ground
at seventy fathoms, off Point Jackson N.N.W., two leagues. At
eight the next morning<span class="pagenum">[Tuesday 6.]</span>,
had the sound open; but the wind being down, it obliged us to
work up under the western shore, as the tide sets up strong
there, when it runs down in mid channel. At ten, the tide being
done, was obliged to come-to with the best bower in thirty-eight
fathoms, close to some white rocks, Point Jackson bearing N.W. ½
N.; the northernmost of the Brothers E. by S.; and the middle of
Entry Island (which lies on the north side of the straits) N.E.
We made 15° 30' East, variation in the straits. As we sailed up
the sound we saw the tops of high mountains covered with snow,
which remains all the year. When the tide slackened, we weighed
and sailed up the sound; and about five o'clock on the
7th<span class="pagenum">[Wednes.<br>
7.]</span>, anchored in Ship Cove, in ten fathoms water, muddy
ground, and moored the best bower to the N.N.E., and small to
S.S.W. In the night, we heard the howling of dogs, and people
hallooing on the east shore.</p>
<p>The two following days were employed in clearing a place on
Motuara Island for erecting our tents for the sick (having then
several on board much afflicted with the scurvy), the sail-makers
and coopers. On the top of the island was a post erected, by the
Endeavour's people, with her name and time of departure on
it.</p>
<p>On the 9th<span class="pagenum">[Friday 9.]</span>, we were
visited by three canoes with about sixteen of the natives; and to
induce them to bring us fish and other provisions, we gave them
several things, with which they seemed highly pleased. One of our
young gentlemen seeing something wrapt up in a better manner than
common, had the curiosity to examine what it was; and to his
great surprise found it to be the head of a man lately killed.
They were very apprehensive of its being forced from them; and
particularly the man who seemed most interested in it, whose very
flesh crept on his bones, for fear of being punished by us, as
Captain Cook had expressed his great abhorrence of this unnatural
act. They used every method to conceal the head, by shifting it
from one to another; and by signs endeavouring to convince us,
that there was no such thing amongst them, though we had seen it
but a few minutes before. They then took their leave of us, and
went on shore.</p>
<p>They frequently mentioned Tupia, which was the name of the
native of George's Island (or Otaheite), brought here by the
Endeavour, and who died at Batavia; and when we told them he was
dead, some of them seemed to be very much concerned, and, as well
as we could understand them, wanted to know whether we killed
him, or if he died a natural death. By these questions, they are
the same tribe Captain Cook saw. In the afternoon, they returned
again with fish and fern roots, which they sold for nails and
other trifles; though the nails are what they set the most value
on. The man and woman who had the head, did not come off again.
Having a catalogue of words in their language, we called several
things by name, which surprised them greatly. They wanted it
much, and offered a great quantity of fish for it.</p>
<p>Next morning<span class="pagenum">[Saturday 10.]</span>, they
returned again, to the number of fifty or sixty, with their chief
at their head (as we supposed), in five double canoes. They gave
us their implements of war, stone hatchets, and clothes, &amp;c.
for nails and old bottles, which they put a great value on. A
number of the head men came on board us, and it was with some
difficulty we got them out of the ship by fair means; but on the
appearance of a musket with a fixed bayonet, they all went into
their canoes very quickly. We were daily visited by more or less,
who brought us fish in great plenty for nails, beads, and other
trifles, and behaved very peaceably.</p>
<p>We settled the astronomer with his instruments, and a
sufficient guard, on a small island, that is joined to Motuara at
low water, called the Hippa, where there was an old fortified
town that the natives had forsaken. Their houses served our
people to live in; and, by sinking them about a foot inside, we
made them very comfortable. Having done this, we struck our tents
on the Motuara, and having removed the ship farther into the cove
on the west shore, moored her for the winter. We then erected our
tents near the river or watering-place, and sent ashore all the
spars and lumber off the decks, that they might be caulked; and
gave her a winter coat to preserve the hull and rigging. On the
11th of May<span class="pagenum">[May.<br>
Tuesday 11.]</span>, we felt two severe shocks of an earthquake,
but received no kind of damage. On the 17th, we were surprised by
the people firing guns on the Hippa, and having sent the boat, as
soon as she opened the sound, had the pleasure of seeing the
Resolution off the mouth of it. We immediately sent out the boats
to tow her in, it being calm. In the evening she anchored about a
mile without us; and next morning weighed and warped within us.
Both ships felt uncommon joy at our meeting, after an absence of
fourteen weeks.</p>
