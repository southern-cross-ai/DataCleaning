  <p class="first">
  THERE is a clause in one of the innumerable codes of law drawn up in
  France for the purpose of checking, or at least regulating, the practice of
  duelling, which proclaims it to be illegal to fight a duel on any question
  which may not be assessed at the money value of twopence-halfpenny. This
  limitation, modest as it appears, seems to have been too drastic for the
  tastes of the people to whom it was addressed, and the long roll of the
  single combats of the past contain many which could not possibly trace their
  origin to any question so weighty. The blend of the many high-spirited
  nations which go to make up the French people, of the Gaul, the Armorican,
  the Frank, the Burgundian, the Norman, the Goth, has produced a race who
  appear to have the combative spirit more highly developed than any other
  European nation. In spite of the incessant wars which make up the history of
  France, the record of private combat and bloodshed is an unbroken one,
  stretching back in a long red stream through the ages, sometimes narrow,
  sometimes broad, occasionally reaching such a flood as can only be ascribed
  to a passing fit of universal homicidal mania. Recent events have shown that
  this national tendency is still as strong as ever, and that there is every
  prospect that the duello, when driven from every other European country, may
  still find a home among a gallant people, whose solicitude for their honour
  makes them occasionally a trifle neglectful of their intelligence.</p>

  <p>The duello is undoubtedly in its origin a religious ceremony, and is the
  direct descendant of those judicial combats, where Providence was on the side
  of the sharpest lance and truest sword. To the fierce nations who overran the
  Roman Empire, such a doctrine was a congenial one, and, if they neglected all
  other precepts of the Christianity of the day, to this dogma of the sanctity
  of force they gave their warmest support. Germans, Franks, Goths, Vandals,
  and particularly Burgundians, turned the Deity into a supreme camp-marshal,
  presiding over their contests and adjudicating upon their disputes. From
  those distant centuries the clash of sword-blades rises louder than the
  murmur of prayer. Dimly we catch glimpses of struggling men; clad in chain
  armour and leather, who champion causes, now of less weight than the falling
  leaves, but then all-important in the minds of men. A gallant young
  Ingelgerius, early Count of Anjou, cuts off the head of a slanderous Gontran,
  and the honour of the Countess of Gaston is saved. Or the Queen Gundeberge is
  freed from all stain by the courteous and hard-hitting cousin, who smites the
  lying Adalulf to the earth. In these fierce ages the duel played a part often
  abused and yet not wholly useless. In the midst of chaos it started up as a
  law, a rule, if it were but an unreasoning and fickle one. It is clear at
  least that no injured lady need lack a champion -- more probable, indeed,
  that many champions were lacking an injured lady.</p>

  <p>Gradually, as chivalry sprang up and imposed its ordinances and modes of
  thought upon the upper classes, the single combat in search of honour came to
  supplement the judicial duel. For centuries they continue side by side. Young
  English knights with patches over their eyes, spur out from the ranks of
  armies and exchange thrusts with French cavaliers as hotheaded as themselves.
  The Scotchman Seaton rides up to the gates of Paris, and having, in
  accordance with his vow, hurtled and smashed for half an hour with all the
  French knights whom he can see, he withdraws at last with a courteous
  'Thanks, gentlemen; many thanks.' Thirty English must needs fight thirty
  Bretons at Ploermel and get well beaten for their pains. Seven other
  Englishmen have no better luck at Montendre. Everywhere in the public
  quarrel, as well as in private feud, there is the same tale of challenge and
  of acceptance.</p>

  <p>The chronicles of the combats of chivalry do not, however, entirely
  obscure those of the law. The well-known and dramatic contest between
  Montargis and the hound occurred when the fourteenth century was already
  drawing to a close. As late, however, as the year 1547 occurred the famous
  trial by contest between Chasteneraye and Jarnac which is at once one of the
  last and one of the best known of the series.</p>

  <p>Chasteneraye and Jarnac, both peers of France, had fallen out over the
  virtue of the latter's mother-in-law. The king had interested himself in the
  matter, and it was finally settled that the whole question should be referred
  to the arbitrament of arms. As it chanced, Chasteneraye was one of the first
  swordsmen in France, so that Jarnac exhausted his ingenuity in devising some
  abstruse and little-known weapon, by means of which he might be more on an
  equality with his adversary. The names of thirty such arms were drawn up and
  submitted to the judges, who, however, to Jarnac's despair, laid them all
  aside and decided upon the sword. In his difficulty he sought the advice of a
  tried old Italian swordsman, who bade him be of good heart, and confided to
  him a secret trick of swordsmanship devised by himself and never before
  taught to mortal man. Armed with this horrid ruse, Jarnac repaired to the
  scene of the encounter, where, in the presence of the king, Henry II., and
  all the high officials of the kingdom, the two litigants were put face to
  face. Chasteneraye, confident in his skill, pressed hotly upon the
  less-experienced Jarnac, when suddenly the latter, to the astonishment of the
  spectators, put in such a cut as had never before been seen and severed the
  tendon of his enemy's left leg. An instant later, by a repetition of the same
  stroke, he cut the sinew of the right one, and the unfortunate Chasteneraye
  fell hamstrung to the earth. In this sore plight he still continued upon his
  knees to make passes at his antagonist and to endeavour to carry on the
  combat. His sword, however, was quickly struck from his grasp, and he lay at
  the mercy of his conqueror. The wily Jarnac was disposed, very much against
  the customs of the time, to grant him his life; but the humiliation was too
  much for the beaten and crippled man, and, refusing all assistance, he
  allowed himself to bleed to death. The 'coup de Jarnac' in sword-play still
  remains as a memorial of this encounter.</p>

  <p>The actual duello, as we understand it, appears to have been an
  importation from Italy. During the fifty years which terminated with Francis
  I. the French troops had been quartered without intermission in Italy, and
  had brought back to their native country many of the least admirable traits
  of the Italians. An epidemic of bloodshed and murder broke out in France at
  the beginning of the sixteenth century. The life of Duprat, Baron of Vitaux,
  may be taken as typical of that of many another young high-born ruffian of
  the period. This interesting person has been named by Brantome 'the paragon
  of France,' so that the study of his life gives us an interesting opportunity
  of knowing the sort of man who won the applause of the populace at the latter
  end of the middle ages. While yet in his teens he slew the young Baron de
  Soupez, who had certainly given him some provocation by smiting him on the
  head with a candlestick. His next exploit was the death of a certain
  Gounelieu, with whom there had been a family quarrel. This deed led to his
  banishment, but he was speedily back again, and with two accomplices set upon
  the Baron de Mittaud and cut him to pieces in the streets of Paris. The
  king's favourite, Guart, ventured to oppose the calm request that Duprat
  should receive a free pardon for all these enormities. For this offence he
  was attacked in his own house and murdered by the young desperado. This crime
  proved, however, to be the last of his short but eventful life, for he was
  shortly afterwards slain himself by the brother of one of his former victims.
  'He was a very fine man,' says Brantome, 'though there were some who said
  that he did not kill his people properly' -- 'Il ne tuait pas bien ses gens.'
  The career of this ruffian marks the transition period when the regulated
  combats of chivalry had died out, but the stringent laws of the duello had
  not yet been formed.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, however, during the reign of
  Henry III., the duello began to conform to established rules. The foolish
  custom of seconds engaging in the quarrels of their principals had been
  introduced from Italy, and the single challenge led occasionally to a small
  battle. The encounter between Caylus and D'Entragues, two well-known
  courtiers, has been narrated at some length by the chroniclers. Riberac and
  Schomberg were seconds to D'Estragues, Maugerin and Livaret to Caylus.</p>

  <p>'Hadn't we better reconcile these gentlemen instead of allowing them to
  kill one another?' says Riberac to Maugerin. 'Sir,' replies the other, 'I did
  not come here to string beads, but to fight.'</p>

  <p>'And with whom?' asks Riberac.</p>

  <p>'With you, to be sure.'</p>

  <p>Instantly they flew at each other and ran each other through. Schomberg
  and Livaret in the meantime had come to blows, with the result that the
  former fell dead, while the latter was wounded in the face. Caylus meanwhile
  had been mortally wounded, and his opponent had received a sword-thrust. This
  single encounter ended, therefore, in the immediate death of four men, while
  the other two were badly crippled. Whatever charge might be levelled against
  the French duel of those days, it could not be said that the participants
  were not in earnest. In the reign of Henry IV. duelling reached its highest
  point. It has been estimated that during his reign no fewer than 4,000 nobles
  fell victims to the fashion. Chavalier narrates that in Limousin alone, in
  the space of seven months, 120 were actually killed. The smallest difference
  of opinion led to an appeal to arms. At no time would the remark of
  Montesquieu be more true, than if three Frenchmen had been set down in the
  Libyan desert, two would have instantly paired off, and the third resolved
  himself into a second.</p>

  <p>Strange use was made occasionally of the right of the challenged to fix
  upon the weapon which should be used, and the conditions under which the
  contest should be decided. Thus, we hear of a very small man who insisted
  upon his gigantic adversary wearing a stock or collar all girt round with
  spikes, so that, being unable to bend his neck, he was unable to keep his eye
  upon his little opponent. Another duellist insisted upon the use of a cuirass
  which had a little hole over the heart, he being well practised in that
  particular thrust. Unfair as such conditions might seem they at least gave
  the advantage to the challenged, and so made it a more serious matter to fix
  a quarrel upon a man.</p>

  <p>Now and then a man arose so brave that he dared to refuse to fight.
  Monsieur de Reuly, a young officer in the army, quoted the law of God and of
  man as a reason for his refusal. His adversary, however, under the impression
  that he had a poltroon to deal with, lay in wait for him in the street with a
  friend and set upon him. The young officer, however, ran them both through
  the body, and so vindicated his right to remain at peace.</p>

  <p>Lord Herbert of Cherbury, our ambassador at the court of Louis XIII., was
  himself a noted duellist, and has recorded some interesting examples of the
  favour in which the practice was held in French society. 'All things being
  ready for the ball,' says he, 'and everyone being in their place and I myself
  next to the queen, expecting when the dancers would come in, one knocked at
  the door somewhat louder than became, I thought, a very civil person: when he
  came in there was, I remember, a sudden whisper among the ladies, saying,
  "C'est Monsieur Balaguy." Whereupon I also saw the ladies and gentlemen, one
  after the other, invite him to sit near them: and what is more, when one lady
  had his company a while, another would say, "You have enjoyed him long
  enough, I must have him now." At which bold civility of them, though I was
  astonished, yet it added to my wonder that his person could not be thought at
  most but ordinary handsome: his hair, which was cut very short, half grey:
  his doublet but of sackcloth cut to his skin, and his breeches but of plain
  grey cloth. Informing myself by some by-standers who he was, I was told that
  he was one of the gallantest men in the world, as having killed eight or nine
  men in single fight, and that for that reason the ladies made so much of him:
  it being the manner of all French women to cherish gallant men, as thinking
  they could not make so much of any one else with safety of their honour.' A
  little later we find Lord Herbert himself endeavouring to fix a quarrel on
  this same Balaguy, but without the success which his efforts deserved. His
  picture, however, of the sombre duellist moving about among the gay dresses
  of the ball-room is a vivid one.</p>

  <p>Of this epoch, too, was De Boutteville, famous for his innumerable duels
  and interminable moustaches. 'Do you still think of life?' said the Bishop of
  Nantes as he ascended the scaffold which he had so often deserved. 'I think
  only of my moustaches -- the finest in France,' answered the doomed
  desperado.</p>

  <p>Louis XIV. endeavoured, and with some success, to limit the pernicious
  habit. His far-reaching ambitions could only be attained through the blood of
  his subjects, and he grudged every life which was sacrificed in any but the
  public quarrel. Indeed, through his long reign there was so much work for the
  rapiers of his <i>noblesse</i> over the frontiers that the most pugnacious of
  them must have found his thirst for strife more than gratified.</p>

  <p>Yet in spite of edict and penalty we find the practice still full of
  vitality. Even the pacific La Fontaine fights a captain of dragoons because
  he visits his wife too often, and then, in a moment of repentance, wishes to
  fight him again because he refuses to visit her. In this reign, too, the
  gallant one-legged Marquis de Rivard, when challenged by a person of the name
  of Madaillon, sent his adversary a case of surgical instruments, with an
  intimation that he was ready to meet him as soon as he had placed himself on
  an equal footing with him.</p>

  <p>During the dissolute reign of Louis XV. duelling flourished as merrily as
  ever. Within the very precincts of the palace, and at midday on the quay of
  the Tuileries, there were fatal encounters. Financiers encroached on the
  time-honoured privileges of the <i>noblesse</i>, and the Scotchman Law, of
  Mississippi fame, was as skilful with his weapons as with his figures. The
  Duke de Richelieu, Du Vighan, St. Evremont, and St. Foix are among the most
  notorious fighting men of the day. The truculence of the last was modified by
  a vein of humour. On one occasion he received a challenge for having asked a
  gentleman why it was that he smelled so confoundedly. St. Foix, contrary to
  his usual habit, refused the invitation. 'Were you to slay me it would not
  make you smell any sweeter,' said he, 'whereas if I were to slay you, you
  would smell worse that ever.'</p>

  <p>The short and disastrous reign of Louis XVI. produced at least two
  remarkable duellists, the petticoated Chevalier d'Eon, and the mulatto St.
  George. D'Eon died in London as late as 1810, and though there was no doubt
  as to his true sex, no satisfactory reason was ever given for the whim which
  made him for nearly a quarter of a century attire himself in women's clothes.
  The black St. George was at once the best fencer and the best pistol shot of
  his day, and won his reputation in many meetings. In spite of his fame as a
  duellist he is said to have been a very inoffensive man and to have avoided
  quarrels as far as he might. One of the most wholesale challenges on record
  dates from this period, when the Marquis de Tenteniac, being rebuked for
  sitting too far forward at the wings, considered himself to be slighted by
  the audience. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' said he, 'with your permission a piece
  will be performed to-morrow called "The insolence of the pit chastised," in
  as many acts as may be desired, by the Marquis de Tenteniac.' The peaceable
  pit took no notice of the bellicose nobleman's challenge.</p>

  <p>The terrible wars of Napoleon put an end to duelling for the time, but the
  restoration brought it forward again with renewed vigour. What with social
  quarrels, the political rancour between the Buonapartists and the
  Legitimists, and the international feud between Frenchmen and the troops
  occupying France, there was seldom so fine a field for the man who wished to
  pick a quarrel. On the one hand the old officers of Napoleon were driven to
  frenzy by the sight of the officers of the allied armies in their capital,
  and endeavoured to avenge their defeat in the battlefield by their prowess in
  the Bois de Boulogne. On the other the young Bourbonist courtiers were ready
  to answer with rapier stab and pistol bullet to the reproach that for the
  sake of a dynasty they had sacrificed their country.</p>

  <p>Count Gronow in his interesting reminiscences gives a lively picture of
  the Paris of the day. International duels were things of daily occurrence,
  and generally terminated in favour of the Frenchman as being more skilled in
  the use of weapons. Their hatred was most bitter against the Prussians, and
  without the formalities of the duel it was no uncommon thing for a group of
  French officers to go down to the Caf? Foy, in the Palais Royal, which was
  the usual Prussian rendezvous, for the purpose of having a general struggle
  with its inmates. In one of these contests as many as fourteen Prussians and
  ten Frenchmen was slain outright. The English lost many promising young
  officers at this time in Paris. Gronow, however, who was present at the time,
  gives many instances where the result was in the favour of our countrymen. In
  the south, at Bordeaux, where the Frenchmen came across the Garonne for the
  express purpose of insulting our officers, they lost so many men that they at
  last gave up the practice. Dr. Millingen, whose work upon duelling is a
  storehouse of information upon the subject, was himself at Bordeaux at the
  time, and has given some details as to these encounters. The French,
  according to this authority, were incomparably the better swordsmen, but the
  young Englishmen, relying upon their superior bodily strength, would throw
  themselves upon their antagonists with such a supreme disregard for the
  science of the thing that they not unfrequently succeeded in cutting down
  their bewildered opponents.</p>

  <p>That the duello has immense vitality in France is evidenced by the fact
  that it succeeded in surviving its adoption by the lower orders during the
  twenty years which followed Waterloo. What the edicts of kings could not
  abolish ran a great risk of dying of ridicule when rival grocers took to
  calling each other out, and a bath-keeper sent a cartel to a crockeryware man
  for having sold him a damaged stove. Nor were these plebian encounters less
  earnest occasionally than those of warriors or statesmen. At Douai a brazier
  and a woollendraper were both left dead upon the ground after an encounter
  with sabres. All disputes of every sort were reduced to the same foolish
  arbitrament. We hear of critics firing four shots at each other in order to
  decide the relative merits of the classical and the romantic schools of
  fiction. Dumas fights Gaillardet the playright, and in endeavouring to decide
  the authorship of one drama runs a risk of being an actor in another.
  Finally, at Bordeaux, we have a case of a captain of dragoons going out with
  an old-clothesman, and narrowly escaping lynching at the hands of the
  infuriated Israelites.</p>

  <p>The well-known duel between M. Dulong and General Bugeaud may be taken as
  a final example of the brutality and folly inseparable from the custom.
  Dulong was a peaceable lawyer and a member of the House of Deputies. Bugeaud
  was a soldier and a famous pistol-shot. Dulong in his capacity as member of
  the legislative body ventures to make some adverse criticism in the house and
  is instantly challenged by the fire-eater. In vain he protests that no
  personal allusion was intended. He must go out or be under a social ban. Out
  they go accordingly, and the trained pistol-shot kills his civilian opponent
  before the latter discharges his weapon. Such a result still leaves us facing
  the difficulty which occurred to the Oxford mathematician on reading
  'Paradise Lost.' What is proved by that successful shot, and how it affects
  the original dispute, must ever remain a mystery.</p>

  <p>An Englishman can scarcely be censorious when he speaks of the duels of
  the past, for his own chronicles are too often stained by encounters as
  desperate as any across the Channel. The time at last has come, however, when
  the duel is as much an anachronism in our own country, and in the settled
  states of the Union, as judicial torture or the burning of witches. Only when
  France has attained the same position can she claim to be on a par with the
  Anglo-Saxon nations in the quality of her civilisation.</p>
