  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. FOREWORD &mdash; THE STAGE IS SET</h2>

  <p class="first">THIS is a biography in the form of a novelette, such a tale
  as our grandparents might have read in the pages of <i>The Family Herald</i>.
  The material refused to take any other form.</p>

  <p>In this there is perhaps little to arouse the emotions, to stir compassion
  or sympathy, but there is much to provoke an intense curiosity and that kind
  of excitement we feel when gazing at something most extraordinary. For, after
  all, this is not a novelette, but a truthful chronicle. No detail has been
  set down that is not taken from the contemporary records of the <i>ténébreuse
  affaire Lafarge</i>. And what ample records they are! What countless pages of
  memoirs, letters, what endless newspaper articles, what sheaves of verses,
  <i>morceaux</i>, reports, <i>dossiers</i>, shorthand accounts of
  cross-examinations, protestations and recriminations were evoked by this
  puzzle, this enigma, this strange, fantastic romance.</p>

  <p>Yet when all this vast amount of material is selected, sifted, arranged so
  as to form a coherent story, it shapes itself, fact as it all is, into a
  <i>feuilleton</i> of the most lurid and tawdry description. There is hardly a
  character in this case about whom it could not reasonably be
  argued&mdash;"such a person never existed"&mdash;hardly an event of which it
  could not be reasonably said&mdash;"such a thing could never have
  happened."</p>

  <p>Yet seldom have characters or events been better authenticated, better
  documented, for this was a case that excited the whole of France for years,
  and every scrap of evidence concerning it was carefully treasured. You may
  not believe in these people, but you are forced to admit that once they
  existed; you may refuse to credit these events, but you must acknowledge that
  once they took place. There it all is in black and white, in judicial files,
  in the reports of journalists, in the letters that these men and women wrote
  to one another, never suspecting that other persons would ever look at their
  passionate correspondence.</p>

  <p>France has richly contributed to the annals of crime; not only are French
  misdeeds in themselves highly exciting, uncommon and grotesque, but the
  French methods of investigation, trial, report and punishment of crime are
  highly satisfactory&mdash;at least to the curious in these matters.</p>

  <p>These long, patient, exhaustive examinations, conducted not only in open
  court but between the suspect and the examining magistrate in private, so
  carefully reported and arranged in these vast <i>dossiers</i>, allow almost
  exact reconstructions of French crimes and mysteries. There is also something
  extremely piquant in observing the cold, logical, keen and merciless mind of
  the French magistrate or lawyer pitted against the dramatic emotionalism,
  usually varied by cynic hauteur, of the prisoner; conflicting aspects of the
  national character usually provoke a common fury that involves judge, jury,
  lawyers, accused and witnesses in clouds of angry rhetoric. The drama, exotic
  to us, of these trials is considerably heightened if the accused be a woman
  and her alleged offence murder. French female criminals are most remarkable;
  not all of them are interesting save in the briefest outline.</p>

  <p>Marie Boyer, daughter of a respectable merchant, educated in a convent,
  wishes to become a nun, weeps bitterly when, at her father's death, her
  mother fetches her home. She is described as "small, dark, very pretty and
  dainty." Her mother has a lover, a young scoundrel named Vitalis; he wins the
  affection of Marie, who is fifteen years of age. After two years, they plan
  to murder Mme. Boyer; she is a bore with her jealousy and they want her
  money. Vitalis commits the crime with his hands and a knife in the presence
  and with the assistance of the dainty Marie. They dismember the body between
  them and take it in parcels to a ditch outside the town. Clumsy inattention
  to detail causes their arrest; Marie, escaping with life imprisonment,
  becomes a model penitent, even saintly, "cannot think how she came to be so
  misled"; her conduct is so exemplary that she is released after twelve years,
  still young, still elegant and modest.</p>

  <p>This Léon Vitalis, then, possessed Satanic beauty, fascination, great
  gifts of mind and body? Not at all. The reporters at the trial noted that he
  was mean-looking, stooped, was physically weak and had a livid, bilious
  complexion.</p>

  <p>Gabrielle Ferrayrou, a good-looking, middle-class woman "of a superior
  education," devoted to her two children, married to a coarse, brutal chemist,
  twenty years her senior, takes Louis Aubert, his assistant, aged twenty-one,
  as a lover. Upon her husband's discovering the intrigue, Gabrielle
  agrees&mdash;"for fear of losing her children"&mdash;to help him murder the
  lover. After elaborate precautions the wretched youth is lured by the woman
  to a lonely house, where she assists the husband to murder him. Afterwards
  the pair take the body in a goat-chaise to the river and lower it from the
  bridge with a rope; they are assisted by Ferrayrou's brother Lucien. Then
  they go to the station cafe for drinks. Madame Gabrielle feels, she
  afterwards declared, <i>très émotionnée</i>.</p>

  <p>When the crime was discovered this woman turned informer against her
  husband, giving the police sufficient evidence to convict him and his brother
  of murder. She received a life sentence and became, through good conduct,
  head of one of the prison workshops; she was described as "affectionate,
  docile, with few material wants, an idealist who only required to be loved
  and understood."</p>

  <p>Gabrielle Bompard, seductive little swallow of the Paris
  pavements&mdash;"with a dozen lovers after her"&mdash;agrees with a chance
  admirer, Michel Eyraud, that a little more money would be pleasant, and
  arranges with him to decoy and murder the first likely-looking stranger. One
  Gouffé is the victim, and Gabrielle, the girl of twenty-two, spends the night
  alone in the flat with the body in a trunk while her accomplice is arranging
  their flight. "It was not very pleasant being left alone with a corpse," she
  pouted afterwards.</p>

  <p>She travelled with her lover and the body to Lyons, where the remains of
  Gouffé were thrown over a cliff, and the couple departed gaily for England
  and America with the spoils. When arrested she gave evidence "in a half
  amused way" and suggested that she might have been hypnotised.</p>

  <p>Such are the silhouettes of three French women-criminals; they arouse no
  desire for further investigation, they are freaks, grotesques, monsters, and
  there is no interest to be hoped for in tracing their dismal careers. Nor do
  they possess any mystery; they were convicted of crimes that they confessed
  to committing, they excited no sympathy in the intellectuals of their day,
  they had no champions and aroused no controversy; their dreary dramas were
  played out in a prosaic, matter-of-fact period, the latter half of the
  nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>Go back fifty years from this date; we are in a very different atmosphere,
  in full romanticism, in the early years of the Orléans King of the French,
  Louis-Philippe.</p>

  <p>It is a century ago, the Monarchy of July has endured six years, the son
  of Citizen Prince, Philippe-Egalité, contrives to rule over the people who
  beheaded his father. He only does so, however, by employing all the arts of
  corruption; the country is still shaken by the shocks of the revolution of
  1789, that bold essay in democracy which proved so costly a failure, and by
  the excitements of the unequalled military successes of the first Empire.
  Louis-Philippe represents a compromise; he is a Bourbon, but not of the elder
  branch. The legitimate King, Charles X, shivers amid the rigours of Holyrood
  and has an heir. Louis-Philippe has erased the lilies from his shield, is
  <i>bon bourgeois</i>, a family man with an umbrella and a roll of newspapers
  under his arm; he has been educated by his father's mistress, Madame de
  Sillery, in the Spartan principles of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. For all that, he
  is a Bourbon-Orleans, full of tricks and ambitions, unscrupulous,
  untrustworthy, incompetent in the nobler arts of government. To his own
  distress and even misfortune, his reign, which has been described as
  "eighteen years&mdash;nothing," is remarkable for an extraordinary number of
  sensational crimes.</p>

  <p>In the year of the revolution that puts the Duke of Orléans on the
  stripped throne of France, the old Prince de Condé, first Prince of the Blood
  after the royal family and one of the richest men in Europe, is found hanging
  to his own window-frame in his sumptuous <i>château</i> of Saint-Leu.
  Suicide! cry the Royalists. But sinister rumours begin to circulate. M. de
  Condé was under the dominion of his mistress, the English Sophie Dawes, and
  she is high in the friendship of the new King and Queen&mdash;her carriage
  often waits for her outside the <i>Palais-Royal</i>&mdash;moreover, the old
  man's huge fortune has gone to the King's son, M. de Nemours, with a fine
  slice for Sophie Dawes, Madame la baronne de Feuchères.</p>

  <p>It is known that M. de Condé wished to leave his money to the heir of the
  exiled Charles X, that he planned to escape from his mistress and from
  France. The reign begins badly with this huge scandal; an action is brought
  by the old Prince's heirs-at-law, Sophie Dawes is suspected of murder. But
  she is highly protected, the case is hushed up, the King, with great loss of
  reputation and prestige, has secured the Condé millions.</p>

  <p>While this affair is still amusing and agitating the public mind, another
  scandal rends France into two factions and sets the fashionable world
  agog.</p>

  <p>General the Baron de Morell, a hero of the Napoleonic wars, of noble
  birth, connected with some of the most famous names of France, holding a high
  position in the military school at Saumur, brings an action for the attempted
  rape and the attempted murder of his daughter against Lieutenant de la
  Roncière, son of another glorious veteran of the late wars, equally
  patrician, well-placed, respected, honoured.</p>

  <p>Great ladies, artists, poets, all the <i>beau monde</i> fight for places
  at this Parisian trial, even tearing the clothes off one another's backs in
  their eagerness to hear and to see this drama. The Press, rejoicing in
  new-found powers, "write-up" the case, Daumier draws sketches of all the
  characters, the foremost lawyers of the day are employed, the great and noble
  Berryer, Odilon Barrot, Chaix de l'Est-Ange&mdash;no accessories of melodrama
  are lacking.</p>

  <p>The Morell family have been persecuted by abusive, threatening, anonymous
  letters&mdash;eighteen in all; then Marie de Morell's main has been entered
  at night by a man who has beaten, wounded and abused her and escaped through
  the window. The letters are signed with the initials of Emile de la Roncière,
  and Marie declares that he was her "nocturnal visitor." All this the prisoner
  vehemently denies&mdash;two great families are in violent opposition and
  Paris is divided, the majority being partisans of "the angelic victim."</p>

  <p>Marie, after her distressing experience, has developed a painful illness;
  she lies in a trance all day and regains semi-consciousness only from twelve
  at night until four in the morning. In this state her evidence is taken; at
  midnight, into a court respectfully silent, the girl of seventeen is tenderly
  led; she sinks into an easy chair, her eyes are closed, her beautiful
  features barely visible behind the veils and ribbons of her fashionable
  bonnet; she answers in a drowsy voice the questions of the judge and the
  lawyers. Death is the penalty for rape or attempted rape, the prisoner is
  young, handsome, elegant, with a Byronic reputation&mdash;could any
  <i>affaire</i> be more exciting, more delicious?</p>

  <p>Everyone agrees that there is an "atmosphere of Satan" about the case. The
  anonymous letters are frequently described as "Satanic." One of them begins:
  "<i>I am neither man nor woman, neither demon nor angel...</i>" When it is
  read aloud a delightful shudder goes through the densely packed spectators;
  one expects hopefully "<i>des horreurs</i>."</p>

  <p>It is agreed that no theatre has ever offered a moment of more poignant
  drama than that when Marie de Morell throws back her veil, gazes across the
  court at the graceful figure of the prisoner (the reporters note his "sensual
  mouth," his "<i>petites moustaches</i>") and says in low yet steady accents:
  "<i>C'est lui!</i>"</p>

  <p>The feminine portion of the audience clasp one another's hands
  convulsively&mdash;what could be more emotional, more romantic! It is pure
  Byron, pure Walter Scott, it is a novel by Lamartine, by George Sand&mdash;it
  is completely <i>à la mode</i>.</p>

  <p>It is also something else, though few see what, and those few dare not
  speak frankly; even the defence does not venture to do more than respectfully
  hint at a possibility that no one can really be expected to credit. In this
  atmosphere of acute emotionalism the voice of reason is stifled.</p>

  <p>There is, however, the evidence of the experts; four of them declare "the
  Satanic letters" to be not in the handwriting of Emile de la Roncière, but in
  that of Marie de Morell clumsily disguised. The paper on which they are
  written is similar to that of her lesson books&mdash;an uncommon make. No one
  has seen these letters delivered; the last was sent after La Roncière was in
  prison; while driving in a carriage with her mother the girl suddenly
  produced it, saying it had been thrust into her hand, which was hanging
  outside the window. Experts say that it would have taken three men to put a
  ladder against the girl's window in order to enter her room; no one saw or
  heard the intruder, no one but a young English governess knew of the outrage
  until the next morning when the parents were told. The alleged wounds were so
  slight that the girl was dancing at a ball in high spirits three days
  later.</p>

  <p>The girl had before been discovered writing anonymous letters and telling
  romantic lies, her mother had had to reprove her for secret novel-reading;
  she was periodically subject to hallucinations, trances and <i>crises de
  nerfs</i>. She had said she found one of the letters pinned on a
  wall&mdash;it was impossible, the wall was of stone.</p>

  <p>La Roncière has an alibi for "the fatal night"&mdash;three respectable
  people testify to his being in his lodging; the front door of this house is
  locked all night. Marie declares that her assailant wore a red military
  cap&mdash;no such cap is known at Saumur, all the military headgear is blue;
  challenged on this point, the girl says "she may have been mistaken." The
  glass of her broken window is outside, on the sloping roof. She is not
  examined medically until three months after the alleged outrage; the doctors
  then find her in perfect health&mdash;no sign of wounds or of the maternity
  the letters threatened, nor of any "outrage."</p>

  <p>Of what use is this clear evidence?</p>

  <p>It is indignantly rejected by the vast majority&mdash;the Morells are
  furious. What, suspect this pure young virgin of sixteen years of age of
  these vile "Satanic" letters, of these low coarse words, of such thoughts, of
  such a plot?</p>

  <p>So innocent and ignorant is this maiden who is convent-bred, who has never
  read anything but the Bible (and a few smuggled novels), that her mother has
  never dared to ask her what really happened on that terrible night. "I have
  respected her sixteen years," says the noble matron dramatically in the
  witness-box to a murmur of sympathy.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen, the governess, who found the girl on the floor bound "lightly
  with a handkerchief and a cord" and heard her first version of the story, is
  overcome by "English prudery" when giving evidence, so one hardly knows what
  the young man is accused of: "...he tore off my chemise, scratched me, jumped
  on me and said&mdash;'that will do for her,'" declares the entranced Marie,
  and almost everyone believes her, despite the experts, despite common
  sense.</p>

  <p>It is argued that her strange illness has been brought on by the shock of
  her terrible experiences&mdash;the doctors declare that in the intervals
  between her attacks of trance and convulsions she is entirely reliable,
  clear-headed and intelligent.</p>

  <p>No one sees that "the noble and innocent victim" suffers from acute
  hysteria, that she is a pathological liar, in modern jargon "a schyzophrene"
  (dweller in fantasy), that she has abnormal erotic sensibility, that the
  letters, far from being "Satanic," are merely silly, that they concern only
  sex and that there is nothing in them that a cunning schoolgirl could not
  have made herself acquainted with&mdash;even to the "bad words" easily
  overheard in a garrison town&mdash;that their style is that of a clumsy copy
  of Lamartine, George Sand or Scott.</p>

  <p>No one inquires into the character and history of Miss Allen, "who always
  has a Bible in her hand," who is "very pretty" and twenty-three years of age.
  These two girls have been much alone, the charming, popular mother is often
  occupied with her social duties. No one asks what these girls talked of, what
  books they contrived to procure, if they discussed the young officers by whom
  they were surrounded. There can be no cross-examination on such subjects;
  these are well-bred <i>jeunes filles</i>, they know nothing, see nothing,
  hear nothing&mdash;they are pure to the point of negation. No, Paris prefers
  to believe in the fiendish young man who is half a demon, who belongs to a
  dreadful secret society, "The Bare Arms," who has vowed to work evil for
  evil's sake.</p>

  <p>Marvellous romances of his former life are concocted&mdash;what numerous
  mistresses he has had, what bloody duels, what desperate gamblings, what
  sinister appearances and disappearances he has indulged in! How sardonic his
  black eyes, his full lips, his pallor! Is it possible that he is the Comte
  Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, or even the Wandering Jew? In reality Emile de la
  Roncière is a poor devil of a lieutenant who has behaved like all his
  comrades, who has quarrelled with his father about outrunning his allowance,
  who has the usual little sweetheart, who is very clever with his hands and
  likes to draw, to embroider and to make bedroom slippers. He swears, "with
  tears," that he has hardly noticed Marie de Morell, and that the letters seem
  to him "those of a lunatic."</p>

  <p>All useless; he is found guilty, with extenuating circumstances. This last
  absurdity means that the jury are not quite sure of themselves&mdash;there
  might have been some truth in what those experts said, after all!</p>

  <p>Lieutenant de la Roncière gets ten years for attracting the immature
  passion of an hysterical girl, and Marie de Morell's problems are solved by a
  husband and a large family. She is, however, all her life under treatment for
  hysteria.</p>

  <p>Then an English lawyer, Lord Abinger (Sir James Scarlett), a German
  doctor, Mathieu, come forward; the distracted father works frantically for
  his son, public opinion hesitates, veers, one learns a little more about the
  complications of hysteria. The case is "reconsidered," and after several
  years of prison the unhappy La Roncière is released, restored to his military
  rank, given a high colonial post, decorated.</p>

  <p>The two old fathers, heart-broken, retire and die in seclusion, each
  bitterly struck in his pride, his honour, his affection, his dignity.</p>

  <p>Protected by money, rank, sentiment, influential relatives and friends, in
  particular by Maréchal Soult, Marie de Morell escapes even censure; no one
  ventures to suggest that, if this dangerous woman is responsible for her
  actions, she should be tried for perjury, that if irresponsible, she should
  be kept under medical care.</p>

  <p>She has done her utmost to send an innocent man to the guillotine, and if
  there is anything "Satanic" in the case it is her cold cruelty, so often the
  accompaniment of abnormal erotic sensibility.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Meanwhile Paris&mdash;all France&mdash;is excited by another dramatic
  enigma that plunges the romantics, the intellectuals into wild excitement and
  greatly troubles the King himself.</p>

  <p>Again the prisoner is a man, the victim of a woman, but this time a dead
  woman. Her character, conduct and love affairs form, however, the pivot on
  which the case turns.</p>

  <p>Two years after La Roncière had disappeared into prison, the elegant and
  famous Gavarni (Paul-Sulpice), celebrated for his sketches and caricatures of
  Parisian life published in <i>Les Gens du Monde and Charivari</i>, and one of
  the leading figures in the artistic life of the capital, received by express
  from Bourg, a provincial town near the frontiers of Savoy, a desperate appeal
  from an old friend, a colleague, Sébastien-Benoît Peytel&mdash;"Help, my
  friend, and quickly!"</p>

  <p>Peytel was in prison on a charge of a triple murder; the circumstances
  were dramatic, the <i>mise en scène</i> romantic, the whole affair
  mysterious, exciting. Gavarni threw himself into it with fervour and ran
  about Paris enlisting the sympathy and the help of all Peytel's friends and
  acquaintances; among them were such famous men as Honoré Balzac, Alphonse de
  Lamartine, father of the "romantics," Emile de Girardin, Henri Berthoud and
  Louis Desnoyers.</p>

  <p>This Peytel came from Macon; he had been educated for the law, but instead
  of practising it he tried his fortune in Paris. He achieved some success in
  journalism and quickly made lifelong friends of some of the best minds of the
  day; he was what we should term "modern," what he called <i>contemporain</i>,
  and his acrid, shrewd and effective style was chiefly employed in attacking,
  in the traditional manner of the young intellectual, all existing
  institutions. Louis-Philippe, under the symbol of "The Pear" (<i>La
  Poire</i>), was one of Peytel's favourite butts, and some of these satires
  were considered very successful.</p>

  <p>Before the revolution of 1830, he had brought out several literary
  journals, printed on rose-coloured paper&mdash;<i>Le Sylphe, Le Trilby, Le
  Lutin</i>; after this date he purchased, with Balzac, shares in <i>Le
  Voleur</i>; he helped to edit this and wrote the theatrical reviews. A daring
  pamphlet against the King made him popular with the wits of the
  <i>boulevards</i>, but not only did he earn nothing by his journalistic
  enterprises, they ate up a considerable portion of his modest patrimony.</p>

  <p>At the age of thirty Peytel decided to return to the law and to purchase a
  provincial legal practice; he chose that of one Maître Cerdon, notary public
  at Belley, in the valley of the Rhône near the Savoy borders. Proposed public
  works, a new bridge, a new road, a steamboat on the Rhône, promised some
  profitable work in this far-away spot, and Peytel agreed to pay M. Cerdon
  forty thousand francs for his practice&mdash;a high price for the place and
  the period. To meet these expenses, Peytel looked out for an heiress, and
  soon found one&mdash;a girl of twenty years of age, Félice Alcazar, who was
  staying at Belley with her sister, Madame Montrichard, wife of the Commandant
  of the <i>gendarmerie</i> of the district.</p>

  <p>Félice was a white Creole from Port-d'Espagne, of a good family of Spanish
  extraction; she was ill-educated, spoilt, indolent, petulant and greedy to a
  disgusting extent. All these defects had a common origin; the girl was nearly
  blind, she could not get up and downstairs or cut her food without
  assistance. She was, however, "coquette," and had contrived to imbibe many of
  the romantic notions of the period; <i>ni laide, ni jolie</i>, this feeble
  creature had few attractions beyond her dowry, which was considerable.</p>

  <p>She brought her husband property in Gibraltar, shares in an English
  business, an annual income of two thousand francs, one hundred and eighty
  francs in French government bonds, and a floating capital of eight thousand
  five hundred francs. They were married in May, 1838; Lamartine, Gavarni,
  Desnoyers and Berthoud signed the register as witnesses.</p>

  <p>At first Peytel and his wife lived with a married sister, Madame Casimir
  Broussis, at Bourg, near Belley, then at Belley itself with the Montrichards.
  In the autumn they were in Peytel's native town of Mâcon, and by the end of
  October he was ready to go to Belley again to take up official residence as
  notary public. He travelled in a one-horse covered carriage (<i>phaéton à
  soufflet</i>) with his wife, and was followed by a baggage cart that
  contained a considerable sum of money as well as luggage; the horse that drew
  this was led by Peytel's young servant, Louis Rey, an ex-soldier of excellent
  character whom he had obtained from his brother-in-law, Lieutenant
  Montrichard.</p>

  <p>Because of long delays at each stage this cavalcade did not reach the last
  stretch of the journey&mdash;that between Roussillon and Belley&mdash;until
  eleven o'clock at night, when a frightful storm of wind and rain was added to
  the darkness and the wildness of the lonely road that wound, between rocks,
  lakes and precipices, through a gorge known as <i>la montée de la Darde</i>
  to a bridge called the <i>Pont d'Andert</i> over the river Furand.</p>

  <p>Well beyond this bridge stood the lonely cottage and forge of a
  blacksmith, one Termet. In the fields beyond the ravine were a few scattered
  farms, but no spot in a civilised country could have been more desolate,
  especially on this night&mdash;All Saints' Eve&mdash;of violent tempest.</p>

  <p>Amid the howling of the wind and the lashing of the rain the son of Joseph
  Termet heard a knocking at their door; the youth called his father and the
  two gazed cautiously from the window; some ragged moonbeams revealed a closed
  <i>phaéton</i>, the horse led by a gentleman who declared that he was Maître
  Peytel, the new notary at Belley, that his wife had just been murdered by his
  servant and that he wanted help to take her into Belley.</p>

  <p>The two Termets accompanied Peytel to the road over the Darde, and there
  the body of Félice was found face downwards by the roadside in wet muslins
  and broken hat, horribly disfigured and half-submerged in a flooded field.
  When this corpse had been placed in the <i>phaéton</i>, Peytel directed the
  carriage towards Belley, but, after a few yards, drew up to point out to the
  blacksmith another body in the middle of the road. It was that of Louis Rey,
  his brains beaten in with a hammer; Peytel tried to drive over the corpse
  and, when prevented, explained laconically that "ce brigand" had shot Madame
  Peyel and that he in revenge had killed him with a geologist's hammer that he
  carried.</p>

  <p>When the <i>phaéton</i> arrived at Belley, Peytel sprang out, knocked up
  the principal citizens and again told his frightful story to the doctor and
  magistrate. The former could not help Félice&mdash;she was already cold, with
  two pistol balls in her head. The little town of five thousand inhabitants
  was soon in a state of commotion, into the midst of which wandered the horse
  with the baggage wagon seeking his stable. Lieutenant Wolff of the
  <i>gendarmerie</i> soon appeared on the scene and listened sceptically to the
  tale of the dreadful events in the gorge of the Darde.</p>

  <p>"All very well," was his comment, "but three went out and one returns. I
  arrest you, monsieur."</p>

  <p>Such was the plight of Sébastien Peytel when he wrote his appeal to
  Gavarni. The ex-journalist's friends were soon up in arms, and his foremost
  champion was Balzac, once his co-editor on <i>Le Voleur</i>.</p>

  <p>The preliminary enquiries, so important in French legal cases, were wholly
  unfavourable to Peytel. His story of the night of November 1st was proved,
  upon investigation, to be false. However Madame Peytel and Louis Rey had
  died, it had not been in the way in which Peytel declared they had. The
  career of the servant was discovered to be blameless; this foundling, without
  relatives, was a jolly, pleasant, industrious fellow, liked by all who had
  known him. Peytel's money affairs were bad, he had caused his wife to make a
  will in his favour, he had inserted in the marriage contract a clause, which
  the wife's notary had overlooked, that left him the master of her capital.
  Worse, a paper was found in Félice's writing confessing to miserable
  behaviour&mdash;some unspecified misconduct&mdash;and this was proved to be
  the half-blind girl's tracing in ink over her husband's pencilling. Worst of
  all, Mme. Peytel was, at the time of her murder, a few months from
  motherhood, and if she had had a child nothing could have prevented it from
  inheriting her fortune.</p>

  <p>The six months' married life of the Peytels had been a wretched
  affair&mdash;the girl had been wilful, lazy, greedy, childish, but the man
  had been violent, brutal; his "scenes" had often reduced his partner to panic
  fright; she had never liked him and had lately come to regard him with
  physical repulsion.</p>

  <p>In view of these facts it might have been reasonably supposed that Peytel
  had destroyed his unwanted wife and child, and then the servant, in order to
  put the blame on this victim. So far the story was sordid enough, but all the
  evidence (of which there was a great deal) pointed to the guilt of Peytel and
  to motives of cupidity, and, perhaps, a furious exasperation against a
  tiresome fool who was in the way. But the "romantic" element so popular at
  the time soon appeared; when Peytel was first arrested he exclaimed to
  Lieutenant Wolff&mdash;"You do not know all my misfortunes&mdash;my wife and
  my servant were lovers!" He afterwards denied having said this and treated
  any doubt of his wife's fidelity with offended scorn.</p>

  <p>But when Gavarni visited him in prison, Peytel threw himself into his
  friend's arms and whispered "a secret." Gavarni never revealed this, but
  allowed it to be assumed that it was what Peytel had already told Wolff. The
  artist dashed back to Paris, told Balzac "the secret," and the two friends
  returned to Bourg post-haste. On the road the novelist indulged in some
  innocent publicity; at the first relay, he said to the postilion: "Ah, my
  friend, make haste! I can earn a hundred francs a day, this gentleman fifty
  francs, so you see how this loss of time ruins us!" The sums rose at every
  stage until Balzac was a self-confessed millionaire by the time he reached
  Bourg.</p>

  <p>The novelist heard Peytel's story, believed it, and took up the case with
  all the full glow of that creative imagination so detrimental to the
  discovery of the truth. He visited the scene of the crime and was greatly
  impressed with the lonely gloom of the <i>montée</i> of the Darde. Yes, the
  rich colours of romanticism were here! The scenery of rock, abyss, lake and
  winding road was "Satanic," like that of the infernal regions. What a
  splendid setting for a crime of passion! Here Peytel, "essentially good,"
  fiery, sensitive, proud, had destroyed the two base creatures who had "soiled
  his name"&mdash;and then tried to save the miserable woman's "honour" by a
  noble lie. Or had the guilty lovers tried to murder and rob the husband and
  been killed by Peytel in self-defence?</p>

  <p>Balzac was not quite sure, but he returned to Paris and dashed off a
  <i>brochure</i> in defence of Peytel that contained such a severe attack on
  Félice that her brother-in-law entered the field to protect her memory. In
  Balzac's imagination the murdered woman was "horrible, low, mean,
  disgusting," she had "stooped to the embraces of a slave" and deserved even
  the terrible punishment that she had received.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Peytel had been put on his trial for murder. He appeared
  fashionably dressed, his black hair "cast back in the <i>mode</i>," his heavy
  whiskers carefully trimmed, his air haughty and aloof. Under
  cross-examination he showed that verbal dexterity which exasperates without
  convincing; his attitude towards the law was extremely insolent. He was
  fortified, not only by the knowledge of the exertions of Gavarni and Balzac,
  but by an enthusiastic letter on his behalf written by Lamartine, the French
  Byron.</p>

  <p>There were suggestions that Peytel had been a little "Byronic"
  himself&mdash;that he used a skull as a drinking vessel and so on; neither
  this atmosphere of romantic gloom, however, nor his "Manfred" air in the dock
  impressed a provincial jury; he was found guilty and sentenced to death, to
  the amazement and rage of his friends. Gavarni, generous and impulsive,
  Balzac, warmhearted and opinionated, used every effort for a reopening of the
  case that became more and more obscured by theatricalisms.</p>

  <p>Peytel spent his time in writing verses, memoirs, letters, sonnets to his
  friends, accounts of his youth&mdash;anything as long as he scribbled
  something. Like the Girondins, he was ready to write on the steps of the
  guillotine; he belonged to that class of pseudo-intellectuals which, without
  talent, must be continually expressing their own nullity of heart and mind
  All Peytel's output was banal and coloured by the literary fashion of his
  time; his style so enervated his thought that nothing of interest is to be
  found in this outpouring written in such horrible circumstances.</p>

  <p>But Peytel, as the date of his death drew near, did pen one poignant
  document; it was a letter to Gavarni. The prisoner was not allowed to write
  to anyone or see anyone, but he enclosed this letter in another and contrived
  to cast it out of his cell window. A passer-by picked it up outside the
  prison walls. The covering letter contained a passionate appeal to the
  stranger who might find the letter not to read the inner epistle&mdash;"if
  you do, you will violate an important secret"&mdash;but to post it at once to
  Gavarni in Paris.</p>

  <p>The finder of the letter had the charity to carry out the instructions and
  Gavarni duly received the desperate document. This was long, half-incoherent,
  and in places unintelligible; it referred to Peytel in the third person and
  was obviously written in a state of despair. It contained no confession, but
  many complaints of the conduct of the trial, a hint that his pamphlet against
  the King might injure him now, and minute instructions for a large quantity
  of opium to be smuggled into his cell within the lining of the covers of a
  Bible.</p>

  <p>Gavarni sent this letter, secretly and direct, to the King. Louis-Philippe
  was greatly disturbed&mdash;"he neither ate nor slept for forty- eight
  hours." He always signed a death sentence with great reluctance, and in this
  case his instinct was to be magnanimous towards the man who had once libelled
  him. But after an exhaustive personal examination of the evidence the King,
  who had a shrewd, well-trained mind, could find no justification for saving
  Peytel from the guillotine.</p>

  <p>Louis-Philippe returned the letter to Gavarni by a faithful hand and kept
  the secret entrusted to him; he had himself sealed the letter from Peytel and
  written across the envelope: "Faithfully resealed. L. P." He also suspended
  the death sentence on Peytel for a few days, to give Gavarni, it was
  supposed, time to send the poison to the prisoner; why the artist did not do
  this is not clear.</p>

  <p>Peytel was guillotined in the market-place of Bourg without confessing.
  Balzac thought he had been "assassinated."</p>

  <p>None of the romantics showed any pity for the wretched girl slain so
  horribly in such awful circumstances, or for the cheerful, likeable youth
  trudging along with his charge and suddenly blotted out of existence; no, all
  sympathy, all interest, all efforts were concentrated on the gloomy figure of
  Peytel, who by his own confession had murdered Louis Rey and according to the
  evidence murdered also his wife and child. He was a journalist, a poet, dark,
  haughty, sensitive to his "honour," a Manfred, a Childe Harold, the victim of
  "Satanic influences." If he had been tried in Paris he would probably have
  been acquitted, but the jurymen of Bourg were farther removed from the
  influence of the capital than were the jurymen who condemned Emile de la
  Roncière; these provincials had probably not read Byron, Lamartine or George
  Sand; it is known that they considered the black-browed, insolent young
  notary, with his shallow arrogance and harsh features, extremely
  unprepossessing&mdash;and the King shared their opinion that this Parisian
  journalist, so much admired by so many famous men, was a brutal murderer, a
  cunning liar.</p>

  <p>The early years of the reign were disturbed also by the exploits of the
  poet-bandit, Lacenaire, who affected to be a kind of Francois Villon. He
  outstripped his model, however, and began not only robbing as a "gesture"
  against society, but murdering for the sheer excitement of the
  thing&mdash;for the thrill, as we should say.</p>

  <p>This cynic scoundrel and bad versifier became, together with his
  accomplice Avril, one of the heroes of the day, sighed after by the women,
  admired&mdash;even imitated&mdash;by some of the men. He was so very
  fascinating with his sardonic smile, his black locks, his haughty disdain of
  all conventions, his mysterious evil; there was the double
  attraction&mdash;evil and despair. Yet he was, the reporters declared,
  mean-looking, bilious, small.</p>

  <p>The romantics, the <i>jeune France</i> of the first quarter of the
  nineteenth century, were born either under the experimental stages of the
  French Revolution or during the first Empire; sons and daughters of men and
  women who had experienced or witnessed anarchy and the extremes of violence,
  passionate heroism, lofty idealism and bestial excesses, the intense
  excitement following unheard-of military glory and success, these romantics
  invented for themselves all the heady emotional experience that their parents
  had undergone at first hand.</p>

  <p>Classicism, the craze of the last generation, was swept aside, declared
  dull, stupid, <i>bourgeois</i> (most scathing of insults), and the romantics,
  inspired by Horace Walpole, Charles Maturin, Mrs. Radcliffe, Sir Walter
  Scott, William Beckford, Hoffmann, and their own writers, Gautier, Hugo, De
  Vigny, became frantically <i>gothique</i> or "<i>moyen âge</i>." By these
  vague terms the romantics, whose ignorance of history was deplorable, meant
  any period from that of the Merovingian Kings to that of Francois I. They
  were <i>dépaysés</i> in their own country and century, and used every means
  to endeavour to live spiritually and emotionally in these past centuries that
  were, they falsely believed, full of what they termed "romance." There was
  also "a nostalgia of Asia Minor," for the East of the Crusades, for the Spain
  of chivalry, for China, Persia, India&mdash;anywhere, as long as the lotus
  bloomed and the breezes blew soft.</p>

  <p>The romantic ideal was a lazy life, full of costly luxuries, deliciously
  agitated by love affairs, voluptuously refined, relieved by the violent drama
  of evil, jealousy, quarrels, death, murder, suicide, adorned with poetry,
  music and all that was soothing to the senses, and quite untouched by sordid
  (practical) cares and considerations. The romantics regarded with bitter
  contempt touched with fury the ordinary people, the great majority of their
  countrymen and countrywomen who were managing the France in which they had
  leisure to play their antics.</p>

  <p>Romanticism penetrated deeply into the life of the people; not only was it
  found in the capital among the intellectuals, the poets, painters, novelists,
  journalists and architects, it infected even the ranks of Philistia. The King
  restored (and nearly ruined) some of the royal <i>châteaux</i>; the royal
  burial place, Saint-Denis, wrecked by the revolutionaries, was reconstructed
  by His Majesty at a vast cost and with the lamentable result that the Gothic
  abbey looked like a railway station. The nobility restored their
  country-seats in <i>style gothique</i> and furnished them in the same manner.
  It was the hey-day of the antique dealer; medieval furniture and bric-a-brac
  were sold (and made) in huge quantities; it was with an antique pistol that
  Peytel&mdash;a noted collector&mdash;shot his wife, and with another of these
  ancient weapons that the duc de Praslin beat out the brains of his duchess in
  the last year of the reign of Louis-Philippe. At the time of the murder the
  duc was spending large sums on rebuilding his magnificent <i>château</i> of
  Choiseul-Praslin in the pure Gothic style.</p>

  <p>The middle classes did what they could by putting <i>tourelles</i> and
  ogive windows, castellated roof lines and a thousand other absurdities on or
  into their modest country houses. The provinces copied Paris; every city had
  its group of romantics, its secret society, its clubs founded on something
  desperate, dark and evil, like Medmenham and the Hellfire Clubs.</p>

  <p>There were "cigarette" and "cigar" clubs (oddly enough, smoking was
  considered romantic), there were other clubs, the Black Pin, the Eagles of
  Napoleon, for example, that existed to subvert society, connected with the
  <i>illuminati</i>, the Rosicrucians and Freemasonry; these clubs, eccentric
  fag-ends of the revolutionary societies, gave the police a great deal of
  trouble. One of them, "The Bared Arms," was mentioned in the La Roncière
  case, and another was supposed to be behind the mysterious murder of the Duc
  de Berri, heir to the throne, on the steps of the Opera House.</p>

  <p>A great feature of these clubs was the periodic orgies; an example of
  these collective debaucheries&mdash;something very difficult to do
  well&mdash;is given in Balzac's <i>Peau de chagrin</i>.</p>

  <p>The music of Liszt and Chopin inflamed the romantics; in <i>Les
  Préludes</i> Liszt translates Lamartine into music and gives us the
  quintessence of romanticism; Berlioz added his erotic genius to the ferment
  and in several pieces, notably <i>Les Francs Juges</i>, gave a furious
  romantic's impression of the fascination, the gloom, the wizardry, the masked
  terrors of the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>The male costumes of <i>jeune France</i> were copied as near as possible
  from those seen on the boards during a representation of a Victor Hugo drama.
  Discarding the austere clothes of the Republicans and the fantastic uniforms
  of the Empire, the romantics tried to dress like the Frankish Kings, like the
  courtiers of the Valois, like pages of the Renaissance. It was said that the
  <i>boulevards</i> looked like a flower garden owing to the coloured felt hats
  of the gallants; these were slouched at all angles&mdash;<i>à la Vandyck, à
  la Velasquez, à la Rubens</i>&mdash;and surmounted long, flowing locks,
  fierce moustachios, and, often, as much beard as could be produced. The
  clothes were of fine cloth, silk, velvet, satin, and in brilliant
  colours&mdash;sky-blue and apple-green were favourite hues. There were less
  cheerful ones&mdash;grey, "the colour of ruins," "the colour of despair,"
  "the colour of a thunderstorm." Cloaks were extremely fashionable and no
  romantic showed a scrap of linen; it was essential that the "<i>frac</i>"
  should be turned back with huge <i>revers</i>, showing a puffed-up waistcoat
  and a black cravat wound up to the ears; this cravat had to be black&mdash;a
  black "of shadows," "of hell," of "eternal damnation." The waistcoat was very
  important; Gautier set the fashion of red for this garment, but young men sat
  up half the night discussing what shade of red they should wear&mdash;"flame
  of Hell," gooseberry, pomegranate, cherry, purple, ox-blood, fires of
  love?</p>

  <p>To wear this trying toilet with success one had to be tall, slender,
  elegant, white-faced, hollow-eyed, with black hair and brows. When a royal
  Prince, the duc de Nemours, fell a victim to the craze and grew his hair and
  beard long, he was regarded as a failure because he was so "disgustingly
  blond." No, one must look like Satan, like Manfred, like a damned soul, while
  the least touch of plumpness, especially about the waist-line, made the whole
  thing ridiculous.</p>

  <p>In order to conform in some degree with the usual mode of their day, the
  romantics wore trousers, tight and gaily-coloured, and sometimes top-hats.
  Some of them dressed in complete black with cropped hair and side-whiskers;
  these usually wore corsets to give sharpness to the sombre silhouette. Every
  kind of braid, fur, tassels, <i>galon, soutaches</i>, feather and jewel was
  worn by these young men&mdash;anything to be different from the Philistine,
  the <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>

  <p>Petrus Borel, the painter, wore pantaloons coloured <i>vert d'eau</i> and
  gloves coloured <i>sang royaliste</i>&mdash;"the entire history of France
  paraded the streets." Some wore their hair parted in the centre and hanging
  straight down like a portrait by Giotto, others had their locks tossed back
  "in wild and savage beauty"&mdash;anything as long as one was
  "flamboyant."</p>

  <p>"We should have liked," wrote Gautier, "to have negro timbalists to
  precede us in the streets, a hundred clarions to follow us."</p>

  <p>These young men had their own language; they wrote to one another in old
  French, they called one another Loys, Jehan, Don Antonio, Karl, Antonio, they
  referred to one another's complexions as "<i>plus basané que les Maures
  d'Afrique</i>," to one another's beards as "<i>fauve et rutilante</i>." Those
  who had money aimed at having a "castle" with pages, musicians, champing
  steeds, ghosts and skeletons; those who had no money wrote about these
  things.</p>

  <p>Costume balls were the rage; the archives of Paris were ransacked (and
  much damaged) by enthusiasts looking for ideas for <i>gothique</i> costumes;
  one romantic, trying to waltz in plate armour, fell down in a fit. Alexandre
  Dumas wore real "museum pieces" looted during the revolution of
  1830&mdash;"<i>une palingénésie habillée des archives nationales</i>." Names
  that seemed prosaic or <i>bourgeois</i> were changed into romantic forms.
  Théophile Dondey becomes Philottée O'Neddy&mdash;Auguste Maquet <i>Augustus
  MacKeat</i>&mdash;Elie Garimon <i>Elias Ongimar</i>&mdash;one must find a
  baroque pseudonym, one must "<i>gothiciser</i>."</p>

  <p>The only words of praise to be obtained from a romantic were <i>"c'est
  gothique," "c'est gothique flamboyant," "c'est cathédrale," "c'est
  satanique," "c'est asphyxiant."</i></p><br>

  <p class="verse">Ressembler à Manfred! Oh la joie enivrante!<br>
  Avoir la bouche amère et le front soucieux,<br>
  Ignorer à jamais l'espérance riante,<br>
  Et se sentir maudit! Et blasphémer les cieux!</p><br>

  <p>The women were shut out of many of these romantic pleasures but were none
  the less avid of them; while the men had their clubs, their orgies, their
  papers, journals and promenades, the women sat at home with their albums and
  pianofortes and scribbled and sketched and tinkled and languished. Clothes
  were the great solace. The women, like the men, turned their backs on
  classicism and tried to dress like Valois Princesses or Queens of Spain; huge
  <i>gigot</i> sleeves were worn, jewels on the forehead, veils, scarves,
  bracelets, belts fashioned like Gothic castles, gates and windows. A modish
  girl tried to get a "book of hours" and a <i>prie-Dieu</i>, and, if possible,
  a secret love intrigue&mdash;a note dropped by a dark-eyed stranger into her
  hand while the <i>duenna</i> (governess) was not looking, a lute struck
  beneath her window, a roll of verse cast into her carriage, a single flower
  offered in silence as she hurried to mass&mdash;and she was happy.</p>

  <p>The wealthy have the fancy-dress balls; what joy to be Marie de Bourgogne,
  Isabeau de Bavière, Marguerite de Valois, Agnès Sorel&mdash;but above all,
  what joy to be Mary, Queen of Scots! This heroine is the female ideal; the
  lofty, captive, wronged Queen, so refined, so sad, with a secret passion
  disturbing her tender heart&mdash;above all, so persecuted, so
  unhappy&mdash;with a dozen cavaliers ready to risk their lives for her
  rescue.</p>

  <p>The female romantics also dream of the <i>château</i>, the
  castle&mdash;oh, to be a <i>châtelaine!</i> To sit on a terrace and dream of
  a knight returning from the East! To move through Gothic galleries in
  brocades and silks, with a lute, a prayer-book, a love-sick page! To muse
  over the orange groves of Smyrna, over the courts of the Valois, over jousts
  where, crowned with roses, one gives the prize to the victor&mdash;anything
  to escape from the deadly tedium of reality and the commonplace!</p>

  <p>The children were dressed as pages with feathered caps and velvet jackets;
  the pianofortes on which their mothers and sisters played the melodies of
  Chopin and Liszt had fronts shaped like the windows of a Gothic cathedral;
  many a gloomy old country-house where the women of the eighteenth century had
  groaned in boredom was discovered to be "delicious," "ravishing," if it had
  but <i>tourelles</i>, hooded chimney-pieces or any such fashionable
  anachronisms; any discomfort was enjoyed as long as one obtained the
  atmosphere of that vague dreamland, <i>le moyen age</i>.</p>

  <p>Into a society thus prepared to receive them with enthusiasm came the
  powerful allies of romanticism&mdash;George Sand and the Valse.</p>

  <p>When Amantine Aurore, Baronne Dudevant, ran away from a dull husband and
  tiresome children to live in Paris With a young student, when this
  emancipated lady began to paint, to write novels, to acquire fame and famous
  lovers, to wear male attire, to earn large sums of money, to become the idol
  of the intellectual world of Paris, a shudder of mingled horror and delight
  ran through French womanhood. The elderly, the orthodox, the happily situated
  woman regarded with alarm and horror this adulterous wife, this shameless
  wanton with her cigars and trousers, her skill with sword and pistol, but the
  large majority of the young, the lonely, the dissatisfied, the frustrated
  women admired Madame Dudevant either openly or secretly, and many imitated
  her as far as they dared.</p>

  <p>Another aspect of womanhood became blended with the meek, languishing
  <i>châtelaine</i>, the <i>lionne</i>, dashing, bold, passionate, able to
  manage an Arabian charger, to handle a sword, to pick and choose her lovers
  regardless of conventions or the laws.</p>

  <p>The Byronic scoundrel, the brigand, the pirate, the murderer, the
  "Satanic" villain had long been popular among the male romantics; now the
  women, hitherto held back by fear, lack of a leader and tradition, hastened
  to indulge in moral anarchy, though with some timidity.</p>

  <p>Madame Dudevant, writing under a male name, George Sand, packed the whole
  philosophy of her generation into the glittering, seductive and sensual
  romances that rapidly found their way into every boudoir, every kitchen,
  every schoolroom in the land. George Sand had great talents, an enticing
  style, a strong gift of narrative, a vivid manner of presenting her theories
  that was acceptable alike to the ignorant and to the fastidious. Her novels
  could act like an enchantment on Jenny at the wash-tub and the young
  <i>duchesse</i> in her pseudo-Gothic apartments, on the lazy, stupid
  schoolgirl and on the refined, intelligent woman of middle age. Under the
  guise of the most voluptuous colours, the most exciting situations, George
  Sand preached woman's right to love; carrying much farther the doctrines of
  her master, J.-J. Rousseau, and embellishing these with her own gifts and
  colouring them with her own temperament, George Sand taught that there was no
  such thing as illicit love&mdash;a <i>sincere</i> passion was above all laws
  and justified itself; this sincere love might be renewed many times without
  blame, it brought with it purity, redemption from sin, and had a high
  spiritual value; it justified adultery, suicide, any contravention of the
  law&mdash;it was the only thing that made life worth while.</p>

  <p>Marriage was ridiculous, dull, degrading, a man-made institution, little
  better than slavery; only in complete sex freedom did a woman find dignity,
  happiness, repose. This theory, eagerly accepted by other writers (perhaps
  simultaneously thought of by them), culminated in the apotheosis of the
  courtesan who regained her virginity by the purifying fires of a pure
  love&mdash;<i>Marion de l'Orme, Angelo</i> and <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>
  served to make this point of view popular. The influence of George Sand made
  a heroine of the unfaithful wife, the harlot, the <i>déclassés</i> woman, the
  rebel, deceived a hundred times, still seeking for the true love that should
  not only restore her chastity but set her on the side of the angels.</p>

  <p>Mary Magdalene was the patron saint of the romantics&mdash;the saying
  "because she has loved much" was taken to mean that the penitent beauty won
  merit by experimenting frequently in physical love. With rare devices of
  literary talent these theories, combined with a general lawlessness, and
  insistence on the general aspect of love and what the orthodox considered
  blasphemy, were expounded in <i>Indiana, Valentine, Léone Léoni', Jacques,
  Simon Mauprat, La Dernière, Aldini, Les Mâitre, Mosaïstes, Pauline, Un Hiver
  à Majorque, Lucrezia Floriani</i> and <i>La Comtesse de Rudolstadt.</i></p>

  <p>Other romances spread the same philosophy with fierce, but no more
  impressive fervour; Eugène Sue, Frédéric Soulié, with their hideous pictures
  of the most degraded people, the most repellent vices, Balzac and Hugo with
  their exaltation of the immoral woman, De Vigny, De Musset with their
  enervating and luxurious themes of misunderstood love and genius, and
  humanity's right to commit suicide, all of them with their common conception
  of "wickedness" as grand, splendid, intellectual, goodness as pale, mean,
  <i>bourgeois</i>, with their elevation of emotion over reason, their
  discovery of heroism in unrestrained passion, and their preoccupation with
  sex, sadism and hedonism, set the fashion of thought and conduct for at least
  the younger generation and permeated the whole of society with the taint of
  blood and patchouli, the reek of the slaughter-house or the thieves' kitchen
  and the sickly odours of the courtesan's boudoir.</p>

  <p>God was used by these writers, but only as a stage effect; dumb and blind,
  the Deity sat apart like a sphinx in a desert, but when dramatic ends were
  served he might be either evoked or defied or prayed to by one of the frantic
  company of <i>jeune France</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lélia</i> was the handbook of the female romantics; few could resist
  the intoxicating pages in which the luscious sentences of George Sand
  depicted a world without restraints, without laws, in which a refined
  sensuality, an erotic sensibility was lightly cloaked by pretences of
  intellectualism and philosophy.</p>

  <p>This novel and its fellows&mdash;all the output of the
  romantics&mdash;were loose, contradictory and incoherent in their basic
  ideas, which were, as far as they could be co-ordinated, entirely unworkable,
  false and confused.</p>

  <p>In the masterpieces of Stendhal (Henri Beyle), <i>Le Rouge et Le Noir</i>
  (note the careless cynicism of the title), <i>La Chartreuse de Parme</i> and
  <i>L'Amour</i>, there is a complete reversal of all moral values. Julien
  forces himself to seduce Madame de Renal, it is his <i>duty</i>; Angélique is
  indignant that Fabian should be in peril for killing a man (an actor), his
  inferior in birth.</p>

  <p>A miasma of the most refined and fastidious evil hangs over all these
  books; it is a decadence of the heart and the mind not only of morals and
  manners that Stendhal paints; it is worse than vice, it is virtue and heroism
  upside down.</p>

  <p>"What is evil?" ask the romantics contemptuously. "Good and evil alike
  come from God."</p>

  <p>Numbers of the inferior authors copied these fashionable writers, every
  newspaper had its <i>feuilleton</i>; novels were brought out in cheap weekly
  parts, were sold at low prices, crowded the shelves of the circulating
  libraries&mdash;romances, verses, memoirs were everywhere; the conductors of
  the new omnibuses read them as their heavy vehicles trundled over the cobbles
  of Paris, the errand boys were absorbed in "the blood and mud" of Eugène
  Sue's <i>Mystères de Paris</i>, the elegant lady in her <i>briska</i> or
  brougham had her copy of <i>Lélia</i> or <i>Léone Léoni</i> in her muff. We
  have seen how Marie de Morell obtained these novels, innocent from a convent
  school as she was, and how Peytel, the friend of Balzac, in irons in the
  condemned cell, scribbled in the style of Eugène Sue or Victor Hugo.</p>

  <p>To this moral <i>bouleversement</i> was added the delicious excitement of
  the valse; in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation, Johann Strauss the
  elder gave seventy-eight concerts in London, and his melodious dance tunes
  were soon the rage of Paris; this sensuous music, this whirling measure with
  men and women clasped in one another's arms while they kept time to a
  pleasing rhythm, suited the romantics&mdash;it took a high place in that
  world where the Gothic castle, the Court of Francois, <i>le roi
  chevalier</i>, the slums of Paris, the criminal's cell, the harlot's garret
  and the boudoir of the <i>châtelaine</i> jostled the verses of Byron and
  Lamartine, the novels of Schiller and George Sand in the phantasmagoria of a
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>The theatre showed the romantic point of view in the most alluring
  colours; the austere and noble characters of Racine and Corneille were cast
  aside, the witty, elegant comedies of Molière were ignored, people and scenes
  never before considered worthy of the dignity of drama were displayed in the
  Parisian playhouses amid a fervour of enthusiasm; plays showing a state of
  moral anarchy were nightly applauded by crowded audiences.</p>

  <p>The dramas exalted "the grandeur of evil," "the sublimity of passion,"
  ("With me," declared one villain-hero, "you are sublime&mdash;with an
  ordinary <i>bourgeois</i> you would be nothing but an honest woman.")
  Scoundrels were made fascinating&mdash;"bronzes cast by Satan." Every
  conceivable vice or wrong-doing was romanticised; every criminal had
  something great about him, nothing was despised save the law-abiding, the
  well-behaved, the <i>bourgeois</i>. The rebels against society were shown as
  noble and attractive compared to the dull hypocrites who formed this society;
  the mother, the matron, the married woman, the tradesman, the whole fabric of
  law and order were nightly held up to derision on the boards of the Parisian
  theatre, while the Parisians applauded the triumph of the <i>femme
  déclassée</i>, the criminal and the brigand.</p>

  <p>Marion de l'Orme cries:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Mon Didier! Près de toi, rien de moi nest resté<br>
  Et ton amour m'a fait une virginité!"</p>

  <p class="first">And every woman in the theatre applauded, sighed, and envied
  such a voluptuous return to a long lost chastity&mdash;who would not, under
  such conditions, have a succession of lovers?</p>

  <p>The theatres that catered for the audiences who could not pay quite so
  much for their seats provided plays that dealt with the darker side of
  romanticism, the Gothic romance of ghosts and terror combined with the lurid
  horrors made popular by Soulié and Sue.</p>

  <p>Plays in which every extravagance and every abomination were displayed had
  a <i>succès</i> fou in these cheaper theatres&mdash;<i>La Nonne Sanglante, Le
  Chiffonnier de Paris, Les Nuits de la Seine, Dix ans de la vie d'une femme,
  La Tour de Nesle</i> were some of the best known of these melodramas. So,
  while the mistress was listening to the ravings of <i>Antony</i> or
  <i>Angelo</i> acclaiming the genius of evil, the maid was agape before "the
  bleeding nun," "the rag-picker of Paris," or some scene of sordid crime set
  in Newgate or a morgue.</p>

  <p>When they compared their entertainments over the morning's toilet, they
  would both devour the last instalment of <i>Le Juif errant</i> or some such
  <i>feuilleton</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Chatterton</i> of Alfred de Vigny was held responsible for the
  annual rise in suicides, nearly doubled between 1830 and 1840, and many
  young, ardent, gifted souls certainly destroyed themselves because the
  romantics taught that the ability to commit suicide was the great distinction
  between man and beast, and because they thought that this self-destruction
  was a fine gesture of contempt towards a dull <i>bourgeois</i> world.</p>

  <p>Such victims of romanticism were usually male; the women clung more
  tenaciously to life; they were not less corrupted.</p>

  <p>George Sand received packets of letters from despairing husbands and
  fathers who accused her of ruining their homes. Contented wives and mothers
  dipped into the pages of <i>Lélia</i> or some of its successors and
  straightway found their husbands plain and coarse, their children tedious,
  their lives paltry; finding reality intolerable, these women tried to create
  in their actions and surroundings the atmosphere of the enchanting fictions
  that had turned their heads.</p>

  <p>The unmarried women of the upper classes were in a better position to
  indulge romanticism. Idle, luxurious, often talented and well-trained in
  "accomplishments," often charming and pretty, they were able to produce a
  certain illusion of romance; it was easy for them to assume a melancholy air,
  to play valses, to sing verses, to recite poetry, to attend balls and
  theatres in "fancy" costume or in white muslin with flowers in their tresses,
  to exchange romantic confidences with a female friend&mdash;above all, it was
  easy to read, read, read, and to write, write, write letters, verses,
  <i>essais</i>, songs, <i>pensées, réflexions</i>. Carefully they cultivated
  <i>l'air romantique</i>, the pale face, the black hair and eyes (if
  possible), the enigmatic, brooding manner, the graceful languor, the
  half-suppressed passion, the nostalgia for the past, for the East, the scorn
  for their own times and for everything practical.</p>

  <p>To obtain the sylph-like figure made "the rage" by Madame Taglioni, these
  ladies starved and forced themselves into iron corsets; food was despised,
  the romantic played with an egg, with a salad, with a little fruit, she drank
  quantities of China tea, of soda water, and ate <i>mufflings</i> (muffins);
  if the result was a face blanched with anaemia or shadowed with the pains of
  indigestion, so much the better. Some girls drank vinegar and sucked lead
  pencils to give themselves a pallid complexion; it was considered
  "interesting" to have consumption of the lungs, to die young. In a <i>habit
  amazone</i>, with her hair flying and a whip in her gauntleted hand, the
  romantic would gallop solitary through the <i>Bois</i>, but never quite
  beyond the range of admiring glances of spectators.</p>

  <p>These women indulged in musings over death as well as passion; not only
  was their air melancholy, dark, not only did they put bistre round their eyes
  and belladonna into their eyes to obtain this "beyond-the-tomb" fixity of
  gaze, but they adorned their <i>salons</i> with pictures of vampires,
  witches, Sabbaths, phantoms, skeletons and flights of bats, favoured white
  gowns with black roses, boughs of cypress instead of fans, and named their
  drawing-rooms <i>salle de la mélancolie</i> or "The Spectre's
  Antechamber."</p>

  <p>It is not to be supposed that in the country of Voltaire, Molière and
  Rabelais the romantics went unnoticed by the satirists; a whole literature, a
  series of albums, of drawings were devoted to this subject; some of the
  leading romantics themselves almost satirised the movement, but this was too
  powerful even for sarcasm or ridicule to check&mdash;it went its headlong
  course until <i>Madame Bovary</i> did for romanticism what Don Quixote did
  for chivalry.</p>

  <p>Gustave Flaubert did not kill romanticism; what is implied in this term is
  common to human nature in all ages and countries, but he put it out of
  fashion for a time at least, and by coldly dissecting the romantic woman put
  femininity out of love with this particular role&mdash;though constantly
  recurring specimens of the romantic woman prove that the type is
  immortal.</p>

  <p>Never before was it encouraged and exalted as in the period that we are
  considering; this enthusiasm for feminine romanticism Was owing partly to
  ignorance of much that is now common knowledge. The phenomena of hysteria,
  magnetism, mesmerism, trance, ecstasy were imperfectly understood; the
  science of psychology was in its infancy; women who then could pass for
  <i>femmes fatales</i> or "eternal enigmas" would now be docketed as mental
  cases. Least of all was pathological lying or the creation of a fantasy-life
  by a person dissatisfied with reality credited, or even considered
  seriously&mdash;as we have seen in the Marie de Morell case. Some few doctors
  understood at least something of this large subject, but they were not
  listened to and often dared not say what they thought. Yet it was to this
  dangerous state of "make-believe" that many romantic women were reduced.</p>

  <p>From reading novelettes to writing novelettes, and then to living
  novelettes, the steps were easy. The romantic deliberately created out of
  herself a character that approached that of her favourite heroine, and
  sometimes, like Frankenstein, found that she had created a monster who ran
  away, not into realms of fantasy, but into the sordid tragedies of
  everyday.</p>

  <p>The great difficulty that faced the romantics&mdash;it was greater in the
  case of the ladies&mdash;was this inevitable conflict with reality. After
  all, pretend as one would, one was living in the nineteenth century and not
  in the Middle Ages, in France, not in fairyland. George Sand was one in a
  million; where was the average woman, even if well-born, well-to-do, young
  and pleasing, to find the means of leading the free life of Madame Dudevant
  that was the result of great gifts, a powerful character, a capacity for
  earning money?</p>

  <p>All very well to dream of freedom in love, of a hundred errors effaced by
  the one pure passion, but even the errors had to have a partner and where
  were the men coming from? These Satanic heroes, passionate, refined and
  sardonic, or deliciously damned and cursed, were rare; when they did appear
  they usually lacked money; often they lacked the means to support even a
  castle in Spain. And a Frenchwoman, however romantic, had strong inherited
  ideas of security, comfort, the <i>convenable</i>; she did not want a
  starving poet though he might look like Byron, or a grocer's assistant though
  he might resemble Satan. The family tradition was still powerful&mdash;papa
  and mamma had to be considered; she was dependent on them for everything; her
  relations guarded her <i>dot</i> carefully, it was to be parted with only to
  a man of good position and prospects&mdash;such a one was, too often, not a
  romantic, or, if he were infected with the fashionable <i>malaise</i>, did
  not look in the least like a George Sand hero or the portraits of Alfred de
  Musset.</p>

  <p>Even in the wildest throes of romanticism most of the women retained some
  glimmerings of the national shrewdness and common sense and tried to make the
  most of both worlds. The usual expedient was to marry the "best" <i>parti</i>
  procurable, and afterwards to indulge oneself as far as possible in romantic
  caprices&mdash;these, if circumstances were favourable, might include a
  lover; but as a rule the romantic was careful not to outrage too violently
  that dull society which she despised but which she also feared and which
  accorded her&mdash;as long as she behaved herself&mdash;security, comfort,
  and often luxury.</p>

  <p>Many women achieved this double life with the ease of natural duplicity
  and that elegant feminine dexterity for which hypocrisy is too coarse a word.
  But some bold, passionate creatures found it extremely difficult to subscribe
  to a social order they loathed; few, however, had the courage to cast aside
  all restraints and to follow the example of George Sand. Despite romanticism
  the feminine code was extremely strict and the well-brought-up young woman
  hesitated a long time before she took the step that would cut her off from
  the help and protection of her family, the countenance of her class and all
  the advantages to be gained from a pose of respectability in a world that was
  still, on the whole, respectable&mdash;at least in appearance.</p>

  <p>Marriage, for instance, might be odious, degrading, but for the ordinary
  woman what was the alternative? Spinsterhood (one was <i>vieille fille</i> at
  twenty-five years of age), boredom&mdash;a life barren of dignity, importance
  and excitement. Save for the very few, a "career" was not to be thought of;
  the market for feminine talents and activities was extremely small; a lady
  had no training for anything but a post as governess; the arts were out of
  the question unless one was very gifted; actresses were not recruited from
  the ranks of gentlewomen; nor was it easy to become a famous courtesan; lack
  of gifts, opportunities and courage prevented most well-born women from
  taking up this career that was so seductively romantic. But how to set about
  being a Marion de l'Orme or a Ninon de Lenclos?</p>

  <p>Driven back to the conventions the young romantic sullenly acquiesced in
  her destiny and tried to do the best with the material at her
  command&mdash;her dreams, her books, her scribblings, her albums, her chance
  secret opportunities for adventure, for rebellion, for realisation of her own
  potentialities.</p>

  <p>Thrown thus on herself, infected with the moral anarchy of the endless
  romances she read, the sensitive, imaginative young woman began to invent the
  exciting life she was denied, to lie, to combine real details with an
  intricate pattern of falsehood, to intrigue to gain her ends; she became
  skilful in provoking the passions of those about her, in creating
  "sensations," in making mischief, in assuming poses, even often an adept in
  the most subtle duplicity and that subtle combination of truth and falsehood
  more dangerous than lies.</p>

  <p>The amount of pain, distress, trouble and confusion, even of wrong and
  suffering, caused by this type of romantic liar was often vast and
  far-reaching in its effects; not even the shrewdest, best-trained legal
  brains of the day could cope with the fearful complications created by the
  perverse egotism of the hysteric female desperately anxious to be the centre
  of some powerful drama.</p>

  <p>A mysterious murder took place at the dawn of the romantic movement that
  illustrates the terrible power of this type of hysterical woman to confuse
  justice and to inflame the public imagination to fury. The murdered body of a
  M. Fualdès, a middle-aged magistrate of the town of Rodez, was found in the
  river that flows through his native town. The police decided that the crime
  had been committed in the hovel of a certain couple named Bancal who lived in
  one of the worst quarters of the town and were of the most degraded
  description; perpetrated by this couple and a wretch named Collard who lived
  with them at the instigation of two well-known citizens related to the
  murdered man&mdash;Joseph Jousion and Bernard-Charles Bastide-Grammont.</p>

  <p>The police theory was that the two principals had hired the others to
  abduct and murder Fualdès and afterwards to carry his body through the town
  and cast it into the river. The motive could not be clearly guessed
  at&mdash;Bastide-Grammont owed Fualdès money, and Fualdès had been carrying a
  large sum on the night of his murder; there were also suspicions of political
  motives, private vendettas and the vengeance of one of the secret societies
  with which France was then riddled. Fualdès had been one of the jurymen who
  tried Charlotte de Corday, and even this was brought up as a possible
  explanation of the murder.</p>

  <p>The accused had, on their side, good alibis and a reasonable defence, lack
  of motives, previous good characters, the unlikelihood that men of education
  and position would commit such a crude, barbarous and stupid crime, and so
  on.</p>

  <p>The affair was then, and has since remained, a mystery, one of the most
  exasperating of <i>causes célèbres</i>; the interest of it, for a student of
  romanticism, lies in the intervention in the case of Clarisse Manson.</p>

  <p>This lady, <i>née</i> Enjalran, was the daughter of a magistrate of Rodez,
  neither pretty nor graceful, but pleasing and vivacious; she had been born
  and bred in the country and was in everything a little provincial; she found
  the provinces, however, intolerably dull, was an insatiable novel-reader and
  early stated her creed&mdash;"I am a romantic." She revolted against the idea
  of an ordinary marriage with an ordinary man, but was induced to give her
  hand to M. Antoine Manson, whom she found, however, extremely
  commonplace.</p>

  <p>To liven up the marriage she indulged in make-believe; the husband was
  forbidden the house and forced to woo her as if he were a secret lover. He
  sang Spanish songs under her balcony, sent her pearl-grey doves with notes
  under their wings, baskets of fruit with cashmere shawls, <i>voiles
  d'Angleterre</i> and verses, and kept <i>rendez-vous</i> in a pavilion in the
  garden that Clarisse pretended to think was extremely dangerous. She wrote
  the whole story in a series of egotistical, foolish letters to a schoolgirl
  friend at Rodez; those epistles were composed in the high-flown language of
  the persistent fiction-reader who had no experience of life.</p>

  <p>Clarisse soon wearied of her romantic pretences&mdash;do what she would,
  Antoine Manson was <i>bourgeois</i>, she could not turn him into a Byron, a
  Schiller, a troubadour or even a Spanish cavalier. M. Manson also tired of
  being kept out of his own house, entering his wife's room by the window,
  sending her verses and presents, every day getting up with the dawn to sing
  <i>aubades</i> beneath her balcony, and of listening to silly chatter about
  Aleppo and <i>Corinne</i>.</p>

  <p>The couple separated; Clarisse kept the only child, a boy of whom she was
  foolishly fond, and returned to the dull house of her dull parents. Idle,
  discontented, consumed with daydreams, always brooding over some novel, and
  imagining herself the heroine, Clarisse Manson wearied of the fetters of a
  tedious existence; she was a nonentity with neither beauty nor gifts, in a
  small provincial town (Rodez is near Toulouse and the Spanish frontier, a
  long way from Paris), a woman whom no one noticed, into whose dreary life
  came neither drama nor romance nor excitement of any kind.</p>

  <p>With the Fualdès affair came Clarisse's great chance, and she took it;
  shortly after the arrest of the accused man she went to the prefecture and
  signed a deposition to the effect that she had been in the Bancal hovel
  during the murder and that she could identify Bastide-Grammont and Jousion as
  the murderers. She had been wandering down this slum of an ugly reputation in
  the dark of a March evening when she heard a noise that frightened her and
  she fled into a doorway; a hag pulled her in and thrust her into a cupboard,
  telling her to be silent; when she was let out she saw both Bastide-Grammont
  and Jousion; the former had wished to kill her, the latter had saved her life
  but had forced her to swear secrecy; half-dead with terror she was led
  through the room where the corpse of Fualdès was extended on the table, taken
  to a distant part of the town and left; she had been wearing a dark dress and
  veil.</p>

  <p>The prosecution declared that Clarisse Manson "was an angel sent by God to
  bring hideous criminals to justice," and Clarisse was one of the first
  witnesses to be called. With her opening words, however, she took her story
  back&mdash;she had never been in the Bancals' hut; after making this
  declaration she fainted.</p>

  <p>Upon recovery she showed great terror at the sight of the prisoners in the
  dock, made some incoherent statements about "knives, blood" and so on, and
  fell into convulsions. The impression she made was that she was terrified of
  the vengeance of the prisoners if they were acquitted, or of that of
  relatives if they were condemned&mdash;and that she was afraid to speak.</p>

  <p>She was promised legal protection; a file of soldiers was placed between
  her and the prisoners, and she was entreated, even by the advocate for the
  defence, to speak the truth. Having thus attracted a lively attention,
  Clarisse Manson proceeded to disturb and confuse, not only Rodez but the
  whole of France, with what can only be described as a novelette in the form
  of a jig-saw puzzle.</p>

  <p>Her evidence, spread over weeks, was incoherent, contradictory,
  incredible, baffling to a maddening degree; the interest of the case shifted
  from the men on trial for their lives to Clarisse Manson who, without looks,
  talents or fortune, contrived to occupy a position of dazzling publicity. In
  the course of her evidence, which was always given with much drama and
  emotion and interrupted by fainting fits and convulsions, Clarisse Manson
  swore to the following different stories:</p>

  <p>She had never been to the Bancals' house&mdash;she knew a woman who had
  been, but could not reveal her name.</p>

  <p>She had been to the Bancals' house, she had hidden in a closet, a
  cupboard, under a bed, behind a door; she had heard nothing, she had heard
  Fualdès being killed. She had seen the murderers and recognised them, she had
  seen some men she could not recognise. She had worn a black veil, a dark
  dress; she had been attired as a man. She had the jacket and
  waistcoat&mdash;the pantaloons had been destroyed because they were
  blood-stained; this blood had come from the corpse that she had brushed
  against in leaving the Bancals, it had come from her own nose, which had
  bled, as she had fallen against a shutter.</p>

  <p>To these contradictory statements Clarisse Manson added others to account
  for her being in such an ill-reputed place at such an hour. She was there to
  meet a secret lover, she was there to meet her husband with whom she was on
  the point of being reconciled, she was there to surprise her husband with the
  charming Rose Perrin, with whom he had, she suspected, an intrigue, she was
  there because she had seen someone she knew in the street and out of
  curiosity had followed him into this ill-famed dwelling&mdash;finally, she
  would veer right round and declare: "I was not there at all, at the foot of
  the scaffold I would maintain that."</p>

  <p>She continually cast looks of indignation at the prisoners and addressed
  them in terms of reproach and horror; she was so much affected by the sight
  of weapons that the officer of <i>gens d'armes</i> standing near her had to
  take off his sword; she declared that she was in great fear of her own life
  and an armed guard accompanied her when she went abroad in Rodez. She
  frequently alluded to "a secret" that no torture should tear from her, and
  often held up the business of the court by long swoons or trances during
  which she muttered incoherencies like a seeress.</p>

  <p>Some of her dramatic exclamations, notably: "All the murderers are not in
  the dock!" spread alarm and confusion, not only throughout Rodez, but
  throughout France.</p>

  <p>All the accused showed great firmness and patience in denying all her
  stories and none of them was trapped by her insinuations into any admission
  of guilt.</p>

  <p>Finally, there being some realists among the magistrates, Clarisse Manson
  was arrested on a charge of perjury and sent to Paris. She then assumed a
  melancholy air of resignation, still talked of her "secret," wept, laughed,
  and began, true to type, to write her memoirs. She was very well treated,
  allowed to have her child, whom she pampered, and to receive visitors; her
  likeness appeared in all the papers and she occupied more of the public
  attention than any question of the moment, however important. By no other
  means than the public utterance of fantastic lies this commonplace woman
  achieved more notoriety than is usually accorded to great heroines or great
  criminals.</p>

  <p>The journalists analysed her character and described her person with the
  greatest care, her "honour" and her "virtue" were discussed as if these vague
  abstractions had great importance. Only a few had the shrewdness to describe
  Madame Manson's appearances in the witness-box as "<i>véritables scènes de
  mélodrame</i>" and to comment "<i>lorsque la passion paraît la justice s'en
  va.</i>" Only a few laughed at her fantastic "<i>romans</i>" of that famous
  and fatal night, among which was one about an Englishwoman, Miss Gipson
  [sic], who, wearing remarkable green plumes, had been secreted in the
  cupboard of the thieves' kitchen that the Bancals owned.</p>

  <p>Five of the prisoners were condemned to death for the murder of M.
  Fualdès; their guilt is still a matter of dispute. Their condemnation was in
  part owing to the intervention of Madame Manson, for, though she was accused
  of perjury, she contrived to create an atmosphere of mystery that was most
  prejudicial to the accused men and woman.</p>

  <p>In a series of letters to the Prefect of Aveyron, written from prison,
  Madame Manson denied absolutely having ever been in the Bancals' hut, giving
  an alibi for the night of the murder. She declared that a certain M.
  Clémendot had seen her at the theatre, tried to force his attention on her,
  and in doing so had roused the anger of her brother. Fearful of a duel
  between the two men and of separation from her child ("<i>mon Edouard, mon
  seul bien</i>"), exhausted by lack of food and sleep, she had made the false
  declaration in a state of mental confusion.</p>

  <p>She soon offered a variation of this tale. M. Clémendot was her lover, he
  had been false to her with Rose Perrin, and it was to surprise the lovers
  that she had gone to the <i>maison Bancal</i>. Her final word, however, was
  that she did not even know where this house was situated.</p>

  <p>How often, when some bright, sensitive creature has destroyed himself, has
  the coroner remarked: "He lived in a world of fantasy." Tragic indeed are
  such cases where the impact of reality is too hard for the dreamer to endure,
  and he ends a life of promise by suicide; but even more tragic are the cases
  where the dweller in realms of fantasy tries to superimpose a romantic
  invention on reality and to live in a self-created world of those imaginings
  that are, when translated into speech and action, plain falsehoods. Better
  for such a one to destroy himself than to involve others in all the terrible
  consequences of an attempt to turn daydreams into actualities and to
  translate into action the eccentric and egotistical fancies that bewilder the
  neurotic, the romantic, the hysterical.</p>

  <p>All the <i>mise en scène</i> of romanticism&mdash;as the early nineteenth
  century understood the word&mdash;seems ridiculous and pitiful. We smile at
  these damned, cursed souls, at these "Satanic" characters, at all the
  melodramatic properties of the romantics, but if we consider the too frequent
  cases, of which Marie de Morell and Clarisse Manson are typical examples,
  where the atmosphere of the novelette is shadowed by prison bars and the
  knife of the guillotine, where the inventions, poses and half-unconscious
  actions of some irresponsible, emotional woman bring misery, disgrace and
  ruin and perhaps death to innocent people, where the lurid incidents of
  melodrama blend with the grimmest realities of life and death, then we may be
  inclined to think that indeed there is something Satanic about romanticism,
  which may be described as the father of all lies.</p>

  <p>Even in the first half of the nineteenth century of France not everyone
  was a romantic; the law existed and so did a large number of people ready to
  enforce the law; petty, sordid passions, cupidity, spite, envy, snobbery
  animated many ordinary folk who were without romanticism. The orthodox, the
  law-abiding were still powerful, especially in the provinces; thousands of
  women read romances and went no farther than sighing over them in secret; the
  true romantic was faced with a world where he could work endless mischief,
  but which sooner or later would defeat him.</p>

  <p>The morbid rebel, the social anarchist, even in this period, came sooner
  or later into conflict with forces that eclipsed or destroyed them; the
  romantic who could not keep his fantasies under control found himself
  confronted with a tragedy in which, too often, others were involved
  disastrously.</p>

  <p>Not so much harm has been done by the realist who, understanding his
  world, and knowing what he wants, has unscrupulously striven for his ends, as
  by the romantic who, inhabitant of a novelette-melodrama-created world, has
  endeavoured to subordinate reality to his own fantasy.</p>

  <p>While Clarisse Manson was distracting France with her lies and postures, a
  little girl was growing up who was to outshine her in her own sphere, and
  who, romantic of the romantics, was to combine in her short career all the
  ingredients of romanticism&mdash;"the secret of the cradle," "the secret of
  the tomb," an entangled intrigue that included a handsome Spaniard, stolen
  diamonds, the honour of a great lady, a frustrated love affair, an unhappy
  marriage, a Gothic castle, swoons, convulsions, a murder, ghosts, a <i>cause
  célèbre</i>, prisons, "the shadow of the scaffold," an abundance of period
  fripperies.</p>

  <p>This little girl was Marie Cappelle, afterwards Madame Lafarge, whose
  slender figure, hair like swathes of crape, huge eyes with bistre shadows,
  hollow cough, all with <i>l'air romantique</i>, half-infernal, half-angelic,
  a whole generation found almost unbearably fascinating.</p>

  <p>Her own character, her circumstances, the period in which she lived
  combined to make this woman symbolic of the whole French romantic movement
  and illustrative of an important facet of human nature.</p>

  <p>Far more gifted, intelligent and remarkable than either Marie de Morell or
  Clarisse Manson, Marie Cappelle's melodrama was more lurid and "sensational"
  than either the affair of the anonymous letters or Mme. Manson's part in the
  Fualdès murder.</p>

  <p>By her friends and partisans (of whom she had a vast number, and who
  comprised some of the finest minds in France) she was termed "<i>l'ange de
  l'arsénic</i>," an unconscious parody of Lamartine's description of Charlotte
  de Corday as "<i>the angel of assassination</i>"&mdash;and she herself
  described the dangerous delights of the George Sand romances as "diamonds in
  a rose."</p>

  <p>This biography has been named <i>The Lady and the Arsenic</i>, because
  each of these two plays an important part in the tale.</p>

  authorities on which this study of a famous romantic has been based.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>O les beaux jours! Comme j'étais
     malheureuse!</i> &mdash;Sophie Arnould.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"BLOW your nose, dear, and stop shuffling your
  feet&mdash;poor Mamma has a terrible headache&mdash;yes, we are stopping
  here, no, I don't know where we are going to have luncheon&mdash;oh, <i>mon
  Dieu</i>, Mamma said, blow your nose, not wipe it on your glove!"</p>

  <p>The family party descended from the carriage, and a fatigued lady with a
  chignon, a mauve-and-white check dress and panniers and bustle of
  prune-coloured taffeta dragged along a tiresome child in a straw hat; the
  father and son in a check <i>pardessus</i> followed. At the entrance gate to
  the monastery were already waiting a young English couple, a solitary
  middle-aged traveller in a plaid cape and three students from Orléans
  University.</p>

  <p>The porter opened the gates and a Carthusian monk waited to conduct the
  tourists round the buildings; the exhausted mother braced herself for an hour
  or so of intolerable tedium&mdash;how unreasonable of Pierre to indulge his
  taste for antiquity at her expense!</p>

  <p>It was bad enough to have to take little Lucille to see her grandmother,
  all those miles of travelling, without having to go over all the curiosities
  on the way.</p>

  <p>Lucille began to whimper; she was hungry and certainly had a cold in the
  head; with a damp cotton glove she rubbed her little red nose.</p>

  <p>The English visitors stood together shyly and pretended not to notice that
  they were among foreigners; the man in the plaid cape consulted a German
  guide-book, the students admired the sumptuous restorations of the ancient
  abbey.</p>

  <p>The monk had his story by heart; as the little party followed him through
  the cloisters he raised his voice and paused now and then to look over his
  shoulder to see if he was understood or not.</p>

  <p><i>"Mesdames et messieurs</i>, a crime was the cause of the foundation of
  the <i>chartreuse</i> of Glandier&mdash;one of the finest buildings that this
  famous order possessed in France&mdash;fourteen establishments..."</p>

  <p>"What does he say, William?" whispered the bride. "That it was a crime to
  build the place?"</p>

  <p>"Hush, dear! Surely not!&mdash;but he talks so rapidly..."</p>

  <p>The Carthusian pitched his tone even higher, sensing more than hearing the
  interruption:</p>

  <p>"In the year of Our Lord 1210, two powerful knights of Tulle
  quarrelled&mdash;Bernard de Ventadour and Galhard de Cardalhac. In spite the
  latter murdered a monk&mdash;or seven as some say&mdash;belonging to a
  monastery under the protection of De Ventadour. In his penitence De Cardalhac
  built this monastery in the middle of a vast forest of oaks&mdash;hence the
  name. An acorn garland was also on the shield of De Ventadour, as you may
  perceive from this sculpture..."</p>

  <p>The monk pointed to a stone shield in one of the spandrels of the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"You see, my love," remarked the Englishman, "'glandiers' means
  'acorns.'"</p>

  <p>"The holy monks," continued the guide, "lived here in the odour of
  sanctity..."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Lucille, don't pull at my skirt&mdash;<i>mon Dieu</i>, I don't
  know what the odour of sanctity smells like!"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle perhaps will never know," remarked the monk sternly, "unless
  she learns a more reverent behaviour..."</p>

  <p>"The little one is suffering!" exclaimed the indignant mother. "See, she
  has <i>la grippe</i>..."</p>

  <p>"Be silent," commanded the agitated father. "And, Lucille, if you are not
  a good little girl I shall make you into a big parcel and send you home."</p>

  <p>"How big, Papa?" snuffled Lucille.</p>

  <p>The guide strode ahead, talking to the students who took no notice of him
  and to the English couple who understood nothing of what he said:</p>

  <p>"In the revolution of 1793 when the monasteries were secularised, Glandier
  was bought by a certain judge of the peace at Vigeois&mdash;one
  Jean-Baptiste-Pouch Lafarge. He pulled down a portion of the old buildings
  and erected a dwelling-house, leaving the rest of the edifice to fall into
  decay..."</p>

  <p>"How disgraceful!" exclaimed one of the students. "It must have been a
  beautiful specimen of early Gothic..."</p>

  <p>"Worse, monsieur, was to follow. It occurred to M. Lafarge <i>fils</i>
  that the charcoal to be obtained from the forest could be made to supply
  factory furnaces, so he began an iron foundry here, cutting down the
  magnificent oaks and building his factory from the materials obtained from
  further demolition of the monastery&mdash;but, <i>mesdames et messieurs</i>,
  the secular owners of consecrated property never flourish for long. M.
  Lafarge <i>fils</i> came to a terrible end..."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the <i>affaire</i> Lafarge!" exclaimed the students one after
  another.</p>

  <p>The English couple caught the name and the lady whispered: "Yes, now he is
  coming to it&mdash;indeed, my love, that is really what I wanted to see here.
  Will you please ask if <i>her</i> house is still standing?"</p>

  <p>"I do not like to&mdash;it would seem frivolous," whispered back the young
  man, whose knowledge of the French language was by no means equal to this
  task.</p>

  <p>The German traveller spoke for the first time, raising spectacled eyes
  from his guide-book:</p>

  <p>"Here it says that the forges went bankrupt after the death of M. Lafarge
  in 1839?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the property was bought at a very cheap rate from the creditors
  by the Baron Léon de Jouvenel, <i>châtelain</i> of Castel Novel," added the
  Carthusian.</p>

  <p>"Who was asked, after the ban on the religious orders had been lifted, to
  sell to the Carthusians, but declined for fear of becoming unpopular with the
  anti-clerical party," put in the German rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," agreed the monk, irritated by the interruptions of the
  foreigner. "But, as you see, we obtained Glandier, nevertheless."</p>

  <p>He strode rapidly ahead, flung open a door, and the party straggled after
  him into a large garth surrounded by handsome buildings that the best
  architects in France had carefully restored on the ruins, neglected for
  seventy years, of the ancient abbey.</p>

  <p>The Englishman remarked on the probable cost of these restorations, the
  Frenchman exclaimed on their magnificence, and the two women asked, one in
  English, one in French:</p>

  <p>"Where is the house of Madame Lafarge?"</p>

  <p>The monk smiled sternly and pointed to a square building with sloping high
  roof in one corner of the garth; it was one-storeyed with five windows above
  the door.</p>

  <p>"That is the house&mdash;much of the secular buildings has been
  demolished. The factory, the gardens and farm sheds have been destroyed, we
  have tried to regain the ancient character of Glandiers as much as
  possible&mdash;we have even replanted the wood of oaks ..."</p>

  <p>"Mamma, can I have another handkerchief, mine is all wet!"</p>

  <p>"Papa will lend you his handkerchief, my darling."</p>

  <p>The stout gentleman with the auburn side-whiskers stooped and wrung
  Lucille's damp nose so vigorously that she began to howl.</p>

  <p>"So badly behaved these foreign children," murmured the Englishwoman. "And
  how oddly dressed!"</p>

  <p>The monk cleared his throat and concluded his story:</p>

  <p>"In 1859 an old notary waited on M. de Jouvenel and offered him in cash
  the price asked for Glandier. It was accepted. The purchaser was a Carthusian
  in disguise. The Order immediately took possession of their rightful
  property, and, as you see, in ten years they have almost completely restored
  it to its original splendour."</p>

  <p>Lucille sat down on the wet gravel, drumming the heels of her
  patent-leather boots and screaming at the top of her voice:</p>

  <p>"Papa hurt me! Naughty papa!"</p>

  <p>The monk strode ahead with the students and the German.</p>

  <p>"Madame Lafarge was also a spoilt child," he said darkly. "Thus it always
  begins..."</p>

  <p>"The case Lafarge," remarked the German, peering into his guide-book. "Ah,
  so that was some years past&mdash;here, yes, it gives the story&mdash;shall I
  read it, no?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," replied the monk hastily, "it is only too well known here in
  the Limousin&mdash;no doubt even these young gentlemen have heard of it."</p>

  <p>The students assented; though they had been children at the time of the
  tragedy, the tale had been retold so often.</p>

  <p>"Besides, we are architects, we came to see the restorations, as our
  professor recommended."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps you will care to enter the <i>maison</i> Lafarge&mdash;from
  the windows is a fine view of the property..."</p>

  <p>They hurried on, hoping to outdistance the others, but the English couple,
  with quick strides, soon overtook them, and Lucille was dragged along between
  her parents, who disputed over her head.</p>

  <p>Through the round door the party entered the house, which had a sad air;
  the ground floor was used as a store-place for gardening implements; the
  entrance passage and staircase were dark.</p>

  <p>The monk led them to the first floor. They entered a bare room in a bad
  state of repair with windows looking on to vegetable gardens, beyond which
  was a river that flowed at the foot of a wood.</p>

  <p>"That is where there used to be flower parterres and the stables," said
  the brother. "We use the ground for a more practical purpose."</p>

  <p>The party divided; a group crowded to each of the windows.</p>

  <p>The prospect that they beheld in the mellow light of the autumn sun was
  beautiful. The narrow river was edged with reeds, flags and bulrushes; on its
  surface floated the flat, yellowing leaves of water-lilies; beyond, full in
  the rich light, on a gentle slope rose the oak woods. Many of the ancient,
  magnificent trees remained, and there were groves of young saplings that the
  Carthusians had planted in place of the superb timber that had been
  sacrificed to the furnaces of the iron-foundry. Above, the deep violet blue
  of the sky was broken by a curdle of thick white clouds.</p>

  <p>"It is a dull place, William, no comforts at all," remarked the English
  lady. Lucille's mamma was of the same opinion:</p>

  <p>"But there is nothing to see. Do, pray, let us get the child back to the
  carriage&mdash;she is quite unmanageable. No, Lucille, you could not play
  marbles here..."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," smiled the German brightly. He thrust his hand into the
  pocket of his ginger-coloured trousers and pulled out a large piece of
  coconut ice. "Here, my little dear, put that in your mouth."</p>

  <p>Lucille snatched the sweetmeat greedily and her parents were profuse in
  their thanks.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they think of that themselves?" queried the Englishwoman.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said her husband, "she has long since devoured their
  supplies."</p>

  <p>The German beamed with pleasure in his success in quieting Lucille, whose
  chin was rapidly becoming moist with pink sugar.</p>

  <p>"My guide-book says that Glandier is haunted," he announced
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"By the spectres of the seven murdered monks without doubt," suggested one
  of the students flippantly.</p>

  <p>The guide, with some reserve, admitted that the monastery was haunted.
  This seemed to be a subject on which he did not care to dwell.</p>

  <p>The two women glanced at each other and wished that they could discuss the
  story of Madame Lafarge, who, for a brief period thirty years before, had
  moved through these rooms, gazed from these windows, been rowed on that
  placid little river and had wandered through the glades of despoiled oaks.
  They felt that there was something in this case that no man could wholly
  understand, but that would be clear to all women without much trouble.</p>

  <p>They went into the next room and stood in the centre of the bare floor;
  the two squares of sunlight on the floor, falling from the plain windows,
  showed the dust on the boards; the remains of a faded green paper were on the
  walls, a cracked black chimney-piece projected above an ugly iron grate and
  bars red with rust.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the room, and the prospect without was peaceful and
  even drowsy in the afternoon sun, but an uncomfortable silence fell on the
  tourists. Lucille's mother did not notice that the child, having used up her
  gloves and her father's handkerchief, was now wiping her nose, mouth and
  chin, sticky from the coconut ice, on the bottom of her white merino frock
  round which were narrow rows of black velvet.</p>

  <p>"The bedchamber of Madame Lafarge," announced the monk gravely.</p>

  <p>The German spoke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have her ghost, also?"</p>

  <p>Then they were silent again, standing in that empty room beyond which was
  the empty landscape.</p>

  <p>"There is another apartment," said the Carthusian.</p>

  <p>They followed him through a door in the right wall into a room similar to
  that which they had left, but smaller and in the other facade of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"There used to be visible from these windows a miserable avenue of poplars
  planted by M. Lafarge <i>aîné</i>. We had them cut down&mdash;you now look
  out on an orchard planted with apple-trees that are beginning to bear
  fruit."</p>

  <p>The monk gazed from the window as he spoke, while the depressed group of
  tourists stood in the centre of the empty room in the melancholy
  sunshine.</p>

  <p>"It is the bedchamber of M. Lafarge," said the Carthusian. "In that corner
  stood the bed on which he died."</p>

  <p>They trooped back to the other room, the women holding up their long,
  flounced dresses out of the dust, Lucille complaining of malaise, the German
  checking everything the monk had said with his guide-book printed in
  Berlin.</p>

  <p>"Here, <i>mesdames et messieurs</i>, is an object of interest." The
  Carthusian pointed to a little brass plate set in the wall beside the cracked
  black marble chimney-piece and the rusty grate. "Here Madame Lafarge kept her
  cabinet of poisons."</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-01"
     id="ch-03-01"></a>1. THE SECRET OF THE CRADLE</h3>

  <p class="first">"BLOW your nose, dear, and stop shuffling your feet! Poor
  Mamma has a terrible headache. Yes, we are stopping here&mdash;no, I don't
  know where we are going to have luncheon&mdash;oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, Mamma
  said, blow your nose, don't wipe it on your glove!"</p>

  <p>The smart equipage drew up outside the convent gates, the footman sprang
  from the box-seat and jangled the long iron bell-pull; little Marie continued
  to scrape her feet on the floor of the carriage and to dab at her nose with
  the tips of her white kid gloves.</p>

  <p>The mother leaned back on the cushions with an air of elegant exhaustion;
  she was a good-looking young woman, fashionably dressed in a fur pelisse,
  which protected her from the winds of March, and a high black felt hat
  covered with ribbons and plumes. The child also was warmly and handsomely
  clad in green cloth braided with silk in military style and had a sable
  tippet and muff; with suspicion verging on bad temper she eyed her bored and
  languid mother.</p>

  <p>"Why are we stopping here? I don't like this place! Why have we come so
  far? Why didn't I go in the Tuileries to-day? I am hungry and I have eaten
  all my sweets."</p>

  <p>Madame Cappelle cast up her eyes and hands to heaven as if she dedicated
  her fatigue and tedium as an offering to her patron saint, and descended from
  the carriage followed by the reluctant and hostile child.</p>

  <p>The convent portress admitted them at once; as the gates closed behind
  them Marie had the sensation of being drowned in high waves, the tall
  buildings of the ancient abbey about her seemed to overwhelm her small person
  and to blot out earth and sky, to eclipse everything with which she was
  familiar.</p>

  <p>The <i>surintendante</i> of the convent, Madame de Bourgoing, received
  Madame Cappelle and her daughter in an austere parlour where gloomy religious
  pictures hung on the dark walls.</p>

  <p>The lady was very courteously received, for she had been introduced by
  Maréchal Macdonald, who was the chief of this <i>maison royale de
  Saint-Denis</i>, and, it seemed, a close friend of M. Collard, father of
  Madame Cappelle.</p>

  <p>Influenced by these circumstances, Madame de Bourgoing embraced and kissed
  little Marie, exclaiming tenderly:</p>

  <p>"So, madame, I have one daughter more!"</p>

  <p>"What!" cried the child, fiercely. "This is a <i>pension</i> and I am to
  remain!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Madame Cappelle, sighing with weariness. "I did not dare
  tell you, Marie, I feared a scene. Ah, madame,"&mdash;she turned to the
  <i>surintendante</i>&mdash;"you must be prepared for scenes, cries of
  despair, fits of temper!"</p>

  <p>"One is always prepared, madame. It is a question of discipline."</p>

  <p>Marie was overwhelmed by this black treachery on the part of her mother,
  but pride prevented her from making the display of emotion that Madame
  Cappelle expected; she turned away and, consumed with rage and self-pity,
  pressed her face against the window-pane.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour, the mother, speaking quickly, nervously,
  detailed her daughter's faults. Madame de Bourgoing did not listen; she sat
  with an air of attention, a sympathetic smile on her face, her thoughts far
  away on her housekeeping accounts; but Marie drank in every word.</p>

  <p>"Her grandmother and her father have spoiled the little one, madame! She
  was so delicate, we feared to lose her, every caprice was indulged! M.
  Collard allowed her to run wild at Villers-Hellon, his estate in Picardy.
  Then we were at Douai, where my husband had command of the garrison, and
  there, conceive my terrors, madame, M. Cappelle allowed Marie to attend the
  Sunday parades! I used to smother her with toys and sweets to distract her,
  but no, as soon as my husband had his sword on, she was round his neck
  weeping&mdash;and one gave way!"</p>

  <p>"It is a pity, for the little one's sake, always to give way," said the
  bland nun mechanically.</p>

  <p>"She used to go with Ursule, her nurse. I never could support such a
  spectacle! Imagine&mdash;she used to be allowed to fire the little cannon, to
  handle the bayonets! To march with the regiment! Never would she learn
  anything from me&mdash;but when we were at Mézières she learned reading and
  deportment from a sergeant-major! I tried to have her taught scripture,
  geography, music, but she used to run away and hide on the ramparts."</p>

  <p>Madame de Bourgoing recalled her thoughts to this rambling monologue and
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"And when you came to Paris your difficulties, madame, were
  augmented?"</p>

  <p>"They became impossible! Marie, deprived of her wild life, was morose,
  violent&mdash;the scenes, <i>mon Dieu!</i> She is quite unmanageable! My
  health has suffered, I assure you, madame! I have another daughter, so
  different, an angel, my little Antonine! Marie has always been so
  jealous&mdash;it is terrible! I must tell you that when she was five years
  old we allowed her to act as <i>marraine</i> for her little cousin&mdash;she
  learnt for a whole month what she had to say, but when she came into the
  church with a great bouquet&mdash;ribbons from her head to her feet&mdash;she
  forgot every word! Worse, when the schoolmaster&mdash;we were at
  Villers-Hellon&mdash;instead of whispering them to her, spoke them out loud,
  she sulked, threw down her bouquet and refused the excellent <i>dragées</i>
  that my father gave her! She passed the rest of that day in a dark
  closet..."</p>

  <p>"One understands," put in the nun gently, "that a spoiled child presents a
  problem."</p>

  <p>Madame Cappelle glanced over her shoulder at the mute little figure in the
  window.</p>

  <p>"We have an apartment in Paris&mdash;my husband is in Valence with his
  regiment&mdash;and Marie jumps and climbs all over the place, upsetting
  things, breaking things. Only this morning, a Swiss vase! My nerves really
  cannot support it! We have only the one <i>salon</i> and when I have a
  visitor Marie has to be sent to the bedchamber. I have had masters for her,
  but she refuses to learn&mdash;she will not, for instance, practise her
  scales and exercises, but must try to play some tunes she heard the shepherds
  sing in Picardy."</p>

  <p>Madame de Bourgoing thought that courtesy&mdash;even that due to a friend
  of Maréchal Macdonald's&mdash;had been satisfied; she rose and touched a
  hand-bell.</p>

  <p>"We shall do our best for your little girl, madame. We have two hundred
  pupils here, all from the first families in France, so we have considerable
  experience in training young ladies."</p>

  <p>Madame Cappelle, as if trying to justify her action in sending Marie from
  home, still continued to lament her child's faults; a nun entered the room
  and went at once to the little girl standing rigid in the window.</p>

  <p>Marie's first impulse was to make what her mother termed "a scene"; but,
  since she knew that that was what the three women were expecting, she
  controlled herself and marched proudly out of the room behind the dark
  billowing draperies of the nun.</p>

  <p>It was Madame Cappelle that began to weep, from vexation, fatigue and
  remorse. Madame de Bourgoing offered her a vinaigrette and spoke a few words
  of consolation; she was used to these frivolous women who could neither
  manage their children nor give them up. While the lady recovered herself the
  <i>surintendante</i> wrote in the school register particulars of her new
  pupil:</p>

  <p class="letter">Marie-Fortunée Cappelle, born 1816, daughter of M.
  Cappelle, Lieutenant-Colonel of Artillery (formerly an officer in the
  Imperial Guard of the Emperor Napoleon), at present in command of the
  garrison at Valence, and of Madame Cappelle, formerly Mlle. Collard, daughter
  of M. Collard, formerly Quartermaster-General of the Republic.</p>

  <p>Little Marie Cappelle, then, came through both parents of distinguished
  families, of good positions and reputations.</p>

  <p>Madame de Bourgoing knew, though she did not add these particulars to her
  register, that both Madame Cappelle's sisters were married well, one to M. le
  baron de Martens, a Prussian diplomat, the other to M. le baron Garat,
  Secretary to the Bank of France.</p>

  <p>The family of little Marie had friends also who were very well-placed and
  influential, besides Maréchal Macdonald. One of these was M. le prince de
  Talleyrand-Périgord, another was the daughter of that Madame de
  Genlis-Sillery who had been governess to the children of Philippe-Egalité,
  one of her former pupils; the present M. le duc d'Orléans had not
  infrequently visited Villers-Hellon.</p>

  <p>It was a satisfactory record; the nun smiled across at Madame Cappelle,
  who was drying her handsome dark eyes with a handkerchief bordered with
  <i>point d'Alençon</i>.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter shares your own political sympathies, madame&mdash;she is
  Bonapartist?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, poor little one! A picture of the imperial angel, the King of Rome,
  hangs always above her bed!"</p>

  <p>"She will find a number of young ladies here who share her enthusiasm on
  that point&mdash;we have every shade of political opinion at Saint-Denis,"
  smiled the nun, then, with the first shade of genuine interest that she had
  shown: "But your family, madame, had royalist connections&mdash;your mother
  had the honour of sharing the education of M. le duc d'Orléans?"</p>

  <p>The lady smiled with a touch of reserve.</p>

  <p>"My mother was the daughter of M. Campton, a colonel in the English army.
  She was orphaned at nine years of age, and Madame de Genlis-Sillery, then in
  England, had the goodness to rescue the poor orphan and to introduce her into
  the household of M. d'Orléans."</p>

  <p>The vivacious glance of Madame Cappelle seemed to contradict her
  words&mdash;as if she conveyed to her hearer the permission to put any
  interpretation she chose on this romantic tale.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The sister took Marie to the ward-room and there gently told her to
  undress herself; the child obeyed in bitter silence, taking off her fine
  braided coat, her charming frock of green silk, her fichu and scarf of white
  lace, her petticoat frilled with flounces of Indian muslin, her long
  <i>culottes</i> tied with pink ribbons, her green silk sandals and white silk
  stockings.</p>

  <p>In her elegant chemise she stood rigidly by the stove, eyeing the nun with
  hatred.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle was nine years of age, yellow-complexioned, thin to an
  alarming extent, tall for her age; her heavy hair, of a dense black, hung
  straight down her back, her forehead was high and prominent, her nose was
  long and delicate, her lips well-shaped and firmly pressed together, her eyes
  large, dark and expressive; there were pride and grace in her movements, in
  the carriage of her head, in the ease of her walk, in the movements of her
  hands.</p>

  <p>Even humbled and defeated in her little chemise, with her bony limbs
  revealed and her face pallid with suppressed passion, she was extremely
  elegant.</p>

  <p>With the indifference of one who performs a routine duty the nun put away
  the Parisian finery and brought out the articles of clothing that formed the
  uniform of a boarder in the school of Saint-Denis&mdash;a long black robe, a
  bonnet of the same material, thick woollen stockings, coarse heavy shoes, and
  a large black bag, which each pupil had to keep always under her arm.</p>

  <p>With considerable courage the child allowed herself to be clothed in these
  garments that appeared to her hideous and degrading beyond words and to be
  led again to the parlour where her mother still lingered, uneasy,
  regretful.</p>

  <p>When Madame Cappelle saw her daughter in the gloomy black robe she burst
  into tears and embraced Marie in a passion of affection and remorse; the
  little girl, although alarmingly pale, retained her dignified silence; the
  distressed mother fled from the parlour and Marie was taken to the dormitory
  that she might be shown her bed.</p>

  <p>It was one of two hundred, which stood side by side in the large, long,
  whitewashed room lit by plain, uncurtained windows, between which were lamps
  in brackets.</p>

  <p>Timidly waiting to welcome Marie Cappelle were two other little girls,
  Marie, daughter of General Daumesnil, a friend of infancy, and Mlle. Vallin,
  a niece of Marie's aunt, Mme. Garat. Completely ignoring their consolations,
  the newcomer flung herself on her bed and gave vent to her pent-up rage and
  despair; she flung off the bonnet, kicked off her shoes, dragged at her
  coarse robe, and, with cries and sobs, screamed for her father, her
  grandfather to come and rescue her!</p>

  <p>One of the teachers, Mlle. Flurot, who had met Marie in her mother's
  <i>salon</i>, rushed up with vivacious comfort, but the desperate child
  continued to roll on the bed in violent hysterics, biting the sheets, kicking
  and screaming.</p>

  <p>Attracted by this scene, one of the elder pupils came up and, staring down
  at Marie, remarked scornfully:</p>

  <p>"Silly little fool! She is certainly a Bonapartist!"</p>

  <p>Marie heard the taunt, sat up and screamed:</p>

  <p>"Treacherous royalist!" and kicked the other child on the shins. "I shall
  report you, little rat!" yelled the loyal follower of Charles X.</p>

  <p>"Report," retorted Marie with great spirit, "that you are stupid and
  wicked and that will be nothing fresh to those who know you!"</p>

  <p>This sally was greeted with laughter by the girls gathered round the bed;
  the royalist was not popular and sympathy was with Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>"Little rat!" repeated the other child, and flung away.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Marie," said Mlle. Daumesnil, "there are many Bonapartists
  here&mdash;you shall meet them all and they will make much of you because of
  your father and grandfather."</p>

  <p>The mention of these two adored relatives caused Marie to burst into sobs
  again.</p>

  <p>"Come," urged the assistant mistress, Mlle. Flurot, in a hopeless attempt
  at severity, "you have a holiday to-day, your first day. You, Mlle.
  Daumesnil, will take charge of your little friend. Take her to the
  music-room, I know that she is fond of the piano."</p>

  <p>After much coaxing, Marie consented to accompany her little guardian and a
  small troop of followers to the music-room.</p>

  <p>This was a large chamber, in which were fifty pianos; at each instrument
  sat a pupil, and the air was torn by fifty different exercises, cadenzas,
  romances, scales and valses, all being rendered with various degrees of
  strength and skill.</p>

  <p>A girl gladly gave up her place to Marie, who mounted the round red stool
  only to howl louder, her nerves further shaken by the infernal discords of
  the maltreated pianos.</p>

  <p>"How difficult she is," sighed Mlle. Daumesnil. "Ah, there is the
  dinner-bell!"</p>

  <p>Marie, dragged into the refectory, refused to touch the thin soup and
  coarse bread; when the meal was over, her bored guardian took her into the
  garden, and there, disgusted with her continuous tears, abandoned her on a
  bench.</p>

  <p>"Papa! Mamma! Antonine! Ursule!" screamed Marie, shivering in the March
  wind that blew keenly round the walls and towers of the ancient abbey.</p>

  <p>Her enemy, the royalist, who had been following her at a prudent distance,
  now seeing that she was alone, approached and, with great skill, kicked the
  unsuspecting Marie on the shins.</p>

  <p>"There is your kick returned to you, little rat!"</p>

  <p>Excess of rage produced a fit or seizure in the ill-treated Marie; she
  fell off the bench in convulsions that alarmed the other child, who ran back
  crying into the building.</p>

  <p>Mlle. Flurot came hastening out and Marie was dragged to a <i>cabinet de
  toilette</i> and held under one of the faucets; the strong jet of cold water
  soon quieted her, but her nose began to bleed. To cure this, a large
  door-key, chill as ice, was slipped down her back; she was then taken to
  Madame de Bourgoing, who gave her a routine lecture on obedience, submission
  and a few other of the more unpopular Christian virtues.</p>

  <p>Marie was now utterly exhausted and allowed herself to be put to bed
  without further protests. As soon, however, as the lights were out, Mlle.
  Daumesnil, who had the next bed to hers, roused her and whispered that she
  would introduce her to a Bonapartist club that met every evening in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Half-unconscious from fatigue and need of sleep, Marie pattered after the
  other children into the long corridor that ran behind the dormitory; this was
  lit by one oil lamp set high on the wall.</p>

  <p>Shivering in their calico nightgowns, the little girls crouched under this
  dim light and consulted in whispers on the best means of effecting a
  Bonapartist restoration. Marie, because of her father, a former officer of
  the Imperial Guard, and her grandfather, a friend of the Emperor's, was
  treated with great respect. Half-delirious from fatigue, she began to
  boast:</p>

  <p>"My grandmother was a princess&mdash;I remember her, in a long red shawl,
  bending over my cradle. She used to sit up in bed and unroll balls of
  coloured ribbons to amuse me&mdash;she was blonde and rosy..."</p>

  <p>"Not like you, then," interrupted a vivacious girl. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how
  thin and yellow she is!"</p>

  <p>"But very distinguished," said Mlle. Daumesnil hastily, seeing Marie's
  swollen eyes flash.</p>

  <p>"When I was at Villers-Hellon I used to ride on a sheep&mdash;a merino
  sheep. Once I fell down under a plum-tree and broke my arm&mdash;Ursule, my
  nurse, was not looking for me, she was flirting with a gardener..."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" A shiver of delicious apprehension ran through the little group of
  conspirators. "One of the sisters is coming!"</p>

  <p>There was a clever, noiseless scamper back to the straight white beds and
  skilfully feigned snores broke the silence when the nun, going her rounds,
  looked in at the dormitory.</p>

  <p>In the morning Marie woke with <i>la grippe</i>, a touch of fever and a
  sensation of complete despair.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was a long time before Marie Cappelle could accustom herself to the sad
  routine of Saint-Denis.</p>

  <p>At six in the morning the bell rang, each of the pupils dragged a comb
  through her hair, when they hastened, twenty at a time, into a <i>cabinet de
  toilette</i>, where several taps were placed over a metal bath.</p>

  <p>Even in March this room was unheated and the water icy; the girls never
  washed, but stood watching the taps splash the cold streams into the bath,
  while they strove to retain the warmth of their beds by quickly huddling on
  their clothes.</p>

  <p>Marie's fastidious folly in really bathing her face caused much amusement,
  and the greenish-blue tint that her sallow complexion assumed provoked lively
  mockery; several of the other girls informed her that she was not only plain
  but ugly, and when she told them that she had been born on her father's
  <i>jour de fête</i>, they danced round her jeering.</p>

  <p>"What a fine bouquet! What a lovely birthday present!"</p>

  <p>After the toilet came Mass; the little girls trooped into the dark,
  beautiful Gothic chapel and listened to supplications to God to render them
  good children and to give their parents health and happiness. The chaplain
  then read a long prayer for the Pope, the King, the bishops, the deacons, the
  archdeacons...</p>

  <p>By the time this was reached, the younger children, bending forward on
  their knees, were asleep, and the elder ones were either mechanically
  repeating the words of the priest or reading some romance that they had
  contrived to slip inside their prayer-books.</p>

  <p>The Mass over, the children went, two and two, to the refectory, where bad
  soup and coarse bread were served out; then there was a short "break" in the
  cloisters, supposed to be for preparing lessons but spent in giggling and
  gossiping.</p>

  <p>It had been found difficult to place Marie in the classes; she knew a
  little of everything but nothing well. Finally she was allowed to take her
  place in the class where Marie Daumesnil worked so industriously; the new
  student's quick intelligence soon gave her a reputation for brilliancy; no
  one was sufficiently interested in her to observe that her facility in
  learning was extremely superficial.</p>

  <p>At delicate embroidery, at essay-writing, at repartee she was really
  clever; courage supported her lively pride; she not only insulted but fought
  the royalists, and so gained the respect of the daughters and granddaughters
  of Napoleon's former generals and courtiers, who formed such a powerful
  section of the boarders at Saint-Denis.</p>

  <p>The lessons caused Marie no difficulty, but practising on one of the fifty
  pianos during the music hour always gave her a headache and sometimes brought
  on a severe "nervous crisis."</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock, supper, of the plainest fare, was served, then more
  prayers that seemed the very essence of tedium, and then bed.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle was not a success as a pupil; she was continually tripping
  over her clumsy robe, forgetting the large bag in which her handkerchiefs and
  copybooks were kept, omitting to drop a curtsy every time she opened or
  closed a door and running into supper without the large hat the girls wore at
  meal times.</p>

  <p>She upset the classes by taking the wrong place on the bench, by giggling,
  by talking in a high-pitched voice; for these and similar acts of frivolity
  she was frequently condemned, as a sign of disgrace, to wear her hat or
  bonnet back to front.</p>

  <p>Insupportable as the children found the tyranny exercised over their
  actions, they enjoyed complete freedom of thought; if a girl was decorous in
  her behaviour, neat in her person, she was considered virtuous. The lessons
  were well taught, the mistresses grounded the pupils thoroughly in the
  various subjects, but they never spoke with the girls nor strove in any way
  to influence them; lessons over, the mistresses withdrew into their own
  lives, and the children, clustering together, exchanged romantic, false and
  silly ideas.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle soon had her little group of admirers to whom she would
  relate amusing tales of the splendours and grandeurs of her family and the
  glories of Villers-Hellon, where, drawn in her little cart under the trees,
  she had been really happy; she gave lively sketches of her faithful and
  adoring servants&mdash;Mamie, the chief <i>femme de chambre</i>, fat, round,
  with her huge bunch of keys, her eternal smile, her spectacles perched on her
  tiny nose; La her mother's maid, who had been in the service of Madame
  Collard, tall, thin, philosophical, always ready with a wonderful tale,
  <i>Bluebeard, The Wild Ass's Skin, The Sleeping Beauty</i>; Briquet, the
  coachman, proud of his smart <i>calèche</i> and his handsome horses; Durand,
  the <i>chef de cuisine</i>, who wept with emotion when mixing one of his
  famous sauces.</p>

  <p>"It is a <i>château</i>, Villers-Hellon, you understand," insisted Marie,
  talking rapidly with elegant gestures. "There are gracious meadows, avenues
  of walnuts, apple orchards, a lake bordered with lime-trees, a stream with
  water-cresses&mdash;all the families near are rich and noble, they all visit
  my grandfather. There is Madame Elmore, her father, M. Séquin, is a
  millionaire, he was the contractor for the armies in Spain, he is very
  eccentric&mdash;ah, I could tell you some stories about him! There is Madame
  la maréchale Gérard, who is the daughter of Madame de Genlis-Sillery..."</p>

  <p>As Marie's breath failed, her loyal friend, Mlle. Daumesnil, put in words
  of confirmation and support.</p>

  <p>"My father, who is called the hero of Vincennes, lives near
  Villers-Hellon. It is a superb <i>château</i>! Close by lives Madame la
  vicomtesse de Montesquiou at Long-Pont&mdash;there are other <i>châteaux</i>,
  that of Madame d'Eckmühl, that of M. de Violaine, who is the Chief Inspector
  of Forests..."</p>

  <p>Marie rushed into words again.</p>

  <p>"But Covey! Ah, that is the finest <i>château</i> in Picardy! My dearest
  friend visits there, my sweet, adorable Marie de Nicolai..."</p>

  <p>Her black eyes filled with facile tears and she ran on about her
  grandmother.</p>

  <p>"She died when I was six years old, but I remember her so well&mdash;she
  taught me about flowers, about birds, she had a pretty <i>volière</i>. M.
  d'Orléans used to come and visit her..."</p>

  <p>"Tell us something amusing, Marie," came a rebellious voice. Fearful of
  losing her audience, the little girl changed her tone at once and began with
  a malicious air:</p>

  <p>"My father had M. de Talleyrand-Périgord for his <i>parrain</i>, and
  Napoleon's delicious sister, Pauline, for his <i>commère</i>.</p>

  <p>"The Prince wished to do everything handsomely to show his luxury and good
  taste, so he ordered a most costly <i>corbeille</i> from Paris." Marie closed
  her eyes and clasped her hands dramatically. "A most <i>beautiful</i> gilt
  basket, tied with rainbow-coloured ribbons and adorned with <i>exquisite</i>
  flowers in wax and velvet&mdash;inside were the choicest bonbons and the most
  delicious articles for the toilet, in the fashions of to-morrow, you
  understand. M. de Talleyrand described this beautiful basket so
  enthusiastically that everyone crowded round when it arrived. It was
  undone..." Marie opened her great black bag and added impressively, "and, my
  little ones, what was found? Plaster bonbons, faded ribbons a year old, torn
  old scarves, paper flowers and huge cotton gloves! Madame de Talleyrand had,
  in a moment of spite, made the exchange! I saw the Prince blanch with
  rage."</p>

  <p>Among the murmurs of admiration was one jarring question:</p>

  <p>"How could you <i>know</i>, Marie, what happened at your father's
  baptism?"</p>

  <p>"My grandmother often told this story..."</p>

  <p>"But you said that you <i>saw</i> M. de Talleyrand blanch with rage."</p>

  <p>"That was another time&mdash;M. de Talleyrand came to Villers-Hellon when
  I was about six years old," replied Marie without the least confusion.
  "Someone reminded him of that fatal baptism..."</p>

  <p>"You are making it all up," interrupted the objector, rising. "I think you
  make up a lot of things, Marie. I don't believe that your grandmother was a
  Princess."</p>

  <p>"She was! But it is a secret, I must never speak of it&mdash;the secret of
  the cradle, my grandfather calls it. Her sister, my great-aunt, was named
  Pamela, she married an Irish lord, who led an army against the King of
  England&mdash;and died a martyr for his country!"</p>

  <p>"Bah!" replied the sceptic with a rude gesture. "You are a liar!"</p>

  <p>Marie sprang up and a brief scuffle ensued, which ended in Mlle. Flurot's
  coming on the scene and dragging Marie before Madame de Bourgoing. This lady
  was totally occupied with a private grief; the loss of an adored relative
  paralysed her heart, and she was even more indifferent than usual to her
  charges, erect, pale, with the <i>cordon</i> of the <i>légion d'honneur</i>
  on her breast, she listened wearily to the assistant mistress's account of
  Marie Cappellethe child was so romantic, so frivolous, so light, so
  disobedient! She was always turning the heads of the other girls with her
  crazy stories.</p>

  <p>The <i>surintendante</i> forced herself to do her duty; Marie, looking
  ridiculous in her heavy robe, with her hat, as usual, round the wrong way in
  token of disgrace, was perched on a high chair, crying loudly, knuckling her
  eyes with soiled fingers so that dirt apd tears mingled on her thin
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," thought Madame de Bourgoing, "it is a hideous little
  rat&mdash;and of such an excellent family!"</p>

  <p>Aloud she said:</p>

  <p>"My child, how is it that you are always in trouble, always discontented?
  Try to control yourself and tell me what you would like."</p>

  <p>"I should like, madame, to return to Villers-Hellon."</p>

  <p>"One understands. You love your grandfather and your parents, of
  course."</p>

  <p>Marie sniffed back her tears, her sobs.</p>

  <p>"I like the life too, madame, liberty..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and what else? Tell me frankly, <i>ma petite</i>, what sort of life
  you do like?"</p>

  <p>The child heaved a great sigh.</p>

  <p>"I like elegance and luxury." She warmed to her subject, her eyes flashed,
  her voice became eloquent. "A delicious <i>salon</i>, perfumed with costly
  flowers, lit by a thousand wax candles, set in crystal..."</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to find such places, Marie."</p>

  <p>"M. Séquin has such a room in his <i>château</i>..."</p>

  <p>"M. Séquin," replied Madame de Bourgoing dryly, "is a millionaire. He was
  once a poor chemist in a very small way who chanced to discover a method of
  tanning leather, very useful to the armies of the Republic&mdash;he remains a
  <i>parvenu</i>..."</p>

  <p>In her excitement Marie dared to interrupt the <i>surintendante</i>:</p>

  <p>"He gives the most sumptuous children's balls, in the best of taste! There
  are others, too..."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Madame de Bourgoing roused herself wearily. "You have very worldly
  tastes, you are a naughty girl, you don't always tell the truth&mdash;I fear
  that you have been very much spoiled..."</p>

  <p>The lecture ran on. Marie sat rigid, with closed eyes, in bitter
  rebellion.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie Cappelle came to see Marie about once a month, always on Sundays,
  and always in the presence of Madame de Bourgoing, so that the child was
  restrained and sullen, refusing to confide in her mother while the
  <i>surintendante</i> was present.</p>

  <p>These visits brought no relief to the exile, as she considered herself;
  her agony of nostalgia was rather increased by the sight of her pretty mother
  in her elegant robes, with her fashionable veils, feathers and perfumes, her
  little cries of affection, her warm kisses.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she brought Antonine, adorable in satin and swansdown, lisping
  over a new toy or a box of <i>dragées</i>, and then Marie's jealous pain
  would bring on attacks of vomiting, which the nuns treated with black pills
  and chicory water.</p>

  <p>The lively spirit, however, gradually began to make the best of her
  slavery; she learnt her lessons without difficulty and was soon at the top of
  all her classes, and she became a very active figure in the
  royalist-bonapartist feuds. These were organised by the oldest girls, who
  were about sixteen years of age; each of these enrolled several younger
  pupils as her servitors, and in return for their labours rewarded them, if
  she were a royalist, with copies of some of Béranger's songs or popular hymns
  written on the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux, son of the murdered Duc de
  Berri, if she were an Imperialist, she gratified her followers with scraps of
  tricolour ribbon, tiny metal eagles or little portraits of the King of
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle, always accompanied by Marie Daumesnil, entered into these
  intrigues with a spirit that led her into many escapades, followed by sermons
  and punishments. In the evenings the two little girls, holding each other's
  hand outstretched from the straight white beds, would whisper together of the
  holidays to come, of Antonine, of Marie Daumesnil's brother, of their hero
  Napoleon I, of General Daumesnil's wooden leg.</p>

  <p>When Marie could obtain a little liberty she made a daring use of it,
  leaping along the cloisters, sliding down the banisters of the great
  staircase, executing <i>pirouettes</i> and dance-steps even in the
  chapel.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When Marie had been at Saint-Denis for nearly a year she was taken ill
  with inflammation of the stomach. Her mother had joined M. Cappelle in
  Valence, and her place was taken by her sister Louise, Madame la baronne de
  Garat, a charming girl who had all the delicate grace and sweetness of a
  moss-rose; this exquisite creature constantly visited her niece, and when she
  was convalescent, begged a month's holiday for her; this was granted and
  Marie was taken to the handsome apartment of M. Garat over the offices of the
  Bank of France in the centre of Paris.</p>

  <p>Every kind of pleasure was heaped on the little invalid; friends, in
  particular a M. de Brack, took her for drives in elegant tilburies, she was
  given a dinner at the <i>Café Anglais</i> and taken to the theatre; on all
  these occasions she returned home laden with toys, bonbons and new
  clothes.</p>

  <p>She was taken to see M. Cuvier and yawned through the learned conversation
  in the cabinet of the <i>savant</i>; she was taken to wait on Mlle. Mars, of
  whom she had heard so much, and was disappointed at finding that the famous
  actress looked a very ordinary person. Wrapped in a white <i>peignoir</i>,
  Mlle. Mars offered her little visitor <i>marrons glacés</i> and talked in a
  most melodious voice of the fluctuations of the Stock Exchange.</p>

  <p>Marie visited the Opéra and the <i>Porte-Saint-Martin</i>, where she was
  ravished with the spectacle of <i>Les petites Danaïdes</i>, but the greatest
  joy she experienced was when a lackey covered with gold braid brought an
  invitation from Madame d'Orléans to a children's ball at the Palais-Royal; M.
  de Brack offered to buy her costume from Victorine, most <i>chic</i> of
  dressmakers, and Marie could scarcely contain her rapture.</p>

  <p>The night before the ball she had her straight black locks put into fifty
  curl-papers, screwed so tight on to her head that she could not sleep; her
  dress was of azure-coloured crape, which unfortunately heightened the yellow
  tinge of her complexion; her wonderful little blue shoes were much too tight
  and by the time she reached the palace she was nearly crying with pain,
  fatigue and vexation; the remembrance of her reflection in the mirror was not
  reassuring.</p>

  <p>The Garat party entered the ballroom as the charming little Sicilian
  Princess, the Duchesse de Berri, was opening the ball with a quadrille, she
  wore a romantic dress of white crape trimmed with rose-coloured and white
  plumes, a garland of similar feathers was in her fair, rather untidy hair,
  she was plump and squinted.</p>

  <p>"Her <i>toilette</i> is prettier than her face," whispered Marie
  spitefully.</p>

  <p>The Dauphine, once known as "The Orphan of the Temple," was pointed out to
  Marie, who declared that this martyr Princess looked dull and pedantic. Marie
  was presented to the exquisite Orleans children, and M. le duc de Nemours,
  who was about her own age, offered to dance a grand galop with her;
  unfortunately Monseigneur did not know his steps and trod continually on his
  partner's feet, already aching viciously from the tight shoes. Marie left the
  ball in tears, feeling that the evening from which so much had been hoped had
  proved a failure; Cinderella had not met the prince or even been admired.</p>

  <p>Madame Garat tried to console her by whispering to her that she was really
  related to all these princes and princesses: "But you must not talk about it,
  Marie, it is a secret."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Exhausted by late nights, excitement, rich food, renewed pain in her
  irritated stomach, weakened by hot rooms, lack of exercise and the infected
  air of theatres, <i>salons</i> and closed carriages, Marie returned to
  Saint-Denis in the depth of winter, to cold-water bathing, long hours in an
  icy chapel, poor meals, hard bed, rough clothes, and a furious discontent of
  spirit.</p>

  <p>After a few days of vigorous treatment she became ill again, this time
  seriously; brain fever developed, and Marie, now in a room by herself, raved
  in delirium, accusing her mother, her father, her grandfather of black
  treachery in sending her to Saint-Denis.</p>

  <p>Her doctor wrote to the parents at Valence that it was doubtful if she
  could survive, and Madame Cappelle hastened to Paris, in an agony of terror,
  her horses galloping from stage to stage in furious haste. When the
  remorseful mother joined Madame Garat at the bedside of the raving Marie, the
  child, burnt with fever, had been in a delirium for nearly fifteen days; she
  recognised Madame Cappelle, however, and frantically implored her to take her
  away&mdash;and, for ever&mdash;from Saint-Denis. This hoarsely whispered
  request was instantly granted and the invalid, not without a sigh of triumph,
  sank into a long slumber.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>As soon as Marie could be moved she was taken to Villers-Hellon; the
  spring was sweetening the meadows of Picardy, the <i>château</i> was <i>en
  fête</i> for the invalid, who was not to think of lessons and was to be
  indulged in every possible way; she was delivered to the care of the devoted
  Lalo and everyone in Villers-Hellon, from her grandfather, M. Collard, to the
  humblest shepherd, was at her service.</p>

  <p>When she became stronger there were balls, concerts, picnics, given in her
  honour, and M. Elmore, the English son-in-law of M. Séquin, the eccentric
  millionaire, taught her to ride; a smart grey pony was bought for her, and
  she became a daring horsewoman, leaping ditches and hedges with little cries
  of excitement.</p>

  <p>During the summer the neighbouring <i>châteaux</i> were filled with
  elegant company and Marie was petted by all these elegant Parisians <i>en
  vacances</i>; everything was very brilliant; during the day there were
  <i>fêtes</i>, held in the forests, during the evening comedies were played in
  the <i>salons</i>; seated at her grandfather's knee, Marie heard him discuss
  the glories of his youth with M. de Montrond, who also had flourished under
  the Directory; the child heard the names of Mmes. Roland, Tallien, de Genlis,
  and de Staël whispered by the elegant, handsome old men.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In November Marie accompanied her mother, sister and a train of servants
  to Strasbourg; the eager child, peering from the window of the heavy
  travelling-carriage, saw with delight the pure opal tints of the mountains
  rising into the deep blue sky above the dark pines of the Black Forest, then
  the Rhine veiled in vapours that took fantastic shapes, then the rigid grace
  of the spire of Strasbourg Cathedral, impressive against the delicate clouds
  of the horizon.</p>

  <p>As the great city was approached, Marie admired the rich campaign, the
  prosperous little villages, the dark firs along the chain of the Vosges,
  Saverne coquettishly perched on a little hill, the Gothic ruins through which
  the sun cast a golden glow; the sound of a hastening horse roused the child,
  leaning farther from the window she screamed: "Papa!" The cavalier
  approached; it was M. Cappelle; frantic greetings were exchanged between him
  and his family, he gave his horse to a groom and took the box seat of the
  carriage, Marie on his knee, half fainting with ecstasy, as they drove
  through the superb country and the gorgeous autumn morning.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie's life in Strasbourg was as enchanting as even her nature, romantic,
  luxurious, avid for pleasures, yet fastidious and squeamish, could have
  desired; her father was in command of the garrison and Madame Cappelle
  therefore moved in the first society, which was not only gay, but as Marie
  said "<i>follement joyeuse</i>."</p>

  <p>In the intervals between amusements, Marie had lessons in the piano, in
  history, in literature, in fencing. All the time that her father could spare
  from his duties was given to her; he was her companion on long horseback
  rides beyond the city, in the <i>salle d'armes</i>, where he sometimes
  permitted her to beat him with the foils, and on the ramparts, where the girl
  again was allowed to handle a bayonet and to fire a cannon.</p>

  <p>When M. Cappelle was occupied with his soldiers, Marie and her friends
  diverted themselves under the charge of Ursule; in the winter they played in
  the snow that lay thick in the fields beyond the walls, creeping, when cold
  and tired, into the clean stables of a cosy farm, to heat themselves against
  the warm flanks of the cows.</p>

  <p>Crouching in the fragrant hay the girls discussed the future, balls,
  husbands, babies.</p>

  <p>In the summer they fastened swings between the walnut trees in the garden,
  or worked at delicate pieces of embroidery, which they sold for the benefit
  of poor children; sometimes they were joined by the young soldier son of
  General Neigre who, putting an apron over his uniform, would help them to
  make bonbons, play at <i>cache-cache</i> with them, or indulge in a romping
  game of blind-man's-buff. The Christmas she passed in Strasbourg was a time
  of great excitement for Marie.</p>

  <p>Several days before this great festival there was an air of excitement in
  the old Alsatian city and the <i>Place de la Cathédrale</i> was covered with
  stalls, where all kinds of merchandise were sold. On Christmas Eve Marie and
  her friends were gathered in the ante-chamber of the <i>grand salon</i>, a
  signal was given, the folding doors were opened and in the darkened chamber
  the Christmas tree was revealed, a splendid tree; the topmost boughs touched
  the ceiling, the stem rose from an immense cake, a thousand little candles
  twinkled among the black pine-needles and gleamed on the clusters of bonbons
  and sugar candles hanging on the boughs; above all hovered two waxen cherubim
  with gauze wings; round the tree were tables; each had the name of a child,
  and candles to the number of that child's years; these tables were covered
  with beautiful surprises, dolls, toys, sweetmeats, a pair of spectacles, a
  Bible, a portrait of a dear absent one, a toy gun, a toy whip, fruits,
  ribbons, flowers, everywhere joy, ecstasy, thanks, kisses, which seemed as if
  they would never end, a perfume of delight, of nameless excitement.</p>

  <p>No one read the wise advice printed on the ribbons that floated from the
  waxen cherubim, "Be good, be discreet, be pious."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>With the spring Marie returned to Villers-Hellon and was prepared for her
  first communion; she learned Scripture, the catechism, she visited the
  cottages of the poorest peasants and gave them food and clothes; her
  grandfather made her his almoner and she was delighted to be blessed by his
  grateful dependants; an aroma of sanctity began to pervade her existence, she
  felt exalted, full of tenderness and a delicious melancholy, she saw herself
  as the Christian virgin, pure and meek, dedicating herself to God; when the
  solemn day arrived&mdash;that of <i>Fête-Dieu</i> (Corpus-Christi), she was
  almost overwhelmed by an emotion that was partly spiritual, partly sensual,
  and that was much heightened by her pleasure in her exquisite white robe and
  fine veil, which floated about her like an angelic benediction.</p>

  <p>Her mother crowned her with a garland of jasmine, symbol of innocence and
  piety, and wept as she gave her blessing to the slender figure kneeling
  before her; the bells sounded from the village church and Marie Cappelle, her
  hands crossed on her bosom, her eyes downcast, joined the procession of
  white-clad young girls.</p>

  <p>The rich Gothic interior of the ancient church had been adorned with
  garlands of flowers; the altar was nearly hidden under branches of white
  lilac, acacia and myrtle, chains of cornflowers and daisies encircled the
  thick candles of scented wax, which stood either side of the tabernacle;
  trembling with emotion under their gauze veils and coronals of white flowers
  the girls sang the praises of the Lord.</p>

  <p>The <i>curé</i> of Villers-Hellon, a young man, and one who had always
  been indulgent towards the faults of Marie, looked handsome in his beautiful
  vestments as he raised the chalice above the heads of the kneeling
  virgins.</p>

  <p>The perfume of the incense, of the flowers, saluted the Redeemer of the
  world; Marie felt a voluptuous sense of her own purity, her own exquisite
  femininity as it was being offered to God; she felt as if she was slipping
  into one of those warm, scented baths she so delighted in; her eyes closed,
  her knees trembled beneath her, she swayed forward. In the flowers, the wax
  lights, the comely priest, the music, the fumes of the smouldering pastilles,
  she felt the presence of God&mdash;a God who was kind, powerful and, above
  all, masculine. Tears filled the black eyes that she kept turned towards the
  glittering chalice, it seemed to her that she was about to die, and that her
  guardian angel, hovering over her, had touched her with the tip of one of his
  cold white wings.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Soon after she was received into the bosom of Holy Church Marie
  experienced another thrill of ecstasy, caused this time by an earthly
  monarch, Charles X, who, on a fine October day, made his state entry into
  Strasbourg. The reception offered to the King was magnificent, the rich
  Alsatian peasants, wearing their gorgeous holiday costumes, riding their
  little mountain horses, formed an escort for the royal carriage, from which
  gazed the worn, gracious countenance of His Most Christian Majesty, still
  handsome despite the debauchery of his gay youth and the austerities of his
  pious old age.</p>

  <p>The women, beautiful in their fine laces and bright smiles, with their
  large blue eyes, blonde tresses and bouquets of autumn flowers followed in
  light chariots; the sound of the cannon firing a royal salute mingled with
  the bells of the churches, the hurrahs of the people.</p>

  <p>Marie was one of the young girls, robed in white and crowned with
  hot-house roses, who at the palace gate presented to the King the keys of the
  city of Strasbourg on a satin cushion. As the elegant Bourbon, who had loved
  so many women, who had once been the incomparable Comte d'Artois, glanced at
  Marie, the girl sank in a half-swooning curtsy, full of enthusiasm, of
  loyalty, of love.</p>

  <p>In the evening there was a magnificent ball, and the aigrettes of the
  fireworks cast up from the Vosges, picked out in light and shade their feudal
  ruins, their dark forests; the Cathedral illuminated its granite lace, and
  everywhere enthusiastic devotion to the House of Bourbon was plainly
  manifest. The festival was enlivened by the presence of that lively
  <i>Parisienne</i>, Madame Garat, whose elegance, fresh gaiety and beauty
  caused much heartache among the young officers of the garrison. M. Cappelle
  greatly admired his fair sister-in-law and offered her continual
  entertainments, pleasure and admirers; Marie shared in all these delights;
  light-footed, graceful, seductive, with brilliant accomplishments, this young
  girl, when she looked in the mirror, was no longer disturbed by her pallor,
  her irregular features or her thinness; she had compensations for these
  defects, large black eyes, masses of ebony locks, abundant vivacity, a voice
  deliciously soft, vibrant and enchanting.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>During the last fine days of autumn Marie and her sister went to stay with
  a friend, Mme. de T&mdash;&mdash;, who had a charming house in the country;
  there the two girls played with the daughters of their hostess beneath the
  yellowing chestnuts and on the borders of a little lake, where a toy pavilion
  offered them shelter and repose.</p>

  <p>Sometimes they drove in a pretty little <i>calèche</i> into Strasbourg,
  where professors, delighted with their charming pupils, gave them lessons in
  painting, music and deportment; almost every evening, M. Cappelle rode out in
  the mellow autumn twilight to visit his daughters; Marie would often spend
  hours waiting on the road that led through Mine de T&mdash;&mdash;'s estate,
  waiting to hear the sound of his horse's hoofs; she experienced a pleasure
  that was so acute as to be almost painful when she saw, appearing round the
  bend of dusty road, flanked by laurels and ilex, the tall horseman in his
  glittering uniform, followed by his servant. When he saw Marie, the brilliant
  officer would dismount and throwing his reins to his orderly walk slowly
  through the dusky park towards the charming house where his wife awaited him;
  Marie hanging on his arm, used a thousand tricks and endearments in order to
  prolong the time, that she might have this adored parent to herself.</p>

  <p>One day, when only the last withered leaves remained on the trees, and the
  grass was brown and dry, Marie waited in vain for her father.</p>

  <p>The servant came riding up alone and, refusing to stop, hastened on to the
  house, crying out that he had a message for Madame Cappelle. Before Marie
  could reach home, a light tilbury passed her; inside was her mother, pale and
  gazing fixedly before her, while she mechanically tied the long satin ribbons
  of her hastily donned hat.</p>

  <p>That night Marie, full of dreadful apprehension, could not sleep; in the
  morning Ursule dressed her and Antonine in town clothes and told them that
  their father was ill and had sent for his daughters.</p>

  <p>In silence the girls mounted the <i>calèche</i> that had been sent to
  fetch them; no sooner had they left the park than Ursule began to cry, and
  told them, between her sobs, that M. Cappelle had been gravely injured by his
  gun's exploding in his hand, when he was out shooting.</p>

  <p>This news threw Marie into such despair, that, on arriving at the
  Strasbourg house, she had to remain an hour in the antechamber of her
  father's room before she could control her sobs, cries and convulsions. These
  lamentations reached the ears of the injured man, and he ordered Marie to be
  admitted to his bedside.</p>

  <p>Silenced, half-paralysed by an excess of grief, the little girl trembled
  into the darkened apartment. M. Cappelle, propped on many pillows, lay on a
  bed from which the curtains were looped up under a crown of feathers; his
  right arm and side were heavily bandaged, his black hair and whiskers showed
  sombrely against his greenish complexion; his wife wept in the bed recess; a
  priest, a doctor, a nurse were in attendance.</p>

  <p>Marie threw herself on her knees by the bed-step and heard a labouring
  voice say:</p>

  <p>"My child, it weakens my courage to doubt yours..."</p>

  <p>Marie stretched out her arms, the dying man's head rested on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I feel a tear on your cheek, papa; it is caused by the agony of farewell!
  My heart is broken!"</p>

  <p>She collapsed on the floor; the doctor and the nurse carried her from the
  room; for several hours she remained unconscious. When her senses returned
  she sprang from her couch and tried to find her father but she was forbidden
  to enter his room. Her cries, screams, convulsions of despair and entreaties
  endured for two days; in the middle of the night a severe-faced man entered
  the chamber where Antonine slept in the lap of Ursule, and Marie, haggard and
  sobbing, prayed before a crucifix that hung above her bed, and led them to
  their mother's apartment. Madame Cappelle, in a rose-coloured
  <i>peignoir</i>, her naked feet thrust into brocade shoes, her scented hair
  fallen about her shoulders, was crying hysterically in the midst of a group
  of friends who tried to console her with ejaculations of pity and
  affection.</p>

  <p>"My poor Marie! All is finished! Your poor papa is dead!"</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-02"
     id="ch-03-02"></a>2. MAIDEN DREAMS</h3>

  <p>The death of her father caused a black gloom to descend over the existence
  of Marie Cappelle. In her own words, "it obscured and veiled my thoughts";
  she saw everywhere the image of death. All the amusements and occupations
  that she had shared with her father became hateful to her; she could not see
  a door open without trembling in the expectation of his appearance. Her tears
  were her sole consolation; when she was alone she repeated the words, the
  advice of her father, and promised herself that although she was a woman she
  would be worthy of this brilliant and gallant soldier; she promised his
  memory that she would be great and noble and struggle against the weak and
  foolish sides of her character.</p>

  <p>When she had somewhat recovered her health and her courage, she took up
  her studies again, but so intense was her grief that she found it impossible
  to concentrate and often reproached herself for being alive when her father
  was dead.</p>

  <p>M. Maurice Collard, Marie's uncle, came to Strasbourg to console his
  sister in her widowhood. He passed the winter in the Alsatian capital, and
  his wedding in the spring with the fair and sentimental Cécile Deprès was
  much discussed and served to distract Marie from her sorrows. This project,
  however, came to nothing save more tears, sighs and reddened eyes.</p>

  <p>It was decided that the widow and the orphan should return to
  Villers-Hellon in the spring; the prospect of this, as well as the passage of
  time, did something to assuage the violent grief of Marie.</p>

  <p>She had another and far more painful distraction. It soon became clear
  that one of the few friends who were allowed to wait upon Madame Cappelle in
  her retirement, a certain M. de Coëhorn, was a suitor for the hand of the
  exquisite widow. Marie's critical eye could not perceive any fault in the
  young Alsatian, whom she found elegant, handsome, amiable and full of a
  chivalrous spirit, so that he seemed "more like a knight of the Middle Ages
  than a gentleman of the nineteenth century."</p>

  <p>This attractive cavalier was a frequent visitor to Madame Cappelle's
  house; he spoilt Antonine, bringing her sweets and toys every time he entered
  the school-room, and showed himself amiable and attentive towards Marie. He
  wasted his pains, however, because when the girl perceived that her mother
  was about to be married for the second time, her grief and vexation were so
  lively as to overwhelm completely her health; Marie, outraged in her
  tenderest sentiments, made a <i>confidente</i> of Madame Deprès, then of
  Ursule, and finally put her troubles before the old Abbé of the regiment, who
  loved her like a daughter. All these people told her that she had not the
  right to judge her mother, that her father himself would have been displeased
  at her attitude and would have told her to cultivate resignation and to
  conceal her tears. The good priest advised Marie to return home, cast herself
  on her mother's neck and demand her entire confidence.</p>

  <p>Before the girl, however, could put into practice this good advice, she
  was shocked by overhearing a conversation between her mother and Madame
  Deprès, who said:</p>

  <p>"Marie is desperate, she does not like Eugène de Coëhorn. Her pride is
  wounded by your proposed marriage. If you want to keep her quiet, you must
  send her away."</p>

  <p>"Such a separation would indeed cause me great grief," replied Madame
  Cappelle sadly, upon which the other lady laughed and remarked:</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, my dear Caroline, believe me, your young husband will not long
  endure these two living souvenirs of the past!"</p>

  <p>Marie retreated from the antechamber where she had overheard these
  stinging words, and, reflecting that they were spoken by her mother and one
  of her father's best friends, she received an unpleasant impression of the
  falsity, egoism and hypocrisy of the world and decided to conceal her
  suffering. Not having the courage to talk to her mother and not being able to
  live under the weight of rage and suffering that oppressed her, the young
  girl seized a pen and with great facility poured out her feelings in a long
  epistle to Madame Cappelle.</p>

  <p>The result of this was a painful interview between mother and daughter.
  The death of her father had taught Marie the meaning of the word "grief"; the
  behaviour of her mother and the words she had overheard Madame Deprès speak
  taught her the meaning of the word "society."</p>

  <p>Madame Cappelle, soft and gracious in her new happiness, was tender with
  her young daughter, whom she did not trouble to understand. She declared that
  M. de Coëhorn could not hope to be Marie's father, but did expect to be
  allowed to be called her best friend; she declared that she would not send
  Marie away to school, but that she would keep her always near her and that
  she hoped to see a pleasant relationship spring up between her daughter and
  her future husband, the gallant, romantic and fascinating Eugène.</p>

  <p>Marie was neither soothed nor consoled by these easy promises; she was,
  indeed, offended by the light coquettish tone adopted by her mother, who had
  lost her beloved husband in so violent a manner only a few months before;
  resentment hardened the child's heart and she proudly resolved to disguise
  her feelings.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the spring the whole party went to Villers-Hellon; Marie left with
  delight those superb scenes where she had once been so happy but which now
  reminded her of her cruel loss. When she went to pray at, and to kiss for the
  last time the stone that closed her father's grave, she had an outburst of
  grief that brought on a slight attack of fever.</p>

  <p>M. Collard received his daughter-in-law and his grandchildren with great
  affection, surrounding them with a thousand attentions, a thousand
  tendernesses; Lalo and Mamie also welcomed the two girls with tears and
  regrets as well as exuberant protestations of affection.</p>

  <p>Marie spent her first days in Picardy in conversing of her father to those
  who had been his servants, in caressing his favourite horses and dogs and in
  traversing alone those walks that she had so often enjoyed in his
  company.</p>

  <p>Madame Cappelle now began to undertake seriously the education of her
  daughters; in this task the charming, worldly woman showed great patience and
  even some severity. When Marie, in an outburst of affection, threw herself
  into her arms and began to cover her with kisses, Madame Cappelle would
  say:</p>

  <p>"Not so much exaggeration, Marie. The best proof of tenderness that you
  can give me will be to correct your faults, which cause me so much
  suffering."</p>

  <p>The emotional child, eager for love, was always chilled and depressed by
  these rebukes, which did not, however, prevent her from indulging in her
  favourite faults of independence, wilfulness and impertinence.</p>

  <p>M. de Coëhorn soon came to stay at Villers-Hellon. He taught Marie German
  and always showed himself indulgent and tender; he often took the girl for
  long rides in the park and along the pleasant roads of Picardy, while he
  explained to her the beauties of poetry and the noble and Utopian ideals of
  the German philosophers. All these attentions, however, did little to
  reconcile Marie to her mother's approaching marriage.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In August a brilliant event disturbed the gracious tranquillity of the
  life at Villers-Hellon; M. Collard received notice of an approaching visit
  from the family of the Duc d'Orléans. The <i>château</i> was decorated in
  order that it might be worthy of this honour.</p>

  <p>On the borders of the estate, by the principal entrance, a large arch of
  greenery was erected; columns of laurel and oak were placed at the top of the
  avenue; the grilles of the lower windows of the <i>château</i> were all
  intertwined with leaves; all the tenants were told to put on their holiday
  clothes and to stand in reverent attitudes along the drive, while it was
  Marie's duty to see that the sheep that grazed in the park were arranged in
  picturesque groups, not altogether an easy task as the stupid animals would
  stray out of the admirable designs into which Marie so carefully formed
  them.</p>

  <p>The interior of the pretty little house was richly adorned with flowers;
  the coat-of-arms of the House of Orleans, the younger branch of the House of
  Bourbon, was formed of cornflowers and daisies from the fields, surmounted
  with garlands of oak-leaves and roses that filled the drawing-room and
  dining-room with perfume.</p>

  <p>The weather, while these preparations were being made, was radiant, and
  nothing could have been more charming and picturesque than the haymakers in
  their Sunday clothes leaning on their rakes, the merino sheep grouped
  coquettishly on the rich slopes of grass beneath the noble trees of the park,
  and the <i>château</i> garlanded with wreaths of oak, laurel and bay.</p>

  <p>Shortly before the Duc d'Orléans and his family were due, however, a
  violent thunderstorm broke; the decorations were ruined, the peasants were
  obliged to take shelter and the sheep scattered under the trees. The Duke and
  Duchess, who were in an open carriage, arrived somewhat blown and damp,
  despite Monseigneur's large umbrella, but the little Princes and Princesses
  travelled in a large omnibus that was nothing less than magnificent. The
  distinguished guests showed the most perfect good-humour, and, after
  luncheon, and protected only by umbrellas and goloshes, insisted, despite the
  rain, on making an inspection of the gardens and farms. They admired
  everything&mdash;the park, the roads, the trees, and had some gracious words
  even for the pretty Swiss dairy.</p>

  <p>M. Collard had always been an enthusiastic supporter of the House of
  Orleans, and had inculcated this loyal devotion so thoroughly in the breasts
  of all his dependants that the old schoolmaster of Villers-Hellon was fanatic
  enough in his desire to see this great Prince to put on a lackey's old
  uniform and join the servants who waited upon Monseigneur at the luncheon
  table. Such was the old man's excitement at this extraordinary honour that in
  hastening to offer the Duke a glass of wine, the eager servitor slipped and
  fell on the polished tiles at His Highness's feet.</p>

  <p>The enthusiasm that had caused this upset being explained to Monseigneur,
  he graciously ordered the loyal pedagogue to be his sole cup-bearer for the
  rest of his visit; this grotesque incident caused Marie the first amusement
  she had felt since the death of her father; the royal visitors praised her
  grace and charm; she felt almost happy.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the autumn, exactly a year after her first husband's death, Madame
  Cappelle was married. As M. de Coëhorn was a Protestant the ceremony took
  place in the drawing-room of Villers-Hellon. This was one consolation to
  Marie in her vexation and distress; she felt that a ceremony in her beloved
  village church would have been a profanation. She was pleased to know that
  the aisles had not been decked with flowers, that the perfumed candles on the
  altar that had not been lit, that the cloths that covered the images of the
  Virgin, the Angel, the Great Cross and the Tabernacle during the week-day had
  not been removed for this marriage that was to her a desecration.</p>

  <p>She wept bitterly at being forced to put aside the mourning dress that she
  had worn for a year; she felt outraged in her love, her religion, her pride,
  and she stood gloomily without even trying to force a smile while the
  black-habited Protestant minister performed the marriage ceremony in front of
  a work-table arranged as an altar. When Madame Cappelle had become Madame de
  Coëhorn, Marie rushed to her room, and throwing herself on her bed, covered
  with tears and kisses the portrait of her dear papa.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Soon after, Monsieur and Madame de Coëhorn and the two children left
  Villers-Hellon to take up residence in the castle of Ittenwillers, where
  Marie, save for a few daily hours devoted to lessons, was allowed to run wild
  in the noble park. In this splendid country residence there were plenty of
  recreations, plenty of liberty, plenty of dogs, cats and birds. Antonine was
  completely happy, and so was Marie save when she chanced to see her mother
  leaning on the arm of M. de Coëhorn, and then she became vicariously jealous
  for her dead father.</p>

  <p>The newly married pair, absorbed in each other, for this had been a true
  love match, lived a very isolated life; there was no brilliant company here,
  none of the frequent gay comings and goings of Villers-Hellon. The only
  visitors were some members of the family of M. de Coëhorn, strangers to
  Marie, who, though amiable and courteous, took very little notice of the
  wilful, sullen child.</p>

  <p>She fell into indolent habits, often spending hours under a tree in the
  park or in a window-seat day-dreaming, a neglected book by her side; under
  the excuse of fatigue, of headaches, of sickness, she avoided as far as
  possible all drudgery, but she was quite willing to recite and to write
  verses, and to execute on the piano brilliant valses, romances and studies,
  though she refused steadily to practise scales and exercises. She began to
  scribble for the hour together; with the pretence of forming her style, she
  was allowed to write letters either to her mother or to some imaginary
  relative; into these epistles she poured all her fancies and feelings,
  skilfully analysing with great detail all her griefs, sensations, dreams,
  hopes and fears.</p>

  <p>Madame de Coëhorn, absorbed in her own happiness, seldom read these long
  sentimental and romantic epistles. Kissing Marie on the forehead she would
  say: "You shouldn't trouble your head with so much nonsense, little one. Be a
  good girl, run away now, and don't concern yourself with philosophy."</p>

  <p>There was a fine library of German, English and French books at
  Ittenwillers. Marie developed a passion for reading; histories, in particular
  the history of Charles XII by Voltaire, the plays of Racine and Corneille and
  Molière, the travels of Cortez and Pizarro, and the innumerable books that
  dealt with the campaigns of her hero, Napoleon I, stimulated and excited her
  until reality became vague and fantasy startlingly vivid.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When Marie was fifteen years old she heard of the Revolution of July.
  Louis-Philippe, the amiable gentleman with the goloshes and the umbrella who
  had admired the merino sheep, the garlands of daisies and the model farm at
  Villers-Hellon, had become King of the French. Marie, though knowing nothing
  of politics, was delighted with this turn of events and so excited herself by
  reading newspapers that her mother had to forbid her to read those copies of
  the French Press that were sent from Paris to Ittenwillers.</p>

  <p>In the autumn it was Villers-Hellon again, and, as Madame de Coëhorn had
  dropped into a state of invalidism, her husband again gave Marie her lessons
  and again was her companion on the long rides through the park and along the
  country roads in which the high-spirited, wilful child so delighted.</p>

  <p>All the rich, aristocratic, brilliant and charming neighbours were in
  residence again, and Marie resumed her delightful life of visits paid and
  received, of balls, concerts, comedies and sparkling intercourse with witty,
  polished and accomplished people.</p>

  <p>In the spring Madame de Coëhorn gave birth to a daughter, whom she placed
  in Marie's arms bidding her "always love and protect her little sister." The
  girl responded with a burst of facile tears, which she declared washed away
  not the memory of her father but the profound grief that his death had
  occasioned her and all the jealousy she had felt towards Eugène.</p>

  <p>Madame Garat came from Paris, bringing with her the aroma of the elegant,
  delicious Parisian life and a crowd of coquettish and charming friends.</p>

  <p>Marie began to pay visits to the neighbouring <i>châteaux</i>; one of the
  first of these was to the <i>donjon</i> of General Daumesnil. There Marie
  found Mlle. Daumesnil, whom she had not seen since both had been boarders at
  Saint-Denis six years before; this other Marie was then an accomplished young
  lady, who thought of nothing but her <i>toilette</i> and who had abandoned
  all serious occupation through the dread of lining her face by study; she had
  even renounced a fine talent for the piano for fear of injuring the delicate
  whiteness of her pretty hands. The friendship that had been so warm and
  promising between the two girls withered. Marie Cappelle viewed with some
  scorn the elegant, languid delicacy of Marie Daumesnil, who returned this
  light irony by an elegant grimace of contempt for her former friend's sallow
  complexion and rustic ways.</p>

  <p>This brilliant life was broken up by an epidemic of cholera that
  devastated France; panic terror invaded Picardy and M. Collard turned his
  <i>château</i> into a hospital, bringing a young doctor from Paris and
  dispensing medicine and nursing free to all his tenants.</p>

  <p>Madame de Coëhorn and her three daughters left for Alsace in the charge of
  her brother-in-law, who was secretary to M. de Sebastiani at the Ministry of
  Foreign Affairs. This young man, M. Edmond de Coëhorn, was an excellent
  amateur musician, and during her second residence at Ittenwillers Marie's
  great diversion was to hear him playing romances, valses and idylls upon the
  piano, to which he sometimes sang in Italian in a fine tenor voice.</p>

  <p>Deprived of her husband, Madame de Coëhorn no longer lived in blissful
  isolation, but gathered round her a charming, animated, aristocratic company;
  still, however, none of these people took much notice of Marie, who was no
  longer a wilful little child to be petted, spoiled, caressed and reproved,
  but a tall, awkward girl. Her mother, who did not admire her appearance in
  the least, continually told her that she was ugly and insignificant, and it
  was true that she provoked so little homage from the young men who came to
  the <i>château</i> that when M. Edmond one day kissed her hand she was so
  much astonished and so proud that she thanked him gratefully.</p>

  <p>Thus isolated from the radiant society that surrounded her by her awkward
  age and her lack of obvious charms, Marie plunged again into reading. She
  followed the taste of the day and was soon deep in the romances of Sir Walter
  Scott, then the rage in the polite society of Europe. Marie was speedily
  entranced by these delicious novels, which transported her into a world
  exactly to her taste. In the company of Fergus, <i>The Master of Ravenswood,
  Rob Roy, Flora, Black Ivor</i> and <i>Diana Vernon</i>, Marie Cappelle no
  longer felt isolated or slighted; in particular the last-named heroine struck
  her odd imagination. Diana Vernon, the noble and frank young girl, became the
  companion of her dreams and the sister of her thoughts; she identified
  herself with this splendid, romantic creature and every night when she laid
  her head on her pillow she evoked the image of Di Vernon, who began to have
  on her life more influence than any living creature. Side by side with the
  phantom of Diana Vernon, Marie Cappelle would ride a white horse across the
  Scotch heather; she imagined that the beautiful heroine was her confidante,
  that they were exchanging joys, hates and sorrows.</p>

  <p>Absorbed into this world of romance, Marie cared less and less what was
  happening about her; her sense of reality began to be blunted; the figures of
  her young companions were not as vivid to her as the creations of Sir Walter
  Scott. Like a bird joyously taking wing in its native air after being for
  long in a gilded, comfortable cage, the soul of Marie Cappelle flew into the
  world of romanticism that surrounded her. Everything fostered her daydreams,
  the music, the Italian songs of M. Edmond de Coëhorn, the languishing,
  amorous grace of the young marriageable girls who visited her mother, the
  superb scenery with the Gothic ruins and broken abbeys, the rocky passes, the
  feudal castles, the wild landscapes of Alsace.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She was often a member of parties organised by one of the rich landowners
  of the district, which ascended the mountains on stout ponies until a superb
  view was reached, and there, on the mossy carpet at the foot of a ruined
  tower, they made a delicious picnic meal; while champagne was being drunk and
  <i>pâtés</i> were being eaten, the wind produced charming melodies from the
  Eolian harp set in the trees or a group of peasants played one of their
  entrancing <i>Ländler</i> tunes, to which the aristocratic merrymakers danced
  with ardour and enthusiasm. These Alsatian dances were valses and galops; the
  rhythm of them intoxicated Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>In the daytime her cavaliers were two boys of her own age, witty, gay,
  charming; but at the balls, which took place almost every evening, she liked
  to dance with her step-father's brother, M. Edmond de Coëhorn, an excellent
  waltzer who, whirling Marie round the gaily-decorated <i>salon</i>, made her
  feel as light as a feather.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>These gaieties were increased by the arrival of Marie's second aunt,
  Madame de Martens, who had been for a long while in Constantinople, Where her
  husband was Ambassador of the King of Prussia to the Sublime Porte.</p>

  <p>This lady, elegant, charming, <i>spirituelle</i> and fascinating like the
  other daughters of M. Collard, brought with her her two pretty, accomplished
  daughters, and a joyous family reunion took place at Ittenwillers.</p>

  <p>Marie was now seventeen years old and was considered to have taken her
  place in the world; she attended all the balls and her name was always on the
  cards of invitation that found their way to Ittenwillers; she visited all the
  aristocratic <i>salons</i> of Strasbourg and all the charming country houses
  that surrounded the city. Much as she enjoyed all these entertainments and
  amusements, the ardent, dreamy girl was not altogether without a sense of
  disillusionment and bitterness; she found this social life, so longed-after
  in her schooldays, by now a little wearisome, a little fatiguing. The truth
  was that she provoked no especial admiration; the death of her father had
  considerably altered her social position for the worse; she was not a beauty,
  her dowry was known to be small, and there were many beautiful and wealthy
  girls in Strasbourg; finding herself, therefore, the object of only
  superficial compliments and mechanical attentions, irritated by all the
  formalities that surrounded her position as an unmarried girl, Marie began to
  take a dislike to balls and parties and to retire more and more into the
  world of romance that she had created for herself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the spring came another domestic grief; Jeanne, Madame de Coëhorn's
  little daughter, fell into a decline; after six months she died, to the
  despair of the parents who buried her under a white rose-tree in the park; in
  the dead baby's hands rested a lock of Marie's hair with which she had played
  during her long illness.</p>

  <p>Stupefied with grief and in a languishing state of health, Madame de
  Coëhorn allowed her two sisters, Madame Garat and Madame de Martens, to
  conduct her and her two daughters to Villers-Hellon, where M. Collard
  received with a passionate affection all the surviving members of his family,
  for Madame de Martens brought with her her two daughters, Hermine and
  Bertha.</p>

  <p>With the spring Marie accompanied her mother and aunt to Paris, where she
  hoped to meet with the most exciting and romantic adventures. Her first
  experiences were, however, disappointing. Invited to a ball at the Tuileries,
  where she knew few people and where lack of partners forced her to sit on a
  bench by the wall nearly all the evening, she was driven by wounded vanity
  into developing a superb contempt for society; she resolved to withdraw from
  the world and to give herself up to day-dreams and good works; she would
  have, she resolved, no other friend than Diana Vernon and no other amusement
  than the reading of the romances of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

  <p>This mood was quickly changed by an invitation from the Maréchale Suchet,
  a former friend of her father's, to another ball. The <i>maréchale</i> took
  great pains to see that the young girl enjoyed herself; several attractive
  young men asked her to dance, several distinguished women took the trouble to
  be civil to her; she felt that she was admired; in her silver muslin robe
  with a crown of white roses she felt "as light, as diaphanous as those
  delicious insects, dragon-flies and butterflies which dance in springtime on
  the crystal waves of little streams." When, flushed and animated by this
  success, she returned home, she felt she renounced with less emphasis the
  works of Satan, "the pomp and vanities of this wicked world."</p>

  <p>Her aunt took her to the opera to hear Nourrit in <i>Robert le Diable</i>.
  The martial, amorous music of Meyerbeer sent Marie again through those
  entrancing realms into which she had first been led by the genius of Walter
  Scott; she began to dream of knights in chain armour, of black-eyed
  <i>houris</i> reclining under the shade of orange groves, a whole world of
  pagan ease, luxury and voluptuous love; with eager expectation she awaited a
  lover.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>In the spring Madame de Coëhorn gave birth to another daughter, who was
  named Elizabeth. The mother had long been languishing and was unable to
  recover from her confinement. To add to the suffering of the sensitive woman
  there was a slight estrangement from her husband, who, once so passionately
  in love with her, seemed to be wearying of a wife several years older than
  himself who was always in ill-health.</p>

  <p>Marie accompanied the poor woman to her <i>château</i> in Alsace and
  employed her time in nursing the pretty, rosy infant Elizabeth and in playing
  and singing to her mother; the girl had become a really good musician and
  knew how to sing and to play with taste and distinction; into the valses and
  nocturnes of Liszt and Chopin, the minuets and serenades of Mozart, she put
  all her passionate, emotional and tender feelings; but she was still too
  self-conscious to be able to sing the love poems that would have best
  expressed the emotions of her heart.</p>

  <p>M. de Coëhorn joined his wife in Alsace, but their estrangement continued;
  Marie was no longer forced to regard reluctantly a passionate love idyll; the
  handsome young man no longer led his wife out on moonlit nights on to the
  terrace to press her hand while they gazed at the moon, no longer did they
  wander by the borders of the ornamental lake, or sit and sigh beneath the
  weeping willow tree; he occupied himself with his business, the management of
  her estate, and she was taken up with her suffering of mind and body.</p>

  <p>Soon after the New Year she died, a frightful scene of unrestrained
  emotion taking place round her death-bed. Marie, pale and thin from a recent
  long and lamentable attack of indigestion, bathed her mother's hands with
  tears, tormenting the expiring woman with agonised kisses. Antonine and the
  servants stood at the head of the bed, weeping noisily. M. de Coëhorn beat
  his breast in an agony of remorse, imploring his wife to speak to him and to
  forgive him for his late neglect, now so unaccountable even to himself.</p>

  <p>Marie's distress became so violent that the doctor was forced to draw her
  away from the bedside; Eugène at once took her place, and falling on his
  knees, rested his head on the pillow beside his wife's. Several hours passed
  thus, then, towards the dawn, the haggard Eugène raised his head with a cry
  of despair:</p>

  <p>"She has left us!"</p>

  <p>After a day passed in a state of semi-consciousness, Marie resolved to see
  her mother once more and stole into the death chamber where Madame de
  Coëhorn, with a lace cap tied under her chin and surrounded with hot-house
  flowers, lay on smooth coverlets under an embroidered tapestry.</p>

  <p>Marie fell on her knees beside the corpse as if she were worshipping a
  saint:</p>

  <p>"Mother, forgive me. I did not adore you sufficiently when you were alive.
  Look now from heaven into my heart&mdash;see how I suffer. Pardon me, my poor
  mother, and become my guardian angel."</p>

  <p>Having relieved herself of this prayer, Marie longed to cut a curl off the
  head of the corpse as a souvenir. When she got to her feet, however, she
  found herself unable to touch her mother, who seemed to her "as sacred as the
  wafers in the Eucharist." She wished to press a last kiss upon the dead
  forehead and at length found the courage to do so; the touch of the icy brow
  brought on a new fit of despair and she fell unconscious on the floor beside
  the bed.</p>

  <p>When the girl recovered her senses it was only to witness the frightful
  despair of M. de Coëhorn, who wept, who cried, who struck his head against
  the wall, who knelt down and kissed the chair where his wife had sat, who
  handled and caressed her books, her piano, the rug she had had over her
  knees, who embraced his daughter until she wailed with pain, and pressed his
  two stepchildren in his arms, exclaiming in accents of agony:</p>

  <p>"My poor children, I must lose you too!"</p>

  <p>When a little calm was restored to this house of mourning, M. de Coëhorn,
  with many tearful apologies, informed Marie that it was her mother's last
  wish to be buried under the rose-tree where little Jeanne slept and where she
  had tasted her great happiness in her second marriage.</p>

  <p>Marie was agonised at this request; she wished her mother to rest under
  the gravestone that covered her father, and said so in a voice broken by
  passionate sobs; M. de Coëhorn, however, pressed her to give her consent; it
  was necessary to get a special authorisation from the Bishop for this burial
  and Marie had to sign it as well as himself.</p>

  <p>"It will be a new bond between us, Marie. You will come and stay with me
  in order to weep on your mother's tomb."</p>

  <p>Marie then reminded the frantic widower that he might follow his wife's
  example and take in time a second mate. He repelled this idea with horror,
  and Marie, overwhelmed by his insistence, gave the desired consent; Madame de
  Coëhorn was buried under the white rose-tree in the romantic park of
  Ittenwillers, where two small crosses marked the lonely graves of the
  charming woman and her infant daughter Elizabeth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When the first violent convulsions of grief were over, Marie surveyed her
  position and found it desolate. Although her parents had brought her up in
  reckless luxury, they had left her but a small fortune; for the completion of
  her education, for her introduction into the world, for her settlement in
  life she must look to her two aunts and their husbands, since M. Collard was
  a feeble old man.</p>

  <p>Marie dreamed of spending the rest of her life at Villers-Hellon, the
  support and consolation of this beloved grandfather, the object of the
  compassion and adoration of all the servants, tenants and neighbours, who
  would no doubt overwhelm with tenderness the delicate orphan-girl sustaining
  herself so bravely in her profound grief.</p>

  <p>Guardian angels, indeed, soon hovered close to the poor orphan; prominent
  among these was Madame de Valence, her mother's godmother; in this lady's
  sumptuous <i>château</i>, surrounded by tendernesses, Marie passed the first
  few months after her mother's death, while little Antonine, whose education
  had been somewhat neglected, was sent to a <i>pension</i> in Paris.</p>

  <p>Marie learnt, with a mixture of surprise and gratification, that Madame
  Adelaide, a sister of the King, had undertaken to pay for the education of
  this dear little sister. The connection, then, between her family and that of
  His Majesty, the King of the French, was not a mere fable? When Marie
  ventured to broach the subject, her aunt playfully tapped her cheek, bid her
  be a good girl, discreet and obedient, and warned her once more that this
  connection with the royal family was a profound secret.</p>

  <p>In the summer following the death of her mother Marie went again to
  Villers-Hellon, where her grandfather did all in his power to console her
  still devastating grief. Here, also, was her aunt Madame Garat, who began to
  assume airs of authority towards her niece. The delicious baroness, in every
  respect a perfect Parisian, had been married at sixteen years of age and had
  one daughter, who had inherited none of her mother's brilliant charms, but
  was a sickly and morose little creature, continually being dosed with black
  pills to improve her health, and long sermons to improve her character. For
  the bringing up of this unsatisfactory child Madame Garat had adopted a
  system of absolute maternal domination; this she began to apply to Marie,
  whom she regarded as being strictly in her charge. The girl, vain, proud and
  wilful, at once resented it, and withdrew herself into a mute rebellion
  whenever she was rebuked for her continual faults of deportment, speech or
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>She was now at an age when she required a <i>confidente</i>. She did not
  find one among the three cousins who were with her ar Villers-Hellon. Mlle.
  Garat, full of duplicity, self-will and caprice, did not please Marie;
  Hermine de Martens was cold, and Bertha only a child, while in her own sister
  Antonine, Marie observed a meek, placid, dull creature who was not in the
  least suited to be a recipient of the wild, fantastic dreams that disturbed
  Marie's heart and head; Antonine, besides, was at home only for the
  holidays.</p>

  <p>Thrust back upon herself by this lack of friends of her own age and by the
  severity of her elders, Marie devoted her time to improving her
  accomplishments in the hope of making up in brilliancy what she lacked in
  beauty, and to easing her mind by pouring out on paper her ardent, romantic
  thoughts. She continued to dream of a possible lover; she believed that when
  she met this ideal being, her real existence would begin; whenever she jotted
  down what she considered noble thoughts or sweet lines of poetry, whenever
  she conquered a difficulty in her musical exercises, whenever she performed
  what she thought was a good action, she offered all these successes to the
  imaginary cavalier who she hoped would one day become her husband. These
  dreams, in themselves almost sacred, she breathed to none. Indeed, the few
  words that Madame Garat had spoken to her on the subject of her possible
  marriage were far from encouraging; the elegant, worldly lady had said with a
  dry smile that Marie must not fill her head too much with romantic dreams, as
  the reality of marriage was very different from what it appeared in the
  fancies of ardent young girls.</p>

  <p>"There is something more in marriage, my dear Marie, than a fine position
  in the world, pleasures, a handsome trousseau, a round of delicious
  entertainments."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie's pleasantest hours were spent with her grandfather, who pampered
  and spoiled the delicate, sensitive girl. He had given her in Villers-Hellon
  a room next to his own; the first hours of the morning and the last hours of
  the evening she spent in the old man's chamber, either playing an idyll, a
  romance or a valse on the charming piano that he kept in his apartment, or
  reading to him or allowing him to tell her for the hundredth time one of his
  favourite stories.</p>

  <p>During this period Marie received her first offer of marriage from a
  certain M. de L&mdash;&mdash;, she had seen this man only occasionally and he
  had never expressed any admiration for her. It would not, indeed, have been
  possible for him to do so as Marie was always strictly chaperoned. This
  gentleman was young, but of commonplace appearance and possessed a fortune of
  only five thousand francs; his offer, therefore, was refused, but it had
  caused in the ardent heart of Marie a profound excitement. She felt her
  importance considerably increased, her dreams of the future became more rosy
  than before.</p>

  <p>In the winter Marie left Villers-Hellon and stayed with Madame de Valence,
  daughter of Madame de Genlis-Sillery, in her charming apartment in the <i>rue
  de Barri</i>; she had her own bedroom and boudoir, and an excellent servant,
  a sister of old Mamie, to wait upon her. Madame de Valence belonged to a
  circle of wealthy, well-placed people, most of whom had made fortunes under
  the Empire, either through military service or through supplies to the
  armies; her daughter, Madame la maréchale Gérard, was an influential leader
  of society. Marie moved with daily increasing assurance and grace through the
  handsome <i>salons</i> where this society, always wealthy, and sometimes
  brilliant, amused itself. She met sportsmen, diplomats, <i>lions</i>,
  dandies, those who were termed "men of honour" and those who were termed "men
  of wit," and she began to notice the other side of her world, which hitherto
  had been for her a succession of luxuries, caresses, indulgences&mdash;a
  round of pleasures broken only by lessons that taught her the most desirable
  and delicate accomplishments.</p>

  <p>Marie, quick, shrewd, and with a sense of irony running through all her
  romanticism, began to understand something of the society in which her life
  was to be passed. She gauged the brittleness of conventions, yet she saw the
  horrible penalties inflicted on those who broke them; she saw that money was
  the basis on which this charming, frivolous and indolent existence was built;
  she saw thai while the men had the greatest possible licence, the rules for
  the women were very strict; but she soon realised that feminine duplicity, of
  which she herself had a considerable share, was usually more than equal to
  circumventing the rules that must not be broken.</p>

  <p>Life in these Parisian <i>salons</i> was much the same as life had been in
  the convent school of Saint-Denis; if an outward appearance of decorum was
  maintained, if all the little laws governing speech, conduct, etiquette, were
  kept, if one had a gift for intrigue, for chicanery, for manoeuvring in
  secret, well, then, the most dainty, fastidious lady of them all might have
  almost as much freedom as the wildest <i>lion</i> or dandy.</p>

  <p>Marie acquired naturally, by instinct, that elaborate technique which
  women, oppressed, almost enslaved by the men, regarded as mere ornaments in
  the <i>salons</i>, or as upper servants in the housekeeper's room, had
  acquired from one generation to another.</p>

  <p>The girl soon learnt also to cultivate that inner life of fancy and
  imagination into which she had already entered through the enchanted pages of
  Sir Walter Scott. Like so many of these women of wealth and leisure, living
  in a society unstable and corrupt, Marie Cappelle protected herself from
  boredom by making a fine art of day-dreams. She was carefully watched and
  guarded against any contact with what her guardians would have termed
  "reality." She had been delighted to wander round the lanes of Picardy
  distributing loaves, suits and blankets to the poor people on her
  grandfather's estate, but she knew nothing, and wished to know nothing of the
  slums of Paris&mdash;of that underworld where crime was bred from the dregs
  of revolution and war, where poverty and disease had formulated their own
  code, their own religion, their own ceremonies and moralities.</p>

  <p>Marie knew nothing of the infamous poverty, the sordid vice, the
  despairing corruption of the great city; she seldom went abroad on foot, but
  when she did she was always accompanied by her aunt or her old servant. Her
  knowledge of Paris was confined to the fashionable quarters, the modish
  shops, the opera, the smartest theatres, a few elegant cafés and
  restaurants.</p>

  <p>Nor was she interested in anything that was not elegant, choice and
  lovely; she had an exquisite taste and a keen perception of what was orderly
  and seemly. The coquettish <i>salons</i> through which she moved, with their
  furniture of gilt and satin, their pictures of beautifully-dressed women on
  the silken walls, their curtains of finest lace, their vases of agate and
  marble, were fitting backgrounds to the handsomely-dressed men and women who
  danced, sang, played cards, conversed and idled with such charming indolence
  and such polished elegance.</p>

  <p>Marie liked to drive abroad in a smart <i>briska, calèche</i> or tilbury
  with liveried servants on the box; she liked to walk in the Tuileries gardens
  under the opulent red-and-white chestnut trees, between the parterres of
  costly flowers; she enjoyed the opera, the drama, a concert of music, a
  fashionable ball; she liked to buy and to wear the finest, most exquisite of
  garments, in perfect taste, that fondled her slim body as a breeze fondles
  the superb calyx of the opening lily; she knew, partly by instinct and partly
  by training, the right thing to wear, the right thing to do; she never made a
  social mistake. Passionately desirous of being admired, of being, if
  possible, even loved, she was very careful never to give offence and very
  careful to adapt herself to any company in which she might be placed. She did
  not disdain flattery, either given or taken, and so, though she was neither
  beautiful enough nor rich enough to be really popular, her presence was
  always acceptable among the set in which Madame de Valence and Madame Garat
  moved.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The greatest influence in Marie's life was not, however, any of these
  people whom she saw daily under such pleasant circumstances, but the novels
  of Madame George Sand. Paris was in full romanticism, and there were few
  girls or women who had escaped the spells of <i>Indiana</i> or the other
  romances that appeared under the name of George Sand.</p>

  <p>Among the idle, the indolent, the voluptuous classes, this passion for
  romanticism rose to a delirium. Disdaining both their own age and the classic
  period, which had lately been so much in vogue, the romantics turned back to
  the Middle Ages that, ignorant of history, they regarded as a vague period
  adorned by knights, ladies, pages, troubadours, white palfreys, love-sick
  musicians, feudal castles and beautiful maidens in distress. Everything
  Gothic was fashionable.</p>

  <p>At the costume balls to which Marie frequently went, the favourite
  characters assumed were Mary, Queen of Scots, Isabelle of Burgundy,
  Marguerite de Valois; the houses, the furniture, the ornaments were made in
  what was supposed to be Gothic style. The romances of Walter Scott, Charles
  Maturin and Mrs. Radcliffe had already filled the minds of their eager
  readers with images of ruins, gloomy landscapes, witches, spectres,
  skeletons, beautiful girls in peril, handsome young men rescuing them&mdash;a
  whole phantasmagoria of impossible, adorable excitement.</p>

  <p>The romances of the daring lady who wrote under the pseudonym of George
  Sand were, to such a type of woman as was Marie Cappelle, an even headier
  draught than that supplied by Sir Walter Scott, the German romanticists, the
  poems of Lamartine or Byron; here was not only a new world, but a new
  doctrine; the delicious theory, which soon insinuated itself into the hearts
  of every discontented woman, was that a great love between the sexes was its
  own justification, that what had formerly been called "virtue" was
  <i>bourgeoise</i> and contemptible, and that nothing mattered in life but a
  great passion greatly pursued. According to Madame Dudevant, all duties, to
  both God and man, should be thrown aside if they conflicted with a sincere, a
  passionate love; even crimes&mdash;adultery, murder&mdash;might be excused if
  lovers found it necessary to commit them.</p>

  <p>These theories, developed in a brilliant style, and adorned with the most
  seductive of images, the luxury of rich interiors, of gorgeous clothes, of
  beautiful music and paintings, of Italian scenery, intoxicated all the young
  and half of the middle-aged women of France.</p>

  <p>Marie would sigh and muse by the hour together over these entrancing
  pages; she at once identified herself with Madame Sand's heroines, as she had
  before identified herself with Diana Vernon. Her imagination was ardent and
  well-nourished by wide miscellaneous reading; she had only to close her eyes
  to believe herself on a marble terrace shaded by orange trees, wearing a robe
  of violet velvet with a chaplet of lilies on her head, while a handsome
  cavalier kneeling on a satin cushion poured out his love at her feet&mdash;or
  to imagine herself mounted on a white horse, with silver veils and orange
  plumes floating from her streaming black locks, galloping over a vast plain
  towards a Gothic castle outlined against a stormy sky; by her side, of
  course, would be riding the inevitable lover, bold, handsome, young, brave,
  with something dark and Satanic in his air&mdash;a Manfred, a Harold, a bold,
  half-infernal creature whose pale lips would be twisted in disdain of the
  entire world; yet this paragon would be ready to melt into passionate prayers
  of gratitude if she but conceded to him a touch of her white fingers.</p>

  <p>Absorbed in these day-dreams to the point of physical collapse, to the
  point of ecstasy, Marie began to make herself into the kind of woman she
  desired to be. Out of the creature who was Marie Cappelle, who had already
  been formed by a spoilt childhood, an intermittent education, a succession of
  emotional crises, this skilful girl, still under twenty years of age, tried
  to form a heroine of exotic romance. The Parisian perfumers soon furnished
  her with lotions to blanch her sallow skin, to whiten her long hands and to
  make her thick, black hair glossy. She strove to increase this interesting
  pallor by drinking in secret quantities of vinegar and by sucking lead
  pencils. She was also, like other romantics, extremely careful about her
  diet; it was gross and vulgar to concern oneself with food, and Marie, in
  common with the other elegant young Parisians, was never seen to eat more
  than an egg, a little tart, a morsel of fruit or a muffin; she drank
  quantities of weak China tea and denied herself all <i>bonbons</i> and
  sweetmeats, of which she was inordinately fond; not only did this light diet
  make the romantic woman appear interesting, as if she was too ethereal to eat
  substantial food or too absorbed in some secret grief to heed it, but it was
  absolutely necessary if a sylph-like figure and a pale face were to be
  maintained.</p>

  <p>Marie, however, could not always control the agonies of hunger, and her
  old servant would often bring in secretly to her chamber a tray laden with
  substantial food. This weakness once produced unfortunate consequences. Among
  the gentlemen who visited the house of Madame de Valence was one who had been
  greatly impressed by Marie's elegant disdain for food when she sat, pale and
  languishing, at her hostess's dinner table. So openly expressed was his
  interest in Marie that her friend began to hope that he would make an offer
  for her hand. These expectations were blighted by the following incident.</p>

  <p>Marie, having played with a fragment of chicken and a few grapes at
  <i>déjeuner</i>, was sustaining herself with peas, cutlets, rolls and
  pastries in the <i>salon</i> when this potential suitor was unexpectedly
  shown into her presence. Revolted by what he termed "disgusting hypocrisy,"
  the gentleman ceased to visit the apartment of Madame de Valence. He was
  wrong, however, in imputing hypocrisy to Marie Cappelle; she was no more a
  hypocrite than the actress who throws herself into the part she is playing
  and then relaxes behind the scenes. While Marie was in company&mdash;on the
  stage, as it were&mdash;she was quite unconscious of being other than
  herself; she was for those moments the sentimental, passionate,
  misunderstood, <i>spirituelle</i> romantic, disdainful of everything that was
  gross, common or mundane.</p>

  <p>Her health, never good, did not long resist this poor diet, the
  vinegar-drinking, the hours in powerfully-scented hot baths, the lack of
  exercise and the close air of <i>salons</i>, over-perfumed with the scent of
  tuberoses, jasmine, lilies and aromatic pastilles. Marie had several returns
  of her ancient complaint, an inflamed stomach, which developed into a more or
  less chronic gastritis; she also became anaemic, subject to giddiness,
  vomiting and fainting fits. Inconvenient as these complaints were, she
  rejoiced in them, as they gave her an air of delicacy, and even hinted at the
  suspicion of that disease then so extremely fashionable&mdash;consumption.
  Illness, too, gave her a natural pallor far beyond that to be obtained by the
  lavish use of any bleaching lotion; it put bistre circles round her eyes, far
  more effective than any paint could have been, and gave to all her movements
  a ravishing languor; besides, the weakness of her body encouraged the
  activity of her mind. A few days of semi-starvation, a few glasses of
  champagne, a hot perfumed bath, and Marie, touched by fever, would lie in bed
  tossing in voluptuous dreams as vivid and poignant as an actual
  experience.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There were few outward events during this period in the life of the girl
  whose inner adventures were so enthralling. Her beloved uncle Maurice married
  a gracious and charming young girl, Mlle. Blanche de Montaigu, the daughter
  of a noble house whose aristocratic relatives&mdash;dukes, counts and
  marquesses&mdash;openly despised the moneyed family into which the fair
  Blanche had married, while M. Collard showed a bitter jealousy towards his
  son's bride.</p>

  <p>This sumptuous marriage, celebrated amid every circumstance of luxury,
  cast Marie into a restless melancholy. Her longdreamed-of lover was slow in
  making his appearance; there had been no offer of marriage from any of the
  gallants who frequented the <i>salons</i> of Madame Garat or Madame de
  Valence. Marie never lacked partners in the ball-room, or amiable companions
  to escort her and her <i>gouvernante</i> to the theatre or the opera, but no
  one had ever whispered words of love into her ear, pressed her hand tenderly,
  slipped a note into her glove, played a guitar under her window, or, in
  brief, performed any of the thousand and one delicate acts of devotion for
  which she sighed so ardently. So eager was she for amorous experiences, so
  starved for love, that had any of the gentlemen of her acquaintance, even the
  plainest in feature and the most mediocre in character, the most miserable in
  fortune, besieged her with even the most timid of love-making, this
  accomplished, brilliant, elegant young creature would have flung herself
  gratefully into his arms. She had, too, her practical moments, and in these
  she could not but perceive that she was in a false position. Her dowry was
  small, the income from her capital was only sufficient to supply her with
  lavish pocket-money, and for the rest she was dependent upon the goodness of
  Madame Garat, who did not fail to hint that the sooner the poor, orphaned
  Marie found a good husband with a substantial fortune, the better it would be
  for the entire family.</p>

  <p>Marie thought that she loved her aunt, but she certainly did not like
  being under her authority. Madame Garat, though a worldling herself, thought
  that Marie had been spoiled, and did not show herself very indulgent towards
  her whims, caprices, tempers, melancholies and reveries. Marie, irked by what
  she considered a domestic tyranny, longed not only for the delirious joys of
  a romantic love affair, but for the liberty accorded to a married woman; she
  was tired of being perpetually under some one's orders, of always being
  accompanied&mdash;spied on, it seemed to her&mdash;wherever she went, of
  never having a moment to herself, of having to go to Mass every day, of
  having to account for every second of her time, show her letters, her
  diaries, what she was reading, to her aunt, who as often as not disapproved
  and said so coldly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie's day-dreams often took the form of seeing herself as the gracious
  and amiable mistress of a charming Gothic castle, with devoted servants and
  reverent tenants, an adoring husband, a delicious family of rosy infants, who
  would not, as her health would always be delicate, be allowed to annoy her,
  but would be kept in perfect contentment by a devoted old nurse of the type
  of Lalo. Marie saw herself galloping over her husband's estates on a splendid
  white horse, her hair, plumes and veils floating in the breeze. She would
  visit the cottages on the estate and dispense charity with sweet words that
  would be valued more than her gifts; she would give balls in her charming
  <i>salon</i>, being kind and gracious towards all; she would have many
  admirers among the cavaliers in the neighbourhood; perhaps with one of them
  she would achieve a romantic love affair, an episode of broken sighs, of
  interrupted glances, of exchanged verses, of moody and passionate
  piano-playing, of a first and last interview beneath noble trees, one kiss,
  abnegation, resignation, farewell.</p>

  <p>Tormented by these dreams, which began to grow stale and torture her with
  their repetition, Marie pined among the splendours of Parisian society. Her
  health really suffered; she was fatigued by sharp, internal pains produced by
  her recurrent attacks of gastritis and weakened by the severe dieting that
  gave her a figure light as a feather in the breeze. Had she not been sternly
  faithful to her ideal of a romantic heroine, she would have become peevish
  and irritable as well as indolent and melancholy, but she always remembered
  that a sad sweetness and a gentle resignation were attributes of her ideal of
  womanhood&mdash;so, save very occasionally when she was provoked by scme
  sharp rebuke from her aunt, she preserved outwardly at least an even temper
  and always spoke in a carefully modulated, harmonious voice. But with every
  week that passed her sense of disillusionment and disappointment increased;
  all her friends were getting married; she knew that behind her back she was
  being spoken of as an "old maid." Twenty, twenty-one&mdash;her aunt had
  married at sixteen, her mother at seventeen, her grandmother at fifteen.
  Eligible husbands came and went in the noble <i>faubourg</i>; not one of them
  chose Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>She was thus forced back upon her dreams, which became to her not only a
  consolation but a drug, and a drug that had to be taken in increasing doses.
  The music of Liszt, of Mozart, of Chopin arousing sensuous, voluptuous,
  romantic images, the theatre where noble lovers sang and clung together
  against a background of bloody and heroic events, above all the romances of
  George Sand with their moral anarchy, their brilliant attraction, their power
  of taking the reader into a world that had never existed and never would
  exist, became absolutely necessary to Marie Cappelle. She became so entangled
  in this web of fantasy, of romanticism, of impossible events,
  highly-coloured, flamboyant, passionate and exciting, that she began to look
  upon the world of reality with the dazed eyes of the opium addict who lives
  only for his dreams. She began to avoid company and to withdraw into a
  languorous solitude. Her great delight: was to get the <i>salon</i> to
  herself when her aunt and uncle and their daughter were abroad; she would put
  out all the lights save the two candles on the piano, array herself in a gown
  of pearl-coloured satin, thrust some flowers through her flowing black hair,
  powder her face until it appeared of a startling pallor, pose gracefully at
  the piano, and in the half-lights, play a nocturne by Chopin or a romance by
  Liszt&mdash;until she could almost persuade herself that her lover was
  waiting for her beneath a myrtle-wreathed balcony on a black gondola floating
  between the sombre palaces of Venice or in the hanging gardens of Smyrna,
  where the plash of silver fountains mingled with the notes of the
  nightingale.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-03"
     id="ch-03-03"></a>2. ROMANTIC ENCOUNTER IN AN OMNIBUS</h3>

  <p>After she had moved from the apartment of Madame de Valence to that of
  Madame Garat, her aunt, over the Bank of France, Marie Cappelle received
  great stimulus and consolation from a friendship that sprang up between her
  and her cousin, a former intimate of childhood. Marie de Nicolai was an
  accomplished, finished <i>Parisienne</i>, marriageable, and, no doubt, soon
  to be married. Her family was not only one of the most honourable in France,
  but extremely wealthy, and Marie possessed that elegance, exquisite taste,
  delicate figure and those well-groomed features that in a fashionable girl
  pass for beauty. She was as incorrigibly romantic as Marie Cappelle, and the
  two girls soon became confidential friends.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle, by far the more accomplished and intelligent of the two,
  did not disdain to coax and flatter a girl who was in everything save birth
  and wealth her inferior, but in whom she believed she had found the perfect
  friend. It was with immense relief that Marie Cappelle poured forth all her
  romantic dreams, speculations, anticipations into the patient and willing
  ears of Marie de Nicolai, who herself dwelt in the self-same world of
  fantasy.</p>

  <p>Her circumstances were peculiar; she was staying in Paris with her wealthy
  and indulgent sister, Madame de Montbreton, when Marie Cappelle first renewed
  acquaintance with her, and afterwards she resided close to the Bank of France
  with her mother and father, the Comte and Comtesse de Nicolai. The life led
  by this wealthy, spoilt young girl was considered extremely daring for a
  young, unmarried woman; both in her sister's house and in her mother's she
  had her own suite of rooms, and though a maid or governess&mdash;both
  entirely at her service&mdash;was supposed to accompany her wherever she
  went, she was allowed a degree of liberty that alarmed the rigorous society
  of the <i>faubourg</i>. Her manners, too, were considered bold and dashing
  for a <i>jeune fille à marier</i>, and many prudent mammas refused to allow
  their daughters to become the intimate friends of the dashing Marie de
  Nicolai.</p>

  <p>Madame Garat herself demurred when she observed that Marie Cappelle was
  seeing this dangerous friend not only every few days but every few hours,
  sharing her rides in the <i>Bois</i>, her parties and her music lessons, her
  shopping excursions. The characters, however, of both Madame de Montbreton
  and Madame de Nicolai were unexceptional and the impetuous and frivolous
  Marie de Nicolai was certainly wealthy and well-born, so Madame Garat's
  objections were, rather reluctantly, withdrawn, and the feverish intimacy of
  this schoolgirl friendship continued.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle admired and envied this young girl, so much less gifted,
  less intelligent than herself, for the Comtesse Marie had complete power over
  her parents and her married sister and lived very much the life that Marie
  Cappelle would like to have lived; Marie de Nicolai had the least possible
  supervision, was allowed to receive her own friends in her little
  <i>salon</i>, to go to entertainments and theatres with no companion save her
  young and frivolous maid or complaisant governess whom she ruled
  absolutely.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Nicolai, coquettish, avid for pleasure, to the last degree
  worldly and frivolous, was, like Marie Cappelle, always dreaming of some
  exquisite love affair that should be adorned with every detail of romantic
  beauty and sensual delight.</p>

  <p>The two girls exchanged their ardent confidences, and Marie Cappelle soon
  began to share Marie de Nicolai's life of independence, and, in consequence,
  luxury, that was so much blamed by the prudent mammas of the noble
  <i>faubourg</i>.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Mlle. Delvaux, Mlle. de Nicolai's governess, was a middle-aged gentlewoman
  of good birth and small means, who, having secured a good position in this
  wealthy household, employed all her wiles to keep it; she realised that her
  function of guardian was merely nominal, and that Marie de Nicolai, adored by
  her parents and her grandmother, was to be allowed to do very much what she
  liked. She, therefore, turned a blind eye to a thousand imprudencies and
  indiscretions, troubled Madame de Nicolai with no complaints of her
  daughter's behaviour and accepted with gratitude all the handsome little
  gifts that her grateful charge showered upon her.</p>

  <p>This Mlle. Delvaux did not look upon Marie Cappelle very favourably; she
  was jealous of the influence that this intelligent girl might obtain over the
  other Marie, who had been for so long not only her peculiar charge but her
  peculiar perquisite. The young heiress's lavish and thoughtless presents were
  now divided between Mlle. Delvaux and Mlle. Cappelle; besides, this wayward
  and impetuous friendship gave the governess extra trouble; she now found
  herself in charge of two daring, rebellious and disobedient girls instead of
  one. She thought that Marie Cappelle encouraged her charge's frivolity and
  daring, and a dislike that soon grew into a feud arose between the indolent
  and unscrupulous governess and the indolent and unscrupulous young girl; they
  engaged in a tenacious, silent struggle for the possession of the confidence
  of the spoilt heiress.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>One day the two Marks were alone in Mlle. de Nicolai's splendid little
  <i>salon</i>; both the young girls were in a state of considerable
  excitement, as they always were when they met to exchange confidences. Marie
  de Nicolai lay in bed drinking a cup of chocolate; above her head a swirl of
  rainbow-coloured silk curtains fell from delicate gilt coronet; her room was
  very luxuriously furnished and not approved of by the prudent mammas of the
  <i>faubourg</i>, who found it altogether too coquette and extravagant for a
  young unmarried woman. Indeed, Marie de Nicolai had lately given rather too
  much cause for comment among her neighbours and friends, and her parents and
  sister, indolent as they were and afraid as always to offend her, had
  somewhat circumscribed her liberty. She had lately, with pouts and petulant
  cries, confided to Marie Cappelle that she was no longer allowed to stay so
  late at balls, to ride alone with parties of young acquaintances in the
  <i>Bois</i> and that her correspondence was now all censored, that is, every
  letter she received was to pass through the hands of Mlle. Delvaux or those
  of her mother.</p>

  <p>As soon as Marie Cappelle entered this perfumed, elegant chamber, she
  rushed to the bedside and the two friends covered each other with kisses.
  There was always a feverish sense of tension in their friendship that was
  expressed in brittle, tinkling phrases. They talked about little else besides
  what they termed "love" and "amusements," though Marie Cappelle would
  occasionally repeat to Marie de Nicolai plots and scenes from the innumerable
  romances she read. Mlle. de Nicolai, being a not inconsiderable heiress, went
  into society a great deal more than her <i>confidente</i>, whom she was fond
  of regaling with stories of her success at balls and the admiration she
  received when promenading in the <i>Champs-Elysées</i>; she fascinated and
  tormented the other girl with her accounts of her almost incredible list of
  admirers. When they were abroad together, in every <i>phaéton</i> that passed
  or on every horse that galloped by would be some young man who had offered
  for Marie de Nicolai's hand or some lady whose jealousy had been aroused by
  the heiress's brilliant charms. Not only did Mlle. de Nicolai boast that
  almost every <i>beau parti</i> or handsome cavalier in Paris had offered for
  her hand, but she confided to her friend that often, when dancing the
  <i>quadrille</i> or the <i>polka</i>, her married partner pressed her hand
  and vowed eternal love; she declared that there were several gentlemen whom
  she dare not recognise when abroad for fear of the jealousy of their
  wives.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle had been able to counter these stories with tales of the
  romantic young Alsatians and Germans who had been her companions on moonlit
  drives, rides and picnics in the Vosges, who had shared her rustic repasts
  beneath the ruins of a feudal tower or wandered with her over some deserted
  Gothic castle, while they had breathed ardent devotion to her melancholy
  charms. Marie Cappelle had also a more specific romance to relate; a certain
  dark-browed count who was a neighbour of her grandfather's often rode over
  and offered her delicate homage, sometimes falling on his knees and covering
  her hands with kisses; he, too, had been allowed to be her companion on long
  rides across the beautiful meadows of Picardy&mdash;he had called her his
  Diana Vernon, declared she was even more dashing, beautiful, noble and
  desirable than the Scotch heroine. This gentleman was a speculator in
  railroads and had asked Marie Cappelle, when he opened a new line&mdash;as he
  hoped to do soon&mdash;if she would ride on the first wagon, as the Goddess
  of Speed. He was not, unfortunately, free; not only were his affairs in a bad
  way, but he had some mysterious, illicit ties which prevented him from
  offering his hand in marriage, even to the heroine of his dreams. He hoped,
  however, to be clear soon of both these embarrassments, and he hardly saw
  Marie without pressing her hand and whispering: "In a year, my love, in a
  year." He had been godfather and she godmother to the child of a neighbour,
  and Marie had proudly shown to Mlle. de Nicolai the magnificent
  <i>corbeille</i> that this desirable Count de C&mdash;&mdash; had given her
  on this occasion, in which everything&mdash;gloves, handkerchiefs, laces,
  <i>toilette</i> articles, flowers&mdash;had been of the purest white.</p>

  <p>Imagination more than heart entered into these recitals and feeling not at
  all; the girls romanced wildly, hardly even trying to check their fervent
  imaginations, yet they would have been exceedingly surprised if anyone had
  termed them liars.</p>

  <p>They were self-deceived and were not able to disentangle their own
  fictions from those they continually read. The sober truth was&mdash;and
  sometimes Marie Cappelle, by far the shrewder of the two, faced it&mdash;that
  neither had received yet a love-letter, a declaration of love, or even a
  suitable offer of marriage. Marie Cappelle's guardians and Mlle. de Nicolai's
  parents had certainly discussed possible husbands for the two girls, but no
  romance had entered into any of these possible business arrangements.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle seated herself by the bedside after looking with a sigh of
  envy round the elegant little room, so much more sumptuous than that she
  could herself afford, and prepared to listen to Mlle. de Nicolai's accounts
  of her triumphs of the night before when she had been present at the ball
  given by the British Ambassador, and where, of course, burning words of
  passion had been whispered to her during the cotillion or the valse.
  Sometimes Mlle. de Nicolai paused from boasting of her love affairs to boast
  of her high rank among the aristocratic circles of Paris, even affecting to
  disdain the homely Court of Louis-Philippe and declaring that she would never
  attend any of the entertainments in the Tuileries, as she had no wish to
  display her graces to a company of grocers, chemists and little
  <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, one of her usual tales of social triumph that Marie
  de Nicolai now had to relate. Seated in her bed with her rose-coloured
  swansdown wrap floating about her rather thin shoulders and her large dark
  eyes gleaming with excitement, Mlle. de Nicolai, affecting great caution,
  lowered her voice and began the following story, not, however, before
  extorting from her eager <i>confidente</i> the usual schoolgirl vows of
  complete discretion, obedience and secrecy.</p>

  <p>"One day, the beginning of last winter, I went out&mdash;you know I used
  to be allowed to go like that, though I am not now&mdash;with just my maid to
  make some purchases in the <i>rue Saint-Honoré</i>. Well, I was in the
  perfumer's with Louise when a most frightful storm of rain came on. I had
  promised to be home in time to change for dinner as Mamma was taking me out
  that evening, and though we had an umbrella, we thought we would run for it.
  We had no sooner got to the corner of the street, however, than the rain
  became so violent that I felt I should be drowned; there was an omnibus
  passing just there, and I knew it went by the <i>rue d'Angoulême</i>, so,
  what do you think I did? I jumped in. The conductor rang the bell and the
  omnibus started leaving poor Louise standing on the pavement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marie, how could you?" interrupted Marie Cappelle. "You got into an
  omnibus&mdash;and alone!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all by myself. Now here comes my great secret. I was all wet and
  panting and hardly able to get into the horrid thing when a most elegant hand
  in a fine yellow glove, in the most correct manner, was stretched out towards
  me. It was a young man, Marie&mdash;everything about him was absolutely
  correct, I assure you. He had the manners of a nobleman, an air altogether
  <i>grand seigneur</i>. Of course, as you know, it is quite a long way from
  the perfumer's shop to our street, almost the whole length of the <i>rue
  Saint-Honoré</i>&mdash;and so we sat opposite each other, and I had an
  opportunity of observing him closely. Oh, my dear, such large black eyes,
  such classic outlines, such an air! When he paid for his ticket the conductor
  gave him some ugly, common <i>sous</i> with the silver, and he leant and
  threw these out of the door to some poor people on the pavement. Of course, I
  saw that he was simply devouring me with his eyes and wondering who I
  was&mdash;so I pulled out my handkerchief, you know I had one of those little
  lilac ones, and there was my Comtesse's coronet in the corner with my name,
  embroidered in gold thread. I held it on my knee so that he could not fail to
  see it. I was afraid he would think it very strange that I was riding alone
  in an omnibus. I was very careful, of course, to keep myself away from anyone
  else in the horrid vehicle. When at last it stopped at the <i>rue
  d'Angoulême</i>, the stranger jumped out too, when he saw I was going to
  alight, and helped me off the step in the most respectful and gallant way.
  Then he saluted me, just as if I had been a Queen, and stood with his hat in
  his hand gazing after me. Yes, he stood there, Marie, in the middle of the
  rain with his feet in the mud&mdash;and he had such fine varnished boots
  on&mdash;and watched me until the door of my <i>hôtel</i> dosed behind
  me."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him again?" breathed Marie Cappelle, clasping her hands.</p>

  <p>"Yes, at church&mdash;Saint-Philippe. You know I go there every Sunday
  with Mlle. Delvaux. You know the church is small, and soon after the meeting
  in the omnibus there was a charity sermon to be preached by the Abbé du
  Guerry. We were rather late, couldn't find seats, and then suddenly there
  <i>he</i> was offering us two chairs that he had kept behind a pillar. Oh,
  Marie, it was he! I accepted, I thanked him, and he spent the whole of that
  service leaning against one of the neighbouring pillars gazing at me. Well,
  after that, my darling little one, we often met&mdash;in the
  <i>Champs-Elysées</i>, in the Tuileries, at Saint-Philippe. We never spoke,
  but of course our glances told everything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marie, you are in love with him&mdash;with this stranger?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is a stranger&mdash;a foreigner, I think, but, oh, so
  distinguished, so <i>comme il faut</i>&mdash;I think he is a prince at least.
  I have seen him in the <i>Bois</i> riding a magnificent horse, and he is
  always so perfectly dressed."</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Nicolai then proceeded to relate how she had been conducting a
  mute love affair with the handsome stranger. He contrived to follow her in
  nearly all her promenades and nearly all her visits to the church, and she
  contrived exaggerated scenes of effusion and coquetry with all her male
  friends so that he might witness how popular, what a reigning beauty she was.
  She managed, too, to say in a loud voice to her governess all that she wished
  him to overhear, so that he must by now have a fairly good idea of her
  circumstances and history. She also thoroughly enjoyed the shades of
  melancholy, gloom, spite, jealousy and rancour that she saw successively pass
  over his handsome, expressive face. Sometimes she rewarded his constancy by
  dropping a flower from her bouquet and with a smile giving him permission to
  put it in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle listened with intense interest, some incredulity and a good
  deal of envy to this romance; she had often read of such things, but had
  almost given up hope of hearing of them in real life; she plied Marie de
  Nicolai with questions that she was not able to answer; she did not know who
  the unknown admirer was nor could she think of any means of discovering. All
  she knew was that he had the manners, the elegance, the distinction of <i>la
  haute noblesse</i>. Nor would Marie de Nicolai commit herself as to whether
  or no she intended to offer her hand, for which so many wealthy admirers,
  according to her tale, were contending, to this romantic lover. She was
  highly pleased with the effect she had produced on her friend and with the
  state of excitement and enthusiasm into which Marie Cappelle had been thrown,
  and it was decided between the two girls that they should pay a visit to the
  Louvre on the next day when the stranger was certain to be there in the long
  galleries of paintings.</p>

  <p>"He knows that I always go there on a Thursday morning, and during the
  entire season he has not failed to appear."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Permission for this visit to the museum having been duly received from
  Madame de Valence, with whom Marie Cappelle was then staying, and Madame de
  Nicolai, the two cousins and the governess entered the long gallery hung with
  sombre masterpieces down which the Emperor Napoleon had led the Empress
  Louise on their wedding-day.</p>

  <p>As it was early in the morning, there were few people about, save a few
  poor students from the <i>rive gauche</i>, who were copying some of the rich
  canvases of Rubens or Tintoretto; the two dark girls, slender and extremely
  elegant in their flowing robes, flowing skirts, tight waists and bonnets
  lightly veiled with gauze, affected to take a passionate interest in the
  boring paintings, while Mlle. Delvaux recited a dull little homily on the
  ennobling influence of art.</p>

  <p>"There he is," whispered Mlle. de Nicolai at last, feverishly pressing her
  companion's hand.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle looked round. Truly, imagination could not invent a more
  accomplished hero! There the young man was, tall, with an athletic, flexible
  figure, an expressive and melancholy countenance, with a singular air of
  distinction and originality, that Satanic air of despair which romantics had
  made so fashionable, clothes that the fastidious young woman at once noticed
  were in every detail correct, large ardent black eyes and a mass of black
  curly hair that showed beneath the tall hat he doffed on seeing the
  ladies.</p>

  <p>Dutifully playing her part of loyal <i>confidente</i>, Marie Cappelle
  devoted herself to the governess, whom she flattered by earnestly consulting
  her on the merits and faults of the paintings.</p>

  <p>This Mlle. Delvaux was by no means to Marie Cappelle's taste; she was
  unexceptionable in taste and deportment, but there was something dry,
  arrogant and suspicious about her that the girl did not like; Marie knew her
  to be venal, hypocritical and servile, and scorned her while she flattered
  her.</p>

  <p>Forced now into intimate conversation with the governess, Marie Cappelle
  discovered her to be extremely boring. Nothing could have been more banal
  than her remarks or more tedious than her manner. The girl, however, was
  rewarded by seeing, whenever she glanced over her shoulder, that the lovers,
  though not venturing to speak, were enjoying a delicious exchange of glances,
  sighs and gestures.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>From this moment Marie Cappelle became the <i>confidente</i> in this
  romantic intrigue; more resolute and less frivolous than her friend, Marie
  Cappelle at once set about finding out who the romantic stranger was. It did
  not take her long to come upon this information; casually pointing him out to
  her uncle, M. Garat, on one occasion when they were at church, she discovered
  that the young man was named Felix Clavé, that he was Spanish and that his
  father was the head of a humble <i>Institution</i> that took as pupils the
  sons of superior tradespeople. This house, which was quite close to the
  church of Saint-Philippe, was a modest white building on which, in large
  yellow letters, was written "<i>Institution Clavé</i>." It was, then, quite
  easy to understand how the young man was able to watch Mlle. de Nicolai's
  comings and goings and to be always present when she attended church.</p>

  <p>Not without a good deal of secret and malicious satisfaction did Marie
  Cappelle explode her friend's romantic dreams of the stranger's being a
  Marquis, a Duke or a Prince, and though she pretended that love was
  everything and that Mlle. de Nicolai ought to be completely satisfied with
  becoming Madame Clavé, she knew perfectly well that her friend would never do
  this, that she was, between her pride and vanity and the romance that had
  become so dear to her, in a miserable dilemma.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Nicolai made no pretence of courage, but gratified Marie Cappelle
  by showing the utmost grief and confusion. She declared that she loved this
  Felix Clavé, that she had hoped that he would one day be her husband, but now
  the whole thing was impossible. He had no family, no position, no money, and,
  according to M. Garat's information, gained a miserable existence by helping
  his father with his lessons and by contributing a few paragraphs to the more
  wretched of the Paris journals.</p>

  <p>"What! I?&mdash;and to marry a man who earns his living by his pen!"
  exclaimed Mlle. de Nicolai in a passion of tears.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle rejoiced at seeing her friend thus humbled, and took the
  occasion to lecture her on snobbery, prejudice and worldliness, declaring
  that M. Clavé's nobility was to be seen in his forehead, his glance, his
  carriage, and that if Marie de Nicolai had any spirit at all, she would run
  away with this romantic lover, gladly forfeiting her place in society and
  willingly affronting the wrath of her parents and relatives.</p>

  <p>Wearied by these exhortations, Mlle. de Nicolai retorted sharply, and the
  girls parted coldly after an exchange of spiteful remarks.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The affair, however, was far from finished. A few days later Marie
  Cappelle was again summoned to Mlle. de Nicolai's bedchamber, where she found
  her friend restless, feverish with a sick headache.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Nicolai, it seemed, had wounded her mute admirer by fiery looks
  of disdain, and for several days she had not seen him either in the church or
  in the museum or on her promenades. She found that she could not endure life
  without his presence, so she had taken the extreme step of writing to him,
  begging him to appear at two o'clock in the usual place in the
  <i>Champs-Elysées</i>. The cavalier had not only kept this appointment, but
  had replied with a passionate love-letter in which he declared that Mlle. de
  Nicolai was the only gleam of light in his poor life, that he adored her on
  his knees as "the consolation of the afflicted," "the mystic Rose of the
  Earth," and so on and so on.</p>

  <p>This letter was not signed, and Mlle. de Nicolai had shown it to her
  mother, declaring that it came from an old servant whom she had been helping
  through a severe illness. M. de Nicolai, proud of his daughter's generosity,
  read the letter aloud to the company that was gathered in the <i>salon</i>
  when Marie received it, and thoroughly enjoyed the praises lavished upon his
  charitable daughter.</p>

  <p>"Now," declared Mlle. de Nicolai, "I must see <i>him</i> once more for a
  first and last interview and a final explanation."</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle was perfectly willing to enter into this intrigue, which
  promised to give her something of interest in her life and also to increase
  her own importance. If one could not be the heroine of such a romantic love
  affair, it was better than nothing to be the <i>confidente</i>. She undertook
  to receive the correspondence, as, when she was staying with Madame de
  Valence, her letters were not inspected. This was to continue until Mlle. de
  Nicolai departed in the summer for her father's country house, where it would
  be very easy for her to receive the correspondence without suspicion.</p>

  <p>M. Clavé willingly entered into this amorous correspondence. The girls
  read his letters together and expressed themselves as moved and excited by
  these sweet expressions of love, these gracious words&mdash;"echoes of a
  noble heart," as Marie Cappelle thought them.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Mlle. de Nicolai was not able to go to her friend's house to
  receive these <i>billets-doux</i>. On these occasions she would send a little
  note bidding Marie Cappelle answer them for her. In return for this service,
  Marie Cappelle received from the enamoured Spaniard grateful epistles in
  which he declared that he would make the second Marie his <i>confidente</i>,
  that he dare put before her all the bitternesses of his soul, that he would
  confide to her sympathetic heart all his hopes and fears.</p>

  <p>In these letters the young man related the story of his life. He had been
  born on the Spanish frontier, he had grown up in the mountains, having "the
  great lakes for mirrors, the little birds for confidants and the beautiful
  stars for friends." Despite appearances, he was, he declared, of noble birth,
  his real name and title of nobility being Villa Nova. Through "the
  vicissitudes of war his father was obliged to leave his sword behind in Spain
  and to come to Paris to educate the children of others, that he might have
  money to educate his own"; not wishing "to disgrace the blazonry of his
  ancestors" by his present position, he had taken the name of Clavé. M. Felix
  declared that his heart was one "that had sufficient grandeur to despise
  fortune," but he nevertheless suffered from his humiliating position and
  "sought a refuge in religion and poetry." He sent his thoughts on the former
  subject and his essays on the latter in bulky packets, over which the two
  girls sighed and languished together. The Comtesse Marie already possessed
  "volumes of sonnets, album-leaves, and romances in her honour and pyramids of
  dried flowers, souvenirs of regrets."</p>

  <p>Sometimes delicious doubts and shudderings would disturb the two young
  ladies as they perused these ardent epistles. Both had been taught at school
  that men were "serpents, demons, spirits of the abyss who fascinated only to
  deceive," and they had no experience of men at all save in the characters of
  fathers or elderly relatives; they had been taught that they must never look
  a gentleman straight in the face, but with down-dropped lids merely reply:
  "Yes, sir&mdash;No, sir;" a syllable too much might compromise them, two
  syllables too much might dishonour them.</p>

  <p>They did not know and did not attempt to discover what they meant by the
  word "love," which they tossed to and fro between them like a gilded ball,
  light as a feather, as glittering as a diamond. They did not know how to
  analyse or even how to understand dimly the feelings of mingled repulsion,
  fascination, fear and delight that consumed them during the progress of this
  delicious yet forbidden affair.</p>

  <p>This business with M. Clavé reached its climax in a great public charity
  ball which was given at Tivoli "for the benefit of the poor pensioners on the
  Civil List."</p>

  <p>M. Clavé had written that he would be there, and the two girls induced
  Mme. de Nicolai to take them. It was a splendid <i>fête</i>; young and pretty
  women laughing and talking wandered over the exquisite lawns; everyone was
  dressed as a different flower, the old and ugly dowagers as poppies, peonies,
  tiger-lilies; the young girls as heliotropes, rose pompons, cornflowers,
  sensitive plants. Marie de Nicolai appeared as a poppy in the middle of a
  garland of daisies represented by her friends in white frocks, others were
  dressed as forget-me-nots, violets, pansies; Marie Cappelle, in gauze of
  different shades of mauve and heliotrope, represented a spray of Persian
  lilac.</p>

  <p>The ball, being public, was very crowded, there was hardly room for the
  <i>contredanse</i> in the tent set aside for the ball, and Mme. de Nicolai
  was an indolent guardian, so it was possible as the evening advanced for M.
  Clavé to approach the two girls and to ask them severally to waltz with him.
  Marie Cappelle almost fainted with emotion when she found herself resting
  lightly in the arms of the elegant stranger and circling with him to the
  intoxicating strains of a valse by Johann Strauss.</p>

  <p>"My good angel," he whispered gently in her ear, "speak to me of
  <i>her</i> that I may hear her name breathed in your soft voice! Oh, what
  have I done to merit that she should deign to lower her eyes to me and that
  you should become my friend?"</p>

  <p>He went on to ask the enchanted Marie Cappelle always to remain his
  friend, near his adored one, then confided to the palpitating girl his
  ambition one day to espouse the noble Comtesse de Nicolai. Since there were
  so few opportunities, he declared, in Paris for him of distinguishing
  himself, he intended to offer his sword to Queen Christina of Spain and to
  fight for her "till death or fortune crowned his efforts."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The following day the two girls met again&mdash;it was Mlle. de Nicolai's
  last day in Paris. They talked of nothing but the ball of the night before,
  and of this so incessantly one against the other that they were both almost
  in a delirium.</p>

  <p>The Comtesse Marie was not at all pleased with her lover's romantic
  project of carving the way to fortune for himself with his sword.</p>

  <p>"What! he is to be gone three years, and I am to remain pining like the
  pale betrothed in the German ballad? No, let him retake the name of Villa
  Nova and enter diplomacy. Then he can come forward openly and demand my hand
  of my father."</p>

  <p>The hour of departure came; there were tears, embraces, vows. Marie de
  Nicolai found that after all it would be very risky for her to attempt to
  receive the letters from M. Clavé in her father's country house. Marie
  Cappelle was therefore to remain, as before, the <i>confidente</i>; M.
  Clavé's letters were to be sent to her and she was to enclose them in one of
  hers when she wrote to Mlle. de Nicolai; as the latter feared that she would
  not be able to hide her correspondence from the espionage of Mlle. Delvaux,
  the letters of M. Clavé were to be all returned to Marie Cappelle, who was to
  keep them jealously.</p>

  <p>After the departure of Mlle. de Nicolai for the country, Marie Cappelle
  found her main excitement in this secret correspondence; the letters were all
  immensely long and very numerous; there were M. Clavé's letters to his
  beloved to be forwarded, there were his own letters of warm friendship to
  herself, and there were Marie's letters pouring out her soul to her
  sympathetic friend.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>This exciting state of affairs was broken by the alarming news of M.
  Collard's serious illness; Marie Cappelle went as fast as the horses would
  take her to Villers-Hellon and found her grandfather already out of danger;
  however, she stayed with him, indulging in transports of affection towards
  all her old friends for several days; as the old gentleman recovered health,
  he confided to his granddaughter that his affairs were in a very bad way.
  They had been for many years, through carelessness on his part, neglected. He
  suggested to Marie that she should become his little <i>châtelaine</i>, live
  at Villers-Hellon, regulate his estate, dispense his housekeeping account,
  look after his tenantry and try to get the place into good running order. He
  told Marie that he hoped to leave her a good dowry, that he longed to see her
  settle down with a good husband and a fine boy at Villers-Hellon. These were
  also Marie's hopes, but there seemed no chance of their fruition; despite all
  the efforts of her aunt Madame Garat, her aunt Madame de Martens, and their
  respective husbands, no suitable match had yet been found for the elegant and
  fastidious, sentimental and passionate Marie.</p>

  <p>This episode had broken the correspondence with the Comtesse Marie and M.
  Clavé; several weeks elapsed before Marie heard from her friend; when a
  letter did arrive it was one that caused her much vexation. Mlle. de Nicolai
  confessed that Mlle. Delvaux had, by dint of strict espionage, discovered the
  romantic intrigue with M. Clavé and that she had threatened to divulge the
  whole story to Mme. de Nicolai unless all the letters were retrieved from
  Marie Cappelle, who was henceforth to be deprived of the role of
  <i>confidente</i>, the governess taking her place. Mlle. de Nicolai wrote
  that the governess's terms must obviously be acceded to&mdash;she had the
  peace of mind, nay, the whole future, of her pupil in her power.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle now understood why M. Clavé had ceased the
  correspondence&mdash;no doubt he also had been told the terms on which Mlle.
  Delvaux's silence was to be purchased; Marie Cappelle wrote back harshly that
  she was hurt and humiliated by this turn of affairs. She would not trust the
  letters to the post, but, when she was in Paris, Mlle. de Nicolai might fetch
  them.</p>

  <p>Soon after Marie returned to Mme. Garat's handsome apartment over the Bank
  of France, Mlle. de Nicolai called on her. Something had obviously happened
  to the old friendship; the girls were strange and even offended in manner,
  though they strove to be as affectionate as before. Marie Cappelle reproached
  her friend for withdrawing her confidence from her, asked her wherein she had
  failed her, and added some injurious expression about the hateful governess,
  Mlle. Delvaux.</p>

  <p>Mlle. de Nicolai, uneasy and shamefaced, defended herself as best she
  could. With much embarrassment she declared that she had not seen the amorous
  young Spaniard since the ball at Tivoli, that she did not intend to see him
  again, or even to correspond with him, and that she wished to destroy all his
  letters, which Mlle. Delvaux had assured her would be most compromising for
  her future reputation. She broke off in great agitation to demand of her
  friend if she were sure she had all the letters; she said she had a list of
  them with numbers attached, and that she hoped not even one was missing.</p>

  <p>Taking offence at this, Marie Cappelle replied disdainfully that she had
  indeed all the letters, but that she would keep those that M. Clavé had
  addressed to her; the conversation had reached this point when Mme. Garat
  entered the room and Marie de Nicolai was forced to leave the house without
  receiving her letters.</p>

  <p>The following day was the first of the school holidays, and Antonine,
  covered with medals and praises, was to be taken to Villers-Hellon for a
  six-weeks' <i>vacance</i>. It was then a matter of urgency to obtain the
  letters before the departure of Marie Cappelle for the country. Mlle. Delvaux
  herself called to receive them, and a painful interview took place between
  the two women, whose dislike of each other was no longer disguised. The
  governess took upon herself to lecture Marie Cappelle, telling her that her
  conduct had been unpardonable, putting all the blame of the intrigue on her,
  declaring that she, with her romantic and fantastic notions, had traded on
  the frankness and simplicity of Marie de Nicolai in order to lead her astray,
  that she was a most dangerous friend for her pupil, and that it was only on
  the condition that this friendship was entirely broken off that she had, out
  of regard for the future and the honour of the two young girls, consented not
  to speak to Mme. de Nicolai about the disgraceful intrigue with M. Clavé.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle listened to this harangue with inner fury, but replied with
  hypocritical meekness:</p>

  <p>"Not having the happiness, Mademoiselle, of possessing a wise and prudent
  guide like yourself, being a poor orphan, I have decided to confide to my
  aunt, Mme. Garat, the whole affair. She will find a way to protect what you
  are kind enough to declare in danger&mdash;my future and my honour. As for
  the letters, I do not for the moment know where to find them. I have put them
  safely away, but where I cannot think. When I discover them I shall confide
  them to my aunt."</p>

  <p>The governess had to confess herself beaten; astounded at this bold move,
  she humiliated herself to plead with the girl not to tell Mme. Garat of the
  affair and to give her the letters. Marie Cappelle, however, decided to
  indulge her spite to the full. She left for Villers-Hellon without returning
  the correspondence, and only after several desperate letters from Marie de
  Nicolai and one of humble apology from Mlle. Delvaux did she condescend to do
  so.</p>

  <p>However, this affair that had begun so brilliantly and ended so miserably
  was not over; Mme. Garat's maid had listened at the door during the interview
  between Mlle. Delvaux and Marie Cappelle and had taken a garbled version of
  what she partly overheard to her mistress. The result was a tempestuous scene
  between Marie and her aunt, in which the young girl was accused of an illicit
  love-affair. Refusing to betray her friend, she was punished by being shut up
  in her chamber for several days. During this time she received two "terrible
  letters," as she termed them, from her aunts. These ladies, writing
  passionately and unguardedly, accused Marie Cappelle of the most intolerable
  conduct, and declared that her behaviour was such that it would be almost
  impossible for them "to settle her in life." They added other causes of
  complaint to that of the supposed secret and undignified love-affair; Marie
  was disobedient, was frivolous, was imprudent, was idle, and, most unpleasant
  of all, she was, her angry relatives declared, very careless in
  distinguishing between what was hers and what belonged to other people. A set
  of turquoise buttons from Mme. Garat's <i>toilette</i> had been missing, some
  gold pieces had been taken from a drawer and leather discs substituted. There
  was the same complaint to make about other trifles&mdash;a packet of lace, a
  purse of money; of course, it was to be understood that if Marie had taken
  these things, she did not know she had done so; she had been as a child so
  spoilt that she regarded everything in the house where she lived as hers to
  do as she would with; she must understand that these manners would not pass
  in society. She was allowed the full revenue from her capital to spend as
  pocket-money, and that should be sufficient. Marie cast up her eyes and hands
  to heaven in horror at these petty accusations that were not proceeded
  with.</p>

  <p>She burst out of her room and, confronting her aunt Garat with a violence
  that alarmed that lady, denied having ever seen any of the objects that she
  was accused of having, in absent-mindedness, no doubt, appropriated; if the
  buttons, the lace and so on had been found in her chamber, it must have been
  due to the carelessness of a valet or some chambermaid, perhaps the very one
  who had spied upon her and so falsely reported her words. The passionate girl
  thus overwhelmed her two aunts, and they agreed to take her into favour again
  upon her swearing that the conversation had not referred to herself, but to a
  friend whose name she could not divulge.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The autumn holidays passed very pleasantly after all these emotional
  storms at Villers-Hellon. Another husband was proposed for Marie, a certain
  M. de V&mdash;&mdash;. He proved, however, upon enquiries, to be a mere
  fortune-hunter, forty years of age, violent and despotic in temper, with very
  little means and entirely absorbed in a passion for a married woman. He was
  therefore rejected, not without some regret. An establishment for Marie
  seemed farther off than ever, and long attacks of brooding melancholy
  alternated with her feverish high spirits.</p>

  <p>When she returned to Paris for the winter, there was another round of
  balls, pleasures and <i>fêtes</i>. She moved once again in the most elegant
  society of the <i>Chaussée d'Antin</i>; it was once again the old round of
  pleasures, Marie was acceptable everywhere without finding a definite admirer
  anywhere; she began to avoid the balls where she passed, good dancer as she
  was, too much of her time seated on the red velvet benches next the wall, the
  entertainments where the younger girls received all the homage of the
  gentlemen, and the rides in the <i>Bois</i>, where the more beautiful amazons
  had all the gallant escorts.</p>

  <p>She heard nothing from Marie de Nicolai and saw nothing of M. Clavé, and
  often, in rereading the letters that the young Spaniard had addressed to
  herself, sighed over that romance in which she had vicariously enjoyed the
  ardours of first love. She began to return to her old solitary habits, spent
  many hours sitting at the piano playing romances or idylls, many more
  brooding over novels or scribbling down <i>pensées</i> or poetry, and began
  to take as her intimate playmate little Gabrielle, her aunt's youngest
  daughter, who had been born since Marie had come to live in Paris.</p>

  <p>Little Gabrielle, a charming blonde child less than three years old, was
  in the charge of a nurse and an English <i>gouvernante</i> who had to serve
  also as chaperon for Marie when her aunts were not able to keep her company,
  and the four often spent the afternoon walking down the long <i>allées</i> of
  the Tuileries gardens. The little child was very fond of Marie, who warmly
  returned this charming affection; she liked to push the little creature in
  her toy-cart or to guide her toddling steps, and when she saw glances of
  admiration cast on her lovely charge, she felt that she "was really a woman
  and really worthy of respect."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was during one of these promenades that an adventure occurred that
  seemed to be an exact replica of the one of which Marie de Nicolai had been
  the heroine. A young and handsome man followed, with respect and admiration
  in his glance, the governess, the nurse, the young lady and the child; his
  attire, his air, his manners, proclaimed him, in Marie Cappelle's judgment,
  infallibly a nobleman. His appearance was in every detail fashionable; he was
  tall, dark, pale, with a high forehead, black hair, deep-set black eyes, that
  gloomy look of being misunderstood by a despised world that was so
  fashionable, and, most entrancing of all, a little dry cough surely denoted a
  weak chest or the first stages of consumption. Added to these advantages, he
  had yellow gloves of the most correct shade, varnished boots of impeccable
  brilliancy, and an air so altogether distinguished that the old English
  governess&mdash;who could not fail to mark his constant attendance on their
  promenades&mdash;declared that in her own country it was quite usual for love
  affairs to begin this way, that many a young English miss had found in such a
  romantic encounter a happy marriage.</p>

  <p>At this time there appeared a romance entitled <i>Anatole</i>, by the Abbé
  Sicart, in which the hero, who resembled in every way the mysterious stranger
  of the Tuileries, was deaf and dumb. Marie began to imagine that the elegant
  gentleman who followed them in their promenades also suffered from this
  affliction, and she at once thought of herself devoting her life, as the
  heroine of the novel did to her beloved, to alleviating his sufferings and to
  learning the language of the deaf and dumb which the Abbé Sicart had just
  invented. As if following out the romance of Mlle. de Nicolai in every
  detail, the handsome unknown followed Marie Cappelle to Mass at the chapel of
  Saint-Calvaire at Saint-Roth. There he would stand at the door and offer a
  stoop of holy water, first to the old governess, then to the charming
  Marie.</p>

  <p>On one of these occasions he proved that he was neither deaf nor dumb by
  exchanging a few graceful words with the ladies; he also discovered that
  Marie went frequently to buy violets and roses for her aunt to a certain
  flower-shop in the <i>Passage Vivienne</i>. He would wait outside the shop
  till she had finished her purchases, then enter it and buy some flowers that
  she had touched or breathed upon, and wear them for the rest of the day in
  his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>These delicate attentions from one so handsome, so manifestly noble and
  fastidious, caused Marie Cappelle such happiness that she seemed to be
  treading on air. The image of the unknown filled her waking and her sleeping
  dreams and her joy reached its climax when one day, on entering the florist's
  shop, the woman presented her with a large bunch of perfect white roses,
  begging her to accept them as a present from herself. "No doubt," said the
  smiling florist coquettishly, "this little gift will bring me happiness."</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply, she put the white roses in a silk paper and
  then placed them in Marie's arms.</p>

  <p>When the excited girl arrived in her room and unwrapped the flowers to
  arrange them in the vases, a letter fell out on the carpet. She snatched it
  up, broke the seal and read it, then fell almost fainting into a chair. It
  was a love-letter; she learnt that she was "loved, passionately loved, and
  for all her life." It was, of course, from the handsome unknown. Too joyous,
  too excited by this good fortune to be able to contain her emotion, Marie
  pretended to have a bad headache and did not leave the house for several
  days. She peeped through the curtains, however, and saw her dejected admirer
  stationed forlornly on the pavement in front of the house. After four days of
  this he appeared no more, and Marie knew, from the frightful desolation that
  overtook her, what this adventure meant in her life. She wrote a passionate
  reply to the letter she had received, waited for an opportunity, and, when to
  her intense joy she saw the stranger again at Saint-Roch, she contrived, as
  they passed at the doorway, to slip the note into his hand.</p>

  <p>The affair continued like this for several weeks, meetings in the gardens
  of the Tuileries, in the <i>Champs-Elysées</i>, in the church, notes passed
  in bouquets of flowers, dropped with a handkerchief, or even, in the dark
  porch of the church, slipped from hand to hand.</p>

  <p>When the day came for Marie Cappelle to depart for Villers-Hellon, she was
  not greatly disturbed, for she knew that he received the letters she wrote,
  addressed to the unknown, care of the florist's shop, familiar to both of
  them, in the <i>Passage Vivienne</i>. Unhappily she had not been long in the
  country before Madame Garat, entering her room unexpectedly, found her
  writing one of these letters.</p>

  <p>A terrible scene followed. Mme. Garat declared herself revolted to
  discover her niece involved in this imprudent and ridiculous intrigue; she
  humiliated the girl with bitter words. She said that her niece was "lost,
  dishonoured"; she declared that Marie was the victim of an adventurer who
  would show her letters everywhere, make her an object of contempt; that if he
  were not an adventurer but an honourable gentleman, he would never marry a
  young girl so imprudent as to write such letters to a young man unknown to
  her family, with whom she had never exchanged a word.</p>

  <p>"It is far more likely, however," cried the indignant lady furiously,
  "that he is doing all this as a speculation. He believes you are a rich
  heiress, and all the time all your dowry would not buy his silence."</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Marie Cappelle, "I, not yet twenty-two years old, and no
  more hope, no more honour&mdash;oh, my aunt, save me!"&mdash;and bursting
  into tears she fell almost unconscious on the floor, "desperate, her head on
  fire, overwhelmed by these cutting words of contempt." Lalo, her old nurse,
  could barely console her; she declared that she wished to die, and would at
  the first opportunity commit suicide. Her grandfather tried to console her by
  telling her that her aunt had spoken in exaggerated terms, that the
  ridiculous affair was not, after all, so serious; Lalo also declared that in
  her opinion this gentleman could "not be so wicked as to ruin the future of a
  poor girl who had done him no wrong."</p>

  <p>Marie then decided to write a desperate, supplicating letter to the
  stranger, and Lalo said that she would make one of her nephews go six leagues
  to post it secretly at Soissons.</p>

  <p>When Marie was a little calmer, a family council was held; she put herself
  unreservedly in the hands of her grandfather and her aunt, and it was decided
  that Mme. Garat, furnished with full details of the "unknown," should go to
  Paris and discover who and what he was, and what his intentions might be.</p>

  <p>While her aunt was in Paris, Marie spent an agonising time, largely in
  bed, with the most frightful headaches and attacks of fever; only the
  affectionate ministrations of Lalo and her grandfather were able to induce
  her to maintain a little control.</p>

  <p>When her aunt returned there was another family council; Madame Garat was
  no longer violent, but cool and a little ironical. Marie, hardly able to
  support herself on her feet for shame and weakness, sat beside her
  grandfather hiding her face in her hands.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear Marie," said Mme. Garat in an icy voice, "I have found out
  who your hero is. He is a chemist's assistant who has six hundred francs a
  year. I have interviewed these good people. The young man offers you his
  heart and his hand&mdash;you may reign over his rhubarb and his senna before
  the end of the summer."</p>

  <p>Marie was so overwhelmed by this dreadful news that she dared neither
  raise her eyes, nor speak, nor even weep.</p>

  <p>"This proposed marriage does not please me, certainly," added Mme. Garat
  coolly. "You could remain here with us, happy, honoured, loved...but do not
  let us talk any more about it. Love does not know obstacles, and one is
  always happy with the choice of one's heart. Meanwhile your young hero
  returned me your letters, at least these letters&mdash;perhaps you will be
  good enough to tell me, Marie, if you wrote them or not?"</p>

  <p>The lady then drew some letters from her reticule, while Marie, half
  swooning, crouched lower and lower on her seat, until she dropped on her
  knees and hid her face in the skirts of her grandfather's coat.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to tell you, Marie," added Mme. Garat, "that his name is Guyot
  and that his father's shop is not in Paris, but in a small provincial town;
  he was en vacances when he met you. Doubtless love will sweeten your
  exile."</p>

  <p>She proceeded to read aloud in a clear impartial voice the letter that
  Marie had written when she had seen the young man parading beneath her
  window, the answer to the letter she had found in the bouquet of white
  roses.</p>

  <p class="letter">Monday.<br>
  <br>
  If you would only understand that nothing wounds the heart more than neglect!
  Tell me what makes you indifferent to my suffering? But, no, life is full of
  delusions. This was very sweet, but the disappointment which always awaits me
  is once again mine. A caprice for eight days and then&mdash;nothing! And I
  believed you. Oh, the world is very false, and you are of the world.</p>

  <p>Madame Garat sighed, paused, and read the next letter:</p>

  <p class="letter">Tuesday.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>I cannot go out. She will give you this letter. If I see you perhaps I
  shall still believe you. No, good-bye, I pardon everything. Goodbye, be happy
  and never deceive anyone again. Do not write to me any more, do not speak of
  me any more. Oh, for pity's sake, remember that I am an orphan! God must be
  my father and my mother&mdash;everything. I am mad, my head is going round
  and round! Do not deceive me, do not forget me. I have loved you. You are a
  man of honour, I believe in you, save me by the most complete silence. May
  God and may you have pity on me. By an incredible folly my honour is now in
  your hands.</p>

  <p>M. Collard, full of compassion for poor Marie, crouching so forlornly at
  his feet in an access of humiliation, begged his daughter to cease reading
  these foolish letters.</p>

  <p>"Come, my child," he said, patting Marie's thick black hair. "This is only
  a little comedy that one plays, you understand! There has been no proposal of
  marriage. M. Guyot surrendered your letters and all pretensions to your hand
  when he discovered that you were not the rich heiress of the Bank of France,
  but only a poor orphan. As for your letter&mdash;!&mdash;it is simply a
  little romance of a schoolgirl, now terminated."</p>

  <p>This kindness could not save Marie from herself. The disappointment,
  humiliation, shame and disillusionment were too much for her ardent spirit;
  she fell into a state of unconsciousness that lasted several days and
  resulted in a fever that, after tormenting her for weeks, left her in a state
  of excessive weakness and enfeebled by a recurrence of gastritis.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the autumn of 1838, Marie Cappelle's beloved grandfather died, and she
  was plunged anew into emotional scenes and physical and mental sufferings.
  Her position was now, indeed, forlorn. Her grandfather had not, after all,
  been able to leave her a fortune, only a small estate at Villers-Hellon. His
  son, M. Maurice Collard, who had already an heir by his marriage with Mlle.
  Blanche Montaigu, found that he had inherited an estate rendered almost
  worthless by mortgages and a condition of disorder that Marie, playing
  prettily and intermittently at being a <i>châtelaine</i>, had not been by any
  means able to straighten out. There was nothing for Marie, no longer even a
  home at Villers-Hellon. M. Maurice had his own family and did not offer her
  an asylum. She had, apart from what the kindness of her aunts might provide
  for her, a dowry of a hundred thousand francs.</p>

  <p>Her long illness had saved Marie Cappelle from the scorn and reproaches of
  her aunts, the rebukes of her uncle and the compassion of her grandfather, on
  the subject of her foolish love affair, all, under the circumstances, so
  intolerable. As she had escaped from Saint-Denis by having brain-fever, so
  she escaped from the awkward consequences of her imprudent love affair by a
  lingering disease that lasted for months and caused the doctors to shake
  their heads over her and say once more that she must be denied nothing and
  indulged in every whim. How often had this been said of Marie Cappelle!</p>

  <p>During her illness she received news of Marie de Nicolai. That arrogant
  young heiress was married at last, and not so splendidly after all. A certain
  Vicomte de Léautaud, a member of the <i>noblesse de province</i>, who had an
  estate named Busagny, near Pontoise, had proved Marie de Nicolai's choice.
  Some weeks after this fashionable wedding, Marie Cappelle received a letter
  couched in terms of bitter irony from M. Felix Clavé, who had taken his noble
  heart, his wounded feelings, his poetry and his poverty to Algiers.</p>

  <p>After her recovery from her illness and the death of her grandfather,
  Marie Cappelle returned once more to Paris, bitterness in her heart, her
  health seemingly permanently ruined, an exquisite, accomplished
  <i>Parisienne</i>, afflicted with constant gastritis, which rendered it
  unnecessary for her to drink vinegar or to suck lead pencils in order to
  acquire a pale complexion; nor was she any longer forced to diet herself in
  the hope of retaining her slim figure; her stomach, ruined by continual
  medicine, illness, too severe dieting, had become exceedingly capricious and
  delicate; she was liable to sudden attacks of fever, to frequent fits of
  sickness after any but the lightest meals, to nervous headaches, to constant
  internal pains; she was what was then vaguely termed "suffering, delicate,"
  and afflicted by nerves so excitable that the least emotion would cause her
  to fall into hysterics or swoons. She continued her music-playing, her
  romance reading, her round of balls and entertainments. Her aunts began to
  regard her with more and more disapproval, her friends and acquaintances
  whispered that she would soon, for all her vivacity, brilliance and
  seductiveness, be an old maid.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-04"
     id="ch-03-04"></a>4. A MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED</h3>

  <p>Soon after Madame la vicomtesse de Léautaud, reigning in her charming
  little <i>château</i>, near Pontoise, had given birth to a son and heir, she
  wrote to Marie Cappelle asking her to pay her a visit in this "delicious
  retreat."</p>

  <p>Mme. Garat, not sorry to be rid for a while of her difficult niece, urged
  on Marie the acceptance of this invitation. It was true that formerly Marie
  Cappelle had been forbidden the friendship of Mlle. de Nicolai, and Mlle. de
  Nicolai had been forbidden to see Marie Cappelle. But that was a trouble of
  the past; the Comtesse Marie, as a decorous married woman, had no doubt
  completely changed from the wild girl whose exploits had shocked the prudent
  mamas of the noble <i>faubourg</i>. Mme. Garat argued that dear Marie's
  health would be much set up by a stay in the country, by drinking milk fresh
  from the cow, by idle hours in hay-fields and groves and by the general
  change of scene and company. So Marie Cappelle, accompanied by her maid
  Clementine, the daughter of old Lalo, and a fine <i>toilette</i> of Parisian
  clothes, travelled down to Busagny, near Pontoise.</p>

  <p>She found the <i>château</i>, which stood in the midst of a pleasant
  estate, very charming. The place was elegant and well run, but Marie
  Cappelle, who had always envied her richer friend's better fortune, was not
  sorry to note shrewdly that Marie de Léautaud seemed listless and bored, that
  the infant proudly displayed wearing a bonnet of Marie Cappelle's handiwork,
  was puny and whining, that M. de Léautaud was a very ordinary young man, who
  spent most of his time overlooking his estate, fishing and shooting, and that
  there was, after all, nothing very romantic, splendid, or impressive in what
  life had finally offered to the exacting and arrogant Marie de Nicolai.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle had already been at the trouble to inform herself that M.
  de Léautaud's fortune was not large, that he had a fair number of debts, that
  Marie de Nicolai's fortune had been very useful in smoothing out his
  financial difficulties and that the marriage had been a purely business one
  on his part, and on hers a matter of convenience. Despite the dukes,
  marquesses and counts who were supposed to be clamouring and competing for
  the honour of her hand, Marie de Nicolai, like poor Marie Cappelle, had been
  afraid of spinsterhood; she had therefore closed with this not very tempting
  bargain.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Life, however, was pleasant enough at the little <i>château</i>, and Marie
  Cappelle, with her easy social grace, her vivacious ways, her gifts as a
  musician and singer, was soon a favourite with all the numerous company that
  was being entertained. It was the question of a family wedding that was
  occupying everyone and that caused an air of festival to emanate from the
  gracious little <i>salons</i> of the <i>château</i> Busagny.</p>

  <p>An uncle of Mme. de Léautaud, M. Scipion de Nicolai, who lived at the
  neighbouring <i>château</i> of Osny, a famous man of fashion well-known at
  the Jockey Club and on the <i>Boulevard de Gand</i>, was celebrating the
  approaching marriage of his sister-in-law, Mlle. de Beauvoir, a gracious
  young lady of considerable wealth, then entirely occupied with the details of
  her trousseau. During the preparations for this marriage there were frequent
  comings and goings between the two <i>châteaux</i>, and Mme. de Léautaud took
  frequent opportunities of renewing her former intimacy with Marie
  Cappelle.</p>

  <p>On a long, pleasant lawn by the artificial lake, seated in the pavilions
  or on the balcony of the <i>château</i> itself, the two young women discussed
  again the subject that had once absorbed them so completely, which they
  termed "love." Marie Cappelle showed to Mme. de Léautaud the letter she had
  received from M. Clavé in Algiers; to her surprise the other lady showed a
  good deal of embarrassment and agitation, and declared that this epistle was
  a trap. She knew, she said, that M. Clavé was in Paris&mdash;she had seen him
  singing in the chorus in <i>William Tell</i> at the opera. This Marie
  Cappelle vehemently denied; she had frequently been at the opera, she had
  witnessed Rossini's masterpiece, but she had not seen among the members of
  the chorus anyone who remotely resembled M. Clavé.</p>

  <p>The Vicomtesse de Léautaud, however, would not relinquish her point, and
  she declared that she was very uneasy to think that this young man who had
  been the object of her imprudent schoolgirl intrigue, should still be in
  Paris and in possession of her letters so desperately compromising. She
  avowed that her husband was extremely jealous, that he had often reproached
  her with the frivolity of her girlhood, and that she would be ruined should
  he have the least suspicion of the affair with M. Clavé The lady also
  confided to Marie Cappelle that it was largely because of this sinister
  secret that Mlle. Delvaux was still in her household, as a <i>dame de
  compagnie</i>.</p>

  <p>After this agitating affair had been discussed a thousand times and in a
  thousand details, Mme. de Léautaud abruptly started another subject. She
  declared that her dear Marie must have seen for herself that the married
  state meant an end to all such tender romances and foolish dreams as they as
  care-free girls had once indulged in, and she advised her darling friend to
  put all such ideas out of her head, to forget all she had learnt from her
  novel-reading and to take a husband. She added that she had found a suitable
  <i>parti</i>. This, to Marie Cappelle's astonishment, proved to be none other
  than the brother of Mlle. Delvaux.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle listened with attention, and her friend went on to say that
  the <i>prétendant</i> was thirty-eight years old, had no fortune, but high
  hopes for the future, was the <i>sous-préfet</i> of his department,
  intelligent, good-looking, and, as a final attraction, named Georges, and
  that, despite their former differences, Mlle. Delvaux now perfectly
  understood and honoured Marie Cappelle's part in the Clavé intrigue, and
  wished ardently to have her as a sister-in-law. Then, with a sigh of boredom,
  Mme. de Léautaud began to deliver a little sermon:</p>

  <p>"You are nearly twenty-three years old, you have not much fortune, you
  want a good marriage in order that you may enjoy the liberty that is
  necessary to your character. Listen to me without interrupting me with your
  pleasantries and allow me to say those truths that are not agreeable, but are
  very useful. You are always a little invalidish, and continual pains in the
  stomach do not render you very pretty. Soon you will be an old maid, boring
  and bored. You are difficult and capricious, your relatives do not seem to
  take much trouble in settling you. I intend to make you happy despite
  yourself. You must drop all your exaggerated pretensions, your ideas of
  romantic love such as one reads in the novelists and poets, and you must
  resign yourself to make a good <i>mariage de convenance</i>."</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle said that she was resigned to the realities of life, and
  agreed to see M. Georges Delvaux with an idea of considering him as a
  possible husband. Meanwhile she took the precaution to write, without telling
  her hostess what she was doing, to her aunt and to an old friend of her
  father's, M. de Mornay, to ask them to find out all they could about M.
  Georges Delvaux and to advise her if she should accept his hand in
  marriage.</p>

  <p>While she was waiting for these replies, the suitor himself arrived at the
  <i>château</i>. He resembled his sister in having red hair, blue eyes and a
  florid complexion; he was well-dressed, well-behaved and appeared sensible;
  there was nothing in the least romantic about him, but Marie Cappelle was
  prepared to consider him as a suitor for her hand. Her ardent imagination
  already threw a romantic halo, not round the man, but round his position; she
  did not doubt that by using the influence of her relatives, she would be able
  to have him advanced to the position of prefect of his department, and she
  saw herself reigning over a brilliant society that would willingly accept her
  as their patroness and their model.</p>

  <p>M. Delvaux on his side showed himself impressed by the gaiety, elegance
  and seductive graces of Marie. His sister was very amiable and an air of
  carelessness, gaiety and amusement reigned in the little <i>château</i>,
  despite the constant withdrawals from the scene of M. de Léautaud and the
  bored airs of his young wife.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle obtained a little amusement and excitement for herself by
  flirting with M. de Beauvoir, a cousin of the bride. Her health had been
  improved by her stay of several weeks in the country, fresh air, exercise and
  the agreeable emotion that the talk of her marriage had produced in her.
  Sadness and boredom fell from her, she felt herself once more important,
  desired, even loved, and she bloomed brilliantly in the handsome Parisian
  garments that she wore with so much taste&mdash;gowns of ruffled taffeta,
  bonnets of straw with wreaths of marguerites and pompon roses, gauze veils,
  tinsel-striped scarves, dainty flounced parasols, doeskin gloves and satin
  slippers.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A very unpleasant incident suddenly marred the superficial gaiety of these
  days of festival. Mme. de Léautaud had confided to Marie Cappelle that she
  had received from her husband's family a very handsome <i>parure</i> of
  diamonds which was far too costly and conspicuous for her to wear in the
  country, but which she hoped one day to display at the Parisian balls. She
  kept these valuable jewels locked in a case in her bedchamber and several
  times took them out to show them to the admiring glances of Marie, even
  allowing her to try them against her bosom, neck and hair.</p>

  <p>On this occasion a large company was assembled in a room that opened by
  French-windows on to a terrace. A <i>fête</i> was being given to the tenantry
  to celebrate the marriage of Mlle. de Beauvoir, and Busagny was empty save
  for these people who, already arrayed in outdoor attire, were waiting for the
  carriages to take them to Osny.</p>

  <p>An argument arose, provoked by some comment of Marie Cappelle's, on the
  possibility of imitating diamonds so that it would be impossible to detect
  them from the originals. To prove her point, which was vehemently
  contradicted by some of the guests, Marie Cappelle ran upstairs and fetched
  down her Mass book, which was ornamented with strass jewels, and Mme. de
  Léautaud fetched the case that contained her famous <i>parure</i>. The
  diamonds were compared with the strass, and all the ladies declared that the
  real and false stones were identical, and all the gentlemen declared that no
  one would be deceived for a moment.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the argument the company perceived the carriages arriving
  on the drive below the terrace; it was twilight and another distraction
  suddenly occurred in the unexpected display of fireworks, which rose above
  the summer trees. The ladies went out on to the terrace and descended the
  steps, exclaiming about the beauty of the stars and bouquets of fire that
  dazzled with such brilliancy into the violet sky. There was then some bustle
  and confusion about getting into the carriages, and it was not until Mme. de
  Léautaud's vehicle had nearly passed out of her own park into that of Osny
  that she exclaimed with a start of terror that she had left her case of
  diamonds on the work-table by the open window. Bidding the coachman turn the
  horses at once, speaking with profound agitation, she hurried home; then,
  springing from the carriage, Mme. de Léautaud ran up the terrace steps and
  entered the little <i>salon</i>, still in disorder from her gay company of
  guests; she saw the case lying on the pretty little work-table by the open
  window, ran upstairs without opening it, put it in her cabinet, locked it,
  hurried downstairs again, got into the waiting carriage and joined the other
  merrymakers for the wedding festivities at Osny.</p>

  <p>No more was heard of the diamonds until the day before the ceremonious
  marriage was to take place, then Mme. de Léautaud wished to show to some
  relatives who had come to attend the festival her handsome <i>parure</i>; she
  sent her maid to fetch the case; it was brought, but when the owner opened it
  she discovered it to be empty. The diamonds had been stolen:</p>

  <p>A profound and disagreeable agitation caused the joyous badinage of the
  elegant guests to turn to exclamations of dismay. A search was made high and
  low in the <i>château</i>; the guests were all questioned and everyone
  remembered that on the night of the fireworks the case of diamonds had been
  left for a few moments close to the open window, and Mme. de Léautaud
  confessed that she had completely forgotten it and had returned in haste to
  put it in a place of safety, and this in her hurry she had done without
  examining whether the jewels were in the case or not.</p>

  <p>The Vicomte de Léautaud showed little chivalry or consideration on this
  painful occasion; he flew into a violent temper, rated his wife for
  carelessness, and without any thought for the peace of mind and comfort of
  his guests, servants and tenants, alternately raved and lamented this
  unfortunate incident. The wedding festivities were quite marred; people could
  no longer talk of the beautiful bride, the handsome bridegroom, the charming
  bridesmaids and the delicious festival, but only of the mysterious loss of
  these valuable diamonds.</p>

  <p>M. de Léautaud ran about the house pulling out all the drawers, emptying
  all the cabinets, and continually, in the most disagreeable fashion,
  reproaching his wife with her negligence. M. de Nicolai, his father-in-law,
  took cooler but not less severe measures; he insisted upon putting the affair
  in the hands of the police, and in consequence two <i>gendarmes</i> came to
  the <i>château</i> and searched the rooms of all the servants.</p>

  <p>These officials were not able to find the missing jewels; that was not
  strange, considering that the master of the house had already searched in
  every corner, and the dainty little <i>château</i> had been turned
  upside-down.</p>

  <p>During these days of excitement and disagreeable agitation, Marie Cappelle
  was taken with one of her feverish attacks and burning headaches. Confined to
  her bed, and waited on by the faithful Lalo, who had accompanied her in the
  capacity of maid, she still showed a restless interest in the affair of the
  missing diamonds, and she seemed greatly distressed when her maid informed
  her that a certain Etienne, one of the gardeners, had been accused of being
  the thief. Though there was no direct evidence against him, the poor man was
  in much distress and feared that he would at least lose his place; he had
  been, it seemed, working in the garden gathering flowers for the wedding
  festival at the precise moment when the case had been left by the open
  window, and as there had been no one else in the <i>château</i> or near it,
  on him the blame fell.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie Cappelle's distress and discomfiture were increased by the replies
  to her letters to her aunt and M. de Mornay. Both these prudent guardians of
  her future happiness warned her sternly against a marriage with M. Delvaux.
  In the words of M. de Mornay, there was "everything to fear and nothing to
  hope for in such a union." M. Delvaux had absolutely no prospects, and all
  enquiries made about him had resulted in most unfavourable reports.</p>

  <p>Mme. de Léautaud, already greatly irritated by the loss of her diamonds
  and the subsequent scenes that her husband had made, was not ready to receive
  with equanimity Marie's refusal to marry her <i>protégé</i>; both she and her
  mother, Mme. de Nicolai, swept into the sick girl's room and lectured her on
  the pretensions of her friends and her own folly in refusing as good a match
  as she could hope to find. She was not, they reminded her sternly, in a
  position to pick and choose; sick, dependent, plain and difficult-tempered as
  she was, she would be wise to accept the first-comer.</p>

  <p>An effort was made to put all these disagreeables in the background for
  the marriage of Mlle. de Beauvoir, but the company, under their forced
  gaiety, remained exasperated and disturbed, and it was without much regret on
  either side that Marie Cappelle parted from her hostess; the visit that had
  begun so pleasantly ended under a cloud; Marie returned to Paris; after
  travelling through the beautiful June weather under the pine-trees of the
  forests of Saint-Germain in a light <i>briska</i> with two fine horses, she
  had the excitement of finishing her journey in the new railway, which she
  wittily named "The Pegasus of the Materialists."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The rest of Marie Cappelle's summer was spent in visits to Courcy, where
  Mme. de Montbreton, the other Nicolai sister, sympathised with her on the
  disagreeableness of her visit to Mme. de Léautaud, and to Villers-Hellon,
  where, despite the kindness of her uncle and aunt, she was saddened by seeing
  her grandfather's empty chair and those familiar places of her childhood,
  where she would play no more. Here she was ill again; her gastritis returned
  with renewed force, and continual pain rendered her thin and pale.</p>

  <p>Mme. de Montbreton endeavoured to cure her by hypnotism, without much
  success. Long horseback rides, amateur theatricals, and the usual round of
  rustic gaieties indulged in by the elegant persons <i>en vacances</i> passed
  the summer for Marie. She performed with great success in a play by Scribe,
  and it was after one of these performances that, when fatigued with emotion,
  deafened by applause, surrounded by the perfume of the bouquets given her by
  the delighted audience, she received a letter from Mme. Garat saying that M.
  de Martens, her uncle, had at last found a husband for his seductive but
  difficult niece.</p>

  <p>Full of excitement, and expecting not only a settlement in life but all
  manner of romantic adventures, Marie Cappelle returned to the capital still
  flushed and animated by her theatrical success, her carriage piled with
  fading bouquets, tinsel still in her hair, rouge on her cheeks.</p>

  <p>Her aunt received her rather coldly; she had broken up her own holiday to
  come to Paris for this affair and she accused her niece of delaying on the
  road; after this dry preamble Mme. Garat spoke to Marie with an austerity
  equal to that employed by her friends, Mme. de Nicolai and Mme. de Léautaud;
  she also remarked that Marie was twenty-three years old, neither rich nor
  beautiful, indolent and luxurious in her tastes, independent in her temper,
  and that she had but a dismal future before her unless she could find a
  husband. Mme. Garat also hinted that she had done her duty by her sister's
  child and that she would not be sorry to have her establishment free from the
  tiresome presence of this difficult dependant. What she did not mention, but
  what Marie guessed, was that her relatives had been to a matrimonial agency
  in order to procure her a husband. M. de Martens, indeed, tired of the
  perpetual illnesses, emotions, imprudences of Marie, had been to M. Foy, the
  best-known and most reliable matrimonial agent in Paris; he had at once
  suggested to him the son of a postmaster established in one of the suburbs of
  Paris, who had a fine fortune, a handsome face and was twenty-six years
  old.</p>

  <p>It was the advice of Marie's relatives that she should accept this offer,
  but she did not share in their enthusiasm and flounced off to bed with a
  grimace. There were two strong objections to this match in her eyes; one was
  that the social position of a postmaster did not seem to her to equal her
  pretensions, and the other was that she would have to live outside Paris.</p>

  <p>After a day of family argument, M. de Martens declared that he had come
  round to Marie's point of view, that the son of the postmaster was not good
  enough, that he had found another husband, a young ironmaster. The ladies
  laughed coquettishly and asked M. de Martens where he found this "rich mine
  of husbands," as they termed it, to which the baron replied dryly that he met
  these desirable young men in the house of one of his business friends. This
  excuse was accepted, though both Marie and her aunt knew perfectly well that
  the baron was negotiating with a matrimonial agent.</p>

  <p>An ironmaster! Marie Cappelle eagerly seized this suggestion and turned it
  over in her mind. She had known only one iron-master, a certain M. Nuel, who
  was very rich, very elegant and who passed six months in Paris and six months
  in the Vosges; she knew that he had a fine position and a good deal of
  influence in his native country; she remembered his luxurious establishment,
  his wife's Paris gowns and maids. Yes, an ironmaster did not sound a hopeless
  proposition.</p>

  <p>M. de Martens then asked his niece if she objected to going far from
  Paris. This ironmaster's <i>château</i> and business establishment were in
  the Limousin. Of course, once Marie was there she would reign like a queen
  over the provincial society, the <i>château</i> was handsome, and so on and
  so on&mdash;but for a <i>Parisienne</i> to live out of Paris would surely be
  an exile?</p>

  <p>Marie did not think so; she recalled Strasbourg. The life there had been
  in every way as gay, as elegant and as exciting as in Paris. She did not wish
  to live in the suburbs of the capital, which she had seen and
  disliked&mdash;but to be, as her uncle said, the queen of an elegant
  provincial society, to have her own <i>château</i>&mdash;she thought at once
  of Villers-Hellon, of Busagny, of Osny&mdash;well, for a girl in her position
  she might do worse.</p>

  <p>"If one has money," she said in a tone of animation, "all distances
  disappear, and I like the life of a <i>chatelaine</i>."</p>

  <p>She had still her head full of the pleasures of her country visits and she
  saw herself in the position of Mme. de Léautaud or Mme. de Montbreton, not
  only the Queen, but the goddess, of servants, tenantry and neighbours; she
  saw herself entertaining large crowds of her friends and relatives,
  dispensing hospitality with a gracious air, always surrounded by admirers,
  while, of course, at least six months of the year&mdash;the
  winter&mdash;would be spent in Paris.</p>

  <p>While Marie Cappelle was at once weaving rosy dreams about this possible
  future, M. de Martens, her practical uncle, was putting before her the hard
  facts of the case, and these were agreeable enough.</p>

  <p>The prospective husband's name was M. Charles Pouch Lafarge; he was
  twenty-eight years old, vigorous and healthy, of a very honourable family and
  of irreproachable character, most intelligent, and highly respected in his
  province, where he was considered one of the principal inhabitants. He
  possessed one of the handsomest and most agreeable properties in the
  Limousin, a factory, some smelting works, an estate worth at least 200,000
  francs, and considerable revenues coming in from the ironworks. He had been
  six months in Paris on combined business and pleasure, and it was supposed
  that he would continue to spend that period each year in the capital. Not
  only was his business flourishing, but, M. de Martens declared, there were
  considerable hopes that it would greatly increase and, in fact, in time bring
  in a very large fortune indeed&mdash;the new railways would certainly require
  a large quantity of iron.</p>

  <p>This extremely desirable young man wished, the baron declared, to take
  back to his charming <i>château</i> an elegant and intelligent woman who
  would, by her wit, talent and affection, "animate him in his labours and
  entertain and cherish him in his leisure." All this sounded attractive
  enough, but Marie was transported from satisfaction to delight&mdash;almost
  to rapture&mdash;when she was informed that the <i>château</i>, named
  Glandier, was built on the ruins of an ancient Gothic abbey that had been one
  of the richest Carthusian establishments in France; there were cloisters, an
  ancient church, gardens, a river, hills still covered with ancient oak
  trees&mdash;in fact, everything that was fashionable at the
  moment&mdash;romantic, mysterious, sentimental.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle saw herself as the brilliant and beautiful mistress of a
  dwelling that most of her friends would have given ten years of their lives
  to have possessed; she saw herself at once as Mary Stuart, as Isabelle de
  Bourgogne, as Marguerite de Valois, seated at an ogive window with a page in
  attendance, lightly touching the strings of a guitar, while underneath in a
  garden full of roses and lilies, her lover would hasten home to her side
  through a purple twilight spangled with stars.</p>

  <p>There was no relative of M. Lafarge in Paris to answer for him, but he
  gave as references, M. Gauthier (Deputy of Uzerche) and General Petit, peer
  of France.</p>

  <p>Marie noticed that nothing was said about the person of her proposed
  husband, and this reserve made her a little anxious. With all the advantages
  that the match offered, she did not feel that she could unite herself to one
  who had a common, vulgar or mean appearance; an interview therefore that was
  to appear casual was arranged between herself and M. Lafarge; she was to be
  conducted by M. de Martens to a concert in the <i>rue Vivienne</i>, and
  there, as if the thing had taken place by chance, she was to be presented to
  the prospective bridegroom as one of her uncle's friends; a general
  conversation then was to take place, and the day after the young couple were
  to confide to their friends their impressions.</p>

  <p>Marie looked forward to this concert with great excitement; her aunt, who
  seemed full of delight at the future opening before her niece, began at once
  to plan the trousseau and the <i>corbeille</i>, filling the romantic young
  woman's head with details of all the beautiful clothes, ornaments, furniture
  and so on that she would buy for her, painting the delights she would enjoy
  as Queen of the ancient Gothic <i>château</i> in its secluded valley.</p>

  <p>The day of the concert was superb; there was not a cloud on the azure of
  the sky and not a presentiment in the soul of Marie Cappelle. She had been
  dressed by her aunt in a delicious robe of rose-coloured muslin, a bonnet of
  white rice-straw with lavender ribbons; she had been allowed a little powder,
  a little colour on her lips and cheeks, which contrasted admirably with her
  habitual pallor. She looked elegant, ethereal, sophisticated and seductive as
  she floated down the aisle of the concert hall, her white gloved hand resting
  lightly on the arm of her uncle, the stout, easy and capable Russian
  diplomat.</p>

  <p>The concert had begun and the orchestra was playing one of the charming
  valses of Strauss, which brought back to Marie's mind many souvenirs of balls
  and of pleasures, when she was presented to the man proposed to her as her
  future husband.</p>

  <p>Her first impression was not favourable. M. Lafarge, as she had feared,
  was truly ugly, and, what was worse, his figure, his manner, his clothes,
  were those of a provincial, a business man&mdash;nothing here of the
  languorous cavalier, of the fastidious young romantic, of the <i>lion</i> or
  the dandy. Marie recoiled and her intense disappointment was only slightly
  assuaged by reading in the gaping expression of M. Lafarge that she had
  impressed him and pleased him extremely.</p>

  <p>He was seated, next to her at the concert and tried to keep up a
  conversation; this, Marie suspected, from what she could hear of it, was both
  stupid and commonplace, but the brilliant melodies of the orchestra glossed
  it over and she did not need to reply with more than a smile or so.</p>

  <p>Excited, hesitant, doubtful, Marie retired to her room with a headache as
  soon as her party reached the apartment above the Bank of France. Her dreams
  that night were more full of the images excited by the valses of Strauss than
  by the recollection of M. Lafarge.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the morning her aunt, in a state of considerable joyous agitation,
  entered her chamber with a mass of letters in her hand. M. Lafarge had, she
  declared, fallen desperately in love with Marie during the concert, and had
  at once made her an offer of his hand and his fortune. He had also sent the
  most detailed accounts of the latter and many letters of warm recommendation
  from friends&mdash;one from his cousin, who was also an ironmaster in a large
  way, one from the family lawyer, one from the local <i>curé</i>, one from the
  Deputy of his department. All these gentlemen praised M. Lafarge, his
  fortune, his pecuniary and industrial position, his business capacity, his
  beautiful <i>château</i> at Glandier, his domestic virtues and his moral
  character, and all agreed that the Lafarge fortune was one of the finest and
  the most stable in France.</p>

  <p>Marie lay motionless in her coquettish bed while her aunt, seated on the
  satin chair by the side of it, read out in delighted tones all these
  eulogies. Hearing all these attractions, Marie decided to make no objection
  to M. Lafarge's person. She even began to romanticise his appearance; after
  all, was there not something grand and simple&mdash;like one of the savage
  heroes of George Sand&mdash;in those blunt features? His figure, though
  clumsy, was manly, he had good teeth and a quantity of dark chestnut hair.
  Marie dwelt on these advantages and began to foresee her life at Glandier in
  the most picturesque, rainbow colours.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>During the next few days her aunt rushed Marie from shop to shop buying
  her trousseau. She had no more than brief, formal meetings with her future
  husband, who, on these occasions, expressed himself with an enthusiasm
  remarkable in a raw provincial about Marie's beauty, charms and his prospects
  of happiness with her in his delicious <i>château</i> at Glandier. With an
  air of great candour he put before Marie's guardians details of all his
  affairs; his factories brought him in an income of 30,000 to 35,000 francs;
  but this was a mere nothing compared to what he hoped to gain when the new
  railways had been laid down through Uzerche; at present he had to use mules
  for transport. He had discovered also a new way of smelting iron which he was
  eager to patent; in brief, he thought that in a year or so his revenues would
  be augmented to the amount of at least 50,000 francs yearly.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>As to Marie's <i>dot</i>, the young man expressed himself entirely
  disinterested, it was the young woman herself whom he required, whom, as he
  declared, he already loved madly, passionately&mdash;her dowry was of small
  account.</p>

  <p>When these words were repeated to Marie she felt a glow of gratitude
  towards the creature, whom she already, in her sentimental heart, termed "the
  noble savage."</p>

  <p>Her delight was increased by a plan of the <i>château</i> of Glandier
  which her aunt showed her, and which was embellished by a watercolour drawing
  of the dwelling itself; nothing could have been more acceptable than this
  delicious <i>château</i> with the blue tiles contrasting coquettishly with
  the blue sky, white terraces descending one below the other to a well-kept
  garden where there were parterres of flowers, rococo fountains and classic
  statues; a well-kept lawn sloped gently down to a river bordered with weeping
  willows and strewn with lilies; on the other side of this was a magnificent
  forest; round the gardens were the ancient Gothic ruins of the monastery and
  church in a delightful state of owl-haunted, ghost-ridden decay.</p>

  <p>Marie could not abstain from a cry of delight. Madame Garat embraced her,
  exclaiming:</p>

  <p>"This little <i>château</i> is yours! The banns will be published this
  morning!"</p>

  <p>Marie had been acquainted with her betrothed only four days; however,
  there were excellent excuses for this haste. M. Lafarge had been away from
  his business for six months, and it was absolutely indispensable that he
  should return immediately; moreover, he was most anxious, "burning with
  impatient love" as he termed it, to show off his young wife at the races at
  Pompadour, which took place on the 19th of the month, and where the
  <i>élite</i> of several departments would be gathered.</p>

  <p>Marie was startled, moved, excited by all this haste; she seated herself
  at the piano and dreamily played a romance by Liszt while Mme. Garat and M.
  Lafarge discussed her <i>corbeille</i>, which the enamoured bridegroom wished
  to have as costly as possible and which Mme. Garat archly declared must not
  be "foolishly luxurious."</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge left this discussion to join his <i>fiancée</i> at the piano;
  he declared that he too was enchanted by music, that he discovered in Marie a
  marked talent and that he intended to buy her a handsome piano for
  Glandier.</p>

  <p>Delighted with this delicate generosity, Marie spent the rest of the day
  in the great <i>salons</i> of M. Pleyel. Several pianos were sent to the
  apartment of Mme. Garat that Marie might try the effect of them in a small
  room; finally she chose a delicious little square piano, which was sent on
  ahead of her by road to the Limousin that she might find it there on her
  arrival.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>During these days of almost frenzied preparation for her marriage, Marie
  had little time to think of her future husband; she was entirely absorbed in
  the frivolous delights of buying clothes and fitting on the various garments
  that comprised her trousseau, and that, chosen by her aunt from one of the
  finest dressmakers' of Paris, showed good taste and elegant simplicity as
  well as the last caprices of Parisian fashion. The <i>corbeille</i> had been
  left to the exquisite discretion of Mme. Garat, who searched all Paris for
  charming, costly novelties for the <i>toilette</i>&mdash;some new materials,
  some bonnet never seen before, some surprising hat, but all stamped with the
  true elegance of the fastidious gentlewoman.</p>

  <p>All Marie's relatives and friends were delighted to hear of her good, in
  fact brilliant, fortune. Antonine, her little sister, who had been for some
  months Madame de Violaine, embraced her with joy, and she received a long
  letter of congratulation from Mme. de Léautaud. This lady could not resist
  writing, however, of the continued chagrin and misery of her household caused
  by the loss of the diamonds, of which no trace had been found and which M. de
  Léautaud continued to lament with unabated fury.</p>

  <p>Handsome presents for Marie arrived from her beloved Villers-Hellon, sent
  by her aunt and uncle Collard, her old servants and tenantry. Marie had asked
  that in her <i>corbeille</i> there should be a purse containing fifty
  <i>louis d'or</i>; this she spent in giving presents to all these friends of
  her youth and childhood; she took the greatest pleasure in going round the
  delightful Parisian shops and in buying these little souvenirs, which she
  wrapped up and sent off herself. For her sister, then expecting her first
  child, she bought a complete <i>layette</i>; for her aunt, Mme. Garat, she
  bought a magnificent piece of English lace, which, on the day of her
  marriage, she coquettishly attached to her aunt's bonnet; for her uncle there
  was a cane with a golden knob; for Mme. de Martens a bracelet that she had
  admired in a shop-window; to her cousin Hermine she sent a box of
  water-colours and to Mme. de Léautaud a set of buttons in the form of lucky
  ladybirds.</p>

  <p>As the day of the marriage approached, M. Lafarge redoubled his
  attentions; anxious to win the good graces of his bride's family, he went to
  Enghien, where Madame de Martens was taking the waters, and was approved by
  that lady. Whenever Marie saw him he was everything that was attentive; in a
  hundred delicate ways he showed Marie those elegant attentions that she most
  desired. He had heard, he said, that she was very fond of baths, and he
  showed her the plan of a handsome bathroom that he was going to have built
  entirely for her use at Glandier. He feared, he said, that his bride was too
  delicate to support the fatigue of travelling to the Limousin in the ordinary
  post-chaise, so he had bought an elegant <i>briska</i> and two smart horses
  for the journey. Every morning there arrived, in his name, an exquisite
  bouquet of flowers surrounded with silver lace and tied with rose-colour or
  azure ribbons.</p>

  <p>"He is as good as he is ugly!" exclaimed the affectionate Lalo.</p>

  <p>Marie was allowed to have one or two interviews with her future husband,
  her little cousin Gabrielle acting as chaperon; she took these occasions to
  ask M. Lafarge, eagerly enough, to describe to her her future residence. He
  depicted this in the most attractive colours; he said that her <i>salon</i>,
  very large and very light, was entirely furnished in red velvet with a
  Persian carpet and some handsome pictures, that the dining-room opened on to
  a terrace, which, in its turn, gave on to the most delicious view, that she
  should have a horse of any breed or colour she liked, that his own favourite
  mount was ebony black, and that he had five or six good horses in his
  stables; as to the establishment, it consisted of his mother&mdash;and Mme.
  Lafarge, according to her son, was waiting to receive her daughter-in-law
  with the most profound, the most anxious affection&mdash;who ruled over a
  household of four menservants (not counting the gardeners and the coachmen),
  a cook and two maids. It was agreed that Marie should bring her own <i>femme
  de chambre</i> with her, and she decided at once to take Clementine, who was
  the young niece of the devoted Lalo; pert, charming and gifted, this Clé, as
  she was termed, was an attractive, indolent young Parisian
  <i>grisette</i>.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>This excitement was suddenly broken by a rather disagreeable piece of
  news, which was a thunderbolt to Marie. One day when Mme. de Martens, who had
  come to Paris for the wedding, had brought her a plain gold ring, inside
  which was the date when she had first met M. Lafarge, then his name, then
  hers, she told her niece:</p>

  <p>"My child, I want you to be reasonable. I have just learnt something that
  is natural enough, but that I am sure you will not care about. M. Lafarge is
  a widower."</p>

  <p>Marie was extremely upset. There were only three days before she was to
  sign her contract, but still she had a sensation of regret and fear, as if,
  even now, she wished to draw back; sinister and romantic ideas came into her
  exalted mind; she had often said, she declared, that she would never marry a
  widower.</p>

  <p>"I will not," she vowed, "replace a cold bride who sleeps in her coffin,"
  and regardless of the caresses and exhortations of her aunt, she broke into a
  passion of tears. She was only reconciled to the marriage by the declarations
  of all her relatives that she could not take back her word once pledged, and
  that she would look a fool if the marriage did not take place.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, loth of August, the family notaries and all Marie's masculine
  relatives were gathered in the apartment above the Bank of France for the
  examination and signing of her marriage contracts. Marie did not read these,
  neither were they explained to her. She sat on a stool at the foot of the
  <i>chaise longue</i>, on which Antonine, languid and suffering, was resting,
  and the two sisters talked together of the joys of maternity.</p>

  <p>The contracts signed, it was suddenly announced that as it was really
  necessary for the young couple to depart for the Limousin as soon as
  possible, the civil ceremony might take place that very day. Before Marie had
  time to protest, her aunt had dressed her in the most charming
  <i>toilette</i> of her trousseau, hurried her into a carriage and driven with
  her to a large gloomy building, where, in a little dark chamber, they were
  received by an usher who grimaced a formal welcome and opened before them
  books in which they had to write their names and titles.</p>

  <p>Here they were joined by M. Lafarge and his supporters, and the whole
  company proceeded to a <i>salon</i> with dirty draperies surmounted by the
  Gallic cock, where they were gravely received by a fat man wearing a
  tricolour scarf holding a copy of the French Marriage Code in his hands.</p>

  <p>Marie glanced mechanically over her shoulder at the large glass that gave
  her the only pleasing picture in the room, that of herself in her charming
  lilac-and-white gown, with her white straw bonnet and the long, floating,
  pale-green feathers; despite this consolation she was so awed by this
  lugubrious ceremony, that she burst into tears, and was only comforted when
  her aunt told her that now, as a married woman, she was free and independent,
  and that she might enjoy her first day of liberty all by herself without even
  the company of her husband or her sister.</p>

  <p>Putting her own pretty little <i>coupé</i> at the service of her niece,
  Mme. Garat returned with the other members of the party to the apartment
  above the Bank of France, and Marie Lafarge, as she now was, for the first
  time completely alone, unspied on and untrammelled, drove through Paris.</p>

  <p>She went first to the flower market, and told the coachman to drive her up
  and down the street lined with the radiant, odorous flowers, shrubs and
  plants that now, in this month of August, were enamelled in their most
  beautiful colours, adorned with their richest lustres and most pungent
  perfumes.</p>

  <p>Marie then went to the church of Saint-Roth, which she entered, and,
  kneeling in the cool gloom&mdash;so refreshing after the heat of the
  day&mdash;offered a short prayer to God and her dear ones then in
  Paradise.</p>

  <p>She concluded her adventure with a visit to Mme. de Valence, who was
  receiving company and who was astonished to see Marie enter alone floating
  her plumes and her cashmere shawl with the assurance of a married woman.
  There followed a charming little gossip with her old friend; she told her
  that she was to remain "mademoiselle" to the entire world for another two
  days until the religious ceremony had taken place. She thanked Mme. de
  Valence for the beautiful scarf she had sent her and so, with laughter,
  kisses and gaiety, the two women parted.</p>

  <p>Marie returned along the <i>Champs-Elysées</i>. The weather was superb, an
  elegant crowd were walking under the shade of the tall <i>allées</i>; Marie
  felt happy to think that she would now be allowed to join those people
  without a chaperon or any guardian save the man whom she now thought of as
  her lord and master. She ordered the carriage to stop and, dismounting,
  joined the crowd under the trees; but she soon found that many curious and
  censorious glances were passed in her direction, and, covered with confusion,
  had to regain the <i>coupé</i>.</p>

  <p>When she arrived at her aunt's apartment she found M. Lafarge waiting for
  her with a magnificent bouquet of orange flowers and magnolia. That evening a
  party was given in her honour; everyone was pleased, flattering, gay; Marie
  felt extremely happy. Refusing to put on any of her bridal splendour she
  attired herself in a robe of plain Indian muslin and in her dark hair wound
  some garlands of daisies, adorned only with a few rose-coloured ribbons.</p>

  <p>It was with a light and confident heart that the bride danced until the
  dawn, with smiles for those whom she was about to leave and smiles for him to
  whom she was about to confide her life. When she reached her chamber she was
  so tired that she flung herself upon her bed and slept, without removing her
  crushed muslin or her disarranged daisy wreaths.</p>

  <p>The next day, a Sunday, Marie, in reaction from her high spirits of the
  Saturday, was sentimental and tearful, as she thought of all the farewells
  still to be made, saw the reddened eyes of her sister and the good Lalo,
  noticed the disorder of her dear, pretty little room, which already had an
  abandoned look and was full of cardboard boxes and faded bouquets.</p>

  <p>Her vexation was increased when M. Lafarge knocked at her door, and,
  despite her protests, insisted on entering, seizing her round the waist and
  giving her a smacking kiss.</p>

  <p>Marie's delicacy was outraged, her nerves jangled. She disdainfully
  withdrew herself from her husband's embrace and burst into tears; nor, when
  M. Lafarge followed her and on his knees demanded pardon, did she grant more
  than a formal acceptance of his apologies.</p>

  <p>That evening was spent by the newly-married couple and Marie's friends and
  relatives in going to dine at Véry's restaurant, and afterwards in seeing the
  circus in the <i>Champs-Elysées</i>; Marie returned from this evening's
  entertainment in a state of high nervous tension; she had no sooner reached
  her room than she began to relate to Clé the following story:</p>

  <p>"In front of their seats at the circus had been a young man and his father
  and an old retired officer of the most brutal appearance. The last, in taking
  out his snuff-box, knocked off the old man's hat. An argument had ensued,
  during which the soldier had conducted himself with the greatest rudeness.
  The young man had taken his father out of the theatre, then had returned, and
  in a whisper arranged a duel with the coarse aggressor, who had remarked: 'I
  shall meet you very willingly, monsieur, but I have never missed my
  man&mdash;I am merely warning you.'</p>

  <p>"'Be silent! To-morrow at eight o'clock. Here is my card and my
  address.'</p>

  <p>"I became," declared Marie, "quite pale on hearing these words. The young
  man, looking up, saw that I had overheard and sympathised, and thanked me
  with a grateful glance. He then left the theatre."</p>

  <p>Marie had been, she declared, so preoccupied by this little drama that she
  had not been able to enjoy a minute of the spectacle. Before this was over,
  however, the brutal old soldier had drawn out the young man's card with his
  handkerchief and let it fall on the ground. Marie had seized the chance,
  stooped down quickly, picked up the card, thrust it in her mouth, chewed it
  to pieces, and, as she declared, returned home feeling that she had done at
  least one good action.</p>

  <p>She was far more occupied by this little drama than she was by her own
  future and sat up far into the night relating to the sympathetic
  <i>grisette</i> the pallor, noble appearance, black eyes and dignified
  behaviour of the unknown young man who had shown such tenderness towards his
  aged father and such gallantry in, defending him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The next day was that of the religious ceremony; Marie was adorned in
  white satin, a trembling crown of orange blossom was pressed on her long
  black locks, rich veils of English lace were placed beneath this virginal
  coronal, and thus attired she knelt before her two aunts, who blessed her in
  the name of her mother, in the name of her father, in the name of all the
  absent ones.</p>

  <p>Before this touching ceremony was completed M. Lafarge entered the
  <i>salon</i>; he too knelt before the two ladies and covered Marie's hands
  with kisses.</p>

  <p>The marriage took place at the church of the <i>Petits-Pères</i>; Marie
  found the Mass very short and the sermon very dry. Her aunts were pleased at
  her behaviour and told her afterwards that she had been a bride "of perfect
  dignity and decorum."</p>

  <p>A long and animated wedding breakfast followed, then Marie was taken into
  Mme. Garat's boudoir, where her two aunts gave her little homilies as to her
  future duties as wife and <i>châtelaine</i>. This over, the bride's cousins
  took off her marriage robe and divided among themselves her crown of orange
  blossom. One of the pure flowers of this virginal crown was preserved by
  Marie herself; she enclosed it in a little locket in the form of a heart that
  once belonged to her mother, and vowed inwardly that it should never leave
  her; she was by now in a state of great emotion.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The departure of the bridal couple for the Limousin had been fixed for
  four o'clock, but M. Lafarge, who had gone about his affairs, did not arrive
  at this hour; Marie, already half-suffocated by kisses, tears, farewells and
  embraces, had an attack of nerves at this delay. She was placed half-fainting
  upon Mme. de Martens' bed and the departure was put off until the morrow.</p>

  <p>Marie passed a night of sickness, tears and nervous apprehensions, watched
  by Mme. de Martens and her sister Antonine, while Mme. Garat, who had had
  enough of emotional crises to last her a lifetime, went to the opera to hear
  Duprez.</p>

  <p>This was the end of all the delays. In the morning Marie was forced to
  tear herself away from her affectionate relatives, put on her charming plumed
  bonnet and cashmere shawl and ascend the pretty little <i>briska</i> that M.
  Lafarge had bought for his <i>voyage de noces</i>. Clementine, the coquettish
  Parisian <i>grisette</i>, was on the box with the smart liveried coachman,
  while behind were strapped the elegant trunks and boxes that contained
  Marie's necessaries for the journey; her heavy luggage had, like the Pleyel
  piano, been sent in advance by wagon.</p>

  <p>It was a superb August day, the early morning was fresh and brilliant. As
  the little <i>briska</i> rolled out of Paris, Marie, looking from the window,
  saw about her woods and fields glowing in rich colours beneath the azure sky;
  she saw Clementine and the coachman talking gaily, coquettishly. As the fresh
  wind blew across her face she felt soothed, and began once more to indulge in
  romantic dreams of the future.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge certainly adored her; it was true that she had not learnt to
  love him, but she was quite prepared to believe that she would soon do so; he
  was so attentive, so respectful. She recalled the gentle kisses that he had
  imprinted on her brow and those with which he had covered her hands; she
  remembered with pleasure his presents, the bathroom, the <i>briska</i>, the
  piano, his gifts of flowers, his distantly adoring glances. It seemed that
  the pages from all the romances she had ever read came into her head; she
  imagined M. Lafarge in the role of timid, humble lover, wooing her with the
  greatest delicacy&mdash;music beneath her window, baskets of flowers every
  morning, tender, notes slipped into the centre of a bouquet&mdash;while she
  would gradually begin to grant him the most reserved of favours, the tips of
  her fingers, a kiss on the forehead, a saunter beneath the moon that would
  silver the oaks of Glandier, or the ancient cloisters of the Carthusian
  monks.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-05"
     id="ch-03-05"></a>5. CASTLE IN THE AIR</h3>

  <p>Marie Lafarge, still gazing from the window of the <i>briska</i>, was
  dreaming of love, of a manly arm on which she could rest when fatigued, of a
  voice vibrant with tenderness that would whisper in her ears "I love you,"
  and that, later, with the first star of the night, would murmur "My angel, do
  you love me?" and the morning passed rapidly.</p>

  <p>A halt to water the horses reminded her of her companion; she glanced
  round; her husband was asleep in the corner of the <i>briska</i>. The halt
  awakened him; he stretched, gave a prolonged yawn, and instead of the
  passionate endearments that Marie was pleasurably expecting, he demanded in a
  tone of voice she had never heard before:</p>

  <p>"Well, now, little woman, where's the cold chicken?"</p>

  <p>Marie was filled with fear, astonishment and disgust; M. Lafarge, who took
  no notice of her dismay, drew from under the seat a basket well stored with
  provisions; among these was a roast fowl, which the young man unwrapped with
  relish and tore in half with his fingers, offering a portion to his
  bride.</p>

  <p>Marie refused with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"Are you ill?" demanded M. Lafarge, drawing out a large bottle of
  Burgundy. "Here, take a glass of this. This will cheer you up."</p>

  <p>Marie, pale, half-fainting with mortification, shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Well, you and I are one, so I'll drink the whole lot, and that'll be the
  same thing," leered M. Lafarge, and complacently tipping up the bottle poured
  the contents down his throat.</p>

  <p>This was too much for Marie; the carriage had not yet started; she sprang
  out and told Clementine that she would take her place on the box-seat.</p>

  <p>"The odour that Monsieur's dinner gives out&mdash;it's impossible!" she
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>After a couple of hours on the box-seat she took advantage of another halt
  to take her place again in the carriage, daintily disposing her silken skirts
  and flounced mantle. M. Lafarge was now absorbed in his accounts or
  note-books; his wife began to talk to him of novels, of theatres, and of her
  dear, beloved Villers-Hellon. M. Lafarge seemed to take no interest in any of
  these subjects, replying to his wife's pretty conversation merely with
  grunts, but when she mentioned the beautiful forests near Villers-Hellon, he
  became suddenly animated and began to talk about the immense quantity of wood
  that his furnaces consumed, the price he had to pay for fuel and charcoal,
  and the difficulties of getting supplies since the magnificent oak forests of
  the monks were now almost demolished. As Marie did not reply to this
  conversation, to her insufferably dull, M. Lafarge took his portfolio out of
  his pocket and began to make a list of his expenses, an occupation that he
  evidently found disagreeable, judging from his frowns, grimaces and
  grunts.</p>

  <p>Towards five o'clock the bridal couple reached Orleans. The interior of
  the <i>briska</i> had been insupportably hot and Mme. Lafarge had a violent
  headache. The sky had clouded over, the air was oppressive, and the young
  woman, nervous and exhausted, felt as if enclosed in a mantle of lead. She
  had difficulty in ascending the stairs, even with the help of Clementine, and
  as soon as she reached the chamber that had been assigned to her, she
  demanded a hot bath. This was brought, and Mme. Lafarge, slipping off her
  elegant but dusty <i>toilette</i>, sank with a sigh of relief into the water
  that she had perfumed with a flask of the orange-flower scent that she
  carried with her among her luxurious <i>toilette</i> necessaries.</p>

  <p>Clementine was in the ante-chamber preparing a cup of delicate China tea
  for her fatigued mistress when M. Lafarge struck violently upon the door.
  When the waiting-maid said haughtily and reproachfully that Madame was in her
  bath, the ironmaster answered with a brutal accent that he knew it and that
  was the reason why he wished to enter the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Madame is my wife," he cried rudely, "to the devil with all these
  Parisian niceties! These silly monkey tricks!"</p>

  <p>Madame Lafarge overheard the altercation and, raising her voice, entreated
  her husband not to make a scene on the stairhead and added that in a quarter
  of an hour she would be attired and ready to receive him. The reply to this
  was a storm of curses and foul words from M. Lafarge, which caused his young
  wife to shudder with genuine disgust. She gathered, from his almost
  incoherent expostulations, that he wished to insist upon entering her room,
  that he was not, as she might think, an imbecile, and that he had been fooled
  enough by her sickening Parisian whims.</p>

  <p>Shivering with indignation and from the cold air on her wet body, Mme.
  Lafarge threw a towel round her, rushed into the ante-chamber and called with
  the tone of a tragedy queen through the keyhole:</p>

  <p>"Understand, once and for all, that you can force me to nothing!" After
  another explosion of bad language from behind the door, the indignant husband
  went away.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge, confounded and exasperated, and really ill and fatigued,
  dressed herself hastily, flung herself on a couch and drank the tea prepared
  by Clementine, while that faithful servant went to find M. Lafarge, with whom
  she expostulated with all the impertinent vivacity of a Parisian
  <i>grisette</i>, telling him that he would kill his wife if he continued
  scenes of that sort, that she had never been used to such treatment, such
  brutality, coarseness and lack of all consideration.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge took these reproaches ill; he shrugged his shoulders and told
  the maid, to whom he had begun to take an intense dislike, that Madame might
  please herself during the journey, but when they reached Glandier she would
  have to learn her place.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge sailed out of her bedroom pale and offended; she passed her
  husband without deigning to cast him a word. He demanded with a leer if she
  had got over her childish mood, then, evidently fearing that she was really
  ill, he became, in his clumsy way, attentive, and allowed her to pass an hour
  alone on the balcony while the carriage was made ready.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful evening, the sky covered with brilliant stars, the air
  scented with the wayside flowers and trees, and Mme.</p>

  <p>Lafarge's courage was restored to her in this romantic atmosphere. She
  began even to find a certain interest, not to say pleasure, in the thought of
  the violent passion she must have aroused in her husband's breast and to turn
  over in her mind the thousand subtle coquetries and caprices that she would
  use to refine this crude ardour to the ideal delicacy that she required in a
  lover.</p>

  <p>She slept a little, lulled by the movements of the carriage, and when in
  the morning they arrived at Châteauroux she had recovered something of her
  spirits.</p>

  <p>In this little town the bridal couple were received by M. Pontier, M.
  Lafarge's uncle, a man of fifty years of age with a fresh, open face and warm
  and expansive manners, and Mme. Lafarge's spirits continued to rise. The
  Pontiers were very amiable, paid her a thousand compliments, offered her a
  charming <i>déjeuner</i>, and Mme. Pontier, her new aunt, informed her that
  she would accompany her as far as Glandier; this reassured Mme. Lafarge, for
  she believed that her husband would control his transports in the presence of
  this chaperon.</p>

  <p>She was, however, displeased with the chuckling words of condolence that
  Mme. Pontier addressed to her when they were alone in that lady's chamber,
  Marie with a daily paper across her knees, Mme. Pontier squeezing with hot
  irons the curl papers that confined her tresses; these, she told Marie, had
  been arranged by her husband, who acted as her <i>femme de chambre</i>.</p>

  <p>"You should do the same, my dear Marie. It is most economical and
  commodious to have one's husband as one's lady's maid. Pontier is a divine
  hairdresser, has a ravishing touch with the lace or a ribbon, can drape a
  shawl or a sash better than anyone, and has a light hand with the
  ironing."</p>

  <p>Marie smiled in amiable disdain at this inelegant arrangement, but Mme.
  Pontier's next words offended her deeply. The good lady turned on her stool
  and with a broad smile said:</p>

  <p>"You had a good deal of courage to leave Paris for Glandier! Why, it is a
  shame to send anyone like you to an establishment like that. Charles is as
  ugly as his own iron, and your mother-in-law is a woman without education,
  ideas or manners." She laughed meaningly, paid several insipid compliments to
  the beauty, grace and pretty air of Mme. Lafarge, and hardly concealed her
  wonder that she had not been able to do better with so many charms.</p>

  <p>Marie replied disdainfully that she liked the life of a <i>châtelaine</i>,
  that she esteemed her husband highly, that she intended to spend half the
  year in Paris, and during the other half to entertain her relatives at
  Glandier.</p>

  <p>Mme. Pontier laughed, lifting her plump shoulders, and began to ask
  curiously about the Parisian life, that, no doubt, Mme. Lafarge had led. She
  talked about Victor Hugo, about Alexandre Dumas, and then about the immoral
  Mme. Sand.</p>

  <p>"Such a woman, I assure you," said Mme. Pontier, "would not be received in
  even the humblest <i>salon</i> of the Limousin. Why, most of the women here
  have never even heard her name. One of her infamous books, that entitled
  <i>Lélia</i>, came into my hands&mdash;the <i>sous-préfet</i> lent it to my
  husband. Is it not a detestable book? I hope you have not read it, my dear
  Marie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have read that, and <i>Indiana</i>," replied Mme. Lafarge coldly.
  "I am not prepared to dispute about the morals of these romances, but you
  must admire that beautiful prose, splendid and gracious as a diamond, hidden
  in the leaves of a rose."</p>

  <p>At this Mme. Pontier cast her eyes to heaven and said she was astonished
  to find so much perversity in one so young.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The tiresome journey to Glandier began again. Mme. Pontier and Mme.
  Lafarge shared the interior of the carriage with a soiled and dirty greyhound
  bitch, which was a great favourite with Mme. Pontier, but which annoyed Mme.
  Lafarge intensely by pawing all over her elegantly frilled skirts. The animal
  rendered the travelling detestable to Marie Lafarge, who, however, as she
  ironically said to herself&mdash;"perceiving that in the heart of Mme.
  Pontier the greyhound was her daughter"&mdash;received her as a cousin and
  allowed her to sit on her lap or the edges of her skirt.</p>

  <p>After leaving Châteauroux the scenery became wilder and grander; Marie,
  looking out of the window, beheld several magnificent landscapes, rocks,
  valleys, mountains and fine forests of ancient trees.</p>

  <p>Towards the evening M. Lafarge left the box-seat and joined the two women
  in the interior of the carriage. The conversation then became very free and
  easy, and turned, in coarse terms, on the primitive marriage customs of the
  Limousin; so crudely did aunt and nephew enlarge on this topic that Mme.
  Lafarge withdrew into her corner and, shading her face with her hand,
  pretended to sleep.</p>

  <p>When the party reached Massera a terrible storm, which had arisen
  suddenly, broke over the landscape. The dawn was blotted out by grey clouds.
  At eight o'clock in the morning it was not possible to see more than a white
  ribbon of road winding between forests, closed in by heavy and continuous
  rain that the carriage appeared enveloped in a thick grey mist. The postilion
  put up his hood; the horses, steaming and panting, struggled on the slippery
  road.</p>

  <p>The storm had nothing abated of its dismal violence when Mme. Pontier and
  M. Lafarge pointed out to Marie some broken-down hovels, which they said
  formed the suburb of Sainte-Eulalie belonging to the town of Uzerche.</p>

  <p>The carriage rocked along the road, at one side of which flowed the
  swollen waters of the Vézère, and then stopped at a mean-looking inn where
  Marie was welcomed by her brother-in-law, M. Buffière. This personage Marie
  found commonplace and even vulgar in appearance; disappointed and disdainful,
  she suffered him to kiss her cheeks and then retired to an upper room while
  the two men went out to examine the carriage, which had broken a wheel on the
  rough, slippery road.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge threw herself on the bed she found in a corner of the room,
  but an extremely disagreeable odour rose from the stale draperies and
  coverlets, and, in disgust, she placed herself on a chair by the window where
  at least she could have a little fresh air, and asked Clementine that a cup
  of tea might be brought to her.</p>

  <p>After a long delay of an hour or so, during which Mme. Lafarge's
  disappointment, fatigue and sick headache all increased, Clementine returned
  almost in tears. On a tray was what the Limousin inn considered "the fragrant
  beverage of China"; a large water jug, closed with a paper lid, contained a
  few tea-leaves floating about in tepid water.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge put aside the nauseous drink in disgust and, throwing open
  the window, looked out over Uzerche. The rain had ceased, but a heavy mist
  obscured the houses; suddenly, animated and joyous, all the bells of all the
  churches of the little town rang out, and at the same moment all the doors
  were opened; looking down through the mist Marie could see the faithful
  people turning towards the churches; she remembered, with a pang, that it was
  the <i>fête</i> day of the Virgin, of Our Lady of August, her own.
  patron.</p>

  <p>Snatching up her cashmere shawl she ran from the room; she would take her
  disappointment, her fatigue, her misery, to the Altar of Our Lady, but on the
  stairs she met her husband, who told her that it would be impossible for her
  to go out.</p>

  <p>"You will be," he said coarsely, "the object of all the stares, of all the
  <i>cancans</i>, of all the jokes of the entire populace."</p>

  <p>"What does that matter?" replied Marie Lafarge disdainfully. "I am above
  such mean considerations."</p>

  <p>"I have told you," he insisted with a brutal accent, "you cannot go. I do
  not wish to be made ridiculous. I know a great many people&mdash;I have even
  relations here. Nothing will be noticed or talked about but your Parisian
  clothes."</p>

  <p>"You flatter my poor taste," replied Marie haughtily, "but since you order
  it, I will not go to church."</p>

  <p>"Don't show your claws, my little cat," grinned her husband. "It is only
  because I love you that I don't want everybody staring at your shawls, your
  jewels, your plumes."</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge returned to the dismal <i>hôtel</i> bedroom; she recalled
  the other days of this August <i>fête</i> when she had always been dressed in
  white, the livery of the Virgin, when her grandfather, during her stays at
  Villers-Hellon, had always sent her a special flower to place in her bosom;
  always in the evening there had been a <i>fête</i> given for Marie; she had
  had a cake with her name in candles and in flowers; she had danced until the
  evening, when she had slept, fatigued with excitement and pleasure. How
  different was this <i>fête</i> day; she was alone, isolated, without prayers,
  without flowers, without friends.</p>

  <p>It was nearly eleven, o'clock before the carriage was mended. Marie was
  glad to leave the ugly, dismal little town behind; she fixed her mind on her
  charming little castle, which she hoped soon to see. She remembered the
  drawing over which she had pored with such delight in Paris, the Gothic
  ruins, the feudal estates, the forests, the delicious little <i>château</i>
  with the blue tiles against the blue sky.</p>

  <p>At Vigeois there was an hour's halt. Madame Pontier here left the bridal
  couple. A cousin of M. Lafarge received them in his house and offered them
  saddle horses for the rest of the journey, but Marie was so bruised and
  shaken by the fatigue of the long travelling that she preferred to remain in
  the carriage.</p>

  <p>At this there was much exclamation; the road was bad, hardly fit for a
  carriage, and she would be even more jolted about if she insisted on
  traversing the savage country round Glandier in a wheeled vehicle than if she
  went on horseback.</p>

  <p>The day had darkened down again into storms; heavy clouds covered the sky,
  the trees seemed to bend beneath the weight of the rain, heavy drippings from
  their leaves increased the volume of water on the roadway. The road became
  worse and worse, the horses could hardly drag the carriage over the stones,
  the streams of water, the ruts left by small farm carts.</p>

  <p>After three hours of this slow progress Mme. Lafarge had to descend from
  the carriage and with her husband's help to pick her way along the wet rough
  road under the pouring rain while the coachman led the horses and tried to
  assist the lamenting Clementine. Marie's elegant flowing clothes, cashmere
  shawl, plumed bonnet, thin shoes and flowing skirts were soon soaked with
  rain. Her pride and her vanity alike were wounded; she insisted on entering
  the carriage again and tried desperately to repair her <i>toilette</i>.</p>

  <p>A shout from her husband brought her to the window. He pointed out where,
  through the rain, columns of black smoke were rising above the dripping
  trees.</p>

  <p>"That is Glandier&mdash;my factory," he grinned through the rain that
  poured off his hat.</p>

  <p>Marie did not reply; she appeared to be in a trance.</p>

  <p>They soon cleared the forest and Marie saw the dark outlines of the iron
  factory rise before her; smoke from the furnaces covered the countryside;
  there had been no drawing of these works on the plan of Glandier that Marie
  had seen in Paris, and she had forgotten to ask where they were or what
  effect they might have on her own <i>château en style gothique</i>.</p>

  <p>The carriage stopped at a broken-down wall and a mean, rusty gate, behind
  which was a thin avenue of poplars completely blackened and withered by the
  continual smoke.</p>

  <p>"This is your home, Marie," said M. Lafarge, gripping his wife's shoulders
  and passing her into the arms of two drab-looking women waiting at the gate
  under a large cotton umbrella that dripped rain from bent ribs.</p>

  <p>Marie at first took these to be two servants, but to her utter dismay
  realised that they were her mother-in-law and sister-in-law; they embraced
  her and took her into the house, chattering all the time in a patois that she
  could scarcely understand and could scarcely bring herself to answer; they
  also stared at her with a curiosity they did not try to disguise.</p>

  <p>Thus, broken by fatigue, soaked with rain, agitated by disappointment and
  apprehension, Marie Lafarge entered Glandier. The steps that led to the front
  door were of worn dirty stone, she noticed; from the choked gutter of the
  roof a spout of fouled rain-water fell on the handrail; the <i>Parisienne</i>
  glanced round in despair. There was no garden, only a waste of neglected
  ground heaped with rubbish and broken crocks.</p>

  <p>Following the two women, she entered what they termed the <i>salon</i>,
  and there she sank on to the first chair she met and gazed about, too
  stupefied to speak. Her mother-in-law held one of her hands and continued to
  stare at her with great curiosity; her sister-in-law stood in front of her
  plying her with questions, which Marie could not even hear, much less
  answer.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge <i>mère</i> possessed what would have passed in Paris for the
  appearance of an upper servant or housekeeper; her plain black dress of
  serviceable cloth was covered with a large working apron by no means
  spotless; her hair, which had been of a reddish brown, was streaked with grey
  and bandaged severely over her ears; a large brooch of twisted gold fastened
  the once white tucker at her thin neck She was sixty-three years of age and
  might easily have claimed the dignity of another decade, so little trouble
  had she taken to preserve her figure, her complexion or any of the few charms
  she had possibly once possessed; her hands bore witness to her incessant
  domestic labours, her face was grimed by smoke and ash dust and about her
  person was the stale greasy odour associated pith an ill-kept kitchen.</p>

  <p>Mme. Buffière was a little woman with a fresh, rosy complexion, but with a
  common air and quick, incessant, vulgar movements; she too wore drab clothes
  and had entirely neglected her person.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge joined this touching family scene and, seating himself near to
  Marie, tried to draw her on his knees; when she rebuffed him, he said with a
  wink and a coarse laugh to the other two women "that his little wife would
  only caress him when they were alone together," and, addressing Marie as a
  dear little puppy, he pinched her nose, kissed her cheeks and pulled her
  towards him by clasping her round the waist; the bride trembled with
  indignation at these brutal caresses.</p>

  <p>"I am neither a cat nor a puppy," she said under her breath; she put her
  hand to her throat and made an effort to choke back a violent scream of
  despair. "I am very tired, you must let me go to my room. I have some letters
  to write."</p>

  <p>The other two women exchanged glances; M. Lafarge shrugged his shoulders
  and made a little sign as much as to say, "We must put up with a little more
  of this," and his mother without a word conducted her daughter-in-law up the
  dirty staircase to her bedchamber.</p>

  <p>Stepping daintily and with looks of disdain, Clementine, laden with
  valises and hat-boxes, staggering on her high heels on the greasy stone,
  followed.</p>

  <p>The bedchamber assigned to Mme. Lafarge was directly over the <i>salon</i>
  and of the same size. It was unfurnished save for two iron beds, a rickety
  table and four wooden chairs, which seemed to wander in the solitude like
  Bedouins in the desert.</p>

  <p>"Clementine!" exclaimed Mme. Lafarge, gazing round her in genuine
  panic-terror. "Bring me some paper and ink."</p>

  <p>The chambermaid tripped away and presently with a grimace of sympathy and
  disdain brought in a broken jam-jar, in which a scrap of cotton floated in
  some grey water, an old broken pen and some squares of sky-blue paper.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Madame?" exclaimed Clementine, alarmed by her
  mistress's looks of frenzy.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Clementine. Indeed, I don't know."</p>

  <p>Marie flung off the bonnet with the drenched feather, the fine cashmere
  shawl with the damp fringe, on which the beads of moisture glistened. She did
  not move while the chambermaid went on her knees and unlaced her wet
  sandals.</p>

  <p>"You will be ill, you will catch a fever," cried the girl with concern.
  "Oh, this dreadful, dreadful place!"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Clementine, hush! I have been most terribly deceived. Is this
  Glandier, this the <i>château</i> I was promised? That vulgar woman my
  mother-in-law, that common girl my sister-in-law? And he, not only my
  husband, but my master? What shall I do? <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what shall I
  do?"</p>

  <p>She gripped the girl's shoulders and stared at her with an intensity of
  genuine horror and alarm.</p>

  <p>"I never liked him," said Clementine. "What was M. de Martens thinking of
  to marry you to that odious man?"</p>

  <p>"They were all tired of me, Clementine. I have been difficult and
  capricious too long. They thought I should be an old maid."</p>

  <p>"Better to be an old maid in Paris than a married woman here," said
  Clementine. "There is nothing, nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Are there no servants?"</p>

  <p>"There are one or two peasants in the kitchen, which is an abominable
  place. Mme. Lafarge, your mother-in-law, keeps the turkeys and fowls they are
  going to eat in her bedroom to fatten. The factory is close on to the house,
  so are the hovels where the workers live."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that. And this smoke, this will always continue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Clementine. "You can see, the factory chimneys are right
  against the house. This black smoke blows across everything. There is no
  garden, only a wilderness."</p>

  <p>"The river that seemed so charming?" stammered Mme. Lafarge.</p>

  <p>The <i>grisette</i> shrugged her shoulders. "They use that as water power
  for the factory. It is all fouled."</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Clementine, I can bear no more! We are a hundred leagues
  from Paris!"</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge, with a frantic effort over her failing strength, rose and
  went to the window. The rain was descending, it was nothing less than a
  deluge; thickened by the fumes from the factory smoke it blotted out
  everything, trees, river, neglected garden. Nothing could have been in more
  bitter contrast to Marie's dreams than the prospect on which she gazed.</p>

  <p>She sat down at the rickety table, seized the broken pen, and dipping it
  in the ink rendered pale with vinegar, began to write on the sheets of
  sky-blue paper that Clementine had brought her. Her facility, her gift of
  throwing extravagant sentiments into words, served her well. She became
  inspired with her theme, and covered the page with her nervous, flowing
  handwriting on each side.</p>

  <p class="letter">Glandier, Aug. 15th, 1839.<br>
  <br>
  Charles, on my knees I ask your pardon. I have most unworthily deceived you,
  for I do not love you and I love another. Mon Dieu, how I have suffered! Let
  me die, you whom I esteem with all my heart. Bid me die, and I will thank
  you, and to-morrow I shall exist no more. I feel as if my head was broken.
  Will you help me? For pity's sake, listen to me! listen to me!<br>
  <br>
  He also is named Charles; he is handsome, he is noble, he has been educated
  near me. We loved each other before we knew what love was. A year ago another
  woman robbed me of his heart, I believed that I should have died of this. In
  despair I decided to marry you.<br>
  <br>
  Alas, I knew nothing of the mysteries of marriage! Even the touch of your
  hand caused me to tremble, unhappy woman that I am! I believed that all I
  should owe you would be a kiss on the forehead, that you would be to me like
  a father.<br>
  <br>
  Can you understand how I have suffered during the three days since we left
  Paris? Can you understand that if you do not save me I shall have to die?
  Wait, I will tell you everything.<br>
  <br>
  I esteem you with all my soul, I venerate you; but our habits, our education,
  have put between us an immense barrier. Everything you say and do, the way
  you try to express your heart and spirit, raises nothing but revulsion in me.
  Besides, he repents. I have seen him at Orleans. You were at dinner; he was
  on the balcony close to mine. He is here even, hidden at Uzerche. I shall
  become an unfaithful wife, an adulteress, despite you, despite myself, if you
  do not save me.<br>
  <br>
  Charles, whom I have offended so horribly, save me from yourself and from
  him. This evening tell me that you will consent, have ready for me two horses
  to take the road to Brives. I will then take the post coach to Bordeaux,
  where I shall embark for Smyrna. I will leave you my fortune. God will permit
  that it brings you prosperity, for you deserve it. As for myself, I shall
  live on what I can earn by my work or by my lessons.<br>
  <br>
  I pray you never to let anyone know that I still exist. If you wish I will
  throw my mantle on the edge of one of your precipices, and all will be
  finished. If you wish I will take some arsenic&mdash;I have it. All will be
  thus ended.<br>
  <br>
  You have been so good that I can, in refusing you my affection, give you my
  life; but to receive your caresses, no, never!<br>
  <br>
  In the name of the honour of your mother do not refuse me, in the name of God
  pardon me. I await your reply as a criminal awaits his arrest. Ah, if I did
  not love him more than life, I might, because I esteem you, be able to love
  you&mdash;but as it is, your caresses revolt me. Tell me I merit pardon.
  Meanwhile my sole hope is in you. Put a paper under my door this evening; if
  not, by tomorrow morning I shall be dead.<br>
  <br>
  Do not concern yourself about me. I shall go on foot to Brives if it must be.
  I will never rest here, your mother so tender, your sister so
  gentle&mdash;all that overwhelms me. I am horrified at myself. Oh, be
  generous, save me from killing myself. To whom am I to confide if not to you?
  Shall I address myself to him, never! If I cannot belong to you, I shall not
  belong to him. These affections will be the cause of my death. Be a man! If
  you do not still love me, pardon me.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the trace of the horses would be discovered. Give me two dirty
  costumes belonging to your peasants. Pardon, may God recompense you for the
  evil that I have done you.<br>
  <br>
  I shall take with me only some little trinkets belonging to my friends as
  souvenirs. As for the rest of what I have, you can send it to me at Bordeaux,
  if you care to, but everything will be yours. Do not accuse me of falsity.
  Since Monday, since the hour when I learnt you would be something other than
  a brother, since my aunts tried to tell me what it meant to give oneself to a
  man, I swore to die. I took some poison, a little dose at Orleans. Yesterday
  I vomited. I have a little pistol, 'tis loaded; I held it against my head
  when I was alone in the carriage; I thought that with every jolt it would go
  of and kill me.<br>
  <br>
  To-day everything depends on you. I shall retract nothing. Save me, be the
  good angel of the poor orphan, or kill her, or tell her to kill herself.
  Write to me, for without your word of honour&mdash;and I believe in
  you&mdash;without this written word of honour, I shall not open my door.<br>
  <br>
  Marie.</p>

  <p>This frantic epistle sealed with the dainty paraphernalia that had been
  one of Marie's wedding presents, the bride prepared to put through the
  evening in this terrible house, in this horrible company. Even in her
  despair, which was, despite her habitual duplicity and hypocrisy, genuine,
  she had some consolation. A glance in her hand-mirror had told her that she
  was romantically pale&mdash;"white as a phantom," as she expressed it
  herself&mdash;and that her appearance in her elegant Parisian robe shone
  against this unsupportable background like a lily against a refuse heap.</p>

  <p>There was another consolation, too, in the ardent devotion of Clé, who
  seemed perfectly ready to play the part of confidential maid or
  <i>confidente</i>, one of those devoted, bold, intriguing creatures without
  whom no heroine of romance was complete.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge, hardly speaking, refusing to touch either the food or wine
  that was put before her, passed what seemed to her an interminable evening in
  the long, gaunt dining-room of Glandier. Several of her marriage relations
  were gathered round the board, which was loaded with coarse, badly-cooked
  food and lit by a small, continually smoking oil lamp with an opal glass
  shade.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge did not see these people distinctly; their coarse,
  provincial faces, their uncouth, provincial clothes were blurred to her in
  one phantasmagoria of horror; nor did she even try to understand their
  Limousin patois as they discussed with one another their domestic and
  business affairs.</p>

  <p>Without waiting to take leave of anyone, and giving her inevitable excuse
  of fatigue and a headache, she rose. Her husband was soon also on his feet
  and offered to accompany her; Marie begged in accents of terror for a few
  moments alone in her chamber; she heard the coarse laughter going up from the
  guests; she noted with a tremor of disgust that the men had not risen when
  she had left the table, but continued to eat and drink with very little
  regard for her presence.</p>

  <p>She ran upstairs; the faithful Clementine was waiting for her. "Take him
  the note&mdash;now, at once. Then come back. I am going to lock the
  door."</p>

  <p>The little <i>grisette</i>, who also felt cheated and trapped at finding
  herself in such a place and who was sincerely devoted to her mistress,
  thoroughly enjoyed the important part assigned to her in this dramatic
  incident.</p>

  <p>She soon returned, saying that she had slipped the sky-blue note to M.
  Lafarge, who had received it with a leer.</p>

  <p>The gaunt, unfurnished bedroom littered with the elegant Parisian
  bandboxes, valises and packages, was lit only by a half tallow candle in a
  pewter stick, which had been given to Clementine by the elder Mme. Lafarge.
  By this sickly light the two women waited, Clementine on guard by the locked
  door, Marie Lafarge on her knees by one of the iron beds, her face in her
  hands, her slender body shaken by sobs.</p>

  <p>"Here he is," cried the chamber-woman excitedly.</p>

  <p>There were heavy steps on the stairs outside, heavy blows on the door, and
  the harsh voice of M. Lafarge raised in oaths, expostulations, exclamations,
  and threats to force the lock.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Open the door," she said to Clementine, and moved against the window, at
  the same instant unlatching it on to the night. She remembered the similar
  action of Rebecca in <i>Ivanhoe</i> when the wicked Crusader pestered her
  with his unwanted attentions; she found, even in her distress, a pleasure in
  imitating this heroine of romance.</p>

  <p>The young ironmaster entered the room; anger, wine and agitation had
  distorted his coarse features; he spoke from his heart, bitterly, hurriedly,
  forgetting the careful French that he usually employed when in Paris or among
  distinguished strangers, mingling his speech with patois and words peculiar
  to the Limousin.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand, you little fool, that you belong to me? What does
  this outrageous behaviour mean? You shan't go, you can't leave my house. Why
  do you think I married you? I've need of a wife, I haven't enough money to
  buy a mistress. You belong to me before the law&mdash;I tell you you shan't
  go. Come along, no more of this nonsense."</p>

  <p>He advanced towards her and Marie withdrew still farther against the open
  window, declaring coldly that, if he as much as touched her, she would throw
  herself out.</p>

  <p>Seeing her so energetically desperate, Charles Lafarge withdrew, and,
  standing in the doorway, shouted for his mother and sister, who came running
  in, weeping and screaming and imploring this haughty and incomprehensible
  stranger "to have mercy on their poor Charles."</p>

  <p>The scene now became a frightful confusion; the four women, for Clementine
  added her part, all spoke at once, mingling protests, sobs, exclamations,
  high-flown talk of honour, courage and despair, with apologies for the state
  of the house and the rooms on the part of the elder Mme. Lafarge and her
  daughter, demands for fresh linen and coverlets that she might make up the
  bed from Clementine, and sighs for a cup of China tea from the half frantic
  bride.</p>

  <p>Finally, urged on by his mother, M. Lafarge threw himself on his knees
  before his wife, demanding pardon; he was by now almost in hysterics
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I have," he sobbed, "deceived you. This is not the place that I painted
  it in Paris! But, my beautiful Marie, I loved you so much that I had, at any
  price, to obtain you!"</p>

  <p>"As for the house," put in the elder Mme. Lafarge, wiping her eyes with
  the corner of her dirty apron, "it is not, my dear child, as bad as you
  think. No doubt you are homesick and miss all your pretty elegances and all
  your fine friends, but I assure you once the sun shines the country is really
  very pretty round here. Besides, if you don't like the house, you can alter
  it&mdash;you will be the absolute mistress."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Charles Lafarge. "You will be the queen here,
  everything shall be according to your tastes. I have bought you a
  <i>briska</i>, I have bought you a piano, I have promised you a bathroom.
  To-morrow the masons and carpenters will arrive and everything shall be as
  you wish."</p>

  <p>All this flattery was very familiar language to Marie Lafarge; it consoled
  her and she began to dry her tears, too, on her elegant, lace-embroidered
  handkerchief. She was very used, after she had made a scene, to being petted,
  pampered, caressed and coaxed into good temper, and she knew how to take
  advantage of this kind of concession. She did not, however, at once give in;
  standing still beside the open window, pale and dignified, she declared that
  she could easily pardon everything, even the odious lies of which she had
  been the victim, that she would abandon her dowry without regret, that she
  would keep pure and honourable the name she had accepted, "but never, never,"
  she added with a sincerity that overrode the conventional hypocrisy of her
  words, "can I remain here. I must go away, far, far away, and if you force me
  to stay I shall kill myself."</p>

  <p>Her sister-in-law, Mme. Buffière, then approached her, put her arms round
  her kindly and began to caress her; at this Marie's courage gave way; she was
  really fatigued, forlorn, frightened and consumed as with a flame by
  nostalgia.</p>

  <p>Sobbing on her sister-in-law's shoulder she began to stammer out the story
  of the scene at Orleans when her husband had tried to force his way into her
  room when she was in the bath; Mme. Buffière then obtained from her the
  admission that there was no lover, that she had no arsenic and no pistol in
  her possession, though she had a little phial of laudanum, which the family
  doctor allowed her to use when she had violent, nervous headaches.</p>

  <p>Having obtained this information Mme. Buffière drew her agitated brother
  into a corner of the room, where she had a long, whispered, animated
  conversation with him. Meanwhile, the elder Mme. Lafarge tried to comfort
  poor Marie, telling her that she was proud of her, that she thought her
  beautiful, elegant and charming, that the house should be made worthy of her,
  that her son's rude manners must be excused because he was so madly in love
  with his exquisite bride, that the whole house should be turned upside-down
  to please her if she would but consent to remain, and then in accents that
  sincerity made moving, the old woman explained the terrible scandal that
  Marie's departure would make in the neighbourhood, the confusion into which
  it would throw the affairs of the Lafarge family and the impossible position
  Marie herself would be in in the future.</p>

  <p>Considerably calmed, but not yet prepared to give way, Marie repeated that
  her husband could keep her dowry but that she must leave Glandier and the
  family Lafarge.</p>

  <p>Her husband then came forward from the corner where he had been conversing
  with his sister; his manner was much more calm.</p>

  <p>He explained, in a matter-of-fact way, that it would be impossible for him
  to keep Marie's dowry without her family's consent. He declared, with an air
  of generosity, that he had no wish to keep his wife near him against her
  will&mdash;he only begged for two or three days in which to obtain her
  pardon, to prove his love and to render her happy, as he put it. If at the
  end of that time she still wished to leave Glandier, she might, but not he
  hoped for such an outlandish place as Smyrna, but rather for Paris, where no
  doubt her relatives would receive her with open arms.</p>

  <p>Marie was pleased with this homage, moved by the tears and agitation of
  these three people, and not uninfluenced by Clementine's whispered advice:
  "Accept, Madame, accept. You have brought them all to your knees, you have
  won a victory."</p>

  <p>The words "return to Paris" had a little brought Marie to her senses; she
  knew with that shrewdness and sense of irony which penetrated all her romance
  and hypocrisy that her aunts and uncles, even her friends, would not be very
  pleased to see her again. There would be scenes, reproaches, trouble over her
  dowry, some of her friends would smile, others mock; she would be really in a
  very ridiculous position. Besides, fatigue was falling over her like a leaden
  veil; her knees trembled beneath her; she sank on one of the iron beds and
  said faintly:</p>

  <p>"Very well, Charles, I will stay for a few days at least, as long as you
  consent to treat me like a sister."</p>

  <p>The young ironmaster eagerly accepted this concession. Mme. Buffière
  offered to share her room in order to protect her against any possible
  ardours on the part of her husband; this favour Mme. Lafarge faintly refused;
  she said that she would keep Clementine to sleep with her every night.</p>

  <p>This painful and violent scene brought on an attack of nerves; for an hour
  the young woman lay on the mean iron bed unconscious in her Parisian finery.
  Her new relatives watched her half through the night, fearing that she had,
  after all, taken poison; but finally, upon Clementine's insisting that such
  attacks were usual in a lady of Madame's delicate physique, that she would be
  herself after a little repose, the confused, dismayed and bewildered Lafarge
  family left the <i>grisette</i> and her mistress to the heavy slumbers of
  exhaustion.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When, late in the morning, the bride woke, she sent Clementine to ask news
  of the family. Her husband, it seemed, was ill and forced to keep his bed; he
  too had indulged in a <i>crise de nerfs</i>.</p>

  <p>"I must remember my promise, Clementine, and try to endure this life for a
  few days."</p>

  <p>Marie put on a charming morning <i>toilette</i> of muslin with a blue
  ribbon girded round her waist, and went downstairs to <i>déjeuner</i>. She
  met there the persons who had been presented to her the night before and a
  friend of the family, an old advocate of the name of Chauveron, whose courtly
  manners and dignified discourse did something to restore the bride to
  equanimity.</p>

  <p>As soon as the meal was over she was presented to a new arrival, a M.
  Pontier, a doctor at Uzerche, another brother of Mme. Lafarge, and uncle of
  Charles Lafarge. He was a man of forty years of age, with a noble,
  intelligent appearance and a manner far more polished than that of the other
  provincials.</p>

  <p>Marie felt that this man was her friend, and when, pressing her hand, he
  drew her apart, she went with him willingly. The shrewd doctor knew how to
  manage the romantic and impressionable young woman.</p>

  <p>The day was fine; even the heavy factory smoke could not totally obscure
  the superb prospect&mdash;the river, the sloping hills, the forests of oak,
  the gardens, which, though neglected, showed rich lawns and clusters of
  half-wild bushes and flowers.</p>

  <p>Leading Marie through the ruins of the old Carthusian abbey, which was
  feudal enough and Gothic enough to please even her taste, he told her their
  origin, their history, their legend, then glided into a touching picture of
  the love that was waiting for Marie in her new family and told her of the
  happiness that she herself perhaps would not enjoy but that she might scatter
  radiantly about her. Cautiously, delicately, and insinuating wherever it was
  possible subtle flattery, M. Pontier spoke of his nephew.</p>

  <p>"He is, of course, an uncultured, rude, even savage young man, wild, but
  if I may say so, grand like his own mountains. He has never been taught
  anything but work and business. He is not, perhaps, highly intelligent, but
  he has plenty of good sense."</p>

  <p>Then M. Pontier pointed out how deeply his nephew loved his bride; he
  declared that no feelings of interest had entered into this union, that the
  bridegroom was heart-broken over the scene of the night before and would do
  anything to please his Marie.</p>

  <p>Comforted by this conversation and reassured by the friendship of the
  dignified doctor, re-established in her own importance, Marie paid a visit to
  the invalid, who was installed in the room next the nuptial chamber and who
  showed himself so grateful for this concession that she was even more
  softened towards him, though she tried not to look at him in his cotton
  night-cap.</p>

  <p>He asked her faintly if she had seen over his factories; and she replied
  "no"; she was waiting for his recovery in order that he might himself explain
  to her the works of which she understood nothing at all, then slipped away
  with a dignified coquetry.</p>

  <p>During the rest of the day she felt calm, almost as if she had forgotten
  her frightful despair of the evening before. The place certainly looked much
  better by daylight, and everybody was so touchingly eager to make her happy,
  the women almost obsequious; she was treated as if she were indeed a superior
  being; if she smiled everyone seemed happy, if she was silent, everyone
  downcast! all in their different ways hurried to do her little services.</p>

  <p>Clementine told her that she had been summoned to M. Lafarge's bedside and
  that he had there confided to the <i>grisette</i> his desperate and
  passionate love for her mistress, that he was willing to surround her with
  all kinds of care and affectionate regards, if only she would remain in his
  house.</p>

  <p>Marie felt distinctly soothed by all this attention; the situation after
  all had something in it of romance; she began to cast back, as usual, into
  the novels she had read, the poetry and romances she had devoured and
  composed. Was there not in one of the novels of George Sand such a situation,
  when a rude, wild, half-savage young man had been tamed by the grace and
  beauty of an elegant young woman, and after a long apprenticeship of years of
  tender devotion been granted her love?</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge's message, brought back by Clementine, was that if she did not
  like the house, she could pull it down and rebuild it according to her
  tastes, that at any time she liked to give the command the workmen would be
  ready to obey her orders.</p>

  <p>Marie began to dream of those Gothic cloisters that M. Pontier had shown
  her, of the old monkish garths, of the ruins of the church. Could not these
  be restored and joined to the mansion, which, in its turn, might be entirely
  altered? Could she not have furniture sent, not only from Uzerche or Brives,
  but from Paris?</p>

  <p>As for what she lacked in her own chamber, M. Lafarge had assured her that
  if she would only make a list of the first necessities, they would be sent by
  express from Uzerche, and in a day or so she might have everything she
  wished. She could also send immediately to her aunt, Mme. Garat, in Paris,
  for a civilised servant. That night Marie, soothed and exhausted, slept as
  sound as if the frantic letter on the sky-blue paper had never been
  written.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The next morning M. Lafarge had recovered. The weather was fine and Marie
  quite enioyed her visit to the factory, where she was received by the
  ironworkers with a touching enthusiasm. Seeing her husband as the undisputed
  master and controller of these men raised him in her estimation; here on his
  own ground he appeared composed, dignified, easy, in direct contrast to his
  incorrect, embarrassed manner in a lady's drawing-room.</p>

    <p class="caption">A Ride in the Forest<br>
    From an old engraving in possession of the author.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Marie, who enjoyed being gracious, shared the midday meal of the
  ironworkers, and begged her husband to add to this repast of coarse soup and
  black bread a little fruit and wine, in which she drank their health and they
  drank hers. She was presented with a crown of fresh green leaves to place
  round her wide straw hat, and on leaving the factory she found a may-pole had
  been arranged in the courtyard; this, decorated with garlands of flowers and
  tricolour ribbons, served as the centre round which peasants in the costumes
  of the Limousin were dancing to the music of a solitary musician who was
  playing his <i>musette</i> in a corner.</p>

  <p>Marie thought of Venus deigning to visit Vulcan and his workmen in the
  heart of the mountain and became somewhat reconciled to her position. After
  all it was not so contemptible a destiny to be adored by so many worthy if
  rude people.</p>

  <p>When, pleasantly fatigued and feeling a delicious lassitude from the heat
  of the day, she allowed M. Lafarge to row her back on the little river that
  twisted round the works to the <i>château</i> she closed her eyes, and
  trailing her fingers in the water, began to make a romance of her present
  circumstances. She would alter everything, the house, the gardens, the way of
  living, the servants; there would be no trouble with her mother-in-law and
  sister-in-law&mdash;these two women were, she could see, only too eager to be
  at her service. Old Mme. Lafarge could continue the burden of the
  housekeeping once she had learnt Marie's Parisian ways. Mme. Buffière, if she
  was to live permanently at Glandier&mdash;and Marie meant to avoid that if
  she could&mdash;would willingly slip into a position not much above that of
  Clementine's, the respectful <i>confidente</i>. The two uncles Pontier were
  already, Marie knew, her devoted friends; they had been dazzled by her
  beauty, her brilliancy, her social rank. As to her young lord and master, as
  she was pleased to call him to herself, she believed that she had him now
  completely in her power; he was not likely to offend any more by intrusions
  upon her privacy or brutal caresses of her in public. She liked the situation
  she had created for herself, the outer status of a married woman, the inner
  virginal life of a <i>demoiselle</i> in a convent.</p>

  <p>Charles Lafarge was no doubt ugly, coarse and rough, but he was manly,
  masterful, and, as she believed, desperately in love with her. A subtle and
  fascinating game could be played with such material; she would see to it that
  he kept to his bargain of treating her as his sister; at the same time she
  would exercise on him a thbusand delicate coquetries&mdash;advance, retreat,
  advance, retreat, twisting him this way and that, affording him a little
  hope, casting him into despair, according as her mood changed. She would make
  him alter, she had already decided, everything, then when she had changed the
  man, his surroundings, his relatives and his life to suit her own fastidious
  tastes, she might perhaps accord him the supreme honour of consenting to live
  with him as his wife. By then no doubt he would be making the revenue of
  100,000 francs a year of which he had spoken in Paris.</p>

  <p>Marie sighed and opened her eyes on to the sunset as the boat touched the
  neglected lawn of Glandier. The future, after all, did not look so hopelessly
  dark.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-06"
     id="ch-03-06"></a>6. THE TRAGEDY AT GLANDIER</h3>

  <p>Marie Lafarge looked round her sad little domain, as she termed it, and at
  once began to plan vast changes. The household, being still afraid of her and
  eager to do anything that might prevent her leaving them, willingly gathered
  in a little conclave, where she explained her intentions.</p>

  <p>She had already made an inspection of the dismal little <i>château</i> and
  the neglected grounds; the entrance passage and the great <i>salons</i>,
  which the elder Mme. Lafarge had always kept shut up save on rare occasions
  of festival or entertainment, particularly aroused Marie Lafarge's horror and
  disgust. In her opinion it expressed "a vivid vulgarity that would soon
  overwhelm all the thoughts of anyone who tried to live in these dismal
  surroundings." The walls were covered with a hideous yellow paper, much
  stained by damp and age; in one wall were two windows, in the opposite an
  alcove; all three were furnished with red cotton draperies with yellow
  fringes. On a large walnut <i>commode</i> was draped a floor carpet with a
  crude design of two shapeless doves dangling in knots of ribbon against a
  sky-blue background. There was no covering on the boarded floor; the
  chimney-piece, which framed a coarse iron grate, was ornamented with five
  monstrous china oranges, two soiled white candles in brass sticks, which had
  never been lit, and a large white glass night-light-holder with a design of
  "<i>Adam and Eve</i>," who were, as Marie Cappelle remarked, "without sin but
  also without fig-leaves"; two coarsely-executed colour-prints showing a pair
  of young lovers, a Greek and an Albanian, were hung carelessly on the dismal
  yellow paper. The rest of the furniture consisted of two arm-chairs covered
  in worn, red Utrecht velvet and some other chairs with straw seats arranged
  against the wall. In this unfortunate <i>salon</i> there were two doors
  painted a dull grey and two more with the upper portion in glass.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge, who had seen his wife's horrified and disdainful glance round
  this apartment, began to talk hastily of plans and projects for renovating
  and altering the building.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge then spoke. Glancing at her husband, her mother-in-law, her
  sister-in-law and brother-in-law, she proceeded to state what she intended
  doing.</p>

  <p>"I must have, you understand, elegant and pleasant surroundings. I advise
  you to transform this great room into a bedchamber, with bathrooms and
  <i>toilette</i> closets. It must, of course, be entirely repainted, repapered
  and refurnished, and the windows must be altered. Then, as for your entrance
  corridor, so horribly sinister, it could be turned into an open gallery lit
  by gracious and elegant ogive windows and paved with white tiles. Then that
  frightful desert, without doors or windows, which you call the kitchen, has
  fine enough proportions to allow it to be metamorphosed into a great Gothic
  <i>salon</i>, with massive doors hung with tapestry and set with statues. To
  the right of that are several little rooms, which could easily be knocked
  into one fine dining-room. The little <i>salon</i> to the left, which you do
  not seem to use at all, could be turned into a workroom or boudoir for me,
  where I can employ my solitary hours with books, pen, the piano."</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge listened with stupefaction to this plan of drastic
  alterations to her house and seemed to think that her new daughter-in-law was
  a little crazy. Mme. Buffière laughed and asked sarcastically if it was a
  custom among the Parisian girls thus to alter the houses into which they came
  on their marriage? But M. Lafarge accepted all his wife's plans and told her
  that she should immediately have a master-mason and some workmen at her
  entire disposal.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The races at Pompadour, which had been the cause for hurrying on Marie
  Lafarge's marriage, took place on the following day. The bride was too
  fatigued to go. While her husband escorted his mother and sister to Pompadour
  she remained at home trying over the piano, which had arrived from Uzerche,
  and which, despite the jolts of its journey of a hundred leagues, was not in
  the least damaged, and gave off brilliant and sonorous notes, which rejoiced
  the exiled <i>Parisienne</i>.</p>

  <p>The trunks with the elaborate trousseau also arrived, and the ladies of
  the household took an infantile delight in emptying and in turning over the
  novelties from the city that they contained.</p>

  <p>The following days consisted of rounds of visits paid and received.
  Clementine took great pride in making her mistress as elegant as possible and
  in seeing her astonish the provincials with the superb elegance of her simple
  <i>toilette</i>, usually of fine white muslin. Her dark hair was caught up
  with golden pins and gracefully arranged by the expert <i>grisette</i>. M.
  Lafarge, doing all in his power to please his romantic and capricious young
  wife, sent her every morning a spray of wild flowers from the woods beyond
  the river&mdash;these, in the evenings when she made her appearance at the
  family dinner table, were coquettishly entwined in her ebony locks; she thus
  wore now a delicious branch of foxglove, now honeysuckle, sometimes a spray
  of heather or of fern, and occasionally she allowed her husband respectfully
  to kiss the brow that he had thus adorned.</p>

  <p>Everything that the family Lafarge could do to please their difficult,
  charming and delicate young relation was done; there were picnics on the
  banks of the river, there were continual visits to the forge to see the
  display "as fine as fireworks" of the sparks rising from the great furnaces,
  there were rides in the woods; a handsome grey horse of the name of Arabska
  was presented by M. Lafarge to his wife, and she was allowed to take,
  sometimes alone, sometimes with him, long rides through the mountain passes
  and ravines and to return with baskets full of wild flowers and plants
  hanging to her saddle; trails of wild hops, of briony, of honeysuckle, and
  briar were brought in by Marie Lafarge to adorn the <i>salons</i>, in which,
  as the time went by, she began to effect considerable improvements.</p>

  <p>The work of altering Glandier, however, went on slowly; neither the
  masons, who under her direction were digging round the ruins of the ancient
  monastery, nor the gardeners, who were endeavouring to restore order to the
  neglected ground, made much progress, and the summer passed before Marie
  Lafarge had realised her dreams of Gothic <i>salons</i>, open cloisters,
  fountains, terraces planted with orange and arbutus trees and parterres
  filled with delicious flowers. She had, however, most of the broken windows
  mended and locks put on most of the swinging doors; she had the carpet with
  the doves taken from the <i>commode</i> and laid on the floor; she had
  cobwebs swept away and a wash of white paint put over the hideous yellow
  paper and the coarse grey colour of the doors; the fine china oranges and
  "<i>Adam and Eve</i>" had been banished to the attics.</p>

  <p>From Paris were sent several articles that were, as she declared, the
  first necessities&mdash;a bath, several oil lamps, a respectable dinner
  service, some linen for table and bed, a hundred other domestic utensils,
  and, most valuable of all, two good servants, a cook named Mion, and Alfred,
  a young man who was the son of the old coachman at Villers-Hellon.</p>

  <p>With the support of these allies and helped by Clementine, Marie Lafarge
  entirely altered the government of the house; her mother-in-law had, with
  same petulance, offered her the domestic keys, saying that "she had ruled the
  establishment for forty years with order and economy." The younger woman had
  refused to take this symbol of authority, but the elder had insisted; the
  result of this dispute, insincere on both sides, was a dangerous divided
  authority. Duplicate keys were made, and each woman had an undefined
  power.</p>

  <p>Mme. Marie Lafarge, supported by the three Parisian servants, had the
  house cleaned from top to bottom, all the rubbish swept away, all the faded,
  dirty draperies taken down, clean muslin curtains put up at the windows and
  in the alcove, the tiled floor polished till it shone, all the atrocious
  ornaments and detestable pictures removed, the windows set open to the light
  and air and pots and branches of fresh flowers placed in every chamber.</p>

  <p>These drastic changes caused a revolution among the retainers of old Mme.
  Lafarge&mdash;gross peasants, who had been allowed to do much as they liked
  for years. Their last stronghold was the kitchen, and Marie Lafarge and her
  allies found it almost impossible to effect any changes in this hideous
  apartment where the servants' children squealed in dirty cradles, pigs and
  poultry, whose carcasses were designed for the table, wandered at will over
  the floor&mdash;cocks and hens perching even on the tables and
  chairs&mdash;where rank-smelling cheeses hung from one corner and turkeys
  being fattened occupied another enclosed in a filthy pen in foul straw.</p>

  <p>A series of domestic upsets ended in the giving of notice by the servants
  who had been in the employ of old Mme. Lafarge; and the younger woman
  recruited from the neighbourhood some girls who were willing to work under
  the Parisian servants. After this there was some peace and quiet in Glandier,
  and the elder woman, shocked, astonished and outraged, was silenced but not
  defeated. She still affected to love, admire and caress her daughter-in-law,
  and did all in her power to soothe and flatter her, but there were occasions
  when what she considered the incomprehensible and outrageous changes in her
  establishment were more than she could bear, and when, in suppressed fury,
  she would retire to her own chamber. This was a replica of the kitchen; in
  one corner cheeses ripened, in another poultry were being fattened; some
  sucking pigs, destined for an approaching feast-day, lapped milk in the
  chimney corner; a hundred and one pots, saucepans, cooking appliances, dried
  meats, herbs, preserves, sauces, stood on shelves and round the floor. In the
  midst of this culinary confusion stood the old woman's bed, heavily curtained
  with drugget and piled with dirty coverlets. These were never changed, nor
  did Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> allow anyone to enter her room even to sweep
  it out. It was her own sanctum, most jealously guarded, and when she left it
  she locked it and kept the key in her pocket.</p>

  <p>This formidable person was a very plain woman, who had had an exceedingly
  unhappy married life. Her husband had been openly unfaithful to her and had
  died with shocking suddenness one day at table, after eating a quantity of
  nougat sent him by a so-called friend; Madame Lafarge had always bitterly
  declared that this nougat had been poisoned and that her husband's death was
  the work of an enemy; the doctors, however, had laughed at this hysterical
  exaggeration, as they termed it, and declared that M. Lafarge had departed
  this life through injudicious living that had brought on apoplexy.</p>

  <p>Since this gloomy event, over which she constantly brooded, Madame Lafarge
  had never changed from her widow's weeds; she wore the most sober of black
  clothes, full skirt, plain bonnet and cashmere shawl; nor did she change
  these at night, merely, when she lay down on her bed, turning her shawl
  inside out and putting it back again when she rose in the morning.</p>

  <p>One of Marie Lafarge's chief complaints about the <i>régime</i> of
  Glandier was the vast amount of food eaten; her delicate stomach was sickened
  by the numerous coarse dishes that were placed on the table at every meal,
  and there were four meals each day. With her ironic wit, so displeasing to
  the vain and downright provincials, she declared that each meal was a
  "massacre of the innocents," since dozens of birds and animals had to be
  slain in order to provide it, and she added that it seemed as if the
  different portions of a lamb's carcass had made a <i>rendez-vous</i> on the
  dinner table at Glandier, for there would be six or seven different dishes
  all composed of portions of the same animal.</p>

  <p>After she had her new life well in train Marie Lafarge reformed this gross
  feeding; the result was many a bitter battle with her mother-in-law, who did
  not appreciate the elegant table with spotless napery, gleaming silver, vases
  of flowers and one or two well-cooked and excellently served dishes that
  Marie offered to her guests.</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge thought that this manner of housekeeping disgraced
  herself and her son, and Charles Lafarge was appealed to by both the women;
  Marie won, but at the price of increasing the rage and hatred the elder woman
  felt for her person and her ways.</p>

  <p>After she had been a few weeks at Glandier she was relieved by the
  departure of her sister and brother-in-law, Monsieur and Madame Buffière, for
  another factory where M. Buffière had found employment. There had been no
  love between the two women, and Mme. Charles made no pretence of missing her
  sister-in-law.</p>

  <p>A great deal of her time was taken up with visits in the neighbourhood;
  the Lafarge family knew everyone and there was a vast curiosity to see the
  outlandish <i>Parisienne</i> who was making such extraordinary changes in
  Glandier. She was received with bluff friendliness everywhere, and exerted
  herself to be in return amiable and gracious, from a desire not only to live
  on good terms with her neighbours, but to show herself worthy of admiration.
  She wished, even in this rude place, to be adored, worshipped, loved.</p>

  <p>Yet when a ball at the local inn was given in her honour, Madame Charles,
  radiant in her Parisian clothes, white muslin and daisies, could hardly
  suppress an ironic smile and one or two sardonic comments provoked by the
  <i>toilettes</i> of the local beauties. The corsages of these provincial
  ball-dresses were, she observed sarcastically, cut no lower than the tunic of
  the statue of the Virgin in the local church, and the cotton gloves of
  Scottish thread barely covered, and certainly did not disguise, the size and
  the redness of the ladies' hands.</p>

  <p>Marie, though gracious as ever, did not refrain from remarking in tones of
  gentle rebuke to her husband how disgusting it was to see all these already
  overfed people eating and drinking too much, stamping with their feet when
  they danced, and when the lemonade and wine had freely circulated, shouting
  at one another coarse pleasantries; she was also highly amused when she saw
  one young woman who had tried to copy her own Paris frock, and forgetting to
  put in the little chemisette of lawn that held it up over the shoulders and
  bust, appeared in a gown so low-cut that it was the subject of a severe
  sermon by the Abbé the next day at church. Nor did the good priest forget to
  glance rather severely at the stranger in their midst, this brilliant but
  somewhat too gay lady from Paris who was introducing among the simple maidens
  of the Limousin all the fashions, manners and gaieties of the too
  fascinating, too seductive capital, where virtue, the pious Abbé had always
  understood, was less regarded than pleasure and amusement.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Among these admiring but bewildered and censorious neighbours, Marie
  Lafarge found one sentimental friendship. This was with her husband's niece,
  Emma Pontier, seventeen years of age, the gentle, charming daughter of Doctor
  Pontier, who developed a sincere admiration for Mme. Lafarge and spent long
  mornings and afternoons with her, either walking or riding, or in the
  partly-renovated <i>salons</i> of Glandier. Emma too was a romantic who had
  read Walter Scott and other romancers, though she had never been permitted to
  open the novels of George Sand; and she would sit enthralled by the hour
  together while Marie Lafarge, on her brilliant Parisian piano, played the
  Requiem of Mozart, the delicious melodies of Schubert, stirring tunes from
  <i>The Huguenots</i> or the <i>Semiramis</i>, or sang with great feeling and
  dramatic expression either the plaintive <i>Casta Diva</i> from <i>Norma</i>
  or the gay raillery of <i>The Barber of Seville</i>.</p>

  <p>Marie found in the gentle and devoted Emma Pontier the ideal
  <i>confidente</i>, and the affectionate respect of the charming girl did much
  to reconcile her with her new life; the fastidious bride also found the task
  of reforming her husband as interesting as that of reforming her household.
  She had told his uncle, M. Pontier, all that Charles must not do, and
  something of what he must do, if he were in time to gain her favours.</p>

  <p>The young ironmaster had been told by his uncle "that a lady's chamber was
  a sanctuary where she was the all-powerful Queen, that love in the heart of a
  delicate woman could not exist unless it was fostered by the most tender
  consideration and the most loving care." M. Charles Lafarge was warned "that
  the greatest delicacy of words, of thought and of action would alone gain the
  confidence, the esteem of his young wife, and possibly, after a long
  apprenticeship, her affection." It did not occur to Madame Charles that it
  was rather difficult to alter thus a man nearly thirty years of age, and that
  the good doctor, if sincere, might have before tried to reform his
  nephew.</p>

  <p>When Mme. Lafarge had charged M. Pontier with thus improving the mental
  tone and manners of her husband, she sent her waiting-woman to improve his
  appearance. Clementine was entrusted with the task of reforming the young
  man's clumsy toilet; she told him all his wife's tastes, her little caprices
  and manias, the collars that she preferred in gentlemen's attire, the way she
  liked a cravat folded or tied. The sprightly <i>grisette</i> advised M.
  Lafarge to shave every day, to grow side-whiskers, to cut his hair at least
  once a week, to change his cravat twice and his shirt once a day, never to
  come into his wife's presence with what Marie termed "two safeguards against
  love," nails that were in mourning and down-at-heel slippers. Neither was he,
  the waiting-maid warned him, to wear waistcoats of brilliant
  colours&mdash;orange or scarlet&mdash;but rather those of a tender lilac,
  mauve, purple or soft blue.</p>

  <p>Life ran very well like this for several weeks, and was only disturbed by
  a painful scene made by M. Lafarge one evening when he had drunk too much
  champagne and tried to force his way into his wife's room, where she was
  lying down with one of her usual sick headaches. Both the lady and her maid
  prevented the entrance of the intoxicated man as long as they could, but when
  he finally kicked down the door, Marie Lafarge snatched a sheet from her bed
  and began fastening it to the window. Before, however, she could escape by
  this means, her husband had not only entered the room but fallen down in a
  fit, which so alarmed Clementine that she begged her mistress to call for
  help.</p>

  <p>The mother then came running, and with the help of the servants her
  beloved Charles was dragged to his bed and the doctor summoned. The end of
  all the disturbance was a diagnosis of drunkenness, which had brought on a
  nervous crisis or fit; M. Lafarge was often subject to attacks of this sort,
  as his relations and his doctor informed the pallid, disgusted young
  wife.</p>

  <p>In the morning Charles showed the greatest penitence and humbled himself
  before the agitated and disdainful Marie, showing himself so contrite that
  she forgave him. The reconciliation was sealed by a row on the river in the
  moonlight; M. Lafarge took his wife away from Glandier and the factory out
  into the open country, where the little river wound through charming meadows,
  above which rose rocks shaded by a dense forest broken here and there by some
  of those feudal ruins that Marie loved so well. It was a romantic moment;
  Marie was far from miserable; languid and charming she lay indolently against
  the cushions of the boat, swinging idly in her hand a large water-lily she
  had picked from the superb white blooms that floated beneath the trembling
  reeds.</p>

  <p>She had certainly considerably improved the manners and appearance of M.
  Lafarge; she felt like the Princess in the story of <i>The Beauty and The
  Beast</i>; love was surely effecting a transformation in the savage. With his
  hair cut and brushed, his swarthy cheeks shaven, his clothes better-fitting
  and his hands clean, he was not altogether unpresentable. In the moonlight
  she could at least make the best of him: if he was only an ironmaster, if he
  was ugly and coarse, he was at least young, a man, and in love with her.</p>

  <p>When, taking advantage of her mood, he made some clumsy overtures towards
  her, she defended herself coquettishly with the water-lily, splashing him
  with drops of water and declaring that she would consent to remain at
  Glandier if she might continue indefinitely to live with him as a sister, and
  might in time, if he was faithful, good and patient, reward him by consenting
  to live with him as his wife; Charles seemed pleased even by this concession
  and rowed back in the moonlight in a well-behaved manner.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Soon after this Marie Lafarge was taken on a round of visits to all her
  husband's relatives in the Limousin, and in company with some of these to
  Tulle, the chief town of the department of Corrèze. This little town was,
  Marie Lafarge found, picturesquely situated amid some low hills, on the sides
  of which had been built the mansions of the suburbs set in terrace
  gardens.</p>

  <p>There were pleasant drives along these outskirts where the inhabitants,
  either on foot or in carriages, took the air in the evening. These hills
  formed a kind of rude amphitheatre, in the centre of which was situated the
  town proper, and this was far from being a picturesque or charming spot.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge was disgusted to see, in the midst of the villas</p>

  <p>Of the rich <i>bourgeoisie</i>, the miserable black, broken hovels, with
  staircases as difficult, as she remarked, "as those that lead to Paradise,"
  that formed the centre of the town. The inhabitants of these frightful
  streets were dirty, covered with smoke and clothed in rags, and were mostly
  employed in the manufacture of arms, for which Tulle was celebrated. It was
  impossible to pass up and down the sloping streets in a carriage, so Mme.
  Lafarge had to satisfy her curiosity by walking through these slums, where
  the women cast vituperations after her elegant appearance.</p>

  <p>She was taken on a visit of state to the Prefect of the Department, then
  to some other friends of M. Lafarge, mostly manufacturers of arms, to whom he
  supplied raw material; the sojourn at Tulle was then supposed to be
  concluded, but she declared that she wished to satisfy a melancholy curiosity
  and to see the prison, the cemetery and the Law Court.</p>

  <p>The Assizes were being held when Mme. Lafarge was escorted to the
  <i>Palais de Justice</i>, a sad, sombre, grey building situated near the
  poorer quarters of the town in front of a large, mournful square. Mme.
  Lafarge was allowed by her uncle, who was her escort, to peep into one of the
  courts where a case was being tried. This was a sordid enough affair; a young
  woman of the poorer class stood in the dock charged with infanticide. Marie
  Lafarge thought this dismal chamber where Justice held her seat, sad and not
  in the least imposing; it had rather, to her fastidious taste, a squalid and
  sinister air.</p>

  <p>She was shuddering out of the court with scarcely a glance for the
  unfortunate young mother standing downcast in her rags and chains in the
  dock, when her attention was attracted by the rich, sonorous eloquence of the
  young advocate who was defending the prisoner. She looked at him eagerly; he
  was a young man such as she had often approved of in her dreams and not often
  met in her mundane existence.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she whispered to her uncle, and M. Pontier replied that the
  young advocate was a certain Maître Charles Lachaud.</p>

  <p>He had indeed a remarkable appearance; he was tall, well-formed, with a
  majestic head and countenance, on the classic model; his gestures were
  expressive, his words well-chosen and forceful, and Marie Lafarge noted with
  approval his well-kept hands, his exquisite linen and the scrupulous nicety
  of his toilet, which put the provincial lawyer on a level with the elegants
  of Paris.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>That evening Marie Lafarge was taken by her uncle for a promenade on one
  of the rocky terraces above Tulle. There she learnt from him that the young
  girl she had seen on trial for her life that morning had been acquitted, and
  shortly afterwards M. Lachaud, who, like herself, was enjoying the freshness
  of the evening, was presented to her.</p>

  <p>Both the handsome young man and the circumstances under which she had met
  him roused a profound emotion in Marie Lafarge's susceptible breast. She was
  pleased that he was presented to her, and she flattered herself that he was
  pleased in his turn to make her acquaintance.</p>

  <p>He joined them in their promenade; the sky was covered with a light mist
  that veiled the stars sparkling above the mountain, the angelus sounded from
  the churches in the little city below. The rocky path along which the party
  proceeded became so steep that Marie Lafarge was glad to accept the arm of
  Charles Lachaud; he said nothing but what was commonplace, but she felt that
  he was looking at her with a sympathetic interest; he seemed to be studying
  her, questioning her, and, as she believed, divining all her secrets.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After three weeks of these visits Marie Lafarge returned to Glandier and
  absorbed herself once more in reigning over her strange household and in
  directing the masons who were proceeding so slowly with the reconstruction
  and restoration of the Gothic ruins and in the transformation of the little
  <i>château</i>.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge took this opportunity, first, of introducing to her a new
  manager, whom he had brought from Paris to take the place of his
  brother-in-law in helping him with the ironworks, and, secondly, of showing
  her his will, which he had made in her favour, leaving her heiress to all he
  possessed. Mme. Lafarge was perfectly ready to make a will in her turn
  leaving her husband all her possessions, save a small legacy to her sister
  and her sister's child, but reserving some of her personal possessions to be
  left as souvenirs to her relatives and friends. She wrote this will out
  roughly in her own hand, put it in an envelope, which she sealed, and
  delivered it into the charge of her mother-in-law, telling her it was to be a
  secret from her son.</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge, who had been in a bad humour ever since Marie's
  return, because she had been once more dispossessed of her kingdom, received
  this confidence with touching gratitude, and bathing her daughter-in-law's
  hands with tears of happiness, thanked her warmly for her generosity.</p>

  <p>But if this business passed off pleasantly, that of the new manager did
  not. Mme. Lafarge took an instant dislike to this man, who was of a vulgar
  Parisian type, one with whom her rela-tives would never have associated, a
  creature whom she would never have met in the <i>salons</i> she frequented in
  the capital. His name was Denis, his appearance common, his manner insolent
  and his habits coarse.</p>

  <p>When Mme. Lafarge protested to her husband against this choice of a
  manager, he declared that though the exterior of M. Denis was not very
  prepossessing, everything must be put up with since he was such a clever
  manager, such an expert in iron foundry and such an enthusiastic worker.</p>

  <p>Mme. Lafarge, however, soon discovered&mdash;and that from the lips of M.
  Denis himself&mdash;that this new manager had had no experi-ence at all in
  the iron business; by his own admission he had been brought up in idleness,
  but losing all his money through a bad speculation, he had been reduced to
  accepting a position as assistant in a shop where iced lemonades were sold,
  which had been his sole commercial experience.</p>

  <p>Stupefied and outraged by this intelligence, Mme. Lafarge reproached her
  husband for engaging such an assistant. She did not succeed, however, in
  shaking his resolution to retain the insolent M. Denis in his employment.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge's indignation was heightened by the fact that her
  mother-in-law had taken the stranger into great favour and seemed to regard
  him as a second son. For a day or so the offended lady endured the presence
  of this man at her table and in her <i>salon</i>, then, his odious
  familiarities becoming insupportable, she declared that she would no longer
  tolerate an intimacy with one so detestable.</p>

  <p>At this, Mme. Lafarge the elder, in high umbrage, took M. Denis off with
  her every morning to share her chamber with the fattening pigs and turkeys,
  the ripening cheeses and the cakes and sweet-meats that she was eternally
  cooking on her untidy hearth.</p>

  <p>Soon after the making of the will and the arrival of M. Denis at Glandier,
  M. Lafarge informed his wife of the state of his business affairs. These, the
  young woman soon discovered, were not altogether satisfactory. From the long
  and rambling explanation that her husband gave her, and that she only partly
  understood, she gathered the salient fact that the iron foundry required more
  capital, and required it rather desperately at once.</p>

  <p>One of the troubles with which M. Lafarge, who spent so much of his time
  shut in his little office on the ground floor, had to contend was shortage of
  wood and the high cost of the modicum he was able to pi ocure. He had used
  nearly all the ancient oaks planted by the Carthusians; the forests were
  cleared for miles round and it had now become necessary to purchase and
  transport wood from a long way off.</p>

  <p>Faced with this embarrassment the young man had set himself to work to
  invent a process whereby the iron could be smelted and thus spend less on
  wood. He explained this to his young wife, who understood nothing of it at
  all, but, moved by his courtesy and enthusiasm, showed herself pleased and
  attentive. He then told her that he meant to go to Paris to patent his
  invention and to raise, by a mortgage on the ironworks, some of the capital
  he required. He suggested that she should lend him some money by realising
  some of her capital; this of course could, and would, easily be put back when
  the ironworks were again prosperous.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge spoke boldly and confidently; he was sure that a large fortune
  was round the corner and that when his invention was patented he would become
  one of the richest men in France. He also suggested to Marie that she should
  write to her various well-placed friends and relations begging them to
  recommend him to the Minister as a fitting person to receive a patent and to
  give him introductions to various people likely to be interested in his
  business and to invest in Glandier.</p>

  <p>Marie agreed and wrote in warm terms to her relatives and friends,
  speaking of her increased happiness in her marriage, of the bright prospects
  of the iron foundry, of the virtues and devo-tion of her husband, and begging
  them to lend him all the help in their power.</p>

  <p>Affairs were at this juncture when two of Marie's friends, a M. and Mme.
  Sabatié, arrived to pay her a visit. This filled the young woman with
  pleasure and excitement; they were the first friends of her girlhood whom she
  had seen since her marriage, and she exerted herself to do them honour. She
  was no longer ashamed of Glandier, because not only had she really improved
  it, but she had surrounded it with all the glamour of her day-dreams and
  already saw it as a Gothic castle of no mean pretension.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge made himself very agreeable to his wife's friends and all four
  of them laughed over his story of the letter&mdash;"full of frightful lies,"
  as Marie herself said&mdash;that she had written on the night of her first
  arrival at Glandier. All that romantic episode was now a matter for jest and
  raillery, and Marie was really proud when she was able to show Mme. Sabatié
  her genuine Gothic cloisters, the magnificent ruins of the Carthusian church,
  and several fine statues and arches that her masons had excarated.</p>

  <p>Before M. and Madame Sabatié left Glandier, M. Lafarge had discovered that
  the lady had a property worth three hundred thousand francs situated a long
  way from Paris that her husband was anxious to sell, and he at once urged M.
  Sabatié to get rid of this inconvenient estate as soon as possible and to
  invest his capital in the ironworks at Glandier.</p>

  <p>Soon after the departure of her friends Marie had an alarming attack of
  illness during which her life was despaired of; the local doctors, called in
  hastily by the alarmed Lafarge family, declared that she was suffering from
  an attack of nerves that had brought on a cerebral congestion, that her life
  had only been saved by the attention of Clementine, who was continually
  pouring iced water over her head, and the devotion of M. Lafarge, who held
  her feet for hours in a bath of hot water.</p>

  <p>When Marie recovered consciousness after lying senseless for several days,
  she was touched, moved and even further reconciled to Glandier by the
  emotions she saw on the faces of all those gathered round her bedside. Even
  her mother-in-law, whom she had come to regard with dislike and suspicion,
  seemed overwhelmed by the prospect of her loss; Emma Pontier was in tears, M.
  Lafarge had not left her bedside day and night for nearly a week, and in the
  ante-chamber all the servants, over whom she had so elegantly tyrannised, and
  all the workmen who had been labouring to erect her Gothic <i>château</i> for
  her, were on their knees praying for her recovery.</p>

  <p>Touched by all this enthusiastic affection Marie Lafarge languidly
  returned to life, and soon after she was out of danger her young husband took
  his departure for Paris, after an affectionate farewell and warm good wishes
  from Marie.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The autumn days were now closing down into winter, but Marie Lafarge was
  able to look forward to that gloomy season with some equanimity. She had
  really made herself comfortable; her large bedchamber was daintily furnished,
  there was a soft carpet on the floor, the bed was freshly curtained, adorned
  with fine linen sheets and satin coverlets, the walls of the room had been
  papered in silver, a large, handsome writing desk held everything that was
  necessary for an author, muslin curtains of a brilliant whiteness shaded by
  others of rose-coloured silk were at the window, and on the shining walls
  were portraits of all those whom Marie had loved or lost&mdash;her mother,
  her father, her grandfather, her infant half-sister, her uncles and
  aunts&mdash;charming miniatures in dainty frames tied up with coquettish bows
  of satin and velvet. A handsome press held all Marie's Parisian
  <i>toilette</i>, kept in exquisite condition by Clementine, and still, after
  several months of provincial wear, sufficiently up-to-date to dazzle the
  whole of the Limousin. This chamber, furnished also with books, music,
  materials for water-colour painting and embroidery, was regarded as a
  sanctuary by Marie, and the door that communicated with the ill-kept chamber
  of M. Lafarge was never unlocked.</p>

  <p>The absence of her "lord and master" added considerably to Marie Lafarge's
  peace of mind; when he was far away he was easier to idealise, she did not
  have under her eyes the hundred and one instances of meanness, inferiority,
  common and vulgar ideas that prevented her from really respecting or admiring
  her husband. Besides, when he was away he wrote her love-letters, passionate
  and romantic enough to please even her difficult taste; she liked to receive
  these and she liked to answer them. This she did in a fantastic, extravagant
  strain, forgetting in the pleasure of putting her amorous feelings on paper
  the man to whom the was writing.</p>

  <p>Often in the evening she would put on a ball-gown, loosen her hair, put
  through her locks a spray of the only flowers then available&mdash;ground ivy
  or mistletoe&mdash;and, with a mirror in front of her in which she could see
  her pale and noble reflection whenever she raised her eyes, would write with
  her dangerous facility letters full of devotion, passion and friendship to
  the absent Charles Lafarge. He replied in the same strain, on one occasion
  even going so far as to write protestations of eternal devotion in his own
  blood, to which he affixed with a speck of gum a lock of his own hair,
  bidding his beloved little Marie kiss the place three or four times because
  his lips had already rested there.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge tried to keep this interesting and even exciting
  correspondence entirely to herself. She found that she had to face the
  jealousy and suspicion of her mother-in-law, who wished to see every line her
  son wrote. Marie Lafarge tried to arrange this difficulty by asking her
  husband to send her formal letters she could show to his mother and others
  enclosed that would be for herself alone. This trickery was soon discovered
  by the elder woman, who made a bitter scene on the strength of it, and soon
  after retired altogether to her own apartment, where she suffered no one to
  enter but the favourite M. Denis, who was disliked every day more and more by
  Marie, who kept out of his way when possible, and who, when forced to meet
  him in her house, gave him disdainful glances.</p>

  <p>She was glad of the quarrel that had rid her of the sad, gloomy and
  suspicious presence of Mme. Lafarge, and she made the devoted and romantic
  Emma Pontier her sole companion. The two young women spent all their leisure
  together, reading romances and poetry, playing or singing, comparing and
  discussing their frocks, their embroidery, their water-colours, their
  daydreams. They wandered together in the ruins that the masons had now
  abandoned until the spring, and that, dark and foreboding, rose up with true
  Gothic gloom against the cloudy skies of the departing year. Emma read aloud
  from the pages of Chateaubriand while Marie played Schubert or Mozart.</p>

  <p>The effect of this delicious harmony of poetry and music was often too
  much for the tender and impressionable organism of Emma. Sometimes when the
  heavy twilight invaded the <i>salon</i>, when black shadows lay in the
  corners of the lofty room, it seemed to both these sensitive young women that
  phantoms surrounded them, and Emma would rest her head on Marie's shoulders
  and break into melancholy tears. Mme. Lafarge would sometimes share her young
  cousin's agitation and the two would be found clasped together weeping when
  the servant brought in the lamp.</p>

  <p>As the winter evenings shortened, Emma Pontier took up her residence at
  Glandier; her home, that of a hard-working provincial doctor, was a poor one;
  she had little fortune and small hope of any but an ordinary marriage.
  Resigned to this fate, with little ambition and no bitterness in her gentle
  disposition, the young girl indulged, however, with an almost despairing
  avidity, in romantic dreams; seated either in the bedchamber or in the
  <i>salon</i> by the dying fire in those precious twilight hours before the
  light was brought in, the two girls would repeat to each other the romantic
  and horrible stories connected with Glandier, which Emma had known all her
  life and which Marie had lately heard from the lips of her mother-in-law or
  the servants, told in the hushed whispers of trembling credulity.</p>

  <p>They talked of the seven monks whose murders had been the cause of the
  foundation of the Carthusian monastery, they talked of the brother who, in
  the days long ago, had murdered his own child in the convent and cast its
  body into the lake, they discussed the ghost of the old abbot that was
  supposed at night to traverse the ruined cloisters chanting the penitential
  psalms; then there was the tale of the mistress of Glandier who, two
  generations before, had been apprised of the approaching death of her husband
  by a supernatural kiss, cold as ice, upon her forehead in the middle of the
  night. Mme. Lafarge the elder had herself often declared in a voice full of
  terror that she had frequently seen, when alone on a cold and stormy winter
  night, a grey phantom creep into her fire and extend skeleton hands to the
  blaze, while from the depths of the shadowy skull frozen tears had slowly
  trickled from the empty eye-sockets.</p>

  <p>Emma and Marie often sat up till two or three in the morning, playing the
  piano, reading novels and telling each other these stories. On one such
  occasion Marie, with her hair loosened to her waist and a garland of flowers
  on her brow&mdash;artificial blooms of silk and velvet, for it was impossible
  to gather natural blossoms at this season of the year&mdash;was seated at the
  piano playing mournful melodies. Emma, restless and refusing to go to bed,
  had insisted on opening Marie's trunk and on bringing out her wedding dress.
  Then nothing would please Emma but Marie must attire herself in this virginal
  splendour; pleased at this insistence, half-intoxicated by the love-letters
  she had been writing, by the music she had been playing and by the gloomy
  silence of the hour, Marie agreed. She was arrayed by the tender, admiring
  Emma in her bridal splendour, covered with her veil of English lace and
  crowned with her garland of orange blossom. Sighing in voluptuous melancholy
  the young woman indulged in mournful reflections, thinking of all the
  romantic hopes that had filled her foolish heart when last she had donned
  this splendid attire and how all now were dispersed by the cold breath of
  reality.</p>

  <p>Emma insisted on having her bed brought into Marie's chamber, so
  Clementine carried in the little couch and placed it beside the
  high-curtained, draped bed of Madame Lafarge. She then bade good-night to the
  two young ladies and left them. A solitary lamp lit the large room and
  outside a thunderstorm began to break above the ruins, the hills, the river
  of Glandier.</p>

  <p>Marie, still in her bridal attire, sat upon the bed clasping in a kind of
  rapture of terror the small, frail hand of Emma. Suddenly the lamp went out
  and the large room was lit only by the flickering flames of the expiring
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," whispered Emma, nervously pressing closer to her
  friend.</p>

  <p>Marie was a little afraid herself, but feeling it her duty to reassure the
  younger girl she began to tell her tales of somnambulism, magnetism and other
  such wonders that in the opinion of some people were supposed to explain all
  seeming supernatural happenings.</p>

  <p>While Marie was speaking, however, she was distracted, as was her
  companion, by the sound of the rain on the window, the whining of the wind in
  the corridor, the hoots of the owls outside and the distant bark of the
  wolves in the mountains. She gradually became silent; the two girls, half
  concealed under Marie's bridal veil, clasped each other convulsively. The
  sinking fire now lit only the corners of the piano, which looked like an
  immense coffin.</p>

  <p>Emma shivered, her teeth chattered. Marie felt her heart heavy with
  presentiments. It seemed to her that a gigantic phantom of a monk stood
  between her and the window. With a stifled cry she pressed Emma to her heart;
  the two girls plunged beneath the sheets and coverlets, and hiding their
  heads in the bed curtains remained thus mute and trembling until the first
  ray of light was announced by the bell of the angelus.</p>

  <p>The next morning at <i>déjeuner</i> the two girls recounted to Mme.
  Lafarge what they had imagined they had seen during the sombre storm of that
  gloomy night; Marie however did not add to her account a description of the
  phantom of the monk; she felt unwilling, she told herself, to add another
  superstition to all the superstitions that already troubled the solitude of
  Glandier.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge began to show herself very jealous of her
  daughter-in-law's friendship for Emma and took an opportunity of telling the
  young girl the story of Marie Lafarge's arrival at Glandier, of the letter on
  sky-blue paper she had written, in which she avowed her love for another man
  and her intention to fly to Smyrna. To this tale, already fantastic, she
  added a few spiteful touches of her own invention; so the poor child was
  affected and depressed.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge, noticing a change in the demeanour of her
  <i>confidente</i>, soon got from her an account of the old woman's perfidy,
  which she was able to counter-balance by telling Emma the whole story of her
  courtship, marriage, her journey to the Limousin, the scenes at Orleans, all
  the incidents disgusting, horrible or trivial that had led up to the state of
  affairs in which she had written the letter full of such fantastic lies.</p>

  <p>Emma entirely sympathised with her friend, and the two girls became more
  confidential than ever, the more so as M. Pontier, the father of Emma, soon
  left the Limousin to go on business to Algiers for a long visit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Into this indolent, dreamy, romantic existence continued to come reminders
  of the reality of the outer world&mdash;desperate letters from M. Lafarge. He
  found it very difficult to obtain his patent; as for the loan, the
  achievement of this seemed to present insuperable difficulties; a succession
  of disastrous speculations had rendered bankers irritable and suspicious. M.
  Lafarge again asked his wife for monetary assistance, and in return she sent
  him a letter that amounted to a power of attorney, telling him that he might
  either sell or raise a mortgage on the land she had inherited from her
  grandfather at Villers-Hellon. She begged him to have patience and courage,
  and declared that she would stand beside him as loyal partner and wife in all
  his difficulties. He replied to this generous offer with a letter full of
  gratitude and a passionate request for her portrait.</p>

  <p>Marie accordingly had this executed by a neighbour, a certain Mlle. Ann
  Lebrun, who was an amateur painter of high local reputation and miserable
  performance. Mme. Lafarge did not like this young woman, whom she termed in
  her heart "an old maid," and who was flattering and servile in a far from
  pleasant manner, but who seemed at the same time intriguing, shrewd and
  sharp-tongued.</p>

  <p>After several days of intense labour Mlle. Lebrun produced a female face
  with eyes, nose, lips, a red-and-white complexion, a mass of black hair posed
  against a bright blue sky and tied by a knot of bright pink ribbon. Mme.
  Lafarge the elder declared herself enthusiastic over this portrait; Mlle.
  Lebrun admitted that it was a fine piece of work, and when Marie Lafarge
  protested that the complexion was far too bright, the answer was that rosy
  cheeks looked very well against a bright blue sky.</p>

  <p>The picture was carefully packed up to be sent by the post-chaise to
  Paris, and, as a pretty romantic thought, Marie Lafarge added to the parcel
  six of the little cakes that her mother-in-law was so skilful in making and
  of which her son was so fond. She asked him to eat these on a certain evening
  at a certain hour; she would, at the same time, eat another such cake, after
  a feast of turkey and truffles, and this would form a mystic love-feast. She
  also asked her husband to send her a few little cakes from the famous shop
  Felix that had been one of the charming <i>rendez-vous</i> for herself and
  her friends during her joyous girlhood in Paris. Not, she added, that she
  thought the cakes would be eatable by the time they reached Glandier, but
  even to see and touch one would evoke pleasant memories.</p>

  <p>Antonine, Mme. de Violaine, Marie Lafarge's sister, was in Paris, and
  Marie suggested to her husband that she should be invited to the little
  feast. In her turn, she invited Mme. Buffière to Glandier, but this lady
  refused, saying that she was too ill to make the journey. Marie Lafarge,
  however, held her "little feast of the absent ones," as she termed it, and
  the sombre <i>château</i> of Glandier echoed to the sound of music, dancing,
  songs, the clink of glasses and the notes of laughter and animated
  conversation. Mme. Lafarge had brought in the servants and workmen, who
  still, when-ever the weather was fine enough, were employed in embellishing
  the Gothic ruins, to share in this feast, and Clementine made that delicate
  China tea which was still the wonder of Glandier.</p>

  <p>In cups of tea and in glasses of wine the health of M. Lafarge, the absent
  master of Glandier and the ironworks, and success to his hopes of obtaining a
  loan and a patent for his invention were drunk.</p>

  <p>Marie's solitude was soon after enlivened by the presence of her little
  niece. Mme. Buffière was expecting another child and found it convenient to
  send her child to Glandier. No sooner had this charming creature, who was
  however rude and wild, arrived at the <i>château</i> than Mlle. Lebrun
  expressed a passionate desire to paint her portrait. For this reason, or
  under this excuse, the elder Mme. Lafarge invited her to stay at the
  <i>château</i> indefinitely, since she declared that it would take her
  several weeks&mdash;or perhaps months&mdash;to paint the charming little
  rosebud in a manner that would do her justice.</p>

  <p>When a letter arrived from M. Lafarge acknowledging receipt of the packet,
  it was discovered that Marie's scheme of a love-feast had been a failure. M.
  Lafarge had received the cakes and the portrait on December 17th, the day
  after that which his wife had arranged for the festival. He had had a
  business appointment and been forced to leave his room almost immediately
  after he had received the parcel; he had however broken off a morsel of the
  cake and eaten that; Madame de Violaine was absent from Paris.</p>

  <p>After his return late in the evening he had been taken very ill with a
  frightful headache and vomiting, and he informed his wife that his health was
  by no means re-established. Nor had he been successful in his business. The
  Ministry still delayed in granting him a patent and the only money he had
  been able to obtain was that which he had raised on his wife's property; this
  sum, of about 25,000 francs, he was bringing back with him to Glandier, for,
  despairing of obtaining any results from a longer stay in Paris, he had
  decided to come home without waiting either for the patent or the possibility
  of a further loan on his property.</p>

  <p>Mlle. Lebrun, who was plain, poor, of a complaining turn of mind, allied
  herself to the party of the elder Mme. Lafarge, and when she was not meddling
  at her daub that was supposed to represent the little Mlle. Buffière, she was
  closeted with the old lady, and sometimes with M. Denis, in the bedchamber
  where the cheeses ripened and the turkeys fattened. Marie Lafarge, disdaining
  this intrigue, kept herself aloof; she was glad, she declared to her
  mother-in-law, to offer her home and her hospitality to poor Mlle. Lebrun,
  but she did not desire too much of her company, to which the old woman
  replied that she was trying to marry the unfortunate spinster to a rich
  widower of the neighbouring town, a certain "monsieur" who lived at
  Excideuil, not far from Faye.</p>

  <p>So far the two Mesdames Lafarge had been on terms of armed neutrality
  during the absence of the master of the house, but a few days before his
  return was expected a terrible scene disclosed the real state of affairs.</p>

  <p>This began by the elder woman's remarking on two rich pearls, set either
  side a handsome diamond, which Marie Lafarge wore to fasten her elegant
  collar of English lace, and which the prudent provincial declared was far too
  splendid to be worn when reading a novel or playing the piano. Marie Lafarge,
  with some disdain, replied that these rich jewels had been a wedding present
  from a relative. The talk then fell upon Marie Lafarge's fortune, the land
  she owned at Villers-Hellon, the money she might raise with the help of her
  wealthy relatives until the younger woman understood that it was the
  intention of the Lafarge family to absorb every penny she possessed. Too
  unbusinesslike, frivolous and light-headed to realise that she might be
  reducing herself to penury through sheer carelessness, that her husband and
  his relatives might be deceiving her and the ironworks worth little or
  nothing, she said with her grand air to the elder Mme. Lafarge:</p>

  <p>"You know I have made a will in favour of Charles. He shall have
  everything save a few legacies. Besides, I have already sent Charles a power
  of attorney in Paris and he has raised money on my property at
  Villers-Hellon."</p>

  <p>The elder woman seemed satisfied with this declaration and took the
  opportunity of drawing a paper from her pocket and of giving it to her
  daughter-in-law to sign. This the young woman did, indifferently enough. It
  was, her mother-in-law told her, an order for wood, which it was absolutely
  necessary to have unless the factories were to close down.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge demanded, with a flash of insight: "Is Charles then so much
  in debt that his name alone is not good enough to obtain credit?"</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge did not reply, but with pursed-up lips and an air
  of offence left the <i>salon</i>.</p>

  <p>The young woman felt angry. Despite their submission, their flatteries,
  their almost servility, she began to suspect that all these people were using
  her; she remembered the will, the power of attorney, and she thought that
  perhaps before she had signed either she should have had the advice of her
  aunts and uncles. With this thought vaguely in her mind and with some
  unformed intention of telling M. de Martens or M. Garat of her circumstances,
  Marie Lafarge went to the desk in the <i>salon</i> where she had seen her
  mother-in-law put the holograph will she had given her some months before.
  The desk was unlocked, but the will had gone.</p>

  <p>Marie then went to her mother-in-law's apartment, the one chamber in the
  house that she usually carefully avoided, and entering, demanded of the old
  lady the will.</p>

  <p>After many evasions and much delay this was produced, and Marie took it to
  her own bedchamber, drew it out of the envelope and began to peruse it. She
  noticed at once, with rage and dismay, that it was not the same document that
  she had given to her mother-in-law, although it embodied the same intentions.
  She soon saw what had been done. Mme. Lafarge had broken the seal after
  solemnly promising not to do so, had read the will, had taken it to the
  family lawyer and had it recast in watertight, legal terms, while Marie's
  signature, cut from the holograph script, had been attached to the
  bottom.</p>

  <p>Marie noticed, too, with an inexpressible indignation, that her legacies
  to her sister and her relatives had been cut out, and that the will as it
  stood now left Charles Lafarge the absolute heir to all that she might
  possess at the time of her decease.</p>

  <p>"What," she exclaimed, "they have speculated in my marriage! Do they now
  wish to speculate in my death?"&mdash;and she went at once in a tempest of
  indignation to her mother-in-law's room and charged her with breaking open
  the envelope that contained the secret will and altering it.</p>

  <p>The elder woman made no attempt to deny her offence, but falling on her
  knees besought her daughter-in-law's pity, declaring that what she had done
  had been entirely for the sake of her beloved Charles, that she had not
  wished to disturb Marie with dry legal details and that she thought she had
  done her a service in consulting the lawyer secretly. She refused to rise
  from her knees or to cease her entreaties until Mme. Charles, exhausted and
  overwrought, promised not to mention her fault to her son.</p>

  <p>The elder woman then began her usual flattery and coaxing, and told Marie
  that she was certain to have a child&mdash;and probably before long&mdash;and
  that would make all questions regarding the will ridiculous, as of course
  another one would have to be made leaving everything to the infant heir.</p>

  <p>This talk of her possible maternity pleased and flattered Marie; she had
  always promised herself if she had a child that it should be a daughter, and
  named Jacqueline in memory of her beloved grandfather.</p>

  <p>Seeing her pleased and soothed, the elder woman began to tell her that she
  was sure from her pallor, fainting fits, nausea and so on, that she was
  likely to have a child quite soon. Marie thought that from the platonic
  relations she maintained with her husband this was not likely, but allowed
  herself to be persuaded by the experienced matron that it might be possible.
  She returned to her room confused and excited by this new thought, but still
  full of suspicion and indignation towards Mme. Lafarge. She wrote to her
  sister and aunt speaking of the possible advent of "little Jacqueline."</p>

  <p>The commotion caused by this scene had scarcely died down when the young
  ironmaster returned home. It was clear both to his mother and to his wife the
  moment he stepped from his carriage that he was extremely ill; he was not
  able to give them any information about his affairs, but was at once hurried
  to bed; he seemed better, shared the <i>débris</i> of a chicken and truffles
  with his wife, then immediately dropped into a state of insensibility broken
  only by violent attacks of pain and vomiting fits.</p>

  <p>Charles Lafarge had brought with him two heavy leather cases that
  contained the 25,000 francs he had raised on his wife's property and that had
  been in the charge of a trusty domestic. On his arrival at Glandier, M.
  Lafarge, though half-unconscious, had ordered this precious money to be
  placed in his office. This was done, and in the confusion of his sudden and,
  as it seemed, terrible illness, no further notice was taken of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>The household, ruled over by two women of conflicting interests and
  tempers, had never been harmonious or well-organised, and now at this crisis
  speedily fell into chaos. Not only his wife and his mother, but M. Denis, the
  other clerk Magnaud, Mlle. Lebrun, Clementine and all the servants passed in
  and out of the chamber of the sick man, whose attacks of pain were frightful
  to behold and whose weakness was alarming.</p>

  <p>When M. Fleyniat, a doctor and uncle of the patient, arrived, however, he
  made light of the illness, declaring that it was due merely to
  indigestion&mdash;to which M. Lafarge was very subject&mdash;and the fatigue
  of the journey added to business anxieties, as a cure he ordered copious
  drinks of orangeade. After M. Lafarge had partaken of this refreshment he
  seemed much better, and calling his wife to his bedside, showed her with
  pride a paper that he drew from underneath his pillow. It was none other than
  the long-expected patent for his smelting invention that he had finally
  obtained.</p>

  <p>Marie received this surprise with joy and enthusiasm, and in her turn
  showed her husband a little present she had had sent from Paris during his
  absence. This consisted of a little seal in green malachite engraved with a
  device of her own invention that included a forge.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge displayed this trifle with great pleasure to his mother,
  exclaiming: "How Marie loves me! How good she is! She is always thinking of
  me, even when I'm absent!"</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge did not, however, share her son's pleasure. After
  the scene about the will she had, despite her remorse and dismay, adopted a
  very hostile, bitter attitude towards her daughter-in-law.</p>

  <p>Asking his wife to share his supper, which his weakness forced him to take
  in bed, M. Lafarge questioned her about what had happened during his absence.
  She had nothing but ill news to give him. She told him of the increasing
  negligence and impertinence of M. Denis, of the lack of charcoal that had
  caused a large portion of the factory to close down, of her own loneliness,
  personal grief and torment; immediately after supper the invalid was taken
  with a terrible attack of pain; he passed, however, a good night, but in the
  morning was extremely weak. He made an effort to interview M. Denis and
  enquired about the two bags of money that had been left in his office; M.
  Denis reported to him that these were safe.</p>

  <p>M. Buffière, the brother-in-law, then arrived and had a long interview
  with the sick man that seemed to leave him suffering and exhausted.</p>

  <p>By five o'clock that evening his attacks of sickness had become alarmingly
  violent; they were attributed by his mother to some meringues filled with
  perfumed whipped cream that he had insisted on taking at midday.</p>

  <p>M. Buffière made light of the whole affair and told the young wife that
  his brother-in-law frequently had these attacks; but there being no abatement
  in M. Lafarge's illness, no one went to bed that night in Glandier. The elder
  Mme. Lafarge showed the greatest anxiety and lack of control and, wandering
  about the house, declared that her son had been poisoned, probably by his
  enemies in Paris; and she went back to the old story that her husband had
  been disposed of by a piece of poisoned nougat; she added gloomily that his
  symptoms were exactly the same as those from which her son was now
  suffering.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning another doctor, M. Bardon, arrived in the
  midst of the agitated household. Marie Lafarge met him in the entrance hall,
  which was always to her so gloomy and sinister, and told him of the state of
  the invalid and the frightful suspicions of his mother.</p>

  <p>The good doctor laughed and said that Mme. Lafarge suffered from a very
  fantastic imagination. After he had examined the invalid, he said that there
  were no signs of poison, that Charles Lafarge was suffering from an
  inflammation of the stomach; he added that the death of his father had been a
  natural one, that he had looked after him himself; he declared, too, that
  Charles Lafarge suffered from an angina, and he gave his wife directions for
  nursing him; he was to be given nothing cold but to have frequent doses of
  soothing syrups.</p>

  <p>While the doctor was giving these directions to Marie Lafarge in the
  bedchamber of her sick husband, he noticed the noise the rats made by running
  about overhead, and he asked the young lady if she had never done anything to
  combat this nuisance.</p>

  <p>She replied that she had, after trying <i>nux vomica</i> in vain, bought a
  small quantity of arsenic on December 12th, that she had mixed this with
  flour and water and laid it about in various cupboards, but that this had had
  no effect, as it had been ruined through the stupidity of a servant, who had
  mixed it so stiffly that it was like nothing but a piece of plaster and quite
  impossible to break or for the animals to gnaw.</p>

  <p>M. Bardon then advised Marie Lafarge to mix with the flour and poison some
  sugar and butter, and as she declared she had no more arsenic he advised her
  to buy more, so she wrote a little note to the same chemist, M. Eyssartier,
  asking him to send some arsenic, some marshmallow and some powdered gum with
  other medicinal articles.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Charles Lafarge did not prove an amiable invalid; he sent "to the devil"
  everyone who came into his chamber and showed the greatest annoyance and rage
  when he saw his brother-in-law, his sister and his mother gossiping together
  in corners. He was also intensely exasperated that, when his affairs were in
  such a disastrous state, he was not able to rise to attend to them; all the
  women in the house went to and fro for hours with drinks, frictions,
  poultices and broth, as well as the medicines ordered by the doctor, so that
  there was a perpetual <i>cancan</i> in the sick man's chamber, but none
  thought of hushing their agitated voices, their lamentations, their
  contradictions and counter-directions for his sake.</p>

  <p>Mlle. Lebrun made herself so useful that her hostess begged her to spend a
  few more days at Glandier, so she joined the others in running between the
  kitchen and the sick chamber with glasses, bowls and pots full of various
  nauseous, useless and sickly mixtures.</p>

  <p>All the while there was a determined but subtle and underground battle
  going on between wife and mother for the favours of the sick man, who showed
  a decided preference for the younger woman, which filled her with ignoble
  triumph and encouraged her to show off before the mother the dominion she had
  over the son. She believed herself justified in this unpleasant action
  because she had learnt from the broken sentences of Charles that his mother
  had done her best to poison his mind against his wife.</p>

  <p>The confusion in Glandier increased hourly, and the hatred of the
  <i>famille</i> Lafarge for Marie Cappelle became so manifest that even her
  vanity could no longer mistake the passions she had aroused in the hearts of
  these people whom she had despised and whom she had treated with such
  flippant condescension.</p>

  <p>She became aware that she was an object of fear and detestation to Madame
  Lafarge <i>mère</i>, that M. Denis, the clerk Magnaud, and M. Buffière, who
  had returned to Glandier on the news of his brother-in-law's illness, were
  all working against her, that she, in some obscure way, was interfering with
  their plans, that she had no friend or ally in this dismal dwelling save her
  maid Clementine, the <i>Parisienne</i> Mion, whom she had installed in the
  kitchen, Alfred, the manservant, son of her father's old coachman, who had
  been sent from Villers-Hellon, and Emma Pontier who paid frequent visits from
  Uzerche.</p>

  <p>M. Lafarge was installed in his wife's large bedchamber, which she had
  furnished so comfortably for her own use, and Marie occupied the adjoining
  room that had been his; as this opened directly on to the stairs, it served
  as a corridor to the sick chamber and Marie had neither privacy nor repose.
  The elder Madame Lafarge, Mlle. Lebrun, Denis and his wife, the clerk
  Magnaud, went freely in and out of M. Lafarge's room, with remedies,
  <i>tisanes</i> of all descriptions, lamenting, chattering, offering advice
  and discussing business affairs; the wife and her maid, the other servants
  also took their turns at watching and dosing the patient, who, tormented by
  this continual <i>brouhaha</i> about his bed, tossed about with cries of
  despair and furious curses.</p>

  <p>The confusion was increased by the arrival of an aunt, Madame Panzini, who
  rushed into the <i>mêlée</i> with new balms, new <i>tisanes</i>, new plasters
  and advice so voluble that the groans and protests of her nephew could
  scarcely be heard above her flood of words; she also brought some holy water
  that Marie Lafarge drank in error.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The weather was wild; torrents of rain blotted out the view from the
  windows, hung with Marie's fresh muslin curtains, violent gusts of wind
  wailed along the narrow corridors, rushed down the chimneys and blew out the
  ashes and embers of the dreary neglected dwelling that Marie Cappelle's
  efforts had done so little to improve; baths, medicines, drinks of all kinds,
  plasters, balsams, were continually being prepared, not only in the kitchen,
  but in the bedchamber of Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> and on the grate in the
  rooms occupied by the patient and his wife.</p>

  <p>All these attentions were violently refused by Charles Lafarge, who would
  take nothing but copious draughts of cold water.</p>

  <p>M. Bardon, who came every morning, ordered soothing drinks, leeches, hot
  flannels, and plasters and continued to assure wife and mother that the
  illness was not dangerous, but merely the result of fatigue and worry, and
  that the seeming agonies of the patient were mere manifestations of a
  violent, nervous and choleric temperament.</p>

  <p>On one occasion he gave M. Lafarge a gargle of alum, which the patient
  declared burnt his throat, and was, he was sure, vitriol, which had been
  given him by mistake. He added that M. Bardon kept his surgery in dirt and
  disorder and was quite likely to make such an error.</p>

  <p>As the miserable days, filled with recriminations, arguments, expressions
  of unrestrained alarm, agitation and suspense, dragged on, the sufferings of
  Charles Lafarge increased; his vomitings became less frequent, but his
  attacks of agony succeeded one another with frightful rapidity.</p>

  <p>The brief hours of murky daylight were followed by the long nights lit by
  oil lamps and candles; there was no sleep for the patient, and little for
  those who considered themselves his nurses. Marie, exhausted, sickened by the
  revolting details of her husband's illness, was weakened by cramp in the
  stomach and a severe cough on her chest; she vomited every time she tried to
  eat and was tormented with a constant headache.</p>

  <p>With an extraordinary display of nervous energy, she refused to take more
  than a few hours of repose and kept her place by her husband's bed and took
  her turn in waiting on him.</p>

  <p>The scenes she had to witness were of the most appalling description; one
  night Charles Lafarge, in a paroxysm of agony, tried to open his veins with a
  razor and to dash his head against the wall; he was quieted by the buckets of
  cold water that the shuddering Marie emptied over his naked torso, and by the
  bitter winter air flowing in from the window that Ann Lebrun desperately
  opened.</p>

  <p>As the patient regarded his wife with more favour than the other members
  of his household, she was charged with the thankless task of endeavouring to
  induce him to take the medicines prescribed; she tried secretly to place
  powdered gum, marshmallow or linseed in the drinks of cold water that her
  husband constantly demanded.</p>

  <p>These efforts were viewed with suspicion by Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> who
  was in and out of the two rooms "fifty times a minute" as her daughter-in-law
  complained, with her own particular brews and nostrums, and who continually
  added to the tortures of the patient by long, agitated and insistent
  cross-examinations as to his sufferings and so on.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On the Tuesday evening the patient felt easier and had fallen asleep with
  his head on his wife's shoulder, when his sister Amena, who had been summoned
  to Glandier, threw herself like a madwoman into the room and, casting herself
  on her brother, screamed:</p>

  <p>"Charles&mdash;you are dying! What will become of me! Oh, my brother, I
  will follow you to the grave!"</p>

  <p>A painful scene followed; the sick man, deeply alarmed, protested that he
  felt better; his hysterical sister, who was expecting a child in a few weeks,
  insisted that he was dying, and Marie, angrily, ordered M. Buffière to take
  his wife away. When the struggling, weeping Amena was finally dragged from
  the chamber, M. Lafarge was in a state of collapse from terror, and Marie had
  to keep guard all night to prevent his sister from re-entering his room.</p>

  <p>On the doctor's visit the next morning his patient was so obviously worse
  that Marie Lafarge demanded another physician and asked for a certain M.
  Segeral, a man highly recommended by her uncle, M. Pontier, then in the East;
  Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> objected to this doctor, however, and Denis was
  sent into Brives to fetch a certain Dr. Massenat.</p>

  <p>This gentleman, after a long examination of the patient, declared him to
  be suffering from a nervous disorder&mdash;the attacks of agony, the
  weakness, the low pulse, the cold extremities, were all, he said, nervous
  symptoms. He took his leave, declaring that M.</p>

  <p>Lafarge was in no danger and quite safe in the hands of M. Bardon. He
  ordered soothing syrups, chicken broth and a little opium, mounted his
  <i>coupé</i> and drove off through the rain.</p>

  <p>Marie and Amena became reconciled on the strength of this good news and
  tried to induce the elder woman to take some rest; this the mother harshly
  refused, declaring that there was a plot to be rid of her, and sharp words
  were exchanged between her and Marie.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, madame!" cried the young wife. "Do as you please. As
  soon as Charles is well I shall go far out of the reach of your jealousies
  and calumnies&mdash;if he cares for me he will follow me, if he prefers you I
  shall not complain!"</p>

  <p>With this declaration of open warfare Marie Cappelle swept her elegant
  flounces out of the sick chamber, leaving her mother-in-law to pour
  complaints against her into the ear of the sick man. Marie had already
  learned from Clementine that MM. Denis, Magnaud and Buffière were spreading
  all kinds of tales to her discredit in the neighbourhood; the impertinent
  tittle-tattle of the lively <i>grisette</i> did not improve the atmosphere of
  Glandier, already electric with evil passions.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The invalid complained bitterly of the rats, declaring that they jumped on
  his bed and drank his <i>tisanes</i>, while Marie had found some of her
  dresses, notably an elegant green <i>amazone</i>, and lingerie eaten by the
  vermin. She therefore begged M. Denis, the next time he was in Brives, to
  bring her the arsenic that he had once forgotten; on January 10th he handed
  her a large parcel that he declared contained 64 grammes of arsenic and that
  she placed in the pocket of her apron.</p>

  <p>When next time she visited her husband he spoke again of the noise the
  rats made over his head. Upon that she said: "Never mind, I have something
  here that will kill an army of rats," and she showed him the arsenic that was
  wrapped in two papers.</p>

  <p>He playfully reproached her for bringing the poison so near his food, and
  she gave it to Clementine, bidding her make a <i>pâte&mdash;mort aux
  rats</i>.</p>

  <p>This incident took place on the Friday night; the invalid seemed better,
  and Marie, sick and fatigued, retired to the ante-chamber or "corridor" room
  that she shared with Mlle. Lebrun.</p>

  <p>She was roused next morning by Mme. Buffière, who asked after her health
  and persuaded her to take a chicken broth of her own making; when this was
  brought Marie drank it all; her sister-in-law entering from the chamber of M.
  Lafarge complained that there was none of this <i>lait de poule</i> left for
  her brother, who wished <i>par sentiment</i> to share his wife's refreshment.
  The two women then agreed that Amena should prepare a second bowl of broth,
  which M. Lafarge would think a portion of that which his wife had drunk.</p>

  <p>When this was brought the patient was asleep; the bowl was, therefore,
  placed on the night-table by the side of Marie's bed, then, after a while,
  taken away by Amena in order that it might be kept hot; when M. Lafarge woke
  he was given this broth and drank half of it.</p>

  <p>M. Bardon arrived at midday, declared the patient better and ordered sops
  of bread, dipped in Bordeaux wine; when Marie gave him these, he complained
  that they burnt his throat and stomach. "No wonder," remarked Marie to Mlle.
  Lebrun. "He has gastric inflammation and they give him wine!"</p>

  <p>That afternoon Magnaud had a business interview with M. Lafarge that
  terribly upset the patient. Upon Marie's protest, the clerk said:</p>

  <p>"Eh, well, madame, if you do not want your husband fatigued, pray sign
  these blank papers and I can get on with the business without bothering M.
  Lafarge."</p>

  <p>Marie, thereupon, very willingly signed several blank pieces of
  paper&mdash;undated, in accordance with the clerk's express desire.</p>

  <p>That evening (the Saturday) Emma Pontier arrived from Uzerche and, as
  Marie was seized with an attack of cramp in the stomach, took over her turn
  of watching by the bed of M. Lafarge, whom with difficulty she induced to
  drink the' medicine ordered by M. Bardon.</p>

  <p>Emma was soon rudely sent out of the sick chamber, which was again
  occupied by the family Lafarge and the two clerks; she joined Marie in her
  room and the two young women discussed the hostile behaviour of their
  relatives and speculated on the matters that were being so constantly and
  secretly discussed during the conferences held in the chamber of Mme. Lafarge
  <i>mère</i>.</p>

  <p>Emma declared her fears that the iron foundry was ruined through
  speculation, but she could not understand the hostility manifested towards
  Marie; at four o'clock in the morning the two young women were roused to
  attend the sick man; he had not had the opiate ordered by the doctor and now
  whispered to his wife to give him this; she prepared the drink and was
  offering it to her husband when the mother snatched it from her hand and
  declared that she had put some "white powder" in it; this was, both Marie and
  Emma declared, powdered gum arabic, to sweeten the draught, but Madame
  Lafarge <i>mère</i> violently sent away the young women, ordering Emma to
  return to Uzerche, and this the girl did at daybreak, promising Marie to
  return soon.</p>

  <p>On the Sunday morning, another scene occurred by the bed of the sick man;
  M. Denis and Mme. Amena were installed there, and when Marie offered her
  husband a drink, Amena snatched it from her; Charles Lafarge,
  half-unconscious, seemed to regard his wife with mingled terror and regretful
  affection.</p>

  <p>M. Fleyniat, the doctor uncle of the patient, arrived at Glandier and had
  a long conference with the Lafarge family; Marie stopped him in the corridor
  and begged him to tell her the truth about her husband's condition.</p>

  <p>M. Fleyniat replied that it was a pity that she had resisted the sending
  for another doctor; upon that she replied that for the last ten days she had
  desired the advice of M. Segeral, but that her mother-in-law had forbidden
  her to summon this doctor; M. Fleyniat seemed astonished at this; there was
  another family conference from which Marie was excluded, and as a result M.
  Denis was sent to fetch not M. Segeral, but another doctor, M. Jules
  Lespinas, from the town of Lubersac.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, M. Fleyniat ordered draughts of tepid water for the patient;
  this prescription was resisted by Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> and her
  daughter, but Marie, despite their harsh protests, spent that afternoon
  giving her husband constant draughts of water. M. Magnaud had another
  interview with M. Lafarge; after this the patient appeared more distressed
  and turned away from his wife when she re-entered his room.</p>

  <p>The family, their hatred for the <i>Parisienne</i> now hardly veiled,
  scornfully ordered Marie to her chamber, but she refused to leave and, taking
  a book, sat, pale and rigid, in a corner of the sick chamber, while the women
  and the two men laughed and gossiped by the light of the oil lamps, M.
  Magnaud finally falling asleep with-his head on the shoulder of Amena.</p>

  <p>Towards two o'clock in the morning Denis returned, bringing M. Lespinas, a
  young man with a self-assured, vulgar air.</p>

  <p>After examining the patient he declared that he was suffering from
  gastro-enteritis, a long, painful but not fatal malady. He then began asking
  Marie Lafarge questions about her tastes and habits&mdash;how she liked
  Glandier after Paris and so on; then, approaching the fire, he put his feet
  on the chimney piece and with a fatuous smile sipped the sugared water that
  Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i>, with many flatteries, brought him.</p>

  <p>Alarmed by several meaning looks that she saw exchanged between the doctor
  and her husband's relatives, Marie demanded what they were concealing from
  her; for answer they all combined in entreating her to preserve her health
  for this long, but not dangerous malady, through which she would have to help
  to nurse her husband. Marie Lafarge then retreated to her own chamber, though
  well aware that their professed care for her health was hypocritical and that
  the new doctor had joined the Lafarge family in a determined hostility
  towards herself. On the next (Monday) morning, she was allowed into her
  husband's room again and saw a frightful change in him; he was of a livid
  pallor, his eyes fixed; she fell on her knees by the bed; the dying man tried
  to speak, his glaring eyes were full of terror, rage and reproach; Marie
  glanced up and saw that the room was crowded with people who were strangers
  to her, relatives and friends of the Lafarge family; all there, like so many
  spies, stared at Marie, whispered together, and regarded her with an
  insatiable curiosity.</p>

  <p>The dying man tried to speak, to touch his wife, but his watchful mother
  at once prevented him; unable to endure the scene, Marie rose and in silence
  left the room; when, a little calmed, she wished to return, she found the
  chamber door locked against her; driven from the "corridor" room she took
  refuge in a guest chamber next to that of her mother-in-law's at the other
  side of the house, where Clementine brought all her possessions.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>That day, Monday, January 16th, 1840, Charles Pouch Lafarge died, without
  his wife's being allowed to see him again; apart from her own servants the
  only people that visited her were Emma and the priest who brought the
  <i>viaticum</i>; the day passed in a state of terror and suspense for the
  widow. Towards evening, Marie, supported by the weeping Emma, was allowed to
  visit the death chamber where again she was subjected to indications of icy
  contempt and hatred on the part of the crowd of relatives and friends.</p>

    <p class="caption">The last moments of M. Lafarge<br>
    From an old engraving in possession of the author.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>In a state of collapse she withdrew and fell into a fit of insensibility
  that lasted until late on the Tuesday morning, when she was roused by the
  lamentations of Emma; warned by this friend to keep her room, Marie passed a
  day of isolation, broken only by a visit from M. Buffière, who, embracing her
  with tears, induced her to sign another paper "<i>pour les affaires</i>."</p>

  <p>Emma and Clementine told the young widow that the Lafarge family had taken
  possession of the entire contents of the house, having packed up the silver
  and sent it to Faye, impounded all papers and so on; Madame Lafarge
  <i>mère</i> had also seized the two bags of money that her son had brought
  from Paris; she declared that she had found in them, not the twenty-five
  thousand francs Charles had said that they contained, but about five hundred
  francs.</p>

  <p>Acting on Emma's advice, Marie found her husband's will that left her
  mistress of Glandier and sent it, by her servant Alfred, to the notary at
  Soissons; she wrote also several letters to her relatives, imploring them to
  come and fetch her home.</p>

  <p>On the Wednesday morning, Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> entered her
  daughter-in-law's room through the hitherto locked door that led to her own
  apartment, and embracing her in a friendly fashion, begged her to visit
  Amena, who was too ill to leave her bed. Marie complied and passed into the
  other room where Mme. Buffière was sitting over the fire, in a disordered
  mourning dress, but not, seemingly, ill; Axnena demanded her brother's patent
  (<i>brevet</i>) that she might cover it with kisses. While Marie was
  protesting that she did not even know where this document was she heard
  violent noises in her room, to which she tried to return but could not, as
  the door was bolted on the inside. Rushing to the outer door, Marie called
  Clementine, who came in considerable agitation, saying that Madame Lafarge
  <i>mère</i> was despoiling her daughter-in-law's room and that a locksmith
  was breaking open her desk.</p>

  <p>"This is infamous!" cried Marie Lafarge; Amena instantly retorted: "My
  mother is mistress here and can do what she likes," and she added that
  Charles had left a later will than that his wife had just sent to Soissons,
  and by this all he possessed (including his wife's dowry) had gone to his
  mother and sister.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards Marie was allowed to re-enter her room and shut herself in
  with Clementine.</p>

  <p>The apartment had been stripped, the desk broken open, all the papers, the
  marriage contract, title deeds, etc., taken away, together with Marie's
  family portraits, her jewellery and girlish souvenirs of Villers-Hellon,
  Strasbourg and Paris.</p>

  <p>While she was still overwhelmed by this outrage Emma entered and cast
  herself into her arms and, sobbing, cried:</p>

  <p>"Marie, they say that you have poisoned Charles! My aunt is saying the
  most frightful things! She tells everyone that you are a murderess!"</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge gasped out some words of astonishment and protest and sank,
  half-unconsciously, on the bed, imploring Emma to tell her the whole
  truth.</p>

  <p>"Marie," stammered the sobbing girl, "you have had arsenic&mdash;two
  parcels&mdash;you spoke of arsenic in that letter you wrote to Charles, the
  first night that you came to Glandier&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, Emma, you <i>know</i> that I am innocent!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marie, they took some chicken broth to M. Bardon&mdash;there was
  white powder on the surface&mdash;the doctor said that it was ash from the
  fire, but M. Eyssartier, the chemist at Brives&mdash;found out that it was
  arsenic! If you made some fatal mistake!"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible! I put some gum in the chicken broth&mdash;such as I ate
  myself, before and after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Marie&mdash;Marie&mdash;that little agate box you had in your apron
  pocket&mdash;that I took from you yesterday&mdash;what did you have in
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Powdered gum."</p>

  <p>"Alas! No. I asked M. Fleyniat to examine that powder&mdash;it is
  arsenic!"</p>

  <p>"Arsenic! Impossible! Your uncle must be mistaken&mdash;calm yourself, I
  beseech you!"</p>

  <p>Both Clementine and Emma, however, continued to weep and lament, talking
  of the Assize court, of prison, of the scaffold, until Marie commanded them
  to fetch M. Fleyniat who was still at Glandier.</p>

  <p>This gentleman entered Marie's chamber with a very embarrassed air,
  assured her, with a good deal of phrase-making, that he considered her
  innocent, then told her the case against her. The family Lafarge asserted
  that the cakes Marie had sent to Paris had been poisoned by her, that she had
  put arsenic in the truffles, in the chicken broth and in other drinks that
  she had given to her husband and had strewn the poison on a piece of flannel
  that had been used to give frictions to the patient.</p>

  <p>Marie, though refusing to take up an attitude of defence, since her tone
  was one of complete innocence, yet remarked that the infamous calumnies were
  easily refuted, since Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> had made the cakes that had
  been sent to Paris and Amena had prepared the chicken broth, and MM. Denis
  and Magnaud had given the sick man his frictions.</p>

  <p>M. Fleyniat seemed unconvinced; he declared that M. Lespinas was certain
  that Lafarge had been poisoned by his wife. M. Fleyniat admitted, however,
  that Denis, when bringing the young doctor from Lubersac, had told him that,
  for a certainty, the <i>Parisienne</i> was dosing a detested husband with
  arsenic, Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i>, Amena and Ann Lebrun having all actually
  <i>seen</i> Marie Lafarge scatter the poison into various drinks. The young
  widow then learnt that, when she had been sent out of the room on the arrival
  of Dr. Lespinas, a frightful scene had taken place. The dying man had been
  told by his mother and the doctor that he had been poisoned by his wife.</p>

  <p>Marie's reply to M. Fleyniat was to press for an autopsy and to demand
  once more the attendance of M. Segeral.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The freely circulated rumours of a crime at Glandier brought the
  magistrate from Lubersac on the scene twenty-four hours after the death, on
  January 15th; this functionary and two of his clerks, with some police
  directed by the father of M. Buffière made a search of the house, turned over
  Marie's books, her remaining papers, examined her packets of gum, of almond
  paste and turned over her clothes.</p>

  <p>No sooner had these officials left the room than Alfred, the manservant
  from Villers-Hellon, broke in, sobbing with distress and alarm:</p>

  <p>"My poor mistress! They say that I shall send you to the scaffold and
  mount it myself!"</p>

  <p>This was the story the poor fellow told when slightly calmed: Clementine
  had given him the arsenic to mix into a paste for the rats; he had forgotten
  to do this, but had left the poison in an old hat on a <i>commode</i> in the
  chamber of M. Lafarge for two days; then, on hearing of the suspicions that
  were being broadcast against his mistress, he had thought to do her a service
  by burying the poison in the garden.</p>

  <p>Several of his fellow-servants had seen him do this, and had told Mme.
  Buffière, who had informed the magistrate from Lubersac. The poison was then
  being sought for by the police.</p>

  <p>Alfred had hardly finished his recital when Mion, the <i>Parisienne</i>
  cook, entered Marie's apartment, indignantly declaring that Madame Lafarge
  <i>mère</i> had accused her to her face of having poisoned the cakes sent to
  Paris, that the family Lafarge were pillaging the house, sending the
  furniture and even the provisions away; she added that the servants and the
  work-people were all very indignant at the accusations against Marie
  Lafarge.</p>

  <p>Towards the evening M. Buffière paid his sister-in-law a visit, affecting
  not to have heard of the poisoning charges nor to know why an autopsy was
  being held on the body of his brother-in-law. He had another paper for Marie
  to sign, but this she refused to do until the doctor's verdict had been
  given, though M. Buffière spoke of bankruptcy, a dishonoured name and so
  on.</p>

  <p>After a day of agonising suspense, the doctors, Bardon, Massenat, Fleyniat
  and Lespinas, announced that there was not the least trace of arsenic in the
  body of Charles Lafarge. Some of the contents of the stomach, however, was to
  be sent to Limoges to be analysed. Dr. Lespinas had tried to say that there
  was arsenic in the corpse and been rebuked by the other doctors.</p>

  <p>To the bottles and vases containing these substances the mother added a
  piece of flannel that, she declared, was covered with a white powder.</p>

  <p>A curious fact now was announced by the police&mdash;the white substance
  that they had dug up in the garden and that Alfred declared to Marie was what
  he had buried, proved not to be arsenic but bicarbonate of soda.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge was now surrounded by people congratulating her on her
  proved innocence, even the <i>gendarmes</i> joining in the general rejoicing.
  The mother, weeping and excusing herself on the score of maternal affection,
  patched up a reconciliation with the daughter-in-law and soon after left
  Glandier with Amena, for Faye; Emma was obliged to return to Uzerche and
  Marie Lafarge remained alone in the stripped and dreary <i>château</i> which
  was placed in the charge of M. Denis.</p>

  <p>The young widow now believed herself fere, even from suspicion and, as
  diligently as her health would permit, made preparations for her return to
  Paris, writing long letters to her relatives and helping Clementine and Mion
  to pack what remained of the exquisite trousseau she had brought from Paris.
  The weather was still wild and cold, continual rains blotted out the prospect
  of the river, the fields, the despoiled woods and the ruins where the masons
  no longer worked on the Gothic cloisters and arches where Marie had hoped to
  see some of her ideals of a feudal <i>château</i> realised.</p>

  <p>All was in disorder in the house; the family Lafarge had taken away
  everything save the largest pieces of furniture, the Parisian muslin curtains
  flapped mournfully at the blank windows, the Pleyel piano looked gaunt and
  out of place in the chamber, bare save for that and the bed, where Charles
  Lafarge had died.</p>

  <p>The carpet and the ornaments had gone from the gloomy <i>salon</i>, and
  Marie's efforts to make the sinister, dirty house attractive had by now left
  no trace.</p>

  <p>The iron foundry was closed; when Madame Lafarge visited the cold forges
  she found several of the work-people idling about, waiting to know the future
  of Glandier; all movable property had been taken from the factory and
  everyone spoke of the enormous number of debts left by the young
  ironmaster.</p>

  <p>Marie advised these workmen to seek employment at a neighbouring
  factory.</p>

  <p>M. Roque, a banker and business associate of the Lafarge family, who had
  shown some consideration towards Marie, now waited on her and asked for
  payment from her dowry of 28,000 francs for money advanced by him to M.
  Lafarge.</p>

  <p>When the widow exclaimed at this large sum, M. Roque showed her the
  guarantees on which he had advanced her husband this money; the most
  important of these was an alleged letter from M. de Violaine, Antonine's
  husband, promising to invest a large sum` in the ironworks.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge at once saw that this was a forgery and said so; thereupon
  M. Roque brought out from his portfolio a mass of papers, all purporting to
  be undertakings by Marie's relatives and friends to put money in
  Glandier.</p>

  <p>All were forged.</p>

  <p>M. Roque exclaimed in anger and dismay that it was well that Charles
  Lafarge had died, since if he had lived he would have gone to the galleys;
  the painful interview ended by the young widow's signing away, for the sake
  of her dead husband's name, 28,000 francs of her dowry to replace the monies
  advanced by M. Roque.</p>

  <p>It was now clear, even to her romantic, inexperienced mind, that she had
  married not only a bankrupt but a criminal, that the tales of his position,
  income and so on, given by Charles Lafarge before his marriage, were so many
  lies. It was also now obvious that all the caresses, considerations and
  indulgences that had been offered her to induce her to remain at Glandier had
  been merely traps to secure her money; her husband's secret will, leaving all
  his property to his mother and sister, after he had obtained a will in his
  favour from his wife, proved this.</p>

  <p>It might also now be guessed that Marie had flattered herself when she had
  taken seriously her husband's love-letters from Paris; he had been merely
  humouring her in order to obtain every <i>sou</i> she possessed&mdash;the
  piano, the bathroom, the work on the ruins had all been offered with the same
  end. None of these amenities was paid for. Marie Lafarge, after a week's
  acquaintance marrying a man whom her uncle had found at a marriage broker's,
  had been grossly deceived and, it appeared, beggared.</p>

  <p>M. Lalande, notary to M. Roque, tried to put a little order into the
  affairs of the unfortunate young woman, and learnt of the will that she had
  sent to her lawyer at Soissons. This M. Lalande told her that her
  mother-in-law was staying at Pompadour and spreading all over the department
  tales against Marie and still adhering to the accusation of poisoning; M.
  Lalande admitted that such was the hatred these two women felt for Marie that
  they had been bitterly disappointed at the result of the autopsy and were
  hoping that arsenic would be found in the organs then being examined by the
  chemists at Limoges.</p>

  <p>M. Lalande added that public opinion at Brives was entirely against
  her&mdash;the stranger, almost regarded as a foreigner&mdash;and that MM.
  Magnaud, Buffière and Denis had spread such tales about her that she had not
  a friend in the Limousin. In conclusion he suggested flight and offered her
  his cabriolet and his wife's passport.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge refused the offer, but, as she was without a <i>sou</i>,
  accepted a loan of several hundred francs from the kindly lawyer.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Soon after Emma Pontier arrived at Glandier with bitter news; M. Buffière
  had sent to the magistrate Marie's letter of August 15th, written on sky-blue
  paper, and other letters stolen from her rifled desk; an immense quantity of
  arsenic had been found in the dregs of chicken broth, on the flannels used
  for frictions, in the little box taken by Emma from Marie's pocket; did not
  all this poison account for the missing lump of arsenic for which had been
  substituted the bicarbonate of soda?</p>

  <p>Here were mysteries that were interpreted in a manner entirely to the
  discredit of Marie Lafarge; Ann Lebrun, ill with an attack of nerves,
  declared her state due to having seen Marie put the arsenic in the broth, and
  M. Denis also told the angry creditors that for fifteen days the
  <i>Parisienne</i> had poisoned her husband, after having ruined him by her
  crazy extravagance.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the month the Public Prosecutor for the department of
  Corrèze, and the magistrate from Brives, visited Glandier and examined M.
  Denis, the servants, and Ann Lebrun summoned from her sick-bed.</p>

  <p>Afterwards they examined Marie Lafarge for the space of three hours; the
  two lawyers behaved with consideration and even sympathy towards the wretched
  young woman whose health was so obviously ruined, whose situation, innocent
  or guilty, was so forlorn, so frightful, whose surroundings were so sordid
  and globmy. The result of the interview, during which Marie had wept,
  lamented and shown every symptom of despair, was that the Public Prosecutor,
  M. Rivet, announced that she would be arrested and conducted by
  <i>gendarmes</i> to the prison at Brives.</p>

  <p>The scene of despair that followed was only relieved by the offers of Emma
  and Clementine to share the misfortunes of Marie, and even her cell. This
  offer was refused by the police. M. Brugère, a local lawyer, who had offered
  to protect the accused woman's interests, waited on the Prosecutor-General,
  M. Dumont Saint-Priest, at Limoges, and asked the favour of escorting the
  prisoner and her maid to Brives in his own carriage, with a police guard.</p>

  <p>M. Dumont Saint-Priest, however, had already listened to the stories of
  Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i> and her allies and had accepted their view of the
  odious conduct of Marie&mdash;he therefore refused all favours to a
  <i>monstre</i> as he termed the young widow. Marie waited, under arrest and a
  guard of <i>gendarmes</i> in Glandier, for the result of M. Brugère's
  appeal.</p>

  <p>M. Denis continued to reside in the desolate house and one evening broke
  into Marie's chamber, completely drunk, exulting in her terrible misfortune,
  jeering at her "head of a Princess" that would soon roll on the scaffold,
  reminding her that she had thought herself too good to sit at the same table
  with himself and adding that she would soon find herself in prison, in
  company with the most degraded of women.</p>

  <p>To rid herself of this man, Marie was forced to call one of the police to
  her assistance.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On a windy, wet morning at one o'clock, at the end of January, in the
  complete dark, Marie Lafarge left Glandier under circumstances even more
  dismal than those that had marked her miserable arrival at this gloomy
  abode.</p>

  <p>She went on horseback, riding Arabska, the companion of her romantic
  rides, with the mounted police closing in on her on every side and a peasant
  to guide the party across the mountains to Vigeois, where a carriage awaited
  the prisoner.</p>

  <p>She had been a kind mistress and the servants, work-people and peasants
  who gathered by torch and lantern light to see this tragic departure, called
  down blessings on her head, and expressed their belief in her innocence.</p>

  <p>The rain increased as the cavalcade made a painful progress under the bare
  trees, the black skies, along the steep, slippery paths. By the time the dawn
  cast a melancholy light through the forest, the guide had lost his way, and
  the prisoner herself was forced to act as guide. Marie was soaked to the
  skin; one of the <i>gendarmes</i> gave her his mantle to cover her shivering
  shoulders and his huge gloves to slip over her icy hands.</p>

  <p>After five hours of this toilsome progress, Marie arrived at Vigeois;
  there she found M. Fleyniat, who offered to accompany her to Brives.</p>

  <p>Half-way to this town the prisoner was in a state of collapse and had to
  rest several hours at a wayside inn, so that it was late in the winter day
  when the solitary carriage with the drenched escort of police drove into the
  main square of Brives, where the prison was situated. A large crowd had
  gathered, and cries of hate, fury and contempt assailed the ears of the
  exhausted woman as the police forced a way through the press for the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>Soon the door of the prison cell closed on Marie Lafarge; she stumbled
  into her cell and flung herself on the narrow bed above which hung, on the
  bare walls, the gaunt outlines of the crucifix. On hearing of her arrest M.
  de Léautaud had accused her of steal-ing his wife's diamonds.</p>

  <p>She was even more unfortunate than she knew; the police, in searching her
  room, had come upon a green silk bag containing several loose diamonds and
  broken settings, oddly overlooked by the family Lafarge in their search, or
  replaced by them before the arrival of the police, and these had been
  identified by M. de Léautaud as those stolen from his wife the previous
  summer; Marie Lafarge had to face two charges, murder and theft, at the same
  time.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-07"
     id="ch-03-07"></a>7. ON TRIAL FOR THEFT AND MURDER</h3>

  <p>From the day (January 15th, 1840) that she was lodged in the prison at
  Brives, Marie Cappelle, Widow Lafarge, became a figure of international
  importance. Her extraordinary case, her remarkable story was discussed with
  the greatest interest and even passion, not only in France but abroad.</p>

  <p>In her native country the newspapers, which devoted columns every day to
  the <i>affaire Lafarge</i>&mdash;which promised to be the most remarkable of
  <i>causes céièbres</i>&mdash;declared that France was more interested in
  Marie Lafarge than in the Eastern war or the future of the Monarchy. The
  Limoges chemists who had analysed the organs of Charles Lafarge declared that
  he had died of arsenical poisoning.</p>

  <p>Opinions were sharply divided. Behind Marie Lafarge were, in solid
  support, her family, her friends (who hastened to Brives), her servants,
  everyone who had known her from her childhood&mdash;the tenantry at
  Villers-Hellon, the acquaintances whom she had made at Strasbourg and in
  Paris; these, and they included members of some of the most distinguished,
  wealthy and aristocratic families in France, protested her complete innocence
  with warm indignation and gave her the best of characters, declaring, from
  their personal knowledge, that she had always been generous, high-minded,
  warm-hearted, loving, pious and highly intelligent. The intellectuals and the
  young romantics who followed them were, with very few exceptions, also of
  this opinion; to them Marie Lafarge, now described as beautiful and without
  dispute as elegant, seductive and fastidious, refined in manners, delicate in
  health, was the outraged victim of the odious machinations of the vile family
  to whom, most unfortunately, she had been united by a disastrous marriage. In
  the view of her champions Marie Lafarge was a woman deeply wronged; she had
  been trapped into marriage with a criminal, a man on the verge of fraudulent
  bankruptcy, she had been treated with the greatest hostility and harshness by
  his ignorant and grasping relatives, her generous inexperience had been taken
  advantage of to strip her of her property by one means or another, and
  finally the vindictive hatred of the Lafarge family had risen to such a
  height that they had combined to fabricate an accusation against the
  unfortunate Parisian.</p>

  <p>As regards the nature of the death of Charles Lafarge, Marie's supporters
  were divided in opinion; some thought that he had died of gastro-enteritis,
  others believed that a criminal, but not Mme. Lafarge, had poisoned the young
  ironmaster, while a third opinion was that arsenic had been introduced into
  the sick man's drinks by error.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the middle classes, the common people, and nearly the
  whole of the Limousin, were violently prejudiced against Marie Lafarge.
  Besides her late husband's family and their numerous relatives, a solid body
  of local opinion depicted her, in the favourite term of her enemies, as a
  "monster." The basis of their case against her was the famous letter of
  August 15th, written on sky-blue paper, in which she had declared herself to
  be in the possession of arsenic and in love with another man than her
  husband. The prisoner was painted by these people as a consummate hypocrite,
  completely false, crafty and malicious, who, from the moment she had seen the
  wretched state of Glandier and realised how distasteful to her her husband
  was, had resolved to feign a resignation to her fate in order to free herself
  by violent means.</p>

  <p>All these aspects of the <i>affalre Lafarge</i> were discussed with a
  freedom, a passion, a prejudice that augured ill for a cool investigation
  into the proofs. All sorts of tales, rumours, slanders and innuendoes about
  Marie Lafarge were industriously circulated by her enemies, while her friends
  on their side were busy depicting hei as a saint.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>From January to August Marie Lafarge remained in prison at Brives awaiting
  trial, Her case was extraordinarily complicated and greatly enhanced in
  interest in the public estimation by M. de Léautaud's accusation of theft.
  The discovery of Marie de Nicolai's diamonds in Marie Lafarge's possession
  had been a severe blow to the lawyers who had first taken up her defence.
  These were two local advocates, Theodore Bac and that Charles Lachaud, the
  handsome young man whom Marie had met in Tulle after seeing him so
  successfully defend the poor young woman in the Assize court. This lawyer,
  though possessing only a provincial practice, was intelligent, eloquent, and
  appeared to be on the verge of a most successful career; he had, on hearing
  of the accusation against Mme. Lafarge, offered his services with enthusiasm,
  being, as he declared, completely convinced of her innocence.</p>

  <p>When these two lawyers visited Marie in her prison and asked her to
  account for the possession of the diamonds, she told them at first that the
  jewels were her own, adding these mysterious words:</p>

  <p>"They were sent me by a relation whose name I don't know, who lives I
  don't know where&mdash;at Toulouse, I believe. They were sent me by some
  means that I don't know of."</p>

  <p>In despair at these pitiful evasions, Marie's defenders told her that the
  jewels had been identified as those belonging to Mme. de Léautaud and that a
  charge of theft had been lodged against her in the name of M. de Léautaud.
  Pressed to give a more reasonable reply, she said, still with an air of
  mystery:</p>

  <p>"The person from whom I had these diamonds will not long allow me to be
  suspected."</p>

  <p>There was a general opinion that M. de Léautaud might have withheld the
  charge of theft until that of murder had been tried; but not only did he
  accuse Marie Lafarge of stealing his wife's diamonds during her visit to the
  <i>château</i> of Busagny in June or August, 1839, but he added, in an
  attempt to destroy the moral character of the accused, a number of complaints
  against her behaviour.</p>

  <p>These accusations, which were of petty theft, lying and cheating, were
  corroborated by Mme. de Montbreton and other relatives of the family
  Léautaud. Marie, in the document in which she was accused of stealing the
  diamonds, was described as having, ever since she was a child, stolen objects
  of value from her family and friends&mdash;money, jewellery, parcels and
  letters that were not addressed to her, and even laces and chiffon from
  shops&mdash;indeed represented "as essentially corrupt."</p>

  <p>When told of these charges Mme. Lafarge denied them with a disdain too
  deep to be indignant and only expressed herself as amazed at the pettiness of
  her friends; she then accounted for the possession of the diamonds by the
  following story given to her lawyers, that she declared she only divulged
  because of her own great danger, and that, if Mme. de Léautaud had not proved
  herself thus vindictive, nothing would have induced her to disclose.</p>

  <p>She stated that when she had been on her famous visit the summer before to
  Marie de Nicolai, that young woman had been in a state of considerable
  agitation on the subject of M. Felix Clavé; although Marie told her friend
  that she had had a letter from the young man dated from Algiers, Mme. de
  Léautaud insisted that she had seen him on the boards of the opera, where he
  had a place in the chorus; she had emphasised the jealousy of her husband,
  her terror lest this schoolgirl romance might come to light, and her fear
  that M. Clavé would begin blackmailing her on the strength of the
  love-letters of hers that he possessed; so deep had been the lady's agitation
  that Marie, though her modesty as an unmarried woman did not allow her to
  probe the matter, had a slight suspicion that the affair with the handsome
  young Spaniard had gone much further than she knew of, and that there really
  was some most compromising secret that might ruin the honour and the family
  peace of her friend.</p>

  <p>Therefore, according to her story, after much pressure she had agreed to
  take the diamonds, to break them up, to sell them in Paris, and to send the
  proceeds intact to M. Clavé as the price of his silence. At this time she had
  believed that she was going to marry M. Delvaux, the brother of Mme. de
  Léautaud's governess, and he was to help her in the scheme. Still, according
  to Mme. Lafarge's story, a mock robbery was staged in the <i>château</i>;
  Mme. de Léautaud kept the jewels first in her own room, then took them to
  that of Marie Cappelle. The two young women between them broke up the
  <i>parure</i>, using scissors and the heels of their shoes for this purpose;
  when the diamonds were all separated and the settings broken, Madame de
  Léautaud presented two pearls and a diamond to her friend, partly as a
  wedding present and partly in exchange for a loan of 180 francs that Marie
  had given her before her marriage; these were the jewels that Marie had been
  seen wearing at Glandier.</p>

  <p>When her brief engagement to M. Delvaux was broken off, Marie Cappelle
  begged her friend to take back the diamonds, upon which Mme. de Léautaud made
  a frightful scene, declared that she could do nothing of the kind, and begged
  Marie to take them to Paris and to keep them until she had an opportunity of
  selling them.</p>

  <p>When some weeks afterwards Marie became engaged to M. Lafarge, she again
  wrote to her friend declaring that she no longer wanted the responsibility of
  keeping the jewels and asking what she should do with them, to which Mme. de
  Léautaud replied that she was to keep them for the present. Marie then took
  the jewels with her to Glandier, where she kept them concealed in her desk.
  One day, shortly after the violent illness in which her life had been
  despaired of, her husband brought her in a basket of apples and, playing
  about with one of these, broke a window; it was impossible to get a glazier
  immediately, and Marie thought that she would use one of Mme. de Léautaud's
  diamonds to cut some glass; she fetched the stone out for this purpose and
  thereby revealed her possession of these valuable gems to her husband. He
  expressed his astonishment, and she told him the entire story; upon which he
  suggested that the diamonds should be sold, the money they fetched invested
  in the iron foundry, and Mme. de Léautaud paid 10 per cent on her capital.
  Marie Lafarge then wrote to Mme de Léautaud to this effect, but received no
  reply. The diamonds were put back in her desk and she had forgotten all about
  them during the tragedy of her husband's illness, until they had been
  discovered by the police.</p>

  <p>Such was the story given by Mme. Lafarge to account for her possession of
  her friend's diamonds, and she gave it with a smiling, happy, even triumphant
  air&mdash;being delighted, as she said, to be able to prove how loyal she had
  been to her friend.</p>

  <p>M. Bac then went to Paris, waited on Mme. de Léautaud, told her the story
  that his client had told him, and gave her the following letter from Marie
  Cappelle:</p>

  <p class="letter">Marie, may God never harm you as you are harming me! Alas,
  I know you are good, but you are also weak! You thought that I, accused of an
  atrocious crime, could endure yet another infamy. I entrusted to your honour
  the care of mine. You have not spoken. The day of justice has arrived! Marie,
  in the name of your conscience, of our common past, save me! Without doubt I
  do wrong to remind you of that past, but there are some positions in which
  one is forced to forget delicacy, and I know not on which brow the blush
  should be. Would you have my death to reproach yourself with? Oh, without a
  doubt I shall not survive. I shall die. But before the priest absolves me of
  my sin, before my friends, before Christ I shall say that I die your victim,
  that I am innocent, that I desire to be rehabilitated in my tomb. I shall
  leave my memory in the hearts of my friends. When I am dead, Marie, they will
  weep for me, they will avenge me&mdash;your weakness will be a crime and a
  dishonour. There is only one thing you can do now. You must write a letter
  dated last June, in which you declare that you have confided your diamonds to
  me, with authorisation to sell them if I deem it proper to do so. This will
  stop the whole affair. You can then explain your conduct as you choose to
  your husband. All your letters will be sent back to you and the most profound
  secrecy will guarantee your honour and your repose. Adieu. Understand
  clearly, Marie, that you can save me. I have endured a martyrdom of two
  months. You have forgotten me. I would have given you my life, but my
  reputation, the hearts of my friends, the honour of my sister, never!</p>

  <p>Maître Bac met with the reception that he had sadly expected. Mme. de
  Léautaud denied absolutely Marie Lafarge's story, and rejected her appeal as
  a piece of wicked insolence. She declared that she had not seen M. Clavé for
  three years; it had been the merest schoolgirl adventure into which she had
  been led by Marie Cappelle. She had never told her friend that she was afraid
  of blackmail. Both she and her husband took Marie Lafarge's defence as the
  grossest of outrages and were resolved to press the case.</p>

  <p>Maître Lachaud then came to Paris, waited upon Mme. de Léautaud and
  pressed his client's cause, begging that the charge might at least be held
  over till that of murder had been faced. Mme. de Léautaud and her husband
  were adamant; they declared their honour to be at stake; they had no pity for
  Mme. Lafarge, whom they depicted as a woman who had been corrupt from early
  childhood, who was a liar, a thief, and, as it now seemed, a murderess.</p>

  <p>The public found this business of the diamonds so exciting that for a
  while the question of the murder went into the background. Nothing, to the
  mind of the French people, could have been more sensational than these
  counter-accusations between two young women of such high rank, such refined
  upbringing, such distinguished and wealthy connections. It was a case in
  which it was almost impossible to come at the truth; it was a question of one
  woman's word against another's, and the word of Mme. Lafarge, a woman who,
  after five months of marriage, had been arrested for the murder of her
  husband by arsenic, was already suspect; on the other hand, her tale about M.
  Clavé was temptingly romantic, dramatic and, possibly, scandalous.</p>

  <p>The case of the diamonds was to be heard on July 9th at Tulle. Marie
  Lafarge's lawyers pleaded for a delay under the excuse that it was impossible
  for them to get their defence together in so short a time. Above all they
  wished to get M. Felix Clavé, the romantic young Spaniard, as a witness, and
  he had disappeared in Africa. This delay was refused, and public opinion was
  astonished that a misdemeanour (a <i>délit</i>) should be heard while that of
  a felony (a <i>crime</i>) was still in suspense.</p>

  <p>Hot passions and strong prejudices were excited on each side; there were
  whispers of influence used for and against the prisoner; while her friends
  and partisans increased in their arduous championship, it seemed as if the
  Government and the Tribunal at Limoges were not only prejudiced but incensed
  against her, and prepared to go any lengths to secure her conviction, and
  that the charge of theft was being hurried on to damage the prisoner's
  character before the murder charge was examined. Why there should be this
  animosity to Marie Lafarge is not quite clear. The influence of the family
  Lafarge and their relatives could not have been so extremely powerful in the
  Limousin, especially since the ruin of the iron foundry and the disgrace
  attending the bankruptcy of the dead man; but some powerful influence did
  seem at work against Marie Lafarge.</p>

  <p>The secret that she and her aunts had termed "the secret of the cradle"
  was now common property. The story was circulated, and by most people
  believed that her grandmother, Mme. Collard, had been not the daughter of an
  English colonel, but the child of Philippe-Egalité and Mme. de Genlis,
  audaciously introduced by the intriguing <i>gouvernante</i> into the
  household where she educated her royal pupils. If this tale was true, Marie
  Cappelle (she often reverted to her own name and used Cappelle as frequently
  as she used Lafarge) was a great-niece of Louis-Philippe; this relationship
  was supposed to be a strong handicap to the prisoner, since neither the
  democratic King nor his Ministers dare show any favour to the descendant of
  an illegitimate Bourbon. Their feeling was rather that it would be better for
  her to be sacrificed to plebeian resentment than to allow the nation to
  suppose that a drop of royal blood would secure special favours for one
  suspected of an atrocious crime.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>While the battle round Mme. Lafarge divided France there was no doubt of
  her own success in her extraordinary role of prisoner. No longer a spoilt
  young aristocrat, romantic, ailing and capticious, nor the suspected, defiant
  and hopelessly out-of-place young city-bred wife immured in the dismal
  country village, but a public character, Marie Lafarge filled her part as
  successfully as a great actress stepping on the boards in a favourite
  part.</p>

  <p>She made a conquest of everyone who approached her; her lawyers became her
  enthusiastic and devoted champions. In the heart of Charles Lachaud this
  sentiment soon became tinged with a romantic passion. The prisoners, the
  jailers, the doctors who attended on her in her frequent fits of ill-health,
  in fact all who came in contact with her declared her to be not only
  innocent, but a saint. She had a power of looks, of words, of gestures, of
  deportment that was truly enchanting; she showed neither despair, nor
  irritability, neither temper nor fear, but bore herself in a manner that all
  agreed was of perfect decorum and of dignity.</p>

  <p>She soon gained such an empire over the other prisoners that their manners
  and ways of life entirely changed; whenever she appeared at exercise in the
  public yard, at service in the chapel, in passing between her cell and the
  room where her lawyers and the magistrates examined her so continually,
  decency and decorum reigned. Her appearance, the delicate state of her health
  were also greatly in Marie's favour; she was, all the young intellectuals
  declared enthusiastically, a "true romantic" with her huge, dark eyes, her
  pale face, her masses of black hair like bands of crape, her air of enigma,
  of mystery, her pathetic resignation under the hideous charges brought
  against her.</p>

  <p>She received, before her case was heard for the first time on July 9th, at
  Brives, about a thousand letters of sympathy, many of them containing verses
  and poems written in her honour, offers of assistance and requests for her
  hand in marriage.</p>

  <p>With the feverish energy so often possessed by delicate and over-wrought
  women, Marie Lafarge answered most of these with her own hands, besides
  writing voluminous letters, couched in an extravagant, romantic and emotional
  style, to all her friends and supporters and putting together notes for her
  memoirs.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After having struggled in vain for a delay that she herself did not wish
  for, Marie's lawyers in despair were forced to advise her to allow the case
  to go by default, since, in the absence of witnesses, she had no defence.</p>

  <p>When she appeared before the <i>tribunal de police correctionnelle</i> at
  Brives a large crowd of elegant spectators were crushed into the court, "that
  had been decorated as if for a spectacle." With a deplorable disregard of the
  dignity of the law, rich and aristocratic people, mostly women, had been
  allowed to push out the inhabitants of Brives and fill the benches of the
  <i>salle d'audience</i> with their elegant <i>toilettes</i>, floating plumes,
  scarves and parasols, and the air with their senseless gossip.</p>

  <p>Since Mme. Lafarge had been advised to offer no defence&mdash;she had
  none, especially in the absence of M. Clavé&mdash;these proceedings were but
  a sad travesty of justice. They, however, gave the prisoner a chance of
  showing her moving beauty, her elegance and the exact propriety of her sad
  demeanour. She confronted with the most exquisite calm the curious, hostile
  and heartless glances of the men and women of her own rank who had thronged
  to see her in her disgrace.</p>

  <p>Her lawyers again tried to get the case postponed, first because the
  <i>crime</i> of which the prisoner was accused ought to be tried before the
  <i>délit</i>, secondly because there had not been time to prepare a
  defence.</p>

  <p>The case however going against her, owing to default, she was sentenced to
  two years' imprisonment for the theft of the diamonds and, on August 6th, she
  was transferred to the prison in the Assize town of Tulle; the murder charge
  had to be heard at the Assizes.</p>

  <p>The public interest was whipped up to fever pitch by the news that a young
  chemist of Montbédy had committed suicide when he learned of Marie Cappelle's
  sentence. He was consumptive and, it seemed, had several years ago seen and
  secretly fallen in love with Marie Cappelle, to whom he had addressed a
  series of romantic letters&mdash;to which she had replied with some
  tenderness. This suicide gave the final "aureole of romance" to the figure of
  the mysterious prisoner.</p>

  <p>Her lawyers appealed against the conviction for theft; this was quashed by
  the Court of Appeal at Tulle on the ground that the appeal should have been
  heard before the case was proceeded with, and on September 3rd the charge of
  theft was heard again.</p>

  <p>Still the prisoner had no witnesses to bring on her behalf and the family
  Léautaud had added to the list of theirs that were all relatives, friends or
  servants of their own. The case against the prisoner seemed unanswerable and
  her moral character was severely aspersed by the stream of witnesses brought
  by M. Corali, M. de Léautaud's vehement and skilful lawyer, to prove all her
  youthful faults and errors.</p>

  <p>As the case proceeded, however, one witness&mdash;and that a curious
  one&mdash;appeared for the defence. This was a certain M. Clavé (no relation
  to M. Felix Clavé) who was employed in the Administration of the Military
  Hospital at Algiers; he, by letter, made the following voluntary
  statement.</p>

  <p>He said that towards the month of November or December, 1839, a parcel had
  been sent to his address. He did not think that it was really intended for
  himself and tried to find if there was anyone else of the same name resident
  in Algiers. Finally he discovered at the Regency Hôtel M. Felix Clavé, who
  said that the box had come from Madame de Léautaud and contained
  water-colours.</p>

  <p>If this story was correct Mme. de Léautaud had been telling a lie when she
  said that she had had no communication with the romantic young Spaniard since
  1836.</p>

  <p>Maître Corali, Mme. de Léautaud's lawyer, declared that this statement was
  false or given in error, and that, given time, he would prove that the parcel
  had not come from his client.</p>

  <p>In conclusion the Tribunal of Tulle suspended the affair of the diamonds
  indefinitely, until the criminal charge had been tried.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge's family engaged, for her defence on the murder charge,
  Maître Paillet, a Parisian lawyer, who retained Maître Bac and Maître Lachaud
  as his assistants.</p>

  <p>The trial took place at the Tulle Assizes of Corrèze on September 3rd,
  before a Limousin jury, most of whom were illiterate and few of whom took any
  trouble to disguise their dislike of the <i>Parisienne</i>, against whom they
  took sides as a foreigner who had brought ruin upon a local family; a
  preliminary enquiry had already been held before <i>la chambre des mises en
  accusation</i>.</p>

  <p>The prosecution was confided to Maître Decous, the Solicitor-General
  (<i>avocat général</i>), a lawyer renowned for his partiality and his fiery
  eloquence.</p>

  <p>Before the trial came on Mme. Lafarge's lawyers suggested to her that as
  her husband's estate was shortly to be declared bankrupt, she should put in
  her claim for the 100,000 francs, the amount of her dowry, which he had had.
  This she refused to do, not wishing, she said, with her grand, romantic air,
  "to tarnish the name that she had borne."</p>

  <p>The trial opened in a tense atmosphere of emotion, passion, recrimination,
  prejudice and partiality. There seemed to be little pretence of endeavouring
  to ascertain the truth, at least on the part of the prosecution, but rather a
  question of setting one conviction against another conviction.</p>

  <p>Strangers had crowded Tulle for days; witnesses and sensation-mongers
  filled the hotels, every house let rooms at high prices; the idle
  <i>élégantes</i> and their escorts besieged the <i>Palais de Justice</i> at
  five o'clock in the morning though the doors were not open until half-past
  seven; three thousand people were pressed into the <i>salle d'audience</i>,
  which had been decorated like a theatre for this dramatic occasion. A special
  <i>tribune</i> had been built for ladies near the entrance door.</p>

  <p>Amid a profound "sensation" Marie Lafarge entered, pale, all in black,
  with downcast eyes, elegantly drawing about her slender person the immense
  flounces of her crape skirt; when she heard whisperings among the audience
  that was feasting so eagerly on her tragedy, she raised her eyes and in the
  words of a witness, "<i>le feu de ses regards resplendit dans la salle</i>."
  It was remarked that "the long tortures of her captivity" had not broken her
  spirit or dimmed the dark brilliance of her glance.</p>

  <p>The conduct of the trial caused immense surprise, not only in England,
  where it was taken as a glaring example of the French maladministration of
  justice, but in France itself.</p>

  <p>The <i>arrêt</i> or <i>acte d'accusation</i>, read aloud in court, was a
  bitter diatribe against the prisoner. Maître Decous took the same tone that
  Maître Corali had taken, and addressed the prisoner as a criminal already
  condemned to suffer for the most atrocious of crimes. There seemed to be no
  doubt from the first in the minds of the prosecuting lawyers, of the judge
  and of the jury, that Marie Cappelle, Widow Lafarge, was guilty of murder,
  and moreover, "corrupt."</p>

  <p>The eloquence of M. Decous knew no restraint. He used the grandiose,
  high-flown, pompous, sentimental style of his day, but used it in excess. His
  opening address was full of inaccuracies, and his appeal was not to cool
  reason and deliberate justice, but to sentiment and emotionalism. His
  <i>arrêt</i>, drawn up by himself and read before the Court, seemed more like
  a highly-coloured novel than a legal document; in glowing colours he painted
  the murdered man as a model of all the virtues, a prosperous manufacturer, a
  loving husband, son and brother who, falling tenderly in love with what he
  considered a charming young woman, was, "by this fiend in female shape,"
  slowly poisoned.</p>

  <p>M. Decous drew a terrible picture of the sufferings of Charles Lafarge,
  dying by inches in the presence of his old mother, his sister, his faithful
  clerks and retainers&mdash;while the wife, surrounded with her perfidious
  servants, stood coolly by his bedside, administering powerful doses of
  arsenic in every drink she gave him.</p>

  <p>The fiery prosecutor declared that Marie Lafarge had changed the cakes her
  mother-in-law had made and that instead of the four little buns that the old
  woman had so lovingly cooked for her son, the malignant wife placed in the
  box with her portrait a large cake liberally dosed with arsenic. It was
  indeed proved by the servant who had been present when Charles Lafarge had
  opened the parcel that the small cakes made by his mother had somehow been
  changed into one large cake. It was also proved that the string and seals
  that Marie Lafarge had put on the parcel in the presence of her mother-in-law
  and Ann Lebrun had been meddled with; there was no proof, however, where and
  how this had been done, whether in Glandier or in the post.</p>

  <p>M. Decous's case was also that when Charles Lafarge, already suffering
  from poisoning, had returned home, his wife had immediately given him some
  more poison in the truffles that he had shared with her during his first meal
  after his homecoming, and after that, coming to an end of her poison bought
  on December 12th, five days before the sending of the cakes, she had bought
  more supplies through M. Denis, from the chemist, M. Eyssartier, on January
  5th. The family, the charge continued, by now having become extremely
  suspicious of her manceuvres, had kept a watch on her, with the result that
  the two women, Mme. Lafarge the elder and Ann Lebrun, both declared they had
  seen her strew white powder in the chicken broth and in other drinks. They
  had preserved what was left of the broth sediment and taken it in the bowl to
  the chemist; he had discovered that it contained enough arsenic to poison ten
  people. Emma Pontier, in great distress at these suspicions cast on her
  beloved cousin, had taken the little agate box supposed to be full of
  powdered gum that Marie kept in her apron and given it to her doctor uncle,
  M. Fleyniat, who had found this also to be arsenic.</p>

  <p>Not content with this, Marie Lafarge, according to the accusations, had
  strewn arsenic also on the flannels with which her unfortunate husband was
  receiving frictions. At last the family, in desperation, had sent M. Denis
  into Lubersac for another doctor, M. Lespinas, telling him that Charles
  Lafarge was dying from arsenical poisoning administered by his wife. The
  doctor, when he arrived at Glandier in the middle of the night and examined
  the patient, agreed with this opinion. Marie Cappelle was sent out of the
  room and the dying man was told that his death was owing to poison that had
  been given him by his wfe. A frightful scene followed and when Marie had
  tried again to come into her husband's chamber he repelled her with terror
  and hatred.</p>

  <p>Out of this highly-coloured tirade only a few undisputed facts emerged.
  The principal of these were the two purchases of arsenic, on December 12th,
  1839, one ordered on the 5th and received on janbary loth, 1840. It was also
  a fact, and one hardly in favour of the prisoner, that when the white
  substance buried by the frightened servant Alfred in the garden had been dug
  up by the police, it was found to be not arsenic but bicarbonate of soda.
  What, then, had become of the large quantity of arsenic bought by Marie
  through M. Denis on January 10th.</p>

  <p>The prosecution pointed out triumphantly that this was precisely the
  arsenic found in a pot discovered in the <i>commode</i>, found in the chicken
  broth, on the flannels, in the agate box, and in the internal organs of
  Charles Lafarge. There were also some particles of white powder found strewn
  upon a <i>commode</i> and the same kind of particles in the pocket of Marie
  Lafarge's apron; these were all proved to be arsenic.</p>

  <p>M. Decous also emphasised the atrocious sufferings of Charles Lafarge, the
  agonies through which his mother and sister had passed, the misery of this
  loving family, and in brief, spared no emotional touch likely to blacken the
  character of Marie Lafarge or arouse pity for her alleged victim and his
  family. The whole of his address was couched in terms of contempt, fury and
  loathing, nor did he make the least pretence of impartiality. The prisoner
  listened to this bitter eloquence with perfect calm, gently coughing,
  languidly smelling her <i>vinaigrette</i>.</p>

  <p>The soberer spirits among the packed audience felt that it was indeed
  unnecessary to hold a trial, since the prisoner appeared to be regarded as
  condemned in advance.</p>

  <p>The trial lasted four weeks and, apart from the display of emotionalism
  and theatricalism that would not have been tolerated in an English Court of
  Law, presented several examples of procedure highly reprehensible from the
  point of view of British jurisprudence. For example, a large number of
  witnesses were heard who had only hearsay evidence to give; gossip, rumour
  and spiteful, exaggerated tales of servants and peasants were accepted as
  evidence. Then again, the affair of the diamonds was sub judice and had
  nothing whatever to do with the murder of Charles Lafarge, but was brought in
  to damage Marie's moral character: and M. Decous allowed himself to address
  the prisoner in this fashion during his long, highly-coloured diatribe; after
  telling the story of the alleged murder, he added:</p>

  <p>"I wish, gentlemen, that I could confine myself to this exposition,
  already so long; I wish that it was not my duty now to call your attention to
  other facts and to impress upon the forehead of this woman the brand of
  another ignominy not resulting from the present accusation. Why did she not
  herself wish to save me this painful task? In place of striving against the
  evidence, in place of irritating justice&mdash;if justice can be
  irritated&mdash;by a system of defence which is in itself a crime, if she had
  confessed herself guilty of the charge of stealing the diamonds that has been
  preferred against her, I should, in bringing before you this evidence of her
  character, experience a feeling of pain."</p>

  <p>After thus admitting that there was no connection between the two charges
  of murder and theft, M. Decous summed up in the following strain:</p>

  <p>"By the side of this most infamous theft is thus placed the most infamous
  defamation in the world&mdash;calumny, another species of poisoning, moral
  poisoning, which kills not the body, but which kills honour. Do you hear
  that, Marie Cappelle?"</p>

  <p>According to that French law which always bears so hard upon the accused,
  the presiding judge himself cross-examined the prisoner, using a severe and,
  at times, hostile tone. She had already been fully examined by the
  vice-President of the Tribunal of Tulle, and she had had no more to add to
  what she had stated on that occasion. By the more moderate-minded class of
  people who had studied the case, and they were but few, her tale as told by
  herself in her various examinations did not seem to justify the accusations
  hurled at her by the <i>avocat général</i>.</p>

  <p>Her manner was approved by all; not even her enemies denied her touching
  dignity, her moving grace and the unexceptionable propriety with which she
  gave her modest, respectful answers; only, while her champions declared that
  all these charms were owing to her spotless innocence, her enemies declared
  that they were produced by the skilful acting of a heartless hypocrite.</p>

  <p>Her famous letter of August 15th, written on sky-blue paper, seemed to the
  judge an extraordinary, even a criminal, document, and he listened with much
  scepticism to the prisoner's explanation that gradually took the form of her
  version of her life story.</p>

  <p>She declared that, as she was left an orphan with a moderate fortune, her
  family were anxious to provide for her an establishment by means of a
  husband. She did not know that they had gone to a matrimonial agent to obtain
  one; she married for the sake of the position a husband could give her, and
  she was led by the representations of her family and of Lafarge himself to
  believe that she was about to become the mistress of a comfortable and even
  elegant household.</p>

  <p>Married at twenty-three years of age after an acquaintance with her future
  husband of a few days, being romantic in temperament and delicate in health,
  she was alarmed and startled&mdash;almost beyond her powers of self-control
  to conceal&mdash;when she found herself separated from all she had known
  through life and in the absolute power of the stranger who was her husband.
  The painful scenes that took place on her journey to the Limousin, notably
  that in the <i>hôtel</i> at Orleans when her husband had tried to force his
  way into her room when she was in the bath, so excited and heated her mind,
  she declared, that she was in a state almost of frenzy when she arrived at
  Glandier and found it a rude, dilapidated and wretched habitation ruled over
  by two women who seemed to her by education and appearance to be little
  better than upper servants and run by the peasants termed domestics.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge, answering the dry, unsympathetic questions of the judge,
  declared that in a fit of agony she wrote to her husband the wild and
  desperate letter of August 15th in the foolish hope of regaining her liberty.
  She declared:</p>

  <p>"I was in such despair at my position, I desired so much that M. Lafarge
  should allow me to go away, that I said things the most inconceivable and
  false in order to obtain my wish."</p>

  <p>Pressed by the judge to explain why she had put so many falsehoods in her
  letter, the prisoner replied:</p>

  <p>"I beg of you to have some indulgence towards me. I left my home the day
  after my marriage, I left my family, I found myself isolated from all the
  world, at Orleans I had with my husband an extremely disagreeable scene. In
  truth, I was extremely wretched during the whole journey. When I arrived at
  Glandier, in place of that charming country house with which they had lured
  me, I found a dilapidated and ruined habitation. I found myself alone, shut
  up in a large desolate chamber that was to be mine for life. I lost my
  reason. I had an idea of travelling to the East. I thought of all those
  things, the contrast, and my imagination was excited. I was so wretched that
  I would have given the whole world to get away."</p>

  <p>The judge was by no means satisfied with this answer; he could not
  understand the attitude of the young woman, much less sympathise with it, and
  he remarked, with a sarcastic dryness:</p>

  <p>"So then your conduct on your arrival at Glandier was the result of the
  discontent you felt upon seeing a dwelling that, without doubt, did not
  answer the expectations that had been raised in you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>The judge then proceeded to the change in the young wife's conduct after
  she had come to some terms with her husband and his family. This seemed to
  him inexplicable.</p>

  <p>The prisoner then explained that Lafarge, by his constant kindness, had
  conquered her first repugnance and won her goodwill, that therefore she
  wished to make him happy and occupied herself with her husband and husband's
  affairs; as these affairs were not fully understood by her, she had accepted
  her husband's explanation of them. He had persuaded her that the new process
  that he had discovered (or thought he had discovered) for the smelting of
  iron was likely to bring in great wealth; she wrote to her friends in Paris
  begging them to interest themselves in this discovery, for the purpose of
  obtaining the patent that Lafarge sought, as well as of borrowing some money
  needed for the more expensive apparatus contemplated. The prisoner said:</p>

  <p>"My husband gave me the plan of the letters that I was to write to this
  effect. I copied them and sent them."</p>

  <p>The judge was not impressed by this explanation. He remarked with a
  sneer:</p>

  <p>"So then, these letters were not the expression of your own opinion? Your
  calculations, then, were nothing more than the result of the calculations of
  M. Lafarge for the purpose of obtaining for him the money he needed? It was a
  species of seduction, which you desired to employ in regard to those to whom
  you wrote."</p>

  <p>With such remarks as these the judge laid aside all pretence of
  impartiality and gave the jury, the lawyers and the audience to understand
  that he considered the prisoner guilty.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge was also closely cross-examined about the tender and
  affectionate letters she had sent to her husband while in Paris. The judge
  wanted to know how the prisoner could reconcile this sort of "mystic
  affection" with the cruel letter she had written some months before on her
  arrival at Glandier.</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult," he said sarcastically, "to understand this
  metamorphosis."</p>

  <p>The prisoner replied that she saw no relation between the scene of August
  15th and the letters. The judge then declared with some heat that he insisted
  on having an answer, and he put his question with the following
  insinuation:</p>

  <p>"In the first letter it is easy to see that there was nothing in common
  between you and the husband you had accepted, either in your intellect or in
  your affection. In the other letters, on the contrary, there is the expansion
  of a heart that gives itself with warm affection, and even with enthusiasm,
  to the husband to whom it is united."</p>

  <p>To this Marie Lafarge answered:</p>

  <p>"I have already stated that the kind offices of M. Lafarge had gained my
  heart. In truth I loved him, not indeed with love, but with affection. He
  wrote me very passionate, tender letters, and I believed it my duty to make
  him happy by using the same language."</p>

  <p>"So then," exclaimed the judge, "according to you, in the space of three
  or four months to this antipathy that you had conceived to your husband, and
  that had led you to desire to escape to Smyrna to get rid of him, had
  succeeded sentiments of gratitude, of tenderness and devotion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monsieur. You know that when one receives a letter very kind, very
  good, one always feels disposed to make happy the person who has shown one
  this affection&mdash;above all, when it is the husband that writes, then one
  wishes to make this husband happy."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The question of the cakes, in which, the prosecution alleged, Marie
  Lafarge had put poison, was then gone into. When the box with the letter and
  the portrait left Glandier it had four or five small cakes in it made by the
  elder Mme. Lafarge&mdash;when the box arrived in Paris it contained only one
  large cake. This cake was not produced; evidence was given by the
  <i>hôtel</i> servant who was present when the box was opened to show that the
  cake was as large as a plate and that there was one cake only in the box; it
  had been left in a cupboard and thrown away after M. Lafarge had returned to
  Glandier. But it was also shown that it had been entirely out of the hands of
  the prisoner in its transition from Glandier to Paris. It was closed by the
  servant Clementine in the presence of the prisoner, of her mother-in-law, of
  Mlle. Lebrun and another young woman, and then given to a sei vant who took
  it to the coach office. It would have been difficult for the prisoner to make
  a poisoned cake; she was under constant espionage, she did not know how to
  cook, and never during her stay in Glandier had been in the kitchen. There
  was some vague hint that the Parisian cook Mion might have poisoned the cake
  for her mistress, but this was not followed up. When the box left Glandier it
  was sealed; these seals, when it reached Paris, were broken by the officers
  of the octroi or Paris Customs, it was said, but this was not proved.</p>

  <p>It came out during the evidence that Denis's real name was Denis Barbier,
  that he had a bad record, that he had been employed by Lafarge to falsify
  bills and forge accounts. While Lafarge was in Paris, Denis had been there
  too, though he had said he was going elsewhere. No explanation was given of
  this mysterious journey; an enormous amount of irrelevant matter was sifted
  during this part Of the trial; the minute cross-examination of the prisoner
  and of the other witnesses threw no real light on the mysterious death of
  Charles Lafarge, but afforded ample opportunity for emotional scenes and
  theatrical displays.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The defence demanded a third examination of the body of Charles Lafarge.
  This was exhumed and, though in an advanced state of putrefaction, was once
  more examined for traces of arsenic. This operation took place in the room
  adjoining the Court-house of Tulle; the odours of decay were so powerful and
  so nauseous that it was necessary to burn twelve braziers of charcoal in
  order to give the Court a little relief.</p>

  <p>While the chemists were conducting this examination, which they were doing
  by means of the newly-invented apparatus of Marsh, the English chemist, Mme.
  Lafarge the elder gave her evidence; this was considered very moving;
  everyone was prepared to offer profound sympathy to the bereaved mother whose
  distress and agony had been painted in such lively colours by M. Decous. Her
  evidence was, of course, virulently against Marie Lafarge, whom she depicted
  as a hypocritical, heartless, corrupt young woman.</p>

  <p>With much dramatic effect, the old lady, whose white hair and bent figure
  aroused murmurs of compassion from the susceptible audience, described the
  terrors of her son on his death-bed, and after showing the Court how, with
  staring eyes and outstretched hands, Charles Lafarge repulsed the advance of
  his wife to his sick-bed, she broke down into a passion of tears. The Court
  was respectfully silent for several minutes; it does not seem to have
  occurred to anyone that Mme. Lafarge the elder might have spared her son this
  last torment by not informing him that he was dying of poison by his wife's
  hand. Even if Marie Lafarge had given her husband arsenic, it was not her
  fault that he knew as much, but that of his mother and Doctor Lespinas. The
  fact that what the French Press termed "the dishonoured remains of Charles
  Lafarge" were being examined in the next room while his mother was giving
  evidence was supposed by the audience to lend great dramatic pathos to the
  examination of this witness.</p>

  <p>All the facts that were actually proved against the prisoner among all
  this irrelevant evidence were that the arsenic had been in Glandier, in
  Marie's possession, and certainly in her power from December 12th, when she
  bought the first supply.</p>

  <p>The prosecution tried in vain to <i>prove</i> that she administered this
  poison to the dead man. It appeared that she had sent for some powdered gum
  at the same time that she had ordered her arsenic, and that of this powdered
  gum she herself drank repeatedly. The direct charge was that while pretending
  to give her husband this gum, she gave him the poison; the so-called proof of
  this was confused and weak.</p>

  <p>After the story of the wretched marriage, the disappointment, the romantic
  letter, the quarrels with her husband, the wild tale of the cakes sent to
  Paris, M. Decous had brought forward all the fancies that had entered into
  the heads of the Lafarge family, the conjectures of gossiping servants, the
  malicious insinuations of neighbours, and stories spread by M. Denis, M.
  Buffière and M. Magnaud that Mme. Lafarge was certainly going to poison her
  husband.</p>

  <p>These tales were repeated by bailiffs and farmers in the neighbourhood;
  they proved, of course, nothing more than that these three men had been
  industriously slandering Marie Lafarge long before any direct suspicion
  attached to her; it was clear that these people had determined beforehand to
  accuse Marie Lafarge of murder and that they had made their plan so as to
  give their predetermined accusation an air of truth.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mme. Lafarge the elder had spread around the neighbourhood the
  story of the letter of August 15th, and so it was common gossip that the new
  mistress of Glandier was very rich, that she and her husband were not happy
  together, and that she had written a letter in which she declared that she
  loved another man.</p>

  <p>After all this hearsay evidence had been admitted and had had its due
  effect upon the jury and the audience, the witness Denis Barbier, despite his
  dubious history and doubtful character, was allayed to give his opinion of
  the guilt of the prisoner by saying that he had only bought the arsenic after
  he had been twice told to get it because he was afraid that Marie Lafarge
  would use it to poison her husband. The clerk Magnaud was declared by M.
  Denis to have said that he had heard Mme. Charles, as Marie Lafarge was
  termed, say that if she wished it her husband would not be alive in
  twenty-four hours, that she should wear mourning only a year and live in
  Paris when her husband died, and that she always had arsenic by her.</p>

  <p>The evidence of Ann Lebrun was also much against the prisoner, but under
  cross-examination it appeared that she had not, as she first stated, actually
  <i>seen</i> the arsenic put into drinks, but she had seen Mme. Lafarge put
  her arm out of bed, reach the bowl of broth from the chimney-piece and shake
  into it something out of a piece of torn paper. This, Marie had said, was
  powder of orange flowers or gum; it was Ann Lebrun who had found the dregs of
  the <i>lait de poule</i> that had been placed on the chimney-piece and on the
  surface of it there were floating some white globules; she showed them to the
  sister who spoke about them to the physician, M. Bardon, who said he thought
  they were lime from the wood ash; she, Ann Lebrun and Madame Lafarge
  <i>mère</i>, had tried in vain to obtain this ash. The broth was then thrown
  away, but a thick residue remained; this was locked up by the mother and
  given by her to the officers of justice, examined by the chemists, and by
  them declared to contain a very large quantity of arsenic.</p>

  <p>Mlle. Lebrun's evidence then continued:</p>

  <p>"In the afternoon of the same day I was alone with Mme. Marie in the sick
  man's room. She took a glass of water coloured with wine and went towards the
  <i>commode</i>. I was working near the chimney and I could not see what she
  was doing, but I thought I heard the drawer opened and the noise of a spoon
  striking against the side of the glass. Madame then gave a spoonful to her
  husband; he said, 'That burns my throat.' I asked what he said and Madame
  repeated it."</p>

  <p>"Did this astonish you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I did not see her put anything into it [the glass], but on the
  surface [of the wine and water] I saw a white powder. I went near the
  <i>commode</i> and I saw a trail of powder. As the drawer was half open I saw
  in it a little pot and the trail corresponded with the position of the pot. I
  tasted the powder and it produced a pricking sensation for nearly an hour. I
  remarked also a glass on the night-table; it contained some white powder and
  some drops of water. I took it between my fingers and it was like a fine
  resilient sand. I compared it with the gum and the gum glued my fingers. I
  remarked upon this to Mme. Marie who said it was gum. 'Besides,' she said, 'I
  am going to drink it,' and she filled the glass with water and I believe she
  drank it."</p>

  <p>"After having drunk did she vomit?"</p>

  <p>"I have not spoken of her vomiting on this occasion, she did so every day.
  Every time she ate, she vomited."</p>

  <p>Mlle. Lebrun went on to say that she had thrown some of this mysterious
  white powder on the fire and that it had smelt of garlic, also that the
  breath of the sick man had the same odour.</p>

  <p>M. Lespinas, the doctor from Lubersac, confirmed this statement. He also
  said that upon finding so strong a smell of garlic from burning the powder,
  he had no longer any doubt that Lafarge was being poisoned. No one pointed
  out that arsenic had no taste, and that therefore if it was arsenic that she
  put on her tongue, Mlle. Ann Lebrun must have imagined the pricking
  sensation, and that though arsenic smells of garlic when cast on the fire, it
  would not have had this odour in the breath of the sick man.</p>

  <p>As for the prisoner, she denied all knowledge of the little pot and its
  contents, saying that she never saw it, that she never put any poison into
  anything.</p>

  <p>The evidence of Emma Pontier was to the effect that she arrived at
  Glandier on January 11th, found Lafarge dying, and his wife, as she, Emma
  Pontier, firmly believed, sincerely distressed. When suspicion of the
  poisoning arose, Emma Pontier heard Mme. Marie address her maidservant with
  great warmth and ask what she had done with the arsenic that she had confided
  to her. The answer was that the maidservant Clementine Servat had given it to
  Alfred, who had put it into a hat that he had placed in the room of M.
  Lafarge. Emma Pontier declared that on the morning of the death of M. Lafarge
  she saw his wife undress herself, and while she was so doing, she saw for the
  first time a small agate box in the pocket of her apron. She asked Clementine
  what it contained and she answered "gum." Remembering all the suspicion cast
  upon her friend, Marie Lafarge, Emma Pontier took the box and gave it to her
  uncle; afterwards he gave it to the officers of justice. She was afraid that
  arsenic might be in it and that Marie might commit suicide. Her uncle had
  told her, Emma Pontier, that the agate box contained arsenic, but this did
  not seem to have been proved and the box and contents were lost sight of.</p>

  <p>The evidence of the servants and employees at the forge was all in favour
  of Marie Lafarge; though she was a stranger, and therefore they were likely
  to be prejudiced against her, they all spoke of her most highly. "She was a
  kind mistress&mdash;a gracious lady," "I never saw a better," and so on.</p>

  <p>These people said that Denis came among them with bitter talk of Marie
  Lafarge; on one occasion he had said that he wished to see her "torn in
  pieces." He had also said to the work-people at the forge, "I am master now,
  I will turn you out of doors."</p>

  <p>A peasant named Bardon, employed in the house at Glandier, also declared
  that when helping during the illness of Charles Lafarge he had found a packet
  of white powder in a foot-warmer belonging to Mme. Lafarge, the mother.</p>

  <p>The evidence clearly established that Denis Barbier had lived for some
  time by forgery, that Lafarge was guilty with his agent of issuing fictitious
  bills, that Lafarge forged a letter purporting to be written by his
  brother-in-law, M. de Violaine, and that he was&mdash;and had been for some
  time&mdash;utterly insolvent.</p>

  <p>It seemed fairly obvious, too, that Denis had intended in some way to
  employ Charles Lafarge as his tool, that the wife was in his way, and that he
  had conceived a violent hatred for her&mdash;not only for this reason, but
  because of her haughty manners towards him and her refusal to receive himself
  and his wife at her table.</p>

  <p>These affairs were not, however, gone into; much was left obscure. Nor was
  there any investigation into why, when Denis had pretended to go to Jueret,
  he had gone to Paris, or what had become of the large sum of money that
  Lafarge had raised on his wife's dowry and brought back with him from Paris
  to Glandier, but of which only a very small portion had been found.</p>

  <p>The evidence also made it quite clear that Marie Lafarge, by the blank
  papers she had signed, both shortly before and after her arrest, and by the
  covering sum of 28,000 francs which she had paid away to M. Roque, had
  entirely exhausted her patrimony and had beggared herself to pay the debts of
  the man whom she was accused of murdering; it was then obvious that whatever
  her motives had been in getting rid of her husband, if indeed she had done
  so, they had not been mercenary.</p>

  <p>It appeared to anyone who took the trouble to put the story carefully
  together and to disregard the masses of irrelevant matter that the clerk
  Denis had carefully circulated to arouse suspicion against Marie
  Lafarge&mdash;he had told the mother that her son was poisoned, he had had
  access to the mother's apartment, to that of the sick man, to every part of
  the house, and that he might have strewn the poison where it was afterwards
  found. The sediment of the broth in which the chemists had found such an
  enormous quantity of poison had been standing about for such a long period
  that anyone might have tampered with it. Mlle. Lebrun stated that a small
  quantity of powder had been put into this broth; and the chemist had found
  sufficient arsenic to kill ten persons. This was very extraordinary,
  considering that half the broth had been drunk, a further portion thrown away
  and there only remained a sediment at the bottom of the bowl; yet this still
  contained enough to poison ten persons. As for the small pot found in the
  <i>commode</i>, this did contain powdered gum and a small quantity of
  arsenic, but the trail of powder from the pot was pure arsenic. If into a pot
  containing powdered gum anyone had shaken a small quantity of arsenic, and
  then shaken a trail of it along the outside of the <i>commode</i>, such would
  be the exact state of the case. In the pot, there would be gum and arsenic,
  out of it, arsenic alone. Then there was the small agate box carried by Mme.
  Lafarge in the pocket of her apron that was taken by Emma Pontier and given
  to her uncle. When this powder was first examined no arsenic was found; when
  the same powder underwent a second examination a small quantity of arsenic
  was found. This box was proved to have been at several times out of the
  possession of Marie Lafarge; before the officers of justice came to the house
  on the 15th every part of it was open to the Lafarge family, Denis and the
  other clerk.</p>

  <p>The suspected flannels had been taken possession of, collected by the
  mother and put by her into a wrapper. It was clear that any of these might
  have been tampered with; they were, for twenty-four hours, in the power of
  Marie's avowed enemy, Madame Lafarge <i>mère</i>.</p>

  <p>It appeared, too, in evidence that after the body was opened, the entrails
  were put into vases, ticketed, but not sealed. The whole was then placed on
  the back of a horse and taken to Brives. The officers thus describe the
  journey:</p>

  <p>"We slept at Vigeois. On the 17th we arrived at Brives. I have heard that
  it was then that the stomach was put into a glass before being wrapped in a
  cloth. On the 18th the surgeons commenced their analysis, which lasted three
  days. During this time we returned to Glandier and not till our return were
  any seals put on the vases."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>It was thus obvious that during this time any person might have interfered
  with these remains and strewn arsenic on or in them. Such, in brief, was the
  long, confused and rambling case for the prosecution.</p>

  <p>One autopsy had discovered no arsenic in the remains of Charles Lafarge, a
  second had found arsenic, a third examination was in progress during the
  trial. The defence consisted largely in calling witnesses to the prisoner's
  high character.</p>

  <p>On Marie's behalf, not only her relations but friends like the <i>Curé</i>
  from Villers-Hellon and highly-placed aristocrats like the Maréchale Gérard
  and Madame de Valence spoke warmly on her behalf, giving her the best
  possible character and repudiating indignantly everything that she was
  accused of, from the petty thieving of finery down to the poisoning of her
  husband. This mass of evidence was in direct contradiction to that given by
  equally important people, including Madame de Nicolai and Madame de
  Montbreton, who had testified that Marie Cappelle, with whom they had lived
  in the greatest intimacy, was "essentially corrupt."</p>

  <p>As the trial dragged on the prisoner's health suffered sadly. She was
  often hardly able to walk into court, she was much weakened by continual dry
  coughs, frequently used <i>vinaigrettes</i>, and seemed often on the point of
  swooning in her place. Her attire was always the same and of the utmost
  elegance&mdash;a full suit of widow's mourning, a black bonnet tied under her
  chin and curtained by a heavy veil, which she kept thrown back.</p>

  <p>Her torments were somewhat eased for her by the frequent visits she
  received from her devoted lawyers, from her relatives and friends, all of
  whom protested their complete belief in her innocence with the utmost
  fervour. She also continued to receive letters sent not only from all parts
  of France, but from England and even America; most of these she insisted on
  answering with her own hand.</p>

  <p>Among the witnesses called was the father of Charles Lafarge's first wife,
  who gave his former son-in-law a bad character, said that he had broken his
  first wife's heart by his infidelities and brutalities, and that he, the
  witness, had been forced into consenting to the match only because of money
  difficulties. He, too, had been deceived about Charles Lafarge's financial
  position and prospects.</p>

  <p>The trial was interrupted by the findings of the chemists of Limoges, who
  were continuing their analysis in the room next the court; as definitely as
  the chemists of Brives had declared that there was arsenic in the body of
  Charles Lafarge, so these experts, who were among the most celebrated in
  France, declared positively that these organs did not contain arsenic. Their
  spokesman, M. Dupuygren, came into court and solemnly declared that after
  careful experiments with the apparatus invented by Marsh they had obtained no
  results.</p>

  <p>There was a profound "sensation" in court; the prisoner, so long pale,
  immobile, half-unconscious in her chair, roused herself with a "spasm of
  joy." Her advocate Maître Paillet burst into tears; he was completely
  exhausted from conducting in the face of so much hostility and prejudice a
  case that seemed so hopeless, but that to him concerned the life or death of
  an innocent woman.</p>

  <p>Even the heartless, fashionable audience that had listened with avidity to
  all the scraps of gossip, sensationalism and slander that they had heard
  during nearly three weeks, were moved by a generous emotion and burst into
  applause.</p>

  <p>M. Decous, the <i>avocat général</i>, then leapt to his feet in an
  explosion of wrath that would have done justice to a Lord Jeffreys; entirely
  forgetting, or never indeed having conceived, that it was his duty also to
  rejoice that the prisoner was not a murderess and no part of his duty to
  strain every effort to obtain a conviction, he abused the enthusiastic
  audience roundly, singled out one young man, who was applauding, threatened
  to commit him, and exclaimed furiously:</p>

  <p>"Since when has it happened that the sanctuary of justice has become an
  arena for evil passions? Do you think that there remain no further resources
  to the prosecution? Do you think that there does not remain a grand and
  solemn mission to fulfil? Take care lest the accused may have perhaps to
  accuse you of having acted so as to prolong her anxiety and to retard the
  period for the termination of this enquiry."</p>

  <p>This violent explosion of passion was obviously not provoked by a fear
  that the truth had been missed, but by humiliated vanity and rage at defeat.
  M. Decous had already addressed the prisoner as "a criminal without
  parallel."</p>

  <p>The question before the Court seemed now to have narrowed down to whether
  or no there was arsenic in the body of Charles Lafarge. The other equally
  important question whether it could be proved who had given him this arsenic
  was not then raised. It had come out in the course of the trial that M.
  Lafarge had been suffering from some disease that he had endeavoured to treat
  himself, and a doctor in Paris had given him medicine to be taken internally
  and externally that contained arsenic. Had then some portions of this poison
  been found in the remains, it was always possible that they had by this means
  found their way there.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge's gleam of hope was soon over. She was returned to her
  prison and M. Orfila, one of the most celebrated chemists in France, was sent
  for to examine once again the mortal remains of Charles Lafarge. At the same
  time the defence sent for M. Francois Raspail, an equally famous chemist and
  a Liberal whose politics had several times sent him to prison. This gentleman
  had already taken a lively interest in the trial of Marie Lafarge. He
  believed on the evidence he had read that she was innocent; he was therefore
  delighted to offer her his services. There was some delay, however, in
  sending for him, and the young lawyer who was sent to Paris to fetch him was
  in such a hurry that he was not even able to tell the great chemist his name
  but had to relate the whole story of Marie Lafarge's difficulties and the
  present situation of the case while the two men were hurrying in a carriage
  from Paris to Tulle.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile M. Orfila had arrived in Tulle and taken over the examination of
  the remains; Maître Paillet, Marie Lafarge's lawyer, had already communicated
  with this <i>savant</i>, and Orfila had sent a letter in which he declared it
  was his opinion that, from following the results of the first analysis of the
  remains, there had been no arsenic in them.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Mathieu-Joseph-Bonaventura Orfila was considered one of the most
  distinguished toxicologists of the day. He was a native of Minorca and born
  in 1787; he had studied at the university of Valencia, and had been so
  promising a student that the University of Barcelona sent him at its own
  expense to Paris. In this city he arrived in 1807, passed his examinations
  brilliantly and obtained a medical degree. His private lectures on Chemistry,
  Forensic Medicine and Anatomy became famous, and he began researches into
  toxicology. Some of the most eminent names in French medicine were to be
  found among his pupils. His fame soon spread; he was appointed Corresponding
  Member of the Institute, and in 1819 Professor of Forensic Medicine in the
  Faculty of Medicine. In 1816 he was appointed Physician to Louis XVIII and on
  the constitution of the Academy of Medicine he was one, and the youngest, of
  its seventy original members.</p>

  <p>As he had always attached himself to the House of Orléans, the Revolution
  of 1830 brought him to the forefront. He was chosen Dean of the Faculty,
  Member of the Council-General of Hospitals and Member of the Council-General
  of the Department. He became a naturalised Frenchman, and was appointed a
  Member of the Council of Public Instruction. His discoveries in toxicology
  were recognised throughout Europe and his evidence was consequently in
  requisition for the guidance of all legal Tribunals. His works on Forensic
  Medicine, Medical Chemistry and his treatises on poisons were considered
  authorities. His personal character was beyond reproach and he was
  universally honoured and esteemed. In person, however, the great
  <i>savant</i> was formidable, even repulsive, like "a bird of prey"; his
  manner was dry; among the ardent young romantics of this period he was
  regarded as being almost as inhuman as a machine.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this celebrated scientist in the little town of Tulle
  was one of the most poignant sensations of the trial. His lean, black-coated
  figure, his pale face with the hawk-like nose and bald head, grey whiskers
  and severe mouth, became an object of insatiable curiosity.</p>

    <p class="caption">Mathieu-Joseph-Bonaventura Orfila, distinguished
    toxicologist<br>
    From a lithograph by Delpech in the possession of the author.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>During four days of almost intolerable suspense he conducted his
  experiments assisted by his usual colleagues, M. de Bussy and M. Olliver
  d'Angers, both celebrated as chemists and toxicologists. When the illustrious
  <i>savant</i> came into the box to give evidence a violent storm was breaking
  over Tulle, and the half-horrified, half-delighted audience trembled with the
  excitement of this sinister drama&mdash;the court-house darkened by the storm
  without, thunder rolling overhead, lightning flashing before the windows, the
  black-robed prisoner half-fainting amid her crapes and veils, the stern,
  implacable figure of the scientist in the witness-box; his first words fell
  among the audience with a sensation as profound as if a thunderbolt had split
  the roof of the Tribunal: "I have found arsenic in the body of Lafarge." This
  declaration, so explicit, so unexpected, caused everyone to tremble. Mme.
  Lefarge rose to her feet, paled, pressed her hand to her heart; a profound
  excitement thrilled the assembly.</p>

  <p>In cool, measured terms, and at great length, the chemist proceeded to
  explain his experiments and the result of them. In various portions of the
  anatomy of Lafarge, in the stomach, the thorax, the abdomen, the liver, the
  heart, the brain and the intestinal canal, arsenic, though in a very small
  quantity, had been discovered; there had been, however, nothing found in the
  flesh; thus, the possibility that the poison had been placed after death in
  the body.</p>

  <p>The chemist went on to demonstrate that this arsenic had nothing to do
  with the natural arsenic that might possibly have been found in a human body,
  nor with any arsenic likely to have been in the earth in which the body had
  been buried. He also proved, to his own satisfaction at least, that it was
  quite easy to explain why the other chemists had not found it, even though
  they had used the apparatus of Marsh, which had been employed by M. Orfila
  himself.</p>

  <p>The truth was, the great man explained, that they, these other chemists of
  Limoges, had not been expert enough in the way they had used the apparatus,
  which was quite a new invention and required the most delicate handling.</p>

  <p>When M. Orfila had finished his icy exposition and left the witness-box in
  silence, a deep gloom fell over the audience. Mme. Lafarge bent her face in
  her hands and sank half-conscious in her chair; her advocates stood beside
  her, pale, rigid, the sweat beading on their foreheads; outside the thunder
  rolled, the lightning flashed and the rain dashed against the darkened
  windows.</p>

  <p>It was commonly felt that the evidence of Orfila had condemned the
  prisoner. The prosecuting lawyer, the judge and the jury triumphed as if they
  had been fighting for a victory and not for the truth. It was well known that
  several of the jurymen, even befo-re the trial had commenced, had gone about
  Tulle saying that they hoped and believed that Mme. Lafarge was guilty.</p>

  <p>These men, then, received with sombre pleasure the confirmation of their
  expectation, and even, as they confessed themselves, their hope. They wanted
  to know that this woman was guilty and they wanted to see her sacrificed to
  the furies of the family Lafarge and the suspicions of the inhabitants of the
  Limousin.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile M. Raspail and his young friend were hastening from Paris; they
  were delayed by the bad weather and an accident to their carriage; despite
  the agonised efforts of the lawyer and the goodwill of M. Raspail they did
  not arrive in Tulle until after the trial was over&mdash;therefore too late
  to be of any assistance to Marie Lafarge.</p>

  <p>Before the <i>avocat général</i>, with an air of satisfied vengeance, made
  his final address to the jury, one or two circumstances had come to light
  that should have been in favour of the prisoner. M. Buffière, her
  brother-in-law, had said to one of his creditors that he knew that Marie
  Lafarge would be condemned and that all the debts on the Lafarge property
  would be satisfied out of the indemnity that family would receive.</p>

  <p>The defence had wished to recall M. Denis Barbier, but he had disappeared,
  nor could all the efforts of the law discover him; this was a severe
  reflection on the character of one of the principal witnesses for the
  prosecution.</p>

  <p>There had been also another incident that displeased even those who
  believed Marie Lafarge was guilty; her mother-in-law, without waiting for the
  result of the trial, had put in a claim for 40,000 francs damages against her
  daughter-in-law; considering that this young woman had already sacrificed her
  entire fortune to the family Lafarge, this grasping cupidity was considered a
  scandal.</p>

  <p>M. Decous's final speech to the jury was in the same style as that he had
  adopted throughout, that of dramatic invective. He ran over in a picturesque
  but inaccurate fashion all the evidence and told once again the gloomy and
  mysterious story of the marriage of Charles Lafarge and Marie Cappelle and
  her life at Glandier.</p>

  <p>"Lafarge," said M. Decous dramatically, "is dead of poison. Who has
  poisoned him? Who? Why, it is this woman who wrote the frightful letter of
  the first days of her marriage, where already the words crime and poison are
  to be found. After the apparent reconciliation with his wife, Charles Lafarge
  was a condemned man. Cupidity was then the ignoble accessory of the crime,
  but the criminal also wished to free herself from the caresses of a man whom
  she detested."</p>

  <p>Turning towards the prisoner, the <i>avocat général</i> exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Marie Cappelle, it is you that poisoned your husband, you that
  during fifteen days fed him on poison. It is you that bought the poison,
  quantities of poison. If you are not guilty, tell us who it was that
  substituted one cake for another in the box you sent to Paris, tell us what
  happened to the enormous quantities of arsenic bought by you and for which
  bicarbonate of soda was substituted!"</p>

  <p>After this violent speech the audience was suspended until the evening. It
  was necessary to carry out Mme. Lafarge in a chair; the spectators noticed
  that she seemed unconscious, that a frightful convulsion had passed over her
  features. The sight of her produced a painful and prolonged "sensation" and
  "<i>sourdes rumeurs</i>."</p>

  <p>When the Court reassembled it was Maître Paillet that spoke:</p>

  <p>"Messieurs, after eight months of captivity, of sorrows and of
  resignation, Mme. Lafarge can at last hear a friendly voice raised before her
  judges!"</p>

  <p>Maître Paillet, who was an extremely eloquent and learned lawyer with a
  harmonious voice and a graceful delivery, continued in the same tone of
  melancholy indignation. Like his adversary the <i>avocat général</i>, this
  advocate wandered from the case and made an emotional appeal both to the jury
  and to the spectators, painting the grief, sorrow, forlorn position of this
  interesting and charming young woman so delicately nurtured, and exclaiming
  against the campaign of calumny that had been carried on against her in all
  parts of France.</p>

  <p>"It is outrageous against a woman, captive, suffering, who cannot defend
  herself!"</p>

  <p>After expressing warm resentment at the treatment the unfortunate prisoner
  had received before she had been judged. Maître Paillet entered once more
  into her story, treating it from the opposite angle to that taken by the
  <i>avocat général</i>. He dwelt on the graces, the virtues, the innocence and
  the breeding of Marie Lafarge. He mentioned the letters she had sent to the
  apothecary's son, M. Guyot, which the prosecution had put in as proof of her
  immorality, and dismissed them lightly, with the smile of a man of the world,
  as mere schoolgirl romance.</p>

  <p>He dwelt upon her happy family life at Villers-Hellon, where everyone from
  the <i>Curé</i> down to the humblest peasant remembered her with love and
  veneration. He put in all the letters of the great ladies who had known her,
  such as the Comtesse de Valence, and who now warmly attested to their firm
  belief in her innocence and virtue. He sketched with scorn the career of M.
  Lafarge, who had come a ruined man to Paris to try and find a rich wife to
  patch up his fallen fortunes. First, he had not said he was a widower, then
  he had said he was rich, having an income between 30,000 and 40,000 francs,
  he had described Glandier as a delightful residence, he had said that his
  factory was worth 80,000 francs&mdash;the truth being that he was already
  reduced to forging notes.</p>

  <p>Maître Paillet put in and read aloud extracts from several charming and
  touching letters written by Marie Cappelle, during her brief engagement, to
  her old friend and nurse, in which she spoke hopefully of the charming little
  <i>château</i> that would be hers, the handsome domain over which she would
  reign and her expectations of a happy married life.</p>

  <p>He then passed to the episode of the cakes and tried to show that there
  was no reason to suppose that if a substitution had been made it had been
  done by Marie Lafarge, he drew the character of Ann Lebrun as a spiteful,
  hysterical young woman whose word was not to be relied on, and he tried to
  shake the evidence of Mme. Lafarge <i>mère</i> by pointing out that she had
  stolen the copy of the will from her daughter-in-law, and that while her
  son's body was yet warm, she had rifled the house, packed up all the
  valuables, sent them away, and a few hours afterwards broken into her
  daughter-in-law's room, smashed her desk and taken away her papers. He also
  attacked warmly the character of Denis Barbier, the witness who had
  disappeared&mdash;a forger who did not disguise his atrocious hatred for the
  young woman who had married his accomplice, who made a mysterious journey to
  Paris that he lied about, who was going under an assumed name. He concluded
  by demanding what possible motive Marie Lafarge could have had for poisoning
  her husband? It certainly was not a mercenary one; she had always shown
  herself indifferent to money and she had willingly signed away her entire
  fortune to save her dead husband's name from dishonour.</p>

  <p>Working himself and his audience up to a state of profound emotion, Maître
  Paillet at the end of a two days' speech concluded thus. Turning towards the
  prisoner, he demanded:</p>

  <p>"I ask, has there ever been a more lamentable destiny than hers? Orphan
  though she was, she had at least the glorious name that her father had left
  her, a patrimony, modest without doubt, but sufficient, an honourable family.
  She had, also, from her distinguished education and her personal graces, the
  hope of a happy future.</p>

  <p>"Lafarge appeared. You know how he obtained her hand, you know in what
  state was his position. Lafarge appeared, and soon, thanks to this fatal
  marriage, honour, fortune, illusions, hope, health itself&mdash;yes, health,
  all is vanished for her, and vanished for ever. All this, messieurs, you
  cannot give her again, but there is something that you can do. Hasten to
  restore this unhappy woman to the tenderness, the care of her family! Hasten
  to let them take from prison all that the slow agony of eight months has left
  this young woman, formerly so brilliant, and such an object of envy! See now
  to what a deplorable state she is reduced; she must be even to her enemies a
  subject for compassion and pity!</p>

  <p>"Courage, however, courage, poor Marie! I hope that Providence, which has
  so miraculously sustained you during these long trials, will not abandon you
  now. No, you will live for your family who love you so much, for your
  numerous friends&mdash;you will live as a glorious witness of human justice,
  when she is confided to pure hands, to enlightened spirits, to compassionate
  and sensible souls."</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of this moving oration Marie Lafarge was carried
  half-unconscious to her cell. There she at once sat down and wrote to her
  defender two lines:</p>

  <p class="letter">My noble saviour, I send you what to me is the most
  precious<br>
  thing I possess in the world&mdash;my father's Cross of Honour.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When the jury had retired to consider their verdict there was a short
  legal debate between M. Bac and the <i>avocat général</i> on the affair of
  the diamonds, which the former wished dealt with at once.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge was brought in again. She was questioned once more about the
  crime, asked if she had anything more to say about it? Hardly able to rise
  from her chair, in a faint voice she said:</p>

  <p>"<i>Monsieur le Président</i>, I am innocent, I swear to you."</p>

  <p>There was the usual "sensation" in the court; the judge declared he had
  not been able to hear what the prisoner had whispered; M. Bac spoke:</p>

  <p>"The accused has said, 'I am innocent, I swear'."</p>

  <p>Some members of the audience were now weeping. The judge resumed the
  debate. The question was put to the jury:</p>

  <p>"Marie Cappelle, widow of Pouch Lafarge, is she proved guilty of having,
  in December and January last, killed her husband by poison?"</p>

  <p>The accused was then again borne away to the cell; she was unable to walk;
  the Court retired; it was then a quarter to eight; after an hour the judge
  returned, the jury having sent out to say that they had reached a decision; a
  complete silence reigned in the room; Marie Lafarge, waving aside those who
  would have assisted her, rose to her feet, rigid in her mourning. The jury
  filed in; the foreman said slowly, in his heavy Limousin accent:</p>

  <p>"By a majority of votes the accused is found guilty."</p>

  <p>There were movements and exclamations in the crowded, gasping audience.
  The stolid foreman repeated:</p>

  <p>"Yes, by the majority, she is declared guilty. There are, however,
  extenuating circumstances in favour of the accused."</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge fell insensible, was caught by her lawyers, and carried to
  the cells below; after a short pause the judge demanded her return; Maître
  Paillet, whose face was covered with sweat and whose voice was almost extinct
  after his labours of the last few days, said that the state of Mme. Lafarge
  rendered her presence impossible.</p>

  <p>The Court then, after a deliberation of an hour on points of law,
  pronounced a sentence that condemned Marie Cappelle, Widow Lafarge, to hard
  labour for life and public exposure in the market-place of Tulle.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was the handsome and romantic young advocate Charles Lachaud that had
  the painful mission of telling the prisoner her sentence. He entered into her
  cell and held out his hand without speaking, "casting on her glances of
  immense pity." She understood, and rising with a feverish energy,
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"I will return. I will tell them once more that I am innocent. I am
  strong, I can go."</p>

  <p>But this violent movement exhausted her strength and she fell again
  unconscious. At this moment Maître Beaubeau Laribrière, the young advocate of
  Limoges who had gone to Paris to fetch M. Raspail, arrived at Tulle exhausted
  and too late; the famous chemist, who had been unwell when summoned from
  Paris, was in a state of fever, as his dusty carriage drawn by two sweating
  horses galloped into the open square of Tulle.</p>

  <p>It was soon surrounded by sympathisers with Marie, who shouted: "You've
  killed her, unhappy wretch! She's been condemned to hard labour for life. She
  was counting on you, to the minute, to the second! It is entirely your
  fault!"</p>

  <p>The young advocate, almost in a state of collapse, exclaimed: "It is not
  our fault! We have done 120 leagues in forty hours, by mountain ways, through
  hideous weather! Our carriage broke dolvn twice!"</p>

  <p>The following morning M. Raspail was introduced into the cell of the
  condemned woman, where she was surrounded by her family and friends. He has
  left the following account of this strange visit:</p>

  <p class="letter">Marie Cappelle asked me to go and see her on the following
  morning. Permission was not refused; everyone in the Palais de Justice, even
  to the jailers, appeared frankly interested in her fate. Her family had not
  quitted her for a moment. Their friendly faces were always about the Tribunal
  asking for news of her; I did not then lack people to introduce me. I was
  conducted from one hand to another to the door of her cell and there left for
  a moment in the ante-chamber. The door was opened and in the cell Marie
  Cappelle was embracing her sister. This moving scene reminded me of several
  similar touching incidents that had taken place when I, in my turn, was a
  prisoner. Marie Cappelle desired to speak to me alone, and having at her
  disposition only one room, asked her family, and even her dear sister, to
  leave her. I wished to say all I had to say before everyone, but the wish of
  the condemned woman was to me as sacred as the wishes of one about to die. I
  submitted without the least protest. I found her ill in her bed, behind two
  cotton curtains in squares of blue and white that served to divide her
  chamber into two, the first of which was occupied by the woman Clementine
  Servat, who served her in the times of her prosperity and who will not leave
  her now she is a prisoner and without resources. The example of fidelity in
  unhappiness that this good girl gives to the whole country seems to have
  carried good luck to Marie Cappelle. She has lost very few friends in her
  misfortune. May God preserve in her a little health, for she has, in her soul
  and in her heart, enough energy left to re-establish herself, abandoned as
  she is in the public opinion, which she seemed to me more desirous to
  reconquer than to obtain her liberty. I was much moved. At my age, having a
  little girl to educate, my emotions need not be suspect. I did all I could to
  remain cold, as a chemist, as a scientist, and I terminated my interview by
  some words relative to religious sentiment, which Marie Cappelle seemed to me
  to possess without exaggeration and without hypocrisy. Her intimate friends
  have confirmed me in this opinion. An outburst of weeping seeming to
  suffocate the sick woman, I retired. She had told me that my visit had given
  her a little hope, more than she ever thought to have again, and had added
  one consolation more to the consolations that her friends brought her. In
  leaving the Palais de Justice, depressed and dazzled, as one always feels
  when leaving a prisoner, I asked myself if it was indeed Madame Lafarge whom
  I had seen. And now, at 120 leagues away, I still ask myself the same
  question. It seems to me that the only person whom I had under my eyes was
  Marie Cappelle. Madame Lafarge, such as I have seen her in her prison cell,
  is a woman whom grief devours, without having entirely altered the regularity
  of her features. She must once have been a beautiful young girl and could no
  doubt, given a little good fortune and health, again become so. Were not her
  features so animated, one would perceive that they are a little irregular.
  The quick, lively, changing expressions of her face prevent one from seeing,
  observing this slight lack of harmony. Her glance, such as one can divine it
  through her tears, has lost nothing of the magic that fascinated at the same
  time friends and enemies. They tell me that one man only in all the Tribunal
  could remain unmoved by Madame Lafarge&mdash;that was the avocat général. It
  is a pity that this lawyer showed so much violent partiality. The complexion
  of Madame Lafarge is not livid; it is pale, her black hair is worn in a
  bandeau and was covered with one of those ordinary calico night-caps that I
  remember seeing worn by the prisoners in Versailles whom I used to see so
  often passing beneath my windows. Madame Lafarge, in her prison, is no more
  than a daughter of the people, abandoned by men to the hands of the law. I
  did not feel in the least awkward in her presence. Her friends assured me
  that during her captivity she had always been the same and that even before
  she had the same taste for simplicity. Her conversation, sweet and caressing,
  preserved in misfortune and in humiliation a trace of the harmony and
  sympathy that rendered Marie Cappelle so interesting at the height of her
  prospeity. It would be difficult to meet a woman of the world who knows
  better how to put at ease everyone who speaks to her, and who tempers
  graciousness with wit. She tries to please everyone and never to offend a
  soul. She talks of everything with the same interest and the same talent. She
  plays the piano exceedingly well, she has a beautiful voice and it is very
  well and carefully trained. She knows something of science, can explain and
  translate Goethe at sight, talks several languages, improvises Italian verse
  with as much grace and purity of style as French verse. Marie Cappelle was
  indeed an exotic plant in the midst of that rude Limousin household, and
  there she has found death.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On the question of the finding of the arsenic in the remains of the body
  of Charles Lafarge, M. Raspail had a great deal to say. He did not agree with
  M. Orfila's experiments and their results, and wrote a long letter to this
  effect that was published in the Press.</p>

  <p>Complicated technical arguments were now exchanged between the two
  <i>savants</i>, and though many people believed in the findings of M. Raspail
  and that M. Orfila had been either mistaken or malicious, there were those
  who did not hesitate to say that he had acted entirely in the interests of
  the prosecution.</p>

  <p>There was no hope for Marie Cappelle, now regarded as civilly dead. Her
  case, however, was taken to the Court of Appeal in Paris. When on September
  28th at half-past eleven at night the usher went to the bed of Mme. Lafarge
  to read over her sentence, he found her in the most alarming state, incapable
  even of understanding what was said to her. Doctors were in attendance, among
  them that M. Segeral whom she had demanded in vain at Glandier; they declared
  her to be suffering from a severe nervous affection complicated by heart
  trouble; they also said that there were marked indications of the beginning
  of tuberculosis.</p>

  <p>She was well enough, however, to send a touching, graceful and dignified
  letter of thanks dated October 1st to M. Raspail after she had read the
  pamphlet he had published on her behalf.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>M. de Léautaud now pressed the charge of theft to the great indignation of
  Marie's friends. What could he obtain, they demanded, from a woman condemned
  to imprisonment for life? And how vindiztive to pursue a poor creature
  already in torment!</p>

  <p>M. de Léautaud, however, persisted in "clearing the honour of his wife" as
  he termed it; the Vicomtesse had been severely handled by the Paris Press and
  her husband was exceedingly bitter about the whole affair. Madame Lafarge's
  lawyers did not succeed in obtaining&mdash;even on medical evidence as to
  their client's state of health&mdash;the postponement of the charge of theft
  beyond May 3rd, 1841.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle's "civil death" was waived, and the woman, already
  sentenced to imprisonment for life, was placed again in the dock.</p>

  <p>The case was heard in the Assize Court of Tulle, where Marie had been
  tried before; she retained the same lawyers; M. de Léautaud had added to M.
  Corali, the formidable M. Odilon Barrot, one of the most celebrated advocates
  in France.</p>

  <p>The prisoner, who was allowed to wear widow's weeds, was obviously in
  frail health; there were white streaks in the black locks of this woman of
  twenty-five years of age, but her demeanour was cold and correct, and she met
  with icy dignity the hostile gaze of M. de Léautaud, who was seated by his
  lawyers: many people thought that his presence was in the worst of taste; it
  was remarked that his wife, who before had faced her girlhood's friend so
  unflinchingly, was not present. M. Lachaud began by a protest based on a
  legal quibble, his client was "<i>morte civilement</i>," she did not, in the
  eyes of the law, exist&mdash;it was too late to charge her with any
  crime.</p>

  <p>Nor had he time to get together his witnesses; M. de Léautaud had offered
  to pay the expenses of finding these, but this "<i>suspect</i>" offer had
  been refused. Maître Corali replied by sarcastically reminding Maître Lachaud
  that at Brives he had said it was too soon to take the case of the diamonds
  and he argued that now it was too tate. When, then, was the time for his
  client to clear up matters that were so vital to her, and that had already
  caused her so much bitter anguish? He based his chief reproach against Marie
  Cappelle, not on the theft, but on the calumny with which she had tried to
  cover it up. It was the odious story of M. Felix Clavé, and the feared
  blackmail that had alienated the family Léautaud and made them implacable in
  their demand for a complete vindication of the honour of the former Marie de
  Nicolai&mdash;whose name, owing to Marie Cappelle, had been dragged through
  the gutter Press of France.</p>

  <p>These dramatic and emotional sallies apart, very little fresh evidence had
  been gathered in the exasperating affair. The family Clavé had, save for two
  young girls, left France&mdash;possibly with the assistance, the defence
  hinted, of M. Léautaud, the celebrated Felix had disappeared in Mexico.</p>

  <p>M. Corali had, he said, followed up the statement sent by the other M.
  Clavé from Algiers and had discovered that the box that had been sent to this
  gentleman in error had not been sent from Mme. de Léautaud, but from Mme. La
  Rochefoucauld. This, however, was not proved, and this second M. Clavé, in a
  letter that he sent the Court from Africa, still declared that the box had
  been addressed to M. Felix Clavé and came from Mme. de Léautaud.</p>

  <p>When M. Corali flung the words "poisoner&mdash;thief&mdash;slanderer" at
  Marie Cappelle, she sprang to her feet and, passionately breaking her
  disdainful calm, exclaimed: "Coward! those are lies!"</p>

  <p>A commotion followed, the President rang his bell in vain, and M. Lachaud,
  hotly replying to his opponent, demanded permission to call witnesses to the
  immorality of Madame de Léautaud&mdash;"<i>car toute la cause est

  <p>At this interesting point the judge suspended the sitting; when it was
  resumed the case was postponed until the following August and Marie Lafarge,
  always calm and modest, stepped into her carriage to return to her prison and
  her lengthy letters&mdash;that would already have filled several volumes, and
  to enjoy the beautiful white field flowers, sparkling with dew, that her
  friends sent her in order that she might further moisten them with her "tears
  of a martyr" and to deaden her sufferings with drops of laudanum.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The fifth of August, 1841, saw the Tribunal of Tulle again crowded by
  curious spectators and the pale, black-clad prisoner again in her place; M.
  Odilon Barrot was assisting M. Corali; M. Lacombe, M. Lachaud; Madame de
  Léautaud "shone by her absence"; the whole tedious affair was once more gone
  into, with prejudice, with passion, with emotion, with a multitude of legal
  quibbles.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>M. Lachaud's main plea still was that he refused to defend his case until
  he had his witnesses&mdash;in particular M. Felix Clavé; no further delay
  being allowed on this score, Marie Cappelle retired&mdash;after casting a
  severe and disdainful glance at the place where Madame de Léautaud should
  have been, but was not.</p>

  <p>M. Lachaud had found one witness, who declared that shortly before the
  fascinating Felix had left Paris he had received a mysterious 600 francs, and
  another, who declared that the Spaniard had fled from Algiers oppressed by
  debts. He had then, the defence argued, been in serious need of money, and
  had received unaccounted for sums&mdash;the inference was that he had been
  blackmailing Mme. de Léautaud.</p>

  <p>M. Corali had, however, other witnesses who totally denied these tales and
  declared that it was impossible for a debtor to leave Algiers, and that M.
  Felix Clavé was in easy circumstances. Despite all the desperate appeals made
  by Marie Cappelle in the French Press, the Spaniard had not come forward, but
  he had sent from Mexico two letters "to the honour of Madame de Léautaud and
  to the shame of Marie Cappelle" that M. Lachaud refused to credit, declaring
  that they were not genuine, or, if genuine, had been bought.</p>

  <p>M. Lachaud took the opportunity of declaring his absolute belief in the
  innocence of his client and his resolution to devote his life to her cause.
  Part of Marie Cappelle's story was proved true; there had been a suggestion
  of a marriage between herself and M. Delvaux, brother of the governess to
  Marie de Nicolai, and she had several letters from M. Clavé that proved the
  existence of a romantic intrigue between him and the two girls. Madame
  Lafarge <i>mère</i> declared that she had seen the diamonds at Glandier and
  that her daughter-in-law had said they were her own&mdash;a family
  heirloom.</p>

  <p>The sittings of the Court became extremely heated; and the case went by
  default. As soon as she had returned to prison, Marie Cappelle wrote a
  passionate letter, which she sent to the Press and which was eagerly
  published.</p>

  <p>In this document the prisoner stated her anguish at the gross unfairness
  of her trial and declared that she had "been sacrificed to the honour of a
  great lady."</p>

  <p>She declared that, feeble woman as she was, without name or future,
  without even a legal right to the air she breathed, she would always continue
  to protest "before the tribunal of the world, and I <i>shall</i> be acquitted
  by the great voice of the people that is the voice of God."</p>

  <p>She added that she did not envy Madame de Léautaud who had not dared to
  face her in the court&mdash;"believe me, Marie, I was not too weak to serve
  you, I shall not be too weak to fight you. In the bottom of your soul, you
  must esteem me as much as I have the right to despise you...I await strength
  from God, and from Him also I await the hour of your remorse."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the case had been heard in the absence of the prisoner, who
  refused to plead, and Madame de Léautaud appeared in person to receive the
  congratulations and "<i>hommages</i>" of her lawyers and her friends. Marie
  Cappelle wrote another letter to the papers, passionately calling upon M.
  Clavé to appear, and after the case had been heard in her absence, she was
  declared guilty of the theft of the diamonds, but no punishment was
  inflicted, as she was already a life prisoner.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On December 10th the appeal against the verdict of the Court of Tulle on
  the murder charge was heard in the Appeal Court of Paris (cour de cassation)
  before an enormous crowd of fashionables and notabilities, including the
  relations and the friends of the accused. After two days of deliberation the
  Court rejected the appeal, and it seemed that human justice had said the last
  word in the case of Madame Lafarge, who now remained definitely condemned,
  and, in the eyes of the law, dead.</p>

  <p>Out of pity for her state of health and her noble friends the public
  exposure in the market-place of Tulle was omitted from her punishment; nor
  was there any suggestion that "hard labour" (<i>travaux forcés</i>) should be
  inflicted on Marie Lafarge.</p>

  <p>When she received the news that her appeal had been dismissed, the
  prisoner tried to commit suicide by starvation, refusing food and drink for
  several days.</p>

  <p>She was induced to return to life by another gleam of hope brought her by
  her friends. She was encouraged to accept a return to the struggle by a
  report that the mysterious Denis Barbier had confessed, in a moment of
  intoxication, to a reliable witness that he had exchanged the arsenic he had
  bought from the chemist for bicarbonate of soda, which he had given to Marie
  Lafarge. This witness, a respectable doctor, had unaccountably allowed
  Barbier to disappear again after making this statement and had not
  immediately come forward with the information.</p>

  <p>Marie's lawyers at once tried to find Barbier in order to prosecute him
  for perjury, for he had sworn in the court that it was arsenic that he had
  given to Mme. Lafarge. It was impossible, however, to get hold of this man;
  he was leading a vagabond life, and, as he had no domicile in any city, town,
  or village of France it was, technically, impossible to charge him; nor could
  he be charged in the name of Marie Lafarge, now dead in the eyes of the
  law.</p>

  <p>The lawyers traced this scoundrel from one place to another, but before
  they could put the machinery of the law in motion to charge him, he had
  disappeared again. The hope, however, that he might be arrested and charged
  sustained Marie through the first weeks after the failure of her appeal. The
  doctor to whom Denis was alleged to have made this statement died before the
  man could be found, but he left a paper behind in which he solemnly declared
  the truth of his declaration. Madame Lafarge's champions added to the mystery
  of the affair by declaring that they had seen this strange Denis Barbier,
  cloaked like a Spanish conspirator in a nineteenth-century opera, lurking in
  the twilight beneath the walls of the prison of Tulle.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The case against Denis Barbier was summed up by two Prussian lawyers,
  Counsellors in the Criminal Court of Berlin, Herren Temme and Noerner, who
  had carefully followed and studied the Lafarge trial and written an
  exhaustive treatise on it; in their opinion Madame Lafarge should have been
  acquitted completely through lack of proof. In this way the two German
  lawyers put the case against Denis Barbier:</p>

  <p class="letter">It is impossible to avoid a painful sensation every time
  that the image of this Denis Barbier comes before us. The defence presents
  him as a dishonest man, depraved, and boasting of his depravation. He had
  aided Lafarge to commit his forgeries, perhaps even induced him to commit
  them. If these had been discovered before Lafarge's death, both the men would
  have been sent to the galleys. Barbier arrived in Paris some days before the
  sending of the cakes, and in secret. Even at Glandier no one knew he was in
  Paris. Lafarge dare not speak of this visit, his manceuvres must not run any
  risk of being discovered. What was Denis doing in Paris? No one has been able
  to pierce this mystery. When one is dealing with such a man, it is quite
  reasonable to suspect a crime. Is it not possible that this Denis wished to
  remove Lafarge, his accomplice and a witness of his own criminal acts? Was it
  not possible for him to have changed the cakes, even to have been in the
  apartment of Lafarge in Paris, to have opened the packet&mdash;it is
  remembered that Lafarge found the seals broken&mdash;and substituted the
  large poisoned cake? He returned to Glandier three days before his master; he
  had free access to the room of the sick man; he had the same opportunity as
  had the wife of administering the poison. It would be easier to prove a case
  against him than it was to prove one against her. It might easily have been
  he who substituted the bicarbonate of soda for the arsenic, which he used for
  poisoning Lafarge. It must be remembered that he was the one who first cast
  suspicion on Marie Lafarge, that he had at least as powerful a motive for
  getting rid of Charles Lafarge as she had, and that her character was
  infinitely better than his. It is no credit to the magistrates of Tulle that
  this witness's evidence was swallowed whole, that he was not more severely
  cross-examined, and that he was allowed to disappear. He should have been
  arrested and tried, if not for perjury, at least for the fabrication of the
  false bills.</p>

  <p>Against this able reasoning it may be argued that even if it had been
  proved that Barbier substituted bicarbonate of soda for the arsenic that he
  certainly purchased from M. Eyssartier, still it would not have been proved
  that Marie Lafarge had not murdered her husband&mdash;the amount of poison
  that she had bought on December 12th would have been sufficient to kill her
  husband, and this she had had, without question, in her possession.</p>

  <p>As soon as Marie Cappelle was condemned, public opinion swerved in her
  favour. The sad heroine of Glandier was now regarded as an innocent martyr,
  not only by the young, the ardent romantics, the intellectuals, her own
  aristocratic friends, but by the great majority of the people of France.</p>

  <p>She continued to make the most favourable impression on all who came into
  contact with her; hypocrite or saint, there was no questioning the power of
  her personal seduction. The crime, if crime it was, was discussed with the
  same fervour as it had been before the sentence. Everyone agreed that here
  was a baffling mystery, only equalled in obscurity by the maddening enigma of
  the diamonds.</p>

  <p>Marie's lawyers, deeply moved by her misfortune, swore to devote their
  time and energy to seeing that justice was done. It was, however, as they too
  well knew, almost impossible for them to reopen the case.</p>

  <p>Maître Charles Lachaud in particular devoted himself with enthusiasm to
  the cause of Marie Lafarge, with whom he was more than a little in love. The
  letters that they constantly exchanged were couched in high-flown, romantic
  terms of regard and affection.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge had in the intervals between her appearance before the
  Tribunal and her attacks of illness and unconsciousness, been writing
  incessantly in the prison of Tulle. Apart from the numerous letters that she
  had written, Marie Cappelle had put together her <i>Mémoires</i>, which,
  touched up by professional writers, had been published in France and
  translated at once into English with a dedication to the women of England by
  the author herself.</p>

  <p>These <i>Mémoires</i>, lively, witty, charming, not written in any spirit
  of vindictiveness, contained brilliant little pen sketches of Marie's
  friends, relatives and enemies, and a charming picture of her happy childhood
  and girlhood at Villers-Hellon, Paris and Strasbourg; though they were, of
  course, in the nature of special pleading and written with the avowed purpose
  of proving her innocence, Marie Lafarge did not spare herself in these
  <i>Mémoires</i>, but showed, if not all her faults, at least many of
  them.</p>

  <p>This attractive and seductive book did not however do the cause of Mme.
  Lafarge much good. It seems, even, that it roused popular feeling against
  her. Her most sincere friends believed that she was receiving far too much
  publicity and advised her not to write so often to the Press; she refused to
  listen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie found in the prison chamber where she was confined in Tulle a
  writing on the wall, signed by the name "Capel." She learned that this man
  who had borne her name had been confined there sixty years previously, that
  he had been guillotined for a crime that, it was afterwards discovered, he
  had not committed; Marie Cappelle engraved her name under that of the other
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>In the last days of October, 1841, she was moved to the prison at
  Montpellier. She was taken by road to this new imprisonment, where she was
  installed on October 11th, 1841. During this painful journey she was
  subjected to the furies and curiosities of the inhaitants of the towns and
  villages she passed through. At Argentac these demonstrations reached a
  dangerous point; the people crowded round the carriage of the heroine of the
  drama of Glandier with cries of fury, demanding her death. When, however,
  Marie threw back her sombre crape veil, and gazing from the carriage said,
  "What have I done, what do you want with me?"&mdash;a revulsion of feeling
  seized the emotional crowd, who went from one excess to another, and
  demonstrations of a sympathetic pity, almost of affection, replaced the
  threat of death.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>During the fifteen months that her fate had been in suspense she had
  received more than six thousand letters, of which only five or six were
  hostile. The others, and a large number were signed with honourable names,
  were full of affectionate consolation, of enthusiastic protestations of
  belief in the prisoner's innocence, of demands in marriage. Some offered her
  the means of escape, some assured her of golden retreats in a distant
  country; one offered indeed to lead her to that Smyrna where she might taste
  all the ephemeral delights that she had dreamt of so desperately in the
  sordid gloom of Glandier.</p>

  <p>Her misfortune had, under one aspect at least, caused her romantic dreams
  to be realised. She was now indeed, and in the eyes of hundreds of thousands
  of people, a persecuted heroine, a beautiful, seductive, wronged woman
  enduring the most outrageous of injuries. Her name appeared continually in
  the papers, her portrait was frequently reproduced&mdash;a mysterious-looking
  profile with bands of waving black hair and a huge dark eye, and a delicate
  silhouette with bonnet, veil and shawl, were the two favourite
  representations of Marie Lafarge. There was also another, showing her seated
  at a table in her cell, and yet another, showing her sketched face to face
  with Mme. de Léautaud with the disputed <i>parure</i> of diamonds between
  them.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge's cell might be plain, narrow and sad, but she was free
  within it to dream of herself, not only now as a Diana Vernon, but as a Mary,
  Queen of Scots, a Blanche of Castille, even a Run of Arc, for her champions
  did not hesitate to depict her not merely as a foolish woman bitterly
  wronged, but as a saint of the most dazzling purity and glittering Christian
  virtues.</p>

  <p>Her piety, which had been pronounced in her youth but somewhat forgotten
  during her Strasbourg and Paris days, and not much in evidence during her
  brief married life at Glandier, now began to shine with renewed splendour.
  She fell directly under the influence of the nuns and priests who conducted
  the prison for women at Montpellier, and in particular under that of a
  certain Abbé Brunet, who soon came to regard his penitent as not only
  innocent of the crimes of theft and murder, but as a supremely good
  woman.</p>

  <p>Her room gave on to an empty prison court; her sole furniture was a chair
  and a little iron bed poorly covered with coarse cotton sheets; there was a
  stove fed with wood, and a small barred window.</p>

  <p>At first the delicate captive's sufferings were extreme; the cold of the
  first winter she found intense; she could keep warm only by crouching over
  the stove. She was also quite incapable of looking after herself; she had
  always despised small domestic details, which were quite beneath, she
  believed, her lively intelligence.</p>

  <p>"To live for the sake of living&mdash;what misery!" she would exclaim.</p>

  <p>In consequence she did not know how to boil water or milk or how to light
  her stove; after a while she was allowed a female prisoner to wait on her,
  and as her health failed the company of the devoted Clementine Servat; soon
  afterwards her friends were allowed to refurnish completely her cell. She had
  a fine bed, an arm-chair, a writing table, a <i>commode</i> with a washing
  service, mirrors, and much indeed of the luxury to which she had been
  accustomed in Paris. Anyone who wished to see her was given permission to do
  so, all the new books, newspapers and pamphlets were sent her, she was
  allowed materials for sewing and embroidery, and to receive and to write as
  many letters as she wished.</p>

  <p>This distinction between her condition and that of the other female
  prisoners soon caused a scandal in France. The favouritism shown her was put
  down to her illegitimate connection with the royal family, and the Ministers,
  always fearful of arousing democratic and republican feelings, sent orders to
  the Director of the prison at Montpellier to remove from Marie Lafarge's cell
  all the objects of luxury she enjoyed, to restrict her visits and her
  correspondence. She was even ordered to take off the widow's dress she had
  hitherto worn and to put on that uniform worn by the other prisoners. This
  she refused to do, preferring to remain continually in bed.</p>

  <p>The Director of the prison himself gave her the wise advice to struggle no
  longer with the inevitable and to cease writing those long, impassioned,
  half-hysterical letters to the Press, to her friends, to strangers who wrote
  to her so frequently.</p>

  <p>"Allow yourself to be forgotten, Madame. Let it seem that you are dead.
  Only on that condition will you ever come to life again."</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge refused to listen to this good advice. She continued to send
  from her cell at Montpellier shrill cries of despair, passionate
  protestations of innocence, lamentations, warm expressions of gratitude to
  those who believed in her, dignified rebukes to her enemies.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She found a definite if sombre pleasure in the part she was forced to play
  and flung herself into the role of wronged, stainless heroine as ardently as
  she had cast her brilliant talents into the part of the reserved,
  misunderstood child, the society <i>belle</i>, the fastidious bride.</p>

  <p>She could now be assured of a wider audience than she could possibly have
  once hoped for&mdash;she was more famous than actress or singer, than any
  queen or courtesan, she had more would-be lovers, more offers of marriage,
  more delicious, sentimental, romantic friendships than any princess, than any
  heiress.</p>

  <p>In Clé she had a devotion seldom to be found outside the pages of a novel;
  in Emma Pontier, and later, in Adèle Collard, she had ideal friendships with
  members of her own sex; among the most famous men of the day she had ardent
  champions. Dark misfortunes had raised her above the common lot of women; her
  destiny might be frightful but it was not <i>bourgeois</i>; better to be in a
  cell in Montpellier with world-wide publicity than sharing the miserable
  economies of Glandier with the family Lafarge, unknown to her
  contemporaries.</p>

  <p>Moreover, her shocking fate gave her a poignant affinity with the gloomy,
  cursed figures that wandered through the pages of her beloved novelists and
  poets; she belonged now to the unhappy sisterhood that included <i>Lélia</i>
  and <i>Indiana</i>, <i>Amy Robsart, Edmée</i> and the other more shadowy
  heroines who crept in and out of the shelves of the circulating
  libraries.</p>

  <p>She could not take down her volume of Byron and read the stage directions
  from <i>Manfred</i>: "A Gothic Gallery at Midnight, storm without, Manfred
  alone..." without feeling that she too was one of this lost company of
  immortal sufferers.</p>

  <p>In Montpellier there were many drowsy opium-blurred hours in which to
  dream of Smyrna and the incredible islands of Florida, to indulge that
  haunting nostalgia for the impossible land where dreams came true, that
  drugged and maddened all the romantics. There were moments when reality broke
  through this web of sombre but seductive imaginings, when the prisoner
  realised her drab walls, her cotton curtains, her drugget dress, her barred
  windows, the stigma across her name, and then the awakened dreamer cried
  aloud in an unbearable agony that her anxious doctors had to quiet with doses
  of laudanum that every time were increased in strength.</p>

  <h3><a name="ch-03-08"
     id="ch-03-08"></a>8. BRIDE OF MISFORTUNE</h3>

  <p>On November 11th, 1841, Marie Cappelle, Widow Lafarge, was lodged in what
  was termed the <i>matson centrale</i>, the prison for women at Montpellier.
  She had been sent there, if not at her own request, certainly to her own
  advantage, because her great-uncle&mdash;her beloved grandfather's brother,
  M. Collard&mdash;resided in this district. He had from the first shown
  himself Marie's ardent champion, and had done all in his power to alleviate
  her misfortune.</p>

  <p>His daughter took the place of Emma Ponder, who had been forced to return
  to her relatives in the Limousin, as guardian angel of the prisoner, and he
  was willing that his son should marry the condemned woman if and when she
  obtained her long-hoped-for release. Another cousin, son of Mme. de Martens,
  was also willing to marry the prisoner of Montpellier. Both these offers,
  which seem to have been made in rather a fantastic spirit of chivalry and
  romantic extravagance, Marie Cappelle refused, though she did not deny to
  either of the suitors her inevitable letters.</p>

  <p>Whatever her behaviour might have been before her sentence, and whether
  she was guilty or not, her conduct during her imprisonment was
  unexceptionable. Nothing could have been more delicate, more high-toned,
  refined and idealistic than the numerous letters sent out of her prison. She
  kept up a correspondence, not only with her relatives and friends, but with
  all the notable men who had championed her cause and with many of the unknown
  sympathisers who had written to her or sent her presents.</p>

  <p>Two years after her sentence, much of this correspondence, together with a
  detailed account of her trial, was published in two volumes at Brussels by M.
  René, the editor and publisher of the <i>Mémoires</i>. The four
  books&mdash;two volumes of <i>Mémoires</i>, two of <i>Correspondances</i> and
  accounts of the trial&mdash;were issued together as propaganda in favour of
  Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>The whole affair of the poisoning and the diamonds was gone into most
  laboriously by M. René, who also published letters from several lawyers and
  public men who had gone minutely into the case and considered Marie Cappelle
  innocent.</p>

  <p>Francois Raspail kept up a warfare with the other chemist Orfila, striving
  to prove that he had been mistaken in believing he had found arsenic in the
  remains of Charles Lafarge, and arguing that even if he had, the small
  quantity he alleged he had dis-covered would not account for the vast amount
  with which Marie Cappelle was said to have dosed her husband during fifteen
  days.</p>

  <p>The French Press, that had not spared either Marie Cappelle or Mme. de
  Léautaud during the trial, continued to print fantastic and scandalous
  stories of the private lives of both these aristocratic young ladies, and
  this paper war of ignoble slander did much to intensify the bitterness
  between the two families. It had become like a clan or party feud. People
  took sides either with the family of Marie Cappelle or with the family
  Léautaud, and reason and decency were lost in the struggle.</p>

  <p>Marie's lawyers, absolutely convinced of her innocence, left no stone
  unturned to secure a reopening of the case or her pardon. As she was in the
  eyes of the French law civilly dead, their task was of extraordinary
  difficulty. Petitions were presented to the King and to the Queen, and
  Marie's defenders, as well as a large portion of the populace of France,
  thought that this was a case towards which the King might have extended his
  mercy and his pity. Why Louis-Philippe did not do so remains a mystery. The
  excuse given by him and his Ministers, and by the Queen, who personally
  declared herself convinced of the innocence of Marie Cappelle, was that a
  scandal would be caused by showing favour to one now well known to be
  closely, if illegitimately, connected with the House of Orleans, which
  somewhat uneasily occupied the throne of France.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>M. Charles Lachaud wished to devote the rest of his life to the service of
  Marie Cappelle and to take up his residence at Montpellier. He was dissuaded
  from this course by Marie herself, who urged him to go to Paris and follow
  his destiny, which seemed to be a brilliant one; he obeyed her and a long
  correspondence took place between them. Marie's letters breathed the most
  delicate gratitude, the most tender respect, and that kirid of idealistic,
  romantic love in which she had already indulged on paper in at least two
  instances, the young apothecary Guyot and her husband Charles Lafarge.</p>

  <p>When M. Lachaud had nothing more to do in her case, and there was no
  excuse of legal matters to be discussed between them, the correspondence
  gradually ceased; Lachaud married, but all his life preserved a romantic
  attachment for Marie Cappelle; he became one of the most famous lawyers at
  the French Bar and died suddenly of a seizure when pleading a case. When he
  was removed in an unconscious condition to an ante-chamber, the attendant who
  opened his coat and shirt found the miniature of Marie Lafarge hanging above
  his heart.</p>

    <p class="caption">Louis-Philippe, King of the French<br>

  </div><br>

  <p>Not only did Marie Cappelle write letters of fervent gratitude, admiration
  and love to all her friends and supporters, she wrote dignified and scathing
  letters to her enemies, addressing one to M. Orfila, several to the Press
  against the family Léautaud, and, in short, left no opportunity of giving
  publicity to her case unexploited.</p>

  <p>She was warned by several, who affected to be her good friends, the humane
  Director of the prison, her Confessor, that this blaze of publicity was bad
  for her cause and was creating such a sensation and such a scandal in France
  that it would be impossible for those in authority to release her; she
  refused to listen and the Press continued to supply its readers with
  protests, recriminations, laments, petitions and arguments from the pen of
  Marie Cappelle and her defenders, as well as sensational details about her
  life, both at Montpellier and before her condemnation.</p>

  <p>The result of this was that she was not allowed to receive or to write so
  many letters, and the luxuries that her friends had freely supplied her with
  were cut down; nor was she allowed any longer to receive the pamphlets and
  newspapers in which her case was exploited. The prisoner took this procedure
  so much to heart that she left untouched at the door of her cell such papers
  and letters as she was allowed to receive.</p>

  <p>Apart from this burning obsession of obtaining the rehabilitation of her
  honour, the prisoner had two powerful factors in her life, those that have
  influenced most prisoners. Like Mary, Queen of Scots, she became absorbed in
  her health of mind and body; the doctors and the priests who were her
  constant attendants received all her confidences, and when she was not
  concerning herself with the miserable state of her health, she was struggling
  for resignation to the will of God and trying to console herself with the
  hopes of a martyr's palm in Heaven. Her constitution, always delicate, had
  deteriorated with shocking rapidity after her sentence; she passed days,
  sometimes weeks, in bed, in a half-unconscious condition; she suffered from
  atrocious pains in the head, from heart attacks, from fainting fits, fevers
  and a continual cough. The doctors, who in every way showed themselves humane
  and devoted, diagnosed her case as consumption of the lungs, complicated with
  heart disease and extreme nervous debility.</p>

  <p>Her own letters paint a state of health so appalling that it seems
  marvellous she could have resisted as long as she did. Her sufferings, both
  physical and mental, were truly intense. Apart from the humiliation of her
  position, she was deprived of all those luxuries that had become second
  nature to her. Her various accomplishments, which she had taken such pains to
  acquire and which she had so enjoyed exercising, were now completely denied
  to her. No longer could she on a white steed imagine herself to be Diana
  Vernon, no longer could she sit at her Pleyel piano playing Mozart, Haydn, a
  romance of Chopin or Liszt, no longer could she exercise her harmonious, soft
  and well-trained voice in some languishing love idyll, no more show her
  superb figure and her exquisite art in leading the dance, as she had led it
  for the last time in the ball at Brives when, as she had written to her
  aunts, she had appeared "deliciously attired in a double-flounced, white
  muslin robe wreathed with marguerites," with marguerites in her hair and at
  her breast, waltzing to a melody by Johann Strauss.</p>

  <p>She who had, to the point of passion, loved all that was delicate, dainty,
  fastidious and sophisticated, was now forced to reduce herself to the bare
  necessaries of life, comforted only by the few luxuries that her friends were
  allowed now and then to send her. She had a few books and read continuously;
  her sleepless nights were occupied in devouring the luscious pages of George
  Sand, the heroic romances of Walter Scott, the lurid poems of Lord Byron,
  supplemented by the Bible, Rousseau and a few classic authors.</p>

  <p>When her health permitted, she studied Greek and Latin, and with her
  astonishing quickness and application, soon knew the dead languages well
  enough to venture on some translations. Everyone who met her was favourably
  impressed with her intelligence, her sweetness, her delicacy and her pious
  resignation; only the nuns and the doctors saw her occasional and frightful
  fits of frantic despair.</p>

  <p>She fell much under the influence of the Director of Religious Instruction
  at Montpellier, the Abbé Brunet, and her letters to him when he was moved to
  another post were so full of touching resignation and candid piety that the
  good priest kept them to show to his other penitents as examples of
  "Christian thought." The Abbé Coural, another of her spiritual comforters,
  was so impressed by her as to present a personal petition on her behalf to
  the Queen, the prudish daughter of King Big Nose.</p>

  <p>The question of the drugget dress (<i>robe de bure</i>) that she was
  supposed to wear came up again at Montpellier. At first she refused to put on
  this convict garb, declaring she would pass all her time in bed; but her
  Confessor was able to induce her to look upon this garment, not as a mark of
  degradation, but as the insignia of martyrdom. Under this persuasion Marie
  Cappelle donned and wore for the remainder of her imprisonment the same
  uniform as that worn by the other women prisoners; she even began to take the
  same pleasure in it as she had once taken in her garlands of lilies, her
  veils of <i>point d'Angleterre</i>, her green <i>amazone</i>, for she felt
  the aureole gild her forehead.</p>

  <p>She made friends with the nuns who nursed in the Infirmary, and often,
  when her own health permitted, assisted them in their labours, arbitrated in
  their disputes and reported them to the Abbé Brunet. She proved herself a
  docile, intelligent and kind nurse, and those who watched her remembered the
  report of Doctor Bardon, that during those dreadful days at Glandier
  "everybody in the house had lost her head except Madame Charles, who showed
  coolness and courage."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie Cappelle found time partly to write another volume, entitled
  <i>Hours of Prison (Heures de Prison)</i> in which, in her high-flown,
  romantic style broken here and there by passages of acute observation and
  gentle irony, she related her daily life and the thoughts that haunted her in
  prison; this, unfinished, was not published until after her death.</p>

  <p>The publication of her letters aroused the enthusiasm of her champions to
  frenzy. She was, in the extravagant language of the time, termed a "Francesca
  da Rimini," a "Pia dei Tolemei," an "Iphigenia," an "Ariadne," and celebrated
  under such fantastic titles as "Angel of Arsenic," "Bride of Misfortune,"
  "Muse of the Prison," and "Wounded Dove Trailing her Broken Wings towards the
  Tomb."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Alexandre Dumas, Jacques Jasmin, Emile de Girardin were among the
  celebrated men who warmly and openly expressed their belief in the innocence
  of Marie Cappelle; Jasmin sent her a copy of his poems, which she read
  carefully, returning an extremely acute and delicate criticism of the
  work.</p>

  <p>Emile de Girardin was one of the champions of Peytel, who was executed for
  a triple murder, and who had assisted Girardin in the editorship of <i>Le
  Voleur</i>; this elegant journalist, who was of good birth, had subsequently
  edited a journal that Marie Cappelle must often have turned over in her
  happier days&mdash;<i>La Mode</i>, that was issued under the patronage of the
  charming, squinting Duchesse de Berri, queen of romantics.</p>

  <p>After the revolution of 1830, Girardin had devoted himself to journalism
  that was, in the literal sense of the word, cheap; in La Presse he issued the
  first penny (<i>deux sous</i>) newspaper. Soon after, he killed in a duel the
  republican leader Armand Carrell, who had taken the high-flown tone that to
  issue cheap newspapers was an insult to letters; Girardin fought three other
  duels in the same cause and made a success of his commercial enterprise. When
  he championed Marie Cappelle he was a member of the <i>Chambre de Députés</i>
  and an influential person in Parisian life; he lived to thrust, in 1849, an
  act of abdication under the dazed eyes of Louis-Philippe, to bundle him into
  a hackney carriage, and to face the mob shouting "Confidence, confidence!" He
  was subsequently imprisoned, and then retired into private life, amusing
  himself by revising the formidable masses of paper that he had, during an
  active life, found time to cover with ink.</p>

  <p>Such was one of the most ardent champions of "the dark muse of prison."
  Girardin, an accomplished journalist, an audacious <i>arriviste</i>,
  satisfied not only his chivalry and love of justice by his partisanship of
  the notorious Marie, but also, with a nice sense of the popular taste,
  supplied his readers with copious sensational details of the Lafarge-Léautaud
  cases.</p>

  <p>The grateful letters of Marie Cappelle were highly gratifying to Girardin,
  as a man, a romantic and a publicist; he never ceased his efforts to obtain,
  if not her pardon, her release.</p>

  <p>Jacques Jasmin was a different type from the dashing Girardin, but he was
  a character likely to appeal to the taste of Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>This peasant poet had revived the old Romance language of the Troubadours
  and in this dialect composed verses very well suited to the period of the
  Gothic revival; he was of picturesque descent, had a hunch-backed father, a
  lame mother and had had no schooling.</p>

  <p>Inspired by Chateaubriand's essay on Robert Burns, Jasmin strove to do for
  the South of France what the Scot had done for his native land; he used to
  recite his poems himself and gave to charity the large sums that he earned in
  this manner. His subjects were of a fashionable gloominess&mdash;<i>L'Abugio
  de Castel Cuillé</i>, rather unfortunately "rendered into English" by
  Longfellow, told "with exquisite pathos" of a girl, who, forsaken by her
  lover because she is disfigured by disease, dies, if not to slow music, to
  slow verse. Most of his other themes were similar; it was, then, hardly
  surprising if the tender-hearted Jasmin, so used to dwelling on the woes of
  imaginary heroines, should feel a lively sympathy with the mournful prisoner
  of Montpellier.</p>

  <p>On the other hand "the poor Marie," as she so often called herself, found
  a severe, even bitter critic, in another famous figure of literary Paris,
  Jules Janin, who, detesting the romantics, had begun by parodying Victor Hugo
  in <i>L'âne mort, et la femme guillotinée</i>, and who found his vocation as
  one of the most acute and brilliant critics of the day; his weekly theatrical
  articles in the <i>Débats</i> were famous; he edited most of the French
  classics and wrote several fine novels quiet untinged by romanticism; Janin
  translated the Odes of Horace and wrote an astringent account of the Great
  Exhibition in London 1851; such an intellect, dry, shrewd, ironic, loathing
  sentimentality and all the luscious, enervating trappings of romance, was not
  likely to be impressed with the exasperating case of Marie Lafarge.</p>

  <p>He thought her an audacious criminal, an accomplished hypocrite, and said
  so in the columns of the <i>Débats</i>, adding his opinion that it was a
  disgrace to French letters that this woman was allowed so exhaustive a
  hearing and accorded so many partisans; the <i>Mémoires</i> in particular
  disgusted the fastidious classicist. Every rogue who got into prison wrote
  some trash that was, out of sheer sensationalism, accorded a hysterical
  reception.</p>

  <p>Jules Janin protested haughtily&mdash;"the names of a Lacenaire, a Peytel,
  a Marie Lafarge, soil the pages of French literature."</p>

  <p>This icy attack was furiously answered by the prisoner's friends and she
  herself treated it with saintly disdain.</p>

  <p>But it did her harm; Janin's reputation was high, and the man in the
  street was inclined to respect the judgment of the sensitive and penetrating
  critic of the <i>Débats</i> rather than the emotional and excited assertions
  of men like Girardin and Jasmin and Dumas, who were obviously pledged to be
  the champion of any <i>femme fatale</i>.</p>

  <p>It may be questioned if among Marie's champions was one as cool-headed, as
  well-trained, as experienced, both in life and letters, as Jules Janin.</p>

  <p>On one point Marie scored a triumph over her dangerous enemy; Janin had
  "made" Rachel by his enthusiastic praise, then quarrelled with her and tried
  in vain to "unmake" her; perhaps because of this, perhaps because of a
  natural sympathy with a sister actress and fellow-romantic, when Rachel went
  to Montpellier she gave the prisoner of the <i>maison centrale</i> a specimen
  of that dramatic art that brought all fashionable Paris to the Théâtre
  Francais to hear the daughter of a Jew pedlar declaim the incredibly noble
  and sonorous lines of Pierre Corneille.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Ariane, ma soeur, de quel amour blessée.<br>
  Vous mourûtes aux bords où vous fûtes laissée..."</p>

  <p>There was much in common between the two women, the descendant of the
  corrupt <i>branche cadette des Bourbons</i> and the descendant of nameless
  Jew beggars; Rachel Félix, daughter of a mother who kept a rag shop, had as
  much regal grace and fascinating charm as the daughter of that exquisite
  <i>mondaine</i> Caroline Collard.</p>

  <p>These two women were much of an age, had large black eyes, swathes of
  black hair, and each was troubled by the dry cough that foretold the disease
  that would one day kill her.</p>

  <p>Before the enraptured prisoner in her sacrificial dress of drugget, the
  <i>tragédienne</i> in her classic robes declaimed with solemn passion the
  anguish of <i>Phèdre</i>, symbolic of all the agonies of the victims of Venus
  Libitina and the stately heroics of <i>Athalie</i>.</p>

  <p>Jacques Jasmin also visited Marie and tried to make her monotonous life a
  little less dreary by reciting <i>The Blind Girl</i> and his famous <i>Martha
  the Madwoman</i>, that had drawn more tears than any pathetic poem ever
  published, Jasmin's admirers claimed.</p>

  <p>Whether Marie could understand the obsolete dialect of the Troubadours
  sufficiently to appreciate the finer points of <i>Marthe la Folle</i> is
  doubtful, but she wrote a letter of thanks to Jasmin, criticising his work
  that, when it was published, Sainte-Beuve, the great supporter of Jasmin,
  found worthy of a professional pen.</p>

  <p>In these letters to the kind poet, Marie introduced, with telling effect,
  her own case&mdash;"Voltaire saved Calas&mdash;sing to me, monsieur, and
  perhaps I shall also return from the dead. I am innocent!..."</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle was mistaken in thinking that Voltaire had saved Calas; a
  similar vagueness touched her praise of Jasmin&mdash;"Your muse is a
  Christian virgin, but she is coquettishly crowned with the roses and violets
  once worn by Tibullus, Horace and Anacreon."</p>

  <p>She concluded her smooth praises of the poet with a trite axiom that, if
  her own account of her case was true, she had not proved correct&mdash;"If
  great actions bring glory, good actions bring happiness."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Yet with all this excitement in her favour, with the publication both in
  Germany and in England of scathing reports on the partiality and injustice of
  her trial, no headway was made in having her case reopened, nor was it even
  possible to obtain a pardon for Marie Cappelle, which would have left the
  question of her guilt or innocence untouched. Nor did the French police make
  any serious attempt to secure Denis Barbier.</p>

  <p>The affair of the diamonds remained mysterious. M. Felix Clavé, supposed
  to be in Mexico, did not appear; it might even have been doubted whether such
  a person had existed save in the romantic imagination of two young girls, had
  not his letters to Marie Cappelle been published among her other
  correspondence. These were such as did honour to the mysterious young man,
  being couched in high-flown, idealistic and romantic language. They supported
  rather Marie Cappelle's version of the story than that of Mme. de Léautaud,
  since they did not appear to be the letters of a man at all likely to
  threaten blackmail or even to cause a woman apprehension on that score.</p>

  <p>As this important witness did not appear the public could believe as they
  liked, either that he had seen Marie de Nicolai only once in the street and
  spoken to her only for a moment at a ball, that all the letters that had
  passed in this schoolgirl affair had been written by Marie Cappelle, or they
  could believe Marie Cappelle's version of a long and dangerous coquetry
  between the handsome stranger and Marie de Nicolai that had ended in her fear
  of blackmail.</p>

  <p>The point whether or no M. Clavé had ever appeared in the chorus of
  <i>William Tell</i> was also not to be cleared up, though the Press continued
  to publish exasperating surmises, hints and innuendoes on the subject. Had
  Mme. de Léautaud admitted that Marie Cappelle's story was true and that she
  had in a moment of foolish agitation given her the diamonds, her reputation
  could hardly have suffered more than it did now, exposed to all the malicious
  devices of the prisoner's journalistic friends.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>As her health declined Marie Cappelle began to make extensive use of
  drugs; her doctors supplied her with laudanum, morphia and opium, which she
  took in increasing quantities, sometimes for days together not accepting any
  nourishment. It began to be a torture to her to be deprived of this laudanum,
  and some of her letters are full of bitter complaints against the nuns or the
  doctors who kept from her what she considered necessary doses to alleviate
  her constant and terrible pain. These outbursts were, however, invariably
  followed by expressions of regret and contrition.</p>

  <p>Her family, though continuing to live in Paris, often visited her, all
  save her sister Antonine, Madame de Violaine, who, though she had shown
  herself at first enthusiastic in Marie's cause, seems to have gradually
  separated herself from the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle's aunts and uncles paid dearly for the imprudence that had
  allowed them to accept a stranger as a husband for their niece. They nearly
  beggared themselves in her defence; it does not appear that she was given any
  of the considerable sums of money that her <i>Mémoires</i> and other works,
  sold all over Europe, must have brought in, and her dowry had been entirely
  swallowed up in the bankruptcy of Glandier.</p>

  <p>The elder Mme. Lafarge and her daughter, Mme. Buffière, disappeared out of
  the story and lived quietly in the Limousin. They did not, however, escape
  the severest strictures cast on them by Marie's champions, who pointed out
  with much bitterness the extraordinary part that the elder Mme. Lafarge had
  played in the tragedy of Glandier&mdash;breaking open the envelope of the
  will entrusted to her, having it altered by the lawyers, and accepting so
  readily and spreading so bitterly the story of Marie's poisoning of her
  husband.</p>

  <p>It was also again brought up against the elder Mme. Lafarge that she had
  committed the hideous cruelty of telling her dying son that his wife had
  poisoned him, and that, before his body was cold, she had ransacked and
  pillaged the house, driving her daughter-in-law out of her room while she
  broke open her desk and stole her papers.</p>

  <p>Neither of these women, however, was brought to book for this behaviour,
  and they remained silent under the charges that were openly circulated
  against them. In the review of the trial and the <i>Mémoires</i> published in
  the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of 1842, the writer, after inveighing against the
  injustice of which Marie Cappelle had been the victim, concluded by saying
  that the mother was by no means free from suspicion, the inference being that
  the old woman, in a frenzy of hatred for her daughter-in-law, and distracted
  by the financial ruin she saw ahead, had poisoned her son in order to secure
  her daughter-in-law's fortune and to get rid of her by making her appear
  guilty of the crime.</p>

  <p>Emma Pontier married unromantically into respectable dullness and settled
  in the Limousin; she became the mother of a large family, continued always to
  believe in the innocence of Marie, and to declare, as she had declared at the
  trial, that she had taken the box of arsenic out of Marie's apron pocket, not
  because she feared she was going to poison her husband with it, but because
  she thought she might, overwhelmed by the unjust charges made against her,
  attempt suicide.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie Cappelle's remarkable correspondence, not written, as her admirers
  were careful to point out, with any idea of publicity, but nevertheless
  published, most of it during her lifetime, can be illustrated by the
  following extracts, typical of the tone and subject matter of the hundreds of
  letters that she wrote during her confinement in Tulle and Montpellier. One
  to her lawyer, M. Bac, refers to one of her persistent day-dreams, that
  Smyrna that she had declared she would fly to in her fatal letter of August
  15th:</p>

  <p class="letter">M. D&mdash;&mdash; T&mdash;&mdash; has been giving me
  details about Smyrna. After the street of roses, after the perfumed allée
  that you know of, there is a great wood with ravines, rocks and cascades.
  There one goes to find shade and charming walks in which to stroll. While the
  horses that have brought you there are feeding on boughs of lauriers-roses,
  you suspend hammocks beside the stream, and there you rest enjoying pleasant
  conversation during the burning hours of the day. Towards night some slave
  sings you a sad, sweet, monotonous song. We will not have slaves, but if my
  voice is sweet to you, O my friend, it will try to pierce your dreams. In
  each house there are charming bathrooms, perfumed, tepid, vaporous. This is a
  more selfish pleasure, but this isolation in the water and the perfume are
  still very sweet. One easily receives letters and books from Europe, often
  French travellers will pass to stay some days and take back with them some
  remembrances of your happiness in the heart of an enemy who still recalls
  you. Dream with me. Do we love less the brilliant little stars of our sky
  because they are so far from us?</p>

  <p>Then, to M. Lachaud:</p>

  <p class="letter">Alas, if I were still a young woman, free, esteemed, loved,
  what joy I should take in your affection; how proud I should be of your
  success if I were worthy to share it. Irreparable, irreparable! I touch my
  forehead, which burns under the sign of degradation. I shall cease to write
  to you, I shall open my "Imitation of Christ" and I shall repeat to you the
  words with which God has inspired me. "Lord, You see the desire of my heart.
  May it be that of Your Will, all that is done is in Your Name. Give me what
  You will, as much as You will, and when You will. I am in Your hands; I am
  Your servant, submissive to any affliction."</p>

  <p>Again, a few days later:</p>

  <p class="letter">Ah, you are great and pure, my friend. How different you
  are from other men, and how few of them are capable of understanding your
  virtues! Do not speak to me of your "weakness" when I mean to overwhelm you
  with my gratitude! Never have I been better understood than by you, never has
  a holy affection given me so much strength and courage as has yours!</p>

  <p>To another friend she wrote, in the early days of her imprisonment, these
  words:</p>

  <p class="letter">I breathe more at my ease in knowing that you are free
  under this beautiful sky, reposing among the perfume of the flowers. It seems
  to me that you must be happy in the middle of the beauties of nature. As for
  myself, I will not regret your company and I enjoy the thought of everything
  that makes you happy. In the evening when it is not yet quite dark, but when
  the light has nearly gone, I think of you and feel as if I was approaching
  your great chair, where perhaps you are dreaming, sadly thinking of me. I say
  to you words such as you used to love, some words of confidence, then also
  some words of despair. To the first you give a sweet smile of acceptance, to
  the others a stern rebuke. Then your mother, so good, so tender, you wake her
  by a kiss, and you talk to her in a low voice of the poor, traduced woman.
  Teach her to love me. I merit it. For me, I love her enough to sacrifice
  without hesitation your presence to her desire. I live in a complete
  solitude, my windows look out on to emptiness. I have, indeed, a great need
  to put a little order into my soul and calm into my spirit. Solitude that
  tortures the heart stimulates the thought. That is its strength, as suffering
  is its dignity. I am going to read a mountain of newspapers. I understand now
  the danger and the usefulness of the Press. Tell me what they are saying
  among your mountains, tell me if your people have belief in and pity for me.
  Adieu, adieu. The thought of you often comes to fill the emptiness of my days
  and calm the agonies of my nights.</p>

  <p>When some of her visitors tried to tell Marie Cappelle in a cool but
  friendly fashion that she was living in a world of fantasy and that facts
  were all against her, she deeply resented this touch of realism, as the
  following letter to an unknown correspondent shows. A certain "M. S." had
  been warning her of the horrors of her position:</p>

  <p class="letter">M. S.&mdash;&mdash; has told me that the worst is being
  hidden from me, that I am surrounded by young people full of illusions who
  would ruin me by their fantasies, that the scaffold is not a romance, that I
  am surrounding myself with an aureola of improbabilities that would never be
  understood by the jury. I replied: "I am quite capable of seeing the approach
  of death without fear, and I leave remorse and horror to the guilty one, I
  know how to endure to see the sword suspended over my head when my innocence
  is painted on my forehead, my friends are strong enough to tell me all the
  truth, I despise the world and so on. I am overwhelmed by this cold reason
  that tries to freeze the soul. Let death come; it will find me resigned and
  smiling, martyred and loved. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>To the faithful M. Lachaud, in 1841, she sent this little picture of
  romantic misery:</p>

  <p class="letter">I was in much pain again yesterday. Last night the storm
  cut the sky into zigzags of fire. The heat was stifling. Worn out with
  presentiments and profound regret, timid, discouraged, nervous, I opened my
  window, and rested my burning head against the bars dashed with rain. I wept,
  I became icy cold, and this morning I had the most frightful agony in my head
  and ears. I had to force my courage to write to you, that is tormented even
  by the effort of breaking open the envelope of your letter.</p>

  <p>When Mlle. Adèle Collard sent her some family portraits including that of
  her beloved grandfather, Marie Cappelle answered with this letter:</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear little sister, I embrace you twice, three, four
  times, and then I am silent, for I have had this evening such violent pains
  in the head, augmented by a heavy cold that I spare you the stupid remarks
  that my state would reduce me to. A thousand respectful tendernesses to your
  good mother. My uncle is at his post of guardian angel, close to my couch.
  You three well-beloved beings are my first and my last thoughts. When I see
  my grandfather smiling at me from the picture, it seems to me that he
  encourages me and that now the contempt of other men means nothing to me at
  all. I feel myself strong. I feel myself great and worthy of affection. All
  those whom I have truly loved are in Heaven, they will save me, they will
  bless me. The immensity of my sufferings has certainly effaced the
  inconsequences and the faults of my foolish mind, and if I am the humiliation
  of those who love me I am nevertheless the joy and the pride of those who
  wait for me in Heaven. You grumble at me because I sometimes desire death,
  but don't you understand who is waiting for me in Heaven, that I shall see
  them again, that I shall be there without stain, that in Heaven a true
  rehabilitation awaits me? Oh, that I could have wings to leave this valley of
  tears, to cast off this mantle of degradation that men have cast on me! Poor
  child, may God preserve you from this torture of calumny. At twenty-four
  years of age they have made of me a pariah. I am a humiliation for my family,
  a sorrow for my friends. No man dares love me; anyone who dared to unite his
  life to mine would be thrown out from society as infamous. The child who
  called me mother would be cursed by men. Oh, understand then that I love
  death, and that I wish to die. Adieu, mon Adèle. I will love you enough to
  say to you, I love you.&mdash;Marie.</p>

  <p>The long correspondence with Abbé Brunet is largely filled with passages
  full of religious exaltation. Marie Cappelle saw herself as a Magdalene, a
  penitent, sometimes even as a saint. These ecstatic letters are also full of
  a warm affection for the priest, who had professed so openly his belief in
  the innocence of the prisoner:</p>

  <p class="letter">Can I call you my brother? from the bottom of the soul.
  With all the strength of my soul, can I vow for you the affection that a
  sister vows to her brother? With all the force of my heart, can I hope that
  you will give me a little of that fraternal friendship that I offer you so
  completely? I can write to you as I wish, can I not, or will it be too much?
  If I have need of advice, of consolation, can I turn towards you, my brother?
  Can I count on you without fearing, in waiting for your response, that I have
  shown myself indiscreet? My letters are to you alone. God alone will judge
  them, and I do not fear for them this judgment of the Lord. You talk to me of
  my health. Alas, it is too good, or too bad, why am I not ripe for Heaven, I
  also? Why, according to your own superb expression, have not "my tears
  brought to maturity the crown of thorns that death prepares for me on the
  threshold of eternity?" So young, and so rich in love, to die! To die, when
  so many poor creatures with nothing to attach them to life, useless to all,
  by all forgotten, continue to live. Ah, these thrustful contradictions that
  with each step baffle us! The Queen, the Duchess of Orleans, the Maréchale
  Gérard, the Marquise de Mornay have most nobly interested themselves in my
  cause. The Queen has charged M. Hébert to say that she believes in my
  innocence: "Tell Marie Cappelle that I have wept in reading her letter, that
  she shall not weep any more because I am watching over her fate." You will
  understand, my brother, these words seem to me more sweet than a promise of
  liberty. It is not from a longing for restoration to life that I suffer, but
  for restoration to honour.</p>

  <p>In these letters to the Abbé Brunet, Marie Cappelle spoke of a drama that
  she was writing entitled <i>A Lost Woman</i>. This was never published and
  the manuscript seems to have disappeared; the tide suggests that in this
  theatrical effort Marie Cappelle had once more dramatised herself and her
  life.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle continued other labours while in prison; she rejoiced to
  make delicate objects in embroidery for her friends. One is reminded of the
  exquisite pieces of needlework Mary, Queen of Scots, embroidered for her son
  and for Queen Elizabeth. For the wife of M. Lacombe, the Limousin lawyer who
  had become one of her champions, and for several of their friends, doctors
  and lawyers who had laboured in her behalf, the prisoner sent several of
  these little objects worked by her own hands, and with them this letter,
  typical of her delicacy of thought and expression:</p>

  <p class="letter">I send to you two little poppies that I have embroidered
  for your wife, three little pens, also my own work, for our philosopher M.
  Regert, and the good doctor, a little packet for M. de Laspeyrie. A living
  creature would not dare to send to those whom she loved these poor little
  objects, but a poor, dead creature uses her rights and her privileges. One
  learns that sufferings weaken the fingers, that tear-drops too often end in
  feeble sight. It is not so easy to finish a work of labour and of patience.
  For six months I have commenced two fans for your chimney-piece and my
  wretched head will not allow me to finish them. Pardon me. If one embroidered
  with one's heart nothing would equal the talent, strength and rapidity with
  which Marie would work for those whom she loved. Adieu, dear and respected
  support of my nothingness. Be happy, my prayers are all for you. Do not
  forget me. My hope is all in you. I send you a little picture of myself. The
  window against which I am leaning is that of my cell, it gives on to the
  courtyard of the prison. Beneath my window are bell-flowers and other
  blossoms sown by my hand. When my picture was taken the sun was not strong
  enough to show my features, so they allowed me to take off the black robe
  that as a rule I must wear and put on a white garment. If you read a smile in
  my eyes, take it, dear friend, it is addressed to you.</p>

  <p>On other occasions despair became the ruling emotion of the prisoner, and
  she vented her agonies in passages like the following, addressed to Charles
  Lachaud:</p>

  <p class="letter">Ah, how black and humiliating the grilles of my prison
  windows are! How sad my cell is. The poor flowers that I have here are all
  faded, and I am far from you. All to-day I have felt feeble and discouraged.
  I have said over piously my prayers for a dear, absent one without drawing
  from that much resignation. I see you at Paris near those whom I love, and
  who without doubt no longer love me. I hear the cold words with which they
  reply to your noble championship. I feel that you are surrounded by
  indifference, by frivolity. Dear and noble friend, when everyone else
  abandons me, I shall lean on you and know no longer how to weep. Our
  friendship is holy and pure. The world that I despise may not put its seal
  upon it, but God will bless it.</p>

  <p>Again:</p>

  <p class="letter">Pardon me for coming to cast a new inquietude into your
  festival. I suffer, I am alone, and I rest my feebleness on your courage.
  Yesterday after you had left me I remained a long time at the window gazing
  in the sky at a radiant little star that seemed to smile at me. I dream, and
  for too long, for habituated to my close, stale air, the freshness of the
  night chilled me and I was punished for my imprudence by extremely violent
  pains in the head. I could not close an eye for the rest of the night. This
  morning I was obliged to send for the doctor. When he arrived he found fever,
  an extraordinary excitement, and this excellent friend took my poor head
  between his hands and begged me with sweet and affectionate words to try and
  sleep.</p>

  <p>The fragments that Marie Cappelle wrote while in prison and that were
  afterwards published are all in the same style as her letters. Among them is
  this description of her cell, written in 1841 in the prison of
  Montpellier:</p>

  <p class="letter">Autumn has dropped the last leaf from her crown. It is
  cold, and when a little fire is lit in my room my bed coverlet is still
  insufficient to warm me. To obtain a little heat I have to remain in bed all
  day. That is very long&mdash;ten solitary, unoccupied hours. I try to live
  when everyone else reposes and sleeps. Night is the domain of the dead; then,
  when night has fallen I try to unite myself to all the spirits who circle in
  the shade and whose cries I can hear in the wind. But this is only the
  nightmare of my life, this is only the dream of my sugering. Tears stifle me,
  I would weep and I laugh. My ideas take vague and changing forms. I cannot
  collect my thoughts. Things come and go in my head without my volition. Where
  there should be light, there is shade. I hear the echo without the sound, the
  efiect without the cause. No, I am not mad, though my fear deceives me, for
  mad people do not love, and I love. Mad people do not believe, and I believe.
  My cell is square, it is full of an air of death. I have asked my jailer to
  go in a straight line from the door to the window and to count his steps; his
  feet are large, and mine in the same place could be put twice. Therefore, I
  may call the room large. The walls are of lime with a mixture of black
  material; the stone comes from the local quarries. This is my furniture: by
  the side of the door, a stove in sheet iron; the chimney goes obliquely
  across the wall with an air of a boa-constrictor; it is very ugly, but I am
  grateful for the warmth it gives. In front of this stove is a case that holds
  my books; under this a table; near to the window a commode. My bed has cotton
  curtains, grey colour; then there are two chairs and an arm-chair in coarse
  cotton. That is all. But is it not luxury for a poor woman who has passed two
  years with no other furniture than a chair? I have forgotten to describe my
  most precious possession&mdash;the holy little chapel of my souvenirs.
  Towards the middle of the bed I have a statuette of the Virgin, fastened
  against the wall, on a little stand covered with a white napkin; on each side
  are suspended the portraits, circled in black velvet&mdash;for gold is
  forbidden&mdash;of my father, my mother, my grandfather and my grandmother.
  Beyond the stove, I have placed the crucifix that was before by my bedside.
  The Divine glance must help me to bear my cross. Under the crucifix are
  placed piously two branches of cypress plucked from the cemetery of
  Villers-Hellon. The cemetery of Villers-Hellon! Oh, my friends, do not demand
  anything more of me! I have finished with tears what I commenced with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle passed eleven years in the <i>maison centrale</i> prison of
  Montpellier. Some of her friends and relations died, some became indifferent
  to her fate, time began to dim the blazing scandal of the <i>cause
  célèbre</i> of which she had been the sad heroine. Her health became more and
  more enfeebled; her religious ecstasy and her despair of mortal happiness
  increased together; she had seen, as the years wore on, one petition after
  another rejected, one device after another for her rehabilitation fail.</p>

    <p class="caption">Mme. Lafarge in Prison<br>
    From an old engraving in possession of the author.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>At first she had refused the petition for a pardon that might mean
  release&mdash;she wished her honour re-established; but after the Revolution
  of 1849 when Louis-Philippe and his Queen, in whom Marie Cappelle had placed
  such high hopes, were driven from the throne, the prisoner of Montpellier was
  induced to petition the President of the new Republic, Louis Napoleon, for
  pardon and release. Her old friend, Emile de Girardin, pressed her appeal
  with vehemence.</p>

  <p>She had, perhaps, a greater claim on the consideration of a Bonaparte than
  on that of an Orleans. Her family had given distinguished servants to the
  cause of the great Emperor, Napoleon I; moved by this consideration and by
  the strenuous exertions of Emile de Girardin and M. Collard, Prince Napoleon
  showed himself merciful; four distinguished doctors were sent to visit the
  prisoner of Montpellier; their reports declared that her sole hope of life
  lay in her instant release.</p>

  <p>She was therefore&mdash;without the question of her guilt being
  opened&mdash;sent on February 21st, 1851, to the hospital at Saint-Rémy. This
  State establishment had a sinister name, <i>L'asile des aliénés</i>, and was
  in fact a <i>maison de santé</i> or mad-house, but Marie was treated with
  great consideration by the director, M. de Chabran, and in her letter of
  gratitude to Girardin she gives this charming description of her new
  refuge:</p>

  <p class="letter">...we pass Beaucaire and arrive at Saint-Rémy, a very
  discreet and pious little town, surrounded by green, crowned with white, that
  wakes with the morning angelus and sleeps with the evening angelus. Long
  white limestone walls surround the hospital, an avenue of cypress leads to
  the doors; at the entrance is a porter, at the doors, a nun, who scrutinises
  the passports of all visitors. Free of them you can admire the old Gothic
  porch, the slender columns of the cloisters, whose capitals are crowned by
  archangels and chimeras, who kneel side by side like the young nuns beneath
  them who recite aloud the same rosary and dream silently the same dream.
  Ascend the stairs&mdash;you will reach a large black grille&mdash;it will be
  opened, you will find yourself with me.</p>

  <p>After expressing a lively gratitude, Marie Cappelle had some complaints to
  make.</p>

  <p>She was as much a prisoner as before, under <i>lock and key</i>; no one,
  not even the Abbé Coural nor her faithful doctor from Montpellier, was
  allowed to visit her without an order from the Ministry; from eight o'clock,
  "<i>lorsque les folles se couchent</i>," she was forced to retire from the
  little cabinet allowed her and locked in her bedroom.</p>

  <p>But she had her consolations:</p>

  <p class="letter">The sun of the good God that freely enters my room, the
  nightingale that comes to sing his Ténèbres and Matines to me, the pigeons
  that eat out of my hand, and Adèle, sister of my soul.</p>

  <p>Most precious of all, she boasted of three letters from Emile de
  Girardin:</p>

  <p class="letter">I press my lips to the seal Stabo, I tell myself that my
  oracle is the oracle of France, my hope her hope, my saviour the great man
  who will save this poor people!</p>

  <p>According to Marie all was not well in the saintly establishment of
  Saint-Paul at Saint-Rémy; the Mother Superior was jealous of the Abbé
  Chargros, who wished to console Marie, and the good man had to cease his
  visits; the nuns were dry, cold, autocratic; used to dealing with lunatics,
  they did as they pleased&mdash;"there is no worse despotism than that of
  virtue," noted Marie bitterly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A year later she was officially released (June 11th, 1852), and her
  letters to Girardin breathe not only joyous gratitude but "hopes, projects,
  dreams."</p>

  <p>She returned to Montpellier, to the paternal care of M. Collard, who had,
  as she declared, stinted his children to provide for her prison luxuries.</p>

  <p>In reply to Girardin's question concerning her position, she wrote: "I
  have absolutely nothing." She hoped, however, to earn some money with which
  to repay the Collards; she had some manuscripts by her, and she felt "a
  vocation" for journalism; she was eager for the employment that she hoped
  Girardin would find for her. But a subsequent letter confessed:</p>

  <p class="letter">My pen is broken, my ink upset, I am the victim of a cough,
  a fever, of the doctors' directions, I have scarcely the strength to live,
  much less to write...</p>

  <p>Gustave Collard, she said, had again offered his hand and been
  refused.</p>

  <p>In truth her state was desperate, and it was, unaccountably, decided that
  she should leave her retreat with the Collards and go with Adèle to take the
  waters at Ussat.</p>

  <p>She had herself a profound disinclination to leave her "nest" as she
  termed it with the Collards at Montpellier, and no one else offered her an
  asylum. It is perhaps odd that none of her ardent admirers and supporters
  came forward now to parade her in triumph in the capital, where her name had
  for twelve years blazed in an incredible publicity; but the wronged prisoner
  was easier to champion than the forlorn, penniless invalid who had been
  pardoned without being absolved of the guilt of two crimes. Besides, Paris
  was in the ferment of the gaudy dawn of the Second Empire and that peculiar
  type of Romanticism that had idolised Marie Cappelle was out of fashion.</p>

  <p>No one came forward to offer the released prisoner the attentions that
  would have made her liberty worth while; there were only the vague offers
  from Girardin, so soon to be himself a prisoner, and the homely kindness of
  the Collards; the rest of Marie Cappelle's relatives held aloof. After the
  long drama of her imprisonment this liberty that did not include
  rehabilitation was a dull thing to the sick, passionate woman.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. LAST DROP SCENE</h2>

  <h3><a name="ch-04-01"
     id="ch-04-01"></a>THE SECRET OF THE TOMB, 1852</h3>

  <p class="first">THE affairs of Marie Cappelle, though she had so many
  intelligent, enthusiastic people interfering in them, were always lamentably
  ill-managed. Though her doctors pronounced her to be dying of tuberculosis
  and heart disease, and though for twelve years she had been in prison, and
  therefore was quite out of touch with the world, she was sent with only the
  inexperienced Adèle, and Clementine Servat who had also been in Montpellier
  for years, to "take the waters" at Ussat, a place where she had no friends or
  acquaintances but where her fantastic story was well known&mdash;as indeed it
  was in every corner of Europe.</p>

  <p>Without any attempt to disguise her person or name, with only a dying man
  as an escort, Marie Cappelle set out on what she termed "the last stage of my
  calvary."</p>

  <p>Yet she had hopes, she still dreamed of Paris, of literary work, of fame,
  of some revival of her dead, corrupted happiness; in September she set out
  for the Pyrenees. Adèle Collard was herself ill, and Clementine Servat was no
  longer the gay <i>grisette</i>&mdash;the blonde Mimi Pinson, who had troubled
  with her impertinence the coarse provincial household of Glandier, but a
  sober, middle-aged woman, absorbed in an obsession&mdash;devotion to her
  mistress.</p>

  <p>A brutal reality was before the three romantics; their escort, Colonel
  Andoury, an old companion-in-arms of M. Cappelle, sixty-five years of age and
  in the last stages of an incurable disease, accompanied them to the principal
  <i>hôtel</i> of Ussat, in the district of Ornolac. An aureole of piety and
  self-sacrifice was about this little group of travellers, who seemed not to
  expect any pleasure or repose in this world, and only to regard the next
  through a veil of tears.</p>

  <p>Both Adèle Collard, whose health had suffered from the continual visits
  she had paid Marie Cappelle in prison (often she had remained in her company
  for days and nights together), and Clementine Servat offered examples of a
  moving and heroic fidelity. Not only had Clementine Servat on one occasion
  taken infinite trouble to arrange a plan of escape whereby she was to take
  her mistress's place in prison, a scheme that might have had some chance of
  success had not Marie Cappelle refused to take advantage of it, but, when
  during one period she had been banished from the prison, she had earned her
  living in Montpellier by domestic service and needlework in order to be as
  near as possible to her beloved mistress and to earn a little money with
  which to soften her imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle thus wrote of her faithful servant:</p>

  <p class="letter">During my long trial she was sublime in her energy and
  fidelity. After my condemnation her devotion rose even higher. I was amazed
  to see this young girl, formerly so careless and gay, weeping my tears,
  suffering my sorrows, caring for me day and night with the inexhaustible
  tenderness of a mother or a sister, condemned like myself to the rigours of
  an imprisonment that deprived us of air, of exercise, and often of all
  communication with the outside world; not only did my poor Clé never
  complain, but never allowed me to think that there was anything to complain
  of. She smiled at the bars, she smiled at the locks; the jailer's dog was her
  friend, the concierge's cat was her companion; the children loved her sugar,
  the old men her tobacco, everyone her good grace, and under her hands even
  the chains ceased to gall.</p>

  <p>Of her no less faithful friend, Adèle Collard, Marie Cappelle had written
  in these terms:</p>

  <p class="letter">Yesterday Adèle was so sad that you would have taken her
  for the prisoner and me for the young girl who was free to pluck the roses
  and drink in the sunshine in the meadows. "Listen, my dearest," I said to
  her, "listen. Near the streams in Villers-Hellon grow yellow and blue irises.
  Pick me two of those, two where the buds have not yet broken into blossom.
  Bring them to me. I shall watch them bloom in my chamber, and perhaps the
  past will also blossom a moment around me." Adèle threw her arms round my
  neck and did not answer me. "If you find that little pearly treasure, that
  little blue flower, that some people call 'forget-me-not', and others 'love
  me,' make me a bouquet. All that remains of life is symbolised in these poor
  little flowers. You understand me, do you not?" Adèle took my hand; it was
  clear that she had comprehended my thoughts. "Listen again. When you are
  seated near the stream, let your hand play with the fresh bubbling water.
  Throw into the current a willow leaf and tell me if the current has taken it
  away or if it has sunk to the bottom of the water. Before, I used to consult
  the oracle thus. Alas, it deceived me, but I still believe in it. Test it for
  yourself, darling, and&mdash;finally&mdash;breathe in all the flowers that
  open round you; take in the air, the sun, the liberty for both of us, and
  come back to me and give me my share. Come back quickly!" In reply Adèle took
  oft her hat and gloves and said, "Listen in your turn. When you are unhappy I
  shall be unhappy. As long as you are a prisoner I shall never quit you, and
  when the day of liberty comes, well, it will be a good day for both of
  us."</p>

  <p>This longed-for, this hoped-for, this planned-for day had at length
  arrived, and the three women were free and in the little watering-place where
  they hoped to find obscurity and repose.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Marie Cappelle had received a pardon, or what passed as a pardon, but not
  a rehabilitation; she remained civilly dead, and therefore, not only did she
  not possess anything, but she never could pretend to any inheritance; a
  modest purse filled from the charity of the Collards was her sole resource;
  her attire was heavy mourning, her appearance wasted in the extreme.</p>

  <p>Colonel Andoury wished to provide for the daughter of his old
  companion-in-arms; he had realised all his fortune and tried to put the
  portfolio containing this sum of money into the hands of Marie Cappelle as
  soon as they had arrived at the <i>hôtel</i>, but she refused.</p>

  <p>Her first occupation was to write a letter of thanks to the President of
  the Republic; this was her last literary effort.</p>

  <p>A few weeks afterwards the Colonel died, after declaring to Mme. Lafarge
  that it was his last wish that she should become his heiress. This Marie
  Cappelle refused to do, and as soon as Colonel Andoury was dead she returned
  to his relations the sum of money that he had left behind in his trunk, thus
  leaving herself with extremely limited means.</p>

  <p>The death of this old soldier left the three women without a protector.
  For various reasons, all of which are not now clear, none of the devoted
  friends who had for so long championed the cause of Marie Cappelle came
  forward to guard or soften the liberty which she had obtained too late for
  happiness or repose; she was allowed to endure an agony worse than that she
  had suffered at Montpellier or Saint-Rémy.</p>

  <p>After she had buried her old friend, Colonel Andoury, in the little
  cemetery at Ornolac, Marie Lafarge, who had made no friends at Ussat save the
  Abbé Bounel, whom she had taken as her confessor, went to Toulouse to find a
  dentist; she was maddened by neuralgia resulting from decayed teeth.</p>

  <p>Her means being extremely limited she took the common <i>diligence</i>,
  but found it impossible to continue in it; even in this remote part of France
  her story was known, and she was recognised at Tarascon by several women, who
  insulted her openly as "thief and murderess" and tried to tear the veil away
  she kept in front of her bonnet.</p>

  <p>From Toulouse she wrote one of her last letters to the sympathetic
  <i>Curé</i> of Ornolac; she was trying to finish an epistle to George Sand,
  whom she had endeavoured to interest in her case, but sordid details of
  every-day were overwhelming her; romanticism was no charm against the acute
  suffering caused by neglected teeth&mdash;but were not these agonies also
  part of "the royal road of the cross"?</p>

  <p class="letter">God must love me to torment me so. A dentist at Montpellier
  so damaged the nerve of one of my teeth that I could neither eat, nor speak,
  nor sleep, pain brought on fever&mdash;under these circumstances what good
  could the waters [of Ussat] do me? There is no dentist at Foix, so I have
  gone to be tortured at Toulouse, and if I am not too cruelly exhausted by
  this operation, I shall return in a couple of days and hope to pass September
  peacefully at Ornolac.</p>

  <p>The broken tooth was extracted and Mme. Lafarge returned to Ussat, where
  she presented herself, with her two companions, at the <i>Hôtel des
  Bains</i>, where she had stayed before and where Colonel Andoury had died.
  She was refused accommodation; the proprietor had not succumbed to her famous
  charm and he feared both her notoriety and her poverty.</p>

  <p>After trying all the neighbouring <i>hôtels</i>, where they received the
  same humiliating rebuffs, the three forlorn women went round all the
  furnished apartments in the little town. They were refused at all of these,
  until, when the evening fell, they received rough accommodation at the house
  of a M. Rouau, who, however, could give them nothing except a couple of
  mattresses on the floor in an underground room.</p>

  <p>From this miserable retreat the hunted woman, face to face with a cruel
  reality from which there was not even a prison wall to protect her, scribbled
  her last letter, to the Abbé Bound:</p>

  <p class="letter">Monsieur,<br>
  <br>
  Yesterday I returned, full of hope, to those dear springs where, it seemed to
  me, God had allowed me to drink renewed life. Unfortunately, almost
  unsurmountable difficulties awaited us...while Adèle was arranging about our
  rooms, the price, etc., M. Pélissier told us that he had no free room. All
  the other <i>hôtels</i> are full. We must, then, return to
  Montpellier&mdash;unless you can, Monsieur, once more serve us as Providence.
  In this hope, we await you&mdash;hoping that you will come as soon as
  possible to the <i>hôtel</i> Rouau, where we sleep on the floor, on one
  mattress...</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge was not able to await the arrival of the priest; during the
  night her basement window was assailed by curious people, who tried to peer
  in and who shouted abuse. Desperately frightened the three women called for
  help; the other lodgers in the wretched house were awakened; there was a
  scene during which the crowd outside shouted that they wished to see "the
  poisoner, the adventuress, the thief," and the lodgers complained that their
  night's rest was disturbed. Before the dawn the outcasts were turned into the
  street.</p>

  <p>A further desperate and agonising search for shelter resulted in the
  priest's finding apartments for them in a modest house known as <i>la maison
  Neuville</i> on the environs of the town.</p>

  <p>These painful experiences inflicted on the dying woman a severe nervous
  crisis, and it was an unconscious woman whom Adèle Collard and Clementine
  Servat put to bed in the poor lodging, which was now the sole refuge of the
  ex-prisoner of Montpellier.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge had come to Ornolac with a certain revival of her hopes. She
  was thirty-six years of age, she still had moments when she dreamed of a
  future that might not be by any possibility happy, but might be respected and
  peaceful. She had dreamed of a reopening of her case, of a reinstatement of
  herself in society. she had entered into negotiations with M. René, who had
  published her <i>Mémoires</i>, for book-reviewing and the writing of fiction;
  she hoped by this means to be able to support herself. But her experiences at
  Ornolac had robbed her even of this faint and dubious prospect. She had,
  since she was a child, chosen the hysteric's way of escape from
  reality&mdash;that of illness; she was now dying of emotionalism, named by
  the doctors <i>hydropéricardite</i>.</p>

  <p>It was the end of August when she found shelter in the modest lodgings
  where, owing to her state of health, she was unmolested, and on the 6th
  September the good Curé of Ornolac, visiting his sick in the environs of the
  little town, was met by Mlle. Adèle Collard, who asked him to come at once to
  her cousin, who was, she believed, a dying woman.</p>

  <p>The sequel may be told in the priest's own words:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Make haste," said Mlle. Collard, "my cousin waits for you.
  She is very ill."<br>
  <br>
  I found, indeed, when I reached her lodgings, that Mme. Lafarge was stifling,
  that she was demanding water, that she had asked everyone to open the
  windows, that she was struggling in an inexpressible agony. I tried to
  console her, to reassure her, but did not doubt that she was lost. The next
  day she was due to confess and to attend the fête of the Nativity. Between
  two nervous convulsions Mme. Lafarge found the strength to tell me that she
  feared she would not be able to attend Church the next day. I profited by
  this to ask her if she would like to confess then. She consented. The crises
  of her illness followed in swift succession and it was impossible to do
  anything. I went back to my presbytery after telling Mlle. Collard to send
  for me if the sick woman became worse. I had not been in bed an hour when I
  heard someone twice knock at the door. I took the holy Viaticum from the
  Church and carried it with me without any ceremony. Towards midnight I
  arrived at the maison Neuville. The sick woman was seated across the bed, her
  back resting on cushions; her struggles for breath had taken on an
  extraordinary violence; she had already the face of a corpse. I told her, not
  to alarm her, that thinking she might not be able to come to the Church on
  the following day, "I have brought the Viaticum." She appeared very pleased
  with the attention, as she put it, that the good God had for her. At this
  moment the room was full of people. Before administering the Sacrament I
  asked of the sick woman, as the ritual demands, "Do you pardon your enemies?"
  She raised her head and replied in a firm voice, "I wish that God may do them
  as much good as they have done me evil." Then, when I prayed God for her
  cure, she said, speaking in a voice full of sweetness, "Do not ask God for
  the prolongation of my days. Pray Him, on the contrary, that He will allow me
  to unite myself to Him."</p>

  <p>Early in the morning of the next day, September 7th, after several hours
  of agony, watched by curious eyes, Marie Cappelle died. The priest thus
  continued his account:</p>

  <p class="letter">She was about to enter on her thirty-seventh year. She had
  passed twelve of those years in prison. A strange incident marked the day of
  the funeral. Some officials of the Department happened to be passing Ussat.
  The Prefect wished to see the poor, dead woman. When he entered into her room
  she was already arranged in her bier, but still uncovered. Kneeling near her
  was her cousin, who still held her hand.<br>
  <br>
  "See," said Mlle. Collard, "how beautiful she still is. Her hand is warm as
  if she was still living."<br>
  <br>
  This observation impressed the assistants; a doctor examined the corpse,
  found it still warm, and ordered that the funeral should be postponed. But an
  hour had scarcely gone by when the body, suddenly becoming decomposed, turned
  completely blue. The funeral was then hastened.<br>
  <br>
  I conducted my poor friend to the little cemetery. Mlle. Collard followed the
  convoy on foot. She was not able to stifle her sobs and tears. As for me, I
  mingled my tears with my prayers.</p>

  <p>This simple country priest firmly believed in the innocence of the strange
  woman whom he had seen dying from "the anguish of life." Some years after her
  death he was questioned on the subject by curious visitors to Ornolac, who
  had made a pilgrimage to the lonely cross in the desolate little cemetery
  beneath which Marie Cappelle rested. It was, of course, impossible to probe
  the good <i>Curé</i> with regard to anything that might have been said to him
  under the seal of confession; but the visitors did venture to ask:</p>

  <p>"Then, M. le Curé, you do not doubt the innocence of Madame Lafarge? You
  believe that she neither poisoned her husband nor stole the diamonds?"</p>

  <p>The priest replied:</p>

  <p>"If she was guilty&mdash;with the sentiments that she expressed, with that
  sincerity of soul and that angelic beauty which distinguished her&mdash;one
  must suppose that Madame Lafarge had a degree of perversity that scarcely
  exists in human nature. If she were guilty it must have been the devil
  himself whom I blessed and consoled. All I can say to you, Messieurs, is that
  I wish that all my penitents had as holy a death as hers."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On September 7th, the Abbé Bounel wrote to the confessor of the Collard
  family at Montpellier advising them of the death of Marie Lafarge and of the
  approaching return of Mlle. Adèle&mdash;"...the excellent, the interesting
  young lady from whom the <i>bon Dieu</i> had exacted the most cruel of
  sacrifices!"</p>

  <p>The priest filled this letter with praises of the dead woman: "...never,
  during the eighteen years of my priesthood, have I been so profoundly edified
  as by this holy death-bed."</p>

  <p>On the 12th of the same month M. Bounel wrote to the Bishop of Pamiers; in
  this he stated that Marie Lafarge, under the seal of confession, had declared
  herself innocent of all the crimes of which she was accused, and that he
  would like to publish this fact in the interest of Marie Cappelle's
  family.</p>

  <p>His Eminence replied guardedly that the secret of the confession must not
  be revealed even to the family of the penitent, and that the enthusiastic
  Abbé, "using his good sense," must not go further than informing the friends
  of Marie Cappelle that she had died with the consolations of the
  Church&mdash;there must not be, on the Abbé's part, "any attestation, any
  writing." However, both the letters were afterwards published.</p>

  <p>The Abbé Bounel's conviction of his penitent's innocence had not much
  value, since it was not founded on any study of her story or her character,
  but merely on the emotional appeal the extraordinary personality of the dying
  woman had made on his simple, generous nature.</p>

  <p>Adèle Collard wrote to Emile de Girardin, announcing the death of her poor
  cousin in high-flown terms:</p>

  <p class="letter">She had such a serenity in her features that it was doubted
  whether she was dead; she was taken from her coffin and I massaged her
  myself; two doctors came, the funeral was delayed four hours...Her last
  moments were sublime; in the terrible crisis that preceded her short agony,
  she crossed her hands, and, casting her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed: "Oh, my
  friends, where are you? O, mon Dieu, how I suffer! You know, however, that I
  have done nothing!"</p>

  <p>In the lonely little cemetery, shaded by pines, in view of the mountains,
  the remains of Marie Cappelle rest near to those of Colonel Andoury, her
  father's companion-in-arms, and far from the graves of all the others whom
  she had loved. A modest cross of rough stone was raised over what, in the
  language of the day, was termed a "terrible enigma" or "the secret of the
  tomb." There the peasants, whose brutal curiosity and rough insults had
  embittered the dead woman's last days, came, by a crude revulsion of feeling,
  to say their prayers, lay their wreaths and shed their ready tears as if she,
  whom during her life they had reviled as a murderess, had after her death
  become a saint.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Nearly a year after the death of Marie Cappelle the Abbé Bounel wrote to
  M. Maurice Collard, her great-uncle, at Montpellier, who had undertaken to
  pay for the last earthly needs of his niece. Once again reality impinged on
  romance; M. Blagg insisted on 120 francs for the <i>grille</i> of the tomb,
  and then had refused to paint it&mdash;"with great lack of delicacy."</p>

  <p>As for the cross, the priest had bargained with a workman of Pamiers to
  make this for twelve francs and to deliver it by the middle of July (1853).
  Six weeks went by, however, without the fulfilment of this promise; finally,
  the cross arrived, nicely finished; it was set in place, and made, in the
  priest's opinion, "a fine, original effect."</p>

  <p>There were other troubles; he had planted a weeping willow tree above the
  grave; at first it had flourished, then the sight-seers who wore smooth the
  hitherto grassy graveyard path had stripped it bare and it had died.</p>

  <p>The menaces and prayers of the priest were alike ceaseless&mdash;not only
  the unfortunate willow, but all the flowers placed on the grave were snatched
  away by the crowd, who "encumbered the cemetery"; everyone wanted a souvenir
  of Marie Cappelle.</p>

  <p>However, as the Abbé consoled himself and M. Collard, all this
  "veneration" was very flattering and the damage was easily repaired: "I shall
  plant another willow and some more flowers&mdash;and in time they will be
  left in peace."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. EPILOGUE. WHAT WAS THE TRUTH?</h2>

  <p class="fist">THOSE who retold the story of Marie Cappelle soon after her
  death declared that she had passed from the judgment of men to that of God,
  and no more fitting phrase with which to sum up her story can be found.</p>

  <p>It is now impossible to hope that the mystery of Glandier and that of the
  diamonds will ever be cleared up. The trial and investigation were conducted
  in such a careless, violent and partial spirit, so much irrelevant matter was
  allowed to obscure the main issues, so much hearsay, rumour and gossip was
  admitted as evidence, that it is, even after a most careful reading of all
  the available material, impossible to come to a conclusion as to the truth of
  the matter.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that Marie Cappelle would not have been condemned, even in
  those days, by an English judge and jury. She may have been guilty, but the
  evidence against her was weak, vague and confused. It was not even absolutely
  proved that Charles Lafarge died of poison; it was certainly not proved that
  his wife administered to him the poison.</p>

  <p>In that disordered, chaotic household, where everything was dirty,
  neglected and managed by ignorant people, in that atmosphere of prejudice,
  excitement and base passions where everyone had lost his head, anything was
  possible in the way of crime or accident; any one of those people who ran in
  and out of the chamber of M. Lafarge during the fifteen days of his illness
  might have put the poison where it was afterwards found, in the bowl that had
  contained chicken-broth on the night-table, in the little pot, and in the
  agate box that Marie Cappelle had in the pocket of her apron; anyone might
  have substituted the bicarbonate of soda for the arsenic that stood for
  several days in the old hat in the room of the sick man; on the other hand it
  is quite possible that the story that credited Denis with boasting that he
  had made the exchange before he gave the white powder to Mme. Lafarge was
  true. These matters were never investigated.</p>

  <p>As far as circumstantial evidence went, this pointed to the culprit's
  being the man Denis Barbier, who so unfortunately and so inexplicably was
  never brought to book. Ann Lebrun, such an important witness for the
  prosecution, was hysterical and spiteful. All the members of the family
  Lafarge were strongly prejudiced against Marie Cappelle, who had deeply
  outraged them by her behaviour since she had come to Glandier.</p>

  <p>The famous letter on sky-blue paper of August 15th, on which the
  accusation against Marie Cappelle was largely based, may well have been the
  fantasy of a romantic and frightened young girl. The only point in it against
  the writer is that she does mention <i>arsenic</i> by name. She may have lied
  when she said it was in her possession, but it was certainly in her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>It was clearly stressed by the defence that she had no object in this
  murder. Mercenary motives she could not have had, since her husband was
  ruined and she was possessed of a comfortable fortune that she entirely
  devoted to his needs.</p>

  <p>Not the utmost efforts of the prosecution could discover that she had a
  lover, nor any man whom she desired to marry. That part at least of the
  famous letter of August 15th was fiction. The only possible motives she could
  have had would have been disgust, terror, a desire to be free at all costs
  from a husband whom she detested and a life that she found unsupportable.</p>

  <p>One of the astonishing facts in this extraordinary affair is the shocking
  invective that M. Decous was allowed to employ against a woman accused, but
  not condemned. It is also difficult to account for the vindictive attitude
  taken up by the Government against Marie Cappelle; this would hardly seem to
  be accounted for by the fact of her illegitimate connection with the House of
  Orleans and the subsequent fear of favouritism on the part of the King. But
  then again, why was the jury, even though it was composed of illiterate
  peasants of the Limousin, so implacable towards the prisoner, in whose
  condition there was so much that was touching and whose person was so
  attractive? Marie Cappelle appeared to be able to charm everyone save her
  judge and her jury.</p>

  <p>The affair of the diamonds remains as exasperatingly obscure as the
  tragedy of Glandier. In this case there was only one fact, that the broken
  <i>parure</i> was found in Marie Cappelle's room at Glandier.</p>

  <p>Her account of how she obtained it is certainly fantastic, but it is also
  fantastic to suppose that she stole these valuable jewels from her friend and
  kept them for so long concealed without making use of them save to have three
  pearls set into an ornament. She never lacked luxuries of any kind; she could
  have been under no temptation to steal the diamonds that she must have known
  she would never be able to wear or sell, and that would, as long as they
  remained in her possession, subject her to a grave peril.</p>

  <p>Her story that her husband knew she had these jewels in her possession it
  was impossible to corroborate, nor, given the bad character of M. Lafarge,
  would it have helped her much if she had been able to do so. It was
  extraordinary that the famous Spaniard, M. Felix Clavé, never came forward
  despite Marie Cappelle's indignant appeal published in the Paris
  newspaper:</p>

  <p class="letter">M. Felix Clavé, you are a coward. I have cried to you from
  the depth of my prison, I have demanded from everybody, from the world, from
  the Press, from your own remorse, to carry my voice to the interior of the
  desert where you hide yourself. Why do you delay to avenge your honour and
  that of her whom you ruin? You have crossed the seas to remake your fortune.
  Could not you cross them to remake your reputation? There only is needed a
  word, one only, and you have not come.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle concluded this passionate appeal by declaring that she
  would sell her mother's wedding ring to supply the funds to bring M. Felix
  Clavé to Paris. Such extreme measures were not necessary; M. de Léautaud
  himself offered to pay the expenses of any witness whom Marie Cappelle might
  wish to call. This offer was refused by her lawyers, since they did not think
  they could trust the witnesses procured through the expense of the
  prosecution.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to see, however, of what particular use M. Clairé would
  have been to Marie Cappelle's cause. What was the one word that would have
  cleared her? He was scarcely likely to have admitted that he had blackmailed
  or intended to blackmail Mme. de Léautaud, and even if he had gone so far as
  to admit a long intimacy&mdash;perhaps a dishonourable love affair between
  himself and Marie de Nicolai&mdash;that still would not have proved that the
  diamonds had been given to Marie Cappelle to buy his silence.</p>

  <p>It is not at all clear why this M. Felix Clavé did not come forward; it is
  impossible to believe that he had not, even in Mexico or Algiers, heard of
  this sensational case that was debated so ardently all over Europe. None of
  the minute chronicles of the case of Marie Cappelle had any account of the
  further life or actions of this young man. Like Denis Barbier, he disappears
  completely from the scene; two letters "to the honour of Madame de Léautaud"
  that he was supposed to have sent from Mexico were not accepted by Marie
  Cappelle's lawyers.</p>

  <p>There is a possibility that the family Léautaud, so powerful with their
  wealth and connections, bribed the young Spaniard not to appear, but this
  supposition does not seem very reasonable. If M. Clavé was a man who could be
  bought, and there is nothing to make us suppose that he was, M. de Léautaud
  would surely have suborned him to come forward and declare that he had never
  had any connection with Mme. de Léautaud save in the nebulous, schoolgirl
  flirtation that had only involved her in one or two foolish notes and one
  meeting at the Charity Ball. If the young Spaniard had gone into the box to
  swear this, he would have done much to convince the public that Marie
  Cappelle's story was fiction. As he did not do it, Marie, in the minds of
  many people, received the benefit of the doubt, and the family Léautaud's
  long, vindictive and grim fight for what they termed their honour had the
  result that perhaps a majority of the public believed that Marie de Léautaud
  was a cowardly, perjured woman who had sworn to a tissue of lies in order to
  save her own good name and who had sacrificed in the most odious manner a
  woman who had proved a staunch friend to her. Indeed, Mme. de Léautaud lost
  as much reputation as Marie Cappelle over the extraordinary affair of the
  diamonds.</p>

  <p>It is precisely this double accusation that so complicates the case of
  Marie Cappelle. If she had been accused only of the poisoning or only of the
  theft, it might have been easy to believe she was calumniated; but the fact
  that she was accused, before she was twenty-four years of age, of two crimes,
  makes it difficult to credit such an extraordinary series of misfortune.</p>

  <p>As to the accusations of petty theft put in by the family Léautaud and
  largely supported by Mme. de Montbreton, who had been one of Marie Cappelle's
  most intimate friends, they were neither proved nor disproved. Marie
  Cappelle's lawyers strove to show that she had not been in residence at the
  houses of her friends when these stolen articles were missed. It is not to be
  denied, however, that she had been in residence with her aunt, Mme. Garat,
  when the leathern discs were substituted for gold pieces in that lady's desk,
  when the turquoise buttons had been missed, when, in brief, there had been a
  whole series of petty pilfering. It was never proved that Marie Cappelle was
  the thief; but unless Mme. de Montbreton and all the friends of Marie de
  Nicolai were combined in a conspiracy to defame the unfortunate prisoner,
  there does seem to have been a strong suspicion among Marie Cappelle's
  friends that she was apt slyly to pocket articles of value from a banknote to
  a few chiffons or buttons. However, this was not proved one way or
  another.</p>

  <p>What was proved, beyond glossing over all denials, was the character of
  the prisoner. Is there here a solution to this extraordinary mystery, or
  rather series of mysteries?</p>

  <p>When M. de Léautaud preferred his charge of theft against Marie Cappelle,
  he remarked, and repeated more than once, that he had always suspected her of
  the theft of his wife's diamonds "because of her romantic and extravagant
  character." Does this statement contain the clue to the whole labyrinth of
  obscure happenings that finally brought Marie Cappelle to the prison at
  Montpellier and the tomb at Ornolac?</p>

  <p>M. de Léautaud was, as painted by Marie Cappelle in her <i>Mémoires</i>, a
  dour, commonplace young man, and he made a bad impression on the public by
  bringing a charge of theft against a woman already accused of murder. It was
  said that he had waited on Mme. Garat and offered to drop his charge if the
  price of the diamonds was refunded, but that this offer had been refused, as
  an acceptance would mean that Marie Cappelle's guilt was acknowledged. He
  certainly played an unpleasant, possibly an ignoble part in prosecuting a
  woman so unfortunate for the sake of the 20,000 francs at which the famous
  <i>parure</i> was valued.</p>

  <p>This conduct was also more especially odious if he believed, as he said,
  that Marie Cappelle had committed the theft because she was "romantic and
  extravagant"; in other words, because she was hardly responsible for her
  action. Once the prisoner had told her story, which the Léautaud family
  regarded as such a scandalous outrage, there was perhaps some excuse for M.
  de Léautaud's vindictiveness; he must have spent, on the affair of the
  diamonds, far more than these unfortunate jewels were worth, and his lawyers,
  M. Corali and the famous M. Odilon Barrot, attacked Marie, probably on M. de
  Léautaud's instructions, without a touch of pity or regret.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle did not fail to note with scorn the lack of chivalry that
  characterised this French nobleman in persecuting so bitterly for the sake of
  a small sum of money a woman already so desperately unhappy.</p>

  <p>But, however mediocre M. de Léautaud's character, however reprehensible
  his behaviour in this wretched affair of the diamonds, he may have had the
  shrewdness to put his finger on the solution to the mystery&mdash;"the
  romantic and extravagant character" of Marie Cappelle. Nor has she herself
  denied that she was romantic and extravagant; indeed, she rather gloried in
  this description. Her friends also admitted that she was of an extreme,
  nervous sensibility, but no one, friend or enemy, save M. de Léautaud, seemed
  to make this connection between the "extravagant, romantic character" and the
  alleged criminal actions.</p>

  <p>Was Marie Cappelle a pathological liar, a fantasy-dweller, one of those
  criminals who are able to convince others of their innocence because they
  believe in it themselves? One remembers Clarisse Manson and Marie de
  Morell.*</p>

  <p>[* See Foreword.]</p>

  <p>Madame Lafarge was certainly able to persuade, and for years, many
  intelligent, sensible, learned and careful people that she was not only a
  wronged woman but a saint and a martyr. Many prisoners would have been able
  to do the same if they could have put out of the way the proof of their
  crime. As there was no proof against Marie Cappelle she was readily believed;
  for all that it is just possible that the unlettered peasants who composed
  the Limousin jury and the dry lawyer who presided over them were right in
  deciding that "the Angel of Arsenic" was guilty, both of theft and murder. By
  her own confession she was able to identify herself with heroines of romance
  and passed most of her time in day-dreaming in an almost trance-like
  condition, projecting her personality into that of some imaginary being.
  Nothing could be more high-flown and romantic than some of the passages in
  her <i>Mémoires</i>; the elaborate, passionate and idealistic love affair
  with the mysterious M. C&mdash;&mdash; is probably entirely an invention. She
  was continually reading, as we have seen, luscious romances, the voluptuous
  immoralities of George Sand, the impossible adventures of Walter Scott. When
  she received the love-letter from the apothecary's son she replied at once in
  the most ardent and fervent terms, no doubt imagining herself as the heroine
  of one of the fictions that she so continually read. She admits herself that
  having just read of a deaf-and-dumb hero she persuaded herself that the man
  who followed her in the Tuileries was similarly afflicted.</p>

  <p>We see the same disposition at Glandier when she let down her hair and,
  seated in front of a mirror, wrote passionate love-letters to the husband to
  whom she was indifferent, if not hostile.</p>

  <p>The letter of August 15th does not appear to be that of a woman with
  criminal intentions, but it is certainly either the most consummate hypocrisy
  or written by one unbalanced in her mind. Even when Marie Cappelle's thoughts
  were of flight, suicide, the glamorous beauties of the East and of poison,
  she declared that she had arsenic in her possession.</p>

  <p>It was not long after that that she did really procure arsenic, and on her
  own initiative before there seemed to have been any complaints about the
  rats. It is possible that she was neither a deeply-wronged woman nor a
  hardened criminal, a Brinvilliers or a Messalina, as the prosecution termed
  her, but merely a woman so wrapped in fantasy, romance and day-dreaming, so
  highly-strung, nervous and excitable as to be almost a dual personality? The
  state of her health must be remembered; she was tubercular, she suffered from
  violent neuralgic headaches, she developed heart disease, she was tormented
  by gastric trouble, she dosed herself, even before her Montpellier days, with
  laudanum, and she was subject to what she termed "nervous crises," long
  swoons or trances, sometimes accompanied by convulsions that had perhaps an
  epileptic character.</p>

  <p>She had had one of these attacks, so violent that her life was despaired
  of, shortly before the fatal box of cakes was sent to her husband in Paris.
  The defence pointed out triumphantly that it would have been impossible for
  her to substitute the large one for the small cakes without being noticed,
  since the only oven was in the kitchen and all her movements were spied upon.
  It is, however, just possible that she might have been able to have access to
  this kitchen without the knowledge of the rest of the household, since one of
  her Parisian servants, Mion, was then the cook. It must be remembered that
  the elder Mme. Lafarge accused this Parisian cook of putting the poison in
  the cake; it might have been possible for Marie Lafarge to have slipped down
  into the kitchen and obtained the large cake without her own servants' taking
  much heed of her movements; she might also have been able to break the parcel
  open and substitute this cake after Ann Lebrun and Mme. Lafarge had seen the
  small cakes packed.</p>

  <p>In the same way it was quite possible, since she had arsenic in her
  possession, for her to have strewn some on the truffles that her husband ate
  after his arrival at Glandier and that provoked such a terrible access of his
  illness.</p>

  <p>Considering the state of her health, the nervous suffering she must have
  been undergoing at Glandier, was it not possible that, hardly knowing what
  she was doing, she did put some poison in her husband's food or drink? Not
  the enormous quantities that she was accused of putting&mdash;all the
  evidence seems to go against that, and the people among whom she was placed
  were unreliable witnesses, vindictively disposed towards her and almost sure
  to exaggerate&mdash;but a modicum of poison sufficient to kill her
  husband.</p>

  <p>That she possessed considerable powers of intrigue she admitted herself.
  If her own story of how the diamonds came into her possession was true, she
  was quite capable of acting a part and sustaining it under difficult
  circumstances. She says in her <i>Mémoires</i> that she engineered the
  disappearance of the diamonds and also the episode that brought their loss to
  light; she also admits that she stood by and saw the servants suspected of
  the theft; one man in particular was deeply distressed. Marie Cappelle states
  that she also felt wretched on his account, but she contented herself with
  telling him that she would find him a place if he lost that he already held.
  She was not sufficiently moved by the anguish of this innocent man to expose
  the whole trick.</p>

  <p>By her own confession too she was able to contrive both the intrigue with
  the apothecary's son and that with M. Clavé, and showed herself quite clever
  at engaging the attention of the chaperon, at sending and receiving letters
  secretly. Moreover, when she was angry with Mlle. Delvaux, she played yet
  another trick on her by pretending that she did not know where to find the
  letters, keeping her in suspense until the compromising documents were in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>All these episodes are from Marie Cappelle's own <i>Mémoires</i>. If true,
  they show her to be an accomplished <i>intrigante</i>; if they are not true,
  they show that she could at least imagine such intrigues and that she was not
  ashamed to confess to them.</p>

  <p>When the diamonds were discovered, she lied again when she declared that
  they had been sent to her by a relation from Toulouse and that she had
  already told this story to the family Lafarge. Of course, she argued that
  these falsehoods would save the honour of Mme. de Léautaud, but that does not
  alter the fact that she was ready to utter them without any confusion or
  hesitation. She was then, on her own showing, capable of inventing the whole
  story of how she came to obtain these unfortunate jewels. In the same way she
  may have been quite capable of poisoning her husband, scarcely knowing that
  she did so.</p>

  <p>The enemies by whom she was surrounded, in particular the contemptible M.
  Denis Barbier, may have seen what she was about and, realising that her crime
  would fit in with their scheme, have added on their own account quantities of
  arsenic to the drink, the famous chicken broth, and strewn it on the
  <i>commode</i> in order to put her guilt beyond question.</p>

  <p>If this were the case, Marie Cappelle, when she swore that she did not
  know how the arsenic had got into the chicken broth, or on to the
  <i>commode</i>, or into the little box found in her apron, would have been
  telling the truth, and it may well have been Denis Barbier who substituted,
  as he afterwards was supposed to have boasted, the bicarbonate of soda for
  the arsenic in order to inculpate Marie Cappelle. She had already in her
  possession sufficient arsenic to have poisoned her husband, and it must be
  remembered that it was a very small quantity that Orfila found in the
  body.</p>

  <p>In this case, given her pathological state, Marie Cappelle might easily
  have persuaded herself of her entire innocence; if that were so, she told
  everyone the truth when she said that she had nothing to do with the large
  quantities of arsenic that the family Lafarge accused her of giving to her
  husband, and in the excitement of the whole business she would gradually come
  to be convinced of her entire innocence and quite forget the small grains of
  poison that she had, in a state of exaltation, given to Charles Lafarge.</p>

  <p>Her admirable behaviour in prison is no proof that she was not either a
  thief or a murderess. Too many criminals have become exemplary penitents for
  Marie Cappelle's piety and resignation to prove anything. Indeed, the very
  religious exaltation that so impressed the nuns and the priests was perhaps
  but another proof of her plastic, hysterical nature. The most famous poisoner
  in criminal annals, Mme. de Brinvilliers, achieved the reputation of a saint
  in the few weeks that elapsed between her condemnation to death and the
  carrying out of the sentence. Marie Cappelle herself avowed, and on several
  occasions and with much passion, her intense desire of being loved and
  admired, caressed and flattered. This desire in itself often leads to
  profound hypocrisy; a nature that must have this continuous flow of love, of
  admiration, works for it by every art, striving to please different types in
  different ways.</p>

  <p>The letters that Marie Cappelle wrote to the Abbé Brunet, that so
  impressed that good priest as the outpourings of a penitent soul, are
  concerned not so much with God as with His minister. Under cover of pious
  reflection Marie Cappelle, in the whole of this correspondence, is attracting
  attention to herself and soliciting the priest's interest.</p>

  <p>The same tone runs through her correspondence with Charles Lachaud and the
  other notable men who were so warmly her champions. She is all the time
  dramatising, romanticising herself, posing as the martyr, the victim, the
  poor prisoner, the poor Marie, the exhausted, dying woman who only solicits a
  little love, a little pity, a little remembrance from those who believe in
  her innocence.</p>

  <p>Against her in the diamond affair is the unlikelihood of Madame de
  Léautaud's allowing her to keep the <i>parure</i> and even to take it to
  Glandier. Of what use was it there, either to bribe M. Clavé or for any other
  purpose? If Madame de Léautaud feared blackmail, why did she not implore her
  <i>confidente</i> to raise money somehow on the diamonds? Moreover, it is
  unlikely that if M. Lafarge had known of these jewels, he would not at once
  have sold them.</p>

  <p>In her numerous letters, writings, scribblings, these accounts of tortures
  of pain, to be assuaged only by laudanum, morphia or opium, these cries and
  lamentations, these protestations of complete innocence are by no means
  incompatible with the type of woman who might have been, not a cold-blooded
  murderess, not a mercenary thief, but a creature capable of committing both
  these crimes in moods of romantic exaltation.</p>

  <p>If she did take the <i>parure</i> of Marie de Nicolai, it was not because
  she needed it either as an ornament or as a means of raising money, but
  because she enjoyed the romance and drama of the situation, because she
  wished to cause an upset, an excitement in this placid household, that she
  found, no doubt, dull and boring, because she wanted to see the commonplace
  young husband whom she despised moved to vexation, because she wanted to see
  Marie de Nicolai weeping and Mlle. Delvaux confused and agitated, because,
  with her histrionic instinct, she longed to throw this dramatic episode into
  the smug, pompous and monotonous festival of the wedding.</p>

  <p>She was not at that time married or betrothed, and there is no doubt that
  love and marriage ran much in her mind. She may have been,
  half-unconsciously, agitated, first by seeing her friend married, with a
  husband, a child, a <i>château</i>, an establishment, then by seeing the
  preparations for the marriage of another young girl who was the heroine of
  these rejoicings in which she, Marie Cappelle, was nothing; the fact that
  nearly all those who met her thought her to the last degree modest, does not
  prove that Marie Cappelle was without vanity. She may have possessed, it
  seems probable she did possess, that enormous vanity which knows how to
  disguise itself most subtly by a shrinking timidity, a delicate reserve.</p>

  <p>Marie Cappelle knew how to appeal to the sensitive, the high-minded, the
  intelligent, the generous; these, by the score, by the hundred, became her
  friends, her champions, and she rewarded them with a touching gratitude;
  nothing she said or did ever offended her supporters&mdash;this may have been
  as much art as sincerity; she was always playing for esteem, for admiration,
  for love, and she knew how to control any passion, any behaviour that might
  have cost her esteem, admiration or love.</p>

  <p>There is another extraordinary episode in her case that proves her to have
  been either a fantasy-dweller or an accomplished hypocrite. In her
  <i>Mémoires</i> she took enormous, and, it seems, unnecessary pains, to
  impress on the reader the fact that her relations with her husband were
  always platonic; she lived with him as his sister, she declares, and though
  she had promised him that she would be his wife in more than name if he
  continued to please her, he died while their relations were still those of
  brother and sister.</p>

  <p>At the same time she declares, in these same <i>Mémoires</i>, that her
  mother-in-law persuaded her that she was going to have a child. In her
  letters to her sister and her aunt she refers continually to her hope of
  maternity. She declares that her dreams were filled with this child and with
  the preparations she was making for it; it was to be named Jacqueline, after
  her beloved grandfather, and many charming and delicate lines were penned by
  Mme. Lafarge in honour of this expected daughter.</p>

  <p>After her husband's death she told the lawyers (still according to her own
  account) who were enquiring about the will, that there was no occasion for
  them to concern themselves, since she was about to have a child who would, of
  course, be the universal heir or heiress to the Glandier property. She was
  then informed, brutally enough, that the family Lafarge knew that this was
  all mythical and that she would never have a child, at least by Charles
  Lafarge.</p>

  <p>The letters of M. Lafarge to his wife, written when he was in Paris, do
  not altogether bear out the story of their platonic relationship; they are
  not, however, decisive on this point.</p>

  <p>The matter was evidently considered too delicate to be gone into at the
  trial, and this false and foolish reserve prevented a very important point
  from being threshed out. If Marie Lafarge was living a normal life with her
  husband, why did she take such pains to assert that she was not doing so? If,
  on the other hand, their relations were really those of brother and sister,
  how was it possible for Marie Lafarge to allow her mother-in-law to persuade
  her that she was about to have a child? The answers to these questions would
  have thrown a good deal of light on the character of the prisoner. Only once
  were they touched upon, and then she was evasive; she stammered, blushed,
  cast down her eyes, talked of its being her duty to make her husband happy
  and so on. The matter was then dropped.</p>

  <p>Marie Lafarge declared that her terror and sufferings on the journey from
  Paris to Glandier and during the first days in her husband's home were
  largely due to her entire ignorance of what married life really meant. This
  is possible.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Marie Cappelle seemed quite familiar with the subject of
  maternity and discussed her friends and their babies, both to come and in
  existence, with the utmost candour. She had been present at two of her
  mother's confinements; she often declared herself passionately desirous of
  having children, and it was one of her constant lamentations while in prison
  that she was shut off from all hope of maternity. This mixture of false
  delicacy, affected reserve and ordinary human emotion, should have been
  probed. Either Marie Cappelle had good reason to believe that she might
  expect a child, and it was a needless and indeed inexplicable hypocrisy for
  her to pretend that she had lived the life of a nun at Glandier, or she was
  so ignorant, romantic and flighty, as to be able to believe without the least
  difficulty in the possibility of an imaginary conception. This matter should
  have been cleared up. Either supposition shows Marie Cappelle to have been an
  irresponsible, dangerous woman.</p>

  <p>In 1841 Marie Cappelle wrote to a certain "M. A.," who had sent her some
  novels, the following letter:</p>

  <p class="letter">Let me thank you, sir, for the friends whom you have sent
  to shorten the hours that I pass behind my bolts. I owe you the sweet and
  tender emotions that I have experienced in reading them. I have wept with
  Geneviève, I have held out my hands towards Adolphe, I have passed many days,
  many nights with this great and beautiful Lélia whom society has banned,
  Lélia whom women will not recognise, will not understand in their virtuous
  simplicity! Poor Lélia who was reproached for her first love, on whom a
  second love was forced, poor woman who suftered all sorrows, all doubts, all
  possible discouragements, who was nailed to the earth by sad passion, raised
  towards Heaven by sublime instinct, who possessed equally the power of good
  and the power of evil, who would not be a feeble woman and who could not
  become an angel! I have been indiscreet, I have kept my friends, the books,
  too long. Forgive me, monsieur, and if you have kept any belief in me,
  remember me always.</p>

  <p>When Marie Cappelle wrote this letter, was she, perhaps unconsciously,
  describing herself?</p>

  <p>We will conclude by allowing this extraordinary and mysterious woman to
  speak for herself. The following remarkable letter, already referred to in
  the text, was written by Marie Cappelle to M. Cavel, Inspector of the Central
  Prison (<i>Maison Centrale</i>) in the year 1846, preserved by him, and
  afterwards in 1913 published in <i>La Nouvelle Revue</i>. The prisoner's
  relations with the Inspector of Prisons, whom she can scarcely have seen many
  times, are obscure; they seemed to have at least exchanged letters, unless
  the whole affair was a fantasy invented by Marie Cappelle. It must be left to
  the reader to judge if this letter is written by a sincere, wronged,
  noble-hearted woman, or by a sly criminal hypocrite, or by a woman, who
  though hysterical, emotional and romantic, is scarcely responsible for her
  words or actions.</p>

  <p class="letter">To M. Cavel, Inspector of the Central Prison, 1846.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you, monsieur, thank you. Your letter, it is yourself. It is your dear
  brutality, your loyal frankness, your wit, your intelligence. Your letter, it
  is the shadow of yourself, and that is why it has made me dream, weep, smile,
  why I can find the courage to reply to it in the only manner worthy of you
  and of myself. If I was a happy woman I should use my prerogative as a
  daughter of Eve and I should let you understand from day to day my heart,
  slowly, capriciously, my secret. Here I cannot, I must not. Listen to me, and
  with your honour protect my conscience. I love you, but with all my will,
  with all my conscience, with all my strength, with all my courage I have
  decided not to love you. I do not ask of you to respect this avowal. I do not
  ask it because in reading this you feel how I suffer. God has never given to
  our hearts the baptism of His holy love. Had things been otherwise we might
  have been happy, but in this society, as things are, I should know that there
  would weigh on you half of the unjust malediction that obscures me. Do not
  come back to Montpellier. Forget me. That will be easy for you; for
  you&mdash;for me&mdash;your friendship has been of the utmost joy. I am the
  star that brightens in the night during the absence of the sun, that is
  extinguished at its return. According to the spirit of our civilised code,
  this that I write to you is a fault; it is a painful duty that I have
  accomplished. You are stronger than I am. For the first time in my life I
  feel the charm of an indefinable attraction, that I only submit to while I
  revolt. I wish to talk of your memory, with God, without blushing. I wish
  without blushing to merit the esteem of my friends. Above all I will not
  expose myself to the rays of the sun. They say that they are powerful enough
  to render one mad. That I understand. Do not be irritated. I suffer. Let us
  suffer together. To do so is almost a happiness. Above all understand the
  sentiment that inspires this letter. As a young girl I dreamed many adorable
  dreams. I was deceived later, in the first serious affection of my life,
  before this affection had become a passion, I was recalled by my aunts to the
  commonsense of life, and seeing around me that the marriages of my sister, my
  cousins, my friends to the first men who came along satisfied their
  relations, I thought that so it would happen to me, and so I gave myself in
  marriage. But though in the face of the world I acquiesced, in my heart I
  revolted. I abandoned my dowry, my will, my life to one who had married me
  merely to help his business with my fortune, furnish his drawing-room with my
  person, complete his life with my poor existence. But I declare one can only
  give love against love, and you know what was the reward of my
  candour&mdash;death, dishonour, a perpetual agony! In prison noble devotions
  pressed round me. They adore the martyr. The woman remains calm. One alone
  appeared to love me a little for myself. He felt, however, but the vanity of
  love, not its holy faith; he forgot me, and as it was less he who deceived me
  than I who deceived myself I pardoned him. I consoled myself by proudly
  rallying my strength; I felt myself invulnerable, invincible. I was wrong.
  God has punished me; to-day I am afraid. Listen to me again. If you love a
  noble woman who loves you&mdash;I believe as much when I recall the Imitation
  that you read each evening&mdash;do not forget her even for a day. Listen to
  me. I have left only the consolation of living face to face with myself
  without having need to blush for any memory. Do not envy me this consolation.
  It is not that I believe that love is a dishonour before God; if I were a
  happy free woman I should dare to love with all the abandonment of my soul
  and my heart and my being. In my position it is impossible. In my position as
  regards you it is even more impossible. An Inspector-General! Ah, why have
  you looked on me, as no one ever looked on me before? Why have you understood
  me, dominated me, fascinated me, as no one has ever understood me, dominated
  me, fascinated me before? Adieu, monsieur, adieu. If your heart can read
  mine, it will understand that it is irrevocable that I prefer the respect of
  your dear, of your beloved memory to the happiness of saying to you au
  revoir, to exposing myself perhaps to merit your contempt. I suffer. Be
  happy, and in the solitude of your empty hearth, your hearth shadowed by
  death, do not believe yourself alone&mdash;for one is never alone when one is
  loved. They sent me your letter closed; knowing it by heart I have burnt it;
  burn mine. For eight days I have had fever. That is the result of my
  courage&mdash;that always affects my health. It is nothing serious
  unfortunately. I am only able to be active for about three hours every
  evening. I am still under the power of an infatuation. You believe that that
  will not continue. It is very flattering, but is true, I fear it. Poor,
  half-dead creature that I am, I have come again to life. I have given myself
  the task of bearing all my sicknesses in my heart, of crushing all my
  instincts of revolt. It is hard to endure, but less hard than a fixed idea.
  M. de Villars has tried to console me with a charming delicacy. I have seen
  his pictures of Corsica, in which you are interested. We talk Italian
  together. I look often with pleasure at the beautiful face of St. John
  because I know that you also look at it with pleasure and find it beautiful.
  Adieu. If you ever need a sister, call Marie. She will respond. I am keeping
  up bravely despite the cough and the fever. This is what has been
  arranged&mdash;at half-past four I go to the Infirmary and superintend the
  bandaging; I write down observations on the sick people to guide M. Pourchet,
  also on the state of the invalids. Besides, the good M.&mdash;&mdash; whom I
  have seen has given me the charge of superintending everything, so that I can
  go about a little and console the most interesting prisoners and perhaps be
  useful to them, by charging myself with their correspondence and so on. The
  Inspector has shown me all over the hospital. His astonishment was prodigious
  when he saw that I knew the names of the various prisoners, and that in spite
  of all the surveillance. This visit, that I feared, was instead a real
  triumph. There was a young, sick woman lying in agony. She had a contagious
  malady and was in a room by herself. Even in her delirium she was tormented
  by despair for fear that she would not see me as her companions did. When I
  entered and the nun told her my name, she raised her large mournful eyes
  towards me and said, "No, it is not she. It is an illusion of my illness. I
  must die alone." I talked to her, I took her hand. "Ah," cried she in
  recognising my voice, "It is indeed she, and I did not know her." The efiect
  of my long visit was so good that this evening she is better, and perhaps I
  have saved her. You have given me advice. I °ffer you the half of the first
  joy that has come to me. Love me then a little. You see that I have been
  forced to love you much. M. Moreau and the Prefect have sent me from Paris a
  piano-organ and I hope that we shall play and sing to you a beautiful Mass
  when you return. Meanwhile, if you pray for me, let it be to God to take me
  to another world. I sufier. The years are so long that, in seeing your return
  across their shadows, I desire it no more. One word of reproach to conclude.
  Why have you asked my advice on the most difficult practices of our religion
  when you would be able to give me lessons on that subject? As for myself,
  poor woman that I am, I have never reached the heights of a confession by
  double-entry [en partie double]. After your departure when I passed near my
  table I felt the memory of a little ray of sun upon my cheek. You know what I
  mean, you will remember my little ray in one of those moments when you ask
  for plenary indulgence, by denouncing the beams that are found in the heart
  of your neighbour. It is true that a ray of sun on the cheek is not a beam in
  the heart, but nevertheless forget. I shall remember for both. What a great
  saint you would be! Avow that you owe me a compliment when I tell you that
  with your character you will find in a great happiness or an immense joy the
  strength to cast yourself into a Confessional! This is to make a prophecy.
  The glance turns backwards.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL the material on which this study is based has been taken
  from French sources, not hitherto translated, save in the case of the
  <i>Mémoires</i>. I have not seen the English version of this book. In
  offering translations of the letters of an arch-romantic writing in the first
  half of the nineteenth century, I should like to borrow the apology of the
  writer of the article on the Lafarge case in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
  1842&mdash;"It is difficult, if not impossible, to put into intelligible
  English, these expressions of French sentiment."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY AND NOTES</h2>

  <p class="first">REPORTS of the trials of Madame Lafarge, her correspondence
  and her <i>Mémoires</i> are the main authorities for the foregoing narrative,
  which owes nothing to the invention of the author.</p>

  <p>The <i>Memoirs</i> of Madame Lafarge, written in the prison of Tulle and
  published in order to raise funds for her defence, is a remarkable piece of
  writing. Not only does the writer present a clear portrait of herself as she
  wished to appear, she gives a skilful and often charming and brilliant
  account of her childhood and youth, and of her family and friends. In parts
  the autobiography can be compared with Stendhal's <i>Henri Brulard</i>. Marie
  Cappelle does not spare either herself or her acquaintances; both her
  self-revelations and her comments on the behaviour of others are shrewd,
  ironic and often very intelligent; she gives lively character sketches
  neither sentimentalised nor malicious, and there are many passages of genuine
  feeling and tenderness. She even seems to have the capacity of laughing at
  herself and her chagrins, humiliations and disappointments; her faults and
  failures are chronicled with what appears to be detached irony. Other
  passages reveal more than the writer intended, the incurable romantic, the
  implacable egotist, an erotic sensibility, a greed for luxury, ease and
  pleasure, a keen eye to material security as well as an absorption in a dream
  life.</p>

  <p>The exact degree of truth contained in these fascinating pages will never
  be known; many of the details are obviously true, all that can be placed
  under the heading "period atmosphere" must be accurate. Marie Cappelle had no
  object in falsifying the world that she accepted as a matter of course. As to
  how far she may be taken as a guide through the intricacies of her own story,
  this must be left to the discretion of her readers; it is not perhaps
  difficult to see the truth beneath the graceful phrases and attractive
  colouring of what is a skilful piece of special pleading&mdash;a speech for
  the defence.</p>

  <p>Most of Marie Cappelle's very large correspondence has been published, and
  the reports of her trials and comments thereon are voluminous.<br>

  <p><i>Review of three works on Madame Lafarge</i>: the two above accounts of
  the trial and the <i>Mémoires</i> in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for July,
  1842.</p>

  <p>The author of this article considers the <i>Memoirs</i> to be the work of
  a professional writer employing material supplied by Madame Lafarge.</p>

  <p>A careful study of her correspondence does not, however, support this
  view. That the literary style of the <i>Mémoirs</i> was corrected in the
  publisher's office is probable; but unless Madame Lafarge was self-deceived
  to the point of insanity, the <i>Mémoirs</i> were written by herself, since
  she refers to her authorship of the work constantly to the publisher himself,
  who, if she had not written it, must have known so. Besides, her long
  letters, her <i>Heures de Prison</i>, her <i>pensées</i>, her poems, her
  authorship of which has never been challenged, show the same style, the same
  talent as the <i>Mémoires</i>.</p>

  <p>The French novels, plays, newspapers and letters of the
  period&mdash;1818-1850&mdash;which are essential to an understanding of the
  story of Marie Cappelle form a list too long to be given here; many of these
  romances and dramas have become classics.</p>

  <p>The iconography of this period is very rich and indispensable to a study
  of it; but no catalogue of that branch of it that bears upon the subject of
  Marie Cappelle can be attempted here; in the 1843 edition of the
  <i>Mémoires</i> (given above) are three portraits of this heroine and one of
  her fellow-romantic, Marie de Nicolai, the Vicomtesse de Léautard.</p>
