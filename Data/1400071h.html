  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro"></a><small>INTRODUCTION</small><br>
  AFTER THE DEADLOCK ON THE AISNE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE fourth despatch of Field-Marshal Sir John French,
  dealing with the operations of the army under his command from the time the
  British forces left the trenches on the Aisne, and took up new positions in
  Northern France and in Flanders, is necessarily a crowded one, filled with
  stories of surprising and absorbing interest. "The deeds of the troops in
  these days," Sir John French has said, "will furnish some of the most
  brilliant chapters which will be found in the military history of our time."
  For many days the left flank of the Armies was in an exceedingly critical
  condition, and it is easy to see from the despatches how near the Germans
  were to establishing themselves on the northern coast of France.</p>

  <p>Such was the magnitude of the operations, however, that the Commander-in-
  Chief is obliged to dismiss in a few lines actions which in other times would
  have been given far more prominence.</p>

  <p>As it is they will live in history as glorious and memorable achievements.
  "No more arduous task," Sir John French has testified "has ever been assigned
  to British soldiers, and in all their splendid history there is no instance
  of their having answered so magnificently to the desperate calls which of
  necessity were made upon them."</p>

  <p>I propose in this volume to give in full the memorable despatch, and,
  because of the necessary brevity with which it deals with great and important
  events and heroic struggles, I shall devote the rest of the volume to setting
  out more fully the great story which is only outlined in Sir John French's
  despatch. From its official nature, the despatch omits, of necessity, a mass
  of information which has reached us in other ways in incomplete, fragmentary,
  and disconnected forms. In supplying this descriptive matter, in filling in
  the wonderful story of marches and counter marches, of strategical and
  tactical manoeuvres, in telling of the great combats which took place, and of
  the regimental and individual acts of heroism, I hope to get these great
  events into some kind of perspective, and to present a connected story of how
  the glorious work was accomplished.</p>

  <p>It was a delicate operation to withdraw the British forces from their
  position on the Aisne (where we left them at the conclusion of the previous
  volume) and transfer them to new positions a long way off in Northern France
  and Flanders. The prolonged battle of Ypres-Armentières, or the battle for
  the coast, as it has sometimes been called, was a development of the
  continuous struggle which commenced on the Aisne after the Great German
  Retreat from Paris. After weeks of continual stalemate, when neither side
  could move the other from strong entrenched positions, the efforts of the
  Allies and Germans alike were directed to attempting to outflank each other.
  There came a time on the Aisne when General Sir John French made up his mind
  that he would force events elsewhere.</p>

  <p>It was on October 3rd that Field-Marshal Sir John French began the series
  of operations which had for its object the moving of his army from the
  position it held on the Aisne to the northernmost part of France. The object
  of the German commander had become clear; from necessity he had to extend his
  line northward to preserve his right flank from the threatening Allies. They
  made a virtue of that necessity by moving large bodies of troops in the
  direction of the coast. General Joffre was endeavouring to bring his troops
  in order to outflank the enemy and to drive him in upon his own interior
  lines. It is at this point that the despatch of Sir John French, with the
  contents of which this volume deals, begins. The full text of the
  Commander-in-Chief's official account of events follows.</p>

  <h3>YPRES&mdash;ARMENTIÈRES</h3>

  <p class="cp">(<i>From Field-Marshal Sir John French</i>)</p><br>

  <p class="first">RECEIVED by the Secretary of State for War from the Field-
  Marshal Commanding- in-Chief British Forces in the Field:&mdash;</p>

  <p>General Headquarters, <i>November 20, 1914.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p>1. I have the honour to submit a further despatch recounting the
  operations of the Field Force under my command throughout the battle of
  Ypres- Armentières.</p>

  <p>Early in October a study of the general situation strongly impressed me
  with the necessity of bringing the greatest possible force to bear in support
  of the northern flank of the Allies, in order effectively to outflank the
  enemy and compel him to evacuate his positions.</p>

  <p>At the same time the position on the Aisne, as described in the concluding
  paragraphs of my last despatch, appeared to me to warrant a withdrawal of the
  British Forces from the positions they then held.</p>

  <p>The enemy had been weakened by continual abortive and futile attacks,
  while the fortification of the position had been much improved.</p>

  <p>I represented these views to General Joffre, who fully agreed.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for withdrawal and relief having been made by the French
  General Staff, the operation commenced on October 3; and the 2nd Cavalry
  Division, under General Gough, marched for Compiègne en route for the new
  theatre.</p>

  <p>The Army Corps followed in succession at intervals of a few days, and the
  move was completed on October 19, when the 1st Corps, under Sir Douglas Haig,
  completed its detrainment at St. Omer.</p>

  <p>That this delicate operation was carried out so successfully is in great
  measure due to the excellent feeling which exists between the French and
  British Armies; and I am deeply indebted to the Commander-in-Chief and the
  French General Staff for their cordial and most effective cooperation.</p>

  <p>As General Foch* was appointed by the Commander-in-Chief to supervise the
  operations of all the French troops north of Noyon, I visited his
  headquarters at Doullens on October 8 and arranged joint plans of operations
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">* General Foch, to whose co-operation Field-Marshal Sir
  John French refers in such cordial terms, was, with General Joffre, decorated
  with the Grand Cross of the Bath on the occasion of H.M. the King's visit to
  the firing- line in December, 1914.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Corps to arrive on the line Aire-Bethune on October 11, to connect
  with the right of the French 10th Army and, pivoting on its left, to attack
  in flank the enemy who were opposing the 10th French Corps in front.</p>

  <p>The Cavalry to move on the northern flank of the 2nd Corps and support its
  attack until the 3rd Corps, which was to detrain at St. Omer on the 12th,
  should come up. They were then to clear the front and act on the northern
  flank of the 3rd Corps in a similar manner, pending the arrival of the 1st
  Corps from the Aisne.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Cavalry Division and 7th Division, under Sir Henry Rawlinson,
  which were then operating in support of the Belgian Army and assisting its
  withdrawal from Antwerp, to be ordered to co-operate as soon as circumstances
  would allow.</p>

  <p>In the event of these movements so far overcoming the resistance of the
  enemy as to enable a forward movement to be made, all the Allied Forces to
  march in an easterly direction. The road running from Bethune to Lille was to
  be the dividing line between the British and French Forces, the right of the
  British Army being directed on Lille.</p>

  <p>2. The great battle, which is mainly the subject of this despatch, may be
  said to have commenced on October 11, on which date the 2nd Cavalry Division,
  under General Gough, first came into contact with the enemy's cavalry who
  were holding some woods to the north of the Bethune-Aire Canal. These were
  cleared of the enemy by our cavalry, which then joined hands with the
  Divisional Cavalry of the 6th Division in the neighbourhood of Hazebrouck. On
  the same day the right of the 2nd Cavalry Division connected with the left of
  the 2nd Corps which was moving in a north-easterly direction after crossing
  the above- mentioned canal.</p>

  <p>By October ii Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien had reached the line of the canal
  between Aire and Bethune. I directed him to continue his march on the 12th,
  bringing up his left in the direction of Merville. Then he was to move east
  to the Laventie-Lorgies, which would bring him on the immediate left of the
  French Army and threaten the German flank.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* At this time the Germans were engaged in a fierce
  battle with the French at Arras, and there were, apparently, no considerable
  number of troops available for the extension of the enemy line. But leaving
  von Kluck to hold an extended line from Soissons almost to the Argonne, first
  von Buelow's, then the King of Wurtemburg's, and finally the Crown Prince of
  Bavaria's Armies were moved northward, and it was against these latter,
  strengthened by certain Prussian Corps, that the British found themselves
  fighting.</p>

  <p>On the 12th this movement was commenced.</p>

  <p>The 5th Division connected up with the left of the French Army north of
  Annequin. They moved to the attack of the Germans who were engaged at this
  point with the French; but the enemy once more extended his right in some
  strength to meet the threat against his flank. The 3rd Division, having
  crossed the canal, deployed on the left of the 5th; and the whole 2nd Corps
  again advanced to the attack, but were unable to make much headway owing to
  the difficult character of the ground upon which they were operating, which
  was similar to that usually found in manufacturing districts and was covered
  with mining works, factories, buildings, etc. The ground throughout this
  country is remarkably flat, rendering effective artillery support very
  difficult.</p>

  <p>Before nightfall, however, they had made some advance and had successfully
  driven back hostile counter-attacks with great loss to the enemy and
  destruction of some of his machine guns.</p>

  <p>On and after October 13 the object of the General Officer Commanding the
  2nd Corps was to wheel to his right, pivoting on Givenchy to get astride the
  La Bassée-Lille Road in the neighbourhood of Fournes, so as to threaten the
  right flank and rear of the enemy's position on the high ground south of La
  Bassée.</p>

  <p>This position of La Bassée has throughout the battle defied all attempts
  at capture, either by the French or the British.</p>

  <p>On this day Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien could make but little progress. He
  particularly mentions the fine fighting of the Dorsets, whose Commanding
  Officer, Major Roper, was killed* They suffered no fewer than 400 casualties,
  130 of them being killed, but maintained all day their hold on Pont Fixe. He
  also refers to the gallantry of the Artillery.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A reference to the work of the Dorsets will be found in
  the accompanying narrative. The artillery has been so consistently good that
  there is a danger from the very level of its excellence we may be overlooking
  its superlative merit. From the moment the first gun was fired at Mons up to
  the end of the battle for the coast the Royal Regiment of Artillery
  accomplished marvels.</p>

  <p>The fighting of the 2nd Corps continued throughout the 14th in the same
  direction. On this day the Army suffered a great loss, in that the Commander
  of the 3rd Division, General Hubert Hamilton, was killed.</p>

  <p>On the 15th the 3rd Division fought splendidly, crossing the dykes, with
  which this country is intersected, with planks; and driving the enemy from
  one entrenched position to another in loop-holed villages, till at night they
  pushed the Germans off the Estaires-La Bassée Road and established themselves
  on the line Pont de Ham-Croix Barbie.</p>

  <p>On the 16th the move was continued until the left flank of the Corps was
  in front of the village of Aubers, which was strongly held. This village was
  captured on the 17th by the 9th Infantry Brigade, and at dark on the same day
  the Lincolns and Royal Fusiliers carried the village of Herlies at the point
  of the bayonet after a fine attack, the Brigade being handled with great dash
  by Brigadier General Shaw.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A thrilling description of this fight will be found in
  the accompanying narrative, page 78.</p>

  <p>At this time, to the best of our information, the 2nd Corps was believed
  to be opposed by the 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 9th German Cavalry Divisions,
  supported by several battalions of Jaegers and a part of the 14th German
  Corps.</p>

  <p>On the 18th powerful counter-attacks were made by the enemy all along the
  front of the 2nd Corps, and were most gallantly repulsed; but only slight
  progress could be made.</p>

  <p>From October 19 to October 31 the 2nd Corps carried on a most gallant
  fight in defence of their position against very superior numbers, the enemy
  having being reinforced during that time by at least one Division of the 7th
  Corps, a brigade of the 3rd Corps, and the whole of the 14th Corps, which had
  moved north from in front of the French 21st Corps.</p>

  <p>On the 19th the Royal Irish Regiment, under Major Daniell, stormed and
  carried the village of Le Pilly, which they held and entrenched. On the 20th,
  however, they were cut off and surrounded, suffering heavy losses.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 22nd the enemy made a very determined attack on the
  5th Division, who were driven out of the village of Violaines, but they were
  sharply counter-attacked by the Worcesters and Manchesters, and prevented
  from coming on.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The work of these two regiments has been uniformly
  excellent, and a further exploit of the Worcesters will be found on page
  138.</p>

  <p>The left of the 2nd Corps being now somewhat exposed, Sir Horace Smith-
  Dorrien withdrew the line during the night to a position he had previously
  prepared, running generally from the eastern side of Givenchy, east of Neuve
  Chapelle to Fauquissart.</p>

  <p>On October 24 the Lahore Division of the Indian Army Corps, under Major-
  General Watkis, having arrived, I sent them to the neighbourhood of Lacon to
  support the 2nd Corps.</p>

  <p>Very early on this morning the enemy commenced a heavy attack, but owing
  to the skilful manner in which the artillery was handled and the targets
  presented by the enemy's infantry as it approached, they were unable to come
  to close quarters. Towards the evening a heavy attack developed against the
  7th Brigade, which was repulsed, with very heavy loss to the enemy, by the
  Wiltshires and the Royal West Kents.* Later a determined attack on the 18th
  Infantry Brigade drove the Gordon Highlanders out of their trenches, which
  were retaken by the Middlesex Regiment, gallantly led by Lieutenant-Colonel
  Hull.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* See page 125.</p>

  <p>The 8th Infantry Brigade (which had come into line on the left of the 2nd
  Corps) was also heavily attacked, but the enemy was driven off.</p>

  <p>In both these cases the Germans lost very heavily, and left large numbers
  of dead and prisoners behind them.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Corps was now becoming exhausted, owing to the constant
  reinforcements of the enemy, the length of line which it had to defend, and
  the enormous losses which it had suffered.</p>

  <p>By the evening of October 11 the 3rd Corps had practically completed its
  detrainment at St. Omer, and was moved east to Hazebrouck, where the Corps
  remained throughout the 12th.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 13th the advanced guard of the Corps, consisting of
  the 19th Infantry Brigade and a Brigade of Field Artillery, occupied the
  position of the line Strazeele Station-Caestre-St. Sylvestre.</p>

  <p>On this day I directed General Pulteney to move towards the line
  Armentières-Wytschaete; warning him, however, that should the 2nd Corps
  require his aid he must be prepared to move south-east to support it.</p>

  <p>A French Cavalry Corps under General Conneau was operating between the 2nd
  and 3rd Corps.</p>

  <p>The 4th German Cavalry Corps, supported by some Jaeger Battalions,* was
  known to be occupying the position in the neighbourhood of Meteren; and they
  were believed to be further supported by the advanced guard of another German
  Army Corps.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Light Infantry Regiments.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of his orders, General Pulteney proceeded to attack the enemy
  in his front.</p>

  <p>The rain and fog which prevailed prevented full advantage being derived
  from our much superior artillery. The country was very much enclosed and
  rendered difficult by heavy rain.</p>

  <p>The enemy were, however, routed and the position taken at dark, several
  prisoners being captured.</p>

  <p>During the night the 3rd Corps made good the attacked position and
  entrenched it.</p>

  <p>As Bailleul was known to be occupied by the enemy, arrangements were made
  during the night to attack it, but reconnaissances sent out on the morning of
  the 14th showed that they had withdrawn, and the town was taken by our troops
  at 10 a.m. on that day, many wounded Germans being found and taken in it.</p>

  <p>The Corps then occupied the line St. Jans Cappel-Bailleul.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 15th the 3rd Corps were ordered to make good the
  line of the Lys from Armentières to Sailly, which, in the face of
  considerable opposition and very foggy weather, they succeeded in doing, the
  6th Division at Sailly-Bac St. Maur and the 4th Division at Nieppe.</p>

  <p>The enemy in its front having retired, the 3rd Corps on the night of the
  17th occupied the line Bois Grenier-Le Gheir.</p>

  <p>On the 18th the enemy were holding a line from Radinghem on the south,
  through Perenchies and Frelinghien on the north, whence the German troops
  which were opposing the Cavalry Corps occupied the east bank of the river as
  far as Wervick.</p>

  <p>On this day I directed the 3rd Corps to move down the valley of the Lys
  and endeavour to assist the Cavalry Corps in making good its position on the
  right bank. To do this it was necessary first to drive the enemy eastward
  towards Lille. A vigorous offensive in the direction of Lille was assumed,
  but the enemy was found to have been considerably reinforced, and but little
  progress was made.</p>

  <p>The situation of the 3rd Corps on the night of the 18th was as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The 6th Division was holding the line Radinghem-La Vallée- Armentières-
  Capinghem-Premesques Railway Line 300 yards east of Halte. The 4th Division
  were holding the line from L'Epinette to the river at a point 400 yards south
  of Frelinghien, and thence to a point half a mile south-east of Le Gheir. The
  Corps Reserve was at Armentières Station, with right and left flanks of Corps
  in close touch with French Cavalry and the Cavalry Corps.</p>

  <p>Since the advance from Bailleul the enemy's forces in front of the Cavalry
  and 3rd Corps had been strongly reinforced, and on the night of the 17th they
  were opposed by three or four divisions of the enemy's cavalry, the 19th
  Saxon Corps and at least one division of the 7th Corps. Reinforcements for
  the enemy were known to be coming up from the direction of Lille.</p>

  <p>Following the movements completed on October 11, the 2nd Cavalry Division
  pushed the enemy back through Flêtre and Le Coq de Paille, and took Mont des
  Cats, just before dark, after stiff fighting.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The Mont des Cats is one of the few eminences in this
  somewhat featureless country. Only the most meagre description of this fight
  has been placed on record. The enemy had entrenched the slopes and held both
  flanks of the hill# and its capture by cavalry was a notable achievement.</p>

  <p>On the 14th the 1st Cavalry Division joined up, and the whole Cavalry
  Corps under General Allenby, moving north, secured the high ground above
  Berthen, overcoming considerable opposition.</p>

  <p>With a view to a further advance east, I ordered General Allenby, on the
  15th, to reconnoitre the line of the River Lys, and endeavour to secure the
  passages on the opposite bank, pending the arrival of the 3rd and 4th
  Corps.</p>

  <p>During the 15th and 16th this reconnaissance was most skilfully and
  energetically carried out in the face of great opposition, especially along
  the lower line of the river.</p>

  <p>These operations were continued throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th; but,
  although valuable information was gained, and strong forces of the enemy held
  in check, the Cavalry Corps was unable to secure passages or to establish a
  permanent footing on the eastern bank of the river.</p>

  <p>At this point in the history of the operations under report it is
  necessary that I should return to the co-operation of the forces operating in
  the neighbourhood of Ghent and Antwerp under Lieutenant-General Sir Henry
  Rawlinson, as the action of his force about this period exercised, in my
  opinion, a great influence on the course of the subsequent operations.</p>

  <p>This force, consisting of the 3rd Cavalry Division under Major-General the
  Hon. Julian Byng, and the 7th Division, under Major-General Capper, was
  placed under my orders by telegraphic instructions from your Lordship.</p>

  <p>On receipt of these instructions I directed Sir Henry Rawlinson to
  continue his operations in covering and protecting the withdrawal of the
  Belgian Army, and subsequently to form the left column in the eastward
  advance of the British forces. These withdrawal operations were concluded
  about October 16, on which date the 7th Division was posted to the east of
  Ypres on a line extending from Zandvoorde through Gheluvelt to Zonnebeke. The
  3rd Cavalry Division was on its left towards Langemarck and Poelcappelle.</p>

  <p>In this position Sir Henry Rawlinson was supported by the 87th French
  Territorial Division in Ypres and Vlamertinghe and by the 89th French
  Territorial Division at Poperinghe.</p>

  <p>On the night of the 16th I informed Sir Henry Rawlinson of the operations
  which were in progress by the Cavalry Corps and the 3rd Corps, and ordered
  him to conform to those movements in an easterly direction, keeping an eye
  always to any threat which might be made against him from the north-east.</p>

  <p>A very difficult task was allotted to Sir Henry Rawlinson and his
  command.* Owing to the importance of keeping possession of all the ground
  towards the north which we already held, it was necessary for him to operate
  on a very wide front, and until the arrival of the 1st Corps in the northern
  theatre&mdash;which I expected about the 20th&mdash;I had no troops available
  with which to support or reinforce him.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The circumstances which led to the formation of the 4th
  Corps will be found in the narrative on page 93.</p>

  <p>Although on this extended front he had eventually to encounter very
  superior forces, his troops, both cavalry and infantry, fought with the
  utmost gallantry and rendered very signal service.</p>

  <p>On the 17th four French Cavalry Divisions deployed on the left of the 3rd
  Cavalry Division and drove back advanced parties of the enemy beyond the
  Forêt d'Houthulst.</p>

  <p>As described above, instructions for a vigorous attempt to establish the
  British Forces east of the Lys were given on the night of the 17th to the
  2nd, 3rd, and Cavalry Corps.</p>

  <p>I considered, however, that the possession of Menin constituted a very
  important point of passage, and would much facilitate the advance of the rest
  of the Army. So I directed the General Officer Commanding the 4th Corps to
  advance the 7th Division upon Menin and endeavour to seize that crossing on
  the morning of the 18th.</p>

  <p>The left of the 7th Division was to be supported by the 3rd Cavalry
  Brigade and further north by the French Cavalry in the neighbourhood of
  Roulers.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Rawlinson represented to me that large hostile forces were
  advancing upon him from the east and north-east and that his left flank was
  severely threatened.</p>

  <p>I was aware of the threats from that direction, but hoped at this
  particular time there was no greater force coming from the north-east than
  could be held off by the combined efforts of the French and British Cavalry
  and the Territorial troops supporting them until the passage at Menin could
  be seized and the 1st Corps brought up in support.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Rawlinson probably exercised a wise judgment in not committing
  his troops to this attack in their somewhat weakened condition, but the
  result was that the enemy's continued possession of the passage at Menin
  certainly facilitated his rapid reinforcement of his troops and thus rendered
  any further advance impracticable.</p>

  <p>On the morning of October 20 the 7th Division and 3rd Cavalry Division had
  retired to their old position extending from Zandvoorde through Kruiseik and
  Gheluvelt to Zonnebeke.</p>

  <p>On October 19 the 1st Corps, coming from the Aisne, had completed its
  detrainment and was concentrated between St. Omer and Hazebrouck.</p>

  <p>A question of vital importance now arose for decision.</p>

  <p>I knew that the enemy were by this time in greatly superior strength on
  the Lys, and that the 2nd, 3rd, Cavalry, and 4th Corps were holding a much
  wider front than their numbers and strength warranted.</p>

  <p>Taking these facts alone into consideration, it would have appeared wise
  to throw the 1st Corps in to strengthen the line, but this would have left
  the country north and east of Ypres and the Ypres Canal open to a wide
  turning movement by the 3rd Reserve Corps and at least one <i>Landwehr</i>
Division
  which I knew to be operating in that region. I was also aware that the enemy
  was bringing large reinforcements up from the East which could only be
  opposed for several days by two or three French Cavalry Divisions, some
  French Territorial troops, and the Belgian Army.</p>

  <p>After the hard fighting it had undergone the Belgian Army was in no
  condition to withstand, unsupported, such an attack; and unless some
  substantial resistance could be offered to this threatened turning movement,
  the Allied flank must be turned and the Channel Ports laid bare to the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>I judged that a successful movement of this kind would be fraught with
  such disastrous consequences that the risk of operating on so extended a
  front must be undertaken; and I directed Sir Douglas Haig to move with the
  1st Corps to the north of Ypres.</p>

  <p>From the best information at my disposal I judged at this time that the
  considerable reinforcements which the enemy had undoubtedly brought up during
  the 16th, 17th, and 18th, had been directed principally on the line of the
  Lys and against the 2nd Corps at La Bassée; and that Sir Douglas Haig would
  probably not be opposed north of Ypres by much more than the 3rd Reserve
  Corps, which I knew to have suffered considerably in its previous operations,
  and perhaps one or two <i>Landwehr</i> Divisions.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Throughout the campaign after the first onslaught,
  Field-Marshal French has been very well informed by his scouts and "agents"
  as to the disposition and strength of the enemy.</p>

  <p>At a personal interview with Sir Douglas Haig on the evening of October 19
  I communicated the above information to him, and instructed him to advance
  with the 1st Corps through Ypres to Thourout. The object he was to have in
  view was to be the capture of Bruges and subsequently, if possible, to drive
  the enemy towards Ghent. In case of an unforeseen situation arising, or the
  enemy proving to be stronger than anticipated, he was to decide, after
  passing Ypres, according to the situation, whether to attack the enemy lying
  to the north or the hostile forces advancing from the east; I had arranged
  for the French Cavalry to operate on the left of the 1st Corps and the 3rd
  Cavalry Division, under General Byng, on its right.</p>

  <p>The Belgian Army were rendering what assistance they could by entrenching
  themselves on the Ypres Canal and the Yser River; and the troops, although in
  the last stage of exhaustion, gallantly maintained their positions, buoyed up
  with the hope of substantial British and French support.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The battle for the coast brought out the fine staying
  qualities of the Belgian Army, to which a tribute is paid in the
  narrative.</p>

  <p>I fully realised the difficult task which lay before us, and the onerous
  rôle which the British Army was called upon to fulfil.</p>

  <p>That success has been attained, and all the enemy's desperate attempts to
  break through our line frustrated, is due entirely to the marvellous fighting
  power and the indomitable courage and tenacity of officers, non-commissioned
  officers, and men.</p>

  <p>No more arduous task has ever been assigned to British soldiers; and in
  all their splendid history there is no instance of their having answered so
  magnificently to the desperate calls which of necessity were made upon
  them.</p>

  <p>Having given these orders to Sir Douglas Haig, I enjoined
  a defensive role upon the 2nd and 3rd and Cavalry Corps, in
  view of the superiority of force which had accumulated in their front. As
  regards the 4th Corps, I directed Sir Henry Rawlinson to endeavour to conform
  generally to the movements of the 1st Corps.</p>

  <p>On October 20 they reached the line from Elverdinghe to the cross-roads,
  one and a half miles north-west of Zonnebeke.</p>

  <p>On the 21st the Corps was ordered to attack and take the line
  Poelcappelle-Passchendaele.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Rawlinson's Command was moving on the right of the 1st Corps,
  and French troops, consisting of Cavalry and Territorials, moved on their
  left under the orders of General Bidon.</p>

  <p>The advance was somewhat delayed owing to the roads being blocked; but the
  attack progressed favourably in face of severe opposition, often
  necessitating the use of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>Hearing of heavy attacks being made upon the 7th Division and the 2nd
  Cavalry Division on his right, Sir Douglas Haig ordered his reserve to be
  halted on the north-eastern outskirts of Ypres.</p>

  <p>Although threatened by a hostile movement from the Fôret d'Houthulst, our
  advance was successful until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when the
  French Cavalry Corps received orders to retire west of the canal.</p>

  <p>Owing to this and the demands made on him by the 4th Corps, Sir Douglas
  Haig was unable to advance beyond the line Zonnebeke-St. Julien-Langemarck-
  Bixschoote.</p>

  <p>As there was reported to be congestion with French troops at Ypres, I went
  there on the evening of the 21st and met Sir Douglas Haig and Sir Henry
  Rawlinson. With them I interviewed General de Mitry, Commanding the French
  Cavalry, and General Bidon, Commanding the French Territorial Divisions.</p>

  <p>They promised me that the town would at once be cleared of the troops, and
  that the French Territorials would immediately move out and cover the left of
  the flank of the 1st Corps.</p>

  <p>I discussed the situation with the General Officers Commanding the 1st and
  4th Army Corps, and told them that, in view of the unexpected reinforcements
  coming up of the enemy, it would probably be impossible to carry out the
  original role assigned to them. But I informed them that I had that day
  interviewed the French Commander-in-Chief, General Joffre, who told me that
  he was bringing up the 9th French Army Corps to Ypres, that more French
  troops would follow later, and that he intended&mdash;in conjunction with the
  Belgian troops&mdash;to drive the Germans east. General Joffre said that he
  would be unable to commence this movement before the 24th; and I directed the
  General Officers Commanding the 1st and 4th Corps to strengthen their
  positions as much as possible and be prepared to hold their ground for two or
  three days, until the French offensive movement on the north could
  develop.</p>

  <p>It now became clear to me that the utmost we could do to ward off any
  attempts of the enemy to turn our flank to the north, or to break in from the
  eastward, was to maintain our present very extended front, and to hold fast
  our positions until French reinforcements could arrive from the south.</p>

  <p>During the 22nd the necessity of sending support to the 4th Corps on his
  right somewhat hampered the General Officer Commanding the 1st Corps; but a
  series of attacks all along his front had been driven back during the day
  with heavy loss to the enemy. Late in the evening the enemy succeeded in
  penetrating a portion of the line held by the Cameron Highlanders north of
  Pilkem.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>At 6 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd a counterattack to recover the lost
  trenches was made by the Queen's Regiment, the Northamptons, and the King's
  Royal Rifles, under Major-General Bulfin. The attack was very strongly
  opposed and the bayonet had to be used. After severe fighting during most of
  the day the attack was brilliantly successful, and over six hundred prisoners
  were taken.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* These three regiments have done consistently well
  throughout the campaign. Some idea of the pressure exerted against the
  Camerons may be gathered from the fact that it was necessary to send three
  battalions to retake the position from which they were driven by overwhelming
  numbers.</p>

  <p>On the same day an attack, was made on the 3rd Infantry Brigade. The enemy
  advanced with great determination, but with little skill, and consequently
  the loss inflicted on him was exceedingly heavy; some fifteen hundred dead
  were seen in the neighbourhood of Langemarck. Correspondence found
  subsequently on a captured German Officer stated that the effectives of this
  attacking Corps were reduced to 25 per cent, in the course of the day's
  fighting.</p>

  <p>In the evening of this day a division of the French 9th Army Corps came up
  into line and took over the portion of the line held by the 2nd Division,
  which, on the 24th, took up the ground occupied by the 7th Division from
  Poelzelhoek to the Becelaere-Passchendaele Road.</p>

  <p>On the 24th and 25th October repeated attacks by the enemy were
  brilliantly repulsed.</p>

  <p>On the night of the 24th-25th the 1st Division was relieved by French
  Territorial troops and concentrated about Zillebeke.</p>

  <p>During the 25th the 2nd Division, with the 7th on its right and the French
  9th Corps on its left, made good progress towards the north-east, capturing
  some guns and prisoners.</p>

  <p>On October 27 I went to the headquarters of the 1st Corps at Hooge to
  personally investigate the condition of the 7th Division.</p>

  <p>Owing to constant marching and fighting, ever since its hasty
  disembarkation, in aid of tin Antwerp Garrison, this division had suffered
  great losses, and were becoming very weak, therefore decided temporarily to
  break up the 4th Corps and place the 7th Division with the 1st Corps under
  the command of Sir Dougla Haig.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Cavalry Division was similarly detaile for service with the 1st
  Corps.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* There was only one infantry division in this weak corps
  and the task assigned to it had been a very heavy one.</p>

  <p>I directed the 4th Corps Commander to proceed with his Staff, to England,
  to watch and supervise the mobilisation of his 8th Division, which was then
  proceeding.</p>

  <p>On receipt of orders, in accordance with the above arrangement, Sir
  Douglas Haig redistributed the line held by the First Corps as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(a) 7th Division from the Château east of 510 Zandvoorde to the Menin
  Road.</p>

  <p>(b) 1st Division from the Menin Road to a point immediately west of Reytel
  Village.</p>

  <p>(c) 2nd Division to near Moorslede-Zonnebeke Road.</p>

  <p>On the early morning of October 29 a heavy attack developed against the
  centre of the line held by the 1st Corps, the principal point of attack being
  the cross-roads one mile east of Gheluvelt. After severe
  fighting&mdash;nearly the whole of the Corps being employed in counter
  attack&mdash;the enemy began to give way at about 2 p.m.; and by dark the
  Kruiseik Hill had been recaptured and the 1st Brigade had re-established most
  of the line north of the Menin Road.</p>

  <p>Shortly after daylight on the 30th another attack began to develop in the
  direction of Zandvoorde, supported by heavy artillery fire. In face of this
  attack the 3rd Cavalry Division had to withdraw to the Klein Zillebeke ridge.
  This "withdrawal" involved the right of the 7th Division. Sir Douglas Haig
  describes the position at this period as serious, the Germans being in
  possession of Zandvoorde Ridge.</p>

  <p>Subsequent investigation showed that the enemy had been reinforced at this
  point by the whole German Active 15th Corps.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding 1st Corps ordered the line Gheluvelt to the
  corner of the canal to be held at all costs. When this line was taken up the
  2nd Brigade was ordered to concentrate in rear of the 1st Division and the
  4th Brigade line. One battalion was placed in reserve in the woods one mile
  south of Hooge.</p>

  <p>Further precautions were taken at night to protect this flank, and the 9th
  French Corps sent three battalions and one Cavalry Brigade to assist.</p>

  <p>The 1st Corps communications through Ypres were threatened by the advance
  of the Germans towards the canal; so orders were issued for every effort to
  be made to secure the line then held and, when this had been thoroughly done,
  to resume the offensive.</p>

  <p>An order taken from a prisoner who had been captured on this day purported
  to emanate from the German General, von Beimling, and said that the 15th
  German Corps, together with the 2nd Bavarian and 13th Corps, were entrusted
  with the task of breaking through the line to Ypres; and that the Emperor
  himself considered the success of this attack to be one of vital importance
  to the successful issue of the war.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most important and decisive attack (except that of the
  Prussian Guard on November 15) made against the 1st Corps during the whole of
  its arduous experiences in the neighbourhood of Ypres took place on October
  31.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* A description of this fight is to be found on page 115
  of the narrative.</p>

  <p>General Moussy, who commanded the detachment which had been sent by the
  French 9th Corps on the previous day to assist Sir Douglas Haig on the right
  of the 1st Corps, moved to the attack early in the morning, but was brought
  to a complete standstill and could make no further progress.</p>

  <p>After several attacks and counter-attacks during the course of the morning
  along the Menin-Ypres road, south-east of Gheluvelt, an attack against that
  place developed in great force, and the line of the 1st Division was broken.
  On the south the 7th Division and General Bulfin's detachment were being
  heavily shelled. The retirement of the 1st Division exposed the left of the
  7th Division, and owing to this the Royal Scots Fusiliers, who remained in
  their trenches, were cut off and surrounded. A strong infantry attack was
  developed against the right of the 7th Division at 1.30 p.m.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this the Headquarters of the 1st and 2nd Divisions were
  shelled. The General Officer Commanding the 1st Division was wounded, three
  Staff Officers of the 1st Division and three of the 2nd Division were
  killed.* The General Officer Commanding the 2nd Division also received a
  severe shaking and was unconscious for a short time. General Landon assumed
  command of the 1st Division.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* This was an extraordinary circumstance, and shows not
  only how close up were the Staffs, but the result of German espionage,
  because there can be no doubt that the enemy received exact information as to
  the positions the Staffs occupied.</p>

  <p>On receiving a report about 2.30 p.m. from General Lomax that the 1st
  Division had moved back and that the enemy was coming on in strength, the
  General Officer Commanding the 1st Corps issued orders that the line,
  Frezenburg-Westhoek-bend of the main road-Klein Zillebeke bend of canal, was
  to be held at all costs.</p>

  <p>The 1st Division rallied on the line of the woods east of the bend of the
  road, the German advance by the road being checked by enfilade fire from the
  north.</p>

  <p>The attack against the right of the 7th Division forced the 22nd Brigade
  to retire, thus exposing the left of the 2nd Brigade. The General Officer
  Commanding the 7th Division used his reserve, already posted on his flank, to
  restore the line; but, in the meantime, the 2nd Brigade, finding their left
  flank exposed, had been forced to withdraw. The right of the 7th Division
  thus advanced as the left of the 2nd Brigade went back, with the result that
  the right of the 7th Division was exposed, but managed to hold on to its old
  trenches till nightfall.</p>

  <p>Meantime, on the Menin road, a counterattack delivered by the left of the
  1st Division and the right of the 2nd Division against the right flank of the
  German line was completely successful, and by 2.30 p.m. Gheluvelt had been
  retaken with the bayonet, the 2nd Worcester Regiment being to the fore in
  this, admirably supported by the 42nd Brigade, Royal Field Artillery.* The
  left of the 7th Division, profiting by their capture of Gheluvelt, advanced
  almost to its original line; and connection between the 1st and 7th Divisions
  was re- established. The recapture of Gheluvelt released the 6th Cavalry
  Brigade, till then held in support of the 1st Division. Two regiments of this
  brigade were sent at once to clear the woods to the south-east, and close the
  gap in the line between the 7th Division and the 2nd Brigade. They advanced
  with much dash, partly mounted and partly dismounted; and, surprising the
  enemy in the woods, succeeded in killing large numbers and materially helped
  to restore the line. About 5 p.m. the French Cavalry Brigade also came up to
  the cross-roads just east of Hooge, and at once sent forward a dismounted
  detachment to support our 7th Cavalry Brigade.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* This desperate and bloody battle for the village of
  Gheluvelt is described on page 137.</p>

  <p>Throughout the day the extreme right and left of the 1st Corps' line held
  fast, the left being only slightly engaged, while the right was heavily
  shelled and subjected to slight infantry attacks. In the evening the enemy
  were steadily driven back from the woods on the front of the 7th Division and
  2nd Brigade; and by 10 p.m. the line as held in the morning had practically
  been reoccupied.</p>

  <p>During the night touch was restored between the right of the 7th Division
  and left of the 2nd Brigade, and the Cavalry were withdrawn into reserve, the
  services of the French Cavalry being dispensed with.</p>

  <p>As a result of the day's fighting eight hundred and seventy wounded were
  evacuated.</p>

  <p>I was present with Sir Douglas Haig at Hooge between 2 and 3 o'clock on
  this day, when the 1st Division were retiring. I regard it as the most
  critical moment in the whole of this great battle. The rally of the 1st
  Division and the recapture of the village of Gheluvelt at such a time was
  fraught with momentous consequences. If any one unit can be singled out for
  especial praise it is the Worcesters.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the centre of my line, occupied by the 3rd and Cavalry
  Corps, was being heavily pressed by the enemy in ever-increasing force.</p>

  <p>On October 20 advanced posts of the 12th Brigade of the 4th Division, 3rd
  Corps, were forced to retire, and at dusk it was evident that the Germans
  were likely to make a determined attack. This ended in the occupation of Le
  Gheir by the enemy.</p>

  <p>As the position of the Cavalry at St. Yves was thus endangered, a counter-
  attack was decided upon and planned by General Hunter-Weston and Lieutenant-
  Colonel Anley. This proved entirely successful, the Germans being driven back
  with great loss and the abandoned trenches reoccupied. Two hundred prisoners
  were taken and about forty of our prisoners released.</p>

  <p>In these operations the staunchness of the King's Own Regiment and the
  Lancashire Fusiliers was most commendable. These two battalions were very
  well handled by Lieutenant-Colonel Butler, of the Lancashire Fusiliers.</p>

  <p>I am anxious to bring to special notice the excellent work done throughout
  this battle by the 3rd Corps under General Pulteney's command. Their position
  in the right central part of my line was of the utmost importance to the
  general success of the operations. Besides the very undue length of front
  which the Corps was called upon to cover (some 12 or 13 miles), the position
  presented many weak spots, and was also astride of the River Lys, the right
  bank of which from Frelinghien downwards was strongly held by the enemy. It
  was impossible to provide adequate reserves, and the constant work in the
  trenches tried the endurance of officers and men to the utmost. That the
  Corps was invariably successful in repulsing the constant attacks, sometimes
  in great strength, made against them by day and by night, is due entirely to
  the skilful manner in which the Corps was disposed by its Commander, who has
  told me of the able assistance he has received throughout from his Staff, and
  the ability and resource displayed by Divisional, Brigade, and Regimental
  leaders in using the ground and the means of defence at their disposal to the
  very best advantage.</p>

  <p>The courage, tenacity, endurance, and cheerfulness of the men in such
  unparalleled circumstances are beyond all praise.</p>

  <p>During October 22, 23, and 24 frequent attacks were made along the whole
  line of the 3rd Corps, and especially against the 16th Infantry Brigade, but
  on all occasions the enemy was thrown back with loss.</p>

  <p>During the night of October 25 the Leicestershire Regiment were forced
  from their trenches by shells blowing in the pits they were in; and after
  investigation by the General Officers Commanding the 16th and 18th Infantry
  Brigades, it was decided to throw back the line temporarily in this
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>On the evening of October 29 the enemy made a sharp attack on Le Gheir,
  and on the line to the north of it, but were repulsed.</p>

  <p>About midnight a very heavy attack developed against the 19th Infantry
  Brigade south of Croix Maréchal. A portion of the trenches of the Middlesex
  Regiment was gained by the enemy and held by him for some hours till
  recaptured with the assistance of the detachment from the Argyll and
  Sutherland Highlanders from Brigade Reserve. The enemy in the trenches were
  all bayonetted or captured. Later information from prisoners showed that
  there were twelve battalions opposite the 19th Brigade. Over two hundred dead
  Germans were left lying in front of the Brigade's trenches and forty
  prisoners were taken.</p>

    Corps.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>On the evening of the 30th the line of the 11th Infantry Brigade in the
  neighbourhood of St. Yves was broken. A counter-attack carried out by Major
  Prowse with the Somerset Light Infantry restored the situation. For his
  services on this occasion this officer was recommended for special
  reward.</p>

  <p>On October 31 it became necessary for the 4th Division to take over the
  extreme right of the 1st Cavalry Division's trenches, although this measure
  necessitated a still further extension of the line held by the 3rd Corps.</p>

  <p>On October 20, while engaged in the attempt to force the line of the River
  Lys, the Cavalry Corps was attacked from the South and East. In the evening
  the 1st Cavalry Division held the line St. Yves-Messines; the 2nd Cavalry
  Division from Messines through Garde Dieu along the Wambeck to Houthem and
  Kortewilde.</p>

  <p>At 4 p.m. on October 21 a heavy attack was made on the 2nd Cavalry
  Division which was compelled to fall back to the line Messines-9th kilo stone
  on the Wameton-Oostaveme Road-Hollebeke.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd I directed the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade, less one
  battalion, to proceed to Wulverghem in support of the Cavalry Corps. General
  Allenby sent two battalions to Wytschaete and Voormezeele to be placed under
  the orders of General Gough, Commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, several attacks were directed against the
  Cavalry Corps and repulsed with loss to the enemy.</p>

  <p>On October 26 I directed General Allenby to endeavour to regain a more
  forward line, moving in conjunction with the 7th Division. But the latter
  being apparently quite unable to take the offensive, the attempt had to be
  abandoned.</p>

  <p>On October 30 heavy infantry attacks, supported by powerful artillery
  fire, developed against the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Divisions, especially against
  the trenches about Hollebeke held by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade. At 1.30 p.m.
  this Brigade was forced to retire, and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, less one
  regiment, was moved across from the 1st Cavalry Division to a point between
  Oostaveme and St. Eloi in support of the 2nd Cavalry Division.</p>

  <p>The 1st Cavalry Division in the neighbourhood of Messines was also
  threatened by a heavy infantry column.</p>

  <p>General Allenby still retained the two Indian
  Battalions of the 7th Indian Brigade, although they were in a somewhat
  exhausted condition.</p>

  <p>After a close survey of the positions and consultations with the General
  Officer Commanding the Cavalry Corps, I directed four battalions of the 2nd
  Corps, which had lately been relieved from the trenches by the Indian Corps,
  to move to Neuve Eglise under General Shaw, in support of General
  Allenby.</p>

  <p>The London Scottish Territorial Battalion was also sent to Neuve
  Eglise.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">*It was this village that, after three desperate charges,
  the distinguished Territorial regiment drove back the enemy with great
  loss.</p>

  <p>It now fell to the lot of the Cavalry Corps, which had been much weakened
  by constant fighting, to oppose the advance of two nearly fresh German Army
  Corps for a period of over forty-eight hours, pending the arrival of a French
  reinforcement. Their action was completely successful. I propose to send
  shortly a more detailed account of the operation.</p>

  <p>After the critical situation in front of the Cavalry Corps, which was
  ended by the arrival of the head of the French 16th Army Corps, the 2nd
  Cavalry Division was relieved by General Conneau's French Cavalry Corps and
  concentrated in the neighbourhood of Bailleul.</p>

  <p>The 1st Cavalry Division continued to hold the line of trenches east of
  Wulverghem.</p>

  <p>From that time to the date of this despatch the Cavalry Divisions have
  relieved one another at intervals, and have supported by their artillery the
  attacks made by the French throughout that period on Hollebeke, Wytschaete
  and Messines.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Corps in its position on the right of the Cavalry Corps continued
  throughout the same period to repel constant attacks against its front, and
  suffered severely from the enemy's heavy artillery fire.</p>

  <p>The artillery of the 4th Division constantly assisted the French in their
  attacks.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding 3rd Corps brings specially to my notice the
  excellent behaviour of the East Lancashire Regiment, the Hampshire Regiment,
  and the Somersetshire Light Infantry in these latter operations; and the
  skilful manner in which they were handled by General Hunter-Weston,
  Lieutenant- Colonel Butler, and the Battalion Commanders.</p>

  <p>The Lahore Division arrived in its concentration area in rear of the 2nd
  Corps on October 19 and 20.</p>

  <p>I have already referred to the excellent work performed by the battalions
  of this Division which were supporting the Cavalry. The remainder of the
  Division from the October 25 onwards were heavily engaged in assisting the
  7th Brigade of the 2nd Corps in fighting round Neuve Chapelle. Another
  Brigade took over some ground previously held by the French 1st Cavalry Corps
  and did excellent service.</p>

  <p>On October 28 especially the 47th Sikhs and the 20th and 21st Companies of
  the 3rd Sappers and Miners distinguished themselves by their gallant conduct
  in the attack on Neuve Chapelle, losing heavily in officers and men.</p>

  <p>After the arrival of the Meerut Division at Corps Headquarters the Indian
  Army Corps took over the line previously held by the 2nd Corps, which was
  then partially drawn back into reserve. Two and a half brigades of British
  Infantry and a large part of the Artillery of the 2nd Corps still remained to
  assist the Indian Corps in defence of this line. Two and a half battalions of
  these brigades were returned to the 2nd Corps when the Ferozepore Brigade
  joined the Indian Corps after its support of the Cavalry further north.</p>

  <p>The Secunderabad Cavalry Brigade arrived in the area during the 1st and
  2nd November, and the Jodhpur Lancers came about the same time. These were
  all temporarily attached to the Indian Corps.</p>

  <p>Up to the date of the present despatch the line held by the Indian Corps
  has been subjected to constant bombardment by the enemy's heavy artillery,
  followed up by infantry attacks.</p>

  <p>On two occasions these attacks were severe.</p>

  <p>On October 13 the 8th Gurkha Rifles of the Bareilly Brigade were driven
  from their trenches and on November 2 a serious attack was developed against
  a portion of the line west of Neuve Chapelle. On this occasion the line was
  to some extent pierced and was consequently slightly bent back.</p>

  <p>The situation was prevented from becoming serious by the excellent
  leadership displayed by Colonel Norie, of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles.</p>

  <p>Since their arrival in this country and their occupation of the line
  allotted to them, I have been much impressed by the initiative and resource
  displayed by the Indian troops. Some of the ruses they have employed to
  deceive the enemy have been attended with the best results and have doubtless
  kept superior forces in front of them at bay.</p>

  <p>The Corps of Indian Sappers and Miners have long enjoyed a high reputation
  for skill and resource. Without going into detail I can confidently assert
  that throughout their work in this campaign they have fully justified their
  reputation.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding the Indian Army Corps describes the conduct
  and bearing of these troops in strange and new surroundings to have been
  highly satisfactory, and I am enabled, from my own observation, fully to
  corroborate his statement.</p>

  <p>Honorary Major-General H.H. Sir Pratap Singh Bahadur, G.C.S.I., G.C.V.O.,
  K.C.B., A.D.C., Maharaja-Regent of Jodhpur; Honorary Lieutenant H.H. the
  Maharaja of Jodhpur; Honorary Colonel H.H. Sir Ganga Singh Bahadur, G.C.S.I.,
  G.C.I.E., A.D.C., Maharaja of Bikanir; Honorary Major H.H. Sir Madan Singh
  Bahadur, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Maharaja-Dhirai of Kishengarh; Honorary Captain
  the Honourable Malik Umar Hayat Khan, C.I.E., M.V.O., Tiwana; Honorary
  Lieutenant Raj-Kumar Hira Singh of Panna; Honorary Lieutenant Maharai-Kumar
  Hitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar; Lieutenant Malik Mumtaz Mahomed Khan, Native
  Indian Land Forces; Resaldar Khwaja Mahomed Khan Bahadur, Queen Victoria's
  Own Corps of Guides; Honorary Captain Shah Mirza Beg, are serving with the
  Indian contingents.</p>

  <p>While the whole of the line has continued to be heavily pressed, the
  enemy's principal efforts since November 1 have been concentrated upon
  breaking through the line held by the 1st British and 9th French Corps, and
  thus gaining possession of the town of Ypres.</p>

  <p>From November 2 onwards the 27th, the 15th, and parts of the Bavarian 13th
  and 2nd German Corps, besides other troops, were all directed against this
  northern line.</p>

  <p>About the 10th instant, after several units of these Corps had been
  completely shattered in futile attacks, a division of the Prussian Guard,
  which had been operating in the neighbourhood of Arras, was moved up to this
  area with great speed and secrecy. Documents found on dead officers prove
  that the Guard had received the Emperor's special commands to break through
  and succeed where their comrades of the line had failed.</p>

  <p>They took a leading part in the vigorous attacks made against the centre
  on the 11th and 12th; but, like their comrades, were repulsed with enormous
  loss.</p>

  <p>Throughout this trying period Sir Douglas Haig, ably assisted by his
  Divisional and Brigade Commanders, held the line with marvellous tenacity and
  undaunted courage.</p>

  <p>Words fail me to express the admiration I feel for their conduct, or my
  sense of the incalculable services they rendered. I venture to predict that
  their deeds during these days of stress and trial will furnish some of the
  most brilliant chapters which will be found in the military history of our
  time.</p>

  <p>The 1st Corps was brilliantly supported by the 3rd Cavalry Division under
  General Byng, Sir Douglas Haig has constantly brought this officer's eminent
  services to my notice. His troops were repeatedly called upon to restore the
  situation at critical points, and to fill gaps in the line caused by the
  tremendous losses which occurred.</p>

  <p>Both Corps and Cavalry Division Commanders particularly bring to my notice
  the name of Brigadier-General Kavanagh, Commanding the 7th Cavalry Brigade,
  not only for his skill but his personal bravery and dash. This was
  particularly noticeable when the 7th Cavalry Brigade was brought up to
  support the French troops when the latter were driven back near the village
  of Klein Zillebeke on the night of November 7. On this occasion I regret to
  say Colonel Gordon Wilson, Commanding the Royal Horse Guards, and Major the
  Hon. Hugh Dawnay, Commanding the 2nd Life Guards, were killed.</p>

  <p>In these two officers the Army has lost valuable cavalry leaders.</p>

  <p>Another officer whose name was particularly mentioned to me was that of
  Brigadier-General FitzClarence, V.C., Commanding the 1st Guards Brigade. He
  was, unfortunately, killed in the night attack of the 11th November. His loss
  will be severely felt.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Brigadier-General Charles FitzClarence, V.C., Commander
  of the Irish Guards before the outbreak of war. He won his V.C. in South
  Africa.</p>

  <p>The 1st Corps Commander informs me that on many occasions Brigadier-
  General the Earl of Cavan, Commanding the 4th Guards Brigade, was conspicuous
  for the skill, coolness, and courage with which he led his troops, and for
  the successful manner in which he dealt with many critical situations.</p>

  <p>I have more than once during this campaign brought forward the name of
  Major- General Bulfin to your Lordship's notice.* Up to the evening of
  November 2, when he was somewhat severely wounded, his services continued to
  be of great value.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Major-General Bulfin entered the army in 1885 and
  served in Burma and South Africa.</p>

  <p>On November 5 I despatched eleven battalions of the 2nd Corps, all
  considerably reduced in strength, to relieve the infantry of the 7th
  Division, which was then brought back into general reserve.</p>

  <p>Three more battalions of the same Corps, the London Scottish and
  Hertfordshire Battalions of Territorials, and the Somersetshire and
  Leicestershire Regiments of Yeomanry, were subsequently sent to reinforce the
  troops fighting to the east of Ypres.</p>

  <p>General Byng in the case of the Yeomanry Cavalry Regiments and Sir Douglas
  in that of the Territorial Battalions speak in high terms of their conduct in
  the field and of the value of their support.</p>

  <p>The battalions of the 2nd Corps took a conspicuous part in repulsing the
  heavy attacks delivered against this part of the line. I was obliged to
  dispatch them immediately after their trying experiences in the southern part
  of the line and when they had had a very insufficient period of rest; and,
  although they gallantly maintained these northern positions until relieved by
  the French, they were reduced to a condition of extreme exhaustion.</p>

  <p>The work performed by the Royal Flying Corps has continued to prove of the
  utmost value to the success of the operations.</p>

  <p>I do not consider it advisable in this despatch to go into any detail as
  regards the duties assigned to the Corps and the nature of their work, but
  almost every day new methods for employing them, both strategically and
  tactically, are discovered and put into practice.</p>

  <p>The development of their use and employment has indeed been quite
  extraordinary, and I feel sure that no effort should be spared to increase
  their numbers and perfect their equipment and efficiency.</p>

  <p>In the period covered by this despatch Territorial Troops have been used
  for the first time in the Army under my command.</p>

  <p>The units actually engaged have been the Northumberland, Northamptonshire,
  North Somerset, Leicestershire, and Oxfordshire Regiments of Yeomanry
  Cavalry; and the London Scottish, Hertfordshire, Honourable Artillery
  Company, and the Queen's Westminster Battalions of Territorial Infantry.</p>

  <p>The conduct and bearing of these units under fire, and the efficient
  manner in which they carried out the various duties assigned to them, have
  imbued me with the highest hope as to the value and help of Territorial
  Troops generally.</p>

  <p>Units which I have mentioned above, other than these, as having been also
  engaged, have by their conduct fully justified these hopes.</p>

  <p>Regiments and battalions as they arrive come into a temporary camp of
  instruction, which is formed at Headquarters, where they are closely
  inspected, their equipment examined, so far as possible perfected, and such
  instruction as can be given to them in the brief time available in the use of
  machine guns, etc., is imparted.</p>

  <p>Several units have now been sent up to the front besides those I have
  already named, but have not yet been engaged.</p>

  <p>I am anxious in this despatch to bring to your Lordship's special notice
  the splendid work which has been done throughout the campaign by the Cyclists
  of the Signal Corps.</p>

  <p>Carrying despatches and messages at all hours of the day and night in
  every kind of weather, and often traversing bad roads blocked with transport,
  they have been conspicuously successful in maintaining an extraordinary
  degree of efficiency in the service of communications.</p>

  <p>Many casualties have occurred in their ranks, but no amount of difficulty
  or danger has ever checked the energy and ardour which has distinguished
  their Corps throughout the operations.</p>

  <p>As I close this despatch there are signs in evidence that we are possibly
  in the last stages for the battle of Ypres-Armentières.</p>

  <p>For several days past the enemy artillery fire has considerably slackened,
  and infantry attack has practically ceased.</p>

  <p>In remarking upon the general military situation of the Allies as it
  appears to me at the present moment, it does not seem to be clearly
  understood that the operations in which we have been engaged embrace nearly
  all the Continent of Central Europe from East to West. The combined French,
  Belgian, and British Armies in the West and the Russian Army in the East are
  opposed to the united forces of Germany and Austria acting as a combined army
  between us.</p>

  <p>Our enemies elected at the commencement of the war to throw the weight of
  their forces against the armies in the West, and to detach only a
  comparatively weak force, composed of very few first-line troops and several
  corps of the second and third lines, to stem the Russian advance till the
  Western Forces could be completely defeated and overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Their strength enabled them from the outset to throw greatly superior
  forces against us in the West. This precluded any possibility of our taking a
  vigorous offensive, except when the miscalculations and mistakes made by
  their commanders opened up special opportunities for a successful attack and
  pursuit.</p>

  <p>The battle of the Marne was an example of this, as was also our advance
  from St. Omer and Hazebrouck to the line of the Lys at the commencement of
  this battle. The <i>rôle</i> which our Armies in the West have consequently
  been called upon to fulfil has been to occupy strong defensive positions,
  holding the ground gained and in inviting the enemy's attack; to throw these
  attacks back, causing the enemy heavy losses in his retreat and following him
  up with powerful and successful counter-attacks to complete his
  discomfiture.</p>

  <p>The value and significance of the <i>rôle</i> fulfilled since the
  commencement of hostilities by the Allied Forces in the West lies in the fact
  that at the moment when the Eastern Provinces of Germany are in imminent
  danger of being overrun by the numerous and powerful armies of Russia, nearly
  the whole of the active army of Germany is tied down to a line of trenches
  extending from the Fortress of Verdun on the Alsatian Frontier round to the
  sea at Nieuport, east of Dunkirk (a distance of 260 miles), where they are
  held, much reduced in numbers and <i>moral</i> by the successful action of
  our troops in the West.</p>

  <p>I cannot speak too highly of the valuable services rendered by the Royal
  Artillery throughout the battle.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that the enemy has brought up guns in support of his
  attacks of great range and shell power ours have succeeded throughout in
  preventing the enemy from establishing anything in the nature of an artillery
  superiority. The skill, courage, and energy displayed by their commanders
  have been very marked.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding 3rd Corps, who had special means of
  judging, makes mention of the splendid work performed by a number of young
  artillery officers, who in the most gallant manner pressed forward in the
  vicinity of the firing line in order that their guns may be able to shoot at
  the right targets at the right moment.</p>

  <p>The Royal Engineers have, as usual, been indefatigable in their efforts to
  assist the infantry in field fortification and trench work.</p>

  <p>I deeply regret the heavy casualties which we have suffered; but the
  nature of the fighting has been very desperate, and we have been assailed by
  vastly superior numbers. I have every reason to know that throughout the
  course of the battle we have placed at least three times as many of the enemy
  <i>hors de combat</i> in dead, wounded, and prisoners.</p>

  <p>Throughout these operations General Foch has strained his resources to the
  utmost to afford me all the support he could; and an expression of my warm
  gratitude is also due to General D'Urbal, Commanding the 8th French Army on
  my left and General Maud'huy, Commanding the 10th French Army on my
  right.</p>

  <p>I have many recommendations to bring to your Lordship's notice for gallant
  and distinguished service performed by officers and men in the period under
  report. These will be submitted shortly, as soon as they can be
  collected.</p>

  <p>I have the honour to be,</p>

  <p>Your Lordship's most obedient servant,<br>

  <p class="chaphead">The New Field of Battle&mdash;Typical Warfare&mdash;How
  the British Came North&mdash;How the Great Battle Began&mdash;Bridging the
  Dykes&mdash;How the Dorsets held Pont Fixe&mdash;A Murderous Battle in the
  Dark</p><br>

  <p class="first">IF you can picture a great stretch of land, flat and
  featureless, save in one or two remarkable exceptions, and in your
  imagination lay out upon this drab, unattractive country a number of bad
  roads, a light railway or two, along which in normal times a conveyance which
  is half tramcar and half railway train plies a leisured service; if you can
  imagine something of Holland, with great windmills, innumerable thrifty
  waterways, canals and minor rivers, with here and there a straggling village
  possessing a name which even Baedeker does not record, and small towns that
  were the scene in other days of remarkable and sanguinary combats; if you can
  imagine a certain squalor, a certain sordidness&mdash; when you are
  approaching the manufacturing and mining districts&mdash;and also a certain
  charm, you are imagining south- west Belgium, in which has been fought the
  great Battle for the Coast.</p>

  <p>Farther down, in the north of France, Arras and La Bassée played their
  parts, and played them worthily; but since for the moment our minds and our
  thoughts are concentrated upon the performances of our own Army, it will be
  well if we think only of the country west of the Yser, and that little strip
  of France which lies between Bethune, Hazebrouck, and the Belgian frontier.
  On these uninspiring fields, amidst gaunt hop poles and rotting beet fronds,
  in ugly little roads, by gaunt white farmhouses, most unlovely, in straggling
  copses and chilly plantations; in all the most unlikely settings has the
  heroism of the British Army been proved. In this war there are no longer
  battlefields; there are battle countries, and battle lines which stretch half
  across the Continent, which take in the waste and the wood, the town and the
  meadow, the river and the railway; but battlefields in Waterloo sense are of
  the past.</p>

  <p>Let us picture for ourselves one of those fights, the extraordinary
  character of which is peculiar only to this war. A great stretch of
  countryside, more undulating than usual, a hill covered with woods, a dim and
  blue background of trees and ridge, farmhouses dotted here and there,
  telegraph posts that stalk across the middle distance, a dilapidated railway
  with its rails twisted and wrecked, and its culverts shattered by dynamite, a
  row of humble cottages where the peasants have been living now a sand-bagged
  fort hastily painted a dull grey and streaked with green by the handiest of
  engineers; and nothing else on the face of the earth&mdash;no sign of life,
  of human being, of soldier or gun, transport or horse.</p>

  <p>Within hail there are perhaps 50,000 men. The aeroplane which comes
  buzzing overhead at a tremendous height can see what the observer on the
  ground could not detect&mdash;the long streaks of trenches where men stand to
  arms; the gun emplacements hidden by the boughs of trees; the rifle pits of
  the snipers; the defended farmhouses; the ditches and sunken roads packed
  with infantry pressed tight against the banks to avoid attracting the
  attention of the aerial observer. Seldom would it be possible for us to see
  without hearing, for all night long the guns have been booming on both sides,
  and the air has been filled with the whine of shells, rent with the crash of
  exploding shrapnel, fired, it may seem, carelessly, yet with good reason, for
  every shell is timed to burst above one of those scars in the surface of the
  earth, where men are waiting, deadly weapon in hand, ready to fling back the
  too daring attack of its enemy.</p>

  <p>German grey coats springing up from the earth rush across the fire zone,
  and are annihilated by the close fire which is poured upon their flank.</p>

  <p>For it is to the flank of the advancing infantry that the British soldier
  directs his attention, firing steadily by sections at the right- or left-hand
  man, and those who watch the German advance marvel as it whittles to the
  centre; its progress marked by a great broad arrow of dead and dying, the
  point towards the British trenches.</p>

  <p>Then comes a scramble of the British to the earth, the quick flash and
  thud of bayonets, the wild yell which invariably accompanies an infantry
  charge, the scattering of Germans who go blundering back to their trenches,
  the shrill whistle that recalls the infantry to a safer formation, and again
  both sides disappear into their trenches, and there is nothing to mark the
  failure save the dead that both sides have left on the field.</p>

  <p>You might tell of such a scene a hundred, a thousand times, and in very
  little different language describe almost every fight in which the British
  have been engaged. It is because of the sameness, the very monotony of
  heroism, that the historian will discover his greatest difficulty in dealing
  with this extraordinary campaign.</p>

  <p>In the middle of October you would have seen the British cavalry columns
  feeling their way cautiously toward Armentières. Day by day, the cavalry of
  the opposing masses were whirling and manoeuvring in the difficult country
  which lies to the north of the Lys. Day by day the British guns were
  searching every likely position before them, and driving out crowds of
  Germans hastily flung forward from Lille to cover the work which the German
  army, not yet in full force on this front, was carrying out. Very steadily
  the progress went on; you would have seen the convoys passing up the
  ill-paved roads from the coast towns; you would have seen the stained and
  weather-worn motor cars and motor transports; you would have met knots of
  soldiers, a mounted orderly or two, streams of refugees retiring from
  shell-swept villages, and perhaps now and again you might hear the far-off
  murmur of the guns. The army had already passed this way in the wake of the
  cautious cavalry, had shelled a village or two, had had its aerial scouts
  sweeping through the air at a dangerous level to discover the character of
  the resistance which might be expected.</p>

  <p>Eastward of Hazebrouck, the advancing British, in thickened formation, had
  come across the first serious opposition. Yet that also melted away, and
  these splendid columns went on. Each side was sparring for an opening,
  seeking for a battle front which the accident of war would reveal. North and
  south of the river Lys the British advance continued in the direction of
  Menin. Bad roads, intersecting waterways, canals, all the tiny arteries of
  commerce that feed town and village, that empty coalfields of their produce
  and bring merchandise in return; marsh and fen lands and treacherous bogs,
  all helped to make the progress a slow one. And there were many little
  clustering villages perched upon whatever rise of ground lifted the people of
  the countryside from the mist of the fens&mdash;points of vantage whence an
  enemy's artillery could concentrate its fire upon the advancing force.</p>

  <p>In recording such events as go to the making up of a history of such a war
  as this, there is always a danger that one's perspective may shift, and that
  vivid patches of colour may dazzle us from following the road, and cause us
  to stray into those splendid fields of individual heroism and accomplishment
  which so attract and entice the wayfarer. This instance of courage, that
  example of fortitude, lead us from left to right, to pause in amazement and
  pride before the wonder which brave men inspire.</p>

  <p>The scale of operations has been so extensive that were I to devote
  adequate space to dealing with detached events, scattered battles, and heroic
  deeds in the extensive field in which the Allies have been engaged, I should
  require several volumes. In this narrative I propose to gather up the threads
  of the story, to summarise into a connected whole the happenings and the
  great battles which have taken place from the date when operations on the
  Aisne came to a deadlock, to the middle of November, when the British Army,
  transferred from the region of the Aisne, had already for over a month in the
  north defied all efforts of the enemy to break through to Dunkirk and Calais.
  In this way I hope to give a broad view of the conflict. This summary will
  exhibit in a more definite form than would otherwise be possible the strategy
  pursued by Sir John French, the extraordinary cleverness of his plans, and
  the wonderful bravery of his troops in the face of formidable odds and
  amazing difficulties.</p>

  <p>The prolonged battle of Ypres-Armentières, as I have said, was a
  development of the continuous struggle which commenced on the Aisne after the
  great German retreat from Paris. The efforts of the Allies and the Germans
  alike were directed to attempting to outflank each other. There came a time
  on the Aisne when it seemed to Sir John French that he would be warranted in
  withdrawing the British Forces from the positions they then held, and he took
  counsel with General Joffre to that end.</p>

  <p>Field-Marshal French, with a large and cheerful army, growing somewhat
  impatient because of the block which the German had put upon further progress
  by his defence of the Aisne, importuned the French General to such good
  effect that one night the German watchers heard strange sounds from the
  British trenches. These they dismissed carelessly as a usual happening, for
  every night the men in the trenches were relieved by fresh troops, and that
  relief was not to be accomplished without a certain amount of noise. But in
  the morning, when the German aviators flew over the Allies' position, behold!
  the British were gone, so far as could be seen.</p>

  <p>It was no easy business to withdraw the British forces from their position
  on the Aisne and transfer them to new positions a long way off in Northern
  France and Flanders; when the nightly reliefs were carried out French
  territorials took their places in the British trenches and the British Army
  withdrew quietly by train and road to the field of operations. For many days
  the left flank of the Armies was in an exceedingly critical condition, and it
  is easy to see from the despatches how near the Germans were to establishing
  themselves on the northern coast of France.</p>

  <p>It was, as General French tells us, on October 3rd that Gough's Cavalry
  Division moved from Soissons, and passed northward to get upon the French
  left and begin a movement which was to outflank the German's right. It was
  not known at this moment how far the enemy was prepared to extend his line in
  order to cover his exposed flank; and perhaps it was not realised that he
  would move so immediately to mass troops in the threatened area. As likely as
  not&mdash;and time will prove the truth of this contention&mdash;the General
  Staff knew something of the intention of the German to move on Calais. At any
  rate, the German cavalry was dangerously near the main line which extends
  from Calais-Boulogne to Paris. There had been some raiding; a section of the
  line had been blown up; a culvert or two smashed, and naturally a certain
  number of reprisals, for the French cavalry are not wanting in enterprise or
  dash.</p>

  <p>Lille was known to be occupied by enemy troops. La Bassée, one of the
  strongest positions on the line, was equally well held. There were even
  reports that the enemy in strength lay somewhere between Lille and the coast,
  and Sir John French, in conjunction with General Joffre, made his plans with
  due caution, realising the possibility of an unpleasant set-back, and taking
  no risk of incurring disaster at the enemy's hands.</p>

  <p>Already the French line, in endeavouring to outflank the enemy, had
  extended practically up from Soissons to beyond Arras, when the English moved
  up to take their place upon the left of the French line. Sir John French took
  a margin of safety, and none too much as it proved, though he formed his line
  within a few miles of the coast. First to go was the 2nd Army Corps under Sir
  Horace Smith- Dorrien. This Corps, composed of some of the finest units in
  the British Army, was ordered to hold the line of a canal which runs between
  Bethune and Aire. Aire is a little south of St. Omer, and Bethune farther
  south- east.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Corps was due to take up its position on the 12th of October, and
  to the minute it arrived on that day. The cavalry which had been on the
  French left now came up in front of the 2nd Corps, clearing the ground of any
  stragglers, and keeping touch with the enemy, and took up its position on the
  left of Smith-Dorrien's Corps. In the meantime the 3rd Army Corps had trained
  up to St. Omer, and fell in so that its right touched the left of the 2nd
  Corps.</p>

  <p>Necessarily brief, almost laconic, Field-Marshal French conveys very
  little of the atmosphere of that trying period, nor does he greatly assist
  the earnest student of the war to realise the conditions under which those
  series of battles were fought by General Smith-Dorrien's Corps. We must draw
  very largely upon the excellent material which is supplied from time to time
  by "Eye- Witness."</p>

  <p>Here, however, since the narrative of "Eye-Witness" largely covers the
  ground which is also covered by Sir John French, it will only be necessary
  for us to take a few of the more striking illustrations which he gives of the
  conditions of the fighting and the methods by which our men met the dangers
  and hardships which came to them in the course of this new phase of the
  war.</p>

  <p>"Eye-Witness" pointed out that, although the struggle in the northern area
  naturally attracted more attention, fighting on the Aisne still continued,
  without any great change in the general situation. Save that the enemy had
  altered the position of some of his heavy artillery, to the discomfort of
  certain of our troops who hitherto had been immune from shell fire, and to
  the relief of others, who now found themselves in a position of comparative
  safety, there was little or no change. The withdrawal of the British had been
  so gradual that they were actually fighting on two fronts at the same time,
  the British cavalry being in touch with the enemy north of Arras before the
  British had fired their last shot upon the river Aisne.</p>

  <p>There were many things to remind our men that a great change had occurred
  and that a new phase of warfare had begun. The weather had grown suddenly
  cold and wet, and the summer campaign had ended with almost dramatic
  suddenness. We had left behind us, too, the open, almost rural, character of
  the fighting on our earlier battlefields, and were now engaged in a country
  which was not wholly unfamiliar, but which we had seen under totally
  different conditions. The British Army had come through the south of Belgium
  and the towns of northern France under a blazing sky, battling too hard,
  perhaps, to appreciate the beauties of the scene, but nevertheless
  experiencing subconsciously the comfort of the pleasant conditions under
  which they fought; now they came, mostly in cold and rain, into a land,
  which, though it was to some extent agricultural, was largely industrial.</p>

  <p>The plateaux and broad river valleys east of Paris were now memories. The
  British Army was fighting in an industrial region&mdash;the French Black
  Country, grimy cities and dull, drab villages, where stretches of fenland,
  and where the tall chimneys of mines&mdash;now smokeless and
  lifeless&mdash;and gaunt, high factories, and the long, sordid, ugly streets
  of the factory workers, supplied a touch of cheerlessness, which had been
  absent from the pleasant landscapes which the British had before known.</p>

  <p>Such of the country as was cultivated was very much like our own small
  holdings&mdash;considerably enclosed by ragged, untidy hedges, and a most
  difficult country for operations.</p>

  <p>The country near the coast is a reclaimed marshy tract, drained by
  innumerable canals and dykes. The whole district is gently undulating or
  quite flat, with one or two notable exceptions, to which reference will be
  made; and so obstructed by hedges and frequent belts of trees was the view
  that cavalry reconnaissances led to frequent surprises and close hand-to-hand
  fighting. To add to the difficulties of the British, most of the
  communications were bad. The roads, though straight, were narrow, with a
  strip of bad paving in the centre&mdash;a peculiar construction which is only
  to be found in the north of France and in Belgium&mdash;and the winding by-
  roads were more or less useless for military purposes.</p>

  <p>The British had come to a new country&mdash;a country which was chequered
  with enemy and friend. In some cases these small villages were held strongly
  by our opponent, and since he did not advertise the fact that he was lying in
  wait to receive the advance guards feeling a cautious way through the
  country, scouting was a matter of considerable danger, and contained all the
  elements of difficulty and surprise. Sometimes the advance-guard would be
  welcomed by a deputation of villagers who decked them with flowers and who
  hugged them and kissed them as they advanced, to their no small
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the contrary would happen, and the first intimation of the
  character of the reception would come in the shape of a rattle of musketry
  and the staccato note of a machine gun. Trenches would be cut across the
  road, gun emplacements, cunningly concealed under green boughs, would
  threaten all advance, and only by a continuous shelling and a determined
  advance with the bayonet could the village be cleared.</p>

  <p>Too frequently the Allies' advance was marked by scenes of desolation.
  Many once prosperous homesteads and hamlets were literally tom to pieces; the
  walls still standing, pitted by shrapnel balls, and in some of the villages
  the churches were smouldering ruins. Dead horses, cows, and pigs, which had
  been caught in the hail of shrapnel, littered the village streets, and among
  the carcases and <i>débris</i> wandered the wretched inhabitants, who had
  returned to see what they could save from the wreckage. Here, blocking up a
  narrow side street, was a dead horse still harnessed to a trap; beside it
  stretched the corpse of a Jaeger (German Light Infantry). Close by, in an
  enclosure where a shell had found them, lay thirty cavalry horses; a little
  further on was laid out a row of German dead for whom graves were being dug
  by the peasants.</p>

  <p>The work of burial fell to a great extent on the inhabitants, who took
  pains in marking the last resting place of their countrymen, either by little
  wooden crosses or else by flowers.</p>

  <p>Amidst the graves scattered all over the countryside were the rifle pits,
  trenches, and gun emplacements which those now resting below the sod helped
  to defend or to attack. From these the progress of the fighting could be
  traced, and even its nature; for they varied from carefully constructed and
  cunningly placed works, to the hastily shaped lair of a German sniper; or the
  roadside ditch with its side scooped out by the entrenching implements of our
  infantry.</p>

  <p>At this time it was very clear that the German was superior in strength to
  the attacker, and it says much for the personal ascendency that the British
  soldier had established over his enemy that from the moment Sir Horace Smith-
  Dorrien's Corps advanced, no whole-hearted counter-attack, though by superior
  force, was successfully made. Counter-attacks and the heavy weight of German
  opposition were felt on all parts of the line, but until we had reached those
  positions which it would have been impossible to have taken without a great
  loss of life, and without incurring the risk of defeat, the advance of the
  British was not seriously checked. Even operating from the prepared
  positions, the German did not succeed in thrusting back the 2nd Army Corps to
  the coast.</p>

  <p>It is probable that at this time the Generalissimo of the German forces
  was throwing troops northward with feverish activity, in the hope of opposing
  what was at that moment thought to be the extreme left of the Anglo-French
  line with an overwhelming force; but, as we shall see, they only arrived to
  discover that the enveloping movement had shifted farther north, and the
  troops they had intended to concentrate at one point for a final determined
  effort to break through, were needed to hold back the turning operations
  still farther on their right.</p>

  <p>In these operations of the British the greatest heroism was displayed.
  Once more the British artillery showed their desperate courage no less than
  their good marksmanship. The infantry surpassed themselves in valour, and Sir
  Horace Smith-Dorrien was only able to accomplish the very difficult
  operations which were entrusted to him through the individual bravery of his
  men.</p>

  <p>The great battle of the north of France, so far as the British were
  concerned, began when the 2nd Cavalry Division, moving along to the north of
  the Bethune canal, came into touch with the enemy's cavalry, which was then
  holding some woods to the north. In the misty light of dawn the dark bodies
  of horsemen moved up through the smoking countryside, and amidst the thin
  plantations the British cavalry swept forward, flinging back in confusion the
  massed Uhlans who opposed their passage.</p>

  <p>The woods were cleared of the enemy, and joining hands with the divisional
  cavalry which had come up from Hazebrouck, General Gough went still further
  forward to reconnoitre the position. General Smith-Dorrien, who had orders to
  sweep forward and force in the flank of the enemy, was already on the move;
  and on the same night that the woods were cleared, the 2nd Cavalry closed on
  the 2nd Army Corps which was passing slowly toward Lille.</p>

  <p>Smart as had been the work which General Joffre gave the British, the
  enemy had been sharper. He had at his disposal a whole network of strategic
  railways, with the centre at Laon, and division after division was hastily
  entrained and sent northward to meet the new danger.</p>

  <p>The opposition upon the front of the 2nd Army Corps became more and more
  marked. Smith-Dorrien, who had anticipated a fairly easy movement as far as
  Merville, found himself with a pitched battle on his hands, able to make
  little or no progress.</p>

  <p>He was endeavouring to pivot on Givenchy to get astride of the La Bassée-
  Lille road. The strength of the reinforcements which had come to Lille was
  unknown. It was, however, clear that La Bassée was amply garrisoned, and that
  the enemy lay between La Bassée and Lille in large numbers, and that he did
  not entirely depend upon the Lille fortifications, but had constructed
  emplacements and field works covering the left between Lille and La Bassée.
  So firmly established were the Germans at La Bassée that they defied all
  efforts to remove them, either by the British or French.</p>

  <p>The line was not yet established, but on La Bassée the German had
  concentrated a force which enable him to defy every effort to dislodge him.
  Entrenched on rising ground, his guns well concealed and placed so that often
  it was almost impossible to locate them, French and British alike tried in
  vain to move him from his stronghold. North and south we were able to make
  some progress, but never such as would threaten his security, and indeed it
  was not until after the Battle for the Coast had all but finished that the
  French, by a most heroic charge and an assault which was made with a great
  sacrifice of life, succeeded in establishing themselves in a position which
  to some extent gave them a dominating foothold.</p>

  <p>The country was of a most difficult character. Here, in the Pas de Calais,
  which is practically the Black Country of France, coal mines&mdash;some of
  the largest in the world&mdash;manufactories, huge conversion plants, hamper
  all progress, and the country is intersected by innumerable canals and
  waterways. Add to this the physical character of the country about Lens and
  Bethune, Lille and the neighbouring towns&mdash;flat land with scarcely a
  tree to break the monotony of the landscape, land infinitely unsuitable for
  artillery work and scarcely habitable when entrenchments are made.</p>

  <p>There is small doubt that the British Commander did not at first fully
  realise the extent of the task which had been set him, and every day, and
  almost every hour, revealed the impossibility of forcing a way past Lille
  without a very much stronger force than he possessed.</p>

  <p>Upon the 3rd Division of the British 2nd Corps fell the brunt of the first
  few days* fighting. The men carried planks in order to bridge the narrow
  dykes which cut up the whole of the front. It was a case of fighting their
  way from position to position, and from entrenchment to entrenchment, driving
  the enemy fifty or sixty yards at a time. It was now that the Dorsets
  displayed singular heroism, losing the greater portion of the battalion and
  most of the officers, including the Commanding Officer, Major Roper. They had
  established themselves at Pont Fixe, one of the small but important bridge
  heads which offered some tactical advantage; and though they were assailed by
  clouds of German infantry and were battered from morning till night by the
  concentrated fire of all the German batteries, the Dorsets stood their
  ground, losing 130 killed.</p>

  <p>Along the line which the 3rd Division occupied, the thunder of guns, the
  rattle of musketry, and the quick rushes of khaki-clad infantry across the
  sodden ground told of the fury of the attack. The enemy, bringing up their
  guns, made a desperate attempt to move the Dorsets, and the shrapnel burst
  over the hastily entrenched troops throughout a long day. No attempt on the
  part of the infantry to the left and right of the Dorsets could draw the
  attention of the enemy from a position which, rightly or wrongly, he regarded
  as being one which it was essential he should take and hold.</p>

  <p>The Dorsets' counter-attack kept their front clear. Hastily digging
  themselves in, they formed at the shortest notice trenches from which,
  shallow as they were, the German failed to dislodge them, though he sent
  regiment after regiment to the task and preceded each charge with a
  desperate, nerve-rending cannonading.</p>

  <p>It was one of those innumerable incidents which have glorified the war, of
  a British force, faithful to its traditions, and confident in its powers,
  holding back a superior force. Every step of the advance had to be paid for.
  Through little villages, broken and shattered so that it was impossible to
  tell the very topography of the place without a map, the Germans retired,
  firing the houses as he went, smashing the roads with his dynamite
  cartridges, and casting his firebrands left and right in a very orgy of
  destruction.</p>

  <p>The Germans covered the bridge head with a great barricade of wood, loop-
  holed at the bottom so that men could fire from a lying position. Against
  this the advanced cavalry could make no progress. It was impossible to bring
  artillery into action on that narrow front; but, unharnessing the horses,
  willing hands dragged a gun forward until it was in an advantageous position,
  and then, training it upon the high palisade, sent shell after shell crashing
  into the obstruction.</p>

  <p>It was dark now, and they were in the narrow danger of a town, with little
  to guide them save such local help as they could procure; but the business in
  hand was too serious to wait for daylight, and the intrepid cavalry
  dismounted and, acting as infantry, moved cautiously forward from street
  corner to street corner, firing steadily at every shadowy figure that crossed
  the street. They flocked into the byways of the town, and more by instinct
  than judgment kept some sort of rough line as they surged forward, seeking
  their enemy. They came to the centre of the town, the great place, or market
  square, with very little resistance, but scarcely had the advance guard of
  the British reached this great darkened void when one of the houses exploded
  in a sheet of flame, and a shower of star shells made the place as light as
  day. Then, as at a signal, every building in the place belched flame. From
  windows, from doors, from roofs, the stabbing pencils of light came
  flickering down toward the heroic attacker, and the cobble-stones of the
  market place were splattered with British blood. Machine gun and rifle beat a
  ceaseless tattoo upon the paved place, and yet the cavalry who had carried
  out this heroic reconnaissance were able to extricate themselves with a loss
  of only one officer wounded, and nine men killed and wounded.</p>

  <p>Retreating before this hail of fire, the men called a little council of
  war, determining to rescue their comrades whom they had left behind from the
  tender mercy of the enemy. A number of them, removing their boots and
  puttees, stole* back in their stockinged feet, lifted their fallen friends,
  and bore them to safety under the very noses of the German troops.</p>

  <p>The left made greater progress, and found itself on the 16th before the
  village of Aubers. This tiny little hamlet had been converted into a
  formidable position by the enemy, and throughout the day a ding-dong battle
  went on, which bore no result until, on the 17th October, the 9th Infantry
  Brigade rushed the village at the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>On another section of the line the village of Herlies had been holding out
  against a combined attack by the 7th Royal Fusiliers and the Lincolnshire
  Regiment. The British held a position which enabled them to pour their fire
  into the village, but which rendered any attempt to advance nearer to their
  objective a matter of considerable danger, for between the British trenches
  and the village defences was a clear stretch of ground, affording no cover
  whatever and rendering any attempt at shock tactics foredoomed to
  annihilation. As it was more and more evident that this village must be
  taken, Brigadier-General Shaw decided upon taking the desperate step of
  charging the enemy's position in the dark and endeavouring to turn him out at
  the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>Only those who have had experience of warfare and who know the risk of
  such a movement can appreciate the daring and the extraordinary character of
  such an operation. Night fell and the moon had not risen, when the Lincolns
  and the 7th Fusiliers moved quietly out of their trenches and formed up upon
  the ground which was still being swept by shell and rifle fire.</p>

  <p>Very silently, under the lead of their company officers, the two
  battalions stole forward without a sound, making no reply to the rifle fire
  which was poured into them. At a distance of fifty yards the men fixed their
  bayonets, and with a wild yell the two battalions crashed through the barbed-
  wire entanglements into the enemy's trenches, and in ten minutes after the
  first impact the position was taken with scarcely a shot fired from the
  British side. So dark was it, as one of those who took part in the charge
  subsequently narrated, that some of the men removed their bayonets, and slung
  their rifles, using the long, sharp blade as a dagger, and groping blindly
  with the left hand to feel the heads of the men they were going to kill.</p>

  <p>In the dark this murderous fight went on through the barbed wire; in the
  dank pits men struggled desperately hand-to-hand, neither asking nor giving
  quarter. How long that fight lasted, that first shocking grappling of men,
  none can agree, but in the end the 7th and the Lincolns triumphed, driving
  their enemy before them in full retreat and occupying by night the village
  which had been impregnable in the day.</p>

  <p>At this time it did not seem that the German was prepared to make anything
  in the nature of a big stand, and the canal which connects the Yser with
  Ypres and the Lys was safely crossed and the enemy driven back, so that his
  right rested on the village of Becelaere. Thereafter came fighting of a
  fierce and determined character. The British must have found no good foothold
  so far north, and we find them back again south and west of the canal, near
  the four cross roads of Messines. Messines was a good position on rising
  ground, and a village to be fought for. When the aviators and the cavalry
  scouts and the infantry reconnaissances had done their work, it was clear
  that Messines was the safest of the forward positions. There had been a
  constant drizzle of war over this country; shattered homesteads, burning
  farms, gaunt walls standing where happy homes had been, a dead horse or two
  on one side of the road, and a dead man or two on the other, spasmodic bursts
  of inquiring shrapnel, a monotonous "klick-klock" of Mauser rifles&mdash;all
  these are normal sounds to which infantry march and counter-march, dig and
  delve great trenches in the yellow earth, and go weaving shelter places,
  whistling all the time as though these bursting steel cases, the pieces of
  which come whizzing about their ears, were so much wind amongst the sheets on
  a laundry drying ground.</p>

  <p>You may have had that experience&mdash;a high wind and the flip-flap,
  incessant and menacing, of drying linen. Magnify that a million times, make
  the flapping so loud as to deafen you and so continuous that you scarcely can
  tell where the thunder of one explosion ends and the other begins, and you
  have the noise of battle as it develops.</p>

  <p>No sign of life save that which the yellow lines of trenches indicate;
  only a curious blue haze in the far distance, and the "frick-kkkk-kkkk!" of
  an aeroplane speeding overhead; and, in some miraculous fashion, audible even
  above this incessant pandemonium of sound.</p>

  <p>Or imagine a great storm with lightning darting down to left and right,
  with terrific and monstrous crashes of thunder that shake the very earth.
  Picture yourself cringing before this infernal attack. You may gauge
  something of the feeling of men who come up to the trenches and fill them.
  More men will come in the face of heavy fire, and disappear into the earth;
  yet more men, deploying left and right, going to work methodically with their
  spades, they too will vanish; and more and more and more, till the whole of
  the country side is scarred and seamed with tiny trenches like yellow streaks
  from a painter's brush. And the great arc of bursting shell spreads outwards
  to the wings, as the German brings battery after battery into action to check
  the danger before him.</p>

  <p>Now both sides have seen where the attack is going to be developed. Both
  generals are equally aware of the value of Messines. One will hold it,
  another will take it. A new note, a crushing and a booming from the British
  rear, the guns have come into action; they seem to be firing all at once, as
  at some preconcerted signal. These, too, are grouping their fire, and four,
  five, ten little white puff-balls burst almost within a dozen yards of one
  another.</p>

  <p>Battery after battery has come into action until it seems as though the
  supply of guns on both sides is inexhaustible. For hour after hour shrapnel
  breaks over the field&mdash;day and night, night and day.</p>

  <p>The shelling was indeed beyond all experience. The volume of sound, the
  crashing, deafening terrorising character of the explosions were paralysing.
  "Men came out of the trenches incoherent," said an officer in a letter which
  was published. Yet they did not come out until they were relieved. They stood
  this racket in tense silence, every nerve strained, every sense alert, and
  yet with a paralysed sense of values. An eminent psychologist said that it
  was impossible to exaggerate the monstrous horror of the shell fire. "The
  noises were even more distressing to me than the risk of death. It was
  terrifying in its tumult. One could see the sudden flashes from some of the
  enemy's guns, and a loud and unceasing roar came from them with regular rolls
  of thunderous noise, interrupted by sudden and terrific shocks, which shot up
  into one's brain and shook one's body with a kind of disintegrating tumult.
  Courage is annihilated in the face of it. Something else takes its
  place&mdash;a philosophy of fatalism, sometimes an utter boredom with the way
  in which death plays the fool with men, threatening but failing to kill; in
  most cases a strange extinction of all emotions and sensations, so that men
  who have been long under shell fire have a peculiar rigidity of the nervous
  system, as if something had been killed inside them, though outwardly they
  are still alive and untouched."</p>

  Daring Decision&mdash;The Memorable Battle for Ypres.</p><br>

  <p>The full weight of the German attack was now massed against the British
  line. To each corps which General French put into the field the German was
  opposing four, and in front of the 2nd Corps alone were the 2nd, 4th, 7th,
  and 9th German Cavalry Divisions, six battalions of Jaegers, and the 14th
  Army Corps. With such opposition it would have been understandable had the
  2nd Corps fallen back before the vigorous counter-attacks which were
  delivered against them; but it stands everlastingly to the glory of British
  arms that each of these attacks was repulsed with heavy loss, and the ground
  gained by the British was held despite the most violent efforts of the enemy
  to regain it.</p>

  <p>The advance of the line was not an even one. There were advantages gained
  and positions lost. Heroic endeavour was crowned with success only to suffer
  defeat in the hour of triumph. The Royal Irish Rifles, after a most gallant
  fight, carried the village of Le Pilly, on October 19th, which they held and
  entrenched, beating off a succession of attacks designed to drive them
  westward.</p>

  <p>The Royal Irish held only one portion of the line thus formed, and from
  the very start it was seen that their position was a precarious one.
  Nevertheless, with a courage beyond all praise, these men, who saw their
  danger and knew the risks they were taking, held on to their trench line. A
  wide expanse of broken ground was before them, hamlet and farm buildings gave
  cover to their enemy, from one little wood to their right front the batteries
  of the enemy poured an unceasing fire upon the devoted battalion. There was
  never any question of their attempting to escape from the inferno in which
  they found themselves. It was a case, for the Royal Irish, of holding on to
  the last, and even when they saw the rest of the line falling back, they
  themselves, maintaining their position in the face of what looked to be
  certain destruction, gave back shot for shot.</p>

  <p>The enemy worked left and right of them, amazed that these men should
  still resist when they knew, as they must have known, that resistance was
  useless. Enfiladed to left and right, fired at from both flanks and from the
  rear, the Royal Irish stuck to their position until resistance at last was
  suicidal. They were surrounded and cut off, suffering heavy loss.</p>

  <p>So far from diminishing in violence, the German attacks increased, and
  there were moments when it seemed as if nothing could stay the almost
  irresistible rush of the German infantry. Our 5th Division were opposed in
  the village of Violaines by a corps of the enemy reinforced by a further
  division, and after a most heroic defence were thrown back. The enemy
  debouched from the village, satisfied that the resistance was at an end, with
  shattered forces falling back left and right before them and the British dead
  testifying to the success of the German attack. Then of a sudden they
  received a check which was entirely unexpected. The Worcester Regiment and
  the Manchester Regiment had been hurried up in support, and now the German
  came upon two battalions which had already distinguished themselves in the
  war, and which, strengthened rather than weakened by their losses, were
  perhaps the most formidable troops on the ground.</p>

  <p>In vain the German division threw itself at the barring line. It did not
  waver, but standing firm, shot back the opposition with cool judgment. Then,
  taking the offensive, these two fine corps moved forward, driving a
  vanquished enemy before them, and the position which had been lost a few
  hours before was regained, whilst yet the German general was congratulating
  himself upon his triumph.</p>

  <p>Once more the campaign resolved itself into trench warfare. The
  disappointment of our soldiers can readily be imagined. They had come north
  in the joyous expectation of having finished for the time with trenches and
  of pushing their way through to the open fighting dear to their hearts. They
  were quickly undeceived. In this new theatre of war they found that trench
  warfare was still to be their lot. They had merely exchanged the trenches of
  the Aisne for the trenches of the Pas de Calais.</p>

  <p>Very cheerfully, though, they went to work, dug themselves in once more,
  and from the 19th to the 31st of October, the 2nd Corps hurled back attack
  after attack of the German hordes opposed to them. Picture life as the men in
  the trenches found it: a great slit in the grey-brown clay, three feet broad
  and three feet deep, banked up on each side with soil and earth and such turf
  as there was left, with holes cut in the front wall, with pillars on either
  side. In these holes cut in the clay the men slept on straw where they could
  get it, on waterproof sheeting where they could not. Every dozen feet or so a
  traverse ran, banked high lest the enemy attempt to enfilade the trench.</p>

  <p>The British soldiers entered into their new habitations with a wealth of
  knowledge which they had acquired on the Aisne. Some of them smuggled in
  little spirit stoves, mysterious little wooden boxes were found on which a
  man could sit, undreamt of comfort appeared as if by magic. In these trenches
  the men had to live, often under a terrific fire. They were well supplied
  with food and twice a week a tot of rum was ladled out to them.</p>

  <p>Behind the firing-line trenches were found the shelters for the men
  holding the line and those for the supports. These were more elaborate and
  comfortable than the fire trenches, usually were roofed over, and contained
  cooking places and many conveniences. Some of these underground quarters were
  almost luxurious and contained windows. Communication between the firing line
  and the various shelters in rear and with the headquarters of units was kept
  up along approach trenches, all zig-zagged to prevent being enfiladed, and
  liberally partitioned into compartments by traverses so as to localise the
  effect of shell fire.</p>

  <p>For some time the character of the artillery fire was such as to force
  both combatants even for some distance behind the firing line to burrow into
  the earth in order to obtain shelter and to conceal their works as far as
  possible, thus to gain protection both from guns and aeroplanes.</p>

  <p>This was carried on to such an extent that behind the front-fire trenches
  of British, French, and Germans are perfect labyrinths of burrows of various
  types. The principal feature of the battlefield, therefore, as "Eye-Witness"
  pointed out, was the absence of any signs of human beings.</p>

  <p>Where resort was had to siege methods, the earthworks of both sides became
  still more complicated, though there was a definite system underlying their
  apparent confusion. It is permissible to describe how the enemy was carrying
  on the close attack at some points.</p>

  <p>From the last position attained they sapped forward in two ways already
  mentioned. The approaches were excavated by pioneers working at the head, the
  German pioneers being technically trained troops which correspond to our
  sappers. Owing to the close range at which the fighting was conducted and the
  fact that rifles fixed in rests and machine guns were kept permanently
  directed upon the crest of the trenches, observation was somewhat difficult,
  but the "head" or end of the approaching sap could be detected from the mound
  of earth which was thrown up. This could not be done, however, where the
  advance was being conducted by a "blinded" sap. In executing this type of sap
  a horizontal borehole about a foot in diameter and some three or four feet
  below ground was bored by means of a special earth borer worked by hand. It
  was then enlarged by pick and shovel into a small tunnel, whose roof was one
  or two feet below the surface.</p>

  <p>Several of these saps having been driven forward, their heads were
  connected by a lateral trench, which became the front line and could be used
  for stormers to collect for an assault. In some cases, usually at night, a
  sap was driven right up to the parapet of the hostile trench, which was then
  blown in by a charge. Amidst the confusion caused, and a shower of grenades,
  the stormers attempted to burst in through the opening and work along the
  trench. As in their ordinary infantry attacks, machine guns were quickly
  brought up to any point gained in order to repel counter-attacks.</p>

  <p>Most of this fighting took place at such close range that the guns of
  either side could fire at the enemy's infantry without great risk of hitting
  its own men. The role of artillery projectiles, however, was well played by
  bombs of all descriptions, which are used in prodigious quantities.</p>

  <p>The larger ones projected by the "Minenwerfer," of which the Germans
  employ three sizes, corresponded to the heavy howitzer shell of the distant
  combat, and have much the same effect. They had a distinctive nickname of
  their own, but they may be termed the "Jack Johnsons" of the close attack of
  siege warfare.</p>

  <p>The smaller bombs or grenades were thrown by hand from a few yards'
  distance, perhaps just lobbed over a parapet. They were charged with high
  explosive, and detonated with great violence; and, since their impetus does
  not cause them to bury themselves in the earth before they detonate, their
  action, though local, is very unpleasant in the enclosed space between two
  traverses in a trench. These grenades of various types were being thrown
  continuously by both sides, every assault being preluded and accompanied by
  showers of them. In fact, the wholesale use of these murderous missiles was
  one of the most prominent features of the close attack.</p>

  <p>Under conditions which to the Briton at home must seem appalling, these
  cheery fellows of ours lived in their trenches, repelling at all hours of the
  day and night the unexpected attacks which came upon them, and living with
  their dead and their wounded when the fire was so hot that the ambulance men
  found it impossible to come up by daylight to relieve the men of their
  terrible burdens.</p>

  <p>On October 24th, new and welcome reinforcements came to the British in the
  shape of the Lahore division of the Indian Army Corps. These were put in and
  did most excellent work. Full of fun as our soldiers were, there were
  tragedies about which men spoke in low voices, tragedies outside of the
  ordinary risk of war. Once a regiment held a line of trenches when two other
  corps, one on either side, had retired. Nothing daunted, the gallant men held
  on throughout the day with all its officers killed save two second
  lieutenants, and then, to add to the horror of the situation&mdash;they were
  being fired on from three sides&mdash; the British artillery, thinking that
  their trenches also had been abandoned and were in the occupation of the
  enemy, opened an appalling artillery fire upon the infantry. For twenty
  minutes they endured this, until one gallant fellow of the regiment made his
  way back under heavy fire, and conveyed to the officer commanding the
  artillery the truth of the situation.</p>

  <p>In spite of all they had suffered, the regiment held on for another twelve
  hours, when it was relieved and brought back into the reserves with a loss of
  400 killed and wounded.</p>

  <p>All this time the fighting went on in the neighbourhood of La Bassée and
  to a point south-east of St. Omer, and developed with extreme ferocity in
  some parts of the field, so that even a crack corps like the Gordon
  Highlanders was driven out of its trenches, which were retaken by the
  Middlesex Regiment. It was give and take all along the line. On the British
  left was a French corps, and on their left, as has been stated, the 3rd
  British Army Corps, which had detrained at St. Omer and had begun its move
  toward Armentières. The 3rd Corps in rain and in fog pursued a remorseless
  course, pushing on to Bailleul and attacking and holding the line of the Lys
  from Armentières to Sailly. Gradually the British line was moving northward
  and westward. The cavalry reconnaissances along the banks of the Lys had been
  successful, and now it seemed that the 4th Corps which had been engaged in
  covering the retirement of the Belgian Army from Antwerp, might be
  successfully employed in carrying out the original objective of the British
  force, namely, turning inward and backward the German line.</p>

  <p>It was with this object that not only the British force but the French
  reinforcements had come northward; it was this object which had induced the
  advance from Bethune towards La Bassée and to Armentières; but the plan had
  failed, because the German, working with the advantage of his interior lines,
  had massed troops at every point where the British appeared.</p>

  <p>It seemed just possible, however, that the 4th Corps would accomplish that
  which the others had failed, through no fault of their own, to achieve.</p>

  <p>And here it may be permissible to sketch briefly the events which had
  brought the 4th Corps into existence.</p>

  <p>Only a few days before General French had begun his move, the objective of
  the new German forces gathering in Belgium became apparent. Antwerp was to be
  taken, and the menace to the German right for ever removed, in preparation
  for an advance upon the coast and the cutting of the British lines of
  communication which connected our Army in the field with their true base.</p>

  <p>The need for moving rapidly and for advancing this line from Soissons up
  to the coast became every day more urgent. The day that General French moved,
  the Belgians had retired across the Nethe, blowing up the Waelhen Bridge, and
  the British Admiralty and War Office, recognising that it was imperative for
  the safety of the Anglo-French lines that the German should be kept out of
  Antwerp as long as possible, collected together a scratch force of naval
  reservists and marines, and put them across the Channel as fast as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Already there had been an advance guard of Marines at Ostend, and these
  with their reinforcements moved up to Antwerp, the first party arriving on
  the 4th. The British plan of campaign, as I have said, was to delay as long
  as possible the fall of Antwerp, which would release a very large German army
  to operate against the rapidly extending Anglo-French lines. Remembering that
  our men in this field were only partly trained, and that they were engaged in
  holding at bay an army which probably consisted of 120,000 men, the
  seriousness of the task before them cannot be over-estimated, nor can either
  the foresight of the British Government or the valour of the men who carried
  the Government's plan into execution.</p>

  <p>It was a move made with the full approval not only of the War Office but
  of the active chiefs of Armies in the field. It was indeed a very important
  and a very necessary move, and one which contributed largely to the successes
  which the British were subsequently able to achieve.</p>

  <p>The German object was not only to capture Antwerp but effectively to
  contain and surround its garrison. The British were there to afford the
  Belgian Army a safe exit, to hold up the German advance, and to give the
  Belgian the relief which would allow him to resist the repeated attempt of
  the enemy to break across the Scheldt with the object of cutting off the road
  to the coast and to safety.</p>

  <p>The British, as we have seen, were pressing north with all haste from the
  Aisne, passing the rear of the line where the French on the Oise were engaged
  in violent battle. Those were fateful days for the Anglo-French force. More
  fateful, indeed, for the Belgian Army, which was beginning its evacuation of
  Antwerp. To assist in this General French formed a 4th Army Corps with a base
  at Dunkirk, consisting of the 7th Division and a division of cavalry. The
  task allotted to this scratch corps was to assist in covering the Belgian
  retirement. Though a large portion of the Belgian Army and 2,000 British
  marines and sailors, by a deplorable error, passed into Holland and were
  promptly interned, the retirement was carried out in safety.</p>

  <p>Sent to the aid of the Naval Division at Antwerp, the 7th Division and the
  3rd Cavalry Division did splendid work from the time they were landed early
  in October. They found themselves faced with a most serious and critical
  situation, the enemy largely outnumbering them. Compelled to retire, from
  Ghent to Ypres they fought a rearguard action with such tenacity and valour
  that it covers them with glory.</p>

  <p>Through day and night, continually pursued by the far superior forces of
  the enemy, they held doggedly to position after position, and eventually at
  their final stand before Ypres it fell to them to hold off the German Army
  for several days, while the British forces were being hurried up from the
  Aisne. They held on, though the odds against them were nearly ten to one.
  When at length they were withdrawn from the firing line to rest and re-fit,
  in the infantry there were only 44 officers left out of the 400 who set out
  from England, and 2,336 men out of their original number of 12,000. A special
  order by General Sir Douglas Haig marked their glorious achievement.</p>

  <p>"In forwarding the attached order by G.O.C. 1st Corps, I desire to place
  on record my own high appreciation of the endurance and fine soldierly
  qualities exhibited by all ranks of the 7th Division from the time of their
  landing in Belgium. You have been called to take a conspicuous part in one of
  the severest struggles in the history of the war, and you have had the honour
  and distinction of contributing in no small measure to the success of our
  arms and the defeat of the enemy's plans.</p>

  <p>"The task which fell to your share inevitably involved heavy losses, but
  you have at any rate the satisfaction of knowing that the losses you have
  inflicted upon the enemy have been far heavier.</p>

  <p>"The 7th Division have gained for themselves a reputation for stubborn
  valour and endurance in defence, and I am certain that you will only add to
  your laurels when the opportunity of advancing to the attack is given
  you."</p>

  <p>The fall of Antwerp was inevitable when the German succeeded in battering
  to silence one of the greater forts which commanded the passage of the Nethe.
  But by the time the triumphant enemy marched into the streets of the town,
  the extending line had reached beyond Arras, and the British Army was forming
  up to protect Calais from the invader.</p>

  <p>Who began this race northward, which started on the Aisne on October 4th,
  and continued in an incessant, violent and terrible battle until it reached
  its climax on the sand dunes of Belgium?</p>

  <p>Many are the explanations which will be offered, and many are the claims
  which will be put forward on behalf of either side, but to the outsider,
  watching these tragic and terrible events from a distance, it would seem that
  the line northward was an accident. It was a line, extended slowly at first,
  to prevent the envelopment of the German right, and it progressed with such
  fury, and gained so in importance, that the whole battle front was shifted,
  and what had been the German right became the German left, so far as the
  Allied Armies which were working in the wrest of France were concerned.</p>

  <p>Who shall say how this great idea of Calais and its capture came to be
  part of the German general scheme? Who invented the phrase "To Calais!" as a
  poor substitute for the cry "To Paris!"?</p>

  <p>Was it perhaps in order to give to the dispirited people of Germany some
  hope which had a reasonable chance of realisation, that Calais, with its
  empty and barren possibilities, should be offered as a goal?</p>

  <p>To the strategist it will always seem, whatever may be the explanation and
  however plausible, that the attempt to take Calais was an afterthought. The
  German had enough troops at hand to have attempted the capture of this
  important fort before he tackled the business of his advance on Paris. He had
  enough troops released by the fall of Maubeuge to have advanced, at any rate
  to Boulogne, which was an open town. He did, indeed, capture Lille and demand
  a fantastic ransom and indemnities. But Calais and the seaports, even
  Dunkirk, he had no immediate use for, saw no possibilities in their capture,
  and could afford to leave them to his leisure. He was fulfilling his proper
  business when he advanced with every soldier he could muster to the
  destruction of the armies which waited him east of Paris. Therein one can
  find no fault with German strategy; he was carrying out the very simple plan
  which was laid down by Napoleon, of discovering his enemy in his greatest
  strength and destroying him.</p>

  <p>After Paris, and the retirement from the Marne, the German was on the
  defence. If he did not know it in the first week following his occupation of
  the heights above the Aisne, he had plenty of time to make the discovery. He
  was on the defence when he switched round to face the west, and when the
  Prince of Wurtemberg's army and von Buelow's, and the Crown Prince of
  Bavaria's, were sent to assist von Kluck on that defensive line.</p>

  <p>The British troops had been withdrawn from Soissons with remarkable
  ability. They had occupied trenches facing the whole German line for twenty
  miles, and these trenches were regularly relieved every twenty-four hours,
  the men taking up their own food and water sufficient to last them that time,
  because owing to the exposed position it was quite impossible for any help to
  get to them during the day.</p>

  <p>On the night when it was decided to rush the British north, French
  regiments were brought up and the regular business of relieving went
  on&mdash;as far as the Germans knew, the ordinary routine which was enacted
  every night. Beyond firing a few shots for luck in the direction from which
  the noises came, they were perfectly satisfied that nothing untoward was
  happening. Very stealthily the British left their trenches and were replaced
  by the French. Swift trains carried them to where the German was preparing
  the strongest of his defensive lines.</p>

  <p>He was on the defensive all the way up as far as the Belgian frontier,
  defending the communications of the armies, defending the right of the German
  line, and establishing for himself a clear way out if the worst came to the
  worst.</p>

  <p>Calais then was an afterthought; it is not known who invented that cry,
  which brought an end to 100,000 German lives, which frittered and squandered
  the most precious material of war upon a false objective, and in a movement
  which had no serious military value. It may have been invented to excuse a
  defensive&mdash;German military authorities are sticklers on such little
  matters as words.</p>

  <p>Whatever was the reason, this much is certain: the great German General
  Staff decided that the effort to reach the coast was well worth a huge
  sacrifice of life. Soldiers of every age and in every stage of efficiency
  were thrown into the firing line&mdash;old men and young boys mingled with
  the finest of the German fighting force, and attacks more vigorous than any
  the war has yet produced were delivered against the Allied line.</p>

  <p>A considerable army had been released by the fall of Antwerp on October
  9th. There was yet another army occupying Brussels, though this could not
  have been any considerable force, otherwise the Belgian Army would never have
  made its escape from Antwerp as it did. Some 30,000 to 40,000 Belgian
  soldiers under their heroic king had succeeded in reaching the coast and
  moved on, first to Ostend, and then, when the seat of government was
  transferred to Havre, to the little fishing town of Nieuport, some nine and a
  half miles south-west of Ostend. On October 16th the German Army, which, as I
  say, had been released by the fall of Antwerp, was moving to Ghent and
  Bruges. These towns were effectively occupied, and then Ostend came into the
  hands of the enemy without any resistance on the part of the Belgian Army.
  The Belgians knew too well what resistance would mean to this beautiful
  town&mdash;the Queen of Plages. They had seen the blackened ruins of
  Termonde, of Louvain, and Malines, and they took no risk with this pride of
  the Belgian coast, but retired along the sand dunes and encamped themselves
  at Nieuport, on the banks of the canalised Yser.</p>

  <p>The German came into Ostend in full force, established himself in the
  town, and felt cautiously along the coast to see how far he might progress in
  his march to join the right wing of the German Army. At the same time the
  German evidently brought his reserve corps, and all the auxiliary troops he
  could lay his hand on, to the left of the Ostend force, and felt no less
  cautiously towards Dixmude. The main German Army had now reached Ypres.</p>

  <p>Few people realise the importance of this little place. Very few perhaps
  had ever heard of it until this war brought it into prominence. It is a very
  ancient town, and goes back a thousand years in its history. Indeed, in the
  year 1200 Ypres was the wealthiest and most powerful town in Flanders. It was
  burnt by the English in 1383, again in 1566 by Alva, was taken four times by
  the French and twice by other races. It is a veritable centre of trouble. All
  the sorrow and the rapine that have swept over Flanders have invariably
  concentrated at Ypres. The town, which is happily not yet in ruins, is filled
  with ancient edifices, some of the greatest of the buildings being 700 years
  old. Its magnificent Cathedral of St. Martin dates from 1221.</p>

  <p>It was easy to understand how Ypres became the centre of some of the
  fiercest fighting witnessed in the war&mdash;fighting in which thousands of
  Britons and Germans and Frenchmen and gallant Belgians laid down their
  lives.</p>

  <p>Roulers is only 14 miles in one direction, Fumes 20 miles in another.
  Hazebrouck is 19¼ miles, and Dixmude a very little distance. It was in this
  district, and upon this field of operations, that the bloodiest battle of the
  war was fought.</p>

  <p>But let us return to Ostend for a moment.</p>

  <p>Between Ostend and Nieuport is a long road bare of houses or habitation;
  to the right lies the sea and the golden level stretch of beach for which
  this part of Flanders is renowned; on the left the uneven hummocks of the
  dunes, sparsely covered with dark green and stunted vegetation, rolling like
  the sea which gave it its existence. Between Ostend and Nieuport are two
  notable villages, both of which have raised themselves to the dignity of
  townships by their proximity to the seashore. The first of these is
  Middlekirk, consisting of a number of hotels and private villas built along
  the seashore; the second is Westende. The German did not expect to take
  Nieuport without a struggle. The Yser, stretching from here to Dixmude,
  offered a natural barrier to the advance along the coast, and it was not to
  be supposed that the Belgian, fagged and war- worn as he undoubtedly was,
  would yield passage without a tremendous struggle. Nevertheless, the German
  hoped by massing enormous forces to press his way across the Yser, and
  incidentally turn the left of the Allied force which was now advancing on
  Ypres, and had pushed in on the border as far as Armentières.</p>

  <p>To a large extent the Allies' left was covered by Dunkirk, the most
  northerly of the fortified French coast towns. But the German was in
  sufficient strength to mask that fortress and to exercise such pressure upon
  the Allied left as would cause it to 'fall back from the north of
  Lille, and uncover a way for the Germans, who were now on the west of the
  town, to advance on Calais with little or mo difficulty.</p>

  <p>Whatever plans*'the Great General Staff had were shattered by a force
  which they might reasonably suppose had no coherent existence&mdash;the
  Belgian Army. It had been loudly proclaimed in Berlin that the Belgian Army
  as a force had ceased to exist, that its heroic King had established himself
  at Havre, "safe from the sound of the guns." So far from being in Havre, the
  King was with his magnificent men&mdash;a mere handful as armies go in these
  times, but full of wondrous courage, and determined to fight to the death for
  this last little corner of their beloved land&mdash;established indeed in the
  "final angle."</p>

    "A most capable commander in the field." &mdash;Sir John French.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>It was the Belgian Army which beat back every attack that was made on it,
  the Belgian infantry who with guns and rifles and bayonets hurled back the
  invader again and again, till the sand dunes between Nieuport and Westende
  were covered with German dead. Reinforcements in some strength were hurried
  up; trenches were prepared and positions taken, which must result in the
  retreat of the plucky little army which opposed the pioneers of German
  culture. At that moment there came a new force on the field. Three monitors,
  shallow-draft vessels originally built for the Brazilian Government to cover
  their great waterways, and now commissioned as the "Mersey" the "Severn," and
  the "Humber," sailed close inshore on October 18, and by means of observation
  balloons began a bombardment of the German trenches. This was a surprise
  which the German did not expect. He went through these operations on the
  coast without any fear of an attack from the sea. He depended upon one very
  important consideration. Between Ostend and Dunkirk the shore slopes so
  gradually that there is scarcely a dozen fathoms of water two miles from the
  shore. It would be absolutely impossible to bring in ships with big guns to
  such a proximity to the land that their guns would be of any service. Other
  nations than Belgium, however, have difficulties of shallow draught rivers,
  and one of these is Brazil, who had ordered the building of these monitors,
  which could negotiate the shallows of their great rivers, and, if need be,
  ground on sandbanks without greatly affecting the structure of the boat. Just
  before war broke out these monitors, armed with heavy guns, were being got
  ready to proceed to Brazil. With commendable promptitude the Government
  stepped in and purchased the ships, with an eye to such a contingency as now
  existed. They were commissioned and made ready not a moment too soon. On the
  day that the German reached the coast the monitors were already in position,
  and under cover of the darkness, the leadsmen in the chains feeling every
  fathom of the way, the monitors put into shore and cleared their decks for
  action.</p>

  <p>It was a tense moment when dawn broke and the day revealed the new enemies
  one to the other&mdash;the German on land, a little perplexed and perhaps a
  little frightened, the sailors at sea, curious and keen. A signal from the
  Commodore's ship, and the first monitor's gun flashed forth. From that moment
  there came into the din of battle a newer and more sinister sound. To the
  quick crash of bursting shrapnel which the Belgian artillery were flinging
  above the trenches came a deeper and more ominous note. It was the note which
  high explosive shell, carrying an enormous amount of shrapnel, makes upon
  explosion. And now the action was general, the licking flames from the four
  big guns of the monitors shot out scarcely without an interval, save the
  little lull which came when the fire directors were conferring with their
  observer in the balloon. The fight and its incidents was invisible from the
  sea, save for dim moving figures and the haze of smoke which hung over the
  battlefield, save for the bursting of Belgian shrapnel, which indicated to
  the watchers on the sea the direction their own fire might take; there was no
  arrest of hostilities, and even when night fell the glare of the British
  searchlights revealed their objective.</p>

  <p>They were not to remain in undisputed possession of their vantage place.
  First the German brought two guns to bear along the dunes to Westende; these
  were destroyed. Then an unexpected submarine flotilla came stealing along the
  coast. Aeroplanes dispatched from the shore to drop bombs upon the monitors
  fared no better. As for the unfortunate submarines, one at least was chased
  by the torpedo-boat destroyer "Badger" and rammed by her.</p>

  <p>In the air, under the sea, and on the surface of the water this strange
  four- cornered fight went on, and as the German line shifted, so did the
  monitors steam slowly to take up a new position. So far as the enemy's plans
  for advancing along the dunes were concerned, he was as far off Calais as
  ever.</p>

  <p>The demoralising effect of this fire cannot be overestimated. There is no
  doubt whatever that the monitors enabled the slender Belgian force to hold
  the Yser. Confused fighting was going on all along the line practically from
  Nieuport to Lille. The British operating in the Lens district on October
  15-16 had been hastily summoned from the south, and a first detachment,
  opposed as they were by overwhelming numbers, succeeded in entrenching
  themselves under fire, and in holding their position until the main body of
  the British Army came to support them. Villages on the outskirts of important
  centres were taken and retaken until not one stone was left upon another.
  Some of the unfortunate inhabitants had no time to get away, and terrible
  scenes were enacted in the midst of this inferno.</p>

  <p>The morning had dawned peaceably for the inhabitants of the
  village&mdash;old men and women and children&mdash;save that in the dark of
  the night there had been strange glows on the horizon.</p>

  <p>There had come to them a distant rumbling like thunder; yet that morning
  brought no sign of war, for the village lay off the beaten track, and the
  people who gathered to gossip in the little market-place which stood at the
  top of a slight rise and commanded a view of the plains below*, spoke of war
  as though it were something vastly remote, something in another world, even
  as the people in London discuss it, without ever expecting to feel its
  terrible effects.</p>

  <p>After the fall of Antwerp the Germans marched on Bruges and Ostend, which
  they occupied in the latter half of October. And now the cry was "to
  Calais."</p>

  <p>The 4th Army Corps (the 3rd Cavalry Division under Major-General the Hon.
  Julian Byng, and the 7th Division under Major-General Capper) had materially
  assisted the successful operation of bringing the Belgians to the Allied
  line. It was decided by Sir John French, who had been given command of the
  forces operating in the north of France, to employ the Belgian Army on his
  left.</p>

  <p>The 4th Army Corps was necessarily weak, consisting as it did only of one
  cavalry division and one infantry division; but with these Sir John French
  decided to thrust through, supported as the 4th Corps was by the 87th French
  Territorial Division in Ypres and by the 69th French Territorial Division at
  Poperinghe.</p>

  <p>There were, therefore, three effective infantry divisions and a cavalry
  division for employment, which, taken together, recompensed Sir John for the
  weakness of the 4th Corps. Any step which the British Commander might take
  was necessarily hampered by the fear of the unknown quantity of German troops
  which were reported to be approaching from the north-east. The line the 4th
  Corps and the French reserve divisions held was greatly and dangerously
  attenuated. It had to be spread out over a wide front in a desperate and
  daring attempt to cover a ground which from its size it was not competent to
  cover.</p>

  <p>It was the old Colesberg tactics over again. It was French in his most
  daring and gallant mood. He knew he had very wide gaps to cover, he knew the
  possibility of a tremendous onslaught upon this thin khaki line in the north,
  and he knew, too, that he had in reserve one Army Corps (the 1st), and that
  even if he put this in he could not hope effectively to bar the way to Calais
  unless a miracle happened.</p>

  <p>But would he put the 1st Corps into the line? To take such a step, to
  fight a battle along an enormous front with absolutely no reserves whatever,
  would be taking what most strategists would condemn as an unnecessary risk.
  He had to decide very quickly. Sir Henry Rawlinson, moving forward to take
  possession of Menin, found himself opposed by very strong forces, and his
  thin left flank very badly threatened.</p>

  <p>"It was a very difficult task that was allotted to Sir Henry Rawlinson and
  his command. Owing to the importance of keeping possession of all the ground
  towards the north which we already held, it was necessary for him to operate
  on a very wide front, and until the arrival of the 1st Corps in the northern
  theatre&mdash;which I expected about the 20th&mdash;I had no troops available
  with which to support or reinforce him," Sir John French writes in his
  despatch.</p>

  <p>"Although on this extended front he had eventually to encounter very
  superior forces, his troops, both cavalry and infantry, fought with the
  utmost gallantry and rendered very signal service.</p>

  <p>"I hoped that at this particular time there was no greater force coming
  from the north-east than could be held off by the combined efforts of the
  French and British cavalry and the Territorial troops supporting them until
  the passage at Menin could be seized and the 1st Corps brought up in
  support.</p>

  <p>"Sir Henry Rawlinson probably exercised a wise judgment in not committing
  his troops to this attack in their somewhat weakened condition, but the
  result was that the enemy's continued possession of this passage at Menin
  certainly facilitated his rapid reinforcement of his troops and thus rendered
  any further advance impracticable."</p>

  <p>The main result of the failure to secure Menin resulted in the rapid
  concentration of German troops and the retirement of the 7th Division and the
  3rd Cavalry Division (of the 4th Corps) to a line farther west.</p>

  <p>It was here that Sir John made his decision as to the disposition of the
  1st Army Corps. To throw it in to strengthen the line meant leaving the
  country north and east of Ypres and the whole line of the Yser canal open to
  a wide turning movement. The gallant Belgian Army was battered and stale.</p>

  <p>To quote Sir John French's despatch again:&mdash;"The Belgian Army were
  rendering what assistance they could by entrenching themselves on the Ypres
  canal and the Yser river; and the troops, although in the last stage of
  exhaustion, gallantly maintained their positions, buoyed up with the hope of
  substantial British and French support.</p>

  <p>"After the hard fighting it had undergone the Belgian Army was in no
  condition to withstand, unsupported, such an attack; and unless some
  substantial resistance could be offered to this threatened turning movement,
  the Allied flank must be turned and the Channel ports laid bare to the
  enemy."</p>

  <p>As we know, Sir John took the risk. He directed Sir Douglas Haig to move
  with the 1st Corps to the north of Ypres, gambling on the fact that the
  reinforcements which the Germans were bringing up were being directed toward
  the line of the Lys and against the 2nd Corps farther south of La Bassée. He
  gambled, too, on his knowledge of the composition of the Corps which were
  operating against him, and that the 3rd Reserve Corps, which was most likely
  to direct the attack upon the new forces, had been badly battered in a
  previous operation.</p>

  <p>It was a Napoleonic decision. Let none doubt how much hung upon that
  movement and what a vast difference the success of Sir John French's strategy
  entailed.</p>

  <p>The fighting now began to develop about Ypres. Here attack after attack
  was delivered, trenches were taken and retaken at the point of the bayonet,
  regiments and brigades were shelled with a ferocity which was unparalleled
  during the war, and the flower of the German Army was brought up with the
  object of attaining the occupation of the town, only to be thrown back by the
  steel wall of the Allied line. One section of trenches, after a tremendous
  fight, was taken by the enemy and the British driven out with loss; but
  scarcely had the German settled himself in his new quarters before there
  advanced across the contested ground the Northamptons, the King's Royal
  Rifles, and the 2nd Queen's West Surrey Regiment.</p>

  <p>It was the same tale over again. The British reserves, patient and
  enduring, watching for the first signs of a weakening line ahead and moving
  toward it swiftly and remorselessly. Here the composition of the Brigade
  which pushed forward to undo the mischief which the German had done was a
  notable one- -three crack infantry corps, two of them recruited in London, as
  so many of our best regiments are.</p>

  <p>The horizon was a circle of thundering guns. Shrapnel burst all over the
  ground to be covered, and the brown earth was sent spurting upward in tiny
  fountains where the enemy's bullets were striking. Yet into this hail of
  death the three battalions advanced, met their astonished enemy half way, and
  with bayonet and machine gun combed his ranks to such purpose that what had
  been a brigade in the morning was only a few companies that night.</p>

  <p>Again that long and deadly bayonet of ours had proved too much for the
  German. Again the tireless infantry had achieved the impossible. It was such
  a charge these men delivered as one would have thought could never have been
  witnessed in these days of high velocity rifle fire. But it was with the
  bayonet that this fine brigade charged; hand to hand in the trenches,
  battling desperately for mastery, driven out and back, shot down as they
  crossed the open space and reforming to come back again and yet again at the
  wire-entangled trenches, they succeeded at last in recovering the lost
  ground.</p>

  <p>Ypres itself was in the occupation of the Allies. The wonderful old
  Flemish town, with its cathedral and its most beautiful halls, was alive with
  British and French infantry. Every gun the German could muster was trained
  upon this city and its entrenched defenders. Again and again fierce infantry
  charges were repulsed; again and again a great crowd of khaki figures
  scrambled out from their earthy home, and went swinging across the fields to
  meet the onrush of the élite of the Prussian Army. Again and again men were
  locked together in a hand-to-hand struggle. Once the enemy penetrated almost
  to the town itself, and were driven out again. Once so critical was the
  situation that a French general formed up his bodyguard Cuirassiers, and
  gathering together a mixed force of Army Service Corps men and camp followers
  armed with any weapons they could get, threw themselves with desperate
  courage upon an advancing German regiment and turned the scale in favour of
  the Allies.</p>

  <p>The heroism of that defence is one of the most memorable chapters in the
  history of the British Army. But our French comrades on the left had no less
  a deadly business in hand.</p>

  <p>Dixmude, a heap of ruins battered beyond recognition by Allies and German
  alike, was a scene of such slaughter that the mind sickens at its
  contemplation. The closeness of the fighting and its desperation may be
  gauged by the fact that so near up were the divisional commanders that they
  were under shell fire most of the time. The General Officer Commanding the
  1st Army Corps was wounded, and three staff officers of the division and
  three of the second division were killed, whilst the General Commanding the
  2nd Division of the 1st Army Corps was knocked out by a shell and was
  unconscious for some time.</p>

  <p>Slowly the 1st Corps was being forced back. The Germans seemed to come up
  from the ground, so huge were their numbers. Nothing, it seemed, could stand
  against them, and on that critical day, October 31, when the order from the
  Kaiser had gone out that Ypres should be taken at all costs, and the whole
  weight of the Bavarian and Prussian Corps were being thrown at the British
  line, only the individual bravery of our splendid men retrieved what promised
  at one time to be disaster. The order went out that the main road to the bend
  of the canal was to be held at all costs. The 1st Division rallied on the
  line of the woods east of the bend of the road, the German advance by the
  road being checked by enfilade fire from the north. The 2nd Brigade fell back
  under the onrush and because its flank was exposed, but the right of the 7th
  Division was brought up, and though under a terrific fire held on to its
  trenches till nightfall.</p>

  <p>The line, ragged and in places broken, was now closing up. The French at
  Bixschoote, the Belgians and French at Dixmude, the French marines at
  Dixmude, the British north and south of Ypres, were gradually consolidating
  the line which they had won with such bravery.</p>

  Kents&mdash;Five Days' Fight at Neuve Chapelle&mdash;Critical Days&mdash;
  London Scottish&mdash;The Worcestershires' Great Fight&mdash;Realistic
  Description of Fighting&mdash;The Defeat of the Prussian Guard.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE 1st Corps, which had battled so splendidly upon the
  Aisne, had achieved even greater things in this new phase of the campaign,
  and the 2nd Corps, under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, had won for itself a place
  in the immortal story of the Empire.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Corps had done every bit as well, from the time it was quietly
  "slipped in" before the battle of the Aisne. Though it did not cover so wide
  a front as the 1st Corps, yet it stretched from twelve to thirteen miles, and
  had against it from time to time great concentrations of the enemy. At St.
  Yves two battalions of the Corps, the King's Own Regiment and the Lancashire
  Fusiliers, covered themselves with glory in a successful attempt to save the
  cavalry from serious menace.</p>

  <p>It was one of those Homeric fights with which the war has abounded. Dogged
  infantry pelted forward through a hail of nickel, leaving the shelter of
  their trenches in an heroic effort to achieve what for the moment seemed
  impossible. With set teeth the men flung themselves upon their overpowering
  enemy and swept him back.</p>

  <p>These infantry advances, made in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun
  fire, shelled desperately and unceasingly by far-off batteries, and
  themselves unprotected by artillery, formed a feature of Pulteney's
  operations. Too often the 3rd Corps had to adapt itself to the extraordinary
  conditions under which it was fighting. Resolute, resourceful, untiring, the
  grimy, unshaven battalions, so caked with mud as almost to be
  indistinguishable from the soil into which they dug themselves, rose obedient
  upon occasion to the moment's need, and went about their heroic business in
  that spirit of cheerfulness which is the British soldier's peculiar
  characteristic.</p>

  <p>It might seem impossible to electrify these plodding units to energy, and
  yet at one sharp word of command, at the thrill of a whistle, the slow moving
  line would sweep across the uneven fields of Belgium toward the yellow line
  of trenches which spat death at the advancing men, and would carry their
  purpose to a successful issue, come what may. The exhilaration of the bayonet
  charge and the grand assault was afforded only in rare instances. For the
  most part the battle rapidly developed into shell fire against
  entrenchments.</p>

  <p>On October 25th the shelling was so violent that the Leicestershire
  Regiment were forced from their trenches by these heavy projectiles blowing
  up the pits they were in. There was scarcely a regiment that did not cover
  itself with glory in that surging backward and forward of the 3rd Corps. We
  know how the Middlesex were driven from their trenches, and aided by the
  Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders&mdash;curiously enough, old comrades who
  have lain together in various garrisons from time to time&mdash;the trenches
  were regained. The incidents of that fight have come to us in scraps. Cockney
  and Scot in one grand rush across the sodden field drove home with fist and
  bayonet.</p>

  <p>We know how the Somerset Light Infantry saw the line of the 11th Brigade
  broken in the neighbourhood of St. Yves, and how, led by Major Prowse, of the
  Somersets, this regiment moved forward to the attack, and though opposed by
  numbers three times greater in strength, succeeded in restoring the line.</p>

  <p>This regiment, with the Hampshires, and the East Lancashire Regiments, was
  commended for its gallantry. In the share of praise the Indian troops take,
  as they deserve, a foremost place. The Gurkhas were driven from their
  trenches by the strength of one attack, only to be regained by these little
  men from Nepal, who went through the barbed-wire entanglements and killed
  their enemy in his trench.</p>

  <p>If it was a point of honour to the British to defend Ypres and the line
  about, no less did it seem a point of honour to the Prussian that he should
  take this battered city; and whether it was because he desired to proclaim
  from this last town of Flanders his annexation of the country or whether he
  attached a greater significance to the securing of the cross-roads which
  Ypres represented, is not certain. But certainly against the British trenches
  he sent the best of his army. Inspired by the hatred of the Crown Prince of
  Bavaria, who issued from time to time proclamations of a particularly bitter
  character, the Bavarians advanced to the attack, only to share the fate of
  the earlier detachments which had been put at the British to crush them.</p>

  <p>The 1st Army Corps on the left and the 9th French Corps on the right
  effectively held back the attack. It was on November 10, after the 27th, the
  15th, the 13th Bavarians and the 2nd German Corps had been thrown back from
  the British line, that a division of the Prussian Guard, which had been
  operating farther south in the neighbourhood of Arras, was brought up to this
  area by night, secretly detrained, and moved forward to take up a position
  which would enable them to attack to the best advantage.</p>

  <p>It is often asked by those who are unacquainted with the conditions under
  which this war is being fought&mdash;and there are many such, despite, or
  because of, the quantity of literature on the subject&mdash;in what manner
  can a General judge the merit of a regiment which calls for extraordinary
  recognition. It is not by the brilliant achievement of some deed, by the
  grasping of some opportunity which chance has offered, that a regiment gains
  its laurels. It is by consistent good work under all and every
  disadvantageous condition, and by its brilliant consistency that a corps
  comes to a condition which enables the General to say: "I can depend upon
  this battalion in every circumstance."</p>

  <p>There are certain regiments which hold meritorious records stretching back
  to the very beginnings of the British Army. In the great battles of Flanders
  we have seen again and again how our famous regiments have confirmed the fame
  their fathers won.</p>

  <p>"The courage, tenacity, endurance, and cheerfulness of the men in such
  unparalleled circumstances are beyond all praise."</p>

  <p>One regiment, entrenched before Ypres, was subjected to the heaviest shell
  fire. Again and again the great projectiles burst on the edge of the
  trenches, burying their occupants under three or four feet of earth. Again
  and again our intrepid men dug themselves out and re-made the trench which
  the German artillery had shattered. Again would come the whine of the shell,
  the terrific explosion as it detonated, and again would be seen the
  terrifying spectacle of heaving earth as men strove again to win out to the
  light of day.</p>

  <p>On one occasion the trench was much deeper, and the men buried under the
  earth could not clear themselves without assistance. Volunteers were called
  for from an adjoining trench to the work of rescue. The whole platoon which
  occupied that particular trench volunteered, but only a section was allowed
  to go. Carrying spades, these men raced across the ground under an unceasing
  fire, and working coolly and calmly, with every weapon in the German arsenal
  directed against them, they rescued the living and succoured the wounded
  before they came back in triumph to their places.</p>

  <p>The remarkable part of this story is that the men they rescued alive
  immediately set themselves to the task of reconstructing the works which the
  German shells had destroyed, and establishing themselves again within the
  trench in which they had been thrice buried.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>One officer related to the writer how he was rescued three times from such
  a living grave, and how on each occasion he found himself half conscious,
  lying on the body of another officer. The heavy losses incurred by the
  commissioned ranks make a splendid testimony to the fearlessness of the
  British officer. Officers and men apparently form a mutual admiration
  society. The officers can say nothing too much for the men; the men cannot
  speak too well of the bravery of their officers.</p>

  <p>In one British battalion&mdash;the Royal West Kents&mdash;about the
  behaviour of which General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien made a speech which is
  perhaps without parallel in the history of the Army, there had been lost
  during the war 29 officers, 19 of whom had been killed. After its great fight
  at Neuve Chapelle, the battalion was brought out of action by a
  'lieutenant! All the other officers had been killed or wounded, and it
  fell to Lieutenant White and his comrade, 2nd Lieutenant Russell, to bring
  out this splendid battalion which had gone to the war with a complement of 30
  officers. The two young officers received the Distinguished Service
  Order.</p>

  <p>How do these battles develop? Here is the story of the West Kents and
  their defence.</p>

  <p>Towards the evening of Oct. 26th the West Kents were being subjected to a
  very heavy shrapnel fire in the support trenches.</p>

  <p>Up to 2 p.m. on the 27th all had been comparatively quiet, when suddenly a
  hail of bullets was showered on A and B Companies' support trenches and some
  other British troops, having fallen back from the line which they held, were
  seen coming through our lines. Thereupon, the supports were taken out of
  their trenches and moved to a position about 50 yards away, lining a road at
  right angles to the general line of our trenches in order to cover the left
  which was now exposed. Some crawled forward, but it was impossible to get
  very far owing to the heavy fire of the enemy they were under the whole time.
  On arrival at the road the enemy could be seen collecting in masses about 250
  yards away. The Queen's Own opened fire and they did not advance.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to state the Germans' action, movement by movement, but it
  is clear that they wished to get round to the back of our trenches, but owing
  to the determined manner in which our men held the road with odds roughly of
  four to one against them, the enemy were frustrated in their attempt.</p>

  <p>Now, as the enemy saw that the road was denied them, they decided to
  extend their right and so overlap our flank, but, further down the road, D
  Company, who were then in reserve, conformed to the first movement, so
  extending the British line. This was still insufficient, and the Germans got
  into a village (Neuve Chapelle) on our left flank, having thus completely
  broken through the British front line. Dusk was beginning to fall, and owing
  to a request by the Royal West Kents for reinforcements, they learnt that the
  9th Bhopal Infantry were coming to their help; in the meantime there was a
  small incident worth recalling. On one occasion a couple of men appeared
  round a house, and when challenged, replied "We are English," which reply was
  greeted by a volley from our men, as such a reply deserved, as it is a
  well-known trick of the enemy to reply to a challenge in English. Just before
  the 9th Bhopal Infantry came up, the men in the trenches could hear the
  Germans collecting preparatory for a charge, calling out "Deutsche hier," but
  on the arrival of native troops they withdrew. That night the regiment had to
  readjust its line temporarily. The 9th B.I. prolonging our left, bending the
  line back from the left flank as the trenches formerly held by British troops
  were now occupied by the Germans.</p>

  <p>The following conversation was overheard by an officer in the 9th B.I.
  passing behind one of our trenches:</p>

  <p>Pte. A.&mdash;Hallo! Who's that passing behind the trench?</p>

  <p>Pte. B.&mdash;That? Why, that's an officer.</p>

  <p>Pte. A.&mdash;But we ain't got no officers left now.</p>

  <p>Pte. B.&mdash;That's a British officer of the native troops.</p>

  <p>Pte. A.&mdash;Thank Heaven. I'm glad to know there are still some officers
  about.</p>

  <p>On October 28 the regiment was told that a combined force of British,
  French, and Native troops were going to make an attack and re-take the
  trenches lost the previous day, consequently our artillery started shelling
  Neuve Chapelle very heavily. But in the meantime the enemy were also shelling
  our trenches preparatory to an attack. They were beginning to develop their
  attack, and when the Allies discovered this, they devoted their efforts to
  attempting to shell the hostile infantry, but unfortunately, their shots fell
  short and the men in the fire trenches were subjected to both shrapnel and
  heavy artillery fire from friend and foe.</p>

  <p>About 2.45 p.m. the German attack having developed more quickly than our
  own, they were enabled to push a force of about 400 men through the gap which
  had yet to be filled. From the point of view in the fire trenches, it was
  impossible to do anything beyond getting two men to fire over the left
  traverse of the left trench. Shortly after this the West Kents had a number
  of shots in their backs, but these ceased in about 15 minutes. The narrator
  of this description was in the fire trenches, and consequently can give no
  actual account of what went on in the support and reserve trenches. But at
  dusk, he took a small party to visit the headquarter and reserve trenches,
  and found the Germans had been there but had departed. Thus ended five days
  of very severe fighting, and the regiment had managed to hold the line
  allotted to them, without once having been compelled to withdraw, although at
  times the enemy had completely turned their flank and were behind them*.</p>

  <p>"On October 28, the orders for the day were as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The trenches which had been vacated on the 27th were to be re-taken and
  the village of Neuve Chapelle occupied. At 11 a.m. a general bombardment of
  the enemy's position would be undertaken by our brigade of guns, assisted by
  nine French batteries, and at 11.15 a.m. the line would commence its advance.
  As the battalion had not vacated its trenches on the 27th it had no advance
  to make, but the advance was to be supported by our fire. However, soon after
  12 noon B and C Companies reported that the Germans were attacking in front
  of their trenches. This attack apparently developed all along the line, for
  soon after two o'clock the enemy again broke through on our left flank, and
  again we were heavily enfiladed. While endeavouring to get what remained of D
  Company out of the reserve trenches," writes Lieut. Palmer, "I caught an
  enfilade bullet, which broke my leg, and left me on an open field which was
  apparently the target for the artillery and infantry of both sides, for it
  was swept by a very heavy fire for a considerable period. From my position I
  could see little of what was going on, but as there was rifle fire on both
  sides of us, I imagined our companies had been compelled to withdraw,
  especially as at about 5 p.m. a party of Germans came within 100 yards of me
  from the direction of our firing line. However, at 9 p.m. I was picked up by
  a patrol from C Company, who, to my intense delight, told me that the
  Battalion had never moved from its trenches."</p>

  <p>The story of that unflinching defence is carried on by Lieut. White, who
  received the D.S.O. for his services. The value of this narrative lies in the
  fact that it gives the minutiae of battle&mdash;the battle as it were under
  the microscope.</p>

  <p>"About 7 p.m. on the night of October 28, Captain Moulton-Barrett, who was
  wounded in the head, came to me and said that Second Lieutenant Russell and I
  were the only officers left, and that owing to the retirement of the
  regiments on our left, the Germans had broken through the line, and that we
  were in danger on that flank, and also on the left rear, about a quarter of a
  mile off. C Company was then on the right of the firing line and B Company on
  the left. A and D Companies, who were in support, had retired, owing to a
  mistaken order, having no officers with them. I was in command of C Company
  and Second Lieutenant Russell of B Company.</p>

  <p>"Captain Moulton-Barrett then had to leave owing to his wound, and I
  communicated the situation to the headquarters of the 7th Brigade. The
  strength of the two companies in the firing line was about 200, each company
  having one platoon in support. The Yorkshire Light Infantry were still
  holding their trenches on our right, which made that flank safe.</p>

  <p>"Having posted the night sentries, I went to find some staff officer, and
  after some trouble I found Captain B, Staff Captain of the Brigade.</p>

  <p>He informed me that about 90 men of A and F Companies were coming up to
  support me, that the Duke of Cornwall's were advancing to support the
  Yorkshire Light Infantry on our left and two companies of the Bedfords and
  one of the Cheshires on our left. At about 11 o'clock, after a consultation
  between Major Allason, commanding the Bedford Companies, Captain Blake and
  myself, it was decided that C Company should hold the trenches, but that B
  Company should be thrown back almost at right angles to C Company, facing the
  village, which the Germans had now occupied, the two companies of the
  Bedfords, and the one company of the Cheshires prolonging to the left. At
  about 11.30 p.m. B Company, in spite of a most arduous day, dug fresh
  trenches, and were warmly complimented by the Staff Captain at a later date.
  About 12 midnight the remnants of A and D Companies, about 100 strong, came
  up under Acting Company Sergeant-Majors Mockford and Duffield respectively. I
  then detailed a fatigue party from them to go and draw rations and teas, the
  remainder assisting B Company to dig their trenches.</p>

  <p>"By dawn on the 29th these trenches were completed, B and C Companies
  being in the firing line, with A and D Companies in support in a ditch behind
  B Company, which had been improvised into a support trench.</p>

  <p>"During the day we were under hot shell and machine-gun fire, otherwise
  the day was uneventful. At 2 a.m. on October 30 the Seaforth Highlanders
  relieved us and we marched to Tauret, where we picked up the transport and
  had dinner."</p>

  <p>North and south of the Lys the same scenes were being enacted. Remember
  that the Germans outnumbered the British in some cases by three to one, and
  you will realise how justified Sir John French was when he claimed a complete
  ascendancy for the British over the enemy. When it was man to man, and
  bayonet to bayonet, the British character told. Relieved from the support of
  his siege gun and his heavy gun, and depending only upon his strong right arm
  and his leading, the German was hopelessly outclassed. He fought with a
  courage beyond praise; he endured assaults almost beyond description in their
  murderous character. But he never had a chance man for man. The fighting was
  not all one- sided. Sometimes the British were driven back, but there was a
  point, and a fixed point, beyond which they could not be driven. Day by day
  and night by night this see-saw combat went on. Ypres was isolated,
  surrounded, and seized again.</p>

  <p>The enemy were pressed back to Becelaere and, reinforced, drove back their
  pursuers. They were the days when it was touch-and-go as to whether the
  British would break. Huge German reinforcements had been suddenly sprung upon
  them; an immense army, nerved by hate, carefully inspired by the Crown Prince
  of Bavaria, made what seemed to be an irresistible attack upon the thin line,
  now spread out to a dangerous extent, and with reserves reduced to a minimum.
  Two regiments were forced to give way. Fortunately, the regiment in reserve
  was one of the finest line regiments in the British army&mdash;the Queen's
  Own Royal West Kent Regiment. They came up at the double, took the place of
  the two regiments which had retired, and drove back the enemy. What the
  gallant West Kents lost in that action we have since seen. It came out of
  that action with four junior officers. Elsewhere, when the British line
  bulged threateningly, there was only a Territorial regiment in reserve. It is
  fortunate that that Territorial regiment was one which has the proudest name
  in the British army&mdash; the London Scottish. The London Scottish had gone
  to France at the beginning of the war, to everybody's amazement, save those
  who knew that it was the first of the Territorial regiments to volunteer for
  active service <i>en masse</i>&mdash;and had been engaged on lines of
  communication and particularly in Paris, in police work, and in the necessary
  but monotonous task of defending important points on the railways from
  possible attack.</p>

  <p>Some of them had been stationed at Rouen, guarding bridges and watching
  the roads. But as the attack north of Armenti&amp;res developed, and as the
  seriousness of the situation became apparent, and it was clear to Generals
  Joffre and French that every soldier capable of bearing arms was needed in
  that critical area, the London Scottish were mobilised at St. Omer. They came
  from their little wayside stations, from their roads, from their bridges and
  culverts, elated with a sense that they were going to see action at last.</p>

  <p>Motor-'buses were waiting to take them, and they travelled through France
  across the border and were deposited at Ypres. They came by night; none knew
  of their coming. The men slept as best they could in the jolting 'buses, and
  daylight found them within the sound of the guns. Slowly they advanced; they
  marched out to the British position and from the rearmost trenches advanced
  slowly, shelled all the way. In that baptism of fire, the London Scottish
  proved themselves as good as trained soldiers, no better, but as good. They
  had not the regimental training which keeps a fine battalion together; they
  were all good comrades and good friends, and knew one another, possibly were
  members of the same club. But the indefinable something which consolidates
  the trained line soldier was not yet there. It was to come, however. In
  sections they marched under fire to a village, and joined the cavalry
  reserves, and were ordered to fill the gaps in the trenches which the
  dismounted horsemen were holding. With them was the King's Own Scottish
  Borderers and the Yorkshire Light Infantry. The enemy would not allow them to
  take their place in the trench line without making an effort to stop them.
  Heavy machine-gun fire was opened which swept through the ranks, but the men
  neither faltered nor did they quicken their pace.</p>

  <p>With the same long, swinging stride which distinguishes all Scottish
  regiments they moved up in open order to their places.</p>

  <p>The place of the encounter was Hollebeke, which is midway between Ypres
  and Messines, and a little east of these places. From trench to trench they
  fought their way till the enemy came out to meet them with fixed bayonets.
  Then with a glad yell the gallant London Scottish, fixing their bayonets and
  not waiting for the attack, went straight for their enemy. On the first shock
  the men recoiled; they would have been pardoned if they had scattered. But
  the recoil was only temporary; redressing their lines, they re-formed and
  charged again and again, till the German infantry broke before the impetuous
  rush of the kilted men of London.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Throughout it has been a subaltern's war. The junior officer has
  distinguished himself to an extraordinary extent. And what may be said of the
  junior regimental officer can be said also of the junior staff-officer. It
  was Major Cater of the Scots Guards, who, after the Brigadier of the 10th
  Brigade had been wounded, and the Brigade itself badly cut into, took
  command, and for five days fought his Brigade in the face of overwhelming
  odds, and by his cheerfulness and his optimism pulled together the shattered
  forces under his command. It was Lieutenant Viscount Feilding, a young
  officer called from the Reserves to take his place in the firing line, who
  worthily upheld the tradition of his house&mdash;his father is the Earl of
  Denbigh, who commands the Honourable Artillery Company. For two days he held
  an advance post under heavy shell fire, and in the affair of October 21 it
  was he who held a platoon of the Coldstream Guards with conspicuous
  gallantry, driving back a superior force of the enemy.</p>

  <p>It was Lieutenant Hancock, of the Devonshire Regiment, who left his trench
  under a heavy fire, and going back fifty yards over an absolutely bare
  ground, picked up a corporal who had fallen whilst coming with a party of
  reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Carrying his heavy burden, he made his way to the cover of a haystack and
  placed the man in security, and then returned to his trench. Lieutenant
  Hancock was subsequently killed in action.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Dudley Turnbull, of the Gordon Highlanders, worked his maxim
  gun when the detachment were all wounded, and he himself was struck in two
  places and his gun damaged by a shell. Nevertheless he recovered the gun,
  carrying it away on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>It was a Second Lieutenant of the Royal Scots who led the 12th Lancers to
  a position which enabled them to make a counter attack, in which he took
  part, accounting for eleven of the enemy himself. This was in the fighting
  about Messines.</p>

  <p>It has been impossible to name every village and every field in which
  British troops displayed their valour. At Messines and Neuve Chapelle, at Le
  Touquet&mdash; one could adduce a score of names to testify for the valour of
  British arms&mdash; officer and man alike added lustre to their service. The
  official despatch takes no cognisance of the terrible character of some of
  the fighting, of wild charges that were made and hurled back, only to be made
  again; of struggling men and horses in barbed wire entanglements, facing a
  terrific fire which swept the field clean. At Gheluvelt the 1st Division were
  swept back by an enormously overwhelming force of the enemy, and the
  Worcesters were told to take a village which the enemy had captured.</p>

  <p>This gallant regiment splendidly distinguished itself. Covered by a wood,
  the Worcesters waited for the order. When it came there were 90 yards of open
  space to cross. From trench, from church tower, and from the vantage places
  which roof and window gave, the German poured a terrible fire upon the
  devoted band, as marching with the same phlegm and resolution which had
  characterised its every advance in action, it moved towards its
  objective.</p>

  <p>A small village set about a great chateau&mdash;a straggling street with
  the inevitable cafe where the gossips met at nights, a shop or two inscribed
  with Flemish lettering, blank walls plastered with advertisements, the paved
  road, the dead gardens.</p>

  <p>Now there is no sign of life save the grey-coated figures which crouch
  behind wall and parapet, who have fixed rough barricades and shelters, and
  from the security of these keep up an unceasing fire upon the advancing khaki
  line. It did not seem possible, remembering the numbers of the Germans who
  held the village, that the attacker could succeed&mdash;remembering, too,
  that the defenders had natural breastworks and barriers and commanded a large
  amount of dead ground. The German dispositions had been made earlier in the
  day. Men had received their orders to proceed to certain places of vantage
  from whence they could command every approach.</p>

  <p>Clear of the village and screened by farm buildings, the enemy batteries
  had established themselves and had been engaged all that morning in shelling
  the advance British trenches. Nevertheless, the thin khaki line debouched
  from the wood, appeared as if by magic over the distant rise, men marching
  steadily forward at set intervals, crouching low, making use of every scrap
  of cover, and despite every attempt to check them, moving steadily
  forward.</p>

  <p>The end came with dramatic suddenness. Almost before the German realised
  what was happening, the advance companies of the attackers had reached the
  edge of the village, destroyed one line of defenders and had swept
  irresistibly forward until it was in the main street.</p>

  <p>And now ensued one of these terrible scenes which none but a Zola could
  describe. You may picture knots of yellow-coated men hammering away at closed
  doors, or more summarily blowing in the obstructions, and imagine the scene
  which followed the disappearance of the khaki coats into these little houses.
  Wild and fierce yells, the screams of the wounded, the quick succession of
  shots which rang out from stair and bedroom. Merciless fighting in homely
  Flemish kitchens, and red-tiled passages redder with the blood of the
  slain.</p>

  <p>Here is the description of that fight, supplied me by a man who took part
  in it. It has never yet appeared in print. In this story the horror of war is
  shown plain:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I went into a house and saw nothing. It was full of thick cordite fumes,
  blue with smoke. There was a little stairway to my left, and I dashed up, my
  bayonet outstretched and my finger on the trigger. I saw a man leaning out
  from a room with his rifle raised, and shot him dead. He fell sprawling
  across the threshold of the room and I leapt across his body and came face to
  face with three Jaegers. Their faces were white and drawn; they were more
  like trapped animals than human beings, but they made no sign of surrender
  and lunged at me together, and only by a miracle did their bayonets escape
  me. I stabbed the first through the face, and he fell down writhing at my
  feet. At the same time the second Jaeger fired and the bullet went through my
  neck. I stabbed back at him viciously and caught him in the throat. Then the
  third bayoneted me. All I felt was as if a sharp, hot iron had suddenly
  passed through my shoulder. I jerked myself free and smacked at him with my
  rifle. Somehow I didn't remember to fire at him. Then I fell backward down
  the stairs into the arms of a Worcester sergeant, who took a file of men up
  to finish the work I had begun. I am happy to think that the man
  surrendered.</p>

  <p>"I wandered about the village street aimlessly. I knew I was wounded; I
  thought possibly I was wounded to death, but somehow I had no desire to lie
  down or to seek out the medical staff, the R.A.M.C. men, who you may be sure
  were up there almost as quickly as we were.</p>

  <p>"I saw a man of the Regiment dashing wildly into a house and he called me.
  ''My officer's being murdered,' he shouted, and I went in after him. We
  heard shots and groans coming from an inside room. It was a big vaulted
  kitchen. The table had been overturned, and a fire which the Germans had
  evidently lighted had been scattered over the floor and was smoking and
  smouldering. The officer himself was standing with his back to the wall. The
  wall itself was smothered with his blood, but he was still erect, his empty
  revolver in one hand and his sword in the other, slashing and striking at
  four Jaegers who were attempting to bayonet him. I was so weak with loss of
  blood that I could hardly raise my rifle, and all I remember was falling on
  to the back of one of the Jaegers and throwing my arms round his neck and
  pulling him to the ground. I heard afterwards the officer had died before
  they could get him out of the house, and that our man had killed his three
  opponents and had himself fallen dead at the feet of his officer. I and the
  man pulled down were the only two taken from that house alive.</p>

  <p>"In another house two British soldiers found themselves trapped and shut
  in with a dozen of the enemy and had fought until they and five of their
  opponents were killed, and the remainder were so desperately wounded that
  they were unable to leave the house without assistance. It was the most
  murderous and bloody affair that I shall ever see, please God!</p>

  <p>"'Nothing that any regiment ever did at Waterloo is comparable with
  your achievement to-day," said General French, addressing the regiment; and
  he, as an earnest student of the Napoleonic wars, and usually moderate in his
  praise, paid the Corps the finest compliment that it was possible for a
  commander to pay any regiment."</p>

  <p>At Pilkem, the Royal North Lancashire Regiment earned the commendation of
  Sir John French. It was here that Major Aubrey Carter, D.S.O., was killed.
  Major Carter, a remarkably fine type of Englishman, standing six feet three,
  was the fifth commanding officer which the Royal North Lancs, had lost. He
  had gone out from the trenches to direct a machine gun which was playing on
  large forces which were advancing against his line. In this he succeeded, but
  fell shot dead in the moment of his triumph.</p>

  <p>In that same fight, a major, who had strained his foot, led forward a
  portion of the battalion with a chair in one hand and a stick in the other.
  Whenever it was necessary to halt and direct the advance, he planted his
  chair down squarely and seated himself, and though shell and bullets flew
  around him and he was wounded, he, too, achieved his object. The spectacle of
  that gallant officer, sitting in one of the most exposed positions on the
  field, with his bandaged ankle and his crutch stick, still urging forward his
  men "in the spirit of laughter," is one which will not readily be
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>It must have been extremely difficult for General French to have chosen
  the regiments for distinction, because they all behaved so finely, and none
  perhaps more so than the Brigade of Guards&mdash;a Brigade especially dear to
  the Londoner. When they departed from the battle-front to reorganise and
  refit, they left the line they held intact, and in spite of great loss and
  untold suffering and hardship, they fought the battle of November 17 with as
  good a nerve as the battle of the Aisne. They had perhaps the hardest time of
  the four battalions in the Brigade, for even their rest days were entirely
  taken up with marching and making counter-strokes in various parts of the
  line.</p>

  <p>Lord Cavan, in addressing the men before they left for their well-earned
  rest, said: "I can never express what I think of the great courage and
  endurance shown by officers and men during the defence before Ypres; and I
  should like to put on the regimental records not only my sense of pride at
  being their Brigadier, but my debt to the battalion for their great devotion
  to their duty."</p>

  <p>General French himself recognised the difficulty of singling out regiments
  where so many had been so brave, and he overcame this obstacle by addressing
  a general Army Order, in the course of which he said: "I have made many calls
  upon you, and the answer you have made to me has covered you, your regiment,
  and the Army to which you belong with honour and glory. Your fighting
  qualities, courage and endurance have been subjected to the most trying and
  severe tests, and you have proved yourselves worthy descendants of the
  British soldiers of the past who have built up the magnificent traditions of
  the regiment to which you belong. You have not only maintained those
  traditions, but you have materially added to their lustre. It is impossible
  for me to find words to express my appreciation of the splendid services you
  have performed."</p>

  <p>Unstinted praise for unstinted effort is a fair exchange. The trench work
  had tried the nerves of our men until the banging of a door was sufficient to
  make officer and man (relieved from duty and resting at the rear) jump to
  their feet tense and shaking. Yet these men went back to their trenches, back
  to the horror of this nerve-wracking warfare, cheerfully and without
  complaint. The enemy, whose spies were everywhere, expected demoralisation
  and brought new troops to the attack. Against "the shaken British" he
  conspired to make one vast and overwhelming effort which should shatter the
  resistance and finally and effectively destroy the force which had been a
  thorn in his side from the day he first touched their advance guard on the
  Condé-Mons Canal.</p>

  <p>This is in a country grim and black, where the smouldering red of burning
  villages shows against the grey dawn of a coming day. There is no indication
  of a coming battle. The British trenches are alive and busy; even before dawn
  comes little curls of smoke are blown left and right above the trenches,
  where the cooks are preparing the first meal. All night long the shelling has
  gone on- -intermittently, fitfully, irritably. The sentry posted every hour
  at each end of the trench has been watching through the darkness, searching
  the front for any signs of life. Once in the middle of the night a sentry,
  more jumpy than others, had thought he had seen a figure moving stealthily
  toward the barbed wire entanglements, had loosed off his rifle, and had been
  cursed by his comrades for arousing them from their sleep&mdash;they had dug
  little rooms in the clay well out of shell range&mdash;and now, as the day
  breaks slowly, the maligned sentry points triumphantly to a motionless figure
  lying stark and stiff, a grenade still in his stiffened hand.</p>

  <p>The ground was of the usual character. On the left a ruined farm, its
  discoloured walls blackened, its roof gone, the wreck of a farm wagon or two
  in its littered yard, a dead cow, stiff-legged and malodorous, near a burnt
  byre.</p>

  <p>On the right a little wood, skirted by trenches&mdash;fire trenches,
  support trenches, rough scars in the surface of the unoffending earth,
  scarcely visible in the early light. If it were not for these cautious fires,
  where kettles are singing and where the company cook goes about his work in
  the same condition of picturesque greasiness as distinguishes army cooks the
  world over, you would not realise that 20,000 men were almost within
  call.</p>

  <p>With light comes rifle fire, growing brisker as the day advances, and
  about the trenches the shells are now falling nearly every minute. There is
  no sign that the enemy contemplates anything unusual or that the colourless
  drab front at which the British have been staring for the past six days hides
  anything more violent than the big, lazy guns which send their huge shells
  into the trenches.</p>

  <p>But behind that front many things were happening. The night had seen
  train- load after train-load of soldiers moving northward. The long, dark
  trail of loaded trucks had moved into sidings, and discharged their thousands
  of grey- coated soldiers that had passed on to make room for others.</p>

  <p>Tall men, stiffer than any of the wondering, admiring <i>Landsturm</i> who
  stood about to watch the arrivals.</p>

  <p>It was the Prussian Guard who had come so secretly&mdash;a division of the
  Invincibles leavened by the pride of the army, that shattered remnant which
  had fallen back before the French attack. The citizens of Roulers were
  ordered indoors and threatened with the direst penalties if it dared so much
  as lift a blind to spy upon the miracle which was happening in the very heart
  of the town, heard the close tramp of iron shod feet, and the more daring may
  have seen the grey columns winding out through the outskirts of the town
  towards the west.</p>

  <p>Here was the supreme effort which the Germans had hinted at, whispered
  about, and were now to see carried into triumphant effect.</p>

  <p>The German artillery in full strength moved out, to make ready the
  way.</p>

  <p>Great traction engines hauling the fat, clumsy howitzers on caterpillar
  wheels, puffed and tugged their unwieldy charges along the country roads,
  slipping and skidding on the strip of pavement which crowns the country roads
  of Belgium.</p>

  <p><i>Landsturm</i> regiments, stout, middle-aged, and a little breathless,
  went out left and right, proud of the task which had been set them&mdash;the
  task of supporting these grey invincibles who were to be hurled without
  warning upon the English trenches and were to crumble up the puny army which
  barred a way to the coast.</p>

  <p>It was one of the great military events of the year&mdash;it might have
  been some grand fete to judge by the lines of grey motor cars which took the
  side roads to avoid hampering the advance of the troops. These cars carried
  illustrious passengers. Kings of smaller States, ministers of the Empire,
  great and favoured journalists ready to describe with vivid phrase and
  sonorous period the master-stroke of the War Machine.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the nature of the attack, the men in the British trenches
  sat sipping the inevitable mug of tea or pulling at the as inevitable
  cigarette. Shell and machine gun trained on the crest of the earthy defences
  worried them not at all. It was part of the day's work neither to be wondered
  at nor feared.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden the shelling increased in violence. It could have only
  one significance&mdash;an infantry attack was forming.</p>

  <p>Behind the British line our artillery became frantically active. The air
  was filled with throbbing, whining sound as shell followed shell in its
  destructive flight.</p>

  <p>There was little to be seen from the trenches. A grey mist shrouded all
  objects from the middle distance. It was upon the mist that the Prussian
  Guard, now deployed into line, depended for the completeness of its
  surprise.</p>

  <p>The Guard moved forward silently in long, stiff lines. They might have
  been moving across the parade ground at Potsdam, so orderly was the
  advance.</p>

  <p>The British, firing blindly into the mist, began to drop their men; the
  shrapnel of the artillery in the wood to our right began to search the line,
  which now showed as a grey phantom mass. The German artillery fire had
  ceased, the crucial moment of the struggle was now at hand.</p>

  <p>Along the British trenches ran the order, "Pick off the flank men..." It
  was the grim technique of the slayer that worked the havoc.</p>

  <p>Rifle and machine gun played upon the flank of the first line&mdash;it
  shrank as a paper burning at both ends will shrink&mdash;until there was only
  a knot of men in the centre. But the other lines came on . . . It was the
  bayonet now in the foremost trenches ... a whistle sounded and the field was
  alive with men in khaki, who hurled themselves forward at the advancing
  enemy. Back went the Prussians in disorder, to re-form and return again in
  the dark hours to avenge their defeat with no greater success. The heroism of
  the Guard found its counterpart in the magnificent courage of the outnumbered
  British.</p>

  <p>The line of the German checked and broke a little, but the flanks swept
  on, leaving a swaying, battling group in the centre&mdash;a silent,
  desperately fighting confusion of yellow coat and grey. Along the whole line
  the trenches were flinging fiery defiance at the attacked; trench after
  trench sent men bayoneted&mdash;rifle in hand&mdash;to the carnival of
  slaughter.</p>

  <p>The Prussian Guard, shattered but undaunted, pressed through the trench
  line and gained the wood on the left.</p>

  <p>Here was a heavy battery and a field battery, but the flower of the German
  Army, nothing daunted, swept up to the very guns.</p>

  <p>For a moment it seemed that the guns were in danger, but every man of the
  battery, the cook, the scribe, the very trumpeter, came out to form a
  defending line, and the batteries, aiming point blank, carved lanes through
  the stiff mass of the enemy. Even whilst this desperate fight in the wood was
  in progress- -a fight in which the Guard battled to the last, the bulk of
  their comrades, decimated and beaten, were moving back under a terrific shell
  and rifle fire to the security of their own lines.</p>

  <p>And this is what the German Staff saw, who came out to witness the
  crushing of the thin khaki line&mdash;a sorry wreck of a division which came
  back with half its strength, sullen, defeated men who had essayed the
  impossible. This they recognised, for when they had been re-formed for a new
  attack they had said "Nein" to "Vorwärts!"</p>

  <p>Once again the British Army had evidenced its marvellous fighting power
  against terribly heavy odds, and never did our soldiers better deserve the
  tribute they won from their Commander.</p>

  <p>"I fully realised the difficult task which lay before us, and the onerous
  role which the British Army was called upon to fulfil.</p>

  <p>"That success has been attained, and all the enemy's desperate attempts to
  break through our line frustrated, is due entirely to the marvellous fighting
  power and the indomitable courage and tenacity of officers, non- commissioned
  officers, and men.</p>

  <p>"No more arduous task has ever been assigned to British soldiers; and in
  all their splendid history there is no instance of their having answered so
  magnificently to the desperate calls which have been made upon them.</p>

  <p>"The courage, tenacity, endurance, and cheerfulness of the men are beyond
  all praise."</p>

  <p>This then was the end of the second phase, the effort to hack a way
  through to the coast. It culminated in the terrific attempt of the Prussian
  Guard to do what every other German Corps had failed to. It was failure
  again.</p>

  <p>The growl of the passing storm was still heard for a few weeks more, but
  its fierce intensity died away, and men on both sides exhausted by the effort
  glowered from trench to trench&mdash;the one in sullen anger that his mighty
  sacrifices had been in vain, the other in triumph at his success. Well might
  that triumph be expressed, for against odds sometimes of four to one the
  British Army had thrown back the enemy and twice thwarted him in his dearest
  desire.</p>

  <p>Summing up the situation at the end of November, the "Eye-Witness" wrote:-
  -</p>

  <p>"On the 20th of November the thin khaki line in this quarter was finally
  relieved by the French, and our weary men vacated the battered trenches they
  had so gallantly held for a month.</p>

  <p>"This, then, is the modification of the <i>rô1e</i> now being played by
  the British Army; its front has been considerably shortened by the extent
  taken over by the French, and has in addition been reinforced. The lull in
  activity of about a week in the operations, also, has enabled us to readjust
  our forces, strengthen their position, and to bring up reserves. There has,
  therefore, been a great general improvement in the conditions under which we
  are carrying on the fight; and the time has arrived when it becomes
  possible&mdash; for the first time&mdash;without danger of giving away
  information that might enlighten and encourage the enemy to refer to what our
  troops have done in one quarter of the small portion of the whole battle line
  which they have been holding, and to explain broadly why the stand made by
  them during the month after the 20th of October, 1914, forms one of the most
  glorious chapters in our military history.</p>

  <p>Special attention is drawn to this quarter of our front because it was
  that most highly tried.</p>

  <p>"It may be that the story of that month will never be fully told. Many of
  those who could have supplied essential details are dead, and the nature of
  the fighting was such as to preclude any chance of careful records being
  kept. But it can be said that the dogged pluck of the troops and the
  individual acts of gallantry and devotion on the part of regimental officers
  and men again and again retrieved a situation that was at times critical; and
  that it has been due solely to their resource, initiative, and endurance that
  success has lain with us.</p>

  <p>"As the struggle swayed backwards and forwards through wood and hamlet,
  the fighting assumed a most confused and desperate character. Units became
  inextricably mixed, and in many cases, in order to strengthen some threatened
  point or fill a gap in the line, officers had to collect and throw into the
  fight what men they could, regardless of the units to which they belonged. In
  one trench a subaltern was perhaps in charge of a detachment composed of
  Scotch, Irish, and English regiments. Here, a brigadier commanded a few
  companies. There, another has been in control of a division. One officer of
  that rank at one time had 13 battalions under his command which were much
  below strength owing to casualties and the disintegration inseparable from
  hand-to- hand fighting.</p>

  <p>"Our casualties have been severe, but we have been fighting a battle, and
  a battle implies casualties. And heavy as they have been, it must be
  remembered that they have not been suffered in vain. The duty of the French,
  Belgians, and British in the Western theatre of operations has been to act as
  a containing force, in other words, to hold on to and to keep occupied as
  many of the enemy as possible whilst the Russians were attacking in the East.
  In this we have succeeded in playing our part, and by our resistance have
  contributed materially towards the success of the campaign. Moreover, our
  losses have not impaired our fighting efficiency. The troops have required
  only a slight respite in order to be able to continue the action with as much
  determination as ever. They are physically fit and well fed, and have
  suffered merely from the fatigue inseparable from a protracted struggle such
  as they have been through. The severest handling by the enemy has never had
  more than a temporary effect on their spirits, which have soon recovered
  owing to the years of discipline and training to which officers and men have
  been accustomed.</p>

  <p>"The value of such preparation is as noticeable on the side of the enemy
  as on our own. The phenomenal losses suffered by the German new formations
  have been remarked, and they were in part due to their lack of training.
  Moreover, though at the onset these formations advanced to the attack as
  bravely as their active corps, they have not by any means shown the same
  recuperative power. The XXVIIth Corps, for instance, which is a new formation
  composed principally of men with only from seven to twelve weeks' training,
  has not yet recovered from its first encounter with British infantry round
  Becelaere, to the north-east of Ypres, a month ago. On the other hand, the
  Guard Corps, in spite of having suffered severely in Belgium, of having been
  thrown headlong across the Oise at Guise, and of having lost large numbers on
  the plains of Champagne, and on the banks of the Aisne, advanced against
  Ypres on the 11th of November as bravely as they did on the 20th of
  August.</p>

  <p>"It is well that the services of those who he dead on the slopes and in
  the woods along the Franco-Belgian frontier should be realised, even though
  the realisation of their performances must at present of necessity be
  imperfect. Theirs it has been to defend against tremendous odds a line that
  could only be maintained if they were prepared to undergo great sacrifice.
  And that they have done."</p>

  <p class="intro">The following is the text of the despatch of Field-Marshal
  Sir John French relating to the operations of the Naval Division at Antwerp,
  and covering a despatch from Major-General Paris, who was the General Officer
  Commanding-in- Chief of the Royal Naval Division.</p><br>

  <p class="first">From Sir. J. D. P. French, Field-Marshal,
  Commanding-in-Chief, to the Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

  <p>In forwarding this report to the Army Council at the request of the Lords
  Commissioners of the Admiralty, I have to state that, from a comprehensive
  review of all the circumstances, the force of Marines and Naval Brigades
  which assisted in the defence of Antwerp was handled by General Paris with
  great skill and boldness.</p>

  <p>Although the results did not include the actual saving of the fortress,
  the action of the force under General Paris certainly delayed the enemy for a
  considerable time, and assisted the Belgian Army to be withdrawn in a
  condition to enable it to reorganise and refit, and regain its value as a
  fighting force. The destruction of war material and ammunition&mdash;which,
  but for the intervention of this force, would have proved of great value to
  the enemy&mdash;was thus able to be carried out.</p>

  <p>The assistance which the Belgian Army has rendered throughout the
  subsequent course of the operation on the canal and the Yser river has been a
  valuable asset to the Allied cause, and such help must be regarded as an
  outcome of the intervention of General Paris's force. I am further of opinion
  that the moral effect produced on the minds of the Belgian Army by this
  necessarily desperate attempt to bring them succour, before it was too late,
  has been of great value to their use and efficiency as a fighting force.</p>

  <p>J. D. P. French, Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief.</p>

  <h3>COMMANDER'S REPORT</h3>

  <p>From Major-General A. Paris, C.B., Commanding Royal Naval Division, to the
  Secretary of the Admiralty.</p>

  <p><i>Oct.</i> 31, 1914.</p>

  <p>Regarding the operations round Antwerp from October 3 to 9, I have the
  honour to report as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The brigade (2,200 all ranks) reached Antwerp during the night October
  3-4, and early on the 4th occupied, with the 7th Belgian Regiment, the
  trenches facing Lierre, with advanced post on the River Nethe, relieving some
  exhausted Belgian troops.</p>

  <p>The outer forts on this front had already fallen, and bombardment of the
  trenches was in progress. This increased in violence during the night and
  early morning of October 5, when the advanced posts were driven in and the
  enemy effected a crossing of the river, which was not under fire from the
  trenches.</p>

  <p>About midday the 7th Belgian Regiment was forced to retire, thus exposing
  my right flank. A vigorous counter-attack, gallantly led by Colonel Tierchon,
  2nd Chasseurs, assisted by our aeroplanes, restored the position late in the
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, an attempt made by the Belgian troops during the night
  (October 5-6) to drive the enemy across the river failed, and resulted in the
  evacuation of practically the whole of the Belgian trenches.</p>

  <p>The few troops now capable of another counterattack were unable to make
  any impression, and the position of the Marine Brigade became untenable.</p>

  <p>The bombardment, too, was very violent, but the retirement of the brigade
  was well carried out, and soon after midday (October 6) an intermediate
  position, which had been hastily prepared, was occupied.</p>

  <p>The two Naval Brigades reached Antwerp during the night October 5-6. The
  1st Brigade moved out in the afternoon of the 5th to assist the withdrawal to
  the main second line of defence.</p>

  <p>The retirement was carried out during the night, October 6-7, without
  opposition, and the Naval Division occupied the intervals between the forts
  on the second line of defence.</p>

  <p>The bombardment of the town, forts, and trenches began at midnight,
  October 7-8, and continued with increasing intensity until the evacuation of
  the fortress.</p>

  <p>As the water supply had been cut, no attempt could be made to subdue the
  flames, and soon 100 houses were burning. Fortunately there was no wind, or
  the whole town and bridges must have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>During the day (October 8) it appeared evident that the Belgian Army could
  not hold the forts any longer. About 5.30 p.m. I considered that if the Naval
  Division was to avoid disaster an immediate retirement under cover of
  darkness was necessary. General De Guise, the Belgian Commander, was in
  complete agreement. He was most chivalrous and gallant, insisting on giving
  orders that the roads and bridges were to be cleared for the passage of the
  British troops.</p>

  <p>The retirement began about 7.30 p.m., and was carried out under very
  difficult conditions.</p>

  <p>The enemy were reported in force (a division plus a reserve brigade) on
  our immediate line of retreat, rendering necessary a detour of fifteen miles
  to the north.</p>

  <p>All the roads were crowded with Belgian troops, refugees, herds of cattle,
  and all kinds of vehicles, making inter-communication a practical
  impossibility. Partly for these reasons, partly on account of fatigue, and
  partly from at present unexplained causes large numbers of the 1st Naval
  Brigade became detached, and I regret to say are either prisoners or interned
  in Holland.</p>

  <p>Marching all night (October 8 to 9), one battalion of 1st Brigade, the 2nd
  Brigade, and Royal Marine Brigade, less one battalion, entrained at St.
  Gillies Waes, and effected their retreat without further incident.</p>

  <p>The Battalion (Royal Marine Brigade) Rear Guard of the whole force also
  entrained late in the afternoon together with many hundreds of refugees, but
  at Morbeke the line was cut, the engine derailed, and the enemy opened
  fire.</p>

  <p>There was considerable confusion. It was dark, and the agitation of the
  refugees made it difficult to pass any orders. However, the battalion behaved
  admirably, and succeeded in fighting its way through, but with a loss in
  missing of more than half its number. They then marched another ten miles to
  Selzaate and entrained there.</p>

  <p>Colonel Seely and Colonel Bridges were not part of my command, but they
  rendered most skilful and helpful services during the evacuation.</p>

  <p>I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>A. Paris, Major-General, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.</p>
