  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE FIGHT FOR YPRES</h2>

  <p class="first">"AS I close this despatch," wrote Sir John French in his
  memorable despatch of November 20th, "there are signs in evidence that we are
  possibly in the last stages for the battle of Ypres-Armentières." But for
  many weary weeks longer the struggle was to continue. Nothing on the scale of
  the great and disastrous effort of the Prussian Guards which shattered the
  German hopes to break through the Allied lines was witnessed, but many a
  severe and desperate encounter took place. The Germans were no longer on the
  offensive, it had become impossible for them to get round the flank of the
  Allies, whose lines stretched to the sea. If, therefore, they were to proceed
  they must pierce the Allies' lines at some point. The despairing effort of
  the Prussian Guards probably convinced the higher German Command that not
  much hope lay that way. From that moment the offensive passed to the
  Allies.</p>

  <p>Although the offensive had now passed to the Allies, it was not to be
  expected that there would be an immediate advance to a decisive attack. The
  time for that was not yet. The position was almost an unparalleled one in the
  history of warfare; the extraordinary number of combatants engaged, the
  length of the opposing lines stretching from the sea coast to the frontier of
  Switzerland, the immense stretch of trenches of the opposing forces, the
  unprecedented nature of the weapons; the whole line resembling an endless
  fortress. It was a new kind of war and demanded a new kind of strategy and
  novel tactics. The airmen also played a new part, giving gunners precise
  information of which the accuracy and effectiveness of modern weapons were
  quick to take full advantage. We shall see in the course of this narrative
  what deadly work could be done under these novel conditions, and how much was
  yet to be accomplished before the Allies' offensive could become really
  effective. It was going on all the time, and of what the Allies' stubborn
  work meant in endurance and heroism I hope to give some idea.</p>

  <p>Meantime the district round Ypres was still the scene of fierce
  combat.</p>

  <p>We know fairly well the extraordinary reason which led the Kaiser and his
  Generals to concentrate their attentions upon this unhappy town. Ypres
  represented the last rallying point of citizenship in Belgium. Nearly all the
  other towns in this great country, great in spirit and in soul if not in
  acres, were either in the enemy's hands or were battered into confused heaps
  of brick and mortar.</p>

  <p>At Ypres by the beginning of December the enemy approached so close that
  he could bring his smaller howitzers to work and reduce the pride of the ages
  to smoking ruins. Attack and counter-attack had been the order of the day.
  Entrenchments hastily dug had been elaborated until they were permanent
  earthworks, and a succession of charges made by the flower of the German Army
  was thrown back in confusion. Sometimes the controlling force directing the
  British operations would order an advance, and slipping their bayonets from
  their sheaths and fixing them to the muzzles of their rifles, thousands of
  men would creep out from their earth defence, and moving forward cautiously,
  availing themselves of every bit of cover, would finally, in one reckless
  charge, work their way into the enemy's line.</p>

  <p>On one wet night, 35 men of a regiment, taking advantage of a pitiless
  downpour, moved stealthily forward on an advance trench of the enemy, and
  reached their objective without a shot being fired. It was cold-blooded
  bayonet work for ten minutes, and the little party retired, having wrecked
  the trench, leaving behind 20 dead. No one knew what object was
  served&mdash;-it was all part of the general scheme planned and ordered miles
  and miles away. There, in some quaint little town, occupying what houses were
  available, was the General Staff. Here were big rooms filled with large-scale
  maps, where the position of every British unit was marked, and where, with
  remarkable accuracy, every detail concerning the enemy's strength was also
  displayed. There was one portion of the Intelligence Department of the
  General Staff which had nothing else to do but to examine the shoulder badges
  and the collar ornaments and the various parts of the equipment of dead
  German soldiers. From this slight evidence these patient men would piece
  together not only the numbers of the regiments, but the Army Corps and the
  Army to which they were attached. Every change that the German made in his
  dispositions had been revealed by this painstaking method, and in consequence
  the British Commander has always been prepared for every fresh
  development.</p>

  <p>To Headquarters, too, came the thousands of reports from various parts of
  the field. It was in telephonic communication with London, and in addition
  there was a large telegraph staff supplied with the very finest and newest of
  instruments for dealing with the mass of correspondence which was constantly
  pouring through Army Headquarters.</p>

  <p>Not the least important correspondents of the main General Staff were the
  Corps Staffs which were situated nearer to the firing line, and these in turn
  were fed by the Divisional Staffs who received their reports from the Brigade
  Majors, who in turn relied upon regimental reports. In addition to these
  sources of information, General Headquarters must necessarily keep in close
  touch with all that was happening at the French and Belgian Headquarters, for
  only by the closest co-operation could a successful defensive be
  maintained.</p>

  <p>The offensive in Flanders, as already stated, now rested with the Allies,
  and it was on December 14, 1914, that fresh activities commenced and pressure
  was brought to bear along the whole line. Fierce conflicts were waged and
  violent struggles went on from day to day, entailing heavy losses on German
  and British alike. On one occasion the Indian troops suffered severely in a
  surprise attack made with great ferocity. The Guards also suffered the brunt
  of another attempt to carry a position. The same stubborn fighting was going
  on during December on the coast line. The Belgians were holding on with
  heroic patience and courage the line of the Yser. Holding Nieuport as they
  did, supported by the monitors and cruisers of the British fleet, they
  essayed again and again to advance toward Ostend.</p>

  <p>Lombartzyde, a small village to the north of Nieuport, was shelled and
  taken first by the Belgians and then retaken by the Germans, and then yet
  again by the Belgians, until nothing was left but crumbling walls and hot
  ashes of what had once been a prosperous little community. The village of
  Westende suffered no better fate. Westende Bains, a beautiful <i>plage</i>
  upon the sea front, was wholly destroyed in order to get at the batteries of
  the enemy, which were sheltered behind.</p>

  <p>It may be of interest to refer to what "Eye-Witness" calls the change that
  had come over what may be termed the "atmosphere" of the battlefield at this
  date. It had been one of the wettest Decembers on record, and everything had
  been made worse by the trying condition of the ground and the trenches. The
  floods were as embarrassing to our advance as they were to the enemy. Our
  soldiers were for days standing almost knee-deep in mud and water, often
  almost without shelter, against the pelting sleet and rain and the bursting
  shrapnel. The marshy nature of the soil intensified the discomfort;
  altogether it bore a grim aspect, this trial of heroic endurance, more
  especially during an advance or retreat, when there was little protection
  against the enemy's fire. During the long watches our soldiers endured the
  terrible hardships in their deep ditches and trenches of vile mud and
  rainwater with remarkable composure.</p>

  <p>"Eye-Witness" described the conditions where the combatants were
  entrenched thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The cannonade has now decreased to such an extent that for hours on end
  nothing is heard but the frequent boom of one of the Allies' heavy guns, the
  occasional rattle of machine guns, and the intermittent "pop "&mdash;for that
  word expresses the sound best&mdash;of the snipers of either side.</p>

  <p>And in certain quarters, where the combatants are close and operations
  appertain to those of siege warfare, the bombs of the <i>Minenwerfer</i> and
  the smaller bombs thrown by hand are detonating almost continuously.</p>

  <p>But the air no longer throbs to the continuously dull roar of heavy
  artillery and the detonations of great projectiles. Of course, if an attack
  is in progress, there is again turmoil, but it is more local, and does not
  approach in intensity that which recently reigned on a large scale.</p>

  <p>The scene, as a whole, as viewed from one of the few commanding points in
  our front, is almost one of peace as compared with that of a week or two ago.
  The columns of black smoke vomited by the exploding howitzer shell are as
  rare as those from burning villages.</p>

  <p>The only generally visible signs of war are the occasional puffs of
  bursting shrapnel opening out above woods and villages and floating slowly
  away on the still air.</p>

  <p>It was mentioned in the account of the fighting on the Aisne that so far
  as we were concerned the struggle had to some extent assumed the character of
  siege operations. The same can be said with still greater truth of the battle
  in which we are now engaged.</p>

  <p>Both sides have had time to dig themselves in and to strengthen their
  positions with all the resources available in the field.</p>

  <p>In spite of this the Germans, urged by weighty motives, limited as to
  time, and confident in their numerical superiority and the weight of a very
  powerful siege armament&mdash;such as has indeed never before been brought
  into the field&mdash; have when face to face with the Allies' line attempted
  to break it by frontal attacks.</p>

  <p>Having failed in this, in spite of desperate efforts, they are now
  endeavouring in some quarters to progress by the slower methods of siege
  warfare. Until recently they have attempted to gain ground by assaulting our
  position across the open, seizing what they can of it, retaining and
  strengthening that and using it as a starting point for a fresh assault.</p>

  <p>Their aim is still the same&mdash;to gain ground and drive us
  back&mdash;but owing to the immense loss entailed in the summary method of
  assaulting across the open for any distance the means employed are
  modified.</p>

  <p>When bombardment is or has been severe everyone within range of the
  enemy's guns, the brigadier not excepted, will be found ensconced underground
  in "dug- outs" or "funk-holes," as they are familiarly called, for in the
  zone under fire houses are no better than shell traps.</p>

  <p>Behind the firing line trenches are found the shelters for the men holding
  the line and those for the supports. These are more elaborate and comfortable
  than the fire trenches, usually are roofed over, and contain cooking places
  and many conveniences.</p>

  <p>0</p>

  <p>For some time the character of the artillery fire has been such as to
  force both combatants even for some distance behind the firing line to burrow
  into the earth in order to obtain shelter and to conceal their works as far
  as possible in order to gain protection both from guns and aeroplanes.</p>

  <p>This has been carried on to such an extent that behind the front fire
  trenches of British, French, and Germans are perfect labyrinths of burrows of
  various types. The principal feature of the battlefield, therefore, as has
  often been pointed out, is the absence of any signs of human beings.</p>

  <p>Most of this trench fighting takes place at such close range that the guns
  of either side cannot fire at the enemy's infantry without great risk of
  hitting its own men. The <i>rôle</i> of artillery projectiles, however, is
  well played by bombs of all descriptions, which are used in prodigious
  quantities.</p>

  <p>The larger ones projected by the <i>Minenwerfer</i>, of which the Germans
  employ three sizes, correspond to the heavy howitzer shells of the distant
  combat, and have much the same effect. They have a distinctive nickname of
  their own, but they may be termed the "Jack Johnsons" of the close attack of
  siege warfare.</p>

  <p>The smaller bombs or grenades are thrown by hand from a few yards'
  distance, perhaps just lobbed over a parapet.</p>

  <p>They are charged with high explosive and detonate with great violence; and
  since their impetus does not cause them to bury themselves in the earth
  before they detonate, their action, though local, is very unpleasant in the
  enclosed space between two traverses in a trench.</p>

  <p>These grenades of various types are being thrown continuously by both
  sides, every assault being preluded and accompanied by showers of them. In
  fact, the wholesale use of these murderous missiles is one of the most
  prominent features of the close attack now being carried on.</p>

  <p>As may be imagined, what with sharpshooters, machine guns and bombs, this
  kind of fighting is very deadly, and somewhat blind, owing to the difficulty
  of observation.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE BRITISH
     LINE</h2>

  <p class="first">REVIEWING the situation after six months of war, it could
  not be doubted that Germany was feeling the pinch in her great struggle. In
  the West and the East she was firmly held, and in the West each day was
  adding to the strength of the Allied line, though General Joffre, patient and
  careful, was content to wait his time.</p>

  <p>At home Germany was displaying significant foresight. The Federal Council
  was empowered to take over the entire stock of bread cereals; all the grain
  and flour of the German Empire were to pass into possession of the State. In
  plain English, Germany was hoarding her food supplies, and taking steps to
  put her population on rations.</p>

  <p>The relentless pressure of our sea-power had all but cut her off from the
  world. She had suffered enormous losses upon her huge battle-fronts. The
  great effort essential to German success had so far been foiled; it was
  estimated that Germany had lost two and a quarter millions of her best
  soldiers, and that her fresh efforts would have necessarily to be made with
  greatly inferior and disheartened troops.</p>

  <p>It became more and more evident that this tremendous loss in men, combined
  with the failure of countless attacks that had been attempted in France and
  Flanders, had its effect on the moral of the enemy. Practically every attempt
  of the enemy at an offensive during the four long months that the rival
  forces had faced each other in the trenches had proved at best ineffective,
  at the worst a costly failure.</p>

  <p>The official "Eye-Witness" commented on the mental and physical change
  which had come over the German soldiers. There did appear, he wrote in the
  middle of January, a difference in the state of feeling of the German rank
  and file from that which existed some weeks previous. Prisoners now seemed to
  realise that a victorious advance was out of the question, and that all that
  they could expect was to hold their ground. The immense sacrifices the enemy
  had made had proved to be without avail, and the weary, nerve-racked
  regiments were beginning to realise it. As regards physical well-being the
  German troops were not so favourably circumstanced as our own. They were less
  warmly clad, their medical arrangements were much inferior, and the
  conditions of the trenches in the trying weather were deplorable.
  Nevertheless, they showed the greatest bravery, and it almost seemed that the
  rank and file of the army were not backward in their efforts to support the
  overwhelming ambitions of the Prussian military caste and their vainglorious
  Kaiser.</p>

  <p>Other signs of the impaired moral of the Germans were the extraordinary
  outburst of hatred against Great Britain and the despairing methods of
  warfare Germany began to adopt. There could be no doubt that at the end of
  six months of war a consciousness of ultimate impotence was beginning to come
  home to her. She was beginning to realise that her failure to end the war in
  less than six months, as she had fondly anticipated, was due to her plans
  being impossible of realisation. What was weighing heavily on the hearts of
  Germans was the sense of lost opportunity. They were face to face with
  tactical failure. There was now no question of Paris, of Calais, or of
  Warsaw. There was nothing but deadlock. And all this after the mighty efforts
  they had made, the vast losses they had suffered&mdash;losses which they had
  been prepared to make to attain success.</p>

  <p>While they were being firmly held everywhere, and every attempt at
  offensive frustrated, they could not but realise that while they must grow
  weaker and weaker, the Allies would grow in strength from day to day. Germany
  alone, amongst all the belligerents, had prepared and was ready for war. She
  was equipped with men and guns to the highest point of possibility. And now,
  after six months, although she had still probably a preponderance of men in
  the field, it was certain, with the French reserves in readiness, and the
  great new Kitchener Army almost ready to take their place in the fighting
  line, that the conditions would be equalised, nay, reversed. Not only would
  the Allies have a greater number of men and a preponderance in artillery, but
  the advantage in moral superiority.</p>

  <p>And it must be remembered that all the while Germany continued to lose
  more men than the Allies in the trench warfare. Their method was nearly
  always the same. They sent forward wave after wave of men, the invariable
  result being losses out of all proportion to any advantage gained. Sometimes
  the great pressure of men they threw forward resulted in their overwhelming
  the defenders and occupying the trenches temporarily. The vigorous
  counter-attacks of the Allies resulted in their winning back the ground which
  might have been lost. There were enormous losses on both sides, but the
  disadvantage was always on the side of the enemy. This kind of warfare was
  one of attrition and the Allies were well able to stand the test.</p>

  <p>In the Caucasus, the enemy's newest ally, Turkey, had been soundly
  trounced by the Russians, and in Egypt we had beaten off the invading Turkish
  army. In the west, everywhere, our Allies were confident that it was
  well-nigh impossible for Germany to score any decisive success. A French
  official account of the progress of operations summed up the position
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It can then be affirmed that, in order to obtain a complete success,
  France and her Allies have only to wait and prepare for it with untiring
  patience. The offensive power of the Allies, constantly reinforcing their
  Armies in strength, officers and supplies, is daily increasing, and it is
  therefore to their interest to make their maximum effort at the moment when
  they will have at their disposition the maximum of means. This is what they
  will do; all that matters is to achieve a complete result without useless
  sacrifices."</p>

  <p>Also&mdash;and this was another factor of great importance&mdash;the
  artillery of the Allies was slowly acquiring an equality with the artillery
  of the Germans. It had been the other way in the beginning, but now nearly
  every conflict of the guns showed things to be otherwise. In successive days
  of one week of fierce artillery duels, when the German expended twice as many
  projectiles as his opponent, the big French guns achieved marked successes.
  On one day they destroyed two enemy guns; on the next they demolished two
  batteries and silenced another; the day after they accounted for a battery of
  15-centimetre guns; and on the fourth day, near Béthencourt (this
  illuminating little record covers only a small section of the four hundred
  mile line), they destroyed two batteries of 77-millimetre guns. Equal in
  effectiveness was the work of the British artillery. In more than once place,
  too, it was found that the German shells were ineffective, and did not burst
  well. Over all the western battlefield, as we left the old year behind and
  came, full of hope, into the New Year, the success of our artillery was
  established.</p>

  <p>To this brief summary of how things stood there should be added a last
  word. The British and French airmen, by their initiative and daring, had
  secured the whip-hand in the air. Capable and cool, temperamentally more
  adventurous than their adversaries, the flying man of the Allies proved
  himself continually more than a match for his enemy.</p>

  <p>Every day there were instances of the courage and resource of our men, for
  hardly a day passed, whatever the conditions, that British and French airmen
  did not ascend. On more than one occasion our airmen carried out observations
  not more than a thousand feet above the enemy's trenches. British airmen
  threw bombs on the enemy's aviation camp at Linselles, and paid several
  marauding visits to Ostend, both by night and day. Only when the weather was
  clear and calm did they encounter enemy machines, and not infrequently the
  Germans fled at their approach. Very often the former would make a half turn
  immediately they perceived their more daring adversaries, but it was not
  often that a combat took place; when it did, almost invariably the French or
  British airmen came off victorious.</p>

  <p>A fine example of an aerial flight was supplied by an exploit of one of
  the French aviators in the region of Cernay. In the course of a
  reconnaissance the Frenchman gave chase to a German opponent and twice
  obliged him to make a half turn, thus preventing him from flying over the
  Allies' lines.</p>

  <p>The moment the German reached the safety of his own lines the Frenchman
  perceived another German aeroplane going towards Belfort and immediately gave
  chase. He soon came within range of the German and opened a lively fusillade,
  which was returned and kept up for a distance of 150 metres until they
  reached the environs of Mulhouse, where the German was compelled to descend
  before he was able to reach his own sheds.</p>

  <p>In the course of reconnaissances, the Allied airmen often experienced a
  fusillade from the guns of the enemy. The machines were on some occasions
  pierced by shot and by the bursting of shells, but the <i>sang-froid</i> of
  the pilots enabled them to return safely, sometimes under the most perilous
  conditions. One airman, in consequence of a mishap to his engine, was obliged
  to cross the enemy's lines at a height of 150 metres in the region of
  Hartmannsweilerkopf, which is very hilly. In spite of a fierce fire directed
  at him when crossing a wooded part, the airman gained the valley of the Thur
  and descended in the French lines safe and sound.</p>

  <p>"Eye-Witness" gave us some interesting details about the work of aerial
  reconnaissance. The observer either travels above a previously selected line
  of country, or passes to and fro over a certain area, recording everything of
  value that he sees. This latter method is the slower, and is used only when
  very detailed information is required.</p>

  <p>This is not work which can be carried out by everyone. The really
  first-rate observer must possess extensive military knowledge in order to
  know what objects to look for and where to look for them; he must have very
  good eyesight in order to pick them up, and he must have a knack of reading a
  map quickly both in order to mark correctly their positions and to find his
  way. To reconnoitre is not easy even in fine weather; but in driving rain or
  snow, in a temperature perhaps several degrees below zero, or in a gale, when
  an aeroplane travelling with the wind rocks and sways like a ship in a heavy
  sea, and may attain a speed of 150 miles an hour, the difficulties are
  immense.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances, and from the altitude at which it is necessary to
  fly in order to escape the projectiles of anti-aircraft guns, columns of
  transport or of men are easily missed. Indeed, at a first attempt an observer
  will see nothing which is of military value, for it is only after
  considerable practice that the eye becomes accustomed to scouring a great
  stretch of country from above, and acquires the power of distinguishing
  objects upon it.</p>

  <p>Psychology also comes in, and the temperament of an observer is of the
  greatest importance. He must be cool and capable of great concentration in
  order to keep his attention fixed upon his objective in spite of all
  distractions, such as, for instance, the bursts of shell close to him, or the
  noise of rifle bullets passing through the planes of his machine. He must
  withstand the temptation to make conjectures, or to think that he has seen
  something when he is not absolutely certain of the fact, since an error in
  observing or an inaccuracy in reporting may lead to false conclusions and
  cause infinite harm.</p>

  <p>Many men are absolutely unfitted for such duty, and even trained
  observers, observed "Eye-Witness," vary in their powers of
  reconnaissance.</p>

  <p>January 27th was the Kaiser's birthday. It was generally expected that to
  mark this event the Germans would attempt to gain something that would have
  the appearance of a signal victory.</p>

  <p>Not only would a German offensive success have been a pleasant offering on
  the part of the Army to the Kaiser to celebrate his fifty-sixth birthday, but
  it would have had much more important results if it had succeeded in
  heartening Berlin, where the population was beginning to be doubtful and
  dispirited.</p>

  <p>So the days immediately preceding the War Lord's birthday saw violent
  efforts by the enemy to secure a decisive victory at various points.</p>

  <p>The Kaiser himself came to the German Headquarters in France, and made a
  tour of the positions of his troops in the region of La Bassée, where very
  large forces had been concentrated, obviously with the set purpose of a
  desperate offensive movement. The presence of the Kaiser indicated clearly
  enough the importance the enemy attached to this projected effort. The first
  of the birthday honours, therefore, was to be sought for here, in the region
  of La Bassée and Festubert, where many sanguinary battles had been fought
  during these last months.</p>

  <p>The Emperor had been the witness of what the Germans called the "great
  Success" at Soissons (where, owing to the flooding of the Aisne which broke
  the communicating bridges, the French had been obliged to retire), and
  doubtless the commanders of the Northern armies, anxious that all the honour
  of visible achievements should not fall upon von Kluck's army, were desirous
  of making a show which should earn for them the same amount of praise as had
  fallen to the commander of the German forces, which, as already stated, by
  reason of the rapidly rising floods of the Aisne, had been able to push the
  French troops back across the river.</p>

  <p>About two miles from La Bassée was Festubert, a name which will be
  associated in the minds of soldiers for many years to come with one of the
  most bloody and relentless battles in which the British have been engaged.
  About Givenchy for months had ebbed and flowed the tide of battle. Even as
  the Allies had as their objective La Bassée, with its command of the road to
  Lille, so had the German, in all the efforts he has made, directed his
  attention to a town of corresponding importance&mdash;the town of Bethune, on
  the direct road to Boulogne, Calais, and the coast.</p>

  <p>The British line concerned in the birthday attack ran from Richebourg
  through Festubert, Givenchy, to Cuinchy. This line therefore straddled the
  railway between Bethune and La Bassée, and also ran astride the La Bassée
  canal, which flows within a few yards of and parallel to the railway. From
  the first, although the attack was first delivered upon Cuinchy, it was
  evident that the German's objective was the village of Givenchy. There was
  reason enough, from the strategical standpoint.</p>

  <p>Givenchy, a mining and industrial village, stands upon rising ground
  amidst a veritable dessert of mud, across which it is almost impossible to
  move infantry and quite impossible to transport guns. Commanding, as it does,
  the La Bassée road, and giving on to Bethune, the possession of Givenchy was
  a matter of the first importance, and even as the British had made
  considerable sacrifices to hold it and had driven back attack after attack
  delivered against its defences, so did the German consider it worth while to
  make even greater sacrifices in order to secure this position.</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock in the morning when, without any warning, the first
  lines of German troops suddenly emerged from their trenches and came sweeping
  across the sodden area "in waves," and secured, after desperate fighting, the
  first line of British trenches.</p>

  <p>It was a grey day. A slight mist covered the distant plains. The British
  troops were at breakfast when the first serious warning came to them that an
  attack in force was being developed. Immediately the men in the trenches
  stood to arms, and firing steadily with rifle and machine gun they cleared
  line after line of the attacker from their front, only to find that the dead
  men were replaced by others, who pressed forward shoulder to shoulder, and,
  swamping the opposition by sheer weight of numbers, poured into the trenches,
  which were only evacuated just in time.</p>

  <p>The 56th Prussian Regiment, which bore the brunt of the attack, pressed on
  to the very outskirts of the village itself, and was there met and decimated
  by an appalling fire from trench and housetop and window. None the less the
  German held on, seizing every cover, wall, and house. Every mean little house
  in the village of Givenchy had been converted into a fortress, and one
  British regiment in particular&mdash;the Gloucesters&mdash;offered a
  desperate resistance. It seemed for a while as though the Germans had
  succeeded. They had driven the British back until there stretched between the
  lines of the lost trenches and the German advance guard 300 yards of holding
  mud, which could only be crossed under heavy fire with the certainty of
  enormous loss.</p>

  <p>The attack had been sudden, almost unexpected in such strength, and
  comparatively small as was the British force that confronted the horde now
  bringing a portion of its reserves into line, it seemed likely that the
  German would consolidate his position. The British had lost their first line
  of trenches outside the village. They now lost a number of trenches which
  were closer to the village itself, and the 56th Prussians and some Pioneers
  were working gallantly to establish themselves in the village itself. The
  British regiments were on their mettle, and the commander of the forces in
  that sector, alive to all the dangers and to all the possibilities which the
  occupation of Givenchy entailed, was moving his reinforcements.</p>

  <p>And now the French to the south were taking a hand. On narrow country
  roads the transports and the ambulance, and all the impedimenta which weave
  to and fro between the base and the advance lines, were moving to the side of
  the road at a warning shout, even as London drivers will seek the kerb when
  the clang of a fire-engine bell sounds its warning.</p>

  <p>In the clear space in the middle of the road, broken by wear and sodden
  with incessant rain, battery after battery of French 75's dashed past, their
  whips cracking, the steel hooves of their horses striking fire from the flint
  <i>pavé</i>. They were flying along to take up a position which would offer
  the British support. Gun after gun, swaying and slithering through the mud,
  came into action, and to the deeper tone of the British batteries at
  Festubert, firing desperately at the advancing host of the enemy's reserves,
  were added the sharper crash of the 75 and the dull roar of its explosive
  shell. Eventually the guns hammered back the German supports and gave a
  breathing space to the battling British in the grim village of Givenchy.</p>

  <p>Givenchy was a shambles. From every window fire belched down upon the
  advancing German. Helmeted men, white-faced and bleeding, staggered to the
  protection of walls, instantly shattered by the shells of the British
  artillery, which was now firing at short range. The scream and whistle of
  flying projectiles, the incessant and deadly rattle of machine-gun fire, the
  swift exchange of shells, the crash of the bursting grenades&mdash;all these
  combined to furnish a complete pandemonium which left even experienced
  soldiers dazed and bewildered.</p>

  <p>A number of Germans at one end of the village succeeded in holding houses,
  and when the British poured back, these little dwellings became the scene of
  those silent bayonet fights which have been a remarkable feature of the
  war.</p>

  <p>Into one of these houses, held by eight Germans, went a British soldier,
  such as Kipling loves to draw. A short, discoloured clay pipe held all the
  time in the corner of his mouth, a rifle and bayonet in his strong hands, he
  fought off their combined attack, bayoneted four and took the other four
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>So close was the fighting in these houses and in the small confines of the
  apartments which ordinarily the miner of the district occupies, that often
  there was no room even for bayonet play, and men went to work with their
  fists, battering and beating their enemy to submission, or using their
  bayonets as knives, and fighting hand-to-hand. The British were irresistible.
  They swept the village clear of the enemy, and from the vantage place of the
  houses they poured such a terrible fire into their old trenches close to the
  village (the Germans had occupied these) that all who did not die under that
  terrible onslaught were glad to surrender.</p>

  <p>The end of the fight was not yet. Driven from the village, shot out of the
  trenches, the Germans came back again to the attack, not once, but in all
  five times, before the violence of the assault was shattered. In the
  brick-fields which lay about Givenchy there was a chaos of fighting, over a
  battle-ground of mud so deep in places as to be a morass.</p>

  <p>Friend and foe were mixed up in little struggling knots. Over the German
  reserve shells were bursting in increasing quantity.</p>

  <p>The French 75's in the south, the British heavy guns at Festubert in the
  north, concentrated their fire upon the thick grey masses, which lay waiting
  the opportunity and the means of throwing their weight into the scale.</p>

  <p>There was no way up to the village across the plain. This was no more than
  a quagmire, into which men sank to their knees and often to their necks. It
  was the La Bassée road or nothing, and upon the La Bassée road every British
  gun was concentrated. It mattered not to them that, farther to the east, the
  heavy German batteries had come into action and were sending their shrieking
  messengers of death towards the French and British artillery positions.
  Undaunted, undismayed, when bursting shell wrecked and scattered gun and
  limber, the artillery stuck to their work, pumping fire upon the road up
  which the German supports vainly endeavoured to move, and only relaxing their
  attention to this road when it became necessary to silence a too venturesome
  German battery which had exposed itself beyond the safety point.</p>

  <p>The retirement of the British before Givenchy had forced the French line
  farther south, to bend back in sympathy. At Vermelles, gained at such
  sacrifice, the French held on. At Festubert in the north the British line was
  hardly affected.</p>

  <p>The first attack had developed before Cuinchy, and this was merely the
  prelude to the more serious attack upon the main position. In the struggle
  which ended in the final victory of the British, many are the stories of
  individual heroism and of splendid courage in the face of extraordinary and
  terrifying circumstances. One soldier, who was caught in the trenches at
  Cuinchy and was unable to make his escape before the avalanche of German
  infantry poured into the trench, succeeded, in spite of an occasional bayonet
  prod from the enemy, in shamming dead during all the time they occupied the
  British trench. When they flowed out to their final attack upon the village,
  leaving the empty trench untenanted, as they thought, save for the bodies of
  their dead comrades, this man opened a brisk fire into the backs of the
  advancing Germans and fought off a patrol which was sent back to dispose of
  him. A British armoured train, moving westward at the first hint of the
  attack, brought its naval guns into action, and added to the din of
  bombardment to which the German was subjected.</p>

  <p>For three hours the fate of the British 1st Division in that sector hung
  in the balance. Not only the fate of the British integrity line, but the
  conformation of the whole of the Allies' line from the Lys to the Somme was
  largely dependent upon the superhuman efforts of the British. In this region,
  on a previous occasion, the German masses had succeeded in driving the
  Indians from their trenches, which were only regained after bloody fighting.
  It was at Givenchy and Festubert that our men had, once before, fought their
  way forward, house by house, and succeeded in pushing back the Germans. As
  they had succeeded then, so they succeeded now.</p>

  <p>The British had therefore a painful knowledge of the difficulties to be
  overcome in this part of the field, and so far profited by the lessons which
  earlier fighting had taught them that they did not give an inch of ground
  away which was not necessary. At eleven o'clock in the morning the German
  attack had reached its zenith, and it was now evident to the British
  commander that he had no reason to fear that a complete occupation of his
  position would follow the German attack. His supports and his reinforcements
  were being hurried forward. Bethune was sending out long columns of troops.
  Reserves, including the London Scottish, were following these.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock the British commander had the position so well in hand that
  he decided upon his counter-attack.</p>

  <p>Five violent attacks had been made by the German before he established
  himself on the outskirts of Givenchy. One single attack&mdash;steady,
  persistent and relentless&mdash;drove him back to his trenches, and placed
  the British, not, it is true, in the position which they had occupied in the
  morning and which had been rendered untenable and had broken up by their own
  shell fire, but in a new line of trenches only a very short distance behind
  these.</p>

  <p>Knee-deep through mud and water and quicksand, the British ploughed back
  slowly, unconcerned by the fury of the fire which the German was now
  directing towards him. As the British advanced towards Cuinchy, so did the
  French on our right move forward to re-occupy the line, from which they had
  not indeed been driven. They had voluntarily sacrificed it in order that
  their front should conform the more closely with ours.</p>

  <p>The German, in his advance, as in his retirement, had been handicapped by
  the fact that along the main line of his movement towards his objective ran
  the length of La Bassée canal, so that his forces were separated by this
  waterway, and were so acting independently one of the other. Caught by our
  machine-guns upon this stretch of road, the Germans to the south of the canal
  suffered perhaps even more severely than those who had been engaged in the
  abortive attempt to carry Givenchy by assault.</p>

  <p>Such was the outcome of the most important effort to signalise the
  Kaiser's birthday. Another and also a very desperate effort was made at
  Ypres.</p>

  <p>Against Ypres, battered and bruised, scarred and maimed by enemy shells,
  the full force of the German reserves in Flanders was mustered, and a grand
  attack was commenced on January 25th. This was no new ground to the German.
  He had made since the beginning of the trench war a succession of violent
  assaults upon this position; he had sent his Prussian Guards and his
  overwhelming divisions to swamp the remnant of the 7th British Division,
  which, hastily entrenched before that town, had succeeded in throwing back an
  enemy five times his strength.</p>

  <p>If he had failed against that attenuated line, he was less likely to
  succeed now when the trenches before and to the north of Ypres were held
  thickly by some of the best regiments in the French Army, supported by their
  deadly 75's. Nevertheless, such was the inspiring influence of the highest
  War Lord that the attempt was made, and great masses of troops were brought
  up, and in the early morning the inevitable artillery pounding began. Every
  piece that could be brought into play was directed towards the French
  trenches. Howitzers, "coal- boxes," field guns, mines, mortars, and the whole
  arsenal of German artillery began this furious and nerve-racking bombardment.
  This lasted for an hour, at the end of which time the position was considered
  to be prepared for immediate attack; the grey lines of German infantry,
  scrambling from their trenches and supported by masses of reserves, came
  straight for the French defences.</p>

  <p>In describing this battle, the writer of the French <i>communiqué</i> used
  a phrase which, by its very vividness and because of the picture it conveys,
  is at once arresting and ineffaceable. He said, "The attack was stopped
  dead." In this brief sentence is told the story of the German failure.</p>

  <p>Met by concentrated rifle and machine-gun fire of extraordinary ferocity
  and fury, the Kaiser's legions melted away long before they were near enough
  to deliver their attack by bayonet, and after a painful period of hesitation,
  broke and retired, leaving the ground before the French line covered with
  dead. Thus this other attempt at a birthday honour ended in disaster.</p>

  <p>There was still more to come.</p>

  <p>Not unmindful of the significance of the day, the British greeted the dawn
  of the 27th with a shower of lyddite shells, directed against a house near
  the village of Messines, which had been marked down by the British commander
  for early destruction. This house had evidently been used as a store for hand
  grenades and for artillery ammunition, for the explosion of the "birthday
  shells" against this house was followed by a succession of minor explosions
  as the bombs in the store went off, and this appropriate display of fireworks
  represented the final British contribution to the festivities of the
  Emperor's natal day.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE TAKING OF NEUVE CHAPELLE</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE already dealt with the situation at the end of six
  months of war. Lord Kitchener told us in a speech in the House of Lords that
  the water-logged state of the trenches, combined with bad weather, had
  necessarily restricted the work of the army to trench warfare. For several
  weeks more a period of seeming inaction prevailed.</p>

  <p>The brief bulletins had little to tell; one day a trench was captured, the
  next another was successfully mined. A day later a gain of 100 yards or so
  might be recorded, and occasionally the communique informed us frankly that
  there was "nothing to report." In Flanders in particular, this was the
  condition of things throughout February. Notwithstanding, the men were ready
  and eager to move.</p>

  <p>What were the British doing before La Bassée and in the neighbourhood of
  Ypres? So far as the German knew&mdash;nothing. Such of his daring scouts as
  crossed the area saw little to arouse the apprehension of the most timid of
  commanders.</p>

  <p>Had they travelled by night, with means to pierce the darkness, they would
  have seen long ammunition trains moving swiftly from the coast, along roads
  which were kept clear; they would have seen battery after battery of
  artillery moving across country; they would have watched great naval guns and
  howitzer batteries being established in their places.</p>

  <p>The nights were full of feverish activity. Sweating men in their shirt-
  sleeves, despite the cold, worked at top speed, loading and unloading shells,
  whilst thousands of motor-wagons came swiftly through the night to various
  points, deposited their deadly loads and went back again. Well in the rear
  the field batteries were putting the final touch to gun and harness.
  Somewhere in the rear, too, the reserve corps were making very careful
  preparations for the struggle ahead.</p>

  <p>On March 8, when the Champagne battle was reaching its critical point, the
  British showed their hand. South of Ypres, from the village of St. Éloi and
  along that section of the line which runs south past Armentières, they began
  a cannonading of no unusual intensity, but serious enough to direct the
  attention of the German to this portion of the line. The German sent up
  support in anticipation of the inevitable assault, yet the events of that
  Monday took no more exciting shape than this intermittent and, for the
  British, strangely economical bombardment which went on all along his
  front.</p>

  <p>There was also some evidence of activity in the region of Neuve Chapelle.
  Here, however, the German commander thought he detected nothing more serious
  than a very natural desire on the part of the commander of this section to
  engage the attention of the German left flank. Neuve Chapelle had been well
  organised for defence. It was a bastion thrust into the British lines, and
  had been the scene of terrible fighting, until the German on this section had
  asserted, by weight of numbers and heaviness of metal, his superiority over
  his enemy. Yet the British could not be wholly thrown back, had clung to the
  end of the village and waited, hungry-eyed, for the moment when they would
  again hold its walls. Obviously it could not be from here that danger
  threatened, and as that cannonading increased in vigour from Ypres and the
  southern line, the tendency of the German was shown in a general tightening
  up to confront attack from that quarter.</p>

  <p>Monday and Tuesday, March 8 and 9, were thus passed with the thunder of
  guns rolling down the line, loudest from behind St. Éloi, and more feeble and
  tapering off to spasmodic explosions where the line curved inward to the
  westward of Neuve Chapelle and continued to Festubert and Givenchy.
  Wednesday, March 10, broke, a cloudy yet fairly pleasant morn, and it began,
  as usual, in the neighbourhood of Neuve Chapelle with a scattering exchange
  of shots between the outlying trenches and the steady "klik-klok" of the
  German snipers' rifles. On the enemy's side, as on the British side, the men
  went to their breakfast as though this day formed merely one in a seemingly
  endless routine of trench warfare.</p>

  <p>"We had an extra ration of sausage that morning," said a German prisoner
  ruefully, "and our captain told us that there would be little to do, so we
  sat down to play a game of cards, leaving the usual number of look-out men to
  warn us of danger. I had a peep over the parapet. I could see a blue curl of
  smoke rising from behind the British trenches, and I said to my friend:
  'These Englanders have their breakfast very late.' The scene was quite
  peaceful, though very sad."</p>

  <p>It was to be less peaceful and a great deal more sad for the German Army
  that day. Somewhere between half-past seven and eight o'clock in the morning
  a single gun from the British lines crashed, and a shrapnel shell came
  shrieking overhead, to burst before the very centre of the main German
  trench. It was followed at an interval by the boom of a heavy gun in the
  distance. The shell fell a little short. There was a long interval and then
  another boom, and the shriek of an oncoming shell; this time it fell beyond
  the trench. Again there was a pause, and then the third heavy shell burst,
  this time at the exact distance before the trench, blowing in the trench and
  killing half-a-dozen men.</p>

  <p>There was just an interval of time to allow the unseen observer to signal
  back the result of a shot, and then, in the language of a British officer,
  "hell broke loose." The whole of the British line seemed to burst of a sudden
  into flame. Flames leaped from farm and ridge, from hollow, from cover of
  wood, from sunken road, from hedge, parapet and fieldwork. It was a flare of
  fire fringing a hundred trenches; it was a fire which came bubbling
  impatiently from machine- gun batteries, and the German infantrymen,
  crouching in their trenches terrified, counted the shells bursting in their
  immediate vicinity and found they averaged one in every ten seconds.</p>

  <p>Rising to a climax this bombardment by 150 guns became appalling. The
  shrieking of the shells in the air, their explosion and the continuous
  thunder of the batteries all merged into one great volume of sound. The
  discharge of the guns was so rapid that they sounded like the fire of
  gigantic machine gun. During the 35 minutes it continued our men could show
  themselves freely and even walk about in perfect safety. German prisoners
  also confessed that they had never experienced such a bombardment as that
  which preceded the assault on Neuve Chapelle.</p>

  <p>One wounded Prussian officer of a particularly offensive and truculent
  type, which is not uncommon, expressed the greatest contempt for this method
  of bombarding. "You do not fight. You murder," he said: "If it had been
  straightforward honest fighting we should have beaten you; but we never had a
  chance from the first. There was a shell every ten yards. Nothing could live
  in such a fire."</p>

  <p>This feeling of resentment against our artillery, according to the
  official "Eye-Witness," was shown by several of the prisoners. "Gratifying as
  it is to our gunners, it is an exhibition of a curious lack of any judicial
  sense or even of a rudimentary sense of humour on the part of the apostles of
  frightfulness." It was the Germans who prepared an overwhelming force of
  artillery before the war, and they were the first to apply the concentrated
  action of heavy guns in field warfare. When the tables are turned and they
  have their first taste of what we have often eaten they actually have the
  effrontery to complain.</p>

  <p>During the terrific bombardment the fire from the German trenches entirely
  ceased. The men dared not come over the parapet for fear of the consequences.
  They crouched in the bottom with commendable caution, listening open-eyed to
  the frantic pandemonium. Those of them who were seen immediately after the
  battle were hypnotised&mdash;half mad with terror and frenzy. It is said that
  there were no fewer than 150 guns working at top speed during this terrific
  onslaught.</p>

  <p>"The earth shook as though there was a storm," said an Indian officer
  watching this display. "It was as if the mountains were sliding and monsters
  were struggling in the earth."</p>

  <p>The Indians held one section of the British trenches. They had not lost
  their dart despite the terrible hardships which a winter campaign entailed
  upon men who were born and bred in a torrid clime. They waited as impatiently
  as any for the word "Go!" and presently the firing ceased and the signal for
  attack was given. Over the ground, unswept by rifle fire as yet&mdash;for the
  enemy were still shaken and dazed with terror and did not realise that the
  bombardment had ceased&mdash;there swept a giant wave of khaki, bristling
  with bayonets; wave after wave of men surged forward crashing through the
  barbed wire into the first line of trenches. Here the fight was short.
  Upraised hands and ashen faces told the story of the terrific bombardment to
  which they had previously been subjected.</p>

  <p>"Our men checked to kill," said an observer, "and went on."</p>

  <p>In less than half-an-hour almost the whole elaborate series of German
  trenches was in our hands. Except at one point there was little resistance,
  for the trenches, which in places were literally blotted out, were filled
  with dead and dying, buried in earth and debris, and the majority of the
  survivors were in no mood for further fighting.</p>

  <p>In an extraordinarily short space of time the village of Neuve Chapelle,
  which the enemy had held since the end of October, was taken. The grimy
  gunners, watching from their positions, saw the infantrymen swamp the advance
  trenches, heard the crackle of rifle fire in the village itself, and knew
  that they had done their work well. The village was in our hands. We were
  beyond the church tower, that landmark, and save at one point had swept the
  environs free of the enemy. That one point, which resisted with desperate
  gallantry, was locally known as "Port Arthur"; and it was a strongly
  organised defensive position which defied for a time every effort the British
  made to take it. Finally, at half-past five in the afternoon the men in
  khaki, not to be denied, carried this last stronghold at the point of the
  bayonet.</p>

  <p>The British corps had encircled Neuve Chapelle, and Germans, fighting in
  the street&mdash;and fighting with great gallantry&mdash;retired only to find
  their exit blocked by masses of British troops which had come round on the
  outskirts of the village and were now holding the outlet. A great number of
  Germans surrendered, and thousands were killed during the day. Nevertheless,
  the British had to meet two vigorous counter-attacks, for now the railway
  lines in the rear of the German front were working at top pressure, reserves
  pouring into the German line, and large numbers of the men who had been
  concentrated near Ypres were brought down post-haste to stiffen the shattered
  regiments.</p>

  <p>By nightfall we were in possession of all the enemy's trenches, on a front
  of 4,000 yards, representing an advance of more than 1,200 yards from our
  original trenches at the furthest point.</p>

  <p>This was on Wednesday, the 10th, and throughout that night and on the
  following morning the fighting continued. Along the whole front around the
  village and to the north of it, the German delivered attack after attack.
  "Men fell in swathes," said a witness. "Whole companies melted away before
  the British machine-gun fire and before the heavy artillery firing which met
  them sometimes at point-blank range."</p>

  <p>Far away to the right, the French, not to be debarred from participation,
  brought their artillery into action, covered the road up which reinforcements
  must pass, shelled the enemy convoys and batteries as they moved to the
  front, and rendered that splendid assistance which we have always expected
  from our brave Ally and have invariably received. The German effort was
  grimly determined. On one part of the line they gained a trench, but were
  immediately surrounded and the whole of the occupants were captured. The
  British gave the enemy no rest. Sweeping out beyond the village, they
  captured a mill, and such was the exhaustion of the German troops that here
  as elsewhere whole companies surrendered. The Germans had fought a gallant
  fight. The village itself was a shambles, thickly covered with the dead of
  attacker and defender, and men were found who had gone completely mad under
  the strain of bombardment. This may explain some of the atrocious deeds which
  the enemy committed&mdash;the stabbing of a Royal Army Medical Corps man
  whilst he was bandaging a wounded German; the shooting of British wounded
  which an officer described, and which he said was but one of a hundred
  instances; and the ferocity of the counter-attacks which were delivered again
  and again, but always unsuccessfully, against the British lines.</p>

  <p>"By nightfall," wrote the official Eye-Witness, "the German dead lay thick
  all along the front. Opposite the sector south of the village there were more
  than 2,000 bodies; and in front of one battalion east of the village
  stretched 500 more. The ground in these places sloped upwards from our
  trenches towards the enemy, and the corpses could be plainly seen and
  counted. These figures do not include the large number killed in the village
  of Neuve Chapelle itself&mdash; where many bodies lay buried amongst the
  ruins and hidden among the fallen masonry&mdash;nor behind the line occupied
  by us."</p>

  <p>The night of the 12th passed more or less quietly, and at dawn on the 13th
  there was a repetition of the German tactics, great masses of infantry being
  put to the British position, only to be swept away by machine-gun and rifle
  fire. To the east of the village of Neuve Chapelle is a little wood known as
  the Bois du Biez, one of those abrupt plantations partaking of the nature of
  a very large copse, very useful to a belligerent for concealing the movements
  of troops and for screening from observation his gun positions. It served him
  in this case since he was able to concentrate new reserves and debouch them
  on to the British line. Here, however, his purpose was foiled by a
  concentration of fire which first checked, then stopped, and finally drove
  the supports back in disorderly confusion. Again the British gunners came to
  the rescue and swept one small area clear, that area being the ground over
  which the German reserves were passing or must pass.</p>

  <p>"The artillery were dropping the shells just where they wanted them," said
  one of our officers. "It was as though they were at target practice, and each
  battery was competing for a prize. An artillery observer who was standing by
  me said that no fewer than six batteries were all dropping shells in an area
  represented by a circle with a diameter of 20 yards!"</p>

  <p>Yet the Germans were continuing in haste to send troops forward. The
  railways behind their front were kept busy day and night. The little town of
  Don, which is an important railway junction from a strategical point of view,
  was the scene of the greatest activity in this region; but if the German
  general was to depend upon the troops which came through this small nodal
  point, he was to receive a shock, for British airmen came swiftly from the
  skies, dropped their high explosive bombs on the station and completely
  wrecked the junction. It is possible that it was here that the German general
  who had control of the whole of the railway organisation in the West was
  killed. A similar attack was made upon the junction at Douai, with excellent
  results.</p>

  <p>Saturday the 13th, saw the British in firm occupation of the village of
  Neuve Chapelle. Where the line had sagged it now bulged, and we may suppose
  that on their newly gained ground the British artillery was making new gun
  positions, for from here it was possible to shell one of the communications
  leading to La Bassée.</p>

  <p>On Sunday the attacks ceased, The German general had realised the
  impossibility of pushing the British back from Neuve Chapelle, and he must
  devise a method by which he could bring about a sympathetic retirement,
  without again facing those awful defences which had been created in a night
  before the ruined village. Mention has already been made of a concentration
  of troops somewhere in the neighbourhood of St. Éloi. Undoubtedly a portion
  of these were employed in some of the counter-attacks upon Neuve
  Chapelle.</p>

  <p>There was, at any rate, a large force available for employment on the St.
  Éloi front; and on the Sunday morning the German, imitating the tactics of
  the British, opened a furious bombardment upon our troops defending this
  village and delivered a surprise attack, blowing in the first line of
  trenches and driving the defenders to the western end of St. Éloi. This
  occurred just before dark, and the German general hoped, by reaching his new
  position before darkness set in, to utilise the friendly cover of the night
  to organise a defence which would prevent the British retaking the ground
  without weakening the line before Neuve Chapelle. If he imagined that a night
  attack held any terror for the British, who are the designers of night
  attacks, he had learned little from our military history and nothing at all
  from the war.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock in the morning the British counter-attack was organised
  and dispatched. The night was misty, and the scene of the assault upon the
  village was one of the most picturesque that had been seen on the Western
  side. By the light of blazing houses great columns of men emerged from the
  darkness and flung themselves upon the barricades which the Germans had
  erected in the streets of St. Éloi itself. By daylight our men had retaken
  all they had lost, and the grey of dawn broke upon this terrible little
  village where dead men lay in every conceivable position, and where the dull,
  red glow of burning buildings spoke eloquently of that awful night's
  work.</p>

  <p>The British had retaken the village; they had re-occupied most of the
  trenches to the east of the village, and all those that were not re-occupied
  by us were either broken up or untenanted by the enemy. This German attack,
  which was delivered in considerable force and was designed to throw back the
  British line to where it had been before they advanced through Neuve
  Chapelle, had proved a costly failure.</p>

  <p>Altogether the German losses in four days' fighting were estimated at
  18,000.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE FIGHT FOR HILL 60</h2>

  <p class="first">THE battle of Neuve Chapelle, heroic and decisive as it was,
  could not be regarded as anything more than an important local success; just
  as the battle of Soissons in February, proclaimed as a great victory by the
  Germans, was but a local defeat of the French.</p>

  <p>The affair of Neuve Chapelle was a battle on a big scale, and in any
  previous war it would have proved something of a decisive event with
  far-reaching results. But now, so enormous was the field of operations and
  the number of combatants engaged, that beyond demonstrating the increased
  power of our artillery and the fervour and fighting spirit of our troops,
  beyond marking an advance of some two miles over a front of four miles, and
  wresting from the enemy a strongly fortified strategical position, our
  victory, as regards immediate results, was simply a local defeat for the
  Germans with the infliction of heavy losses. Nevertheless it might prove to
  be a landmark in the campaign, just as the battle of Ypres marked an epoch in
  the war.</p>

  <p>The lull in the Carpathians decided the Kaiser's advisers. News came that
  all railway traffic between Belgium and Holland was to be held up; that the
  frontier was to be closed. And there trickled through to the neutral
  countries many rumours to the effect that large bodies of troops were being
  poured through the Rhine provinces into Belgium, and that in Western Germany
  all passenger traffic had been disorganised in consequence. This could only
  mean one thing. General Joffre and Field-Marshal French were not taken by
  surprise. In all probability they had news of the coming of these new forces
  long before the German gave the world a hint as to his intentions by closing
  the frontier. It was the expected effort&mdash;the effort anticipated in the
  early part of the year, and deferred because of the pressing engagement which
  the German Army had elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Obviously, this new activity affected the British and the Belgians more
  than it did the French. Only a small portion of the French Army was in
  Flanders, holding the line which curved round from Nieuport to Ypres, and
  this portion was the connecting link between the Belgian and the British
  armies. The French force farther south would not feel the pressure of any new
  German formations for a considerable time.</p>

  <p>Ypres lay on the way from Germany, and Ypres was one of those sentimental
  points of conquest which the German had set himself to secure. For months,
  battles had waged with intermittent violence along this sector. Indeed, ever
  since the gallant 7th Division had, with its attenuated line, held off attack
  after attack delivered by the flower of German infantry, silence had not
  reigned in this tragic area.</p>

  <p>South of Ypres the German had established himself for a few hours, after
  Neuve Chapelle had been taken, in St. Éloi, only to be driven out from that
  village and back to his stronghold, which was marked on the map as Hill 60.
  Hill 60, lies to the south-east of the village of Zillebeke, which might be
  described as a suburb village of Ypres. In a country which is remarkable for
  its flatness, Hill 60, although it stands less than 200 feet high, was an
  important eminence, of great value to the enemy for purposes of artillery
  observation. It commanded a view of Menin, dominated the village of Gheluvelt
  to its left, and the two main roads from Ypres to Menin and from Menin to
  Roulers. The German had originally occupied "60 metre hill," after we had
  been forced to loose our hold upon Gheluvelt, the village which, the readers
  will remember, was the scene of such extraordinary house-to-house fighting,
  wherein the Worcester Regiment covered itself with glory.</p>

  <p>Although little more than a gentle swell in the ground, as "Eye-Witness"
  told us, Hill 60 was the highest part of the ridge, and had formed the scene
  of desperate fighting in the past, British, German and French having all
  contested it.</p>

  <p>Throughout November, December and January, this section of the Allied
  front was held by the French, and during that time the hill changed hands
  more than once, but the final result, when the line was again occupied by us
  in February, was that the German still held the crest.</p>

  <p>For the British to take that Hill by assault, to advance across a mined
  plain, entrenched and swept by massed batteries of machine-guns, would have
  entailed greater sacrifice of life than had been experienced in any battle in
  which the British had been engaged during the war.</p>

  <p>The German method of attack in such a case was the obvious method. But the
  German method is not that of the British. Against such a position the German
  would hurl massed troops. Shoulder to shoulder in close dense formation he
  would have sent his grey-coats and would have watched them melt away under
  the spraying fire of the Maxims, without remorse and without any doubt or
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"The British sacrifice material, but they do not sacrifice men," wrote a
  French officer. "If a motor-car does not fire properly they throw it away and
  use a new one. If a motor-cycle requires some repair they put it on the old
  iron heap and take a new one. If there is any doubt as to whether they ought
  to supply rations for 6,000 or 7,000, they supply rations for 10,000. But
  they are very jealous for their men, and do not know the word 'Kismet' where
  human lives are concerned. They say that money is nothing and that life is
  everything."</p>

  <p>Hussar tactics are admirable. Dash and initiative and the high, hot
  courage of battle are to be commended. But there is another quality in war
  which counts more than any, and that is patience combined with
  perseverance.</p>

  <p>The battle line had settled down to the conventional exchanges of shells
  and bullets. The British had established themselves on the outer edges of
  Neuve Chapelle and St. Éloi and had entrenched themselves more strongly than
  ever, maintaining their place in the line, and it seemed that after the heavy
  casualties which they had sustained in the two battles they were content to
  sit down waiting for the first move to come from the German.</p>

  <p>Hill 60, looming up in the near distance, ringed with steel and fire,
  forbidding and menacing, confronted the irregular trench lines which the
  British occupied. Sniper shot at sniper; great guns, masked by the hill, sent
  their shrieking messengers of death at irregular intervals; but for long no
  evidence of unusual activity would have been observed on either side.</p>

  <p>"From my look-out," wrote a friend to the present writer, "I see a zig-zag
  trench occupied by Tommies. At regular intervals in the trench there are
  watchers peering through the spy-hole in the steel plates which are provided
  to guard the observer. Four of the men are playing cards, two or three are
  grouped together in an animated discussion. They are dressed in all sorts of
  nondescript headgear, for the day is fairly cold, with slight showers of
  rain. Before the trench a few poor, weakling trees are standing. And a few,
  snapped in two by shell-fire as though broken across a giant's knee, lie
  across the trench and are used for fuel.</p>

  <p>"To the right are the remains of what was once a prosperous farmhouse, and
  now consists of three walls, blackened with smoke; whilst in front of us is a
  triple line of barbed wire, against which a dead and bloated cow lies, her
  stiff legs pointing up into the air. Farther to the front are more remnants
  of houses, a few gaunt walls and a shattered church tower; whilst between
  that and our trench is an irregular scar in the earth. This is a German
  trench line.</p>

  <p>"Overhead, sailing like a majestic bird, is an English biplane, pursued by
  a little puff of white smoke from the enemy anti-aircraft guns. But the pilot
  doesn't seem to bother, and when he might come down in perfect safety to our
  own lines, he turns his machine and goes sailing back the way he came, these
  spiteful little woolly balls bursting left, right, but always below him.</p>

  <p>"He reminds me of nothing so much as a bantam cock strutting around
  looking for a fight, and the angry purr of his engine comes to me like the
  deep and continuous growl of a dog&mdash;if you will pardon the rapid
  exchange of metaphor.</p>

  <p>"Save for this restless 'klik-klok!' and the booming of guns and the
  occasional whine of a shell as it passes over us, seeking for our howitzer
  batteries in the rear, the scene is peaceful enough, and you might not
  believe that we had a terrible battle here a little time ago, but for the
  fact that between our trench and the German's lie dozens of little dark heaps
  which once were German soldiers. How small a man is when he's dead."</p>

  <p>Yet, despite this seeming calmness, the British were preparing for
  trouble. Mining operations were in progress. Underneath this trench which my
  friend so graphically described, and all unknown to the men who occupied it,
  stealthy work was going on. Far away in the rear, where the ground dropped
  down a little, men had dug an opening in the side of the slope. They had dug
  all day and all night, and gradually they had disappeared from view. The
  working party had first a dozen, and then another dozen had come, and then
  more men, with timber and with mine props, and they had disappeared into the
  black cavity to make firm the ground which had been dug out.</p>

  <p>Then the diggers began to arrive in companies.</p>

  <p>There was a great deal of earth to remove. As fast as the men at the head
  end of the tunnel cut through the soft earth, others shovelled it backward,
  yet others continued the passing until the earth they displaced reached the
  mouth of the tunnel and daylight. You may, if you give your imagination full
  rein, see plank roads laid in this earth gallery, and ceaseless trains of men
  with wheel-barrows filled with earth moving back to the mouth. You may
  picture all the subterfuge, all the secrecy and all the devices which were
  necessary to hide the work, so that no inkling of it should come to the
  watchful enemy.</p>

  <p>Officers of the Royal Engineers planned and directed the work, organising
  the shifts and arranging by compass and instrument the direction the tunnel
  should take. What difficulties this mining party had we have not heard. We do
  not know of the unexpected things it encountered, of the detours it had to
  make to avoid this obstruction or the other. We only know that upon a certain
  day the Engineers found themselves under the side of Hill 60. Thereupon they
  began to construct transverse galleries, and to bring in the packages of
  dynamite or gun- cotton necessary for the great work in hand.</p>

  <p>And all the time sniping was going on overhead, the tiny attacks and
  counter- attacks, the night alarm, the bomb-throwings, and the thousand and
  one incidents which accompany modern warfare. Whilst men sweated in the
  depths of the earth their comrades in the air had not been idle. The British
  airman had established his ascendancy to a remarkable extent from the very
  beginning of the war. He had done this by sheer bravery&mdash;if one searched
  a book of synonyms from end to end one would not find a more appropriate word
  to describe the case than this word, bald as it is.</p>

  <p>"Whenever we see a German aeroplane we attack it. If an airman sees two he
  attacks the two. We never expect a challenge, for the simple reason that the
  German has now come to such a pass that he never challenges. When we talk of
  ascendancy over the German, that is what we mean. The German is frightened of
  us in the air."</p>

  <p>While the final touches were being put to the deadly little underground
  chambers beneath Hill 60, a striking proof of this ascendancy was seen. A
  British aeroplane engaged in reconnaissance espied a German rival in the
  distance. Oblivious to the peppering shells which were now coming up from the
  German anti-aircraft guns, the pilot at once turned his machine in the
  direction of his enemy. The German attempted to escape, but was headed off.
  He swept down to his own lines, but the British airman came after him, the
  observer shooting all the time at the petrol tank of his enemy. Then the
  German must have lost his nerve, for he started climbing again, and headed
  for the British lines, the British airman close in pursuit and climbing after
  him. The two armies stood still and watched this combat in the air. At last a
  shot from the British airman disabled the engine of the German, and he came
  gliding to earth behind the British lines. His foe alighted only a few feet
  from where the German had descended.</p>

  <p>During this period, in two or three days, five aeroplanes were either
  driven down from the upper regions by British and French airmen, or were shot
  down by the soldiers in the trenches.</p>

  <p>Whilst these local combats, of such dramatic interest to the men, who
  themselves lived in an atmosphere of drama, were being fought out, the
  greater business of the air service was being carried forward. Aeroplanes
  climbed up from the British lines to a height which precluded any danger from
  shell fire, and winged their way across country, making no attempt en route
  to disturb the equanimity of local forces. They were seeking for bigger game:
  for junctions packed with trains, for railway sidings filled with troops, for
  masses of infantry and artillery marching across country, and for those new
  formations as to the movements of which whispers had already reached the
  Headquarters Staff. They circled the Belgian border, they even penetrated to
  above German territory; they saw trains and camps, great motor convoys,
  batteries of guns, and came winging back to the British Headquarters with
  news that the enemy was indeed moving in strength against the thin line which
  Belgian and French and British were holding against the German advance on
  Calais. An official despatch told us that our airmen had on one day bombarded
  seven railway junctions with effect.</p>

  <p>For the reader to understand all that the coming attack on Hill 60
  signified, he must appreciate something of the objectives of modern
  warfare.</p>

  <p>No longer does a wise General consider such things as geographical or
  political frontiers. That is to say, he is not greatly concerned, depressed,
  or elated by the fact that he is fighting in any particular geographical
  position, whether he be in his own country or in the territory of the enemy.
  The true frontiers in time of war are represented by the line which your
  enemy holds. Advantage is gained when that "frontier" is pierced, and when
  the terrain which is in his possession is in turn occupied by you. That is
  one point. The next point is almost as important: to obtain the
  initiative&mdash;that is to say, make your enemy's movements conform to
  yours&mdash;and at the same time produce, by that initiative, an offensive on
  his part which will bring him against your entrenched position.</p>

  <p>Just as a clever boxer will allow his adversary to tire himself out in
  fruitless attacks, reserving his own strength to deal a knock-out blow, so
  does a modern General welcome any opportunity of provoking attack upon the
  part of his enemy. Especially does he welcome it when he has the advantage in
  numbers, in moral and in material.</p>

  <p>It would seem that Field-Marshal Sir John French deliberately set out to
  engage the attention of all these extra bodies which were coming down into
  Flanders, and that he regarded the moment as propitious for the attraction of
  these large enemy forces. You may provoke attack on the part of your enemy by
  carrying his position at great sacrifice, by general assault. You lose a very
  large number of men in comparison with the number your enemy loses; but if
  you can gain your ground your object is half achieved, because he cannot
  leave you in undisputed possession and must return and deliver an offensive
  in as great force as you have employed to take the stronghold, and he must
  suffer losses corresponding to those which were endured by you when you
  delivered the attack which placed you in possession of the enemy's
  position.</p>

  <p>The Field-Marshal had no desire to make great sacrifices. Propitious as
  the moment was, he could see no advantage which might be gained which would
  correspond to the losses he must endure. You may be sure that all the plans
  for the taking of Hill 60 were long since made, and the coming of the new
  formations fairly accurately timed.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the week which ended on April 17, the enemy before St.
  Éloi began to grow a little restive, and to give indication of a renewal of
  activity. News of the driving of a mine towards their main position had
  leaked through to the German lines; but exactly to where that mine passage
  was leading the enemy could have no accurate information.</p>

  <p>Had his airman been able to serve him as well as the British airmen served
  our own army, he could have learnt perhaps of troops moving up in the
  neighbourhood of St. Éloi. At any rate, to meet our attack the Germans had
  busied themselves with preparing a few counter-mines, and these were
  exploded, not beneath the trenches confronting Hill 60, but farther south in
  the neighbourhood of Givenchy.</p>

  <p>This was an ill-judged effort, greeted by our troops with ironical cheers,
  and no damage was done.</p>

  <p>On the morning of Saturday, the 17th, there were the customary exchanges,
  and a certain amount of local excitement was created by the destruction of
  one of the enemy's <i>Minenwerfer</i>, which was finished off by a howitzer
  battery. There was, too, yet another pretty fight in the air (the hero of
  which was Garros, the French airman), with tragic results to the German
  pilot, who was killed, and to the German observer who, by means of the dual
  control, brought the aeroplane safely to the British lines. That day our own
  airmen were exercising unusual vigilance. Otherwise, a bold observer, able to
  keep the British sentinels of the air at bay, would have seen the British
  trenches packed with men, as full as they could possibly hold, every reserve
  and support trench equally well occupied, and would have discovered, with the
  exercise of some prescience, evidence that something unusual was going
  forward.</p>

  <p>The soldiers in the trenches themselves knew very little of what was
  coming. The officers went their rounds, seeing that each man was ready to
  attack, that the reserves of ammunition were to hand, and that the men were
  supplied with the rations they would require. There was an electric feeling
  in the air and knowledge that something unusual was going forward, and these
  men of ours, lying in the parapets, waited for the word "Go!"</p>

  <p>The chill of evening had come. The east was already growing to a dull dun,
  when those who were looking toward Hill 60 saw an enormous fountain of earth
  and debris leap suddenly from its side, so that the hill was obscured in a
  fog of dust and smoke, saw a bright flicker as of lightning, and felt the
  earth shake and tremble beneath their feet in the terrifying roar of an
  explosion. Seven of the mines we had laid with such care had been fired
  simultaneously under the German trenches.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" roared the commanding officer in one section of the trench, and
  the men, breaking from their cover, ran across the intervening space which
  separated them from the German trench, carried the first and the second line
  at the point of the bayonet, and ran up the hill, flinging themselves into
  the hot craters which the explosion had made.</p>

  <p>"The interval that elapsed before our assault took place was&mdash;to use
  the words of one soldier&mdash;like a transformation scene. Trenches,
  parapets, sandbags disappeared, and the whole surface of the ground assumed
  strange shapes, here torn into huge craters, there forming mounds of fallen
  debris.</p>

  <p>"As the reports of the explosions died away, and while the dense columns
  of smoke and dust still hung in the air, our men, led by their officers,
  sprang from the trenches and rushed across the intervening space of some
  forty to sixty yards, lying between our line and the gaping craters before
  them, the front covered by the attack being only some 250 yards in
  length.</p>

  <p>"Where the mines had actually exploded nothing was left of the occupants
  of the hostile line; but in the neighbouring trenches our assaulting infantry
  witnessed an extraordinary scene. Many of the German soldiers, possibly owing
  to the fact that they were working, were surprised in their shirt-sleeves
  without equipment.</p>

  <p>"Stunned by the violence of the explosion, bewildered, and suddenly
  subjected to a rain of hand-grenades thrown by our bombing parties, they gave
  way to panic. Cursing and shouting, they were falling over one another and
  fighting in their hurry to gain the exits into the communication trenches;
  and some of those in rear, maddened by terror, were driving their bayonets
  into the bodies of their comrades in front."</p>

  <p>First up the hill was "A" Company of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent
  Regiment, with "B" in support, and "C" and "D" in reserve. Then came the
  companies of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, the West Riding Regiment, the
  Yorkshire Light Infantry, and the Victoria Rifles (City of London T.F.). It
  was the indomitable 13th Brigade&mdash;that brigade which had hammered its
  way down from Mons to the Marne, which had stood the hard knocks of battle
  and the bitter trials of winter, and now came as fresh as ever to the work of
  assault.</p>

  <p>The enemy were momentarily paralysed. At first, even in the trenches which
  stretched left and right, though they fought desperately, the steel had gone
  out of their resistance.</p>

  <p>But the Germans quickly recovered from their surprise, and it was then
  that the real struggle began.</p>

  <p>From our line the hill was exposed to fire from three sides, and it was
  only a few moments before the German gunners took advantage of this fact and
  opened fire. Soon the whole position became obscured in the smoke of bursting
  shells.</p>

  <p>(I am drawing from the vivid description supplied by "Eye-Witness.")</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, our batteries had begun to support the attack, and a terrific
  artillery fire was maintained far into the night.</p>

  <p>"As darkness fell the scene was grand in the extreme. From many points
  along our line to the north and south of Hill 60 could be seen the flashes of
  the shells, while those of the guns were so nearly continuous as to resemble
  the effect of musketry. Under this fire our men had to work, throwing up
  parapets towards the enemy, blocking their communications, and generally
  rendering the position defensible.</p>

  <p>"Nor were the enemy's infantry idle. Advancing up the communication
  trenches, they threw hand-grenades over the barricades and also into the mine
  crater, on the crumbling sides of which our men were clinging in the
  endeavour to obtain a foothold."</p>

  <p>The British infantry gained the crest, and far into the darkness of the
  night they worked with entrenching tools, spades, and wire, to put themselves
  into a state of defence.</p>

  <p>The first counter-attack came in the night. It was half-hearted and was
  hammered back mercilessly. The second shared no better fate, the hillside was
  left piled with dead. The tireless infantry worked like galley slaves,
  filling their sandbags, creating their new parapets and communicating
  trenches, and at dawn Hill 60 was better defended than it had ever been
  defended before&mdash;only this time the parapets faced the German front.</p>

  <p>The Germans came back half-heartedly at first. It may have needed the
  application of those cat-o'-nine-tails which the British discovered in the
  German trenches before Neuve Chapelle to get these men, shocked and shaken by
  their terrific experience of the evening, to return in a vain effort to drive
  the British forth.</p>

  <p>At seven in the morning the serious counter-assault was delivered. All
  night long the trains had been disgorging troops at Roulers. Frantic
  telegrams had been bringing the scattered corps to this front; and now at
  seven o'clock arrayed against the devoted brigade which held the crest of
  Hill 60, came the flower of the German Army. Prussian and Bavarian swept up
  the hill in solid mass. Waiting in the rear of the British lines to see at
  what point the attempt would be directed were our side-car machine-guns. When
  no doubt existed any longer as to the front which would bear the brunt of the
  assault, these nimble engines of war came tearing to their appointed
  stations. Into the German mass the machine-guns poured their ceaseless stream
  of lead, and the attacking line melted and dwindled away. Again the British
  came out with the bayonet, and again they swept victoriously down the slope
  of the hill, driving before them the remnants of a very gallant force.</p>

  <p>All night long, as the infantry had worked, the enemy had flung shell
  after shell over their position, and the firing was intensified throughout
  the day, and under its support yet another attack was made on the Sunday
  evening, which gave the Germans a foothold in our trenches on the southern
  edge of the hill.</p>

  <p>They were not to enjoy their possession for long. Help reached our front
  line in the form of reinforcements who swept the Germans from the foothold
  they had gained, and our position became more secure. British wounded had
  been left behind in those trenches which the German occupied, and British
  wounded at Neuve Chapelle had been battered and hacked to death by these
  ruthless butchers. Back came the British with the bayonet, even as they had
  come at Neuve Chapelle, when young Madden had fallen dying with the cry:
  "Come on, the King's!" on his lips. Back they went in irresistible floods,
  pouring into the trench that the German had won with such labour, and driving
  such of its occupants as were left alive down the slope of the hill. Little
  they cared, these British soldiers, though battery after battery of German
  artillery came into action, VOL. III. D and the hill side was ablaze with the
  light of bursting shells. It was now that our casualties came heavily.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the night the grey infantry came up again to dispute
  possession of the hill, and again in hand-to-hand fighting they were driven
  back, leaving behind a further sprinkling of dead. Left and right along the
  line, almost to the region of Neuve Chapelle, as far as Bixschoote, the
  sector was alight, and the ceaseless rattle of rifle fire and the constant
  booming and crashing of heavy guns ran beyond earshot on either flank.</p>

  <p>The fight for Neuve Chapelle, St. Éloi and Hill 60 took a very heavy toll
  of British lives, but it must be remembered that the fighting was on a much
  larger scale than it had ever been since the British Army has been in France.
  Of the troops employed we have only heard of the 4th Corps, and especially of
  the 7th Division, whose gallant defence of Ypres was one of the outstanding
  features of the war. The 1st Army was generally engaged, and it was to Sir
  Douglas Haig that Sir John French paid his greatest tribute. Some British
  regiments lost almost all their officers. The Cameronians lost, in one day's
  fighting, fifteen officers killed and nine wounded. This was, I suppose, at
  St. Éloi, and possibly the Cameronians suffered the full force of the enemy's
  first attack. The Devonshire Regiment, the Highland Light Infantry, and the
  Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Black Watch, the Cameron Highlanders,
  the Royal Scots, and the Gordon Highlanders were in the thick of it. To the
  list of Scottish Regiments must be added the heavy casualties of the Seaforth
  Highlanders, who lost fifteen officers killed and wounded. The casualty list
  of this regiment in the neighbourhood of Neuve Chapelle and La Bassée had
  been a very heavy one. The Seaforths, it will be remembered, held the orchard
  to the north of Festubert against a series of determined attacks, held fast
  until the arrival of reinforcements to relieve them. The steadfastness of the
  Seaforths was a characteristic feature throughout the whole campaign. I have
  previously referred to that excellent unit, the Middlesex Regiment, and if I
  again refer to the splendid corps which were fighting Britain's battles, and
  enlarge upon the traditions and the individual character of these regiments
  it is because, behind the cold and formal account which was published from
  official sources, there lies the individual heroism, which is so dear to the
  British heart.</p>

  <p>Where the Argylls were we may be sure the Middlesex would be. But the
  Middlesex must have found a particularly hot corner, as their losses showed.
  Of the Irish regiments, the Irish Rifles were engaged, the Inniskilling
  Fusiliers, the Dublin Fusiliers, and the Leinsters.</p>

  <p>Yet other mentioned regiments were the</p>

  <p>Lincolns, the Northamptonshire Regiment, the Sherwood Foresters, and the
  Worcestershire Regiment, which had the largest casualty roll of all.</p>

  <p>It has been an extraordinary feature of this war that the names of certain
  regiments have recurred again and again. I have already touched upon this in
  describing the fighting about Givenchy, and the list of casualties in the
  operations at Neuve Chapelle and St. Éloi merely emphasises the point. Again
  and again had the Worcesters appeared as being in the van of some desperate
  enterprise. The Northamptonshire Regiment had an unbroken record of fine
  achievements, starting at the very beginning of the war and continuing almost
  without a break from month to month. In almost every despatch which General
  French has sent us he spoke of this fine regiment. It is remembered as the
  corps which delivered an attack through the mists on the Aisne and carried a
  line of trenches, driving the Germans up the hill. Then there are the
  Sherwood Foresters and the Lincolns, whose names are constantly cropping up
  in official despatches. These heavy casualties in certain regiments show one
  thing, namely, that the traditions which have been gained in this war were
  bearing immediate fruit. The proud name which certain regiments have made for
  themselves were being upheld worthily by their successors, and men preferred
  to stand and die at their posts, so long as they could accomplish the purpose
  which they were put to accomplish, rather than retire, even in the face of an
  overwhelming attack.</p>

  <p>The Indian troops, said Sir John French in a message to the Viceroy of
  India, fought with great gallantry and marked success in the capture of Neuve
  Chapelle and the subsequent fighting. The fighting was very severe and their
  losses heavy, but nothing daunted them. Their tenacity, courage, and
  endurance were admirable.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE SECOND ATTACK ON YPRES</h2>

  <p class="first">THURSDAY, April 22, was such a day as compensated for the
  long and dreary winter, for the blizzards and the rain, and the bleak
  unlovely outlook which had been the soldiers' throughout the dark winter
  months of the war. An almost cloudless sky, a gentle northerly breeze, and a
  flood of yellow sunlight made even the trenches tolerable habitations, and
  gave to the gossiping soldiers who crowded them north and south of Ypres a
  sense of well-being.</p>

  <p>Along the line, on either side of the Ypres salient, the men in the
  trenches had heard the ceaseless thunder of guns about Hill 60, had seen the
  midnight skies aglow with bursting shells, and had wondered who in the argot
  of the trenches was "getting it."</p>

  <p>"We heard and practically saw the fighting, and we said: 'They are having
  another cut at Ypres,'" wrote a soldier to his mother from Neuve Chapelle.
  "They'll be down after us shortly, but we are ready for them."</p>

  <p>But the German was not moving southward.</p>

  <p>The alert British airmen, who were constantly above the German lines,
  detected certain concentrations of troops, movements of artillery, and the
  transport of heavy wagons; but these were going northward, toward that
  section of line which was held by a colonial division of the French Army.</p>

  <p>Ypres was defended by a succession of trenches to the east of the town, by
  a semi-circular formation which passed to the west of Gheluvelt, straddled
  the Ypres-Roulers railway, and continued between the village of St. Julien
  and Poelcapelle to a tributary of the Yser (the Yserlée), and so south of
  Dixmude to the edge of the flooded area. The British line itself ran up from
  Givenchy through Armentières to Neuve Chapelle, St. Éloi, and then to the
  east of Ypres, where, as already stated, a French division formed a link
  between the Belgian and British forces.</p>

  <p>The extreme left of the British line was held on April 22 by two brigades
  of the Canadian division, the first brigade being in general reserve. Nearer
  to Ypres were the British regular and Territorial battalions, and the nearer
  they were to Hill 60, the more actively were they engaged with the enemy upon
  their front.</p>

  <p>The German had failed entirely to recover the ground he had lost at Hill
  60, and indeed until the crest of Hill 60 was all but swept away by fire, we
  held on to that position. He had failed in spite of the fact that he had
  employed large masses, that he had been wasteful of life, and had flung his
  men, with a certain prodigal disregard for consequences, at the unshaken line
  that now circled the hill. He might hope, with some reason, to force this
  position, and not only this position, but the Ypres salient, by delivering an
  attack upon a portion of the line to the north or to the south which was not
  strongly held. Southward, any attempt was foredoomed to failure. St. Éloi and
  Givenchy, no less than Neuve Chapelle, had taught him the futility of
  attempting to carry those positions unless he had available a force much
  larger than he possessed.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have set to work with extraordinary thoroughness to procure
  the retirement of the connecting French link, and through the gap thus formed
  (some 4,200 yards) to push in every available man he could muster, not with
  the object of reaching the coast, as some people imagined, but in order to
  thrust so tight a wedge into the Allied lines as, for preservation's sake,
  would compel his enemy to bring about either the immediate retirement of the
  Belgian army, which was holding the Yser, or else the flattening out of the
  Ypres salient.</p>

    <p class="caption">General Sir Arthur Paget.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Some time during April 19 the German had distributed along his front
  trenches, confronting the French, a number of cylinders, probably similar in
  appearance to those in which hydrogen and oxygen are "packed" in this
  country, and these were filled at great pressure with a gas which had
  terrible asphyxiating effects upon its victims.</p>

  <p>It was a gas which, because of its specific gravity, remains close to the
  ground and is not easily dispersed. It was originally intended by the German,
  as we ascertained later from a deserter, to employ this barbarous weapon on
  the 20th, but the winds were unfavourable.</p>

  <p>The French trenches ran due east and west, and it was necessary, for the
  success of the German plan, that there should be a fresh northerly wind
  blowing, which would carry the vapours, when they were released, into the
  French lines.</p>

  <p>The opportunity came on the Thursday, and at five o'clock in the afternoon
  the gases were simultaneously released all along the German front, and
  floated in a thick yellow vapour. The puzzled French watched this slow-moving
  curtain of mist coming toward them, and thought at first it was merely a ruse
  to veil the approach of German troops.</p>

  <p>With this idea in their minds they opened a vigorous fusillade upon the
  German trenches&mdash;a fusillade somewhat disconcerting to the enemy, who
  had already risen over their parapets and were waiting for the asphyxiating
  gas to do its work before they rushed forward and occupied their enemy's
  line.</p>

  <p>The first conviction of danger came to the</p>

  <p>French when the mist came pouring into their trenches, seeking the lower
  levels. Instantly the officers realised the dastardly trick which was being
  played upon them, and realised, too, the impossibility of holding out under
  these conditions.</p>

  <p>The Turcos who comprised the French force scrambled out of their trenches
  and began to make for the second line. Many fell, gasping in agony,
  struggling for their breath; others were shot down; only a very few managed
  to reach the supporting trenches before the inexorable vapour came rolling
  across over the ground, flooding the second trench line in exactly the same
  way and driving its occupants to retreat.</p>

  <p>The Canadians, to the right of the French and on the extreme left of the
  British line, watched this withdrawal, to them inexplicable, in amazement.
  They noticed the yellow veil of mist which moved with the wind, but saw
  little in this to excite their apprehension.</p>

  <p>Their own line was secure. Behind them, in a patch of wood, were their
  four heavy guns, which that morning had been shelling the enemy line, and the
  presence of big guns in the vicinity of infantry has invariably a tendency to
  generate confidence. At any rate, they themselves had no reason to expect any
  immediate attack or any unusual pressure to be placed upon their front.</p>

  <p>It was a Canadian officer on the extreme left, watching through his
  glasses the progress of this curious "smoke," who soon awoke to the fact that
  the French had retired and that there existed a gap in the line of more than
  a mile in length. Instantly the news was flashed to Brigadier-General Turner,
  commanding the 3rd Brigade, and he was the first to grasp the nature of the
  disaster which was imminent.</p>

  <p>His flank was left uncovered to a very strong German force, The guns in
  the rear&mdash;they were immediately in the rear of the junction between
  French and Canadians&mdash;were jeopardised, even though they were two miles
  away. With commendable promptitude he extended his line to the left,
  intending to bend it back so that it would rest upon the wood. Necessarily,
  with this manoeuvre many of the Canadians came under the influence of the
  noxious gases which were still distributed over the ground. Men went suddenly
  blue in the face, staggered and fell. Others came reeling forth, choking and
  gasping, for the gas immediately attacked the lung passage and the bronchial
  tubes, and set up, in a remarkably short space of time, a condition which may
  be described as acute bronchitis.</p>

  <p>Quick as the Canadian commander had been, the enemy had been quicker to
  take advantage of the inevitable confusion caused by his foul warfare and by
  the necessity hurriedly to readjust the Canadian position. Sweeping forward,
  supported by huge bodies of men, all protected against the fumes of the gas
  area which they had to penetrate by pads fastened over their noses and
  mouths, the Germans reached the wood where the guns were long before the
  first extension of the line came in touch. It was hopeless for the first
  little party which came under fire from the wood to make any attempt at
  saving the guns. They had to face heavy fusillades and attacks along their
  front, extending even as far as the right of the 2nd Brigade. Later that 2nd
  Brigade, whose line was intact, had to fall back slowly upon the village of
  St. Julien, but in the first hours of attack it held steadily to its
  position. The German rush was overwhelming, and the guns passed into the
  enemy's possession.</p>

  <p>The country was flat, broken only by those thick hedges which the Belgian
  farmer erects at every hundred metres. Save for the wood, the plain was
  innocent of trees, and even those which formed the copse where the guns were
  concealed were thin, almost reed-like saplings of no great height. Cover
  there was none save that which the men made for themselves. But behind these
  lines trenches had already been prepared, and into these the Canadians
  crowded.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the news of the calamity&mdash;for such it undoubtedly
  was&mdash;had gone back to Divisional and to Corps Headquarters.</p>

  <p>Some of the retiring Turcos had straggled to the confines of Ypres itself,
  and formed the centre of a dozen inquiring knots of British soldiers who
  wanted to know what all the trouble was about. For this kind of retirement,
  unaccompanied by any very heavy preparatory fire, was inexplicable. The
  artillery bombardment, which as a rule precedes a violent assault, in this
  case followed it, and even as the soldiers were interrogating the bewildered
  Turcos, a terrific bombardment was opened upon Ypres.</p>

  <p>They had not long to wait, these hardened soldiers of Great Britain,
  before they learnt the seriousness of the attack and the manner in which it
  affected them personally. A staff officer rode his sweating horse at a gallop
  through the lines and shouted a sharp order. "Nothing more impressive can be
  imagined," wrote "Eye-Witness", "than the sight of our men falling in quickly
  in perfect order on their alarm posts amid the scene of wild confusion caused
  by the panic-stricken refugees who swarmed along the roads."</p>

  <p>In ten minutes the British regiments were moving across the plain slope
  towards the scene of the fighting.</p>

  <p>But the Canadians were not waiting for assistance. Bitterly chagrined at
  the position in which they found themselves, humiliated by the loss of their
  guns, they needed no incentive to make an attempt at their recovery. They
  were fresh from England, with the memory still green of wet and tiresome days
  on Salisbury Plain, of their anguish of mind when, morning after morning, no
  fresh instructions had reached them to move to the front. And then one day
  that electric order had arrived, and they had gone out to Flanders full of
  hope, full of determination, and full of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>They had passed under the approving eye of their commander-in-chief; they
  had borne the exacting and critical scrutiny of the war-worn soldiers of
  Britain; and they had gone into the trenches to await the supreme test with
  the words of their General ringing in their ears: "It is the boast of my old
  regiment that they never budge from a trench. I want you to be able to say
  the same when the war ends."</p>

  <p>A few of them had been driven back by fumes. The remainder had had to
  alter their line because of the French retirement. But the fact that their
  guns were in the hands of the enemy rankled more with the Canadians than it
  would with a regular regiment. For the regular would have accepted the
  position with a philosophy and a humour which would in no way have weakened
  his effort to recover the lost cannon.</p>

  <p>The Canadians were sensitive, wrathful, burning with a desire to undo the
  mischief which the German had caused by his employment of methods to which
  civilisation had denied its approval. The sun went down on the hurried
  movement of the Canadians, who, company by company, and regiment by regiment,
  were gradually shifting to a new front, moving in seeming confusion toward
  their left, so that the new Canadian line resembled a triangle with its apex
  immediately south of Poelcapelle. It went down, too, upon the sturdy khaki
  columns coming up from Ypres, moving with strides which would have appeared
  to the tyro to be leisurely, until he realised that it is the object of a
  commanding officer to get troops into the fighting line with as little
  fatigue as possible, and to present them at the trench, where their supreme
  effort had to be made, in such condition as would enable them to put forth
  their best work.</p>

  <p>"The British are coming up in support," was the word that ran down the
  line.</p>

  <p>The 1st Canadian Brigade, which had been in general reserve, was already
  moving up. A misty moon showed the dark masses of Canadians forming for an
  attack upon the left. They had not been allowed to continue or conclude their
  preparations for this attack in peace.</p>

  <p>The whole weight of German metal had been thrown against the new Canadian
  salient, and the Canadian Division was terribly outnumbered. Fire flamed at
  them from forty thousand rifles; massed machine-guns sprayed their front with
  nickel; guns of every calibre pounded these men who formed up as if on
  parade, knowing that they were going to annihilation, yet joyful at the
  prospect.</p>

  <p>The Canadian Scottish (the 16th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade) and the 10th
  Battalion of the 2nd Brigade had been intercepted on their way to reserve
  trenches, and had been sent to this front. These two battalions, commanded by
  Lieutenant-Colonel Leckie and Lieutenant-Colonel Boyle, were given the task
  of clearing the small wood and recovering the guns. But the enemy had
  utilised his time well. He had entrenched himself at the edge of the wood; he
  had hurried forward his light Maxims and had literally banked them on the
  front where an attack was to be expected.</p>

  <p>"We never thought there was a chance of your taking the wood," said a
  German prisoner afterwards. "I heard my colonel say: 'It is too much to hope
  that they will come up against us here.' We knew you were Canadians and we
  thought you might try, but we were so certain that any attack would be
  utterly defeated that some of our men lay down and went to sleep."</p>

  <p>They were awakened soon enough. A waving line of bayonets flickered in the
  pale moonlight as the Canadians came in a jog-trot, halting only to pour
  volley after volley into the little wood, while the British guns,
  concentrating their fire, dropped shell after shell into the enemy's cover.
  Then with a roar of cheering, the Canadians were up, over the first barricade
  and into the enemy's trenches, hacking and stabbing with their bayonets. In
  that wood, where the trees grew so thickly that men had to pick their way to
  get through, the Canadians poured, driving the enemy in retreat.</p>

  <p>The official Observer with the Canadian Division gave us a vivid idea of
  this stage of the struggle. "An officer who took part in the attack describes
  how the men about him fell under the fire of the machine-guns, which, in his
  phrase, played upon them 'like a watering-pot.' He added, quite simply, 'I
  wrote my own life off.' But the line never wavered.</p>

  <p>"When one man fell another took his place, and with a final shout the
  survivors of the two battalions flung themselves into the wood. The German
  garrison was completely demoralised, and the impetuous advance of the
  Canadians did not cease until they reached the far side of the wood and
  entrenched themselves there in the position so dearly gained. They had,
  however, the disappointment of finding that the guns had been blown up by the
  enemy."</p>

  <p>The Canadians pushed through to the farther edge of the wood and held on
  to a trench line, and gradually the gaps on their right and between
  themselves and the main body were filled up as the new Canadian regiments
  came into action. Throughout the earlier part of the night the position,
  which was gained at such cost, was held by the gallant Canadians.</p>

  <p>"The fighting continued all through the night, and to those who observed
  the indications that the attack was being pushed with ever-growing strength,
  it hardly seemed possible that the Canadians, fighting in positions so
  difficult to defend, could maintain their resistance for any long
  period."</p>

  <p>Then, in the early hours of the morning, the enemy brought a concentrated
  fire to bear upon the wood. It was such a fire as the most seasoned soldier
  had seldom seen.</p>

  <p>"It swept the wood as a tropical storm sweeps the leaves of the forest,"
  said the official Observer, "and it made it impossible for them to hold the
  position for which they had sacrificed so much." The little plantation became
  a chaos of shattered and burning tree trunks, flying branches were hurled in
  all directions, and it was in this period probably that the Canadian engaged
  on this front suffered his severest losses. If he had not rescued the guns,
  he had at least the satisfaction of knowing that he had forced the enemy to
  make them useless, and under the heavy fire which was opened on him he had no
  other course to pursue than to retire. This he did in good order, taking his
  wounded with him.</p>

  <p>So far from the enemy's attack weakening, it gained in intensity as the
  night wore through, and in the early hours of the morning the confused line
  which the Canadian had hastily constructed toward St. Julien was assailed
  with such ferocity as to render it doubtful in the minds of the Staff whether
  it was possible to hold on any longer.</p>

  <p>And here let us consider the Canadian, whose baptism of fire had been so
  frightful. He was untrained to war, he was, to all intents and purposes,
  indeed by the duration of his service, a raw recruit. Yet his demeanour and
  attitude in that moment of terrible ordeal were that of a seasoned warrior.
  Calm, confident, alert, taking no thought for his own life and determined at
  all hazards to be worthy of the uniform he wore, he displayed a resolution
  and a courage which were wholly disconcerting to his enemy.</p>

  <p>"The English brought their old Army up in the night," said a German
  officer prisoner, describing what had happened; but in truth he was mistaken.
  The "Old Army," which withstood the weight of the heavy German attack
  delivered on one small front of an army corps, was a brigade and a half of
  Canadians.</p>

  <p>With the coming of daylight, the seriousness of the whole British position
  became apparent. It was not now a question of guns, their loss or their
  recovery; it was not a question, even, of retaining this or that line of
  trenches; it was a matter of holding the British line intact and preventing
  the German from thrusting a wedge between the Belgian and the British&mdash;a
  wedge which would broaden as it progressed, and must in the course of a few
  days, as new German troops were rushed to the spot, have the effect of
  isolating and completely surrounding the Belgian Army and its gallant
  King.</p>

  <p>It is a moot point, and one which I have already discussed in a previous
  chapter, as to whether the German had sufficient armed men to enable him to
  carry out such a project; but it is not difficult to understand that, once he
  had succeeded in driving a wedge into the line, he could afford to weaken
  other points, even taking the troops he had reserved for possible employment
  against Italy, in order to procure so immeasurable an advantage which a
  success upon the West would have given him.</p>

  <p>The daylight showed the British commander new and denser masses upon his
  left, and he could be in no doubt that the German intended to secure his
  envelopment at whatever cost. Gradually the grey lines were flowing round the
  jagged ends of the Canadian line. The gap which had been left by the
  retirement of the Turcos had not by any means been filled. Farther back, on
  his new front, the middle line was patchily held. The British troops which
  had been brought up to strengthen the line had so far directed their efforts
  toward the salvation of the position near St. Julien. Whatever had to be done
  in the way of checking the threatened development, had to be done quickly,
  and it had to be done, moreover, by the Canadians themselves.</p>

  <p>They might wait and see what the German intention was and place themselves
  in a position of defence in order to counteract the enemy plans; but such a
  course of action would have been attended by the greatest risks. The Canadian
  general saw his duty, and saw it plainly. It was to make a counter-attack
  upon this growing horde, and endeavour to force them from the trench lines
  which they now occupied and which would serve to cover further encroachments
  by the invader. That first line of German trenches, it must be remembered,
  was well in behind the trenches previously occupied by the French&mdash;so
  far had the enemy advanced.</p>

  <p>The Canadian commander's decision was not lightly taken, for he had no
  illusions as to the strength of the German position or his ability to defend
  himself. The men in the trenches were undoubtedly troops of vast war
  experience, and it was asking something of new troops, who were having their
  first experience of war, to deliver a frontal attack in such circumstances.
  Whatever hesitation the Canadian general had did not last very long. As for
  the men, they were anxious and impatient for the trial of strength. A British
  brigade had now come upon the scene, and this, with the Ontario 1st and 4th
  Battalions of the 1st Brigade, under Brigadier-General Mercer, moved forth to
  the task which awaited them.</p>

  <p>As they came across the plain a veritable cascade of fire fell upon these
  devoted ranks. Men fell left and right, but others came up into their places.
  Slowly at first, then gaining speed as they neared their objective, Briton
  and Canadian pressed on side by side.</p>

  <p>"It is safe to say," wrote the Canadian Observer in his despatch, "that
  the youngest private in the ranks, as he set his teeth for the advance, knew
  the task in front of him, and the youngest subaltern knew all that rested
  upon his success. It did not seem that any human being could live in the
  shower of shot and shell which began to play upon the advancing troops.</p>

  <p>"They suffered terrible casualties. For a short time every other man
  seemed to fall, but the attack was pressed ever closer and closer. The 4th
  Canadian Battalion at one moment came under a particularly withering fire.
  For a moment&mdash; not more&mdash;it wavered. Its most gallant commanding
  officer, Lieut.-Colonel Burchill, carrying, after an old fashion, a light
  cane, coolly and cheerfully rallied his men, and at the very moment when his
  example had infected them fell dead at the head of his battalion.</p>

  <p>"With a hoarse cry of anger they sprang forward (for, indeed, they loved
  him) as if to avenge his death. The astonishing attack which followed, pushed
  home in the face of direct frontal fire, made in broad daylight, by
  battalions whose names should live for ever in the memories of soldiers, was
  carried to the first line of German trenches. After a hand-to-hand struggle,
  the last German who resisted was bayoneted, and the trench was won."</p>

  <p>"We were in the trenches before we knew where we were," said a man who
  took part in that wonderful charge; "and the Germans had to decide whether
  they wanted to live or die, and had to decide quick. Every man who did not
  instantly put up his arms was bayoneted, and we left the trench filled with
  German dead."</p>

<p>If you place the letter S upon its side thus
<img src="1400081h-images/SHoW3-S.gif" alt="">,
  the first curve will
  represent the points where this charge was made, the other curve the salient
  of Ypres, and it will be easy to see the enormous consequence which attended
  the Canadian success in this sector.</p>

  <p>They were attacking the most advanced point of the German wedge which had
  been driven into the Allied line, and not only did they so attack, in face of
  a withering fire, but they clinched their victory in their hand-to-hand
  fight, in which prodigies of valour were performed. A huge Canadian sergeant
  cleared one communication trench single-handed, parried a bomb, which was
  thrown at him, with the point of his bayonet, and killed the officer who was
  directing a German section with one blow from the butt of his rifle. A
  Canadian private, wounded to death, shouted as his comrades passed: "Kill a
  German for me. I'm done." And thus many men who fell urged their comrades
  forward as they died.</p>

  <p>"The measure of this success may be taken when it is pointed out that this
  trench represented in the German advance the apex in the breach which the
  enemy had made in the original line of the Allies, and that it was two and a
  half miles south of that line. This charge, made by men who looked death
  indifferently in the face&mdash;for no man who took part in it could think
  that he was likely to live&mdash;saved, and that was much, the Canadian
  left.</p>

  <p>"But it did more. Up to the point where the assailants conquered or died,
  it secured and maintained during the most critical moment of all the
  integrity of the Allied line."</p>

  <p>Throughout Friday, Saturday, and Sunday these two regiments, hammered by
  the full weight of German artillery, held their own against every
  counter-attack which was delivered, clung to their trenches though a
  veritable inferno of artillery fire was opened upon them, though bomb and
  hand grenade, shell and shrapnel and machine-gun, were turned upon their
  front. But they held fast, in spite of all, until the night of Sunday, the
  25th.</p>

  <p>The two Canadian regiments engaged in the attack had not been involved in
  the first catastrophe. Being of the 1st Brigade, they had been in reserve
  somewhere in the rear, and had been hastily beaten up to close the gap
  between the Belgians and the British. In the meantime, the 3rd Brigade,
  which, as already stated, was at the extreme left of the line, were fully
  occupied in endeavouring to establish a communicating line between these two
  battalions of the 1st Brigade and the British. Though the bigger gap was
  closed, there was a wide interval on the left of the 3rd Brigade, which
  needed filling.</p>

  <p>The position as it existed on the Friday morning, after the reserves had
  taken the "Wood of the Guns" and had retired, may be summed up by saying that
  each unit was confronted with the urgent necessity of battling for its own
  preservation, and was at the same time expected to render assistance to other
  units equally embarrassed. It was as though they were ordered to "Do your
  utmost and a little more."</p>

  <p>Certainly, the 3rd Brigade, which so far had been the only body of the
  Canadians to feel the effect of the fumes, though in a less degree to that
  which the French had experienced, were hard pressed to hold their own. From
  five o'clock on Thursday evening throughout the night they had been subjected
  to a punishing fire. They could with ease have held the position they
  occupied on Thursday morning but for the necessity of weakening their ranks
  to extend their line to the south-west.</p>

  <p>It was abundantly clear that the enemy's full strength was directed along
  a front of not more than 4,000 yards. He had crossed the Yser&mdash;but that
  was no fault of the Canadians.</p>

  <p>The Belgians on the other side of the gap were pushing troops to the
  right, but our gallant little Ally had not sufficient men to spare. Moreover,
  the fury of German endeavour was directed against them also, and from behind
  the ruined walls and barricades of the little village of Lizerne they were
  contesting a terrific attack which had been launched simultaneously with that
  which had driven the French line in.</p>

  <p>I have said that the first emission of gas by the Germans had scarcely
  affected the Canadian line, save those upon the extreme left of the 3rd
  Brigade, who had come in for the fringe of the mist. That discharge, however,
  had been intended solely for the benefit of the Turcos, and it was not until
  four o'clock on the Friday morning that the Germans brought their gas
  apparatus into play on the Canadian front. The poor fellows of the Canadian
  regiments who found themselves unable to escape these fumes, were instantly
  suffocated. The Highland Regiments of Canada, the Royal Highlanders of
  Montreal, the 48th Highlanders and two other battalions of Canadian infantry,
  the 13th and 15th, were specially affected by this new early morning attempt.
  The darkness before the dawn had hidden the approach of this slow-moving
  mist, and it was in the Canadian trenches before the men realised their
  terrible danger. The Royal Highlanders stood, vainly endeavouring to disperse
  the asphyxiating fumes, and the 48th Highlanders, who seem to have received a
  more than ordinary poisonous fog, were driven from their trenches, which were
  rendered intolerable. They did not go very far back, however, nor did they
  remain away for any length of time. Long before the Germans could reach the
  abandoned trench the Highlanders were back again, choking and coughing, but
  ready to punish the men who had descended to this method of warfare.</p>

  <p>"It was terrible to see grown men tearing at their tunics, their shirts,
  to expose their bare breasts to the cold air of morning, gasping, livid and
  blue, fighting desperately for their breath, yet with their vengeful eyes
  peering across the parapet&mdash;mindful, in spite of their own terrible
  distress, of the business they had in hand."</p>

  <p>The German attack at this point was a feeble one, and it was probably
  employed to mask the more important operations on their right. The enemy knew
  of the gap which existed between the 3rd Brigade and the newly formed line
  farther to the south, and the grey hordes were moving quickly to seize the
  advantage which that gap presented. For a short time the position of the 3rd
  Brigade was a parlous one, for several German divisions were attempting to
  overwhelm it. The enemy had slipped behind in the early hours of the morning,
  and direct communication with the brigade headquarters was cut off. Only the
  devotion of the left, which continued a succession of harassing attacks upon
  the enemy, saved the brigade from complete envelopment.</p>

  <p>In that confused fighting, where men found their front continuously
  changed, and where companies and battalions raced across the open under heavy
  fire, to an unknown destination and to the attack of a force of unknown
  strength, the Canadians' mettle was tested tremendously. On the Royal
  Highlanders of Montreal and the 13th Battalion fell the heaviest of the
  fighting. Captain McCuaig, who had received very severe wounds, resolutely
  refused to be moved from his trench to safety, urging on his men to the
  greater business of smashing the German offensive. Major Norsworth, of the
  13th Regiment, rallying his men cheerfully, although almost disabled by a
  bullet wound, was soon afterwards shot and bayoneted under the eyes of his
  company, who fought desperately about his body, and by the very fierceness of
  their attack drove back an enemy of vastly superior numbers.</p>

  <p>It was a case of hand-to-hand fighting, a case of holding on by nail and
  tooth, and though every moment showed the position to be more and more
  desperate and revealed to the Brigade commander increasing masses of Germans
  upon his left, the Canadians, obliged to retire, contested every step of the
  way. Captain McCuaig met his end as gloriously as Major Norsworth. Thus the
  Canadian Record Officer told the story of his heroic sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"This most gallant officer was seriously wounded in a
  hurriedly-constructed trench at a moment when it would have been possible to
  remove him to safety. He absolutely refused to move, and continued in the
  discharge of his duty. But the situation grew constantly worse, and
  peremptory orders were received for an immediate withdrawal.</p>

  <p>"Those who were compelled to obey them were most insistent to carry with
  them, at whatever risk to their own mobility and safety, an officer to whom
  they were devotedly attached. But he, knowing, it may be, better than they
  the exertions which still lay in front of them, and unwilling to inflict upon
  them the disabilities of a maimed man, very resolutely refused, and asked of
  them one thing only, that there should be given to him as he lay alone in the
  trench two loaded Colt revolvers to add to his own, which lay in his right
  hand as he made his last request. And so, with three revolvers ready to his
  hand for use, a very brave officer waited to sell his life, wounded and
  racked with pain, in an abandoned trench."</p>

  <p>Such instances could be multiplied without effort. The Canadian men were
  splendid, their officers were magnificent. They were true to the traditions
  not only of their race but of their caste, and especially was this true of
  the Canadian Scots, who in the face of difficulties and dangers of
  extraordinary and unprecedented kinds, gave their lives cheerfully and sold
  them dearly for the Motherland.</p>

  <p>And now the 3rd Brigade were moving back, leaving the detachment of Royal
  Highlanders and the 13th Regiment and the Royal Montreal Regiment and the
  14th Battalion to make their way back as well as they could. It was
  impossible in that moment to bring about the retirement of every single man
  in a uniform line without jeopardising the safety of a whole brigade.</p>

  <p>The apex of the position was now upon St. Julien, and the farther south
  the retirement was carried the stronger became the connecting line and the
  more obvious did it become to the German commander that he could not possibly
  hope to achieve the object which he had set out to secure.</p>

  <p>The chagrin of the enemy manifested itself in a renewed vigour of attack,
  in an almost senseless waste of ammunition.</p>

  <p>The German objective had been twofold.</p>

  <p>It had been, as a primary object, to force a wedge into the Allied line
  and to isolate the Belgian; it had also had probably as a secondary object,
  though most writers suggest it as the primary reason, the flattening out of
  the Ypres salient.</p>

  <p>Yet Ypres, though its line was pinched so that it now struck sharply, like
  an acute angle, into the enemy's position, was untouched and unshaken, and
  the British, who had been battling desperately to retake their hold of Hill
  60, and were now enjoying something of a lull, were as strongly entrenched
  about that famous mound as they could well be. With the retirement of the 3rd
  Brigade the brunt of the frontal attack must necessarily be borne by the 2nd,
  which had been only slightly affected up till now. The same condition as
  existed when the French moved back, exposing the 3rd Brigade, was reproduced
  to some extent by the enforced retreat of the 3rd. The Brigadier of the 2nd
  Brigade, which had maintained its lines, had had ample warning of his
  colleague's intention.</p>

  <p>The village of St. Julien, which on Thursday morning had been well to the
  rear of the British line, and had probably furnished billets for a portion of
  the British force, was now the actual front, and it was hoped that the
  Canadians, aided by the British brigade which had come up and which had
  helped to form a "bottom" to the basin-shaped line which the German had
  created, would be able to arrest the enemy advance sufficiently to allow yet
  more troops to be brought up, and a portion of the lost ground regained.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Brigade had held a front of about a mile and a half, and
  Brigadier- General Curry proceeded at once to drop back his left flank to
  cover St. Julien, which, however, was soon rendered untenable by enemy
  artillery and the line forced back to the south of that village.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the 2nd Brigade were in touch with the British,
  holding the vital point which protected Ypres; and, splendid as had been the
  achievement of the Canadians on the left in picturesque and thrilling
  fighting, the burden of defence, so far as the east of the Ypres line was
  concerned, necessarily fell upon Brigadier-General Curry's brigade.</p>

  <p>Obviously, if the 2nd had shared the fate of the 3rd, and if they in turn
  had been driven back uniformly, and the attack against their trench lines had
  succeeded, a general retirement before Ypres, and possibly the evacuation of
  that town, would have been rendered imperative.</p>

  <p>From Thursday at five o'clock until Sunday afternoon the 2nd Brigade held
  its newly organised line. And on Sunday afternoon they had not abandoned
  their trenches. "There were none left. They had been obliterated by artillery
  fire." The extreme left of the 2nd Brigade was held by the 90th Winnipeg
  Rifles.</p>

  <p>For the first time the German was meeting a new force.</p>

  <p>He had met the French Canadians of Montreal; he had crumbled before the
  impetuous charge of the American Canadians of Toronto, and now he was to meet
  the men of the Western plains&mdash;those fearless soldiers from the prairies
  of Manitoba.</p>

  <p>Winnipeg had sent this battalion forth in pride and confidence, to
  represent the great corn lands of the West in the struggle which the
  Motherland was waging against the tyrant of Europe; and well was that
  confidence repaid.</p>

  <p>The line, newly adjusted, held against the hammer blows which were
  delivered by the trained soldiers of the Kaiser. Again and again, with a
  reckless disregard for life, were the German battalions flung at this
  unshaken front, but ever it held.</p>

  <p>Then the German tried his gas upon the 90th, loosened the caps of his
  cylinders close at hand, and sent the men from Winnipeg fighting for air,
  dazed, blinded and choking, back to their support trenches. In triumph the
  German, occupied the trenches which the Canadians had abandoned, but their
  stay was a short one. Well might they doubt the efficacy of their last brutal
  method when, very silently, the 90th crept back with the bayonet, destroyed
  the occupants of their trenches, flung out the dead and established
  themselves again on the line from which they had been ejected.</p>

  <p>The 90th held on even when the 3rd Brigade had gone back and when the gap
  between them and their nearest troops became greater and greater. The enemy
  could not have known that this heaven-sent opportunity had been presented to
  him, until it was too late to take advantage of it.</p>

  <p>Then he hurried forward his reserves to cut in behind the 90th, but they
  arrived too late. Two British regiments came up on Saturday night, filled the
  "hole" which the retirement had occasioned; and the German, who marched
  forward, as he thought, to an unresisting front, was met by that methodical
  fire, slow and sure and unhurried, which told him that he was in the presence
  of the "old" Army.</p>

  <p>The left of the 2nd Brigade was now south of St. Julien, "fighting every
  yard." That village had been taken in the morning, and had seemingly left a
  clear way of advance&mdash;a way of which the enemy did not immediately avail
  himself. Fire was intensified; the attacks came heavier and heavier instead
  of diminishing; but the Canadian troops, who had not slept, many of them, for
  72 hours, displayed a fortitude in defence which must arouse the wonder of
  all those who have not seen the soldier in action and the admiration of the
  military world.</p>

  <p>The part the old Army had taken in this fight (by "old Army" I mean, of
  course, the regular regiments of the British Army which have served
  throughout the war) has already been described. They, with two Canadian
  regiments, formed the bottom of the basin, whilst two British battalions had
  come up to extend the left of the 2nd Brigade and keep touch with the
  retiring 3rd. We had at this time a very large army in Flanders and France
  numbering hundreds of thousands, and so far not more than 30,000 British,
  probably considerably less, had been engaged in the actual firing line at
  this portion of the field.</p>

  <p>It might seem a simple matter to bring troops from reserve, especially
  when it was obvious that a permanent breach of the line would be attended by
  disastrous consequences; but the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army must
  keep his eye not only upon that particular front, but must be prepared to
  deal with a German offensive on other sections of the line. Nevertheless,
  just as soon as it was seen that the whole concentration of the German attack
  was directed upon that 5,000 yards of front, the British machine began to
move.
  Troops could in safety be withdrawn from reserve, with the sure knowledge
  that no attack of any considerable proportions would be delivered at any
  other part of the line.</p>

  <p>The wearied Canadians saw the end of their long trial approaching when,
  across the plain, leisurely and orderly, British troops were passing. Through
  the Canadian line came this gallant British brigade, and the reinforcements,
  old soldiers wise in war, who saw the remnants of the Canadian division
  sticking grimly to their task, cheered them lustily as they passed.</p>

  <p>"It was our reward," wrote a Canadian soldier, "and of all the thrilling
  experiences we had had during those past two days, none was more thrilling
  than this splendid tribute which our comrades of the line gave us as they
  went forth to death to consolidate the work we had begun. I saw men who had
  come through that fight without the display of the slightest sign of emotion,
  trembling with pride as the soldiers of the Motherland passed, waving their
  hands cheerily, and singing their songs as though they were going out on a
  route march across Salisbury Plain, orderly, disciplined and
  magnificent."</p>

  <p>That cheer was the tribute of the British Army to Canadian gallantry. It
  was something more, it was the first acknowledgment of the fellowship which
  now had been created. The Canadians had stood the test and had rung true, and
  in the roar of British cheering which swept across the bloody field to
  hearten the war- wearied men of Canada, came the first indication of the
  professional soldier's regard for Canadian valour.</p>

  <p>Yet, though the British reinforcements had come up, and though the
  Canadians, heavy-footed, "sleeping as they walked," were being passed into
  reserve as battalion after battalion moved forward to relieve them, their
  work was not yet over. There was still a "hole" to be stopped, for the German
  attack had abated none of its vigour.</p>

  <p>It was asking more than might reasonably be expected when the British
  general called upon Brigadier-General Curry for yet another effort. "Do you
  think your men could stand it?" he was asked, and the commander of the 2nd
  Brigade replied: "The men are tired, but they are ready and glad to go again
  to the trenches."</p>

  <p>He did not speak without reason.</p>

  <p>Never questioning the order, the Canadians turned about and went back to
  the firing line only a quarter of their original strength, but indomitable
  even in their weariness.</p>

  <p>All Monday and Tuesday they held on to their line, and it was not until
  Wednesday&mdash;practically a week after the attack began&mdash;that they
  were relieved, and the tired men of Canada were sent back for their
  well-earned rest.</p>

  <p>I have spoken only of the infantry and the part they played in that fight.
  Behind the infantry lines, however, the Canadian batteries were massed, and
  stuck to their posts, firing at close range and never losing a single gun.
  The final line taken by the Canadians and extended by the British and French,
  who had now re-organised and returned to the attack, was well south of St.
  Julien and north of the hamlet of Fortuin. From thence it curved down and up
  again to meet the Belgian right, and upon the Belgian fell no small amount of
  the honours of those sanguinary days.</p>

  <p>The Belgian had been pushed from Lizerne; he had seen the Yser forced, and
  had himself been subjected to attacks delivered after the emission of gases;
  but he had come back with the vigour which we have always expected from the
  Belgian Army, and had carried Lizerne at the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>The fight in that village was a prolonged and a terrible one. The Belgians
  brought their guns to close quarters and fired point-blank into the advancing
  German infantry, flinging the reinforcements back again across the Yser, and
  establishing a veritable curtain of shrapnel between the defenders of the
  village and all possible help; 600 German dead were picked up on the Lizerne
  front alone.</p>

  <p>The second battle for Ypres had been, from the German point of view, much
  more successful than the first attack, since they had reduced the line to the
  left and had given themselves a new point from whence they might shell the
  town and its communications. The impartial estimate places the German losses
  in those successive attacks upon the Canadian front at from 12,000 to 15,000,
  but since the enemy occupied the ground on which those losses occurred, it is
  difficult to form an estimate. The Canadian losses were very heavy indeed. A
  statement issued by General Hughes, the Canadian Minister of Militia, gave a
  total of six thousand Canadian casualties between April 22 and April 30.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">DESPATCHES RECEIVED FROM GENERAL FRENCH,<br>
  FEBRUARY 2&mdash;JUNE 15, 1915</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following Despatch was received on February 12 by the
  Secretary of State for War from the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, The
  British Army in the Field:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="first">General Headquarters,</p>

  <p class="first"><i>February 2, 1915.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p>I have the honour to forward a further report on the operations of the
  Army under my command.</p>

  <p>I. In the period under review the salient feature was the presence of His
  Majesty the King in the Field. His Majesty arrived at Headquarters on
  November 30, and left on December 5.</p>

  <p>At a time when the strength and endurance of the troops had been tried to
  the utmost throughout the long and arduous Battle of Ypres-Armentières, the
  presence of His Majesty in their midst was of the greatest possible help and
  encouragement.</p>

  <p>His Majesty visited all parts of the extensive area of operations, and
  held numerous inspections of the troops behind the line of trenches.</p>

  <p>On November 16 Lieutenant His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, K.G.,
  Grenadier Guards, joined my Staff as Aide-de-Camp.</p>

  <p>II. Since the date of my last report the operations of the Army under my
  command have been subject almost entirely to the limitations of weather.</p>

  <p>History teaches us that the course of campaigns in Europe, which have been
  actively prosecuted during the months of December and January, have been
  largely influenced by weather conditions. It should, however, be thoroughly
  understood throughout the country that the most recent development of
  armaments and the latest methods of conducting warfare have added greatly to
  the difficulties and drawbacks of a vigorous winter campaign.</p>

  <p>To cause anything more than a waste of ammunition long-range artillery
  fire requires constant and accurate observation; but this most necessary
  condition is rendered impossible of attainment in the midst of continual fog
  and mist.</p>

  <p>Again, armies have now grown accustomed to rely largely on aircraft
  reconnaissance for accurate information of the enemy; but the effective
  performance of this service is materially influenced by wind and weather.</p>

  <p>The deadly accuracy, range, and quick-firing capabilities of the modern
  rifle and machine gun require that a fire-swept zone be crossed in the
  shortest possible space of time by attacking troops. But if men are detained
  under the enemy's fire by the difficulty of emerging from a water-logged
  trench, and by the necessity of passing over ground knee-deep in holding mud
  and slush, such attacks become practically prohibitive owing to the losses
  they entail.</p>

  <p>During the exigencies of the heavy fighting which ended in the last week
  of November the French and British Forces had become somewhat mixed up,
  entailing a certain amount of difficulty in matters of supply and in securing
  unity of command.</p>

  <p>By the end of November I was able to concentrate the Army under my command
  in one area, and, by holding a shorter line, to establish effective
  reserves.</p>

  <p>By the beginning of December there was a considerable falling off in the
  volume of artillery fire directed against our front by the enemy.
  Reconnaissance and reports showed that a certain amount of artillery had been
  withdrawn. We judged that the cavalry in our front, with the exception of one
  Division of the Guard, had disappeared.</p>

  <p>There did not, however, appear to have been any great diminution in the
  numbers of infantry holding the trenches.</p>

  <p>III. Although both artillery and rifle fire were exchanged with the enemy
  every day, and sniping went on more or less continuously during the hours of
  daylight, the operations which call for special record or comment are
  comparatively few.</p>

  <p>During the last week in November some successful minor night operations
  were carried out in the 4th Corps.</p>

  <p>On the night of November 23-24 a small party of the 2nd Lincolnshire
  Regiment, under Lieutenant E.H. Impey, cleared three of the enemy's advanced
  trenches opposite the 25th Brigade and withdrew without loss.</p>

  <p>On the night of the 24th-25th Captain J.R. Minshull Ford, Royal Welsh
  Fusiliers, and Lieutenant E. L. Morris, Royal Engineers, with 15 men of the
  Royal Engineers and Royal Welsh Fusiliers, successfully mined and blew up a
  group of farms immediately in front of the German trenches on the
  Touquet-Bridoux Road which had been used by German snipers.</p>

  <p>On the night of November 26-27 a small party of the 2nd Scots Guards,
  under Lieutenant Sir E. H. W. Hulse, Bt., rushed the trenches opposite the
  20th Brigade; and after pouring a heavy fire into them returned with useful
  information as to the strength of the Germans and the position of machine
  guns.</p>

  <p>The trenches opposite the 25th Brigade were rushed the same night by a
  patrol of the 2nd Rifle Brigade, under Lieutenant E. Durham.</p>

  <p>On November 23 the 112th Regiment of the 14th German Army Corps succeeded
  in capturing some 800 yards of the trenches held by the Indian Corps, but the
  General Officer Commanding the Meerut Division organised a powerful counter-
  attack, which lasted throughout the night. At daybreak on November 24 the
  line was entirely re-established.</p>

  <p>The operation was a costly one, involving many casualties, but the enemy
  suffered far more heavily.</p>

  <p>We captured over 100 prisoners, including 3 officers, as well as 3 machine
  guns and 2 trench mortars.</p>

  <p>On December 7 the concentration of the Indian Corps was completed by the
  arrival of the Sirhind Brigade from Egypt.</p>

  <p>On December 9 the enemy attempted to commence a strong attack against the
  3rd Corps, particularly in front of the trenches held by the Argyll and
  Sutherland Highlanders and the Middlesex Regiment.</p>

  <p>They were driven back with heavy loss, and did not renew the attempt. Our
  casualties were very slight.</p>

  <p>During the early days of December certain indications along the whole
  front of the Allied Line induced the French Commanders and myself to believe
  that the enemy had withdrawn considerable forces from the Western
  Theatre.</p>

  <p>Arrangements were made with the Commander of the 8th French Army for an
  attack to be commenced on the morning of December 14.</p>

  <p>Operations began at 7 a.m. by a combined heavy artillery bombardment by
  the two French and the 2nd British Corps.</p>

  <p>The British objectives were the Petit Bois and the Maedelsteed Spur, lying
  respectively to the west and south-west of the village of Wytschaete.</p>

  <p>At 7.45 a.m. the Royal Scots, with great dash, rushed forward and attacked
  the former, while the Gordon Highlanders attacked the latter place.</p>

  <p>The Royal Scots, commanded by Major F. J. Duncan, D.S.O., in face of a
  terrible machine-gun and rifle fire, carried the German trench on the west
  edge of the Petit Bois, capturing two machine guns and 53 prisoners,
  including one officer.</p>

  <p>The Gordon Highlanders, with great gallantry, advanced up the Maedelsteed
  Spur, forcing the enemy to evacuate their front trench. They were, however,
  losing heavily, and found themselves unable to get any further. At nightfall
  they were obliged to fall back to their original position.</p>

  <p>Captain C. Boddam-Whetham and Lieutenant W. F. R. Dobie showed splendid
  dash, and with a few men entered the enemy's leading trenches; but they were
  all either killed or captured.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant G. R. V. Hume-Gore and Lieutenant W. H. Paterson also
  distinguished themselves by their gallant leading.</p>

  <p>Although not successful, the operation was most creditable to the fighting
  spirit of the Gordon Highlanders, most ably commanded by Major A. W. F.
  Baird, D.S.O.</p>

  <p>As the 32nd French Division on the left had been unable to make any
  progress, the further advance of our infantry into the Wytschaete Wood was
  not practicable.</p>

  <p>Possession of the western edge of the Petit Bois was, however,
  retained.</p>

  <p>The ground was devoid of cover and so water-logged that a rapid advance
  was impossible, the men sinking deep in the mud at every step they took.</p>

  <p>The artillery throughout the day was very skilfully handled by the
  C.R.A.'s of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Divisions: Major-General F. D. V. Wing,
  C.B., Brigadier- General G. F. Milne, C.B., D.S.O., and Brigadier-General J.
  E. W. Headlam, C.B., D.S.O.</p>

  <p>The casualties during the day were about 17 officers and 407 other ranks.
  The losses of the enemy were very considerable, large numbers of dead being
  found in the Petit Bois and also in the communicating trenches in front of
  the Gordon Highlanders, in one of which a hundred were counted by a night
  patrol.</p>

  <p>On this day the artillery of the 4th Division, 3rd Corps, was used in
  support of the attack, under orders of the General Officer Commanding 2nd
  Corps.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the 3rd Corps made demonstrations against the enemy with
  a view to preventing him from detaching troops to the area of operations of
  the 2nd Corps.</p>

  <p>From December 15-17 the offensive operations which were commenced on the
  14th were continued, but were confined chiefly to artillery bombardment.</p>

  <p>The infantry advance against Wytschaete Wood was not practicable until the
  French on our left could make some progress to afford protection to that
  flank.</p>

  <p>On the 17th it was agreed that the plan of attack as arranged should be
  modified; but I was requested to continue demonstrations along my line in
  order to assist and support certain French operations which were being
  conducted elsewhere.</p>

  <p>IV. In his desire to act with energy up to his instructions to demonstrate
  and occupy the enemy, the General Officer Commanding the Indian Corps decided
  to take the advantage of what appeared to him a favourable opportunity to
  launch attacks against the advanced trenches in his front on December 18 and
  19.</p>

  <p>The attack of the Meerut Division on the left was made on the morning of
  the 19th with energy and determination, and was at first attended with
  considerable success, the enemy's advanced trenches being captured. Later on,
  however, a counter-attack drove them back to their original position with
  considerable loss.</p>

  <p>The attack of the Lahore Division commenced at 4.30 a.m. It was carried
  out by two companies each of the 1st Highland Light Infantry and the 1st
  Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles, of the Sirhind Brigade, under
  Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. H. Ronaldson. This attack was completely successful,
  two lines of the enemy's trenches being captured with little loss.</p>

  <p>Before daylight the captured trenches were filled with as many men as they
  would hold. The front was very restricted, communication to the rear
  impossible.</p>

  <p>At daybreak it was found that the position was practically untenable. Both
  flanks were in the air, and a supporting attack, which was late in starting,
  and, therefore, conducted during daylight, failed; although attempted with
  the greatest gallantry and resolution.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Ronaldson held on till dusk, when the whole of the
  captured trenches had to be evacuated, and the detachment fell back to its
  original line.</p>

  <p>By the night of December 19 nearly all the ground gained during the day
  had been lost.</p>

  <p>From daylight on December 20 the enemy commenced a heavy fire from
  artillery and trench mortars on the whole front of the Indian Corps. This was
  followed by infantry attacks, which were in especial force against Givenchy,
  and between that place and La Quinque Rue.</p>

  <p>At about 10 a.m. the enemy succeeded in driving back the Sirhind Brigade,
  and capturing a considerable part of Givenchy, but the 57th Rifles and 9th
  Bhopals, north of the canal, and the Connaught Rangers, south of it, stood
  firm.</p>

  <p>The 15th Sikhs of the Divisional Reserve were already supporting the
  Sirhind Brigade. On the news of the retirement of the latter being received,
  the 47th Sikhs were also sent up to reinforce General Brunker. The 1st
  Manchester Regiment, 4th Suffolk Regiment, and two battalions of French
  Territorials under General Carnegy were ordered to launch a vigorous
  counterattack from Pont Fixe through Givenchy to retake by a flank attack the
  trenches lost by the Sirhind Brigade.</p>

  <p>Orders were sent to General Carnegy to divert his attack on Givenchy
  Village, and to re-establish the situation there.</p>

  <p>A battalion of the 58th French Division was sent to Annequin in
  support.</p>

  <p>About 5 p.m. a gallant attack by the 1st Manchester Regiment and one
  company of the 4th Suffolk Regiment had captured Givenchy, and had cleared
  the enemy out of the two lines of trenches to the North-East. To the east of
  the village the 9th Bhopal Infantry and 57th Rifles had maintained their
  positions, but the enemy were still in possession of our trenches to the
  north of the village.</p>

  <p>General Macbean, with the Secunderabad Cavalry Brigade, 2nd Battalion, 8th
  Gurkha Rifles, and the 47th Sikhs, was sent up to support General Brunker,
  who at 2 p.m. directed General Macbean to move to a position of readiness in
  the second-line trenches from Maris northward, and to counter-attack
  vigorously if opportunity offered.</p>

  <p>Some considerable delay appears to have occurred, and it was not until 1
  a.m. on the 21st that the 47th Sikhs and the 7th Dragoon Guards under the
  command of Lieutenant-Colonel H. A. Lemprière, D.S.O., of the latter
  regiment, were launched in counter-attack.</p>

  <p>They reached the enemy's trenches, but were driven out by enfilade fire,
  their gallant Commander being killed.</p>

  <p>The main attack by the remainder of General Macbean's force, with the
  remnants of Lieutenant-Colonel Lemprière's detachment (which had again been
  rallied), was finally pushed in at about 4.30 a.m., and also failed.</p>

  <p>In the northern section of the defensive line the retirement of the 2nd
  Battalion, 2nd Gurkha Rifles, at about 10 a.m. on the 20th, had left the
  flank of the 1st Seaforth Highlanders, on the extreme right of the Meerut
  Division line, much exposed. This battalion was left shortly afterwards
  completely in the air by the retirement of the Sirhind Brigade.</p>

  <p>The 58th Rifles, therefore, were ordered to support the left of the
  Seaforth Highlanders, to fill the gap created by the retirement of the
  Gurkhas.</p>

  <p>During the whole of the afternoon strenuous efforts were made by the
  Seaforth Highlanders to clear the trenches to their right and left. The 1st
  Battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles, reinforced the 2nd Gurkhas near the orchard
  where the Germans were in occupation of the trenches abandoned by the latter
  regiment. The Garhwal Brigade was being very heavily attacked, and their
  trenches and loopholes were much damaged; but the brigade continued to hold
  its front and attack, connecting with the 6th Jats on the left of the Dehra
  Dun Brigade.</p>

  <p>No advance in force was made by the enemy, but the troops were pinned to
  their ground by heavy artillery fire, the Seaforth Highlanders especially
  suffering heavily.</p>

  <p>Shortly before nightfall the 2nd Royal Highlanders on the right of the
  Seaforth Highlanders had succeeded in establishing touch with the Sirhind
  Brigade; and the continuous line (though dented near the orchard) existed
  throughout the Meerut Division.</p>

  <p>Early in the afternoon of December 20 orders were sent to the 1st Corps,
  which was then in general army reserve, to send an infantry brigade to
  support the Indian Corps.</p>

  <p>The 1st Brigade was ordered to Bethune, and reached that place at midnight
  on December 20-21. Later in the day Sir Douglas Haig was ordered to move the
  whole of the 1st Division in support of the Indian Corps.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Brigade reached Bethune between S a.m. and 9 a.m. on the 21st, and
  on the same date the 2nd Brigade arrived at Lacon at 1 p.m.</p>

  <p>The 1 st Brigade was directed on Givenchy, via Pont Fixe, and the 3rd
  Brigade, through Gorre, on the trenches evacuated by the Sirhind Brigade.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Brigade was directed to support; the Dehra Dun Brigade being
  placed at the disposal of the General Officer Commanding Meerut Division.</p>

  <p>At 1 p.m. the General Officer Commanding 1st Division directed the 1st
  Brigade in attack from the west of Givenchy in a north-easterly direction,
  and the 3rd Brigade from Festubert in an east-north-easterly direction, the
  object being to pass the position originally held by us and to capture the
  German trenches 400 yards to the east of it.</p>

  <p>By s p.m. the 1st Brigade had obtained a hold in Givenchy, and the ground
  south as far as the canal; and the 3rd Brigade had progressed to a point half
  a mile west of Festubert.</p>

  <p>By nightfall the 1st South Wales Borderers and the 2nd Welsh Regiment of
  the 3rd Brigade had made a lodgment in the original trenches to the
  north-east of Festubert, the 1st Gloucestershire Regiment continuing the line
  southward along the track east of Festubert.</p>

  <p>The 1st Brigade had established itself on the east side of Givenchy.</p>

  <p>By 3 p.m. the 2nd Brigade was concentrated at Le Touret, and was ordered
  to retake the trenches which had been lost by the Dehra Dun Brigade.</p>

  <p>By 10 p.m. the support trenches west of the orchard had been carried, but
  the original fire trenches had been so completely destroyed that they could
  not be occupied.</p>

  <p>This operation was performed by the 1st Loyal North Lancashire Regiment
  and the 1st Northamptonshire Regiment, supported by the 2nd King's Royal
  Rifle Corps, in reserve.</p>

  <p>Throughout this day the units of the Indian Corps rendered all the
  assistance and support they could in view of their exhausted condition.</p>

  <p>At 1 p.m. on the 22nd Sir Douglas Haig took over command from Sir James
  Willcocks. The situation in the front line was then approximately as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>South of the La Bassée Canal the Connaught Rangers of the Ferozepore
  Brigade had not been attacked. North of the canal a short length of our
  original line was still held by the 9th Bhopals and the 57th Rifles of the
  same brigade. Connecting with the latter was the 1st Brigade holding the
  village of Givenchy and its eastern and northern approaches. On the left of
  the 1st Brigade was the 3rd Brigade. Touch had been lost between the left of
  the former and the right of the latter. The 3rd Brigade held a line along,
  and in places advanced to, the east of the Festubert Road. Its left was in
  communication with the right of the Meerut Division line, where troops of the
  2nd Brigade had just relieved the 1st Seaforth Highlanders. To the north,
  units of the 2nd Brigade held an indented line west of the orchard,
  connecting with half of the 2nd Royal Highlanders, half of the 41st Dogras
  and the 1st Battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles. From this point to the north the
  6th Jats and the whole of the Garhwal Brigade occupied the original line
  which they had held from the commencement of the operations.</p>

  <p>The relief of most units of the southern sector was effected on the night
  of December 22. The Meerut Division remained under the orders of the 1st
  Corps, and was not completely withdrawn until December 27..</p>

  <p>In the evening the position at Givenchy was practically re-established,
  and the 3rd Brigade had re-occupied the old line of trenches.</p>

  <p>During the 23rd the enemy's activities ceased, and the whole position was
  restored to very much its original condition.</p>

  <p>In my last despatch I had occasion to mention the prompt and ready help I
  received from the Lahore Division, under the command of Major-General H. B.
  B. Watkis, C.B., which was thrown into action immediately on arrival, when
  the British Forces were very hard pressed during the battle of Ypres-
  Armentières.</p>

  <p>The Indian troops have fought with the utmost steadfastness and gallantry
  whenever they have been called upon.</p>

  <p>Weather conditions were abnormally bad, the snow and floods precluding any
  active operations during the first three weeks of January.</p>

  <p>V. At 7.30 a.m. on January 25 the enemy began to shell Bethune, and at 8
  a.m. a strong hostile infantry attack developed south of the canal, preceded
  by a heavy bombardment of artillery, <i>Minenwerfer</i> and, possibly, the
  explosion of mines, though the latter is doubtful.</p>

  <p>The British line south of the canal formed a pronounced salient from the
  canal on the left, hence running forward toward the railway triangle and back
  to the main La Bassée-Bethune Road, where it joined the French. This line was
  occupied by half a battalion of the Scots Guards, and half a battalion of the
  Coldstream Guards, of the 1st Infantry Brigade. The trenches in the salient
  were blown in almost at once; and the enemy's attack penetrated this line.
  Our troops retired to a partially prepared second line, running approximately
  due north and south from the canal to the road, some 500 yards west of the
  railway triangle. This second line had been strengthened by the construction
  of a keep half-way between the canal and the road. Here the other two half
  battalions of the above-mentioned regiments were in support.</p>

  <p>These supports held up the enemy, who, however, managed to establish
  himself in the brick stacks and some communication trenches between the keep,
  the road and the canal&mdash;and even beyond and west of the keep on either
  side of it.</p>

  <p>The London Scottish had in the meantime been sent up in support, and a
  counter- attack was organised with the 1st Royal Highlanders, part of the 1st
  Cameron Highlanders, and the 2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps, the latter
  regiment having been sent forward from the Divisional Reserve.</p>

  <p>The counter-attack was delayed in order to synchronise with a
  counter-attack north of the canal which was arranged for 1 p.m.</p>

  <p>At 1 p.m. these troops moved forward, their flanks making good progress
  near the road and the canal, but their centre being held up. The 2nd Royal
  Sussex Regiment was then sent forward, late in the afternoon, to reinforce.
  The result was that the Germans were driven back far enough to enable a
  somewhat broken line to be taken up, running from the culvert on the railway,
  almost due south to the keep, and thence southeast to the main road.</p>

  <p>The French left near the road had also been attacked and driven back a
  little, but not to so great an extent as the British right. Consequently, the
  French left was in advance of the British right and exposed to a possible
  flank attack from the north.</p>

  <p>The Germans did not, however, persevere further in their attack.</p>

  <p>The above-mentioned line was strengthened during the night, and the 1st
  Guards Brigade, which had suffered severely, was withdrawn into reserve and
  replaced by the 2nd Infantry Brigade.</p>

  <p>While this was taking place another, and equally severe, attack was
  delivered north of the canal against the village of Givenchy.</p>

  <p>At 8.15 a.m., after a heavy artillery bombardment with high explosive
  shells, the enemy's infantry advanced under the effective fire of our
  artillery, which, however, was hampered by the constant interruption of
  telephonic communication between the observers and batteries. Nevertheless,
  our artillery fire, combined with that of the infantry in the fire trenches,
  had the effect of driving the enemy from his original direction of advance,
  with the result that his troops crowded together on the north-east corner of
  the village and broke through into the centre of the village as far as the
  keep, which had been previously put in a state of defence. The Germans had
  lost heavily, and a well-timed local counter- attack, delivered by the
  reserves of the 2nd Welsh Regiment and 1st South Wales Borderers, and by a
  company of the 1st Royal Highlanders (lent by the 1st Brigade as a working
  party&mdash;this company was at work on the keep at the time), was completely
  successful, with the result that, after about an hour's street fighting, all
  who had broken into the village were either captured or killed; and the
  original line round the village was re-established by noon.</p>

  <p>South of the village, however, and close to the canal, the right of the
  2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers fell back in conformity with the troops south of
  the canal; but after dark that regiment moved forward and occupied the old
  line.</p>

  <p>During the course of the attack on Givenchy the enemy made five assaults
  on the salient at the north-east of the village about French Farm, but was
  repulsed every time with heavy loss.</p>

  <p>V. On the morning of January 29 attacks were made on the right of the 1st
  Corps, south of the canal in the neighbourhood of La Bassée.</p>

  <p>The enemy (part of the 14th German Corps), after a severe shelling, made a
  violent attack with scaling ladders on the keep, also to the north and south
  of it. In the keep and on the north side the Sussex Regiment held the enemy
  off, inflicting on him severe losses. On the south side the hostile infantry
  succeeded in reaching the Northamptonshire Regiment's trenches; but were
  immediately counter-attacked and all killed. Our artillery co-operated well
  with the infantry in repelling the attack.</p>

  <p>In this action our casualties were inconsiderable, but the enemy lost
  severely, more than 200 of his killed alone being left in front of our
  position.</p>

  <p>VI. On February 1 a fine piece of work was carried out by the 4th Brigade
  in the neighbourhood of Cuinchy.</p>

  <p>Some of the 2nd Coldstream Guards were driven from their trenches at 2.30
  a.m., but made a stand some twenty yards east of them in a position which
  they held till morning.</p>

  <p>A counter-attack, launched at 3.15 a.m. by one company of the Irish Guards
  and half a company of the 2nd Coldstream Guards, proved unsuccessful, owing
  to heavy rifle fire from the east and south.</p>

  <p>At 10.5 a.m., acting under orders of the 1st Division, a heavy bombardment
  was opened on the lost ground for ten minutes; and this was followed
  immediately by an assault by about 50 men of the 2nd Coldstream Guards with
  bayonets, led by Captain A. Leigh Bennett, followed by 30 men of the Irish
  Guards, led by Second Lieutenant F. F. Graham, also with bayonets. These were
  followed by a party of Royal Engineers with sand bags and wire.</p>

  <p>All the ground which had been lost was brilliantly retaken; the 2nd
  Coldstream Guards also taking another German trench and capturing two machine
  guns.</p>

  <p>Thirty-two prisoners fell into our hands.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding 1st Division describes the preparation by
  the artillery as "splendid, the high explosive shells dropping in the exact
  spot with absolute precision."</p>

  <p>In forwarding his report on this engagement, the General Officer
  Commanding First Army writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Special credit is due&mdash;</p>

  <p>(i) To Major-General Haking, Commanding 1st Division, for the prompt
  manner in which he arranged this counter-attack, and for the general plan of
  action, which was crowned with success.</p>

  <p>(ii) To the General Officer Commanding the 4th Brigade (Lord Cavan) for
  the thorough manner in which he carried out the orders of the General Officer
  Commanding the Division.</p>

  <p>(iii) To the regimental officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the
  2nd Coldstream Guards and Irish Guards, who, with indomitable pluck, stormed
  two sets of barricades, captured three German trenches, two machine guns, and
  killed or made prisoners many of the enemy.</p>

  <p>VII. During the period under report the Royal Flying Corps has again
  performed splendid service.</p>

  <p>Although the weather was almost uniformly bad and the machines suffered
  from constant exposure, there have been only thirteen days on which no actual
  reconnaissance has been effected. Approximately, one hundred thousand miles
  have been flown.</p>

  <p>In addition to the daily and constant work of reconnaissance and
  co-operation with the artillery, a number of aerial combats have been fought,
  raids carried out, detrainments harassed, parks and petrol <i>depôts</i>
  bombed, etc.</p>

  <p>Various successful bomb-dropping raids have been carried out, usually
  against the enemy's aircraft material. The principle of attacking hostile
  aircraft whenever and wherever seen (unless highly important information is
  being delivered) has been adhered to, and has resulted in the moral fact that
  enemy machines invariably beat immediate retreat when chased.</p>

  <p>Five German aeroplanes are known to have been brought to the ground, and
  it would appear probable that others, though they have managed to reach their
  own lines, have done so in a considerably damaged condition.</p>

  <p>VIII. In my despatch of November 20, 1914, 1 referred to the
  reinforcements of Territorial Troops which I had received, and I mentioned
  several units which had already been employed in the fighting line.</p>

  <p>In the positions which I held for some years before the outbreak of this
  war I was brought into close contact with the Territorial Force, and I found
  every reason to hope and believe that, when the hour of trial arrived, they
  would justify every hope and trust which was placed in them.</p>

  <p>The Lords Lieutenant of Counties and the Associations which worked under
  them bestowed a vast amount of labour and energy on the organisation of the
  Territorial Force; and I trust it may be some recompense to them to know that
  I, and the principal Commanders serving under me, consider that the
  Territorial Force has far more than justified the most sanguine hopes that
  any of us ventured to entertain of their value and use in the field.
  Commanders of Cavalry Divisions are unstinted in their praise of the manner
  in which the Yeomanry regiments attached to their brigades have done their
  duty, both in and out of action. The service of Divisional Cavalry is now
  almost entirely performed by Yeomanry, and Divisional Commanders report that
  they are very efficient.</p>

  <p>Army Corps Commanders are loud in their praise of the Territorial
  Battalions which form part of nearly all the brigades at the front in the
  first line, and more than one of them have told me that these battalions are
  fast approaching&mdash; if they have not already reached&mdash;the standard
  of efficiency of Regular Infantry.</p>

  <p>I wish to add a word about the Officers Training Corps. The presence of
  the Artists' Rifles (28th Battalion, The London Regiment) with the Army in
  France enabled me also to test the value of this organisation.</p>

  <p>Having had some experience in peace of the working of the Officers
  Training Corps, I determined to turn the Artists' Rifles (which formed part
  of the Officers Training Corps in peace time) to its legitimate use. I
  therefore established the battalion as a Training Corps for Officers in the
  field.</p>

  <p>The cadets pass through a course, which includes some thoroughly practical
  training as all cadets do a tour of 48 hours in the trenches, and afterwards
  write a report on what they see and notice. They also visit an observation
  post of a battery or group of batteries, and spend some hours there.</p>

  <p>A Commandant has been appointed, and he arranges and supervises the work,
  sets schemes for practice, administers the school, delivers lectures, and
  reports on the candidates.</p>

  <p>The cadets are instructed in all branches of military training suitable
  for platoon commanders.</p>

  <p>Machine-gun tactics, a knowledge of which is so necessary for all junior
  officers, is a special feature of the course of instruction.</p>

  <p>When first started the school was able to turn out officers at the rate of
  75 a month. This has since been increased to 100.</p>

  <p>Reports received from Divisional and Army Corps Commanders on officers who
  have been trained at the school are most satisfactory.</p>

  <p>IX. Since the date of my last report I have been able to make a close
  personal inspection of all the units in the command. I was most favourably
  impressed by all I saw.</p>

  <p>The troops composing the Army in France have been subjected to as severe a
  trial as it is possible to impose upon any body of men. The desperate
  fighting described in my last despatch had hardly been brought to a
  conclusion when they were called upon to face the rigours and hardships of a
  winter campaign. Frost and snow have alternated with periods of continuous
  rain.</p>

  <p>The men have been called upon to stand for many hours together almost up
  to their waists in bitterly cold water, only separated by one or two hundred
  yards from a most vigilant enemy.</p>

  <p>Although every measure which science and medical knowledge could suggest
  to mitigate these hardships was employed, the sufferings of the men have been
  very great.</p>

  <p>In spite of all this they presented, at the inspections to which I have
  referred, a most soldier-like, splendid, though somewhat war-worn appearance.
  Their spirit remains high and confident; their general health is excellent,
  and their condition most satisfactory.</p>

  <p>I regard it as most unfortunate that circumstances have prevented any
  account of many splendid instances of courage and endurance, in the face of
  almost unparalleled hardship and fatigue in war, coming regularly to the
  knowledge of the public.</p>

  <p>Reinforcements have arrived from England with remarkable promptitude and
  rapidity. They have been speedily drafted' into the ranks, and most of the
  units I inspected were nearly complete when I saw them. In appearance and
  quality the drafts sent out have exceeded my most sanguine expectations, and
  I consider the Army in France is much indebted to the Adjutant-General's
  Department at the War Office for the efficient manner in which its
  requirements have been met in this most essential respect.</p>

  <p>With regard to these inspections, I may mention in particular the fine
  appearance presented by the 27th and 28th Divisions, composed principally of
  battalions which had come from India. Included in the former division was the
  Princess Patricia's Royal Canadian Regiment. They are a magnificent set of
  men, and have since done excellent work in the trenches.</p>

  <p>It was some three weeks after the events recorded in paragraph 4 that I
  made my inspection of the Indian Corps, under Sir James Willcocks. The
  appearance they presented was most satisfactory, and fully confirmed my first
  opinion that the Indian troops only required rest, and a little
  acclimatising, to bring out all their fine inherent fighting qualities.</p>

  <p>I saw the whole of the Indian Cavalry Corps, under Lieutenant-General
  Rimington, on a mounted parade soon after their arrival. They are a
  magnificent body of Cavalry, and will, I feel sure, give the best possible
  account of themselves when called upon.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, at their own particular request, they have taken their
  turn in the trenches, and performed most useful and valuable service.</p>

  <p>X. The Rt. Rev. Bishop Taylor Smith, C.V.O., D.D., Chaplain-General to the
  Forces, arrived at my Headquarters on January 6, on a tour of inspection
  throughout the command.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster has also visited most of the Irish
  Regiments at the front and the principal centres on the line of
  communications.</p>

  <p>In a quiet and unostentatious manner the chaplains of all denominations
  have worked with devotion and energy in their respective spheres.</p>

  <p>The number with the forces in the field at the commencement of the war was
  comparatively small, but towards the end of last year the Rev. J. M. Simms,
  D.D., K.H.C., Principal Chaplain, assisted by his Secretary, the Rev. W.
  Drury, reorganised the branch, and placed the spiritual welfare of the
  soldier on a more satisfactory footing. It is hoped that the further increase
  of personnel may be found possible.</p>

  <p>I cannot speak too highly of the devoted manner in which all chaplains,
  whether with the troops in the trenches, or in attendance on the sick and
  wounded in casualty clearing stations and hospitals on the line of
  communications, have worked throughout the campaign.</p>

  <p>Since the commencement of hostilities the work of the Royal Army Medical
  Corps has been carried out with untiring zeal, skill, and devotion. Whether
  at the front under conditions such as obtained during the fighting on the
  Aisne, when casualties were heavy and accommodation for their reception had
  to be improvised, or on the line of communications, where an average of some
  11,000 patients have been daily under treatment, the organisation of the
  Medical Services has always been equal to the demands made upon it.</p>

  <p>The careful system of sanitation introduced into the Army has, with the
  assistance of other measures, kept the troops free from any epidemic, in
  support of which it is to be noticed that since the commencement of the war
  some 500 cases only of enteric have occurred.</p>

  <p>The organisation for the first time in war of Motor Ambulance Convoys is
  due to the initiative and organising powers of Surgeon-General T. J.
  O'Donnell, D.S.O., ably assisted by Major P. Evans, Royal Army Medical
  Corps.</p>

  <p>Two of these convoys, composed entirely of Red Cross Society personnel
  have done excellent work under the superintendence of Regular Medical
  Officers.</p>

  <p>Twelve Hospital Trains ply between the front and the various bases. I have
  visited several of the trains when halted in stations, and have found them
  conducted with great comfort and efficiency.</p>

  <p>During the more recent phase of the campaign the creation of Rest Depôts
  at the front has materially reduced the wastage of men to the line of
  communications.</p>

  <p>Since the latter part of October, 1914, the whole of the medical
  arrangements have been in the hands of Surgeon-General Sir A. T. Sloggett,
  C.M.G., K.H.S., under whom Surgeon-General T. P. Woodhouse and
  Surgeon-General T. J. O'Donnell have been responsible for the organisation on
  the line of communications and at the front respectively.</p>

  <p>XI. The exceptional and peculiar conditions brought about by the weather
  have caused large demands to be made upon the resources and skill of the
  Royal Engineers.</p>

  <p>Every kind of expedient has had to be thought out and adopted to keep the
  lines of trenches and defence work effective.</p>

  <p>The Royal Engineers have shown themselves as capable of overcoming the
  ravages caused by violent rain and floods as they have been throughout in
  neutralising the effect of the enemy's artillery.</p>

  <p>In this connection I wish particularly to mention the excellent services
  performed by my Chief Engineer, Brigadier-General G. H. Fowke, who has been
  indefatigable in supervising all such work. His ingenuity and skill have been
  most valuable in the local construction of the various expedients which
  experience has shown to be necessary in prolonged trench warfare.</p>

  <p>XII. I have no reason to modify in any material degree my views of the
  general military situation as expressed in my dispatch of November 20,
  1914.</p>

  <p>XIII. I have once more gratefully to acknowledge the valuable help and
  support I have received throughout this period from General Foch, General
  D'Urbal, and General Maud'huy of the French Army.</p>

  <p class="first">I have the honour to be,</p>

  <p class="first">Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,</p>

  <p class="first">J. D. P. French, Field-Marshal,<br>
  Commanding-in-Chief, The British Army in the Field.</p>
  <hr>

  <p class="first">THE following Despatch has been received by the Secretary of
  State for War from the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, the British Army in
  the Field:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="first">General Headquarters,</p>

  <p class="first"><i>April 5, 1915.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE the honour to report the operations of the Forces
  under my command since the date of my last dispatch, February 2, 1915.</p>

  <p>I. The event of chief interest and importance which has taken place is the
  victory achieved over the enemy at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which was
  fought on March 10, 11, and 12. The main attack was delivered by troops of
  the First Army under the command of General Sir Douglas Haig, supported by a
  large force of Heavy Artillery, a Division of Cavalry, and some Infantry "of
  the general reserve."</p>

  <p>Secondary and holding attacks and demonstrations were made along the front
  of the Second Army under the direction of its Commander, General Sir Horace
  Smith- Dorrien.</p>

  <p>Whilst the success attained was due to the magnificent bearing and
  indomitable courage displayed by the troops of the 4th and Indian Corps, I
  consider that the able and skilful dispositions which were made by the
  General Officer Commanding First Army contributed largely to the defeat of
  the enemy and to the capture of his position. The energy and vigour with
  which General Sir Douglas Haig handled his command show him to be a leader of
  great ability and power.</p>

  <p>Another action of considerable importance was brought about by a surprise
  attack of the Germans made on March 14 against the 27th Division holding the
  trenches east of St. Éloi. A large force of artillery was concentrated in
  this area under cover of mist, and a heavy volume of fire was suddenly
  brought to bear on the trenches at 5 p.m. This artillery attack was
  accompanied by two mine explosions; and, in the confusion caused by these and
  the suddenness of the attack, the position of St. Éloi was captured and held
  for some hours by the enemy.</p>

  <p>Well-directed and vigorous counter-attacks, in which the troops of the 5th
  Army Corps showed great bravery and determination, restored the situation by
  the evening of the 15th.</p>

  <p>A more detailed account of these operations will appear in subsequent
  pages of this despatch.</p>

  <p>II. On February 6 a brilliant action by troops of the 1st Corps materially
  improved our position in the area south of the La Bassée Canal. During the
  previous night parties of Irish Guards and of the 3rd Battalion Coldstream
  Guards had succeeded in gaining ground whence converging fire could be
  directed on the flanks and rear of certain "brick-stacks" occupied by the
  Germans, which had been for some time a source of considerable annoyance.</p>

  <p>At 2 p.m. the affair commenced with a severe bombardment of the "brick-
  stacks" and the enemy's trenches. A brisk attack by the 3rd Coldstream Guards
  and Irish Guards from our trenches west of the "brick-stacks" followed, and
  was supported by fire from the flanking positions which had been seized the
  previous night by the same regiments. The attack succeeded, the 44
  brick-stacks "were occupied without difficulty, and a line established north
  and south through a point about forty yards east of the 44 brick-stacks."</p>

  <p>The casualties suffered by the 5th Corps throughout the period under
  review, and particularly during the month of February, have been heavier than
  those in other parts of the line. I regret this; but I do not think, taking
  all the circumstances into consideration, that they were unduly numerous. The
  position then occupied by the 5th Corps has always been a very vulnerable
  part of our line; the ground is marshy, and trenches are most difficult to
  construct and maintain. The 27th and 28th Divisions of the 5th Corps have had
  no previous experience of European warfare, and a number of the units
  composing it had only recently returned from service in tropical climates. In
  consequence, the hardships of a rigorous winter campaign fell with greater
  weight upon these Divisions than upon any other in the command.</p>

  <p>Chiefly owing to these causes, the 5th Corps, up to the beginning of
  March, was constantly engaged in counter-attack to retake trenches and ground
  which had been lost.</p>

  <p>In their difficult and arduous task, however, the troops displayed the
  utmost gallantry and devotion; and it is most creditable to the skill and
  energy of their leaders that I am able to report how well they have
  surmounted all their difficulties, that the ground first taken over by them
  is still intact, and held with little greater loss than is incurred by troops
  in all other parts of the line.</p>

  <p>On February 14 the 82nd Brigade of the 27th Division was driven from its
  trenches east of St. Éloi; but by 7 a.m. on the 15th all these trenches had
  been recaptured, fifteen prisoners taken, and sixty German dead counted in
  front of the trenches. Similarly in the 28th Division trenches were lost by
  the 85th Brigade and retaken the following night.</p>

  <p>During the month of February the enemy made several attempts to get
  through all along the line, but he was invariably repulsed with loss. A
  particularly vigorous attempt was made on February 17 against the trenches
  held by the Indian Corps, but it was brilliantly repulsed.</p>

  <p>On February 28 a successful minor attack was made on the enemy's trenches
  near St. Éloi by small parties of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light
  Infantry. The attack was divided into three small groups, the whole under the
  command of Lieutenant Crabbe: No. 1 Group under Lieutenant Papineau, No. 2
  Group under Sergeant Patterson, and No. 3 Group under Company Sergeant-Major
  Lloyd.</p>

  <p>The head of the party got within fifteen or twenty yards of the German
  trench and charged; it was dark at the time (about 5.15 a.m.).</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Crabbe, who showed the greatest dash and <i>élan</i>, took his
  party over everything in the trench until they had gone down it about eighty
  yards, when they were stopped by a barricade of sandbags and timber. This
  party, as well as the others, then pulled down the front face of the German
  parapet. A number of Germans were killed and wounded, and a few prisoners
  were taken.</p>

  <p>The services performed by this distinguished corps have continued to be
  very valuable since I had occasion to refer to them in my last despatch. They
  have been most ably organised, trained, and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
  F. D. Farquhar, D.S.O., who, I deeply regret to say, was killed while
  superintending some trench work on March 20. His loss will be deeply
  felt.</p>

  <p>A very gallant attack was made by the 4th Battalion of the King's Royal
  Rifle Corps of the 80th Brigade on the enemy's trenches in the early hours of
  March 2. The Battalion was led by Major Widdrington, who launched it at 12.30
  a.m. (he himself being wounded during its progress), covered by an extremely
  accurate and effective artillery fire. About sixty yards of the enemy's
  trench were cleared, but the attack was brought to a standstill by a very
  strong barricade, in attempting to storm which several casualties were
  incurred.</p>

  <p>III. During the month of February I arranged with General Foch to render
  the 9th French Corps, holding the trenches on my left, some much-needed rest
  by sending the three Divisions of the British Cavalry Corps to hold a portion
  of the French trenches, each division for a period of ten days
  alternately.</p>

  <p>It was very gratifying to me to note once again in this campaign the eager
  readiness which the Cavalry displayed to undertake a <i>rôle</i> which does
  not properly belong to them in order to support and assist their French
  comrades.</p>

  <p>In carrying out this work leaders, officers, and men displayed the same
  skill and energy which I have had reason to comment upon in former
  despatches.</p>

  <p>The time passed by the Cavalry in the French trenches was, on the whole,
  quiet and uneventful, but there are one or two incidents calling for
  remark.</p>

  <p>At about 1.45 a.m. on February 16 a half-hearted attack was made against
  the right of the line held by the 2nd Cavalry Division, but it was easily
  repulsed by rifle fire, and the enemy left several dead in front of the
  trenches. The attack was delivered against the second and third trenches from
  the right of the line of this Division.</p>

  <p>At 6 a.m. on the 21st the enemy blew up one of the 2nd Cavalry Division
  trenches, held by the 16th Lancers, and some adjoining French trenches. The
  enemy occupied forty yards of our trench and tried to advance, but were
  stopped. An immediate counter-attack by the supporting squadron was stopped
  by machine-gun fire. The line was established opposite the gap, and a
  counterattack by two squadrons and one company of French reserve was ordered.
  At 5.30 p.m. 2nd Cavalry Division reported that the counter-attack did not
  succeed in re-taking the trench blown in, but that a new line had been
  established forty yards in rear of it, and that there was no further activity
  on the part of the enemy. At 10 p.m. the situation was unchanged.</p>

  <p>The Commander of the Indian Cavalry Corps expressed a strong desire that
  the troops under his command should gain some experience in trench warfare.
  Arrangements were made, therefore, with the General Officer Commanding the
  Indian Corps, in pursuance of which the various units of the Indian Cavalry
  Corps have from time to time taken a turn in the trenches, and have thereby
  gained some valuable experience.</p>

  <p>IV. About the end of February many vital considerations induced me to
  believe that a vigorous offensive movement by the Forces under my command
  should be planned and carried out at the earliest possible moment.</p>

  <p>Amongst the more important reasons which convinced me of this necessity
  were:&mdash; The general aspect of the Allied situation throughout Europe,
  and particularly the marked success of the Russian Army in repelling the
  violent onslaughts of Marshal von Hindenburg; the apparent weakening of the
  enemy in my front, and the necessity for assisting our Russian Allies to the
  utmost by holding as many hostile troops as possible in the Western Theatre;
  the efforts to this end which were being made by the French Forces at Arras
  and Champagne; and, perhaps the most weighty consideration of all, the need
  of fostering the offensive spirit in the troops under my command after the
  trying and possibly enervating experiences which they had gone through of a
  severe winter in the trenches.</p>

  <p>In a former despatch I commented upon the difficulties and drawbacks which
  the winter weather in this climate imposes upon a vigorous offensive. Early
  in March these difficulties became greatly lessened by the drying up of the
  country and by spells of brighter weather.</p>

  <p>I do not propose in this despatch to enter at length into the
  considerations which actuated me in deciding upon the plan, time, and place
  of my attack, but Your Lordship is fully aware of these.</p>

  <p>As mentioned above, the main attack was carried out by units of the First
  Army, supported by troops of the Second Army and the general reserve.</p>

  <p>The object of the main attack was to be the capture of the village of
  Neuve Chapelle and the enemy's position at that point, and the establishment
  of our line as far forward as possible to the east of that place.</p>

  <p>The object, nature, and scope of the attack, and instructions for the
  conduct of the operation were communicated by me to Sir Douglas Haig in a
  secret memorandum dated February 19.</p>

  <p>The main topographical feature of this part of the theatre is a marked
  ridge which runs south-west from a point two miles south-west of Lille to the
  village of Fournes, whence two spurs run out, one due west to a height known
  as Haut Pommereau, the other following the line of the main road to
  lilies.</p>

  <p>The buildings of the village of Neuve Chapelle run along the Rue du Bois-
  Fauquisart Road. There is a triangle of roads just north of the village. This
  area consists of a few big houses, with walls, gardens, orchards, etc., and
  here, with the aid of numerous machine-guns, the enemy had established a
  strong post which flanked the approaches to the village.</p>

  <p>The Bois du Biez, which lies roughly south-east of the village of Neuve
  Chapelle, influenced the course of this operation.</p>

  <p>Full instructions as to assisting and supporting the attack were issued to
  the Second Army.</p>

  <p>The battle opened at 7.30 a.m. on March 10 by a powerful artillery
  bombardment of the enemy's position at Neuve Chapelle. The artillery
  bombardment had been well prepared and was most effective, except on the
  extreme northern portion of the front of attack.</p>

  <p>At 8.5 a.m. the 23rd (left) and 25th (right) Brigades of the 8th Division
  assaulted the German trenches on the north-west of the village.</p>

  <p>At the same hour the Garhwal Brigade of the Meerut Division, which
  occupied the position to the south of Neuve Chapelle, assaulted the German
  trenches in its front.</p>

  <p>The Garhwal Brigade and the 25th Brigade carried the enemy's lines of
  entrenchments where the wire entanglements had been almost entirely swept
  away by our shrapnel fire. The 23rd Brigade, however, on the northeast, was
  held up by the wire entanglements, which were not sufficiently cut.</p>

  <p>At 8.5 a.m. the artillery turned on to Neuve Chapelle, and at 8.35 a.m.
  the advance of the infantry was continued.</p>

  <p>The 25th and Garhwal Brigades pushed on eastward and north-eastward
  respectively, and succeeded in getting a footing in the village. The 23rd
  Brigade was still held up in front of the enemy's wire entanglements, and
  could not progress. Heavy losses were suffered, especially in the Middlesex
  Regiment and the Scottish Rifles. The progress, however, of the 25th Brigade
  into Neuve Chapelle immediately to the south of the 23rd Brigade had the
  effect of turning the southern flank of the enemy's defences in front of the
  23rd Brigade.</p>

  <p>This fact, combined with powerful artillery support, enabled the 23rd
  Brigade to get forward between 10 and 11 a.m., and by 11 a.m. the whole of
  the village of Neuve Chapelle and the roads leading northward and
  south-westward from the eastern end of that village were in our hands.</p>

  <p>During this time our artillery completely cut off the village and the
  surrounding country from any German reinforcements which could be thrown into
  the fight to restore the situation by means of a curtain of shrapnel fire.
  Prisoners subsequently reported that all attempts at reinforcing the front
  line were checked.</p>

  <p>Steps were at once taken to consolidate the position won.</p>

  <p>Considerable delay occurred after the capture of the Neuve Chapelle
  position. The infantry was greatly disorganised by the violent nature of the
  attack and by its passage through the enemy's trenches and the buildings of
  the village. It was necessary to get units to some extent together before
  pushing on. The telephonic communication being cut by the enemy's fire
  rendered communication between front and rear most difficult. The fact of the
  left of the 23rd Brigade having been held up had kept back the 8th Division,
  and had involved a portion of the 25th Brigade in fighting to the north out
  of its proper direction of advance. All this required adjustment. An orchard
  held by the enemy north of Neuve Chapelle also threatened the flank of an
  advance towards the Aubers Ridge.</p>

  <p>I am of opinion that this delay would not have occurred had the clearly
  expressed order of the General Officer Commanding First Army been more
  carefully observed.</p>

  <p>The difficulties above enumerated might have been overcome at an earlier
  period of the day if the General Officer Commanding 4th Corps had been able
  to bring his reserve brigades more speedily into action.</p>

  <p>As it was, the further advance did not commence before 3.30 p.m.</p>

  <p>The 21st Brigade was able to form up in the open on the left without a
  shot being fired at it, thus showing that at the time the enemy's resistance
  had been paralysed. The Brigade pushed forward in the direction of Moulin de
  Piètre.</p>

  <p>At first it made good progress, but was subsequently held up by the
  machine- gun fire from the houses and from a defended work in the line of the
  German entrenchments opposite the right of the 22nd Brigade.</p>

  <p>Further to the south the 24th Brigade, which had been directed on Piètre,
  was similarly held up by machine-guns in the houses and trenches at the road
  junction six hundred yards north-west of Piètre.</p>

  <p>The 25th Brigade, on the right of the 24th, was also held up by
  machine-guns from a bridge held by the Germans, over the River des Layes,
  which is situated to the north-west of the Bois Du Biez.</p>

  <p>Whilst two Brigades of the Meerut Division were establishing themselves on
  the new line, the Dehra Dun Brigade, supported by the Jullundur Brigade of
  the Lahore Division, moved to the attack of the Bois Du Biez, but were held
  up on the line of the River Des Layes by the German post at the bridge which
  enfiladed them and brought them to a standstill.</p>

  <p>The defended bridge over the River Des Layes and its neighbourhood
  immediately assumed considerable importance. Whilst artillery fire was
  brought to bear, as far as circumstances would permit, on this point, Sir
  Douglas Haig directed the 1st Corps to dispatch one or more battalions of the
  1st Brigade in support of the troops attacking the bridge. Three battalions
  were thus sent to Richebourg St. Vaast. Darkness coming on, and the enemy
  having brought up reinforcements, no further progress could be made, and the
  Indian Corps and 4th Corps proceeded to consolidate the position they had
  gained.</p>

  <p>Whilst the operations which I have thus briefly recorded were going on,
  the 1st Corps, in accordance with orders, delivered an attack in the morning
  from Givenchy, simultaneously with that against Neuve Chapelle; but, as the
  enemy's wire was insufficiently cut, very little progress could be made, and
  the troops at this point did little more than hold fast the Germans in front
  of them.</p>

  <p>On the following day, 11 March, the attack was renewed by the 4th and
  Indian Corps, but it was soon seen that a further advance would be impossible
  until the artillery had dealt effectively with the various houses and
  defended localities which held up the troops along the entire front. Efforts
  were made to direct the artillery fire accordingly; but owing to the weather
  conditions, which did not permit of aerial observation, and the fact that
  nearly all the telephonic communications between the artillery observers and
  their batteries had been cut, it was impossible to do so with sufficient
  accuracy. Even when our troops which were pressing forward occupied a house
  here and there, it was not possible to stop our artillery fire, and the
  infantry had to be withdrawn.</p>

  <p>The two principal points which barred the advance were the same as on the
  preceding day&mdash;namely, the enemy's position about Moulin de Piètre and
  at the bridge over the River des Layes.</p>

  <p>On March 12 the same unfavourable conditions as regards weather prevailed,
  and hampered artillery action.</p>

  <p>Although the 4th and Indian Corps most gallantly attempted to capture the
  strongly fortified positions in their front, they were unable to maintain
  themselves, although they succeeded in holding them for some hours.</p>

  <p>Operations on this day were chiefly remarkable for the violent counter-
  attacks, supported by artillery, which were delivered by the Germans, and the
  ease with which they were repulsed.</p>

  <p>As most of the objects for which the operations had been undertaken had
  been attained, and as there were reasons why I considered it inadvisable to
  continue the attack at that time, I directed Sir Douglas Haig on the night of
  the 12th to hold and consolidate the ground which had been gained by the 4th
  and Indian Corps, and to suspend further offensive operations for the
  present.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 12th I informed the General Officer Commanding 1st
  Army that he could call on the 2nd Cavalry Division, under General Gough, for
  immediate support in the event of the successes of the First Army opening up
  opportunities for its favourable employment.</p>

  <p>This Division and a Brigade of the North Midland Division, which was
  temporarily attached to it, was moved forward for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The 5th Cavalry Brigade, under Sir Philip Chetwode, reached the Rue
  Bacquerot at 4 p.m. with a view to rendering immediate support; but he was
  informed by the General Officer Commanding 4th Corps that the situation was
  not so favourable as he had hoped it would be, and that no further action by
  the cavalry was advisable.</p>

  <p>General Gough's command, therefore, retired to Estaires.</p>

  <p>The artillery of all kinds was handled with the utmost energy and skill,
  and rendered invaluable support in the prosecution of the attack.</p>

  <p>The losses during these three days' fighting were, I regret to say, very
  severe, numbering&mdash;</p>

  <p>190 officers and 2,337 other ranks, killed.</p>

  <p>359 officers and 8,174 other ranks, wounded.</p>

  <p>23 officers and 1,728 other ranks, missing.</p>

  <p>But the results attained were, in my opinion, wide and far-reaching.</p>

  <p>The enemy left several thousand dead on the battlefield, which were seen
  and counted; and we have positive information that upwards of 12,000 wounded
  were removed to the north-east and east by train.</p>

  <p>Thirty officers and 1,657 other ranks of the enemy were captured.</p>

  <p>I can best express my estimate of this battle by quoting an extract from a
  Special Order of the Day which I addressed to Sir Douglas Haig and the first
  Army at its conclusion:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am anxious to express to you personally my warmest appreciation of the
  skilful manner in which you have carried out your orders, and my fervent and
  most heartfelt appreciation of the magnificent gallantry and devoted,
  tenacious courage displayed by all ranks whom you have ably led to success
  and victory."</p>

  <p>V. Some operations in the nature of holding attacks, carried out by troops
  of the Second Army, were instrumental in keeping the enemy in front of them
  occupied, and preventing reinforcements being sent from those portions of the
  front to the main point of attack.</p>

  <p>At 12.30 a.m. on March 12 the 17th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Division,
  3rd Corps, engaged in an attack on the enemy which resulted in the capture of
  the village of L'Épinette and adjacent farms.</p>

  <p>Supported by a brisk fire from the 18th Infantry Brigade, the 17th
  Infantry Brigade, detailed for the attack, assaulted in two columns
  converging, and obtained the first houses of the village without much loss.
  The remainder of the village was very heavily wired, and the enemy got away
  by means of communication trenches while our men were cutting through the
  wire.</p>

  <p>The enemy suffered considerable loss; our casualties being five officers
  and 30 other ranks killed and wounded.</p>

  <p>The result of this operation was that an advance of 300 yards was made on
  a front of half a mile.</p>

  <p>All attempts to retake this position have been repulsed with heavy loss to
  the enemy.</p>

  <p>The General Officer Commanding the Second Corps arranged for an attack on
  a part of the enemy's position to the south-west of the village of Wytschaete
  which he had timed to commence at 10 a.m. on March 12. Owing to dense fog,
  the assault could not be made until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>It was then commenced by the Wiltshire and Worcestershire Regiments, but
  was so hampered by the mist and the approach of darkness that nothing more
  was effected than holding the enemy to his ground.</p>

  <p>The action of St. Éloi referred to in the first paragraph of this despatch
  commenced at 5 p.m. on March 14 by a very heavy cannonade which was directed
  against our trenches in front of St. Éloi, the village itself, and the
  approaches to it. There is a large mound lying to the south-east of the
  village. When the artillery attack was at its height a mine was exploded
  under this mound, and a strong hostile infantry attack was immediately
  launched against the trenches and the mound.</p>

  <p>Our artillery opened fire at once, as well as our infantry, and inflicted
  considerable losses on the enemy during their advance; but, chiefly owing to
  the explosion of the mine and the surprise of the overwhelming artillery
  attack, the enemy's infantry had penetrated the first line of trenches at
  some points. As a consequence the garrisons of other works which had
  successfully resisted the assault were enfiladed and forced to retire just
  before it turned dark.</p>

  <p>A counter-attack was at once organised by the General Officer Commanding
  82nd Brigade, under the orders of the General Officer Commanding 27th
  Division, who brought up a reserve brigade to support it.</p>

  <p>The attack was launched at 2 a.m., and the 82nd Brigade succeeded in
  recapturing the portion of the village of St. Éloi which was in the hands of
  the enemy and a portion of the trenches east of it. At 3 a.m. the 80th
  Brigade in support took more trenches to the east and west of the
  village.</p>

  <p>The counter-attack, which was well carried out under difficult conditions,
  resulted in the recapture of all lost ground of material importance.</p>

  <p>It is satisfactory to be able to record that, though the troops occupying
  the first line of trenches were at first overwhelmed, they afterwards behaved
  very gallantly in the counter-attack for the recovery of the lost ground; and
  the following units earned and received the special commendation of the Army
  Commander:&mdash;The 2nd Royal Irish Fusiliers, the 2nd Duke of Cornwall's
  Light Infantry, the 1st Leinster Regiment, the 4th Rifle Brigade, and the
  Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.</p>

  <p>A vigorous attack made by the enemy on the 17th to recapture these
  trenches was repulsed with great loss.</p>

  <p>Throughout the period under review night enterprises by smaller or larger
  patrols, which were led with consummate skill and daring, have been very
  active along the whole line.</p>

  <p>A moral superiority has thus been established, and valuable information
  has been collected.</p>

  <p>I cannot speak too highly of the invincible courage and the remarkable
  resource displayed by these patrols.</p>

  <p>The troops of the 3rd Corps have particularly impressed me by their
  conduct of these operations.</p>

  <p>VI. The work of the Royal Flying Corps throughout this period, and
  especially during the operations of 10, 11, and 12 March, was of the greatest
  value. Though the weather on 10 March and on the subsequent days was very
  unfavourable for aerial work, on account of low-lying clouds and mist, a
  remarkable number of hours' flying of a most valuable character were
  effected, and continuous and close reconnaissance was maintained over the
  enemy's front.</p>

  <p>In addition to the work of reconnaissance and observation of artillery
  fire, the Royal Flying Corps was charged with the special duty of hampering
  the enemy's movements by destroying various points on his communications. The
  railways at Menin, Courtrai, Don, and Douai were attacked, and it is known
  that very extensive damage was effected at certain of these places. Part of a
  troop train was hit by a bomb, a wireless installation near Lille is believed
  to have been effectively destroyed, and a house in which the enemy had
  installed one of his Headquarters was set on fire. These afford other
  instances of successful operations of this character. Most of the objectives
  mentioned were attacked at a height of only 100 to 150 feet. In one case the
  pilot descended to about 50 feet above the point he was attacking.</p>

  <p>Certain new and important forms of activity, which it is undesirable to
  specify, have been initiated and pushed forward with much vigour and
  success.</p>

  <p>There have been only eight days during the period under review on which
  reconnaissances have not been made. A total of approximately 130,000 miles
  have been flown&mdash;almost entirely over the enemy's lines.</p>

  <p>No great activity has been shown over our troops on the part of the
  enemy's aircraft, but they have been attacked whenever and wherever met with,
  and usually forced down or made to seek refuge in their own lines.</p>

  <p>VII. In my last despatch I referred to the remarkable promptitude and
  rapidity with which reinforcements arrived in this country from England. In
  connection with this it is of interest to call attention to the fact that, in
  spite of the heavy casualties incurred in the fighting between 10 and 15
  March, all deficiencies, both in officers and rank and file, were made good
  within a few days of the conclusion of the battle.</p>

  <p>The drafts for the Indian Contingents have much improved of late, and are
  now quite satisfactory.</p>

  <p>Since the date of my last report the general health of the Army has been
  excellent; enteric has decreased, and there has been no recurrence on any
  appreciable scale of the "foot" trouble which appeared so threatening in
  December and January.</p>

  <p>These results are due to the skill and energy which have characterised in
  a marked degree the work of the Royal Army Medical Corps throughout the
  campaign, under the able supervision of Surgeon-General T. J. O'Donnell,
  D.S.O., Deputy Director-General, Medical Services. But much credit is also
  due to Divisional, Brigade, Regimental, and Company Commanders for the close
  supervision which has been kept over the health of their men by seeing that
  the precautions laid down for the troops before entering and after leaving
  the trenches are duly observed, and by the establishment and efficient
  maintenance of bathing-places and wash-houses, and by the ingenious means
  universally employed throughout the Forces to maintain the cleanliness of the
  men, having regard both to their bodies and their clothing.</p>

  <p>I have inspected most of these houses and establishments, and consider
  them models of careful organisation and supervision.</p>

  <p>I would particularly comment upon the energy displayed by the Royal Army
  Medical Corps in the scientific efforts they have made to discover and check
  disease in its earliest stages by a system of experimental research, which I
  think has never before been so fully developed in the field..</p>

  <p>In this work they have been ably assisted by those distinguished members
  of the medical profession who are now employed as Military Medical Officers,
  and whose invaluable services I gratefully acknowledge.</p>

  <p>The actual strength of the Force in the field has been increased and the
  health of the troops improved by a system of "convalescent" hospitals.</p>

  <p>In these establishments slight wounds and minor ailments are treated, and
  men requiring attention and rest are received.</p>

  <p>By these means efficient soldiers, whose services would otherwise be lost
  for a long time, are kept in the country, whilst a large number of men are
  given immediate relief and rest when they require it without removing them
  from the area of operations.</p>

  <p>This adds materially to the fighting efficiency of the Forces.</p>

  <p>The principal convalescent hospital is at St. Omer. It was started and
  organised by Colonel A. F. L. Bate, Army Medical Service, whose zeal, energy,
  and organising power have rendered it a model hospital of its kind, and this
  example has materially assisted in the efficient organisation of similar
  smaller establishments at every Divisional Headquarters.</p>

  <p>VIII. I have already commented upon the number and severity of the
  casualties in action which have occurred in the period under report. Here
  once again I have to draw attention to the excellent work done by
  Surgeon-General O'Donnell and his officers. No organisation could excel the
  efficiency of the arrangements&mdash;whether in regard to time, space, care
  and comfort, or transport&mdash;which are made for the speedy evacuation of
  the wounded.</p>

  <p>I wish particularly to express my deep sense of the loss incurred by the
  Army in general and by the Forces in France in particular, in the death of
  Brigadier- General J. E. Gough, V.C., C.M.G., A.D.C., late Brigadier-General,
  General Staff, First Army, which occurred on 22 February, as a result of a
  severe wound received on 20 February when inspecting the trenches of the 4th
  Corps.</p>

  <p>I always regarded General Gough as one of our most promising military
  leaders of the future. His services as a Staff Officer throughout the
  campaign have been invaluable, and I had already brought his name before Your
  Lordship for immediate promotion.</p>

  <p>I can well understand how deeply these casualties are felt by the nation
  at large, but each daily report shows clearly that they are being endured on
  at least an equal scale by all the combatants engaged throughout Europe,
  friends and foes alike.</p>

  <p>In war as it is to-day between civilised nations, armed to the teeth with
  the present deadly rifle and machine-gun, heavy casualties are absolutely
  unavoidable. For the slightest undue exposure the heaviest toll is
  exacted.</p>

  <p>The power of defence conferred by modern weapons is the main cause of the
  long duration of the battles of the present day, and it is this fact which
  mainly accounts for such loss and waste of life.</p>

  <p>Both one and the other can, however, be shortened and lessened if attacks
  can be supported by the most efficient and powerful force of artillery
  available; but an almost unlimited supply of ammunition is necessary and a
  most liberal discretionary power as to its use must be given to the Artillery
  Commanders.</p>

  <p>I am confident that this is the only means by which great results can be
  obtained with a minimum of loss.</p>

  <p>IX. On February 15 the Canadian Division began to arrive in this country.
  I inspected the Division, which was under the command of Lieutenant-General
  E. A. H. Alderson, C.B., on February 20.</p>

  <p>They presented a splendid and most soldier-like appearance on parade. The
  men were of good physique, hard and fit. I judged by what I saw of them that
  they were well trained and quite able to take their places in the line of
  battle.</p>

  <p>Since then the Division has thoroughly justified the good opinion I formed
  of it.</p>

  <p>The troops of the Canadian Division were first attached for a few days by
  brigades for training in the 3rd Corps trenches under Lieutenant-General Sir
  William Pulteney, who gave me such an excellent report of their efficiency
  that I was able to employ them in the trenches early in March.</p>

  <p>During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle they held a part of the line allotted
  to the First Army, and, although they were not actually engaged in the main
  attack, they rendered valuable help by keeping the enemy actively employed in
  front of their trenches.</p>

  <p>All the soldiers of Canada serving in the Army under my command have so
  far splendidly upheld the traditions of the Empire, and will, I feel sure,
  prove to be a great source of additional strength to the forces in this
  country.</p>

  <p>In former despatches I have been able to comment very favourably upon the
  conduct and bearing of the Territorial Forces throughout the operations in
  which they have been engaged.</p>

  <p>As time goes on, and I see more and more of their work, whether in the
  trenches or engaged in more active operations, I am still further impressed
  with their value.</p>

  <p>Several battalions were engaged in the most critical moments of the heavy
  fighting which occurred in the middle of March, and they acquitted themselves
  with the utmost credit.</p>

  <p>Up till lately the troops of the Territorial Forces in this country were
  only employed by battalions, but for some weeks past I have seen formed
  divisions working together, and I have every hope that their employment in
  the larger units will prove as successful as in the smaller.</p>

  <p>These opinions are fully borne out by the result of the close inspection
  which I have recently made of the North Midland Division, under Major-General
  Hon. Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, and the 2nd London Division, under Major-General
  Barter.</p>

  <p>X. General Baron von Kaulbars, of the Russian General Staff, arrived at my
  Headquarters on 18 March. He was anxious to study our aviation system, and I
  gave him every opportunity of doing so.</p>

  <p>The Bishop of London arrived here with his Chaplain on Saturday, March 27,
  and left on Monday, April 5.</p>

  <p>During the course of his visit to the Army His Lordship was at the front
  every day, and I think I am right in saying that there was scarcely a unit in
  the command which was not at one time or another present at his services or
  addresses.</p>

  <p>Personal fatigue and even danger were completely ignored by His Lordship.
  The Bishop held several services virtually under shell fire, and it was with
  difficulty that he could be prevented from carrying on his ministrations
  under rifle fire in the trenches.</p>

  <p>I am anxious to place on record my deep sense of the good effect produced
  throughout the Army by this self-sacrificing devotion on the part of the
  Bishop of London, to whom I feel personally very deeply indebted.</p>

  <p>I have once more to remark upon the devotion to duty, courage, and
  contempt of danger which has characterised the work of the Chaplains of the
  Army throughout this campaign.</p>

  <p>XI. The increased strength of the Force and the gradual exhaustion of the
  local resources have necessitated a corresponding increase in our demands on
  the Line of Communications, since we are now compelled to import many
  articles which in the early stages could be obtained by local purchase. The
  Directorates concerned have, however, been carefully watching the situation,
  and all the Administrative Services on the Line of Communications have
  continued to work with smoothness and regularity, in spite of the increased
  pressure thrown upon them. In this connection I wish to bring to notice the
  good service which has been rendered by the Staff of the Base Ports.</p>

  <p>The work of the Railway Transport Department has been excellently carried
  out, and I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the
  valuable service rendered by the French railway authorities generally, and
  especially by Colonel Ragueneau, late Directeur des Chemins de Fer,
  Lieutenant-Colonel Le Hénaff, Directeur des Chemins de Fer,
  Lieutenant-Colonel Dumont, Commissaire Militaire, Chemin de Fer du Nord, and
  Lieutenant-Colonel Frid, Commissaire Régulateur, Armée Anglaise.</p>

  <p>The Army Postal Service has continued to work well, and at the present
  time a letter posted in London is delivered at General Headquarters or at the
  Headquarters of the Armies and Army Corps on the following evening, and
  reaches an addressee in the trenches on the second day after posting. The
  delivery of parcels has also been accelerated, and is carried out with
  regularity and dispatch.</p>

  <p>XII. His Majesty the King of the Belgians visited the British lines on 8
  February and inspected some of the units in reserve behind the trenches.</p>

  <p>During the last two months I have been much indebted to His Majesty and
  his gallant Army for valuable assistance and co-operation in various
  ways.</p>

  <p>XIII. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is the bearer of this
  despatch.</p>

  <p>His Royal Highness continues to make most satisfactory progress. During
  the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he acted on my General Staff as a Liaison
  Officer. Reports from the General Officers Commanding Corps and Divisions to
  which he has been attached agree in commending the thoroughness in which he
  performs any work entrusted to him.</p>

  <p>I have myself been very favourably impressed by the quickness with which
  His Royal Highness has acquired knowledge of the various branches of the
  service, and the deep interest he has always displayed in the comfort and
  welfare of the men.</p>

  <p>His visits to the troops, both in the field and in hospitals, have been
  greatly appreciated by all ranks.</p>

  <p>His Royal Highness did duty for a time in the trenches with the Battalion
  to which he belongs.</p>

  <p>XIV. In connection with the Battle of Neuve Chapelle I desire to bring to
  Your Lordship's special notice the valuable services of General Sir Douglas
  Haig, K.C.B., K.C.I.E., K.C.V.O., A.D.C., Commanding the First Army.</p>

  <p>I am also much indebted to the able and devoted assistance I have received
  from Lieutenant-General Sir William Robertson, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., D.S.O.,
  Chief of the General Staff, in the direction of all the operations recorded
  in this despatch.</p>

  <p>I have many other names to bring to notice for valuable, gallant, and
  distinguished service during the period under review, and these will form the
  subject of a separate report at an early date.</p>

  <p class="first">I have the honour to be,</p>

  <p class="first">Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,</p>

  <p class="first">J. D. P. French, Field-Marshal,<br>
  Commanding-in-Chief, The British Army in the Field.</p>
  <hr>

  <p class="first">FROM the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, The British Army
  in France. To the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W.</p>

  <p class="first">General Headquarters,</p>

  <p class="first">June 15, 1915.</p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE the honour to report that since the date of my last
  despatch (April 5, 1915) the Army in France under my command has been heavily
  engaged opposite both flanks of the line held by the British Forces.</p>

  <p>I. In the North the town and district of Ypres have once more in this
  campaign been successfully defended against vigorous and sustained attacks
  made by large forces of the enemy, and supported by a mass of heavy and field
  artillery, which, not only in number, but also in weight and calibre, is
  superior to any concentration of guns which has previously assailed that part
  of the line.</p>

  <p>In the South a vigorous offensive has again been taken by troops of the
  First Army, in the course of which a large area of entrenched and fortified
  ground has been captured from the enemy, whilst valuable support has been
  afforded to the attack which our Allies have carried on with such marked
  success against the enemy's positions to the east of Arras and Lens.</p>

  <p>II. I much regret that during the period under report the fighting has
  been characterised on the enemy's side by a cynical and barbarous disregard
  of the well-known usages of civilised war and a flagrant defiance of the
  Hague Convention.</p>

  <p>All the scientific resources of Germany have apparently been brought into
  play to produce a gas of so virulent and poisonous a nature that any human
  being brought into contact with it is first paralysed and then meets with a
  lingering and agonising death.</p>

  <p>The enemy has invariably preceded, prepared, and supported his attacks by
  a discharge in stupendous volume of these poisonous gas fumes whenever the
  wind was favourable.</p>

  <p>Such weather conditions have only prevailed to any extent in the
  neighbourhood of Ypres, and there can be no doubt that the effect of these
  poisonous fumes materially influenced the operations in that theatre, until
  experience suggested effective counter measures, which have since been so
  perfected as to render them innocuous.</p>

  <p>The brain power and thought which has evidently been at work before this
  unworthy method of making war reached the pitch of efficiency which has been
  demonstrated in its practice shows that the Germans must have harboured these
  designs for a long time.</p>

  <p>As a soldier I cannot help expressing the deepest regret and some surprise
  that an Army which hitherto has claimed to be the chief exponent of the
  chivalry of war should have stooped to employ such devices against brave and
  gallant foes.</p>

  <p>III. On the night of Saturday, April 17, a commanding hill which afforded
  the enemy excellent artillery observation towards the West and North-West was
  successfully mined and captured.</p>

  <p>This hill, known as Hill 60, lies opposite the northern extremity of the
  line held by the 2nd Corps.</p>

  <p>The operation was planned and the mining commenced by Major-General Bulfin
  before the ground was handed over to the troops under Lieutenant-General Sir
  Charles Fergusson, under whose supervision the operation was carried out.</p>

  <p>The mines were successfully fired at 7 p.m. on the 17th, and immediately
  afterwards the hill was attacked and gained, without difficulty, by the 1st
  Battalion, Royal West Kent Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion, King's Own
  Scottish Borderers. The attack was well supported by the Divisional
  Artillery, assisted by French and Belgian batteries.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The heavy losses sustained by the British occurred
  after the occupation of the hill and in its defence.&mdash;Editor.</p>

  <p>During the night several of the enemy's counterattacks were repulsed with
  heavy loss, and fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place; but on the early
  morning of the 18th the enemy succeeded in forcing back the troops holding
  the right of the hill to the reverse slope, where, however, they hung on
  throughout the day.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 18th these two battalions were relieved by the 2nd
  Battalion, West Riding Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire
  Light Infantry, who again stormed the hill under cover of heavy artillery
  fire, and the enemy was driven off at the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>In this operation 53 prisoners were captured, including four officers.</p>

  <p>On the 20th and following days many unsuccessful attacks by the enemy were
  made on Hill 60, which was continuously shelled by heavy artillery.</p>

  <p>On May 1 another attempt to recapture Hill 60 was supported by great
  volumes of asphyxiating gas, which caused nearly all the men along a front of
  about 400 yards to be immediately struck down by its fumes.</p>

  <p>The splendid courage with which the leaders rallied their men and subdued
  the natural tendency to panic (which is inevitable on such occasions),
  combined with the prompt intervention of supports, once more drove the enemy
  back.</p>

  <p>A second and more severe "gas" attack, under much more favourable weather
  conditions, enabled the enemy to recapture this position on May 5.</p>

  <p>The enemy owes his success in this last attack entirely to the use of
  asphyxiating gas. It was only a few days later that the means, which have
  since proved so effective, of counteracting this method of making war were
  put into practice. Had it been otherwise, the enemy's attack on May 5 would
  most certainly have shared the fate of all the many previous attempts he had
  made.</p>

  <p>IV. It was at the commencement of the Second</p>

  <p>Battle of Ypres on the evening of April 22, referred to in paragraph I. of
  this report, that the enemy first made use of asphyxiating gas.</p>

  <p>Some days previously I had complied with General Joffre's request to take
  over the trenches occupied by the French, and on the evening of the 22nd the
  troops holding the lines east of Ypres were posted as follows:&mdash;From
  Steenstraate to the east of Langemarck, as far as the Poelcappelle Road, a
  French Division.</p>

  <p>Thence, in a south-easterly direction towards the Passchendaele-Becelaere
  Road, the Canadian Division.</p>

  <p>Thence a Division took up the line in a southerly direction east of
  Zonnebeke to a point west of Becelaere, w hence another Division continued
  the line southeast to the northern limit of the Corps on its right.</p>

  <p>Of the 5th Corps there were four battalions in Divisional Reserve about
  Ypres; the Canadian Division had one battalion in Divisional Reserve, and the
  1st Canadian Brigade in Army Reserve. An Infantry Brigade, which had just
  been withdrawn after suffering heavy losses on Hill 60, was resting about
  Vlamertinghe.</p>

  <p>Following a heavy bombardment, the enemy attacked the French Division at
  about 5 p.m., using asphyxiating gases for the first time. Aircraft reported
  that at about 5 p.m. thick yellow smoke had been seen issuing from the German
  trenches between Langemarck and Bixschoote. The French reported that two
  simultaneous attacks had been made east of the Ypres-Staden Railway, in which
  these asphyxiating gases had been employed.</p>

  <p>What follows almost defies description. The effect of these poisonous
  gases was so virulent as to render the whole of the line held by the French
  Division mentioned above practically incapable of any action at all. It was
  at first impossible for anyone to realise what had actually happened. The
  smoke and fumes hid everything from sight, and hundreds of men were thrown
  into a comatose or dying condition, and within an hour the whole position had
  to be abandoned, together with about 50 guns.</p>

  <p>I wish particularly to repudiate any idea of attaching the least blame to
  the French Division for this unfortunate incident.</p>

  <p>After all the examples our gallant Allies have shown of dogged and
  tenacious courage in the many trying situations in which they have been
  placed throughout the course of this campaign it is quite superfluous for me
  to dwell on this aspect of the incident, and I would only express my firm
  conviction that, if any troops in the world had been able to hold their
  trenches in the face of such a treacherous and altogether unexpected
  onslaught, the French Division would have stood firm.</p>

  <p>The left flank of the Canadian Division was thus left dangerously exposed
  to serious attack in flank, and there appeared to be a prospect of their
  being overwhelmed and of a successful attempt by the Germans to cut off the
  British troops occupying the salient to the East.</p>

  <p>In spite of the danger to which they were exposed the Canadians held their
  ground with a magnificent display of tenacity and courage; and it is not too
  much to say that the bearing and conduct of these splendid troops averted a
  disaster which might have been attended with the most serious
  consequences.</p>

  <p>They were supported with great promptitude by the reserves of the
  Divisions holding the salient and by a Brigade which had been resting in
  billets.</p>

  <p>Throughout the night the enemy's attacks were repulsed, effective counter-
  attacks were delivered, and at length touch was gained with the French right,
  and a new line was formed.</p>

  <p>The 2nd London Heavy Battery, which had been attached to the Canadian
  Division, was posted behind the right of the French Division, and, being
  involved in their retreat, fell into the enemy's hands. It was recaptured by
  the Canadians in their counter-attack, but the guns could not be withdrawn
  before the Canadians were again driven back.</p>

  <p>During the night I directed the Cavalry Corps and the Northumbrian
  Division, which was then in general reserve, to move to the west of Ypres,
  and placed these troops at the disposal of the General Officer Commanding the
  Second Army. I also directed other reserve troops from the 3rd Corps and the
  First Army to be held in readiness to meet eventualities.</p>

  <p>In the confusion of the gas and smoke the Germans succeeded in capturing
  the bridge at Steenstraate and some works south of Lizerne, all of which were
  in occupation by the French.</p>

  <p>The enemy having thus established himself to the west of the Ypres Canal,
  I was somewhat apprehensive of his succeeding in driving a wedge between the
  French and Belgian troops at this point. I directed, therefore, that some of
  the reinforcements sent north should be used to support and assist General
  Putz, should he find difficulty in preventing any further advance of the
  Germans west of the canal.</p>

  <p>At about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd connection was finally
  ensured between the left of the Canadian Division and the French right, about
  eight hundred yards east of the canal; but as this entailed the maintenance
  by the British troops of a much longer line than that which they had held
  before the attack commenced on the previous night, there were no reserves
  available for counter-attack until reinforcements, which were ordered up from
  the Second Army, were able to deploy to the east of Ypres.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of the 23rd I went to see General Foch, and from him
  I received a detailed account of what had happened, as reported by General
  Putz. General Foch informed me that it was his intention to make good the
  original line and regain the trenches which the French Division had lost. He
  expressed the desire that I should maintain my present line, assuring me that
  the original position would be re-established in a few days. General Foch
  further informed me that he had ordered up large French reinforcements, which
  were now on their way, and that troops from the North had already arrived to
  reinforce General Putz.</p>

  <p>I fully concurred in the wisdom of the General's wish to re-establish our
  old line, and agreed to co-operate in the way he desired, stipulating,
  however, that if the position was not re-established within a limited time I
  could not allow the British troops to remain in so exposed a situation as
  that which the action of the previous twenty-four hours had compelled them to
  occupy.</p>

  <p>During the whole of the 23rd the enemy's artillery was very active, and
  his attacks all along the front were supported by some heavy guns which had
  been brought down from the coast in the neighbourhood of Ostend. The loss of
  the guns on the night of the 22nd prevented this fire from being kept down,
  and much aggravated the situation. Our positions, however, were well
  maintained by the vigorous counter-attacks made by the 5th Corps.</p>

  <p>During the day I directed two Brigades of the 3rd Corps and the Lahore
  Division of the Indian Corps to be moved up to the Ypres area and placed at
  the disposal of the Second Army. In the course of these two or three days
  many circumstances combined to render the situation east of the Ypres Canal
  very critical and most difficult to deal with. The confusion caused by the
  sudden retirement of the French Division, and the necessity for closing up
  the gap and checking the enemy's advance at all costs, led to a mixing up of
  units and a sudden shifting of the areas of command which was quite
  unavoidable. Fresh units, as they came up from the South, had to be pushed
  into the firing line in an area swept by artillery fire, which, owing to the
  capture of the French guns, we were unable to keep down.</p>

  <p>All this led to very heavy casualties, and I wish to place on record the
  deep admiration which I feel for the resource and presence of mind evinced by
  the leaders actually on the spot. The parts taken by Major-General Snow and
  Brigadier-General Hull were reported to me as being particularly marked in
  this respect.</p>

  <p>An instance of this occurred on the afternoon of the 24th, when the enemy
  succeeded in breaking through the line at St. Julien. Brigadier-General Hull,
  acting under the orders of Lieutenant-General Alderson, organised a powerful
  counter-attack with his own Brigade and some of the nearest available units.
  He was called upon to control, with only his Brigade Staff, parts of
  battalions from six separate divisions which were quite new to the ground.
  Although the attack did not succeed in retaking St. Julien, it effectually
  checked the enemy's further advance.</p>

  <p>It was only on the morning of the 25th that the enemy were able to force
  back the left of the Canadian Division from the point where it had originally
  joined the French line. During the night and the early morning of the 25th
  the enemy directed a heavy attack against the Division at Broodseinde
  cross-roads, which was supported by a powerful shell fire, but he failed to
  make any progress.</p>

  <p>During the whole of this time the town of Ypres and all the roads to the
  east and west were uninterruptedly subjected to a violent artillery fire, but
  in spite of this the supply of both food and ammunition was maintained
  throughout with order and efficiency.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon of the 25th many German prisoners were taken,
  including some officers. The hand-to-hand fighting was very severe, and the
  enemy suffered heavy loss. During the 26th the Lahore Division and a Cavalry
  Division were pushed up into the fighting line, the former on the right of
  the French, the latter in support of the 5th Corps. In the afternoon the
  Lahore Division, in conjunction with the French right, succeeded in pushing
  the enemy back some little distance toward the north, but their further
  advance was stopped owing to the continual employment by the enemy of
  asphyxiating gas.</p>

  <p>On the right of the Lahore Division the Northumberland Infantry Brigade
  advanced against St. Julien and actually succeeded in entering, and for a
  time occupying, the southern portion of that village. They were, however,
  eventually driven back, largely owing to gas, and finally occupied a line a
  short way to the south. This attack was most successfully and gallantly led
  by Brigadier- General Riddell, who, I regret to say, was killed during the
  progress of the operation. Although no attack was made on the south-eastern
  side of the salient, the troops operating to the east of Ypres were subjected
  to heavy artillery fire from this direction which took some of the
  battalions, which were advancing north to the attack, in reverse. Some
  gallant attempts made by the Lahore Division on the 27th, in conjunction with
  the French, pushed the enemy further north; but they were partially
  frustrated by the constant fumes of gas to which they were exposed. In spite
  of this, however, a certain amount of ground was gained.</p>

  <p>The French had succeeded in retaking Lizerne, and had made some progress
  at Steenstraate and Het Sas; but up to the evening of the 28th no further
  progress had been made toward the recapture of the original line.</p>

  <p>I sent instructions, therefore, to Sir Herbert Plumer,* who was now in
  charge of the operation, to take preliminary measures for the retirement to
  the new line which had been fixed upon. On the morning of the 29th I had
  another interview with General Foch, who informed me that strong
  reinforcements were hourly arriving to support General Putz, and urged me to
  postpone issuing orders for any retirement until the result of his attack,
  which was timed to commence at daybreak on the 30th, should be known. To this
  I agreed, and instructed Sir Herbert Plumer accordingly.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Sir Herbert Plumer, who took over the command of Sir
  Horace Smith-Dorrien, achieved fame by his relief of Mafeking and the
  operations in the region before the relief.</p>

  <p>No substantial advance having been made by the French, I issued orders to
  Sir Herbert Plumer at one o'clock on May 1 to commence his withdrawal to the
  new line. The retirement was commenced the following night, and the new line
  was occupied on the morning of May 4.</p>

  <p>I am of opinion that this retirement, carried out deliberately with
  scarcely any loss, and in the face of an enemy in position, reflects the
  greatest possible credit on Sir Herbert Plumer and those who so efficiently
  carried out his orders.</p>

  <p>The successful conduct of this operation was the more remarkable from the
  fact that on the evening of 2 May, when it was only half completed, the enemy
  made a heavy attack, with the usual gas accompaniment, on St. Julien and the
  line to the west of it.</p>

  <p>An attack on a line to the east of Fortuin was made at the same time under
  similar conditions.</p>

  <p>In both cases our troops were at first driven from their trenches by gas
  fumes, but on the arrival of the supporting battalions and two brigades of a
  Cavalry Division, which were sent up in support from about Potijze, all the
  lost trenches were regained at night.</p>

  <p>On 3 May, while the retirement was still going on, another violent attack
  was directed on the northern face of the salient. This was also driven back
  with heavy loss to the enemy.</p>

  <p>Further attempts of the enemy during the night of the 3rd to advance from
  the woods west of St. Julien were frustrated entirely by the fire of our
  artillery.</p>

  <p>During the whole of the 4th the enemy heavily shelled the trenches we had
  evacuated, quite unaware that they were no longer occupied. So soon as the
  retirement was discovered the Germans commenced to entrench opposite our new
  line and to advance their guns to new positions. Our artillery, assisted by
  aeroplanes, caused him considerable loss in carrying out these
  operations.</p>

  <p>Up to the morning of the 8th the enemy made attacks at short intervals,
  covered by gas, on all parts of the line to the east of Ypres, but was
  everywhere driven back with heavy loss.</p>

  <p>Throughout the whole period since the first break of the line on the night
  of 22 April all the troops in this area had been constantly subjected to
  violent artillery bombardment from a large mass of guns with an unlimited
  supply of ammunition. It proved impossible whilst under so vastly superior
  fire of artillery to dig efficient trenches, or to properly reorganise the
  line, after the confusion and demoralisation caused by the first great gas
  surprise and the subsequent almost daily gas attacks. Nor was it until after
  this date (8 May) that effective preventives had been devised and provided.
  In these circumstances a violent bombardment of nearly the whole of the 5th
  Corps front broke out at 7 a.m. on the morning of the 8th, which gradually
  concentrated on the front of the Division between north and south of
  Frezenberg. This fire completely obliterated the trenches and caused enormous
  losses.</p>

  <p>The artillery bombardment was shortly followed by a heavy infantry attack,
  before which our line had to give way.</p>

  <p>I relate what happened in Sir Herbert Plumer's own words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The right of one Brigade was broken about 10.15 a.m.; then its centre,
  and then part of the left of the Brigade in the next section to the south.
  The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, however, although suffering
  very heavily, stuck to their fire or support trenches throughout the day. At
  this time two battalions were moved to General Headquarters 2nd line astride
  the Menin road to support and cover the' left of their Division.</p>

  <p>"At 12.25 p.m. centre of a Brigade further to the left also broke; its
  right battalion, however, the 1st Suffolks, which had been refused to cover a
  gap, still held on and were apparently surrounded and overwhelmed. Meanwhile,
  three more battalions had been moved up to reinforce, two other battalions
  were moved up in support to General Headquarters line, and an Infantry
  Brigade came up to the grounds of Vlamertinghe Chateau in Corps Reserve.</p>

  <p>"At 11.30 a.m. a small party of Germans attempted to advance against the
  left of the British line, but were destroyed by the 2nd Essex Regiment.</p>

  <p>"A counter attack was launched at 3.30 p.m. by the 1st York and Lancaster
  Regiment, 3rd Middlesex Regiment, 2nd East Surrey Regiment, 2nd Royal Dublin
  Fusiliers, and the 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment. The counter attack
  reached Frezenberg, but was eventually driven back and held up on a line
  running about north and south through Verlorenhoek, despite repeated efforts
  to advance. The 12th London Regiment on the left succeeded at great cost in
  reaching the original trench line, and did considerable execution with their
  machine gun.</p>

  <p>"The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 1st East Lancashire
  Regiment attacked in a northeasterly direction towards Wieltje, and connected
  the old trench line with the ground gained by the counterattack, the line
  being consolidated during the night.</p>

  <p>"During the night orders were received that two Cavalry Divisions would be
  moved up and placed at the disposal of the 5th Corps, and a Territorial
  Division would be moved up to be used if required.</p>

  <p>"On the 9th the Germans again repeated their bombardment. Very heavy shell
  fire was concentrated for two hours on the trenches of the 2nd
  Gloucestershire Regiment and 2nd Cameron Highlanders, followed by an infantry
  attack which was successfully repulsed. The Germans again bombarded the
  salient, and a further attack in the afternoon succeeded in occupying 150
  yards of trench. The Gloucesters counter-attacked, but suffered heavily, and
  the attack failed. The salient being very exposed to shell fire from both
  flanks, as well as in front, it was deemed advisable not to attempt to retake
  the trench at night, and a retrenchment was therefore dug across it.</p>

  <p>"At 3 p.m. the enemy started to shell the whole front of the centre
  Division, and it was reported that the right Brigade of this Division was
  being heavily punished, but continued to maintain its line.</p>

  <p>"The trenches of the Brigades on the left centre were also heavily shelled
  during the day, and attacked by infantry. Both attacks were repulsed.</p>

  <p>"On the 10th instant the trenches on either side of the Menin-Ypres Road
  were shelled very severely all the morning. The 2nd Cameron Highlanders, 9th
  Royal Scots, and the 3rd and 4th King's Royal Rifles, however, repulsed an
  attack made, under cover of gas, with heavy loss. Finally, when the trenches
  had been practically destroyed and a large number of the garrison buried, the
  3rd King's Royal Rifles and 4th Rifle Brigade fell back to the trenches
  immediately west of Bellewaarde Wood. So heavy had been the shell fire that
  the proposal to join up the line with a switch through the wood had to be
  abandoned, the trees broken by the shells forming an impassable
  entanglement.</p>

  <p>"After a comparatively quiet night and morning (10th-11th) the hostile
  artillery fire was concentrated on the trenches of the 2nd Cameron
  Highlanders and 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at a slightly more
  northern point than on the previous day The Germans attacked in force and
  gained a footing in part of the trenches, but were promptly ejected by a
  supporting company of the 9th Royal Scots. After a second short artillery
  bombardment the Germans again attacked about 4.15 p.m., but were again
  repulsed by rifle and machine-gun fire. A third bombardment followed, and
  this time the Germans succeeded in gaining a trench&mdash;or rather what was
  left of it&mdash;a local counter- attack failing. However, during the night
  the enemy were again driven out. The trench by this time being practically
  non-existent, the garrison found it untenable under the very heavy shell fire
  the enemy brought to bear upon it, and the trench was evacuated. Twice more
  did the German snipers creep back into it, and twice more they were ejected.
  Finally, a retrenchment was made, cutting off the salient which had been
  contested throughout the day. It was won owing solely to the superior weight
  and number of the enemy's guns, but both our infantry and our artillery took
  a very heavy toll of the enemy, and the ground lost has proved of little use
  to the enemy.</p>

  <p>"On the remainder of the front the day passed comparatively quietly,
  though most parts of the line underwent intermittent shelling by guns of
  various calibres.</p>

  <p>"With the assistance of the Royal Flying Corps the 31st Heavy Battery
  scored a direct hit on a German gun, and the North Midland Heavy Battery got
  on to some German howitzers with great success.</p>

  <p>"With the exception of another very heavy burst of shell fire against the
  right Division early in the morning, the 12th passed uneventfully.</p>

  <p>"On the night of the 12th-13th the line was reorganised, the centre
  Division retiring into Army Reserve to rest, and their places being taken in
  the trenches by the two Cavalry Divisions; the Artillery and Engineers of the
  centre Division forming with them what was known as the 'Cavalry Force' under
  the command of General De Lisle.</p>

  <p>"On the 13th, the various reliefs having been completed without incident,
  the heaviest bombardment yet experienced broke out at 4.30 a.m., and
  continued with little intermission throughout the day. At about 7.45 a.m. the
  Cavalry Brigade astride the railway, having suffered very severely, and their
  trenches having been obliterated, fell back about 800 yards. The North
  Somerset Yeomanry on the right of the Brigade, although also suffering
  severely, hung on to their trenches throughout the day, and actually advanced
  and attacked the enemy with the bayonet. The Brigade on its right also
  maintained its position, as did also the Cavalry Division, except the left
  squadron, which, when reduced to sixteen men, fell back. The 2nd Essex
  Regiment, realising the situation, promptly charged and retook the trench,
  holding it till relieved by the Cavalry. Meanwhile a counter-attack by two
  Cavalry Brigades was launched at 2.30 p.m., and succeeded, in spite of very
  heavy shrapnel and rifle fire, in regaining the original line of trenches,
  turning out the Germans who had entered it, and in some cases pursuing them
  for some distance. But a very heavy shell fire was again opened on them, and
  they were again compelled to retire to an irregular line in rear, principally
  the craters of shell holes. The enemy in their counter-attack suffered very
  severe losses.</p>

  <p>"The fighting in other parts of the line was little less severe. The 1st
  East Lancashire Regiment were shelled out of their trenches, but their
  support company and the 2nd Essex Regiment, again acting on their own
  initiative, won them back. The enemy penetrated into the farm at the
  north-east corner of the line, but the 1st Rifle Brigade, after a severe
  struggle, expelled them. The 1st Hampshire Regiment also repelled an attack,
  and killed every German who got within fifty yards of their trenches. The 5th
  London Regiment, despite very heavy casualties, maintained their position
  unfalteringly. At the southern end of the line the left Brigade was once
  again heavily shelled, as indeed was the whole front. At the end of a very
  hard day's fighting our line remained in its former position, with the
  exception of the short distance lost by one Cavalry Division. Later, the line
  was pushed forward, and a new line was dug in a less exposed position,
  slightly in rear of that originally held. The night passed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Working parties of from 1,200 to 1,800 men have been found every night by
  a Territorial Division and other units for work on rear lines of defence, in
  addition to the work performed by the garrisons in reconstructing the front
  line trenches which were daily destroyed by shell fire.</p>

  <p>"The work performed by the Royal Flying Corps has been invaluable. Apart
  from the hostile aeroplanes actually destroyed, our airmen have prevented a
  great deal of aerial reconnaissance by the enemy, and have registered a large
  number of targets with our artillery.</p>

  <p>"There have been many cases of individual gallantry. As instances may be
  given the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"During one of the heavy attacks made against our infantry gas was seen
  rolling forward from the enemy's trenches. Private Lynn* of the 2nd
  Lancashire Fusiliers at once rushed to the machine gun without waiting to
  adjust his respirator. Single-handed he kept his gun in action the whole time
  the gas was rolling over, actually hoisting it on the parapet to get a better
  field of fire. Although nearly suffocated by the gas, he poured a stream of
  lead into the advancing enemy and checked their attack. He was carried to his
  dug-out, but, hearing another attack was imminent, he tried to get back to
  his gun. Twenty-four hours later he died in great agony from the effects of
  the gas.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* He was awarded the Victoria Cross for the gallant deed
  which cost him his life.</p>

  <p>"A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment went forward alone one afternoon
  to reconnoitre. He got into a wood, 1,200 yards in front of our lines, which
  he found occupied by Germans, and came back with the information that the
  enemy had evacuated a trench and were digging another&mdash;information which
  proved most valuable to the artillery as well as to his own unit.</p>

  <p>"A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st
  Cambridgeshires went out one night to reconnoitre a German trench 350 yards
  away. Creeping along the parapet of the trench, they heard sounds indicating
  the presence of six or seven of the enemy. Further on they heard deep snores,
  apparently proceeding from a dug-out immediately beneath them. Although they
  knew that the garrison of the trench outnumbered them, they decided to
  procure an identification. Unfortunately in pulling out a clasp knife with
  which to cut off the sleeper's identity disco, one of the officer's revolvers
  went off. A conversation in agitated whispers broke out in the German trench,
  but the patrol crept safely away, the garrison being too startled to
  fire.</p>

  <p>"Despite the very severe shelling to which the troops had been subjected,
  which obliterated trenches and caused very many casualties, the spirit of all
  ranks remains excellent. The enemy's losses, particularly on the 10th and
  13th, have unquestionably been serious. On the latter day they evacuated
  trenches (in face of the cavalry counter-attack) in which were afterwards
  found quantities of equipment and some of their own wounded. The enemy have
  been seen stripping our dead, and on three occasions men in khaki have been
  seen advancing."</p>

  <p>The fight went on by the exchange of desultory shell and rifle fire, but
  without any remarkable incident until the morning of 24 May. During this
  period, however, the French on our left had attained considerable success. On
  the 11th instant they captured Steenstraate and the trenches in Het Sas, and
  on the 16th they drove the enemy headlong over the canal, finding two
  thousand German dead. On the 17th they made a substantial advance on the east
  side of the canal, and on the 20th they repelled a German counter-attack,
  making a further advance in the same direction, and taking one hundred
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>On the early morning of the 24th a violent outburst of gas against nearly
  the whole front was followed by heavy shell fire, and the most determined
  attack was delivered against our position east of Ypres.</p>

  <p>The hour the attack commenced was 2.45 a.m. A large proportion of the men
  were asleep, and the attack was too sudden to give them time to put on their
  respirators.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Royal Irish and the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
  overcome by gas fumes, were driven out of a farm held in front of the left
  Division, and this the enemy proceeded to hold and fortify.</p>

  <p>All attempts to retake this farm during the day failed, and during the
  night of the 24th-25th the General Officer Commanding the left Division
  decided to take up a new line which, although slightly in rear of the old
  one, he considered to be a much better position. This operation was
  successfully carried out.</p>

  <p>Throughout the day the whole line was subjected to one of the most violent
  artillery attacks which it had ever undergone; and the 5th Corps and the
  Cavalry Divisions engaged had to fight hard to maintain their positions. On
  the following day, however, the line was consolidated, joining the right of
  the French at the same place as before, and passing through Wieltje (which
  was strongly fortified) in a southerly direction on to Hooge, where the
  Cavalry have since strongly occupied the chateau, and pushed our line further
  east.</p>

  <p>V. In pursuance of a promise which I made to the French Commander-in-Chief
  to support an attack which his troops were making on 9 May between the right
  of my line and Arras, I directed Sir Douglas Haig to carry out on that date
  an attack on the German trenches in the neighbourhood of Rougebanc
  (north-west of Fromelles) by the 4th Corps, and between Neuve Chapelle and
  Givenchy, by the 1st and Indian Corps.</p>

  <p>The bombardment of the enemy's positions commenced at 5 a.m.</p>

  <p>Half-an-hour later the 8th Division of the 4th Corps captured the first
  line of German trenches about Rougebanc, and some detachments seized a few
  localities beyond this line. It was soon found, however, that the position
  was much stronger than had been anticipated, and that a more extensive
  artillery preparation was necessary to crush the resistance offered by his
  numerous fortified posts.</p>

  <p>Throughout the 9th and 10th repeated efforts were made to make further
  progress. Not only was this found to be impossible, but the violence of the
  enemy's machine-gun fire from his posts on the flanks rendered the captured
  trenches so difficult to hold that all the units of the 4th Corps had to
  retire to their original position by the morning of the 10th.</p>

  <p>The 1 st and Indian Divisions south of Neuve Chapelle met with no greater
  success, and on the evening of the 10th I sanctioned Sir Douglas Haig's
  proposal to concentrate all our available resources on the southern point of
  attack.</p>

  <p>The 7th Division was moved round from the 4th Corps area to support this
  attack, and I directed the General Officer Commanding the First Army to delay
  it long enough to ensure a powerful and deliberate artillery preparation.</p>

  <p>The operations of the 9th and 10th formed part of a general plan of attack
  which the Allies were conjointly conducting on a line extending from the
  north of Arras to the south of Armentières; and, although immediate progress
  was not made during this time by the British forces, their attack assisted in
  securing the brilliant successes attained by the French forces on their
  right, not only by holding the enemy in their front, but by drawing off a
  part of the German reinforcements which were coming up to support their
  forces east of Arras.</p>

  <p>It was decided that the attack should be resumed on the night of the 12th
  instant, but the weather continued very dull and misty, interfering much with
  artillery observation. Orders were finally issued, therefore, for the action
  to commence on the night of the 15th instant.</p>

  <p>On May 15 I moved the Canadian Division into the 1st Corps area and placed
  them at the disposal of Sir Douglas Haig.</p>

  <p>The infantry of the Indian Corps and the 2nd Division of the 1st Corps
  advanced to the attack of the enemy's trenches which extended from Richebourg
  L'Avoué in a south-westerly direction.</p>

  <p>Before daybreak the 2nd Division had succeeded in capturing two lines of
  the enemy's trenches, but the Indian Corps were unable to make any progress
  owing to the strength of the enemy's defences in the neighbourhood of
  Richebourg L'Avoué.</p>

  <p>At daybreak the 7th Division, on the right of the 2nd, advanced to the
  attack, and by 7 a.m. had entrenched themselves on a line running nearly
  north and south, half-way between their original trenches and La Quinque Rue,
  having cleared and captured several lines of the enemy's trenches, including
  a number of fortified posts.</p>

  <p>As it was found impossible for the Indian Corps to make any progress in
  face of the enemy's defences Sir Douglas Haig directed the attack to be
  suspended at this point, and ordered the Indian Corps to form a defensive
  flank.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the day was spent in securing and consolidating positions
  which had been won, and endeavouring to unite the inner flanks of the 7th and
  2nd Divisions, which were separated by trenches and posts strongly held by
  the enemy.</p>

  <p>Various attempts which were made throughout the day to secure this object
  had not succeeded at nightfall in driving the enemy back.</p>

  <p>The German communications leading to the rear of their positions were
  systematically shelled throughout the night.</p>

  <p>About two hundred prisoners were captured on the 16th instant.</p>

  <p>Fighting was resumed at daybreak; and by 11 o'clock the 7th Division had
  made a considerable advance, capturing several more of the enemy's trenches.
  The task allotted to this Division was to push on in the direction of Rue
  D'Ouvert, Chateau St. Roch, and Canteleux.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Division was directed to push on when the situation permitted
  towards the Rue de Marais and Violanes.</p>

  <p>The Indian Division was ordered to extend its front far enough to enable
  it to keep touch with the left of the 2nd Division when they advanced.</p>

  <p>On this day I gave orders for the 51st (Highland) Division to move into
  the neighbourhood of Estaires to be ready to support the operations of the
  First Army.</p>

  <p>At about noon the enemy was driven out of the trenches and posts which he
  occupied between the two Divisions, the inner flanks of which were thus
  enabled to join hands.</p>

  <p>By nightfall the 2nd and 7th Divisions had made good progress, the area of
  captured ground being considerably extended to the right by the successful
  operations of the latter.</p>

  <p>The state of the weather on the morning of the 18th much hindered an
  effective artillery bombardment, and further attacks had, consequently, to be
  postponed.</p>

  <p>Infantry attacks were made throughout the line in the course of the
  afternoon and evening; but, although not very much progress was made, the
  line was advanced to the La Quinque Rue-Béthune Road before nightfall.</p>

  <p>On May 19 the 7th and 2nd Divisions were drawn out of the line to rest.
  The 7th Division was relieved by the Canadian Division and the 2nd Division
  by the 51st (Highland) Division.</p>

  <p>Sir Douglas Haig placed the Canadian and 51st Divisions, together with the
  artillery of the 2nd and 7th Divisions, under the command of
  Lieutenant-General Alderson, whom he directed to conduct the operations which
  had hitherto been carried on by the General Officer Commanding First Corps;
  and he directed the 7th Division to remain in Army Reserve.</p>

  <p>During the night of the 19th-20th a small post of the enemy in front of La
  Quinque Rue was captured.</p>

  <p>During the night of the 20th-21st the Canadian Division brilliantly
  carried on the excellent progress made by the 7th Division by seizing several
  of the enemy's trenches and pushing forward their whole line several hundred
  yards. A number of prisoners and some machine guns were captured.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd instant the 51st (Highland) Division was attached to the
  Indian Corps, and the General Officer Commanding the Indian Corps took charge
  of the operations at La Quinque Rue, Lieutenant-General Alderson with the
  Canadians conducting the operations to the north of that place.</p>

  <p>On this day the Canadian Division extended their line slightly to the
  right and repulsed three very severe hostile counter-attacks.</p>

  <p>On May 24-25 the 47th Division (2nd London Territorial) succeeded in
  taking some more of the enemy's trenches and making good the ground gained to
  the east and north.</p>

  <p>I had now reason to consider that the battle, which was commenced by the
  First Army on May 9 and renewed on the 16th, having attained for the moment
  the immediate object I had in view, should not be further actively proceeded
  with; and I gave orders to Sir Douglas Haig to curtail his artillery attack
  and to strengthen and consolidate the ground he had won.</p>

  <p>In the battle of Festubert above described the enemy was driven from a
  position which was strongly entrenched and fortified, and ground was won on a
  front of four miles to an average depth of 600 yards.</p>

  <p>The enemy is known to have suffered very heavy losses, and in the course
  of the battle 785 prisoners and 10 machine guns were captured. A number of
  machine guns were also destroyed by our fire.</p>

  <p>During the period under report the Army under my command has taken over
  trenches occupied by some other French Divisions.</p>

  <p>I am much indebted to General D'Urbal, commanding the 10th French Army,
  for the valuable and efficient support received throughout the battle of
  Festubert from three groups of French 75 millimetre guns.</p>

  <p>In spite of very unfavourable weather conditions, rendering observation
  most difficult, our own artillery did excellent work throughout the
  battle.</p>

  <p>VI. During the important operations described above, which were carried on
  by the First and Second Armies, the 3rd Corps was particularly active in
  making demonstrations with a view to holding the enemy in its front and
  preventing reinforcements reaching the threatened area.</p>

  <p>As an instance of the successful attempts to deceive the enemy in this
  respect it may be mentioned that on the afternoon of the 24th instant a
  bombardment of about an hour was carried out by the 6th Division with the
  object of distracting attention from the Ypres salient.</p>

  <p>Considerable damage was done to the enemy's parapets and wire; and that
  the desired impression was produced on the enemy is evident from the German
  wireless news on that day, which stated, "West of Lille the English attempts
  to attack were nipped in the bud."</p>

  <p>In previous reports I have drawn attention to the enterprise displayed by
  the troops of the 3rd Corps in conducting reconnaissances, and to the courage
  and resource shown by officers' and other patrols in the conduct of these
  minor operations.</p>

  <p>Throughout the period under report this display of activity has been very
  marked all along the 3rd Corps front, and much valuable information and
  intelligence have been collected.</p>

  <p>VII. I have much pleasure in again expressing my warm appreciation of the
  admirable manner in which all branches of the Medical Services now in the
  field, under the direction of Surgeon-General Sir Arthur Sloggett, have met
  and dealt with the many difficult situations resulting from the operations
  during the last two months.</p>

  <p>The medical units at the front were frequently exposed to the enemy's
  fire, and many casualties occurred amongst the officers of the regimental
  Medical Service. At all times the officers, non-commissioned officers and
  men, and nurses carried out their duties with fearless bravery and great
  devotion to the welfare of the sick and wounded.</p>

  <p>The evacuation of casualties from the front to the Base and to England was
  expeditiously accomplished by the Administrative Medical Staffs at the front
  and on the Lines of Communication. All ranks employed in units of evacuation
  and in Base Hospitals have shown the highest skill and untiring zeal and
  energy in alleviating the condition of those who passed through their
  hands.</p>

  <p>The whole organisation of the Medical Services reflects the highest credit
  on all concerned.</p>

  <p>VIII. I have once more to call your Lordship's attention to the part taken
  by the Royal Flying Corps in the general progress of the campaign, and 1 wish
  particularly to mention the invaluable assistance they rendered in the
  operations described in this report, under the able direction of
  Major-General Sir David Henderson.</p>

  <p>The Royal Flying Corps is becoming more and more an indispensable factor
  in combined operations. In cooperation with the artillery, in particular,
  there has been continuous improvement both in the methods and in the
  technical material employed. The ingenuity and technical skill displayed by
  the officers of the Royal Flying Corps, in effecting this improvement, have
  been most marked.</p>

  <p>Since my last despatch there has been a considerable increase both in the
  number and in the activity of German aeroplanes in our front. During this
  period there have been more than sixty combats in the air, in which not one
  British aeroplane has been lost. As these fights take place almost invariably
  over or behind the German lines, only one hostile aeroplane has been brought
  down in our territory. Five more, however, have been definitely wrecked
  behind their own lines, and many have been chased down and forced to land in
  most unsuitable ground.</p>

  <p>In spite of the opposition of hostile aircraft, and the great number of
  anti- aircraft guns employed by the enemy, air reconnaissance has been
  carried out with regularity and accuracy.</p>

  <p>I desire to bring to your Lordship's notice the assistance given by the
  French Military Authorities, and in particular by General Hirschauer,
  Director of the French Aviation Service, and his assistants, Colonel
  Bottieaux and Colonel Stammler, in the supply of aeronautical material,
  without which the efficiency of the Royal Flying Corps would have been
  seriously impaired.</p>

  <p>IX. In this despatch I wish again to remark upon the exceptionally good
  work done throughout this campaign by the Army Service Corps and by the Army
  Ordnance Department, not only in the field, but also on the Lines of
  Communication and at the Base ports.</p>

  <p>To foresee and meet the requirements in the matter of Ammunition, Stores,
  Equipment, Supplies, and Transport has entailed on the part of the officers,
  non-commissioned officers, and men of these Services a sustained effort which
  has never been relaxed since the beginning of the war, and which has been
  rewarded by the most conspicuous success.</p>

  <p>The close co-operation of the Railway Transport Department, whose
  excellent work, in combination with the French Railway Staff, has ensured the
  regularity of the maintenance services, has greatly contributed to this
  success.</p>

  <p>The degree of efficiency to which these Services have been brought was
  well demonstrated in the course of the Second Battle of Ypres.</p>

  <p>The roads between Poperinghe and Ypres, over which transport, supply, and
  ammunition columns had to pass, were continually searched by hostile heavy
  artillery during the day and night; whilst the passage of the canal through
  the town of Ypres, and along the roads east of that town, could only be
  effected under most difficult and dangerous conditions as regards hostile
  shell fire. Yet, throughout the whole five or six weeks during which these
  conditions prevailed, the work was carried on with perfect order and
  efficiency.</p>

  <p>X. Since the date of my last report some Divisions of the "New" Army have
  arrived in this country.*</p>

  <p>* He was awarded the Victoria Cross for the gallant deed which cost him
  his life.</p>

  <p>I made a close inspection of one Division, formed up on parade, and have
  at various times seen several units belonging to others.</p>

  <p>These Divisions have as yet had very little experience in actual fighting;
  but, judging from all I have seen, I am of opinion that they ought to prove a
  valuable addition to any fighting force.</p>

  <p>As regards the Infantry, their physique is excellent, whilst their bearing
  and appearance on parade reflects great credit on the officers and staffs
  responsible for their training. The units appear to be thoroughly well
  officered and commanded. The equipment is in good order and efficient.</p>

  <p>Several units of artillery have been tested in the firing line behind the
  trenches, and 1 hear very good reports of them. Their shooting has been
  extremely good, and they are quite fit to take their places in the line.</p>

  <p>The Pioneer Battalions have created a very favourable impression, the
  officers being keen and ingenious and the men of good physique and good
  diggers. The equipment is suitable. The training in field works has been
  good, but, generally speaking, they require the assistance of Regular Royal
  Engineers as regards laying out of important works. Man for man in digging
  the battalions should do practically the same amount of work as an equivalent
  number of sappers, and in riveting, entanglement, etc., a great deal more
  than the ordinary infantry battalions.</p>

  <p>XI. During the months of April and May several divisions of the
  Territorial Force joined the Army under my command.</p>

  <p>Experience has shown that these troops have now reached a standard of
  efficiency which enables them to be usefully employed in complete divisional
  units.</p>

  <p>Several divisions have been so employed; some in the trenches, others in
  the various offensive and defensive operations reported in this despatch.</p>

  <p>In whatever kind of work these units have been engaged, they have all
  borne an active and distinguished part, and have proved themselves thoroughly
  reliable and efficient.</p>

  <p>The opinion I have expressed in former despatches as to the use and value
  of the Territorial Force has been fully justified by recent events.</p>

  <p>XII. The Prime Minister was kind enough to accept an invitation from me to
  visit the Army in France, and arrived at my Headquarters on May 30.</p>

  <p>Mr. Asquith made an exhaustive tour of the front, the hospitals, and all
  the administrative arrangements made by Corps Commanders for the health and
  comfort of men behind the trenches.</p>

  <p>It was a great encouragement to all ranks to see the Prime Minister
  amongst them; and the eloquent words which on several occasions he addressed
  to the troops had a most powerful and beneficial effect.</p>

  <p>As I was desirous that the French Commander-in-Chief should see something
  of the British troops, I asked General Joffre to be kind enough to inspect a
  division on parade.</p>

  <p>The General accepted my invitation, and on May 27 he inspected the 7th
  Division, under the command of Major-General H. de la P. Gough, C.B., which
  was resting behind the trenches.</p>

  <p>General Joffre subsequently expressed to me in a letter the pleasure it
  gave him to see the British troops, and his appreciation of their appearance
  on parade. He requested me to make this known to all ranks.</p>

  <p>The Moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Right Reverend Dr. Wallace
  Williamson, Dean of the Order of the Thistle, visited the Army in France
  between May 7 and 17, and made a tour of the Scottish regiments with
  excellent results.</p>

  <p>XIII. In spite of the constant strain put upon them by the arduous nature
  of the fighting which they are called upon to carry out daily and almost
  hourly, the spirit which animates all ranks of the Army in France remains
  high and confident.</p>

  <p>They meet every demand made upon them with the utmost cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>This splendid spirit is particularly manifested by the men in hospital,
  even amongst those who are mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>The invariable question which comes from lips hardly able to utter a sound
  is, "How are things going on at the front?"</p>

  <p>XIV. In conclusion, I desire to bring to Your Lordship's special notice
  the valuable services rendered by General Sir Douglas Haig in his successful
  handling of the troops of the First Army throughout the Battle of Festubert,
  and Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert Plumer for his fine defence of Ypres
  throughout the arduous and difficult operations during the latter part of
  April and the month of May.</p>

  <p class="first">I have the honour to be,</p>

  <p class="first">Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,</p>

  <p class="first">J.D.P. French,<br>
  Field-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief, The British Army in France.</p>
