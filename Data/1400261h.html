  <h3>First published in <i>The Writer</i>, January 1931</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

<p class="quote"><i>WILLIAM BOLLITO said of Mr. Kline, "In the world of scientific fiction, there are chiefs. They must be good. There is Otis Adelbert Kline whom I am sure I would rather read than many fashionable novelists." When asked to tell some of the problems of creating fantastic stories, Mr. Kline wrote us, "The subject you assigned me is a pretty big one. It has so many interesting ramifications that a whole series of articles would scarcely cover it."</i></p>

<hr>

  <p class="first">WRITING, with me, is a semi-subjective process. I mean by
  this that I find it necessary, at times, to wait for that temperamental and
  elusive entity, my Muse, to cooperate with me. Every day I try to write, and
  I mean <em>try</em>. But some days I produce only a few hundred words fit for
  nothing but filing in the wastebasket. And on the other hand I have, in a
  single day, produced six or seven thousand words of marketable copy.</p>

  <p>So this, the problem of successfully wooing the Muse, is the one which I
  find most difficult of solution. I have a profound admiration for writers who
  can sit down at their desks, day after day, and, without fail, bat out two or
  three thousand words of good, salable material in two or three hours. Most of
  them will tell you this is the result of practice&mdash;of continuous trying.
  But I've been trying for ten years, and selling stories for eight, and today
  my Muse is as obstinate and capricious as ever.</p>

  <p>Although I had previously written songs, plays, and moving picture
  scenarios, my first inspiration for writing fiction, strange as it may seem,
  came from reading books on psychology. And that reading was the result of
  some previous incidents in my life, so perhaps I had better begin a little
  farther back.</p>

  <p>When I graduated from high school, I decided that I would launch on a
  musical career, and gave up my plans for going to college. I became a
  professional songwriter. I also tried my hand at plays and moving picture
  scenarios, and wrote vaudeville sketches and even plots for burlesque shows.
  I later became a music publisher. But it was a hard life, with much night
  work, plugging songs in theatres, dance halls, and cafes, and I tired of it,
  in spite of the fascination the element of chance gave to the work.</p>

  <p>Putting out songs was like playing poker; no one could predict a hit with
  certainty.</p>

  <p>I decided on a business career, and went to a business college. Shortly
  after this, I got a job, and at twenty-two I married. No chance, then, to go
  to college. But going to college had been a sort of tradition in our family.
  I had to work every day to keep the well-known and justly unpopular wolf from
  breaking down the door. But my evenings were my own. I decided to use them
  for the improvement of what I optimistically called my mind.</p>

  <p>I would take one subject at a time, and study. But where should I begin? I
  recalled that a certain ancient philosopher had once said there are but three
  things in the universe&mdash;mind, force, and matter. Mind controls force,
  and force moves matter. It was easy to decide which of these things was the
  more important, so I began by studying psychology&mdash;a science which, by
  the way, is in its infancy&mdash;no farther advanced today than were the
  physical sciences a century ago.</p>

  <p>Having read practically everything there was on the subject over a period
  of years, I began to have some theories about psychic phenomena, myself. I
  started a ponderous scientific treatise, but didn't carry it far. This medium
  limited my imagination too much. Then I wrote a novelette, <i>The Thing of a
  Thousand Shapes</i>, in which some of my ideas and theories were
  incorporated. It was turned down by most of the leading magazines in 1922,
  but early in 1923 a magazine was made to order for the story&mdash;<i>Weird
  Tales</i>. It was accepted, and published in the first issue. This was before
  the word "ectoplasm" was used in connection with psychic phenomena. A German
  writer, whose translated work I had read, had coined the word "teleplasm,"
  but this did not seem precisely the right term, so I coined the word
  "psychoplasm." I notice that it is being used today by some writers of occult
  stories.</p>

  <p>I had finished writing the above novelette early in 1921, and decided to
  try my hand at a novel. I wanted to write an interplanetary story, and I
  believe the reason for this lay in the following incidents.</p>

  <p>As soon as I was able to understand, my father, who was interested in all
  the sciences, and especially in astronomy, had begun pointing out to me the
  planets that were visible to the naked eye; had told me what was known of
  their masses, densities, surfaces, atmospheres, motions, and satellites; and
  that there was a possibility that some of them were inhabited by living
  beings. He taught me how to find the Big and Little Dippers, and thus locate
  the North Star, that I might make the heavens serve as a compass for me, by
  night as well as by day. He pointed out that beautiful and mysterious
  constellation, The Pleiades, which inspired the lines in the Book of Job:
  "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bonds of
  Orion?"</p>

  <p>He told me of the vast distances which, according to the computations of
  scientists, lay between our world and these twinkling celestial
  bodies&mdash;that the stars were suns, some smaller than our own, and others
  so large that if they were hollow, our entire Solar System could operate
  inside them without danger of the planet farthest from the sun striking the
  shell. He told me of the nebulae, which might be giant universes in the
  making, and that beyond the known limits of our own universe it was possible
  that there were countless others, stretching on into infinity.</p>

  <p>My childish imagination had been fired by these things, and I had read
  voraciously such books on the subject of astronomy as were available in my
  father's well-stocked library. He supplemented and encouraged this reading by
  many interesting discussions, in which a favorite subject for speculation was
  the possibility that planets, other than our own, were inhabited.</p>

  <p>Geology, archaeology, and ethnology were also brought into our
  discussions. We lived in northern Illinois, which had in some distant
  geological epoch been the bottom of an ocean, and took pleasure in collecting
  such fossil remains as were available. Dad and I could become very much
  excited over bits of coral, and fossil marine animals.</p>

  <p>Then there were Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and others, with their
  interesting theories. There was the great mystery of man's advent on this
  earth, which religion explained in one manner and science in another. We
  discussed these, and a third possibility, an idea of my father's, that some
  of our ancient civilizations might have been originated by people who came
  here from other planets&mdash;the science of space-navigation forgotten by
  their descendants, but the tradition of their celestial advent persisting in
  their written and oral traditions. That such traditions did persist was
  beyond dispute. Whence came these traditions that were not confined to
  related civilizations, but were preserved by widely separated peoples?</p>

  <p>It was with this background that I began my first novel in 1921&mdash;a
  tale of adventures on the planet Venus. I called it <i>Grandon of Terra</i>,
  but the name was later changed to <i>The Planet of Peril</i>.</p>

  <p>The problem of how to get my hero to Venus bothered me not at all, for I
  had been reading about the marvelous powers of the subjective mind: of
  telepathy, that mysterious means of communication between minds which needs
  no physical media for its transmission, and which seems independent of time,
  space, and matter. I haven't the space to enlarge on this here, but can refer
  you to the thousands of cases recorded by the British Society for Psychical
  Research, if you are interested. There was also the many cases of so-called
  astral projection, recorded by the above society in a volume called
  <i>Phantasms of the Living</i>. My hero, therefore, reached Venus by the
  simple (try it) expedient of exchanging bodies with a young man on that
  planet who was his physical twin. He reported his adventures on Venus to an
  earthly scientist, Dr. Morgan, by telepathy.</p>

  <p>Cloud-wrapped Venus is supposed to be in a stage similar to our own
  carboniferous era. I, therefore, clothed my hypothetical Venus with the flora
  of such an era&mdash;ferns, cycads, and thallophytes of many kinds, including
  algae, fungi, and lichens of strange and eerie form.</p>

  <p>Through the fern jungles and fungoid forests stalked gigantic reptiles,
  imaginary creatures, but analogous to those ponderous prehistoric Saurians
  that roved the earth when our coal and petroleum beds were having their
  inception. There were Herbivora devouring the primitive plants, and fierce
  Carnivora that devoured the Herbivora and each other, and disputed the
  supremacy of man. Air and water teemed with active life and sudden
  dealt&mdash;life feeding on death and death snuffing out life.</p>

  <p>There were men in various stages of evolutionary development&mdash;men
  without eyes, living in lightless caverns, who had degenerated to a physical
  and mental condition little better than that of Batrachia. There were
  monkey-men swinging through the branches and lianas of the fern forests,
  blood-sucking bat-men living in caves in a volcanic crater&mdash;a veritable
  planetary inferno, and gigantic termites of tremendous mental development
  that had enslaved a race of primitive human beings.</p>

  <p>There were mighty empires, whose armies warred with strange and terrible
  weapons, and airships which flew at tremendous speed propelled by mechanisms
  which amplified the power of mind over matter&mdash;telekinesis.</p>

  <p>After writing and rewriting, polishing and re-polishing, I sent the story
  out&mdash; a bulky script, ninety-thousand words long. At that time there but
  two possible American markets for that type of story, <i>Science and
  Invention</i> and <i>Argosy-All Story</i>, but I had not been watching the
  Munsey publication and did not know it used this sort of thing. I submitted
  the story, first, to <i>Science and Invention</i>. It was turned down because
  of the paucity of mechanical science.</p>

  <p>When <i>Weird Tales</i> came into being, I tried it on this magazine.
  Edwin Baird, the editor liked it, but finally, after holding it several
  months, rejected it because of its length. He suggested that I try
  <i>Argosy-All Story</i>, but I didn't do it then. I let it lie around for a
  long time. Every once in a while I would dig it out of the file and read it
  over. Each time, I found new places to polish. I was writing and selling a
  number of other stories in the interval&mdash; occult, weird, mystery,
  detective, adventure, and Western. I also collaborated with my brother, Allen
  S. Kline, on a novel set in the South American Jungle, called <i>The Secret
  Kingdom</i>. This was later published in <i>Amazing Stories</i>.</p>

  <p>One day I was talking to Baird, and he asked me what I had done with my
  fantastic novel. He said I was foolish not to try <i>Argosy-All Story</i>. I
  accordingly recopied my pencil-marked version, and sent it on. Good old Bob
  Davis, dean of American editors, held it so long I had some hope: that he was
  going to buy it. But it came back, eventually, with a long, friendly letter
  asking to see more of my work. I later learned that he had just bought the
  first of Ralph Milne Farley's famous radio stories, the scene of which was on
  the planet Venus, and whose settings, therefore, were somewhat similar to
  mine.</p>

  <p>After that, I spent enough money on express and postage to buy a good
  overcoat, sending the story around the country, and out of it.</p>

  <p>Finally, Mr. Joseph Bray then book-buyer, and now president of A.C.
  McClurg &amp; Company, told me he would publish it if I would first get it
  serialized in a magazine. I had turned down a couple of low-priced offers for
  serialization, but I started over the list again. A.H. Bittner, the new
  editor of <i>Argosy</i>, who has been building circulation for that magazine
  since he took over the editorial chair, bought the story. A month later, Mr.
  Bray accepted it for publication as a novel.</p>

  <p><i>The Planet of Peril</i> brought many enthusiastic fan letters to
  <i>Argosy</i>. I received a number of complimentary letters from people all
  over the country who had read it in magazine or book form. I was overwhelmed
  with requests for autographs, and all that sort of thing. A baby in Battle
  Creek, Michigan, was named after me. It was encouraging.</p>

  <p>Last September, Grosset &amp; Dunlap reprinted the book in the popular
  edition. In a bulletin to their salesmen they recently reported that, despite
  the fact that they had not made any special effort to push it, and that it
  was a first novel, it was enjoying a continuous and persistent
  resale&mdash;something unusual for a first novel. They suggested that their
  salesmen remember this item when calling on the trade. This, also, was
  encouraging.</p>

  <p>Since then, <i>Argosy</i> has serialized and McClurg has published in book
  form two more novels &mdash; <i>Maza of the Moon</i> and <i>The Prince of
  Peril</i>, the latter a companion story to <i>The Planet of Peril</i>.</p>

  <p>Right now I'm working night and day on a new novel for spring publication,
  in order to make a deadline date set by my publisher. Also, I've reached the
  length limit set by <i>The Writer's</i> editor, so that will be all for this
  time.</p>
