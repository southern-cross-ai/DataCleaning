<h3>A WISE Y. SYMON STORY</h3>


<p class="blurb">A short story featuring the journalist York Symon (aka
"Wise Y. Symon"), hero of the series published in book form in 1929 under
the title <i>The Reporter</i>. So far as is known, the present story
did not appear in any collection published during Edgar Wallace's
lifetime.</p>
<hr>
<br>


<p class="first">
A POLICE reporter has many interests and many friends, most of them queer.
He spends his life in an atmosphere the principal ingredient of which is
suspicion. Wise Y. Symon was a great police reporter, a veritable Napoleon of
police reporters, and his greatness was due in no small degree to the fact that
he preserved his faith in human nature. And, I have observed, that the title to
greatness is often based upon the proper admixture of conflicting virtues.</p>

<p>There was a girl who used to go to work in the city office of a firm of
lawyers in Waldorf House who interested Wise Symon immensely. He got to know
her four years before this story opens, at a time when she was known to every
reporter in town, and her portrait, large or small as the exigencies of space
dictated, was to be found in almost every morning or evening journal.</p>

<p>The disappearance of her father, Harrigay Ford, was a nine days' wonder, and
there came a time when newspapers no longer interviewed his daughter or printed
the statements of trans-Atlantic stewards who had recognised him as the
mysterious passenger who took his meals in his cabin.</p>

<p>After all. a wealthy man has the right to appear and disappear as he
wishes. The story died when his banker, the patriarchal Mr. Borthwick.
intervened. Harrigay Ford had gone abroad and had written a hasty note on the
letter-heading of the <I>S.S. Creptic</I> saying that he expected to be absent
from England for some years, and directing Mr. Borthwick to pay to the daughter
of the said Harrigay Ford the sum of £100 per annum, payable quarterly.</p>

<p>It was a pretty mean allowance for a millionaire to make to his motherless
child, and his only excuse could have been that he hardly knew he had a
daughter. For Mr. Ford was a pillar of alcoholic fire by night and a dopey cloud
by day.</p>

<p>Eileen Ford did not grieve for her parent. She lost nothing by his
disappearance. She lived in her father's big house and sent the bills to his
banker, and the bills were paid. But £100 a year was hardly the income that
went with the style in which she lived, and after the Ford Case had disappeared
from the scare headings, she went to a school of stenography, learnt the
relative positions of Q.W.E.R.T.Y.U.I.O. and P. on the keyboard of a
typewriter, and raised her annual income by another £100 in the prim offices of
Atkins and Walters, solicitors.</p>

<p>Symon's friendship with the girl survived his newspaper interest in her
fortune, and probably that is why the strange behaviour of Mr. Hopper attracted
more than its share of his attention, and why the sequel to that attention
brought the scoop of scoops to the humming presses of the <I>Telephone
Herald</I>.</P>

<P>To say that the office or even the presses of the <I>Telephone
Herald</I> hummed is, of course, a picturesque inexactitude. Newspaper offices
do not hum. They bang and they squeak and they <I>click-clack-click</i>
but they do not hum. Glass doors swing recklessly, wet
men buttoned to their chins dash madly in, throwing off their moist coats and
saying unprintable things about Great Public Favourites who deliver addresses
on 'Labour' at inaccessible places in the most impossible weather.</p>

<p>The carriers in pneumatic tubes whine and plop! The linotypes which, by
special arrangement, are invariably sited over the reporters' room, rumble and
clack mysteriously, and ever and anon a plaintive voice cries 'Boy!'
A small and grimy democrat wipes his jammy mouth with the back of his hand and
hurries breathlessly to collect the literature. This literature is written in
grey pencil and tastefully decorated with blue strokes by a super-editor.</p>

<p>At a little before midnight one snowy evening Wise Y. Symon drifted into
the night editor's presence and lay down on his desk. The wise man invariably
lay down on anything he couldn't rest his foot upon. His <I>modus operandi</I>
was to get to the end of the desk and, doubling himself up like a foot rule,
deposit the upper portion of his body east and west so to speak, resting his
chin upon his hands.</p>

<p>The night editor pushed back his chair with a sigh, dropped his shell-
rimmed spectacles to the end of his nose, and eyed Wise Symon sadly.</p>

<p>'Where's that story?' he asked at random.</p>

<p>'What story?' demanded Symon.</p>

<p>The night editor sniffed.</p>

<p>'You don't know anything about it, O,' accused Mr. Symon (the night editor's
name was Oliver, and he was referred to either as 'O' or 'The Olive.')</p>

<p>'Well, what are you doing here, anyway?' complained Mr. Oliver fretfully.
'There's a newspaper got to go to bed. Have you never heard that such things
happen?'</p>

<p>'Could I know anything of the underworld and not know that?' asked Symon
reproachfully. 'No, my O, I have not come here to gloat over you. I do not
climb into gay clothing for the joy of paying tantalising calls on the slaves
of diurnalism. I have a reason for this mysterious visit.'</p>

<p>Wise Symon was in evening dress, and he was beautiful to behold, from the
crest of his well-brushed head to the base line of his twinkling shoes.</p>

<p>'I noticed that,' said the patient Oliver, swinging round in his chair and
lighting his pipe. 'You can hire these things, I understand&mdash;but you have
to
buy the shirt. Where have you been dining, Y, and on whom?'</p>

<p>Mr. Symon produced with much ostentation a gold case and extracted a large
Turkish cigarette.</p>

<p>'I have been dining with a great bank official,' he said carefully, 'a man
of infinite charm and sagacity. I have a further appointment with him at one
o'clock, at which hour I proceed to his costly and palatial flat where,
surrounded by every evidence of refinement and luxury, I shall endeavour to
extract the body of a story, the slippery tail of which is already within my
hand.'</p>

<p>'Loud cheers!' said the night editor wearily. 'Now, having delivered the
speech of the evening, if you will kindly take your elbows out of my ink-pot, I
will resume my little job of work refreshed '</p>

<p>'And invigorated,' finished Y. Symon, the star amongst police reporters,
'by the clarity and logic&mdash; Here's the old man. O.'</p>

<p>The 'old man' was the managing editor of the <I>Telephone Herald</I>, and
at that moment he wore the facial expression peculiar to managing editors at
midnight&mdash;an expression which may be likened to that of a man who has an
engagement with the public executioner and is anxious to commit just another
tiny little murder before he dies. He saw Symon, who belonged to the charmed
circle which gathers at the daily editorial conference when even matters of
policy are discussed, and started back with an affectation of faintness at the
sight of Mr. Symon's society kit.</p>

<p>'Hello, Symon&mdash;why this disguise?'</p>

<p>'I have been dining with a gentleman,' said Mr. Symon magnificently. 'We had
real wine and real cigars.'</p>

<p>'Police reporters should keep their places,' said the editor, 'you'll get
your head turned. Who was the swell crook?'</p>

<p>'William Haliburton Hopper,' said Y solemnly.</p>

<p>'Hopper?' The editor frowned. 'He's not on my wine list. I don't even
remember that he is in the <Ijeunesse dorée</I> class. What did he make,
aeroplane or margarine?'</p>

<p>'William is no vulgar profiteer.'</p>

<p>Wise Symon sat on the edge of the nearest desk which was unoccupied, and
there was a puzzled look in his eyes.</p>

<p>'You can guess that I am not wasting time on any ordinary millionaire,' he
said. 'If William had no other recommendation than a taste for bad wine and
toothpicks, I should have let him run loose. It's only lately that William has
dawned upon the world of fashion. I met him drinking solitary in the grill-room
of Petroni's about a week ago. It may have been his rough neck, or the butt of
the gun I saw sticking out of his hip pocket, or the saucy talk he was handing
to the waiter, but one of these things attracted me. So I palled up with him
and we talked a while. He wanted to see life; he had bags of money and an
infinite capacity for sweet champagne. Ugh! Well, it was interesting. He has
the mentality of a goat, and a vocabulary that's strictly limited to about a
hundred nouns and six adjectives.'</p>

<p>'How did he make his money?'</p>

<p>'He said he inherited it from his uncle. But he doesn't look like the kind
of man who ever had an uncle. I shadowed him but he slipped me. Tonight we met
by appointment&mdash;and I saw him home.'</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>'He is the caretaker of Borthwick's Bank.'</p>

<p>'That sounds good for old man Borthwick,' said the editor after a moment's
silence. 'Does the caretaker sleep on the premises?'</p>

<p>Wise Symon nodded.</p>

<p>'Yes and no. He rents a flat near the bank in addition. That is where I am
meeting him.'</p>

<p>'And he spends his spare time up West loading himself up with champagne?'
said Hammond. 'H'm! Well, old Borthwick must know this. His bank has always
been a shaky affair, and a hint of this sort of thing might smash him. He
nearly went broke four years ago. Are you seeing the caretaker again?'</p>

<p>'Yes. But he told me that he had some business to do before he saw me
again, and naturally that piqued my curiosity. I followed him and saw him turn
into the side entrance of the bank. Then I remembered him. I had seen him
sweeping the steps&mdash;I pass the premises every day.'</p>

<p>The editor looked at his watch.</p>

<p>'I was going home, but I think I'll wait for you. When will you be back?'</p>

<p>'Not later than by three,' said Wise Symon. 'It looks a good kind of story
to me, and I'd like to get the full facts in type before the police rope him
in.'</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond nodded.</p>

<p>'It's a good story, and the public like this kind of case&mdash;the working
man by
day and the millionaire by night stuff. But you'll have to break the news to
Borthwick before the police start moving/</p>

<p>It was a quarter to three when Wise Symon came into the managing editor's
office.</p>

<p>'It's a rum story.' he said, dropping his soaking hat on the floor. 'Hopper
told me nothing except that he could wrestle with the best wrestler in the
world, and he could drink three times more than any other man in the
world&mdash;neither of which items of information was particularly helpful/</p>

<p>He stopped and the editor, stretching back in his chair, looked up at
him.</p>

<p>'Out with it&mdash;you discovered something you did not expect to
discover?'</p>

<p>Wise Symon shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, sir. I'm disappointed. I hoped to make a discovery&mdash;and
didn't.'</p>

<p>'We're both thinking the same thing, I expect.' said Hammond quietly. 'What
have you got on your mind, Symon?'</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what I've got on what passes for my mind,' said Wise Symon,
after a little hesitation. 'I associate this disgusting prosperity of Hopper
with the disappearance of Harrigay Ford.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were going to say that.' The editor shook his head. 'It's a
long time since Ford went, three or four years, and frankly I think your
suggestion is fantastic, although I expected it. Did the man say anything which
gave you the impression that he knew anything about Ford's disappearance?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' said Wise Symon.</p>

<p>'What's your theory?'</p>

<p>'Ford was a drunkard and a dope fiend,' said Symon. 'Such men, as we know,
are happiest in the most sordid and miserable surroundings, however cultured
might have been their upbringing. I suggest that when four years ago Harrigay
Ford disappeared he did not leave London. Yes, I know what you are going to say
about the letter written on the steamship notepaper, but you or I could have
done exactly the same thing. One could have boarded the steamer, written the
note, posted it, and have never left the country. My theory is that Harrigay
Ford is to be found in some low haunt in this city, that Mr. Hopper is his
guardian and treasurer. I made inquiries yesterday, and I found that Hopper
got his job at the bank on the recommendation of Ford.'</p>

<p>The editor scratched his chin.</p>

<p>'The thing to do, of course, is to see old Borthwick tomorrow. I happen to
know that cheques signed by Ford come through fairly regularly and are cashed
by Borthwick&mdash;Borthwick being his banker. The old man was telling me at
the club
only the other day how worried he was about the matter. At any rate, Borthwick
would be able to tell you from where these cheques come. I think you will find
they come from abroad. As to Ford being concealed in an opium den in this
town&mdash;why. I'm sceptical! Those sort of things only happen in books.'</p>

<p>It was at half-past ten in the morning that Wise Symon turned into
Borthwick's Bank. It was an unimposing little building, but had constituted the
premises of some bank or other from time immemorial.</p>

<p>Borthwick's Bank was a private affair with very few clients, and its staff
consisted of two elderly men who spent most of their time checking the
fluctuations of the Stock Exchange, Mr. Borthwick being by all accounts somewhat
overloaded with the collateral of his scanty <I>clientèle</i>.</P>

<P>One of the cashiers took Mr. Symon's card and disappeared with it
through a door at the back of the premises. He returned to beckon Symon
forward, and old Borthwick rose from behind the leather-covered table, where he
spent most of his day reading through a large magnifying glass the press
reports of foreign exchanges and transactions, and offered his big hand to the
visitor.</p>

<p>He was a man who stood six feet in his stockings. He had one of those
massive heads which Raphael loved to paint in such scenes as the apostles
appeared. A snowy white beard reached down half way to his waist, a bluff,
benevolent, shrewd old gentleman with a thunderous voice that was wholly in
keeping with his hearty appearance, he seized Symon's hand in a grip that made
that young gentleman wince.</p>

<p>'Sit down, sit down. Mr. Symon,' he bellowed. 'I remember you very well
indeed. What have you come to bother me about?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I have no pleasant news for you,' smiled Symon. and told the
story of the gay caretaker.</p>

<p>Mr. Borthwick listened with a troubled face.</p>

<p>'I am sorry he does that,' he said, when Symon had finished, 'it gets the
bank a bad name.'</p>

<p>'But surely&mdash;' began the astonished Symon.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's his own money all right!' said Mr. Borthwick. 'He inherited a
large sum of money from a brother who died in Australia. As a matter of fact,
he has opened an account with us.
I tried to persuade him to give up his work at the bank, but so far he has
refused. Was he very drunk?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Pretty drunk,' said Symon, a little disappointed as all great artists are
when their revelations fail to produce the sensation they anticipated. 'He told
me that it was his uncle who had died.'</p>

<p>'Very possibly, very possibly,' said Mr. Borthwick. 'I know it was some sort
of relation. And now as to the other matter, Mr. Symon?'</p>

<p>'I want to know if you have any news you can give me about Ford.'</p>

<p>'None, I am afraid,' the old man shook his head sorrowfully. 'What a
terrible thing, Mr. Symon, what a terrible thing! Drink and drugs! Surely, that
is a lesson which every young man can lay to heart!'</p>

<p>'When did you last hear from him, Mr. Borthwick?'</p>

<p>'About a week ago,' said the old man.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me in what country he can be found?' '</p>

<p>'I cannot tell you where he can be found at all,' replied Mr. Borthwick. 'I
should be exceeding my instructions if I did, but I may say that he is in
Australia.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure?' asked Symon, disconcerted for the second time.</p>

<p>'Absolutely sure,' said Mr. Borthwick.</p>

<p>He rose, walked to a safe and unlocked it. From a drawer he produced a
cheque and handed it to the reporter. Wise Symon, who had a memory like a cash
register, noted that its number was 1795, and that it was signed with Ford's
signature&mdash;with which Symon was familiar. He handed it back.</p>

<p>'It arrived from Australia only two days ago,' said Mr. Borthwick, locking
it back in the safe.</p>

<p>Wise Symon rose.</p>

<p>'Well, I think that's about all I have got to ask you,' he said, disguising
as best he could his chagrin.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't like to buy a few Southern Pacifics while you are here.' said
the jovial old man, 'one of my unfortunate clients has a parcel he would like
to dispose of?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you, Mr. Borthwick,' said Wise Symon hurriedly, and he left the
old banker chuckling.</p>

<p>His next call was upon the firm of lawyers which employed Ford's daughter,
and he had no difficulty in persuading them to allow him to see her.</p>

<p>'No, Mr. Symon,' she replied, in answer to his question, 'I have not heard
from my father. Have you?' she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'Do you get your allowance regularly?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, 'such as it is.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't Mr. Borthwick ever give you a message from your father?'</p>

<p>'Never,' she said, a little sadly.</p>

<p>'How long has Mr. Borthwick been your father's banker?'</p>

<p>'Oh, for a very long time, longer than I can remember! They
were old friends in the days before daddy was&mdash;' Her lips trembled.</p>

<p>'And after?'</p>

<p>'Well, after daddy wasn't very nice to Mr. Borthwick. He used to behave
dreadfully to that poor old gentleman. Once he threatened to turn over his
account to the National Bank, and that would have ruined Mr. Borthwick.'</p>

<p>'When was this?' asked Wise Symon.</p>

<p>'About a month before daddy went away&mdash;or it may not have been so
long. I
know Mr. Borthwick was very much distressed.'</p>

<p>He asked her a few other questions, but could get no information that was
any more helpful than that which he already had. He met his editor at lunch and
made a qualified admission of his failure.</p>

<p>'I didn't think Ford was in this town,' said Hammond, 'and the caretaker's
legacy rather knocks the bottom out of your theories, my wise lad.'</p>

<p>'My theories are bottomless,' said Wise Symon. 'Anyway. I shan't meet
William tonight as I promised. If he is only a vulgar legatee and not the
interesting criminal I thought he was he has ceased to fascinate me.'</p>

<p>It so happened that a very commonplace elopement, in which there figured
the daughter, the chauffeur, and the cashbox of a Society leader, kept the
police reporter fairly busy. He turned in his 'copy' at eleven o'clock that
night and had hardly stepped into the night editor's office when that worthy
sprung at him, tore the 'copy' from his hands, and pushed him out again.</p>

<p>'Hustle, Y,' he said. 'Your caretaker, William Hopper&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What about him?' asked Y quickly.</p>

<p>'He was found shot dead tonight on a bench in the park. We've been looking
for you all the evening.'</p>

<p>There were few details that Wise Symon could gather from the police. The
man had obviously been murdered, since no weapon had been found near the spot
where the body was discovered. A policeman on duty had heard the shot and had
run in the direction, but did not meet the murderer.</p>

<p>The caretaker was in his ordinary working costume and was quite dead when
he was found. A bunch of keys, a few shillings, and a plug of tobacco were his
worldly possessions. Siddon, from Scotland Yard, was in charge of the case, and
Siddon was particularly friendly to Wise Symon.</p>

<p>'You are sure nothing else was found on the body?' asked reporter.</p>

<p>'Here is everything,' said Siddon, pointing to the table in his office on
which a miscellaneous collection of articles were displayed. 'There is no
evidence to support your story that he was a very wealthy man unless you call
this wealth.'</p>

<p>He picked up a crumpled scrap of paper and handed it to Symon. It was the
half of a torn cheque, and on the back of it was scribbled the ciphers:
£10,000.</p>

<p>Symon turned the cheque over and looked at the writing again, and his eyes
were a blaze of triumph as he handed the paper back to the police officer.</p>

<p>'Jimmy Siddon,' said he, 'I am going to make your fortune: or, at any rate,
I am going to make your name.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked Siddon. 'Do you know anything?'</p>

<p>'I know everything,' said Wise Symon. 'Let's go along and see old
Borthwick. Bring that paper with you, and I think we shall be able to tell him
a great deal more about his caretaker that he will just hate to hear.'</p>

<p>'Has the man been robbing him?' asked Siddon, as the taxi sped through the
night towards Hampstead, where Mr. Borthwick had his severe but expensive
rooms.</p>

<p>'You mean has he been robbing the bank? Honestly, I don't think he has. At
any rate, if he had lived that is not the charge I should have made against
him. Siddon, this story is mine; and you have got to keep the other
journalistic ghouls at bay until I have spun it over a full page of the
<I>Telephone Herald</I>.'</p>

<p>'You've got to make it a story yet,' said Siddon, who knew the requirements
of the daily Press.</p>

<p>'It's made,' said Wise Symon.</p>

<p>Mr. Borthwick lived with two servants on the third floor of a big block of
flats, but Mr. Borthwick was not at home. The housekeeper suggested that he
might be found at his club.</p>

<p>'Let's try the bank,' said Wise Symon. 'He may be casting up his
accounts.'</p>

<p>The bank was dark and silent.</p>

<p>'If you will condone the offence,' said Wise Symon, producing a bunch of
keys from his pocket, 'we will do a little burglary.'</p>

<p>'Where did you get those keys?' demanded the detective chief.</p>

<p>'I smouched 'em when you weren't looking. They were part of Hopper's
effects. Ah. here's the key!'</p>

<p>The door swung open noiselessly.</p>

<p>'Have you got an electric lamp?' whispered Symon.</p>

<p>'I don't like this,' growled the other, but produced the lamp.</p>

<p>They stepped into the dark passage and closed the door behind them. It ran
parallel with the depth of the outer office. On the right was a stairway
leading to the upper portion of the premises and presumably to Hopper's
sleeping apartments. At the end was another door, which was only opened after
almost every key on the bunch had been tried. They now found themselves in the
outer office itself, facing Mr. Borthwick's private office.</p>

<p>Wise Symon touched his companion's arm and pointed. A thin line of light
showed beneath the door. He stepped forward on tiptoe, turned the handle
cautiously, and threw the door open.</p>

<p>Mr. Borthwick was sitting at the desk, his massive head on his hand,
examining a small ledger. Behind him the steel door leading to the vaults of
the bank was slightly ajar. At the first sound he leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>'Put that gun down. Borthwick!' said Wise Symon sharply. 'Put it down or
I'll kill you a damn sight quicker than you killed Hopper.'</p>

<p>The old man was speechless. No longer benevolent was the light that shone
in his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, but there came an interruption. The
door leading to the bank vault opened slowly and there cringed into the room a
pallid, bearded figure, with shaking hands and bloodshot eyes, blinking from
one to the other.</p>

<p>'Mr. Borthwick,' he piped pitifully, 'Mr. Borthwick, you're quite mistaken.
Won't you let me explain? I did promise Hopper £10,000 if he let me loose. I
wrote it on one of the cheques and passed it through the bars, but I wasn't
going to betray you. Mr. Borthwick,' he sobbed, 'I swear to God I wasn't going
to do you any harm.'</p>

<p>'Siddon,' said Wise Symon, 'this is Mr. Harrigay Ford, who, unless I am
greatly mistaken, has been a prisoner in the vaults of this bank ever since he
threatened to take his account elsewhere.'</p>
<br>


<p class="first">
'Old Borthwick was a gambler.' said Wise Symon to his chief in the early
hours of the morning when the presses of the <I>Telephone Herald</I> were
roaring with a note, as it seemed, of exultation at the ingenuity and
enterprise of the staff. 'He has always been a speculator, and when Ford
threatened to take his account away he knew he would be ruined. He got Ford
when he was doped and put him in the vault. Don't you realise that all banks
are built so that they make ideal prisons? The caretaker had to be in the
secret&mdash;nobody else visited the vault. So the caretaker had to be paid.
Ford was
supplied with food, a chequebook, and a pen, and every time Borthwick's
accounts wanted balancing he had to draw the cheque or suffer&mdash;the old
man was
as strong as a horse in spite of his age. I shouldn't think that Hopper had any
communication with the prisoner, but apparently Ford tried to bribe him to
secure his release, writing the sum he was willing to pay on the back of a
cheque and slipping it into the caretaker's hand when the old man wasn't
looking. Borthwick must have found this out. He was alarmed by my visit, but
probably more alarmed by Hopper's attitude.'</p>

<p>'But how did you guess?'</p>

<p>'I didn't guess, I knew. The slip of paper found on Hopper's body inscribed
£10,000 was written on cheque No. 1796, the very next to that which the old man
told me had been drawn in Australia, apparently weeks before.'</p>

<p>'You're a real Wise Symon,' said the editor admiringly.</p>

<p>'Has anybody ever honestly doubted it?' said Mr. Symon.</p>
