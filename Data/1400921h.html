  <p class="first">ISOLATED by some accident of time and tide from the rushing
  currents of the vast ocean that is New York, a certain drab block on Fourth
  Avenue is a doldrum of stagnation. Here Time moves slowly, if at all. Here
  dust stirred up in busier streets sifts down to film sidewalk cases that
  wistfully offer tattered books to browsers who look but seldom buy. Here
  gray, drowsy men are content to dawdle undisturbed in their grimy shops that
  are derelict as the rotting wrecks in Neptune's graveyard of forgotten
  ships.</p>

  <p>Life moves slowly in this back-eddy of the seething metropolis, and Death
  seems to have passed it by&mdash;except in one dingy cubicle&mdash;and there
  Death is a livid, almost tangible presence.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane's Second-Hand Bookstore is no different, even to the most
  observant eye, from other berths of this port of missing books. Most
  deliberately it is no different in appearance from the shop of Radley Ransom
  on its left or that of Lazare Garreau on its right. But the shadows that lie
  heavily between its high stacks of dogeared volumes are the shadows of fear,
  and the quiet that broods in its dimness is the hush of an omnipresent
  dread.</p>

  <p>One late afternoon Ford Duane stood, gawky and stooped, in the door of his
  shop. His shabby alpaca smock hung loosely on his lank frame, so that it
  seemed painfully, almost cadaverously thin, and heavy grooves were graven
  deep into his gaunt, expressionless countenance.</p>

  <p>Duane's face was evasively youthful for this abode of the aged and weary.
  Yet his eyelids were slitted as though the effort to raise them were too
  great and every line of him drooped with bone weariness... Concealed by the
  lackadaisical folds of his gray apparel there was slender
  strength&mdash;muscles like steel springs, hairtrigger nerves that could
  instantaneously command those muscles to lightning-like action. Behind those
  lowered lids, eyes of the keenest blue were eternally restless, eternally
  watchful. That leashed power, that unrelenting vigilance, was the price of
  Ford Duane's safety&mdash;and the safety of a nation!</p>

  <p>Hunter and hunted, stalker and stalked, Duane was far more than he seemed.
  There was a price on his head in more than one chancellery, but in a certain
  secret room in the nation's capital he was a number, and a name quite
  different from that which the tarnished letters on the streaked plate glass
  above him spelled out.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane turned smoothly to a whistle that lilted along the street. His
  furtive look flicked to the whistler, and a muscle that had twitched along
  the ridge of his sharp jaw relaxed. It was only a grimy-faced boy in the dark
  blue of a telegraph company who was approaching.</p>

  <p>The messenger-boy glanced at a sheaf of white and blue envelopes in his
  hand, glanced up at Duane's window. Stopped.</p>

  <p>"Yuh Ford Duane?" the youngster asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm Duane."</p>

  <p>"Postal&mdash;ah&mdash;Telegraph. Got a message fer yuh.
  Postal&mdash;ah&mdash;Telegraph."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE phrasing was awkward. The pause between the two words of
  the name was awkward... A pulse pumped in Ford Duane's wrist.</p>

  <p>"All right. Let me have it." There was nothing in the bookman's voice to
  betray his sudden agitation. But behind his untroubled brow his thoughts were
  whirring. <i>P</i>ostal&mdash;<i>a</i>h&mdash;<i>T</i>elegraph. It had been
  repeated, making three words out of what should have been two. Three words
  whose initials were, P-A-T!</p>

  <p>"Sign here."</p>

  <p>Duane signed the book P-A-T. Those initial letters were a signal. Now and
  again they had been cryptically embodied in a peddler's cry, a street
  singer's appeal, a society dame's querulous berating of her chauffeur. They
  meant something to Ford Duane. They meant action, and danger... Death! Surely
  for someone. Perhaps&mdash;for him!</p>

  <p>"Here's yuhr telegram." The boy handed it over, turned away.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Duane's command had halted him. "Wait a minute." The book vendor
  was fumbling in his pocket for a tip, but his hand stayed there. There was
  startlement in the gray eyes that had sought his face. A sudden darkening in
  them. Of fear? No. Not fear, but some other obscure emotion. A lock of hair
  protruding from under the blue, red-braided cap was tawny.</p>

  <p><i>"Flower!"</i> Ford Duane's exclamation was low-toned as he put a coin
  in an extended palm that was too white, too soft to be an urchin's. "Flower!
  I told you to get out of the game. It's too dangerous for a..."</p>

  <p>"T'anks!" The messenger had whirled again, and was striding down the
  street. Duane dared not run after her...</p>

  <p>There is one army in which a woman can serve as well as a man. It is a
  wraithlike army that secretly wages a war that never ends; a war of
  underground strategy; of silent, unsung heroisms; of trickery and deceit; in
  which triumphs go unrewarded and the participants fail only once.</p>

  <p>Because they must remain unknown to their antagonists, the soldiers of
  that secret army must be unknown to one another. That is the rule of the
  game. But they are human, nevertheless, and sometimes a mask slips, a
  disguise is penetrated. They are human, and though it is far better that they
  should not, they sometimes have human emotions.</p>

  <p>The telegram was clutched in Ford Duane's right hand. His left pressed
  furtively against the breast pocket of his smock. Something crackled under
  that pressure, as dried petals crackle, and a vague fragrance came from it,
  the perfume of a russet rose. Weeks before that rose had been a wordless
  message from a comrade whose name he did not even know&mdash;except that he
  called her Flower!</p>

  <p>They are very human, the men and women who are phantom fighters in a
  phantom war.</p>

  <p>"Bad news, Duane?" a voice asked, rustling and sere as dead leaves. Radley
  Ransom peered at him out of rheumy eyes. The old man had shuffled over from
  his own stall. White-bearded and senile, the only emotion left to him was
  curiosity. "Taint often any of us gets a telegram."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, haven't read it yet." Ford ripped open the blue and white
  envelope, pulled out the sheet it contained. "No. Looks like a business
  message. I've been doing a little special trading lately for a couple of
  collectors. This is from one of them."</p>

  <p>Ransom made shift to get a view of the telegram. "Sure is a long one," he
  mumbled, and doddered away. Time was, he ruminated, when he too had hopes of
  building up a trade among bibliophiles. There was money in it.</p>

  <p>Duane's thin lips were touched by the hint of a grim smile. This was a
  simple code, and effective because it was simple. Who would suspect the
  garrulous communication to be other than it seemed?</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">ADAMS SAYS THACKERAY ROMANCES OFFERED FOR SALE PROVIDED

  <p class="telegram">PAYTON A. THOMPSON</p><br>

  <p>He read it again. Then his slender, strong fingers crumpled it and tossed
  it into the gutter. If there were, somewhere unseen, a stealthy observer
  spying upon him that gesture would convince him of the utter unimportance of
  the paper.</p>

  <p>The second reading had told Duane all he need know. Disregarding the
  punctuation, the "stops", he had read only the first letters of each word of
  the message:</p>

  <p class="telegram">ASTROFSPOTTEDATFOURTWOTENAVEEINVESTIGATEPAT</p>

  <p class="first">and then had separated them into new words:</p>

  <p class="telegram">ASTROF SPOTTED AT FOUR-TWO-TEN AVE E. INVESTIGATE.
  PAT.</p>

  <p>Ford Duane straightened a pile of coverless <i>National Geographic
  Magazines</i> in a box trestled in front of his store, adjusted a
  jagged-edged cardboard sign that said; YOUR CHOICE, FIVE CENTS. A vagrant
  breeze flapped pages of one of the magazines, a title struck at
  him&mdash;"Lemuria: The Friendly Land."</p>

  <p>Duane's thin lips twitched with secret, grim amusement. Yes, they were
  very friendly to tourists, the Orientals of Lemuria. They showed visitors
  their miniature gardens, their quaint houses, and smilingly sold them tawdry
  gimcracks in their picturesque bazaars. But in carefully guarded harbors were
  shipyards seething with activity. In mountain fortresses death lurked for
  those who dared to penetrate cuff-walled plateaus covered by acre upon acre
  of factories where steel was being fashioned into cannon, brass into shells,
  and fuming acids with bales of fleecy cotton made into merchandise of Hell.
  These things the tourists did not see.</p>

  <p>Friendly, were they, the Lemurians? Smilingly they looked at Occidental
  Nations riven by dissension, weakened by long poverty, glaring at each other
  with hatred. Only America was still strong in the Western World. Only America
  still stood in the way of the scheme for terrestrial empire that brooded
  behind those smiling, saffron faces.</p>

  <p>Still smiling, Lemurian fishermen cast their seines, <i>and their sounding
  lines,</i> off America's coast. Still smiling, Lemurian students conned books
  in American universities, and conned the American mind. Lemurian artisans
  labored in America's factories, attended meetings of workers, permeated every
  tiny vein and pulsing artery of American life. Smilingly, always smilingly,
  they sought out the secret of American strength&mdash;and the vulnerable spot
  every strength must possess.</p>

  <p>So vast a network of espionage must have a single head. That head was the
  man known in the hidden chronicles of the secret war as Konyl Astrof. And if
  Astrof was in America, the Lemurians had found the weakness they sought.
  Their smiles were tightening into snarling, menacing grins!</p>

  <p>The blue and white paper already mucked by the mire of the Fourth Avenue
  gutter put it squarely up to Ford Duane to wipe those grins from the saffron
  countenances of the Lemurian War Lords!</p>

  <p>Gray dusk settled on Fourth Avenue from a leaden sky. "I'm shutting up
  early, Radley," Duane called to his ancient neighbor. "I'll have to get busy
  if I want to earn that commission. Everhard is a tough man to buck."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE street designated by the name of Avenue E is only two
  blocks long, cutting across the East River shore of Manhattan Island. Some
  decades-long litigation, some defect in title, dragging a weary way through
  weary courts, have kept it in a state of arrested development; so that the
  brick warehouses lining it are unoccupied, their windows boarded up, their
  doors fastened by rusty padlocks.</p>

  <p>Forty-two-ten Avenue E was cloaked in the fog that rolled oilily up from
  the River to make a dark, blind gut of the forgotten thoroughfare. The old
  warehouse might have been a tomb in some cemetery of giants for all the
  animation that was apparent behind its slime-sweating front.</p>

  <p>One by one, three vague forms slid through the fog, seeming almost a part
  of it, so little sound did their movements make. One by one they vanished
  into the gloom-shrouded embrasure of forty-two-ten's high, unlighted
  portal.</p>

  <p>No key could possibly have turned in the rusted padlock holding the great
  door closed. But there was a furtive scrape of wood on wood. Momentarily an
  oblong showed, blacker against the vertical black. And once more the niche
  was empty, and silent.</p>

  <p>Slithering footsteps whispered within the stygian vastness of the ancient
  warehouse. A door softly shut. The sounds of furtive movement descended.
  Another door opened and shut. The darkness was close, and heavy with fungoid
  damp, with the fetid miasma of a catacomb. Breaths hissed. A scratch rasped
  the silence.</p>

  <p>A match flame spurted into being, low down. A lamp wick was edged with red
  glow, blossomed into steady light. The luminescence filled a small windowless
  vault and cast monstrous, brooding shadows up against the ceiling. The bare
  earthen floor was greasy and black with the seepage from the sewers that lay
  in their long graves close against the structure's foundations.</p>

  <p>The man who had lit the lamp on the floor straightened. His shadow heaved
  above him, like some gargantuan, black creature of doom to whom light was a
  curse.</p>

  <p>His mask was a wide, black bar across his face, but the ponderous, blunt
  jaw it did not hide; the square-sided, bony cheeks were eloquent of power, of
  an intellectual strength whose physical counterpart was manifest in his bull
  shoulders and columnar massiveness of frame. His mouth was thick-lipped,
  sensuous&mdash;sadistic.</p>

  <p>The diminutive stature of the masked couple whom he confronted contrasted
  grotesquely with his bulk. A door of unpainted wood newly set into the wall
  framed them; and they were wiry as weasels, shrewd, cruel. A saffron tinge
  overlay what little of their skin that was exposed. Their pointed fingernails
  were tainted with a pallid blue cast. Those nails were like talons, like
  claws fashioned to tear quivering flesh.</p>

  <p>"You are certain that you were unobserved coming here?" The big man held
  his voice low, but it boomed in the confined space. "Absolutely
  certain?"</p><br>

  <p class="first">TWO yellow heads bobbed in assent as inhaled breath hissed
  between teeth startlingly white.</p>

  <p>"Good. This is the last time I shall use this rendezvous. It would have
  been unfortunate had some carelessness of yours betrayed it. Unfortunate for
  you." Even under the saffron complexion of his hearers a sharp paleness was
  visible, a pallor of fear at the reptilian menace chilling the measured
  statement.</p>

  <p>"The reports that have been brought here to me have been satisfactory. The
  transcontinental railroads have been mined, our men are posted at the
  strategic points to cut all telephone and telegraph cables, the
  static-producing radio stations are set up and ready to blanket the air. Our
  transport fleets are within striking distance of the American Coast. It is
  you two who will flash the signal that will disrupt the American
  communications and give our forces time to do their part. You will do that at
  midnight, Eastern Standard Time, tomorrow. At midnight. Do not fail. With
  five uninterrupted hours in which to work, the Lemurian armies will be firmly
  entrenched at a dozen strategic points on the continent, and the flag of the
  Setting Moon will never be dislodged from its soil.</p>

  <p>"Go now, and do not fail. For the Emperor."</p>

  <p>"For the Emperor," the Lemurians intoned, making the curious gesture that
  from time immemorial has signified utter abasement, utter devotion to their
  ruler who, legend says, has descended straight from the God of the Night.
  They turned...</p>

  <p>Before they could reach the door it flew open. For an instant the aperture
  was a blank, staring orifice of black threat, and then a grisly apparition
  materialized within it.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast, my friends," a sepulchral voice intoned. "Not so fast."</p>

  <p>That voice was muffled by a gray mask that made the speaker faceless under
  a gray mask save for narrow slits through which blue menace glittered.
  Swirling black draperies cloaked the immensely tall figure, making it
  shapeless, ominous. But that from which the Lemurians fell back in deathly
  terror, that which froze their leader to a motionless statue of
  dismay&mdash;was the hand from which jutted a thick-barreled pistol.</p>

  <p>That hand was black as midnight, black as the lustreless draperies from
  which it protruded, except for one grim, blood-red finger that curled about
  the trigger.</p>

  <p>A gasp from the big man broke the brittle silence. "Red Finger! <i>Bozhe
  moy!</i> Red... Finger!"</p>

  <p>The face of him who stood in the doorway could not be seen, but he seemed
  to smile, forebodingly. "Red Finger, Astrof," the toneless voice murmured.
  "You should have remembered me when you planned to take over the United
  States."</p>

  <p>Astrof forced a smile to his colorless lips, a smile that had no humor.
  "How could I forget, Red Finger? One after another you have ended the careers
  of the best spies the world has ever known. One after another they have
  failed, and when the question was asked&mdash;why?&mdash;the answer always
  came whispered back, Red Finger. When I worked for the Tsar, you defeated me.
  When I moved on to espionage service of one, then of another nation, always
  you defeated me. Your name is the dread and the despair of all international
  intrigue. I should not have forgotten you when I advised my latest employers
  that I could conquer America. <i>And I did not!"</i></p>

  <p>The last words snapped like a whip, and like a whip a noose lashed down
  over Red Finger's head from behind, jerked taut to clamp his arms to his
  sides. Yellow fingers flailed to smash the thick-barreled gun from the
  black-gloved hand with the carmine forefinger. Diminutive Lemurians, three of them,
  swarmed over the counter-spy, bringing him down.</p>

  <p>Astrof's big-chested laugh roared out, echoing in the gloomy depths of the
  old warehouse. "I did not forget you, Red Finger," he chuckled when that
  laugh ended. "I thought very carefully about you. And&mdash;cleverly. No, my
  friend? For years I have studied tales that were whispered about you. I
  learned that only one person knew who you were when you doffed that somewhat
  spectacular masquerade of yours, the little man in the secret room in
  Washington. I learned that you were only called upon for action when the most
  feared of international spies were at work.</p>

  <p>"Many men have gone after you and failed. I decided that I should make you
  come after me. So, my friend, I carefully allowed myself to be discovered
  entering this place. Who greater than Astrof could Red Finger send to defeat?
  And I made a little speech that would be sure to bring you into the open,
  thinking that you must act at once to save that pig's country of yours from
  disaster. Then&mdash;my men who were hidden took you unawares."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?" Red Finger's captors no longer held
  him. But they had wrapped the rope around him so that only his head protruded
  from its coils, like the head of a chrysalis emerging from its cocoon.</p>

  <p>"Do? Start now to build the set-up you heard me describe. But first," the
  chuckling triumph was gone from Astrof's speech, "so that I may be certain of
  its success, I shall&mdash;kill you!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">EVEN that did not break the American's stoic calm. "It was
  bound to come sooner or later. You might as well be the one."</p>

  <p>The Russian's big hands fisted, opened. Closed again. "Scheming to the
  last, Red Finger? Thinking that when your body, knifed, shot, drowned, is
  found, the hounds of your law will be let loose on Astrof. And though he is
  too clever to be caught he will be harried, his work rendered impossible. But
  you do not know how cunning is the man who has at last brought you low." He
  snapped an unintelligible word in Lemurian.</p>

  <p>The little yellow men went out. Red Finger heard their small feet patter
  away through the darkness. He was alone with his enemy. "Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Astrof stared at him, a slow, foreboding smile creeping across his heavy
  face. A long moment of silence dragged. Then, "Listen," he said.
  "Listen."</p>

  <p>Silence again. Silence that was broken by the rapid tick, tick; tick, tick
  of a clock. It was somewhere in this room. Somewhere in the black shadows
  under its vaulted ceiling. Tick, tick; tick, tick.</p>

  <p>"You hear it, Red Finger? One of my colleagues has switched on an infernal
  machine, a bomb, set within a recess where the keystones of these arches
  join. It will explode in ten minutes. You see, my friend, this warehouse is
  supported on a series of arches like these, each crossed, two holding up the
  others. When one pair falls they all fall, and the building will fall. When
  Red Finger is found, if ever he will be, the little man in the room at
  Washington will be sorry, very sorry, that he sent his ace into an empty
  building where no one was, and that his ace was caught by the collapse of
  that building.</p>

  <p>"And now, <i>au revoir.</i> I will see you again&mdash;in that Hell where
  all spies go."</p>

  <p>Astrof launched into movement, quicker than his huge body seemed capable
  of. He stooped, snatched up a loose end of the rope that bound Red Finger,
  lurched out of the exit. The door slammed shut, pounding solidly into its
  jamb. The bound man heard a bar scrape down across it on the other side,
  another! He saw that the rope the spy-master had taken with him passed
  through an angled nick that had been cut in the door's edge.</p>

  <p>And then the rope was snaking through that hole. It tightened, pulled at
  him. It rolled him over and over, unwinding from his body. It was gone.</p>

  <p>Battered, dizzy from the giddy revolutions, Red Finger lay half-dazed
  against the door. Astrof was not to be caught napping. He had taken the rope
  with him so that when Red Finger's smashed corpse was found in the debris of
  a structure fallen by its own weight, no suspicion of any human agency in his
  death would arise in the minds of his finders.</p>

  <p>Tick, tick; tick, tick.</p>

  <p>The rapid little clicking sounds pattered against the welter in the
  counterspy's throbbing brain. Tick, tick; tick, tick. Each tiny click
  clipping a half-second from his life.</p>

  <p><i>No!</i> Realization exploded him to his feet. His work was not ended,
  could not be ended. Astrof was free, to consummate his plans for America's
  destruction. Astrof was free, and the shrewd saboteur himself had said that
  Red Finger was the only one who could defeat him. Red Finger could not die.
  Red Finger dared not die.</p>

  <p>Tick, tick; tick, tick. The Lemurians had searched him as they bound him,
  had left him nothing, absolutely nothing with which to break out of here. He
  hurled himself at the mocking, resinous wood of the door. It hurled him back,
  staunch, immovable. It was inches thick. The bars that Astrof had let down
  across it made it a part of the wall itself. Till that wall fell Red Finger's
  cell was inescapable. It would fall soon enough, but that would be too
  late.</p>

  <p>Tick, tick; tick, tick. How much time had passed? How much time was there
  still to go?</p>

  <p>The bomb was up there, where the arches joined in a point. If he could
  reach it. If he could only reach it. There was nothing to stand upon. The
  walls were rough, grooved where powdered mortar had sifted out from between
  the old bricks. Red Finger ripped off his gloves, dug frantic finger nails
  into one such groove. A brick grated, slid out. He shoved a toe into the
  niche it left, dug out another.</p>

  <p>Tick, tick; tick, tick.</p>

  <p>He was halfway up the wall. It curved out and upward. He gained a foot,
  another foot. Reached a shaking hand to pry at a new brick...</p>

  <p>And fell, pounding hard into the black muck that floored this lethal
  chamber! He was no fly. He had no suckers on his feet, his hands, with which
  to cling upside down to a ceiling that otherwise gave no hold. He rolled,
  scrambled to hands and knees. Lifted erect. Time must be almost up. He would
  meet death upright.</p>

  <p>Tick, tick; tick, trsssssk. The sound was changing. It was blurring,
  rasping. Was the ten minutes up?</p>

  <p>That rasping sound was not from above. It was from outside the door. It
  was the scrape of the bars against the door, that was moving&mdash;swinging
  outward!</p>

  <p>The swinging door uncovered a slim, boyish form... in the blue uniform of
  a telegraph messenger.</p>

  <p><i>"Flower!"</i> Red Finger ejaculated, and literally hurled himself
  toward her. "Flower! Come on. Run. Run!"</p>

  <p>"They're gone! It's all..."</p>

  <p>He reached her, swept her up in his arms, not pausing in his stride as he
  hurtled toward the stairs down which he had crept, thinking himself
  unobserved. "All right be damned," he grunted. "The building's coming down."
  He was flying up those stairs, winged by a terror that somehow had redoubled
  with the presence of the girl. But even in his terrible haste, his terrible
  fear, he knew that the body in his arms was warm, and soft, and very dear.
  "They set a bomb and it may go off at any moment."</p><br>

  <p class="first">A GASP answered him, and the girl he knew as Flower
  shuddered against him. He had reached the upper floor, was leaping, vaulting
  in desperate effort to attain the rear window he had jimmied to gain
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here? How on earth did you find me?" Red Finger asked the
  question, not knowing if death would let her answer him.</p>

  <p>"I read the telegram, hid near here. I was&mdash;afraid&mdash;for
  you."</p>

  <p>"You read..." Here was the window! He thrust her through it, vaulted out:
  She was a slim, phantom figure running alongside him through the dark alley.
  She was&mdash;They were out in the street. Red Finger twisted to a shadowy,
  cubical bulk in the fog, far down the block. An auto. He sprinted toward
  it.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he gritted. "Astrof would wait to laugh when the building
  went down. That's how he's built."</p>

  <p>A crash, tumultuous, earth-shaking, obliterated speech. Dust rolled around
  him. Choking, spluttering, he lunged out of the cloud, groping toward the
  auto. A pallid oval was a face goggling out of a black roadster's front seat,
  ten feet away.</p>

  <p>"Astrof!" Red Finger yelled.</p>

  <p>Orange-red flame jetted at him. Leaden spray from a blazing gun. Red
  Finger left the ground in a tremendous leap. His heels pounded on a moving
  runningboard. He lay across the roadster's half-door and his fingers clutched
  the gun. Astrof had not time to fire again, wrenched it out of the hand that
  held it.</p>

  <p>Astrof was strong, powerful. But Hercules himself could not have resisted
  the lethal fury that inflamed Red Finger.</p>

  <p>The gun crashed against Konyl Astrof's temple. The Russian's gigantic bulk
  slumped unconscious in the driver's seat. A police whistle shrilled,
  far-off. Red Finger grabbed the steering wheel of the roadster, which in the
  lightning instant of that brief fight had been slowly gathering speed,
  twirled it. The car made a half circle in the roadway. Red Finger pushed down
  on a lax knee. The car leaped into sudden speed. At the final moment the
  counter-spy leaped from its running board and the black car crashed
  thunderously into the huge pile of shattered brick on which the dust raised
  by its collapse had not yet started to settle.</p>

  <p>The policeman, coming on the run around the corner, saw a tall, slender
  man staring at the piled ruins of a condemned warehouse that had fallen at
  last and at the mangled wreck of a roadster that had smashed into it. "God,"
  Ford Duane jerked out as the patrolman came up. "The damn fool. He almost
  dipped me, speeding a mile a minute. He must have been drunk, or crazy."</p>

  <p>"Drunk, I guess." The officer grunted, fighting off the shock of what he
  saw with a mechanical functioning of routine. "Comin' from some damn
  masquerade, mebbe. Looka what fell out o' the car." He held out black, torn
  fabric to Duane. "Musta been dressed up like a Ku Klux Klanner or
  somethin'...." He broke off. Then&mdash;"Godfrey! I wunner if anyone was
  caught under there. I got to phone headquarters." He lumbered off.</p>

  <p>Was anyone else caught under there? Was anyone...? The blood in Ford
  Duane's veins was suddenly cold. Had <i>she</i> won free of the falling
  brick? There was no living soul, beside himself and the flatfoot in the
  street...</p>

  <p>And then the forefront of a crowd surged around the corner. Before he was
  asked what he had been doing in deserted Avenue E, Fort Duane must slip away.
  He reeled as he walked, as though he were half-dazed. As though the fog had
  seeped into his bones with the chill of death.</p><br>

  <p class="first">RADLEY RANSOM was just dragging his sidewalk stands into his
  store for the night as Ford Duane passed him. "Oh, Duane," he called.</p>

  <p>"Yes." The younger man's voice was toneless, tortured. "What is it,
  Ransom?"</p>

  <p>"This telegram came for you 'bout ten minutes ago. I signed for it."</p>

  <p>Duane snatched the envelope from him, ripped it open with shaking fingers.
  It said:</p>
