<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THERE is nothing to distinguish Duane's
Second-hand Bookstore from the other shops of its kind that line
lower Fourth Avenue with their decrepit outside-boxes of tattered
volumes in front of their dark bookstacks within. Its
signs&mdash;"This Box 15¢ Each"; "Choice Selections, 50¢"&mdash;are
just as rain-streaked and illegible, its grimed plate-glass just as
forlorn. As pathetic, too, the men and women with worn faces and
threadbare garments who dare its gloomy precincts to browse along
those musty shelves.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything to set him apart from the other
storekeepers the long-faced, alpaca-coated man who inhabits its
depths&mdash;as dusty-seeming and inconspicious as his
stock-in-a-very-paltry-trade, except that he appears a bit younger
than the others, and that his very blue eyes are continually moving
and very watchful.</p>

<p>And yet, death and the fear of death are a living presence in
that drab shop.</p>

<p>The shadows that lie in black pools on the unpainted floor might
well be the brooding shadows of world-events stirring heavily in
the womb of time; the dirt-streaked curtains at the rear that part
occasionally to show a narrow camp-cot, a wooden chair, and a
two-burner gas-plate on an upended box, might be the veil that
hides a nation's fate. For Ford Duane is not quite what he seems,
though his very existence depends on the maintenance of his
identity as a dreamy, cobweb-brained sexton of a Tomb of Defunct
Books.</p>

<p>Surely the bent old man, in a frock coat of rusty black, and
high, clean stock over which his grayish chin folds and quivers,
who hugs a dog-eared volume in his gaunt fingers, cannot have
picked this particular doorway in which to stand timorously for any
other cause but chance. He had tottered slowly down the long block,
pausing momentarily at each cluttered entrance, palpably working up
courage to pass through one of them. His bleared old eyes blink and
peer nearsightedly at Duane as he silently appears from the shadows
almost as though one of them had come to life.</p>

<p>The ancient gulps. "I&mdash;I&mdash;You buy old books, do you
not?" he quavers.</p>

<p>A secret smile flickers around the other's suprisingly firm,
determined mouth. "Occasionally," he responds, "Though I prefer to
sell them. What have you there?"</p>

<p>"A Petronius, printed by Arden and bound by Trant." He says it
proudly, and the hearer's dark eyebrows arch as if in appreciation,
but, curiously enough, there was never any such printer as Arden
nor any binder as Trant. Is Ford Duane a neophyte then, to be
impressed by unctuously mouthed but counterfeit names? Is the
would-be seller a fraud? Perhaps. And then again...</p>

<p>"Let me see it." Duane takes the book from the reluctant hand of
the old man, riffles its yellow pages. The leather of its binding
smears his fingers with a fine brown dust. "Yes," he says at last.
"It is a fine specimen, but I can only offer you two dollars for
it."</p>

<p>"Two dollars! It cost me twenty-five!" And so starts a leisurely
chaffering on the doorstep, where any passerby can hear. And why
not? They have nothing to hide, those two...</p>

<p>Nothing?</p>

<p>The bargaining is over at last, the book is Duane's. As he
counts the money into a palsied palm, he watches the old man falter
down the street, vanishing around the nearest corner. Then he turns
back into his shop.</p>

<p>Those extraordinarily keen eyes of his flick over the two or
three idlers as he moves slowly toward the rear. His thin, aquiline
face is impassive, but an exceedingly close observer might notice
that a tiny muscle is twitching in his smooth cheek. He goes
through the curtain that ineffectually conceals his living quarters
from the store proper and it drops behind him. Momentarily, at
least, he is concealed from those outside. He rests a hand on a
breast-high book-filled shelf; there is a flicker of
movement&mdash;and he has vanished!</p>
<br>

<p class="first">BEHIND those shelves that have swung out and back
on oiled hinges so quickly, Ford Duane is no longer impassive. By
the light of a small bulb high up in the ceiling his face is alive
and his eyes glow with excitement.</p>

<p>The book he has just purchased is still in his hand, he lays it
on a shelf that is attached to the inner wall, opens it to the
first blank flyleaf. Seating himself on a high stool, he pulls out
a drawer beneath the shelf, fumbles out of it a tiny hooded lamp
that he sets next to the leather covered Petronius. He plugs the
short cord attached into a socket before him, reaches to a handy
switch.</p>

<p><i>Click!</i> The ceiling bulb goes out and velvety,
impenetrable darkness invades the cubicle. <i>Click!</i> That was
the sound of another switch, but the blackness remains, so thick as
to be almost tangible. There must be something wrong with the
wiring of the little lamp.</p>

<p>No! There, just where the book must be, tiny wriggles of light
appear, iridescent tracery of living fire. Indistinct at first
their outlines become clearer. They are letters, words. Exhaled
breath hisses sharply as Ford Duane reads the message that has come
to him thus deviously from an inner, closely-barred and guarded
room in a certain building in faraway Washington.</p>

<p>A solution of aspirin, a ball-pointed pen, were all that were
required to write that invisible communication. A special bulb,
equipped to emit only ultra-violet light was all that was needed to
make it give up its secret.</p>

<p>But a man will die tonight, before Duane can act on the
instructions thus given him. A man will die and horrible death will
hover over hundreds, thousands more. Tomorrow a coded cable will
flash under two oceans and bring consternation into another barred
and guarded room in a chancellery three thousand miles from the one
in Washington...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">A BLACK shade was tightly drawn over the window of
a small room on the twentieth floor of the St. Vincent Hotel. The
towering façade outside this aperture dropped sheer and ledgeless
from its sill. Only a fly could have found hand- or foot-hold, on
that blank wall, and so far did the huge hostelry overtop the
surrounding low roofs that the interior of the chamber could be
observed only from the spidery structure of Brooklyn Bridge, a
quarter-mile away, and then only by a powerful spy-glass.</p>

<p>But the room's occupants seemed to have great need of secrecy,
for its door was locked, not only by its usual bolt but also by a
contrivance that slid between door-edge and jamb and could be
removed without trace. The crevices around the door and its keyhole
were tightly stuffed with cotton batting, and the single light
within was cast by a lamp whose shade was covered with a black
cloth. Its illumination was thrown only downward to the table-top
on which it stood.</p>

<p>The rest of the room, therefore, was in semi-darkness enhanced
somehow by the pale gleam of the bed's coverlet and the darker
shadows of two men seated opposite one another at the table.</p>

<p>Only their hands were clearly visible.</p>

<p>One pair clutched the edge of the small round table. They were
big hands, their joints swollen, the tips and inner surfaces of
their fingers calloused as only long, hard labor can harden a man's
skin. They were weather-tanned, but under the bronze there was a
gray pallor oddly at variance with their evident strength. The
palms were wet with cold sweat.</p>

<p>The owner of these hands, one knew, was under a tremendous
strain, was fighting hard to keep an appearance of steadiness and
calm while he waited for some critical decision to be made by the
other.</p>

<p>The hands of that other, slim and effeminate, conveyed an
impression of wily power, of sure dominance. Their skin was oddly
tinged, the nails filed to queer long points, and at the base of
those nails, crescents of deep blue, strangely exotic.</p>

<p>These hands gripped the margins of the topmost blueprint of a
pile spread over the top of the table. One felt, rather than saw,
that the owner of those hands was intently absorbing every quirk
and angle of the sharply defined white lines that patterned the
cerulean sheet.</p>

<p>Within the circle of illumination there were two other objects,
both close to the hands holding the outspread plan. One was a bulky
package of grimy-edged, rumpled envelopes held by a thick, black
elastic. The other was a bull-nosed automatic, compact and
vicious.</p>

<p>For a while there was no sound in that mysteriously isolated
chamber except the faint rustle of paper and the heavy, tortured
breathing of the man who waited. Then his vis-à-vis spoke. "Yes,"
he muttered, "These are what I wanted, Mister Lassiter. You have
fulfilled your bargain."</p>

<p>"How about your end, then?" Lassiter asked hoarsely. "The
letters&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Are yours," The speaker's hand moved swiftly, yet without
hurry, to the automatic's grip. It lifted the gun and pushed the
bundle of letters across the table with its muzzle. They vanished
in Lassiter's capacious paw, now visibly trembling, "You may assure
the lady her secret is safe."</p>

<p>"Damn it, Odon," There was a wealth of bitterness in the
response, "that's the only way you'd have ever gotten those plans
of the subway ventilating system from me. If they'd been my own
letters I'd have told you where to go, but I couldn't let hers get
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The person who would have been so very interested in reading
them. No! We knew that, and used our information." Odon was rolling
the plans up dextrously, though one yellow hand still held the
automatic. "I cannot quite comprehend your Occidental
viewpoint."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't. But I still can't get it through my head why you
went to so much trouble to get them. The principles are common
knowledge, and your engineers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are as good as yours. Yes." Something vaguely mocking had come
into Sato's tone. "Perhaps you might be enlightened if I were to
tell you that I represent not the municipality of our largest city
but&mdash;our War Office."</p>

<p>"What!" Lassiter forgot caution in an astonished shout. "Your
War&mdash;But why&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why should that department be interested in your subway?" A
chair grated as the alien rose. "Simply this, my dear sir. While
our King and your President struggle to reach an approachment on
the difficulties between our nations, we of the military prepare
for the failure of their negotiations. New weapons are being forged
on both sides, new methods of warfare. No longer will the uniformed
forces alone bear the brunt of battle. The new strategy will
consist of striking at the civilian population, and striking first.
Gas and disease germs, will be munitions of the next war, their
swift dissemination will constitute its tactics. With these maps we
shall know just where to place our gas bombs, just where to release
our death-dealing microbes so that they may spread through New York
with the greatest rapidity. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"You dog!"</i> Lassiter's chair crashed to the floor as he
leaped to his feet, the table skidded sideways as he dove past it,
his big hands fisted and flailing. <i>"You yellow dog!"</i> But the
other's ready gun cracked, its sound thundering here but inaudible
outside the muffled room.</p>

<p>A sudden blue hole appeared in the engineer's right temple. Odon
slid aside, catlike, watched Lassiter plunge past him and thud
blindly against the wall. The big man clawed at the plaster; a
sound burbled from his throat, something between a groan and a
shriek. Then life was out of him and he had collapsed, a shapeless,
sprawling heap on the dull maroon carpeting. Where the back of his
head lay, a darker pool spread, seeped into the thick pile.</p>

<p>Odon stood motionless for a moment, the faintest of smiles
twisting his thin lips with cold cruelty. "So to the rest of his
nation when the day comes," he muttered in his own language. "And
may it dawn soon."</p>

<p>He turned back to the table, put his murder-weapon down, and
lifted the blueprint roll to stow it in a cunningly-contrived
pocket of his dark jacket. "But I must rid myself of the weakness
that urged me to taunt him with the fate awaiting his countrymen
before I stilled his tongue forever."</p>

<p>His long fingers sought the light chain, jerked it. Blackness
swept in to hide murderer and victim under a common pall, but there
was a feel of movement in the room, the slither of the spy's feet
across the rug, the soft rub of cotton against wood as he pulled
the muffling from the door cracks. The metal grated with the wee
sound of well-oiled hinges. A widening gray line showed that the
door was opening to let the spy out into the early-morning corridor
with his burden of horrible death for New York's teeming millions.
His squat form was silhouetted against that dimness, and
then&mdash;<i>against a sudden blaze of white light from a
flashlight lens.</i> "Not so fast, Odon," a cold, hard voice
sounded. "Not so fast."</p>

<p>Low-toned as it was, that voice was keen-edged with threat of
sudden death. The spy saw a gleam of metal next the steadily held
flashlight, the snouting barrel of a revolver. His face froze, was
an expressionless mask. His one hand tightened its hold on the
doorknob till white showed over the muscle at the base of its
thumb, and the other arm moved rigidly away from his side. "Get
back," the newcomer ordered. "Get back into that room."</p>

<p>Odon's three rearward strides were stiff-legged, the newcomer's
advance noiseless as the foreigner's own movements had been. The
door thudded shut once more on taut drama within the drab hotel
room.</p>

<p>The torch-beam, reflected back from palely-enameled walls showed
a vague, black-clothed figure ominously motionless. A gray felt was
pulled low over his forehead, a gray mask hid nose and mouth, only
his narrowed eyes were revealed, their irises a steely blue. Even
the one visible hand that held the butt of his weapon was covered
by a skin-tight glove. That glove pulled the killer's glance to it.
Concealed fear flickered in the oddly-round eyes that betrayed his
race. For, although the rest of the glove was black, the finger
curled around the gun's trigger was a glaring scarlet, as if it had
been dipped in fresh blood.</p>

<p>The spy's lips scarcely moved, but his words were sharp; "The
Red Finger!" was what he said. "But I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That Reinhardt Gans had done for me? So he reported to
<i>his</i> government, and your undercover man there read that
report and sent the news on to you. Whereupon all you spies and
<i>saboteurs</i> breathed a huge sigh of relief. It would be lots
safer now, you thought, to carry on your filthy work in the United
States, each for his own nation, getting ready for the time you all
dream of when America will have to fight the World. But Gans was
mistaken. Too bad, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Odon shrugged, fatalistically. "Very much too bad. We will have
to take steps to repair Gans' mistake."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that you will try. But in the meantime, the
plans, please, for which you killed Lassiter. Put them on that
table." The voice of the Red Finger was suddenly diamond-hard. "And
only the plans. You know well enough that if your hand comes out
with a gun in it my lead will be in your belly before you have a
chance to use it."</p>

<p>The spy's thin lips tightened, a straight gash across his face.
"Take them," he defied, "if you can."</p>

<p>"I'll take them from your dead body, you rat," Red Finger
snapped. "In ten seconds. <i>One&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"No you won't. Look." Odon's stiffly-extended left arm twisted,
so that the palm of its hand was turned toward the other. Held
loosely between thumb-ball and palm a half-inch crystal ball
glittered. "If my hand relaxes this will drop. It contains quintol,
our new explosive, sufficient to blow everything in this room to
atomic fragments. How about it, Red Finger, will you shoot?"</p>

<p>The American paused almost imperceptively. <i>"Two&mdash;,"</i>
his count went on, <i>"Three&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>Odon's queer eyes glowed. "That isn't all," he resumed,
smoothly. "On my body is a thin-walled vial in which is a virulent
culture of the bacilli of the bubonic plague. Shattered by the
explosion, they will scatter&mdash;hundred, thousands in this city
will die horribly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Red Finger had continued steadily through this pronouncement.
<i>"Six&mdash;Seven&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>What manner of man was this? The villain was not bluffing, that
much was certain. Nor could he be bluffed; fanatic eagerness to die
for a cause is a notorious trait of his race. Was the Red Finger
about to sacrifice deliberately hundreds of lives for momentary
triumph, a triumph he himself could not live to savor?
<i>"Eight&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>The contemplated use of the plans he determined would be hardly
more damaging than the result of his shot. <i>"Nine&mdash;"</i> The
American's face was hidden, but Odon's glistening features,
flat-faced, high cheek-boned, was set, fish-scaly beneath its
racial tinge. Eternity quavered in the tiny chamber before the
final numeral crackled on the taut air&mdash;<i>"Ten!"</i></p>

<p>The scarlet finger jerked, a dull plod sounded, a fine mist
sprayed from the American's gun muzzle, a vaporous cloud about the
spy's head. His body twitched, then, was limp. His hand opened. The
ball was dropping&mdash;seemed to hang in space as if reluctant to
loose the cataclysm it enclosed. Lightning quick, Red Finger sprang
forward, his hand darted out, was under the death-sphere! The
fragile crystal nestled into a soft, gloved palm; fingers, one
carmine, closed gingerly about it. Before Odon's flaccid form had
thudded to the floor and settled to its final lax sprawl, the tiny
murder-bomb had vanished into some interstice of the other's
clothing and his revolver was back again in the queerly-marked hand
that had so dexterously averted disaster. Pent breath whistled from
behind the mask, and a muffled voice exclaimed, "Close, by George!
Too damn' close for comfort."</p>

<p>Red Finger allowed himself only that instant's consideration of
what would have followed failure. Then he dropped, lithely as all
his motions were, to his knees beside the still form of his victim.
A moment's fumbling and the long roll of blueprints was transferred
to his own person. The squat automatic was next. Red Finger's hands
trembled as they extracted a thin glass sliver containing a murky
yellow jelly. The clipped letters that had been Lassiter's doom
appeared in the fanlike beam of the counter-spy's torch. Red Finger
held these for a moment, scrutinizing the handwriting. "Marie
Prall," he muttered. "Back at her old tricks. If Lassiter had only
known what I do about her..."</p>

<p>Here lay the real tragedy of this incident in the underground
warfare that wages continually between spy and counter-spy in every
city of the world. The woman for whom the engineer had, with
woefully mistaken chivalry, sacrificed his honor and his life was
an international adventuress, her services at the command of the
highest bidder...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE packet stowed in the capacious recesses of his
garments, Red Finger turned to contemplate Odon. "I'd like to leave
you here," he addressed the still figure grimly, "for the city cops
to find. But your compatriot fireaters would welcome the indictment
of the Baron Odon for murder in America, it might be just the spark
they need to destroy the peace of the world. War's coming sooner or
later, but my jobs to stave it off as long as I can." He shrugged,
"And so, my dear Odon..."</p>

<p>Red Finger lifted himself erect, out of the glow of the torch
that he had laid on the floor. Fabric rustled. A click, and the
lamp came on, the black covering whisked from its shade. A
red-haired youth was visible, freckled-faced and grinning, attired
in the emerald green uniform of the St. Vincent's bellhops. He was
twenty-two or thereabouts, his deceptively slender body concealing
muscles of steel, sinews of whipcord.</p>

<p>He bent again, lifted the squat spy effortlessly, propelled the
unconscious man toward the door. So cleverly was it done that
anyone watching would have sworn that he was a hotel guest who had
drunk not wisely, but too well, who was being guided to his room by
an urchin half-amused, half-bored. And it was thus that the two
progressed through the dim-lit hotel corridor, up a flight of
stairs, and into another room directly above that in which sudden
death had come to one more dupe of the new international
espionage.</p>

<p>Here Odon was tossed, still fully dressed, on a bed. The
putative bellhop did a curious thing then. He got down on the
floor, squirmed under that very bed. In seconds he was out again,
dragging after him a small black box from which two filament-like
wires trailed. On top of the flat contrivance a perforated disk
showed, the earpiece of the device that combined stethoscope and
radio-amplifier to make eavesdropping a facile thing. It was
evident now how he had been able to time his appearance at the
psychological moment.</p>

<p>The youth crossed to a window, pulled it up, and hurled the
contrivance out. The crash of its landing came faintly up to him,
at the end of a twenty-one story fall to hard concrete. There
wouldn't be enough left of the instrument to tell even a
paleontologist what it had been. A last quick glance around to see
if there were any other trace of his long vigil here, then the door
opened and Odon was alone, sleeping stertorously on the bed where
he had been placed. Peculiarly enough, when he woke in the morning
he would find that the room had been registered in his name, the
night's rental paid. And, very wisely, he would slink away into the
vagueness of the furtive land in which he moved, nursing a headache
and the sourness of defeat...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE stoop-shouldered man with a florid face
bleared by bad liquor who shambled unsteadily up a slimy tenement
stoop on Third Avenue resembled neither the dusty Ford Duane who
kept a bookshop on Fourth, just behind, nor the red-haired,
grinning bellhop of the Hotel St. Vincent. He had trouble in
finding his key, this derelict, and a watchful cop had already
started to walk over from across the cartracks before the unpainted
door in the dark vestibule opened. Once in the dimly-lit hallway
reeking with stale smell of yesterday's corned beef and cabbage and
the boiled fish of the week before, the man padded down creaking
wooden steps silently, turned left between white-washed cellar
walls to the shabby room that he rented from a hard-pressed janitor
for a dollar a week. His hand closed on the knob of the skewed
door. A voice said, "Hold it that way, you. Just that way."</p>

<p>The man froze. From the shadows beyond, two forms materialized.
Rough fingers clutched his arms, digging in. "Chees, guys," the bum
whined, "yer shinnying the wrong pole. I ain't got a jit, honest I
ain't."</p>

<p>A guttural chuckle sounded, then a second voice said, thickly,
"You might so well not try that, Chohn O'Hara. Or maybe you like
better that I call you Red Finger? Save your breath for a prayer,
because your tricks are all through."</p>

<p>The Bowery accent dropped from the captive's speech, and he
slumped wearily, the hands holding him apparently his only support.
"Oscar Thorn!" he groaned in defeat, "you&mdash;" His speech choked
suddenly, and he exploded into action. One foot lifted behind,
lashed out and plunked into a soft groin. And Duane's left arm was
free.</p>

<p>His hand flashed to a armpit; a knife gleamed in the dimness. He
whirled, and steely muscles ripped away from the other retaining
clutch. His quick twist showed him a second blade sweeping down at
him. He caught it on his own, parried it with consummate skill. His
opponent, bulky, obese, grunted, dodged back, came in again with
surprising agility. But the American's muscles vibrated like
tempered springs, he flashed in and out again&mdash;and the battle
was over. A heavy form thudded to broken concrete.</p>

<p>Ford Duane whipped to the other man squirming on the basement
floor. A pencil ray shot from a thin torch in his hand, kicked a
brutish face out of the darkness, blue-jowled. He studied that face
for a fleeting instant, came to a quick decision. "You," he
snapped. "Do you know what this is all about?"</p>

<p>The fellow groaned. "Cripes," he blurted. "No! De guy asks me
does I want ter make a sawbuck beatin' a guy up an' I says I'd work
over me own gran'mudder fer dat. Den he brings me in here an' we
lays fer yuh. Gawd, if I'd knowed..."</p>

<p>"All right," Duane interrupted. "That's all I want to know. You
can make that ten yet, and another like it if you will do as I say,
and keep your mouth shut."</p>

<p>"Gawd," the other grunted, unbelievingly. "Ye're an all right
guy at that. What've I got ter do?"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">A HALF-HOUR later there was a new-made grave in
the soft dirt of the tenement's backyard. A bewildered gorilla was
climbing a fence on the way to freedom. Duane watched his shadowy
form disappear in the graying dawn, sighed, and turned wearily back
into the basement.</p>

<p>Once more he was at the door of the cellar room that had once
been a coal-bin. That door thudded softly behind him, and his tired
footsteps seemed recurring echoes of that thud in the windowless
dark. A bedstead creaked, hinges grated softly. And there was no
longer anyone in that other room.</p>

<p>But&mdash;moments later&mdash;Ford Duane was in the concealed
cubicle behind his bookshop. Deft fingers twitched off a wig,
erased skillfully applied paint, removed collodion strips that had
widened nostrils, broadened a thin mouth. A flicker of movement,
and a pajamaed young man moved slowly about his meagre living
quarters, donning the dusty habiliments of a dreaming, other-wordly
bookseller.</p>

<p>No one would wonder if he dozed off at his pamphlet-cluttered
desk out there between the bookshelves. He always looked as if he
were half-asleep anyway.</p>
