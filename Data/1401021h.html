  <h3>AN ADVENTURE BY SEA</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Novel Magazine</i>, February 1916</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>A girl found herself clinging to a piece of wreckage
  in the<br>
  company of the very man who... but read the story and see.</i></small></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">"MARJORIE SWAIN," said her uncle solemnly, "you are going to
  end up by marrying a tramp."</p>

  <p>The girl, sitting on the end of the sofa swinging her foot, laughed.</p>

  <p>Marjorie was difficult. She was very rich, and she was very pretty. She
  was also something of a student of affairs, wrote clever articles in <i>The
  Woman's Age</i>, and was voted eccentric by some, as unwomanly by others, and
  as somewhat unapproachable by most people. Only in books and stories are very
  pretty women, who are also very rich, surrounded by crowds of suitors. Men,
  on the whole, are too vain to crowd round a woman, however much in love, or
  in debt, they may be.</p>

  <p>Uncle Gordon lit a fresh cigar and looked up at her quizzically.</p>

  <p>"Marjie,"he said, "strong-minded young ladies like you end by marrying
  burglars."</p>

  <p>"It must be interesting to marry a burglar&mdash;a nice, brave, Raffles
  person,"she meditated.</p>

  <p>"Hmp!" growled her uncle. "The men who catch women like you aren't either
  nice or brave&mdash;look there!"</p>

  <p>He pointed through the window. A disconsolate newsboy stood in the
  drizzling rain clutching a contents bill:</p>

  <p class="headline">EXTRADITION<br>
  of<br>
  DR. BALSCOMBE.</p>

  <p>She laughed long and gleefully, throwing back her head in an ecstasy of
  bubbling amusement.</p>

  <p>"Oh, uncle! Am I as bad as that&mdash;am I likely to marry Dr. Balscombe?"
  she asked in mock concern.</p>

  <p>"I think nobody is likely to marry the doctor," said her relative, drawing
  steadily at his cigar, "he'll hang&mdash;but he is an instance of the man who
  captivates impossible women&mdash;that is to say, impossible to any other
  kind of man&mdash;by sheer fascination and blarney. If he hadn't killed two
  poor souls for the vulgar insurance money one could have admired his
  gifts."</p>

  <p>She slipped down from the end of the couch and walked to the window.</p>

  <p>"I've read every scrap of the evidence against him," she said, "and if the
  case hadn't ended yesterday I should have delayed leaving for America. Lady
  Grancely wanted me to go to court and see him."</p>

  <p>Gordon Brebent muttered something about "idle, morbid women," but she
  ignored his offensiveness. Uncle Gordon was a dear, but somewhat
  old-fashioned. She walked back to where he sprawled, a model of comfortable
  inelegance, and laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come and see me off to-morrow, and I promise not to talk about the wicked
  doctor," she said.</p>

  <p>Gordon Brebent promised and kept his word.</p>

  <p>If the truth be told, Marjorie did not keep hers, but that was due to a
  locked railway compartment with drawn blinds, and the whisper that ran along
  the boat train that the criminal, whose name had been in everybody's mouth,
  was a fellow-passenger.</p>

  <p>She learnt much from her somewhat stodgy fellows of the first saloon, and
  might have learnt much more but for the fact that, when the <i>Armanic</i>
  was fifty miles from Queenstown, and Marjorie was dozing in her deck chair,
  oblivious of the sudden excitement which thrilled the ship, something struck
  the great liner amidships&mdash;something that exploded with a crash like
  thunder and sent a white, solid column of water leaping into the air before
  it trembled and broke upon the dumb-stricken passengers.</p>

  <p>An hour later she was still without any clear recollection of what had
  happened.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">SHE looked back over the grey hummocks of water and could
  see nothing save the blur of the smoke from a disappearing drifter.
  Instinctively she glanced at her watch. It was three o'clock. So the watch
  <i>was</i> watertight. It was curious that she should remember the shopman's
  guarantee.</p>

  <p>Three o'clock! There were five hours of light left&mdash;at least. What
  time did the sun set? She knitted her pretty forehead trying to remember. She
  usually dressed for dinner at 7.30, and it was not dark then. It was not even
  dark at 8.15 when she left her room. Nine o'clock&mdash;perhaps later. She
  raised her hand very gingerly and pushed back the long, soddened snakes of
  hair from her face. Even the salt water had not dimmed its bronze
  splendour.</p>

  <p>She had need to move cautiously, because she was sitting astride of a
  small but buoyant bale, that bobbed and rose with the sea and threatened to
  capsize if she departed by a single inch breadth from her centre of
  balance.</p>

  <p>The young man who swam by her side had all his eyes for the dim line of
  land to the north. He had a patent life-saving waistcoat about his body, and
  presented a somewhat bloated appearance.</p>

  <p>Now and again he would lift his hand and give the little bale a push in
  the direction he wanted it to take, for he was rudder and motor power to the
  frail raft on which Marjorie Swain sat.</p>

  <p>"It's awfully uncomfortable," she said, with a quick smile in answer to
  something he had said, "but it's ever so much nicer than being drowned."</p>

  <p>She turned as she spoke and nearly overbalanced herself.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" he warned, and shot up his hand to steady her. "I guess you'd
  better take your skirt off, my friend&mdash;if it is possible."</p>

  <p>She looked straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible,"she said, "but I shall have to come into the water
  to do it." He held out his hand and she slipped from her perch.</p>

  <p>He held her unceremoniously enough by the scruff of her neck, for she
  needed both hands.</p>

  <p>"That's better, I think," he said, after the struggle which preceded her
  return to the bale.</p>

  <p>She said nothing, not knowing exactly what a lady, clad grotesquely in a
  Paquin blouse and black silk knickers, should say to a very self-possessed
  young stranger whom she had never met before until he had grabbed her by the
  hair and pushed and hauled her to temporary safety.</p>

  <p>"What was it struck us? "she asked, after a while.</p>

  <p>"A torpedo. I saw the submarine before it struck&mdash;at least I saw the
  periscope."</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"Rather beastly of them, wasn't it?" She shuddered at a certain terrible
  memory.</p>

  <p>"Fairly fierce," he answered nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Another long pause, broken only by a smothered exclamation on the part of
  the girl when, in heading the raft to its course, he had all but overbalanced
  her.</p>

  <p>"We're in&mdash;in danger rather, aren't we? "she asked presently.</p>

  <p>He looked up and his eyes met hers. She realised, with a little sense of
  amused surprise, that she had not looked at him before. He was good-looking
  and something more. There was a certain hardy healthiness in his face, which
  told of a life spent mainly in the open.</p>

  <p>"It all depends,"he answered cautiously. "That streak of grey is Ireland,
  and round about here we ought to strike a fishing-boat or two. Had you
  anybody with you on board?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and sighed.</p>

  <p>"That's a relief," he said cheerfully. "Well, I could echo that sigh."</p>

  <p>He swam lazily, using only one hand, and she wondered why. She thought of
  asking him when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Was there anybody on board you knew?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"With one exception they were the most uninteresting crowd of people I
  ever met," she said. "Had you anybody with you?" He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Somebody&mdash;somebody you were attached to?" she asked, and there was a
  pleasant little thrill of anxiety in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and she thought his tone sounded a little unsympathetic.
  But men hide their grief that way, she remembered.</p>

  <p>"You were saying there was an exception in that commonplace crowd?" he
  said.</p>

  <p>She looked down at him.</p>

  <p>"I should have imagined that you knew," she said, "everybody on board
  knew&mdash;it was in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"I never read the newspapers," he said; "you see&mdash;steady!"</p>

  <p>She was swaying wildly, and he put out his right hand to steady her. It
  was strange that he always gave her the hand he swam with. Perhaps he had
  injured the other.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your interesting man who was in all the newspapers," he
  said, after she had again recovered her sense of equation. "I am very keen on
  interesting men."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Balscombe," she said briefly. "Of course he is a horrible
  person&mdash;but women are interested in those kind of people, even nice
  women. I suppose it is the working of their insatiable curiosity. Just as
  they want to see what is the best in man, so they want to glimpse something
  of the worst. People call it morbidity, but in reality it is the anxiety of
  every person present to learn what he or she has escaped."</p>

  <p>"You're American, aren't you?" he asked, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Boston," she answered demurely.</p>

  <p>"That's near enough. I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;well, I don't exactly know what I
  am. My father was Irish, my mother was a Scot, and I was born in
  Gibraltar."</p>

  <p>"What do you call yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Canadian," he replied, with charming inconsequence. "You see I've lived
  there for quite a long time. Well, did you see Dr. Balscombe?"</p>

  <p>He asked this keeping his eyes on hers, and swimming easily on his
  side.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm rather glad I didn't. They kept him hidden away somewhere.
  You know&mdash;but, of course, you don't know, if you do not read the
  papers&mdash;he is a very dangerous character. I think if I were a man who
  had murdered two wives I should be a dangerous character, too. They kept him
  handcuffed&mdash;the steward told me&mdash;and were so anxious to get him
  back to Canada for trial that the Canadian Government sent over a special
  police official to watch him."</p>

  <p>"The devil they did!" said the stranger.</p>

  <p>The land was perceptibly nearer. The girl, balanced on the bale, could
  distinguish the white specks of cottages near the thread width of beach.</p>

  <p>"It is a long way yet," said the man, as if reading her thoughts, "but
  there will be a whole fleet of fishing-boats out, as soon as the news of the
  ship's foundering is telegraphed along the coast."</p>

  <p>She strained her eyes toward the shore, and for the first time the full
  realisation of her danger came to her and her lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"Now then!" he said sharply. "Go on talking&mdash;tell me something more
  about your Dr. Balscombe."</p>

  <p>She shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Please, I don't want to talk any more&mdash;are you sure that we aren't
  drifting?"</p>

  <p>"Go on talking," he repeated imperiously. "You're on the verge of a
  breakdown, my friend."</p>

  <p>"I'm not!" she denied indignantly. "But I'm cold, and hungry, and
  miserable. I don't want to talk about a brute who killed women for the sheer
  joy of killing them."</p>

  <p>"And you have a little lump at the back of your throat which you're trying
  to swallow&mdash;it is called the <i>bolus hystericus</i>, and it can't be
  swallowed."</p>

  <p>"Are you a doctor? "she asked.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'm a sort of a doctor," he confessed, "but don't rely upon me to be of
  any assistance to you in the event of your getting panicky."</p>

  <p>She turned sharply with a scornful retort and nearly overbalanced. So
  nearly, that he was surprised, not only into raising his inevitable right
  hand to save her, but into lifting himself so that, beneath the surface of
  the water, his left hand was visible also. She looked and saw, and, for a
  moment, she thought she would swoon.</p>

  <p>For about his left hand, unmistakable even in the brief glimpse she
  secured, was the bright steel clamp of a handcuff!</p>

  <p>She recovered her balance and her self-command at one and the same
  time.</p>

  <p>For the first time that day she was frightened. The sinking of the
  <i>Armanic</i> was little more than an exciting adventure compared with this
  greater and more terrible experience.</p>

  <p>"I think there is a boat coming our way," the man said suddenly. "Have you
  anything you could wave to attract its attention?"</p>

  <p>She had a handkerchief, but it was no more than a sodden little ball. She
  took it from her belt and regarded it ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Squeeze it out and hold it up&mdash;it will be quite dry before the boat
  comes anywhere near."</p>

  <p>There was a long and strained silence.</p>

  <p>The girl was thinking rapidly. For the first time she realised that she
  owed this man something&mdash;perhaps her life. She had not even a dim idea
  as to what had happened between the crash of the explosion, which had
  awakened her, and the finding of herself perched upon the little bale. Yet
  she must have enjoyed a lucid period, for it was quite impossible to have
  gained her position without some effort on her own part.</p>

  <p>She must know before she could balance accounts between herself and
  him.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me how I was rescued?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>He did not reply at first.</p>

  <p>"I think you rescued yourself," he answered, after the pause. "At least,"
  he corrected, "with very little assistance from me."</p>

  <p>"How did I find this?" she asked, nodding down at her support.</p>

  <p>"That was my bale," he confessed, "but quite unnecessary, as I had a life-
  saving waistcoat&mdash;so I just helped you on to it. And we sort of drifted
  away from the boats and here we are!"</p>

  <p>So she did owe him her life!</p>

  <p>She was confronted with the most painful dilemma that could face any human
  being. She was moving toward safety, thanks to the heroism of a convicted
  murderer&mdash;a man whose crimes had sent a thrill of horror through the
  civilised world. There was no question of Dr. Balscombe's guilt. She had read
  every scrap of the evidence, and knew there was no loophole of escape left to
  him.</p>

  <p>That brown sail, now making directly for them, meant life and comfort for
  her&mdash;for the man it meant an ignominious death. She set her teeth and
  faced the naked verities of the situation. This man's life was forfeit to the
  State.</p>

  <p>"What will you do when you get on board?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Borrow a dry suit," he answered cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"And after&mdash;when you get to land&mdash;and the police--"</p>

  <p>She had to make a supreme effort to get the word out.</p>

  <p>"The police?" he asked. "I see&mdash;you know?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, still keeping her gaze directed from the upturned face.</p>

  <p>Otherwise she might have seen evidence of his exhaustion, the hollowness
  of his eyes, the blue lips and pinched cheek.</p>

  <p>"I shall just report&mdash;but don't make me talk, please."</p>

  <p>His voice had dropped to a whisper.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in alarm. He had stopped swimming, and his head was
  sinking forward till it almost touched the water.</p>

  <p>To slip from the bale was the work of a second. With her right arm hugging
  the precious float, she raised his head with her disengaged hand.</p>

  <p>It fell back wearily against her shoulder. She looked wildly, around.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" she said.</p>

  <p>The boat with the brown sail was bearing down upon them. She had a half-
  formed plan in her mind and now it took shape.</p>

  <p>She let go his head, lifted the manacled hand to the water's level, and
  endeavoured so to wrap her handkerchief about it that the handcuff was
  hidden. But it was too bulky. Perhaps he had a handkerchief. She searched the
  nearest pocket and discovered a big water-soaked bandana.</p>

  <p>As best she could with one hand she muffled the offending wrist.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch this bandage..." was the last thing she said to the
  bald-headed Irish fisherman, who hauled them to the untidy deck of his smack,
  before she, too, collapsed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">TWO HOURS later they were sitting one on either side of a
  big, smoky, peat fire in a low-roofed cottage. He was his normal self, which
  meant that he was flippant and extremely amusing&mdash;or he would have been
  but for the trouble that was at the back of the girl's mind.</p>

  <p>He had, she noticed, rid himself in some way of the handcuff, which was a
  relief.</p>

  <p>She had had the greater part of an hour to formulate her plan for loosing
  on to the world the most cold-blooded scoundrel in the annals of criminality,
  but she did not know how to commence.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know," she began awkwardly, "that I am very well off."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I am very sorry."</p>

  <p>"Sorry!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he repeated. "It robs the adventure of half the romance&mdash;now
  if you had been poor, or just comfortably well-to-do, instead of being
  Marjorie Swain, a dollar millionaire--"</p>

  <p>"How did you know my name?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Just now you were taking it for granted that I knew everything about
  you," he mocked. "The kindly handkerchief you used--"</p>

  <p>She went very red. She had forgotten her handkerchief on his wrist under
  his own.</p>

  <p>"It was fortunate that you had your full name embroidered," he went on,
  "but, as I was saying, if you hadn't been rich, I should imagine myself to be
  in love with you."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" she gasped. "You! You!--"</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;such was the extraordinary fascination of this man, she felt
  something of happiness in his calm declaration. She herself realised this and
  went on hastily, almost incoherently:</p>

  <p>"I was going to say&mdash;I am well off and I am under an obligation to
  you. I am going to do a wicked thing&mdash;get you away from here. I have
  twenty pounds&mdash;it was in my belt pocket&mdash;go to London and see me
  there. I will give you a thousand pounds to--"</p>

  <p>The door opened behind her and the mellow voice of the fisherman tenant
  announced:</p>

  <p>"It's the police, yer honours."</p>

  <p>She sat up rigidly and looked at the man with terror in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Again she experienced that strange thrill,
  sympathy&mdash;pity&mdash;liking.</p>

  <p>As for the man, he smiled at the big red-faced inspector of Irish
  Constabulary, who had followed the fisherman into the room. "You got my
  message?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you find him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the inspector, "one of the boats picked him
  up&mdash;dead."</p>

  <p>The man nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I gave him a chance for his life&mdash;I had just time to unlock the
  handcuff that bound us together before I was thrown into the water. I had to
  keep close to him until we were clear of the coast."</p>

  <p>The girl stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked in a whisper; "I am Dr. Mallington of the
  Canadian Prison Service," he said, "and, until recently, attached&mdash;I
  think you say attached?&mdash;to the late Dr. Balscombe."</p>

  <p>He waited until the inspector had left the room and then leant
  forward.</p>

  <p>"We were interrupted at a very exciting part of your proposal," he said,
  and had the audacity to take one of her hands. "What happens after you give
  me all this money&mdash;do I furnish a home or something?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.a little shakily, but she did not withdraw her hand.</p>
