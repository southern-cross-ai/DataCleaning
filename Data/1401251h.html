  <p class="first">I KNEW that something was wrong the moment I parked my car
  under a cluster of eucalyptus and palm trees and advanced to the picturesque
  entrance of the best restaurant upon the Riviera. Louis met me as usual upon
  the threshold, it is true, but what a Louis! Up till a month before, when I
  had last seen him, he was, as he had always been, the predominant spirit of
  the place, suave, bland, with the smile and voice of an ambassador. To hear
  him suggesting a luncheon was a poem, a dinner an epic. And now! I shook
  hands with him, as was my custom after a somewhat prolonged absence, and,
  although his eyes seemed to be begging me to ignore his changed appearance, I
  felt compelled to refer to it.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter, Louis?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Influenza, sir," he replied&mdash;"a nasty bout of it. You wish your
  usual table, sir, of course&mdash;after the cocktail."</p>

  <p>He departed for a moment, returning with a menu. I could scarcely remove
  my eyes from him. His complexion was gray; he had lost flesh. There was a
  stoop about his neck, a haunted look in his eyes. His clothes were as
  faultless as ever, but they fitted him no longer. He was like the ghost of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"The whitefish are good, sir," he suggested, "or there is a small lobster.
  And I have some breast of lamb I was keeping specially&mdash;too small for
  more than one person&mdash;some early strawberries and red wine, and a cheese
  from our own dairy."</p>

  <p>"That sounds all right, Louis," I assented, trying not to look at him too
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"The Montrachet 1914, of course, sir," he concluded. "Will it be the
  lobster or the whitefish?"</p>

  <p>"The lobster," I decided. "I will be there, say, in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Everything will be ready, sir," Louis promised, making his escape.</p>

  <p>I turned to the barman.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to Louis?"</p>

  <p>"We are all wondering that, sir," the man replied. "He had a bout of
  influenza, but nothing that ought to have pulled him down like that. Looks as
  though he were being worried to death."</p>

  <p>"But what worry can he have?" I persisted. "He must make a large income,
  he's a single man, and he doesn't even gamble, so far as I know. Why, last
  time I saw him, he was thinking of buying a new limousine."</p>

  <p>"There's other things besides money, sir," the man observed enigmatically.
  "It isn't my business, anyway, and we're all fond of Louis, but there, you
  see what he is, and you remember what he used to be. I wish you would get him
  to talk to you."</p>

  <p>I presently made my way to my table. The Madrid, notwithstanding its great
  reputation, is not a large restaurant. There were barely a score of people in
  the room. A table exactly opposite to mine was evidently prepared for an
  expected arrival. A great bowl of pink roses had replaced the ordinary
  restaurant flowers; caviar, with its <i>et ceteras</i>, was already upon the
  table, and a small gold-foiled bottle stood in an ice pail. I inquired of the
  waiter who served me&mdash;Louis seemed to be keeping a little in the
  background&mdash;as to the whereabouts of the proprietor.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is in Paris," he confided. "Louis is left in sole charge.
  Monsieur is negotiating for the purchase of a restaurant in the Champs
  Elysées."</p>

  <p>I began my luncheon. Presently the arrival of another guest attracted my
  attention, and I looked up. She made her way to the table already prepared,
  ushered in that direction by Louis&mdash;a very tall, fair woman, large
  almost to ungainliness, florid of complexion, elaborately dressed, making
  those efforts that always possess a leaven of the pitiful to retain the
  freshness and air of youth. She leaned upon a stick, and a colorless-looking
  maid who followed her carried a small Pekingese. Louis placed a chair for the
  dog, as Madame somewhat ponderously seated herself. She thanked him with a
  gracious smile, motioned him to lean down, and began a whispered
  conversation. Louis fidgeted a little, bowed, and hurried off to obey the
  summons of an imaginary client. Madame commenced her meal.</p>

  <p>It is not my custom to watch the gastronomic efforts of my neighbors at a
  restaurant, but I must frankly confess that I watched the progress of
  Madame's meal with unpardonable curiosity. She ate at least three times as
  much caviar as I found myself able to consume. She followed that with a dozen
  oysters, after which she had three lamb-cutlets, peas, a soufflé of some
  sort, and wound up with cheese. She finished her pint of champagne early in
  the meal and called for another, and, after each course, she summoned Louis.
  Even at that short distance, and although I was frankly disposed to play the
  part of eavesdropper, I could hear nothing that passed between them, for her
  voice rose scarcely above a whisper. One thing, however, was obvious. So far
  as it was in her nature to be gracious, she was gracious to Louis. She patted
  him upon the arm, there were little gestures, smiles and meaning glances that
  clearly indicated her predilection. Louis forced smiles to his lips, replied
  with almost ghastly politeness to her confidential speeches. Each time he
  escaped the proximity of her chair, it seemed to me that he avoided meeting
  my eyes. When I left, Louis was lurking just outside, behind the
  orchestra.</p>

  <p>I took him by the shoulder, and made him pass across the threshold with
  me.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you, Louis?" I asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"The grippe&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me anything more about that grippe," I interrupted. "There's
  something on your mind, man. You're ill mentally. What is it?"</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing, monsieur," he assured me.</p>

  <p>"Who Is that terrible old woman?"</p>

  <p>He shivered.</p>

  <p>"It is Madame la Comtesse de Granent. Very nice&mdash;very nice indeed.
  She has taken a suite to the hotel. She has a servant to wait when she dines
  in her salon, a maid for herself, a maid for the dog, two chauffeurs, and a
  secretary. She is very rich&mdash;a wonderful client!"</p>

  <p>"A widow?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>Louis inclined his head. Some visitors bad just arrived. He seemed to
  welcome the chance of escape.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, sir," he begged. "I hope we will see you again before
  long."</p>

  <p>Three days later I approached the restaurant. For once, Louis was not upon
  the threshold to meet me. I gathered the reason as soon as I entered. I was a
  little later than on my previous visit, and Madame la Comtesse was already
  monopolizing his attention. Upon the cushioned chair by her side sat her
  Pekingese, opposite her a thin, sallow-faced youth, foppish and bejeweled,
  and by his side an elderly man, carefully dressed and possessing a distinctly
  legal and slightly pompous air. Presiding over the service of the
  feast&mdash;and from what I could see it was indeed a feast&mdash;was Louis,
  who scarcely found time to cast a glance in my direction.</p>

  <p>"And how is he today, Monsieur Louis?" I inquired of the barman.</p>

  <p>"Just the same, sir," the man replied, pouring out my cocktail.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Comtesse has company," I remarked.</p>

  <p>Charles looked down the room.</p>

  <p>"That Is her secretary," he confided. "He generally has his meals in the
  hotel, but occasionally Madame invites him to lunch. The gentleman opposite
  is her lawyer. He comes over once a week from Marseilles."</p>

  <p>I caught the upward glance of Madame as Louis bent toward her, and saw his
  little shiver of aversion as he turned away.</p>

  <p>"Why, Charles," I demanded, "does Louis allow himself to be worried to
  death by that woman?"</p>

  <p>The barman spread out his hands.</p>

  <p>"If I were Louis, I should go mad. She sends for him at all hours of the
  day and night. She will not be served by anybody else. It is true that her
  bills are enormous, but it is not Louis who gets the profits."</p>

  <p>"I suppose she gives good tips," I ventured.</p>

  <p>Charles became impressive,</p>

  <p>"Every Monday morning there are two hundred-franc notes for me. What Louis
  gets, no one can imagine, but besides money he has had, I know, a gold
  cigarette-case, a platinum watch and chain, and two sets of studs. It is a
  conquest Louis has made, sir. without a doubt."</p>

  <p>"A conquest that seems to have cost him something," I remarked dryly.</p>

  <p>Just at that moment Louis caught sight of me, and, with a menu in his
  hand, came hurrying forward. The change in him was more obvious than ever.
  His smile of welcome was forced. I noticed that the fingers that held the
  menu were trembling.</p>

  <p>"Well, what have you for me today, Louis?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>He suggested a simple luncheon, as usual, with due regard to my
  tastes.</p>

  <p>"Not often I lunch with you twice in a week, Louis." I continued, as he
  showed me to my table. "I rather hoped to find you less busy today, so that
  we might have a little talk."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"One is always busy here, while the season lasts," he remarked
  evasively.</p>

  <p>"How long is Madame la Comtesse staying with you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"As long as she is satisfied, I imagine, sir," he replied, "or until the
  end of the season. If she wishes to stay on, I suppose Monsieur Léon will
  keep the hotel open. She is not an ordinary client."</p>

  <p>"So one perceives," I conceded. "Why do you let her worry you so,
  Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Worry me?" he repeated, with a startled air.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, man!" I enjoined. "Do you think one doesn't notice?"</p>

  <p>He gave an order to a subordinate who was hovering around, and then he
  leaned a little nearer to me.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Forester," he begged, "do not, please, have any wrong ideas. I
  am not in good health. Madame la Comtesse is very gracious; she is a
  wonderful client We are all&mdash;the whole staff&mdash; myself
  included&mdash;very grateful to her."</p>

  <p>After that there was no more to be said to Louis. He avoided me for the
  rest of the meal, serving a wonderful banquet at the table on my right hand.
  Madame ate with the appetite of a grenadier. The legal gentleman from
  Marseilles, with his napkin tucked under his collar, was already flushed with
  his efforts. The secretary ate rapidly, drank whenever his glass was filled,
  and remained entirely unmoved. The three conversed incessantly, their heads
  almost touching.</p>

  <p>The lawyer had apparently brought news that was interesting to both his
  companions. Once he drew from his pocket a sheet of paper covered with
  figures, at which they all looked, and raised 1heir glasses. I gathered that
  some of Madame's investments had prospered, and that this was a feast of
  celebration. Anyhow, when I left, at three o'clock, they were still
  there.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I COMPLETED my business in Nice, dined at a small restaurant
  in a back street, famous for its wines and food, but, alas, now known to all
  the world, and made my way to the Casino. Without being in any sense of the
  word a gambler, I enjoy my occasional games of <i>chemin de fer</i>, and this
  evening was no exception. I won a little over a mille, turned in at the bar
  for a final whisky and soda, went in search of my car, and started off for
  Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>As a rule, I take the lower road, but that evening, remembering that it
  was opera night, and warned by the lights flashing all the way ahead of me
  along the curving road, I turned up to the left just short of the hospital
  and made my way on to the Middle Corniche, which at that time of night was
  almost deserted. Arrived at the highest point in the road, I paused to admire
  the view&mdash;the blaze of lights from one of the dark-hulled men-of-war in
  Villefranche Harbor, the long arm of Cap Ferret stretching into the sea, the
  glitter of the waning moonlight on the Mediterranean. Presently I lit a
  cigarette, and proceeded on my way.</p>

  <p>I had scarcely gone another two miles when I met with adventure. I had
  turned a sharp corner, just short of the tunnel, when I saw a couple of cars
  drawn up, and two or three men standing in the middle of the road. At the
  sight of my lights, one of them started at once to meet me, holding out his
  arm. I slowed down, imagining an accident, and came to a standstill at his
  gesture. A moment later I regretted it, for underneath his slouched, black
  hat the man who had accosted me wore a mask, which he had at first concealed
  with his hand, and a few feet from my head I found myself looking down the
  barrel of an automatic pistol.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Stop your engine!" the man ordered, speaking In husky English, but with a
  decidedly French accent.</p>

  <p>I obeyed promptly. There have been times in my life when I have been
  forced Into adventure, and I have never unduly shrunk from it. I fully
  realised, however, that this was an occasion when discretion was called
  for.</p>

  <p>"What else do yon want from me?" I inquired, thinking with some dismay of
  that mille note in my pocketbook.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the curt reply. "Descend from your car, and remain at the
  side of the way there. <i>Par ici! Bien!</i>"</p>

  <p>I obeyed, and glanced curiously down the road to where the other men were
  standing. An animated discussion was in progress, but I could only speculate
  as to its nature. My companion kept guard over me, although occasionally he
  glanced toward the others.</p>

  <p>"A hold-up!" I remarked, making an amicable attempt at conversation. "Are
  you not a little venturesome? We are within the limits of the police patrol
  from Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>The man made no reply. He moved his position slightly, so that he was able
  to keep watch on me and still cast frequent glances at his companion.</p>

  <p>"You permit that I smoke a cigarette?" I inquired, taking out my case. He
  had swung suddenly round, and I certainly have never disliked the look of a
  weapon more than his. At the sight of my harmless cigarette-case, however, he
  relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is not afraid?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Horribly," I confessed. "However, you have never hurt anyone yet, have
  you, if you are the same gang who robbed the Duc de Nîmes and Monsieur de
  Falleron a few weeks ago?"</p>

  <p>"It is the wish of the Chief that we should carry on our affairs without
  violence," the man announced, with a faint sneer, "but we should never
  hesitate to use force toward unreasonable people. There is a gentleman in the
  car there who narrowly escaped a bullet through his head. I think he has seen
  wisdom now."</p>

  <p>There were signs of a breaking-up of the little party ahead. Two of the
  men, both in evening dress, and one whose figure was, I fancied, familiar to
  me, stepped back into the car headed for Monte Carlo; two of the others
  entered the limousine pointed in my direction; a third man planted himself a
  few feet from the chauffeur of the former car.</p>

  <p>A moment later there was the roar of a powerful engine, and the limousine,
  starting at a tremendous speed, dashed past us. I could see nothing of the
  two men inside, but I know something about automobiles, and the lines of this
  one intrigued me. It was out of light almost at once.</p>

  <p>"And now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You can go in a few minutes," my guardian conceded.</p>

  <p>Apparently convinced of my reasonableness, he strolled away to where a
  couple of motor-bicycles were propped against the bank, turned on the lights
  of one, and started the engine. He wheeled it to the aide of my car, and
  stood leaning upon it.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of curiosity," I Inquired, "What would happen, if another car
  came up?"</p>

  <p>"There are not many who use this road at night. If a car should came, what
  we did would depend upon you. If you attempted to hail it or signal to it in
  any way. I should first shoot you in the leg&mdash;not to make too serious an
  affair of it&mdash;afterward I should shoot through two of the tires of the
  ear, and bid you a good evening."</p>

  <p>"An amiable program," I observed. "And supposing any of the occupants of
  the car were armed?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "One must risk something," he
  admitted.</p>

  <p>The minutes passed. He took out his watch. I, too, glanced at the dial
  with fascinated eyes. As soon as he had satisfied himself as to the hour, he
  slipped it back into his pocket, whistled down the road, sprang on to his
  bicycle, and left me. I watched him make mad progress toward Nice, his
  exhaust open, his light flaring down the road. Soon his companion followed.
  Directly they had disappeared, I started my car and drove slowly on to join
  my companions in misfortune. They were very frightened men, both of them,
  very angry. The one I recognised first was Van Nestos, an Armenian
  millionaire, the other, an American motor manufacturer, also enormously
  wealthy.</p>

  <p>"Did they get away with it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A hundred thousand from me," Van Nestos confessed.</p>

  <p>"And more than that from me," the American grunted. "Say, where's the
  police station at Monte Carlo, Major Forester?"</p>

  <p>"In Monaco." I replied. "We can be there in ten minutes. Come along."</p>

  <p>I went first to show them the way, and we arrived at the Commissariat in
  little more than the time mentioned. My companions told their story, and I
  mine. The listening functionary was intelligent, and gendarmes were out on
  their motorcycles within half an hour. Afterward Van Nestos, who was still
  shaking with fright and anger, insisted that I stop in at the Hotel de Paris
  for a drink.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," he announced, "I shall offer a fifty thousand francs reward.
  If the police in this part of the world are worth a dime, we'll have
  them."</p>

  <p>I made my <i>adieux</i>.</p>

  <p>"The police here are clever enough," I assured them, "but so are the
  criminals."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">OF COURSE, there was nothing else talked about from one end
  of the Riviera to the other for the whole of the following week but this
  sensational robbery on the Corniche Road. There had been two previous
  attempts.</p>

  <p>This time the robbers' plans had been perfectly laid, and they seemed, so
  far as one could gather, to have disappeared from the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>Van Nestos's fifty thousand francs reward remained unclaimed. I found
  myself studying the bills announcing the reward. Fifty thousand francs was a
  very useful sum of money. Yet, but for one circumstance of apparently trivial
  import, the criminals might as well have driven their car over the side of
  the road into the Mediterranean for any clue they had left behind them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the excitement of my adventure had in some measure abated, I
  found myself lunching again at Beaulieu. Conditions at the famous restaurant
  seemed unchanged. Madame, with her enormous appetite, was still there,
  lunching alone this time. I sat her out, waited until her maid had departed
  with the Pekingese, and she herself had taken her leave, passing down the
  room between a little row of bowing waiters. She lingered at the door to talk
  with Louis for a few moments, but, as soon as he returned, I took him, by the
  arm and led him out on the terrace.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Louis," I said, "something la preying upon your mind. Do you
  mean to tell me that you are allowing that woman to make you miserable?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is mistaken&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"No more of this, Louis," I interrupted firmly. "Tell me why you permit
  yourself to be worried almost to a shadow by that outrageous female"</p>

  <p>He looked around to be sure that we ware not overheard.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Louis."</p>

  <p>"Every day," he confided miserably, "it is the same. You see what she is
  like, monsieur&mdash;a terrible woman! She seems to have taken some absurd
  fancy to me. My life la becoming a horror," the man went on. "When she sends
  for me I have to arrange to be fetched in a few minutes on important
  business. She is always asking me to dine with her at Nice. I shudder when I
  hear the telephone from the hotel, or when the page comes across. If she
  doesn't soon it me alone, Monsieur Forester, I must go&mdash;although I am
  earning more money than ever before in my life and I am devoted to Monsieur
  Léon. He will never forgive me, if, by any chance, she should be offended and
  should leave."</p>

  <p>I leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Is this the whole truth, Louis?" I asked him earnestly.</p>

  <p>The man's honesty was transparent.</p>

  <p>"What more could there be?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Louis," I advised, "keep your mind from dwelling upon the situation.
  She'll give it up in time. What if I promise to bring another admirer along,
  and distract her attention?"</p>

  <p>"I should be Monsieur's grateful slave." Louis declared dejectedly, "but
  it will not happen. Many of my clients here, knowing who she is, and of her
  wealth, have been more civil to her than I can bring myself to be. She is
  simply rude to them. There is another gentleman from Nice who visits her
  frequently, but she never brings him in here. Her smiles are for me, and me
  alone."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">AT my usual time&mdash;a few minutes before one&mdash;five
  days later, I arrived with my guest. Monsieur Desrolles, of Monaco. It seldom
  happens, but the tables were mostly occupied by men lunching with a solitary
  male <i>vis-à-vis</i> or in parties. A few of the usual <i>habitués</i> of
  the place were there, and <i>Mademoiselle la danseuse</i> of the moment was
  in a corner with her latest admirer.</p>

  <p>At Madame la Comtesse's table were seated her secretary, her lawyer, and a
  third man&mdash;a Parisian, to judge from his appearance. Madame was wearing
  mauve, with a small hat and a tulle scarf. Her little Pekingese, too, was
  adorned with a bow of the same color. Louis caught me looking toward her, and
  glanced away.</p>

  <p>We were half-way through our meal when a note was brought in to me. I
  passed it to my companion. He read it carefully, permitted me to glance at
  the few words, and tore it absently into pieces.</p>

  <p>The sight of those few lines had stirred me curiously. I looked around the
  place almost as one might look upon a scene in a film or a descriptive
  chapter in a story, not altogether sure that I myself was one of the little
  company. There was the tall, dark, rather melancholy violinist, playing a
  waltz a few yards away from Madame, accompanied by his little orchestra;
  there was Charles in his white linen coat, leaning over the bar counter to
  catch a glimpse of a passing steamer through the window. Down the curving
  semicircle of the room, men and women were engaged in the usual business of
  lunching, with here and there a staccato note of flirtation. There was a
  party of four men, apparently absorbed in their food, yet with every now and
  then a curious watchfulness in their demeanor. An American, precisely
  dressed, in a plain gray business suit, with a shirt and tie of alien
  characteristics, was entertaining two or three ladies who had apparently just
  landed from some steamer. The waiters passed up and down the room,
  swift-footed, eager and attentive.</p>

  <p>As usual, Madame and her party were lunching profusely, and demanding a
  great deal of attention from Louis, from his subordinate <i>maître
  d'hôtel</i>, their fable waiters, and the leader of the orchestra. The whole
  service of the place seemed almost to center about them, and with the opening
  of that third bottle of champagne Madame's cheeks were more flushed than
  ever. My companion glanced out into the gardens. Another party had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>There were loungers in front of the hotel entrance, more loungers
  examining the miniature aviary just outside the restaurant. Monsieur
  Desrolles suddenly addressed me in a lowered tone, and I realised the thing
  was about to happen.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will excuse me for a moment," he begged. "It is better,
  perhaps&mdash;Monsieur will understand."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and approached the American, who was just paying his
  bill. He whispered a word in his ear, to which the departing guest listened
  in blank amazement. Then he passed on to another group, where a man was
  entertaining two ladies, and finally paused before the table of
  <i>Mademoiselle la danseuse</i>, and whispered also in her ear. Then he
  returned to me.</p>

  <p>His movements had bean so unobtrusive that scarcely anyone seemed to have
  noticed his little detour, but he had scarcely regained his seat before the
  American and his party hurriedly took their leave, before <i>Mademoiselle la
  danseuse</i>, with her arm through her companion's, moved to the bar, and the
  man entertaining the two ladies was clamoring for his bill. My friend
  summoned the cellar man.</p>

  <p>"The wine is becoming too cold," he said. "Please remove it from the
  pail."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed, and placed the bottle upon the table. Afterward I knew
  that this must have been a signal, for the scene that followed,
  notwithstanding its evidences of magnificent organization, its swiftness, its
  unexpectedness, resembled pandemonium. Monsieur Desrolles stepped behind my
  chair, threw his unneeded <i>pince-nez</i> upon the table, and cast a
  lightning-like glance up and down the room. The four men who had been
  lunching alone, and the two others from a distant corner, sprang to their
  feet. Outside, the newcomers who had been watching the aviary closed around
  the door, and, before I could realize it the whole company had encircled the
  table of Madame.</p>

  <p>Two men had gripped the shoulders of the <i>avocat</i> from Marseilles,
  two the secretary, two the visitor from Paris, and. even before their knives
  and forks had fallen clattering upon their plates, even before the cry had
  altogether escaped from the startled lips of any one of them, there were
  handcuffs upon their wrists.</p>

  <p>But, if these men, her myrmidons, had seemed to become easy prey to the
  officers of the law with whom the room appeared unexpectedly to swarm, it was
  otherwise with Madame. She had risen at the first alarm, and she seemed
  veritably to swell in her place as she stood there doing battle for her
  liberty. She kicked the chair away from behind her, her huge, muscular arms
  suddenly freed themselves, as though by some magical effort, from the
  unnatural constraint of her tight gown. The first man who had laid hands upon
  her lay senseless upon the floor.</p>

  <p><a id="MF03-2"

  </div><br>

  <p>With a sudden dive, she seized hold of the other, and, gripping him in her
  arms to shield herself from the bullets that threatened, she dashed down the
  room, to the amazement of the scattering company, only to find herself face
  to face at the door with the guard Monsieur Desrolles had posted there.</p>

  <p>For the first time she must have realized that the game was up. What
  followed we saw, wedged together, in our frantic rush from behind. She held
  out the struggling man she had been carrying to shelter her from the
  threatened attack, and then, bending one knee, she flung him straight, in the
  faces of the nearest of her antagonists. He fell upon the path and lay there
  unconscious. There was something terrifying in the sight of the man, who,
  with his disguise abandoned, and with his feminine trappery hanging around
  him in rags, stood dauntlessly facing certain death or capture. Not even the
  displaced flaxen wig, the patchy complexion, the shreds of his undignified
  masquerade, could make him ridiculous.</p>

  <p>One great arm swung out, and laid low a man who had foolishly approached
  within reach. He stood there, counting the chances against him, and finding
  them overwhelming. The next moment his right hand had momentarily
  disappeared, the sunlight flashed no longer up on the diamonds but upon
  something more sinister gripped in his fingers. He collapsed among them all,
  but the hand that had rid the world of her most notorious modern criminal had
  been his own.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR over a week the restaurant was closed. On the day before
  its reopening I found it still under surveillance, but there was access to
  the bar. and Louis was wandering about the grounds. He greeted me warmly, and
  the change in his appearance was marvelous.</p>

  <p>"You're much better, Louis," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur will admit that the situation for me was terrible," he pleaded,
  "and the curious part of it is that I, who was so much the subject of her
  pretended whims, never had the least idea but that she was indeed a woman.
  She imposed upon everyone, and she made a fool of me to keep up the illusion.
  There was no other disguise, I suppose," he went on "that could have
  concealed the face and figure of Martin Fynes. There were descriptions of him
  at every police center, but as a woman&mdash;a great, muscular fellow like
  that! Who would have believed it?"</p>

  <p>"I sat opposite to him three times," I acknowledged, "and I never had a
  moment's suspicion."</p>

  <p>"Except for Jean, who was one of them," Louis went on earnestly, "there
  was not a soul connected with the place who had the slightest, suspicion. The
  man who I told you used to visit her&mdash; was herself. The police found in
  her room a whole wardrobe of masculine attire, and, naturally, when there was
  an expedition on foot, she went as a man. You see, the hotel being in the
  grounds, no one sees who comes in and out, and Madame as a man had become
  quite a familiar figure, and was accepted as one of her friends. What we are
  all curious about, monsieur," Louis concluded, after a moment pause, "is how
  the police discovered the first clue that led them to the truth. All the time
  I have been here has never been a single inquiry concerning the <i>bona
  fide</i> of either Madame or any member of her entourage."</p>

  <p>The fifty thousand francs was already in my pocket, but I hesitated about
  letting Louis know the truth. It seemed strange that a momentary glimpse of
  the secretary's oblong platinum watch should have brought to justice one of
  the greatest of international criminals, so I kept my secret.</p>
