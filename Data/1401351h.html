  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>§ 1</h2>

  <p class="first">There was very little for her to see as Mrs. Sacret closed
  the mean door, on her empty home. There was no one in the street of small,
  ugly houses, the sky was a fleckless and pallid blue, the highroad that
  closed the vista showed cheap shops that were shuttered against the bleak
  Sunday, wisps of straw and paper lay in the gutter.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret paused and contemplated her surroundings with resentment that
  was the more acute as she realized that she was not more attractive than her
  neighborhood. A slight woman, thirty years of age, with ordinary features,
  hazel-colored hair and eyes and a subdued bearing, her graceful figure and
  feet were hidden under the shabby bombazine of a widow's mourning. Wrinkled
  cotton gloves concealed her hands; a black straw bonnet was tied by black
  ribbons under her chin and a crape veil concealed her face; she wore a silver
  brooch from which hung a cross twisted with a spray of ivy. Her pretty feet
  were deformed by trodden-over boots, their elastic sides were revealed as she
  bunched up her long skirts, awkwardly full in the gathers, under her mantle;
  her clothes had been made in meek and resigned imitation of the fashions worn
  by gentlewomen.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had passed a dull day in considering her future, a subject
  that she could not hope anyone was interested in, besides herself. The widow
  of a missionary whose life and death were obscure, who had bequeathed her but
  a few hundred pounds and the little house before which she now hesitated, she
  had, since her return to England three months ago, been seeking a livelihood
  with daily increasing eagerness.</p>

  <p>At first she had felt sure that some mission or society concerned with the
  spreading of the gospel message or the lot of the industrious poor would have
  secured her services as secretary or manageress, as matron or sister, and she
  was familiar with many who were ably directing the labors of those
  hard-working men and women employed in converting heathens abroad, or
  rescuing paupers at home. Mrs. Sacret had not only failed to obtain any such
  post; she had been made to realize the social disadvantages attaching to
  Dissent. In Jamaica these had not been obvious; if the Sacrets' humble
  mission was ignored by the Church of England chaplains, it was also respected
  by the Nonconformists among the sugar planters, and looked up to with awe by
  the Negroes who transformed all brands of Christianity into melody and color.
  In London Mrs. Sacret found the dividing line had become a wall&mdash;"only a
  Dissenter" was a usual term that dismissed as beneath notice the followers of
  a movement that had once overturned the country.</p>

  <p>Thus forced back on the organizations run by sects of her late husband's
  beliefs, or near them, she had found them poor, largely run by volunteers,
  and indifferent to her plight. Frederick Sacret had not been in any way
  distinguished from his fellows save by certain good looks and attractions
  discernible only by his wife, and by her forgotten long before his death from
  yellow fever in a Kingstown hospital.</p>

  <p>Nor was she, the daughter of a medical man and an Anglican, without a
  stiff gentility that made her slightly ungracious even when asking for a
  favor, and posts such as she wanted were, as she soon discovered, largely
  given as favors.</p>

  <p>Still pausing in the empty street, her situation confronted her once more
  in the inner chamber of her mind where her alarmed wits sat in council.</p>

  <p>Her parents had died when she, an only child, was a girl. Such relatives
  as she had were remote strangers; she was sure they would repudiate her and
  her misfortunes. An attempt to approach them on her marriage had led to
  rebuffs. Her father, who had never been more than the least popular doctor at
  Ball's Pond, Islington, was supposed by his family to have lowered his class,
  that of small Kent squires, by marrying the daughter of a local haberdasher,
  and Olivia, his child, had certainly descended again, by choosing a Dissenter
  and a missionary for her husband. The friends she had made at the Clapham
  School where she had been educated through the exertions and privations of
  her parents were scattered. She was never noticed either by mistresses or
  scholars and she had been at the select establishment only a year, for when
  her father died it was no longer possible to pay the fees.</p>

  <p>One girl had been kind, generous, even a little loving to the austere,
  plain and poor Olivia Gladwin, the pretty creature who had been Susan
  Freeman, then Susan Dasent, and who was now Susan Rue. Mrs. Sacret thought of
  Susan as she walked slowly along Minton Street toward drab High Street. She
  had last seen her former schoolfellow three years ago, when she, the amiable
  Susan, had been herself a widow, the wealthy Mrs. Dasent; then Olivia Sacret
  had sought her out and the two women had been very friendly. The episode
  stood out clearly in Mrs. Sacret's memory, as an exciting space of time,
  filled with a variety of interesting events, a short interlude in a
  monotonous life, for the Sacrets had gone to Jamaica a few months after the
  revival of the schoolgirl intimacy. Their correspondence, at first expansive,
  had soon ceased, for Susan Dasent could not write more than a scrawl, as Mrs.
  Sacret, who had so often done her lessons for her at the Clapham School, well
  knew, and was too lazy to continue even to send scrawls to the woman, who, in
  every sense of the word, had left her world.</p>

  <p>A printed card with a penciled greeting had informed Mrs. Sacret of
  Susan's second marriage, a year ago. The address was that of a hired home at
  Clapham. She had not replied and when she had returned to London she had not
  known where Susan lived; they had no common friend nor acquaintance, the
  circles in which they moved did not touch anywhere. Though by birth at least
  equal, for Susan's father was a city tea merchant, and Dr. Gladwin would have
  considered him his inferior, the delicate intricacies of London society, as
  finely balanced as a precise work of art, sharply divided the dissenting
  missionary's widow from the wife of the prosperous and well-placed banker,
  Martin Rue.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret, however, on this dull Sunday afternoon, was resolved to
  attempt the renewal of the lost friendship. She used that word, firmly, in
  her mind; yes, she affirmed, it had been friendship between herself and
  Susan, who had been so lucky with her inherited fortune and her two opulent
  marriages. Susan who had always been so indulged and flattered, not only
  because of her wealth, but because she was pretty, easy and soft, good
  natured, with charming flattering manners. Even if Susan Rue had been in the
  place of Olivia Sacret, she would have done much better for herself than the
  missionary's widow could do. She was so gentle, affectionate and helpless
  that someone would have been sure to rescue her from any distress, while no
  one ever felt much compassion for Olivia Sacret, with her independent air and
  the hint of irony in her intelligent glance.</p>

  <p>The lonely woman turned into High Street, then proceeded along it to the
  right; she had some way to walk; the omnibuses were infrequent and she
  avoided them whenever possible, as an affront to her gentility. She felt some
  satisfaction in her health. She had always been strong, the climate of
  Jamaica had not affected her native vigor, and she was well able to undertake
  the two miles or so to her destination, which was the Old Priory, Tintern
  Road, Clapham. Yesterday she had seen this address in the <i>Morning Post</i>
  that she had purchased in order to read the column headed SITUATIONS
  VACANT.</p>

  <p>Nothing had been on offer that she did not shrink from applying for, and
  it had been with a listless sigh that she had turned over the journal and
  stared absently at COURT AND SOCIETY. There she had seen the announcement of
  the return of Mr. and Mrs. Martin Rue from Florence to their new house in
  Clapham. So Susan, after hotels and hired homes, had now "a place of her
  own."</p>

  <p>At first Mrs. Sacret, lonely in her tiny parlor, had smiled sarcastically.
  Susan was being ostentatious, she did not come of a class that considered its
  movements of public interest, nor was her present position, solid as it was,
  comparable to the least of those remotely connected with the court. She had
  wasted her guineas to pay for this insertion at the bottom of a gazette to
  which her husband's wealth just permitted her an entrance.</p>

  <p>Then another thought had entered the keen brain of Mrs. Sacret and she had
  stared at the print as if something extremely useful had been put into her
  hand, a purse of gold, a weapon of defense and assault, or a rope with which
  to haul herself from the misfortunes that threatened to suck her down from
  her precarious comfort and respectability. Here was the address of a friend,
  she emphasized the word, who would, in many ways, help her, despite the
  difference in their positions and the length of time since they had met. She
  was proud with the pride that is the only possible defense against the
  humiliations inflicted on genteel poverty, with the pride nourished jealously
  by the woman, chaste as maid, wife and widow, in a society where this virtue
  is no passport to ease or pleasure, with the pride of the Christian
  missionary who has been in spiritual domination over the heathen, and proud
  with the aggressive pride of a Dissenter, secretly ashamed of having left the
  ranks of a church that the Nonconformists might consider in serious, even
  damnable, error, but that English society held in unshakeable esteem.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she believed in God, she knew herself for a righteous,
  self-sacrificing woman who desired nothing from life save a decent position
  where she could maintain her genteel pretensions and expend her energies in
  good works. The little house in Minton Street, and a daily maidservant, some
  place of consideration among her fellows and she believed she would be
  contented. The poverty of her childhood, her humble marriage, a dread of
  sinking to menial labor, unavowed fears of loneliness and the passive scorn
  or apathy of strangers who glanced at her once and never again, all made her
  cautious, unambitious, anxious for security.</p>

  <p>Three months ago she had not wanted to know Susan's address; she had even
  hoped that chance would not bring them together, their characters and
  fortunes were so ill-adjusted. Mrs. Sacret knew that she herself was
  intelligent, well informed, industrious and resolute, while Susan was stupid,
  ignorant, idle and weak. Even their names jarred on their circumstances; the
  ambitious haberdasher's daughter who had married above her class had
  christened her child the romantic Olivia, from the heroines of an old play
  and an old novel, while the wealthy, prosaic parents of Susan had chosen the
  unpretentious name of an equally wealthy aunt who had been godmother to their
  heiress.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had persuaded herself that she no longer wished to have any
  concern in the frivolous useless existence of Susan Rue. She had nearly
  destroyed the packet of foolish letters her friend had written to her during
  that brief return of their school days' intimacy, three years ago, when Susan
  had been so excited over her own affairs and so eager to confide in Olivia,
  who had been her stay and comfort at Miss Mitchell's Establishment for the
  Daughters of Gentlemen.</p>

  <p>But now, the withering of her hopes, the pressure of her loneliness, the
  curiosity and envy engendered by solitary brooding, overcame her pride,
  compounded of such varying emotions, and she walked steadily toward the Old
  Priory, Clapham.</p>

  <p>She was not sure that she wished to meet Susan, to risk finding her among
  smart, fashionable friends, but to look at the Rues' house, to learn the
  measure of their affluence&mdash;she considered that worth while. At the
  least it made a point to the empty Sunday afternoon, it would be an excuse
  for not attending the chapel in Gervase Square for the evening
  service.&mdash;"I went to see an old friend"&mdash;No one would miss her at
  that comfortable gathering, for she always kept herself apart, obviously
  superior to her company. As she steadily walked along High Street, between
  the shuttered shops, she thought of the gray chapel with distaste; if the
  Dissenters did not soon find work for her, she would return to the Church. An
  Evangelical clergyman would accept her without much demur. She had been
  brought up in those orthodox tenets, therefore it had been very easy to visit
  the Ball's Pond Chapel now and then when the preacher was of a particular
  repute, and there she had met Frederick Sacret. She liked his name, one
  letter altered and it would be "Secret"; life was only tolerable because of
  secrets hidden within her mind, guarded, seldom considered, never
  revealed.</p>

  <p>She crossed the wide river by the ponderous modern bridge. A breeze
  blowing from the left, from the sea, disarranged her clumsy garments, the
  turned and ironed ribbons on her bonnet; her mourning looked rusty in the
  pale light. She felt discomfort from the wind and from being suspended above
  the flowing water, alone and beaten upon by the cold air, but neither the mud
  flats behind her, reaching to terraces before straight brick houses, nor the
  leafless trees and featureless huts of the market gardens on the shore before
  her, depressed her. The Thames and the prospects of gray river, gray shores
  blank of human beings, and blurred by a blister-colored mist, were not gloomy
  to the woman who carried her mood with her, and who was self-centered enough
  to have found the smooth tints, vivid sun and soft airs of Jamaica
  ineffective because she was unhappy.</p>

  <p>She reached the farther shore, skirted the vegetable frontages showing
  cabbage stalks and untidy chicken runs and took her way along a poor street
  that led into a better neighborhood, then on to a small open common round
  which, at gracious intervals, were large suburban mansions standing in
  gardens overcrowded with shrubs and trees. The scene resembled a village
  green transformed by the spell of a vulgar magic. Where the noble Norman
  church should have stood was an ostentatious building of Portland stone, with
  a heavy spire, shut off by coarse railings and gate from the road. Where the
  homely inn with the ancient sign should have stood was a large public house,
  of bright brick and corrugated yellow plaster, with the absurd statue of a
  black bull on the parapet above the porch. Instead of cottages with flowers
  in front and orchards behind, there were these solid residences, in varying
  styles of hybrid architecture, with turrets, towers, conservatories,
  balconies so unrelated as to appear like the edifices put together at random
  by an impatient child from a medley of crude models. These ugly mansions, as
  yet unstained by the soot that rendered dingy the church and the public
  house, were fronted by stiff double drives, heavy double gates, dark foreign
  trees and ponderous shrubs with dark, dirt-laden foliage, and backed by the
  empty sky. Instead of the homely and cheerful gathering of the village green,
  carriages were driven slowly around and around by stout and ruddy coachmen
  accompanied by silent grooms. The immobility of these people, who, in their
  parts as servants, had almost ceased to exist as human beings, the steady
  sound of the slow moving horses and wheels, added to the somber ugliness of
  the scene that meant nothing save that money, without taste or tradition to
  control it, had been used lavishly for comfort, luxury and display.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret understood perfectly what she saw. It was Sunday and these
  cosy folk were visiting one another for tea; the carriages had come from
  another part of Clapham, or from another suburb. These mansions were not the
  most expensive in the neighborhood, farther on there would he others, where
  the inhabitants would not have to endure the old established if recently
  rebuilt public house, people who could afford two menservants. Her shrewd
  glance appraised the carriages; they belonged, she was sure, to families even
  more wealthy than those that surrounded this little common.</p>

  <p>She went on slowly, beginning to feel fatigue; the liveried servants
  ignored her as she ignored them, though she was aware of the curiosity in
  their sharp eyes, and they were aware that she was a stranger and out of
  place in this select neighborhood. She wished to ask the way to Tintern Road,
  but it did not even occur to her that she could question these menservants;
  she went on as if they did not exist, knowing they were staring after her,
  hearing the sound of slow wheels and hoofs on the placid air. She passed the
  large common, crossing a corner of the harsh, urban grass; the faded black of
  her clothes blended nicely with the neutral tints of her background, English
  half tones, smudged with a still mist, as a painting is smudged with varnish.
  She was solitary and weary, conscious that she was on strange ground. Never
  had she lived in such a luxurious neighborhood as this, nor had any
  connection with the people who inhabited it. Once she had visited Susan, when
  they were girls, but the Freemans' house at Wandsworth had not been as
  imposing as these houses before her now, though far too imposing for her ease
  of mind; she had never repeated the experience though Susan's parents had
  been kindly.</p>

  <p>She knew that if she ever did reside in such a wealthy suburb as this, it
  would be as a dependent, a companion, since she had not the qualifications
  for the post of governess, or as a housekeeper, very little more considered
  than the rigid servants on the carriage boxes she had just passed. She
  decided that she would not call on Susan. They were completely out of touch,
  only embarrassment could result to both of them from her unexpected and
  almost certainly inopportune visit. Better, she thought, to go back, cross
  the river and return to the mean decorum of Minton Street where, at least,
  she felt equal to her surroundings. But as she hesitated on the turn of her
  steps, she noticed a high wall, at right angles to the common, on which was
  painted in bold black letters, TINTERN ROAD, very plain for her to see.</p>

  <p>It would be poor spirited, she reflected, to return without even looking
  at Susan's house, so she walked along the empty road that was bordered by the
  stout walls that concealed mansions and gardens of grandiose proportions. At
  generous intervals these were broken by gates leading to trim gravel drives,
  flanked by laurel, privet and lilac borders. On the second of these gates was
  painted, also plain for her to see, THE OLD PRIORY.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret could observe the house when she peered between the iron
  uprights of the gate, though it stood well back and was partly concealed by
  laburnum and acacia trees that grew in clusters behind the border of the
  drive. It was a building in the style of the Gothic revival, feebly copied,
  with castellated roof below the chimney pots, a tower with pinnacles, arched
  hooded windows, a Norman porch and wide steps with plaster dogs sitting at
  attention on the balusters. Mrs. Sacret could see, between the dirty boughs,
  a glitter of shining glass, the shape of outbuildings, a conservatory and
  stables.</p>

  <p>"A great deal of money," she muttered; then she opened the gates
  cautiously, intending no more than a closer inspection of Susan's home, and
  her shabby dark figure, gloomy with the crape-edged mantle and skirt, the
  black bonnet, the widow's veil, approached the house, steadily, with delicate
  tread.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was observant and well informed within her limited scope. She
  had natural taste, never yet expressed, and an ironic cast of mind, so she
  smiled at the ostentatious house before her, that she knew to be a sham in
  all the pretensions it implied.</p>

  <p>There had never been a monastic establishment here; the name had been
  given vaguely, because of the supposed character of the architecture that had
  probably been chosen because of the name of the road by someone who could
  recall the ruins of Tintern, but not that it was an abbey.</p>

  <p>Susan, thought Mrs. Sacret; it was built for her, it is quite new&mdash;or
  she renamed it.</p>

  <p>And this reflection on Susan's clumsy stupidity strengthened Mrs. Sacret's
  self-confidence; she asked herself why she should be afraid of a foolish
  woman, however wealthy. The knowledge that she could have used money to
  better purpose than Susan had used it in this ugly place, consoled her for
  her poverty, her fatigue, and her dim prospects.</p>

  <p>The place was truly ugly, even the shrubs and trees were clipped,
  overcrowded or badly planted, so that they seemed unreal, and they were an
  unnatural hue from dust; the mist hung in dark soiled drops from the harsh
  leaves of the mottled laurels, the grass border was without freshness. The
  house, of large ungainly proportions, was ill set, the stucco painted a drab
  yellow incongruous with the turreting, the Gothic intention, the chimney
  stacks, belching slow-rising smoke, were absurd, the monkey puzzle trees
  behind, crooked and twisted, the Venetian blinds at the windows another
  evidence of lack of taste. Mrs. Sacret could reasonably smile. Her own mean
  home was more seemly and pleasing for it was without affectation. But the Old
  Priory displayed impressive signs of wealth that Mrs. Sacret quickly noted;
  it was as neat as it was grandiose and the outbuildings, the glittering panes
  of the domed conservatory, the gardener's cottage in a rustic design, the
  speckless drive and steps, the shining windows, all showed the patient care
  of many humble hands.</p>

  <p>"I might as well see Susan," reflected Mrs. Sacret and rang the iron chain
  bell that hung inside the porch. An elderly maid in a street gray poplin
  uniform opened the door immediately and stared with surprise at the dark
  figure of the widow smiling through the meshes of her crape veil.</p>

  <p>"Can I see Mrs. Rue? Will you please tell her that a friend, Mrs. Sacret,
  has called&mdash;has come a long way to visit her."</p>

  <p>The lady was gratified to observe that her genteel manner served her; the
  maid, though startled, asked her into the hall, and went in search of her
  mistress.</p>

  <p>"So Susan is at home&mdash;is it lucky or unlucky that we shall meet?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret glanced about her; the floor was tiled, the staircase marble,
  a window at the back filled with colored glass, blue, crimson and yellow, the
  walls were wood paneled and a large ornate iron lamp hung from the ceiling.
  It was very ugly, it was also very costly and well kept. Mrs. Rue would see
  Mrs. Sacret and the two friends met in the large room at the back of the
  house that gave onto the garden; a room luxurious, comfortable, cheerful.
  There was a grand pianoforte, a brilliant fire, and pots of forced flowers.
  The furniture was handsome, the chairs were softly cushioned, the tables
  displayed gold and silver trifles, the pearl-tinted wallpaper set off water
  colors of romantic scenery in wide mounts and gilt frames. Everything that
  Mrs. Sacret had ever associated with ease and luxury, if not with elegance
  and good taste, was present in Susan's surroundings, while she herself was
  dressed in a rose-hued taffeta, ruffled with blond lace, that was a sharp
  contrast indeed to the widow's dowdy black garments.</p>

  <p>Susan was effusive, in the charming, breathless and rather foolish manner
  that Mrs. Sacret remembered so well. She ordered tea and pressed her friend
  with quick questions, the most often repeated of which was&mdash;"Where have
  you been? Why have you not written? I did not know where you were!"</p>

  <p>"How should you," replied Mrs. Sacret. "My address is not ever in the
  <i>Morning Post</i>, that was where I saw yours."</p>

  <p>"We must have some sherry!" cried Mrs. Rue, starting up, and with quick
  pretty movements she had soon brought out a fine cut glass decanter and
  heavy, glittering glasses from a Sheraton cabinet and poured out the
  tawny-colored wine, Bristol milk, nearly as strong as an old port.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't take it," said Mrs. Sacret, "and not before tea."</p>

  <p>"Do drink it, I expect you have come a long way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, and not in a carriage either. I live in my little house in
  Minton Street that you may remember."</p>

  <p>"Of course I remember it." Mrs. Rue drank her sherry then poured herself
  another glassful. "I did not know you were in London&mdash;when you wrote to
  me from Jamaica, after your&mdash;I mean&mdash;" She was confused, sighed and
  pulled out her handkerchief. "Oh, dear, you will have thought me so
  heartless; you wrote of your sad loss and I <i>did</i> answer, but you
  replied that your plans were unsettled and I never wrote again; do forgive
  me."</p>

  <p>"My plans <i>were</i> unsettled," agreed Mrs. Sacret gently. "And I did
  not expect you to write, nor any explanations. Indeed, I hardly expected to
  see you again, Susan."</p>

  <p>"Oh, why ever not!" exclaimed Mrs. Rue nervously.</p>

  <p>"Our positions are so different. I came to London to look for
  work&mdash;and I haven't found any. It was only a chance made me come here,
  just the chance of seeing your address yesterday."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rue had drunk her second glass of sherry, she was flushed and
  restless. Mrs. Sacret thought she had been sleeping by the bright fire, sunk
  in the easy chair, in the room scented with the hothouse flowers, when her
  unexpected visitor had been announced.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I startled you, Susan, coming like this&mdash;in my mourning.
  I am so sorry. I should have written; it was just an impulse. I really only
  intended to look at your house and go away again; then, somehow, I thought I
  would like to see you. I daresay that was ill advised." Mrs. Sacret sighed,
  her pleasant voice fell to a whisper. "I've been lonely and poor, and idle,
  for awhile now, and living so one gets things out of proportion."</p>

  <p>"But, of course, I want to see you. I think of you so often," protested
  Mrs. Rue. "Oh, here comes the tea. Are you sure that you won't have a glass
  of wine first? It is so refreshing."</p>

  <p>"No, just the tea, thank you, Susan, just that and a little talk about the
  past."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the handsome tea equipage with the inevitable curiosity of
  the poor for the appointments of the rich&mdash;heavy silver, Worcester
  china, extravagant dainties, forced peaches and a pineapple were arranged on
  Brussels lace.</p>

  <p>"We have pineries," chattered Mrs. Rue quickly fidgeting with cups and
  plates. "Martin is interested in seeing what we can grow. Do you like the
  house? Martin bought it last year&mdash;I altered the name to the Old
  Priory&mdash;because of Tintern Road."</p>

  <p>"So I supposed. I know your romantic taste, Susan. No, not any cream, I am
  not used to rich food; indeed I live very plainly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, on principle&mdash;as a Christian missionary."</p>

  <p>"And because I cannot afford anything but the cheapest fare."</p>

  <p>As she ate her sponge finger and sipped her China tea she regarded Susan
  critically. In her soft pink dress the pretty plump young woman was much like
  a rose herself, a loosened summer rose, soft, warm, luxuriant; she glowed,
  with her sanguine complexion, her bright brown hair, her blue-gray eyes, her
  white teeth, into one radiance that slipped into the pearls around her throat
  and the diamond bracelets at her wrists. Everything about her was expensive
  and Mrs. Sacret was surprised that she should be sitting alone on this Sunday
  afternoon; surely she had any number of friends; but questioned, Susan Rue
  replied, no, she was not expecting anyone, and Martin was away, spending the
  Sunday with his mother at Blackheath. "And what was the little talk about the
  past you wanted, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, our school days and then, three years ago, when you used to come to
  Minton Street, after Captain Dasent's death."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you were very kind to me then, Olivia; of course I shall never
  forget it. I don't know what you thought of me, I mean, I was so foolish,
  feather headed, as you used to say, and you were such a comfort, allowing me
  to write to you and pour out all my troubles."</p>

  <p>"They are over," smiled Mrs. Sacret. "I haven't come to remind you of
  them. I'd forgotten them until I came upon some letters of yours in an old
  box."</p>

  <p>"Some letters of mine! I suppose you burned them&mdash;as rubbish?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. I can't think why. I suppose I felt a little tenderly about
  them&mdash;about the days when we were such intimate friends."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter&mdash;they are safe with you."</p>

  <p>"Why, Susan, you speak as if there was mischief in your letters&mdash;or
  harm. You know if there had been I should never have been your confidante."
  Mrs. Sacret smiled charmingly. "And now you are so happy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose that you approve of second marriages," interrupted Susan
  Rue uneasily. "But I was very young&mdash;and sad&mdash;and not fit to manage
  my business, and in a conspicuous position&mdash;a widow with money.</p>

  <p>"Pray don't explain to me, dear," murmured Mrs. Sacret. "Of course you
  were right to do as your heart bid you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My heart," muttered Mrs. Rue, staring at her untouched cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"And you are lucky, also. Two rich husbands&mdash;no, I don't mean that in
  a vulgar sense, but you were just born to be petted and a little pampered,
  Susan, and to have someone to look after you. I am very glad, indeed, to see
  you so handsomely established."</p>

  <p>Susan Rue sighed. She seemed much disturbed by this sudden appearance of a
  figure from the past, and her facile, impulsive nature was without defenses
  against the serene skill with which Olivia Sacret probed into her simple
  affairs. After a further short conversation the missionary's widow learned
  that her rich, lovely and indulged young friend was as lonely as she was
  herself, lonely and a little frightened. Her second marriage was not very
  successful. Martin was jealous, censorious and mean&mdash;yes, that was it,
  he was mean; though she had two fortunes to dispose of, he watched all her
  expenditures and begrudged her the comforts to which she was entitled. Why,
  as Olivia must have noticed, she had not even menservants, and then he
  disliked her going about, or entertaining, and she led a very solitary life.
  Martin was always at his office, or with his mother, or worrying about his
  health. Why, when they were in Florence, where she had expected to be gay,
  they had hardly left their hired villa and met no one. It was only on his
  glasshouses that Martin was prepared to spend money, on the pineries, the
  conservatories. And she, Susan, was tired of the tasteless forced fruit, the
  pallid forced flowers and the delicate ferns over which Martin fussed so
  continually&mdash;as if they were human. Olivia Sacret listened to this
  ingenuous confession with a sense of power; at a step she had regained her
  old ascendancy over this weak nature. Susan felt an obvious relief in pouring
  out her frivolous, futile complaints to this girlhood's friend, and Olivia
  slid easily into her old position of confidante.</p>

  <p>"You should have waited, dear," she said sympathetically. "And married Sir
  John Curle. I saw that his wife is still&mdash;an invalid."</p>

  <p>At this Susan showed a startling agitation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please, Olivia! Don't ever mention that name, now please don't.
  Martin is so jealous."</p>

  <p>"What does he know about it? That name?"</p>

  <p>Susan began suddenly to weep. "We were seen together&mdash;and talked
  of&mdash;a little&mdash;you know&mdash;he was married, though Lady Curle had
  been separated from him so long&mdash;and was weak-minded, and someone, of
  course&mdash;I think it was his mother&mdash;told him&mdash;and he is always
  casting it up at me."</p>

  <p>"Casting what up?"</p>

  <p>Susan sobbed speechlessly.</p>

  <p>"Why, I never came here, after all this time, to distress you," cried Mrs.
  Sacret rising. "I never thought&mdash;I supposed you were happy&mdash;there
  now, do dry your eyes, before the maid comes, or what will she think I have
  done to you?"</p>

  <p>Susan made a childish effort at control.</p>

  <p>"I never see him, now, never," she murmured. "It is all past&mdash;and I
  can trust <i>him</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I don't see why you disturb yourself. I'm sorry I mentioned
  the letters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The letters, please, please, burn them, Olivia."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you wish. Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you want to say. I ought to have thought of it
  before&mdash;to have looked you up&mdash;to have done something for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, dear?" asked Mrs. Sacret softly, bending over the
  voluptuous figure of her friend in the soft scented silks and laces. Susan
  Rue glanced up with wet, frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>"You said you had not found a post&mdash;and that you were poor."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;hut I know what to do."</p>

  <p>Susan shrank from the serene gray eyes whose gaze was fixed on her so
  steadily. "Of course," she whispered. "I understand. Will you come and live
  with me? I need a companion."</p>

  <p>"I did not think of that position," replied Mrs. Sacret, concealing her
  intense surprise, "in anyone's house."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I mean as a friend&mdash;as if you were a sister, everything as I
  have it&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;pocket money."</p>

  <p>"Pocket money?" repeated Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" asked Susan Rue wildly. "I can only give you half of
  what I have myself&mdash;by pocket money I meant a salary&mdash;say two
  hundred a year&mdash;and presents&mdash;and nothing for you to do."</p>

  <p>"How extravagantly you talk," said Mrs. Sacret, withdrawing across the
  hearth. "I never came here to ask for anything."</p>

  <p>"I know why you came. I've often expected you'd come. But I thought you
  were in the West Indies&mdash;you were always a good friend to me," added
  Susan rising. "And I have no one," she dabbed her eyes, "to talk to&mdash;and
  I'm sure I'm not offering you too much. I'm very tiresome to live with."</p>

  <p>The maid entered to fetch the tea equipage and Mrs. Sacret skillfully
  turned the conversation to an easy commonplace, under cover of which she took
  her leave, kissing Susan's hot cheek kindly and promising "to think over"
  what had been said and to "write soon."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>§ 2</h2>

  <p class="first">The missionary's widow found her little house mean and even
  bleak after the luxury and comfort of the Old Priory. It was easy to smile at
  Susan's ignorance and poor taste, but the interior of her pretentious
  dwelling was, Olivia Sacret considered, desirable. She had not before noticed
  how agreeable money could make life. When she had last seen Susan she had
  herself been absorbed in her own affairs, her marriage and her work; both had
  then seemed exciting, now, in retrospect, dull. She noticed the drafts under
  the ill-fitting doors, the rubbed drugget, the sagging chairs. She had never
  tried to make her home pleasant, believing vaguely, that to do so would be
  frivolous, even wrong. She sat long beside her scanty fire, in the light of
  the oil lamp with the opal globe, thinking of Susan, and then, with a start,
  of God. She should pray for Susan, so worldly and so selfish, and she was
  surprised that she had forgotten to advise her friend to pray, to question
  her on her religious duties that she had never faithfully fulfilled. Mrs.
  Sacret could not understand how it happened that she had so lost, not only
  her professional manner but her professional attitude of mind, when with
  Susan. Usually she was suavely ready to offer spiritual consolation to the
  distressed. She supposed it had really been astonishment that had so shaken
  her out of her mental routine. Astonishment at Susan's confusion, her
  confession of an unsatisfactory marriage, her dismay over the letters, and
  her extraordinary offer to Olivia&mdash;an offer beyond even Susan's reckless
  generous nature to make.</p>

  <p>"She was frightened." The three words almost formed themselves on Mrs.
  Sacret's pretty lips; a stir of impatience made her rise and, taking the
  lamp, go into the basement kitchen. She prepared herself a tidy supper of
  cold ham and cocoa, while she pondered: Frightened of what?&mdash;and ate it,
  sitting at the scrubbed table and staring at the cold black-leaded grate.</p>

  <p>The letters. So she thought of them now, as if they were the only letters
  in the world. Susan had wildly hoped that they were "safe," had asked that
  they might be destroyed, but Olivia Sacret remembered them as harmless,
  ill-written chatter, silly accounts of her flirtations with Sir John Curle,
  and her regrets as to his hopeless marriage. Mr. Sacret had not liked Susan's
  behavior, he had said she was being "talked about," though she was always
  prudently chaperoned by relatives or paid companions, and had wished his wife
  to discountenance the lovely widow. But Mrs. Sacret had continued to receive
  the confidence of her friend and to allow her to visit the house in Minton
  Street, not only out of sympathy with one who was so gentle and kind, but
  because, secretly, she liked the romance&mdash;there was no other
  word&mdash;that Susan's unfortunate love affair provided. Neither could she
  see anything wrong in the situation. Susan had behaved very well; her tone
  had been, from the first, one of renunciation. She had visited Lady Curle in
  her sad retreat, tried to make friends with her, and had, together with
  Olivia, prayed for her recovery to normal health. Nor was Sir John less
  noble; his attachment to Susan, though sudden and violent, had never, she had
  promised Olivia, been more than whispered. And soon after the Sacrets had
  gone to Jamaica, he had left England. Nothing could have been more proper,
  though Olivia had considered the second marriage regrettable. Susan should
  have remained a widow, but she was so weak!</p>

  <p>Susan was so weak. Mrs. Sacret shivered. The kitchen was cold. It was
  stupid to be wasting the fire in the parlor; she left her soiled dishes on
  the table, took up her lamp again and ascended the short steep flight of mean
  stairs; in the narrow passage she paused. The letters were in her bedroom, in
  the bottom of a hair trunk; she wanted to read them again for she had
  forgotten all of them save their general trend. She had never even read them
  carefully, as she had never listened carefully to Susan's gushing talk. But
  it would be mean to read the letters with a curious, prying eye. They must be
  burned, as Susan wished, and burned unread, that would be the honorable
  action.</p>

  <p>Olivia sat again between the lamp and the fire that she mended with a
  frugal hand. Thoughts had been aroused in her that were not easily dispelled.
  Surmises and questions raised not lightly parried or answered.</p>

  <p>She again forgot God and the prayers she should have put up for Susan, so
  unhappy and bewildered.</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow drooped in her hard chair, her graceful body taking
  on lines of unconscious elegance. She considered the sharp difference between
  her fate and that of Susan's. For her, next to nothing, and soon, nothing at
  all, but the position of an upper servant, scarcely higher than that of the
  gross, servile men she had seen today behind the fat horses, lazing away the
  barren Sunday afternoon. For Susan, everything that most women desired. But
  Susan was not happy. An intense curiosity stirred in Olivia Sacret. She tried
  to puzzle out the reason for the other woman's trouble. Susan had always been
  gay and careless, her only grief had been her hopeless affection for Sir John
  Curie, but surely that had never been very deep, or she would not so soon
  have married Martin Rue? Olivia had expected to find Susan, in her usual
  shallow way, cheerfully content and the center of admiring friends. But she
  had been alone. And unhappy. I should like to see Martin Rue, reflected
  Olivia, but checked herself with a false piety, horn of long habit. But I
  must not be prying, I must be very sorry for Susan and try to help her.
  Tonight I shall pray for her, and tomorrow I shall burn the letters and write
  to Susan to tell her that I have done so.</p>

  <p>She began to compose the sentences, wise, kind and well turned, that she
  would send her friend. She would offer her excellent advice about "turning to
  God," and she would conclude by suggesting that they had better not meet
  again, as their lives were so different. The room darkened about her; she
  startled to find the lamp going out with a nasty smell of paraffin oil. She
  had forgotten to fill it. She had neglected her house in order to undertake
  that useless walk to Clapham. Olivia Sacret had been trained to feel guilty
  on the least excuse and "to take the blame" in the part of permanent
  scapegoat for any daily misadventure. She had always considered that this
  attitude gave her an air of becoming meekness, until her husband, in the
  irritable tones of an invalid, had once told her that her ready assumption of
  guilt covered a secret and unshaken self-satisfaction. Then she had lost her
  zest for this form of abnegation, but the habit remained. Now she began to
  think of her afternoon's adventure as not only senseless but sinful.</p>

  <p>She turned out the lamp, lit a candle and went upstairs to her chilly
  bedroom, with the white dimity curtains, white honeycomb quilt on the narrow
  bed, the framed texts on the cheaply papered walls, the yellow varnished
  furniture. She looked at once toward the trunk that contained all her
  intimate possessions; tomorrow she would burn the letters unread. Again she
  dwelt on the lines that would renounce this unsuitable, perhaps dangerous,
  friendship. Yes, perhaps dangerous, for it might arouse in her feelings of
  envy, of regret, a sense of power.</p>

  <p>"Our lives are so different," she had resolved to write to Susan, but as
  she put out her candle and shuddered into the cold bed, her thought
  was&mdash;but Susan offered to share her life with me, and that thought
  remained with her throughout a sleepless night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>§ 3</h2>

  <p class="first">The morning after brought Mrs. Sacret a distasteful post, a
  refusal to consider her application for the secretaryship of a tract society,
  small bills from small tradespeople, a letter from the doctor who had
  attended her husband in Jamaica, "enclosing my account, distressed to send
  it, but I am not a rich man."</p>

  <p>Nor am I a rich woman, thought Mrs. Sacret. This old debt nagged her; she
  would, now and then, pay a few pounds off, but it still remained, a heavy sum
  for her poor means. The little daily maid was sullen, the mood in which she
  usually returned to work on Monday. Mrs. Sacret suspected her of being on the
  point of "giving notice." The missionary's widow was acutely aware that she
  was not popular as a mistress; even incompetent servants could "better
  themselves" in the houses of rich people. It was not so much the low wage
  that irked as the poverty of the establishment. The hired "helps" loathed
  having to account for every stick of firewood and pinch of tea; they scorned
  empty cupboards and all the shifts of genteel penury. "I can manage by
  myself, of course," Mrs. Sacret told herself as she had told herself before.
  But she never did so manage, for long. Not only did she secretly dislike
  housework, she dreaded the loneliness. Another woman who brought in some
  neighborly gossip was at least some company, someone to talk to, if only in a
  tone of distant patronage and reproof.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret put down her irritating correspondence and rose.</p>

  <p>"That is what I have come to&mdash;someone to talk to&mdash;I really am
  without friends, or even acquaintances." She was frightened, but added
  resolutely, "It is the Lord's will." She fetched Susan's letters; they lay
  beside a few of her husband's books, his spectacles in a worn leather case,
  some linen bags of cowrie shells and red and black seeds and a papier-mâché
  box that had belonged to her mother. The letters had been kept out of
  friendship for Susan and for no other possible reason, Mrs. Sacret was sure
  of that. She took them downstairs and the fire was burning brightly in the
  high narrow grate; it would have been simple to have laid them on top of the
  glowing coals but she hesitated.</p>

  <p>Now that this friendship that had meant so much to her, that had been
  really the most exciting, the brightest episode in her life, was ending, it
  seemed harsh to destroy these letters without glancing at them again and
  recollecting the warmth and the pleasure of those few weeks when she had
  received Susan's wholehearted confidence. She did not glance at the packed
  lines of Susan's crooked words, she read them carefully, intently, as she had
  never read them before, read them by the light of Susan's fear and distress
  and extravagant offer. Then she folded them up carefully and the blood showed
  in her face, making her appear younger, more comely.</p>

  <p>The letters were harmless, of course. Perhaps a little ambiguous. Susan
  expressed herself so poorly. Some of the sentences might mean what Mrs.
  Sacret until now had never for a second supposed they could mean, and that,
  of course, they could not mean.</p>

  <p>The gilt-edged sheets were returned to their envelopes and put aside
  resolutely, as if they had been a temptation. Still with that brilliant glow
  on her cheeks, Mrs. Sacret picked up the <i>Morning Post</i> and tried to
  read the column under SITUATIONS VACANT. But her glance strayed from the
  tedious familiar "wants" that she had never been able to satisfy. She felt a
  thrill of panic as the deadly fear touched her that possibly she would never
  be able to qualify even for the more humble posts. She had no impressive
  housekeeping experience, no talents as a companion, she was not much liked
  anywhere, had never been needed by anyone. She saw herself being interviewed
  by a prospective employer and sent away as "unsuitable," she saw herself
  entering her name on the books of a domestic agency&mdash;qualifications? A
  little amateur sick-nursing, a little meager housekeeping, a Dissenting
  background, no friends, no "references." I shall not come to that, she
  resolved, at once, but what is to prevent me&mdash;?</p>

  <p>She turned over and put down the paper and looked at the letters. She
  intended to burn them, but while they existed she felt important, even
  powerful, and she desired to prolong this sensation, even though she knew it
  was absurd. When the letters were destroyed she would, she was sure, feel
  unprotected, defenseless, of no consequence to anyone, even Susan. I suppose
  Susan would give me a reference, she thought. I could ask her for that, even
  if we were no longer friends. Mrs. Sacret stared at the folded sheet of
  newspaper. One word heading a paragraph took her eye.</p>

  <p>Blackmail.</p>

  <p>She hardly knew what it meant at first, then she knew, clearly. Taking up
  the paper she read the case.</p>

  <p>The journalist commented that "this horrible crime was rarely brought to
  light because social ruin awaited the victim who, at last, in f his
  desperation, appealed to the law, after having been bled of thousands of
  pounds for years. Many, in this terrible position, preferred suicide to
  exposure."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was fascinated by the prospect of unknown and terrible strata
  of life presented to her by these sentences; for the first time she stared
  over the edge of her own narrow world, for the first time realized how narrow
  it was. Crime. She never read even the rare and decorous reports of evil in
  the newspaper she only bought recently because of the SITUATIONS VACANT
  column. The Dissenting periodicals and pamphlets, the instructive and
  enlightening books published by Anglican societies filled her time and her
  mind.</p>

  <p>The reported case was gloomy and pitiful. A man, in his youth, had served
  a short sentence for petty theft. He had prospered under another name, and
  one who had known him in prison had blackmailed him for half a lifetime.
  "Commonplace," the judge had remarked, "and of a fiendish cruelty."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret reflected on that. She was in the midst of crime and cruelty
  in this vast city that she had always considered in terms of her modest,
  respectable home, the school that was beyond her father's means, the
  Dissenting chapel set, the wealthy set where Susan belonged, Minton Street,
  and High Street with the dingy shops and dingy people hastening or loitering
  along.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of those passers-by were criminals. "Commonplace," the judge
  had said. People like myself, she thought. I'm commonplace. Perhaps they look
  as I look.</p>

  <p>Blackmail.</p>

  <p>She had an impulse to thrust the letters into the center of the fire,
  between the bars, but was stayed by a sound uncommon in Minton Street, that
  of a carriage and horses.</p>

  <p>It was but a step to the window, and she was soon staring out of it. Susan
  was without, in an elegant barouche, behind a pair of spruce chestnuts, a
  footman was coming to the mean door, but his mistress, leaning forward, saw
  Olivia and waved to her with an anxious smile. So, there are menservants, if
  not in the house, reflected Mrs. Sacret. No moment to be filling the room
  with the smell of burning paper.</p>

  <p>She turned and thrust the letters behind the worn books of piety on the
  narrow shelf by the fireside. She felt excited because Susan had come to see
  her so soon and with such pomp. I certainly have an influence over her, and I
  must use it to her advantage. This reflection covered her real feelings that
  were confused, and unacknowledged, even to herself.</p>

  <p>The footman brought a request for Mrs. Sacret to join his lady for a drive
  in the park, but Susan followed him before her friend could answer.</p>

  <p>"The dear little room!" she exclaimed, glancing around the parlor
  nervously. "How well I remember it and how happy I am to be here!"</p>

  <p>She was prettily dressed in a mignonette green silk, with dark red roses
  in her bonnet, but she looked, to Mrs. Sacret's sharp gaze, tired and
  agitated.</p>

  <p>"You will come for a drive, won't you, Olivia? There is sunshine. Have you
  considered my proposal?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt so keen a sense of power over this eager anxious creature
  that she could not resist using it.</p>

  <p>"I have not had time, Susan. It is such an important matter. It would
  quite alter my way of life if I were to accept. I am not a very young woman."
  She crept behind the prosy tones and dreary platitudes of her husband's
  profession. "I am a widow. Frederick would have wished me to continue his
  work."</p>

  <p>"You are going abroad again, as a missionary! You did not tell me
  that!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was vexed at this interruption, given in a note of relief.</p>

  <p>"Really, Susan, you need not be so anxious to be rid of me! I shall not
  cross your path. I was about to write to you stating this. I did not suppose
  that you would call so soon."</p>

  <p>"Then you won't accept my offer?" asked Susan, stepping nearer, her bright
  clothes, hair and face making the room seem very dingy.</p>

  <p>"I said I had to think it over&mdash;really, I still don't understand
  it&mdash;so extravagant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have the money, my own money that Martin can't touch."</p>

  <p>"I know." Mrs. Sacret thought dryly of Susan's two fortunes, apart from
  her share in the Rue income. "But your suggestion was so unexpected. I have
  not even met your husband. He might not care for a third person in his
  house."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Martin often says, when I am moping, or cross, why don't you get a
  companion!"</p>

  <p>Susan was glancing around the room again, her gaze resting at last on the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"Did you burn the letters?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand why you worry so over those letters, Susan. Of course
  they are harmless, or I should not have kept them so long. I was reading them
  again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Reading them again?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I wanted to remind myself of those days when Frederick was
  alive, and we were all happy."</p>

  <p>"I was not happy. I nearly went out of my mind."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret scorned this confession of what she did not understand,
  passion. She considered Susan hysterical.</p>

  <p>"You soon married again, dear," she remarked softly.</p>

  <p>Susan pulled out her handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I do want you to live with me, Olivia. You have always helped
  me&mdash;from our school days&mdash;I am quite wretched&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Mrs. Sacret kindly. "You have so much."</p>

  <p>Susan gave three reasons for discontent; Martin was dominated by his
  mother, an odious old creature who lived at Blackheath; he was always fussing
  over his health and doctoring himself; and according to his own morose habits
  he kept his wife shut away from the life to which she was used.</p>

  <p>"How should I help you?" asked Olivia Sacret. "I am not entertaining. I
  know no one save some dull chapel people. I am outside London society."</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Susan. "The Rues are so eccentric they never have moved in
  any circles&mdash;and yet they won't know Father's friends, because he was a
  merchant, so I am really isolated. No one likes Martin very much."</p>

  <p>And you, thought Mrs. Sacret, have not the spirit to create your own
  life.</p>

  <p>"I know you are very religious," continued Susan ingenuously. "And Martin
  would not allow me to go to chapel. But I could attend church regularly."</p>

  <p>"Don't you now smiled Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I get such headaches! But that is because I am so moped. There is
  nothing to do all day."</p>

  <p>"It is ridiculous." Olivia Sacret spoke more to herself than to the other.
  "I must not think of such a thing! It is just a whim on your part, Susan,
  because you are out of humor."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, indeed, it is not&mdash;but if you don't like my silly frivolous
  life, I daresay it would be very boring to you&mdash;then I won't tease
  you&mdash;if you'll destroy the letters."</p>

  <p>"And if I don't destroy the letters?"</p>

  <p>"How can you be so cruel!"</p>

  <p>"Really, Susan! There is nothing in those letters&mdash;anyone might not
  see."</p>

  <p>Susan sighed deeply and twisted her hands in the pearl-colored gloves.
  "What do you want?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was startled at her own thrill of triumph. It was as if
  Fortune had knocked at her door, with both hands full of gifts.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said slowly. "It is rather late for me to be wanting
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," replied Susan eagerly. "You have never had a chance&mdash;you
  were always so bright and clever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But poor, Susan, and plain."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! You have such pretty coloring&mdash;your eyes and hair are just
  the tint of a ripe hazelnut&mdash;but those dreary clothes&mdash;Oh, I'm
  sorry, you are still in mourning&mdash;but I should like to see you
  handsomely dressed."</p>

  <p>"Would you? You are very generous."</p>

  <p>"Only burn those silly letters."</p>

  <p>"Of course. But&mdash;Susan&mdash;supposing I was to burn them,
  here&mdash;in this grate&mdash;now&mdash;would you still want me to live with
  you and to see me in fine clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;what do you mean, dear?" But the faltering tone, the
  quick flush, the averted glance betrayed Susan.</p>

  <p>The simpleton! thought Mrs. Sacret scornfully. She doesn't care for me in
  the least; she is frightened.</p>

  <p>Aloud she suggested that the horses had waited long enough; she would like
  the drive after walking the pavements so long, and she went swiftly upstairs
  to put on her bonnet and mantle.</p>

  <p>Halfway up she recalled that she had left Susan alone with the letters,
  and paused sharply. But what did it matter? I meant to burn them; besides,
  she will never think of looking behind the books.</p>

  <p>When she returned to the parlor she took the precaution of approaching and
  glancing at the fireside shelves. Behind the shabby volumes, the letters were
  still there. Susan was by the window, tapping her foot nervously.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>§ 4</h2>

  <p class="first">The luxurious drive was a keener pleasure than Mrs. Sacret
  had believed it could be; not only did she enjoy the comfort and the
  distinction of her position, she felt as if at last she was in her rightful
  place and that the social aspirations of the haberdasher's daughter and the
  squire's son, frustrated in themselves, had now been realized in her. This
  was what she really was, a lady, not a missionary's widow. Her marriage, the
  chapel, Jamaica, seemed now not to matter, even never to have happened.</p>

  <p>But her present elevation was a delusion; soon she would return to Minton
  Street and the search for a "situation."</p>

  <p>Susan chattered, but with a certain shrewdness, arising, Mrs. Sacret
  thought, from desperation.</p>

  <p>She tried to discover her friend's prospects and hopes of employment and
  was not easy to mislead on these subjects.</p>

  <p>"It must be very difficult for you, Olivia," she insisted. "It will be
  hard for you to find a position you like&mdash;you have been searching for
  months, haven't you? And though you are so clever, you haven't those horrid,
  dull qualifications needed for a good post."</p>

  <p>"Why do you think I am clever?" asked Mrs. Sacret sweetly. "I haven't been
  very fortunate, have I? Not done much with myself!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think," replied Susan, with one of those uncomfortable flashes of
  insight that even stupid people will show, "that you ever bothered enough
  with yourself. You were always rather tired and just did the easiest
  things."</p>

  <p>Yes, that was it, Mrs. Sacret agreed. She had always lacked enterprise,
  boldness; she had never made anything of herself. Oppressed by poverty and
  the frustration it brought, she had slipped into the only marriage that was
  offered, done her duty in an insipid way, tried to earn a living in a timid
  fashion, yet she had always felt a surge of rebellion, a potential daring. I
  must have been, truly, as Susan says, tired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed aloud. "I have been lacking in&mdash;much. And I am
  rather weary." Suddenly she disclosed herself. "I have been walking about
  London for months, looking for work, always disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Susan, grasping her friend's hand affectionately. "You
  must come with me and rest&mdash;even if only for a short time."</p>

  <p>"I might, dear," agreed Mrs. Sacret, as the horses turned out of the park,
  toward Minton Street. "That would not commit either of us to anything, would
  it?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>§ 5</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret prayed to god when she first entered the Old
  Priory that she might be enabled to help her friend, and she used those words
  when explaining herself to her Dissenting acquaintances. "I am trying to help
  a friend, who is lonely and not very happy. I do not know how long I shall
  stay with her."</p>

  <p>No one was interested, she had always been too aloof from the chapel, save
  when she mentioned her future address, then she saw a gleam of surprise and
  envy on several dull faces.</p>

  <p>They have to admit, she thought, that I have good connections and that I
  am what I always claimed to be, a gentlewoman.</p>

  <p>She resolved to take no money from Olivia; this was to be a visit, no
  business arrangement. She would stay three months at the Old Priory, then
  look for a situation, this time from a comfortable background, with more
  confidence, and among Anglican institutions. Dissent dropped from her easily;
  she found no difficulty in returning to a church that she had never really
  left. It would be so much more convenient and improve her standing in her new
  position. After all, she would not need to change her God or her prayers. "I
  do really intend to be of service to poor Susan," she assured this Deity and
  herself.</p>

  <p>It was gratifying to be able to pity Susan. A few days at the Old Priory
  showed Mrs. Sacret, trained in observation of her husband's flocks, her
  friend's commonplace troubles. Martin Rue had the appearance of a robust
  young man, blond, comely, a stolid Anglo-Saxon. But his temperament was that
  of a middle-aged invalid; an expensive education had left him incompetent in
  everything except perhaps his business of which Mrs. Sacret knew nothing,
  with no interests beyond his own ailments, his medicine chest and his
  hothouses.</p>

  <p>He was away frequently, either at the city offices of the bank&mdash;St.
  Child's&mdash;of which he was a partner, at his club, or with his mother.
  Although he received Mrs. Sacret civilly he warned her not to encourage Susan
  in "frivolity" and hinted that she was inclined to make acquaintances of
  which he could not approve, and that he had had "to drop" most of the people
  she had known when he married her, including her first husband's family, the
  Dasents, who belonged to a "fast military set." Mrs. Sacret with her landed
  gentry descent and her impeccable character was an exception to these
  strictures, but she felt a common dislike between herself and the master of
  the Old Priory.</p>

  <p>The idleness of the couple interested the guest, used to an ordered
  existence full of insistent, if futile, duties. Ever since her return to
  London her search for work had kept her occupied and fatigued. At the Old
  Priory there was nothing to do when the short daily routine was over.</p>

  <p>Susan was a fair if disinterested housekeeper. The servants were adequate,
  the house comfortable, her husband managed the menservants and the stables
  and grounds were as orthodox as the mansion; if there was no sign of taste in
  either, there was none of disorder. Mrs. Sacret suspected waste and
  extravagance on Susan's part, but these were well hidden. She had her own
  money as well as her allowance to make good any insufficiencies.</p>

  <p>After she had seen the cook and given her orders she had the empty hours
  on her hands. A visit to the shops, to the dressmaker, to the lending
  library, a call on some woman she hardly knew, or a visit from some such
  acquaintance, a drive in the park, such were Susan's days. She had no
  accomplishments and could not even play croquet or whist, tat or embroider,
  the only books she read were love stories. When she talked to her new found
  friend it was always of the past.</p>

  <p>The long heavy breakfasts were eaten in silence as Mr. Rue sat behind the
  <i>Times</i>; the long heavy dinners accompanied dragging conversations Mrs.
  Sacret found more tedious than silence. The master of the house had the
  dyspeptic's complaints of his food, the mistress of the house the nervous
  defense of the woman bored by both the man and his meals. After dinner Mr.
  Rue would go to his smoking room and Susan and Mrs. Sacret to the pleasant
  garden boudoir, as it was termed, and there while away the evening, Susan
  vaguely admiring her friend's active fingers, for Mrs. Sacret could not sit
  quite idle and would sew or embroider diligently. Once old Mrs. Rue came on a
  visit; her son was the only child of a late and brief marriage and she doted
  on him. A large, colorless, expensively dressed woman, she took on life and
  even brilliancy through emotion when she regarded her daughter-in-law. At
  once she was frankly menacing to Mrs. Sacret whom she asked into the
  luxurious bedroom always reserved for her at the Old Priory.</p>

  <p>"A queer idea for Susan to have a companion."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a companion. A friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh! It has been a long visit. A mistake to interfere between husband and
  wife."</p>

  <p>"I never interfere."</p>

  <p>"A third person in the house is awkward."</p>

  <p>"Not for Susan. She was so much alone."</p>

  <p>"I knew she had been complaining. She could find plenty to do if she
  looked after my son. Before he left home it took all my time to take care of
  him. He is very delicate."</p>

  <p>"This is his home now, isn't it? And I'm sure he doses himself too much;
  he should see a doctor, instead of making up his own medicines."</p>

  <p>The two women exchanged level looks of dislike.</p>

  <p>"You would hardly know anything about that, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"I do. I used to keep a dispensary and learned something of drugs."</p>

  <p>"You were a missionary, Mrs. Sacret. Church of England?"</p>

  <p>"My husband and I worked as Christians, Mrs. Rue. We never thought in
  terms of denominations."</p>

  <p>"I see, Dissenters," said the elder lady. "My son is High Church. You have
  a very pretty dress on, Mrs. Sacret&mdash;very fashionable for mourning.</p>

  <p>"Susan gave it to me," smiled Mrs. Sacret. "She has bought me a wardrobe.
  I had nothing fit for this house. She has her own money and it pleased her to
  spend it like this."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rue flushed at this cool defiance, and her faded eyes glanced
  contemptuously at the other woman's plain, well-fitted cashmere gown, with
  the delicate cambric collar and cuffs, and the ruffles and buttons of black
  velvet. Mrs. Sacret's hazel-colored hair was brushed to a pale shimmer and
  hung in a black chenille net. She wore jet earrings that set off her fine
  complexion.</p>

  <p>"You have discarded your widow's cap," said Mrs. Rue, with a shudder that
  shook her own starched and crape erection. "And before your year's mourning
  is over."</p>

  <p>"Does that matter to you?" asked Mrs. Sacret sweetly.</p>

  <p>The elder woman trembled, her fat fingers pulled at the glossy silk
  stretched over her fat knees.</p>

  <p>"This is my son's home. Susan should think of him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She does. Too much. Too often. She is afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean! Martin is the kindest of men!"</p>

  <p>"And Susan the meekest of women. Perhaps you're glad to have it confirmed,
  Mrs. Rue&mdash;for you must have known it, that Susan lives in fear of your
  son&mdash;of his grumbling, his bad temper, his snubs."</p>

  <p>"And she called you in to protect her, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps."</p>

  <p>"This is very insolent. I shall speak to Susan and you must go. You are
  making mischief, I can see that. You suddenly appear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret interrupted.</p>

  <p>"No, I was at school with Susan. I've always been in her confidence. I
  shall not leave unless I wish. Only Susan could make me."</p>

  <p>"She shall," declared Mrs. Rue, rising, shaking out her weeds; the two
  widows faced one another. "I shall desire her to do so."</p>

  <p>"Susan will never send me away. I told you she was very meek. Timid. She
  is afraid of me&mdash;also."</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Mrs. Rue, with an eager, pouncing look. "Because I am the
  stronger character."</p>

  <p>"You spoke as if you had a hold over her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A hold?" Mrs. Sacret smiled haughtily.</p>

  <p>"I always thought Susan might have something to conceal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you? How uncharitable of you!"</p>

  <p>The elder woman, intent on her own line of thought, ignored this and
  continued.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you knew her when she was making herself conspicuous with Sir
  John Curle, a married man."</p>

  <p>"I told you, I've known her since we were children."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" exclaimed Mrs. Rue, throwing all civility aside. "I understand you
  very well. You have everything to gain from Susan, you mean to stay here, in
  idleness, in my son's house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On Susan's money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She ought to hand it over to her husband."</p>

  <p>"So she has. Nearly all of it. Like a fool. But she has kept
  enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For what you want. I quite understand."</p>

  <p>"And so do I, Mrs. Rue."</p>

  <p>The elder woman suddenly lowered her panting voice.</p>

  <p>"It was a most unsuitable marriage for my son. A chance meeting at the
  house of a new acquaintance&mdash;and he became <i>infatué</i> with
  this&mdash;stranger. She was being <i>talked</i> about&mdash;a silly, common,
  frivolous creature." Mrs. Rue labored with her venom. "Of course my son soon
  found out his mistake." She paused, her gasp for breath was a sigh, she
  approached Mrs. Sacret and spoke confidentially. "If you <i>know</i>
  anything," she whispered, "it is your duty to tell my son&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What could I know?" asked Mrs. Sacret sweetly.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;usually&mdash;it's letters&mdash;indiscreet letters. If
  you had any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret slightly flinched and the other staring woman perceived
  this.</p>

  <p>"You ought, as a Christian woman, to show them to my son." She cast down
  her eyes and added, "He would be a good friend to you. He has
  influence&mdash;a position, whatever you want. He is, really, I repeat, the
  kindest of men."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret hesitated on the verge of extreme plain speaking but
  controlled herself, said "good afternoon" and left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>§ 6</h2>

  <p class="first">This blunt interview had been exhilarating to Olivia Sacret.
  She so seldom spoke frankly and there had been a minimum of hypocrisy about
  Mrs. Rue, who had as good as admitted that she suspected Susan of having an
  uncomfortable secret and her friend of using this as a "hold" over her.
  Moreover, the stout widow had practically offered to buy this secret, in
  order to ruin her daughter-in-law at a higher price than Susan could pay.</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was not shocked or alarmed; she was, however, extremely
  interested and her sense of power increased. Now she was important to Mrs.
  Rue as well as to Susan, she who had been so insignificant, even so
  slighted.</p>

  <p>This was the first time the letters had been mentioned since she had come
  to the Old Priory, but they were constantly in her mind and she kept them
  locked in a cashbox she had bought for this purpose, in the bottom of her
  chest of drawers, which was also locked. She admired Mrs. Rue's shrewd guess.
  How notable that both she and Susan had at once attached such importance to
  the letters! Indiscreet? No, they were quite harmless. Mrs. Rue had only
  surmised their existence, she would suppose them much more compromising than
  they were. Mrs. Sacret paused in her reflections at this word
  "compromising"&mdash;that was the word people used when they meant that
  indiscretion caused a doubt to be cast on a woman's reputation.</p>

  <p>She threw off the muffling sentence she had mechanically formed. Mrs. Rue
  wanted to ruin Susan, to be rid of the hated interloper, to regain her son.
  Therefore Mrs. Rue was prepared to deal with the stranger she had found
  unexpectedly at the Old Priory and whose presence she could only account for
  by&mdash;blackmail.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret used the word boldly to herself; she flushed, not with shame,
  but excitement. She was too sure of herself and her own motives to feel in
  the least abashed at the position in which she found herself. Susan felt
  embarrassed, if not guilty of&mdash;indiscretion. Mrs. George Rue had
  revealed herself as an odious person, mean, jealous, backbiting. Martin Rue
  cut a poor figure between his overbearing mother and his cowed wife. I must
  pray for all of them, reflected Mrs. Sacret. I must try to bring peace and
  good will to these unhappy people. Perhaps God sent me here just for
  that.</p>

  <p>She thought that possibly the consciousness of the worthiness of her
  intentions was giving her this stimulated energy; she felt more vital than
  ever before, her old existence shriveled away and she flexed her hand as if
  pulling strings. It was astonishing to her that she had spoken so sharply to
  old Mrs. Rue. She had never faltered before the sharp assaults of a woman so
  much older and better placed than herself; indeed, she had enjoyed her own
  forceful handling of the interview.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue had spitefully remarked on her elegant dress. Remembrance
  of this 'made Olivia Sacret look more earnestly than usual into her mirror.
  She was nearly a pretty woman, perhaps could easily be a pretty woman. A
  strange reflection, this in Susan's handsome cheval glass: the missionary's
  widow, in her mourning, the woman who had, years ago, parted with all
  expectations, all hopes of anything save a drab routine leading to the chapel
  burying ground.</p>

  <p>She smiled at herself. I'm still young. Of course, it is the rest, the
  good food, the good clothes. She did not add even in her thoughts, that it
  was also something else that flushed her smooth cheek and brightened her
  clear hazel eyes, the knowledge that she possessed power over other
  people.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>§ 7</h2>

  <p class="first">Susan, who had been confused and silly during dinner began
  to weep as soon as she was alone in the garden room with Mrs. Sacret. "You
  see how detestable Mrs. George Rue is?" she complained. "She only comes here
  to torment me! You heard how she sneered and showed me up! And Martin
  supported her!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Sacret. "And I don't understand how you endure it. Why
  don't you display some spirit? You have some of your own money&mdash;and you
  could make your husband give you what he invested for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should never dare to ask him!" sobbed Susan.</p>

  <p>"Instruct your lawyer, dear."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that would mean a shocking quarrel!"</p>

  <p>"As for that&mdash;isn't it a quarrel, now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not like that would be! Martin doesn't scold so when his mother stays
  away and when he hasn't just seen her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret reflected that she did not know the whole of the story of
  Susan and her husband; they spent hours together in the large formal bedroom
  and dressing room upstairs&mdash;perhaps they were not entirely estranged,
  nor Susan entirely open with her friend. Perhaps there was something in her
  marriage that Susan wished to keep. To Mrs. Sacret's taste Martin did not
  seem worth contending for, she found him slightly repulsive in spite of his
  youth and good looks that accorded so unpleasantly with his nervous nagging
  and intense concern with his health, a habit formed and encouraged by his
  possessive, ignorant mother. She was always able to get hold of him,
  reflected Mrs. Sacret, by fussing over his chest or his headaches&mdash;she
  made a coward of him for her own ends.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had had children," sighed Susan, pulling the long bell rope.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret rallied to this new topic that Susan had never touched on
  before.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I did not," she replied. "The responsibility would have been
  too great. They might have inherited Frederick's poor constitution. The Lord
  knows best."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, we both married invalids!" exclaimed Susan, wiping her eyes on
  her long lace handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Mr. Rue is an invalid, he has been cosseted by his mother;
  he doesn't take any exercise, either, and then, those medicines he makes up
  himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you are right," murmured Susan. "What can I do? I have no
  influence, and, as you say, dear, his mother encourages him in all his
  whims."</p>

  <p>"You had him alone in Florence. I wonder you persuaded him to go
  abroad."</p>

  <p>"I didn't. He thought the climate would be good for his chest. We had the
  dullest time! Martin sat on the veranda all day."</p>

  <p>"He should have been cured."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he caught a chill, the sun drops suddenly and the nights are
  bitter; really our room was like a vault at night and only a pan of charcoal
  with which to heat it."</p>

  <p>The maid entered and Susan ordered a bottle of sherry and some glasses to
  be brought.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret turned to her own affairs.</p>

  <p>"I have an applicant for my little house, Susan. I told you I put a card
  in the window? I found a letter on the mat, when I went there yesterday. From
  one Mark Bellis, a painter. I wrote to make an appointment with him."</p>

  <p>"I hope that means you are staying here indefinitely, dear."</p>

  <p>"Why, no. I thought I would let the house for three months, then I shall
  have rested and be able to go back. I can't afford to allow it to remain
  empty."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would permit me to give you&mdash;a&mdash;stipend," said Susan
  hurriedly and timidly.</p>

  <p>"You pay for my clothes, dear."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;pocket money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I could not. I have no expenses. I don't even pay anyone to look
  after the house. I do that myself. I have sufficient money. I'm here to help
  you, Susan. Not to make a profit for myself. I've to pay poor Frederick's
  doctor's account."</p>

  <p>Susan glanced at her swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Have you burned the letters, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>The servant brought in the sherry and two glasses. Mrs. Sacret waited
  until she had gone before replying.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten all about them, Susan. They are so unimportant."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. Where do you keep them?"</p>

  <p>"I believe they are in the bottom of my little trinket box," said Mrs.
  Sacret carelessly. "With some other dear souvenirs. Really I shall dislike to
  destroy your handwriting, reminding me of those happy days."</p>

  <p>She believed that she spoke sincerely, and she looked in a kindly fashion
  at Susan. But behind the kindness was curiosity. Susan drank two glasses of
  sherry in silence and her friend bent over her gossamer needlework.</p>

  <p>Martin Rue entered awkwardly on the privacy of the two quiet women, seated
  daintily in their satin and gilt chairs in the rosy glow of the silver lamp.
  He glanced at once toward the sherry bottle.</p>

  <p>"You drank enough at dinner, Sue," he rebuked abruptly. "A pint of red
  wine, and more than enough sherry for a lady&mdash;and why two glasses? Mrs.
  Sacret always says she doesn't drink alcohol."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but tonight I thought I would like a glass," smiled Mrs. Sacret
  coolly. "I often do&mdash;though I refuse it at table&mdash;drink a little
  sherry here with Susan. Do you object, Mr. Rue? Is the wine measured
  out?"</p>

  <p>"I like to keep a check on it," he replied with hostility. "The weekly
  expenses are very heavy."</p>

  <p>"I pay my own wine bills, Martin," whispered Susan, looking away from him.
  "You know that I have to have some to keep up my strength."</p>

  <p>"For what, pray?" he interrupted rudely. "And I wish you would not order
  wine&mdash;nasty stuff from the stores, fit only for bad cooking."</p>

  <p>"You always lock up yours," retorted Susan, flushing. "And please don't
  scold me so often, in front of Olivia, too."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Madam here knows all your secrets, of course!" exclaimed Mr. Rue with
  temper. "My mother says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret swiftly interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Does she, sir? Neither of us wish to hear what she says, do we,
  Susan?"</p>

  <p>Emboldened by this defiance, Susan gulped her third glass of sherry and
  agreed. "No, we really don't. We are sick and tired of your mother,
  Martin."</p>

  <p>"You dare to tell me that&mdash;with this&mdash;friend&mdash;of yours
  abetting you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Rue turned with a vulgar politeness to Mrs. Sacret. "Madam, I don't
  consider you a good influence on my wife. My mother supports me in asking
  that you bring your visit, your very long visit, to an end."</p>

  <p>"I shall leave when Susan desires me to do so, Mr. Rue." Mrs. Sacret had
  no difficulty in maintaining her composure; she felt fully justified in what
  she did and not in the least afraid of this bullying man. "I am protecting
  poor Susan from these two disagreeable people," she told herself, as if she
  were two entities, one of which dictated to and advised the other. "It must
  be God's wish I should do so."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is my house as well as yours," declared Susan with forceful
  feebleness. "And I'm sure that Olivia is the only company and the only
  comfort I get. Why do you want her to go?" she added tearfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, why, Mr. Rue?" Olivia Sacret covered up this weakness on her
  friend's part. "I never interfere with you and I cost you nothing."</p>

  <p>"That's as may be," he rejoined, with a full stare at her costly clothes,
  "but I like my house to myself."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow had some satisfaction in noting the crude defects
  in her opponent. She had met his type, considerably softened by austere
  training, in her chapel work. A mother's darling, a school bully, idle,
  stupid and vain, mean and ostentatious. He married Susan for her money
  without caring for her in the least, she thought. And now he would like to
  return to Blackheath and be pampered by that doting old woman again.</p>

  <p>Her fingers hurried over her needlework with delicate precision and an
  implied rebuke at idleness, while the unhappy couple remained sunk in a
  sullen silence. Susan drooped in her chair, staring from reddened eyes at the
  two stained glasses from both of which she had drunk. Her husband stood
  gloomily by the hearth, his hands in his pockets, his dark clothes out of
  place in the frivolous dainty room and the pink lamplight.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret considered him in a flashed glance, enjoying her dislike as
  she enjoyed her sense of power, for all keen emotions were new to her and
  therefore stimulating. She wondered if he had heard his mother's quick guess
  as to "a hold" over Susan, and possible "letters." She did not think so, he
  would have been more disturbed than he was, had this been so. Besides, old
  Mrs. Rue would have been very cautious with what might prove a precious
  weapon with which to oust her daughter-in-law. She would consider long before
  making what might be a false step.</p>

  <p>How ugly he is, she thought. His features are good, but his hair and
  complexion are tinged such a repulsive ginger yellow and his eyes are like
  gooseberries&mdash;such a hangdog expression, too. Yet I suppose he would be
  termed a fine-looking man.</p>

  <p>Martin Rue terminated what was to him an intolerable silence by ringing
  the bell and when the maid carne bidding her take away the sherry. "Your
  mistress has had sufficient."</p>

  <p>When the woman had gone, Susan broke into furious words. "Now you have
  insulted me before the servants! Everyone in the house will think I drink too
  much!"</p>

  <p>"They know it already. I said&mdash;<i>sufficient</i>."</p>

  <p>"Curtis knew what you meant. Oh, really I can't endure this life!" Susan
  moaned. "So dull, and you always scolding me! I am not to have a friend to
  stay with me, or even a glass of sherry! I must leave you&mdash;I really
  must&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pray, do, if you please. I too find this sort of thing
  unendurable&mdash;I must consider my health&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say a word!" cried Susan, heated, pretty and uncontrolled. "I'm
  sick of hearing of your health&mdash;and your nasty medicines! And that
  horrid Indian basket you keep in your room, full of disgusting drugs! I wish
  I could be divorced!"</p>

  <p>"Such things can be arranged," said Mr. Rue bitterly.</p>

  <p>Mrs Sacret rose.</p>

  <p>"I cannot sit here, and listen to this," she protested, folding up her
  needlework. "Divorce&mdash;arranged! Is that your respect for Christian
  marriage, Mr. Rue? I'll not hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need not have heard anything had you wished," he replied rudely. "You
  remained, listening for your own ends."</p>

  <p>"I stayed to protect your wife," said Mrs. Sacret, lifting her clear,
  bright, hazel glance to her opponent's heavy face. "Susan, dear, why not go
  to bed?" She helped her friend to rise. Susan stumbled in her long, frilled,
  pink dress. Her eyes were slightly blurred and beads of sweat showed on her
  brow and lip. Martin Rue made a sound of theatrical disgust. "Bah!"</p>

  <p>"Your wife!" cried Mrs. Sacret reprovingly. "And so pretty and gentle too!
  I don't know about such horrid matters, but surely she <i>could</i> get a
  divorce for your unkindness, Mr. Rue. And look at the state to which you are
  driving her. Yes, a divorce," she repeated, supporting Susan's florid beauty
  against her own firm shoulder, "and then you would have to return her all her
  money and she could live as she liked." Mrs. Sacret had said more than she
  had meant to say, but she did not check the flow of her quiet triumph. "Then
  I could see Florence and such places."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rue took a crude revenge.</p>

  <p>"I have my health to consider!" he shouted and flung out of the room,
  banging the door.</p>

  <p>"It was kind of you," murmured Susan, "not to give me away about the two
  glasses. I always order two in case you care to drink a little sherry and
  then I forget and drink from both."</p>

  <p>"Susan, that is an untruth. You know I never touch alcohol. And you use
  the two glasses deliberately to disguise how much you take. You really
  <i>do</i> exceed a little, dear. I know it is because you are so unhappy. And
  I won't tell anyone&mdash;though I fear they all know."</p>

  <p>"Could you not drink at dinner? Just a glass?" pleaded Susan. "You see, I
  must have it."</p>

  <p>"No. It would be wrong to do that. Why don't you try to get your money
  from Mr. Rue? Then you would be rich and could live as you pleased."</p>

  <p>"I would not dare," wept Susan, "the lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you are afraid of them, I daresay I could interview them for you. Now,
  you had better go to bed. I shall help you upstairs. You really have made
  yourself quite ill, one way and another."</p>

  <p>At the door, leaning on her friend's arm, Susan whispered, "Why did you
  say&mdash;'Then I could see Florence and such places'?"</p>

  <p>"So you heard! I was thinking out loud, I suppose. Foolishly!
  Only&mdash;if you <i>did</i> leave Mr. Rue I could go abroad with you for a
  short time."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to leave him. I couldn't face being disgraced, stared at and
  cut. Why do you want to see Florence?"</p>

  <p>"Susan, dear, you <i>have</i> drunk just a little too much wine. Do come
  upstairs, and lift up your dress and walk carefully."</p>

  <p>"You've seen Jamaica. I haven't&mdash;why do you want to see Florence?"
  persisted Susan obstinately. "I don't want to see Jamaica."</p>

  <p>"In Jamaica I was a missionary's wife, tied to an invalid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Susan interrupted. "I'm tied to an invalid&mdash;that is all he thinks
  of&mdash;his nasty medicines."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret hushed her, edged her up the stairs and to the door of her
  room; when the door opened she had a glimpse of that luxurious and forlorn
  apartment, formal, tasteless and chilly. The door to the dressing room was
  closed.</p>

  <p>"Shall I send Curtis up?"</p>

  <p>"No," mumbled Susan, walking unsteadily to the large double bed,
  glittering in red mahogany and inlaid brass.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret left her. "I daresay he often finds her like that in the
  morning, asleep in her clothes. What a fool she is! She will spoil her looks.
  She is still very pretty indeed, though. And with beauty and money and a good
  place in society&mdash;well&mdash;almost good society, she could not even
  find a gentleman to marry."</p>

  <p>Yes, that was the case. Martin Rue, whatever his birth and education, was
  no more Mrs. Sacret's idea of a gentleman than her own husband had been. She
  thought, with secret pride, of her father and this made her feel even more
  superior to Susan than before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>§ 8</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret met her prospective tenant by appointment at her
  house in Minton Street. He was the first applicant she had had, for there
  were many To LET notices in the dingy adjacent streets and there was no
  particular attraction about her property. She did not like the man's
  description of himself as "a painter"; the word to her represented
  unstability and ungodliness, but his letter had been well written though from
  an address that she knew to be humble and probably an apartment house in
  Pimlico. She had decided, if he had respectable references and seemed himself
  responsible, to accept him as a tenant and at a moderate rent. The rates were
  low, and any sum above those would be profit.</p>

  <p>The house she had once felt proud to own looked very mean and shabby as
  she considered it with a critical eye, going from room to room and adjusting
  the worn furniture and shabby curtains. When she had come to dust and air the
  place she had hardly noticed it; now, in mental comparison with the Old
  Priory, she felt slightly ashamed of it and startled to realize that it was
  her home and that she would have to return to it&mdash;and from that
  background earn her living.</p>

  <p>She sat down in the parlor, considering this intolerable prospect. Yes,
  suddenly intolerable. Why, this place was wretched, not even clean, compared
  to Susan's home where busy servants kept every inch of wood, stone and metal
  washed and shining.</p>

  <p>The bell rang and she sprang up, nervous from her own thoughts, not from
  fear of the newcomer. He can have it, she decided, with a touch of panic, for
  almost any price.</p>

  <p>She went to the front door, but a step from the tiny parlor across the
  narrow hall, and opened it wide.</p>

  <p>A young man stood on the small flagstone, between the railings of the two
  areas. It seemed absurd that he should be there, and yet Mrs. Sacret did not
  know why.</p>

  <p>"I am Mark Bellis," he said, raising his hat. "Mrs. Sacret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, please to enter, Mr. Bellis. This is the parlor."</p>

  <p>She preceded him, feeling subdued, a little shaken; she rallied her
  spirits, however, and said:</p>

  <p>"You know the exterior of the house. Shall I show you the rooms?"</p>

  <p>"If you will be so good."</p>

  <p>"As I said&mdash;the parlor&mdash;very modestly furnished, but all that is
  needful&mdash;a table, chairs, a bookcase, coal hod."</p>

  <p>"Yes, all that is needful."</p>

  <p>They were in the passage again. "A little room at the back that
  I&mdash;we&mdash;never used much." Gathering up her expensive mourning she
  went abruptly down the steep dark stairs to the basement. "A kitchen, a
  scullery&mdash;equipped&mdash;but I don't suppose that interests you."</p>

  <p>She did not look at him, and hastened upstairs; she heard him behind her,
  a quiet, firm tread such as had not sounded in this house in her memory. She
  showed him the two bedrooms, each with a single bed with a white honeycomb
  quilt, washed muslin at the windows, squares of drugget, and yellow varnished
  tables, chests and washing stands.</p>

  <p>"That is all." Still she did not look at him; she turned again and was
  quickly in the front parlor, that distinctive tread behind her; without
  facing him, she asked: "Does it suit you?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. I live alone, but my present apartment is too small. I have
  much lumber to store. What, please, Mrs. Sacret, is the rent?" Gazing at the
  floor, she answered:</p>

  <p>"Two pounds a week."</p>

  <p>"I could not pay that. I am a painter, not known. I do not earn much. The
  rent of this house cannot be above fifteen pounds a year. Good day."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was startled.</p>

  <p>"Don't go. You think I ask a high figure. You see me well dressed; that is
  because I am companion to a rich woman. My husband left me nothing but this
  house. The rent of it represents my sole means."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, it is too much for me."</p>

  <p>She looked as high as his hand on the doorknob.</p>

  <p>"How much would you pay?"</p>

  <p>"One pound a week. Far too high. But I don't wish to waste time looking
  farther&mdash;and it suits me, and since you make a point of the
  money&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No more than you do!" she flashed, looking up, then down again. "This is
  half what I expected&mdash;but I am not used to bargaining."</p>

  <p>"No? We have agreed, then?"</p>

  <p>"I shall want references."</p>

  <p>"I have none," he replied coolly. "I have been abroad, France, Italy. My
  friends are scattered&mdash;if I may think them friends. My present landlady
  will assure you that I have paid my rent for three months and been a quiet
  tenant."</p>

  <p>"Pay me six months in advance, then," demanded Mrs. Sacret, staring at the
  floor boards as if she saw through them, deep into another world.</p>

  <p>"I could not do that, Mrs. Sacret. I may be engaged to work for Mr. Fox
  Oldham at Lyndbridge House in Kent. If so&mdash;then I'll pay you for six
  months&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Portraits?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Mural decorations. For the home-coming of a bride."</p>

  <p>"Then you would have to live there&mdash;in Kent?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. None of it is certain yet. Will you let me this house, Mrs.
  Sacret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I suppose so. You'll pay something?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you were not used to bargaining. A sovereign. One week's rent
  from today."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were again at the level of his hand. She saw it place the gold
  coin on the mean table where she and her husband, then she alone, had had
  their dreary, tasteless meals.</p>

  <p>"Can you come here tomorrow, at the same time, to make an inventory of
  your possessions, Mrs. Sacret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Good day, then. And bring a receipt for the sovereign."</p>

  <p>He went. She heard two doors shut, then she raised her head and stared at
  the spot where he had stood.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>§ 9</h2>

  <p class="first">"I've let my little house, Susan."</p>

  <p>"Oh! For how long?"</p>

  <p>"It is not decided. I meet Mr. Bellis again tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Susan tried to forget her own discomforts and to show an interest in her
  friend's affairs, for she was conscious that for once Mrs. Sacret wanted to
  talk about herself. Sewing industriously in the rosy light of the silver lamp
  she recounted her interview with her tenant. Susan thought it sounded very
  dull and wondered why Olivia seemed so interested, even excited and
  pleased.</p>

  <p>"What was he like, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly know. I scarcely looked at him, or noticed. All I was thinking
  of was letting the house."</p>

  <p>"Why were you in such a hurry, dear? And a painter, you say. A stranger,
  without references&mdash;who would not pay in advance! I'm sure I don't know
  much about business&mdash;but I thought you did," said Susan candidly.</p>

  <p>"I liked him," admitted Mrs. Sacret, laying down her sewing. "He is
  different from anyone whom I have met before. He has traveled much, and knows
  much of people and things. He has some purpose in life&mdash;is bold and
  careless, yet sure and prudent. His presence makes life different. It would
  be impossible to be wearied in his company."</p>

  <p>"Yet you scarcely saw him!" exclaimed Susan, startled.</p>

  <p>"A glance was sufficient to tell me his&mdash;character&mdash;shall I
  say?&mdash;or his attraction?"</p>

  <p>"Then you let him have your house, on his own terms, because he fascinated
  you! How queer! Do tell me what he is like, Olivia. Of course you
  noticed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is extremely elegant. A gentleman. You would not suppose him to
  be a painter&mdash;not that I ever met one. He looks as if he were well to
  do. Not in the least as if he came from Pimlico lodgings. That is why I asked
  a high rent. He is about thirty-five years old. Neither dark nor fair&mdash;a
  bright color, like gold under brown in his hair and eyes&mdash;his complexion
  very healthy, yes, he is a fine, robust, healthy man."</p>

  <p>"How odd he wanted your house!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I could not let him go, he interested me. That, also, is odd."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret picked up her sewing and Susan sat in an uneasy silence. She
  felt, vaguely, that a new and hostile influence had entered her already
  troubled life. After a pause she probed her friend's intentions, looking with
  apprehension at the neat figure of Mrs. Sacret in the handsome mourning, her
  charming head with the hazel-colored braids bent so that her precise profile
  was edged by the rosy lamplight that struck dull gleams from her polished jet
  earrings and brooch.</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;staying with me&mdash;for a long time, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"How frightened you sound! Do you wish to get rid of me, as your husband
  and his mother do? I want to stay and look after you, dear. You are so
  undecided about your own affairs. You won't stand up for yourself. I should
  like to see you in possession of your own fortune&mdash;and happy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll never see that," replied Susan quickly. "Don't you understand
  yet&mdash;about John?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret thought that she did understand, better than she had
  understood yesterday, what Susan felt. Passion, fascination,
  obsession&mdash;these words had new meanings to her now.</p>

  <p>"Lady Curle is still alive," she said quietly. "You must not speak like
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then don't you speak of happiness," retorted Susan in a muffled desperate
  voice. "And pray do destroy those letters."</p>

  <p>"The letters! Always the letters! Of course I shall&mdash;but they are of
  no matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bring them down now."</p>

  <p>"There is no fire." Mrs. Sacret glanced at the pretty satin-embroidered
  screen, a design of lilies and tulips, that concealed the grate.</p>

  <p>"I can get some matches."</p>

  <p>"And make a smell, and a mess&mdash;really you are silly, Susan!"</p>

  <p>"You torment me&mdash;you don't mean to destroy them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush." Mrs. Sacret raised her clear eyes and Susan cowered slightly into
  her silk cushions. "You must not accuse me of unkindness. I have told you
  again and again I shall destroy the letters. But I mean to keep them a little
  longer because you have done something wrong, Susan. I told you they were in
  my trinket box, and you went into my room and looked for them."</p>

  <p>"How do you know!" cried Susan wildly.</p>

  <p>"I arranged the things in a certain way and they were turned over. I don't
  suspect the maids. They have never touched anything of mine. But just after I
  told you about the letters the box was tampered with. How silly you are!" she
  added scornfully. "If I had had anything of value I should have locked the
  box&mdash;you ought to have thought of that."</p>

  <p>"Of value&mdash;you <i>do</i> think those letters of value, then?"</p>

  <p>"Of sentimental value. I told you."</p>

  <p>"Were they ever there? Did you move them? Was it a trap?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I chanced to move them. It is wrong of you to talk so
  recklessly&mdash;of traps."</p>

  <p>"Olivia, I shall give you my new diamond bracelet if you'll destroy those
  letters!"</p>

  <p>"Susan, please. I cannot wear diamonds. Do think. And that sounds like a
  bribe. It is quite insulting. The letters are worth nothing. I meant to tear
  them up, in front of you&mdash;as small as snowflakes&mdash;and throw them
  away from the carriage when we were driving, one day, in the park&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, why didn't you!"</p>

  <p>"Because you tried to steal them."</p>

  <p>"A punishment! I suppose that was how you were brought up&mdash;to punish
  people."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was. And I was punished, too. At home, at school, as Frederick's
  wife. Not only for what I did, but for what I was. One pays for that, you
  know, Susan."</p>

  <p>"You are harsh. Used to dealing with those wretched heathen."</p>

  <p>"I'm your best friend, Susan."</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Rue entered, glancing with equal hostility at the flushed beauty
  of her son's wife and the nut brown elegancy of Mrs. Sacret. She stared
  ostentatiously at the low table with the painted porcelain top on which Susan
  usually had the bottle of sherry and the two glasses. Tonight it was empty
  and old Mrs. Rue raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Tea," she remarked, seating herself heavily. "Could we have some
  tea&mdash;so much better for one than wine in the evening, don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>Susan rose and hastened out of the room.</p>

  <p>"There!" exclaimed her mother-in-law, with a complacent shrug. "You see
  how nervous she is! The least word and she is off in a tantrum! I only asked
  for tea."</p>

  <p>"You reminded her that Mr. Rue has forbidden the servants to serve wine
  except at table," replied Mrs. Sacret coldly. "You never have tea here. And
  seldom join us of an evening."</p>

  <p>"Hoity-toity! You can't put me out," replied Mrs. Rue. "I understand you
  perfectly well. I've asked you to leave and my son has asked you to leave.
  And you are brazen enough to stay. For no good purpose, of course."</p>

  <p>"To help Susan. I feel it my duty."</p>

  <p>"Sunday school, Dissenting talk!"</p>

  <p>"I was baptized into the Church of England. I attend church with
  Susan."</p>

  <p>"More genteel, I suppose, than the chapel. Really, you have done very well
  for yourself, Mrs. Sacret&mdash;considering what you are."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I <i>have</i>, Mrs. Rue."</p>

  <p>The elder lady leaned forward, there was a stir of the scent the chemists
  term "violet" from the rice powder on her sagging face and the mauve velvet
  ribbons on her lace cap. "Are you going to tell me about the letters?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean, Mrs. Rue." Olivia Sacret rose. "Black
  mail."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret slightly winced. The word was familiar to her mind, and she
  had never forgotten the look of it in print, as she had seen it in the
  <i>Morning Post</i>. But this was the first time she had heard it spoken.</p>

  <p>"You have a vulgar mind," she sneered.</p>

  <p>"Susan doesn't really like you," retorted Mrs. Rue resolutely. "She
  wouldn't have you here if she wasn't afraid of you. And she wouldn't be
  afraid of you unless you had a hold over her. And it's likely to be letters.
  About that married man she got herself talked of with. She's silly enough to
  have sent some of his to you&mdash;for sympathy or advice&mdash;or perhaps
  you stole them." Mrs. Rue took a small tin box from her pocket and helped
  herself to <i>mauve cachets</i>. "Or she wrote to you, giving herself
  away."</p>

  <p>"Would she be so frightened," asked Mrs. Sacret scornfully, "of what is
  past?"</p>

  <p>"Susan is very timid&mdash;and could never face disgrace. And what
  disgrace ever is past?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret knew that this was true. Susan could never endure any scandal.
  Though she seemed to have nothing to lose in her present life she clung to it
  desperately, because it was, in a way, safe and respectable. Her friend would
  not admit this to old Mrs. Rue. Once more she pointed out that Susan could
  demand all her money from her husband, and depart, a wealthy woman, for some
  fashionable Continental spa.</p>

  <p>"That is your plan, I can see," replied old Mrs. Rue. "You want to fasten
  on her and take her away&mdash;to keep you in luxury. You won't succeed.
  Susan hasn't the courage."</p>

  <p>"You are confused," retorted the other woman. "If you believe that I
  am&mdash;that I have a hold&mdash;over Susan&mdash;and she thinks so much of
  her&mdash;good name&mdash;then I could make her do as I wished."</p>

  <p>The two widows, one so dowdy, one so elegant, stared at one another. The
  elder was taken aback, she scowled. If this wretched creature was
  blackmailing Susan it would be true that she could make that weak, foolish
  woman do as she pleased. Yet Susan could hardly leave her husband and go
  ahead without that slur on her reputation she so much dreaded. Old Mrs. Rue
  thought rapidly. It would suit her quite well to be rid of her
  daughter-in-law in this manner. Martin would return to her and all would be
  as it had been at Blackheath. But it would not suit her for Martin to return
  to Susan the large sums of money she had so foolishly given him. Old Mrs. Rue
  termed herself prudent and that it would be "a sin" to trust Susan with her
  large fortune that she would not know how to manage, and that this designing,
  wicked Mrs. Sacret would certainly get from her once she had separated her
  from her husband.</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret guessed what she was thinking. A mean old woman, close
  fisted as her son. It was strange they had not induced Susan to part legally
  with her money. Probably her father's and her first husband's lawyers looked
  after her affairs and what he could not obtain lawfully, Martin had had to
  wheedle out of Susan.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. Rue sighed, sucking her cachets. She had never had to deal with
  anything like this before, but she did not feel unequal to the situation.
  Ever since Martin had married the detestable Susan, his mother had been
  prepared for anything unpleasant, even Mrs. Sacret did not surprise her. Just
  what I should have expected of Susan, she reflected, to know a horrible woman
  like this and get into her clutches.</p>

  <p>"I'll go to bed," remarked Mrs. Sacret; her soft, pretty voice held no
  note of malice or exasperation. She shook out the folds of her fine black
  silk dress with the crape borders.</p>

  <p>"We've settled nothing," protested old Mrs. Rue, "the letters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never admitted there were any compromising letters. For that is what
  you mean, Mrs. Rue. And there is nothing to settle&mdash;or that we ever
  shall settle," she added in an even softer tone.</p>

  <p>The elder widow, looking at her malignantly, thought, Why, she's
  pretty&mdash;as pretty as Susan, in a different style. Younger than I
  thought, also. And hated her the more vehemently. But controlled her hatred.
  She had now decided that she would prefer her son to keep Susan and her
  money, sooner than part with both. But whatever "hold" Mrs. Sacret had over
  Susan must be transferred to her, Amelia Rue, so that she, and she alone,
  could keep Susan cowed and obedient. She did not doubt that she would have to
  pay heavily for this odious intruder's secret&mdash;and she began her
  bidding.</p>

  <p>"I, as well as Susan, could give you what you want&mdash;say, a visit
  abroad. Isn't that what you desire?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret laughed and the other woman was startled. She had never heard
  Mrs. Sacret laugh before, or a sound like that, so cool, heartless and
  amused.</p>

  <p>With no more than that laugh, Mrs. Sacret went upstairs. In her own room
  she stood thoughtfully regarding a sovereign that she took out of the drawer
  of her dressing table where she had hidden it under a pile of lawn
  handkerchiefs.</p>

  <p>What, she wondered, had he been thinking of, when he had offered her that
  piece of gold, after their rapid and sordid bargaining? Did he recognize the
  falsehoods her statements about herself implied? That she had tried to cheat
  him over the rent because it had seemed easy to do so? Probably he had lied
  also. No references. An adventurer. What did he want with her mean little
  house, he in his smart broadcloth and fine linen, with his freshly shaved
  cheek and glossy hair?</p>

  <p>It has nothing to do with me, as long as he pays his rent. Her thoughts
  turned, as they had turned on the occasion of her reading the paragraph on
  the blackmail case, to that vague, wide world about her, filled with people
  of whose lives and means of existence she knew nothing, of whose sins and
  follies she could only guess at random. A world that might be extremely
  exciting, that aroused unsuspected curiosity in her ignorance, as her duel
  with old Mrs. Rue and her sense of power over Susan had aroused unsuspected
  passions, as her meeting with the unplaced stranger had aroused an
  unaccountable stir of fascination such as she had never known before. Her
  past life, viewed from her present vantage point, seemed incredibly dull,
  like a waterless, featureless plain glanced at, backwards, from a mountain
  side. How had she endured her barren childhood, the humiliations of her
  poverty-blighted school days, her marriage to a Dissenting, invalid
  missionary, those years in Jamaica where she had been cut off from everyone
  save a handful of fellow zealots and Negroes, to her unsympathetic and aloof
  temperament, as degraded as slaves.</p>

  <p>She checked her thoughts, reminding herself, without conscious hypocrisy,
  that she must, in all things, do the will of God, that she must try to
  protect and reform Susan. She had already been a good influence over that
  wayward creature. Susan was drinking less wine lately. Sherry would never be
  served in the garden room again, not only because Mr. Rue had forbidden this,
  but because Olivia Sacret had said, "Susan, if you really <i>need</i> a
  little sherry wine, for your health, I shall buy a bottle and keep it in my
  room. And so you can sometimes have a little, a very little, without annoying
  your husband or being talked about by the servants."</p>

  <p>Susan had been grateful for this suggestion and Mrs. Sacret now reminded
  herself that she must buy the sherry tomorrow when she visited Minton Street
  and bring it to the Old Priory in the small carpetbag that had belonged to
  Frederick.</p>

    <p class="caption">"So Evil My Love" &mdash; A Scene from the Film</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>She weighed and turned the gold piece in her hand as if it had been
  something unusual and precious. She reflected that she had never possessed a
  jewel nor any ornaments beyond the few silver brooches and bracelets engraved
  with ferns and ivy leaves given her by her mother on her birthdays, and the
  simple cross she always wore that had been her husband's wedding gift. She
  found pleasure in the delicate lawn as she replaced the coin. Until she had
  come to the Old Priory her handkerchiefs had been cotton. She had not
  realized that pleasure could be found in luxury because both pleasure and
  luxury had been so outside her experience. She trembled, turning toward the
  bed with the satin coverlet where she would kneel "to say her prayers" as the
  pat phrase ran mechanically in her mind. Her thoughts were not heavenwards.
  Susan had offered her a diamond bracelet. Absurd, indecent for a poor
  missionary's widow in heavy mourning. But for the first time in her life Mrs.
  Sacret reflected that her wrist was white and slender, her arm round and well
  shaped and that she would like to experience the odd sensation of seeing
  diamonds clasp the firm flesh, never yet adorned, always hidden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>§ 10</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret arrived early at her house. Some of her
  neighbors coming along the narrow streets with baskets of spring greens and
  onions stopped to speak to her. She regarded these women as very inferior
  beings and never gossiped with them, but today she listened to their
  inquisitive comments on her departure from Minton Street and her new tenant.
  Apart and agreeable in manner, she told them nothing and went into her
  cramped parlor to wait for the painter. The place seemed intolerably lonely.
  Under her prim disguise, of a woman in mourning, intent on sober business,
  was an increasing excitement and enthusiasm, a rising recklessness, ready to
  gush out and overwhelm her staid conventionality. An organ-grinder was
  playing at the corner; as she opened the window the luscious Italian melody
  fell on her expectant ears with a pleasure she had not known before from any
  music. She took off her widow's bonnet and veil and passed her pretty hand
  through her pretty hair, loosening the plain braids so that slender tendrils
  fell over her small ears and jet earrings. She felt, suddenly, that life
  would be unbearable if he did not come, if his taking of the house should
  prove to be a mere whim or jest.</p>

  <p>Then, on this pang of emotion she saw him, coming around the corner,
  moving swiftly between the dinner hour loungers in fustian, coat and sealskin
  cap.</p>

  <p>She admitted him at once, invited him into the front room and began to
  speak, without looking at him.</p>

  <p>"My friends&mdash;with whom I live&mdash;advise me against you. You have
  stirred the curiosity of my neighbors. They tell me you have asked about
  several houses around here and made inquiries of me before you wrote to
  me."</p>

  <p>"I also wanted references." She knew, without seeing him, that he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why? I let the house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted, but civilly.</p>

  <p>"I wished to know if Mrs. Sacret was old, tedious and foolish&mdash;I
  could have no dealings with such. A missionary's widow&mdash;that was very
  different." His tone was subtly mocking.</p>

  <p>"Shall we take the inventory?" she asked. "Do you really think it worth
  while? A beetle trap in the kitchen, a hassock here, a straw beehive chair,
  drugget in place of carpet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have noticed these details for myself, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"This is not a street where painters&mdash;artists&mdash;men like you
  live. There is no studio here."</p>

  <p>"There is all I require."</p>

  <p>"We bargained yesterday, did we not? If you don't need an inventory, and I
  don't, I only have to give you these." She took the key of the house and a
  receipt for a sovereign from her pocket and laid them on the stained rosewood
  side table where yesterday he had put down the gold piece. "You can send your
  rent to the address from which I wrote."</p>

  <p>She paused, feeling the moment wholly in his power.</p>

  <p>"Will you allow me to sketch your portrait?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was expecting that," she returned swiftly. "One of these women warned
  me. They are shrewd, these common people. 'He's up to no good,' she said. 'He
  thinks you've come into money and will try to get around you. He's been
  asking about the neighborhood and has heard about you.' That is what my
  neighbors think themselves, that I have come into money."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose they would," he replied coolly and left her to continue
  her explanation.</p>

  <p>"Because I was very poor and looking for a post, and suddenly left Minton
  Street in a carriage and pair, and am well dressed. But I am as poor as I
  ever was. I have nothing."</p>

  <p>"Does that concern me?" he asked. "And why should you in your fearless
  innocence trouble what the gossips say of one who is, obviously, an
  adventurer?"</p>

  <p>"You admit that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Are not we all adventurers, who leave rigid conventionalities behind
  us? Your husband was one when he went abroad as a missionary. You were
  another when you went to the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>"No doubt." His words pleased her; she felt protected by "fearless
  innocence" and raised her head as if guardian angels shielded her. "I had to
  help a friend in trouble. God guided me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps a divine cicerone brought me to Minton Street, Mrs. Sacret. May I
  sketch your portrait?"</p>

  <p>Her cheeks tingled; she covered her shock at his near blasphemy by
  replying quickly, "Do you want to prove to me you really are a painter?"</p>

  <p>"By no means. I doubt if I could. You are probably too ignorant to judge
  my capacity from my work."</p>

  <p>"I have some taste. This house is drab, almost squalid. Poverty and
  discouragement, Mr. Bellis. But I have taste."</p>

  <p>"I perceive it in your costume. You have contrived to make the grotesque
  weeds you wear becoming."</p>

  <p>"Yes, becoming to a missionary's widow. These are the first fine clothes I
  have ever had," she said, thinking, and the first flattery. "You'll come?
  Say, the day after tomorrow, at eleven o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come." She caught back the words&mdash;"you know it," and picked up
  her bonnet, adjusting it without a glance at either the man or the mirror,
  and left the house, taking with her the carpetbag in which she meant to
  conceal the bottle of sherry from the local wineshop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>§ 11</h2>

  <p class="first">The volatile Susan was in high spirits. Old Mrs. Rue had
  returned to Blackheath; she had her own dependents and affairs she could not
  leave long untroubled, and though she would undoubtedly soon return to her
  son's house, Susan was never inclined to think of the future. The hag has
  gone, reflected Mrs. Sacret, to consider her next move.</p>

  <p>She rejoiced with Susan and gave her a light account of the new
  tenant&mdash;"an eccentric fellow, who traveled about&mdash;a kind of
  journeyman painter, who wants a place to keep his canvases and paints. We are
  taking an inventory of my things&mdash;a tedious task. I shall go over every
  morning for an hour or so."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can take you in the carriage, on my way to the park."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'll walk over. I have several little affairs to settle in the
  neighborhood."</p>

  <p>"Walk, all that way!" Susan was disturbed, her fine eyes cast an appealing
  glance at her friend.</p>

  <p>"And I can do some errands for you," said Mrs. Sacret firmly. "Match your
  silks. Make inquiries for the goldfish you wanted. And the aeolian harp for
  your window&mdash;and see Miss Sermoine for you. And there is the sherry to
  fetch. I think it would be an excellent plan for Miss Sermoine to come and
  help you with your music," she added sweetly.</p>

  <p>"I don't care about music, really," sighed Susan, with a desolate glance
  at the grand pianoforte, draped with a pale, yellow silk shawl that twisted
  around a bowl of hothouse orchids, chocolate and green patched.</p>

  <p>"It is an employment for you, Susan. You are so idle. I cannot be with you
  always. And when I am not with you, you sit and mope, or read silly
  novelettes."</p>

  <p>"You know that Martin doesn't want me to see company, save his friends,
  and they are so dull and seem to spy on me, and I don't care about
  it&mdash;but pianoforte playing doesn't attract me. Perhaps I might have a
  little dog&mdash;a spaniel?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Though they are such noisy, nasty creatures. The goldfish are
  better as pets."</p>

  <p>"They, too, are dull," protested Susan timidly.</p>

  <p>"What <i>do</i> you want, dear? I can't give my whole time to amusing
  you." Mrs. Sacret smiled up, gently, from her sewing.</p>

  <p>"You said that before&mdash;do you want to leave me, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"No. I came to help you. At first I gave you <i>all</i> my time. Now, I've
  some affairs of my own to attend to&mdash;the chapel people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you are Church of England, now."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I had friends at the chapel. Then there are members of
  Frederick's flock in London."</p>

  <p>"Bring them here. It would be a diversion."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! That would never do. They would consider it very strange to see
  me here, in this luxury. And idleness. For I could not explain what I do for
  you, Susan. And you would find them dull. That is quite a favorite word of
  yours, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"I daresay." Susan sighed listlessly. "At least that horrid old woman has
  gone and I felt in better spirits."</p>

  <p>"Why have they fallen again? What <i>do</i> you want, Susan?"</p>

  <p>Challenged a second time, Susan turned her lovely, flushed face toward her
  friend and replied with childish abandon. "I want to go away&mdash;with
  someone I love&mdash;and be true to myself and have a proper home. Sometimes
  I wish I had been a wicked woman and run away with John.
  Away&mdash;away!"</p>

  <p>"Fie, that is a shocking thing to say. You have such loose principles,
  Susan. No wonder Mr. Rue is so watchful and jealous&mdash;and his mother,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are, Olivia. And you've admitted it. Pray do give me those
  letters&mdash;I don't care what I pay! Just suppose Martin or that detestable
  old woman should get hold of them!"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Susan, you must not get so excited. The letters were written
  in&mdash;fearless innocence&mdash;you must not think of them as if they were
  something evil. Nor insult me by talking of <i>buying</i> them. They are safe
  with me."</p>

  <p>"For pity's sake destroy them!"</p>

  <p>"Why, so I shall, as I've promised you a dozen times. But I'm not going to
  do anything theatrical or silly as if these harmless letters were important.
  When you have forgotten about them, then I shall quietly tear them up. So
  don't tease me about them, Susan."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>§ 12</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret approved of the litter in her once neat parlor;
  the painting stand with the shallow drawers, the deal table laden with
  portfolios, crayons, sketchbooks and pans of color, the light easel and the
  large chair with the horsehair cushion, placed in the corner, firmly on a
  stout wooden box, with brass corners and padlock.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellis said that this room was suitable for sketches and drawings to
  be made in a plain or garden light, after the manner of a map or heraldic
  design. Upstairs he had stored his oils and canvases.</p>

  <p>"You want to know who I am," he added with his cool smile. "And I think
  you are the only person in London who cares. So I'll tell you. But you must
  look at me, please. I can't draw you with your eyes always downcast."</p>

  <p>She raised her brilliant hazel glance and trembled as she mounted, under
  his direction, the raised chair. It was as if she had dreaded to find him
  repulsive and had not dared to face some suspected and dreaded horror. But
  forced to look at him, she found he was attractive, fascinating, as she had
  known he was, and the haze of horror that had clouded her mental image of him
  and her visions&mdash;for every night since she had first met him she had
  dreamed of him&mdash;vanished. "I don't belong to this labyrinth of London,"
  he said gravely. "The houses and streets, miles of them, the stench and the
  fog, the smoke and the dirt. When it comes to telling you where I've been all
  my life&mdash;I don't know that I can."</p>

  <p>He was older than she had thought at first, but robust and healthy with
  the quick, neat movements of an athlete; his clothes were precise and his
  linen fresh.</p>

  <p>"I had a good education," he continued, "ran away from college and was
  disowned. I went aboard ship as a youth. And did a number of things. I've
  searched for gold in California, caught wild horses on the Pampas, driven
  cattle in Mexico, stayed in large cities and learned to paint. Made money by
  that. I always wanted to draw. I see in pictures more easily than words. They
  are clearer and safer."</p>

  <p>"Did you find gold?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But not in California." He selected a sheet of paper and a crayon.
  "Now I'm neither rich nor poor. Neither tramping, or settled down. Will you
  please sit with your head so, three-quarters to me, your bonnet in your
  hand&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This yellow shawl? I shall remove it She recalled the other yellow shawl
  on Susan's pianoforte.</p>

  <p>"Inappropriate, you think? I shall not show the color. I need the
  line."</p>

  <p>"Have you no more to relate of yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Too much. That is all there is for you, Mrs. Sacret. You will see that I
  have preserved a respectable appearance despite my wanderings."</p>

  <p>He did not indeed look like a man who had lived roughly for years; there
  was no trace of vice or weakness in his face, and Mrs. Sacret was able to
  recognize both from the countenances of passers-by on the city pavements.</p>

  <p>"I neither drink to excess, gamble at all, nor smoke," he remarked. "So my
  wits are fairly sharp and my hand fairly steady."</p>

  <p>"Have you been long in England? Have you visited your family?"</p>

  <p>"Three months. I have no family&mdash;no one who cares if I am alive or
  dead." He smiled cheerfully, pinned the paper to a board and set in on the
  easel. As he began to draw he began to question Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>At first she defended herself. "I've nothing to tell. Nothing." She gave a
  flat outline of her life. "That is all."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in Mr. Rue's house?" he asked quietly, coming to the
  very center of the very heart of her secret, with the directness of one
  following a guiding thread through a maze.</p>

  <p>"I told you. Mrs. Rue is unhappy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Tell me more. Why not? If you have not come into a fortune as the gossips
  think&mdash;you have had some good fortune lately, after a hard existence and
  a long waiting. You have nothing you say, Mrs. Sacret, except&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>His quiet voice and brilliant look that stared a little, as if he forced
  his lids up, were so compelling that she almost replied "the letters" and
  flushed at her own weakness.</p>

  <p>"Pray don't pinch your lips so, I am drawing them. Why not tell
  me&mdash;your affairs? As you have nothing to give I cannot beg or steal
  anything. I may be gone&mdash;in a few days, if I don't get that work in
  Kent. Perhaps you need a little advice or comfort. You seem as lonely as I am
  myself. And you are a very pretty woman to be so unprotected."</p>

  <p>These words, not spoken in a flattering tone, stirred in Mrs. Sacret an
  emotion unknown to her, one so delightful that it absorbed her whole being,
  almost to the extent of stifling her native shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"There," continued the painter, stepping back from the easel, "that is
  sufficient for today&mdash;you are beginning to lose the pose." He did not
  offer to assist her from her raised chair; she descended carefully, crossed
  the floor and stood behind him. There was her likeness, for her to see.</p>

  <p><i>Olivia Sacret</i> he had scrawled across the bottom of the paper. The
  study was in red, black and white crayons; every curve of face and limb,
  sweepingly accentuated, the gloss of the hair, the brightness of the eyes,
  the grace of throat and hands indicated in clear lines, the elegance of the
  mourning gown lightly touched in. So the missionary's widow was revealed to
  herself. She changed as she gazed. "You're clever," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have had to live by my wits. So far they have not failed me."</p>

  <p>"You have finished?" she asked. "I thought you would take days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must come again," he replied, answering her thought. "You do not need
  the excuse of the portrait&mdash;or if you do," he added carelessly, "say, I
  still require you to pose for me."</p>

  <p>She was irked because he was so sure of her, but this was a slight blemish
  on her increasing excitement. "What do you want?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Money. Not to hoard. To spend. I live roughly for years, then I think of
  luxury, and somehow find the means for luxury."</p>

  <p>"Through your painting?"</p>

  <p>"No. I told you&mdash;this is a livelihood&mdash;not luxury. I hope to be
  employed at Lyndbridge House, as I told you. I met Mr. Fox Oldham in Paris
  where I exhibited a picture. He was on his way to Switzerland with his bride
  who is not strong&mdash;as they say." He faced her suddenly, standing so
  close that their arms almost touched. "You think that you can look after
  yourself, Mrs. Sacret, but really you are quite helpless. You know nothing
  about life at all. Other people have always decided everything for you."</p>

  <p>This was, Mrs. Sacret reflected, true, though she had never admitted as
  much before. Her existence had followed the pattern set by her parents, then
  that set by her husband. When she had been left alone, she had gone on,
  mechanically trying to obtain a position that would mean a continuation of
  the life she had led with Frederick Sacret. Her only original action had been
  to introduce herself into the Rue household and then she had been hesitant,
  ineffective, not really knowing what to do, what she wanted, at least not
  confessing so much to herself. She thought of the three people she was
  engaged in dealing with and confusion blurred their outlines and her own
  motives. Nor had she really faced the problem of the letters.</p>

  <p>"You are puzzled," remarked the painter, observing her closely.</p>

  <p>"And not least by you," she replied with a flash of spirit. "I have never
  met anyone like you before&mdash;never had&mdash;a chance acquaintance." She
  glanced meaningly at his well-shaped, well-kept hand, resting on the easel.
  "I don't think I believe your tales of a rough wandering&mdash;gold
  prospecting&mdash;wild horse taming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whereas I," he interrupted, "believe every word you tell me of
  yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rut I have told you nothing&mdash;save a bare outline&mdash;and there is
  little to tell. I am a simple woman who tries to do the Lord's will."</p>

  <p>She expected a laugh or a sneer, but he was gravely silent. "Good-by," she
  added, leaving everything in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Mrs. Rue would care for me to sketch her likeness," he suggested.
  "Will you recommend me?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied at once, though instantly thinking how Susan would
  snatch at such a diversion.</p>

  <p>"Then I may sketch you again? Or call on you at your friend's house?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't want you at the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>"I can produce credentials," he smiled. "I should not play the vagabond
  before this respectable family."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret flushed. She knew this stranger was probably better born and
  certainly better bred than the Rues, than anyone she had known, save her own
  father. Indeed, she could persuade herself that she felt a keen class
  affinity with the painter, as if they were two aristocrats among vulgar
  people.</p>

  <p>"I'll confide in you," she said in a low hurried voice. "It is true that I
  am oddly alone. Most women have someone&mdash;Susan Rue is really my only
  friend&mdash;I am staying with her as a&mdash;companion&mdash;but I don't
  take money, of course&mdash;only a few presents. Her husband is not kind to
  her&mdash;he wants me to leave&mdash;so does his mother. I don't quite know
  what to do."</p>

  <p>"Please sit down." He brought forward one of her own shabby chairs.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I shall go in a moment. It is an&mdash;unpleasant
  position&mdash;but I have no resources. I thought if&mdash;Susan left her
  husband&mdash;we might go abroad together. She is very rich. Her husband
  holds most of her money. I want her to get it back."</p>

  <p>She ventured to glance at the painter. He was looking at her from his dark
  eyes against which the lashes shone thick gold. There was a quality in his
  agreeable face she had never seen in a human countenance before; she could
  not name it; to her it was a fascination not to be resisted, as if delights
  hitherto unknown were suddenly and richly offered to her. He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Does Mrs. Rue wish you to stay?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. She offered me two hundred pounds a year. Of course I could
  not take it."</p>

  <p>"You are dealing," he replied at once, "with a woman not only very
  foolish, but very frightened."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret knew that she was being forced faster and farther than she
  wished. But she could not resist. "I have some old letters of hers. Quite
  harmless, I assure you. I never placed any importance on them. I kept them
  for sentiment."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly. Mrs. Rue wants you to destroy them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course I shall do so. I only kept them to show her&mdash;how
  trifling they are."</p>

  <p>"But safely? Locked up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;with other things."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rue suspects nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No. But his mother does. A shot in the dark. She is a horrid woman. She
  tried to bribe me to give up&mdash;letters. I admitted nothing."</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;dislikes&mdash;her daughter-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"Loathes her&mdash;out of pure jealousy and spite. She does not know what
  to do. She doesn't want a separation as that would mean returning Susan's
  money."</p>

  <p>"How tedious all this is for you, Mrs. Sacret," said Mark Bellis in a tone
  so quiet as to be touched by tenderness. "You must allow me to help you. With
  advice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I only want to protect Susan. She is so afraid of Mr. Rue.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret, rapidly and looking down, recounted her friend's simple
  history.</p>

  <p>The painter showed a courteous interest: He might have been a cousin
  privileged to offer good advice to a gentlewoman in distress. He said that he
  would think the matter over and give Mrs. Sacret the result of his
  reflections&mdash;in a few days' time&mdash;if she could call for a
  retouching of her sketch.</p>

  <p>When she found herself walking toward the Old Priory again Mrs. Sacret
  realized that she had agreed to everything he had said and revealed all her
  secrets to him. Her intelligence was ashamed, even alarmed, but her heart had
  surrendered without terms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>§ 13</h2>

  <p class="first">Susan was aroused from the mental discomforts of her
  drifting days by reading in the <i>Morning Post</i> of the death of Lady
  Curle. Mrs. Sacret had to exert her full authority to curb her friend's
  outburst. Casting off her sometimes heavy, sometimes frivolous apathy, the
  desperate young woman declared she must and would have a divorce and marry
  "the only man I ever loved." Mrs. Sacret only soothed this dangerous fury by
  promising all possible help in the future&mdash;"If only you will be a little
  reasonable now, Susan."</p>

  <p>"But he may marry again. He doesn't know that I still care. Oh, why was I
  so hasty! I should have waited. The doctors told me that Elizabeth Curle
  might live for years! And we were being talked of. The only way to silence
  people seemed to get married again."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand thinking so much of respectability if one&mdash;is in
  love," said Mrs. Sacret unguardedly.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool!" cried Susan, with unusual and unexpected vehemence. "Now I
  don't care&mdash;I'd run away with him tomorrow&mdash;and end all this
  pretense and dreadful fear. Yes, and then I shouldn't care about the
  letters."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt her world dwindle about her, everything to which she had
  become used in the last six months fade and vanish and she standing in her
  old drab and shabby mourning in the mean little house in Minton Street,
  searching the newspaper for SITUATIONS VACANT. Her brilliant hazel eyes
  sparkled with excitement. She took Susan by the shoulders and shook her until
  her pretty gold trinkets rattled.</p>

  <p>"Do be sensible. Why have a horrid scandal and be cut by everyone? Besides
  it would be wicked. And Sir John wouldn't like it. Men don't. Mr. Rue might
  never divorce you&mdash;out of spite."</p>

  <p>Under the force of these rapid arguments and her friend's vivid glance,
  Susan controlled herself&mdash;and looked with a wild hope at the elder
  woman.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to suggest something, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Mrs. Sacret relaxed her hold on Susan, who dropped into the shining
  satin chair by the bed. "Of course. A number of things. But be prudent. Give
  me time. That nasty old woman will also see this death announced&mdash;and
  you must be so careful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm weary of being careful," protested Susan. "I shall speak frankly to
  Martin. He was fond of me once. He might let me divorce him. It can be done,
  I think, arranged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm sure it can. But you must not suggest it to Mr. Rue&mdash;not
  yet. Why, he would be furious! He would see at once that it was because of
  Lady Curle's death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is what I want to tell him."</p>

  <p>"It would be lunatic&mdash;do, pray, be advised by me."</p>

  <p>Susan's lovely eyes gazed anxiously into her friend's intent face. "I wish
  I could be sure of you, Olivia. You are so different from what you were. Like
  a changeling," she murmured earnestly. "And those letters&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't mention those again! I thought you had forgotten them!"</p>

  <p>"Have you destroyed them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I think so. I don't really remember. They are of no importance. And
  why are you afraid of a few harmless letters, Susan, when you say you are
  ready to leave your husband and run away with a man whose wife is just
  dead?"</p>

  <p>Susan wavered, then began to weep. Mrs. Sacret pressed her advantage.</p>

  <p>"Do leave it to me. I'll see Sir John for you, if you wish, and sound his
  mind. That would he much wiser than writing any more letters. I could
  communicate with him from Minton Street. My tenant is very obliging."</p>

  <p>As this rapid plan was unfolded, Susan calmed herself and submitted to the
  superior wisdom and resource of her friend, and soon her simple mind,
  sanguine despite her misfortunes, foresaw a quiet severance of her tie to
  Martin Rue and a departure for some vaguely distant land with the man who had
  been an obsession with her for so long.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret, with an emphasis that was almost fierce, impressed on her the
  complete need for decorum and prudence and hastened away to seek the advice
  of Mark Bellis. Their relationship was still formal, but their unspoken
  intimacy was perfect. They had understood one another, Olivia Sacret
  believed, since they had first met, and this though he knew all her story and
  she knew little of his, and that little secretly disbelieved. She did not see
  him very frequently, as he was engaged on mural paintings in Lyndbridge
  House, and stayed in Kent for several days at a time, but she had kept a key
  to her house, and frequently went there in his absence to look at the crayon
  sketch of herself, always left for her to see. In this charming portrait she
  could read his opinion of her, the flattery and caresses implicit in his
  manner toward her, whenever he spoke to her or listened to her whispered
  account of her affairs. She had not had much to tell him since they had first
  met a month ago. He conveyed to her, more by bright and searching looks and
  overtones to his speech than by direct words, his advice that she should do
  nothing save wait on events and ingratiate herself as much as possible with
  Susan Rue&mdash;for her own sake, of course. Old Mrs. Rue was also holding
  her hand; she remained at Blackheath where her son visited her frequently,
  and Susan, relieved to be rid of her, was satisfied. But Mrs. Sacret never
  forgot her wary enemy.</p>

  <p>In her pearl-colored costume of half mourning, elegantly flounced, Olivia
  Sacret was leaving the Old Priory, when the maid hastened after her, and said
  that Mr. Rue requested her presence in the library. She was vexed, as a delay
  would make a visit to Minton Street impossible. She could not call on the
  painter at a late hour, the neighbors gaped as it was; not that Mrs. Sacret
  was vexed by this unmannerly curiosity, but Mr. Bellis had gently advised her
  to maintain a complete discretion.</p>

  <p>A recollection of this advice sent her to the back of the house where the
  master of the Old Priory sat gloomily before the heavy cases of books in fine
  sets of standard authors that no member of his family had ever read.</p>

  <p>In this dull, precise room, furnished with the cold taste of an
  upholsterer, was a door that led to bright beauty, the glasshouse that was
  Martin's chief pleasure.</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret, sniffing the tobacco fumes in the close air, looked at once
  at the vista of leaves and flowers, all filled with light and color that
  showed through the glass doors. Though she had become used to the rich plants
  that adorned the sumptuous, ugly rooms of the Old Priory, never before had
  she been in the library, usually locked, and never visited the
  conservatories, nor seen the rarest of the flowers that bloomed there.</p>

  <p>Now these showed&mdash;an intricate design of blended bud, blossom and
  foliage&mdash;behind the fair head of Martin Rue, who sat in a leather
  armchair beside the empty black-leaded grate and cumbersome, glaring white
  marble mantelpiece that supported two bronze Arab horsemen and a brass clock
  above a figure of old "Father Time" pointing to the dial.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rue rose, stubbed out his cigar and stiffly placed a chair for Mrs.
  Sacret.</p>

  <p>"I have an appointment," she murmured, spreading out the frills of the
  expensive gown Susan had paid for.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I won't detain you long, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>She looked up sharply at his tone. It was conciliatory, almost
  pleading.</p>

  <p>"Why, what can you have to say to me, Mr. Rue?" Her mischievous sense of
  power prompted her to add, "Do you wish to show me your flowers?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;are you interested?" He became animated and the sullen
  expression she so disliked vanished from his heavy face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; you have been honored with several medals, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"I have. The last from the Ghent Salon d'Hiver. I should like to go to the
  next display given by the horticultural society of that city&mdash;a
  delightful place. My mother and I used to go there every year. The citizens
  are so fond of flowers they commonly wear a bloom to church. Many of these
  plants are but mechanic's flowers now. But I prize them for their beauty." He
  nervously indicated the glowing pageant through the glass doors. "You see
  only orchids there, Chinese and eastern varieties&mdash;some with medicinal
  properties, beyond in a more moderate heat I grow native flowers&mdash;only
  in lustrous perfection&mdash;sweet rocket, or dame's violet, for example, and
  the old red rose pink that a severe winter some years ago nearly rendered
  extinct." Then recalling the purpose of this interview, he said hurriedly,
  "Mrs. Sacret, if I ever said anything to offend you, I regret it and ask your
  pardon."</p>

  <p>"Why, you never did, I'm sure, Mr. Rue. Only I knew you rather dislike
  having me here&mdash;in the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>"That is what I wanted to talk to you about," he answered hurriedly. "I
  want to say that I understand your kind intentions toward Susan. No doubt
  I've given her some cause for complaint. I'm a plain fellow, with wretched
  health&mdash;we quarrel a good deal, as you've seen for yourself. But
  underneath, I'm very fond of Susan."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" She would not give him any encouragement, she enjoyed his
  discomfiture and wished to prolong it.</p>

  <p>"And if we could be left alone&mdash;we'd be happy yet, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>His sincerity gave some gloss of dignity to his commonplace words, the
  flush in his cheeks softened his usual slightly livid color, he did not look
  disagreeable as he pleaded with Olivia Sacret. She compared him, curiously,
  with the painter of Minton Street. And greatly to his disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"Your mother, Mr. Rue," she remarked, "interferes far too much between you
  and Susan&mdash;speak to her&mdash;not to me."</p>

  <p>"My mother is not very often here, Mrs. Sacret; if I request it, she will
  remain away altogether. My wish is to take Susan abroad with me."</p>

  <p>He had accepted so much impertinence from her that she ventured on further
  insolence.</p>

  <p>"Susan will have to look after an invalid?" she questioned ironically.</p>

  <p>"If I were a little happier, I should be better in health," he replied.
  Mrs. Sacret thought mechanically, It is my duty to help in the reconciliation
  of husband and wife. But is it fair to Susan to force her back on to this
  man?</p>

  <p>"I entreat you," he added, peering at her downcast face. "Leave us. I
  respect your motives in remaining here, your friendship for Susan&mdash;but
  you are ruining our chances of happiness."</p>

  <p>"They had gone before I came, Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>"No," he replied vehemently, "that is not so." He rose and began to walk
  up and down the thickly carpeted floor. "You have shut Susan away from me.
  Sometimes it seems as if you had some hold over her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The word his mother had used&mdash;but this was not even a random shot.
  Martin Rue was completely unsuspicious, jealous as he might be, of the
  existence of the letters at the bottom of Mrs. Sacret's locked drawer. She
  knew that, at once.</p>

  <p>"I am aware," he continued with an effort, "that Susan had an attachment
  to a married man whose wife has lately died. This has disturbed her very
  much. I don't want to lose her. Won't you help me, by persuading her to come
  abroad with me?"</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Sacret saw all her usurped splendors stripped from her, the
  world she had come, so easily and so rapidly, to look upon as her own,
  sailing away, leaving her poor, unwanted, obscure. She recalled the painter
  of Minton Street and his talk of luxury, the need he felt for what money
  alone could procure. And here was her one chance of
  money&mdash;Susan&mdash;to be snatched from her suddenly.</p>

  <p>Martin Rue guessed some of her thoughts; he said, with a clumsy
  hesitation, "I should like to compensate you for any
  inconvenience&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You could not compensate me," she replied truthfully, "for the loss of
  Susan's friendship."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to remain here?" he asked directly, staring at her, his
  greenish yellow eyes narrowed under the sandy lashes. "You must have had some
  sort of a life before you came here, by chance, as it seemed. Have you no
  existence of your own? No other interests, nor friends?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret ignored these questions. She rose. Her head was beginning to
  ache. The air of the room was close as if some of the heated air from the
  greenhouse seeped through the glass doors.</p>

  <p>"It rests with Susan to keep me or to send me away."</p>

  <p>"You know that is not true. You have some power over her, if it is only
  the power of a strong nature over a weak one." He paused, then added with
  deep feeling, "I have a foreboding that some dreadful evil will come of it if
  you stay here&mdash;some evil for all of us."</p>

  <p>"How could it possibly!" Olivia Sacret laughed pleasantly. "Sick fancies,
  Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>"I still ask you to leave the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>She lowered her graceful head.</p>

  <p>"I must do as my conscience bids me," she murmured and turned to leave the
  room. The young man seemed to take these words as, at least, a concession. He
  quickly opened the door of the conservatory and brought out a small plant in
  a clean pot. "The cardinal flower, Mrs. Sacret&mdash;observe the elegant
  shape and the brilliant puce and scarlet. It is the splendid or shining
  lobelia. Most distinctive of blooms. It reminds me of you though you are in
  mourning. Please accept it for your room."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was startled by this flash of&mdash;perception? imagination?
  She might have expected that Mark Bellis would compare her to the vivid
  bloom&mdash;never Martin Rue. He took her raised color and faltering thanks
  for his gift as a sign of kindness and pressing the hand into which he had
  placed the pot, he added, in a tone of nervous eagerness, "And, pray, Mrs.
  Sacret, don't give Susan, poor, dear Susan, chemical champagne, or grocer's
  sherry, in your room; indeed, it is bad for her&mdash;and useless to control
  her wine at table if she gets it secretly."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was profoundly shocked, not only by hearing something she
  considered disgusting put into words, but by the realization that her
  trick&mdash;she saw it herself as that, a mean servant's trick&mdash;had been
  discovered. The lobelia trembled in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean." She blushed more deeply as she gave the
  routine lie, and wondered bitterly which of the housemaids had spied on and
  betrayed her. Martin Rue resolved this doubt by saying:</p>

  <p>"Susan told me herself. Susan tells me everything in time, Mrs.
  Sacret."</p>

  <p>Not about the letters, she thought, regaining her self-possession and
  saying aloud, "Oh, how oddly you talk! I have just a little medicinal wine in
  my room! I suffer from the megrims and facial neuralgia, as you do, Mr. Rue.
  Why shouldn't I dose myself, as you do?"</p>

  <p>The pale young man did not take offense.</p>

  <p>"It is my nerves," he said, as if in self-excuse.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret escaped, hearing behind her his low, slightly harsh, insistent
  voice, bidding her "consider his request."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>§ 14</h2>

  <p class="first">The missionary's widow, excited and distracted, placed the
  potted lobelia on her dressing table and hastened away to Minton Street,
  becoming hot and flushed from rapid walking through the June afternoon.</p>

  <p>The painter was in Kent, executing the wall painting at Lyndbridge House,
  but Mrs. Sacret felt that she would gain some comfort in her dilemma from
  gazing at the crayon portrait that showed her as the woman she would like to
  be. She could not resolve the problem before her. Should she leave the Old
  Priory and, rested and strengthened as she was, try to make some life of her
  own, no doubt with the help of a handsome present from Susan; or should she
  defy Martin Rue and use her hold over his wife to remain in his house? And if
  she did, on what terms? And how was she to deal with that watchful enemy, old
  Mrs. Rue? And was she to use her influence over Susan to persuade her to
  leave her husband or to stay with him, and correspond with, and possibly
  meet, Sir John Curie?</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret faced that compromise with her own rigid conscience. She knew
  that Susan was desperate with the reckless despair of a feeble creature, and
  that now that Elizabeth Curie was dead, nothing would keep her quiet but some
  contact with the only person in the world for whom she cared. Mrs. Sacret
  acknowledged Susan's passion as she would not have acknowledged it a short
  while before; she knew that it was not a silly woman's whim, but something
  powerful, to be reckoned with. She recalled that she had even promised to
  seek out and speak with Sir John Curle, and in her recently enhanced sense of
  power she did not feel afraid to do this. She even enjoyed the prospect of
  facing this, to her, important person, with his secrets in her possession.
  Would he, also, be frightened at the knowledge that she held Susan's harmless
  letters?</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret entered the little house to find that Mark Bellis was in the
  front parlor, lighting a candle, in front of which he had placed a bowl of
  water. The first dusk obscured the ugliness of the room. Mrs. Sacret,
  breathing quickly, stood on the threshold and lifted her veil.</p>

  <p>"I did not know you were here, Mr. Bellis."</p>

  <p>His pleasant voice mocked her formality.</p>

  <p>"I returned unexpectedly, Mrs. Sacret. I have received a commission to
  paint a miniature of Mrs. Fox Oldham. She fades and may never see Lyndbridge
  House."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was not affected by this remote tragedy. Never had she felt
  so full of life. The illness of a stranger was nothing to her. Without
  preamble she related to the painter her interview with Martin Rue, and looked
  at him, like a pupil looking at a master.</p>

  <p>He seemed to accept this position naturally and remarked:</p>

  <p>"Certainly you must not leave the Old Priory. Your influence over this
  foolish woman is your greatest asset. What else have you The question was put
  gently, but had a brutal edge.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, indeed," she replied cynically; then her former disguises clung
  and she added, "But I stay out of friendship for Susan&mdash;who is in a
  cruel position."</p>

  <p>The painter put down his fine brushes and adjusted the bowl of water so
  that the soft candlelight, with no glare, fell on a square of ivory; beside
  it was a faint crayon sketch of a feeble, pretty woman in a frilled white
  gown.</p>

  <p>"Give me something worth while to do, Mrs. Sacret," he remarked, "and I
  shall stay in England. If not, I'll be away again as soon as this wall
  painting is finished. What is the fee? Very little. But sufficient to pay my
  passage to South America."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret felt her spirits sink as they had sunk, with a sickening
  qualm, when Susan had wildly spoken of casting off her power and running away
  with Sir John Curie, as she had felt when Martin Rue had begged her to effect
  a reconciliation with his wife. She saw herself utterly forlorn, without an
  interest in life. Watching her, he laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I've met you, Mrs. Sacret, as I've met many another odd acquaintance. We
  might be useful to one another&mdash;for a while. But you are very
  inexperienced and must take my advice."</p>

  <p>"I shall do so&mdash;thankfully."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Give me those keys."</p>

  <p>She obeyed in silence.</p>

  <p>"I rent the house," he said in an agreeable tone, "and must be the master.
  I did not know that you kept keys. Do you often come here?"</p>

  <p>"Once or twice&mdash;only to look at my portrait&mdash;never beyond this
  room."</p>

  <p>The painter pocketed the keys.</p>

  <p>"The situation at the Old Priory interests me," he remarked. "A jealous
  husband, an erring wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I did not say that of Susan! Not erring!"</p>

  <p>"The ingredients of a tenth-rate farce," he smiled. "What does it matter?
  Our point is your power over this foolish woman."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret sank into the beehive chair by the model's throne. "Our
  point," he said; did that mean that he would stay and be friendly with her?
  She could not care for much else.</p>

  <p>"You are entitled to some of her fortune," he continued. "Do not hesitate
  to take what you can&mdash;something more than a comfortable home."</p>

  <p>"Entitled?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You have good looks&mdash;wits&mdash;elegance. Our social system is
  very elastic, my dear Mrs. Sacret. It allows a good deal of scope for genteel
  adventurers, like you and me. It has no room and no pity for the weakling and
  the coward. Fortune, good or ill, befalls you," he added lightly, "according
  to what you are. People are happy&mdash;or unhappy&mdash;because of what they
  are," he emphasized. "Have you ever thought of that? People even get murdered
  because of what they are."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret laughed. "I was not thinking of crime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is a heavy sentence for blackmail."</p>

  <p>That jarred. She flushed and tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you think that I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you allow me to read those letters?" he interrupted. "Not that their
  contents matter much, as long as she is afraid of them."</p>

  <p>"You promised your advice; what is it</p>

  <p>"Consider your own interest. You have nothing to gain from this spiteful
  old woman and her sickly son. You must work for a divorce. Once your friend
  is married to a rich baronet&mdash;and with your help&mdash;they will both be
  grateful and look after you. And that will be safer than blackmail."</p>

  <p>"I agree. But Martin Rue has appealed to me not to do just that. In his
  way, I think he is truly fond of Susan. He doesn't want to let her go."</p>

  <p>"You must work on him until he does. Perhaps show him the letters&mdash;if
  they are compromising enough to disgust him with her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. They are harmless or I should not have kept them."</p>

  <p>"As you cannot persuade her to elope with her lover, persuade her husband
  to a divorce," suggested Mark Bellis, bending his handsome head toward the
  bowl of water, so that his clear features were outlined in soft light and the
  ripples of his thick, coarse hair were edged with dark gold. "First, get all
  you can from her&mdash;you have a right to all she can give. Reflect that she
  will owe her entire happiness to you."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of Sir John Curle?"</p>

  <p>"A shrewd question. I made inquiries about him when you first mentioned
  him. He is a baronet, rich, with a fine estate in Devonshire and a house in
  Belgrave Square&mdash;forty years old, or so. Not a man of any distinction,
  or merit&mdash;a country squire of good family. A wretched marriage&mdash;no
  children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he has forgotten Susan&mdash;or tired of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must find out. Has she not asked you to call on him? You can do so.
  And gain his good will by mentioning that you have some indiscreet letters
  that you refuse to show to Mr. Rue or his mother."</p>

  <p>"The letters are not indiscreet. And Sir John Curie will think I should
  destroy them if I care for Susan."</p>

  <p>"You must show him that you have power and your price," replied the
  painter. "You cannot come out of this affair with entire credit."</p>

  <p>This was too frank for Olivia Sacret; hypocrisy was almost as deep as life
  itself with her; she protested, rose and appeared to be departing, when he
  stayed her with a brusque remark.</p>

  <p>"Time is too short for us to fence indefinitely. Either you must satisfy
  your Nonconformist conscience by returning the letters to Mrs. Rue and
  leaving her house and taking your place among other decent widows looking for
  work; or you must use the chance of comfort&mdash;luxury&mdash;that has come
  your way, without any pretense&mdash;at least to me."</p>

  <p>She still struggled against his influence.</p>

  <p>"Susan would help me&mdash;as a friend&mdash;she needs me."</p>

  <p>"Without knowing Mrs. Rue I can assure you that you arc wrong. Your only
  hold on her is fear&mdash;once she had the letters she would never wish to
  see you again."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret knew that this was true. Evading that issue, she asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;I am to have no pretense with you? And why that
  word 'hold'&mdash;they all say that&mdash;and I have no 'hold' over Susan.
  The letters are quite harmless." She always used the same adjective about the
  letters.</p>

  <p>"You need my advice," replied Mark Bellis earnestly. "You are quite
  inexperienced, though you have natural talents&mdash;that is why you must be
  frank with me. You have no other protector or friend. As for the letters, of
  course they are not harmless&mdash;and you know it."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do not!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"Why is she frightened? Probably she was Sir John Curle's mistress."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" exclaimed Olivia' Sacret, shocked, truthful and flushed.</p>

  <p>"Assume as much when you meet the noble baronet," advised the painter,
  unmoved. "And see if he does not betray himself. Do not charge her outright,
  you might drive the silly creature frantic. Say nothing to old Mrs. Rue, she
  cannot pay high enough for this secret&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia sprang up, walked up and down the boards and drugget, protesting
  again, blushing, stammering, in conflict with herself. All this man suggested
  was an outrage to her conventions, his direct methods an affront to her own
  slow, cautious, hypocritical ways of dealing with Susan and Susan's husband.
  But she liked the man and he was offering her a partnership that she already
  felt she could not endure to lose. He coolly touched in the outlines of the
  miniature, working carefully on the ivory that he viewed through the bowl of
  water. When she paused, breathless and shivering, by the model's chair on the
  trunk, he gently asked her what she wanted from life. And when she was
  silent, he added, "I suppose you have never dared to ask yourself that
  question. You've been cheated from the first."</p>

  <p>"Cheated?" she asked, fascinated.</p>

  <p>He turned toward her, leaving his work, and spoke forcefully, in his
  melodious and insinuating voice; she saw herself in his words as she had seen
  herself in his portrait. By then he had drawn from her all her story and he
  sketched this skillfully, as if he was using a sable brush on ivory. Mrs.
  Sacret listened to herself revealed as a lovely, gifted creature sacrificed
  to misfortune and the selfishness of others. Enthralled, the missionary's
  widow listened to this tale of a beautiful girl born to a shiftless father
  who had married beneath him, deprived of her birthright, humiliated by
  poverty, sent to a school where she was the drudge of wealthy fools like
  Susan, married to a miserable invalid Dissenter before she knew her own
  value&mdash;before she knew anything&mdash;sent out to Jamaica to toil among
  Negroes, to nurse a peevish dying man, to risk her own health in a dangerous
  climate, to return home, Widowed, penniless, friendless, to face a degrading
  struggle for mere existence.</p>

  <p>This narrative threw a light on the past that Olivia Sacret had not seen
  before, but now she did not deny the facts thus revealed. Her father must
  have been incompetent, he could have placed her among his own class. He
  certainly was a failure and probably drank too much whisky&mdash;she was sure
  she could remember that now the painter hinted as much. Her mother had been a
  fool, too, common and vain, jealous, of course, of her daughter. Her parents
  should have done better for her. She felt now as if she could never forgive
  them. It had been disgraceful, too, sending her to a good school, then taking
  her away because of an inability to pay the fees. She had been the most
  brilliant pupil but despised because she was so shabby and penniless and
  ashamed of her home. Her marriage, too, she should never have been allowed to
  make. Her cheeks glowed, her downcast eyes sparkled, she felt as if she had
  been greatly wronged, frustrated&mdash;as the painter had declared with such
  emphasis&mdash;"cheated."</p>

  <p>When he softly ended his talk, and returned to his work she glanced at the
  portrait of herself&mdash;there it was for her to see the sort of woman who
  had been so ruthlessly sacrificed to the dim jealousies, stupidities,
  failures of those who should have seen that she had her chances. "Only one
  life that we are sure of," remarked the painter without glancing up. "And you
  are no longer a girl."</p>

  <p>"You mean there isn't much time?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," he smiled, looking as full at her as it seemed in his power
  to look at anyone, for his handsome eyes had a slightly upward, staring gaze
  as if fixed on some point above the usual range of those who face their
  fellows. "You have been lucky. You can be well paid for doing a service to a
  friend. Help Mrs. Rue to get her divorce. When she is Lady Curle you will be
  rewarded."</p>

  <p>"Then she will not need to reward me," said Mrs. Sacret, too fascinated to
  notice that this was a conspirators' conversation, or to resent the blunt
  words "well paid" and "rewarded."</p>

  <p>"She will always need you," he answered. "For a timid conventional woman
  like Susan Rue will never dare to face exposure&mdash;even after
  her&mdash;especially after&mdash;her third marriage. You must always keep the
  letters and your livelihood will be assured. You are dealing with wealthy
  people. It is only fair that this pampered silly creature should pay well for
  keeping her place in society. One that she would lose if the letters were
  made public. Surely you, who have never had anything, do not scruple to take
  some of her superfluity from a woman who has always had everything?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not," replied Mrs. Sacret aggressively. "Tell me what I must
  do."</p>

  <p>He at once gave her her instructions. She listened dutifully. There did
  not appear to her to be anything wrong in what he proposed. He had shown her
  what was owing to her, she wanted to snatch it with both hands. She glanced
  at the feeble sketch of the fading bride, not with pity but with horror. That
  woman might not live to enjoy the mansion being prepared for
  her&mdash;neither might she, Olivia Sacret, unless she was quick and careful,
  live to know anything but poverty and failure. The mean little room was
  dignified by the shadows, the confining walls were not visible, the candle
  softly glowing through the bowl of water might have been a star shining in
  immensity. The painter took her hand and gently urged her to return to the
  Old Priory. "It is getting late and you must do nothing unusual."</p>

  <p>She felt eager to obey his will, satisfied with his implied admiration,
  unaware that he had promised her nothing and told her nothing more of
  himself, oblivious that she had not believed what he had told her. "Bring me
  the letters," he said and she agreed, trusting him as a master. They left the
  house and walked to the corner of Minton Street together. The gas lamp cast a
  haloed light into the air and a circle of light onto the pavement. They
  paused to say "good night."</p>

  <p>Smiling as if to himself at a pleasant thought, Mark Bellis said:
  "Remember that the husband is another sick man&mdash;you know how to humor
  them. Gain his confidence by little attentions, such as an interest in his
  medicines&mdash;you know how much that means to these sickly creatures."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know!" replied Mrs. Sacret in a low voice. "I am so tired of
  nursing, but I shall do what I can for poor Mr. Rue. It won't be for
  long&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for long," he assured her, raised his hand to his dark bright hair
  and turned away along the poor little street.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>§ 15</h2>

  <p class="first">"How well you look!" exclaimed Susan. "It seems absurd for
  you to wear even half mourning. You are a different person since you came
  here."</p>

  <p>"I was leading a very dull existence&mdash;there was nothing in it all,"
  murmured the widow. "I don't know how I endured it&mdash;I was really dying,
  I think&mdash;in my mind and spirit."</p>

  <p>"It was the life you chose," said Mrs. Rue curiously.</p>

  <p>"Chose! I never had a chance! I simply did not know what was in the
  world!" Olivia Sacret laughed. "But we must consider your affairs, not mine.
  I want to help you. I've been thinking it all over and I feel sure you ought
  to have a divorce and marry Sir John Curle."</p>

  <p>Susan colored beautifully, golden and rosy she smiled on her friend. The
  two ladies were walking in the garden at the back of the ponderous ugly
  house. The crowded trees, straggling through dusty bushes to the light,
  shaded them, the newly raked gravel crunched beneath their thin slippers.</p>

  <p>"Will Martin consent?" sighed Susan. "Sometimes I think he is still fond
  of me&mdash;and I have not the heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret remembered Mr. Rue's formal appeal&mdash;he could ask me
  what he did ask and never tell his wife he is "still fond" of her, she
  thought contemptuously; aloud she declared, "You must not be so sentimental,
  Susan. Mr. Rue would be delighted to return to Blackheath&mdash;especially if
  you allowed him to keep some of your money."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I would do that. John is a wealthy man."</p>

  <p>"You seem sure of him," whispered Mrs. Sacret. "Shall I see him for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need," answered her friend simply. "I wrote to him&mdash;and
  he replied at once&mdash;and we are sure of one another."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt angry. A foolish woman like Susan, with the direct action
  of passion, had forestalled her intrigues&mdash;even the clever painter had
  not thought of this.</p>

  <p>"Do be careful," she advised sharply. "You are so reckless and careless. I
  suppose you have not seen him?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"And has he any suggestion to make?"</p>

  <p>"He will do anything I wish. And it must be, as you say, dearest, a
  divorce. But oh, I am sorry for Martin and afraid of him, and dare not
  speak!"</p>

  <p>"I shall do that for you, Susan. But do, pray, be a little prudent. Of
  course you are not seeing Sir John?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't know what to do. I could not face any <i>disgrace</i>. A
  divorce is a horrid thing. But there are ways, you said so yourself. Martin
  could give me a divorce&mdash;with sharp lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, one can cheat and let the man have the blame," agreed Mrs. Sacret
  sweetly. "I don't really know the details, I've never talked of such matters.
  Mr. Rue would know. I'll speak to him&mdash;since you are afraid."</p>

  <p>"Would you?" asked Susan eagerly. "Then you are truly my friend." She
  sighed, as if eased of a burden. "Then, the letters won't matter," she added
  ingenuously. "As you will do this for me you must be my friend and you will
  give them to me&mdash;now. You have punished me enough for trying to take
  them."</p>

  <p>"How you tease about the letters! They never did matter. What will you
  care when you are Lady Curle?"</p>

  <p>Susan shrank from this coarseness of which the widow seemed unaware. She
  replied hurriedly:</p>

  <p>"I know I shan't be well thought of&mdash;I couldn't go to court, or
  anything like that&mdash;but I should be respected&mdash;not disgraced; we
  should go abroad and then live in the country, and the talk would blow
  over&mdash;but as long as the letters were there I should be afraid."</p>

  <p>Mark Bellis was right, Mrs. Sacret thought triumphantly. They will be a
  hold over her&mdash;all her life.</p>

  <p>Slipping her arm affectionately through that of Susan's, she said, with a
  smile in her hazel eyes and on her pretty lips, "You must trust me.
  And&mdash;I was thinking, Susan. I believe I ought to have the regular salary
  you suggested. I can't be shabby and without a penny and I don't like to ask
  you for everything."</p>

  <p>"You are staying?" asked Susan, pausing in her walk.</p>

  <p>"For the present. You want me, don't you? To speak to your
  husband&mdash;to manage old Mrs. Rue&mdash;to be a companion&mdash;There
  can't be any gossip about you while you have a respectable missionary's widow
  in your house. Shall we say two hundred and fifty pounds a year?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;if you wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;that diamond bracelet you offered me. I am leaving off
  mourning next week and could wear it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>§ 16</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret saw her instructions as clear and her task as
  easy. She had to persuade Martin Rue to allow his wife to divorce him in
  order that she might, after a decorous interval, marry Sir John Curle, and
  for this service she would demand a lifetime's support, countenance and
  friendship from two wealthy people. She might also obtain a handsome gift
  from old Mrs. Rue for helping her son to his release and perhaps even from
  Mr. Rue himself for her delicate offices in this distressing affair. Whatever
  she gained she would share with the painter&mdash;this was as much as she
  knew as regards her master.</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow no longer thought of God, hardly of the upbringing
  that had hitherto formed her. The impact of a powerful personality&mdash;for
  so she thought of the painter&mdash;had shocked her out of what were very
  superficial habits of mind, of spirit and even of body, for she no longer
  kept her charming eyes downcast, her hands either occupied or in her lap. Her
  steps were free, her gestures easy, her hazel-colored hair flowed loosely in
  a fine net, without a widow's cap to disguise the pretty curls.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rue's chronic ill-health came to a crisis. He was in bed for a few
  days and his usual physician, Dr. Virtue, called, declared his ailment was "a
  nervous complaint," prescribed soothing medicines and rest.</p>

  <p>"I can't see him," declared Susan with unconscious cruelty. "He f 71 is
  always so yellow and cross when he is like this&mdash;but you talk to him,
  Olivia. We can't go on living as we do now&mdash;everything in
  suspension."</p>

  <p>"No, we can't," agreed Mrs. Sacret, thinking of the painter. If she did
  not soon at least begin the task he had set her, that strange man might
  disappear from her life as abruptly as he had come into it and that she could
  not endure to contemplate. "I'll speak to Mr. Rue for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please do, Olivia&mdash;and I shall be grateful to you all my
  life."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you will," smiled Mrs. Sacret gently.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>§ 17</h2>

  <p class="first">Martin Rue again received his wife's companion in the
  library. The vista of light, warmth and pure color showed behind the glass
  doors. The young man was shrunken, slightly bowed, and moved in a crippled
  manner, complaining of pains in his legs. On the desk was a woven grass
  Indian basket full of bottles and phials, beside it a medicine glass, a
  bottle of water, and a box of cigars; but he had not been smoking. Her
  loathing of illness and her long delayed but now forceful resentment at
  having had to nurse a sick man during a slow malady, came on her with a touch
  of fury. How thankful I shall be when I can be free of this house, with this
  stupid woman and this man with his imaginary disease. The young banker's
  greenish eyes were turned toward her delicate wrist.</p>

  <p>"I see you wear my wife's diamonds, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"Susan insisted on giving them to me, Mr. Rue. They arc not so large or so
  valuable that I felt obliged to refuse them."</p>

  <p>"And you wear them, though only just out of mourning, Mrs. Sacret? I
  always thought you a very conventional person."</p>

  <p>"I am. So much so that I cannot forbear enjoying the only pretty ornament
  I have ever possessed." She smiled on him, clasping her hands on her
  dove-colored silk dress, watching the flash in the stones as the subdued
  light ran in and out of the facets. "But what I am going to say to you is not
  at all conventional."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose so," he retorted suspiciously. "You mean to interfere
  between me and Susan. After I asked you to leave my house. After I warned
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am bound to interfere, Mr. Rue. Susan has become completely dependent
  on me. And I must tell you straightly that she is set on a divorce."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Sacret, I implore you to leave this matter&mdash;this most vital
  matter&mdash;between my wife and myself." He looked at her with dignity, half
  rising, then sinking back into his chair with a whisper of pain. "This is
  affecting my health."</p>

  <p>"You dose yourself too much and smoke too much," she replied with
  sympathy. "I have had experience with illness&mdash;I know of some West
  Indian medicines very steadying to the nerves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know my own constitution," replied Martin Rue briefly. "My mother knew
  how to look after me. These drugs are mostly her compounding, they suit
  me."</p>

  <p>"Your mother should be nursing you back to health," urged Olivia Sacret
  smoothly. "Come, Mr. Rue, I know I play a part that seems odious, but really
  I am acting as a friend to both of you. You will never be happy with
  Susan&mdash;she is determined to be free. Believe me, I know her mind."</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt you do&mdash;how weak it is, how easily influenced," he
  replied warmly. She noted a slight constriction pass over his features and
  the sweat on his forehead under the damp yellow red hair. She thought of
  Frederick Sacret, he had often appeared as this man appeared and his illness
  had been supposed to be largely "nerves." But he had died. She touched,
  curiously, on the reflection that possibly Martin Rue might die. How easy
  that would make everything for Susan. But her husband would not die, he was
  young and strong, despite the ravages made by anxiety, frustration, an idle
  pointless life and continual drugging.</p>

  <p>She spoke, even while these thoughts were forming, and spoke with
  conviction.</p>

  <p>"It is not her mind I speak of but her heart&mdash;that is aroused. She
  loves this man and is determined to go to him."</p>

  <p>"She would not do so," he answered sternly, "even under <i>your</i>
  influence, unless I set her free. Susan is very much afraid of&mdash;non
  being respectable."</p>

  <p>"Most women are," said Mrs. Sacret primly, annoyed that he understood his
  wife so well. "Do, pray, come to plain issues: Will you set her free? She is
  prepared to renounce a large portion of her fortune&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are you being paid for this insolence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Useless to insult me, Mr. Rue. You know that your wife will not even see
  you save when I am present."</p>

  <p>The young man groaned and sank his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Someone is behind you," he declared. "You have not changed like this
  without some influence behind you&mdash;such self-assurance is not natural.
  You are passionately interested in separating me and my wife&mdash;I do not
  understand why."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret shivered. For anyone to come near to her connection with the
  painter of Minton Street was as if she felt probing near a hidden wound.</p>

  <p>"I act for the good of my friend," she replied quickly. "You don't seem to
  realize how fond I am of Susan&mdash;she was the one happiness of my
  girlhood. You are ruining her life&mdash;her marriage to you was a mistake.
  If you don't set her free, perhaps she won't have the courage to elope with
  Sir John Curle&mdash;but she will die of a broken heart."</p>

  <p>Martin Rue glanced up, baffled; deeply as he disliked and distrusted this
  interloper, what she said seemed reasonable enough.</p>

  <p>"You are a Christian woman," he whispered slowly, "and spoke much of piety
  when you first came to my house. Yet you wish to break up my marriage."</p>

  <p>"No, no, it is already broken. It never meant anything. Do understand. I
  must risk being indelicate. Susan wants a happy home, children. She will
  never live with you as your wife again."</p>

  <p>Martin Rue shook some drops from a bottle he took from the hempen basket
  into the glass, filled it with water and drank it; a dusky color crept into
  his sallow face.</p>

  <p>"Aconite," he explained. "A stimulant that agrees with me. As for a
  divorce, it is out of the question. I shall not divorce Susan&mdash;even if
  she were to elope&mdash;and I shall not give her cause to divorce me."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Mrs. Sacret, inwardly shaken by his unexpected firmness, his
  unmistakable air of finality.</p>

  <p>"I am a Christian, if you are not," he sneered. "I believe in the sanctity
  of marriage." Falling to a sigh, he added, "We are both young. I have hopes
  for the future. You are no true friend to Susan if you do not try to bring us
  together. Her feeling for this other man is a fancy&mdash;a passing
  fancy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are gravely mistaken. This is the only man she has ever cared
  for&mdash;surely you can do this for poor Susan, let her go without a
  scandal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you realize what you ask?" he demanded, suddenly angry. "Not only am
  Ito pass as an unfaithful husband, I am to strike her&mdash;offer physical
  violence to her before the witness. I will not do it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that the law?"</p>

  <p>"It is, and you should have known it before you came meddling."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret rallied her forces; she was beginning to feel exhausted;
  inexperienced before a stronger opposition than she had expected, she began
  to feel the difference between dealing with Susan and dealing with her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of this makes any difference, Mr. Rue. You have lost
  Susan&mdash;to refuse her freedom will only lead to tragedy."</p>

  <p>"Tragedy! You use that word lightly!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret rose; the bright hues of the flowers beyond the glass, shut
  into their quiet heat, dazzled her eyes. Her head ached.</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say," she declared with an effort at finality.</p>

  <p>"And I mean what I say." He also rose and spoke with a heat and temper,
  only just controlled below a shout. "You are a mischievous, perhaps a wicked,
  woman."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow realized that she faced an enemy; she had felt too
  much contempt for Martin Rue to have considered him as dangerous before, now
  she felt that he might be dangerous indeed, not only to her, but to her
  adviser, hidden in Minton Street.</p>

  <p>Yes, a powerful, a dangerous opponent. If he would not release Susan, that
  poor-spirited creature would certainly die. And what use then would the
  letters be? And without the letters what use would she be to Mark Bellis? He,
  she was deadly certain, would have no interest in a poverty-bitten widow,
  with no prospects of any kind. She made her decision suddenly, not altogether
  sure of herself, but aware that it was needful to act quickly.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be so sluggish as to wish to keep Susan&mdash;I think you do
  not realize how little she is yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted her swiftly.</p>

  <p>"I told you once that sooner or later Susan tells me everything; her
  weakness is double edged, Mrs. Sacret. It is not true that she never sees me
  alone. She has sworn to me that only two letters have been exchanged between
  her and Sir John Curie since his wife died."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow flushed at what she felt to be treachery on the
  part of her friend.</p>

  <p>"Since his wife died!" she exclaimed. "Indeed that is true, but Susan does
  <i>not</i> tell you everything&mdash;unless you know of the letters she wrote
  to Sir John <i>before</i> his wife died, letters that are in my
  possession."</p>

  <p>He understood her with what she felt to be abominable quickness, using the
  words she so strongly resented.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;blackmail is the secret of your hold over her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was shocked, not only to hear once again "blackmail" and
  "hold," not only by this sharp revelation of what she appeared in the eyes of
  others, the moment she mentioned the letters, but by a sense of her own
  mistake. She began to protest most vehemently that she had no letters, that
  she had meant to say "supposing" there were such letters, casting a slur, a
  taint, on Susan to see if he would not cast her off; but no, now she realized
  that this was a wrong thing to have suggested. He cut into her speech and the
  two of them were speaking together, hoarsely, with an air of exhaustion.
  Through their two voices she heard his declaration, coming with the force and
  power of a third voice.</p>

  <p>"No action of Susan's before her marriage to me is any concern of mine.
  Nothing you could say or show me, nothing she could say or show me would make
  me believe anything disgraceful of Susan. If you have any letters I swear
  they are no more than indiscreet."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow agreed with him silently. She realized her secret
  power over Susan as the falsity it was, the letters were harmless and only a
  timid fool like Susan would have been afraid of them.</p>

  <p>"There are no letters," she said sullenly. "I only spoke to test you. Of
  course I am only a silly woman. I am merely trying to help Susan, who is very
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"You are frightening her," he answered furiously. "I understand it all
  now. That is why you are here. Now you shall go&mdash;and at once. Susan and
  I shall understand one another when we are alone again."</p>

  <p>"You are ill," said Mrs. Sacret and indeed a slight spasm had contracted
  his face and he dabbed at his lips with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I shall not go."</p>

  <p>"You will&mdash;and at once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that if I do leave your house, it will bring your wife back
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"I do so believe."</p>

  <p>"You forget Sir John Curie."</p>

  <p>He had no immediate answer to that and she left the room, no longer
  feeling able to sustain the interview. Yet it was necessary for her to see
  Susan immediately, and she hastened upstairs, shaken and fatigued as she was,
  to the large bedroom where her friend spent so much of her time alone,
  tearfully idling and moping.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>§ 18</h2>

  <p class="first">"You have not been very true to me, Susan. You frequently
  say you are quite estranged from your husband, yet you, as he
  claims&mdash;tell him everything&mdash;even to the letters you have just
  exchanged with Sir John Curle."</p>

  <p>"I like to be as honest as I can," pleaded Susan ingenuously. "I feel so
  sorry for Martin&mdash;though he is unkind to me and I wish I had never
  married him. But never mind about that, Olivia; what did he say about the
  divorce? You look so tired and pale!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rue is a most difficult man," said Mrs. Sacret, carefully concealing
  any hint of the failure she believed to be decisive, for she was convinced
  that the young banker would not divorce his wife nor give her cause to
  divorce him. "I shall have to be careful. But I have good hopes that he will
  be reasonable in the end."</p>

  <p>"In the end! How long am I to wait!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret glanced at the locked door that led to the dressing room where
  Martin Rue had slept for some time.</p>

  <p>"You really must be patient, Susan. I am, as you see, quite worn out with
  your affairs. A divorce is not something easily arranged. And, listen,
  Susan." She leaned forward and clasped her friend's wrist, trying not to
  notice the shrinking at her touch. "Your husband wants to send me away. He
  thinks I am making mischief here. That is not true. And you must say that it
  is not true."</p>

  <p>"It is not true," murmured Susan obediently.</p>

  <p>"He thinks I am frightening you. Absurd, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, absurd."</p>

  <p>"He even guessed I might have&mdash;letters."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I denied this. And you must do so likewise. If he says anything
  to you about letters, you must declare that there are none. That you never
  wrote any&mdash;save <i>harmless</i> ones. And that would be quite true. Your
  mother-in-law had the same wicked thought. She accused me&mdash;of
  blackmail&mdash;yes, that is the horrid word they both used."</p>

  <p>"You did not tell <i>her</i> you had these&mdash;letters?" whispered
  Susan.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I denied it to both of them&mdash;and so must you."</p>

  <p>"Make it true, Olivia&mdash;give them to me."</p>

  <p>"Why, so I shall. It is the trouble of looking them up. And as they really
  <i>are</i> harmless, why concern yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Harmless or not&mdash;if either of <i>them</i> were to see them I should
  kill myself," sobbed Susan wildly; "or if they were to be made
  public&mdash;that is why I would not care about eloping with Sir John, for
  then I should be disgraced, once and for all, and the letters would not
  matter."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret sighed with fatigue. Again she saw her one possession, her
  power over Susan, vanishing. Susan, with no reputation to lose, would be no
  use to her. Hurriedly she said, "You must not say such wrong things. I shall
  persuade your husband into a divorce. Do you stand firm by me. He will try to
  get rid of me. He will tell you lies of me. You must never let me go.
  Promise, Susan, never let me go."</p>

  <p>"I promise," assented Susan feebly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret looked at her with deep exasperation. Lovely, yet a little
  spoiled by weeping, the unhappy young woman was crouched in a striped blue
  satin chair by the window, her blurred eyes glancing furtively over the tops
  of the swaying trees in the garden as if she were peering from a prison. She
  wore a loose rose-colored boudoir gown, edged with swan's-down, an expensive
  and insipid garment that the missionary's widow, in her dress of pearl-gray
  color shot with lilac and azure tones, despised.</p>

  <p>Susan had everything save character and taste. Mrs. Sacret corrected
  herself. Susan had lost her lover, and was certainly pining. "You'll ruin
  your looks and your health, Susan&mdash;do be reasonable."</p>

  <p>"There is no sense in being reasonable," complained Susan passionately.
  Mrs. Sacret tapped her foot with impatience at anyone who made so foolish a
  lament. She felt harassed, driven for time. She wanted to ask advice of the
  painter of Minton Street. Taking a key from her reticule she hastened to her
  room and quickly returned with a flask and a small glass.</p>

  <p>"Do drink this and compose yourself," she urged. She knew now just how
  much wine to give Susan in order to make her drowsy and neither violent nor
  sick; the secreted wine was of good quality now for Mark Bellis bought it.
  The disordered young woman drank greedily, and Mrs. Sacret, still promising
  "to bring around" Martin Rue, induced her to lie on her bed. She was soon
  asleep and the widow, covering her up carefully in a costly eider-down cover,
  tiptoed away.</p>

  <p>In her own room she pondered on her affairs, eying thoughtfully the salvia
  that bloomed vigorously, with what seemed an almost vicious vitality.</p>

  <p>She was trembling slightly, not sure of herself. She felt entangled in
  this intrigue that she had undertaken, perhaps, too lightly. Almost she
  wished she could shrink back into the old, obscure, safe ways. Yet the eager
  wish for this one chance of ease, luxury, the friendship of an extraordinary
  man, urged her on. Yet again she doubted her skill, she was not as cool and
  clever as she had thought she was; she felt capable of making blunders,
  perhaps had made one already in telling Martin Rue of the letters. Her
  position in the Old Priory was very precarious. If the master of the house
  insisted on her departure, would Susan be strong enough to resist him? Mrs.
  Sacret had no allies in the establishment. The servants all hated her. They
  had betrayed her about the hidden wine, they would betray her about anything
  they could spy out. Nor could she trust Susan. Even now she dreaded leaving
  that foolish woman lest her husband should "get hold of her" (on these terms,
  Mrs. Sacret thought) and force her confidence. It seemed true that she told
  him everything. He might even win her around to a reconciliation and then
  Mrs. Sacret would be obliged to return to Minton Street. Mark Bellis would
  disappear and she would have to search for some humble employment. She
  dreaded the painter's displeasure at her actions, yet longed to see him, and,
  much as she disliked leaving Susan, even heavily asleep and fatigued, she
  resolved to seek her lodger's advice and instructions. But her plans were
  abruptly disarranged.</p>

  <p>The young banker was seized with illness in the night; his wife was stupid
  and heavy from drinking the contents of her friend's flask and the servants
  alarmed and confused. It was the missionary's widow who took charge of the
  situation, and with the skill of experience nursed Martin Rue during his fits
  of rigor and fever, soothing him with some medicine she had used with good
  effect for her husband's distresses. The early morning brought Dr. Virtue,
  fetched by one of the grooms. He found the patient on the mend and still
  declared that all the symptoms were entirely nervous while commending the
  judicious nursing of Mrs. Sacret. She was much pleased by this praise and by
  some graceful words from the patient who seemed surprised and moved by her
  attentions.</p>

  <p>Her sense of power had returned. She accompanied the physician to the
  hall, exhausted but well at ease, and was deeply delighted with his
  confidence as he praised and spoke to her in low intimate tones.</p>

  <p>"You are a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Rue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. Mrs. Rue's school friend&mdash;perhaps her
  closest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did both a good service tonight. The poor lady is hardly capable of
  looking after her affairs. You've guessed the trouble, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I know they are not suited&mdash;not happy&mdash;" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"His illness is precisely that&mdash;he is fretting himself to death."</p>

  <p>"Would not&mdash;a separation?" suggested Mrs. Sacret tentatively.</p>

  <p>"By no means. Martin Rue is really devoted to his wife. She is frivolous,
  but good at heart. Use your kind influence, Mrs. Sacret, to persuade them to
  go abroad."</p>

  <p>"They went last winter&mdash;the trip was not a success."</p>

  <p>"I know. He should shake off his invalidism. Let them go to some cheerful
  place, say Paris, and see company. If they had a little nursery, all the
  trouble would be over. Let old Mrs. Rue keep away&mdash;she began all this
  hysteria."</p>

  <p>"<i>Susan</i> is hysterical?"</p>

  <p>"No, her husband is," smiled Dr. Virtue, "but don't think that unmanly or
  a sham. It is an illness&mdash;and can be cured, but only by ease of
  mind."</p>

  <p>"But his pains? His fevers?"</p>

  <p>"They are real enough&mdash;unhappiness causes them."</p>

  <p>"Does he not dose himself too freely?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. But he has nothing very harmful. I have seen his basket of
  nostrums. The old lady again! Let him start a happy, normal life and he'll
  forget the medicine bottles."</p>

  <p>Dr. Virtue held out his hand. Mrs. Sacret wondered if she should mention
  Sir John Curle and the real crisis between the wretched couple. She
  compromised.</p>

  <p>"Susan," she whispered, with a wan glance over her shoulder along the
  overfurnished hall, "is indiscreet. This is her second marriage, you know.
  And when she was a widow, she was <i>talked</i> of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The physician's manner changed at once.</p>

  <p>"Was she?" he remarked dryly. "Most pretty women with generous
  dispositions are, I suppose. And I am sure that Martin Rue would never
  remember any old, silly gossip now."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret realized that she had made a mistake.</p>

  <p>"Old Mrs. Rue brings it up," she whispered quickly. "She makes
  mischief."</p>

  <p>"But surely he never takes that sort of tittle-tattle seriously?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I can't say," replied Mrs. Sacret truthfully, for she
  was at a loss.</p>

  <p>"Another reason for sending them away," replied the physician. "Persuade
  them to it, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>She watched his glossy brougham sweep along the newly raked carriage drive
  and put her hands to her head. She was bewildered, wondering how she could
  turn all the domestic events of this household to her advantage. She went
  into the dining room and rang the bell. Curtis, the parlormaid, stiff in her
  gray uniform, appeared.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be in for luncheon," said Mrs. Sacret. "I have to meet a
  friend in town. Your mistress is lying down. Tell her when she wakes."</p>

  <p>"Very good, madam."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow was irritated by the hostility of the servant. She
  had hoped that she had earned a little good will by her attendance on the
  invalid.</p>

  <p>"I am very fatigued&mdash;being up all night," she remarked. "Master and
  Mistress ought to go away together&mdash;by themselves," replied Curtis
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"That will do. You forget yourself," rebuked the missionary's widow.</p>

  <p>The maid left the room and Mrs. Sacret felt even more deeply resentful.
  How stupid of them all to harp on this "going away together" as if they had
  not recently been abroad and returned bored and discontented. And why did
  they all turn to her, almost appeal to her, as if it had anything to do with
  her, or she could be of any use or benefit to them? A pair of spoiled,
  peevish fools.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret resisted the temptation to sustain herself by a glass of the
  excellent sherry she kept locked in her cupboard, and set out resolutely for
  Minton Street. When she reached the mean house she was trembling, not only
  from fatigue, but from fear that she would not find her friend, it was likely
  enough that he would be in Kent, but r 81 he opened the door at once on her
  hesitating ring. He must have been watching her from the window at which she
  had not dared to glance. "I expected you yesterday," he said with a hint of
  impatience behind his serenity. "I have been waiting."</p>

  <p>"I longed to come," replied Mrs. Sacret humbly, as she followed him into
  the parlor. She sat in the beehive chair, gazed at her portrait on the easel
  and told him her story, feeling weak and inadequate. As she spoke she pulled
  off her long gray silk gloves and rolled them into a ball in her lap. When
  she came to an end, the painter, who had been listening attentively, stepped
  up to her and lifted her right hand. She shuddered at his touch, believing
  that he was going to kiss her palm. But he unclasped Susan's bracelet and
  examined the stones.</p>

  <p>"Not very valuable," he remarked, "but I can get something for it."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret sighed; she recalled the sordid bargaining of their first
  meeting. He had never paid any rent beyond the gold piece she still treasured
  and she had given him all the money she could save from her needful
  expenses.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you spend it on," she remarked, unconscious of the
  banality of her complaint. To the painter it was, however, very familiar and
  he ignored it, merely remarking, as he slipped the diamonds into his pocket:
  "That wine I buy for you is not cheap."</p>

  <p>Desperately she asked: "How much do you want? I mean, to be of any
  use."</p>

  <p>"A few hundreds. Say a thousand pounds, when I have finished with
  Lyndbridge House. Then I could take a holiday&mdash;live <i>en prince</i>.
  For awhile."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"I know a number of places. Paris, perhaps, or Vienna."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret thought with a dreadful pang, He does not even suggest that I
  go with him. Of course the gossips were right, he is a mere adventurer.</p>

  <p>"But the way you are behaving," he added pleasantly, "we shall never have
  a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Encouraged by this, she asked quickly, "Have I done wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I doubt if you are fitted for intrigue. You began well, managing the
  business of the letters very cleverly. Nov you have made several mistakes.
  You may have ruined everything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! How could that be?"</p>

  <p>"You have put this man on his guard. He saw you merely as a
  mischief-maker, now he sees you as a blackmailer&mdash;he will certainly
  force you out of his house."</p>

  <p>"But he seemed grateful for my nursing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will still want to send you away as soon as he recovers a little. He
  loves his wife, as you should have perceived, and will listen to nothing
  against her."</p>

  <p>"I felt it was a mistake," confessed Mrs. Sacret miserably, "as soon as I
  had spoken."</p>

  <p>"You made another. You betrayed yourself to the doctor as spiteful, in
  casting a slur on Susan Rue. Did you bring the letters?"</p>

  <p>She took them from her reticule. They were meant to propitiate his
  possible ill-humor.</p>

  <p>"They are all here?"</p>

  <p>"All, I should not try to cheat you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," he smiled at her tenderly, running his fine fingers over
  the edges of the expensive notepaper. "You must follow my advice very
  carefully. We must act quickly&mdash;for I am certain you will be turned out
  of the Old Priory. Mr. Rue, backed by his mother, the doctor, and all his
  friends, will override his wife's fear of you."</p>

  <p>"What of her passion for Sir John Curle? I know that is powerful."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. But she will probably curb it for the moment&mdash;later she
  may become desperate and leave her husband; that, however, will be in the
  future and of no use to us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what am I to do!" cried Olivia Sacret. "I am so fatigued! I cannot
  continue nursing, if this man is to be ill. I am so weary of sickness."</p>

  <p>"You can always leave the Old Priory and give the letters back. You can
  return here soon. If this comes to nothing I shall go abroad as soon as I
  have had my wretched fee from Fox Oldham."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was shaken by jealousy and longing, her only relief lay in the
  fact that his handsome eyes were regarding her keenly, as if she were
  important to him. He must really need money and have no means of getting it
  besides herself. "I expect you have a wife somewhere," she said sadly.</p>

  <p>"I have never spoken of marriage or of any woman to you," he smiled, "and
  never shall. I supposed you a good companion. Come, don't spoil that
  impression with these banalities. You've too much spirit and beauty to be
  saying such trash."</p>

  <p>"I've too much spirit to work for you for nothing," she forced herself to
  retort.</p>

  <p>"You'll share, Mrs. Sacret, in whatever we get," he assured her. "Indeed,
  I admire you. I shall delight in showing you how to enjoy yourself&mdash;good
  food&mdash;wine&mdash;elegant clothes&mdash;the theater&mdash;riding
  lessons&mdash;a few other accomplishments. Yes, it would be interesting to
  teach one so frustrated as yourself, a Puritan against your will, what there
  is in life. But one must have money for the most modest experiment along
  those lines."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow was vaguely aware that this talk was crude, adapted
  to a woman the speaker considered immature, almost childish. She made a
  feeble effort to maintain her falling defenses, as she rose.</p>

  <p>"I shall go to the dairy and get a glass of milk and a sponge cake. Then
  I'll return here and we must decide just what we are going to do."</p>

  <p>"Excellent. As I have already told you, we are pressed for time. I'll take
  these letters to my chophouse. Give me two hours and I'll have the plans
  thought out."</p>

  <p>He escorted her from the house. Tired as she was, she did not dare to
  suggest that she wait there for him, knowing that she would be refused.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>§ 19</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret had a good deal of time TO put in before she
  could venture to return to Minton Street. Her refreshment was soon taken and
  she turned down one of the streets of small purple brick houses to the river.
  It was low tide and the mud flats were exposed; on the farther bank the
  trees, in midsummer leafage, were dense as light green hills. The sun blinds
  were drawn over doors and windows, no one was abroad; there was to the lonely
  woman an almost intolerable sense of meanness and emptiness under the
  trembling shade of the tall planes that shaded the flat mansions that
  overlooked the Thames. At one time, from the drabness of Minton Street, she
  had envied the residents of this superior terrace; now she detested it.
  Indeed she recognized her plight: She detested every prospect save that of
  being in the constant company of the painter.</p>

  <p>She was still afraid to look ahead; she even shrank from formulating any
  wish or desire for love or marriage, but she knew she could not let him go
  if, by any means in her power, she could keep him. Let him go? What had she
  of him? After an association of several months they still addressed one
  another with formality and she was not sure that she had any interest for him
  beyond a mercenary one. She leaned on the low wall that divided the terrace
  from the wet reaches and gazed unseeingly down below at the mud larks in
  their rags, playing among the moored boats and tackle.</p>

  <p>Her common sense, dying hard, showed her the man, the episode as they
  would certainly appear to others. She knew nothing of him beyond what he had
  told her himself and that she did not believe. What was he but a journeyman
  painter who, while grinding colors in a fashionable studio, had learned to
  exploit his natural personal advantages and to ape the manners of his
  betters? His talent and craft, though dazzling to her, were, no doubt, too
  ordinary for success, and he had become what used to be named in the little
  anecdotes she had to translate into French at school, a <i>chevalier
  d'industrie</i>. Queer how the long-forgotten term came into her mind. His
  romantic name was assumed, of course. Probably many women had been victims of
  his graceful address, his indirect flatteries, his peculiar upward gazing
  eyes, his thick stiff dark hair, flushed with a gold tint only visible in a
  strong light. What did he want&mdash;what did he really mean, when he spoke
  of luxury, of money?</p>

  <p>Then as she dwelt on the image of the painter, she began to embellish it,
  prudence and shrewdness vanished from her mind, her overcharged fancy took
  control.</p>

  <p>He was undoubtedly of noble birth. High spirited and willful, he had
  resented tyrannical authority, very likely he had been wronged. He had
  escaped to sea, to the New World, laying aside the restrictions t of his
  rank. She saw him as a tamer of wild horses, as a seeker after gold,
  galloping on the trail of red Indians, casting down the cards and dice in
  reckless gallantry, adored by lovely women such as she could never hope to
  rival, using his talent to earn a living when more manly occupations
  failed.</p>

  <p>As she dwelt on him his fascination for her increased. It would be
  impossible to feel dull in his company. He was always doing something that to
  her was new. The bowl of water with the candle behind it, what a strange
  light it had shed in her dingy room, transforming all the threadbare meanness
  into something odd and fantastic. So, meeting him had transformed her gloomy
  hopeless existence into a rainbow glitter.</p>

  <p>How ordinary, how tedious, compared to him were all the other men she
  knew: Martin Rue, Dr. Virtue, the few male visitors to the Old Priory. Her
  memories of the chapel people and of her own husband, the missionaries in
  Jamaica, became odious. Only in the recollection of her father did she find
  anyone comparable to the painter and of her father she thought with
  resentment&mdash;had he not cheated her, depriving her of all she
  <i>ought</i> to have had? She was startled out of her absorption in her
  daydreams by the subject of her deep reverie approaching her gaily. As he
  raised his hat the sun glinted on his brave, rich hair and the day ceased to
  be melancholy.</p>

  <p>"This is a dismal spot," he smiled. "Are you not fatigued?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered truthfully, for her musing on a possible golden future
  had invigorated her. "I have no guide to the time&mdash;have two hours
  passed? Shall we return to Minton Street?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Let us take a stroll. Do you know this neighborhood?"</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>"Yet I dare swear you have missed some points of interest. Do you ever
  think of the famous heroes and their ladies who once lived here? Of the
  strange happenings that took place here?"</p>

  <p>"I have no interest in the past."</p>

  <p>"You make a mistake. There is much to be learned from these old stories.
  Wherever I go I make a point of learning them. How fantastic and grotesque
  they are!"</p>

  <p>"I would rather consider our concerns."</p>

  <p>"Why, so you shall," he assured her. "I have read the letters and keep
  them safely."</p>

  <p>"You found them harmless?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, later. Now, our stroll. We begin here, on this terrace."
  He took her arm in a friendly fashion and pointed between the trees. "Do you
  see that house, there&mdash;with the high wall, and the light iron and
  glass-covered way across the garden to the front door, and the date, 1752, on
  the keystone above?"</p>

  <p>"I am familiar with it&mdash;two elderly ladies who keep poodles reside
  there."</p>

  <p>"They did not always. Do you recall that I told you that things happen to
  people because of what they are? Even murder?"</p>

  <p>They were walking slowly, as if they had been lovers lingering over a few
  snatched moments together. He kept his hand respectfully under her arm.</p>

  <p>"A notable Frenchman lived there with his wife. He was a secret agent, who
  frequently changed sides. She had been an actress and was much the elder of
  the two. They had an Italian servant. This terrace was then in the country.
  They kept a cabriolet with which to drive to town. One day, this
  count&mdash;for that was his rank&mdash;was assisting his wife into this
  cabriolet when the valet rushed out, shot them both, and then himself. They
  lay dead on that path, now protected from the rain."</p>

  <p>"What was the reason for this crime?"</p>

  <p>"I told you&mdash;they were murdered because of what they
  were&mdash;dangerous people, playing a double game. The details are still a
  mystery. Who was the Italian? Why the suicide? A courier came from Downing
  Street to seal the house, and then a cabinet minister, who shut himself up
  there all night, burning papers."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt a touch of dismay at the knowledge that this brutal scene
  had taken place before a dull neat house which she knew very well; but this
  was transient. She had too much concern in her own affairs to feel any for
  other people&mdash;and those long dead.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"It does not shock you? The violence? The murders?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! Why should it? I daresay they deserved it&mdash;spies and
  doubtless wicked people."</p>

  <p>"That is the sensible point of view," the painter agreed. "Taken so, these
  ancient tales have their interest. People are murdered because they are
  rogues&mdash;or fools. And usually hanged for the same reasons. Now, before
  we discuss our business, I want to show you two other houses."</p>

  <p>She came obediently, grateful to leave everything in his hands and
  confident that he had already decided on a wise and brilliant course of
  action.</p>

  <p>After a short walk he turned along a pleasant wide street where the houses
  were not more than fifty years old. This led into a small square in the
  center of which grew some high plane trees.</p>

  <p>"Keston Square, Pimlico," remarked the painter. "This was the scene of a
  curious affair&mdash;only ten years ago&mdash;you do not recall it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;I never read the newspapers. I never do now&mdash;only once
  I used to look at them for the advertisements."</p>

  <p>"And nothing else?"</p>

  <p>She recalled the report of the blackmail case that had struck so
  unpleasantly on her eye, but did not mention this. Mark Bellis paused in
  front of No. 25. It had, in common with many other houses in the square, a To
  LET board lashed to the area railings.</p>

  <p>"That affair gave the neighborhood a bad name," remarked the painter,
  peering up at the large blank and dirty panes of the bow window on the ground
  floor. "This property belonged to an old clergyman&mdash;a miser. He had no
  living but was chaplain at the old Fulham Cemetery. He resided, with a sour
  old housekeeper, in a house near by that we shall visit presently."</p>

  <p>"How dark this square is!"</p>

  <p>"The trees cast a dense shade, they are older than the houses. This used
  to be the park of a manor house. Can you see the old miser visiting
  here&mdash;with a To LET board on it then, as now. Keeping an appointment
  with a workman he had employed on some repairs?"</p>

  <p>"I can think of it," replied the missionary's widow. "It is an ordinary
  episode. The house looks very neglected, gloomy and dismal."</p>

  <p>"It has been empty for ten years. The old miser had advertised in the
  local paper for cheap casual labor. He knew nothing of the young man who
  answered&mdash;and who worked very well. The clergyman hoped to get a good
  rent, but he grudged every penny spent on the place. One week he paid the
  workman in gold and confessed that he kept all his money in his house in
  sovereigns as he did not trust the bank. So the workman struck him on the
  head with a hammer from behind, and thrust his body into a culvert in the
  garden. That is what he got for being a fool."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose he was missed," remarked Mrs. Sacret, leaning on her
  companion's arm, smiling up at his charming, animated face. In the dark,
  lonely square that yet was so far from the busy highway and the busy river,
  they seemed to be as private as if enclosed in a room.</p>

  <p>"Not for a long time," said Mark Bellis, drawing her away and out onto the
  Thames side again. "The murderer went at once to St. Helen's
  Square&mdash;here it is, the very next turning&mdash;and to No. 15, where the
  clergyman lived. He rang the bell, and the housekeeper admitted him at once,
  for she knew him well, only grumbling at him because of his muddy boots, for
  it was October and a wet day. He had been glad of that to wash away stains
  worse than mud on those boots&mdash;a few dead leaves stuck to them. He soon
  silenced her. And he soon found the gold. More of it than he had ever seen in
  his life before&mdash;boxes of it. He put the old woman's body in a trunk and
  corded her up. Then he lived in the house and spent the money. With a
  companion."</p>

  <p>They had now reached the house, No. 15 St. Helen's Square, of which the
  painter had spoken. It was an ordinary brick residence with a TO LET bill
  posted in the window and a black cat asleep on the dusty sill of the ground
  floor window. The missionary's widow looked at it with a fleeting curiosity.
  She longed to return to her own affairs and receive advice as to what she was
  to do. Even while delighting in the painter's company, she felt uneasy as to
  what might be happening in the Old Priory. Martin Rue might have recovered
  from his nervous attack and be playing on his wife's compassion in order to
  effect a reconciliation. Old Mrs. Rue might have come on the scene. The
  servants might be gossiping about the interloper...</p>

  <p>"You are not listening," remarked the painter. "Yet consider this drab
  little house, exactly like thousands of others, built by a cheap contractor
  in a flimsy fashion, yet the scene of this crime. Here the young man dwelt
  with his&mdash;companion&mdash;spending the miser's money. Then he had to get
  rid of the housekeeper's body. He had found, among the old clergyman's
  effects, the title deeds of his other property. There was a house at Fulham,
  also to let, and he thought of taking the corpse there and burying it in the
  garden."</p>

  <p>"It is a sordid case," said Mrs. Sacret indifferently. "I hope this wretch
  was hanged."</p>

  <p>"He moved the body from the trunk and put it in a packing case, and
  engaged a van and driver to take it to the Fulham property. All went off very
  well, save that the driver of the van complained of the weight of the box and
  said it was corded in an amateur fashion. However, he drove off. And the
  young man watched him drive away&mdash;along this street&mdash;thought the
  situation over and decided to bolt. After all, the money was nearly spent. He
  had changed some of it into diamonds, useful anywhere. So he never kept his
  appointment with the driver of the hired van, but slipped off to
  Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"Why does this interest you asked Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"As an artist human material must interest me. I might have to draw a
  murderer or his victim. I must assimilate their characters. This young man
  was never seen again&mdash;he was a stranger in Pimlico and impossible to
  trace. The driver asked a passer-by to help him with the case and they found
  it stained, like brown paint, at the joints&mdash;so the affair came to
  light. He had not packed it very adroitly, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"How do you know so much about it? All this could not have been in the
  newspaper reports."</p>

  <p>"Much of it was&mdash;for the rest, I re-created it in my imagination. I
  thought of those two worthless people, cleanly disposed of, and how the
  hoarded gold was, no doubt, well spent."</p>

  <p>"It was a horrid crime," said Olivia Sacret indifferently. "'What did the
  murderer look like?"</p>

  <p>"The police notices stated that he was slim, with a fair beard. He had
  given the name of Allen Drawn. Come, let us return to Minton Street and
  discuss our own affairs."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow gladly assented. She had felt no more repulsion at
  the painter's tales than she had felt at the stories of cruelty and crime
  that had come to her ears remotely, at third and fourth hand, in the West
  Indies. There was a transient flicker of curiosity at this glance into the
  vast and intricate world of London that was all about her, and of which she
  knew nothing, but her own dilemma remained absorbing. She clung to the
  painter's arm and really felt the need of his support.</p>

  <p>"Come," he smiled. "You will not be able to sustain your part if you do
  not show more spirit. Have I sickened you with my old stories?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she replied impatiently. "I am not so queasy as that. They have
  nothing to do with me and I have already forgotten them. I am tired from a
  sleepless night."</p>

  <p>"We will take a turn in the fresh air."</p>

  <p>They walked away from Pimlico. The last rustic lanes and fields were
  boarded up and displayed boards&mdash;"THIS LAND TO BE LET ON BUILDING
  LEASES&mdash;and the new suburb spread into the old village, the old parks
  and meadows, the rows of brick houses with slate roofs and more pretentious
  villas, some half built, rising among the one-story cottages of the
  wharfingers and the trim terraces of houses of the last century, still
  standing in pleasant gardens.</p>

  <p>"This is tawdry and desolate," remarked Mr. Bellis. "Would you not like a
  glimpse of the real country?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I should&mdash;but how?"</p>

  <p>"You could come for the day to Lyndbridge&mdash;and see my painting. That
  could easily be arranged."</p>

  <p>She flushed with pleasure. Never had she hoped for as great a favor as
  this.</p>

  <p>"But the people in the Old Priory&mdash;am I to leave them alone for a
  whole day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I shall tell you what you must do."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In the parlor at Minton Street the missionary's widow received her
  instructions. The painter gave her a glass of excellent champagne, a salad
  and some oysters, well served on the corner of the table on which lay his
  brushes, some playing cards, playbills, paint palettes and paper knives and
  various pencils and chalks. He had bought and prepared this meal while she
  had been waiting on the dreary terrace by the river and she smiled in
  gratitude, forgetting even her anxieties about the Old Priory, both in the
  joy of the present moment and in anticipation of the visit to Lyndbridge.
  Susan and her husband, the entire affairs of those dull people, now seemed to
  her insufferable; she wished that she never had to hear of them again. But
  she must have money. She reminded herself of that sharply.</p>

  <p>Mark Bellis seemed to sense her thought. He remarked with an emphasis of
  his agreeable, soothing smile and courteous manner: "There will be very
  little for you to do. And certainly you will not remain much longer at the
  Old Priory. Mr. Rue will insist on your departure&mdash;it is merely a case
  of what you can accomplish before you go. You might try to persuade your
  friend to leave with you. Then&mdash;when she is free of her
  husband&mdash;you might bring her into touch with Sir John Curle and do your
  best to make them elope. They seem to be in love, so this should not be
  difficult."</p>

  <p>"But it will be impossible&mdash;Susan is so timid and so respectable,"
  protested Mrs. Sacret in alarm at the task before her.</p>

  <p>The painter wrinkled his brow into a frown, at the same time smiling.</p>

  <p>"Come, you must not make difficulties. You have the letters to hold over
  her. Still, it might be it would be impossible."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret drank her champagne. She wished that this intrigue was
  behind her and that she was enjoying her reward. Yet she did not even know
  what that might be.</p>

  <p>"I hope I can manage," she murmured. "I feel so alone in that great
  house&mdash;everyone is hostile, even the servants."</p>

  <p>"That is regrettable. Servants always hate genteel dependents. You should
  have tried to make them like you. Of course, however, you will do very well.
  You have but to push an infatuated woman along the path she desires to go.
  And you must try to induce her to visit her lawyers and demand her fortune
  from her husband. I wish I knew the details of that&mdash;you must discover
  them."</p>

  <p>"What must I aim to get from Susan?" asked the missionary's widow
  directly.</p>

  <p>Mark Bellis was pleased at this candor.</p>

  <p>"Susan will owe you so much that she will gladly pension you for the rest
  of your life, besides making you presents. You should ask her also, as soon
  as she is free of her husband, for a thousand pounds&mdash;say&mdash;to set
  you up in a modest millinery establishment."</p>

  <p>"But <i>will</i> Susan leave her husband? Remember she is expecting me to
  persuade her husband into a divorce."</p>

  <p>"He will not give it to her."</p>

  <p>"No, I do not think so. What are we to do&mdash;if she will <i>not</i>
  leave him without the divorce?"</p>

  <p>The painter stood thoughtfully silent, his sensitive face and fine hand
  holding the champagne glass were outlined in the warm sunshine that fell
  aslant through the small window. "Mr. Rue is in the way," he remarked at
  length. "Were he to die&mdash;his widow would be entirely in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he won't die," answered Mrs. Sacret. "He is young and
  strong&mdash;only coddled and wretched, always worrying about his
  nerves&mdash;and then dosing himself."</p>

  <p>"What was this medicine you told me you gave him?"</p>

  <p>"A simple draught the Negroes used to compound from some plant&mdash;I
  have forgotten the name. A powder one mixes with hot water. I brought some
  boxes of it home, it eases headache," replied Mrs. Sacret. "It suited Martin
  Rue better than his favorite drops&mdash;but why talk of this? I am so weary
  of sickness and dollops and draughts and pasters."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless you must continue to nurse Mr. Rue and to gain his
  confidence. Represent yourself to everyone&mdash;particularly the
  doctor&mdash;as the family friend who is working for the reconciliation of
  the couple."</p>

  <p>"I could not keep that up for long."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;did I not tell you you would not long be allowed to remain
  there? But while the master of the house is ill, he will not be able to
  contend with you."</p>

  <p>"He may recover&mdash;suddenly. As there is nothing really wrong with him
  he is often well within a few hours of an attack."</p>

  <p>"This time he might not recover so quickly."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret shrugged her elegant shoulders. A pity, she thought, that they
  had to spend their short time together in discussing such tiresome subjects,
  commonplace old crimes and Susan's tedious affairs. She wanted to ask him
  about his travels, his adventures, to probe him as to his intentions as to
  the future that she was keeping blank and empty for him.</p>

  <p>"I shall not give you another glass of champagne," he said. "And pray do
  not drink while you are at the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I never do&mdash;to excess&mdash;I know what you mean."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, endeavoring to penetrate and withstand his fascination
  for her and once more her native shrewdness reflected, He knows all your poor
  tale, and you know nothing of him. He must be useless to everyone&mdash;he
  has no friends&mdash;no set&mdash;he moves alone, existing on the stupidity
  of people like myself. But this flash of prudence was soon gone. When her
  prim disguises&mdash;her rigid conventionalities&mdash;were discarded, she
  was, she realized, of the same mental outlook and tastes as this stranger.
  What she did not yet know was if he was of the same emotional capacity. Was
  he able to feel for anyone what she felt for him?</p>

  <p>"I really am not equal to what you wish me to do," she said rapidly. "I
  began this&mdash;this&mdash;this play with Susan, teasing her with the
  letters&mdash;without purpose or direction. Even now I can't follow it
  all&mdash;how it will work out, I mean. But I shall do as you direct."</p>

  <p>"You'll get the money&mdash;somehow. And with credit to yourself and
  without involving me. You have not mentioned me?" He smiled too long and too
  steadily; it gave the impression of a fixed grimace; he glanced up as if he
  saw some arresting sight in the corner of the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed. But Mr. Rue suspected I had someone behind me. He said I had
  changed lately. And I suppose that is true enough."</p>

  <p>"You have developed. You are only what you always might have been. If you
  had never had this chance of&mdash;development&mdash;you would have gone
  crazy and died of frustration."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him, startled. She saw herself as she would have been had she
  not visited Susan, had she not met him, and she saw a shriveled figure, daily
  withering, bent over a desk in a dim office, kneeling in a dim chapel,
  walking streets thronged with strangers, going home one dull evening and
  cutting her throat with the bread knife.</p>

  <p>She put aside her glass in which the wine still showed clear and picked up
  her long gray silk gloves.</p>

  <p>"When am Ito come to Lyndbridge?"</p>

  <p>"The day after tomorrow&mdash;Thursday&mdash;take the 10.15 from Charing
  Cross. I shall be at Lyndbridge Station to meet you. A small village, but the
  mansion is not unpleasant." He smiled at her brilliantly and opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"You are tired," he remarked. "Next time you come here make Mrs. Rue send
  the carriage for you."</p>

  <p>"The servants would gossip."</p>

  <p>"They do that now. I need not be seen. It is natural that you should
  sometimes visit your property. Ask to be driven to the station tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He was in the passage and had the front door open. She passed out into the
  street, the dusk, and walked toward the river, the bridge, the Old Priory,
  with the slow step of fatigue. She remembered suddenly that she had left the
  letters with the painter and came to a standstill of dismay, so greatly did
  she dislike to have this, her one weapon, out of her hands. But she did not
  dare to return to Minton Street to reclaim them.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Martin Rue quickly recovered from his nervous attack, mainly, Dr. Virtue
  declared to Mrs. Sacret privately, because his wife had been frightened into
  a show of concern and even tenderness for him. He soon found occasion to
  remark to Susan's companion, "I am much obliged to you for your careful
  nursing, and for the Indian medicine. I should be grateful for the recipe,
  but I still must insist that you leave my house&mdash;suitably
  compensated."</p>

  <p>"Pray, don't disturb yourself, sir," replied Mrs. Sacret. "I hope to
  depart very soon."</p>

  <p>"There must be no delay, no shifts." The young banker, though still yellow
  faced and feeble, spoke with force. "I want to leave this house&mdash;it has
  never been lucky for us, it is too large and expensive. Susan can't manage an
  establishment of this size. There is always waste somewhere."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was contemptuously silent. She despised this meanness, this
  preoccupation with domestic economy in a man who was both rich and young.
  Regardless of her sharp glance he continued firmly:</p>

  <p>"You are not wearing Susan's diamonds."</p>

  <p>"You yourself remarked, Mr. Rue, that they were not suitable to my
  mourning."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you would pay any heed to any strictures of mine," he
  sneered. "And you are to have the horses tomorrow for the station&mdash;where
  are you going, pray?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I not have friends?"</p>

  <p>"There might be many reasons for that, Mrs. Sacret. I have often remarked
  on your extreme isolation."</p>

  <p>"I have friends&mdash;in Kent&mdash;I intend to spend the day there."</p>

  <p>"And the diamonds?"</p>

  <p>"Are they not my property?"</p>

  <p>"I do not consider them so&mdash;I believe that you obtained them from
  Susan by threats."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was quick to seize this chance.</p>

  <p>"I swear by God&mdash;on the Bible if you will&mdash;that I have no
  letters of Susan's in my possession."</p>

  <p>Martin Rue seemed impressed by that vehemence; she saw that he did not
  consider that this was an oath that the missionary's widow would lightly have
  sworn; nor was it; even as she spoke she reminded herself that the letters
  were at Minton Street in the charge of the painter.</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to believe that you would not perjure yourself," he
  admitted grudgingly. "Also that it is not in Susan's character to have a
  secret that anyone could menace her with; but what you said was a very vulgar
  lie&mdash;about my wife&mdash;the most upright of women."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret flushed with rage. She resented not only his rudeness to her,
  but his faith in Susan. Yet she could think of no answer that would be in
  accordance with the instructions that Mark Bellis had given her. Placing
  these before her mind, she said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"I really wish to be a true friend to both of you. I am very fond of
  Susan."</p>

  <p>"Then persuade her to be fond of me," he interrupted quickly. "For she
  will never he happy with any man save her husband."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret knew that this was true. It was also ambiguous. "Let her
  divorce you," she urged, "and be happy with a man she loves and can
  marry."</p>

  <p>"That subject is forbidden," he replied angrily, the furious red flushing
  into his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Still, I give you good advice." She remembered what the painter had said
  of herself, and added, "If you do not let her go, she will go crazy and die
  of frustration."</p>

  <p>"If only you would leave my house!" he exclaimed and she, steadfast to her
  policy of pacification, replied:</p>

  <p>"Very well, I shall be going soon. I am only sorry that I have not been of
  more use to Susan."</p>

  <p>"My mother is coming to stay here," he said. "She will see that you
  neither frighten nor persuade Susan. She is arriving on Saturday, though she
  is a very busy woman. She does so much for charities, you know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she can obtain me a post with one of them," smiled Mrs. Sacret.
  "I shall have to find work when I leave the Old Priory."</p>

  <p>The young banker ignored that impertinence and with a change of tone asked
  the missionary's widow if she could give him the recipe for the Indian
  sedative.</p>

  <p>"I wonder that you care to be obliged to me," she retorted. "But I shall
  look it up among dear Frederick's papers, though I doubt if any English
  chemist could make it up&mdash;it is, as I told you, a native medicine. I got
  a Kingstown apothecary to write it down, I don't know if the drugs are to be
  obtained here."</p>

  <p>"Pray, then, give me your supply."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is nearly exhausted, and I like to keep some for my neuralgia, but
  I shall see what I can do."</p>

  <p>She left the sumptuous drawing room, weary of the tedious conversation and
  of the idle air of the young man who lolled in an easy chair, the day's
  newspapers on the floor where they had dropped from his hand. Though Susan
  objected to the smell of tobacco he wore his smoking jacket and he was not
  freshly shaven. His self-pity, his imaginary illness (so she considered it,
  whatever Dr. Virtue might say), his obstinacy as regards his wife, his
  dependence on his mother, all disgusted Olivia Sacret. She contrasted him
  with the painter who was always alert, always full of plans and energy.
  Though so quiet and self-controlled, he was never at a loss, easily master of
  any situation. But then what a different life he had had, so full of
  adventure, peril and experience, while Martin had never left his mother's
  apron strings until an unexpected infatuation for a pretty widow had thrown
  trim into a foolish marriage. How different also was the birth of the two
  men&mdash;Martin Rue was middle class, really not a gentleman, while she was
  sure that "Mark Bellis" was the disguise for a noble name. Probably the
  painter came of a famous family and owned titles and honors that he scorned
  to claim.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret escaped from the husband only to be detained by the wife.
  Susan was waiting for her on the landing outside her bedroom. Her friend, who
  had at first had a room on the floor above, now slept next door; it was into
  this handsomely furnished chamber that Susan, flushed and tearful, drew the
  missionary's widow. She had heard that old Mrs. Rue was to visit the Old
  Priory and remain there, perhaps for months&mdash;"Watching me, Olivia!
  Setting me down&mdash;making mischief; indeed, I cannot endure it! Why do you
  not persuade Martin to give me a divorce! You promised!"</p>

  <p>"He is difficult," answered Mrs. Sacret with deep vexation. How difficult,
  she thought bitterly. Why would he not accept the inevitable, give Susan her
  freedom, and allow her, Olivia Sacret, to take the credit for this, so that
  Sir John and Lady Curle would be her indebted friends for the rest of their
  lives and she would be able to share their bounties with the
  painter&mdash;how simple that would be! All of them would be contented. She
  was startled by hearing her own hovering desire expressed passionately by
  Susan. "I am driven to wish that Martin were gravely ill. That he would not
  recover&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is very wicked," protested Mrs. Sacret mechanically, but she
  thought, Yes, that would be a delightful solution of the problem.</p>

  <p>"But it is only nerves, he is not really sick at all," cried Susan,
  sobbing into her damp lace and mull handkerchief.</p>

  <p>And if he were to die, thought Mrs. Sacret, Susan would not be indebted to
  me&mdash;though I suppose she would still be frightened of the letters.
  Besides, he won't die, he is quite healthy, as she says, and I must work for
  a divorce.</p>

  <p>With an effort at showing a sympathy she did not feel, Olivia Sacret tried
  to clasp her friend to her bosom, but Susan evaded her, murmuring, with her
  face turned aside, "Where are you going tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"To see some friends in Kent," replied Mrs. Sacret, sharply because of the
  rebuff. "I must have a little time to myself; I give up most of it to you."
  Recollecting her instructions she added sweetly, "Don't he pettish, dear. I
  really am your protector. I am sure that I am bringing your husband around to
  give you a divorce. And I shall protect you from that horrible old woman. I
  am more than a match for her, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"The letters&mdash;" whispered Susan fearfully, peering over her
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I declare you anger me! Such a lack of trust!" She recalled her trick
  with Martin Rue and repeated it. "I am a religious woman, as you know, and I
  swear by God I don't even know where the letters are&mdash;in what place, J
  mean." She added to herself, I don't&mdash;he may have them in a drawer or a
  box or even, at this very moment, in his hands.</p>

  <p>Susan was as impressed as her husband had been. She gazed searchingly at
  her friend and Olivia smiled kindly with hazel eyes and pretty lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, Olivia, do find them and give them to me. And quickly. And if you
  don't mean me any harm&mdash;and I can't believe that you do&mdash;please,
  please persuade Martin, at once, to let me go&mdash;before his mother comes,
  for you see, however much I want to keep you I shan't be able to much longer.
  Martin is <i>determined</i> that you leave and he will be supported by his
  mother and I shall not be able to withstand them both."</p>

  <p>"Supposing I <i>can't</i> persuade him, why not leave with me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I should not like to live with you! That would never do!"</p>

  <p>"I did not mean <i>live</i> with me. I meant I would help you to elope
  with Sir John Curle."</p>

  <p>"You know I have not the courage."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret walked up and down the soft blue carpet. She was exasperated,
  fatigued with the whole affair. How tedious it was, how tiresome Susan was,
  with her obstinate passion and her feeble will. How she detested Martin Rue
  and his mother, and how enmeshed and confused she was becoming with these
  intrigues. Despite the careful instructions of the painter, she began to feel
  bewildered, as if she had a mass of threads entangled in her hands, and did
  not know the pattern she had to work with them. She tried to fix her mind on
  the goal of all this business. What did she really want? It all came to
  money. That was what the painter wanted, too. She threw out her hands as if
  to cast off an invisible cluster of knots. "Will you give me a thousand
  pounds, Susan?"</p>

  <p>The younger woman looked amazed, frightened.</p>

  <p>"I have not got so much money."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes you have&mdash;your lawyers could get it for you, and you have
  jewelry that you could sell. Come, give me that amount and you may have the
  letters."</p>

  <p>Susan spoke hurriedly and with more gravity than was usual with her. "My
  lawyers would ask questions. Martin watches my jewelry. He was very angry
  about the diamond bracelet&mdash;I couldn't find so large a sum."</p>

  <p>"Do try. I want to be away. Of course you owe me far more than
  that&mdash;but I should be satisfied. It would be just a loan between friends
  and I should repay it someday. And as those silly letters worry you I would
  give them to you."</p>

  <p>"So, there is a price on them," said Susan unsteadily, "and always has
  been. You came here with that intention&mdash;blackmail they call it&mdash;I
  knew it from the first. That is why I asked you to live with me, not out of
  any friendship for you&mdash;but because I was afraid of you. And now I can't
  get the money&mdash;I have difficulty in giving you what I do without
  arousing Martin's suspicions."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense," interrupted Mrs. Sacret sharply, angry with herself for
  her mistake that she now perceived to be gross. "You are really very fanciful
  and nervous, Susan! Is it not a common jest to long for a fortune! Pray do
  not give it another thought, but rely on me to persuade your selfish husband
  to divorce you. Now, good night, my love."</p>

  <p>She bent gracefully to kiss her friend, but Susan raised her arm to ward
  her off, and stared up at her fearfully. "I'll not be shamed. John would
  never forgive me if I were disgraced and his part made public. He would never
  forgive me for writing so freely to such a woman as you&mdash;for being so
  easily deceived by your sham piety and meekness."</p>

  <p>"Why, what is in the letters?" asked Mrs. Sacret curiously, bending over
  the crouching woman.</p>

  <p>"You know. And that I am afraid. I married Martin to cover it up, because
  I was afraid. And I never remembered what I had written to you."</p>

  <p>Oh, thought Mrs. Sacret with a flash of insight into Susan's terror.
  <i>That</i> is it, she never remembered&mdash;<i>she does not know</i> what
  she wrote!</p>

  <p>"Do not lean over me&mdash;go away," said Susan. "I used to like you, to
  admire and trust you&mdash;but since you have lived here&mdash;I
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush! Don't say it! I am truly your friend, Susan, though you don't
  deserve it. I am a woman beyond reproach, the widow of a
  missionary&mdash;while your reputation rests on very little. Why, if the
  truth were known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Susan made a crouching, sideways movement that freed her from the presence
  of Mrs. Sacret bending over her, and leaned against the rail of the richly
  furnished bed that she had provided for Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"Yet I am your friend&mdash;though I know what you are," repeated Olivia
  Sacret. "Don't say anything hasty or foolish. I daresay you think&mdash;as
  you once suggested&mdash;that if you eloped with Sir John it wouldn't matter
  about the letters being known. But that would disgrace you even more. What a
  triumph it would be for old Mrs. Rue! You could not protest that your
  husband's cruelty&mdash;and hers&mdash;had driven you to run away&mdash;for
  it could be proved how you had behaved when you were a widow and Sir John was
  married&mdash;and how you snatched&mdash;as you yourself said just
  now&mdash;at Martin Rue's name to cover it up&mdash;to save your
  reputation."</p>

  <p>Susan put her hand to her mouth and cried weakly, her flash of spirit soon
  gone. Sickened at such feebleness Mrs. Sacret hunched her shoulders and left
  the room. How weary she was of Susan's troubles! If only that stupid woman
  would have produced the thousand pounds&mdash;as she could have produced it
  if she had had any wit&mdash;she, Olivia Sacret, would have been relieved to
  have left the Old Priory forever, and even to have given up the letters.</p>

  <p>A thousand pounds was the sum that the painter had mentioned and surely he
  would welcome her if she came to him with that gift, and let her know how it
  was to be spent&mdash;together? Yet she did not know what "together" might
  mean. She had never thought of him as lover or husband, only as a companion
  and a master.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>§ 20</h2>

  <p class="first">The weather was fine for Mrs. Sacret's journey into Kent.
  She was resolved to enjoy this, and resolutely put the affairs of the Old
  Priory out of her mind. She would not, she told herself, worry over what
  might be happening in that disordered household while she was away, but have
  this day clear for pleasure. She hoped that Mark Bettis would not talk about
  the Rues' affairs, but that, in this fresh atmosphere, against this fresh
  background, he would disclose something of his mind, of his plans for the
  future. Surely such must have been his intention when he asked her so far
  away from the mean little room in Minton Street and the riverside streets
  that so far had been their only surroundings. She had taken great care with
  her appearance; there was no hint of mourning in her expensive walking dress
  and mantle of dark lilac-colored cloth, her leaf-green bonnet with white
  roses and amber ribbons. She had been stared at in the train, she was stared
  at on the platform of the small country station, and she felt uneasy, knowing
  that her appearance was not quiet and ladylike and that she should not be
  traveling alone, but when the painter joined her, all her self-confidence
  returned. She was grateful then to know that she was a pretty, charming
  woman, and that he admired her. She felt that she had, at last, become like
  the portrait of her he had painted so soon after they had met.</p>

  <p>He offered her his arm and they turned along a path where the lush weeds
  of early autumn showed their berries and seeds against quickset hedges.</p>

  <p>Lyndbridge House was only a short walk from the station. The painter
  explained that a fair was being held at the neighboring town and that all the
  servants had gone there. "We shall be alone in that large mansion save for an
  old woman and her dog in the basement and some men in the stables, and they
  will not trouble us. I think it agreeable to be alone in a large house, do
  you not?"</p>

  <p>"I have never had that experience," she replied humbly. "I have always
  been in small houses, and often alone. Indeed, I know nothing. Why have you
  brought me here today?" she added, afraid of her own happiness at being alone
  with him in these peaceful ways.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you," he smiled.</p>

  <p>They entered large open gates; the tall stone piers supported lions
  grasping shields, the worn quarterings outlined with moss. The drive and the
  park were well kept, between the trunks of the chestnut trees, now in
  crinkled yellow leaf and smooth green fruit, showing the clipped turf sloping
  to rich woodland; before them was the frontage of Lyndbridge House, a
  Palladian façade before an older building, cool, pale, deserted in the late
  morning light.</p>

  <p>"Lower your veil," ordered the painter. "We are not likely to meet
  anyone&mdash;but of course you were seen at the station. It is impossible to
  disguise the fact that a woman came here, though no one need know who she
  was."</p>

  <p>"Does it matter? The harmless excursion of a lover of art!"</p>

  <p>"You must avoid scandal."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret thought that scandal, once so fearful a thing to her, was no
  longer frightening&mdash;for she was out of touch with anyone who might have
  been shocked at any indecorum on her part. Indeed she was sure that she had
  already lost her character with her neighbors of Minton Street, who now never
  spoke to her, but nodded with half awe, half scorn, when she visited her
  tenant, and she cared nothing for their opinion. The painter conducted her to
  an unlocked side door and up a spiral staircase to a long gallery, paneled in
  waxed oak that still retained the golden-yellow color of the young wood.
  There were a few pictures of piled fruits and stately flowers of all colors,
  shapes and seasons, in marble vases, set on Persian tapestries, and ships at
  sea in tones of cold blue and green, the canvases blowing out beneath stormy
  clouds. The deep-set windows, of a noble height, looked onto formal gardens,
  box and yew hedges and stiff parterres of flowers, arranged in a pattern like
  lace, to be looked at from above. The sunbeams fell aslant into the silent
  gallery and the moths danced in them. Olivia Sacret at once felt a part of
  this gracious habitation and wondered how she had ever been able to endure
  the Old Priory and Susan's vulgar taste. She moved lightly, with a proud
  carriage, feeling that it was her right to be in a palace.</p>

  <p>The painter, observing her closely, with what seemed to be a whimsical
  kindness, led the way to the suite of rooms at the end of the enfilade.</p>

  <p>These were in exquisite order, being with deep pink damask and furnished
  with delicate French pieces; the last room was circular, being adapted from
  an ancient tower. A glass door led to an outer stair, and at either side were
  windows, giving onto a rose garden, this also being appointed in an elegant
  feminine style. Here Mark Bellis had been working. The low modern ceiling he
  had already painted with pearl-like clouds on an azure sky, against which
  amorini floated scattering petals of summer flowers. This painting seemed to
  Mrs. Sacret to be very skillfully done, but her companion directed her
  attention to the walls on which he had, on stretched canvas, depicted a
  charming classic landscape that was done in several sections: on either side
  the window was a temple in a grove of tall trees, with mountains beyond; on
  the wall to the right a rolling campaign, with a river and bridge; on the
  left a lake with boats on the foreshore; and on the wall facing the windows,
  a valley and rocks crowned by a castle. All of it was painted in pale half
  tones, and adorned with delightful details of figures of shepherds and their
  flocks, dogs, nymphs, ladies, cavaliers, flying birds and horsemen, yet all
  so blended in line and color as to soothe and not fatigue the eye.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret sat on a chair of padded yellow satin and stared at the empty
  rose garden where the sunlight fell on the termini of yellow-gray stone, with
  horned heads and vacant smiles. She then glanced at the glass-topped table
  beside her; on blue quilted satin was laid out ladies' needlework equipment,
  thimble, needle-case, pincushion, scissors, bobbins in ivory and gold. She
  stared around the room, so new, so luxurious, prepared for another woman.
  Once she had never even thought of such splendors, now she felt as if she
  could not do without them.</p>

  <p>"You have a right to such a costly background," he assured her. "It
  becomes you&mdash;here you are beautiful indeed&mdash;no longer the
  missionary's widow."</p>

  <p>"I have already forgotten that part of my life," she replied harshly.
  "<i>This</i> is what I am suited for&mdash;the Old Priory is detestable."</p>

  <p>"This is where you belong."</p>

  <p>She accepted this flattery. It did not really seem to her that her father,
  third son of a modest squire, had come from such surroundings as these and
  that she had been cheated out of her birthright. She flamed with anger
  against destiny. "I would rather not have seen this place than have to leave
  it in a few hours," she declared passionately.</p>

  <p>"You might achieve something of the kind&mdash;if you had art enough," he
  said, pulling the sheet off a table in the middle of the room and showing his
  colors, brushes and palette. "I know an old castle on Lake Como one could
  hire for very little and have a few weeks of luxury there&mdash;music, the
  chestnut woods, a boat on the lake," he indicated, with a quick sweep of his
  arm, his wall paintings, as if he had embodied his dreams in these imaginary
  landscapes. Looking at her straightly he added, "I care enough for you to
  think it would be luxury there with you, and
  afterwards&mdash;Vienna&mdash;Paris&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean, I am to get the money, but I have no faith in my
  powers&mdash;I know I cannot persuade that fool to divorce his wife." She was
  trembling with vexation, with disappointment. "Have you no resources?" she
  entreated.</p>

  <p>"None. All were exhausted long ago. The mean price paid for the work here
  won't do any service for me&mdash;save to pay my fare, say to America, where
  I could try my luck again."</p>

  <p>"I understand that you threatened me," she admitted mournfully. "You know
  that you have become necessary to me&mdash;this is the first time you have
  said that you care for me&mdash;what does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"I'll marry you, if you wish."</p>

  <p>Many images flickered before her mind. She felt overwhelmed by them, many
  voices sounded in her ears, some of them with a warning note. Yet her
  prevailing emotion was one of humble fog.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me something of yourself?" she asked, but it was the woman
  she had been who spoke and she did not greatly care about the answer. His
  offer had been too sudden, too nicely judged, he knew that she would like a
  ceremony, even a sham one, and she was aware of this.</p>

  <p>"A waste of time," he answered. "And we have so little. We could be
  married in Paris, at the English Church. But there is much to do first."</p>

  <p>The offer was more than she had expected. It made the future clear,
  certain. Yet he was still a stranger to her and did not approach a step
  nearer to where she sat.</p>

  <p>"Here are Susan Rue's letters," he said, taking them from his pocket and
  putting them on the table. "They are most compromising and should mean a
  life's income for you from your obliged friend."</p>

  <p>"I did not think so&mdash;harmless," the familiar word came easily to her
  lips. "Surely they are harmless?"</p>

  <p>"Come here," he commanded gently.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret went to the table and he told her to take the uppermost letter
  and read it. She did so, with mounting astonishment, until she came to the
  signature&mdash;"your guilty but ever loving friend," then she glanced back
  over the sheet and her quick hazel eyes picked out such phrases as&mdash;"if
  it's ever known I should be ruined"&mdash;"while I was still an innocent
  wife"&mdash;"guard my guilty secret, I implore you"; then she looked up at
  the painter who was quietly watching her. "I don't remember this letter, why
  if I had ever had anything as definite as that in my possession everything
  could have been different&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet it is her hand, is it not, her paper, all exact? You could swear to
  it in a court of law?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"And she could not deny it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. She doesn't remember what she wrote, that is why she is
  so frightened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then put it with the others and keep it carefully as your most valuable
  possession. She was a married man's mistress and if she wishes to preserve
  her reputation she should pay for it."</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;you are clever with the pen," said Mrs. Sacret smiling.
  "Well, I see no harm, there is no confession here of more than she is guilty
  of&mdash;if she had not been so sly, she would have been frank with me
  before. I never suspected!"</p>

  <p>"It is clear that you have a very pure mind, sweetheart!"</p>

  <p>She flushed at his first direct endearment.</p>

  <p>"I had. Never did it occur to me that Susan was not a good woman! If
  Frederick had known he would not have allowed me even to speak her name." She
  put the letters, tied together by a piece of twine, into her reticule,
  silently vowing that they should never go out of her possession again. She
  felt a tinge of her former sense of power, as if Susan, for all her wealth
  and good fortune, were helpless in her unyielding grasp, yet she had a sense
  of baffled vexation because her triumph seemed still postponed.</p>

  <p>"What are we to do?" she demanded earnestly.</p>

  <p>"I shall show you."</p>

  <p>He took a brushful of paint and lightly sketched on the landscape facing
  the window a row of figures of widows in heavy mourning and veils. In one
  Olivia Sacret, standing close beside him, recognized herself in her cheap
  cumbrous black. But this he at once effaced, and traced, in white and gray,
  the elegant outline of a fashionable lady. "Olivia Sacret becomes Olivia
  Bellis," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"The other?"</p>

  <p>"Your friend&mdash;the fair Mrs. Dasent, in full crape&mdash;then, see, I
  rub her out, with the touch of a rag, and replace her with Mrs. Martin
  Rue&mdash;then she is in crape again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But Susan is not again a widow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and here she is," he continued, not heeding this interruption,
  "decked out for her third marriage&mdash;a titled lady now. And how grateful
  she is to her friend Mrs. Mark Bellis for her good fortune, and what handsome
  presents she makes her! Her third husband is very obliged also, he has a
  position to keep up and desires old scandals hidden."</p>

  <p>"It has not happened," sighed Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"I shall show you how it is going to happen."</p>

  <p>He took his palette, thinned his colors with turpentine and quickly drew
  in little scenes on the dry painted foreground of the rocky landscape.</p>

  <p>First there was a man in bed, a group of figures standing by, then the
  women, one giving the other a small bottle, then a woman, painted large,
  pouring the contents of the bottle into a glass, then the man in bed again,
  receiving a glass from his nurse, then a shrouded corpse, and a funeral.</p>

  <p>The little figures, often indicated by no more than a stroke or two of
  white or bright paint, had life and animation. Their story was clearly
  told.</p>

  <p>"Ask him once more to divorce his wife," advised the painter, in a low
  tone, "then&mdash;well&mdash;it will be his own fault&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then her instructions were already painted, for her to see.</p>

  <p>"There will be no danger?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"None. Your West Indian medicine is known to be harmless."</p>

  <p>"But if some suspicion should be aroused?"</p>

  <p>The painter wiped away his little figures with his large soft rag, firmly
  applied. The classic landscape showed serenely.</p>

  <p>"None will be. Have you not often heard that people who are unhappy take
  their own lives? Had you not better warn Dr. Virtue that his patient has made
  such threats?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so. I trust you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is the only way."</p>

  <p>"Where did&mdash;the woman in your sketch&mdash;find&mdash;what she put in
  the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"In an envelope between some letters in a package tied with twine." He
  sketched some stables, horses in their stalls, a bottle on a shelf labeled
  POISON, then wiped all away.</p>

  <p>"She was&mdash;capable of doing this?"</p>

  <p>"She had to be, it was her one chance of pleasing the only person she
  wished to please. She was about to be turned out of a comfortable home, to
  lose all opportunity of everything she wanted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I understand&mdash;" interrupted Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was all there for you to see. No dangerous word spoken. You can
  always swear that&mdash;and keep your Noncomformist conscience."</p>

  <p>"Susan might be suspicious. She does not trust me."</p>

  <p>"You have the means of silencing her in that letter. And in the final
  resort that letter would incriminate <i>her</i>&mdash;she, not you, would
  have the motive. I leave to you the details. Something left in her room,
  perhaps, in case?"</p>

  <p>He turned his back on the painted wall, as if he had done with the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"It rests with you," he remarked. "I can so easily slip away, leaving no
  trace behind."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret returned to the window and stared at the last roses,
  crimson, yellow, white, falling apart on their golden hearts. She felt a
  bitter envy of the woman to whom these delights so easily belonged, who did
  not have to work or intrigue for them. She was sure that she would have
  adorned a noble home like this far better than the feeble-looking creature
  whose miniature she had seen behind the globe of water.</p>

  <p>The painter read her thought as he usually did.</p>

  <p>"Catherine Fox Oldham will probably never live to return here," he
  remarked. "She fades daily. This suite of rooms will be shut up, the
  furniture will be covered, my paintings will crack and stain&mdash;in a few
  years the place will be as dismal as those houses in the Pimlico
  squares&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Never that," she retorted. "Here it will always be noble and elegant,
  even in decay."</p>

  <p>"Still&mdash;envy no one," he advised. "If you have wit and courage good
  fortune is within your own reach."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret felt tired. What she had to do seemed impossible, not
  because she dreaded it or disliked it, but because it seemed one of those
  things that did not happen. She could not realize it. She intended to obey
  her instructions but she could not feel that they would produce any results.
  The pattern of her life seemed fixed. She saw herself forever in thrall to
  this man who remained a stranger, Martin Rue always peevish and ailing, Susan
  always weeping and desperate&mdash;but nothing definite ever happening. Even
  the painter's cool talk of marriage had not seemed real. She hardly wanted it
  to be real, she could not imagine him as a lover, as a husband, only as a
  master, and a stranger.</p>

  <p>It was hateful to have to leave the beautiful room, the long gallery, the
  noble house, but the painter advised her that it was "getting late."</p>

  <p>She shivered before the words&mdash;and did not move. As he opened a
  basket and served her a cold luncheon, she hardly ate or drank, even of the
  wine he sparingly offered her. She hardly answered when he asked her if she
  had a good supply of sherry and champagne for Susan Rue&mdash;"better to keep
  her quite bemused."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret knew that. She would be relieved when the whole episode was
  over and they could go away together "and I can discover what kind of man you
  really are."</p>

  <p>She caressed her velvet reticule. She was glad she had that wonderful
  sedative for Martin Rue and now another medicine in the packet just given her
  that would further help him; she disliked to see anyone stiffer. What a
  wretched life he had! And how happy Susan would be if she got her freedom,
  either by divorce or&mdash;</p>

  <p>She jerked her thoughts together, regarding the painter timidly. Their
  connection, even their acquaintance, seemed fantastic. And it seemed
  fantastic also that she had ever been married to a missionary in Jamaica. As
  the recollection of what she had suffered came over her, she felt indignant,
  exasperated, aggressive and her clasp tightened on the velvet bag.</p>

  <p>"You resemble a little cat with claws in its prey," his pleasant voice
  remarked. "Come, we must be leaving."</p>

  <p>"What will you do with me, when we are together always?"</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you&mdash;then," he replied tenderly. "There is so much, so
  many simple things of which you have been deprived&mdash;until our affair at
  the Old Priory is over&mdash;I have asked you to marry me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I can't believe it. It doesn't seem possible and I don't want to
  think about it. I suppose I don't really credit that you mean it&mdash;let it
  go."</p>

  <p>"As you wish," but he did not speak flippantly, but in a tone of concern
  that gave her a strong thrill of nameless emotion. A realization of all she
  had missed overcame her&mdash;and of what she had missed most of all, someone
  to think well of her, to prize her, to admire and praise her. She flushed as
  he approached her and lifted his hand to his heart.</p>

  <p>"You are a rare woman, a beauty. I have never met anyone like you. We
  shall be happy. Do you understand how rare happiness is?"</p>

  <p>"I never dared to think of it," she whispered.</p>

  <p>She drew away, afraid of her brilliant fortune&mdash;that yet had to be
  earned.</p>

  <p>It was like breaking from a strong enchantment to leave the house, the
  grounds, to face the return to the Old Priory and her disagreeable tasks that
  did not yet have much meaning for her. But she had to go. An old gardener
  with a scythe turned to look at them as they passed along the avenue.</p>

  <p>"He is too far away to recognize you," remarked the painter.</p>

  <p>The gates were open, but a young woman, who perhaps had heard of the
  arrival of the painter's visitor, stared curiously from the little flower
  garden of the lodge. The painter motioned to Mrs. Sacret to go ahead. She
  heard him say, as she obeyed: "My sister&mdash;married to a
  Frenchman&mdash;Madame Dupont on a short visit to England." Olivia Sacret
  remembered Madame Dupont, the stock wife and mother of the French lesson
  books. The recollection came grotesquely to her agitated mind, with scenes in
  Miss Mitchell's school and Susan bringing her her translation to be done for
  her&mdash;and the invincible boredom of the sterile days for herself.</p>

  <p>"Have you often been seen in that costume?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, it is new&mdash;I put it on today, for the first time."</p>

  <p>"Don't wear it again&mdash;it is charming, but conspicuous&mdash;let it be
  put away."</p>

  <p>"How careful you are of my reputation! And I have forgotten that I ever
  had any."</p>

  <p>He told her that he was not returning to town, but staying for the night
  at the village inn, the Lyndbridge Arms, in the morning he intended to finish
  the paintings at Lyndbridge House.</p>

  <p>He left her at the station, a few moments before the train came in and
  pressed into her hand, with a graceful gesture, a small garnet ring.
  Forgetting the diamonds she flushed vividly with intense pleasure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>§ 21</h2>

  <p class="first">Martin Rue looked a very sick man as he once more told Mrs.
  Sacret that she must leave his house and the widow told Susan this when
  repeating these commands.</p>

  <p>"Your husband is ill, and I think his mind is unsettled&mdash;are you not
  afraid he may do himself a mischief?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how horrible! What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He is in a sad state. You should warn Dr. Virtue. His nerves are all to
  pieces. And he is quite resolved that I should leave the house."</p>

  <p>"Can't you sighed Susan, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I mean to go. But I don't want to leave you like
  this&mdash;alone and wretched. And you would have to give me some
  money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know if I could get any&mdash;enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret scorned this display of cowardice&mdash;Susan "lost her head"
  to a really contemptible degree.</p>

  <p>"You certainly could&mdash;your bank manager, or your lawyer would give
  you some and there must be some jewels you could sell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how to do these things."</p>

  <p>"You must get a little more courage and sense, dear&mdash;my affairs are
  in a bad way through spending so long here looking after you, and before I go
  I must have some money to put them straight. Say, a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds!"</p>

  <p>"It is such a foolish habit, Susan, to echo words. You used to be reproved
  for it at Miss Mitchell's&mdash;you could easily get a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Susan began to weep and Mrs. Sacret paced up and down the costly, ugly
  bedroom as she continued to admonish her friend.</p>

  <p>"Do try to control yourself. You are so eager for me to leave
  you&mdash;but I don't know what you would do without me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should be much better without you," declared Susan, sobbing miserably.
  "Martin dislikes you&mdash;you cannot, as you promised, persuade him to
  divorce me&mdash;I cannot persist in keeping you here against his wishes. Oh,
  please go, and leave me alone with him!"</p>

  <p>"What, have you given up Sir John?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know!" wailed Susan. "I cannot elope when Martin is so
  ill&mdash;and ill because of me&mdash;and if I were alone with him I might
  induce him to let me go."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret felt a surge of almost desperate anger against this weak
  capricious creature, useless as a straw in the wind. She paused before her,
  as she crouched in the easy chair.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to leave the house, I can see that," she said softly. "But I
  must have the money. Please understand that. No doubt Sir John would give it
  to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I could not! And why should I ask <i>him!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Don't be so shocked&mdash;as if you were a prude. You have a good claim
  on Sir John. I've been looking at your letters again&mdash;really, I was so
  innocent myself, I took no particular heed of them, but your behavior has
  been so odd, I read them carefully."</p>

  <p>"What is there in them&mdash;directly compromising?" whispered Susan,
  shrinking away from the erect figure that stood between her and the
  light.</p>

  <p>"How can you ask! You signed one&mdash;'your guilty but loving
  friend'&mdash;you wrote 'guard my guilty secret, I implore you'&mdash;'if it
  were known, I should be ruined'&mdash;'when I was still an innocent
  wife'&mdash;don't you recall those words?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't remember what I wrote," stammered Susan. "My brain was
  on fire&mdash;I trusted you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You never told me Sir John was your lover," reproached Mrs. Sacret
  severely. "I should never have tolerated that."</p>

  <p>"But you say I <i>wrote</i> that I was."</p>

  <p>"I've only just grasped the meaning of that letter. I read it hastily. I,
  <i>of course</i>, thought you referred to some new indiscretion."</p>

  <p>"What made you think it was anything more?"</p>

  <p>"Your fright about the letters," replied Mrs. Sacret truthfully. "That and
  the huge bribe you offered me&mdash;the sincere one."</p>

  <p>"What a fool I have been!" sighed Susan with futile frantic gestures of
  her unsteady hands.</p>

  <p>"You were always that. So you confess&mdash;he was your lover."</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;yes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Still is, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him since my marriage. I have always loved him. I always
  shall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't get hysterical. Does he know you wrote these foolish letters?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not&mdash;Oh, he would be vexed! The scandal would ruin
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Then he would advise you to find the money."</p>

  <p>"I daresay. Oh, I suppose I can get it&mdash;I have some jewels. I gave
  you a valuable bracelet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>that!</i> It was worth very little. I offered it to be sold for
  the benefit of a missionary society. I wonder you cast up a present at
  me!"</p>

  <p>Susan rose, it was as if she struggled to her feet against a pulling
  magnet at her feet and flounces.</p>

  <p>"Are you <i>selling</i> me those letters, Olivia?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret in cold anger. "I am weary of you
  and your affairs. I came to stay with you because you <i>asked</i> me, to
  support you against your odious husband and his detestable mother. I tried to
  get a divorce for you, but Mr. Rue is impossible, a <i>malade imaginaire</i>,
  a nervous wreck. I think if he knew you are&mdash;a wicked woman&mdash;he
  would go out of his mind and kill himself."</p>

  <p>"It would be cruel to tell him!"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> think it is cruel to deceive him&mdash;but I want to be rid of
  your muddles. I want to leave the Old Priory, really I loathe the place and
  your way of life, so dull, so stupid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, I believed you liked it&mdash;and surely it is better than Minton
  Street!" cried Susan amazed.</p>

  <p>"One changes. I want to go abroad&mdash;to Italy, to Paris, to Como. Yes,
  to a villa, a castle, on the shores of Lake Como&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish you could. I shall try to find the money&mdash;I have some
  emeralds at the bank that Captain Dasent gave me. Martin doesn't care to see
  them&mdash;then my lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret broke in on this almost incoherent speech.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can get the money. Say you want it urgently&mdash;for
  private reasons. Never mention my name, that might lead them to thinking I
  knew something. Old Mrs. Rue was very quick to guess that&mdash;but I lied to
  save you. Your husband, too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that he would believe anything against me."</p>

  <p>Vexed that Susan had chanced on this truth, Mrs. Sacret shook her swaying
  friend by the shoulder, and whispered energetically: "He would have to
  believe the letters, wouldn't he? Come, I have had a week's notice from your
  husband&mdash;I give <i>you</i> two days in which to find this money."</p>

  <p>Susan recoiled and withdrew from the other's touch, making an effort over
  her exhaustion, her despair.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I shall get it," she said. "Today is Tuesday, is it not? Well
  then&mdash;Thursday I shall get it, and you can leave on Friday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell Mr. Rue," smiled Olivia. "Don't fail. A thousand
  pounds&mdash;and perhaps some jewelry. I shall go and pack."</p>

  <p>She left the room quietly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>§ 22</h2>

  <p class="first">Methodically and taking pleasure in her task, the
  missionary's widow prepared to leave the Old Priory. She had told the
  servants and Dr. Virtue that she had to visit an uncle in Jamaica, who was
  failing in years, and that she expected to take up missionary work again in
  that remote island. To Mr. Rue she merely announced that she was "going
  abroad as companion to the widow of a Church of England clergyman." She did
  not expect him to be interested, or even to credit this statement. She
  accepted demurely his relieved gratitude. He offered her a handsome money
  present that she accepted serenely. "As a proof of your trust in me," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Two bank notes for fifty pounds each in a purse of knitted orange
  silk&mdash;such was the price that Martin Rue had gladly paid for her
  departure. She had other plunder. Her new trunks were full of handsome
  clothes, ornaments and fripperies, the result of Susan's fears. Mrs. Sacret
  was surprised herself at the extent of her own extravagance and Susan's
  weakness, as she emptied drawers and cupboards of furs, satins, laces, kid
  slippers, lawn underwear and doeskin gloves.</p>

  <p>She had visited Minton Street since her bargain with Susan, and the
  painter had praised her direct attack on her victim and had agreed that if
  they could so easily get the thousand pounds in cash, they could go ahead
  with that, and leave Martin Rue and his wife alone for a while until the
  money ran out "when the letters would he useful."</p>

  <p>So Olivia Sacret felt easy and even proud, as she lay on her bed on that
  Thursday afternoon; her trunks were already locked and most of them, directed
  to Minton Street, were in the hall. Mark Bellis had left her house, but had
  promised to call there every day to learn her news. Once the money was
  secured, they would in a few hours leave for Dover; neither had any affairs
  to arrange. The little house was already on the books of an estate agent in
  High Street.</p>

  <p>Yes, she assured herself, she had managed very well, there was no need for
  her to recall the sketches in diluted paint Mark Bellis had traced on the
  wall at Lyndbridge House&mdash;they could be wiped from her memory as he had
  wiped them away with his soft rag.</p>

  <p>It was only surprising that she had not brought off this "coup" and simply
  <i>forced</i> Susan to give her the money before. What had given her that
  sudden energy that had bent the other woman to her will? Perhaps the
  knowledge that now she held, among those "harmless" letters, one that was
  really damning; perhaps her sense of the painter's impatience, what he had
  depicted for her to see, showed he was resolved at any cost on a climax to
  their fortunes. Then, perhaps also, a shrinking from the means he had
  indicated, a secret, heavy, cold dread of the consequences. Certainly what he
  had suggested appeared absolutely safe&mdash;but better this way.</p>

  <p>Of course&mdash;she assured herself, using, even in her thoughts, evasive
  feminine phrases, dictated by her native duplicity and her long training in
  hypocrisy&mdash;there was nothing in what Mark showed me&mdash;merely a
  suggestion that I use my sleeping draught, my sleeping medicine, that did
  poor Frederick such good, for Mr. Rue. But it will be much better if I can
  get away without interfering with Susan's stupid affairs at all. What a fool
  she is! She never questioned that letter&mdash;I suppose that she thinks she
  remembers writing it&mdash;no doubt she hopes that I shall return it when I
  get the money. Naturally I shall not give it up. I wonder if she <i>will</i>
  elope with Sir John? Even if she does her stupid husband won't divorce her.
  And in that case the letter won't have much value. A pity that Martin Rue was
  so obdurate&mdash;if I could have induced him to divorce her I should have
  earned her gratitude that way. But no, she will never run away. She is too
  timid and respectable. And she will always be afraid of her husband and his
  mother and Sir John&mdash;so I shall always be able to get money out of her.
  She will wish, I mean, always to see me comfortable. I shall be married to
  Mark and he will be famous&mdash;we shall have a smart house in Kensington or
  Bayswater.</p>

  <p>Her reflections had faded into daydreams, then these had abruptly
  vanished. She could not foresee any future clearly enough even to dream about
  it. The painter had said nothing more about marriage, nor was she concerned
  with that matter; as soon as they left London they would be among strangers
  and she would term herself "Mrs. Mark Bellis"&mdash;she already had a wedding
  ring. That would satisfy her. She stirred on her bed, the day was hot, the
  dust of a long draft had filled the air with particles of grit. Mrs. Sacret
  longed for the cool galleries, the long enfilade of Lyndbridge House, the
  empty rose garden, the round room, the chestnut tree avenue&mdash;how tawdry
  and vulgar the Old Priory was! Even this bedchamber that she had had altered
  to suit her own taste was displeasing, because of the heavy dark pieces of
  furniture, the brilliant carpet, the large trellis pattern on the
  wallpaper&mdash;how glad she would be when she was away from all this painful
  pretense! The glasshouses, the livery, the melon pits, the vinery, the
  stables&mdash;none really first class, all a show, a sham, compared to
  Lyndbridge House and Mark's descriptions of Paris and-Como. How ridiculous,
  too, Martin Rue's efforts at horsemanship; he kept two saddle horses, yet
  whenever he took a canter on the common he complained of stiffness for days,
  and last week he had been thrown and came home limping. What a misery the man
  was, one way and another! It was really a pity that he had ever met silly
  Susan and allowed her&mdash;a widow intriguing with a married man&mdash;to
  save her name at his expense. How much happier he would have been if he had
  stayed with his horrid old mother who doted on him, and cosseted him into his
  imaginary illnesses!</p>

  <p>Well, it would soon be over. Susan had been out nearly all day yesterday,
  at her bankers and lawyers, she had whispered at luncheon, when she had
  briefly appeared, wretched and sighing; she had, in a stammer, promised to
  hand over the money after dinner, when the two ladies were alone in the
  pretty garden room where they had first met after their long separation.</p>

  <p>Everything would be very ladylike and genteel, and the missionary's widow
  could make a very dignified and decorous exit.</p>

  <p>She had, however, left nothing to chance; though so successful in her own
  plan, she had done everything possible to further that of Mark Bellis, even
  while not supposing that this would ever be used.</p>

  <p>In the short time she had she had spread abroad hints of Mr. Rue's mental
  condition, fears of his nervous stability and doubts as to his desire to
  live. She was not sure how far she believed these herself, she put a glaze on
  the matter and found it easy to credit her own tales.</p>

  <p>Now, as she moved restlessly on the silken eider-down and feather bed, she
  recalled the important actor in Susan's drama who had not yet entered the
  scene, though so much had been heard of him, and she wondered if she could
  not, before she left England, make some use of Sir John Curie.</p>

  <p>She had felt a hankering to use her power over him before, and now she was
  more sure of herself. Because of the damaging letter the painter had added to
  her packet, because of Susan's confession, and because she was soon to leave
  the country, it would not matter what anyone thought of her. Besides, here
  was another quarter in which she could sow her doubts as to Martin Rue's
  mental stability, another person she could involve in her schemes, with
  profit to herself. Sir John Curle, this rich, idle man, owed her something,
  no doubt he would pay well to have his secret kept. Mark Bellis had "found
  out" a good deal about him; he was religious, on the board of several
  charities, played the benevolent, pious squire on his prosperous estate. It
  would be as well to let him know that she, Olivia Sacret, would have to be
  reckoned with, if not now, at least in the future.</p>

  <p>Recalling the painter's advice and her teasing glimpse of the Lyndbridge
  splendor, she felt aggressive toward this rich, fortunate man who was, she
  persuaded herself, no better born than her own father and who enjoyed so much
  that was hers by right. Contrasting his lot with her own, she felt a stinging
  jealousy of him and of Susan, who had behaved so disgracefully&mdash;Susan
  with her two husbands and her illicit lover, all wealthy men who had pampered
  her in her self-indulgence. How useless Susan was! And how grasping! She had
  the effrontery to hope to be rid of Martin Rue in order that she might gain a
  title, a county position, and live luxuriously at ease on the proceeds of
  three fortunes! What was a thousand pounds to her, whether she gained her
  divorce or not? Mrs. Sacret pulled the bell rope and when Curtis came ordered
  the landau&mdash;Susan had the brougham, a one-horse vehicle she no doubt
  considered inconspicuous for her furtive errand to raise the money&mdash;and
  in gold, as her friend had insisted. The widow was obeyed quickly; the
  servants were very civil, she saw the relief in their faces, they hardly
  disguised how glad they were that this was her last day in the Old Priory.
  She met Martin Rue in the hall, he was limping and complaining of "the nasty
  brute" that had again thrown him. "It is no use for Dr. Virtue to order
  horseback riding for my liver unless I can find a quiet mount," he
  complained, adding "You are going to town?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;shopping in Bond Street," she smiled. "You know this is my last
  day of luxury&mdash;I shan't fatigue your horses."</p>

  <p>"I'm agreeable&mdash;as it <i>is</i> the last day," he replied rudely. The
  carriage was open for the early afternoon was hot and the sunshine clear from
  a pure blue sky. Mrs. Sacret, who had concealed at the bottom of one of her
  trunks the brilliant costume she had worn to Lyndbridge, was dressed
  becomingly in heavy gray silk and carried a fringed parasol. Her expedition
  was an adventure. She was acting without orders, her master might not
  approve&mdash;but after her success in extorting the money from Susan without
  recourse to dubious tactics, she felt confident of her own powers. It would
  be a lucky chance if she found Sir John at home, and willing to see her, but
  the hazard was worth the throw. She dismissed the landau at the end of Bond
  Street, bidding the man exercise his horses in the park for an hour and a
  half, then meet her at the same place. She felt a thrill of pride when she
  recalled that this same fat, sulky fellow was like one of the overfed
  servants she had seen idling on their boxes that Sunday she had first called
  on Susan&mdash;then they had represented a remote luxury, now she gave her
  orders to one of them.</p>

  <p>She knew, from Susan, Sir John's address&mdash;York Chambers, a private
  arcade, aristocratic and quiet, where the houses, enclosed by gates at either
  end, were let as expensive gentlemen's chambers. Her luck served. The elderly
  manservant who opened the door looked, as had the butler who had admitted
  her, slightly alarmed and suspicious. Ladies did not, at least unaccompanied,
  call at these bachelor establishments.</p>

  <p>But the widow's impeccable air, her genteel appearance, her soft speech
  and the nature of her errand&mdash;matters concerning a certain famous
  charity with which Sir John Curle's name was honorably
  associated&mdash;secured her admission to a waiting room, and then to the
  presence of the man about whom she knew so much, who was so important to her,
  but who was, as far as she knew, unaware of her existence. She considered him
  with lively curiosity. She judged him nearer forty than thirty years of age
  and no more than pleasant in appearance. Had he not possessed the
  self-assurance and appointments of a gentleman he would have been
  insignificant. How surprising to know that this was Susan's secret lover, the
  man who was causing her such passionate distress!</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret played with him awhile by telling him fart of the
  truth&mdash;that she was a missionary's widow, and acquainted with the work
  of various religious societies, with several of whom she had tried to find a
  post.</p>

  <p>He listened courteously, impressed in her favor by her quiet, almost sad
  manner and her pretty voice, and she noted the conventional but costly
  furnishing of the room, his expensive clothes, his heavy gold watch chain,
  seals and ring, the lustrous pearl in his cravat. Then she struck
  delicately.</p>

  <p>"I am staying with Mrs. Martin Rue&mdash;as a companion."</p>

  <p>He winced, flushed and stammered, made a poor recovery and congratulated
  her on her friendship with the banker's charming wife, watching her the while
  with his kind gray eyes suddenly anxious.</p>

  <p>"She has confided in me," said Mrs. Sacret. "I thought I should make your
  acquaintance and tell you that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Indeed&mdash;and why?" asked Sir John, now with a show of spirit. "It
  should make you easy to know that Mrs. Rue&mdash;Susan&mdash;has a true
  confidante constantly at her side."</p>

  <p>"How can that concern me, madam? Beyond the pleasure I have in hearing
  that an old friend&mdash;though one I have not seen since her second
  marriage&mdash;has so desirable a companion as yourself?"</p>

  <p>"She has told me her story," smiled the widow. "I tried to help
  her&mdash;to persuade Mr. Rue into a divorce."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, pray, Sir John! I am astonished that Susan has not told you of me and
  my services to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of Mrs. Rue's affairs."</p>

  <p>"You have written to her since Lady Curie's death&mdash;she has told me
  so. And I have letters she wrote to me before her marriage, letters that
  prove the nature of your friendship."</p>

  <p>The widow enjoyed seeing the ill-concealed confusion and alarm on the
  agreeable features of this man who, save for her connection with Susan she
  would never have met, was now in her power.</p>

  <p>"Did Susan not mention me? Mrs. Sacret, of Minton Street?" she pressed,
  leaning forward delicately.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;I don't know. Indeed you have me at a loss."</p>

  <p>"Pray reassure yourself, Sir John. Though far, very far from condoning
  Susan's behavior&mdash;so against my principles and my training&mdash;I shall
  never betray her. I have done my utmost to forward her happiness by urging
  Mr. Rue to set her free. They are very miserable."</p>

  <p>"And he&mdash;what does he say?"</p>

  <p>"He is obstinate&mdash;heartless. He is aware that Susan's affections, her
  hopes, lie elsewhere, but he will not let her go. A sickly, peevish man,
  nervous and unstable."</p>

  <p>"Why do you come to me, Mrs. Sacret?" Sir John rose and paced the Turkey
  carpet. "Mrs. Rue is very indiscreet, reckless, poor girl&mdash;but I assure
  you there was nothing between us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you speak as a gentleman must! But I have her letters&mdash;a
  letter&mdash;that is explicit. Besides she confessed."</p>

  <p>The harassed man paused, confounded, before his demure tormentor.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;Susan&mdash;did that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you must not be afraid. I hope that you and Susan will be happy
  yet, and then I'm sure you'll remember the good friend I have
  been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;happy?&mdash;if her husband is obdurate?"</p>

  <p>"He might change his mind. He might die&mdash;his health is wretched and
  he insists on dosing himself with his own concoctions."</p>

  <p>"Did you return these foolish letters to Susan?"</p>

  <p>"I still have them," she smiled. "They are safe with me."</p>

  <p>"Why do you not destroy them?" he demanded harshly.</p>

  <p>"They are precious souvenirs of Susan's friendship."</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Mrs. Sacret?"</p>

  <p>"Only to tell you that you can count on me," she replied, rising. "Mr. Rue
  has ordered me to leave the Old Priory and I am going abroad&mdash;for
  Susan's sake&mdash;not to cause yet more dissension between her and her
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Taking the letters with you</p>

  <p>"Yes," she looked at him steadily and watched the dark flush mount under
  his skin.</p>

  <p>"You are in need, perhaps, of money, Mrs. Sacret?"</p>

  <p>"I may be."</p>

  <p>"Write to me&mdash;I mean if I can help."</p>

  <p>She could see that his predominant emotion was still bewilderment. He was
  as amazed as if a poisonous snake had crept into his sedate room from the
  trim geraniums in his tiled window box. Though he was making a gallant
  attempt to keep his head, he was far from being able to do so, and flushed
  and stammered, repeating "write to me&mdash;if you are in
  need&mdash;money."</p>

  <p>How easily he has given himself away, she thought contemptuously. I might
  have been merely tricking him, acting on gossip&mdash;everything I said might
  have been false&mdash;he betrayed himself at once, as she did, guilt has no
  courage.</p>

  <p>She stood thoughtfully, slowly buttoning and unbuttoning her pale gray
  glove. Better not take any money now, though it was a temptation to do so.
  Better establish herself as a disinterested friend with a hint of menace,
  perhaps when the thousand pounds she would receive from Susan was
  spent&mdash;and she knew nothing of how far such a sum would go, lavished in
  a foreign country on luxuries&mdash;it would be useful to be able to apply to
  Sir John Curle, as well as to Susan herself, for further funds.</p>

  <p>And she was almost sure, now that she had seen the object of Susan's
  errant passion, that there would be no elopement. The man matched Susan in
  social timidity, in conventionality. Mrs. Sacret could hardly see him facing
  a divorce suit, let alone a scandal that would close society&mdash;even
  England&mdash;to him, cut him off from legitimate children, from all his
  respectable interests.</p>

  <p>How curious, she reflected, was the emotion that had cast these two
  ordinary, simple people together&mdash;strong enough to induce them to break
  the laws they really revered and to risk the forfeit of so much that they
  prized, but not strong enough to enable them to defy the world and find their
  happiness solely with one another.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Sacret had sometimes considered how little she knew of the
  intricate and gigantic city in which she lived, so now she considered how
  little she knew of the men and women she encountered daily in that city and
  who were, on the surface, so orthodox. Who could have guessed that the silly,
  idle, selfish Susan was capable of a tenacious passion? Or who would have
  suspected that Sir John Curle could' be a fervent lover? Or that either of
  them could manage a secret intrigue, with all the lies, deceptions and
  subterfuges that must have been necessary! It was true that they had been
  "talked about," but nothing definite had been discovered, and each had
  preserved social position and reputation.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret wondered how it had been done, where they had met, who had
  been bribed, who knew...</p>

  <p>She smiled brilliantly but did not risk holding out her hand. "Trust in my
  friendship for Susan," she repeated emphatically.</p>

  <p>Sir John hurriedly approached her and seized the hand she had feared he
  might refuse to touch.</p>

  <p>"You have mine, if I may offer it," he replied eagerly. "Poor, poor girl,
  poor dear soul. She is so good&mdash;as you, knowing her, must he
  aware&mdash;I am wholly at her service&mdash;pray assure her of that. Stand
  by her, Mrs. Sacret&mdash;and I&mdash;we&mdash;I mean our gratitude will be
  unbounded."</p>

  <p>"Alas, I am turned out of the house, but I shall do what I can."</p>

  <p>He dropped her hand, but still appeared, she thought, to trust her yet
  there was a touch of doubt, perhaps of horror, in his glance as he gazed at
  her uncertainly.</p>

  <p>"I shall write to you," she assured him, moving gracefully toward the
  door. "And do not be distressed about Susan, she keeps up her spirit
  wonderfully."</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply, she let herself out and thoughtfully
  descended the dark stairs and traversed the empty arcade. Her last remark,
  she thought, had been wise, for it would upset her plans if after all Sir
  John, driven frantic by fears for Susan, were to go to the Old Priory and
  create a scandal&mdash;then the letters would be worthless.</p>

  <p>As she drove&mdash;for the last time she supposed&mdash;to the Old Priory,
  her parasol tilted against the sun, she reflected ironically on Sir John's
  love for Susan; for she believed that the commonplace man did love the
  commonplace woman&mdash;how tenderly he had spoken of Susan, who was so
  useless, spoiled and stupid! Love&mdash;it was strange indeed. Was love her
  feeling for the painter, the explanation of the complete mastery he had over
  her? She did not know. It was pleasant to drive in the cushioned carriage,
  she hoped she would be able to have this luxury when abroad&mdash;she would
  like to learn to ride. Would this be possible in Paris&mdash;in Italy? She
  thought of France, of Madame Dupont, from the lesson books at Miss
  Mitchell's, of the words she had used about Martin Rue&mdash;<i>malade
  imaginaire</i> from the same book, a scene from a French play, yes, it was
  odd how the words had come into her mind, because of the association with
  Madame Dupont, she supposed. Just as now, thinking of horses, she recalled
  the painter's sketch of stables, the open drawer and the bottle, but she
  refused to recall the word he had drawn on the label, as she refused to
  recall the word that had impressed her&mdash;how long ago that
  seemed!&mdash;when she had been searching the SITUATIONS VACANT column in the
  morning newspaper.</p>

  <p>Instead she would think of love. Did Mark Bellis love her as Sir John
  Curle loved Susan? He had not suggested any amorous intrigue and they had had
  opportunities such as rarely came the way of eager
  lovers&mdash;eager&mdash;no, he was not that, he had not even kissed her. He
  had staidly proposed marriage and called her, once, "sweetheart." He had,
  however, made golden promises for a golden future, and that was sufficient.
  The fascination he had for her was not, she believed, of the same quality as
  that which Sir John Curie had for Susan. Hers must be a far colder
  temperament for she had no desire for embraces, for any manifestation of
  passion&mdash;indeed, she would have been shy and awkward had he shown
  any&mdash;perhaps he understood that. But one day, when they had ease, when
  they had escaped from all that reminded her of her former life, then she
  would allow him, would expect him to teach her to love him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>§ 23</h2>

  <p class="first">As Mrs. Sacret entered the hall at the Old Priory, the
  dinner bell rang and Susan came hurriedly out of the dining room. "Don't
  change&mdash;as you are leaving tomorrow&mdash;that dress is very
  pretty&mdash;where have you been?" she exclaimed all in a breath; she looked
  worn and untidy in an expensive taffeta gown carelessly put on, her abundant
  blond curls falling carelessly from the crooked combs.</p>

  <p>"Making use of the landau for the last time," smiled Mrs. Sacret. "Making
  a few purchases." She held up some elegant packages as Martin Rue came along
  the passage, and her eyes asked a question that Susan answered in a nervous
  whisper&mdash;"I haven't got the money&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young man drew his wife away toward the dining room. For all his
  friendly smile, the action was an insult that the widow felt furiously. And
  Susan had not got the money, delays, excuses&mdash;she might have known. She
  took off her tilted hat and seated herself carefully in her place. She felt
  humiliated, cheated, that it would be unendurable to postpone her departure
  from England even for a day&mdash;intolerable to go to Minton Street tomorrow
  and confess that she had failed. Perhaps Susan was getting the money
  tomorrow, she had said&mdash;"but&mdash;" as her husband had drawn her away.
  That means I must stay here longer, if I leave the house without the money, I
  shall never get it. She asked for sherry and, regardless of Martin Rue's
  frown, filled her own glass and Susan's several times.</p>

  <p>"You should take some, Mr. Rue, it would help your stiffness."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am better. I was out in the paddock this afternoon. I had a warm
  bath with mustard just now, and I had Curtis save the water and shall take
  another in the morning."</p>

  <p>There was Marsala and Burgundy on the table. Mrs. Sacret had asked for the
  wine in order to vex her host and he had not refused her. "Your last dinner,
  Mrs. Sacret," he remarked pointedly, but he protested several times at
  Susan's drinking of sherry. She responded tearfully, and declared, as the
  savory was placed on the table, that she had a headache and would go to bed
  early.</p>

  <p>That is to avoid an explanation with me, thought Mrs. Sacret bitterly. She
  intends to keep her room until I am gone tomorrow. She turned to Martin Rue
  and asked, "Would it inconvenience you if I were to stay a few days
  longer?"</p>

  <p>His face became livid, the loathing he had been repressing for so long
  embittered his voice as he replied: "You must leave tomorrow,
  <i>early</i>&mdash;as arranged. I insist."</p>

  <p>How ugly and hateful he is! she thought furiously, that sand-colored
  hair&mdash;those yellow-green eyes! And a complexion like bad
  fat&mdash;perhaps they have plotted this between them&mdash;to cheat me out
  of my money&mdash;to turn me out.</p>

  <p>"I insist," he repeated, leaning across the table.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Susan fearfully. "Olivia is going&mdash;all her luggage
  is in the hall."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was silent. She could not command her rage. She believed that
  they had made some kind of temporary pact in order to be rid of her. Martin
  Rue had boasted of his influence over his wife, he had shown that he would
  not believe any evil of her, perhaps she had even confessed that her friend
  was wringing money from her, and about the letter, and he had offered to
  protect her.</p>

  <p>In that case, I have lost&mdash;I shall not get the money. It is true I
  could sell that letter to old Mrs. Rue&mdash;or to Sir John&mdash;but that
  would mean delays&mdash;I can't wait&mdash;Mark would not wait.</p>

  <p>Susan rose, with looks of fright. "I shan't go to the garden room," she
  murmured. "I really must rest."</p>

  <p>Her husband got to his feet, he was flushed from three glasses of
  Burgundy, and opened the door. Again Mrs. Sacret was suspicious of an
  understanding between them. She also left the room, and in her own
  bedchamber, now stripped of all her personal possessions, paused, uncertain
  what to do, then went to the window and threw it up on the autumn dusk. On
  the sill was the withered stick that had once been the vivid salvia that
  Martin Rue had given her. She recalled that his glasshouses had seemed much
  neglected lately and few flowers from them were seen in the house. She closed
  the window and her hand closed over the black velvet reticule that hung from
  her waist by a silver chain; the letters were in the bottom of one of her
  trunks, but she had a little packet safely in the purse. She heard voices
  outside on the stairway and crept to her door, setting it ajar. Susan was
  asking the housemaid to bring her up a bottle of Marsala to her bedroom,
  repeating her orders in a confused fashion. Mrs. Sacret glanced up at her as
  she stood on the staircase, a brass can of hot water in her hand. Her husband
  came out into the passage below, then up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"You have sent down for more wine," he whispered reproachfully. "You had
  too much at dinner."</p>

  <p>"I want it to make me sleep," Susan muttered.</p>

  <p>"I wish sleep were so easily obtained," he replied bitterly. "I have not
  been able to sleep for weeks."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret came out onto the landing.</p>

  <p>"Let me give you some of poor Frederick's medicine," she suggested. "I
  meant to leave the recipe, as you say it does you so much good. Then I'll say
  good night and good-by&mdash;as I shall be leaving early in the morning." She
  saw, even in the uncertain light of the stairway lamp, his face clear with
  relief at that, and he accepted the medicine, more, she thought, from good
  will at her concession than a desire for it, though it had always given him
  easy slumbers.</p>

  <p>She quickly returned with a tumbler and offered it modestly to Susan, who
  was still waiting sullenly for her wine.</p>

  <p>"Do you give it to your husband, Susan, when he is ready for bed." Susan
  took the tumbler indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should take some," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, that would be too strong for you. I only take a few drops&mdash;a
  man can have more&mdash;I mixed that for Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>She watched them go upstairs. On the landing above, Mr. Rue, saying he
  would "be glad to get some sleep," accepted the glass from his wife and went
  into his dressing room. Mrs. Sacret thought that he would have lingered and
  spoken with Susan had he been alone with her.</p>

  <p>I could go up now and ask her about the money, but she is resolved to
  evade me&mdash;here is the maid with the wine&mdash;and now she goes in and
  shuts her door.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret retreated into her own room and, without lighting her lamp,
  returned to the window and leaned out, her elbows on the dusty sill, beside
  the dead plant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>§ 24</h2>

  <p class="first">She wondered what would happen, perhaps nothing. How
  intolerable this waiting was! She wished that she were free of it all, away
  across the sea, or in that enchanted landscape that the painter had evoked
  for her, that he had painted on the walls of the round room in Lyndbridge
  House ... always this waiting. Would it look better to undress? Probably,
  though the hour was still early; she began, standing in the dark, to unbutton
  her light gray bodice.</p>

  <p>Then she thought that she should light the lamp lest it would look odd,
  and had hardly set the small flame in the rosy crystal globe when there was
  an urgent knock at her door. Mrs. Sacret stood silent and Curtis entered,
  evidently frightened from her grim face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ma'am, the master is taken very ill!"</p>

  <p>"One of his usual attacks, I suppose," murmured the widow.</p>

  <p>"I don't rightly know, ma'am&mdash;he is fearfully bad&mdash;ringing of
  his bell and when I went up, he was collapsed on the floor, calling for hot
  water. Did you not hear?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was at the window. Have you fetched your mistress?"</p>

  <p>"She's asleep&mdash;already&mdash;" replied the maid reproachfully, "it's
  that last glass of wine&mdash;as the master always said, she shouldn't take
  so much. I can't arouse her, and he keeps on calling for her."</p>

  <p>"Mind what you say, pray do," rebuked Mrs. Sacret sharply, refastening her
  bodice. "I know a good deal about nursing&mdash;I was able to help your
  master before, I shall come at once."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps some of that medicine you gave him before?" suggested Curtis.</p>

  <p>"I have none left. I took the last myself, sometime ago&mdash;besides I
  saw Mrs. Rue give him a draught in a tumbler, on the stairs just now, one
  must not mix the doses. Why don't you go upstairs and attend to your
  master?"</p>

  <p>"I dare not&mdash;he is so ill."</p>

  <p>"Fie&mdash;it is probably only one of his nervous attacks&mdash;but you
  had better send one of the grooms for Dr. Virtue."</p>

  <p>"The men will be abed."</p>

  <p>"You must arouse them, if it is a matter of emergency." Mrs. Sacret went
  firmly past the agitated maid and to the dressing room beside the main
  bedroom that opened also directly onto the stairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>§ 25</h2>

  <p class="first">When Dr. Virtue arrived, two hours later, he found his
  patient unconscious on the bed that occupied one wall of the dressing room,
  while Mrs. Sacret was rubbing his chest with mustard and water. Susan, fully
  dressed, disheveled and dazed, was sitting uselessly on a chair by the
  curtained window. The housemaids were coming to and fro with cans and basins;
  the room smelled pungently of eau de cologne and lavender water.</p>

  <p>"Oh, doctor!" moaned Susan. "What is the matter? He looks like death! When
  I came in he was insensible on the floor."</p>

  <p>"Hush," put in Mrs. Sacret. "Of course it is most distressing, but it is
  only one of his usual nervous seizures." Briskly she told the doctor now
  examining Martin Rue of the sudden collapse and her own attempts to assist
  the sick man. Strong smelling salts and an emetic had relieved him, he had
  recovered his senses sufficiently to struggle onto the bed, then fainted
  again. "It is, of course, nerves," she repeated firmly.</p>

  <p>"No," announced the physician, looking up from the prone, partly undressed
  man, whose drink he still held. "Mr. Rue seems to be poisoned."</p>

  <p>"One of his nasty medicines," replied Mrs. Sacret calmly. "He <i>will</i>
  dose himself."</p>

  <p>"I mean a deadly poison&mdash;what are there in the house?"</p>

  <p>"None!" cried Susan, rising impulsively and coming to the bed unsteadily.
  "This is terrible&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"There <i>are</i> poisons in the house," corrected Mrs. Sacret coolly.
  "Mr. Rue possesses laudanum, chloroform&mdash;and camphor&mdash;that is a
  poison, is it not? Besides the gardeners would have arsenic."</p>

  <p>"This is not, I think, either laudanum or chloroform," said Dr. Virtue,
  gravely, "but some corrosive poison&mdash;his pulse is very feeble."</p>

  <p>"He has been vomiting violently," said Mrs. Sacret. "Even when half
  unconscious&mdash;he seemed in great pain, also&mdash;but I never thought of
  anything but his nerves."</p>

  <p>"I should like another opinion, can you send Rogers for Dr. Lemoine? I can
  give an injection of brandy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Susan began to weep, frantically asking "if there was any hope?"</p>

  <p>"How strange to be so desperate!" exclaimed the widow in reproof of this
  despair, but the physician said that "it would be well to prepare for the
  worst."</p>

  <p>At this Mrs. Sacret expressed herself as incredulous and enlarged on the
  suddenness of the attack and its similarity to others Mr. Rue had suffered.
  Dr. Virtue, having given his injection, searched the room, and in a small
  cabinet found the patient's Indian wicker basket of medicines, among which
  were the drugs Mrs. Sacret had mentioned. The bottles were almost full.</p>

  <p>"He had hardly time to mix himself anything," moaned Susan. "I was aroused
  before I had undressed&mdash;it was only a few moments since I had parted
  from him."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," corrected Mrs. Sacret sharply. "You were very heavily
  asleep&mdash;it must have been half an hour before you came in. I was here
  much sooner, but there could have been time for him to have dosed
  himself."</p>

  <p>"You had better go to your room, Mrs. Rue," advised the physician. "Mrs.
  Sacret is an admirable nurse, and you have not the strength for what you
  might have to witness if you stayed," and he looked at her with the
  inevitable exasperation of a medical man for a woman who loses her
  self-control in a crisis.</p>

  <p>But Susan would not go. Shaking her head and weeping, she returned to the
  chair by the window.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>§ 26</h2>

  <p class="first">"Mrs. Sacret did what had to be done for the sick man while
  Dr. Virtue waited downstairs for Dr. Lemoine. She carried out his directions
  scrupulously. The room was clean, perfumed, the linen fresh, the fomentations
  constantly renewed, the maids dutifully at the orders of one so capable. But
  uneasy reflections were spinning in Mrs. Sacret's mind as she went about her
  duties. She had been extremely startled when the physician had spoken so
  immediately and so confidently of poison. She had expected this illness to
  pass as the others had passed&mdash;as a nervous seizure. The medical opinion
  altered her plans considerably. There was much she could not dwell
  on&mdash;there was much she must carefully resolve. It was still dark when
  Dr. Lemoine arrived. Mrs. Sacret heard his carriage wheels and, going to the
  window and pulling the curtains apart, saw his carriage lights.</p>

    <p class="caption">"On the Set of "So Evil My Love" &mdash; Ann Todd and
    the Make-up Artist</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Do collect yourself," she whispered tartly to Susan, "this is a serious
  situation."</p>

  <p>Susan gave her a wild glance.</p>

  <p>"But you won't make it an excuse to stay, will you? I can manage, I shall
  get a nurse."</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall stay, as you can't get the money."</p>

  <p>"It is coming&mdash;a messenger is bringing it&mdash;and the jewels, about
  midday."</p>

  <p>"You fool! Why didn't you tell me!"</p>

  <p>"I was going to, but Martin pulled me away."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret controlled herself with a strong effort.</p>

  <p>"Do watch out and <i>be careful</i>, Susan," she whispered, "and mind you
  give me that money, <i>secretly</i>, the moment it comes and then I shall
  leave the house."</p>

  <p>With this she hastened downstairs and arrived in the hall as Curtis was
  admitting Dr. Lemoine. Snatching at his sleeve she said, with the accent and
  look of terror: "Oh, I am sure he has taken poison! Chloroform!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Virtue came out of the dining room and overheard. "That is a grave
  statement, Mrs. Sacret&mdash;it amounts to a charge of attempted
  suicide&mdash;you did not say anything of this to me."</p>

  <p>"I did not like to mention it, I supposed he would recover&mdash;now he
  seems worse, and I must speak. When I first ran in to him he
  moaned&mdash;lying on the floor in agony&mdash;'I have taken poison for
  Curle.'"</p>

  <p>"Pray be prudent!" exclaimed Dr. Virtue, startled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have no idea what this household is like&mdash;how jealous he was
  and what cause she gave!" sobbed the widow.</p>

  <p>The two physicians went upstairs, sent the distracted wife out of the room
  and made their examination together. The two friends waited in Susan's
  bedroom, where a pink shaded lamp was burning and, at Mrs. Sacret's orders, a
  small fire had been lit.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you take on so, Susan. Remember&mdash;if this illness should be
  fatal, it would be a happy solution to your problem."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand&mdash;it is absolutely horrible&mdash;I never saw
  anyone so ill before&mdash;he is so yellow and shrunken."</p>

  <p>"Bah! All sickness is disgusting. I had enough with Frederick and hope to
  see no more of it. But you need not stay in the room. You are quite useless,
  and <i>I</i> am doing everything. <i>I</i> feel exhausted and
  nauseated&mdash;I dealt with that horrible vomiting."</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;I feel sick myself."</p>

  <p>"Ask for some wine, Curtis won't refuse you now. I have no more in my
  room&mdash;you drank the last yesterday. Do keep your spirits up a little.
  You will have to take in that money and sign a receipt for it, if you wish to
  get rid of me."</p>

  <p>Susan took this advice, which was also that of the physicians when they
  returned from the dressing room; the wretched wife was unfit to remain on her
  feet, and though she refused to undress, lay on her bed, covered by an eider
  down, after swallowing a glass of Marsala.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret returned to the sickroom and assumed charge of the household.
  She listened gravely to the medical opinion&mdash;"dying of a powerful
  irritant poison"&mdash;and suggested that a specialist should be sent for,
  and mentioned a distant cousin of Martin Rue's she had heard of, the
  well-known Sir Charles Collier, of Harley Street, and senior physician of
  King's College Hospital. Drs. Virtue and Lemoine readily agreed, they were
  obviously at a loss and glad to share their authority. They also suggested
  that old Mrs. Rue should be sent for, and the widow was obliged to agree
  without being able to reflect whether this would suit her plans or not.</p>

  <p>So, about five o'clock in the morning the brougham was sent to fetch Sir
  Charles, and the landau to fetch the patient's mother.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards Martin Rue recovered consciousness and Dr. Virtue at
  once began to question him. "What have you been dosing yourself with? Are you
  clear in your mind? Do you know me and understand what I am saying?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well." The hoarse voice coming with difficulty from the swollen
  lips made the attentive widow start a little. It was almost as if she had
  heard the dead speak, the sick man seemed to have been silent so
  long&mdash;yes, the sleepless night had been very long. She trembled where
  she stood, feeling greatly fatigued.</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear fellow, what have you been taking?"</p>

  <p>"I rubbed my face with a little laudanum for neuralgia and I may have
  swallowed some," came the difficult whisper.</p>

  <p>"Laudanum won't explain your symptoms," said Dr. Virtue, to which the sick
  man replied wearily, "I have taken nothing else&mdash;no, if it wasn't that,
  I don't know what it was."</p>

  <p>"You spoke of having taken poison to Mrs. Sacret," put in Dr. Lemoine.
  "What was it and why did you take it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember saying that&mdash;I was suddenly ill, and called out for
  Susan."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret drew Dr. Virtue aside and whispered.</p>

  <p>"It is true&mdash;I should have told you&mdash;he said, 'I have swallowed
  poison but don't tell Susan.'"</p>

  <p>"Did you not demand what poison?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I was too alarmed&mdash;I rushed for an emetic that I gave. He
  was soon unconscious."</p>

  <p>Returning to the bedside, Dr. Virtue repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"Did you not take poison?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing but the laudanum."</p>

  <p>"Is there any poison in the house?"</p>

  <p>"The laudanum and chloroform in my medicine basket, and rat poison in the
  stable."</p>

  <p>The doctors drew apart, bewildered and uneasy. Mrs. Sacret came forward
  and took up her station, relieving as she could the paroxysms of the sick
  man, that again began to shake him with agony.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>§ 27</h2>

  <p class="first">When Sir Charles Collier arrived at the Old Priory, the
  daylight was flowing into the sickroom, and the patient was partially
  unconscious. All Mrs. Sacret's experience and care had not availed to rid the
  room of disorder, disagreeable odors and the unpleasant litter attendant on a
  serious illness; 'she, also, looked pale and slightly disheveled. Both the
  attendant physicians spoke warmly of her skillful and energetic nursing.</p>

  <p>Martin Rue glared from his pillows with sunken, red and angry eyes.
  Questioned yet again by Sir Charles Collier as to what he had taken he
  replied with weak anger&mdash;"If I knew I should not have sent for
  you&mdash;what the devil do I want three doctors for if I know what is wrong
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Disease won't account for your state," said Sir Charles gravely. "You are
  poisoned and must know, tell us how you came by it."</p>

  <p>"I have said all I know."</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing on your mind? You are in grave danger."</p>

  <p>"I should like my wife to come. I have left her everything&mdash;she is my
  sole executrix. I have not led a religious life."</p>

  <p>"Fetch Mrs. Rue," said Sir Charles.</p>

  <p>Dr. Virtue left the room. The sick man turned about in a spasm of
  pain.</p>

  <p>"Has the vomiting ceased?" asked Sir Charles, turning to the
  self-appointed nurse.</p>

  <p>"About an hour ago&mdash;he seems too weak now."</p>

  <p>"Nothing was kept?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no of course not. I had to see that the room was fresh."</p>

  <p>The sick man seemed to overhear this and muttered: "What a fuss. I hope
  I'm buried quietly. Such a fuss. Where is Susan?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Virtue has gone to fetch her, she has been resting. Now think again,
  Martin, you have taken much more than laudanum. If you can tell us what it is
  it may help us to find an antidote," urged Sir Charles, bending over the
  piled pillows where Martin Rue lay slackly.</p>

  <p>"Before God, I took only laudanum."</p>

  <p>"If you die without telling us," said Dr. Lemoine, "someone may be
  suspected of having poisoned you."</p>

  <p>"I know, but I can tell you nothing more."</p>

  <p>Dr. Virtue returned, supporting Susan, who appeared little refreshed by
  her few hours' rest. Curtis had helped her to change her dress, and she wore
  a loose dressing gown with pale yellow lace flounces. At sight of her, the
  sick man tried to struggle up in bed and gasped, "What a bother I am to you,
  Susie, do forgive me."</p>

  <p>This was the first time that the widow had heard the use of this pet name.
  It angered her to see how blind was Martin Rue's faith in his wife&mdash;how
  strange that he did not suspect her! How stupid of him to feel this loving
  confidence, and to have reaffirmed his will that left her everything! She
  would be a rich woman indeed, and with no one to oversee her expenditure.
  That thousand pounds would be but a small advance.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret took the chair by the window place where Susan had sat the day
  before and watched the scene taking place around the bed that she had so
  frequently attended to during the past tedious hours, rearranging, changing
  soiled linen, smoothing pillows and coverlet.</p>

  <p>The physicians were men of elegant and distinguished appearance. Despite
  the hasty summons after they had retired to bed, they were formally dressed,
  and each had an air of serene, detached authority that contrasted sharply
  with the dreadful aspect of the dying man, and the haggard misery of his
  wife. Sir Charles, in particular, had a handsome appearance. With the
  confident aspect of early success and a gravely responsible post, he looked
  with a piercing earnestness from his patient to the weeping woman who drooped
  over him, wailing incoherently, and frowned in the absolute concentration of
  his attention. Slightly behind him were the other two doctors, silent and
  watchful.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret triumphantly compared them all with the painter, to their
  disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Martin Rue, in contrast to the dark and heavy attire of the physicians,
  wore only a nightshirt that he had torn open on his chest that was covered,
  like his chin, with light-colored hairs.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Martin, Martin! Who would have thought it would have come to this,"
  moaned Susan, and the sick man seemed to glow with pleasure at her distress
  on his behalf, even in the throes of his own deadly pain.</p>

  <p>"There, there, Susie&mdash;I shall be all right."</p>

  <p>"Martin&mdash;" interrupted Sir Charles gravely. "You must consider your
  situation and all you say and do. I can give you no hope."</p>

  <p>"I know that&mdash;I know I am going to appear before my Maker&mdash;I
  have spoken the truth&mdash;I have told them all that I have taken nothing
  hut laudanum."</p>

  <p>"I must accept that," replied the physician, and turning to his colleagues
  he bade them bear witness to what the dying man had said, adding that he
  believed him to be fully conscious and in complete possession of his
  senses.</p>

  <p>"Is there really no hope for me?" whispered Martin Rue, fumbling for his
  wife's limp hand on his pillow. "Now&mdash;if Susie really cares a little,
  I'd like to have another chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is hardly any life in you, I fear," answered Sir Charles. "Do,
  pray, consider that."</p>

  <p>"Can I have something to relieve this infernal pain?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret came forward.</p>

  <p>"I am sure the mustard poultices help him," she urged.</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Sir Charles. "He has been tormented enough already."</p>

  <p>"Then some doses of <i>arsenicum</i>&mdash;he has it in his medicine
  chest."</p>

  <p>"I ordered that before," explained Dr. Virtue. "It relieved the sickness,
  but now that is over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As if soothed by his wife's close presence, the patient fell into a
  slumber or stupor, and Susan withdrew silently and quickly.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles advised both the ladies to take some refreshment and repose.
  There was nothing more that anyone could do for Martin Rue.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>§ 28</h2>

  <p class="first">Olivia Sacret waked from a light sleep to find that it was
  past midday by the blue enamel traveling clock on her bedside table. She
  rose, adjusted her hair and dress and went lightly through the hushed house
  to Susan's room.</p>

  <p>"How punctual you are!"</p>

  <p>The widow looked keenly at her friend who was pacing about restlessly,
  still wearing her dressing gown.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have just wakened. Have you the money? Was the messenger punctual,
  also? How is your husband?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the bank messenger came, at the stroke. No one noticed
  him&mdash;there are so many people in the house now, five doctors, old Mrs.
  Rue and her maid&mdash;and no one thinks of anything else save Martin. I was
  able to watch out and go to the door myself. I signed the receipt&mdash;here
  is the gold."</p>

  <p>Susan spoke rapidly, almost incoherently, in a slurred tone; the widow
  noticed glasses marked by milk and wine on the dressing table. She began to
  feel a pang of hunger herself.</p>

  <p>"Five doctors!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I sent for two others before Sir Charles came&mdash;and old Mrs. Rue
  brought her own. Martin is the same, asleep or in a swoon. Here is the money,
  packets of sovereigns, as you asked&mdash;two chamois leather bags and a
  case&mdash;here are the emeralds, too. Now will you give me the
  letters&mdash;and go?"</p>

  <p>"How bulky and heavy&mdash;I never thought it would be so&mdash;never
  mind, I wanted it in gold. Yes, I am going, and you shall have the letters. I
  shall fetch them."</p>

  <p>"Do be quick and secret," implored Susan. "Mrs. Rue is desperate. I don't
  know what she thinks or what I think. Oh, where can Martin have got this
  horrible stuff! His mother is watching me, but would not leave him so I was
  able to slip away to the door!"</p>

  <p>"He took it himself," whispered Mrs. Sacret. "He told me so&mdash;and do
  control yourself&mdash;it is well known what terms you were on and this
  emotion will seem overacted."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>§ 29</h2>

  <p class="first">The widow did not return to her friend's bedroom, but left
  the house with her luggage, including the letters, safely at the bottom of a
  trunk and the gold and jewels in a bulky hand valise; she had not had time to
  do more than take a glance at the emeralds in the green leather case but she
  had seen that a splendid treasure was set in the white velvet lining. Rogers
  fetched a cab for her, as both the carriages had been out that night, and
  helped carry her considerable baggage, but Curtis ran up to her in the hall
  and expressed dismay at her departure. "Surely, ma'am, you won't leave the
  poor mistress, now!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you would be glad to see me go," smiled Mrs. Sacret. "You've
  never been very civil, Curtis. You would never do my hair. Never mind, I
  learned to do it myself. I really don't know if I can return or not. I have
  my own affairs to attend to&mdash;no doubt Mr. Rue, who has his wife and
  mother with him, will soon recover."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>§ 30</h2>

  <p class="first">The painter was waiting for Mrs. Sacret at Minton Street,
  and assisted the cabman, under the quizzical gaze of the neighbors, on
  doorsteps and at windows, to take her trunks into the house.</p>

  <p>As soon as the parlor door was shut on them, the widow gave the valise to
  Mark Bellis and told her story. When she had finished she felt exhausted and
  was trembling. She could not judge from his expression if he was pleased with
  her conduct.</p>

  <p>"You lack sleep and food," he remarked kindly. "You must keep your
  nerve."</p>

  <p>"When do we leave London?" she interrupted. "I am well enough&mdash;let us
  get away."</p>

  <p>"You must return to the Old Priori!"</p>

  <p>"No. I really cannot&mdash;you have no idea what it is like
  there&mdash;this horrible illness."</p>

  <p>"It is not your fault or mine," replied the painter. "If this melancholy
  fellow chooses to poison himself&mdash;as you say he has done. But you must
  be with your friend."</p>

  <p>"You have the money&mdash;and the jewels," she protested. "What more do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"Pray control yourself." The warning she had given Susan sounded bitter,
  she rose and sat down again from weakness.</p>

  <p>"The illness was needless, as it seems," he smiled, "a pity, perhaps, that
  you did not understand that the money was coming this morning. Since you were
  so successful with this expedient it would have been better had you carried
  it through, then we could have gone ahead together as we had planned."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;the <i>other</i>&mdash;was your&mdash;<i>plan</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What other?" He gave her a cold look that silenced her at once and added,
  "You must return to the Old Priory and stand by your friend. If Mr. Rue dies,
  I suppose there will be an inquest&mdash;these doctors are sharper than one
  might have supposed. And five of them! Who would have imagined such anxiety
  on the part of a truant wife! However, it may be for the best. She will be
  free, and Lady Curle, I suppose&mdash;if the affair is carried off
  decorously&mdash;and you will be her good friend to whom she will be very
  generous. Yes, both she and Sir John will be extremely obliged to
  you&mdash;they will never forget those letters."</p>

  <p>"But I do not want to go back. I don't feel as if I could endure it. I
  don't want to see any of them again, do let us go away, as you promised."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he agreed readily. "Tomorrow, perhaps, or the day after. I
  can easily get the tickets altered. You are fatigued now, and must rest here
  on the sofa, but you must return to the Old Priory&mdash;if only to make
  inquiries about Mr. Rue&mdash;it would look so odd if you didn't."</p>

  <p>"Would it matter if it <i>did</i> look odd? We shall be gone&mdash;never
  to have anything to do with them again."</p>

  <p>"We might be traced," he replied. "There is an extradition treaty now with
  every country save Spain&mdash;France&mdash;Italy. Not easy to hide
  there&mdash;especially for your sort of woman."</p>

  <p>"What sort of woman am I?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Inexperienced&mdash;very delightful, someday soon I'll tell you." He
  smiled, took her hand and caressed it delicately, while she, seated in the
  beehive chair, looked up at him beseechingly. His expression was thoughtful.
  She noted the slight elegant hollows of his cheeks and jaws, the winglike
  sweep of his eyebrows that almost met above his clear-cut nose, his gray
  eyes, clear and vivid, that shifted and stared aside, as if intent on some
  ever-moving object invisible to her vision.</p>

  <p>"Tell me who you are and what you propose to do with me."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense&mdash;you know&mdash;I have told you."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe anything you said." She thought of the romantic tale she
  had invented for him, the noble family, the haughty revolt against
  convention, the heroic life of bold adventure. None of this fitted with his
  actions since she had met him, but his appearance was very apt to the part
  she had assigned him in her fantasy. She sighed because her own
  self-deception was beginning to be insufficient to sustain her; she gazed
  round the room, very untidy, even dirty, with a litter of painter's rubbish,
  cigars, wine bottles and oyster shells on the table and her portrait turned
  face to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Do you have people here?" she asked with the sudden sensation that
  someone else had been in her home.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I sit here alone and dream of you. I don't even have a
  woman in to clean up, as you can see. How strange your smart luggage looks
  here in contrast to my own poor trunk! Do you remember when you sat on it as
  a model's throne?"</p>

  <p>"You showed me what I wanted to be&mdash;in that picture, a beauty, a fine
  lady&mdash;I'm not either."</p>

  <p>"I'll show you what you are, one of these days."</p>

  <p>"Do you love me?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I ask you to marry me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, too easily. As if it didn't matter."</p>

  <p>"You are so shrewd," he smiled, "that I wonder that you make so many
  mistakes."</p>

  <p>"What mistakes have I made?"</p>

  <p>"Not making sure about the money last night&mdash;not wanting to return to
  the Old Priory. Others, perhaps. And what do you know about love that you are
  so critical? You are cold, you know, and a prude."</p>

  <p>"But you? I have watched Susan&mdash;there is love there and passion. I
  saw this in Sir John, also&mdash;they loved, loved these two&mdash;imagine,
  respectable as they are, they went to all the risk and trouble of an illicit
  affair. How they contrived it I don't know, while you&mdash;with all your
  opportunities have hardly&mdash;touched me."</p>

  <p>"I have taught you something, at least; you would not have made that
  speech when we first met. If I didn't make love to you it was because it
  wasn't necessary."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you were the master without that?"</p>

  <p>"You know I don't. I intend to marry you. We have youth a long time before
  us. You are not a cheap creature like Susan Rue for a hole and corner
  affair."</p>

  <p>She was intensely flattered and smiled, more to herself than to him, as if
  she congratulated herself on a triumph. Not so many women would have come out
  of this intrigue as unblemished as she was; she felt invigorated and able to
  put through further tedium at the Old Priory. On the impulse of her pleasure
  she took Martin Rue's parting gift from her hand valise and offered it to the
  painter. He accepted it gravely, declaring that he would keep it for her to
  spend in Paris. "You shall have the most charming dresses, furs and laces. I
  know the places to take you."</p>

  <p>She had forgotten that he had recently objected to visiting France or
  Italy, and asked him if he had been paid for the wall paintings at Lyndbridge
  House.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;a miserable sum! Mrs. Fox Oldham is dead in
  Lausanne&mdash;lucky for us."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"The mansion will be shut up, no one will go there, no one will hear of
  your visit, there won't be any questions asked about me. I was rather
  counting on this when I took you."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose it would matter if it were known&mdash;you wiped off the
  sketches you made for me to see."</p>

  <p>"You are confused. I made no sketches for you. Come, will you rest here
  awhile?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I feel energetic now. I can go to bed early tonight. It won't do
  to stay here too long. I am supposed to be seeing you about the tenancy of
  the house only."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;whatever happens, come here again tomorrow, about ten
  o'clock. I don't see why we shouldn't leave then&mdash;or the next day. We
  can go separately to the station."</p>

  <p>The widow felt slightly giddy as she rose, but soon steadied herself.
  Grasping his hands in hers, she offered her smooth face for his kiss,
  deliberately and with some wonder.</p>

  <p>He touched her forehead with his lips and she heard him laugh, as if he
  also was astonished.</p>

  <p>With an air of respect, almost of deference, he escorted her from the
  house and to High Street where he soon found her a hackney cab.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>§ 31</h2>

  <p class="first">When Mrs. Sacret returned to the Old Priory, she saw at once
  that the holland blinds were down. Curtis, weeping, met her in the hall.
  Martin Rue had died about an hour ago, Curtis had been in the room, helping,
  as the mistress was quite useless, and the old lady seemed "turned to stone."
  The master had begged her "to be kind to poor Susan, who has been the best of
  wives to me," and his mother had muttered that she was "always kind to
  everyone."</p>

  <p>"It is very sad," agreed Mrs. Sacret. "You must be quite worn out. I
  declare I am. I hurried back&mdash;not even settling my business. Can I do
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it is very good of you, ma'am," said the humbled Curtis. "The
  mistress isn't fit for anything&mdash;and the old lady has shut herself into
  her own room&mdash;she's at the back&mdash;and there is not one of the
  doctors will give a death certificate."</p>

  <p>"That means an inquest, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am. Dr. Virtue thought you might take charge for the
  mistress."</p>

  <p>"I shall see to it at once."</p>

  <p>After a brief interview with the physician, Mrs. Sacret sent a note to the
  coroner's office.</p>

  <p class="letter">THE OLD PRIORY, CLAPHAM<br>
  September 25, 1865<br>
  <br>
  Mrs. Martin Rue desires the inquest to be held at the Old Priory where she
  will have refreshments prepared for the jury.</p>

  <p>In her able hands the household, so sadly disrupted, resumed a routine,
  skillfully altered for the dismal occasion. With both the ladies overcome by
  emotion and unable to leave their beds the widow had everything to attend to;
  the inquest was fixed for three days ahead and she would be an important
  witness. It was therefore impossible for her to hope to leave London until
  this solemn affair was over, she could only do so by a flight that would be,
  she was aware, extremely imprudent. Nor was she able to keep her appointment
  with the painter, but sent instead the gardener's boy with a formal letter to
  her tenant, regretting that she was prevented from visiting the house to
  settle matters appertaining to the end of his tenancy. With Susan's example
  ever before her mind she was very careful how she committed herself on
  paper.</p>

  <p>Her first pang of disappointment, her first horror of the Old Priory now
  it was a house of mourning, soon passed with a sense of her own importance
  and power. She played the lady of the mansion very well; the servants
  respected if they did not like her, there was no disorder, no confusion; a
  sedate decorum was maintained, together with comfort for everyone. With Dr.
  Virtue's help she arranged for the funeral, the flowers, the food and drink,
  the adaptation of the dining room into a coroner's court and the garden room
  into a mortuary chapel. She also ordered the mourning for everyone, including
  herself, and answered the notes of condolence, besides acknowledging the
  floral wreaths and crosses that arrived from the friends and acquaintances of
  the young man so suddenly and so shockingly dead.</p>

  <p>On the second day, old Mrs. Rue made her appearance at the breakfast
  table; she had not needed to change her attire, being permanently in crape.
  She shot the younger widow a malevolent glance. Anger more than grief seemed
  to possess her, and only the presence of Dr. Virtue who was staying in the
  Old Priory seemed to restrain her from violent speech. Even as it was she
  commented bitterly on her son's will, in which no one was even mentioned
  besides his wife, remarking that he would "never have made it if he was in
  his right mind."</p>

  <p>"That won't hold, madam," said Dr. Virtue, who did not like her. "Your son
  was perfectly clear in his senses, I can testify to that, and the will is
  reasonable enough, since he had no near relations save yourself who are well
  provided for."</p>

  <p>"At least," put in Mrs. Sacret from behind the silver tea urn, "no
  outsider has received anything&mdash;there is not as much as a legacy to one
  of the servants."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rue knew that his wife would see to that," said the doctor. "It is
  agreeable to observe how loyal and devoted everyone is&mdash;though the
  contents of the will is known."</p>

  <p>When he had left the two ladies alone, old Mrs. Rue spoke bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Why are you in my daughter-in-law's place?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Virtue asked me to help, poor Susan is ill." Mrs. Sacret smiled,
  adding: "You must admit that I am quite disinterested&mdash;I have not been
  left a penny, and as soon as the inquest is over, I am going abroad."</p>

  <p>"There is something I don't understand. I am sure of that&mdash;and that
  you have a hold over that wretched woman."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret rose with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Please don't allow your spite to run away with you at this dreadful,
  dreadful time, with your son lying dead upstairs."</p>

  <p>The old woman moved convulsively. A stale odor of violet cachet stirred
  from her bombazine and worsted dress, her mottled face twisted and her eyes,
  ringed by the first horny circles of cataract, filmed with the difficult
  tears of age. "My son, my son," she repeated, then made an effort of
  surprising energy. "Yes, you are right, brutal and insolent as you are. I
  shall have to allow this farce to continue and wait my chance."</p>

  <p>The younger widow left the room, she did not concern herself at all about
  the dead man's mother whom she would probably never see again. She was
  enjoying the ease and authority her position gave her while anticipating in
  her thoughts the very different future she would have with Mark Bellis, when
  this tedious and sordid episode was over, and buried and forgotten with
  Martin Rue. Curtis asked her to visit Susan and she found the newly made
  widow in a chair by the fire, disfigured from weeping and bending forward to
  warm her hands at the flames that scorched her swollen face.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would return, Olivia," she muttered, "though you promised
  not to do so. Still you have been useful&mdash;thank you."</p>

  <p>"I have done everything for you," smiled Mrs. Sacret, seating herself
  opposite. "I only returned for that, and for the look of the thing&mdash;I am
  going abroad immediately after the inquest."</p>

  <p>"How could poor Martin have done it!" whimpered Susan. "Such suffering! I
  cannot bear to think of it!"</p>

  <p>"You must leave it all to the jury, dear. Pray don't upset yourself. And
  be discreet."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, don't write to&mdash;anyone in York Chambers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have not so much as thought of him!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose that you will, in time. Nov, I think it would be better if we
  didn't talk of this&mdash;is there anything else you want to say?"</p>

  <p>Susan began to weep, then sobbed: "That odious old woman and her
  doctor&mdash;Dr. Balance&mdash;she brought him with her&mdash;she came to see
  me about it, when I couldn't hold my head up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Susan? This is quite incoherent."</p>

  <p>"I don't know myself. She seemed to threaten, and said she wasn't
  satisfied and swore to get at the bottom of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let her try," replied Mrs. Sacret composedly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do advise me! I don't understand any of it! What did Martin
  <i>take?</i>"</p>

  <p>"The post-mortem will reveal that, I suppose. Of course, it is all very
  revolting. But it will soon be over, and then you will be a wealthy woman,
  and free."</p>

  <p>"I want to get away&mdash;I shall take Curtis and go away to the seaside,
  Brighton perhaps."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt very contemptuous of this weakness and stupidity</p>

  <p>How rich her own future appeared compared to Susan's silly plans!</p>

  <p>She would he very rich, with a wealthy titled lover waiting for her, and
  Susan could think of nothing better than going to Brighton with a servant!
  And meanwhile she was quite ruining that florid beauty that the three men who
  had been drawn to her had probably found her sole attraction. Would not even
  the infatuated Sir John think Susan a bore without her fresh good looks?</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret glanced with satisfaction in the Venetian glass framed
  mirror above the alabaster mantelpiece, and admired her own precise features
  that no tears had ever smeared. She would have more sense than ever to risk
  losing Mark Bellis by these foolish, unbecoming emotional displays.</p>

  <p>"Do go to bed," she advised curtly, "and do be careful what you say. You
  can't come to any harm if you are prudent&mdash;don't concern yourself about
  that old hag or her insolent doctor."</p>

  <p>She hastened away, really thankful that Susan was too distracted to pester
  her as usual about the letters.</p>

  <p>The bedroom, now impersonal, and with none of her possessions
  about&mdash;she had brought only a suitcase with her&mdash;did not depress
  her; her mind was so set on the future that she had ceased to notice the Old
  Priory's ugly and dreary atmosphere. She did not even see, as she drew down
  her blind that she had raised a few inches during the day, the dry and poor
  sticks in a sooty pot on her window sill that had once been the gorgeous
  salvia that Martin Rue had given her. She slept well that night from physical
  exhaustion, not disturbed by any dreams, nor by the presence of the dead
  under the same roof.</p>

  <p>The morning brought a letter from the painter; he had received her note,
  he wrote, and understood that he could not hope to see her until after the
  inquest. He would expect her at Minton Street at 10:00 A.M. the day following
  that event.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret's spirits rose with increasing expectancy of happiness to
  come. She was prepared to enjoy the little drama&mdash;as it appeared to
  her&mdash;of this routine inquiry, where she was such a sympathetic and
  admired figure, the brave capable woman, who had, without any reward, stood
  by her friend in such a horrid crisis and taken all material burdens off her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>Everyone, save old Mrs. Rue and Dr. Balance, who kept themselves apart,
  tacitly agreed that the verdict would be <i>felo-de-se</i> and Mrs. Sacret
  thought comfortably of the painter's needless doubts as to the wisdom of
  traveling to Paris or Italy. He had regretfully remarked that the physicians
  had proved shrewder than might have been expected. Though dealing with a man
  continually ill and dosing himself with, no doubt, dangerous drugs, they had
  not diagnosed either nerves or an excess of laudanum or chloroform, but all
  had agreed, at once, on a corrosive poison as the cause of this fatal
  malady.</p>

  <p>If this attitude had been vexatious, both to Mrs. Sacret and the painter,
  the acceptance of the suicide theory was grateful. He seemed to be
  appreciative of her efforts in this direction for he had written&mdash;"so
  much will depend on your evidence at the inquest."</p>

  <p>Yes, he understood quite well the part that she had undertaken and that
  she would play very well to the end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>§ 32</h2>

  <p class="first">The day of the inquest Mrs. Sacret entered the glasshouses
  from the garden door. It was agreeable to leave the autumn damp for the close
  warm air. The plants hung neglected in the wire baskets, the yellow, sapless
  leaves clinging to the flaccid stems of creepers unknown to the curious
  woman, some pots on the shelves showing crinkled blooms, others curling in
  contentive luxuriance. The widow wondered what would become of the
  conservatory&mdash;what, indeed, of the Old Priory? Probably it would be
  sold&mdash;Sir John Curle would surely never tolerate this hideous place.
  Pausing to breathe the genial atmosphere Mrs. Sacret considered the changed
  situation. Susan was free. Without scandal or trouble she could, after a
  decent interval, marry her wealthy baronet and gracefully take up a new
  existence as lady of the village, a position so irreproachable that no one
  would venture to recall that she had ever been "talked of" with the important
  gentleman who was now her third husband.</p>

  <p>What sort of a "hold" (the expression was ineffaceable from Mrs. Sacret's
  mind) would the letters be over Lady Curle? Quite a firm hold, the widow
  considered. It was certain that neither the baronet nor his wife would desire
  any reminder of their early and indiscreet friendship during the lifetime of
  the first Lady Curle.</p>

  <p>The widow approached the glass door that gave into the dull little library
  where Martin Rue had interviewed her on several occasions; it was curious to
  be looking out of the conservatory, instead of looking in. She peered into
  partial darkness, for the yellow holland blinds were drawn and the only light
  came from the glass doors and that she herself largely blocked. But she could
  see the outlines of the formal crosses and wreaths, blank white flowers,
  stiffly arranged, piled precisely about the smooth oak coffin with the
  glittering brass handles, the duller white of the black-edged cards. She
  reflected on the swiftness of the services connected with death&mdash;how
  soon Martin Rue had been disposed of! How soon they had all been clothed in
  mourning! The fashionable dressmaker had crape garments ready for sudden
  bereavements, she had discovered, and with a few stitches made them fit any
  figure. Mrs. Sacret fingered the glossy silk of her own billowing skirts,
  sumptuously flounced over a bustle in the latest mode, and she smiled on the
  reflection of how much more costly was this mourning than the shabby weeds in
  which she had first come to the Old Priory. But she would be relieved when
  she could put off this somber black, and again wear the rich and fanciful
  garments that the painter had told her to put aside and that now lay in the
  bottom of one of the trunks waiting at Minton Street.</p>

  <p>She retreated through the glasshouses that she had entered only through a
  whim, because she liked to feel free to enter a place hitherto forbidden to
  her, and passed around the back of the house, along the well-raked garden
  path, flanked by overcrowded shrubbery and gaunt straggling trees. Three
  people were slowly pacing ahead of her, old Mrs. Rue, her physician, Dr.
  Balance, and another of the medical men Susan had so frantically called in,
  Dr. Mallard. Both men were young for their positions, the first fair, with an
  air of uncommon vigor, the second dark and sedate; all were discoursing
  earnestly together and gave the merest gesture of recognition as Mrs. Sacret
  passed them. She thought it impertinent of them to be so constantly "about
  the house" since Dr. Balance had never been asked by Susan to attend her
  husband, but had been brought by old Mrs. Rue&mdash;and Dr. Mallard was
  younger than the other physicians who had the case in hand. Indeed, they had
  had little to do with the sick man&mdash;and had not been desired to assist
  in the post-mortem&mdash;and she doubted if they would give evidence at the
  inquest.</p>

  <p>As she passed these three people, the old woman raised her voice and said
  in firm, thin tones: "My son never took his own life."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>§ 33</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret was surprised to find the inquest so quiet, even
  humdrum; there was nothing exciting or lively about this judicial inquiry
  into what was a most unexpected and violent death coming to a young and
  harmless man in his own home.</p>

  <p>Dr. Virtue opened with routine statements as to the fatal illness of Mr.
  Martin Rue, then Mrs. Sacret, graceful in her expensive silk with the crape
  flounces, cambric collar and cuffs, and goffered bonnet, stood up before the
  long dining table behind which the jury were seated and serenely gave her
  evidence as to the illness of Martin Rue, her nursing of him, and his
  confession that he had taken poison and her repetition of this to Dr. Lemoine
  and Dr. Virtue. She did not now state, however, that the sick man had
  declared, "I do this for Curle."</p>

  <p>The coroner, who was a neighbor of the Rues', and was concerned to spare
  this unfortunate family all possible distress, was sympathetic with this
  gentle witness. His courteous questions were directed toward drawing out from
  the witness all evidence that would prove suicide.</p>

  <p>The servants were called next, but had nothing to add to Mrs. Sacret's
  statements. A business colleague testified to the dead man's recent low
  spirits and fits of gloom, and Dr. Virtue, recalled, stated that he had had
  Mr. Rue under his care for some months for vague nervous trouble. Dr. Lemoine
  gave the findings of the post-mortem. Despite the previous evidence, deceased
  had been healthy, there was no trace of disease. Portions of the organs
  having been sent to an analyst his report was read. Poison had been
  found&mdash;antimony, taken in the form of tartar emetic. The physicians and
  servants being recalled to comment on this all agreed that Martin Rue had
  been "dosing himself" for years and might well have kept antimony in the form
  of tartar emetic in his Indian medicine basket, though none had been found
  there. It was an almost colorless fluid, bluish white, and tasteless. None of
  the remains of the food and drink consumed by the dead man had been kept, nor
  any of the matter he had rejected during his illness. No one had given any
  thought to this until Mrs. Sacret had several times cleaned the room linen
  and all the vessels used.</p>

  <p>All the physicians declared that the sick man had repeatedly and solemnly
  denied having taken anything dangerous save a few drops of laudanum.</p>

  <p>The deceased's mother, Drs. Balance and Mallard wished to give evidence,
  but the coroner refused to call them; he did not require, either, the
  evidence of the widow, who was not even present.</p>

  <p>Closing the inquiry, the coroner directed the jury to bring in a verdict
  of <i>felo-de-se</i>.</p>

  <p>The men seated, rather awkwardly, on the ornate chairs behind the dining
  table, did not respond to this lead. Without leaving their places they
  returned an open verdict&mdash;"The deceased died from the effects of
  antimony poisoning, but there is not sufficient evidence to show how it came
  into his body."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34"></a>§ 34</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret took this news to Susan who was lying on her bed
  in a darkened room, pale and ravaged in her stiff new mourning, her bright
  hair tumbled into knots on the top of her head.</p>

  <p>"Now that is over," said Mrs. Sacret gently. "Your poor husband will be
  buried tomorrow and you need never think of him again!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall always think of him!" wept the widow, hiding her face in the
  pillow.</p>

  <p>"Really? Have you always thought of Captain Dasent?"</p>

  <p>Susan only sobbed the louder at this cruelty.</p>

  <p>"It is the <i>way</i> he died&mdash;to know that he took his own life, in
  that horrible, horrible manner, and, because of me&mdash;the unkindness there
  was between us!"</p>

  <p>"All this trouble is ended. You are weak to lament so, pray consider how
  lucky you are&mdash;the verdict might have been much worse."</p>

  <p>"Lucky? Worse? I don't understand!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you? Never mind then. It is all over&mdash;the jury have been
  refreshed and have left. So have the doctors, and the servants all had wine
  and cake. Really the whole affair was a great deal of trouble and the bills
  will be heavy&mdash;I had to hire waiters, but it was worth it. All were in a
  good mood, except your mother-in-law, and no one takes any notice of an old
  woman's raving about her pampered son&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But she is right!" moaned Susan, tossing on the disordered pillows. "She
  is accusing me of driving him to it, I suppose, and I did&mdash;with this
  urging for a divorce! I should never have done it! He was so kind to me, when
  he was in that dreadful, dreadful pain, and left me everything, and never,
  never blamed me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A pity that you did not discover his worth sooner," said Mrs. Sacret
  tartly.</p>

  <p>"His mother will not speak to me&mdash;I passed her downstairs and she
  drew away and turned aside her head."</p>

  <p>"Then you should desire her to return to her home&mdash;this is your home
  now, Susan, do grasp that."</p>

  <p>"I loathe this place. I do not want to live here. I am going away with
  Curtis to Brighton."</p>

  <p>"Very well. But Dr. Virtue will not allow you to travel yet&mdash;he is
  coming to see you again this evening. And if you have any spirit at all you
  will ask him to send that horrid old woman about her own affairs. Why, at
  this very moment, she is in your drawing room gossiping with that impertinent
  Dr. Balance she brought with her and Dr. Mallard. I don't know why you called
  on him, Susan; he has a small practice in the back streets here."</p>

  <p>The prostrate woman took no heed of these words that Mrs. Sacret delivered
  while standing in front of the mirror and curling tresses of her hazel hair
  around her fingers, except to murmur&mdash;"Her only son&mdash;Martin was her
  only son." The weakness was abhorrent to Mrs. Sacret who judged Susan's
  emotion to be extremely superficial. She will have forgotten him in a few
  weeks and be married again within the year.</p>

  <p>Aloud she said:</p>

  <p>"You haven't even thanked me for all the care I've taken&mdash;I assure
  you that things wouldn't have gone so well save for my management." Susan sat
  up suddenly and stared from swollen eyes.</p>

  <p>"When are you going? Are you never to leave me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, pray don't upset yourself. I'm going at once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," sighed Susan, shivering, "it is useless to ask you for the
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"So you still think of those! How strange! I declare I had forgotten them,
  they must be in one of my trunks and I must send them. Good-by."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret left the room abruptly, closing the door with soft decorum.
  She was indeed fatigued, and now that the inquest was over and there was
  nothing for her to do&mdash;a distant cousin of Susan's, a Mrs. Findlay, was
  coming from Yorkshire to take charge of the establishment&mdash;her old
  distaste of the home revived and she longed to be away and on the first stage
  of her journey abroad.</p>

  <p>Not until she had reached the hall, with her valise in her hand, intending
  to slip away unobserved, did she recall that she could hardly leave the house
  before the funeral, unless she wished to cause comment.</p>

  <p>That, obviously, was old Mrs. Rue's excuse for remaining in the home of
  the woman she had insulted. Mrs. Sacret heard her talking in the front
  drawing room, her voice raised and mingled with those of men. The widow
  paused to listen by the crack of the door. Yes, Dr. Balance, Dr. Mallard, and
  the precise accents of Hugh Ferguson, who kept the smart bookshop on the
  common and who had been the foreman of the jury.</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret shrugged her elegant shoulders. What a miserable fool Susan
  was to allow this insolence in her own house! And how stupid of that
  malicious old woman to imagine that she could make trouble for anyone now
  that the verdict of <i>felo-de-se</i> had been brought in! Why, couldn't she
  understand that the case was closed! No doubt she was trying to blight her
  daughter-in-law's reputation by declaring that she had driven her husband to
  suicide. Well, even if she were believed, and she could make out quite a good
  case for her theory, and Susan's grief, so like remorse, would support it, it
  was no crime to ask for a divorce, and all the evidence had shown that Martin
  Rue had been a very tiresome, difficult husband with his imaginary illnesses
  and his petty jealousies.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret went once again to her bedroom in the Old Priory, and being
  fatigued, as well as calm in mind and healthy in body, ate a good meal from
  the supper brought up to her on a tray and afterwards went to bed early and
  slept peacefully.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35"></a>§ 35</h2>

  <p class="first">When the funeral procession had started for Norwood Cemetery
  and the blinds had been pulled up in the house that Martin Rue had left for
  the last time, Olivia Sacret, without troubling anyone, set off on foot,
  carrying her small valise, to Minton Street.</p>

  <p>She had not expected to find the painter there, yet it was with a pang of
  disappointment that she entered the mean, empty room.</p>

  <p>He had left, among the dirty litter on the table, a note, cautiously
  worded, informing her that he was "arranging the affair" and had "sent
  everything ahead" and would "wait on her soon after her return."</p>

  <p>That will be any moment now, reflected Mrs. Sacret, glancing around with
  distaste. He must have informed himself of the date of the funeral. Oh, to be
  away!</p>

  <p>The place was stripped of all the painter's paraphernalia and canvases;
  only the trunk on which he had stood the chair to serve as a model's throne
  remained of all his possessions. The widow's own meager furnishings looked
  wretched and she regretted even the ill-chosen comforts of the Old Priory,
  and lifted her handsome mourning fastidiously high as she went down the dirty
  stairs to the basement in search of food. How stupid she had been not to
  bring away some of the luxuries with which Susan's house overflowed!</p>

  <p>She paid for this carelessness by being obliged to eat the bread and
  cheese that was all she found in the larder, but this was forgotten in the
  joy caused by the double knock on the front door that was the painter's
  signal. He seemed in high spirits, was fashionably dressed and took her gaily
  by the shoulders, kissed her brow and complimented her on her bloom.</p>

  <p>"It was a verdict of <i>felo-de-se</i>?" he asked smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Sacret. "All were convinced of that and everything was
  made as easy as possible for the family."</p>

  <p>She described rapidly all that had passed in the Old Priory since she had
  last seen him, and he listened attentively, caressing the hand that he
  lightly held.</p>

  <p>He then told her of what he, on his side, had done, of the dates, altered
  on tickets, of luggage forwarded to Dover, of rooms engaged in a Parisian
  hotel, of letters written to "a man I know" in Como, to inquire about a
  certain villa on the shores of the lake that was likely to be to let. While
  he spoke, Olivia Sacret watched him with even deeper pleasure than she
  listened to him. Suddenly he ceased his light description of the pleasures
  before them to ask:</p>

  <p>"You are sure about the verdict?"</p>

  <p>Thus unexpectedly challenged, Olivia Sacret replied smiling: "Oh, yes,
  there was never any doubt of it, in anyone's mind."</p>

  <p>"Very well, the widow will marry Sir John Curle, she will be extremely
  wealthy&mdash;what luck for her&mdash;she must share some of it with
  you."</p>

  <p>"I have given you a thousand pounds&mdash;the purse of money, the
  emeralds."</p>

  <p>"A token, on account. You must return to the Old Priory, say this
  afternoon, before that foolish woman goes to Brighton, and ask for more.
  Think of her latest fortune&mdash;and how she obtained it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret protested with vehemence. "I don't want to go back
  there&mdash;I want to go away, as you promised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why so you shall, with no delay&mdash;we cannot leave before the boat
  train tomorrow. I mean you should pay a visit this afternoon. I shall return
  tonight and take you out to supper."</p>

  <p>"We have enough&mdash;a thousand pounds&mdash;and more&mdash;the jewels,
  besides Susan will not have the money in the house."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose that she will, not much at least, but she must have other
  valuables. Perhaps you can take them without disturbing her? She would never
  dare to inquire after them. Before she missed them, you could write from
  Paris to say you have them. Come, you don't intend to be content with a mere
  thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. But I thought that we could wait&mdash;perhaps after
  she is married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, too. But why not go abroad well provided for? When you have this
  immensely wealthy friend. What jewels has she?"</p>

  <p>"A large number. She was always pampered. Her father used to make her most
  costly presents&mdash;so did her first husband&mdash;but she didn't wear
  those. You have his emeralds. Then Martin Rue, mean as he was, never
  begrudged her expensive trinkets."</p>

  <p>"Make no more ado about this," he said quietly. "It is a little thing just
  to return to Clapham and fetch a few parting gifts from your friend."</p>

  <p>And a little thing it seemed to Mrs. Sacret as he spoke. After all what
  was the ugly house to her? To the man who had died there she was already as
  indifferent as if she had never met him. Tedious the place was, and the
  servants, now they no longer looked to her for leadership in a crisis,
  sullen; while old Mrs. Rue, who was probably still there, was hostile. But it
  would be easy to deal with the newcomer, Mrs. Findlay, and easier still to
  deal with Susan, and get something more from her with which to please Mark
  Bellis, something more to turn into money to spend ahead on golden
  pleasures.</p>

  <p>"Aren't jewels dangerous?" she asked slyly. "Can't they be traced?"</p>

  <p>He gave her a bright look of admiration.</p>

  <p>"You're clever and smart. You've put this through amazingly well&mdash;but
  you must learn to trust me. I don't do dangerous things&mdash;at least, not
  that kind of dangerous think I know where to dispose of jewels. But the point
  is that Mrs. Rue will never say she has parted with them&mdash;or missed them
  as the case may be."</p>

  <p>"Where is my portrait?" she asked, delighted by his praise.</p>

  <p>"Rolled and packed&mdash;it goes with us."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad. Am I more like that portrait than I used to be?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed you are. I saw you as you are, under all your Puritan
  disguises."</p>

  <p>"Nonconformist," she corrected him, and she thought obliquely, is he an
  educated man? I don't think so, for all his good address and accent. She felt
  bewildered by this undesired reflection. She had really no standard by which
  to judge him, he was so superior to all the other men she had ever met that
  he seemed a being apart. Yet, save for his skill in painting, there was
  nothing he said or did that showed he knew anything but the devices of a
  world she could only guess at, tricks and expedients she hardly understood.
  Was he really ignorant? She did not know, since her own education and
  breeding had been so narrow. She recalled her own father, always her only
  example of gentility, but she could not well remember him. Then there was Sir
  John Curle&mdash;stupid and ordinary, he was quite different from the
  painter. Confused, fatigued, yet excited and stimulated, she pressed his hand
  and promised to return from the Old Priory with something worth his
  acceptance. He bade her good-by and left her, begging her to take some
  repose. Olivia Sacret did not mention her wretched meal, she had no wish for
  food&mdash;he had promised "supper" that evening&mdash;where? She had no
  knowledge of what this might mean&mdash;was there anywhere he could take her,
  in full mourning? She had no other clothes with her; slowly she went
  upstairs, but viewed the narrow bed on which she had so often slept with
  distaste. Even the thought that Mark Bellis had lived here could not give any
  attraction to the dingy home, the miserable furnishings, after the luxurious
  comfort of the Old Priory. She preferred to return to the sitting room and to
  rest in the beehive chair. There with her gaze on the strip of drugget she
  tried to imagine what life ahead would be with the painter, to decide where
  and how they would live. But her imagination was feeble, all she could think
  of was his fascination, all she could feel was a desire to be with him
  always. Their background always fell away behind them&mdash;isolated and
  detached from the whole world, they moved, in her reverie, through
  nothingness. A knock on the front door startled her; she rose, hoping that
  this was not some neighbor or tradesman who would delay her return to the Old
  Priory. On the doorstep stood old Mrs. Rue. Mrs. Sacret was vexed, she saw
  her plans delayed. She asked curtly how her visitor had discovered her
  address.</p>

  <p>The old woman replied that it was well known to everyone at the Old
  Priory.</p>

  <p>"No doubt&mdash;I suppose I have been spied upon."</p>

  <p>"How vulgar!" remarked Mrs. Rue. "No one whose affairs are aboveboard ever
  uses that expression&mdash;'spied upon.'"</p>

  <p>"You had better come in," said Mrs. Sacret, feeling that she had the
  disagreeable situation well in hand, and she led the way into the front
  parlor, leaving the wooden chair for her visitor while she returned to the
  beehive seat.</p>

  <p>"I know exactly why you have come." She began the battle that she intended
  to be brief with something of the sense of exhilaration with which she had
  before tackled this grim opponent who, at least, came directly to the point
  with a stimulating candor.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," remarked Mrs. Rue. She gave a glance of malicious disgust at
  her surroundings. "So this is your home! I don't wonder that you struggled
  hard to remain at my son's house."</p>

  <p>"I stayed there to help Susan&mdash;now, of my own free will I am leaving
  for the Continent. I could go to Brighton with Susan if I wished. Do pray
  tell me what you have come here for? This long way&mdash;and the weather so
  chill and damp!"</p>

  <p>"I took a hackney, did you not hear it</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I was far away in a musing."</p>

  <p>"Very likely."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rue had an immovable air, as if she was forever placed there, heavy,
  yet shrunken together, her permanent cumbrous mourning pressed about her; the
  woman and her draperies, even her widow's bonnet and veil, seemed cut out of
  dingy, black stone. She appeared ill, yet resolute, her expression was bold.
  For all her lead-colored complexion and the lilac tones of exhaustion around
  her lips and eyes, she had a fiery and bitter vitality.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was suddenly resolved to put an end to this stupid
  intrusion.</p>

  <p>"I know, I repeat why you are here&mdash;you intend to accuse me of
  helping to goad your son to suicide by supporting Susan in asking him for a
  divorce."</p>

  <p>"No, I do not." Mrs. Rue spoke with a complacent triumph that caused the
  other woman to respond with cold impatience.</p>

  <p>"Then it is some nonsense about that supposition of yours that I had some
  'hold' over Susan. You hope I have some means of injuring her."</p>

  <p>As she spoke Mrs. Sacret was wondering how far she should divulge the fact
  that she did possess a serious weapon with which to threaten Susan, but she
  quickly decided to say nothing of this at present. Her master must be
  consulted as to how far they could use the letters in this quarter.</p>

  <p>"It is not that either."</p>

  <p>"Do, please, tell me what you have to say. I have an appointment. I may
  have to return to the Old Priory, I believe I left my umbrella there."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't return&mdash;the door would be shut in your face."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Susan would have something to say to that!"</p>

  <p>"Would she? I don't think either she or you realize the position you are
  in&mdash;my son's death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very tragic! But you have yourself to blame, Mrs. Rue, you coddled
  him into such a nervous state that he killed himself sooner than face a
  crisis." r "He did not do anything so wicked and weak."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret shrugged indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you care to disagree with the verdict at the inquest!"</p>

  <p>"It was not a verdict of suicide, but what the lawyers call
  'open'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret was startled. Yes, of course, this was true, she had been
  misled by the conviction of everyone in the house&mdash;the coroner's summing
  up, her own evidence&mdash;into thinking that the jury had brought in
  <i>felo-de-se</i>. She had even repeated this term, strange to her, to
  herself on the stairs at the Old Priory and, in good faith, had told the
  painter, yes, twice, that this had been indeed the verdict.</p>

  <p>"It was the same thing," she said, rallying under the older woman's cruel
  glance.</p>

  <p>"Indeed it was not&mdash;the jury said my son died from antimony
  poisoning, in accordance with the medical evidence, and that there was no
  evidence to show how he took it."</p>

  <p>"It was merely a different manner of saying suicide&mdash;everyone assumed
  suicide."</p>

  <p>"Largely on <i>your</i> evidence. No one save you heard my son confess he
  had taken poison."</p>

  <p>"I told the physicians at once. I was believed. Everyone was
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>"I was not&mdash;I am not&mdash;neither is Dr. Balance nor Dr.
  Mallard."</p>

  <p>"The coroner did not think it worth while to call you."</p>

  <p>"He thought of nothing but putting a glaze over things&mdash;to save
  Susan's feelings."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret moistened her lips.</p>

  <p>"You are trying to torment me with all this."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I wish to make you feel uneasy&mdash;for as long as
  possible."</p>

  <p>"You cannot do it," retorted the younger woman rising. "I am neither timid
  nor foolish."</p>

  <p>"I realize that you are hard, cruel, and of a brazen assurance. But even
  this will be shaken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What can you do?"</p>

  <p>"It is out of my hands. There were no reporters at the inquest, but Dr.
  Balance has drawn up an account of this extremely lax inquiry that will he
  sent to the press. Dr. Mallard is writing an article on the case for the
  <i>Lancet</i>, with it will be published the post-mortem findings. Then Mr.
  Ferguson, the very sensible foreman of the jury, is asking the members to
  meet him to discuss the case&mdash;at my house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A case already decided! This is absurd!"</p>

  <p>"It was an open verdict," insisted Mrs. Rue calmly. "You seem quite
  alarmed&mdash;what is it to you?"</p>

  <p>"You are acting out of malice," replied Mrs. Sacret. "This will merely
  distress Susan&mdash;for no purpose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For a most important purpose&mdash;to discover the truth."</p>

  <p>"You know it."</p>

  <p>"I think I do." Mrs. Rue rose heavily.</p>

  <p>"Suicide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What else?" Mrs. Sacret forced herself to demand.</p>

  <p>"You will learn in time. I tell you the jury were dissatisfied. They
  thought your evidence required cross-examination&mdash;they felt the coroner
  was leading them, almost even persuading them. Mr. Ferguson told me: 'I saw
  they wanted us to bring in suicide&mdash;but I would not be so
  complacent.'"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to do with your meddling," said Mrs. Sacret firmly, "I am
  going abroad."</p>

  <p>"Are you? You might be brought back&mdash;as an important witness, if
  there is another inquest."</p>

  <p>"There can't be&mdash;the case is settled."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure. I am seeing my lawyer about it. I wanted him to be
  present at this inquiry, but the coroner would not permit it. Mr. Ferguson
  thinks the matter might be raised in the House of Commons. I shall try to
  have that done. I shall stop at nothing to come at the truth of my son's
  death."</p>

  <p>"Please go away. I don't think you are quite sane."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rue departed, smiling sourly. It was as if she had left her shadow
  behind. The mean rooms seemed chilled by a dark malevolence.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret decided not to return to the Old Priory, but also not to
  permit a crazy old woman's spite to distress her on the verge of a brilliant
  future. Really no notice should be taken of what the bitter old creature had
  said; she was, of course, furious that Susan had inherited all the Martin
  money and wanted to make everything as difficult as possible for her. But
  what were these unexpected tactics? Surely, old Mrs. Rue's course should have
  been to discredit her daughter-in-law as an unfaithful wife who had driven
  her husband to suicide? But no, she was engaged on preparing some other
  menace. Mrs. Sacret did not care to consider what this might be, she assured
  herself that it would not be worth while, as the old woman's threats were
  quite harmless. Doubtless she had even invented all the talk of the
  discontented jury and the prying doctors.</p>

  <p>But, for all her self-control, Mrs. Sacret was restless. She went out and
  bought herself sponge cakes and a glass of sherry at a confectioner's shop in
  High Street, then returned to her house to throw herself on the bed on which
  the painter had so often slept. This time she did not notice how
  uncomfortable it was and how dingy the room.</p>

  <p>She tried to sleep, in order to be fresh for her journey tomorrow, but she
  was too wide awake and could not even induce drowsiness. For the first time
  since she had left Minton Street for Susan's home she was unable to compose
  herself to her usual untroubled slumbers. When dusk closed in, she rose,
  smoothed out her black dress, and set her long curls under the widow's cap
  with the crape ribbons. After tomorrow she would not wear this horrid
  mourning. It was absurd that she had been forced to return to it&mdash;Martin
  Rue was no relation of hers&mdash;only when everyone in the Old Priory had
  been fitted out with black, it would have been conspicuous if she, the
  widow's companion, had been the one exception.</p>

  <p>When she heard the painter's double knock her heart beat uncommonly fast,
  she dreaded his displeasure when he should learn that she had not brought any
  jewels from Clapham, but she reassured herself by the reflection that surely
  he would understand that&mdash;in view of old Mrs. Rue's visit&mdash;her
  action had been wise. Surely he would feel, as she felt, that neither of them
  wished to be involved more deeply in the affairs of Susan, for the time at
  least, but wanted to get abroad away from it all. They could wait on events
  from the other side of the Channel&mdash;for she would write, very
  discreetly, to Susan and so obtain all her news.</p>

  <p>With a smile of engaging welcome Mrs. Sacret opened to the painter, and,
  as soon as they were in the parlor behind the drawn blind, in the circle of
  light from the common oil lamp, she excused herself for being empty handed
  and told him of her disagreeable visitor. He listened intently, offering no
  comment until she had finished, then he half turned his back on her as if
  staring in the empty fireplace and remarked:</p>

  <p>"You told me that the verdict was <i>felo-de-se</i>."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I have just explained that. I had it in my head, I don't
  know why&mdash;I really forgot."</p>

  <p>"I said that, for a clever woman, you do very stupid things."</p>

  <p>"But what does it matter? Where is the harm?"</p>

  <p>She heard him draw his breath, she saw his shoulders heave, then he turned
  to her calmly and with a casual air began questioning her on what she had
  just told him.</p>

  <p>"Raised in the House of Commons!" she exclaimed. "How absurd, is it
  not!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I think it could be done. If there were sufficient
  grounds." He turned slowly, his eyes glancing along the circle of the lamp
  shadow. "I wish you had been more accurate&mdash;this alters
  everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why?" she demanded sharply. "A stupid old woman&mdash;and two raw
  doctors&mdash;of no importance compared to the other three men&mdash;an
  ignorant tradesman&mdash;and that is allowing that what she said is true,
  which I don't believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not speak more, and she drew nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean that you are angry because I did not return to the Old
  Priory?"</p>

  <p>"I am not angry."</p>

  <p>"You agree that it would have been unwise to have attracted attention to
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"No," he smiled, took her hand and caressed it kindly, and she who had
  dreaded his anger shivered with relief. "I don't&mdash;I think you should
  return to the Old Priory&mdash;and stay with Susan Rue&mdash;she will be your
  best safeguard."</p>

  <p>"What are you saying!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret. "We were leaving England
  tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with an accurate glance, in the warm shadows his eyes had
  a glint of smoky gold.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," he answered slowly. "You know I had forgotten
  that&mdash;none of this has anything to do with us&mdash;even if there is a
  second inquest we shall be far away."</p>

  <p>"How could you have forgotten!" she gasped, not entirely reassured.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he admitted with an air of candor. "Because I'm tired, I
  suppose, excited&mdash;just as you forgot the real verdict&mdash;these have
  been disturbing days."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," she agreed, "there has been much for you to do&mdash;everything
  is arranged?"</p>

  <p>"Everything. I shall come with a hackney for you tomorrow&mdash;about nine
  o'clock. One day's traveling and our real life will begin. Now you must get
  some sleep."</p>

  <p>"You said you would take me out to supper tonight, I have hardly had
  anything to eat all day."</p>

  <p>"I forgot your mourning&mdash;it would be ludicrous in, say, the
  Argyll."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought of that&mdash;I wish I had kept one trunk with me&mdash;I
  have only a few toilet articles in a little valise."</p>

  <p>"There is not much to regret!" he assured her gaily. "This time tomorrow
  we shall be in Paris&mdash;unless you care to spend a short time in
  Calais."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret sighed, contented. She was tired, indeed, and now that she no
  longer dreaded his anger, she felt relaxed, drowsy and was willing that he
  should leave her for a few more hours only. But she was disappointed that he
  left so quickly, smiling, with a light step and hardly any farewells&mdash;a
  whispered "good-by"&mdash;a touch of his lips on her cheek and he was gone.
  Her mood changed, she felt lonely, old Mrs. Rue's shadow seemed to blot the
  dim lamplight. Oh, to be gone, to be away! She wanted air, freedom, the room
  was so small, so wretched, smelled so stale and dusty. After a restless half
  hour she threw on her mantle, tied on her bonnet and hastened out of the
  house. A fine rain was straightly falling. There was no breath of wind, a
  glare of light from above the frosted glass of the windows of the public
  house at the corner was reflected in the wet pavement, beyond was darkness
  save for the dull yellow circles on the pavement from the street lamps. Above
  was a murky sulphurous hued sky, night flushed with the dim glow of the
  city.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had never been in the city after dark save on a direct errand,
  a modest hurrying from the chapel or a neighbor's house, and she felt at once
  at liberty and lost. It was odd for the genteel lady she had become in
  Susan's sheltered house to be alone in these mean side streets after
  nightfall, yet it suited both her mood and something in her nature to be
  unseen and freed from the restraint of having to watch her speech and her
  looks&mdash;as she had to watch them even with Mark Bellis. How relieved she
  would be when she was able to discard all restraint with him, when they had
  left behind all the tiresome, even awkward circumstances that had curbed
  their movements and their emotions! How soon they would forget England when
  safely in France or Italy!</p>

  <p>As Olivia Sacret was thus walking aimlessly and musing in a manner vague
  yet passionate on the future that she saw as nothing but a long companionship
  between herself and Mark Bellis, she was frightened by a most unexpected
  experience. It was the first time in her life when she, bold by nature and
  unsuperstitious, had felt a pang of unreasoning fear.</p>

  <p>She had passed the public house from which came the sounds of coarse
  laughter and tuneless singing, crossed High Street and was walking slowly
  along Heron Walk, a narrow turning opposite Minton Street, when she became
  aware of a woman some way ahead, proceeding at about her own pace. The
  outline of this figure in the shadows seemed confusingly familiar, then, as
  it passed into the circle of light thrown by the lamppost, Mrs. Sacret found
  that she was gazing at herself and the keen thrust of fear touched her
  nerves. She could not move, and, as she stood staring, her double passed
  forward into the shadows, but not before the terror-filled eves of Olivia
  Sacret had noticed every detail of costume, rose-trimmed hat, green
  mantle&mdash;all exactly like those she had worn on her visit to Lyndbridge
  House&mdash;a reproduction of the costume and appointments now packed by
  herself in one of her trunks that must by now be lying in the station at
  Dover. When at school she had heard idle stories of ghostly doubles and taken
  no heed of them, her mind had been occupied by practical matters and she had
  always considered fairy tales a waste of time.</p>

  <p>Hardly knowing what she did she hastened forward. The other figure, as if
  disturbed by the falling rain, also quickened its steps&mdash;the smart,
  fantastic dress that Mrs. Sacret had designed entirely to her own whim was
  indeed unsuitable to this wet night, this empty side street.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Sacret followed she lost sight of what she felt must be a horrid
  phantom, paused, and closed her eyes in an effort to command herself. When
  she opened them she hurried on again as fast as the full heavy skirt she
  gathered up in an ungainly fashion would allow her to move. But she did not
  see the woman she was so strangely pursuing, either the creature&mdash;if
  creature it was&mdash;had turned into a doorway, slipped down a side
  street&mdash;for Mrs. Sacret had reached crossroads&mdash;or it was a
  hallucination. "But I am not nervous," she told herself, standing cold and
  still. "I have not had as much as an evil dream since I was a child&mdash;no,
  absurd, I saw that figure, but the dress, precisely like one I invented for
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her heart beat heavily, she was glad of the raindrops on her face. Pulling
  off her gloves, she touched her wet cheeks.</p>

  <p>What to do? She was quite at a loss, and began to walk aimlessly, suddenly
  aware of the cold, of the damp pavement beneath her thin shoes, of the drip
  of the overflows from the gutters, of the dark houses she passed in what
  increased to a flight.</p>

  <p>She was brought to a standstill by the sight of a policeman with his
  lantern that he turned, in a routine fashion, down each small, mean area.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anyone go past?" she asked nervously and to her own ears
  her voice whistled feebly. "I am looking for a friend," she added, on the
  man's glance of surprise.</p>

  <p>"There's no friend of yours gone by here, madam," he replied indulgently.
  "Not many about on a wet evening."</p>

  <p>"No?" she sighed. "I thought I saw&mdash;was there no one?"</p>

  <p>"Only Kitty Feathers taking home a bottle of stout."</p>

  <p>"Who is Kitty Feathers?"</p>

  <p>"No one you could have mistaken for your friend," the policeman answered
  her with a civil glance at her heavy mourning, as if he put her eccentric
  conduct down to the disorder of grief. "She's not anyone at all, madam, you'd
  know about&mdash;a little Irish girl who sits to painters."</p>

  <p>"No, it was not she I&mdash;saw&mdash;thought I saw." Mrs. Sacret turned
  away, the policeman cast the dim ray of his lantern on her pale, affrighted
  face that he peered at through a veil of rain and asked her if he should
  conduct her to her door.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret declined, stating that she knew her way quite well. She was
  exhausted now and walked slowly, out of breath, peering into every doorway
  she passed.</p>

  <p>When she reached home she took the lamp from the parlor up to her bedroom,
  and lay awake for a long time, without taking her clothes off, flung on the
  miserable bed, considering what she had seen. Her strong common sense at once
  obliged her to dismiss the figure as the effect of an excited imagination and
  refused to allow that it could be anything save reality she had seen.</p>

  <p>In this conflict she recalled the silly stories she had heard so long ago
  of people meeting their doubles. This apparition was supposed to foretell
  early and sudden death, but she was sure that in these cases the figure had
  always advanced toward its victim&mdash;she had, surely, never heard of a
  woman pursuing herself.</p>

  <p>She tried to laugh, the sound of her forced mirth was not pleasant in her
  own ears in the quiet of the room, the house, the street. She rose
  resolutely, undressed, extinguished the fading lamp and shuddered between the
  cold sheets.</p>

  <p>Somewhat comforted that no likeness of herself was traced on the darkness
  of the room, she composed herself by fixing her mind on the day so soon to
  dawn, and at last fell asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36"></a>§ 36</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret woke early and made her few preparations for
  leaving her country, forever, as she half supposed, half hoped. She had only
  her small valise to pack, her frugal breakfast to eat&mdash;still the
  remnants of the painter's food in the dirty kitchen were all that she
  had&mdash;her heavy mourning to adjust. And then to wait. To wait&mdash;that
  was her portion, at first confidently, then hopefully, then in apprehension,
  then with a nervous restlessness touching despair. When the hour Mark Bellis
  had named as that of the departure of the boat train, ten o'clock, marked on
  the small traveling clock that had been one of her extortions from Susan, had
  passed, she could no longer endure her agony of suspense. She did not know
  where to find the painter, she had not concerned herself to ask where he
  stayed when he left Minton Street.</p>

  <p>She hastened out into the colorless day without purpose, looking, in the
  drab street, like a blot of ink on a spread of soiled paper, so dense and
  heavy was the mourning. Then she regained some control of herself, hired the
  first hackney she saw and directed the man to the Pimlico lodgings where the
  painter had lived when he had first written to her. To reach this she had to
  pass the terrace and the square she had visited with him, she recalled the
  stories he had told her of the commonplace houses&mdash;a spy shot by his
  servant, long ago, a miser murdered for his hoard, part of the intricate city
  life of which she knew nothing. She was conscious, now, how she had always
  lived on the surface. Even when she had been giving her evidence at the
  inquest it had been as if she had been acting in a play, interested and
  amused by her fellow comedians but no more concerned with any of them than
  she was by those tales of ancient crimes&mdash;no, one was recent, but
  nothing to her&mdash;with which Mark Bellis had entertained her; there was a
  second square that the hackney lumbered past. Yes, she recalled that also,
  the house with the To LET board, where the old woman had been murdered, her
  body put in a boxa trunk or was it a case? She had to fix her mind on the
  story to keep it off her present wretched situation, which was painted by the
  unwilling recollection of the figure, the double of herself, she had seen
  walking ahead of her in the rainy dark last night.</p>

  <p>The neglected house in a Pimlico side street with the pillared portico and
  the peeling stucco was in the charge of a pallid and shawled woman who
  declared that she had never let rooms to a Mr. Mark Bellis. Painters, yes,
  several of them, she could not describe them, nor "tell one from another,"
  the only points on which she was clear was that she did not know the name and
  that there was no one resembling a dark-haired young man nor a painter, in
  the house at present, and she slammed the door in Olivia Sacret's face, as
  idle dirty children came curiously up the dark basement stairs to stare at
  the persistent stranger arguing on the broken doorstep.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret returned to the hackney, and, at first conquering distaste,
  then, in increasing anguish unaware of it, she went to all the public houses
  in the neighborhood in vain; no one who might have been Mark Bellis had ever
  lodged there, nor was the name known to anyone. She returned to Minton Street
  and knocked up her neighbors. Eager for the hint of scandal, the slatternly
  women assured her that they knew nothing whatever of her tenant's
  whereabouts.</p>

  <p>"I am going abroad, and he has not paid his rent," explained Mrs. Sacret,
  thinking even at that moment that the last statement was true enough. Several
  voices at once reminded her that she had been warned that he was a
  scoundrel.</p>

  <p>"There is some mistake, perhaps he has met with an accident," she
  faltered, aware she was the center of a gathering crowd. "It really is no
  matter."</p>

  <p>She was informed that the painter had been watched taking away on a
  station fly not only his own paraphernalia but the smart new luggage that
  she, Mrs. Sacret, had been observed bringing to her house. "He promised to
  put my trunks on the train for me," said Mrs. Sacret, wishing she had not
  aroused this spiteful curiosity. "He has behaved very kindly to me, you know
  I am a widow and alone. He painted my portrait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not the only one he's been kind to," smiled a stout woman wearing
  a man's moleskin cap, "he used to have a girl in the place."</p>

  <p>"I daresay," interrupted Mrs. Sacret steadily. "He would have sitters,
  perhaps models. Can you tell me the names and addresses of any of them?"</p>

  <p>But, reluctant as they were to let the matter alone, no one could tell her
  more than that, always in the dusk, a young woman had been seen&mdash;and
  that only recently&mdash;going and coming from Mrs. Sacret's house; no one,
  even among these keen-eyed gossips, had been able to see enough of this
  stranger, always veiled or muffled&mdash;and in the partial dark&mdash;to be
  able to identify her, perhaps it had not always been the same young
  woman.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," protested Mrs. Sacret, more to herself than to
  them&mdash;"a seamstress, a laundress. He will send my rent. I must catch a
  train, I must go to the station."</p>

  <p>She told the driver of the hackney to take her to Charing Cross. Her mind
  was becoming overwhelmed by its own anxiety and she hardly noticed where she
  was going nor remembered that she had left her valise in Minton Street.
  "There has been a mistake," she repeated to herself. "He is waiting for me at
  the station."</p>

  <p>When she arrived there, she entered the dark, dirty, glass-roofed shed,
  with the long platforms and rails stretching from under it into the dull blur
  of the misty day, and felt her senses confused at these perspectives
  vanishing with a swiftness like motion out of the shadows of the station into
  the faint light beyond. These grim vistas afflicted her with fright, she ran
  about in the echoing, crowded entrance hall, peering into the faces of the
  men sauntering or hastening about with their rugs and carpetbags, each intent
  on his own business and so giving the effect of a crowd at cross-purposes and
  so increasing her confusion.</p>

  <p>He was not there.</p>

  <p>A porter approached her and asked her if she had any luggage.</p>

  <p>"Not here&mdash;at Dover," she replied, "but I fear I have missed the boat
  train."</p>

  <p>He smiled with the spiteful pleasure of his small specialist's knowledge.
  "Past midday," he jerked his thumb at the clock above the refreshment room.
  "The boat train goes at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;ten o'clock&mdash;I am sure of that."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," grinned the porter. "You'll see it chalked up&mdash;" he
  pointed now to a blackboard that announced that the train for
  Dover&mdash;Calais left Platform No. 3, every day, except Saturday, at eight
  o'clock, "as is well known," added the man contemputously.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret moved away. The station was hideous, dazzling to the sight,
  confounding to the hearing, offensive to the lungs. She felt dismal and
  distracted. Only one thought was clear in her mind. He intentionally deceived
  me. He never meant to take me&mdash;he lied last night, about the time of the
  train. How much else has he lied about?</p>

  <p>She was hungry and moved wearily toward the refreshment room, then
  remembered the waiting cab and made her way slowly to the street.</p>

  <p>The decayed vehicle and old tired horse, the driver wrapped in his rugs,
  waited patiently. Mrs. Sacret hung back from the dark interior, smelling of
  lamp oil and damp leather; it seemed intolerable to turn back; her
  disappointment was so heavy that she almost sobbed as she gave her wretched
  address to the old man on the box gathering up the worn reins. Practical
  anxieties quenched her universal misery as she opened her reticule to pay for
  her fruitless ride.</p>

  <p>She had very little money. She had, indeed, nothing but the clothes she
  wore and her few pieces of broken furniture, the mean little house.
  Everything else that she possessed had been taken by the man she knew as Mark
  Bellis, to whose whereabouts she had no clue.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37"></a>§ 37</h2>

  <p class="first">Alone in her despised room, Olivia Sacret faced her
  situation. She had a few pounds in her reticule, a few pounds in the
  bank&mdash;this was all that was left of what she had earned and extorted
  during her stay at the Old Priory.</p>

  <p>Money, the diamond bracelet, the set of emeralds, even her present from
  Martin Rue she had given to the painter; he had also her fine trunks, full of
  fine clothes, and the letters that constituted her only hold on Susan. She
  forced herself, with the cold courage that had supported her through the
  whole adventure, to consider her position; she had been duped from the first,
  and, in a way, had always been aware of this. She had not really believed
  anything he had told her, he had never given her the slightest proof of his
  good faith. She had wanted to be deceived, for she had supposed that he would
  continue to deceive her for a long while, because of her power to get money
  from Susan. She did not expect that he would so suddenly abandon her, and,
  concentrating desperately on the problem, she was convinced that this
  abandonment had not been his original intention. It would have paid him
  better to have carried out what was, surely, his first plan.</p>

  <p>Only yesterday&mdash;and suddenly&mdash;had he decided on flight. The word
  was shocking. Why had he fled? Leaving no hint as to his whereabouts, without
  sending her a line of explanation? Painfully recalling every incident of the
  past day she remembered that there had been a subtle change in the painter's
  manner after she had told him of old Mrs. Rue's visit. He had seemed at first
  startled and angry, though he had had his back to her and she could not see
  his face; then when he had turned he had spoken of her return to the Old
  Priory and said words to the effect that she would be safer with Susan
  Rue.</p>

  <p>Yes, that was the moment when he had decided on leaving
  London&mdash;perhaps the country&mdash;at once&mdash;without hampering
  himself with an ignorant woman who would be clamoring for Paris or Italy.
  Following this train of bitter thought, she recalled what he had once
  remarked about the extradition treaty, then she stopped herself to
  ask&mdash;what was he afraid of? She saw, in her mind, the sketches on the
  wall of the round chamber at Lyndbridge House, the bottle he had chosen, the
  word on the label. She saw some other things also and again stopped her
  thoughts. She dare not put plainly, even to herself, the case as she saw it.
  Far too implicitly had she, in her infatuation, trusted him. He had seemed so
  sure of himself, his plan for freeing Susan had seemed so skillful, so
  impossible to detect. What had gone wrong? The medical men had been
  unexpectedly sharp, they had discerned immediately the cause of the illness,
  though she, obeying his instructions, had removed everything the patient had
  rejected, keeping all vessels rinsed out. The autopsy had been unexpected,
  also. So had the finding of the jury. For herself she would have supposed the
  situation safe enough, but the painter's flight touched her with a chill,
  unreasoning fear, akin to that sort of horror she had felt last night when
  she had seen the figure that resembled herself walking ahead of her through
  the dark and the rain, a fear that eclipsed her passionate disappointment at
  her abandonment.</p>

  <p>She was shrewd enough to be able to understand clearly her own forlorn
  state. Even if she sold the house at once and for the utmost price, she would
  have only a few hundred pounds in the world. Her chances of finding a post
  were more remote even than before and her dislike of menial work even greater
  than it had been. She realized she must understand that she had been
  plundered of everything she possessed. But there remained Susan, who need
  never know that Mrs. Sacret had lost her letters, Susan who had now no
  husband to urge her companion's dismissal. Susan, weak, dazed, who would be
  an easy prey, Susan who would be Lady Curie and very grateful to the friend
  who had stood by her so faithfully.</p>

  <p>Besides there was the painter's advice, she would be safer with Susan,
  "Safeguard," that was the word he had used. She resolved to return to the Old
  Priory at once, without even pausing for food and rest. The ugly house, so
  recently the scene of violent death, now appeared like a refuge to her; she
  repacked her valise once more. In the midst of this mechanically performed
  task, the weight of her day overcame her with an excess of desolation; she
  dropped the case and its contents, fell on her knees, took her face in her
  hands and for the first time since she was a child, wept the spontaneous
  tears of profound sorrow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38"></a>§ 38</h2>

  <p class="first">The two ladies lived very quietly at Brighton in a small
  house on the Parade that Susan had hired, with Curtis as personal maid, and
  three other servants from Clapham to run the modest establishment. Susan had
  shown no great surprise at Mrs. Sacret's return to the Old Priory; seemed to
  listen with much attention to her smooth excuses "that she really could not
  go abroad and leave her dear friend alone at such a sad time and therefore
  she had postponed her plans."</p>

  <p>The young widow was melancholy and took little interest in anything. "I
  knew you would return," was all the comment she made on the swift
  reappearance of her companion. She even accepted without vexation Mrs.
  Sacret's story of having lost the luggage she had sent in advance to Dover
  and allowed her to replenish her clothes at her expense. She also put money
  into Mrs. Sacret's ready hand, without any talk of a settled wage or settled
  duties. Nor did she mention the letters. She seemed as resigned to her
  position as Mrs. Sacret was to hers, and uttered no word as to the future,
  nor any mention of Sir John Curle. Olivia Sacret was thankful for this lull;
  the removal to Brighton did cut off the old life sharply, and assuage some of
  the passionate grief she was obliged to keep secret. Although stunned by an
  appalling sense of loss she had not given up hope, and, as day after day went
  by and the death of Martin Rue fell farther into the past and there was no
  sign of anyone taking any more interest in it, she nourished the expectation
  that the painter, assured that he was safe, would seek her out. Their
  relationship had always had a dreamlike quality to this woman who had dreamed
  so seldom, and been so full of a rich and varied experience to this woman
  whose experience had been so pinched and commonplace, that she was, if not
  satisfied, at least quieted by the constant dwelling on Mark Bellis and his
  promises that was her main mental occupation. She was not able to resist a
  visit to Lyndbridge House, though this meant a tedious journey to London, and
  a night in the empty house in Minton Street.</p>

  <p>This secret expedition was unavailing. The mansion was closed, the
  servants dismissed, no one was permitted to see the enclosed splendors of
  galleries and gardens; the master, newly bereaved of his bride, was not, at
  least for years, returning to England.</p>

  <p>So the round apartment with the fairy landscapes painted on the walls, the
  long enfilade, the walled rosetree plots, became a hidden treasure to Mrs.
  Sacret, part of the fascination of her lost friend, something that she could
  visit only in her fancy&mdash;Oh, was that the word?</p>

  <p>She stared through her veil and through the gates that the lodge keeper
  would not open, though she had plausibly represented herself as a foreigner
  who wished to see the famous pictures at Lyndbridge House. The avenue of bare
  chestnut trees had a terrifying likeness to the long perspective of railway
  lines vanishing rapidly into nothingness from under the glass-roofed sheds of
  the huge station. She asked t the inn, the Lyndbridge Arms, for news of the
  painter, affecting to be an acquaintance of his who chanced to be visiting
  this village. The excuse was poor, and she learned nothing of the man she
  sought day and night in her memories, save that at Lyndbridge he had been
  known as Robin Campion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39"></a>§ 39</h2>

  <p class="first">The winter was sharp but fine at Brighton, and despite their
  sorrows the two ladies bloomed, Susan into a florid beauty, coquettishly at
  variance with her deep mourning, Mrs. Sacret into a clear precision of line
  and color well set off by the quiet yet fashionable dresses she affected,
  having discarded the crapes that had seemed fitting at the Old Priory. Their
  days were monotonous, since neither had any interests beyond some talking,
  embroidery or the reading of a novel from the circulating library. But this
  routine of good food, easy chairs, easier beds, fresh air, a carriage and
  pair, a maid to attend to their persons, was in itself soothing, and even
  Mrs. Sacret's trouble was held in check.</p>

  <p>One sparkle of hope she had when she threshed over (yet once again) the
  story of the painter, and that was his possession of Susan's letters. Mrs.
  Sacret did not believe that he would allow these to lie forever useless in
  her trunk and when he began to remind Susan of their existence and the price
  he put on them, then Mrs. Sacret would have to come into contact with him
  again, then she would be, once more, of use to him in dealing with their
  common victim.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile she resolved to keep her hand in by herself and began to offer
  hints as to the future to the resigned and feeble Susan, who was reduced by
  the shock of her husband's death to a state, in Mrs. Sacret's contemptuous
  opinion, approaching imbecility.</p>

  <p>"Here is the spring again, Susan, though I declare it will be a long time
  coming in this bleak place, and you really must begin to take an interest in
  life."</p>

  <p>"What interest could I have?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, do be sensible! There is no need to remain here, on show,
  in full mourning&mdash;you could go abroad."</p>

  <p>"I have not the strength&mdash;the desire&mdash;for any
  plans&mdash;besides wherever I went you would, no doubt, accompany me."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you ought to be glad of that. I am the only person who has
  stayed by you."</p>

  <p>"I could have found other friends," replied Susan in a hopeless tone, "but
  what was the use? I knew that I should never get rid of you."</p>

  <p>"Indeed you would," remarked Mrs. Sacret tartly, "soon be rid of
  me&mdash;as you call it&mdash;if my plans had not gone a little awry. I am
  waiting for a message from someone&mdash;then I shall go abroad. Do you
  suppose that I am enjoying myself here, in this dull watering place?" As she
  spoke she easily persuaded herself of the truth of what she said and lively
  images leaped before her mind&mdash;the painter preparing for her in his
  lakeside villa, a summons for her even now in the post.</p>

  <p>"If you want money," said Susan unexpectedly, "I can give it to
  you&mdash;and you could go to&mdash;wherever you wish. I wrote to Mr.
  Atherton, my lawyer, and told him I should need a large sum, and he answered
  there should be no difficulty now. He is selling the Old Priory for me."</p>

  <p>If Mrs. Sacret had had any clue as to where she might find the painter she
  would have accepted this offer and gone abroad to find him. But she dared not
  risk leaving England. Letters were forwarded from Minton Street and Clapham
  to Brighton and surely he would soon send for her to one of those
  addresses.</p>

  <p>"I'll take a few pounds for my expenses," she said gently. "You haven't
  given me much since I came here&mdash;just odd sums. I don't know <i>my</i>
  plans yet, but there is no need for you to defer yours&mdash;have you not
  written to Sir John Curle?"</p>

  <p>Susan shuddered at that name.</p>

  <p>"How can you speak so, Olivia! Never, never mention him again."</p>

  <p>"Has he not written to you?"</p>

  <p>"Once. I destroyed the letter unopened."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose this modesty is a matter of form, and you can't do much
  but live retired until your year of mourning is up&mdash;but surely you had
  better keep in touch with him, he might become tired of waiting."</p>

  <p>"Don't speak of it," implored Susan with a look of terror.</p>

  <p>"How stupid you are!" sneered Mrs. Sacret, forgetting her sweet low tones.
  "Here you are free of a husband you detested&mdash;and very rich and able to
  marry a man you are pining for, who is very rich also, and titled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are vulgar and dull," interrupted Susan, and the other woman stared
  at her in strong amazement. "My husband&mdash;died&mdash;because I was not
  kind to him. His mother was right. I behaved like a wicked woman. I shall
  never recover from the remorse."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that." Mrs. Sacret stooped to put a billet of wood on the
  fire, in order to hide her astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;I think you know I do. I have been most weak, wrong and
  foolish, but I did not detest&mdash;my husband&mdash;<i>you</i> are the only
  person I have ever hated."</p>

  <p>She rose and withdrew from the circle of the lamp and firelight, adding
  quickly: "You have been an evil genius to me ever since you came to the Old
  Priory&mdash;as the evil genius in the old play we used to learn at
  school."</p>

  <p>"How unjust! You were very unhappy when I found you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to what I was afterwards. You frightened me with disgrace because
  of those letters&mdash;I couldn't remember any harm in them&mdash;and then
  you forced me to confess I had been a wicked woman."</p>

  <p>"Bah, you are flighty, hysterical&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was, I am not now."</p>

  <p>"Then don't talk of such things, think of the future."</p>

  <p>"There is not one for me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was uneasy at this firm, somber tone. Have I pushed her too
  far? she wondered as she said aloud pleasantly:</p>

  <p>"You should not live here, so isolated and brooding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not fit company for anyone, save for you."</p>

  <p>"You speak wildly&mdash;do pray consider that you were crazy with love for
  Sir John Curle."</p>

  <p>"Crazy indeed. Do you suppose I could ever look at him again, or he at me?
  My husband's death has separated us forever."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret looked up and eyed her friend apprehensively. Susan did not
  behave with her usual partially incoherent foolishness, she seemed to mean
  what she said, to have come out of the long apathy that had followed her
  husband's death with some strength and purpose. Her beauty that had bloomed
  with the sea air and the care of the anxious Curtis now seemed, to her
  friend's envious glance, but a luster over an inner sickness: she was much
  thinner, her eyes were overlarge, her manner was grave and heavy, she was
  certainly changed from the pliable stupid creature that Mrs. Sacret had
  always contemptuously felt she completely dominated.</p>

  <p>"Don't be alarmed," said Susan, as if she understood this appraising
  glance. "I am still afraid of you. I still could not endure to be disgraced.
  I don't any longer hope you will give up those letters. But I'll pay you,
  year by year, month by month, as you wish, to keep quiet about them. But you
  may as well leave me. You won't get any more out of me by living with me. And
  I shall be very poor company."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret recalled how the painter had told her, during one of their
  last interviews, that she was another woman from the missionary's meek widow
  with the sharp eye for money whom he had met to bargain over her house. Susan
  was altered also, and Mrs. Sacret had not reckoned on that. She had thought
  that her friend would always remain foolish, malleable, headlong in love with
  dull Sir John, she had not foreseen that one strong emotion might kill
  another and that Susan, under the impact of shock, might develop aspects of
  her character hitherto unknown even to herself.</p>

  <p>"Martin suffered horribly, he was kind to me, he never even forgave me, he
  took it that there was nothing to forgive&mdash;he would never listen to
  anything against me, he begged his mother to help me. I can never forget it."
  Susan spoke steadily, as if voicing thoughts that were constantly in her
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Where is your passion for Sir John?" asked Mrs. Sacret scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I do not know." The simple words had much strength. Susan moved quietly
  into the shadows, saying: "He will understand perfectly, of course."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret wondered if she could ever be overwhelmed by any emotion that
  would cause her to lose her passion for Mark Bellis. She could not imagine
  one. Still amazed at Susan's revelation, and even against her own mocking,
  she believed in the sincerity of it, she asked incredulously:</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that you will give up everything? All the future? All
  you might have?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to give up&mdash;it is all over, impossible. And do,
  pray, leave me. There is nothing to gain by staying with me, and I shall pay
  you what you wish."</p>

  <p>Susan went quietly from the room, her mourning one with the shadows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch40"
     id="ch40"></a>§ 40</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret was considerably perturbed by Susan's attitude.
  For several days she tried to alter it by specious arguments, but the younger
  woman was immovable and Mrs. Sacret was forced to admit to herself that the
  obstinate creature had resolved to indulge her stupid remorse, or grief, and
  to have nothing to do with her former lover or her former life. Moreover,
  that she had determined not to have any pretenses in her relationship with
  her tormentor, to drop all pretenses of friendship with her and, though
  willing to buy her silence at a handsome price, she was no longer willing to
  disguise the brutal nature of the ugly transaction.</p>

  <p>The situation galled Mrs. Sacret's pride. Susan did not abuse her, nor
  even express scorn, there was a blank indifference in her attitude to her
  companion that was worse than contempt. Certainly there was the money, almost
  unlimited money, to be had. But greedy as Mrs. Sacret vas, she felt that
  there was not much glitter about this sordid bargain. She would not be, as
  she had hoped, the trusted friend of Lady Curie, sharing her luxurious
  existence as an equal. She must either live a secluded life with a woman who
  made no disguise of her weary hatred or she must go into the world alone.
  Without the painter, how did she know where to go, how to spend her money? In
  everything she had depended on him, apart from him, no key to the golden
  world he had promised her. Desperately she wrote to him at Minton Street and
  the Pimlico lodgings. The last was returned to her through the post office,
  the second she found on the dirty mat in the mean hall when she went up to
  London to inquire for him. Though she humbled herself to ask questions of the
  neighbors, she could hear nothing of him. He had disappeared completely and
  she began to feel a reluctant despair, the dazzling dreams to which she clung
  so tenaciously began to vanish into a harsh and common light. And with her
  fierce disappointment was mingled wonder. Of what was he afraid? Why had he,
  with booty he had considered meager, abandoned an adventure which he had so
  eagerly undertaken? She searched over the house, now in a wretched condition
  from neglect, fouled by mice and black beetles, in the frantic hope of
  finding some trace of him&mdash;there was none.</p>

  <p>Only one possession of his remained, the old wide trunk that had served as
  a model's throne when he had painted her portrait.</p>

  <p>She opened it now, for the first time. It was empty, smelled unpleasantly
  and was smeared with dark brown stains. She supposed he had been using it to
  pack some of his paint materials in, and spilled some varnish. Then she
  supposed that he had, at one time, kept an animal, a pet clog, in it as a
  kennel, for there were coarse gray hairs stuck to the torn linen lining. She
  could not think of him as owning a dog, she disliked animals herself, and
  supposed that he did. She dropped the lid of the trunk and stood unutterably
  alone in the dismal little room.</p>

  <p>When she had returned to Brighton she was forced to consider her future
  plans. Susan offered her five hundred pounds to leave England at once, and
  certainly it was very dull and very disagreeable to pass the lengthening days
  with Susan, silent and hostile, melancholy and withdrawn, Curtis barely civil
  and the other servants impertinent. She cast about in her active mind as to
  how she could use her supposed possession of the letters with old Mrs. Rue
  and Sir John Curle. She soon dismissed any idea of gaining any advantage from
  Martin Rue's mother. Eager as she would be to have proof of her
  daughter-in-law's wickedness in her hands, she would not be fooled, she would
  insist on seeing the letters that Mrs. Sacret no longer possessed. And while
  she was wondering what the baronet would give to suppress Susan's confession,
  she read in the <i>Morning Post</i> that he had gone to Rome for an
  indefinite period, shutting up his town chambers and putting his estate in
  the charge of a steward.</p>

  <p>This was like a blow over the heart to Mrs. Sacret; it proved that Susan
  was seriously determined to remain a widow, that Sir John would make no
  effort to induce her to change her mind, and that she, Olivia Sacret, had
  lost any chance she might have had of extorting some advantage from him. It
  stung her bitterly that he, the opulent, lazy man, to whom travel was
  nothing, should have gone to Italy, the country chosen for her peculiar
  dreams. While she was hesitating as to her future course, and dragging on,
  from hour to hour, in the nervous hope of hearing, at last, from the painter,
  several events befell that distracted her from her confusions.</p>

  <p>A copy of the <i>Lancet</i> was sent to Susan whose horror was so intense
  that she showed it to Mrs. Sacret. The journal contained a medical history of
  the death of Martin Rue written by Dr. Balance, with the analyst's report and
  that of the post-mortem. As there were comments Mrs. Sacret could not see any
  "harm," as she put it, in the article, though the details were, undoubtedly,
  horrid. But the widow of Martin Rue was thrown into an agony of distress at
  this revival of the case, after several months, and in so poignant a
  manner.</p>

  <p>"It is your odious mother-in-law," said Mrs. Sacret. "She has been working
  in the dark. I daresay the jury did meet at the house&mdash;but what does it
  matter?"</p>

  <p>This slightly uneasy question was soon answered.</p>

  <p>While the two ladies were living so quietly at Brighton, someone certainly
  had been making efforts to have the death of Martin Rue more thoroughly
  investigated than had been done at the inquest held at the Old Priory.</p>

  <p>The <i>Morning Post</i> reported that Sergeant Sir Peter Hill had raised
  the question of a further inquiry into "the Clapham Mystery," as the
  newspapers were already terming it, and the home secretary, Lord Milton,
  promised a private sitting by Mr. Plumpton, K.C., solicitor to the Treasury,
  for the purpose of sifting the evidence as to the cause of Martin Rue's
  violent death.</p>

  <p>This startling news, equally distasteful to both the ladies, but for
  different reasons, was followed by a letter from Susan's solicitor, Mr.
  Atherton, informing her that he was aware that neither she nor Mrs. Sacret
  would be called before this august tribunal and advising her that he was
  offering, in her name, a reward of five hundred pounds to anyone bringing
  forward information as to the purchase of antimony by her late husband.</p>

  <p>"He had it in his Indian basket," said Susan faintly. "What does Mr.
  Atherton mean?"</p>

  <p>This question was also soon answered; the lawyer came to Brighton and
  advised both the ladies to send in writing the evidence that they had not
  been called upon to give before Dr. Plumpton.</p>

  <p>Susan, at once, and without any of the vagueness usual to her, wrote down
  an account of MY HUSBAND'S SUICIDE, this contained nothing that she had not
  said before. Though she had not been a witness at the inquest, she had spoken
  without hesitation of the events of that horrible night, and now she had
  nothing to add, nothing to keep back.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret's description of the death of Martin Rue was succinct, but she
  put in one detail she had not given at the inquest, when she stated that when
  she had first rushed to his assistance the dying man had gasped&mdash;"I have
  taken poison for Curle, don't tell Susan."</p>

  <p>Mr. Atherton scrupulously refused to read these statements that were sent
  under seals to the Treasury, both the ladies assuring him that what they had
  written contained nothing in the way of fresh evidence. A fortnight later,
  time that passed quickly for Mrs. Sacret and Susan for they had become uneasy
  friends, drawn together by a vague anxiety and spent their time in discussing
  what this reopening of the case might mean&mdash;what could it
  mean&mdash;they agreed, but that the malice of old Mrs. Rue was resolved to
  expose Susan's plans for divorce as the reason for her husband's suicide. The
  attorney general, Sir Mile Finch, made an application to the court of Queen's
  Bench to have the coroner's inquiry quashed and another inquest on Martin Rue
  held The complaints against the first inquiry were that neither Dr. Balance
  nor old Mrs. Rue had been allowed to give evidence, though both had desired
  to do so, and that both had since sworn on oath that they knew that the dead
  man had had no intention of taking his own life; also that Mrs. Sacret, in
  her statement to the Treasury, had introduced matter that she had withheld at
  the inquest, the dying man's confession of suicide. Mr. Atherton reproached
  Mrs. Sacret for not inform ing him of this addition to her sworn evidence. He
  wished to know why she had not at first made this statement and also why she
  had thought fit to make it now. Olivia Sacret affected the demure, un worldly
  missionary's widow, her spirits burned by the unusual situation in which she
  found herself. She told the lawyer that she had suppressed Sir John Curle's
  name at the inquest out of consideration for Susan and had mentioned it now
  because she was afraid to conceal anything, the case having obtained such
  alarming publicity.</p>

  <p>"Not alarming, madam, my client has nothing to fear," frowned the lawyer.
  "The whole needless fuss and bother is owing to the malice of a meddling old
  woman, jealous of her daughter-in-law and infatuated with her son, even when
  he is dead. She has whipped it all up&mdash;with her doctors, lawyers and
  members of Parliament. It is true," he added in a grumble, "that the affair
  was badly managed, the coronet incompetent and three of the medical men too
  complacent. It would have been better to have called this Dr. Balance then,
  and the elder Mrs. Rue and get it over. And a pity that you, Mrs. Sacret, had
  to alter your evidence. What you have admitted now was probably just the
  final reason for ordering a reopening of the case."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret with a bitterness that
  Mr. Atherton thought was concern for Susan but which was really concern at
  her own clumsiness. How stupid her master would consider her if he ever got
  to know of her blunder! If she had stuck to her first evidence, perhaps
  neither the medical men nor old Mrs. Rue would have been able to have the
  case reopened.</p>

  <p>"I told Dr. Virtue," she sighed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and he says he taxed the dying man with it, who declared positively
  he had never made such a confession, so the doctor did not feel obliged to
  mention this at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rue was crazy with jealousy, for which he had not the least cause,"
  said Mrs. Sacret. "He must have been out of his senses to commit suicide and
  so hardly knew what he said to me."</p>

  <p>"Plausible, and yet all the doctors agree he was perfectly sane. No one
  has been known to poison himself with antimony before."</p>

  <p>"He must have been mad," urged Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"If you thought so, you need not have repeated what he said. There is no
  record in any chemist's shop in London of his purchase of antimony."</p>

  <p>"He had it in that Indian basket."</p>

  <p>"No trace of it, the doctors declare, and all his purchases have been gone
  into&mdash;the only dangerous drugs he had or was known to purchase were
  those he admitted to&mdash;laudanum and chloroform."</p>

  <p>"He must have got it somewhere." Then Mrs. Sacret strengthened this feeble
  comment by a daring venture. "Is not antimony used for horses? Might there
  not have been some in the stables?"</p>

  <p>"Uncommon knowledge for a lady," remarked the lawyer. "A shrewd
  comment."</p>

  <p>"My father kept horses," said Mrs. Sacret, enlarging the overworked
  doctor's nag which drew the worn gig into a country gentleman's stables, and
  adding a quick lie. "He told me antimony was used as a drench for
  them&mdash;he used to warn me from interfering with anything in the
  stables."</p>

  <p>"I cannot touch on any of this now," replied Mr. Atherton. "I advise you
  to engage a barrister to look after your interests. This second inquiry will
  make a deal of noise. It is very rare for the Crown to upset the findings of
  a coroner's court."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it doesn't signify much how he got the poison, everyone knows he took
  it!" smiled Olivia Sacret. "It is merely a scandal for nothing, save to
  gratify old Mrs. Rue's spite. But even if she publishes to the world her
  opinion that her son was driven mad by jealousy of Susan, I shall be able to
  declare that he <i>was</i> unbalanced on this subject and that her affair
  with Sir John Curle was quite innocent."</p>

  <p>"Don't, pray, term it an affair," commanded the lawyer sharply and this
  concern for the fair name of Susan, who had been a married man's secret
  mistress, angered the virtuous Mrs. Sacret who rejoined tartly, "They were
  much talked of, Susan was not at all prudent."</p>

  <p>"You need not remember that, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"I must, if questioned on the subject. Everyone knows, so what will it
  matter? I daresay it will be distressing for Susan, but she will get over it,
  and making one's husband jealous isn't a crime."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that you realize the seriousness of this case, Mrs. Sacret.
  The investigation will be most thorough, some of the most brilliant men in
  the legal profession will be briefed for it, the public interest is
  enormous."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Mrs. Sacret steadily.</p>

  <p>"Allow me," said Mr. Atherton, taking up his hat, "to repeat to you what
  was said by the lord chief justice in reply to the attorney general. This
  report is not, I believe, in the papers yet."</p>

  <p>"I have not seen it&mdash;we live retired here."</p>

  <p>"Lord Moore said&mdash;'In your view it is not a case of
  suicide?'&mdash;and Sir Miles Finch answered, 'Should it prove to be murder,
  as I suspect it is, I hope we shall elicit some facts which would justify a
  charge against someone.' I hope you will allow some importance to those two
  statements."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Sacret, with admirable courage, continued to reply&mdash;"How
  absurd! Who could, or would, have murdered Martin Rue!"</p>

  <p>"That, unfortunately," frowned the lawyer, taking his leave, "is precisely
  what this second inquest intends to find out. Pray impart this news carefully
  to Mrs. Rue. I confess I shrink from doing so myself."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch41"
     id="ch41"></a>§ 41</h2>

  <p class="first">Olivia Sacret was stung by a cold pang equal to that she had
  felt when she had seen her double hurrying before her up the rainy, lamplit
  street She soon reasoned this fear away, but the shadow of it remained with
  her, as the shadow of the fat woman in the crape and black bombazine had
  remained in the little room at Minton Street after her departure. What she
  had threatened then, she was now putting into practice; how long, patiently
  and carefully she must have worked in order to bring about this most
  unexpected result! Olivia Sacret winced before this demonstration of hatred,
  for she did not for a moment credit that old Mrs. Rue's motive was love for
  her lost son. Another reflection was extremely unpleasant to the alert and
  anxious missionary's widow, and that was the wise move the painter had made
  in disappearing so early from these complications and the unlikelihood of his
  return until the second inquest was over.</p>

  <p>But soon after he will come back, if only for more money from Susan, for I
  am sure that this time there will be no doubt about the verdict.</p>

  <p>She found this cheerful thought confirmed by Susan's reaction when she
  broke to her the news that Mr. Atherton had feared would prove so dreadful to
  Martin Rue's widow, for the sad young woman, though shuddering at the
  prospect of having her affairs discussed before a public tribunal, dismissed
  the suggestion of murder as grotesque, and failed to understand the comment
  of the attorney general before the court of Queen's Bench. Her remark was
  that made by Mrs. Sacret to Mr. Atherton.</p>

  <p>"Who could have murdered poor Martin!" and she added sorrowfully, "He had
  no enemies."</p>

  <p>"<i>Of course</i> it was suicide," answered Mrs. Sacret. "And though it
  will be horrid for you, you must admit that he was crazy with jealousy."</p>

  <p>"It was true&mdash;I drove him to it. It will be part of my punishment to
  confess that&mdash;but oh, Olivia, I do wish Sir John's name could have been
  kept out of this!"</p>

  <p>"It cannot. You made yourself so conspicuous."</p>

  <p>"Martin never mentioned him, never reproached me, even when dying in those
  agonies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He mentioned him to me, and I can't commit perjury even for you&mdash;but
  you need not fear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;the letters?" put in Susan sharply. "I know you will spare my
  reputation, for if it is lost, you will not be able to blackmail me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was angry at anyone as stupid as Susan discovering the truth
  and she answered harshly: "What an ugly, vulgar word! But I won't be vexed. I
  am still your best friend. I shall be careful to emphasize that your
  friendship with Sir John Curle was highly respectable, that you have not seen
  him since your second marriage and that Mr. Rue was crazy with jealousy
  inflamed by his horrible mother."</p>

  <p>"You can tell the truth, as you saw it at the Old Priory. I had nothing to
  conceal there."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not so sure&mdash;better not state you were pressing for a
  divorce and being refused and avowing to me that you were deep, headlong deep
  in love with Sir John Curle."</p>

  <p>"No need to bring in that name," agreed Susan faintly. "As for the
  rest&mdash;it will come out&mdash;my mother-in-law will tell all she can
  against me.</p>

  <p>"She will overdo it and show her spite and prejudice herself&mdash;you
  must trust to me to do what I can for you. Mr. Atherton thought I should have
  a lawyer to represent me. And so I should, I suppose. But I have no money.
  You must undertake this expense for me!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, but why do you need a lawyer? No one will have anything to
  charge you with. I shall be exposed as a heartless wife who drove her husband
  to suicide."</p>

  <p>This innocence exasperated Mrs. Sacret. How dense Susan was, despite her
  occasional flashes of shrewdness and insight! In what a dull manner she was
  handling this affair and how stupid, almost imbecile, her life had been since
  her husband's death! Susan seemed to catch something of her companion's
  scorn, for she said hastily, putting back the heavy hair that had fallen over
  her eyes&mdash;"I don't understand any of this lawyers' work, I don't know
  what any of them mean&mdash;my mind, my heart, are fixed on what I
  did&mdash;causing Martin to destroy himself."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret wanted to allow this to pass, but could not resist saying: "Do
  you not understand what the attorney general claimed and the lord chief
  justice allowed, that this was a case of murder?"</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous," said Susan sadly. "Why do they think of that when the horrid
  truth is so clear?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing they were correct?" demanded Mrs. Sacret, goading herself as
  well as Susan.</p>

  <p>Stung into recognizing the possibility of this monstrous thing, Susan
  flashed&mdash;"Then I hope any such wicked, wicked person is caught and
  hanged!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear me, I never saw you so angry! And yet you wanted to be free of
  him! Well, of course it was suicide, as will be proved. You don't know anyone
  who had any grudge against poor Mr. Rue?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, he was the kindest of men!" cried Susan warmly. "He lived
  retired, as you know, because of his health&mdash;and gave no offense to any,
  his business friends speak very highly of him."</p>

  <p>"Some servants, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"What are you saying, Olivia! I think that you must be crazy, also."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't mean the women, I thought perhaps someone in the stables,
  you know how rough they are, and if one were under dismissal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about them, and Martin didn't much&mdash;he hardly
  went into the stables."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he blame anyone for being thrown&mdash;as he was, several
  times?"</p>

  <p>"No, he knew that he was a poor rider. Thompson the head gardener was
  devoted to him, because of the conservatory&mdash;Oh, pray, don't talk of
  these things." Susan paused, then added desperately: "I think I must have a
  glass of wine tonight."</p>

  <p>"Why not</p>

  <p>"You know I have not taken any wine since I came to Brighton."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Sacret indifferently. It was now no matter to her
  whether Susan drank too much wine or not. "I'm sure you're silly to keep
  yourself so low."</p>

  <p>"I have been taking those sleeping pills that Dr. Virtue gave me, and I
  have not found it so difficult to give up the wine. You know why I do
  it&mdash;because he always tried to prevent me. I do it as a tribute to
  him."</p>

  <p>"It is a mawkish kind of sacrifice," sneered Mrs. Sacret. "He was always
  so rude to you about this, insulting you before the servants."</p>

  <p>"I deserved it&mdash;I did drink too much because I was so unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, you can take some to keep your spirits up. Wine was never one of
  my temptations, but I could do with a glass myself now and then, in this
  tedious place."</p>

  <p>"Olivia," asked Susan, "what <i>are</i> your temptations? I have never
  understood you nor what you wanted&mdash;you never seemed to have anything or
  to care for anyone&mdash;you said just now you had no money. What have you
  done with that I gave you&mdash;the jewels?"</p>

  <p>"I am saving for my old age," replied Mrs. Sacret with a horrid grin at
  being thus reminded how she had been plundered. "And as for not caring for
  anyone, what do <i>you</i> know of <i>me</i>?" Repenting this savage
  question, she quickly muttered, "It is true I have had no one to care for
  since Frederick died, you always misjudged me. I merely want to save a little
  toward&mdash;a cottage in the country."</p>

  <p>Susan stared at her, then sank back into her easy chair, crying
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Do try to collect yourself," said Mrs. Sacret, still flushed from anger.
  "Was there no one who might have done Mr. Rue a mischief?"</p>

  <p>"No one. How can you make such shocking suggestions!"</p>

  <p>"The lawyers have something up their sleeves no doubt. They will wonder
  why anyone should take antimony for suicide when laudanum and chloroform were
  at hand, they will suggest antimony was in the stables as a horse
  medicine."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know, but it usually is. Now are you quite sure, Susan,
  that there was not someone among the stable men, who disliked your husband,
  someone who had been dismissed, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was astonished at the change in Susan's face, as if that
  stupid woman had suddenly understood the purport of what her friend was
  trying to convey to her. Rising, alert and startled, the young widow
  exclaimed: "I had forgotten John Blair&mdash;he was dismissed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?" urged Mrs. Sacret eagerly.</p>

  <p>"By Captain Dasent," continued Susan, "for some fault, I have
  forgotten&mdash;he appealed to me, and I found him a place with Sir John
  Curie, at the mews where he keeps his horses in London. Then I took Blair
  back when I married Martin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And they quarreled?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! Blair was very grieved when Martin died."</p>

  <p>"He was not under notice?"</p>

  <p>"No. Martin liked him, he was the only man I knew of in the stables."</p>

  <p>Angered by this folly, Mrs. Sacret tried to keep cool.</p>

  <p>"Why mention this trifle?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;you spoke the word, dismissed. I thought of Blair, of
  course it doesn't signify," said Susan flatly. "I don't know what I was
  thinking of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is this man now?"</p>

  <p>"He asked me for a letter to Sir John, giving him a good character. I did
  so. He may have returned to that service, as you know I am not aware of Sir
  John's movements, or even if he is in England or not."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret did not know what to make of this piece of information that
  she turned over quickly in her keen mind.</p>

  <p>"Why were you so startled when you recalled the existence of this man,
  Susan?"</p>

  <p>"I remembered the happy times&mdash;it was like a blow," murmured Susan.
  "When I was married to Captain Dasent&mdash;and he cared for me and respected
  me&mdash;Blair was turned off because one of the carriage horses was too
  frisky and he was afraid for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you regret <i>that?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to be <i>safe</i>, and <i>respected</i>."</p>

  <p>"But you had not even met the man you love."</p>

  <p>"That was why I was happy," replied Susan simply. "And it is
  over&mdash;loved, not love. No, I have no love any longer in my heart for
  anyone."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret considered a little, then said:</p>

  <p>"You ought to try to shorten this horrid inquiry as much as possible, out
  of respect for the memory of poor Mr. Rue&mdash;and just in case
  anyone&mdash;some servant&mdash;was suspected of a crime, you ought to swear
  you are <i>sure</i> it was suicide."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall do that," declared Susan readily. "I believe so&mdash;to
  declare it will be my first punishment."</p>

  <p>"You ought to begin by writing to Mr. Atherton and saying that this is
  your conviction, and putting in every little thing you can remember that
  makes you so sure."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? Very well. I shall write tonight."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;Susan&mdash;what do you suppose&mdash;he&mdash;took the poison
  <i>in</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I have often thought of that," whispered the young widow. "You
  know&mdash;ah, you would not know&mdash;but he always had a carafe of cold
  water by his bedside and drank a glass of it before going to bed. I think of
  him&mdash;oh, how horrible&mdash;going to his cupboard, taking the poison
  from the Indian basket and putting it in that glass of water."</p>

  <p>"If you had mentioned that habit before, I should have kept the bottle and
  the tumbler&mdash;but everything was moved in the confusion."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I wish I did not think of it so often. Was it that
  evening that you gave me a glass of your special medicine for him?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not that evening."</p>

  <p>"I am so bewildered. Scenes&mdash;pictures&mdash;shift about in my head,
  sometimes upside down. I see you with a glass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Salt and water. I rang for that at once. Now you must not think of these
  sad affairs. Perhaps you would care for a dose of that medicine of mine? It
  is only a mild sedative. It used to benefit poor Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I shall write to Mr. Atherton."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch42"
     id="ch42"></a>§ 42</h2>

  <p class="first">When Mr. Atherton received that letter he summoned Mrs.
  Sacret to London, and in his stately offices at Lincoln's Inn rather sternly
  stated that he addressed himself to her as "the more intelligent of the two
  ladies. Mrs. Rue is as simple as a schoolgirl, for all her two marriages. At
  least so I suppose."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret agreed and listened quietly as this sedate, keen-faced man
  continued, in tones that were not without a note of warning, to impress on
  her the need of Susan and herself "telling the same tale. Obviously you will
  both be telling the exact truth. But it is easy even for two veracious
  accounts to jar on one another, even to confuse or contradict one
  another."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Sacret, who had already decided to concert her evidence
  with Susan's&mdash;"but she is weak and obstinate and may be difficult to
  guide."</p>

  <p>"Then you must frighten her, Mrs. Sacret. The Crown are determined to
  prove murder."</p>

  <p>"Murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As I told you. The inquiry is to investigate how Martin Rue came to take
  the antimony, but nevertheless, the Prosecution is resolved on finding a
  murderer. They have a brilliant team of counsel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is absurd&mdash;the suggestion of murder, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. You must, however, be very clear and positive in your evidence
  as to suicide, Mr. Rue's confession to you, his low spirits, his jealousy of
  his wife&mdash;any threats of self-destruction that he may have made. Mrs.
  Rue must agree with you. Both of you must be unshaken. Remember that the
  Crown will be looking for motive and opportunity."</p>

  <p>"No one had either," smiled Mrs. Sacret, drawing on her gloves. She felt a
  thrill of almost joyous emotion, the sense of power that had come over her
  when she had contended with old Mrs. Rue and her son, defying them, holding
  to her own way, in the same fashion she would defy these lawyers of whom Mr.
  Atherton spoke with such respect, even fear. She saw herself meeting,
  watching all these men, marshaled by the malice of old Mrs. Rue, perfectly
  secure&mdash;for who would know what had been painted on the wall of
  Lyndbridge House?</p>

  <p>She regretted that out of regard for decorum she must appear, if not in
  her original mourning, at least in half mourning, for she would have liked to
  have imagined herself as the dead man had, so oddly, seen her, brilliantly
  colored as the puce and scarlet salvia he had given her in his relief that
  she was leaving his house.</p>

  <p>"Why are you smiling?" asked Mr. Atherton. "This is a serious matter."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Sacret was no longer secretly pleased with her thoughts. She had
  recalled that Martin Rue had foretold disaster if she did not depart from the
  Old Priory and she had also, in thinking over past finery and Lyndbridge,
  remembered her festive dress that she had last seen on the figure of her
  double hurrying through the rain and dark.</p>

  <p>"Now you look alarmed," added the lawyer. "No need for that either. I want
  you to meet your counsel&mdash;Mr. Cyril Southey, Q.C. I have, as her legal
  adviser, briefed Sir Matthew Falkland for Mrs. Martin Rue."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch43"
     id="ch43"></a>§ 43</h2>

  <p class="first">The interview with this famous barrister, whose fee would be
  paid by Susan, was a pleasure to Mrs. Sacret. She liked fooling this
  brilliant man, telling him a smooth tale smoothly, that was so near the truth
  as to deceive completely. The schoolgirl friendship, Susan's kindness in her
  early widowhood, her position as companion to an idle childless woman,
  unhappily married, was plausible to commonplace. Mrs. Sacret had only to omit
  what she knew Susan would never speak of the letters, the money paid over,
  the gift of the jewels, the hostility&mdash;and the story was as true as it
  was creditable.</p>

  <p>Some of Mrs. Sacret's questions were admired by the lawyer who found them
  very pertinent.</p>

  <p>She frankly asked on whom suspicion of a crime would fall. And Mr. Southey
  as frankly told her&mdash;"on the wife, she had the opportunity, and,
  probably, the motive."</p>

  <p>"Where could she get the antimony?"</p>

  <p>"The Crown may have evidence as to that," replied Mr. Southey cautiously.
  "It is not difficult to obtain. Unfortunately it was common knowledge in that
  household that Mrs. Rue was trying to obtain a divorce, that her husband was
  resisting this and extremely jealous."</p>

  <p>"Those could be motives for suicide."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but also for murder. We cannot evade that. The points for the Crown
  are&mdash;the oath Mrs. Rue took, again and again, that he had taken nothing
  dangerous, the lack of evidence as to threats of suicide, the evidence of
  Mrs. George Rue and three of the doctors that the dead man was not likely to
  take his life&mdash;the improbability of anyone
  swallowing&mdash;knowingly&mdash;antimony&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret allowed him to talk, his words vanished into her thoughts for
  he was only saying what was, already, so familiar to her, and talking of
  matters to which she held the key and he did not. Nor did Mr. Southey
  consider that this important witness required much in the way of instruction,
  she seemed to understand her part very well, only, before she left, he warned
  her against self-contradiction. This had been one of the complaints of the
  first inquest&mdash;that might be accounted for by her plea that she had
  wished to avoid a scandal for Susan, but she had provoked that by her mention
  of Sir John Curie and would be expected to tell the whole truth. "A pity,
  Mrs. Sacret, that in your statement to the Treasury you brought in this man
  who was formerly a friend of Mrs. Martin Rue's."</p>

  <p>"I did so to make Mr. Rue's confession convincing&mdash;that is what he
  really said."</p>

  <p>"The name might well have been suppressed from kindness to Sir John and to
  Mrs. Rue."</p>

  <p>"But I know and can swear that their friendship was entirely
  harmless."</p>

  <p>"But the husband may not have thought so."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret caught him up.</p>

  <p>"If Mrs. Rue had been Sir John's mistress, would that make the case
  against her stronger?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer was surprised by the force and indelicacy of this remark; he
  fixed a penetrating and unfriendly eye on this intelligent and cold woman, to
  him extremely unattractive for all her soft hazel eyes and hair and gentle
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly it would," he replied sternly. "There is no case against her,
  as you so rashly surmise, but if her moral character were blasted she would
  lose all sympathy from the jury, the press, the public, and it would provide
  a strong motive for crime. If a woman of Mrs. Rue's breeding and temperament
  can bring herself to break one commandment, she may the more easily bring
  herself to break another. Such a suggestion would ruin the lover also. He
  would at once appear as a possible accomplice. No hint of this unwarranted
  assumption, I pray, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"Indeed no, Susan's reputation is safe with me. I know that this
  friendship was harmless, why, I believe she hardly saw Sir John since her
  second marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hardly? She never saw him at all, or wrote to him&mdash;you as her
  constant companion must know that."</p>

  <p>"Only her constant companion for the last year and a half, Mr. Southey. I
  was in Jamaica when she married. Sir John was frequently in London. I thought
  they met, in an ordinary social way, and wrote."</p>

  <p>"No such thing. The connection was ended, very properly, on Mrs. Dasent's
  second marriage."</p>

  <p>"Sad that Lady Curle did not die sooner, was it not? Though I must say Sir
  John is not romantic looking, though he has the air of a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"You have seen him, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you must not ask me where. He doesn't move in my world, I know,
  so of course you are surprised. Perhaps I met him through Susan. I'll forget
  it."</p>

  <p>"It need not come into your evidence," replied the lawyer coldly. "It will
  not be needful for you to volunteer statements, not germane to your
  testimony&mdash;the inquiry is as to how antimony came into the body of Mr.
  Martin Rue. It is most regrettable there has been no response to the reward
  of five hundred pounds offered for information as to Mr. Rue's purchase of
  this poison."</p>

  <p>"He had it in his Indian basket, of course."</p>

  <p>"I fear that we cannot prove that."</p>

  <p>"I might have seen it."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;don't strain your imagination, Mrs. Sacret. You will only
  prejudice the value of your evidence that will testify to the likelihood of
  suicide."</p>

  <p>In the train returning to Brighton Mrs. Sacret decided not to warn Susan
  of the position in which she stood. It would be useless to endeavor to plan a
  concerted story with her. Susan was too honest, too foolish, too overwhelmed
  by remorse to be able to arrange her tale, she would merely tell the truth,
  however she was prepared. And Mrs. Sacret believed that the young widow's
  simple-mindedness was so innocent, and her conviction of her husband's
  suicide so strong, that she would be unable to grasp the significance of the
  suspicion cast on her. This might even, Mrs. Sacret believed, have the effect
  of unsettling her wits, already painfully agitated by her long brooding in
  seclusion at Brighton. But Mrs. Sacret made one of those mistakes that she
  did not believe herself capable of making. Having refused to break gently the
  horrid news to Susan, this came to her in a pang of horror, through anonymous
  letters that she unwittingly opened, and in the expressionless tones of her
  counsel, Sir Matthew Falkland. He thought it prudent to advise the recluse of
  Brighton that she was being reviled, lampooned, and mocked everywhere idle
  tongues wagged, while the press, with no regard for the case being <i>sub
  judice</i>, contrived to supply their readers with piquant scandals relating
  to "The Clapham Mystery."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was in error again as to her guess about Susan's probable
  behavior under this terrible ordeal. Far from collapsing, the unhappy young
  woman showed courage and that firmness of innocence that, to a trained
  observer, is very different from the callousness of guilt.</p>

  <p>"It is quite incredible," she said and indeed she thought the charge
  so&mdash;"I have never been able to kill a fly and for anyone to think I
  could inflict such agonies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Matthew was confident that the inquiry would vindicate his client, but
  he was puzzled by some of the features of the case and urged Mrs. Rue to say
  all that she in honesty could to emphasize the likelihood of suicide.</p>

  <p>To her companion, in the quiet of her bedroom, Susan Rue spoke without
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I have no fear whatever of this monstrous suspicion, Olivia&mdash;but my
  reputation is in your hands and you know that I value that more than
  life."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret could not sneer at these commonplace words, they were too
  passionately sincere.</p>

  <p>"I have Sir John Curie to think of," continued Susan. "Oh, why did you
  have to mention him!" Then she said, as the lawyer had said&mdash;"He would
  be ruined." Looking at Mrs. Sacret straightly from beautiful eyes swollen by
  weeping, she added&mdash;"Strange that I can trust you, because you are my
  enemy. I daresay you would like to expose me publicly&mdash;but then I should
  not fear you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You speak as if I were a wicked woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, aren't you?" asked Susan simply.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret turned away from the window. There were roses in the garden
  and she disliked seeing them, they reminded her of that last, treasured day
  at Lyndbridge House. How thankful she would be when all these sordid affairs
  were over and the painter, Mark Bellis (Robin Campion), returned to claim
  her, as he would return when all was safe.</p>

  <p>Self-pity touched her as she considered how much inactive waiting, how
  much dull boredom she had put through during this intrigue that so far had
  not brought in much for her. Why, she had not even the diamond bracelet or
  the handsome clothes Susan had given her&mdash;she had lost even the letters,
  and, even though her victim might never discover that, this gave her a sense
  of insecurity.</p>

  <p>"Wicked," she repeated, her gentle voice touched with reproach. "What have
  I done, a poor defenseless woman, but try Co look after myself?" She
  remembered the painter's comments on inequalities of fortune. "<i>You</i>
  always had everything, you really <i>owed</i> me something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've had it," interrupted Susan. "Or some of it&mdash;I suppose you
  will go on taking it all my life, but that won't be long."</p>

  <p>"Oh, weak people always talk like that! You will live to a great old age
  and, of course, you will marry Sir John Curle, and I shall ask nothing but to
  be your friend."</p>

  <p>Susan shook her beautiful head. She had the calm of one who dreads nothing
  because she fears nothing, yet Mrs. Sacret knew that she did fear very keenly
  what she termed "the loss of her reputation."</p>

  <p>"She must be very sure of me, and she is right, it is certainly to my
  interest to defend her&mdash;and I shall be able to do so."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch44"
     id="ch44"></a>§ 44</h2>

  <p class="first">The second inquiry into the manner of the death of Martin
  Rue was held in the Silver Lion, at the corner of Clapham Common, and in
  sight of the Old Priory. The magnificence of the setting was not lost on Mrs.
  Sacret who felt that here was a stage worthy of her abilities.</p>

  <p>The setting was the large assembly room at the back of the house, with a
  raised dais on which the coroner, who had legal assistance, was seated. The
  array of counsel was formidable. The attorney general, Sir Miles Finch,
  appeared in person and he was aided by Mr. Frank Crompton, Q.C., and Mr.
  Philip Crighton, Q.C., Mr. Cyril Southey, Q.C., represented Mrs. Sacret and
  Sir Matthew Falkland, Q.C., the young widow of the man so mysteriously dead.
  Mr. Cecil Lampton, Q.C., watched the case for Mrs. George Rue and Mr. Quentin
  Dance, Q.C., for Sir John Curle.</p>

  <p>And to think that I was once an insignificant person! This thought,
  effacing all others, flashed into the mind of the missionary's widow as she
  looked around the crowded room, filled with eager and excited people, and
  recalled that Mr. Southey had told her that the inquiry was likely to last a
  fortnight and to cost the parties concerned fifteen thousand pounds, while
  the expenses of the Crown would certainly be as high, if not higher.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret remembered when she had to jealously count her sixpences and
  the wretched house in Minton Street, her humiliating search for work and the
  dulling, degrading grind of poverty&mdash;and now she had been able to set in
  motion this remarkable spectacle, this mighty expenditure and to attract the
  attention of the entire nation!</p>

  <p>She felt it a feat to be proud of, and wished the painter could be there,
  somewhere lost in that eager, pushing crowd, to see her masterpiece. She had
  precisely dressed for her part; good living and repose had made her appear
  young and handsome; the expectation of the renewal of her love
  story&mdash;after the very last had been heard of Martin Rue&mdash;gave a
  blue luster to her hazel eyes, a hint of a smile at the corners of her demure
  mouth. Her dress was fashionable, <i>gris de perle</i>, her hair in long
  roller curls, worn with an expensive black hat, for the rest she permitted
  herself to be unveiled, to wear gray gloves and the silver cross given her by
  her late husband. She realized that she made a far more striking figure than
  poor Susan, who was ruffled in costly but badly worn weeds, whose mantle did
  not fit, whose veil was so deeply bordered with crape as to hide her charming
  face, and who looked at least ten years more than her age. Mrs. Sacret
  recalled her as she had been, in her rosy taffetas and jewels, the first
  weeks of her stay at the Old Priory, and felt a thrill of triumph.</p>

  <p>The third widow who had a part in this drama was unchanged, in her
  bombazine, crape, jet and cloth, all a dingy black, she sat heavily, as was
  her habit, her pale, mottled toad's face staring ahead with pale prominent
  eyes, as if she were alone. The sight of her was pleasant to Mrs. Sacret who
  considered her as an enemy who would soon be brought to confusion, and she
  gave an unflinching glance of malice.</p>

  <p>When her turn came to give her evidence, she kept carefully to her
  statement sent to the Treasury, relating yet again the circumstances of the
  death of Martin Rue and her conviction that this was suicide due to unfounded
  jealousy of his wife, fomented&mdash;and here she felt that she dealt a
  master stroke&mdash;by the ill nature of his mother who continually
  interfered between the couple and made mischief. She repeated that when she
  rushed into the room, the dying man had said, "I have taken poison for Curle,
  don't tell Susan," and that after an interval she had told this to Dr.
  Virtue. She had not mentioned it to the other doctors or to anyone else as
  she did not wish to cause talk, and she knew that if Mr. Rue recovered he
  would be angry with her for repeating what he had said in his agony. She had
  given him an emetic, she had not kept any of the matters expelled by the
  patient, it had not occurred to her to do so. She knew that Susan Rue had
  been friendly with Sir John Curle and was sure this was "quite harmless." Mr.
  Rue was very nervous and continually dosing himself. He was not very happy
  with his wife, she had suggested a divorce, and he had threatened suicide.
  This was the gist of Mrs. Sacret's evidence, given with a modest hesitation,
  slowly and reluctantly, as if sorry to dwell on the miseries of this unhappy
  household. She sat, a graceful and demure figure, gazed on by an eager
  audience, with downcast glance and elegantly gloved hands clasped together.
  She made no errors, was not tricked into anything she did not wish to
  say&mdash;this was the impression she made&mdash;and the critical' listeners
  awarded her a rather grudging admiration.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Mrs. Rue gave her evidence quickly, clearly, her veil
  thrown back, her face upturned. She confirmed most of what her companion
  said, but declared that she had never heard her husband threaten suicide. She
  knew nothing of the tragedy beyond what Mrs. Sacret knew. She could not
  explain why she was so heavily asleep so early and so had not heard her
  husband's cries. She knew nothing of any antimony in the house, nor of any
  purchase of it. She had suggested a divorce to her husband and he had been
  unwilling to agree. She had not seen Sir John Curie since her second
  marriage. It had been Lady Curle who had been her friend. She was convinced
  that her husband had taken poison out of jealousy.</p>

  <p>The five doctors gave the medical evidence and repeated the dying man's
  constant assertion that he had taken nothing beyond laudanum. Dr. Virtue
  tried to make something of his patient's lack of surprise when told he was
  poisoned, but Dr. Balance and Dr. Lemoine stated their utter conviction that
  Martin Rue had been telling the truth and was in complete possession of his
  senses.</p>

  <p>They received powerful corroboration from Mrs. George Rue, friends,
  acquaintances, servants. Martin Rue "fussed" over his health and "dosed"
  himself; he suffered from spasms and was not happy, but he had a dread of
  pain, a horror of death and had never mentioned suicide. Those in his
  confidence declared that he was deeply attached to his wife, and always
  hopeful of winning her affection again. His mother declared roundly that she
  was certain that he had been murdered, and, as it was owing to her energy
  that this second inquiry had been held, her remark was given a jealous
  respect.</p>

  <p>John Blair, recently coachman at the Old Priory, swore to the presence of
  antimony on the premises. He used it for the horses, as prescribed in the
  <i>Pocket Farrier</i>, and kept it as a lotion, in a cabinet in the stables.
  It was labeled <i>Poison</i>. When he had left Clapham he had thrown away the
  contents of this bottle, he had not observed if any had been used since he
  had last looked. Medical evidence, recalled, stated that sufficient antimony
  to kill a man could be taken from the usual quantity made up for horses
  without this being noticeable.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret did not know whether to term this evidence ill or good luck.
  An unobserved visit to the stables at the Old Priory would have been so easy
  for her that the elaborately planned visit to Lyndbridge House seemed
  needless, yet that had put her in the mood to take the hint painted on the
  wall of the round chamber, while she would certainly have been shocked had
  plain instructions been given to her in Minton Street. Still this evidence,
  so unexpected to Olivia Sacret, would no doubt satisfy the jury as to where
  the antimony had been procured and as to why there had been no claimant for
  the five-hundred-pound reward the widow had offered for information as to
  where her husband had bought the poison. If he had intended this dreadful way
  of suicide, the means would have been to his hand.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret began to be confused, as day after day of the inquiry passed
  and the bewildered witnesses were subjected to the cross fire of so many
  learned counsel; the ground had shifted from how Mr. Rue had come to take the
  poison, the real motive of this second inquiry, into what person had a motive
  for wishing his death. The testimony against the likelihood of the young
  banker's taking his own life was strong. Despite his nervous ill-health and
  his unhappy marriage, his mother, his medical attendants, his friends,
  acquaintances and servants all deposed that he had never spoken of suicide,
  but indeed had shown an anxious care of his health and that he intended to
  make an indefinite struggle to keep his wife's affections, while there was
  the imposing fact that during a protracted death, Martin Rue had repeatedly
  sworn before many persons that he had taken nothing more dangerous than a
  little laudanum. His mother declared that he had always been of a timid
  disposition, dreaded pain, and had a horror of self-destruction, regarding it
  as a crime. There remained only Mrs. Sacret and the young widow who swore to
  their conviction that Martin Rue had committed suicide, a theory Mrs. Sacret
  supported by the dead man's confession that no one save herself had
  heard.</p>

  <p>By the beginning of the tenth day of the inquiry Sir Matthew Falkland,
  Q.C., acting for Susan Rue, was engaged in eliciting from various witnesses
  the exact position of Mrs. Sacret in the Old Priory. She listened to a
  composite description of herself, mostly from the servants of the Clapham
  establishment, with a quickened interest.</p>

  <p>She had known, but hardly realized, how greatly she had been disliked.
  Curtis said that Mrs. Rue had never needed a companion, that she had received
  Mrs. Sacret, who had been a poor, penniless missionary's widow, out of
  compassion, that Mrs. Sacret had taken cruel advantage of this generosity,
  got Mrs. Rue "under her thumb," been extravagantly paid, lodged and dressed,
  had made mischief between husband and wife and insulted Mrs. George Rue so
  that she would not visit her son's home. It was well known among his servants
  that Mr. Rue was always trying to get rid of this interloper. He declared
  that one way and another she cost about five hundred pounds a year for which
  she gave no return whatsoever. She was trying to persuade Mrs. Rue to
  withdraw her money from her husband's charge and then to leave him&mdash;Mrs.
  Rue had told Curtis as much when she was dressing her hair. The poor lady had
  been painfully distressed, she had been a changed woman since the arrival of
  Mrs. Sacret at the Old Priory, before that she had been reasonably happy.</p>

  <p>How they spied, thought Olivia Sacret, listening bitterly to this recital,
  full of spite and bitterness. And how they lie. Susan was wretched when I
  first went to Clapham, and full of complaints of her husband.</p>

  <p>She had to sit quietly while servant after servant described her as the
  source of all the trouble in the house, a nobody, not really "a lady,"
  greedy, sly and meddling, under a demure "chapel manner" smug and complacent.
  At first she had frequently quoted pious axioms, insisted on prayers and
  grace and been easily "shocked," but under the influence of prosperity she
  had "soon dropped off that"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was startled to hear this. It reminded her how insidiously
  worldly influences had prevailed and how, in a short time, she had forgotten
  her "chapel ways."</p>

  <p>Stupid, I suppose, she thought, stupid. I ought to have kept up
  appearances, I ought to have made friends with the servants, with old Mrs.
  Rue.</p>

  <p>By the end of that day's hearing, Sir Matthew Falkland had established the
  fact that Mrs. Sacret had been dismissed, almost forcibly ejected from the
  Old Priory the very day on which Mr. Rue was taken ill; worst of all, the
  maids waiting at table that evening had heard her make a last plea to remain
  that was sternly refused by Martin Rue.</p>

  <p>"Did he, by that refusal," demanded Mr. Cyril Southey, "provoke a terrible
  climax to the prolonged nuisance of this mischief-maker in his home?"</p>

  <p>He proceeded to draw from the witnesses an account of Mrs. Sacret, the
  first to answer the stricken man's cry for help&mdash;"as if she had been
  waiting for it"&mdash;her reception of the suicide confession that she
  concealed, telling one doctor only&mdash;the family physician&mdash;some
  hours afterwards, and no one else, even when Martin Rue was swearing he had
  no hand in his own death, her assumption of authority in the
  sickroom&mdash;she, a companion under dismissal&mdash;her eagerness to clear
  away all glass vessels, medicines used by the patient&mdash;her remaining
  behind in the house for the special purpose of nursing this man with whom she
  was on the worst of terms, who had his own wife and mother, five doctors and
  a number of devoted servants to look after him.</p>

  <p>Why did the outsider, already expelled from the household by the sick man,
  arrange this hasty inquest with luxurious refreshments for the jury, where
  she was the principal witness, where those against the suicide theory were
  not called&mdash;why, then, did she suppress the name of Sir John Curle,
  mentioned by her in her statement to the Treasury?</p>

  <p>Why was not the anxious wife the first to fly to her husband's side at his
  shout of agony? Because her companion, who had already established such a
  hold on her, had, in defiance of the husband's wishes and orders, kept her
  supplied with wine. The unfortunate lady was easily influenced by alcohol and
  was heavily asleep from sherry administered by Mrs. Sacret, while that
  meddling woman was in complete charge of the establishment from which, at the
  end of his patience, the master had turned her away. And turned her away to
  what?</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had nothing save a house of a very poor kind, some broken
  furniture, the cheap wardrobe with which she had come begging to her rich
  friend, and under one hundred pounds in the bank, while she owed money in
  Jamaica for which she was being dunned. She had tried in vain to obtain work
  with various societies and she had no accomplishments whereby she could hope
  to earn a living. She had everything to lose by the loss of her place in the
  Old Priory.</p>

  <p>And why had she kept this sinecure for so long, received handsome clothes,
  a diamond bracelet, had a carriage at her disposal and an absurdly high
  salary? Everyone hated her&mdash;it was clear that she remained because she
  had Mrs. Rue "under her thumb." And why? There was no proof of any affection
  between the two ladies, rather evidence that Mrs. Sacret had brought distress
  and terror into the Old Priory. Did not everything point to her having used
  some confidence to force a weak, trusting, ignorant woman into granting her
  demands? Mrs. Sacret had sworn that to her certain knowledge Mrs. Rue's
  friendship with Sir John Curle had been entirely innocent, so indeed everyone
  had taken it to be. It was Mrs. Sacret who had introduced this gentleman's
  name into the case. Might it not be that she had threatened Mrs. Rue,
  sensitive and delicate, with the public exposure of some harmless
  indiscretion, likely to vex her husband and his mother? Ladies were known to
  go to great lengths to guard the least smirch on their reputations. If this
  surmise was correct the missionary's widow was a heartless
  blackmailer&mdash;and where look for the author of a crime save in the person
  of a criminal? Such was the essence of the evidence elicited by the clever
  lawyer, but not clear to any but the experienced, so concealed was it in a
  mass of verbiage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch45"
     id="ch45"></a>§ 45</h2>

  <p class="first">This was, however, the story that SIR Matthew had contrived
  to present to the jury and the public and these the questions he had
  insinuated into their minds when Mrs. Sacret returned wearily to the Old
  Priory where she and Susan Rue lived in tacit truce. It gave cause for a
  mutter of ill-natured gossip that these ladies should choose to return to
  this scene of Martin Rue's death but the truth was that Susan was too
  helpless to try to find herself another residence and too remorseful to wish
  to spare herself the sight of the scene of her unhappy married life, while
  Mrs. Sacret cared nothing save for the comfort of the house and the proximity
  to her victim. The obliging cousin had left and the mansion&mdash;most of the
  rooms shut up&mdash;was run by Curtis and two of the maids who had returned
  to their mistress in her trouble; the house had been sold, the menservants
  discharged and the closed stables and neglected gardens added to the gloom of
  the pretentious estate.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you can keep Curtis after all the slanderous things she has said
  of me, Susan," complained Mrs. Sacret, as they sat together in the charming,
  over-furnished room that Susan had once termed her "boudoir."</p>

  <p>"None of the servants was respectful&mdash;they must have listened at
  keyholes and spied&mdash;they even spoke of you taking too much sherry."</p>

  <p>Susan flushed, but answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"They don't intend to say all those things, the lawyers get it out of
  them, besides they were true, servants see and hear everything. I wonder you
  are surprised, but then," added the wealthy woman, without a trace of malice,
  "you have never been used to servants."</p>

  <p>"But you," retorted Mrs. Sacret with gentle spite, "you contrived to keep
  at least one secret from them."</p>

  <p>"You mean the letters? That was largely your prudence&mdash;but you are
  right, a deadly secret one does contrive to keep, even from servants. But Sir
  Matthew was near the truth, Olivia."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder, the way you blabbed everything to Curtis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never told her anything of that&mdash;Sir Matthew merely
  guessed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Susan was behaving with a dignified self-control that was vexing to Mrs.
  Sacret who preferred to deal with someone utterly weak and foolish, pliable
  in her hands. Certainly Susan had shown more strength of character in this
  terrible crisis than Mrs. Sacret would have believed possible a short time
  before.</p>

  <p>"It is part of my punishment, Olivia, to have my private life thus torn to
  pieces in public."</p>

  <p>"If that isn't hypocrisy, it is silliness," said Mrs. Sacret. "Surely you
  are thinking a little of the future?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of saving my reputation. I know I shall have to pay you highly for
  that. Otherwise, I don't think that there is much to live for&mdash;I can't
  see ahead, I don't care about anything really, only I don't want my name
  blasted&mdash;for Sir John's sake and Martin's," she added unexpectedly. "It
  would be cruel if he were shown up now as deceived."</p>

  <p>"How sentimental!" Mrs. Sacret sneered softly. "I wish this tedious
  inquiry were over, thousands of pounds wasted through that old woman's wicked
  spite&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I do think it must seem strange to her. If I did not <i>know</i> that
  it was suicide, I should not believe it myself."</p>

  <p>"How do you <i>know?</i>"</p>

  <p>"You said he confessed it&mdash;because of Sir John."</p>

  <p>"Oh! You dislike me so much you might disbelieve me&mdash;there is no
  one's word save mine."</p>

  <p>"I think you are a wicked woman," replied Susan gravely. "But you were
  brought up on religious principles and I do not credit that you would tell a
  lie and such a horrible lie, on oath."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret smiled uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I am not so bad as you think. I have been a pretty good friend to you,
  and I shall be a better. I shall bring you and Sir John together, despite
  yourself, and you'll be happy and bless me. And all I shall ask is a little
  pension."</p>

  <p>The thought darted through her mind as she spoke&mdash;will <i>he</i> come
  soon? Surely he will when this tiresome inquiry is over and he knows he is
  safe&mdash;to share that pension.</p>

  <p>But Susan replied sternly:</p>

  <p>"You shall have your pension, but I shall never willingly see Sir John
  again."</p>

  <p>With that she left the room for the chamber where the faithful</p>

  <p>Curtis awaited her; Mrs. Sacret would willingly also have gone to bed. She
  was tired and wished these tedious days to pass as quickly as possible, but
  her counsel, Mr. Cyril Southey, called to see her, and late as it was, she
  felt it wise to receive him which she did with her smiling grace, in the big
  front parlor where the chairs were in holland covers, and the ornaments and
  pictures had been removed. One pale lamp illumined the uncertain light of the
  fading summer day. Mrs. Sacret in her rich black dress, with her long smooth
  hazel curls, her serene expression and her low voice was an appealing figure
  as she advanced to greet the lawyer, but he seemed indifferent to her charms
  and asked roundly if she valued "the meaning of the day's evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Why no, ladies don't understand such things," she smiled gently. "So many
  witnesses, so many lawyers, so much cross-examination! Do, pray, sit
  down."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I should have thought that you would have understood."</p>

  <p>"I only understood," replied Mrs. Sacret, feeling she had scored a point
  over this unattractive man who she triumphantly compared with Mark Bellis,
  "that everyone's character was being traduced, mostly by spying
  servants&mdash;for no purpose at all&mdash;for nothing whatever was
  discovered."</p>

  <p>As if he had not heard this Mr. Southey continued abruptly. "Suspicion is
  strong against two people, and two only. Mrs. Rue, because her husband
  refused a divorce and she wished to return to her former lover, you, because
  you were under dismissal from a post so excellent it is suggested you owed it
  to blackmail. Both had motive and opportunity. Either of you could have
  fetched the antimony from the stable."</p>

  <p>The effect of these words on Mrs. Sacret was so swift and so terrible that
  for a shocking second Mr. Southey thought that he saw a dead woman sitting
  before him in the stiff horsehair chair. She felt herself plunged from serene
  security to horrible danger and the pang was almost unendurable. She rallied,
  however, to mutter&mdash;"Impossible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Strange you did not see what Sir Matthew was doing&mdash;you clever
  women! For I supposed you clever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She tried feebly to turn her own fear to account.</p>

  <p>"How could I suppose&mdash;an accusation of&mdash;murder."</p>

  <p>"It is one of you&mdash;or both in a plot&mdash;Sir Matthew was trying to
  lead away from his client, Mrs. Martin Rue, and I must try to lead him back
  again."</p>

  <p>"To Susan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Southey, we are both innocent."</p>

  <p>"I hope so. We must try for suicide. But you understand I must cast
  suspicion on Mrs. Rue in order to save you."</p>

  <p>A faint color came into Mrs. Sacret's faded cheek, in a prospect that had
  been utterly blasted she saw a sparkle of hope.</p>

  <p>"Of course Susan is innocent," she mumbled. "I don't want you to rake up
  evidence against her."</p>

  <p>"You began to do that yourself when you mentioned Sir John Curie's name.
  Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"I was on oath to tell the truth."</p>

  <p>"Truth you suppressed at the first inquest, out of womanly kindness, no
  doubt. Is there anything else you have kept back you might&mdash;when it was
  a question of your life&mdash;divulge?"</p>

  <p>"My life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew Falkland's view is not shared by the attorney
  general&mdash;nor by Mr. Lampton watching the case for Mrs. George Rue. The
  Treasury is resolved to find the murderer but they think rather of the widow,
  perhaps with you as accomplice&mdash;but Sir Matthew is dangerous."</p>

  <p>"There is no evidence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is a good deal. I assume your innocence, of course. I don't presume
  the guilt of Mrs. Rue, but can you, if I put you in the witness box again,
  say anything to divert suspicion from yourself? You have been in Mrs. Rue's
  confidence, you knew she was desperate for a divorce&mdash;did she never
  speak of eloping?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but she would not forfeit her good name."</p>

  <p>"Ah, an excellent point. A desperate woman. She was much in love with Sir
  John Curie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And detested her husband?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He humiliated her by mentioning her drinking habits before the
  servants?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did she show anger?"</p>

  <p>"She said again and again&mdash;I'll be avenged.'"</p>

  <p>"Did she ever visit the stables?"</p>

  <p>"Often&mdash;I don't know why, she didn't ride."</p>

  <p>"She was friendly with Blair, who had been with Sir John Curle?"</p>

  <p>"Very friendly&mdash;her husband resented this."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. We have proof that Blair bought antimony on Sir John's
  account."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;then!" Mrs. Sacret clapped her hand to her heart and was
  silent.</p>

  <p>"He will say it was routine&mdash;he didn't change the chemist when he
  changed masters. He paid cash and it was charged to Sir John as he had a
  permit for poison. But it will be impressive. We have proof also that the day
  before her husband's death a large sum of money and some jewels were brought
  to her by special messenger. She had arranged for this herself, secretly. It
  is possible this money, arranged for without her husband's knowledge, was to
  enable her to go abroad immediately after his death&mdash;if this had passed
  unchallenged."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," murmured Mrs. Sacret faintly.</p>

  <p>"You visited Sir John in his chambers&mdash;that looks as if you were the
  go-between, you must explain that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can, I can&mdash;I went to implore Sir John to leave Susan in peace, I
  wanted to reconcile her to her husband and after the death of Lady Curie, Sir
  John was writing violent love letters to Susan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do very well."</p>

  <p>"I did not want to say it, because of the scandal."</p>

  <p>"But now perhaps you must, we shall see."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;how was it known I visited Sir John?"</p>

  <p>"Such things are easily found out, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>She was silent in shuddering fear lest that other visit&mdash;to
  Lyndbridge House&mdash;bad also been discovered. A desperate cunning held her
  silent. She kept her hands very still for she longed to pull frantically at
  the fringes on her black skirt.</p>

  <p>"One doesn't get up a case on air," observed Mr. Southey. "It's useful
  that you, as missionary's wife and widow, have led what is termed a blameless
  life. Your going to the Old Priory can be explained&mdash;not so easily the
  luxuries you obtained from your employer."</p>

  <p>"My friend&mdash;my dearest, earliest friend."</p>

  <p>"I shall not fail to emphasize that, nor the comfort that Mrs. Rue, so
  unhappily married, found in your support&mdash;but we must not dwell too much
  on that or a confederacy will be suspected. You must be prepared, Mrs.
  Sacret, to be questioned about your lodger&mdash;or tenant."</p>

  <p>She did lift her hand's now, and felt them like lead weights on her arms,
  and dropped them again.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing there," she whispered stiffly. "I let the house to a
  painter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the police have traced him to Liverpool, from where he sailed to
  Australia a few weeks ago&mdash;a good-for-nothing scamp. Mark Bellis, also
  Robert Campion, also John Andrews, also Gilbert Duchamps. A clever
  painter&mdash;why, you look ill, Mrs. Sacret!"</p>

  <p>She gave a ghastly smile.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! But I am shocked&mdash;I thought him a most respectable man."</p>

  <p>"I daresay he told you fairy stories. The police don't know everything
  about him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;who he is</p>

  <p>"With so many aliases&mdash;no. He came from Australia as a boy, they
  think. Probably some foundling or low fellow, with a clever brain and a
  criminal tendency, though there doesn't seem anything against him save petty
  frauds on women..I hope you got your rent."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I thought him hard working. I commissioned a portrait. I suppose you
  have been told I used to go and see him." Conscious that she was defending
  herself against a charge that had not been made she checked and added dully:
  "This man has nothing to do with the case."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the lawyer, "but he might be brought in to damage your
  character. However there seems no evidence that he did more than deceive
  you."</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;deceive me? You mean about his name?"</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;and I suppose you didn't know he had rooms on the Embankment
  where he lived with&mdash;various unfortunates such as you must have come
  across in your chapel work."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;this scamp completely took you in. He rented your house
  evidently for a decent address and a room for painting, he did not reside
  there."</p>

  <p>"But these&mdash;unfortunates, Mr. Southey?"</p>

  <p>"Wretched women of no consequence. The last was a certain Jenny or Dolly
  Feathers&mdash;he spent a good deal of money on her, but deserted her
  suddenly and the police are satisfied she knows nothing about him."</p>

  <p>"How disgusting," said Mrs. Sacret mechanically. "But I also know nothing
  about this man. He told me he was going abroad&mdash;he had finished some
  commission in the country&mdash;I thought no more of it."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. As a widow&mdash;and one with some experience of the world
  through your missionary work&mdash;you would not be likely to be attracted by
  this rascal."</p>

  <p>"How simple it sounds, quite a usual tale for the police, I
  suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite, there is no mystery about these scoundrels, my dear Mrs. Sacret,
  they would not find any victims did not these prefer not to ask questions.
  Foolish, inexperienced women who, romantic or sentimental, are easily gulled
  are the only prey men like this painter can hope for. No doubt he tried no
  trick on you because he saw you were shrewd. He is of no importance as long
  as you are prepared to be cross-questioned about him." The lawyer paused. To
  Mrs. Sacret's maddened glance, he resembled, in a horrible fashion, the dead
  man, sandy red hair and whiskers, greenish eyes with straw-colored lashes.
  Rising, at last&mdash;the interview had seemed an eternity to Mrs.
  Sacret&mdash;he asked casually: "What did you do with the diamond bracelet
  Susan Rue gave you?"</p>

  <p>"It was a gift for charity&mdash;to be sold for missionary work in
  Jamaica."</p>

  <p>"You could prove that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. Oh, I don't know! It was given privately to help a
  mission where my husband had been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the money&mdash;presents you received from Mrs. Rue?"</p>

  <p>"Must I account for them? They have been greatly exaggerated. I was her
  almoner for various charities."</p>

  <p>"I see." Mr. Southey looked down at his fingers. "Did you leave any
  property at Minton Street, besides the furniture&mdash;and clothes for
  instance?"</p>

  <p>"I may have done so."</p>

  <p>"Because the woman Feathers has shown the police a handsome dress given
  her by the man Andrews&mdash;that is probably his real name&mdash;that Curtis
  has identified as one of yours."</p>

  <p>"Then he stole it. While he was away in the country I took a trunkful of
  things to Minton Street and left them in the upper room that I knew he never
  used. He gave permission&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You had a key?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you looked to see if the trunk is still there?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I have been too entirely absorbed in poor Susan's affairs; as
  you know, we went at once to Brighton."</p>

  <p>"I understand, that will do. Pray be careful to remember all we have
  discussed."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said again as she rose and held onto the back of her chair,
  then she added: "Susan is paying you, is she not?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Southey frowned.</p>

  <p>"I believe that Mrs. Rue is responsible for your legal expenses."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret broke into a shocking burst of laughter, then was suddenly
  silent and left the room, leaving the lawyer to find his own way out of the
  Old Priory.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch46"
     id="ch46"></a>§ 46</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret's mind was now actively in charge of her
  emotions, even of her most passionate emotion of fear; she was thinking
  clearly and cleverly of how to escape from the terrible position in which she
  so suddenly had found herself. She had not time even for contempt of her own
  past, even for hatred of Mark Bellis. That was a sordid episode. She had been
  fooled and robbed by a cheap adventurer, a mean criminal, and without the
  excuse of passion or love. He had merely fascinated her, played on her
  craving for comfort and luxury, flattered her, given her glimpses of a fairy
  tale life&mdash;bewitched her, yes that was the word, and all the time he had
  been living with one of those miserable creatures she had been taught to
  consider "fallen women." She recalled the gossip of the neighbors about girls
  going to Minton Street and the fool she had made of herself in thinking she
  had seen her double, when it had been this slut Feathers, wearing her stolen
  clothes, taken from the luggage she had entrusted to him.</p>

  <p>But she must not think of that, but of her present jeopardy. It filled her
  with terror to realize what a stupid ignorant woman she was, when she had
  felt so sure of herself, had so complacently enjoyed her power over others.
  She had truly lived in a fool's paradise. Yes, a fool, and now she would have
  to use all her wits if she were not to meet the usual fate of folly.</p>

  <p>Physical sickness assailed her, she battled with a terrible fear of
  violent illness that would render her incapable of defending herself. There
  was no one to protect her, save Mr. Southey, paid by Susan whom he was trying
  to ruin and destroy.</p>

  <p>The painter was in Australia now, lost under another name, spending her
  money with another woman. She must not dare to think of him, she did not
  regret him and his golden promises, she was too terrified, too absorbed in
  her own danger.</p>

  <p>Reviewing this she saw that Susan was in even deeper peril. Everything
  pointed to Susan. Mr. Southey had said as much, and she had tried to help
  him&mdash;with lies. Could one save oneself with lies?</p>

  <p>She went desperately over the case. The connection of Blair, the groom,
  with the poison and Sir John was fortunate after all. Lucky, too, that the
  large sum of ready money had been guessed to be for an elopement, Susan would
  never tell the truth there. She began to be grateful for Mr. Southey's
  discreet promptings&mdash;the affair of the painter, the bracelet, her
  influence over Susan. She knew now how to pass this all off very well.</p>

  <p>No one&mdash;not even Curtis had mentioned the Indian drops she had given
  Martin Rue, for no one had attached any importance to one more draught among
  the many closings indulged in by the master of the Old Priory. If anyone did
  say anything, she was safe, she had carefully kept a little of the harmless
  medicine and she had the harmless recipe.</p>

  <p>Susan had forgotten that last glass she had given her husband on the last
  night of his life, Susan had been bemused with wine, no danger there, Susan
  would never remember.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret, fully clothed, lay on her bed in the dark, shaken by long
  shudders. Should she warn Susan? Make an ally of her? Concoct with her a tale
  pointing to suicide? No, Susan was stupid, moral, willing to sacrifice
  herself&mdash;anything but her reputation&mdash;from remorse. Better leave
  her alone. She was drinking again, too, and her cool hard demeanor was often
  broken by fits of hysterical tears, she was not to be trusted! Consider how
  she had prattled to Curtis&mdash;yes, better be discreet with Susan. She
  could be relied on only to be quiet about the letters.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret remembered that the letters had been stolen from
  her&mdash;Well, they will be no use to him in Australia&mdash;then she
  shivered with rage as she considered how useless they were to her, also.
  Still Susan need never know that she had no longer got them&mdash;but the
  information that was in them?</p>

  <p>Supposing that were given in open court, would it not almost decide the
  case against Susan?</p>

  <p>But I won't give her away if I can help it&mdash;my hold on her is my only
  means of a living.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch47"
     id="ch47"></a>§ 47</h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Matthew Falkland's efforts to direct suspicion onto the
  companion paled before the efforts of the attorney general, Mr. Southey, and
  Mr. Lampton, representing Mrs. George Rue, to put suspicion on the wife; with
  or without her companion as her accomplice. Susan, in her florid, rather
  childish beauty and her modest mourning, her obvious grief and sincerity,
  made a good personal impression. But her story was not such as was calculated
  to win her the sympathy of the jury or the public. She was rich, idle,
  pampered, she had had two husbands and been "talked of" with a married man.
  She was childless, useless, silly, she was a secret drinker, she had been
  under the influence of wine when her husband was dying.</p>

  <p>Her excuses were poor, though given with dignity. She refused to say why
  she had suddenly raised a large sum of money and taken her emeralds out of
  the bank or what she had done with them, she had been a good mistress and
  Curtis was devoted to her, but none of her servants could disguise the
  wretchedness of her married life. It was clear that she had accepted Martin
  Rue merely to save herself from the scandal she had created with Sir John
  Curle, then, when her former lover was free, she had pressed for a
  divorce.</p>

  <p>Her mother-in-law, speaking in a cold, almost casual fashion, gave her the
  worst of characters, and Mrs. George Rue was the sort of stern, well-placed,
  immaculate woman whose word carried weight with the majority. Then Sir John
  Curle, at his desire, carne into the witness box and Mrs. Sacret, sitting
  cold and terrified in the body of the court; learned that others besides
  herself could lie&mdash;and on oath.</p>

  <p>Sir John, with a convincing air of quiet dignity, said that he had been
  honored by the friendship of Mrs. Susan Dasent, as she had been, and had
  advised her, a young widow, about her investments. She had been most kind to
  Lady Curle, who had taken a great liking to her and whom she used often to
  visit. There had been a small amount of spiteful gossip&mdash;simply because
  Mrs. Dasent was young, beautiful and vivacious. She had done nothing
  indiscreet. But because of this they had parted on her second marriage and
  not seen one another since. Mrs. Rue had written to him once only, a formal
  condolence on the death of his wife. Questioned as to the visit of Mrs.
  Sacret to his chambers, Sir John said she had come on behalf of some of the
  charities with which he was connected; he had been considerably surprised
  when he heard she was Mrs. Rue's companion. He had not known of her existence
  or seen or heard from her since. Questioned as to the man Blair and the
  purchase of poison, he said he knew nothing about the latter. Blair was a
  good servant and he had taken him back after Mr. Rue's death; it was likely
  that a groom wishing to purchase horse medicine would use the convenience of
  a former master's permit&mdash;his, Sir John's, name was known at the
  chemist's, who would readily give the poison and enter it in his book, when
  they might not have known the name of Rue.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Dance, representing Sir John, put in that this matter of Blair
  was entirely irrelevant, anyone could have found tartar emetic in any stable,
  the issue was being unfairly raised to connect the name of Sir John with the
  poison that had killed Martin Rue. The baronet descended from the witness box
  unshaken in his bearing and having made a favorable impression of a quiet,
  honest gentleman telling the truth and having come forward of his own accord
  to save a woman's name.</p>

  <p>His unromantic appearance and manner helped belief in his statements. He
  did not look or sound the manner of man who would be, under any conditions,
  the ardent lover of a woman as young, beautiful and rich as Susan Rue.</p>

  <p>The results of the trial were beginning to move in favor of the unhappy
  widow when her dignified calm was broken by an outburst in court that won her
  popular favor.</p>

  <p>Goaded by the merciless cross-examination of Cecil Lampton, counsel for
  her worst enemy, Mrs. George Rue, as to her relations with Sir John Curle,
  she suddenly ceased her quiet measured replies and made a frantic appeal to
  the coroner for protection.</p>

  <p>"I have not been a faithless wife," she declared passionately. "My husband
  and I would not agree on many subjects and I asked him to release
  me&mdash;there was no happiness for either of us, none&mdash;but that is not
  a crime&mdash;divorce is not a crime, it is allowed. It is true I had a dear
  friend in Sir John Curle, but I never approached him after my second
  marriage, never once. I am sure, from the evidence of Mrs. Sacret, that my
  husband poisoned himself with some of that stuff he got from the stables and
  I am bitterly remorseful, for I believe our quarrels led to this and so I
  have borne patiently this turning over of my private life in public. But what
  has all this raking over of a woman's affairs amounted to? My mother-in-law
  dislikes me for taking her only son from her&mdash;would to God I had not
  done so!&mdash;but can she find any crime to fasten on me? No. The worst you
  have forced out of my servants is that I drank too much sherry. It is true.
  Desperate people do take the easy way to forgetfulness, and I don't deny it,
  or even promise reform&mdash;considering what my life is likely to be after
  this, I'll have little to keep me from drink. But I do entreat, sir, you will
  keep these gentlemen from torturing me into a confession that I was an
  unfaithful wife, thus making Sir John the thief of another's peace, and my
  husband a deceived wretch&mdash;it is not fair to either of these men, and
  what is the object? To prove that I murdered my husband. I am on oath, I have
  sworn before God&mdash;before God I am innocent."</p>

  <p>Susan delivered this speech more rapidly than the eager newspaper
  reporters could take it down, nor was she interrupted. The spectacle of this
  beautiful, rich young woman confessing she had been driven to drink through
  the misery of her married life, and her reference to her empty, blighted
  future, turned even the cynics in her favor; she spoke so sincerely, so
  modestly, with such anguish that there was none there who believed her either
  an adulteress or a murderess, the two most atrocious titles that a woman
  could be given. Then her youth, for despite her distress, her appearance was
  that of a girl, aroused compassion in all the men, and tolerance even among
  the women, less likely to be confused by feminine charm.</p>

  <p>People asked themselves what sort of existence this wealthy, generous,
  lovely creature must have led with such a man as the evidence had revealed
  Martin Rue to have been, jealous, peevish, fault finding, dull, keeping his
  wife confined to the house or solitary drives, while he indulged in lonely
  hobbies, his greenhouse and his medicine chest. Besides there was his mother,
  respectable doubtless, her testimony carrying great weight&mdash;but she
  might have made things very hard for the bright, gay creature she
  disliked.</p>

  <p>The coroner spoke to Mr. Southey, the attorney general and Mr. Lampton,
  after consultation with the legal assessor who sat with him, and advised them
  that the court was sitting not to inquire into the morals of Mrs. Martin Rue,
  but how the antimony got into her husband's body. Sir Matthew Falkland shot a
  glance of congratulation at Susan who did not even notice it, and, at the
  first opportunity, recalled John Blair. Further cross-examined the groom
  declared that never in his knowledge had Mrs. Martin Rue gone to the stables,
  she had no interest in the horses, she was kind to him, Blair, and to the
  other menservants, continually sending them and their wives gifts and money.
  Mr. Rue was a mean, censorious master; it was because he would not pay for
  the horse medicine nor open an account with a chemist, that Blair bought it
  from the shop he had formerly dealt with, Sir John Curle's, paying for it out
  of his own wages. Mrs. Rue's presents made that equal.</p>

  <p>No, Mrs. Rue had not been aware of this purchase nor of anything to do
  with the stables. Yes, Mr. Rue did visit them, and on the day before his
  death, to complain about the mounts given him to ride, he was very unpleasant
  and complained of the cost of the stables; he was thrown because he was a bad
  rider, "one of those gentlemen who can't learn." He kept the stables because
  of his wife, before he married he used a hired cab and his mother a hired
  carriage. He did go alone into the empty stall where the medicine cupboard,
  harness and some gardening tools were; he went to complain, as Blair knew, so
  he slipped away and left him there, he might have been alone there five
  minutes&mdash;"poking about," when he carne out he grumbled at "the state the
  place was in."</p>

  <p>Blair had never connected his master's death with the bottle of medicine
  in the stables. He had seen the bottle when he tidied the stables after Mr.
  Rue's complaint and had never thought of it again until he had found it when
  clearing up to leave and had thrown it away with other litter. He had used a
  good deal of it, no he could not tell if it had been tampered with. Sir
  Matthew Falkland had now established a picture of a generous mistress who
  never "interfered," of a man alone in the stables with a bottle labeled
  POISON staring at him, a man ignorant of farriery. Might he not, in his
  wretched state, have snatched at it, not knowing it was antimony and
  swallowed it in despair? By this time Sir Matthew seemed to have dropped his
  suspicion of Mrs. Sacret, but the attorney general asked Blair if the
  companion had ever been seen in the stables, and though the man said
  "no"&mdash;it was proved from his evidence that the stables were often empty
  and "anyone could have gone there."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch48"
     id="ch48"></a>§ 48</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret asked to see Mr. Southey in one of the private
  rooms of the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Everything is going in her favor. I thought that outburst so silly and
  ill bred!"</p>

  <p>"Genuine feeling often sounds both to the cold heart, Mrs. Sacret, but she
  moved the court. I think she is innocent."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret found this statement impossible to endure. Not only had she
  been forced to sit in court and hear Sir John Curle, with his effective air
  of an honorable gentleman, lying on oath, but had been forced to listen to
  Susan ranting for "protection" as if she were a good woman, then to the
  groom's evidence being twisted around so that Susan's character was
  cleared&mdash;and now her own lawyer, the man paid to defend her, was
  declaring the case was going in Susan's favor, and that he. Mrs. Sacret's
  man, believed her "innocent."</p>

  <p>Merely because Susan had a pretty face, baby ways and money to throw about
  she always escaped even censure. Why, it looked as if she would leave this
  court almost in a blaze of glory.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret's hazel eyes shone dangerously beneath her lowered lids as she
  asked demurely: "Didn't you say, the less danger for her, the more for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did, but the case has changed&mdash;you are not being brought in
  so much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should hope not!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret indignantly. "But you said I
  was, and gave me a horrid fright, made me quite ill&mdash;I'm relieved you
  think it absurd. What reason had I, a poor widow keeping Mrs. Rue company, to
  do with the making away of Mr. Rue&mdash;compared to <i>her</i> motive, she
  persisting for a divorce and in love with another man?"</p>

  <p>"Personality counts with a jury. Mrs. Rue is amiable, she doesn't seem in
  the least like a woman to inflict a horrible death on another."</p>

  <p>"She might not have known the poison wasn't painless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That would be true of Mrs. Rue, or anyone else," replied Mr.</p>

  <p>Southey, giving his client a sharp look.</p>

  <p>"She had the strongest motive of anyone, and I think it should be brought
  home to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you? I don't believe her guilty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is," broke in Mrs. Sacret. "I know it."</p>

  <p>He was plainly startled behind his legal manner.</p>

  <p>"Explain yourself," he said curtly. "You should have spoken before."</p>

  <p>"I did not want to give her away, but I can't be expected to face a murder
  charge on her behalf&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please tell me plainly what you know."</p>

  <p>"She was Sir John's mistress."</p>

  <p>"You have proof?"</p>

  <p>"Letters&mdash;her confession, his confession."</p>

  <p>"Witnesses to these confessions?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What are these letters?"</p>

  <p>"She wrote them to me about three years ago&mdash;they gave an account of
  this&mdash;intrigue."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"Safe enough."</p>

  <p>"Don't evade me. Can you produce them?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was so sorry for her I destroyed them."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mr. Southey quietly, "you have no proof of anything."</p>

  <p>"No, but if Susan was questioned about these letters she would break down
  and give herself away."</p>

  <p>"Sir Matthew would see to that. Three years old, you say? Then Mrs. Rue
  had not married a second time&mdash;she was a widow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you any suspicion that this intrigue was carried on after the second
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"I think you do. I believe it could be proved that Sir John and Mrs. Rue
  never met."</p>

  <p>"Even so," exclaimed Mrs. Sacret angrily, "would it not destroy her credit
  with the jury and point to her as the criminal, if it were proved that she
  and Sir John committed perjury and that they <i>were</i> lovers?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly might, but it would be difficult to prove."</p>

  <p>"There must be people who know, places where they stayed&mdash;servants,
  who are always spying and watching," said Mrs. Sacret vehemently. "And I
  know, she confessed to me, she won't deny it, and then I'll swear to the
  letters, I know them by heart."</p>

  <p>"Better not," advised Mr. Southey dryly. "It will put you in a bad light.
  And it doesn't prove that she murdered her husband&mdash;you said you knew
  she was guilty, you don't, only that she was Sir John Curle's mistress
  between her marriages, and there is only your word for that."</p>

  <p>"Certainly to look at him you'd never think it," she retorted sharply. "So
  ordinary!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Southey smiled. "You don't know much of the world, Mrs. Sacret, you
  really have no experience at all, you might make a bad mistake some day, by
  being so complacently sure of yourself when you know nothing."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret smiled also, she could afford to treat this cocksure lawyer's
  advice with contempt.</p>

  <p>"So much for her air of innocence, anyway."</p>

  <p>"So much," repeated Mr. Southey. "She swore that she was not a faithless
  wife, I believe it is true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I'll swear to what she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you want me to throw up your case. This is not a trial, the
  witnesses come and go as counsel please, and there are a large number of
  counsel. There will be no addresses to the jury and the coroner in his
  summing up cannot hope to compete with a judge. A great mass of detail that
  has nothing to do with the issue has been introduced, and the confusion is
  such I don't think that any jury would convict anyone&mdash;so you can spare
  your friend's reputation&mdash;and your own."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret, having vented her sense of injustice at her lawyer's praise
  of Susan, now recollected that if she could preserve her secret while
  securing her own safety it would be well for her as regards the
  future&mdash;when Mr. Southey remarked, "Will you allow me to see those
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot do so&mdash;I destroyed them."</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that, Mrs. Sacret, for it is clear that Sir Matthew was
  right in his hint&mdash;you obtained your footing in the Old Priory by means
  of those letters."</p>

  <p>As she began to protest, he raised his hand with an air of authority. "Sir
  Matthew did not name the letters, he suggested blackmail. It is so obvious,
  after your confession."</p>

  <p>"My confession! I spoke of Susan's confession&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Implicit in that was your own admission of blackmail. Only fear of a
  charge of murder forced you to wish to state the existence of these letters.
  You intended to hold them over Mrs. Rue in the future. She is so confident of
  that that she does not fear your revelation&mdash;that it is so much in your
  interest not to make. Therefore, Mrs. Sacret, I do not believe that you have
  destroyed these letters that must have been your most precious
  possession."</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;she begged me to do so, and I did."</p>

  <p>At that moment Mrs. Sacret hated the painter and his tawdry deceptions, so
  ardently did she wish she could show Mr. Southey that packet of letters, not
  only from an instinctive, jealous wish to lower Susan from her false attitude
  of innocence, but because of her deep-seated fear for herself. She wanted to
  persuade Mr. Southey that Susan had every cause to murder her husband in her
  wish to return to the man of whom she had written so passionately. Mr.
  Southey changed his tactics. She was used to that from watching the legal
  fray at the inquiry, and ready for him.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Mr. Rue of these letters?"</p>

  <p>"I hinted at something of the kind&mdash;I was trying to do Susan a
  service, I thought he might be so disgusted that he would give her the
  divorce."</p>

  <p>"But he refused to believe anything against her?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was astonished and vexed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he did, yes&mdash;but I don't know how you guessed."</p>

  <p>"Logical deduction, Mrs. Sacret. Here was a man devoted to his wife,
  keeping her against her will, he did not want any excuse for releasing her.
  He must have hated you."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," replied the wary young woman. "He was always
  civil&mdash;he gave me one of his precious flowers once&mdash;puce and
  scarlet, he said it was like me."</p>

  <p>"All the same, he insisted on your dismissal. Nov Mrs. Sacret, pray let me
  see the letters. Remember you cannot persuade me you destroyed them."</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"Remember Mrs. Rue can be asked if she thinks these letters
  destroyed&mdash;if she does so think, why should she keep you? Obviously she
  doesn't like you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret faltered and lied too quickly.</p>

  <p>"Well, then&mdash;she doesn't know I've destroyed them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet, it was done out of kindness to her? Come, now, Mrs. Sacret, this is
  too crude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They were stolen&mdash;why do you torment me like this?"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>She lied wildly. "I had them in a reticule and left it behind in a
  shop&mdash;I could never trace them&mdash;as Susan doesn't know, it doesn't
  matter. Do pray, recall you are my lawyer, and think of my affairs."</p>

  <p>"I am briefed as counsel to watch your interests in this inquiry. I am
  doing that. I have only a few more questions to ask. Did Mrs. George Rue know
  of these letters?"</p>

  <p>"She was vulgar enough to guess at something of the sort&mdash;but she got
  nothing from me."</p>

  <p>"I see. Now the large sum of money and the emeralds Mrs. Rue raised so
  quickly and that were brought to her a few hours before her husband's death.
  Were they not for you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mrs. Sacret at once. This was evidence against Susan that she
  could not afford to throw away. "It was just a little matter between Susan
  and myself&mdash;I used to tease her about the letters and she gave me little
  presents, nothing much. Of course that money was for her elopement." a
  "Absurd. Had she contemplated anything so mad as eloping so soon after her
  husband's violent death her lover would have supplied the money. Besides, as
  a wealthy woman she could have changed a check easily, anywhere."</p>

  <p>"I did not have it," smiled Mrs. Sacret. She was relieved that he did not
  press this point nor go into her thin story about the loss of the letters,
  but he opened another hardly more welcome.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Dasent, as she was then, wrote to you, a missionary's wife, letters
  definitely stating she was the mistress of a married man, and you did
  nothing, you even continued the friendship?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret's smile brightened. After all, the convenient truth would
  serve here.</p>

  <p>"I was so innocent myself I thought the letters harmless, that was the
  word I always used. Then, three years after, when visiting Susan she showed
  such fright, she offered such bribes, I guessed&mdash;then she
  confessed."</p>

  <p>"But not before witnesses, and if the letters are so ambiguous, she has
  nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p>"But she <i>is</i> afraid. She is <i>guilty</i>. <i>Tax</i> her with it,
  <i>tax</i> Sir John."</p>

  <p>"I've said&mdash;I do not think that would be wise, you might not be
  believed as you have no proof and you would lose sympathy. She might
  <i>not</i> break down, nor might he&mdash;such a thing can't be wrung out of
  a gentleman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Even on oath?" sneered Mrs. Sacret.</p>

  <p>"Even on oath," he repeated gravely, then he rapidly changed the subject.
  "The servants at the Old Priory say you had a very handsome
  wardrobe&mdash;but Curtis says that when you went to Brighton you had but the
  one gown and no luggage. Mrs. Rue bought you a second outfit&mdash;how do you
  account for that?"</p>

  <p>"My clothes were stolen from Minton Street, <i>you</i> told me, Mr.
  Southey, and that horrid slut was wearing some of mine."</p>

  <p>"Yes, <i>I</i> told you&mdash;but you did not know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course not! But I had packed all my luggage and had it sent to
  Minton Street&mdash;and it did not seem worth while sending for it, so Susan
  bought me new things."</p>

  <p>Even to herself this sounded feeble, but Mr. Southey passed it, merely
  remarking: "Then your tenant, who must have kept a key, went back to your
  house and rifled your trunks?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. It is dreadful&mdash;I must go and see what has
  happened&mdash;how much I have lost&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have not been?"</p>

  <p>"Is it likely! With all this horrible anxiety!"</p>

  <p>"Some of your neighbors say you were seen there while living at
  Brighton."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense! Those low gossips will say anything!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Southey did not pursue any of these lines of inquiry and rose, as if
  he, not Mrs. Sacret, had sought the interview. She also was quickly on her
  feet, remarking:</p>

  <p>"I wanted to give you a valuable piece of evidence but not only do you
  refuse to use it, you subject me to a long examination on trivial
  subjects&mdash;I do declare I don't think much of the legal mind."</p>

  <p>What he next said made her think even less, for pausing at the door, he
  asked:</p>

  <p>"You were annoyed at the thought of Sir John Curie in the role of a lover,
  what do you consider a romantic type of man?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret concealed her contempt, no doubt this ugly lawyer was angling
  clumsily for a compliment.</p>

  <p>"<i>Not</i> Sir John, nondescript and middle aged," she answered smoothly.
  "Not my poor husband, that was a marriage of high principles, we felt
  inspired to do God's work in Jamaica&mdash;not Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>She described him keenly, in the points where he resembled the lawyer.
  "Sand-colored hair, white lashes, gooseberry eyes, ugh! Not any man in court,
  I think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Southey smiled.</p>

  <p>"It helps me in my profession to know the ladies' taste&mdash;you haven't
  mentioned a dark-haired, black-eyed or gray-eyed fellow, straight features, a
  little gold&mdash;not sand&mdash;over him, rather pale, but looks open
  air&mdash;elegant, tall, graceful manners&mdash;now would you consider that a
  romantic type?"</p>

  <p>"Any woman would."</p>

  <p>"Just so. That is what I thought, any woman would."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;what nonsense, when we were talking so seriously. I must remind
  you to keep my confidence&mdash;as I may not speak in court about the
  letters, I do not desire their existence to be known."</p>

  <p>"You must rely on my discretion, Mrs. Sacret." He bowed and withdrew.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch49"
     id="ch49"></a>§ 49</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret found Curtis in charge at the Old Priory, Susan
  was in bed, with Dr. Virtue and a nurse in attendance. "They've killed her,
  the poor soul," muttered the maid bitterly as she waited at Mrs. Sacret's
  elegant supper. "Those lawyers have no pity, no decency even, why not much
  sense either, why she wouldn't hurt a fly, as the saying is."</p>

  <p>"I daresay," retorted Mrs. Sacret dryly, "but all the evidence points to
  her&mdash;she had the motive and the opportunity&mdash;and a great
  temptation."</p>

  <p>"A good thing, wasn't it, ma'am, that the poor gentleman confessed to you
  it was suicide?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but he might have done it to shield her, he was that sort of
  fool." Mrs. Sacret felt mistress of herself again, more, mistress of other
  people, her appalling fright that had made her feel helpless and stupid had
  passed. Now that she no longer was in danger she resumed her quiet, smiling
  air of authority, acquired during her chapel work, and in particular in
  Jamaica where she had queened it over the Negroes. Her brush with Mr. Southey
  had stimulated her; it did not matter, she reflected as she sipped her
  Burgundy, that she had had to confess about the letters, the lawyer had made
  very little of that, and his advice to conceal the fact of their loss suited
  her very well, Of course he would tell no one about them&mdash;why should he?
  He was <i>her</i> lawyer and sworn to secrecy, besides he believed them
  destroyed&mdash;they were in Australia, almost the same thing. She felt that
  she had more than matched him, she had quite shaken him off about the
  painter, she had impressed him as a decorous, shrewd widow who would never be
  taken in by an adventurer. And meanwhile, she was wondering if she could
  obtain sufficient money from Susan for a visit to Australia. She thought of
  Susan with contempt&mdash;that vulgar outbreak in court&mdash;and now
  collapse! Of course she had been drinking again.</p>

  <p>"Do you lock up the wine?" she asked Curtis severely, "Poor Mr. Rue would
  be very worried about this illness&mdash;you know quite well what it is."</p>

  <p>"That's Dr. Virtue's business, ma'am. If the mistress do take a drop now
  and then&mdash;what's the wonder? Plagued day after day by those nasty
  lawyers&mdash;and then pretty well accused of murder!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she was not! It is the business of the counsel to try to get at the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Why don't they take your word?" interrupted Curtis rudely. "The master
  told you it was suicide, and a missionary's widow ought to be believed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret felt comfortable, she moved to the easy chair by the window,
  the night air was sweet, and a few neglected roses and stocks gave out a
  faint perfume, the trees, ragged by day, were pleasing in outline against a
  moonlit sky, a summer warmth penetrated the gown of black mull that she wore.
  She looked at Curtis clearing away the elegant appointments of her rich meal,
  and said gently, like a cat patting a mouse, "You are very sure of your
  mistress' innocence, aren't you, Curtis?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," the servant flared up. "She didn't poison him, and she
  wasn't unfaithful to him either. I'd have known if there'd been anything of
  that sort, but there wasn't&mdash;open as the day she was, never locked a
  box."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think she was planning to elope?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," retorted the servant again, with even deeper scorn, "If
  he'd have let her go, fair and square, she'd have gone and thankful, but she
  isn't the lady to do anything underhand, open and timid, and afraid of the
  neighbors' talk, and warmhearted. Too good for him, that's what she was, a
  nasty, mean fellow, always pretending to be sick and crying out for his
  horrid old mother."</p>

  <p>"She shouldn't have married him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! And he pester, pester, and she heartbroken because Sir John was
  married! As if she guessed the kind Mr. Rue was! She's the sort of lady who
  thinks every man's a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Curtis, why do you suppose she raised that money so
  quickly&mdash;and secretly got the jewels from the bank?"</p>

  <p>"She gave them to you," replied Curtis at once, "either because of some
  tale of ill luck you'd told her, or because of something you were holding
  over her, the poor dear."</p>

  <p>"How absurd. And what do you imagine I could be holding over your virtuous
  mistress?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But she's one as gives her confidence easy and careless,
  and trusting, and simple in a way. Look how she took to heart her husband's
  death&mdash;and he nothing but a plague to her."</p>

  <p>"Kitchen gossip," smiled Mrs. Sacret, brushing aside a night moth that had
  fluttered in from the garden.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but if it were, it's in the kitchen you'll hear the truth of
  most families. But here, and in all the situations I've been used to, we say
  the servants' hall, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was angry; she frequently made these small mistakes, though
  she tried to be so careful. Angrily she reminded herself of her father's good
  birth. Curtis did not allow her time to reply, standing erect by the
  baize-lined tray on which she had collected the silver in a white napkin she
  added: "I've lived close to you ever since you came to the Old Priory, and I
  know you pretty well, ma'am, and that you had a hold on the mistress, for she
  disliked you as much as it was in her nature to dislike anyone."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had opened this conversation with the intention of rebuking
  Curtis and did not intend to be distracted. "You have been most insolent in
  court," she remarked coolly. "You are protected there, and I daresay that a
  servant relishes the chance of displaying vulgar spite, but your behavior
  will be remembered after this case is closed."</p>

  <p>The maid's thin, worried face flushed. She moved out of the circle of
  lamplight, but answered firmly, "I took my Bible oath. And I answered all
  questions truthfully."</p>

  <p>"You showed you had spied and sneaked&mdash;how came you to notice my
  green and crimson dress?"</p>

  <p>"Anyone would. It was so overdone&mdash;and for your station."</p>

  <p>"Need you have said it was mine when one of the lawyers, I suppose it was,
  showed it you?"</p>

  <p>"It was the police, Detective Precious," said Curtis tartly. "<i>I</i>
  didn't know where he found the dress, but when he showed me that rig-out I
  knew it at once, and said so&mdash;I'm not going to monkey with the
  police."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the police were called in because I had a robbery," replied
  Mrs. Sacret. "Anyhow it was no business of yours&mdash;and how prying you
  must have been to notice I had only one dress when I came to Brighton!"</p>

  <p>"Anyone would have noticed&mdash;after seeing all those fine clothes the
  mistress bought for you, from her own dressmaker, and the toilet sets and
  gloves and shoes." Curtis drew an angry breath then continued, "and the
  handsome trunks&mdash;then you with nothing, and instead of sending for your
  things&mdash;wherever they were, you stayed on, month after month, at
  Brighton, letting my mistress buy you everything over again."</p>

  <p>"I was robbed&mdash;that is what servants&mdash;uneducated
  people&mdash;do, make a mystery about nothing. You tried your best, Curtis,
  to make me appear an evil woman."</p>

  <p>"If evil has been done, sooner you than the mistress," replied Curtis
  sullenly. "I don't pretend I like you. I'll tell you to your face what I said
  publicly&mdash;you're only ladylike, not a lady, you haven't been brought up
  as one, you haven't a lady's instincts&mdash;and there's ladies' instincts
  like there is gentlemen's."</p>

  <p>"Quite a speech," smiled Mrs. Sacret, "and all it means is that poor, meek
  Mrs. Rue spoiled you very much and that you resented my noticing your waste
  and extravagance&mdash;and insolence. You're being rash, aren't you? You say
  that I have an influence over your mistress&mdash;well, I shall certainly use
  it to urge your dismissal."</p>

  <p>"She would never part with me&mdash;for the little time she has," replied
  Curtis abruptly and left the room with the tray of silver.</p>

  <p>"Sentimental fool," thought Mrs. Sacret. "Susan will live to be
  eighty&mdash;and marry again within the year, if not Sir John, then someone
  else."</p>

  <p>Another maid came in to finish clearing the table and to trim the lamp,
  and Mrs. Sacret remained comfortable at the window. Her escape from danger
  was so recent she was not capable of reflecting on the wretched ending of her
  delicious friendship with the painter, she was too absorbed in realizing that
  the terrible peril that Mr. Southey had pointed out to her, a few days ago,
  was past.</p>

  <p>She was slightly worried over the loss of her trunks; of course her
  neighbors had seen her bring them to Minton Street, and the painter fetch
  them away; that would pass very well, he had stolen them (this was the truth)
  but she could not recall the dates and feared they did not fit together.
  Surely&mdash;of course&mdash;the trunks had been taken before she left the
  Old Priory? She could cover all that up, but there was not likely to be any
  further inquiries over anything so trivial. This mention of the police had
  been startling, but, of course, police as well as lawyers were employed on a
  case like this. She wished that she knew more of the law. It seemed
  reasonable that the police should look into her antecedents&mdash;she was
  glad if they had done so, her record was so spotless&mdash;and so, of course,
  they would come on her tenant, and through him the horrible creature
  Feathers. But why had they shown the dress to Curtis? They must have been
  sure it was stolen property and guessed&mdash;when they found the man had
  left the country&mdash;that it was part of a haul from Minton Street, but why
  didn't they show it to her, instead of to the servant? Mrs. Sacret could not
  understand this, nor why the garments had not been returned to her, nor why
  the police had not made a hue and cry over the trunks. But she supposed they
  had let it all drop as the criminal had escaped and the whole business had
  nothing to do with the Rue case, certainly it had never been mentioned in
  court. Mrs. Sacret could only suppose that the police&mdash;this man,
  Precious&mdash;had guessed the dress belonged to her and had gone to Mr.
  Southey, her lawyer, and he had said she was not to be disturbed while the
  case was on. Yes, that was it, and it was only through the carelessness of
  Mr. Southey (she considered him a stupid man) and the spite of Curtis (she
  forgot she had questioned her) that this silly affair about the dress had
  come to her ears.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch50"

  <p class="first">The sensational second inquiry into the death of Martin Rue
  began to lose the public interest. There was nothing sensational about it
  after Susan Rue's outburst.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret did not need to save herself by revealing what she termed,
  privately and indignantly, Susan's "guilty secret."</p>

  <p>The exasperated and bewildered jury did their best to keep level heads and
  open minds but, though convinced of foul play, and as incredulous of the
  suicide theory as the former jury had been credulous, they could not decide
  on the identity of the criminal. The verdict was "Murder by some person or
  persons unknown."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch51"
     id="ch51"></a>§ 51</h2>

  <p class="first">Susan Rue had completed her packing, everything was ready
  for her departure from the home where her husband had died. It had already
  been sold for the value of the ground, for no one wished to reside in the
  expensive mansion that had been the scene of what still was known as "The
  Clapham Mystery."</p>

  <p>Now that the excitement and the publicity of the second inquiry were over,
  Mrs. Sacret felt dull and flat, and filled with a burning rage against the
  painter, now definitely revealed as a commonplace, cheap criminal, well known
  to the police. Her deepest rage was for her money, her jewels, her clothes,
  they formed the tangible part of her charms. Her feelings toward the man and
  his promises were frozen. She saw him completely objectively as vulgar,
  trivial, not a gentleman. She could not understand why she had ever thought
  him superior to other men. She had always known that he had told her silly
  lies, he had really always been, to her, the type who would rob and run away.
  He had done worse than that&mdash;he had nearly put the rope round her
  neck.</p>

  <p>She checked her thoughts violently&mdash;where did that coarse expression
  come from, and how meaningless it was! Of course Martin Rue had taken his own
  life.</p>

  <p>Later she knew she would begin to count over the promises the painter had
  made and broken, the hopes he had raised and blasted, the low trick with the
  slut Feathers, and then she might feel hatred or a deadly regret, now she had
  the present to think of and she dwelt coldly on what good luck she still had.
  Her escape from the peril Mr. Southey had pointed out, her "hold" (she used
  that word herself) over Susan.</p>

  <p>After all, Susan was free and very wealthy, they could go abroad, and
  maybe she, Olivia Sacret, could find someone as fascinating and more honest
  than the painter to admire her prim charms. Yet even while she indulged in
  these hopes, some inner essence of her being was in wild revolt, remembering
  that day at Lyndbridge House&mdash;all she had lost, lost.</p>

  <p class="first">"Now this nasty affair is over," smiled Mrs. Sacret, "we
  must think of ourselves a little&mdash;it has been such a fatiguing time!
  Brighton won't do now&mdash;what about Como or Paris?"</p>

  <p>"We are parting," replied Susan Rue, "I do not know where I shall go, but
  you shall not be with me&mdash;I want you to leave this house even before I
  do."</p>

  <p>"All this anxiety has turned your head, Susan, you know that you cannot be
  rid of me."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Southey told me that you had confessed you no longer had the
  letters," said Susan faintly.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Mrs. Sacret, startled into fury. "How could he be so false,
  and he feed to look after my interests!"</p>

  <p>"So he was. But he found out that you are a wicked woman," murmured Susan
  with simplicity, "and he told me&mdash;for he realized how I was
  suffering&mdash;he said he did not believe that you had destroyed them as you
  declared you had, but that it must be out of your power to produce them, or
  you would have done so."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool&mdash;I just said that to save you, to deceive Mr.
  Southey."</p>

  <p>"Useless for you to lie&mdash;how would Mr. Southey have known of the
  letters? He conveyed to me that you were eager to save yourself at my
  expense," Susan sighed, without malice.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret could only stammer&mdash;"The letters are not destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Southey is a clever man. He read you quite well. I shall believe what
  he said, and be at peace on that score."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was startled and bewildered. She, who was so clever, had
  thought the lawyer stupid. Susan, so simple, had relied on his judgment.</p>

  <p>"At peace," repeated Susan, "from you&mdash;not from my dreadful thoughts
  of how I drove him to it."</p>

  <p>"The verdict said murder," Mrs. Sacret reminded her brutally.</p>

  <p>"No one could have murdered him&mdash;he went into the stables and saw
  that bottle, or more likely it was something in the Indian basket&mdash;"
  Susan's words died away, she made an effort and added, "I am not afraid of
  you any longer. Please go away."</p>

  <p>Terror succeeded rage in Mrs. Sacret's stormy heart. "Your best friend,"
  she said, "after all I have done for you&mdash;how can you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to drive you to despair, I shall give you a little money.
  You have had a great deal, but Mr. Southey thinks that you have lost it
  all."</p>

  <p>"How dare this cunning lawyer judge me!"</p>

  <p>"They do judge people, Olivia, that is what they are trained to do."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'a little money'!" exclaimed Mrs. Sacret furiously.
  "You are very wealthy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have returned all Martin's money to his mother, but it is true that I
  am rich. I shall give you what Mr. Southey advises."</p>

  <p>"Always this wretched lawyer! Remember I could tell a good tale even
  without the letters, remember what you confessed to me&mdash;and Sir John
  also."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Southey thinks no one would take any notice of you as you have no
  proof and that if you defamed me I could bring an action for libel."</p>

  <p>To Mrs. Sacret, this was monstrous.</p>

  <p>"Perjury is a crime. I know that you and Sir John lied on oath. All he
  swore about that interview with me was totally false."</p>

  <p>"And so was what you swore, I don't doubt, and none of this will make any
  difference. Sir John and I will be believed and you won't."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because we are respectable people."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret laughed furiously, she felt entangled, stifled in a mesh of
  she knew not what, of the sins and failings of others. Her contempt for Susan
  and Susan's lover was sincere, so was her rage against the painter, her scorn
  against old Mrs. Rue, against the dead man. She felt herself to have
  been&mdash;to be&mdash;the one upright and intelligent person among a crowd
  of scoundrels and fools. Mr. Southey was included in her pervading
  wrath&mdash;he, who had been paid to defend her, had wormed her secrets out
  of her and then betrayed her to Susan, thus rendering her one weapon, the
  letters, useless.</p>

  <p>Susan had escaped, Susan was no longer afraid of her. She must realize
  that hard fact, the central fact of her stripped existence now. Susan
  believed the lawyer, trusted his wit, his wisdom, would never give any credit
  to Olivia's hollow threats.</p>

  <p>Generosity&mdash;a small pension&mdash;then what?</p>

  <p>She thought of the portrait done in Minton Street&mdash;painted for her to
  see herself as she was&mdash;what was to become of that audacious, comely,
  well-dressed young woman now? What was to become of the dreamer who had sat
  in the aristocratic room in Lyndbridge House and longed for the Italian
  adventure?</p>

  <p>"You are no worse off than when you came to the Old Priory," said Susan,
  observing her quietly. "While between then and now life has been ruined for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, how often have I reminded you how unhappy you were then!"</p>

  <p>"How often have I replied that then I did not even know what unhappiness
  was."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret struggled to keep to realities&mdash;her realities.</p>

  <p>"How much money are you giving me?"</p>

  <p>"The affair is in the hands of Mr. Southey&mdash;he spoke of a hundred a
  year. You have no claim to anything."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret thought of Australia, of getting the money for her passage, of
  searching for the painter there, yet she realized no action could be more
  desperate. She did not even know what name he might be using, nor in what
  part of that continent he might be.</p>

  <p>"Go away now, please," said Susan. "This house is not mine. I must leave
  it myself in a few days' time."</p>

  <p>Susan, no longer in terror of the letters, and no longer in hope of love,
  Susan bent on expiation, was very different from the weak creature who had
  bent before the missionary's widow. Olivia saw that she could not move her by
  threats or persuasion. There was nothing for her to do but to retire to her
  ghastly retreat at Minton Street, and there to think over her future
  plans.</p>

  <p>She stared at Susan, opened her lips, but could not speak. She would have
  uttered a curse could she have done so, but her training had been too rigid;
  she bowed stiffly and left the room, closing the door with meticulous care,
  like a well-trained servant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch53"
     id="ch53"></a>§ 53</h2>

  <p class="first">Susan Rue, left to herself, returned to her constant
  preoccupation, brooding over her husband's suicide, to which she was
  convinced she had driven him by her thoughtless, as she termed it to herself,
  wicked behavior. She had returned to Mrs. George Rue all Martin's possessions
  as well as all his money&mdash;all his possessions save one, and that she
  could not have sent to the bereaved woman in Blackheath, for it was the
  hempen basket in which the dead man had kept his medicines. The contents had
  several times been examined by the physicians and declared harmless and it
  had finally been put at the back of one of the cupboards in the room where
  Susan now sat. She had never quite forgotten it, but never had it been in the
  forefront of her mind as it was now. For it must be disposed of soon, before
  she left the Old Priory. She knew he had died from antimony poisoning, yet
  she still associated his private medicine store with his death, and with some
  fatal compound he must have concocted for himself. She never really thought
  of him as going to the stable to steal away the horse medicine, but rather as
  brooding over the Indian basket with which she was so familiar and from which
  she had so often seen him mix his own peculiar medicines. Making an effort
  over inertia and exhaustion, Susan rose and walked slowly to the built-in
  cupboard and opened it. For awhile her eyes, inflamed by continual weeping,
  could see nothing but interlaced shadows that the last daylight, falling into
  the cupboard, cast from the medley of objects there&mdash;workboxes, tea
  chests, packs of cards in elastic bands, broken flower vases and lamps. She
  reflected wearily that there was still much work to do before the Old Priory
  was ready to be shut up in readiness for the purchasers and she wondered,
  with hardly any interest, where she should go, and what she should do, for
  the rest of her life. She had no plan beyond the project of returning to
  Brighton with Curtis, she hardly realized that she was relieved of the
  detestable burden of Mrs. Sacret's company. She saw the hempen basket and
  fetched it out with slack hands. "I must take it away and pour out the
  contents of these bottles&mdash;there is not much left in any of them, but I
  suppose these are dangerous&mdash;laudanum, chloroform."</p>

  <p>She, hesitant, uncertain now in all her actions, placed the basket on a
  side table and went to the buffet. There was now no one to check her and she
  felt such a wave of melancholy that she eagerly poured herself three glasses
  of sherry and drank them, one after another. A sparkle of hope returned to
  her sad heart. Perhaps, in expiation, she might find some peace, some
  tranquillity. She recalled both that she was young and that her reputation
  was safe. Olivia Sacret did not possess those frightening letters. She, poor,
  silly Susan, who had already been cruelly exposed in the witness box as
  feeble, inconstant and unkind, had at least escaped open shame. She could
  still pass as a respectable woman, she thought; she need no longer bribe or
  tolerate Mrs. Sacret, the cold, dark widow.</p>

  <p>Curtis entered, drew the curtains, set the lit lamp on the round table by
  the hempen basket and said, "Mrs. George Rue is here, madam, and so is a
  strange gentleman. They were on the steps together. Shall you see either, or
  both of them?"</p>

  <p>"Old Mrs. Rue!" Susan was startled; her return of Martin's money to his
  mother had been a lawyer's affair and she had received a dry, legal
  acknowledgment of her action. Now she recalled that her mother-in-law had
  always hated her and spoken cruelly against her in the witness box at the
  second inquiry into the cause of the death of Martin Rue.</p>

  <p>"I'll not see her, Curtis, she comes only to insult me. This gentleman,
  who is he?"</p>

  <p>"He gives the name of Mr. Arrow, madam, Mr. David Arrow, and says he comes
  on business connected with the late Mr. Rue."</p>

  <p>"He should go to the lawyers."</p>

  <p>"I told him that, madam. He said it was a personal affair&mdash;for you
  only, and that the late Mr. Rue would have wished you to see him."</p>

  <p>"Then I must, I suppose," replied Susan vaguely. "I daresay that it is
  something unpleasant, but I ought not to mind that! I can endure a good
  deal&mdash;is he really a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>Curtis hesitated. "He is very soft spoken, rather like a foreigner, if you
  know what I mean, not at all rude or common, I am sure that he would never
  offend."</p>

  <p>Susan did not observe that her question had been evaded. "I shall see
  him&mdash;but send old Mrs. Rue away&mdash;she must understand she has no
  right to come here."</p>

  <p>Curtis was still ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"It is your mother-in-law, madam, and this the home where her son died, if
  you will forgive me for saying so, and to turn her away, while you admit a
  stranger&mdash;" The well-trained voice ceased dutifully. Susan was unmoved
  by this plea for the proprieties.</p>

  <p>"I've had enough of hatred," she answered. "Let her rest&mdash;give her a
  glass of wine, I suppose that she has come from Blackheath, but I'll not see
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Curtis did not find it easy to dismiss Mrs. George Rue, whom she had left
  in the front parlor, the stranger being in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Tell her that it is most important, that I'll not be turned away," the
  old woman said, her usually arrogant tone most subdued. "I know that she
  doesn't think well of me and has good cause."</p>

  <p>"She is resolved to see a gentleman who has come on pressing
  business."</p>

  <p>"It can't be more pressing than mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But she is resolved&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wait here&mdash;if it is a matter of affairs&mdash;and an odd
  time and place for that&mdash;it can't take long&mdash;I'll wait."</p>

  <p>Curtis submitted. Not only was she unfitted to deal with one so much her
  superior, and from whom she had been used to receive orders, but she
  cherished the feeling that these two unhappy and bereaved women should not be
  kept apart. She even, without knowing why, attached some importance to this
  visit, at this late hour, of Mrs. George Rue to her dead son's home.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, madam, I'll speak to my mistress when this gentleman has
  gone. Meanwhile, I am to offer you a glass of wine."</p>

  <p>"No, no, I thank you, I want nothing but to see her, Mrs. Martin Rue."</p>

  <p>"Then you must wait, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Curtis was firm this far and shut the door on the old woman in her heavy
  mourning, who sat heavy and silent again in the rosy light of the silver lamp
  that showed softly in the twilight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch54"
     id="ch54"></a>§ 54</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. David Arrow presented himself carefully before Susan and
  spoke with an air of precision. That was her impression of this quiet
  man&mdash;care and precision; as she rose to meet him, holding out her hand
  vaguely, her senses, as was usual with her now, were clouded by the wine she
  had drunk. He appeared to her as the one definite, harsh outline in a room
  filled by interlacing shadows that, when she peered closer, seemed to shift
  into the forms of phantoms.</p>

  <p>"I shall not detain you long, Mrs. Rue," said Mr. Arrow politely. "I am
  delighted to make your acquaintance, I have heard of you so often."</p>

  <p>His voice was pleasant, but these commonplace words seemed to Susan to
  tingle with menace. She saw a slight, dark, clean-shaven man, who wore smoked
  glasses and a countryman's suit of homespun cloth.</p>

  <p>"I don't know you, sir," she murmured, withdrawing.</p>

  <p>"But I know you very well, Mrs. Rue. The truth is that I must come to the
  point quickly, for I am pressed, in every way pressed. I don't say that I
  haven't some skill in throwing them off the scent, and that I don't enjoy the
  game for its own sake. But I think it is time that I left the country."</p>

  <p>"What has this to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"I want money, and you must supply it&mdash;better for both of us if I am
  blunt. I was a partner with your friend, Olivia Sacret."</p>

  <p>"My friend, friend, friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Our schemes were not successful, owing to her vanity and stupidity. But
  you have had some good luck. You are free of your odious husband and able to
  marry your noble baronet."</p>

  <p>"Olivia Sacret sent you whispered Susan.</p>

  <p>"No, nor are we likely to see one another again."</p>

  <p>"Then who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I've no time to answer. I intend to treat you kindly, gently You are a
  very wealthy woman, and all I require is a little sum of money now and
  then&mdash;now, urgently, I need a thousand pounds, that you can easily
  obtain as you obtained the last sum, by tomorrow evening. It may be in gold,
  or jewelry&mdash;not notes." He drew out a packet of letters from the deep
  pocket of his gray Quaker jacket and flipped over the contents. Susan
  recognized this at once and everything she ought to do became clear to her.
  The stranger saw her expression of resolve and applauded what he termed "her
  good sense."</p>

  <p>"I won't deny," he remarked easily, "that I like adventure and whimsey now
  and then, for the fun of it, but sometimes one is pressed and harassed. Not
  that I don't always leave my line of retreat open."</p>

  <p>"Tell me who you are&mdash;though it really doesn't matter," replied Susan
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"I could strike a dramatic note on that&mdash;remembering this house and
  what took place here, remembering your prospects and how you came by them. I
  never had any classical learning, but I picked up a little here and there,
  and I might term myself the Messenger of Pisiphone, the third Fairy, who was
  the avenger of blood."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will never give me the letters&mdash;but hold them over me
  always&mdash;as she did?"</p>

  <p>He returned the dog-eared bundle to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"We'll see about that&mdash;perhaps Sir John and I will have a little talk
  about that. Clever of him to go abroad&mdash;but I suppose he will soon be
  returning and there will be a fashionable marriage? Or possibly a quiet
  one?"</p>

  <p>Susan did not concern herself with contradicting this gibe, or even allow
  herself any longer to wonder as to who this man was, and how he came into the
  possession of her letters. She felt herself confronted by a just punishment
  for driving her husband to suicide. She was surprised now that she had ever
  supposed that she could evade this punishment. Everything, at last, appeared
  simple.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the money tomorrow, of course," she said.</p>

  <p>The stranger had expected this submission that he attributed to coward's
  fear; he believed her incapable of guile.</p>

  <p>"Remember, Mrs. Rue, if you should be so foolish as to tell anyone of this
  visit&mdash;to mention in any way that I have spoken to you, even to hint
  that I have the letters&mdash;those indiscreet letters&mdash;I shall send
  them to your mother-in-law."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Susan responded mechanically, without giving any
  attention.</p>

  <p>"She is indeed a fool," he thought contemptuously. "I ought to have
  handled her directly, myself, before."</p>

  <p>He had a card ready in his pocket on which was written an address in
  Highgate.</p>

  <p>"You must go there, about five o'clock tomorrow, and bring the money and
  the jewels. Ask for Mr. David Arrow."</p>

  <p>He felt sure of her; stupid as she might be, she would be quick, shrewd
  and prompt in the matter of saving her reputation, as she had been before.
  However simple she appeared, she was a woman who had carried on a clandestine
  intrigue with a married man and perjured herself in court without making a
  mistake.</p>

  <p>"I can trust you, Mrs. Rue." It was more of an assertion than a
  question.</p>

  <p>She repeated the word "trust" as she had repeated "friend," with an accent
  of curiosity and gravely bowed as the stranger, smiling, took his leave. When
  the door had closed on him, she picked up the hempen basket and went
  upstairs. She trod lightly, for dread of being seen, of being interrupted,
  and vanished lightly into her bedroom, only pausing to glance, for a second,
  with a look of wonder, at the door of the empty room where her husband had
  died.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch55"
     id="ch55"></a>§ 55</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. George Rue pulled the bell rope by the hearth and when
  Curtis appeared asked if the strange visitor had not yet gone. "It is nearly
  three quarters of an hour that I have waited here."</p>

  <p>"You would stay, ma'am," replied the servant. "If the gentleman had gone
  I'd have known. Mistress always rings for me to show visitors out&mdash;not
  that she has many now."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;too much scandal and trouble&mdash;people keep away. Well, I'm
  here. And I mean to stay until I see her."</p>

  <p>"If it's to torment her, ma'am," began Curtis in a trembling defiance, but
  the elder woman interrupted fiercely, "It isn't&mdash;I feel I was mistaken
  in her, and that she needs a friend."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough, there's only myself, a servant, and a few neighbors
  and acquaintances, who come out of curiosity, to my thinking."</p>

  <p>"She must be much alone."</p>

  <p>Curtis noted with surprise that the heavy woman, whom she had always
  regarded as malignant, appeared agitated, even troubled, and the widow
  observed this astonishment and added in a shamefaced tone:</p>

  <p>"I daresay you think I hounded her. There, I can speak to you openly, you
  are her confidante, if anyone is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>She's</i> no secrets to hide," interrupted Curtis, "and never
  had&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I daresay. I begin to see that now. She was a foolish creature and
  pampered and not the wife for my poor son, but I see I was mistaken in much,
  and I'd never be small minded and not say when I had been in error."</p>

  <p>"And what has made you change your opinion, if I may ask?" inquired Curtis
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue lowered her voice, as one who speaks of very delicate
  affairs. She had for some time felt the desire to unburden herself on this
  matter and had not, until now, had anyone in whom she could confide. The
  impulse that had sent her to the Old Priory, an impulse that had sprung from
  a secret agony of deliberation, had been sharpened by her daughter-in-law's
  denial of her, and the long waiting in the parlor, already dismantled for the
  final clearance of her late son's goods and chattels.</p>

  <p>"As I said, Curtis, I don't mind confiding in you, who have stood by and
  seen everything," she whispered hoarsely. "I've thought it all over and
  though there's no doubt that she was a silly, light thing&mdash;was, I
  say&mdash;I think she was no more. I think well of Sir John going
  abroad&mdash;a final parting it seems to be, and that makes me believe that
  she is a good woman and has some respect for my poor son's memory, after
  all."</p>

  <p>"A pity you hadn't come to that opinion at the inquest and the inquiry,
  ma'am, when you hadn't a good word to say for her."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I admit that."</p>

  <p>"And I do think," added Curtis stoutly, "it is odd that you should have
  changed so."</p>

  <p>"Susan&mdash;your mistress&mdash;returned to me all my son's
  money&mdash;without a scene, or wanting thanks, just formally, through the
  lawyers. That shows she isn't grasping."</p>

  <p>The servant was silent. She found it hard to dismiss all her resentment
  against this unpleasant old woman, who had been so prejudiced, cruel and
  stupid, yet she felt obliged to credit her present sincerity and she realized
  how stern an effort this visit must have cost one naturally so harsh. More
  than that, her compassion and affection for her mistress weighed with her,
  the unfortunate lady was so alone, so sad and hopeless, so friendless. Was
  not this dubious kindness better than none?</p>

  <p>"You <i>ought</i> to be a mother to her," she remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I could never be that, Curtis. I daresay that there would never be much
  sympathy between us. But I could stand by her, give her countenance&mdash;if
  she could forgive me," added the old woman with halting difficulty.</p>

  <p>"She'd never bear malice to anyone&mdash;it isn't in her," said
  Curtis.</p>

  <p>"So I think. I wish I had written to her, or come to see her before, it
  was a struggle and took a long time to decide, as matters do when you have to
  think them out alone."</p>

  <p>The two women had drawn closer together, a common understanding
  encompassed them.</p>

  <p>"It was that Mrs. Sacret," remarked Curtis. "She was all the trouble."</p>

  <p>"I know it," agreed the other with a glinting look. "I soon had <i>her</i>
  measure. She had a hold on your mistress."</p>

  <p>"I'd have supposed that&mdash;but Mrs. Martin Rue isn't a lady to have
  secrets."</p>

  <p>"So I think now. I was misled. But everything seemed to indicate
  blackmail."</p>

  <p>"That is a nasty word."</p>

  <p>"A murderous kind of word. That missionary's widow, that chapel
  woman&mdash;she had <i>something</i>. Letters, I suppose. I don't believe
  that they were more than indiscreet, but Susan was frightened."</p>

  <p>"She isn't now," put in Curtis rapidly. "Mrs. Sacret's going, never to
  come back. Mistress said the lawyer, Mr. Southey, had settled
  <i>that</i>&mdash;but she didn't say what <i>that</i> was."</p>

  <p>"There!" exclaimed Mrs. George Rue triumphantly. "What you say shows I am
  right&mdash;it was some trifle Susan exaggerated and she is a good woman. I
  wish she had confided in me, I should have known how to have dealt with that
  sly, evil creature."</p>

  <p>"You didn't encourage my mistress to confide in you," said Curtis with a
  touch of returning resentment.</p>

  <p>"No. But now it shall be different. I shall persuade her to tell me
  everything and to help me to bring this wretched Dissenter to justice."</p>

  <p>"My mistress won't want any more scandal."</p>

  <p>"There are secret ways of justice, Curtis&mdash;I'll go to her now."</p>

  <p>These last words broke the spell of the women's absorption in another
  woman's story. They had not observed the passage of time nor how the day was
  beginning to darken around them and the rosy light of the small silver lamp.
  They were startled by the twilight and the silence that surrounded that faint
  glow of artificial light.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must go to her," repeated Mrs George Rue hurriedly. "How the time
  has passed, talking, surely it is getting late. Oh, yes, getting late!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, ma'am, I don't know what I was thinking of&mdash;late and
  dark&mdash;That little lamp just shows the shadows."</p>

  <p>"Late and dark"&mdash;Curtis forced herself to regain a control that she
  felt, unaccountably, to be breaking. "I suppose it is what I have been
  through," she murmured. "My nerves are all gone."</p>

  <p>"What did you say, Curtis, that your nerves are all gone?" Mrs. George Rue
  rose. "I suppose you mean that you are overtired, with all these horrors. I'm
  here now. I'll help you look after your mistress. We might all go away
  together."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am, all go away together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again the two women were silent, listening to the silence, staring into
  the dusk that seemed to them to thicken rapidly.</p>

  <p>The old woman, helping herself by her stick, crossed to the door and
  repeated her demand for more lamps.</p>

  <p>"I'll light the gas in the hall," muttered Curtis. "Mistress always
  disliked it, you know. Lamps are more in keeping with the Old Priory, she
  always said. But so many of them have been put away, or sold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She asked me," said Mrs. George Rue rapidly, "if I wanted my son's things
  out of this house, or the house itself, and I replied&mdash;no, indeed
  no&mdash;so she instructed her lawyers to sell it all&mdash;all the
  property&mdash;for my benefit."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is to be all sold&mdash;you see that there is nothing much left,
  only a chair or so, and the beds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No one looked after my son's conservatory, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"The mistress&mdash;as much as she could&mdash;before she went to
  Brighton&mdash;then the gardener was dismissed and the stove wasn't looked
  to, and all the plants died."</p>

  <p>"They would with neglect&mdash;my son had some fine specimens, he received
  a medal once. Ordinary flowers, some of them, but grown to great perfection.
  I hope that chapel woman never meddled with them."</p>

  <p>"That's a queer thing to say, ma'am. I don't think she did. She was always
  well behaved, as those sham ladies are. What she did was underground. Master
  gave her a pot plant once, puce and scarlet. She was very proud of it,
  because he said it was like her, but she soon forgot it and put it out on her
  window sill, where he found it, quite withered."</p>

  <p>The two women were now in the passage, and Curtis had lowered the ring of
  gas jets on its chain and lit these from a box of lucifer matches taken from
  her apron pocket; as the circle of heart-shaped flames, blue and yellow, was
  raised into place, shedding through opal globes an illumination cold and
  piercing along the hall and up the stairs, Mrs. George Rue whispered:</p>

  <p>"We are making delays on purpose. Why doesn't your mistress ring for
  lights, or to have her visitor shown out? And what of her dinner hour?"</p>

  <p>"She never takes meals in the old way," replied Curtis hurriedly. "Just
  something on a tray&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. Too many glasses of wine."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Sacret drove her to it, and kept her supplied, on the sly, nasty
  stuff, the master said it was&mdash;and then when she was openly shamed in
  court about sleeping through the master's illness, she felt it didn't matter
  any more."</p>

  <p>The two women were whispering in so low a tone they could hardly hear one
  another's words.</p>

  <p>"Where are they&mdash;your mistress and her visitor?"</p>

  <p>"In the room opposite." Curtis had opened the door and nodded across the
  wide corridor. "I've only one maid and a cleaner to help me&mdash;they are
  both out now, so we're alone."</p>

  <p>"Alone? But there is your mistress and her visitor."</p>

  <p>Curtis crossed the passage and looked into the room where more than an
  hour previously she had shown in the man who had given the name of David
  Arrow.</p>

  <p>It was empty, the side curtains were not drawn, the blind not lowered, the
  sash was raised and the steady breeze blew the short muslin curtain, a trail
  of white, into the shadows&mdash;where an empty chair was drawn up close to
  an empty settee.</p>

  <p>"He must have gone very quietly," remarked Mrs. George Rue, still
  whispering low. "I never heard a step&mdash;even across the corridor there,
  and I was sitting quietly waiting."</p>

  <p>"He was a soft-moving sort of man. My mistress couldn't have rung her
  bell."</p>

  <p>"And she must have gone out&mdash;or gone upstairs noiselessly."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't go out, so late, without telling me of her intention, and no
  hat or mantle. She was timid without the carriage, and alone. I always went
  with her&mdash;so late, too," muttered Curtis, whose look had altered to one
  wild and livid beneath the small gaslight of the bracket lamp in the passage.
  Mrs. George Rue peered at her with purblind glance.</p>

  <p>"I shall go up and find her, Curtis. I suppose she has the same
  bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;next to the master's&mdash;she said that she couldn't expect to
  be spared that."</p>

  <p>Curtis was in the empty room, closing the window, pulling down the blind,
  putting away the bottle of wine in the mahogany side-board, heavy and grim as
  the sarcophagus that filled one wall space.</p>

  <p>With the soiled glass she had picked up in her hand, she returned to the
  corridor. Mrs. George Rue was halfway up the first flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>She was walking with difficulty, clumsily trying to support herself on her
  stick and by holding onto the stout balusters. The air seemed dark and cold
  for all the summer season and the gaslight, and Curtis had some ill-timed
  thoughts she could not herself interpret as she stared at the unwieldy figure
  in the worn and lusterless crape and bombazine ascending the comfortable
  stairs as if she struggled against some formidable obstacle.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had a tranquil mind, this long while," said Curtis, staring
  into the glass she held, in which lay a drop of tawny wine. She heard Mrs.
  George Rue calling to her in a croaking voice.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather that you came up, too, Curtis, it is rash of me, going up like
  this, by myself, after what has been between us&mdash;she won't know I'm
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She won't know that anyone is here."</p>

  <p>"Do come. And don't pause. Here we are, listening and waiting again. I
  don't know why I waited so long."</p>

  <p>"She had a cheerful nature, full of hope, and gay," said Curtis. "You'd
  wonder how things would go so wrong for one like that; kind, too."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best to make amends, only come up with me now, Curtis&mdash;I
  suppose there is no one else up there?"</p>

  <p>"No one." She ascended the easy, shallow treads, holding the glass
  slackly, so that the drop of wine fell out and was lost in the thick
  carpet.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that I'd come up these stairs again," whispered Mrs.
  George Rue, giving Curtis her stick and leaning on the servant's arm. "Not
  that I ever was here often&mdash;only in the visiting rooms, on the ground
  floor."</p>

  <p>They paused on the first landing, in the angle before them were two doors,
  Curtis turned to that on the left and opened it carefully. They had only the
  light that came up the stairs in a flickering glow and into this the open
  door sent a dusky dimness, for Susan's bedroom was dark.</p>

  <p>The two women waited on the threshold, listening, as if expecting a
  summons to enter.</p>

  <p>"You speak, ma'am," whispered Curtis at last. "She'll be drowsy, or
  asleep."</p>

  <p>The widow moved her twisted mouth unsteadily, the word "Susan" came as
  faint as an echo, in the half shadow her black figure was shapeless and
  blended with the dull gray of the servant's dress, broken by the hard white
  of apron, bib and cap.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why we don't go in," added Mrs. George Rue. "It's not
  <i>her</i> fault if she's drunk too much. <i>I</i> don't object to seeing her
  like that; in fact, I'll sit with her while you make a little beef
  tea&mdash;yes, that is it, Curtis, a little beef tea. I suppose you have it
  in the house."</p>

  <p>"We need a light," whispered the servant. "She always has lamps in these
  rooms. She doesn't like gas for the smell and the hissing."</p>

  <p>"Lights, you keep talking of lights, why didn't you bring one up?"</p>

  <p>"I've matches in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"Strike one then."</p>

  <p>"Come over the threshold, then."</p>

  <p>The two women, who seemed one darker shadow among the shadows of the large
  room, moved together; they faced the window. The curtains were undrawn and a
  square of pale sky showed against what was the blurred outline of the
  ill-grown trees in the suburban garden.</p>

  <p>"It's empty," muttered Mrs. George Rue. "This room is also empty. She must
  have gone away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Curtis, after some fumbling, struck a match, the flame darted up, showing,
  first, the reflection of the two women in the oval mirror on the
  muslin-draped dressing table, so that they stared at themselves, lit by
  flame&mdash;lined, drab and ugly faces seemed those two countenances, one
  under the widow's cap, one the servant's cap. Each thought the other ghastly
  and colorless, and each drew apart from her companion as the match flared
  out, and Curtis dropped the charred stick where she had, unknowing what she
  did, dropped the glass, by the side of the lone, unruffled bed, where the
  yellow satin quilt was spread neatly beneath the lace flounces that Curtis
  herself had set in order that morning.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue felt her way around the foot of the bed, holding onto the
  massive brass rails that shone in the gleam of the second match that Curtis
  struck.</p>

  <p>"Here she is&mdash;on the floor&mdash;huddled up." The widow put her hand
  to her forehead, and peered around the room as if something had altered
  there. "Don't let the match go out, now don't&mdash;I saw a lamp. We must get
  her into bed."</p>

  <p>"That's easy&mdash;she's so wasted that a child could lift her."</p>

  <p>Curtis had lit the side table lamp, mechanically deft again at the routine
  work that had always been her care.</p>

  <p>"If you'll please to allow me to come, ma'am, I'll know what to
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I want her to speak to me," stammered the widow, standing at the feet
  of the motionless, prostrate figure. "She must speak to me. I want to tell
  her that I know she is a good woman. I want her to forgive me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take your stick," commanded the servant, unhooking the crook from her
  arm&mdash;"a queer old stick it is&mdash;and leave go of the bedstead rails,
  ma'am, and allow me to come around."</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue obeyed, stumbling over something on the floor. "It is the
  master's Indian basket," said Curtis. "I thought they had taken that away.
  And all the contents scattered about."</p>

  <p>"Bottles&mdash;and a nasty, thick smell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold the lamp, bring it nearer," Curtis was on her knees beside her
  mistress, "hold it nearer&mdash;lower, so. Yes, of course, I knew it awhile
  ago&mdash;when we stopped talking and the house was so silent. She's
  dead."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch56"
     id="ch56"></a>§ 56</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret read of the death of Susan Rue in the <i>Morning
  Post</i> and felt a gnawing resentment against a fool who had cheated herself
  and cheated others of so many pleasant things. How many benefits it had been
  in her power to confer on Olivia Sacret, who had taken so much trouble with
  her dull and sordid affairs&mdash;the missionary's widow could but with dire
  difficulty contain her passion when she considered, as she could not evade
  considering, what she had missed. The case was an exasperating puzzle also.
  There had been an inquest and the verdict had been "death by misadventure,"
  and this on the evidence of Dr. Virtue, Mrs. George Rue and Curtis, three
  people much disliked by Olivia Sacret.</p>

  <p>The tale ran smoothly. After her shocking misfortunes Mrs. Martin Rue had
  been given a sleeping draught and one night, obviously afflicted by an access
  of sleeplessness, had taken an overdose having, by a fatal chance, found
  where the supply of the medicine, entrusted to her ever-constant maid, was
  kept, and thinking it to be a harmless tonic, which she also took. Dr.
  Virtue's opinion was against the theory of suicide. His patient was occupied
  with plans for the future, was young, healthy, not in the least melancholy
  and had made a surprising recovery from the tragedy of her husband's death;
  this evidence was supported by Mrs. George Rue, who had been in the house at
  the time of her daughter-in-law's death, by Curtis, by the other women
  employed in the Old Priory, by several acquaintances.</p>

  <p>Public feeling had run strongly against Susan Rue, but now there was a
  general delicacy in dealing with her character that exasperated Mrs. Sacret.
  She did not understand the sentiment that had moved not only Dr. Virtue and
  Mrs. George Rue, but even the coroner and the jury, one of compassion toward
  a woman who, somehow, by some means, had been hunted to her death. Innocent
  or guilty, foolish or wise, she had, either deliberately or by mischance,
  passed from mortal judgment and even those who relished this sinister
  addition to what the evening papers still termed "The Clapham Mystery" spoke
  with reserve of Susan Rue, while among the many who had pressed into the
  crowd to see her shamed in the witness box were some who remembered that she
  was gentle and pretty.</p>

  <p>But to Olivia Sacret she was, even in her grave, an object of contempt,
  and it was with a moody curiosity that the missionary's widow considered this
  dead fool. Susan had been too kindly treated, even by the coroner's verdict,
  for it was obvious, Mrs. Sacret thought contemptuously, that Martin Rue's
  widow had taken her own life, from motives of remorse and when fuddled with
  wine. She supposed that she drove <i>him</i> to self-destruction. Mrs. Sacret
  was in dim argument with herself, pursuing an intricate debate beneath the
  outward apathy imposed by her misfortune. A pity she did not know that she
  <i>did</i> murder him&mdash;how much unnecessary trouble I took over
  that&mdash;putting the glass into her hand, so careful, and she never
  remembered and the point was never raised&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret tried to get some consolation for herself out of the end of
  Susan. At least she, Olivia Sacret, was out of danger, that particular danger
  that had been so terrible, that now she could not recall the agony it had
  caused, only the lone fact that she had been in peril and that of the most
  horrible kind&mdash;peril of&mdash;she would not consider that. No one would
  now disturb the story of Martin Rue and his wife. Very few would even be
  concerned with doing so. There was Sir John, but he was abroad and the
  missionary's widow did not doubt that he would remain there, having so great
  a care for his reputation as to perjure himself on oath. Perhaps the death of
  Susan would even be a relief to him. Mrs. Sacret decided that she must
  dismiss this wealthy, stupid man from her schemes. She could no longer
  frighten him, even if she knew' where to find him. Her prospects were remote
  and doubtful, and these words, used in her icy brooding, lit their
  bleakness&mdash;"where to find him&mdash;" She had no clue as to the
  whereabouts of the painter, she did not know where to find him.</p>

  <p>Australia, Africa, Asia&mdash;she considered the small manuals of
  geography she had learned her set lessons from at school, she remembered the
  colored maps, bound tightly into the text, and how she had, so often, done
  Susan's lessons for her. And then she thought of something else from a lesson
  book, the perfect housewife, Madame Dupont, who conversed in easy French
  about tables and chairs, luncheons and dinners, and how that name had been
  taken for her by the painter on the strange visit to the country when she had
  worn the green and crimson dress. That was needless, too, like giving Susan
  the glass of water&mdash;with the medicine&mdash;I wonder why he troubled?
  Why did he paint those figures for me to see?</p>

  <p>She had been abandoned by all, even by hope, when this livid brightness
  had come her way. No, that was not so, first there had been Susan and the
  luxuries she had obtained from Susan and the sense of power she had employed
  over Susan and Susan's husband. And this reflection brought her to the
  letters. She rejoiced, as far as any manner of rejoicing was any longer
  possible to her, that the letters were now useless to the painter unless he
  ferreted out Sir John and obtained some hush money there.</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow became exasperated in a blind, fumbling fashion as
  this possibility further darkened her cloudy musings.</p>

  <p>He had robbed her&mdash;of money, of the diamond bracelet, of her
  trunks.</p>

  <p>She could not outwardly raise a hue and cry after the first losses, but
  possibly she might do so about the trunks. Yes, there had been a definite
  theft, and one she could denounce to the police.</p>

  <p>Yes, that was it, the detestable Curtis had declared that the
  police&mdash;she had even named one, Sergeant Precious&mdash;or had that been
  Mr. Southey?&mdash;had spoken of the trunks. At this bitter leaping into her
  mind of the name of the lawyer, Mrs. Sacret rose and paced her narrow room.
  How he had fooled her, with his pretense of stupidity&mdash;how treacherous
  he had been, taking a fee for defending her interests, then warning Susan
  about her so that Susan was no longer in dread of the letters.</p>

  <p>However, she need not consider him any more, he had gone out of her life,
  as had a number of other hateful people, with the death of Susan.</p>

  <p>She tried to steady her thoughts. What good would it do her, what use
  would it be to her, to lodge a complaint with the police that her tenant had
  stolen her trunks?</p>

  <p>They knew that already and that the painter was a criminal who had escaped
  to Australia. They had even traced one of the dresses, once in the trunks, to
  a slum hussy of the neighborhood, the slut who had deceived Olivia Sacret,
  one rainy night, into fancying&mdash;she who was so little prone to
  fancy!&mdash;that she saw her own double, the phantom of Madame Dupont, the
  phantom of that happy day in the country, before her. Yes, the police had
  shown that fine, rare dress to Curtis, who had recognized it&mdash;why had
  they not come to her, the respectable missionary's widow, who was the lawful
  owner of it?</p>

  <p>Perhaps they were waiting for her to claim it&mdash;and there were the
  other articles as well, all that Susan had given her, clothes,
  trinkets&mdash;valuable things, worth money. How was it, she asked herself
  fiercely, that she had not thought of this before?</p>

  <p>Of course the police were waiting for her to claim her property. They must
  consider it odd that she had not yet done so. But she could tell a good tale
  to account for her delay. She had had so many agitations and then the
  dreadful death of her dearest friend, she could make that last use of Susan,
  yes, she could say that the sudden death of Susan had made her ill. And
  surely, when she had told her story, she would receive, delivered at her home
  in Minton Street, those handsome, hair-covered, brass-studded trunks that it
  had given her such pleasure to own.</p>

  <p>Her spirits lighted a little at the prospect of opening these trunks and
  turning over the plunder that was all that she had left of the adventure that
  had begun with her visit to the Old Priory.</p>

  <p>She paused to puzzle over how the police had traced and recovered her
  possessions&mdash;the painter must have absconded, leaving his plunder
  behind, and here was another acrid bewilderment, how had he contrived to
  sneak away? Certainly he had had her money&mdash;how merciless, in its power
  to torment, was that thought&mdash;but as the police had traced him as far as
  Liverpool, how was it that they had not traced him farther?</p>

  <p>She was as ignorant of such criminal and legal matters as she had been
  when she had returned from Jamaica, speaking the idiom of a missionary's
  widow, seeking for pious work at a small wage. Her experiences at the Old
  Priory had not enlarged her experiences of mankind; all the people with whom
  she had dealt, while under the influence of a mind that had dominated her
  own, were no longer of any interest to her, they had all been so foolish and
  so little had she gained from any of them that they had vanished from her
  speculations. Only the painter still teased her baffled thoughts.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, even these mean daydreams were a luxury. She must find some
  livelihood and she must get away from Minton Street.</p>

  <p>She considered putting an advertisement in the papers offering to go
  abroad, anywhere, as companion, as lady's maid&mdash;surely some of her
  one-time chapel acquaintances would give her testimonials? On the surface her
  life at the Old Priory appeared without reproach; she forgot the notoriety
  attaching to "the Clapham Mystery" and the terrible suspicion that had once
  been cast on her, if only in a passing, a glancing manner. She knew no one so
  was not aware of her reputation, her neighbors had always been curious and
  hostile and she, now, as always, ignored their stares, grins and muttered
  comments.</p>

  <p>With a restless hope of finding some of what she termed her "stolen
  property," Olivia Sacret turned over the shabby contents of her shabby little
  house.</p>

  <p>But the painter had left nothing behind except Frederick Sacret's poor
  furnishings, save the worn trunk that he had used as a model's throne.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret wished that she could have this removed, as it reminded her so
  unpleasantly of the smart, new luggage of which she had been robbed. She
  looked at the old trunk again. It was well made and still stout, but rubbed
  and dirty outside, and within lined with a cheap stained replacement of the
  original lining&mdash;wallpaper with pink roses and green birds on a blue
  trellis. She tore some of this soiled lining away to see if any object of
  value&mdash;some papers or little articles of jewelry&mdash;was beneath, and
  found nothing.</p>

  <p>His story she now saw as sordid as she had once seen it
  brilliant&mdash;but she could not imagine either the squalor or the
  brilliancy; his figure had always stood out against darkness.</p>

  <p>As she stood discontented and irresolute, a rap on the door startled her,
  and jostling fancies disturbed her puzzled, random thoughts. In a second of
  time she had pictured the painter, Susan, her late husband and Mr. Southey as
  tapping at her door. Her blank gaze turning to the window, she saw above the
  scrap of soiled muslin curtain a carriage stayed at the curb before her home.
  The rap was repeated and she had some intention of not answering this
  summons, yet went to open the door to Mrs. George Rue.</p>

  <p>At sight of this adversary, her undefined fears vanished and her spirits
  were lifted. Here was someone whom she could easily master, on whom she could
  exercise her swelling malice.</p>

  <p>With her pleasant voice lowered, she asked her visitor into the front
  parlor. The elder widow was helping herself awkwardly with her stick and sank
  clumsily, without an invitation, into the beehive chair by the empty
  hearth.</p>

  <p>"Now, what can you and I have to say to one another?" asked Mrs. Sacret
  demurely.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think very little, and that not kind. But I come in a
  friendly way."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow stood silent, sly and suspicious, with folded hands
  and downcast lids.</p>

  <p>"We met in a chance medley and never understood one another, I daresay.
  But I've come to see things differently&mdash;I was reconciled with poor,
  dear Susan before she died, and she told me what a good friend you had been
  to her."</p>

  <p>So, thought Olivia Sacret, not changing her attitude, the fool was afraid
  of me&mdash;to the end. I suppose she was never sure if I had the letters or
  not.</p>

  <p>"I made a mistake," continued Mrs. George Rue. "Susan was light and silly,
  but she was a good woman, and she died of a broken heart because of my poor
  boy&mdash;and I'm sorry if I seemed to dislike her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If!" smiled Mrs. Sacret. "You were her worst enemy."</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, now pray don't&mdash;and as for those two horrid
  inquests&mdash;who knew what was twisted out of them by those cunning
  lawyers. We ought to forget all that&mdash;as if it had never happened. It is
  a closed chapter&mdash;my poor boy and Susan."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret thought it wise to agree with this, and bowed her comely head
  in assent.</p>

  <p>"But we're alive, Mrs. Sacret, and have to be accounted for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By whom&mdash;accounted for</p>

  <p>"That was an odd way of speaking, I know. I am not clever, like you. I'm
  old, also, an old woman, and quite bereaved and alone now. I've only one
  object left in life&mdash;to see justice done."</p>

  <p>"Justice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My mind has been tossed. But I do dwell on that and what I can do. I
  want to make some amends to poor Susan. I think of my son, too, of course.
  Well, Mrs. Sacret, you'll wonder how this comes to concern you. I have a
  proposal. I see you made nothing out of your residence at the Old Priory. I
  hear that you were even robbed of your luggage. I am sure that your health
  must have been undermined&mdash;have you any plans?"</p>

  <p>"You know," replied Mrs. Sacret, "exactly my position and what my plans
  are likely to be."</p>

  <p>"A very sensible answer. Very well, then. I propose that you come and live
  with me, at Blackheath, as a companion. It will be a retired existence, as I
  am in deep mourning&mdash;and always must be&mdash;but I shall see you
  provided for."</p>

  <p>She had a leaden look on her swollen face and a hurry in her voice, a
  tremble in her sagging lips and in her shapeless hands that proved she
  struggled with a formidable emotion. Mrs. Sacret recognized this, though she
  could not understand this excess of feeling. She had respected Mrs. George
  Rue as a worthy enemy&mdash;was it possible that she was only another
  sentimental fool, that she really thought Susan a good woman and sorrowed
  over her? If she was not moved by that sentiment, what did oppress her?</p>

  <p>"Come," urged the old woman. "I see you doubt me&mdash;and I don't
  wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must recall what you said to me&mdash;you thought I had a hold over
  Susan."</p>

  <p>"A wicked thought," sighed Mrs. George Rue. "But don't make up your mind
  in a hurry. Curtis is in my service now. She is outside in the
  carriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Curtis was always insolent to me."</p>

  <p>"She won't be any longer. She, too, sees things differently." The old
  woman continued to talk, pressing the missionary's widow to come and live
  with her&mdash;for awhile at least&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret despised-her and the servant. How much cleverer she was than
  either of them! Susan, frightened Susan, must have lied on her
  deathbed&mdash;the details of which were quite unknown to the missionary's
  widow&mdash;and her mother-in-law and the maid were really actuated by some
  sickly remorse: What other motive could be lurking in this surprising
  proposal?</p>

  <p>Olivia could not see any reason to refuse the offer of a comfortable home,
  even with a detestable old woman in a dull household. It was a most
  unexpected chance to escape from Minton Street and to enjoy again the
  luxuries to which she had been accustomed at the Old Priory. It was also
  agreeable to have that impudent enemy Curtis, at what the missionary's widow
  termed to herself&mdash;"her beck and call."<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>She secretly scorned foolish old Mrs. Rue for taking into her
  service&mdash;evidently as a gesture of much belated remorse&mdash;this
  stiff, disagreeable servant, and considered Curtis herself with equal
  contempt for accepting what was, after all, a not very well-paid or desirable
  situation. For Curtis, who had become a confidential maid, even more, an
  actual confidante, at Clapham, was, Olivia soon found, no more than a buffer
  between servants and mistress at Blackheath. Indeed, Mrs.</p>

  <p>George Rue had an adequate staff and a well-run establishment, and she had
  had "to make a place" for Curtis, to whose lot fell all the odds and ends of
  labor that the others evaded or disliked. Mrs. Sacret took good care to put
  as many tiresome jobs as possible on the woman whom she had never forgiven
  for her insolent and public outspokenness, and it gave her considerable
  pleasure to set the maid mending, ironing or running errands at some
  inconvenient time.</p>

  <p>One warm, early autumn day when she noticed that Curtis, who had just
  brought a pile of hemstitched mull handkerchiefs to the room, looked haggard
  and flushed, Mrs. Sacret laughed in her face, remarking, "I wonder you stay
  here, with two mistresses to order you about&mdash;and both of them ladies
  you used to dislike."</p>

  <p>"I can't choose," replied the gray servant sullenly.</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose you can't&mdash;you're getting past your work, and can't
  have much of a character&mdash;even if Mrs. Martin Rue had lived to write you
  a testimonial, it wouldn't have been any use to you, coming from
  her&mdash;whose reputation had been so blown on. Indeed, I suppose you were
  lucky in getting into service here&mdash;it is quite comfortable&mdash;though
  as Mrs. George Rue has inherited all her son's money she might have some more
  luxuries and run things in a better style."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know about that, ma'am," replied Curtis, smoothing the
  fine handkerchiefs into place.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't suppose you do, or I either," mocked Mrs. Sacret, who spoke
  to the servant for sheer need of speaking to someone who had in any way
  shared her experiences. She was lonely, and though she tried not to be idle,
  she had no definite, important task to keep her from boredom. "A pity that
  your late mistress did not leave you something in her will&mdash;what a
  careless person she was&mdash;dying intestate, and all her fortune going to
  distant relations she had not even seen."</p>

  <p>Curtis was silent. She never had anything to say when the missionary's
  widow goaded her on the subject of Susan's death.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well!" Olivia Sacret affected a yawn. "It is really very odd that we
  three should be together in this dull way&mdash;after all the fuss and
  crying, crazy invalids, sudden deaths and inquests, illicit lovers and scenes
  of passion! And now we are all so very respectable and nothing ever happens
  that is in the least exciting."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any more excitements like we had at the Old Priory,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. How stupid you are. You always tried to get above your
  station. Give me those handkerchiefs, they are not very well done, you might
  take more care&mdash;idle as you are."</p>

  <p>"My sight isn't as good as it was. I must get stronger glasses."</p>

  <p>"Yes, pray do." Mrs. Sacret yawned again and turned her back on the
  servant as she left the room.</p>

  <p>Old Mrs. George Rue was really besotted, the missionary's widow mused, to
  take on both herself, as companion, who-hardly tried to be useful, and
  Curtis, a needless servant, who spent most of her time waiting on a
  dependent. How odd that such a firm seeming character should prove to be
  foolish and sentimental!</p>

  <p>She gave Olivia Sacret a generous allowance and a great deal of freedom,
  as well as continually offering her quite valuable presents and showing some
  concern as to her future. She had promised to leave her "comfortably off,"
  but constantly declared that she would like to see Susan's best&mdash;perhaps
  her only friend&mdash;"settled in life."</p>

  <p>But Olivia Sacret, who had the excuse of her sacred grief, avoided her
  company. She felt very wary, very cautious; her cold, lazy and aggressive
  nature did not crave for homely joys. Certainly she did not intend to remain
  very long at the Cedars, Blackheath, but she considered remaining for the
  lifetime of Mrs. George Rue. The old lady's own physician, Dr. Balance, and
  Dr. Virtue&mdash;who had been taken into her confidence&mdash;had both
  remarked, in Olivia Sacret's hearing, that her heart was "not good," that she
  had suffered more than might have appeared from the shock of her son's death,
  and the rigorous part she had played in the two inquests, and that she "ought
  to be made comfortable and not worried."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret had learned from this that the old woman might die quite soon,
  and so it was worth her while to play a waiting game.</p>

  <p>She had missed the small annuity that Susan had promised. Mr. Southey
  might have paid it, but Olivia Sacret thought it wiser to let him alone. She
  had not been successful in obtaining her trunks and the valuables they
  contained from the police, though Mrs. George Rue had helped her in this
  delicate matter, and Sergeant Precious had himself called at the Cedars.</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow thought him a stupid man. He had such a slow manner
  of speaking, such a blank look and such a square, expressionless face that,
  from the first moment of glancing at him, she lost her hidden thrill of
  terror that he might ask perilous questions, and she said she was not sure of
  the dates in the matter of the removal of the trunks from Minton Street.</p>

  <p>But Sergeant Precious had raised no difficulties. He had even commiserated
  with her on being deceived by the smooth-tongued rogue who had been her
  tenant and added that it was "no wonder," since the man, under various
  aliases, had been guilty of several most skillful frauds.</p>

  <p>"I saw him very seldom," Olivia Sacret had considered it wise to say, and
  Sergeant Precious had answered that she was fortunate in having so little to
  do with so dangerous a rascal, adding&mdash;"not but a lady like yourself
  would have seen through him, it was only those poor, silly, common creatures
  he deceived."</p>

  <p>"But you said he was clever at deception?"</p>

  <p>"In a large way, yes&mdash;but I am thinking of the women, ma'am. He never
  did anything there with anyone of your class."</p>

  <p>This had been comfortable hearing to Olivia Sacret, but had increased her
  contempt of the detective&mdash;how could such as he judge of the fascination
  of the painter? How dare he judge women? What they wanted, what they
  liked?</p>

  <p>The police had proved incompetent, and not only in their estimate of the
  relations between Mrs. Sacret and her tenant. They had not been able to trace
  the man beyond Liverpool, where he had been shadowed to the quay, and there
  lost sight of, and they had not found the stolen luggage, nor any of the
  pretty things Susan had given to her friend. Mrs. Sacret could not but
  confess her relief to herself that this heavy curtain had fallen over her
  episode with the painter, but nevertheless she despised the police, and
  through them, the law. This contempt set her much at ease, it was as if she
  had been afraid&mdash;so miserably afraid&mdash;of what was not really
  terrible, but feeble and stupid. She had asked Sergeant Precious how it was
  that the police had been tracking her tenant before they knew of his theft of
  her goods, and the answer had been&mdash;because of another crime committed
  some time ago&mdash;"as we often do, Mrs. Sacret, long after the criminal
  thinks we have forgotten him. Indeed we sometimes give him a long
  rope&mdash;a sense of security, if you understand me&mdash;so that he shall
  betray himself in the end."</p>

  <p>Olivia Sacret had thought this grandiose nonsense, spoken to cover up
  incompetency, and the sentence came back to her now, as she sat at the
  window, after her acrid interview with Curtis, looking at the sunset sky, the
  color of flame about the dark, alien trees that gave the house its name.</p>

  <p>How she had longed to ask what had been the record of the painter, what
  the police knew of him, for what crime he was being pursued&mdash;and with
  what force this longing returned to her now, making her loneliness vivid!</p>

  <p>Yet what did it matter? It was clear enough that he was a vulgar
  adventurer who had lived by frauds on women. He had marked her down as a
  simple chapel woman with a rich friend after, no doubt, minute inquiries at
  places of which she knew nothing&mdash;such as the local public houses, but
  where she and her neighbors and her affairs would be very well known. What
  luck it had been for him to discover that she owed her money
  to&mdash;blackmail.</p>

  <p>Even now her thought checked at the word; it represented one of the things
  she would not admit, even in her secret thoughts.</p>

  <p>No, she must forget the past and only remember what she had inherited from
  it, the silly, sentimental protection of an odious old woman who had been her
  severe enemy.</p>

  <p>Her choice now lay between a lazy endurance of the comforts of this very
  easy establishment, waiting for Mrs. George Rue to die, and an adventuring
  into the world to see what she could do for herself from the vantage ground
  of the Cedars. She recognized how entirely she was without the spirit of
  adventure, she was inert with spiritual sloth, though she did not give it
  that name.</p>

  <p>She had only gone to Jamaica because she was forced to accompany her
  husband where he could earn his living, she had made nothing of the
  experience and soon forgotten it; the bizarre influence of the painter had
  taken her out of herself as if she had been hypnotized. When that had been
  withdrawn, an instinct of self-preservation had made her alert, watchful,
  energetic. Now she was safe and comfortable, and had no desire to risk any
  peril or inconvenience.</p>

  <p>She intended to go as companion or governess in some really well-placed
  family, or <i>au pair</i> and, well dressed, with plentiful pocket money and
  good introductions, she thought that she could easily enough marry some man
  who would support her in ease for the rest of her life in a gay, sunny,
  amusing city.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue had approved of her plan&mdash;but for the
  future&mdash;"You must stay with me until I die, Olivia"&mdash;and Mrs.
  George Rue would give her introductions both in France and
  Italy&mdash;"Como," Olivia Sacret had once said, "I should like to go to
  Como"&mdash;and then it appeared that the old woman knew the very best and
  most useful people in Lombardy.</p>

  <p>It should not be so difficult to wait, and it would be so much wiser and
  safer to wait, until the last echoes of the "Clapham Mystery" had died away.
  Though the missionary's widow had never realized how notorious she had become
  through the press, she was aware that a lapse of time would be advisable
  before she tried to gain an entry into any society where she would be likely
  to find the kind of husband she desired. Yet how dull this life&mdash;this
  waiting&mdash;would the old woman die soon? How much would she leave her,
  Olivia Sacret, to make her "comfortable"?<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>"I have put in the paper&mdash;the <i>Morning Post</i>&mdash;that you are
  staying with me at the Cedars, dear. I thought that now all that horrid
  scandal is over, it would be nice for you&mdash;to have it known that you
  were staying with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose so. Thank you. Yes, it will be useful." Mrs. Sacret was
  indeed pleased by, if scornful of, this piece of foolishness. Certainly it
  should help her in the future to have been publicly proclaimed as the
  protégée of Mrs. George Rue.</p>

  <p>"It is odd how little I understood you. I always thought of you as rather
  a hard sort of woman. I should never have guessed you would have had these
  sentiments."</p>

  <p>"Sentiments?"</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;taking me to live with you and bothering yourself with
  Curtis, who really looks after me more than anything else. We must, both of
  us, be an added expense to you&mdash;for nothing."</p>

  <p>"I have poor Susan's money&mdash;and it isn't for nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was really your son's money, Mrs. Rue. I think you make too much of
  Susan's action&mdash;She was wealthy enough even after she had given up her
  second husband's fortune."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But she need not have given that money to me," replied the old lady
  obstinately. "It shows she was a good woman."</p>

  <p>It shows that you are senile, thought the other woman, to feel so, to
  allow your pity to overpower your judgment&mdash;and she longed to tell Mrs.
  George Rue that her earlier estimate of her daughter-in-law's character had
  been the correct one, and to recount the story of the letters and how Susan
  and Sir John had both committed perjury.</p>

  <p>But she could not do this; not only would such a bald statement of the
  truth reveal herself as a blackmailer, it would mean the loss of the
  patronage of her employer and with it all she had of ease.</p>

  <p>She could not entirely control a shade of irritation crossing her comely
  face and turned this off by remarking on the heat of the oppressive
  evening.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," agreed Mrs. George Rue. "I think it makes me worse. Dr.
  Balance tries to reassure me and Dr. Virtue is very kind, but I am sure that
  my heart is worse&mdash;sometimes I can hardly breathe. I expect I shall have
  to have a nurse at night."</p>

  <p>"Are you as ill as that?" asked Olivia Sacret shrewdly and quickly.</p>

  <p>"I've never recovered from my son's death and all the shocks and horrors.
  It could not be expected at my age. It killed poor Susan and it will kill
  me."</p>

  <p>Looking aside across the comfortable room, the missionary's widow had the
  other woman's face before her mind, a leaden face, with lilac shadows around
  eyes and lips; a face already like the countenance of the dead; it was true,
  also, that the old woman's breathing was more labored, that she moved ever
  more clumsily, that she had lapses of memory and spoke in a very rambling
  fashion sometimes about the past, when Mrs. Sacret had not known her; it
  might well be that she was not going to live long. The missionary's widow
  felt cheerful at this prospect and was able to throw a warm, sympathetic note
  into her voice, as she expressed her concern as to her employer's health.</p>

  <p>"You must not bother yourself about me, after my son's death I had nothing
  to live for&mdash;save to see justice done. I accomplished that when I took
  you and Curtis to live with me."</p>

  <p>If you like to think so, the better for me, thought Mrs. Sacret
  contemptuously, while she smiled on the old woman, who laid her large, soft
  hand on her companion's knee.</p>

  <p>"I want you to know, my dear, how I am looking after you&mdash;you'll have
  ten thousand pounds and all my jewelry."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow flushed with pleasure; she had never expected any
  such sum as ten thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"Don't thank me&mdash;I've talked too much, there&mdash;give me my
  drops&mdash;on the sideboard there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret found and administered the medicine to the old woman, who
  appeared to her to be sinking into a lethargy. Her heavy lace cap, crowned by
  bows of black ribbon, fell to one side, and the missionary's widow smiled at
  the ridiculous figure the stout, clumsy creature made. She herself felt
  superior, aggressive; rage and triumph mingled in her dark regard&mdash;these
  pampered rich people who had had everything and who were such
  fools&mdash;Susan and Susan's mother-in-law, and Susan's husband, all of
  them&mdash;fools.</p>

  <p>"Your medicine doesn't seem to ease you much," she remarked when Mrs.
  George Rue had gasped down her dose.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I wish I had some of the draughts my son used to make up,"
  murmured the invalid faintly. "He was so clever at that. I suppose you never
  saw his hempen basket at the Old Priory&mdash;before the sale?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. I think the police took it. I wonder that you care to
  mention it," replied Mrs. Sacret, "for it was from that Indian basket he must
  have got the fatal drink."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, antimony killed him&mdash;he must have taken that from the
  stables!" muttered Mrs. George Rue stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, that was the medical evidence, though I don't think the
  doctors knew what they were talking about&mdash;" curiosity prompted Mrs.
  Sacret to add, what now seemed a safe question seeing how feeble and stupid
  her onetime enemy had become&mdash;"How do you really think your son came by
  his end&mdash;if Susan was a good woman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course she was a good woman, that is why I keep you and Curtis,
  out of respect to her memory," muttered the old woman, slightly swaying to
  and fro.</p>

  <p>She is failing, thought the missionary's widow. No doubt she will die very
  suddenly. Ten thousand pounds! I wonder if I can be sure of that.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue continued her thick whispering. "She was foolish and he
  was jealous&mdash;that was all there was to it&mdash;but she was a good
  woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With uncontrollable malice aroused by this senseless repetition "a good
  woman," Olivia Sacret interrupted:</p>

  <p>"How do you know that <i>she&mdash;this good woman</i>&mdash;did not give
  him the poison herself? I did not wish to hear evidence against her, but I
  saw her&mdash;that night&mdash;offer him a glass of <i>something</i> that he
  drank and he was taken ill almost at once. How easy for her to pretend the
  sherry made her drowsy! She never told anyone of that last drink&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"She told me." The old woman's indifferent admission, after a moment's
  silence, surprised Mrs. Sacret considerably. "But she made nothing of it. Oh,
  dear no, she often said, 'I remember giving him a posset,' yes, I think she
  said posset, 'and then I don't remember any more&mdash;and there couldn't
  have been any harm in the posset because it was just a sedative he had often
  had before, that Olivia had brought from Jamaica.'" Mrs. George Rue coughed
  and mumbled. "I remember you told me once about that sedative&mdash;your
  husband's favorite sleeping draught. Wasn't that right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly," replied the missionary's widow coolly. "I often mixed it
  for Susan. I used it myself sometimes, but she could have added something to
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Antimony&mdash;but she never went to the stables?" said Mrs. George Rue
  stupidly.</p>

  <p>"It is a common horse medicine, to be found in any stables," smiled Olivia
  Sacret. "I suppose your good Susan could have spent a day in the
  country."</p>

  <p>"A day in the country?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and slipped away to the stables&mdash;or someone, perhaps Sir
  John, might have given it to her in an envelope&mdash;" Mrs. Sacret checked
  herself, and then was ashamed of her own alarm, for the old woman was
  suddenly asleep. She had heard very little, it seemed, and understood nothing
  of this conversation. She irritated her companion by her stupidity, even
  though this senile dullness was so much to her, Olivia Sacret's, advantage.
  Mrs. Sacret moved slowly to the door and remarked over her shoulder, "She
  <i>might</i> have worn a green and crimson dress and named herself Madame
  Dupont from the schoolbooks&mdash;and taken a day in the country with a
  painter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and glanced with contempt at the gross figure in the shawls and
  scarves, huddled in the winged chair, asleep and snoring, a clumsy outline
  against the screen of dull gold leather, then softly left the room and, at
  her leisure, pulled the drawing room bell and when the maid came, bade her
  send Curtis to her mistress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch57"
     id="ch57"></a>§ 57</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. George Rue showed Olivia Sacret her will. True it was,
  set out clearly&mdash;<i>ten thousand pounds and my jewels to Olivia Sacret,
  the faithful companion of my dear son's late wife during the period of her
  undeserved misfortunes, and one thousand to Emma Curtis.</i></p>

  <p>The missionary's widow considered it wise to accept this bounty meekly and
  gratefully. Though the tribute to Susan irked her, she let it pass. It was
  better, she felt, not to risk any further attempt to blast the dead woman's
  character. Mrs. George Rue was plainly dying and, as plainly, had hardly
  heard what her companion had said on the subject of her son's death and what
  she had heard had utterly forgotten. On this and other matters, she had but
  this one obsession&mdash;reparation to Susan through Olivia Sacret and
  Curtis. Dr. Balance, in frequent attendance at the Cedars, assured Mrs.
  Sacret that her employer's present state "could not last long," and the
  companion kept up a decorous attendance on the invalid, who now no longer
  left her bed, and whose one coherent action during days of wandering memory
  and aimless monologues was to send to her bank for some of her jewels. She
  had the shining leather cases unlocked and the rubies and diamonds laid out
  on her crimson bed quilt.</p>

  <p>"They are far too fine for me," whispered Olivia Sacret with a flashing
  smile.</p>

  <p>Mrs. George Rue muttered that the pieces were very old fashioned, but
  could be reset, and Curtis respectfully replaced the thick bracelets, heavy
  brooches and massive earrings on their pearl-gray silk linings. Olivia Sacret
  could not forbear a thrust at the servant who had once been her public
  enemy.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know how a poor missionary's widow will dispose of such grand
  ornaments," she said, lowering her pleasant voice to a gentle softness.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The evening of the day she had been shown the jewels, Olivia Sacret's
  spirits were so high she could not endure the confinement of the Cedars, so
  silent, so stagnant, with the atmosphere of illness, for a nurse kept guard
  in Mrs. George Rue's chamber, and the domestic staff were shut away behind
  the stout baize-lined doors at the top of the kitchen stairs.</p>

  <p>A heavy, dull house, though comfortable, not suited to her mood and her
  prospects; she had nowhere to go, no possible companion, she reflected that
  probably there was no one in London more isolated than she was, but her mood
  was cheerful.</p>

  <p>She would soon get away, and have power, the power of money, and her own
  strong personality and tested charms. She was the woman of the portrait
  painted in the Minton Street house.</p>

  <p>She stepped into the garden of the Cedars, then into the street, then onto
  the heath. The stars showed faintly in a paling sky. There was a chill in the
  air, she walked rapidly, the blood coming into her cheeks as she held her
  head high to the breeze.</p>

  <p>At first she took no heed of the commonplace figure also enjoying the
  evening air, in the Quaker gray jacket and round hat, who walked some paces
  ahead of her on the rough town grass; then he had fallen into step beside her
  and whispered: "How long you have kept me waiting!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret stood still and smiled. She assured herself that she had been
  really expecting this, she then glided into step beside him and he, with a
  touch on her arm, turned her steps in the direction in which he wished her to
  go.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had left the country&mdash;sailed from Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"I wanted&mdash;<i>them</i>&mdash;to think so. I doubled back and threw
  them off the scent. I've lain quiet for a long time."</p>

  <p>She listened eagerly to this whispered explanation that told her
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Was it worth while&mdash;because of those wretched trunks? Why did you
  take them&mdash;and forsake me? Oh, that dreadful day at the railway
  station!"</p>

  <p>"You cannot suppose that I meant to trick you? I fell in with a
  friend&mdash;became involved in his trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"News of the underworld, eh?"</p>

  <p>"If you like, you always knew where I belonged. I was robbed of some of
  your property that I fetched from the depot for you."</p>

  <p>"I saw the green and crimson dress&mdash;worn by a slut. She gave it to
  the police."</p>

  <p>"But they are on a dead trail. I am quite safe, though I intend to leave
  the country soon, for Italy. And you, are you safe?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret was surprised at this question. "Safe? Oh, everyone has
  forgotten about Martin Rue's death, and Susan's suicide. Besides, I never was
  in danger&mdash;or only for a breath&mdash;why should I be in danger?" She
  laughed and told him of Mrs. George Rue's expiation. "She is dying and will
  leave me ten thousand pounds and her jewelry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sighed, "Why that spoils my plan&mdash;I have your property&mdash;all
  but the few articles stolen from me, and some other money and I have been
  following you&mdash;and waiting for this chance, to ask you to come to Como,
  or Florence, or Paris&mdash;after all."</p>

  <p>He opened a narrow gate in a brick wall and she saw they had reached their
  destination, the disused burial ground of some obscure Christian sect. All
  the headstones were plainly shaped and set in rows, by the far wall stood
  some poplar trees, their upward reaching boughs, on which the leaves still
  fluttered, showed dark against a sunset sky of pale green light.</p>

  <p>"I never knew of this," he murmured. "You'll think I did and came back for
  the money."</p>

  <p>"You could not have known about the will. You knew Mrs. George Rue was
  protecting me."</p>

  <p>He interrupted. "No, how could I be aware of that? I have been combing
  London for you. And sometimes hung about the heath thinking that you might be
  visiting the old woman. I saw you first, a fortnight or so ago, followed you
  and lost you. So seldom you are out alone in the evening. I have had to be
  very patient as well as watchful."</p>

  <p>He spoke more humbly than she had ever known him to speak before and this
  fed her sense of power. She had triumphed not only over the fools, but over
  the clever rogue as well, if rogue and clever he was. She hardly cared now if
  he had robbed and tricked her or not. He had returned to her through no
  effort on her part and was, she considered, at her mercy; she might easily
  denounce him to the police for the theft of her trunks. Probably he was
  wanted for other crimes as well&mdash;but what did that matter? The little
  golden dream had returned to her, she toyed with it&mdash;Italy with this
  entrancing companion at her feet&mdash;or Italy, or any part of the world,
  with her own money and respectable introductions, and the search for a
  respectable husband. Meanwhile, she could not resist boasting. As they paced
  along between the graves in the lessening light, she told him, with zest, of
  how properly she had fooled the absurd old woman who had once been her enemy,
  and how another enemy, the once insolent Curtis, was now at her service.</p>

  <p>"I am weary of hearing her speak of the wretched Susan as a good
  woman&mdash;I even suggested that Susan had given her husband the
  dose&mdash;as, of course, she did&mdash;and suggested she might have been
  given the stuff during a visit to the country when she was named, out of a
  whim, Madame Dupont!"</p>

  <p>"That was rash."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she is senile and understood nothing! And I could not resist the
  temptation to laugh a little&mdash;everything is so dull at the Cedars! Of
  course, I was alone with her&mdash;and I never repeated the jest. Madame
  Dupont, that old schoolbook name is so odd!"</p>

  <p>He pressed her arm.</p>

  <p>"It is certain that we shall not be disturbed here&mdash;no one comes
  here. These dead are truly forgotten forever. But you must not stay away too
  long from the old woman."</p>

  <p>At these words Olivia Sacret felt a stab of terror at the prospect of
  returning to that dull, quiet house.</p>

  <p>"May I know where to find you she asked, trembling.</p>

  <p>"That would not be safe&mdash;nor possible. I am in a different place
  every night."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow sighed, as the chill autumn night breeze blew
  across her face. She would never understand this man, nor his life, nor his
  hiding places. He was a criminal who had robbed her, led her into danger and
  left her. She harshly pulled her arm away from his and began to reproach him
  harshly with mechanical terms of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he replied quietly. "I shall go away. And this time it will
  be forever."</p>

  <p>She was silent, considering these last words; he had remarked of the
  unknown dead about them that they were "truly forgotten, forever." And then
  nothing seemed to matter save that she should keep this precious
  companionship, at least for awhile, and on her own terms&mdash;and it would
  be on her own terms, since she had power over him, the power to bring him
  back to her when she had nothing to offer, for he could not have known of the
  good fortune of which she had so eagerly told him. Thus she reasoned, feebly,
  and soon reason was silenced altogether and the words "truly forgotten,
  forever" echoed in her empty mind, while she returned her arm to the crook of
  his elbow.</p>

  <p>"I will meet you again, and you know it," she whispered. "Here?"</p>

  <p>"No, never the same place twice."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't know how I can manage to see you&mdash;I can't leave the
  house too often."</p>

  <p>"Nor would it be wise to do so. But I want to leave the country soon, and
  you to come with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've little, or nothing, till the old woman dies."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to wait for that?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret did not hesitate in her reply. Though his enchantment held
  her, she would not run the risk of being fooled twice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course&mdash;do you think I can afford to lose that money? And I
  don't promise I'll come with you&mdash;I'll have to ponder over that. I might
  decide to remain respectable and make a good, steady match."</p>

  <p>"You never will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know! You see, I am no longer afraid of you&mdash;I don't
  even know who you are and I am aware that the police are hunting
  you&mdash;but I like you, and I'm quite sure of myself, and I'll meet you,
  just to know more of you and what a strange creature you must be&mdash;or may
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is all I ask. We've a wonderful second chance. I can prove to you
  that I was quite loyal&mdash;and that I'm wanted for no trivial crime."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that will be interesting," she smiled, glowing with the
  consciousness of power; she looked up at him, his face was hidden by the
  shadow of the round Quaker hat, and wondered why she had ever feared him.
  Why, she was like an empress among them all, even this strange creature, once
  so formidable, was under her domination.</p>

  <p>"You must really care for me, love me, perhaps," she remarked coolly.</p>

  <p>"I want you. I have never met anyone like you. I'll marry you, if you
  wish. I am free."</p>

  <p>The missionary's widow, in her self-confidence, laughed that aside. "Oh,
  I've told you, I may be looking for a steadier husband than you would ever
  be! And this time I shall keep my own money."</p>

  <p>"You shall, indeed you shall."</p>

  <p>"I mean to&mdash;now I must return to the Cedars."</p>

  <p>The painter agreed to this prudent resolve and together they left the
  bleak burial ground in the darkened street, after he had whispered to her
  directions as to when and where they should meet again, and how she was to
  communicate with him if she could not keep the appointment.</p>

  <p class="first">It was hardly decorous for Mrs. Sacret to leave her
  employer, who lay in a state of insensibility from which. Dr. Balance said,
  she was not likely to recover, but she was resolved not to break her tryst
  with the painter. She would have liked to have written to him, but was too
  cautious to do so, or to show herself in the small toy and newspaper shop
  where, he had said, letters might be left for him under the name of James
  Prince. She was excited by the different names he used, as by the change in
  him&mdash;how humble, almost imploring he had been in the bare burial
  ground!</p>

  <p>Certainly she was desirable, and her vanity, the cold vanity of an
  unemotional woman, was most agreeably soothed. She fetched out the portrait
  and looked at it long before she set out for the trysting place that was the
  steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. There, he had told her, they would not be
  noticed amid the to-and-froing of the sight-seers and the worshipers. The
  time chosen was three o'clock in the afternoon and the day proved to be fair
  and still.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret dressed herself in her quietest suit of mourning and dropped a
  veil over her face. She told Curtis that she had an appointment with her late
  husband's lawyer over some property in the West Indies and might be late as
  Blackheath was so far from the city. It was a plausible lie, but she felt
  that Curtis did not believe her. The gray woman looked at her so sideways,
  with so clear and chilly a stare.</p>

  <p>"The mistress may be dead before you return, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;I've explained to Dr. Balance. This is an important
  matter to me. Besides, I can do nothing&mdash;Mrs. George Rue doesn't even
  know me, and the nurse doesn't like me in the room&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very well, ma'am, I wish you good luck on your journey&mdash;a long,
  tedious journey, as you say, ma'am," and Curtis smiled as if at some strange
  and secret thought. Mrs. Sacret smiled back.</p>

  <p>"You need not be anxious lest she alter her will, eh? I know that is what
  you are thinking. Oh, she will die in her sleep and you are quite safe!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am, I am quite safe."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch59"
     id="ch59"></a>§ 59</h2>

  <p class="first">The missionary's widow regretted the days of the Old Priory;
  there was no chance of borrowing a carriage from the Cedars, though there
  were two in the stables. She had no "hold" over Mrs. George Rue&mdash;she
  recalled the letters, useless now, unless Sir John would pay to have them
  suppressed. Did the painter still possess them? The word "blackmail" slid
  into her mind, and she reflected on it with astonishment. What had it to do
  with her?</p>

  <p>She traveled by omnibus, changing twice, before she reached the city at
  half-past two o'clock. She had seldom been there and the narrow streets with
  the heavy buildings seemed formidable, and she felt conspicuous as there were
  so few women about, and those few but cleaners or servants from pie shops.
  The press of hurrying men engulfed her and she was hideously reminded of the
  crowd at the railway station when she had run about in a panic looking for a
  man she knew she would not find.</p>

  <p>But as she neared the monstrous cathedral she was less noticeable, as
  there were some women mounting the vast stone steps. She looked at them
  curiously, wondering what their errands might be.</p>

  <p>She paused, looking about her cautiously from behind the black veil,
  moving slowly upwards, hesitating in the great portico, then slowly downwards
  again, so that she mingled with the crowd and was unnoticed, for there were
  other women, three in crape and bombazine, attending, she supposed, some
  service for the dead&mdash;or were they sight-seers who chanced to be in
  mourning? The idle question teased her, as she passed slowly up the steps.
  The weather-beaten façade, so high above her, the curve of the steps,
  affected her unpleasantly as had the long shining perspective of the railway
  lines disappearing from under the roof of the station. People had flowed in
  and out of the monstrous railway station as they flowed in and out of the
  monstrous cathedral.</p>

  <p>In the station they had hurried, here they climbed the steps slowly, but
  in each case they seemed to have reached a destination, to be engulfed in
  crowds and lost. The word "terminus" came into her mind. A word she had but
  rarely used. Here all ends, or rather changes.</p>

  <p>She carefully scanned those about her for the round hat and straight
  jacket of Quaker design. He might have chosen another disguise, but she knew
  his appearance so well that she was sure that she would have detected him in
  any clothes.</p>

  <p>A man in a tweed cape, passing close to her, down the steps of the
  cathedral, did attract her attention. His face was turned from her and he was
  hastening away, but she thought she had seen Sergeant Precious. An odd
  meeting, if that were the policeman, but she made little of it&mdash;he no
  longer represented any danger to her, and he was a likely person to have met
  in any part of London. Standing beside one of the heavy pillars, she viewed
  the people leaving and entering the huge dark building, and considered them
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>She was sure that none of them had been as clever as she had been in
  making something worth while, exciting and important, out of a life that had
  been deprived of all its just rights. How easily everyone had been
  fooled&mdash;even now she was so easily deceiving old Mrs. Rue that it was
  almost tiresome. A fortune would fall into her lap from her enemy, already
  she felt the jewels she would inherit clasping her neck and wrists.</p>

  <p>He was late, surely. She drew out the gold watch that she had forced Susan
  to give her and peered at the time; yes, nearly ten minutes late. The customs
  of her class were strong in her, it would never do for a lady alone to wait
  in a public place, even on the steps of a church. She lowered her veil and
  descended the steps; her thoughts flew wide. Old Mrs. Rue's talk of herself
  and Susan's confidence in her about the drink&mdash;Martin Rue's last drink.
  How strange that two women on such bad terms should have been so
  confidential&mdash;yet all could be accounted for by Susan's folly, she would
  confide anything, even to her enemy. It was lucky that neither of the stupid
  women attached any importance to the incident. Mrs. George Rue with her
  suspicions, her doctors and lawyers, her public denunciations, was almost
  feeble minded, and could not see an inch before her nose.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret passed to the left of the cathedral, along a narrow passage.
  To her right were some dark buildings. She thought they were a school, for
  boys were running in as if late, and there was a general jostle in which she
  felt oppressed, the alien idler. A hand fell on her arm; she looked up into
  the commonplace countenance of Sergeant Precious.</p>

  <p>"I have something to say to you, Mrs. Sacret."</p>

  <p>"Well, this is a strange place to choose!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to make any kind of stir or trouble at the Cedars."</p>

  <p>This seemed a sensible answer and it soothed Mrs. Sacret's faint
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Of course not&mdash;but how did you find me?" It did not occur to her
  that she might have been followed; she was so easy in her mind and
  conscience. Sergeant Precious thought it sufficient to say: "No better place
  than a crowd&mdash;let us get clear of these young gentlemen&mdash;I know a
  little coffeehouse just on Cheapside."</p>

  <p>"I never go to such places&mdash;and I am late already for an
  appointment."</p>

  <p>"Still, you'll come with me," said Sergeant Precious with authority, and
  she thought it wise to follow him quietly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch60"
     id="ch60"></a>§ 60</h2>

  <p class="first">They sat facing one another, on either side of a stained
  table, in a wooden compartment. Mrs Sacret sipped some unpalatable coffee and
  thought of God and Sin, long absent from her calculations, for she had so
  often heard her husband and the chapel people speak with disgust of these
  drinking places. She could not see another woman in the place and became
  restive and indignant as Sergeant Precious drank his beer from the pewter
  tankard.</p>

  <p>But his first words were admirably direct and at once held her
  attention.</p>

  <p>"The police have been tracing a very clever criminal for a weary time. It
  would be to your interest to help them."</p>

  <p>"Blackmail"&mdash;the word seemed written in the air between
  them&mdash;how much did the police know? Mrs. Sacret sent her mind racing
  after probabilities, possibilities&mdash;she had forgotten so much herself
  and, worse, had become confused.</p>

  <p>"I don't know a criminal."</p>

  <p>"Mark Bellis was the name he gave you. And there is no
  time&mdash;literally no time&mdash;for words. I'm giving you a warning. He's
  after you because of the money Mrs. Rue is leaving you."</p>

  <p>"He did not know that&mdash;" she began, when Sergeant Precious gently
  interrupted her. "That gives you away, don't it, ma'am? It was in the
  paper&mdash;about a rich woman adopting you. <i>He</i> saw that. He is
  slippery, and may get away again. A number of confederates, also. Well, you
  deliver him to us, and we'll let you go&mdash;if you leave the country
  quickly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It has all been there for you to see, all the time. He's a murderer,
  maybe insane. Very low kind of scoundrel, from the foundling home, then at
  sea. He killed an old man and his housekeeper for their savings and got away.
  Clever, plausible. We have got the story pretty well put together."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>my</i> story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do keep your voice low, ma'am, whispering, like I do&mdash;I shan't be a
  minute. While he was being searched for in France and Italy&mdash;where he
  had been, mind you, he doubled back, under our noses in another disguise. He
  knows where the antimony came from and so do you. But that is over, if you
  choose."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," murmured Mrs. Sacret, pressing her clasped hands into her
  veiled face.</p>

  <p>"Only if you choose Blackmail and murder if you like&mdash;accessory also
  to these other crimes, if you persist in concealing him now."</p>

  <p>"You can't find him." She felt a sudden delight in the painter's
  cleverness, yet she had already decided to betray him to insure her own
  safety. She dared not now, in this public place, speculate on what the police
  knew.</p>

  <p>"No. We traced him to meetings with you&mdash;twice&mdash;but he
  escaped&mdash;always a cab to jump into&mdash;he keeps several horses. A
  hundred years ago they would have said he had a familiar or was himself a
  limb of Satan."</p>

  <p>"How did you begin to connect him with me</p>

  <p>"The woman Feathers and the dress you wore when he took you to the
  country. A freakish thing to do; he wanted to fetch the stuff&mdash;but why
  do it that way Sergeant Precious touched his head as if to denote something
  deranged in the criminal's brain.</p>

  <p>"He is cleverer than you," said Mrs. Sacret, putting her thoughts into
  words.</p>

  <p>"And than you. Don't think he'll ever go abroad with you&mdash;he'll strip
  you and slip away."</p>

  <p>"He has already done that&mdash;and now I'm&mdash;" she checked herself,
  laughed and added. "Yes, the second time. My life is so dull and no one ever
  cared for me, he was really interested. Can't you let us alone?"</p>

  <p>"I told you he was a murderer."</p>

  <p>"So you did. I don't suppose it is proved. The old, ugly, tedious people.
  He is a very clever painter." She rose. "Don't think I am going to meet him
  now, I came up to London on legal business and had a curiosity to visit the
  cathedral. I am Church of England again."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting, ma'am." Sergeant Precious also rose, placing the money
  due on the table. "I think you meant to meet him and something scared him
  from coming. So seeing you waiting, I decided to talk to you. We've waited
  long enough."</p>

  <p>"I am returning at once to the Cedars," said Mrs. Sacret, "in a fly."</p>

  <p>"No doubt&mdash;but remember you must give him up. He is hidden, but you
  are not. No more grace, the case is complete."</p>

  <p>"What am Ito do?"</p>

  <p>"Play your part a little longer, then make a tryst with him&mdash;and
  inform us." He handed her a square of paper. "At that address. Otherwise the
  Martin Rue case will be reopened for the second time. Now, pray leave this
  place by yourself in case some of his spies are about, though I had
  everything well watched."</p>

  <p>Fear for herself made her say&mdash;"I don't know where he lives&mdash;I
  have to wait until he communicates with me."</p>

  <p>"He will, because of the money; now you've been there long enough,
  ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Don't blame me if I fail." She slipped the pasteboard into her bosom,
  behind the crape ruffles&mdash;She must be careful it was not seen at the
  Cedars where she still had to play her part.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch61"
     id="ch61"></a>§ 61</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Sacret was extraordinarily tired, only the sense of her
  own cleverness kept her alert. The situation was, she felt, confusing. The
  police on their track after such a long period of security was an ugly fact
  difficult to realize. Yet she could not judge the extent of the knowledge
  held by Sergeant Precious and she was hardly down Ludgate Hill before the
  interview with him in the coffeehouse seemed as unreal as that visit to the
  country mansion where she had been Madame Dupont. She could nor find a
  hackney driver who would take her to Blackheath and she had lost the station.
  She wandered in a strange city where, with what seemed astonishing rapidity,
  darkness closed on the streets and the lamplighters made their rounds,
  jerking the gas jets into luminous globes.</p>

  <p>She would have to obey the police and betray him. She settled the card
  more securely inside her stiff bodice, behind the whaleboned corsage. But his
  fascination for her was not altered. It had been a falsehood about the
  murders, of course, told merely to shock her into fearful submission.
  Murders? Her mind echoed the word and joined it with the death of Martin Rue,
  with the death of Susan, then jolted on again. She knew nothing of that, no
  one could prove anything. No one. Suicide in each case. The police offered no
  reward. Where would she be when she had delivered the painter to them? Free
  to leave the country&mdash;penniless and alone. She sighed bitterly, thinking
  how differently she had dreamed it all. But there was the dying old woman and
  her money; surely she, the brilliant, astute Olivia Sacret could continue to
  keep the police at bay until she secured that fortune. How stupid of them not
  to have put Mrs. George Rue on her guard against her and her blackmail that
  this former enemy had long ago suspected.</p>

  <p>How little any of it had availed&mdash;so much violence, so many lies,
  such intricate scheming, and she was where she had been, a poor missionary's
  widow. It was all the fault of her parents, who had brought her up so poorly,
  who had cheated her so cruelly, who had never given her a chance.</p>

  <p>She made her way home, using that word in her mind, with no sense of how
  grotesque it was in her case. She missed the direction several times, taking
  the wrong omnibus, and then the wrong train. Her extreme physical fatigue
  produced an exhilaration in her mind; she again saw hope. Old Mrs. Rue would
  die soon, and leave her all that money, how much had she said? Olivia could
  not remember, she was slightly light headed, but she was sure it was
  thousands and thousands of pounds. And jewels, too. This time there would be
  no one to rob her, as she had before been robbed of the bracelet, the
  clothes, the gold. Recalling that, she felt a surge of hatred against the
  painter. These seemed the worst of his crimes. A thousand pounds in gold, was
  it not? Or had Susan cheated? Surely that sum in gold would have been too
  heavy to carry. She had been cheated then, no doubt. Everyone had cheated
  her. Now she might have a little luck, just a little luck.</p>

  <p>If she could get that fortune from the doting old woman she could go
  abroad after all&mdash;Paris, Como&mdash;what other place had he
  mentioned?</p>

  <p>She would be alone, but she would be very shrewd and careful. No
  adventurer should get hold of her and deceive her again. She might take some
  respectable, grave woman with her, perhaps even the browbeaten Curtis who had
  once been so insolent but who now hastened humbly at her service. Yes, Curtis
  might do, to tyrannize over, she would be cheap, too, past her work, and glad
  to come for a pittance. She had to cross a corner of the heath, a darkling
  space, that reminded her of the common. For a second apprehension touched
  her, supposing he had followed her? Seen her with the detective? He or his
  spies? He must be skillful to be at large so long. There were solitary
  figures in the distance moving through the twilight, he might be one of them.
  He was wanted for murder. For murder.</p>

  <p>Olivia hastened, yet she was not frightened for long. Her uppermost
  thought was for the money. That was like an obsession with her, to get away,
  with money. She had been near the docks today, ships were there, waiting to
  sail all over the world...</p>

  <p>She knocked at the door of Mrs. George Rue's house, forgetting that she
  had a key. The façade rose like a dark rock against the faintly luminous sky.
  The windows were unlit, and each seemed gaping black holes onto an abyss.</p>

  <p>Curtis opened the door, with her iron-colored dress and hair, with her
  sallow face, she was barely distinguishable from the darkness of the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Is she dead?" asked Olivia, speaking her thought aloud.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said the servant softly, and, as Olivia crossed the threshold,
  she closed the door behind her, slowly, carefully she clicked the latch into
  place.</p>

  <p>"Is who dead, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I should not have put it like that. I have missed my way&mdash;so
  much trouble for nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll get something for your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I am very tired, I feel quite stupid. Is your mistress
  very ill? She must be&mdash;dying, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Come upstairs and see her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How can I, in the dark. I tell you I am very tired."</p>

  <p>Curtis pulled down the gas bracket, the metal chain clanked. The match
  flared and the acrid yellow flame spread fan shape in the opal globe that the
  servant returned to its place, shedding a ghastly light on the narrow hall,
  with the heavy umbrella stand and hatrack and the engraving of the "Stag at
  Bay" in the bird's-eye maple frame.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do look tired, really ill," remarked Curtis staring keenly at
  Olivia Sacret.</p>

  <p>This was a return to her former manner, insolence touched with malice, but
  Mrs. Sacret was too tired to resent that. She leaned against the wall of
  shining brown paper with a hateful pattern of lilies in diamonds varnished
  darkly. A foolish image of herself as a salvia&mdash;had not he, the murdered
  man, no, not that, she must not use that word, the dead man&mdash;said she
  looked like a salvia, puce, scarlet, crimson? And then it had withered to a
  dry stick. Then the picture of herself as she had wanted to be, and the
  street girl walking away in her rich clothes. She suddenly remembered the
  trunk, with the gray hairs inside, and how twice she had searched it for some
  luxurious scrap. Now she knew what it had once contained. At last.</p>

  <p>"Shall I help you upstairs?" asked Curtis. "She&mdash;the
  mistress&mdash;wants to see you. She has been quite anxious about you being
  away so long."</p>

  <p>"I did not have sufficient food," murmured Mrs. Sacret. "That was it, just
  a cup of coffee and a morsel, yes, that was it, a morsel of something or
  other&mdash;" she paused, for she felt giddy and had difficulty with her
  speech. "But Mrs. Rue was unconscious when I left. I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That she wouldn't recover? You've made a few mistakes, haven't you? Here,
  take my arm, you are poorly."</p>

  <p>Olivia clutched at the stiff poplin sleeve offered to her. All this was
  disagreeable, but the senile old woman must be dying, and then there would be
  freedom and money&mdash;Como, Paris.</p>

  <p>Curtis helped her up the stairs. As they were narrow the women trod on
  each other's skirts, mounting awkwardly, the servant supporting Olivia, up,
  into the darkness. In the same manner had Curtis gone up with Mrs. Rue to
  find Susan lying by her bed.</p>

  <p>"Why was not the gas lit?" asked Olivia as they reached the first landing
  and were beyond the sickly glow of the hall lamp. "I suppose you have lights
  in the bedroom? Is a nurse with her?"</p>

  <p>Without replying Curtis opened the door into the drawing room that was
  filled by the dull glow of an oil lamp, with a pink glass globe on which were
  engraved ferns. Mrs. George Rue sat in her usual armchair, carefully dressed
  in her widow's weeds, a box of mauve cachets in her hand.</p>

  <p>She looked like a toad, Olivia's thought darted, frightened through
  confusion, a toad, toadflax, spotted, blotched, pale, with very lively
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to fear you might not return, but you are too stupid to
  take a warning," remarked Mrs. Rue. "You returned, of course, hoping to find
  me dying or dead and the money yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia, pushed aside by Curtis, stumbled into a chair facing Mrs. Rue who
  sat with the large screen she used to protect her against drafts behind her.
  Olivia noticed that this was covered with scraps, children feeding rabbits,
  lambs in daisied fields, dogs with tartan bows, all varnished in place like
  the wallpaper in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do feel stupid," she murmured weakly. "I am tired&mdash;I'm glad
  you are feeling better&mdash;" she tried to smile.</p>

  <p>"I was not ill. I've played a long waiting game. I've been in touch with
  the police for months."</p>

  <p>"Why does Curtis stay? Standing in front of the door like that?"</p>

  <p>"She wants to hear what I have to say. Curtis was behind the screen that
  day you spoke so rashly to me, about my son's medicine."</p>

  <p>"I don't remember anything about that."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. You were easy to deceive. The police will get him
  sooner or later. For all his cunning, he was lured by that notice in the
  paper."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," Olivia listened to the rain that in a burst
  of sound was drumming on the roof of the porch.</p>

  <p>"I mean the murderer who is your accomplice. I suppose you didn't see him
  today?"</p>

  <p>"No, no."</p>

  <p>"But you saw Sergeant Precious. The police have been following you for
  days."</p>

  <p>"What is that to you?" Olivia glanced from one to the other of the gray,
  sallow, vindictive faces. "Why are you doing this? You hated
  Susan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe I did. But you cheated me of the chance to tell her I was mistaken.
  She gave me back Martin's money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Always the money," sneered Olivia, trying to rise but falling back.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have come back here, for the money now, haven't you? But there
  is nothing for you. Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing but your punishment," said Curtis.</p>

  <p>"Why should I be punished?" Olivia contrived to rise and faced them,
  staring from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"You believe in punishment, don't you? You talked much of God once, you
  and your chapel ways. Punishment, yes, and Hell, too."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be dying! You ought to be dead!" cried Olivia. "This is all
  a cheat! Everyone cheats me! Everyone. Why did you pretend to be so ill?"</p>

  <p>"Easy to trick you now, blindly greedy and stupid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I'd known you were deceiving me&mdash;" Olivia's lips widened into a
  convulsive grin.</p>

  <p>"You'd have found some more poison?" put in Curtis sharply. "We thought of
  that and took good care."</p>

  <p>"You were a fool not to know hatred when it was all about you," said Mrs.
  Rue, munching her mauve cachets slowly.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to do with me?" asked Olivia. "I'm on the safe side of
  the law. I'm acting for the police," she touched her bosom. "I have the
  detective's card here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought you would betray your accomplice. But it won't avail you.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, it will. I shall get a reward. Of course, I never knew. I've
  only just put two and two together&mdash;the trunk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the trunk. It is what you put in my son's drink that matters
  to me and the way you hounded Susan to her death, and she was a good woman,
  after all."</p>

  <p>"Then <i>you</i> are a fool, stupid&mdash;she was a trollop&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a low word to use!" smiled Mrs. Rue. "But of course I always knew
  you were not a lady."</p>

  <p>Curtis had flushed darkly and advanced on Olivia.</p>

  <p>"I'd stand hours in the rain&mdash;coming down like it is now&mdash;to see
  you on the gallows," she cried.</p>

  <p>The three women, now close together, stared at one another in silent
  loathing, exhausted by the emotions behind this rapid conversation. Olivia
  writhed, as if in a trap, as if something was clinging to her skirts and
  bringing her down into a pit. A pit I dug for myself, she thought with
  incoherent memories of the chapel.</p>

  <p>"Now you can go," said Mrs. Rue at length, with a sigh. "Now&mdash;as you
  stand, without food or drink or rest or respite, or money or even your
  luggage."</p>

  <p>"I won't&mdash;This&mdash;this is monstrous."</p>

  <p>"I am quite strong. With the help of Curtis I shall put you out. The house
  is lonely. And I don't suppose you will care to knock up the neighbors with
  your tale."</p>

  <p>Seeing an inflexible hatred in the eyes of both mistress and maid, Olivia
  made an effort at dignity.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I shall go to the police. I am under their protection. They
  may give me a reward."</p>

  <p>"For betraying your accomplice?" remarked Mrs. Rue. "Not likely But you
  can try."</p>

  <p>Olivia moistened her lips and glanced at Curtis who did not move from the
  door.</p>

  <p>"What is your intention with me?" she asked. "What have you been planning
  for, working for, ever since you began to deceive me?'</p>

  <p>"A waste of breath these questions. I suppose you are afraid to go where
  you sent my son and Susan?"</p>

  <p>"Where was that?" whispered Olivia stupidly.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know&mdash;with your missionary training." A spasm distorted
  the old woman's heavy face. "Into the dark, at least. It isn't so easy to
  believe in Heaven when those you want are gone and don't answer when you
  call."</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>you</i> want to live?" whispered Curtis curiously, turning
  a frowning brow toward Olivia. "My mistress had cause&mdash;young, pretty,
  and good, no harm in her&mdash;but <i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> want to live!" cried Mrs. Sacret. "Anyhow, anywhere&mdash;You
  said I might go&mdash;why don't you stand away from the door? I'll do what I
  can to help you, I'll go to the police station, I'll assist the detective, it
  was all <i>his</i> fault, the wicked man&mdash;I fell into the power of a
  rogue, yes, if you'll let me <i>go</i>, I'll run at once to the police
  station!"</p>

  <p>"She thinks we are going to kill her," smiled Mrs. Rue nodding across the
  faintly lit gloom toward Curtis. "So you'll run at once to the police
  station? But it is the other side of the heath and a dark night, no moon and
  the rain coming down."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind, only let me go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let her go, Curtis."</p>

  <p>The gray servant moved from the door. Relief shot energy into Olivia's
  limbs that ached with fatigue. She steadied herself, mechanically adjusting
  her bonnet.</p>

  <p>"You are very glad to escape, aren't you?" remarked Mrs. Rue. "Very
  thankful to leave Curtis and myself in this lonely house&mdash;all the other
  servants are out of the way, they always are on these occasions, you'll have
  noticed that&mdash;You are so thankful to escape that you don't notice that
  you are hungry and tired, and dizzy&mdash;yes, you're quite giddy, you know,
  and still don't understand very clearly."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret crept around along the wall to the door, supporting herself by
  outspread hands. How she had always detested this room, so dreary, such
  atrocious taste, like Susan's house, very different from the place she had
  meant to have in Como, Paris, where was it?</p>

  <p>Curtis was standing aside to allow her to pass. This seemed incredible,
  for the two women in their intense quiet were murderous.</p>

  <p>Surely fear eclipsed her hatred of them, she wanted to thank them, to
  cringe, to assure them that she meant no harm&mdash;"I was inexperienced and
  I had bad advice, I lacked a friend."</p>

  <p>"The police station," repeated Mrs. Rue, "is on the other side of the
  heath."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret paused. Curtis had stretched her arm across the door.</p>

  <p>"Your accomplice did not keep his appointment," added the old woman, "that
  was because he saw you with the detective. What do you suppose he felt, this
  criminal, at your betrayal?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sacret remembered those half-seen figures in the twilight on the
  heath as she had made her way to the Cedars.</p>

  <p>"I shall be safe at the police station," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You won't get there," smiled Mrs. Rue. "He'll be waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you think that he followed me!"</p>

  <p>"I do. You are the decoy for the police now, they'll be watching wherever
  you are, to catch him, that is why they let you go today&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I am safe&mdash;I shall be protected."</p>

  <p>"I have to risk that. Of course, the police have had you shadowed for a
  long time in the hopes of catching him, but he's been too clever. Now there
  is a chance he will be so inflamed by your treachery that he won't be so
  prudent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He didn't follow me!" cried Olivia. "No one followed me! He did not
  follow me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you know? It was nearly dark when you arrived, but too light for
  him to have attacked you. Open the door, Curtis."</p>

  <p>The servant obeyed, the darkness of the stairs showed, with a glimpse of
  the gaslight in the hall.</p>

  <p>Olivia drew back.</p>

  <p>"I can't go. The rain. As if it would never stop," she muttered.</p>

  <p>"That is what children say, 'as if it would never stop.' It will cease but
  perhaps you won't be there when the clouds break."</p>

  <p>"I won't go. You can't do this. I know that he would kill me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, as he killed the others&mdash;" nodded old Mrs. Rue, her crape
  bonnet casting a wavering shadow on the screen.</p>

  <p>"Come along," said Curtis taking Mrs. Sacret by the arm. "I want to shut
  the door, the mistress is in a draft."</p>

  <p>From weakness and to avoid the servant's grip, Olivia fell clumsily to her
  knees. Curtis held her tightly, Mrs. Rue rose, lumbered over to her and took
  her other arm. Panic weakened her as she realized their strength; even the
  old woman was able to drag her up, to force her to the door, to tear her
  fingers away as she tried to cling to the handle.</p>

  <p>"You'll only hurt yourself," said Mrs. Rue. "It wouldn't be any use to cry
  or to struggle. After all, you may get to the police station in time, your
  accomplice may not have followed you. What do you think, Curtis?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think he followed her, I think that he is waiting out there in the
  rain&mdash;the heath is so lonely, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I won't leave the garden," whimpered Olivia. "If you push me out of the
  house, I'll stay in the garden until it is light."</p>

  <p>"But the garden is just where he would hide&mdash;so many low
  bushes&mdash;so very dark."</p>

  <p>They led her downstairs slowly, Curtis forcing her along, Mrs. Rue heavily
  behind, pushing her, now with her hands, now with her stick. In the hall she
  was on her knees again, entreating them, only for a little respite now, a
  glass of water, yes, just that, or a chance to say her prayers.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rue, breathing heavily from her exertions, laughed at that. Her
  stolid, pallid features were unchanged, only her eyes shone with a fixed,
  ferocious gleam. Curtis was quite disfigured by a fearful contortion that
  gave her haggard face a look of mortal illness.</p>

  <p>Between them they dragged the trembling Olivia to her feet again and Mrs.
  Rue held her by the umbrella stand, while Curtis opened the door. And the
  rain blew in with an eddy of wind.</p>

  <p>"I'd better get away from them," thought Olivia in a crazy panic, "and try
  to run to the police station&mdash;perhaps he didn't follow me after
  all."</p>

  <p>So she did not resist as Curtis pushed her over the threshold, she even
  felt a lift of her terror as the dark eclipsed those two faces full of hatred
  and the cool rain and the fresh breeze enveloped her in a veil of water and
  wind.</p>

  <p>A blur of light fell across the two wet steps and onto the glistening
  leaves of the laurels, the slanting raindrops showed a hastening silver
  against the outer darkness.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" cried Curtis, pulling Mrs. Rue back. "There is a man
  there&mdash;in the shrubs&mdash;" and she shut the door on Olivia Sacret.</p>

  <p>Silence and solitary desolation surrounded her, black shadows, darker than
  the darkness, bore down on her, the rain had a stinging feel, a sighing sound
  that was not in nature, but demoniacal, like the night. She beat on the door
  and shrieked again and again. Her hands were soon bruised and her throat
  sore, her voice whistled vainly.</p>

  <p>Pressed against the door she peered about. Where was he? Any of the bushes
  could have hidden him. Why were not the police there to help her. Something
  seemed to stir and swoop in the rustling laurels. Sobbing, she cast herself
  on the door. It seemed incredible to her that the lock could withstand her
  frantic pressure.</p>

  <p>She heard a window open above, and stepped back to shriek for pity with a
  strength renewed from hope. He would not dare to touch her while those two
  looked on.</p>

  <p>The window sash was raised, the curtains had been drawn, and a patch of
  dull light showed against which were the outlines, uncertain, dark,
  featureless, of the two women leaning out into the rain, the white cap of
  Curtis clear above the blank shadow of her face, Mrs. Rue one heavy smear of
  black. Her crape veil was blowing across her gloating eyes and pursed mouth,
  through the mesh of darkness she gazed down into darkness, tangled in her
  mourning, not heeding it.</p>

  <p>"He is behind you!" cried Curtis. "Better make a dash for it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can see him," came the flat voice of Mrs. Rue. "Better say your
  prayers now if you can remember any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Olivia felt her senses recede, the patch of light that was the window, the
  patches of darkness that were the murderous women, staring down, the
  blackness that was the house, and all the shapes of bushes that seemed to
  crouch and creep, wheeled around her, as if she were the focus of all these
  terrors. She was conscious of the implacable, unyielding surface of the door
  against which she flung her weight again, hearing him approach, feeling his
  fingers around her throat. Then the rain was flung, a gush from a spout, onto
  her upturned face, blinding her, falling into her open, soundless mouth, and
  she was on her knees for the third time, and she heard Mrs. Rue's toneless
  voice, "You asked for some water," then the silence joined the darkness in
  oblivion for Olivia Sacret.</p>

  <p>When she had been quiet for a long time, the widow and Susan's servant
  came down to look at her; they had been enjoying tea and scones, with
  raspberry jam and cream. Without comment they had sat down together, drawing
  the curtains across the rain. They were exhausted and ate and drank with
  avidity. What they had done had been partly the result of long planning and
  partly inspiration arising from the moment. Some power, they did not concern
  themselves with the name of it, had delivered their enemy into their hands
  and they had richly used their opportunity. Her body blocked the door, but
  Curtis soon had it pushed aside. Mrs. Rue held a lamp and lowered this to
  stare down at what lay across the steps.</p>

  <p>"Feel her wrist and her heart, Curtis."</p>

  <p>"No need, ma'am. I don't want to wet my dress. She's dead&mdash;look at
  her face."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," said Mrs. Rue, lowering the lamp and peering. "What shall we
  say to the police?"</p>

  <p>"The truth, that's always best, if one can&mdash;yet we needn't say
  anything. Knowing she'd betrayed him, she thought he was following her and
  died of fright. The doctor will find that&mdash;heart failure."</p>

  <p>"And we didn't hear anything, Curtis?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't hear anything. How should we?&mdash;with the rain coming down,
  and the wind, too&mdash;And who is to know she screamed?"</p>
